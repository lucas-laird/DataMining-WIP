I don't always have good service at Olive Garden (depending on location) but this time was different! Our server Colin M was wonderful!! Very young and sweet. He definitely had fun with us during our dine in. Times like that is why we go back!! We made 2 orders and both times were extremely timely. Our parents were happy with their dinner at home as well.

263098,2013-10-09,0,XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q,only one area section opened and it was too crowded (including a couple of families with playful children). the noise level was unreal. hoping to have a relaxing lunch with my husband but we had to shout to hear each other. we each order the buy one/ take one...should of checked the bag before we left because it was the wrong order! when we first arrive I did request to be seated at a table (husband handicap) but given a half booth. Really wished we we would gone to the other end of the parking lot ate at Lindo Michoacan or Red Robin. BTW food was good but if I wanted to eat with a bunch of children I would of gone to Chucky Cheese. Have no problem with children at restaurant but I think these parent could of had better control on the noise and perhaps the hostess should of opened up another section.,wyF9a37RqEELLik52rFW4A,0,0,3,UNq6JmpBjh-DMzNIx6_fYA

Not only did it take 30ish minute for us to get our food, despite not being very busy, my tortellini were still cold with lukewarm sauce poured over top. The other pasta dish was also cold despite the fact that my husbands came out piping hot. I told our waitress and she didn't seem to care too much, she basically said deal with it. Considering I couldn't eat two of the items I ordered I'm pretty ticked I spent 20$ on a plate. We won't be going back here again.

Update: I called the next day and spoke with the manager Leslie. She was understanding, helpful, and on top of addressing the issue. She made it clear that the food and service we reviewed was unacceptable and she corrected the issue. We intend to go back shortly and I will definitely ask for Leslie if I have any problems!

393948,2016-07-27,0,XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q,"I must say....years went by without me visiting an Olive Garden, because I felt that they had gone to S***. This new location opened up a couple of years ago and I haven't had anything but great experiences. 
The servers are great: they're friendly, attentive, and happy. I love it. We dined here Monday night and my husband even ventured off of his usual and tried the new steak alfredo with gorgonzola and spinach in it; he added shrimp of course. It was delicious!!! I even liked it better than mine; the stuffed chicken marsala which I think is amazing. 
I really keep going in for the knochi soup. I can't even eat my entree so I just take it home. I always feel bad for asking to take soup home but my server made sure I had my late night snack. LOVE HIM!! I can't remember his name and I wish I could because he was great. OH WAIT! It was Dakota!!! So props to you Dakota for making our dining experience a good one! We will be back of course. It is actually the best place to eat around here. BJ's went downhill, Red Robin-well, it's Red Robin. Don't even get me started on Firerock. That place is a joke.  Michocaan is good. 
Anyway, this is a review for Olive Garden! 
Oh and we notice that every time we dine there, a manager always checks on us. It should be done EVERYWHERE. So we appreciate you and all your staff. Didn't get his name but I have never seen him before, a thin black gentleman was there that night. Friendly demeanor and he made it a point to visit all tables that were in the restaurant.

For the first time in recent history our breadsticks were very fresh and right out of the oven. The salad seemed fresher today also...not that it's ever been bad.  I had sat my empty glass out to see how long it took to get the raspberry lemonade refilled & the waiter had to be asked for a refill when he came by and asked how we were doing.  Had he been paying attn it should have been apparent.  My guest had iced tea and her glass was about half full bit was not offered a refill. Fortunately she hadn't wanted more anyway.

My cousin ordered a strawberry passion fruit lemonade , and a shrimp scampi special order (must try!). Her daughter had Mac n cheese with a side of fries , and I had a peach Bellini with seafood Alfredo . I also asked Ray if he could bring us zucchini frittata as an appetizer . He said that was a great choice since it is the last day for it. 

When our meals got to the table by another server, pretty quickly I might add, there was a few things that were off. 

My cousins' lemonade was a sprite, she had asked for grilled shrimp and got fried shrimps instead and Ray came up and told me he had forgot to add my appetizer and If I still wanted it. I said no.

When I get better table service at a fast food restaurant like In n' Out than at Olive Garden it makes me want to stop going. To avoid the terrible service we've started using their order online and pickup service on late work days because we can pick it up on the way home. The takeout service is packaged nicely and you get a good sized salad for each entrée ordered. My husband and I usually each eat half our meal and save the second half for lunch the next day. The salads are large enough that we can usually split one for 2 people and save the second one to eat with our left overs the next day. If you want to eat at the restaurant, eat in the bar!

We told the bartender/server staff about it and asked them to let the kitchen know.  I'm assuming their risotto is cooked in batches with precooked rice so the whole batch would be ""crunchy"".  The male bar porter came up and offered a choice of Alfredo or marinara dipping sauce for the bread already in front of us.  We said marinara, please.
The short story?  The check came and nothing was taken off for the undercooked risotto that we never ate and sent back.  The offer of the the marinara sauce cost us $4.00 which the bar porter neglected to mention.  I think this restaurant is going through start up problems.

Lo and behold there was a dead fly on the remainder of his salad.  Obviously I was not happy about this and called for management.  They had comped our meals and was apologetic which was fine, we weren't going to make a big deal out of it or make a scene, however, we left with an uneasy feeling and hoped that the next time would be better than that visit.


We jump to today as we decided to give it another go as we wanted to celebrate a family event and the Cheyenne location was too far away from our residence.  We should have just gone the extra distance!  While the food did not contain any unwanted critters or ""special surprises,"" the service itself was displeasing.  Drinks were forgotten, drinks came too late, our entrees came about 45min after we had finished our appetizers, no refills were offered, and how many times could the other people working there possibly ask OUR server to come back to the table for us to get To-Go containers, our dessert orders, and the check?!

With this in mind I had a low expectation of the service my wife and I would receive. I arrived earlier than my wife and as soon as I walked in the host greeted me with an eccentric ""Welcome!""

Service was fast, our waitress was not friendly but not rude either. Our food came out very quick. So quick that I was sitting with an entree and basically a full soup bowl. That's not a worthy gripe in my opinion just something to note. The capellini I ordered was decent, nothing too special. 
The one thing I did notice and wanted to mention is their prices on their menu are not what they charge. Every item on our receipt was just a little more expensive than what is presented on the menu. The capellini on the menu is 11.50 but our check said 11.99, the dipping sauce 3.75, charged 3.79, etc... Not a huge deal, and not even big enough for me to say anything but either their menu is outdated (which is unlikely since they just opened this location) or The OG has figured out a clever way of sneaking in a few extra dollars per ticket. Too subtle to really notice or even complain about. I don't know, you be the judge.

2389082,2013-06-04,0,XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q,"Alright, grand opening day for this Olive Garden location. Not so much a review as it is feedback/constructive criticism for management- 

Upon entering there was a wait, my name was taken and given a wait time: accurate estimate of 5-10 minutes. The hostesses could be more professional and more friendly- first and last impression of the restaurant and that should be taken into consideration by them- more smiles, eye contact are necessary as guests can appreciate that more and are more patient when the staff are warm, friendly, and sincere; speaking of sincere, the hosts attitude and voices are forced and far from meaning what they say (such as ""thank you"" or ""I'm so sorry"") being a host and previous assistant manager of a restaurant myself- the small details are what are pertinent. Mirror the personality of your guests to create a bond and interaction. The host that led me to my seat was more friendly and personable, smiling and explaining who my server would be, did not leave with a parting comment like ""enjoy"" or ""thank you"".  Also this is a casual fine dining atmosphere, slang and lack of professionalism should be no where near here. No one wants to hear ""ok, YOU GUYS, you're table is done and good to go. Follow her back that wayyyy."" It's not ""do you want/if you want"" : much more proper to say ""would you like/if you would like to"". Or looking for a party by shouting out their last name through three sections of the restaurant ""BAXTER! BAXTER! BAXTER?! BAXTER?!"" Then coming back in saying ""nope, gone."" It is in better interest to write a description of the party (if in the event the beepers run out, which I'm sure was the case here?), walk up to the party and greet using a salutation- ""Mr. Baxter, the table is prepared for your party of four; I do apologize for the wait. Would you follow me please?"" And then thank the party for their patience when seating them, give their servers name, and part with wishing them to enjoy their dinner. Lacking in class and most definitely smiles- focused is alright but please, ladies, do not look miserable doing your job- you set the tone for the restaurant!

My server was Devon. I waited 4 minutes to be greeted, not too bad. She looked rushed and frustrated, the table behind me was waiting for 15 minutes to be helped until a manager came to take the order. Employees, your managers are here to help; don't sacrifice the patience or enjoyment of the party you are waiting on because you are hurried, ask for help to greet or take an order, just a few minutes and you could lose a tip or a customer forever. She didn't offer wine or even remove the glasses from the table when I mentioned I only came for dessert, nor was she very savvy on the menus: I'm not quite sure if she even looked at one before because I asked a question about having another dessert menu and she searched frantically saying, ""lemme see if its on the back here."" I told her I already checked and it wasn't. She was sort of shocked and said she would go ask the bar if they had one. Came back later, took my order and didn't collect the menus until half way through. Once she was not so rushed she smiled and made eye contact. Confidence is key employees, act like you know what you are doing, move with grace, don't let the frantic show on your face, and you will have us all fooled (in a good way). She waited to bring my check, didn't rush me, so I can appreciate that :) .

The Dolcinis- two were frostbitten/completely frozen (strawberry and tiramisu), the lemon mousse was perfect. Writing this review, I have been waiting for the other two to defrost enough to taste the flavor and not ice. 

Overall, the first day is bumpy but going well from what I see. All the rest will come in time. Thank you management! I wish you all well in your business and personal endeavors!

This was written on my initial visit to OG.

Found out that my favorite event at OG was going on and since we hadn't yet been into our neighborhood OG since it was new, it was a easy choice. We arrived and and were seated immediately by the front entrance.

 Nikki was our waitress and we placed our orders. I ordered the Asaigo garlic alfredo on angle hair pasta and the chicken noki soup. After the normal wait time our salads and soups were brought to the table. I kind of laughed as there was only about 1/4 inch of soup in my bowl. All broth and 1 piece of gnocchi. I started to eat it and about 5 minutes later Nikki stopped by to check on us. I asked for another bowl of soup, and she stated,"" I don't know why your filling up on soup when you ordered the endless pasta."" Well, I was embarrassed and just told her I like the soup. She leaves and brings back another bowl of soup and it is once again only has about 1/4 of a inch of soup in it with no gnocchi  at all. Just the broth! I asked Nikki why this was and she said she had to scrap the bottom of the pan to get that much and that they were waiting on someone to bring them more.  Now I know this is just me, but the manager stops over with a big smile wanting to know how we are doing. I told him that I was put off by Miss Nikki and what she said to me. How awkward I felt. He said he would get to the bottom of it. Now out comes Nikki bringing me a full bowl of soup and asks me in a condescending voice, ""is that enough gnocchi ?"" WTF!!! I didn't even ask for that bowl! Now while she is there someone else brings out our food. So I have my pasta in front of me and I don't even touch the soup. 

I am disappointed in my service. I really did not enjoy my dining experience because of this particular person. I would much rather drive the extra 5-6 miles down to Cheyenne Rd and go to that OG. Because for the 7 years I have been going there I have had excellent service.

Other locations I've been to in CA don't have that stale, microwave taste, with hard ends; however, this location has had stale bread sticks both times I've been here. 
The servers were nice, but seemed overwhelmed and under-trained. This is the fault of management for setting their servers up for failure! They were so behind and I felt badly for them. 
Overall, the food is inconsistent, but the servers are nice.",oTLY1xiJBheerlvuulXocQ,0,0,2,9holmIECV-lJ6CdToTAglg

The Spaghetti was disappointing. Both the pasta and marinara sauce tasted somewhat flavorless. I doubt they put any salt or other seasoning in the water when they boil the pasta, but they need too. The marinara sauce was down right watery. Take a look of the pic I took of the spaghetti and it is so watery it makes you wonder if it was suppose to be minestrone soup!

let me start of by saying that I love olive garden.  We did not have one back from Hawaii (although there are rumors that one is being built in Kapolei) so every time i came to the mainland I made sure I stopped at one.  Now that I moved here, I can come here anytime.

We were seated right away and as soon as we sat down, my daughter said we should order calamari.  The person who seated us was surprised that she liked calamari.  What was even more shocking is what came out of the hostess's mouth.  She said calamari was octopus.  I told her no it is squid. ""Well isn't a squid and octopus the same thing""  Ummmm no it's not.  I was shocked that someone who worked there didn't no this piece of information.

Anyway fast forward to our server who was slower than molasses. Our drinks were messed up and the food came out before we were even done eating our salads.  This guy was sweating so bad it was gross.

Maybe this is a sign from calorie gods that i should not be wasting my calories on olive garden and pick a different place for a cheat meal.  Nonetheless how can you go wrong on never-ending pasta bowls.  Yummo.  the garlic sticks are to die for and that salad dressing has me drooling right now.  I was so excited to see the dressing at Sam's Club..

I will come back and give this place another shot.  Hopefully my waiter will look like he did not just run a marathon.

pros:
ample parking
never-ending soup/salad
delicious food
short wait time

cons:
sweaty waiters",lgxCqDMnowyx1Q5fLdLPCA,2,1,3,Vui6KqAwAaVltEuSzZny-w

3328964,2018-01-16,0,XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q,"So Olive Garden has had the same menu for as long as I can remember, and the food is consistently good across multiple Vegas locations. Food-wise, you pretty much always know what you're going to get. Mom and I wanted pasta after massages on Monday, 1/15 and decided to visit the Centennial Hills location. 
The food was, as always, good. We both had salad and chicken fettuccine. Get a side of alfredo sauce to dip the bread sticks in-it makes them that much better. 
Where they lose stars for me, is the service. So we didn't get a receipt because the Ziosk was out of paper, which is annoying and a problem I run into consistently at the chains that use those. I don't recall our servers name, because despite being incredibly loud and attempting to joke with us, I don't recall him ever introducing himself. He was so loud that we could hear him across the room, and rather than just taking our order he kept trying to make jokes and comment on everything, which got kind of old. I'm all about friendly service, but your jokes (that I could hear you using at other tables as well) weren't funny and frankly half the things he said just confused me.

It was busy and we didn't mind waiting the 30 min for a party of 5. After sitting there 20 min, 6 young girls showed up. All of a sudden after a couple minutes, they get seated after they went in a 2nd time. We thought that was kind of odd. Well we been watching this whole thing to find out, the host is telling all those young people to check in thru their phone for faster seating. That pissed me off. We were sitting there with a 7 and 8 year old that were hungry and the young kids that come in get extra fast treatment. Then our buzzer goes off and they want to sit 5 of us on a 4 seat table. You have to be kidding me, we don't fit on a 4 top! If I spend my $ I want to compftable sit at my table and not being squished!

I wish this would be the only issue, but to our bad, the calamari was not like usual, they must have changes supplier. And they also were not cooked long enough.

Oscar, I believe he was one of the managers, came around to see how everything was & even asked if he could bring me a different dish.

3737582,2014-12-28,1,XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q,"This spot was selected  for our belated Christmas get together with the kiddos and family this past Friday. It's a solid place for a family get together and they make sure the kids get their crayons and coloring books to stay entertained while the food is being prepared.  A busy Friday night for a table of four  plus two kids equated to a 35 min wait. They only take reservations 2 hours ahead of your planned arrival (read: call ahead of time and not last minute like I did).

Our table ordered a variety that includes their smoked mozzarella fonduta appetizer (melted smoky blend of a variety of cheese served with slices of Tuscan bread- yum), seafood fettuccine alfredo (w/ shrimp and scallops), the kids got spaghetti and meatballs with extra marinara to dip breadsticks, and I ordered their  unlimited Zuppa Toscana (bits of spicy sausage w/ kale and chunks of  potatoes in a creamy broth) and breadsticks (so worth it) along with peach iced tea (sweetened). The food was good and no one at the table was disappointed. Our meals were solid carb-loaded comfort food and it was exactly what I expected-- A-OK.

TIP: EAT IN THE BAR (21+).  When my husband and I come here by ourselves we easily scoot in and are seated in the bar and eating in less than ten/fifteen minutes (even in the middle of the Friday/Saturday night dinner rush).

3911947,2013-05-26,2,XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q,"It did not surprise me that there was a wait at a new location, but there were probably 8 employees behind the hostess station looking like they had no idea where they were. After our name was on the waiting list, (40 minutes) I could not find a place to sit, so I thought there may be room to sit in the ladies room. On my way to the bathroom I had to wade through about 50 servers milling about in the aisles. This is a big location, but there is no way they need a staff of 200 inexperienced servers to stand around looking confused in groups of two.

We did wait less than the predicted time, but I think that was due to the fact that the people in line before us were no where to be found when their names were called. We were seated at a decent table, but the building is loud and overcrowded, so we couldn't hear each other talking. That makes a meal awkward enough, but we were also being interrupted constantly by servers delivering items to our table that were meant for other tables.

Our server was nice and tried his best, but I think in general they trained these servers to up sell and serve wine samples, but not on practical things like table numbers or order timing. When I saw the new menu, it made more sense since they are obviously all about the money, money, money. The prices have gone up! I suppose they need more money to help them pay the cost of the new building and maintaining an army of untrained servers to run around being useless and blocking fire exits all the time.

Our entrees were served before we had a chance to eat our salad and the appetizer came out 10 minutes after that. I guess they were going for a reverse dining experience. The food came out so fast and inappropriately timed that I felt we were being rushed out. Combined with the loud atmosphere and the numerous people stopping by the table it felt like eating at a parody of a good  restaurant.

The food itself, while served way too quickly, was also not very good. I am a fan of Olive Garden, so I am not sure if they changed the menu or it is just being executed poorly. The salad was gross and rubbery, my fettuccini was bland and my boyfriend's ziti was so salty he was draining Lake Mead with all the water refills. 

The appetizer was okay, but honestly I'll eat pretty much anything as long as you deep fry it. Additionally, it is hard to enjoy an appetizer when it comes out after you've already started your actual meal. With that much food on the table you start to realize how much you are pigging out right now. Nobody wants to be reminded of the call to Jenny Craig they will have to make as a result of this one meal. The server did apologize for this, but no one offered to take the appetizer off the bill... or even to take it back. Just shut up and eat your pile of food, fatty.

Even though there were people everywhere throwing food at us and asking us how we were doing at the beginning of the meal, they all disappeared at check time. I guess they get yelled at a lot for those sneaky upsells? The manager came by after several minutes, but we just wanted to give them our money and leave by then. Honestly, this Olive Garden needs to call its birth mother and get some guidance about how to win at being a real restaurant. Maybe we will try it again in a year. Until then I think we will stick with the Red Robin right next door.",mtpQBE8yTL8oTo0KrJcd9A,5,2,1,azibwQAEId41VarZ7zi7JA

We decided to order to go since it was late & yes we were aware that it's Valentines night so they are most likely busy (which was fine). I've never ordered to go, so I enter in the front & approached the front desk & being that of course, it was busy looks like the 3-4 employees working, were trying to figure out a seating situation. I stood their patiently for a minute, a couple comes behind me a few seconds later & gets helped first. The hostess sits them down & when she comes back I then ask her for help. I was fine with waiting, it was more or less that she had an answer back to me. Instead of maybe saying I'm sorry or something else for that matter. Thought this was really rude & inconsiderate as to the fact that I was ignored & clearly was there first.

Went to the Togo window & they said they were still waiting for some of my food items, which I was perfectly fine with waiting again. Long story short, when I called in the person that took my order, made a mistake and rang in for tomorrow instead.

Then along came Molly, our server.  She took our drink order, and immediately started engaging with our son.  Without our having to ask, she brought him out a complimentary plate of black olives, which he loves to stick on his fingers.  (He gets that from his uncle on his Mom's side - definitely!)  Before long, the Grumpus was banished, and my sweet little boy had returned!

As with most Olive Garden restaurants, the food was very good but not outstanding.  But you don't go to the Olive Garden for Gourmet.  In short order, my ravioli, my wife's lasagna, and my boy's mac-n-cheese were demolished, and we were all very happy campers.

Molly got a 25% tip.  She earned it.  If you have a grumpy kid, ask for her section.  We also made sure to get her manager to the table and sing her praises.

I used the breadsticks to soak up the pomodoro sauce from the bowl. The husband loved his grilled salmon and  broccoli too. He actually insisted we give Olive Garden a 5*

4014546,2013-09-13,0,XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q,"Newest Olive Garden in the Centennial area.  It's about as average as a restaurant can get.  So not bad, but far from great.

Honestly, the main reason my family and I ever end up at Olive Garden is for the never ending pasta bowl.  I mean come on, isn't why a lot of folks go?  It's probably one of their better deals.  $9.99 (used to be a few bucks cheaper a few years ago) for all the salad, breadsticks, and pasta you can handle?  I'm sure marathoners carbo-loading give this one a go!  However, I'm a bit weak in the pasta eating area, after two servings consider me down for the count.  Too many carbs!  But I'm more a purist in my pasta dishes, whenever we come in I usually go for the spaghetti with meat sauce, or the fettuccine alfredo.  Every once in a while I'll go for one of Olive Garden's new sauce.  Is it just me or do the breadsticks taste different now?  Seems so not homemade anymore.  It's like the kind you can find in Costco already semi-prebaked.  Not my favorite like long ago.  I like the salad, but since now you can basically buy Olive Garden Italian dressing and croutons in places like Sam's Club, it's super easy to replicate at home.  

Olive Garden does use decent pasta though, and cook it well enough on most occasions.  This new location in Centennial is often packed when we pass by, so obviously they must be doing someting right.  But yes, with the vast amount of choices to get quality Italian dining (anyone for $25 spaghetti in marinara at Scarpetta?) you can have your pick of the moon.  It is convenient though for folks like us on the NW side of town, who aren't exactly the closes the fine dining on The Strip.  I just don't find Olive Garden the most exotic of places is all.  It's an OK chain, but yep it's still a chain.

Our service at this particular Olive Garden was spectacular though.  Our waitress was very friendly, quick to refill our items, not pushy, very patient, and let us go free with the fresh grated pecorino-romano cheese!  We were there for a while for dinner, and she never rushed us once.  I'd go back again if she were our server.  Nice gal.

It's been a long time since I've tried anything else besides the never ending pasta bowl on Olive Garden's menu.  To me, it's just a tad expensive.  For around the same amount of money, you could go to a decent buffet in town, or a place for Happy Hour.  I'm all about cheaper eats, so we rarely choose Olive Garden.  Many of their dishes are just on the expensive side, and I don't usually want to get full off of pasta.  A dish averaging $14 -$16 seems the norm, and I often think I can find a better bargain for dinner somewhere else.  I'm sure the pricing is one of the reasons Olive Garden started heavily promoting their never ending pasta bowl as an excellent value.  

I'll be back to Olive Garden, but only when I see a good bargain!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,1,3,ab8ByrduFYckChwpHZfFNA

He also never came back and the other guy ignored us because he was on the phone forever. We stood around and waited a good 20 to 30 minutes just for someone to acknowledge us.

FOOD: 3/5 
started off with complimentary bread sticks & ordered the alfredo sauce to go along. i had the chicken & gnocchi soup, & we both had their house salad. whatever sauce they use on their salad, definitely working for them. it was delicious. the fact that my boyfriend loves it ( he hates veggies ) says something. 

for our main dish, we both decided on their special ""make your own tour of italy"". we both got the lasagna & fettuccine alfredo, & i had the tortellini al forno & he had the ravioli. the fettuccine alfredo was my favorite. the rest was ehh, nothing special. a bit too much cheese & kinda salty for my liking. for the price ( $12.99 ), it was good. 

i signed up for their eclub, so we got a free dessert, their zeppoli with chocolate sauce. best item of the night. it was yummy. a perfect ending of the night. 

SERVICE: 4/5

Jeremiah was our waiter and he was very helpful and attentive. I ordered the chicken fettucini Alfredo and it showed up in a timely manner. My chicken had a lot of fat on it so I didn't enjoy it completely but after some picking at it it was good. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a little lacking in flavor but after some salt and pepper was good. The breadsticks as usually were good.  I forgot to ask him to split the check until he came with it but he quickly took it back and split it without warrant and had my to go soup ready when I left.

I normally don't review a chain restaurant because everyone knows what they are like and it really is the same wherever you go in the US.  But, I was more impressed than usual last night for several reasons.  

First, the drink menu.  I was surprised to see so many original, signature cocktails and non-alcoholic choices.  I tried the Green Apple Moscato Sangria and my daughter had the Green Apple Soda.  Both were fantastic and not overly sweet, except for the soda, which was topped with cotton candy (see photo.)

Next, the seasonal menu had a few creative pasta combinations and quite a bit if new seafood options.  Most of us stuck to the old classics, but none of us were disappointed.  I did try the new Giant Meatball four cheese manicotti.  The portion was enough for three people, so I'll be having it for lunch tomorrow.  It was perfectly seasoned and tasty!  

And finally, parking is always easy and convenient, and getting a table for a large group does not cause a horrible long wait.

I often come to this location with my family but I will never come back again after tonight. I placed an order online for pickup. My pick up time is 9:40pm & I arrive at 9:43pm. I stand in the To-Go section waiting with the young black woman with braids is across from me & it takes awhile standing there before I am acknowledged. I receive no greeting or a smile. I state that I am there to pick up and order for Crystal. She reads off an order for Briana & I repeat that the order is under Crystal. She states, ""We have no order for Crystal."" 

I pulled out my emailed confirmation with confirmation number & location. I try to show her & she repeats that they have no order for me. I tell her again that I have a confirmation of my order & she glances at the order, looks at a screen and repeats again there is no order. A woman next to her chimes in, ""Maybe it's a different location."" With my confirmation in hand I show it is for the Centennial location I am standing inside of. The black woman checks her screen again, ""I have no order for you."" 

I wait there in silence waiting for her to assist me in the situation because something had obviously gone wrong with me order and she simply turns away. I speak up and say, ""Is it too late to place my order because I've been waiting?"" Her response, ""No. What did you want?"" Instead of showing her the confirmation she obviously had no intention of actually looking at I read it off to her. She charges me the amount. I ask how long and she states 15-20 mins. I tell her I will go in my car because my husband and child are waiting for me & she says, ""You need to wait inside because we're locking our doors."" I said I need to at least tell my husband what is going on & her response is 'fine'. 

Her service is absolutely INEXCUSABLE! I have dealt with her previously with a To-Go order and she wasn't pleasant before either. This time with a mistake not being of my own I should be shown a resolution to the situation, her trying to keep my business & make a sale that I had confirmation that I made & show an ounce of kindness. I hope her management team sees this. I hope other Yelpers see this & choose to forgo this location. My family & I will take our business elsewhere.

The fiance and I decided to go with the 2 for $20.

So soup or salad and breadsticks to start. He got the chicken gnocchi soup which was kinda like chicken and dumplings. It was alright, but wouldn't get that again. Salad is always just as you expect as well as the breadsticks.

Each person gets a entree. Spaghetti with Italian Sausage. They give you 4 full sausages so they werent skimpy with that. The sauce was just meh but what bothers me is when you give someone noodles that had some pieces dried out from sitting. Shrimp mezzaluna - this was just alright. I didn't like the pre cooked shrimp but the ravioli was fine. 

We get a dessert to share and got a black tie chocolate cake which was decent enough, like buying cheesecake from Costco. 

Generally speaking I feel their staff tends to be friendly, sometimes overly. They hire the ""jazz hands"" types, but I far rather have someone really zippy than being served by someone who looks so disinterested. Our gal was that Glee club upbeat, but was also on point with taking care of our needs. 

Best part of the meal? Salad, breadsticks and peach ice tea. I think maybe I should really just come for that if I'm feeling a bit nostalgic. 

Olive Garden isn't horrible unedible food, but it isn't by any stretch great. I feel like it was definitely better years ago, and better at locations that's been operating for a long time like the one my gramps went to.  I noticed the prices without the meal deal and they are higher now. $15 for pasta gets you handmade pasta, handmade sauce at a local place vs something a bit more generic. It's the age old question of what you value in food- quality or quantity? You'll have plenty of left overs here. Stick to the special 2fers, bottomless pasta, lunch time specials to at least get it at a price closer to what it's worth.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,1,3,-usolkJWyYRwHqy0DfsJLg

Sometimes your buzzer doesn't even go off when it's supposed to, and they alternate between using buzzers and calling names at the same time. It gets confusing and infuriating. Just pick one way to let people in. 

As for table server, it really depends on the person that you receive because I've had really bad service from older servers and good service from a younger, Asian guy which I can't remember his name! He was really great and even gave my friend a different thing to try when she was unsatisfied with her food.

I got the fettuccine Alfredo with the NEPB. It was horrible. It didn't taste creamy like it usually does, it tasted like butter. No good. Now, since we came for a birthday I told our server and asked if she could sing happy birthday. She then asked what dessert did we want to purchase so they could sing. I was speechless...it's her birthday so we let her pick. At the Cheyenne location they NEVER charged us for a birthday dessert. This one did. It's unfortunate since this is closer to us. We would rather drive a little farther to get better service and better tasting food. Thanks Olive Garden, thanks.",0N4Pu81o_EsB-GHw0mLUCw,1,0,2,B7uUzX3kdLExlCb37X8ZFg

5157210,2018-03-09,2,XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q,"On the evening of March 8, 2018, I purchased a to go order from the Olive Garden in Centennial Hills.  My order was simple.  Chicken Alfredo, Pasta Fagioli, and an order of the Alfredo dipping sauce. My total ended up being $21.95. 

In the notes; I asked that the restaurant please provide extra packets of parmesan cheese, and plenty of breadsticks.  

When I got the order, I only got one packet of parmesan cheese.  Okay, not a big deal.  That, I can live with. To my surprise however, the nearly $4.00 dipping sauce I ordered was, literally, about a spoonful.  Probably enough to dip a breadstick in twice.  At first, I thought maybe some spilled in the bottom of the bag.  But no... this wasn't an accident. 

When I called to speak to the manager, ""Michael Jefferson,"" I simply asked, ""What is the typical amount of dipping sauce a customer receives per order?""  He laughed, as if my situation was amusing to him, and said ""we don't fill up the cups"".  Again, I asked for the precise measurement or protocol for the dipping sauce, and again, he laughed.

Finally, after much back and forth, he shared with me that the typical amount is actually 4 ounces.   So, I measured what I was given, and to my surprise, it was only 2 ounces.  Hardly 1/3 of a cup.  

So, call me petty for being upset; however, what is so displeasing about this situation was the managers attitude.  He did not care, and in fact, found it amusing that I was complaining about being shorted.  I eat at Olive Garden often.  Sometimes, once a week, and I always order the same thing.  I am very familiar with the typical proportion, and this was far off. 

No remedy was offered, no concern was given, and instead of just offering to fix the issue, Michael chose to argue with me; literally, raising his voice over the phone.  

Shame on you for treating your customers like that, Mr. Jefferson!

As promised, I will continue to share this experience with the community, as well as Olive Garden's corporate offices and the BBB.",oLD4rqCTktzxjXdKTR9IIA,0,0,1,Cgv4VXkXB07pZbWC5j-wpA

Those $6.99 AYCE soup, salad, and bread sticks were perfect for a high school kid's budget! More importantly, Olive Garden's vegetarian minestrone soup fit my newbie diet. To this day, I'll still go back to OG for the lunch special, especially when I get emailed a coupon to enjoy it for only $5 (fan club perks)! Bread sticks and even the soup can be hit or miss, but for a $5 AYCE, I'll take it.

The location in Centennial is my go-to OG. Service is usually above average. Food wise, OG is on par with any other major American restaurant chain. Entrees are pretty mediocre, so I stick with my usual.     
 
PRO TIP: Olive Garden gives Veterans a free entree from a selected menu and dependents get 10% of their meals too on Veterans Day. 

Worth a Return Visit?
Only for lunch! Unless I'm dragged here on a couple date. Which happens more than you'd think. Hmph.

This is a rough review being that OG's (Olive Garden) is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas. 

Now, first things first our server, Chevon, did a great job!
The A/C must have been on 65-70 degrees not such a bad thing If the food is coming on time, with that being said we're a big family of 6 so I understand why the food could have taken a while and it was a Saturday busy nite.

Our waitress Chevon, was very patient with us we could tell she was very busy so after we placed our first order of lasagna fritta and calamari about 10 min passed still no food.

Side note! We notified her we wanted to take a time gap to ensure our apps wouldn't arrive with our meal!! Making the 10 mins fine... but with no food! No bueno! 

Our server returned to take our dinner order (still no food), we ordered chicken and shrimp carbonara, wife got the same but with grilled chicken, the kids got pizza and fries, kids ravioli, spaghetti with meat sauce and soup and salad for appetizers.

Sadly, still no food! 15 min more or less we finally received the soup and salad still waiting on the 1st order of fritta and calamari. 

Starting to feel the chill about 20+ minutes in, the fritta and calamari shows up, sadly the fritta had to go back it was a lil over cooked but the calamari was good! 

We're now approaching FREEZING LEVELS and are about to cancel our orders! The watered down peach tea( so disappointing ... usually a family favorite!) was not helping and finally 40+ min after placing our first order our food finally shows up.

The food was good but the wait sucked by far one of my worst experiences in OG's I'm sure it was because of the weekend rush but unfortunately it's why I gave 3 stars and that's all thanks to our server, Chevon!",rTuxNHmaxiG-29uKgPRzZg,1,0,3,KA1jFZTy77Mj6pYuQNYR_Q

Exactly 6 minutes into dinner the salad came, with more plates, no room. When the salad plates were delivered they were obviously right out  of the dishwasher, not warm hot! My plate had dried sauce and when asked for another plate the waiter tried to wipe it off and actually ASKED ME if it was ok? No, I don't want someone's leftovers on my hot plate for salad. So to top it off and after having to ask twice the breadsticks came as everyone was just about finished with dinner. It is obvious the branch is very poorly run by management and staff. Not only will I never return after 20 years we may never return to another Olive Garden again. Probably one of the worse dinners ever! If I could give zero stars for this engagement. SAD for a chain this size!",RIqF5RnBAzetCmyAXbVZiA,0,0,1,27yg_MtIRtk-d988D0ZyOg

I had the cucina mia white wine and garlic over angel hair.  The sauce was much thicker and cheesier than the other location I normally eat at - not to my taste.  Had the sicilian cheesecake with strawberry, good but still quite frozen.  Also appreciated the warning about paying for the games.",cZ-vsWKuKZFpM_FjfY0yzQ,0,0,3,Jc2R1ZBreWuKJ-uYNOJwhw

My mom and I split the seafood giant manicotti since we weren't too hungry, and despite sharing, were still able to get our own soups. We ordered the potato soup which was a creamy soup with potatoes, kale, and imitation crab. Never thought of putting kale in my soup before, but this soup was a pleasant first. Going back to our order of the seafood giant manicotti, it was a not-bad meal. Be warned though, they will ask if you want cheese on top of your dish, and if you love cheese but don't love love it, put only a small layer since the pasta is stuffed with rich, creamy cheese. The sauce was also quite creamy so it was a little overwhelming. 

The waiter was really nice, though, and was quick to get our orders and constantly checked up on us. He convinced my mom to order their mango martini, which was so good, you couldn't taste any alcohol in it (how my mom and I like our drinks). Good Olive Garden location!",J3ykuVkcYsttcksT_fIbpw,1,0,3,gCNtiCPV1jRu0ettcG4sHQ
