264841,2010-07-19,1,5tl4tyaJEzGeAdbi_L7PzQ,"On my way to the swap meet noticed this white trailer on the side of the road , so stopped to try. It was not sexy looking so didn't have high expectations form the start. Walked up to take a look at the menu (which was all in Spanish)to see what they had to offer. 
(what always worries me about these food trucks is that have such large menus and such small space, makes me wonder where there food is REALLY stored at night, ya know!)
non the less I was prepared to try it anyways. The tacos were only $1 so we got pastor, cabeza , lengua an asada burrito and 2 drinks. Our total came to $10.00 not to bad! After placing our order I noticed that there were a bunch of half chickens stilling on the grill , kind wish i ordered that instead of the burrito.
Ate the tacos first, the meat was tender and it came with onion and cilantro on it, didn't need much more as it was gone in 3 bites as any street taco would be(good thing they are only a $1) 
The burrito had pinto beans and rice,very mushy, reminded me of pork and beans out of a can, large in size as it came with a good amt of meat, however dry, so needless to say that it had to be eaten with the red sauce that came with. Over all it was a very clean new looking trailer, the food was what could be expected from a Mexican food truck! If i pass by I will stop again however I wouldn't go out of my way as it wasn't in the best part of town. All in all it was a fun place to discover .....

779544,2017-05-02,0,5tl4tyaJEzGeAdbi_L7PzQ,"tldr ""best asada tacos in town, try the horchata""

This is a cozy Latin polleria. Don't ask the place to be more than what it is, but it's a really good one in its kind. 

The place is clean, so if you need to eat there dont be afraid, the tv's with news and telenovelas in Spanish will keep you entertained. 

The best way to go here is to order the asada tacos -the bests you can get around in this town- meat without fat, tasty tortilla, so good you don't even need to add sauce to them. 

The agua frescas and the horchata (I liked it even when I don't usually like horchata at all) are super tasty and fresh, not too sweat not too heavy, just perfect to refresh you. 

The attention is fast and the lady on the counter is friendly.

So overall, this place is a Latin gem in the neighborhood, you should stop by.",AazhUeNfugYqT0RART_gKg,0,0,5,UsKpahH-GTqi_v0p7V4x7A

I was very impressed with the food and price point. I mean, I am not into all that flash and fruo fruo looks. I look at the food. The quality of the meat was on par! They also provided pickled carrots and radishes and good salsa. This place can really compete with other taco trucks and beat'em hands down, I tell you. 

This is how good they are, there were these ghetto fabulous Mexicans from Cali with their gold chains and rings talking good ole' Mexican Spanish and ordering 30 tacos de carne asada to go! I mean you gotta love that! 

Oh and by the way, its near the Excellent Bar- Herb & Rye, so this makes for a great pit stop before or after you hit the bar.

Stopped here the other night with some of the Yelp-izzles after Herbs & Rye. It was Jade W, Elnino F, Eleazar A, and I. We couldn't decide on where to go so Eleazar suggested El Pollo Mobile.

None of of has been here before, but we were all happy with Eleazar's pick!

I got 1 pollo taco and 1 carne asada taco. They were only $1 each. There is a bowl of guacamole by the veggies and I put a scoop on each of my tacos. I also ate some of the carrots after I had finished my tacos.

1700000,2015-07-17,0,5tl4tyaJEzGeAdbi_L7PzQ,"Today, I go for a burrito. I was told that the chicken would be done in 10-15mins. The NEW cashier attempted to force me to get another meat. I kindly informed him that I dont eat beef or pork. So I waited 30mins, just for the NEW cashier to tell me that there isn't any chicken. Mind you, it's 1pm. Not only that, SEVERAL people ordered AFTER me and where given chicken within a couple of minutes. Also, the cook brought in at least 15 freshly cooked whole chickens from outside as I waited.. So once again, the NEW cashier attempts to make me take another type of meat. I refused once again and nicely asked for a refund. He walks away tallying to other workers as I wait to be reimbursed. Another 10 mins goes by as I wait for my damn money. By far the worst experience I've ever had there. 

There was one instance where I ordered chicken (instead of asada) fries and the cashier handed me a half portion container. I order these fries at least twice a week and this guy swears they've always been this size. My buddy went 3 days ago and got the original larger portion with no issue. I was skeptical after that visit but gave them the benefit of the doubt. After today's visit I will no longer go back. Great food doesn't make up for s****y service.

3826068,2016-10-12,0,5tl4tyaJEzGeAdbi_L7PzQ,"I was on the hunt for some really good street tacos that was of reasonable price. Stumbled upon this place after passing by a so-called taco truck up the street that didn't seem to be open. 
I've always passed this place and it never occurred to me that it was a Mexican restaurant. The giant yellow hat on the roof of the restaurant I guess wasn't very obvious to me.

The cashier seemed to be teaching a little girl, probably 7 years old the register and how to go do certain things. The cashier was ok, figured she'd be more nice when I asked her what huerachas was. She didn't give a very good description and that's why I opted for tortas since I knew what that was already. I ordered some carne asada tacos too. The best part is they're only a $1! The size ain't bad and I figured with the amount I'm paying anyway that would be the equivalent to just one taco elsewhere. 

To me the tacos were delicious! I actually came back two days in a row after to get some more. The tacos aren't packed with meat but there's enough inside for each. I tried their pork tacos the second day and they weren't bad either but the carne asada to me are better! Their salsas are great!! I really like the red salsas and especially the chunky one. Very, very good & spicy! And there's just something about the onions, carrots and pepper mixture. I cannot stop eating those onions! It's just so delicious to me I don't get it. 

The third day, I had my boyfriend drive me there. I just wanted tacos again but he ended up ordering a whole chicken and it was only $10! It came with rice, beans and tortillas. It reminds me of el pollo loco but different. Their chicken seems to be more of a BBQ/off the grill taste with a bit of spiciness. El pollo loco is more sweet. Overall, very good chicken! 

I will be back! This just might be my new taco spot. 

I just need to find out what time they close. I don't recall seeing a time on their door or menus. 

Took a star off because the service could be a tad better. They don't really greet you or say much when you're about to order. Also, I think it would be nice if they had a menu of the types of meats they have in their tacos or food in general. Chicken, pork, carne asada, etc.. not sure if they have tripe or tongue or anything else for that matter. Maybe I would have to ask next time.

We left Vegas on our way to the Valley of Fire, with our ""tour guide"" my brother who has lived in Vegas for 3o years when he asks if we want tacos.  The truck is  on the right (coming from Vegas) next to  the landfill. Just before the landfill on the right if your lucky and its daytime you will see a vehicle that makes the most amazing tacos. I didn't try the burritos but the chicken tacos are great. they are small so order a few., The bulk of their business are truck drivers who like the food so much they call ahead!! 
so if you see a truck parked there with a picnic table outside, you are in luck. Get the chicken ones, you wont' be disappointed!!",9ZmuiqO2bqKrQdIA8XP2pw,0,0,5,JZ5RYDDcQouIg_DpxkE80w

However, my burrito had some type of guacamole & last time I checked guacamole has avocado. She asked if I wanted onions & cilantro, I said no, still got it in my burrito. With what little chicken that was in there, came with pieces of bone. Don't know how the hell this place got 4.5 stars.",O1eBb6RBJIGzhts6IoxCLw,1,0,1,pYDUGnao6quGymQ61zo8gQ

5048537,2010-09-09,3,5tl4tyaJEzGeAdbi_L7PzQ,"So after Herbs and Rye some of the Yelperazzi wanted to cap it off with tacos. There's so much of them here we could have done a taco crawl, but Elizar noticed a little taco hutch parked by the McDonalds that had a line going steady. Me, Elnino F, Andy T. and Elizar get tacos.

Definitely the crowd isn't the food truck culture crowd, it was straight up all Mexican. Good to me to see a crowd of people eating food from their culture. 

The tacos were $1 so I got 2 lengua/tongue and 1 pastor/marinated pork and I got a $1 canned soda (crush or coke). Not bad for $1 tacos! My lengua was soft and flavorful. The pastor was good, but I tend to like when it goes more the savory route and this had a slightly sweeter marinate to it. 

I would say it's not for the people who are germ freaks because the salsas are just sitting outside in containers. I say, I have eaten at 3rd world countries some pretty scary stuff and I'm still alive so I really don't get weirded out by little grubby taco stands.

Not quite sure if it's always there, but I think it is. They're open all day 12-12.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,3,4,4lg0rUayYOsKTgcFJLKjBA

I wanted to try the BBQ chicken put was told it wasn't  ready for at least 30 minutes. No sorry, just that's the way it is type of attitude.
