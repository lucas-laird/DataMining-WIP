Originally at Wynn, Daniel Boulud has opened up his restaurant in Vegas again just a few years ago, this time at The Venetian. We were originally deciding between dinner and brunch here at DB Brasserie because they have a great bottomless brunch menu where you get bottomless mimosa's and beeline's for $20! In the end, hubby and I visited the restaurant on our last night for dinner in Las Vegas and left pleasantly satisfied a few hours later.

We reserved our table through Opentable last minute and were happy that we were able to grab a quick reservation. When we arrived, the restaurant was almost full, but we were immediately seated at one of their comfortable booths. Our waiter came by our table with menus right after we were seated and filled our glasses with water.

We ordered:
Appetizer: Crispy Thai Calamari
Main Entr√©es: Short Rib Orecchiette & Seared Sea Scallops
Dessert: Strawberry Profiterole

After we ordered, we were given two types of bread: the regular house bread with butter and special bread for us to try on the house.

Our appetizer arrived shortly after enjoying our house bread, and we were surprised at how crispy and fluffy the calamari was! The batter was very light and full of air, making it extra crispy. It was the most crispy calamari we had ever tasted so far, and it seemed to be because of the beer in the batter! The dish was served with spicy mayo at the very bottom of the dish which did a great job at keeping the calamari balanced in terms of flavour. The cilantro and the pickled peppers also brought a nice kick into our palates as well. We would recommend ordering this appetizer because it's a dish that would satisfy many people at the dinner table!

My scallops were cooked perfectly! I loved its texture and how it went well together with the mushroom sabayon. The rich creaminess of the sauce wasn't my favourite choice of sauce, but hubby loved my dish! I loved how the vegetables were cooked, but I thought plating could be a little prettier. Aside from all the personal taste, I would definitely recommend you the seared scallops because they're superb! It's a well thought out dish with various textures and flavours that will satisfy you.

I liked hubby's dish, the orecchiette (the least French dish on the menu!), better than mine that day even though I loved the scallops. I just wasn't feeling the French cuisine that day, I suppose. The rich bolognese sauce of the orecchiette won me over more than the scallops, and it was really delicious! If you're like me and not feeling the French cuisine, try the orecchiette.

My waiter was happy (and relieved?) to find that I found my dessert much more satisfying than the scallops. Though he provided me with recommendations, I opted for the strawberry profiteroles because they are one of my favourite desserts. In addition, they had strawberry gelato, something I hadn't enjoyed in months! Topped with the chocolate sauce on top, I loved it so much that I would've gotten seconds if hubby hadn't stopped me. The chantilly was also very delicious as it wasn't too over powering and in fact, very balanced with the chocolate. 

As my waiter put it, I finished off on a strong note with my delicious dessert! Hubby and I left DB Brasserie very satisfied with our dinner and went off to enjoy a long walk on The Strip. If you haven't tried any of Daniel Boulud's cuisine or looking for a restaurant with great food and atmosphere, try DB Brasserie! I guarantee you will enjoy your time there.",u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,3,1,4,lDqe4KomvI6WXthbh_4bIA

I would normally rate this perhaps 3 stars, but being a Daniel Boulud rrestaurant, i expect more.

Food -
To start, I ordered the French Onion soup, which to me, lacked enough cheese. I like a gooey French onion soup. For my main,I ordered the Frenchie burger because I heard DB is famous for his burgers. However, the burger that i got was more like a salt brick. The patty itself seemed that it was way over-salted. Plus they added the ""morbier cheese confit pork belly"" which sounds delicious on paper but just added to the saltiness. The burger was so salty, i finished 4 glasses of water and only finished half of the burger. In hindsight, I should have sent the burger back, especially paying $19 for a burger, it should be perfect. Also, I do understand the restaurant just opened, so it could be a learning lesson for the kitchen as well. My friend ordered the lingini and loved it. My other friend order the Yankee burger and loved it as well. So take my words with a grain of....salt. ha.

Service -
When our party arrived we were seated immediately in a very nice booth. The restaurant does look like French bistro/brasserie, upscale yet casual. Upon being seated, we waited about 5+ minutes until we received our menus, which I thought was odd. Not sure why the hostess doesn't just hand out the menus (seems inefficient to me). The waitress was very nice and welcoming but seemed very busy. There were a lot of manager looking people standing around. Not sure what they were doing but felt the service could have been more efficient. But again, having recently opened, I'm sure this will be worked out.

Overall, I'm not sure I would recommend this restaurant, especially with all the awesome dining choices you have in Vegas. However, if the food was better (perhaps the kickhen wasn't tasting the food?) and the service kinks were worked out, I do think this could be a good restaurant, especially for the value. If my friends rated this restaurant, they would probably rate it a 4 or 5 stars. However, based on the experience I had, I could not give it more than a 2 and a half,  or 3.",ugWTlpB2H8bP9iPD3d-qcA,1,1,2,Os4wRi-IVYqVW7RmzxgpDA

The omelette tasted very exceptional, we can taste the herb and the creme fraiche so it wasn't just eggy tasting. The potato was awesome too. The Yankee burger came with 3 sauces and fries. The fries was done well, the sauces included ketchup, djon mustard and horseradish mayo. I like the horseradish mayo a lot with the burger. The beef patty was made fresh in house. The bread was fresh too (though I don't know if they make their own). Everything tasted exceptional. The service was good as well.

The lighting is too dim bordering on gloomy. As for food, the bread was pedestrian, now granted I am spoiled by bread at places like Bouley, NY but we expected better at a Daniel Boulud place. The duck confit was ok, we have had better at many other places including some chain cafes in London - Cafe Rouge comes to mind. And the appetizers while good were not particularly impressive either. The one saving grace was the service, our waiter very helpful in pairing the wines for each course. We were going to watch O after dinner and the waitstaff were very attentive and made sure we were out by our target time.

I was in the mood for chicken and wanted to eat at a nice restaurant to ensure the meal would be a good one.  Instead of going to the Barnyard which is located next to the DB Brasserie, I opted for the reputation of DB and having dinner there.  The staff was extremely nice.  Unfortunately, my chicken was so undercooked that you could see blood on the joint between the breast and the wing.  The staff apologized and took the meal back to the kitchen.  At this point my husband was eating his dinner and a gentlemen, who could piece of chicken.  I said that this would likely take at least 1/2 hour and my husband would be finished with his dinner.  The waiter said that it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes.  Of course 1/2 later my chicken arrived, again the chicken was undercooked although not as rare as the first order.  Although in the end I was not charged for the chicken, the meal nor the experience was what I was looking forward to and expecting from a Daniel Boulud restaurant.  My husband finished well before my dinner arrived, he then waited for me to finish my dinner and we just left. Very disappointing!",Tq2jq98O2FQIJq52YQv6PA,0,0,1,9V_m2F79boowMs9EFQjQ3w

The first time we ate there, I had a perfectly cooked, MEDIUM RARE hamburger served on a buttery, delicate brioche roll. It melted in my mouth. It was perfection. I've looked forward to ordering one every year. Today, my $20 hamburger was WELL DONE and served on a bun more like something you'd get at a fast food chain. When our waiter asked us how everything was, and I told him my hamburger was way over cooked, he nonchalantly referred to their new chef who did things differently.  (He did offer to cook me another one, but we were with friends who I'd bragged about this place to, and I didn't want to hold everyone up.)  Our friends felt that their hamburgers weren't special at all - better than being hungry.  I would definitely not recommend eating here.

Started off with several appetizers for the table - delicious crispy and NOT greasy calamari, crab and avocado dish, and really good burrata cheese.  Also had some excellent bread.  My guests all ordered the steaks (different cuts) - one was a little too cooked but he did not send it back (ordered it med rare and it came out medium).  They all added the lobster ""upgrade"" (think that it was $16 more each plate).  I had a tasty halibut.  It was poached and it was completely white, looked like cheese it was so pure a white.  We each ordered dessert - 2 got delicious scoops of gelato ($3/scoop), I got the Gateau Basque (a lemony tart with cr√®me anglaise),  another ordered the black and white fondant (it was a chocolate bomb dessert - delicious but SUPER rich), and finally the President.  We shared.  The President is not suitable for sharing - too difficult to split up.  The tart was my favorite - and also a big favorite of the table.  The sizes of the dessert are just right - not huge.  Wine list has some reasonable selections.  I returned the following night for late night drinks in the bar and got the same terrific service.  Had 3 specialty coffees, a ~$70 bottle of wine, 2 cocktails, and the bill for 5 with a 20% tip was just under $600.

382604,2014-11-19,0,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"My boyfriend is a fan of the chef's restaurant in London so we wanted to try this out for our next visit to Vegas. The atmosphere is good, the food was quite amazing and the drinks were inventive. Why am I only giving this 3 stars? Our waiter left a lot to be desired.

The bottom line for me is, if you are charging over $40-50 an entree, I expect the service to be great. It can really make or break a dining experience. I don't really care what the excuse is- I want a good service experience if I am paying so much! I can be slightly understanding if it is clear the waiter is swamped, etc. And in the least please at least communicate with us why things are taking so long/why you are not so attentive- that can help us understand quite a bit. However the restaurant was not that busy and seemed plenty staffed. The table next to us had a completely different waiter (who seemed much better). I think our waiter just wasn't very good. He didn't even tell us about specials- which we overheard the next door waiter going into detail for his table. We had to ask if they had a fixed menu (which we wound up declining to order from after having to wait for that to be produced).

He took forever to bring us menus, then left us waiting there forever. Every time we had a random question he would wander off for a while and help others and then we would have to flag him to come back. It took forever to even get a cocktail order in. It is a problem when you are worried about what you ordered ever arriving (like I did with my wine I wanted with my entree which I did get luckily) -and having that be in the back of your mind while trying to enjoy your meal. Or even having to worry about getting your waiter to pay attention to you long enough to order something you want. My boyfriend ordered a gin and tonic for his main course and it never came (unlucky for him), so by the time he finished he called the waiter over and the waiter said ""oh it will be right out"" and my boyfriend said ""well I am done now. I don't want it anymore"" and took coffee instead. 

Also smaller thing but we ordered a bottle of sparkling water with someone pouring for us, and when he was in the middle of pouring our water he asked if we wanted an extra bottle since we were near the end and we said yes, then he just walked off with our ""old"" bottle that still had maybe half-3/4 a glass left! 

It was a shame because once again the food was wonderful- but this kind of sullied my experience. Perhaps we will try it again and hope for a better waiter, but with a laundry list of restaurants to try on the strip.... not so sure.",nSkfeG0zuC_8cker0KDDEQ,0,0,3,IzTUP0Y8aKWb-lE9z0YDYw

I never got around to eating at Daniel Boulud's brasserie at the Wynn before it closed so I was excited to try his new restaurant at the Venetian.  It is an inviting open restaurant with a large bar area and dark wood furnishings all around.  

We arrived before our other guests and sat down for a pre-dinner drink at the bar.  We had boulevardier ($17) and a maitresse ($13).  The brasserie's version of the boulevardier is a mixture of Bulleit rye whiskey instead of bourbon, Aperol instead of Campari and sweet vermouth with a slice of orange rind.  It was a really good pour with no ice to mask the taste and the heavy cut crystal glass it was served in was a nice touch.  The maitresse, served in a martini glass, was a sweet concoction of rum, lime and coconut liqueur that perhaps would make a good drink if you were sitting by the pool but it didn't work well before dinner.

When the rest of the group arrived, we started with the Terrine of foie gras ($24), burrata ($14), and the crab timbale ($20).  All three tasted ok but the delicate crab flavor was overwhelmed by the taste of the overlying fruit and the foie gras terrine didn't have the punch or flavor of the seared version that you could get upstairs at Bouchon.

For dinner we has the Tunisian lamb with merguez sausage ($45), the sea scallops ($29), the oven roasted halibut ($40) and the swordfish ($42).  The scallops had a good sear on them and were served on a bed of sweet corn and shitake mushrooms.  They were delicious. The halibut was also cooked just right and was moist and flavorful. On the other hand, the swordfish was on the dry side and kind of bland.  Perhaps they had two different chefs cooking the fish that night?  The lamb and spicy sausage tasted fine on its own but seemed heavy in comparison to the first two seafood dishes.

For desert, the standout of the night was the grand marnier souffl√© with vanilla anglaise sauce ($15). I don't know how he got it to be so light and airy or how it came out so fast but it was one of the best I have ever had. Roy Yamaguchi could learn a thing or two about cooking souffl√©'s from this place. We also split the pistachio-cherry Sunday ($14). This tasted great while you were eating the overlying flavorful pistachio ice cream but it lost its charm when you got down to the sour cherry ice cream underneath.

Overall, it was a good dining experience. The place was kind of empty for dinner time on a Saturday night but perhaps that is because it is still new. I also notice with trepidation that some of the dish prices at the restaurant are already a dollar or two higher than what is advertised on the online menu. As it is still kind of early to be raising prices, I hope it doesn't mean the new restaurant is already in trouble.  I would recommend it and I know I would go back, especially for more souffl√©.",fzGcwCzSOv_1rLRg89BvRg,1,0,4,DkktvBrXh8Q3fhmgcOA9GA

531054,2014-07-04,1,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"My dining experience here was so much better than I expected. With the glut of celebrity chef restos that phone it in and print money luring in the Food Network convention demographic, I was expecting a ""nice"" dinner at inflated prices. I was meeting someone during the one hour dinner break in a poker tournament and DB was very close by to the poker room. Decided it would be nice to take advantage of the better dining options at the Venetian since the Rio is sorely lacking in that area.

Our hostess was very courteous when we asked if they had a table for two available although were a walk in (although I didn't show up with a huffy and entitled shitty attitude, so that probably helped too, take note Yelpers...) and we were offered a vacant table right away.

We were waited on promptly and told our waitress we had a time constraint. That mostly worked well although we had to wave her down when it was time to head out, but at that point quite a few more diners had arrived and the bill was still settled in time. 

I chose a glass of wine from a list that looked thoughtful and well-curated. It was an exceedingly rare occasion to have an available selection of quality wines offered by the glass. 

Our starters were the burrata and the escargots spaetzle. The latter was an exceptional combination of flavors and textures. Mains were the halibut and Tunisian lamb. Perfectly seasoned and cooked with an elegant but simple presentation. 

I would go so far as to say this definitely exceeds Bouchon for a few reasons: service is better overall, ambiance more intimate (Bouchon can get deafeningly loud with a crowd in there), cocktails and wine list appear better and the food is much better overall. Not much ""simple"" French bistro fare at DB but most dishes feature Boloud's signature Med touches yet remain unfussy, despite the lengthy menu descriptions for some.

I would compare our dinner to courses I've had at a few one-star Michelin restaurants even. I highly recommend a visit here if you're staying at the Venetian, and even if you're not it's worth coming from another hotel to dine here.

It took 15 minutes from the time we were seated before our server came to greet us and provide menus to us.  After about 10 minutes, we had to ask for menus which then came 5 minutes later.  No apology from the server was given for the wait, and the restaurant wasn't even busy in my opinion.  There were a fair amount of empty tables around.  In addition, when we sat down our party had two dirty napkins at the table that we needed to have replaced and when the server took our order, she forgot a person in our party.  She was about to walk away and then we had to speak up and let her know she didn't get his order.  In addition, my friend ordered a soda while the rest of our party ordered cocktails.  We all got our cocktails in a normal amount of time.  His soda took FOREVER.  We were all so annoyed at this point we were ready to just cancel the soda.  Soda should not take longer than cocktails to come out. Any of those things alone may not have been a notable issue, but all of them combined definitely left us feeling irritated.  

As for the food, it was decent.   I had some of the charcuterie plate and cheese plate our group ordered and then the French Onion Soup and Brussels Sprouts on the side. I also tried the short rib pasta dish my other friend had.  Nothing to write home about, just average.  To be fair, I was a little put off with the service by the time the food arrived that I didn't give the food much thought.  Nothing was going to save my experience.  I should say though that my friend had the duck and he inhaled it, which he told me turned out really well.",w5EHN4imZEULErcNq53mGg,2,0,2,CTCzXVSeGUDy44vba1BBCw

611468,2016-08-16,2,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"Hello,

Our dining experience tonight was nothing short of embarrassing. I made a reservation for a party of 7. One person, my boss, was a vegetarian.

We sat. My boss asked about veg options. Our server told him/us this wasn't a place for vegetarians. I scoffed, thinking that he was joking, he was not. 

After we realized he wasn't kidding and my boss (visibly upset after a few minutes of discussion), I went to a manager. The manager told me that the server would provide me with options and I should sit back down. I explained that the server had come by and explained there were no options. He said he'd speak with the chef.

We went back...ordered wine...no server came...no options came...nothing happened. My boss left. Mind you, on the menu were pastas, vegetables, grains, cheeses, potatoes...OPTIONS. Nothing was ever presented. 

I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed for myself making a reservation with a large party, one being a vegetarian. I'm embarrassed for Daniel Boulud, who I believe would be appalled that his name was on this establishment and lastly, I'm embarrassed for you. I've personally managed restaurants and my fiance has been a chef for 20+ years. To know that this situation could have been rectified EASILY by management and was never once touched is embarrassing. I will never be back. I will never recommend. Good luck.",TUvAFqUgz_rXo6RkWMvDGQ,1,0,1,O_Q-vV7k7hwhf-0jc6UbGA

We had the lox sandwich, the ham quiche lorraine, and took advantage of their weekend bottomless mimosas. I have to say the best part of this brunch was the mimosas, because the food tasted bland. The sandwich had too much smoked salmon and was overpowering the rest of the flavors, I barely tasted the avocado. The fries that accompanied the sandwich tasted burnt. The quiche lorraine was very basic and could have been store-bought for all we know. 

At the time of our visit, the weekend brunch bottomless drinks were 20$ per person, you got to choose between raspberry bellini, orange mimosas, or bloody mary. Once you've made your choice your waiter will bring about 1L of the freshly made drink and leave it in an ice bucket next to your table.

Waited another 12 minutes or so before our waiter appeared.  Never introduced himself.  Took our order and departed.  Our salads arrived and was fairly tasty.  As we were eating our salad I looked up and saw a food runner about 20 feet away with our entrees.  He saw that we were still working on our salads.  I made eye contact with him and I could actually hear him say, ""oh, they're still eating their salads.""  He turned around with our food and went back to the kitchen.
About 10 minutes later our waiter appears with the entrees.  But we are still working on our salads.  He ordered the entrees to be prepared way too early.  He placed them on our table and walked away.  My wife and I look at each other, dumbfounded.  Now we are forced to switch to the entrees before they get cold.  I ordered a filet and fries.  My wife ordered a flat iron steak with shrimp.  Both were HEAVILY seasoned with pepper.  Even the shrimp.  Not only were they over seasoned, but he got the order wrong.  I ordered a filet and he gave me a flat iron steak as well.
He never once returned to our table to see how was our meal.
Note:  the restaurant was at best 1/4 full.  Tons of open tables.  They were definitely not overwhelmed with a busy night.
The waiter was obviously not interested in us.  I watched him.  He spent more time talking with the female hostess than dealing with the patrons.
The food runners collected our plates and voila, the waiter finally re-appeared.  He offered dessert.  But we declined.  ""Yeah, I could tell from the get go that you really didn't want dessert!""  That's some statement coming from this waiter.
My wife was going to leave a 10% tip, down from our usual 20%.  I stopped her and told her to leave only 5%.  The food runners were the only ones who were actually doing their job.
My wife wanted to write a bad Yelp review.  I went to the internet and that is when I learned that this restaurant was closing in 2 months.  It made perfect sense.",uddvUUPkUVZyVAKoEyNtlQ,0,0,1,SU4_hQ9pka9JGSOxlnWiyQ

While in a cab to our hotel, I grabbed one of the free booklets in the cab and immediately saw Daniel Boulud's restaurant DB Brasserie.  I immediately went to OpenTable to book a reservation.  I recently finished reading ""Talking With My Mouth Full"" by Gail Simmons where she talks quite a bit about Daniel Boulud so I knew I had to try his food.  When we arrived, I don't think the restaurant was half full.  We were seated at a two person top.  I quickly found that my back was to the restaurant which bummed me out.  I was facing a wall.  Before we were even served our dinner, another couple was seated right next to us.  Really?  The place is half empty and you have to seat another table right next to us?  I thought that was pretty lame.  But we started with bartender's choice mocktails of which mine was pineapple, orange, cranberry juices and my partner's was lavender soda.  They were both good but hers was a bit more unique.  We then tried the Thai style calamari.  It was excellent with a lime sauce and pickled, julienned vegetables.  There were also some fried onions which I didn't think were really needed.  I'd preferred just the calamari rather than what seemed to be a filler for the tender seafood.  My partner got the Duck Confit which was incredible.  It was tender, flavorful meat with a crispy skin on top of swiss chard with saut√©ed onions, crispy onion rings, turnips and a thick, leathery mushroom that my partner didn't like so I ate them.  The dish was awesome.  She was in heaven.  It's not often that you find duck confit for dinner which was a nice treat.  Whenever we see it as an appetizer, we get it so it was such a treat to have it as an entree.

We'd been hiking all day so I was really interested in the pasta dish Linguine De Sud which was lemon linguine with assorted seafood.  When it was set down in front of me, it looked amazing.  It was a reasonable portion of pasta.  I hate when a trough of food is placed in front of me.  I'm more about quality than quantity.  Usually, when there's enough for six people in one dish, they're making up for something which means it's not going to be an incredible dish.  I took the first bite and just loved the feel of the homemade pasta, the smooth, richness of the delicate sauce.  I was in heaven.  Before I could take my next bite, I felt a bit of heat to the dish.  I actually coughed a few times as I wasn't expecting it to attack the back of my throat.  My partner asked if I was ok.  I told her of the heat.  We exchanged bites and I warned her about the heat.  I love spice but she does not.  It completely choked her.  She drank a glass of water and had to wait a bit before resuming eating her dinner.  I didn't mind the heat but did find it a bit overpowering for such a delicate dish.  I really felt that they accidentally dumped too much red pepper in the dish and just didn't feel like remaking it.  I thought about mentioning it to the server but didn't want her to think I was complaining.  I did finish the entire dish but had that pepper catch in my throat several times.  I was almost sweating by the time I finished.  I reread the menu and I wasn't sure it was the same dish.  I was happy none-the-less.  We decided to split a dessert - the Le President which was a chocolate-hazelnut mousse with coffee cream in a chocolate shell.  It was so rich and wonderful that we couldn't even finish it.

But there was no foie gras, no black truffle and no bacon. In essence, I got a dish that tasted like a plain, old meatball.  I asked the server about it and he says that the quail is infused with foie gras and black truffle. I guess it's so infused that you can't taste it or see it.

For a Boulud restaurant is one doesn't quite live up to standards. I've been to others and they were much better. I had a pretty basic french meal consisting of a salad and steak frite. The steak wasn't great, nor were the fries. The salad was okay. The wine selection is excellent, at least I was happy with that.

Mr. Boulud was in the restaurant at the time we dined, I got to meet him which was cool. I expected the meal to be even better than usual with his presence keeping the staff in tip top form, pretty dissapointing.",tXhscxwFTd-ayLTdPx_2yA,2,1,2,FLKtXtfgitz4SXegd6kPcA

For our appetizers, my husband and I each had the fennel three ways (fennel cream with smoked salmon, fennel arancini [stuffed rice balls], and fennel-orange salad). This was my favorite course of the day. Each item was delicious, but the fennel cream was the standout: smooth and rich, with just a hint of the fennel. 

For the entrees, my husband had the short rib tagliatelle, and I had the rainbow trout. A perfect lunch-sized portion of the fish, and it was flavored well, although there wasn't much of a side dish to speak of. And although I usually don't like short ribs, I had a bite of the tagliatelle, and it was great. My husband (a short rib fan) was super impressed; if he could have licked that bowl clean, he probably would have.

The desserts weren't as successful, but we're not really dessert people, so that's OK. I had a trio of melon sorbets, and he had the white raspberry dessert.

We opted for the suggested wine pairings, which were $7 a glass. Ros√© and zinfandel for me; pinot grigio and zinfandel for him. So the whole meal, with tip, was $90. A bit pricey for lunch, but totally worth it. 

Our waiter was a bit of a low talker, and we weren't impressed with the desserts. But everything else about DB Brasserie is top notch. Definitely come for Restaurant Week! And I'm sure it's just as good other times of the year as well...",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,4,2,4,VWFE0YfFmy8x5xueygdRvg

We ordered calamari and the foie gras tourchon both items were fantastic!  Everyone at the table raved about the calamari. They mentioned it was one of the top calamari dishes they've had in the Vegas area and we're Locals! 

My daughter ordered the duck confit and I tried some, it was crispy, juicy and flavorful just how it should be done. If you like Duck Confit, order it here. 

The dish I ordered was the Couq Au Vin, I love CAV and will order it if I can find it. I've eaten it in Paris & other Euro countries on several occasions, so I understand the different interpretation of the dish. DBs interpretation was like France meets Germany with the introduction of the herbed sp√§tzle. I did think it was a nice touch but I did find my dish a bit on the dry side. There wasn't a lot of wine sauce, as what I am used to. The chicken was flavorful but was not fond of the big picture.

     The food was really ALL QUITE excellent as anything with Daniel Boulud's name on it should be.

     Our reservation was early 5:30 on a Wednesday.

Once seated we were greeted by a food runner or busser....the dining room was not busy so I don't know what this was all about~
       We were a party of 4 - 2 men, 2 women.....the men were ALWAYS served first!!! REALLY????? very odd isn't it??  it started with cocktails (men served first) which were tasty however my glass of sparkling wine with raspberries (it didn't have any) & raspberry foam was pretty to look at and as I said was tasty however the sparkling wine must have overflowed as my ENTIRE glass was a sticky, tacky mess. Quite unpleasant~ and our service issues continued as my girlfriends entr√©e came out about 8 minutes AFTER we had our entrees. I will say both floor managers were apologetic which was nice but again, REALLY?? Then lastly the busser would remove or try to remove our plates before we were finished and if thwarted once certainly didn't give up~

It was interesting combination of mushrooms. hazelnut but very few actual escargots.  For the main course I got scallop and my husband got CRISPY DUCK CONFIT. Both were delicious.

1629368,2014-12-28,2,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"DB Brasserie has remained in our bookmark forever, and we finally had the chance to try their brunch today.

Items selected:

- Seafood Linguini (I had small $17 or large $28)
- The Yankee Burger
- Freshly Baked Madeleines

Seafood Linguini was prepared with lemon-saffron pasta, clams, shrimps, bottarga, and arugula. It was possibly the best pasta I've had in Vegas. The sauce was so light that I was able to fully examine the flavor of clams and shrimps, and the shaved bottarga added crunchiness to the texture. It's interestingly similar to Giada's signature spaghetti as both featured lemon and seafood, but I guess I have to call it a draw here.

The Yankee Burger, 7oz beef patty, iceberg, tomato, vidalia onion, sesame bun, pickle, french fries. Of course, no cheese and no bacon. The beef patty was tender and juicy, but the buns didn't soak up the juice as the outer layer of the patty was aptly sealed. For a simple burger like this, execution is everything and DB didn't disappoint.

Finally, as my wife has a health issue lately, we wanted something not cold as the dessert. So we picked Freshly Baked Madeleines, warm miniature lemon cakes - the server let us know that it's sharable for two. Perfect! There we had it with espresso and camomile. And when it came out... we were surprised it was actually a collection of tiny madeleines, warm and soft just out of the oven. It was amazing, and paired well with the camomile.

The billed amount was refreshingly smaller than I'd expect for a fine dining experience... It's going to be a strong pull for us to come back soon.

1741348,2014-09-09,7,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"***Daniel Boulud's db Brasserie is yet another celebrity chef restaurant on The Strip that is overpriced and serves just okay food***

The Las Vegas Strip is full of celebrity chef restaurants.  Most of these restaurants feel and look the same as they did 10 years ago (a lot of them have the same menu items from 10 years ago).  That being said, these celebrity chef restaurants must be doing well because they are still standing today.  The Bellagio is a great example of this.  When is the last time a new restaurant opened there?

I think one of the Venetian's / Palazzo's celebrity chef restaurants did not make it though--the space I think that used to hold French bistro Pinot Brasserie has been replaced with another celebrity chef backed French bistro db Brasserie.  This hotel has several French bistros--Morels and Bouchon in addition to this new entry from New York chef Daniel Boulud.

db Brasserie has a nice look.  It is not cluttered or old-fashioned.  It is a nice and simple room that is contemporary but also elegant with white tablecloth.  db Brasserie is very close to the gaming floor, but it is also next to the pathway that leads to the convention space and other restaurants so it is not too loud.

Like many restaurants at The Venetian and Palazzo, db Brasserie is open for lunch and dinner.  I tried it for lunch.  Their lunch menu is fairly expensive, but they also offer a reasonably priced 3-course lunch pre fixe menu and the short rib tagliatelle entree featured in that 3-course menu looked delicious.

I did not opt for the 3-course option but instead had a starter and one of their pastas in a starter size.  My starter was King crab wrapped in cucumber and garnished with melon.  Overall, it was an okay starter--light and refreshing.  Unfortunately, despite the presence of black garlic and yuzu vinaigrette, the dish was a tad on the bland side.  The King crab was also minced up too much, which was a shame since the crab would have been much more satisfying as well as much more indicative of King crab if the kitchen would have presented the crab in thick chunks.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/db-brasserie-las-vegas-2?select=ykoIxC-DJuEJcjoa3uKT9g#bKR-dezvvN38zq5uc9kJ6g

In addition, while the melon was fine, the melon did not reveal the juiciness or sweetness of melon I've had at California restaurants serving melon in the summer like Ad Hoc in Yountville or Republique in LA.  High quality produce and freshness are where a lot of Vegas restaurants fall short and that was the case here.

My entree was a linguini with lemon, shrimp, clams, bottarga, and arugula.  The pasta was nicely seasoned with a light butter sauce that had a fair amount of heat.  Unfortunately, the linguini was too soft.  None of the shellfish stood out either.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/db-brasserie-las-vegas-2?select=ykoIxC-DJuEJcjoa3uKT9g#TZx2Je0qQuOLHn1xAfIGZQ

I was happy to find out that db Brasserie features a good variety of desserts for both dinner and lunch; there were even some freshly prepared desserts like warm Madeleines.  The Madeleines were very similar to the ones they serve at Daniel.  Daniel's Madelienes were better though because the contrast between a lightly crisp exterior and a soft interior stood out more there; still, the Madeleines here were nicely sweet, warm, soft, and satisfying.

Their profiteroles were stuffed with good caramel-coffee gelato, but the profiterole (choux) pastry was too crisp and meringue like.  The profiteroles were topped with whipped cream and a thin dark chocolate sauce.

The black and white fondant did not unleash the molten chocolate center that was promised, but it was still rich, chocolatey and warm.  The cake came with verbena ice cream on the side.

As mentioned, prices are high, but their 3-course lunch menu allows you to dine here and not spend a ridiculous amount of money.

Service was okay to poor.  On one visit, service was efficient but not very friendly.  On another visit, the food took way too long to come out despite the restaurant not being that busy.

db Brasserie is an okay French bistro, but you would be much better off heading to Bouchon if you are spending a weekend here.  Bouchon is open for weekend brunch though it is not open for a full lunch service on weekdays.  db Brasserie has all the French bistro dishes, but they just do not deliver plates of food with the quality that many would probably expect given that db Brasserie is a Daniel Boulud restaurant.

Everything looked so appetizing and ended up selecting the Crispy Duck Hash. Very French I think. The dish was beautifully presented with the duck meat pieces hidden underneath the watercress salad, and potato squares ( the hash). Let the egg over easy yoke runnith over the hash and duck meat to soften some of the hash. Some pieces could have been cooked a little bit longer. The duck vinegarette enhanced the taste of each bite. I finished every bite til the plate was clean. The plate portion was just perfect for lunch. 

Service was good and water pours were on par. If I come back to Vegas I would definitely try more items on the menu or the pre fixe menu.

1993593,2015-11-02,6,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"Offering HH is an opportunity for restaurants to give customers a glimpse of their menu offerings, and leave them wanting more so that they will stay or return for a full meal. Given all the local hype about ""oyster hour"" (5-6PM, oysters are $1/ea), we started off with that- seating in bar/lounge area is limited and awkward (very low couches/tables or two large tables for 10+?). Service was disinterested, slow, and careless, so we scaled back to just doing HH instead of a full dinner and even with those lessened expectations, food was mediocre.

OYSTERS: Fine, fresh, served with a mignonette and lemon. Ordered by the dozen, tray was plopped on our table without a word. No clue what kind of oysters they were or where they were from.
FRENCHIE BURGER: $15 at HH, and one of the menu items the restaurant has been using in publicity materials. Below average. Meat was not overcooked but dry, toppings were harmonious but very understated, overall flavor of burger was muted to the point of bland. This was incredibly boring and not worth any raves whatsoever.
ARTISAN CHEESE PLATE: Again, dropped off without a word. No clue what kind of cheeses I was eating, one was clearly a bleu variety, another seemed to be an English cheddar, who knows about the third. Accompaniments were a cranberry bread, candied walnuts, grapes, and a fruit chutney that did not remotely go with the bread. Odd assortment but good quality cheeses (thankfully!), the only good point of our visit.

Unfortunately, getting some good cheese at a French restaurant is not enough of a justification for me to stick around and try more of the menu- a quick analysis of other reviews clearly shows a correlation of higher ratings with HH and dinner receiving lower ratings. I wasn't about to shell out more money for more mediocrity. What a disappointment for a Daniel Boloud restaurant- and for the Venetian in general.

2196361,2015-03-25,0,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"When I think about French restaurants, words like ""pretentious,"" ""tiny portions, and ""unnecessarily fancy"" come to mind. I am happy to report that DB Brasserie shattered all of my preconceived notions about French fine dining. 

The restaurant is obviously elegant, but surprisingly more casual than I expected. It wasn't too dimly lit, and light pop/top 40 music played in the background. For a Tuesday evening, it was quite busy as well. 

Service was attentive, but thankfully not overbearing. We were assisted by at least 3 servers, and each of them were friendly and warm without being too chatty, casual, or unprofessional. 

The bartender crafted a cocktail just for me- he asked what type of drink I usually prefer (fruity, sweet, refreshing, etc). As a drinker who doesn't like to taste alcohol (make my drink taste like punch, please!), he took note and brought something pretty perfect- fruity, but not overwhelmingly sweet or cloying. And just as I requested, I couldn't taste the alcohol! I couldn't even place what kind of alcohol it was, actually. (It ended up being something made with vodka, pomegranate liquor, and a few other things that I can't remember right now). Despite its appealing taste, it was strong! I definitely felt it only halfway through the drink.

The complementary bread was also very good. I typically don't like bread that isn't served warm or soft, but although the bread was neither, it was still delicious, especially with the butter.

And now.. The star of the show- the food! I'd never tried escargot before, mainly because I always picture the scene in Pretty Woman, but my dining companion convinced me to give it a shot, and I am SO glad that I did. The Escargot ""Spatzle"" was absolutely amazing. I could see myself returning just for a bowl of this deliciousness. I actually didn't really want to share it with my dining companion- every time he took a bite, I was wracked with resentment. It was served in a shallow dish with mushrooms, hazelnuts, and a light pasta. I can't speak enough about it. The taste of the shellfish was highlighted by everything else, but was not overpowering. 

For my main course, I couldn't resist the scallops. Also amazing. Four large scallops, perfectly seared, served over an apple-aine nut gremolata and mushrooms (full disclosure, I had to look up this description on the menu). Whatever it was, it was like a sweet mashed potato, and it was fantastic. It married perfectly with the scallops, and I could have eaten it all day. As it was, I completely cleaned my plate and if I wasn't in a fancy French restaurant, I might have licked it, too!

For dessert, we split the Grand Marnier Souffle. Be forewarned, this takes about 20 minutes or so to prepare from the time you order it. This is the only item that I thought was good, rather than great. It was beautifully presented, but didn't really ""wow"" me. I didn't see too many other dessert items on the menu that were non-chocolate based, which was a little disappointing as well.

After the meal, I felt happily full (not stuffed, but very comfortable), and incredibly satisfied. In fact, if I could give DB Brasserie a 4.5 stars, I most certainly would. This is not an inexpensive restaurant, but for the quality, service, and atmosphere, well worth the money.

French Onion Soup
Steak Frites
Cheeses

My husband and I were looking for a place to hit for my birthday. After reading about db Brasserie's lunch special, we decided to head out here to give it a try. We thought that tasting menu price had changed however it remained at $29 per 3 course prix fixe which was nice to see.

We came in on a weekday and it was unexpectedly slow. We got in at 11am and we were the only table for a good 20 minutes. Even at the noon there were perhaps only 5 tables including our own in the restaurant.

For our selections we chose the pate, salmon rillette, coq au vin, the loup de mer , the cheese plate and chocolate fondant.

We were started off with a sourdough bread basket which was okay - nothing really special.

The country pate was very good, served with 2 slices of toasted bread. Although studded with mushrooms, it didn't have that bit of umami kick I was expecting. It was served with some lovely pickled vegetables on frisee. 

Salmon rillette was nice and refreshing. Very similar to smoked salmon in flavor, the fennel, dill and capers provided rounded out the taste. Crisped capers added some interesting texture to the dish. It would have been better if served with a starch of either toast or some small blini.

Loup de mer was prepared well and served with crisp fingerling potatoes and frisee. I thought that the sauce was a little on the bland side but otherwise a complete dish.

The coq au vin was delicious. The complexity of the wine married well with the mixed mushrooms and pearl onions. The pasta it was served with felt out of place. The very al dente green pasta was placed on top of the dish and was not dressed with the sauce (to perhaps improve on the presentation?). It felt very much like an afterthought rather than an integral part of the dish. I felt that perhaps just some simple traditional egg noodles dressed with some butter may have worked better. 

The black and white fondant over molten chocolate cake was very good and I loved the verbena ice cream it was served with.

I was less pleased with the cheese plate. The sparse grapes it was served with were underripe and starting to age (slightly getting brown and noted wrinkling at the stems). The cheese selection was good though and I enjoyed the candied nuts/preserves as well as the bread it came with.

Service in general was quite smooth. The server would sometimes lapse and forget to mention what the cheese selection was. Overall water glasses were never left unfilled and our cheque was processed promptly.

When it comes to db Brasserie, it is French bistro style cuisine done well....but not exceptionally well. The food lacked that bit of finesse which distinguishes good from truly excellent. Despite this, I am going interested in trying this restaurant again. Due to this, the restaurant gets a 4 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,2,4,H8ZWdEEmQbQEiIfg4MjCRA

Our server was friendly, attentive and gave us a great explanation of the menu.  Our water cups were never empty and we got a complimentary amuse bouche.

We all tried the pre-fixe menu, most of us ordered the beet salad, steak & frites, and chose one of the three desserts available with the menu.  

1. Beet Salad - A nice selection of beets, with a nice earthy flavor which was well complimented by the goat cheese and dressing.  The only complaint is I wish I had more of that delicious cheese. 

2. Steak & frites - I ordered my steak medium-well, it maintained it's juiciness and tenderness.  The portion size was quite generous and was accompanied by a wedge salad.  The steak was drizzled with a red sauce, which complimented the meat perfectly.  The dressing on the wedge salad was tangy, I made sure to eat all of it.  

3. Dessert - I forgot the name but it was some sort of chocolate cake with ice cream. It was super rich and the perfect ending to a great dining experience.

The interior of the restaurant is fairly impressive.  The finishings are nice and well suited for a brasserie.  We were given a comfortable booth, unfortunately, it was directly facing the huge tv's in the bar.  I know it's commonplace to have tv's in restaurants, but I'm not a fan.  It's a distraction from the ambiance.

Service was cold and impersonal.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. It took ages to get bread (bread portion is tiny by the way).

The food was extremely average and there are some bizarre inclusions on there.  We were baffled as to why there's a Thai calamari on the menu.  Apparently, the Executive Chef likes to add his own flavor to things.  That's fine, but it seems like a distortion of the message.  Isn't it meant to be an interpretation of french cooking?

For the first course, I got the Caesar salad with pesto dressing and tomato confit. I think it is probably the best Caesar salad I've ever had! The pesto tones down the tang of the dressing and the tomatoes were really tasty. 

The main course was steak frites.  The steak was cooked exactly as I asked and the bearnaise dipping sauce was really wonderful. Some people may not like the French fries on the plate, but I loved it because I got to have a little of the casual comfort food along with the rest of my meal. Also on the plate were some lettuce leaves, which had not yet been pulled apart, but had a tasty vinaigrette within them. I think this steak dish was the collective favorite at the table. 

For dessert I ordered the dolce cherry bomb. It wasn't quite what I expected but it was very good. I'm a chocolate girl, and there was less chocolate than I liked. However, the cherry cream part of the dessert wasn't overly sweet and was a nice complement to the chocolate cake base. There were also some sort of candy balls (maybe caramel?) and they were also delicious. A few friends got the cheese plate and raved about it. 

The waiters were nice and knowledgeable about the menu. We were seated right at the edge at the restaurant, which I didn't love because we were very close to everyone walking through the Venetian. The waiter was gracious when we split the bill and everyone was nice. I'm not sure how I would have felt about the value of this restaurant if we didn't pay restaurant week prices, but for now all I can say is that it was a wonderful meal that we all really enjoyed! I would go back for the meal I had.",ycpyXOqArU_6FrC8ck4MXg,1,0,5,Foac_jPdO5C5-wT56AoMCA

The service was mediocre- the waitress lacked emotions and her voice was so quiet we could barely hear her the whole time. 

As for the sides, the waitress asked ""what would you like for your side?"" to all of us, and we thought they were included in the meal. Later when we got the bill, we found out that the sides were about $10 each. No complaints, they probably will say ""it's your fault for not looking at the prices on the menu"" but we felt that she should've asked instead of sounding like she's offering sides.

The restaurant does have a romantic vibe though- the interior was nice.

However for a $250 bill without any drinks and 4 very salty dishes, I wouldn't come back.",bTjz3ejFAdS7cSzd08mAeQ,2,1,2,1xRc4mZXNeXw7OhAC-q3Jg

When serving wine from the mini decanters it seemed more like he was just dumping it into the glassware. He seemed almost hostile, making me uncomfortable.

THE SERVICE: Spot on, incredibly professional and prompt.

THE COST: $500 total (including tax/tip) for dinner for nine. A bit pricey, good for a splurge.

MUST-HAVES: That duck special I got!

THE FOOD: See below, and also see my photos for more details!

* Free bread basket - 4.5 stars
This was delicious. There were several types of breads, from a grain bread, to focaccia, to a cheddar-muffin-like bread. 

FRENCH CLASSICS
* Foie Gras Terrine (fig and apricot mostarda, brioche, toasted almonds. $23) - 4 stars
Tried a bite, the foie was very rich and tasty, and goes well with all of the components on this plate! It is quite pricey for a kind of sparse plate.

ENTREES
* Seared Sea Scallops (green asparagus, jambon de Paris, braised leeks, mushroom sabayon. $33) - 4 stars
As my boyfriend put it, ""quite good!"" He really enjoyed this (and orders scallops a lot). I took a bite and agree!

* Crispy Duck Confit (Braised kale, caramelized onions, white beans, natural jus. $34) - 3.5 stars
The kale and white beans were really tasty complements. The duck had a good crisp, but it was very salty, and a little dry in places.

* Duck breast special - 4.5 stars
Very delicious. Incredibly tender meat, juicy, and surprisingly the cherry glaze on top worked! (I'm not usually a big fan of cherry.)",eIa4QJXp5ZNmuFORnuPvDA,0,0,4,QBaTb2EdOS3MXDcJlgh4Zg

2653513,2016-09-05,1,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"Overall, this meal was ok and service was appalling but the four star review stems solely from me becoming a better host due to ideas picked up from their menu.  The whole reason we as diners go out to each is to enjoy someone else's food and beverage either by yourself or with a group to share the experience.  Nothing in the food realm jumped out as everything was what it should have been.  However, the service from the start was terrible.  We waited over 30 minutes to place and receive our drinks from the bar.  Followed by another 90 minutes for our entrees.  For a simple turn, this meal did not call for a 2 hour period.  We know the POS system can go down at times, which we think is what happened here, however there was no communication from the FOH to the diners on the holdup.  That aspect needs to be fixed (but understand those things happen).  The highlight of the meal was the libations.  Each of us ordered a different drink but mine was the most memorable.  It was called the ""Expat"".  A healthy dose of Woodford Reserve with a touch of vanilla extract poured over a circle cube infused w/ ginger syrup.  As you drank (or inhaled) the ice melted and released a complimentary ginger bite that was welcomed while enjoying the Crispy Duck Confit.  This drink is now made weekly in my house as a fantastic wind down to my day and served to guests looking for a way to bring out all the great notes in a Whisky or Bourbon.

It is not haute cuisine or nouvelle cuisine, a Brasserie is more casual and generally  less pretentious food.  That being said - we shared the Charcuterie Board duck confit hash, and PEI mussels.  Our server was attentive without being intrusive and the food was excellent - served hot, wonderfully seasoned (mussels swimming in a lemon butter broth), and exactly as described.  The charcuterie was a thoughtful interpretation of traditional pates and meats enhanced by a delectable assortment of home made pickles-the duck hash was under a perfectly cooked egg and the Mussels were perfectly cooked, had a fresh lemon tang, and were served toast - making for a perfect palate cleansing during the meal. It's casual and relaxed - if you are in a hurry perhaps try somewhere else - but if you're with someone special and don't want to be hurried - try DB Brasserie.",Jey1B1Xn27k142f8pOjDHA,0,0,5,VALzx9zOoJzrvwtbEnow8w
2662749,2015-03-27,9,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"The food here tastes pretty darn magical but I couldn't get past how petite the portions were. My fianc√© and I tend to share everything since we don't eat too much in one sitting, yet these dishes were barely enough for us to share, without being selfish! 

Also, we felt that the service was preferential to age. Our server pretty much ditched us for a table with more mature looking patrons - probably chasing a larger tip. It's extremely insulting to wait around for extended periods of time, looking around for a simple refill on our drinks and the check.

Other than those two setbacks, the food we tasted was very flavorful and prepared with extreme care. We started off happy hour with some bread and butter. The bread potion is small, but they offered 2 varieties: fluffy and crusty; they were equally quality and satisfying. 

From the happy hour menu (3-6pm daily), we selected: 

Prosciutto $8
La Quercia Ham, Arugula, Grilled Focaccia, Tapenade - the prosciutto was moist and wonderfully flavorful. Paired with a little bit of arugula and spread some olive tapenade, it was a perfect topping on the grilled focaccia. Portion is barely enough for 2 to share. Flavor rating: 5/5

Mussels Gratin $8
Garlic Bread Crumbs, Stewed Peppers, Parsley - the tiniest gratin dish with a wonderful garlic aroma arrives bubbling hot to the table. Spread on top of some crusty bread and it was delicious! The surprising taste of stewed bell peppers made this a different spin on the classic garlic and butter escargot. Again, portion is perfect for 1, yet stretching it to share. Flavor rating: 4/5

From the dinner menu, we selected: 

Saut√©ed rainbow trout $24 cauliflower golden raisins caper brown butter - the presentation was minimalist yet breathtakingly elegant. The perfectly cooked, crispy skin trout was topped with a light sauce with whole capers and raisin, also a two-tone purple and white steamed cauliflower design on the plate. The subtle sweetness from the brown butter was divine and really showcased the delicate trout. The hugest problem I had was, although perfectly prepared, the fish cut was very thin and did not yield a lot of meat. The entree portion was a huge tease and certainly not meant to be shared. Flavor rating: 5/5

I would definitely return for the incredible food, but honestly I wouldn't expect to get full; just a taste of excellence.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,14,16,3,8ECdHR7DsFbUjAJz8sUIeg

2696923,2014-06-25,4,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"This is quickly going to become one of my favorite spots on the strip. Quiet, yet boisterous. Elegant, but subdued. I've wanted to try Chef Boulud's food for a long time. It exceeded all of my expectations...which were very high.

The service was good. We had an attentive waiter, everything came out in a timely manner and every need was met. Nothing over the top and nothing that set DB apart from the norm, but good. The only gripe I have is that it would've been nice to have some more description of the courses as they came out. These aren't your typical ""steak frites"" or ""onion soup"" dishes. Some involved some serious thought and expertise and deserved more than just, ""here's your calamari.""

I loved the atmosphere. A fine mix of classic French decor, (tile floors and leather banquettes) and a contemporary, inviting ambience. It was luxurious, yet comfortable.

But what brings this restaurant to five stars is the food. We didn't get an entree; just a plethora of small plates and appetizers.

Lamb flatbread: perfectly crispy and rich. The buttery lamb was braised down with eggplant and Mediterranean spices until it was smooth and silky. The yogurt based sauce on top added just the right amount of tang to balance out the rich flavor of the lamb. It was garnished with micro cilantro that still had seedlings of coriander attached and diced apricots. Really added nice fresh and sweet notes so that everything was in perfect harmony.

Shellfish plateau: this is a guilty pleasure of ours. Nothing different from the norm aside from the ridiculous freshness of everything. We had oysters from both the east and west coasts (I can't tell you what kind they were because we weren't informed). They were plump, juicy and sweet. There was also king crab, lobster tail and shrimp. The mignonette was tart and peppery and was perfect with the oysters. They also served a beautiful ""French"" cocktail sauce which had the addition of mayonnaise and brandy. A nice touch that gave a lobster bisque-ish flavor to the perfectly poached shellfish.

Balik smoked salmon: my favorite dish of the evening. The house cured and smoked salmon was garnished simply with toasted caraway seed and sliced. It was so unctuous and creamy. Easily the best smoked salmon I've ever tried. There were little potato dauphinois puffs with the roe and a touch of creme fraiche in the middle. Light, but rich and unbelievably delicious. I wonder if they sell those instead of popcorn at movie theaters in France. The trio of salmon was finished with a decadent salmon rillette with a tiny toasted pumpernickel cracker on the bottom. So much technique was put into this dish. It was perfect.

Burratta salad: a simple and unique take on a tomato-mozzarella salad. The burratta sat atop a braised artichoke heart, which, in turn, sat atop diced tomatoes. It was surrounded by a salad of arugula with a sharp balsamic vinaigrette. Under normal circumstances, the acidity of the dressing would've been overwhelming. But this is why I was so impressed with this place. The chefs know how rich the burratta is and how much it craves to be cut by a little acid. Balance. It's all about balance.

Thai calamari: perfectly cooked. I know it's cliche to say something like that in a review, but more often than not, calamari is over cooked in many restaurants. The beer batter was so incredibly crispy and worked so well with the chewy texture of the beloved mollusk. The sauce was a play on thai red curry and had some good spice to it. It was all finished with pickled, bright red Fresno chiles and cilantro. A beautiful dish in sight and in taste.

Pommes frites: I had to get em. Nothing special here, but they were, of course, perfect. Served with ketchup, to my surprise. I asked for a side of aioli and was obliged. When in Rome!

Balance. Years of training and obsession with perfection. Countering textures and flavors. Sweet, spicy, bitter, sour, savory...they were all there. My hat is off to you, Chef Boulud. A perfect meal.",HQlvsUqVhtJDH0ASBzaLsA,8,3,5,NuHGRahOlvhG3__9SiVByQ

He merely asked what we wanted to eat. There was no talk of cocktails or specials for the day. We ordered appetizers for the party to share which never arrived. The server later admitted he forgot. As compensation, he offered a plate of Madeleine's. Throughout brunch he rarely came to check on our table of seven people. Nor did the manager who was too busy talking at the hostess stand. There were only five tables in the restaurant, and he never touched one.

As far as the food goes, we were underwhelmed. We ordered the Duck Hash, their specialty burger, and the Croque Madame. All of which were lacking in originality and flavor. For instance, the Croque Madame is such a simple classic dish, yet they managed to ruin it with overly think slices of ham, very little bechamel, an overdone egg, and bread you can barely slice into. 
We had been looking forward to this visit for a long time, but we were greatly disappointed by the entirety of the experience. It put a damper on our holiday.

My wife and I both started with the onion soup, and we agreed that we have tasted much better.  It was light on the cheese, kind of one-note on the broth, and a bit bland on the onions.  My flat iron steak was tender and had some flavor, but it was not one of truly memorable steaks I have had in so many Las Vegas restaurants.  My wife's rib eye cap was tough and not very good.  A side of Lyonnaise potatoes was not good at all.  On the plate with the steaks was a large wedge salad, which I guess served as the side vegetable.  Again, not very good and we left these unwanted salads nearly untouched.  We split a dessert  - a trio of eclairs.  It was just plain bad.  Dry and flavorless.  We mentioned this to our waiter and he offered to bring us a different dessert, which we declined.  Well, at least the coffee was good.

The service and ambiance were better than the food.  Our waiters (they switched up mid-meal) took good care of us, and answered our questions in a useful way.  The room is very much a brasserie; if I had looked out the window and seen a Paris street scene instead of a casino I would not have felt out of place.  The fact that the restaurant faces on the casino makes it easy to find; which is not always the case when it comes to restaurants in the labyrinth of the Venetian/Palazzo complex.

Prices for some of the dishes on the menu were pretty high end, but there were less expensive alternatives available as well.  There was also a prix fixe menu with limited choices which was a pretty good deal, although we did not try it.  Our waiter told us that the prix fixe menu changes weekly, and since it is not listed on the web site you will be taking your chances if you show up hoping for that deal to sooth your pocketbook.

All things considered, I would urge anyone with a craving for French bistro fare to go next door to Paris and eat at Mon Ami Gabi; skipping DB Brasserie.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,3,_uZD4c4jxZ1zrpQt9-L4Ng

2942996,2015-07-28,0,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"This is a contemporary French Bistro located in the Venetian Hotel/Casino on the strip.

One of the very best things I tasted in Las Vegas was the Cheese Puff from the bread basket at DB Brasserie as it was extraordinary. It was hot crisp but also light and hollow with a chewy cheesy delicious interior. If you go here you must try the cheese puff.

A special of the evening was Australian Truffle Risotto so we shared it as an appetizer because Austrian Truffles are awesome. The risotto comes out and the chef hand shaves a very good amount of truffles on to the dish. The risotto it's self is well made but those truffles were flavorless. I never had fresh flavorless truffles before so I was disappointed. I didn't complain because the risotto it's self was good and above average.

My dinner was the Skuna Bay Salmon. The fish was prepared next to perfect and this was a nice tasty dish. It didn't wow me like the cheese puff. It was just a nice dish.

My husband had the signature quail special. It was suppose to be flavored with truffles and duck liver but those flavors were too delicate to notice. The quail seemed a little dry but we don't eat quail often so I'm not sure about that. The sides around the quail were very good.

Service was mostly very good. We were charged more for the risotto than the price the waiter quoted. I felt that was a slight error on the waiters part. Cocktails seemed to be prepared well.

Overall happy with the meal.  For the price range in the Venetian I've had far better so this is closer to three stars for me. I would still be open to give DP Brasserie another try.

We ordered the Caesar salad, which easily split into two. They did that for us, and the flavors and textures were enjoyable.

My amiga got the salmon and loved it. It was a modest-sized portion, cooked to perfection, and dressed nicely with beautiful sauces and accoutrements. I got the crispy duck confit, which I can't recommend enough! The skin was perfectly crispy, the duck was juicy, and it was served with some delicious greens and mushrooms. I highly recommend this dish.

One other reviewer mentioned that you should skip the bread ""basket"" and the desserts. I would have to concur with this sentiment, though their hard French is quite good and salted nicely. For dessert I had the ""black and white,"" which is a warm flourless chocolate cake with a verbena ice cream. The cake was lukewarm and got cold quickly. I didn't like the verbena ice cream at all, but I won't hate on it since it's probably a personal preference. I kept eating little bites of it to see if it would grow on me or blend with the cake nicely, but I wasn't sold on it. I don't feel like the price tag of the Black and White matched what I got. Cappuccinos were very good.

This place gets knocked down a star for the service. I was NOT impressed at all. The server was very brisk with us, did not introduce himself, and treated us like we couldn't afford things. I'm glad he thinks that I look young, but it doesn't mean I can't afford the meal I want to eat. I felt very unwelcome at dinner. The food runners all seemed to be a lot calmer and certainly more polite to us than the server. The food was fantastic, and ambience was nice. It would be worth another try, but I would walk out if they gave me the same server.",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,1,1,4,dE13dl150Ed2g93pBlQj8w

Realizing that DB was also part of the Boulud empire, i easily convinced my family to try this place out for Saturday nights dinner. 

For Starters, we ordered:
A bottle of light & crisp  chardonnay $80 
A Dozen oysters (6 EC / 6 WC) Those were probably some of the best oysters I've had (comparable to Hog's Island & Watergrill) normally not a big East Coast fan, these were extremely succulent & just a tad bit briny, it was deelish! The West Coast ones never really vary much & are constantly plump & sweet, also delicious!  $36

For appetizers we ordered: 
The Hieirloom beet (light, sweet & refreshing) $13
King Crab Salad (a bit heavier then i would have liked, but good flavor & expected for a winter based menu) $20

For Entrees we ordered: 
Duck Confit - traditional & flavorful, perfect for warming up the belly on cold winter nights! $36
Short Ribs Orecchiette - It was good, nothing spectacular $24
Seafood Linguine - also decent, nothing spectacular $28
Wild Mushroom Cavetelli - i actually don't remember trying this one, my dad ordered it. $22
Seared Scallops - Good flavor, perfectly seared, soft & tender texture $33
Seabass - Creamy, never been a big fan of seabass but for the type of fish, it was definitely cooked well $

For Dessert, we ordered:
3 cheese plate - incredibly lackluster, disappointing selection of cheeses available 

Overall, the food was satisfactory, I would suggest skipping the pastas & just ordering the more classic french dishes.  Can't be bothered reviewing the service since it was close to non-existent, but had a wonderful dinner none the less. Cheers!",-sTYE7ioK1_pvWsj1rKw5Q,1,0,4,LmHDFtxSvBmSakh6bVu6nA

We arrived about 1230 PM on a Wednesday.  DB was empty.  My guess is they are challenged drawing in a lunch crowd as the menu is rather sophisticated and prices a tad high for The Venetian.

Ordered a glass of chardonnay for a drink.  I love when my wine glass is of good quality and hand polished to perfection.  So many good restaurants just don't get this.  the wine was exceptional and flawlessly chilled.  Was a nice way to start off lunch.

I chose the three course lunch special.  I believe the price was $31 which is a very good value for a Daniel Boulod restaurant.  My first course was a squash soup with a pomegranate cr√®me fraiche.  I enjoyed it.

I then had a wonderful bowl of mussels for my main course done classically with garlic, parsley and wine.  Precisely what I was in the mood for.

My dessert was a cheese plate.  And yes, they know how to select and serve cheese.  Clearly the French roots have served them well as the cheeses were amazing.  they were served with the correct accoutrements and at the proper temperature.

But, there were a couple of redeeming qualities. One was the duck confit hash, which was delicious. Creamy, salty, and savory, it was the perfect brunch food. Also, the bottomless mimosas, which they will let you take to go if you don't finish all of it before brunch is over. That's the spirit of Vegas that I remember!

Even the bussers are nice and take the time to make sure you are enjoying your meal. The place is cozy too with nice decor. I love the black and white with the green cups and the lighting is perfect not too bright not too dark. So for drinks I had the m√©nage a tois which is 3 different champagnes. They were all great.

The burratta was really good too complimented perfectly with the balsamic and tomatoes. For our main course we had the crispy duck confit. My only duck eating experience has been Chinese food (and earlier mentioned presse) so I had an idea of why to expect. What we got was not what I expected, it was better! A nice crispy outside with tender juicy meat that just falls off the bone inside. This is one of those meals you will dream about.

3218228,2015-05-26,3,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"I hate to drop so many stars, but it's a must.  My 1st visit garnered the 5 stars; I've been back 3 more times since then and have not experienced the quality food or service that I would expect and that the prices suggest one should have when dining at DB Brasserie.

This last visit really just pushed me over the edge. 

We were seated right away during brunch on the Sunday of Memorial Day Weekend; we assumed the place would be more busy, but were glad they weren't.  Our server, Issouf, took quite a while to come by, but he did, finally. We ordered two DB Bloodys and took a look at the menu.  About 10 minutes later, we ordered all our food, asked for the wine list, and still waited on the cocktails.  A few minutes after that, we received the wine list and were told that the drinks would come soon; the bartender needed to 'make some tomato juice.' A few minutes later, we received one DB Bloody. There was no flavor other than tomato juice; no spice, no other flavor. It literally tasted like canned tomato sauce with a little bit of vodka. The cocktail waitresses on the casino floor will bring a better one.  

Our Charcuterie board arrives; still no wine. We finally get some wine, about 10 minutes after the charcuterie board.  The place is not that busy. Seriously. About 10 minutes after that, I'm able to flag someone down so I can get a refill of water. 

Jim G. gets his Steak and Eggs and I get my French Onion Soup; both look good. Immediately, our server is there to ask how things are. As we haven't tasted anything, we can only say 'fine.' As I taste my soup, however, I realize that it's water with onions thrown in. There's no depth, no wine/sherry/etc, nothing. I have had French Onion soup from this restaurant, as well as many others; I know what a good version tastes like. This was water with onions, topped with a very good cheese. When our waiter returned, literally about 20 minutes later (Jim G. was done with his plate), my soup was still full. I let our waiter know that it was not good and, when he asked why, I explained.  He said to me, ""That's the recipe for French Onion soup. But, if you don't like it, I can bring you another soup."" After ignoring us for all that time, he's going to try to tell me what the recipe for French Onion soup is?! 

As we need to go (to check out of the hotel to catch our flight and because I feel like I'm wasting my last bit of time fuming at a table while being ignored and not eating brunch), I was quite actively watching the time.  More than 20 minutes after taking the soup, our waiter still has not returned to see if we need anything else (like the check). At this point, Jim G. is over it, so we walk up to the front so we can retrieve and pay our check.  As Jim G. is about to sign it, I realize that both of the DB Bloodys (of which we only received one) are on the bill. While this is an honest mistake, it's just too much at this point. Ignored virtually the entire time, essentially told that I don't know what French Onion soup is, and then charged for a $14 drink you didn't even bring me; nope. 

While the space is beautiful and the food, when executed well, is great, service is as great a component to dining. When Daniel's name is on a place and the food is priced at this price point, then the service better be in the same category.  When some of the food (and some of the basics) is done so poorly and the service is so subpar, why should we go there? There are only so many meals to eat in a lifetime; I don't want to waste any of mine.",-lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw,9,6,2,NDNhmPVWloanivMpKeLevg

The restaurant has an elegant yet modern feel with some light mood music with a nice beat playing in the background.  I was seated on a leather bench that was very comfortable.  

After perusing the menu, I opted for the three course prix fixe meal for $48.  For the appetizer, I chose the salmon rillettes, the coq au vin for the entr√©e and the pistachio-cherry sundae.  

The salmon rillettes was very refreshing and delicate.  The smooth texture of the spread was married well to the bread-cracker, but it would have been nice to have more of them, since the one small cracker was not ample to enjoy the rillettes to the fullest.

The coq au vin was well executed and the chicken had the fall-off-the bone quality and the dish just tasted great.

I finished with the cherry sundae which was mainly positive.  The ice cream was not overwhelmingly sweet and there were some nice textural treats with the pistacchios and hard cookie.  The marshmallows were a bit too chewy for me and I would have preferred some sweetness with the cherries as they were predominantly sour.

My waitress was very cute with her French accent and she had a nice smile and we engaged in pleasant conversation.  The wait staff were very friendly as well and were prompt in refilling my water glass and clearing the table after each course.

One thing to note is that the presentation of all of the dishes were superb and after the coupon, I felt I had great value with the meal costing less than $60 including tip and a beverage.",hkSTeVnKsPM_dQeD5GWsTQ,1,1,4,6gKrcbSVOk9lJhWh6NW3Bg

The Heirloom Tomato Salad contained two types of tomatoes, large slices and cherry. The use of grilled ricotta cheese was a nice twist instead of mozzarella. The tables were not set with salt and pepper shakers and our server did not offer any for the salad.
The Yankee Burger consists of a 7 oz beef patty and was cooked well done as requested. The burger had a nice char and juicy on the inside. The French Fries were very good, crisp outside and soft inside.

We ordered the calamari. I liked it but Will said it had no flavor. Half the pieces were like onion ring pieces; very little actual calamari. A mere smear of sauce; not enough. The menu made it sound like it was going to be a flavor explosion, but it was mediocre. Salt is cheap, duh brassiere. 

We also ordered the spam, I mean pate.

We finished by splitting a hamburger. Will liked it OK because it was salty and grilly but it tasted burnt to me.

The room is done classic brasserie style, it's warm and comforting. The service across the board was impeccable. And David, my waiter, was outstanding. He really took care of everything, made sure the food wasn't rushed and was very enjoyable.

And the food! I started with the country pate', one of the better pates I've had. It came with a wonderful homemade mustard and a sublime frisee salad. Next was the Caesar, which I had to try since everyone raves about it. It is indeed amazing. I am not sure I would call it a Caesar, give the pesto involved, but who cares when a salad is this incredible. I finished with a Coq Au Vin, also terrific. I was initially surprised when it was served, as I am used to this dish having a lot of juices/sauce. The bowl was full but with all the elements and not much sauce. Well, that is because the sauce had been reduced to almost a thick syrup that coated everything. Yum. Wonderful. 

I will be back and hope that people continue to discover it. I think it is a little odd that this opened in the same hotel as Bouchon, given the menus are in some ways similar. DB Brasserie, of course, is right in the heart of the casino. I hope that means it will be around for years to come. It's terrific.  onfoodandfilm.com",sJDZJgIdCqFIa7pNFyjhgw,2,1,5,gjxApc6Kq1-4zLOym4bFSw

And Shady is very happy to report it lived up to all expectations. Shady and lucky dining partner started with some cocktails, Shady opting for the trio of Champagne. 1 too sweet, 1 very good and one 1 just right-the Cherry flavored was the best of the three. For starters, Shady and Co. opted for the Piosson fume and the hamachi cru. The Piosson was delicious smoked salmon expertly presented  and the crue equally as impressive. For mains, and this where DB stands apart, Shady went for the Duck Confit and lucky lucky guest went for 95$ ribeye. The duck was as good as Shady has ever had, maybe the best period. Shady licked the bone and thought about eating that as well. Crisp, not gamey, this is THE Duck dish in Vegas. The ribeye was cooked to perfection. Shadys guest was in food heaven. For dessert, Shady went off road and ordered the cheese plate. Three off the charts cheeses, the bleu cheese being Shady's favorite. Service was as good as it gets, with Shady's server being patient, thorough and professional. The venue is impressive, and the overall was just terrific. The Duck makes Shady's hall of fame.

We ordered off the pre fixe menu and got the wine pairing as well. I was NOT impressed with the wine. The food was eh. OK. My caesar salad had some carrot, and radishes in it. I'm not opposed to those, but I dont think they belong in that salad. I also didn't care for the anchovies ""decorated"" on top. Kinda gross IMO.
The steak frites dinner was OK. I REALLY liked the grilled romaine with mustardy dressing. Weird, that I liked that better than the caesar, but whatev. The cheese platter was nice for dessert too.
I just realized writing about the cheese platter what put me off. First, we were a group of 7. When they brought out bread, they had a small bowl with 7 small pieces. I understand that it's a classier place, not cheesecake factory with huge portions but come on! 7 pieces of bread. And, when I ordered my cheese platter for dessert, there was one tiny piece of cranberry bread. I dont know about you, but I LOVE my bread when eating cheese. Hello, if you want to model yourself after a Parisian brasserie, gimme some damn bread fool!
It certainly was an OK meal, but for $100, I'd rather go elsewhere. Yes, a hundred bucks for a small caesar salad, small steak frites and a cheese platter with wine pairing. There are soooooo many places on the strip I can do better for a hundred bucks and TONS of places I can go off the strip, (like 5 times!) for better food and price point.

The service was fine - I really couldn't complain about it, or complement it.  There was nothing that really stood out.

What REALLY grated me about this place and the reason why I'm rating it 2 stars, was our arrival for lunch - Look, I get it. You open at 11:30.  But when we arrive at 11:24, you can't seat us for 6 minutes? You're really going to turn us away for 6 fucking minutes?  Fuck you.  I would like to think Mr. Boulud would find this unacceptable. 

6 minutes? 6 fucking minutes is too early to be treated like the guests we were supposed to be?  The prep work seemed done.  Service meeting wasn't going on [in the dining room] and even it it was, you won't seat us with an explanation? We're second class citizens because we showed up 6 minutes early?

They decorated the restaurant with black, white, and gold balloons. I liked how you could order from the special prix-fixe menu and/or the regular menu. The chef gave us a traditional scone like bread roll that was semi hollow and consisted of cayenne pepper, black pepper, and covered in Gruyere cheese. It was delicious and had a kick. The servers brought out a basket with two types of bread - olive bread and baguette as well as Vermont butter. For drinks, I'd recommend non-alcoholic Ginger Beer garnished with a lime and a bottle of Ladera Sauvignon Blanc. 

For appetizers, I'd recommend the Tuna Tartare, Escargots Spatzle, and Heirloom Beets. The Tuna Tartare consisted of a tower with the bottom layer of tuna, the next layer consisted of avocado, mango, puffed rice, and topped with cucumber. Below the tower was Harissa sesame sauce. The tuna was fresh and the dish was delicious! The Escargot Spatzle consisted of burgundy snail fricassee, chicken 'oysters', mushrooms, roasted garlic, parsley, and hazelnut. It was sweet, savory, and garlicky! The Heirloom Beets consisted of roasted red and candy cane beets, citrus-herbed goat cheese, black quinoa, and pistachio sherry vinaigrette. It was a colorful dish and great combination of ingredients. 

For entrees, I'd recommend Saut√©ed Dover Sole A La Polonaise, Seared Sea Scallops, Roasted Half Chicken, and Seafood Linguine. The Saut√©ed Dover Sole consisted of filets of dover sole, crouton, mimosa, caper, and oscetra caviar. The Seared Sea Scallops consisted of three tender, jumbo scallops, celery root, hen of the woods mushrooms, and apple-pine nut gremolata. The Roasted Half Chicken consisted of a herb roasted half chicken and roasted garlic, broiled Brussels sprouts with pancetta and pearl onion, and marsala chicken jus on the side. The chicken skin was crispy and meat was tender and flavorful. The Seafood Linguini consisted of lemon saffron pasta, clams, shrimp, bottarga, and arugula. I liked how it was lemon infused throughout the dish.

For desserts, I'd recommend the Champagne and Caviar, Grand Mariner Souffl√©, and Freshly Baked Madeleines. The 
Champagne and Caviar consisted of white chocolate cremeux, rose granite, champagne gelee, raspberry and blackberry caviar. I like how the fruit flavored caviar popped in our mouths. The Grand Mariner Souffl√© was filled with orange and lemon zest and vanilla anglaise. The Freshly Baked Madeleines were warm, miniature lemon cakes with a crispy exterior. They were served in a metal basket similar to the one that carried bread.",EiT_pSuIb08oRn4CfwfMJg,2,2,5,iMiDiRs6SO_T2AbTQ1uLMg

db Brasserie is a triumphant return of Chef Daniel Boulud. When his brasserie at the Wynn disappeared, I got upset because I couldn't understand why Las Vegas didn't support his culinary talents. But, voila, he's back in Vegas at The Venetian.

This brasserie reminds me of those ""classic-looking"" restaurants that one sees in film from the late 1800 to early 1900. The vintage floor tiles, lighting fixtures, dark wood panels, white table linens, simple printed menus and professionally dressed waiters evoked a sense of relaxed French brew pub comfort. Service was impeccable from start to finish. Our waiter and wait help were always around but never obtrusive. 

The high quality of the ""simple"" menu items showcased both natural flavors of the main ingredient and the cooking techniques used to prepare each dish. We each started with a flute of db Paris champagne cocktail that was divine..I wanted another but, decided to not be a ""lush"". Next up, we shared our Thai Calamari appetizer which was a good shareable portion of crispy beer battered tender calamari, pickled Fresno chilies and kafir lime leaf aioli. The beer batter was so crisp and light and the chilie/kaffir lime aioli brightened the flavor. My husband ordered the duck confit as his entree while I tried DB's burger called ""The Piggie"". Both entrees hit the Gascony comfort food mark. The duck leg confit had been slow cooked in its own fat then its skin was crisped just before service...the duck meat was meltingly tender and well-seasoned. My ""Piggie"" burger was a tender, flavorful coarse ground 7 ounce all beef patty topped with juicy tender house made shredded BBQ  pork, jalape√±o mayonnaise and stuffed into a potato bun. On the side was a cupful of pommes frites aka French Fries. You could tell these fries had been double fried from its crispy exterior and smooth center...all the full potato flavor exuded from each stick. The portions were just the right size to its price point. But, each dish was big on flavor.

I expected a lot from Chef Boulud since I have had the pleasure of dining in his other restaurants, in New York and Las Vegas. He did NOT disappoint me!",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,10,10,5,HF3DbGEsaJjTyCsZ7ACDQQ

My friend had their French onion soup which she said was okay. The portion size was okay. I ordered Escargots Sp√§tzle, I was suspicious why would a German word be mixed with escargots and when I tasted it, I guess that's their excuse why it doesn't taste like esccargots. The first words out of my mouth to my friend was, ""This isn't escargots, I can cook better than this!"".  The portion size for the price was ridiculously small. The taste was okay. 

We ordered Seared Sea Scallops that cost $33 and Colorado Lamb T-Bone for $45.
What came out of the kitchen was a joke! 3 small pieces of scallops and a T-Bone with barely any meat on it! WTF!!! The taste was average to above average, nothing mind-blowing, special or makes you say, ""wow"". 

If you couldn't tell already, my overall review would be that the taste is average to above average, the portion size is ridiculously small and the experience was nothing to talk about to anyone later. My friend got us a 20% discount which lessen the feeling of getting ripped off.

It's been a while since I've dined there for dinner.  I've been wanting to go back for happy hour to try their Frenchie Burger, but unfortunately the chance for that never came.

For this visit, I dined here with my mom to treat her for her birthday.  It made it a perfect reason to go down to DB Brasserie since I wanted my mom to experience one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.

Unfortunately, since we had a late lunch earlier in the day, we didn't arrive completely hungry and only ordered main entrees.  I ordered their Beef Wellington 'Rossini' while my mom ordered their New York Striploin.

BEEF WELLINGTON 'ROSSINI'
6oz filet mignon, sauce bordelaise, Hudson Valley foie gras
I had the Beef Wellington ""Rossini"".  I haven't had any other Beef Wellingtons other than the famous one at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  DB Brasserie's version of it includes foie gras inside making it more decadent than GR's.  However, I can't say which is better.  They're both different in their own way and worth the money.  I'll say this though.  DB's Rossini Wellington was delicious in every way!  So exquisite and decadent.  The filet was cooked perfectly and the foie gras was spread throughout the pastry.  YUM!! 

12 OZ. NEW YORK STRIPLOIN
with Steak Bearnaise Sauce
My mom had their NY Steak and she enjoyed it, the only thing was that she could only eat half of it.  Which was fine because that meant that I got a good taste of it was well.  And it was nicely cooked NY Strip.

While I can say that the food was great, the magic didn't feel the same as before.  I don't know if it's because it's closing soon but the place didn't seem as vibrant as it was when I ate there the first couple of times.  Despite that, service was still great and we still had a great time.  I'm glad that i got to experience DB Brasserie one last time before they close.

I almost cancelled my reservation at the last minute. I was eating early and alone as my wife has a business dinner. All I can say is that I am glad I did not.

I will say the host staff could act like they were a little more interested in your being there. I was not very impressed. Now, my server was exceptionally good. Now granted I had the first res of the night so he was not busy at any time during my visit so that probably helped. The menu is extensive and there were a variety of things that caught my eye. I asked for his opinions and he was very helpful in guiding me to some things that he thought would be best based on what I had shared with him.

First off, I started with the Escargots Spatzle. The reason I went with this was that the server told me that a lot of people who like escargots said this was a unique preparation that they enjoyed. That is an understatement. I love escargots but let's face it. It is usually the quality of the snail that makes the dish because frankly the variety in preparation is minimal. This breaks the mold. Now, the snail may not be the most succulent or tender that I have ever had but all of that is forgotten when you taste the spatzle and the hazlenuts. If I could have picked up the bowl and licked it at the table I would have.

For my entree I went with one of my favorites, the crispy duck confit. Now, as far as entrees this was the main one that caught my attention. Sometimes you get great confit and sometimes you get it overcooked. Tonight was a masterful preparation. There was a concoction of swiss chard, turnips, mushrooms and a gravy that were incredible on their own, but the duck was certainly the star. I cannot recall a time when my confit was so tender and flavorful. It was just prepared exactly the way it should have be. 

Loved this meal. Sometimes these big names in Vegas can be a real let down but not here. I am just stunned at some of the negative reviews. I guess it could be hit or miss but my visit was a smashing hit.",s-ud0mGiAmFBvFbO6Di2BA,1,0,5,5DQwcp2KiHhoJZr2yLGuqg

3855375,2014-08-06,0,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"My group of about 5 girls had a grazie comp dinner for DB Brasserie so we thought that it would be perfect for us to use it for our first night in Vegas. We told the staff up front about the grazie comp and they were more than willing to accommodate us. 

The grazie dinner was a prefixed 3 course menu for two. This was perfectly fine between the 5 of us since we were going to order more items just in case.

We ordered the calamari, caesar salad, oysters, French onion soup, salmon, and steak.

Everything was superb! My favorites on the menu was everything except the salmon! The calamari was so delicious and the Thai flavors that they incorporated to it were subtle and not overwhelming. The Caesar salad and the oysters tasted so fresh. The French onion soup had a lot of flavor but it was a bit cold so my cousin and another girl had theirs reheated while the other girls and I enjoyed it cold (it was that good we didn't care to have it reheated). 
The steak was cooked perfectly with delicate flavors and seasonings that didn't overpower or overwhelm you.
As for the salmon, it was alright. Not my favorite on the menu, but you have to eat it with the skin.

For dessert we had 3 different types of sorbet and they gave me a little birthday dessert! The sorbet was okay-- a bit tart for my liking but it definitely was a palette cleanser for sure. The birthday dessert was my fav along with 2 other girls! The chocolate and the ice cream combination was divine! Also, the chocolate was very decadent and melt in your mouth. One of the girls noted that the chocolate that they put into this was very rich and not cheap at all and I agreed.

Great experience at DB Brasserie, and a definite must try if you're at the Palazzo/Venetian! The space was very beautiful and elegant as well. Had a bit of a casual feel with a touch of class.",Gj_uWlC10B9C-oVOMdHXdQ,1,0,4,ZtrUzQEDn6gakwNMlCBNdQ

The 16 ounce rib eye was delicious and ginormous. The duck confit that my nephew ordered was so delicious he did not offer a taste to anyone except for his mom. Of course. The salmon was well cooked and the chives were a great touch. The tuna tartare was also a success and I see why my brother devoured it.

My moms baked chicken was probably boiled in a warm water bath as it was smooth as butter.  The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and seasoned wonderfully. I love this place for their amazing renditions of some classic French dishes and although we spent $315.00 there were 8 in our party. They did not have mint jelly but perhaps it's not French?

I went to the bathroom before the server came, and she never greeted me personally, just my guest.

Then, she didn't come back until we finished our third course. Somebody else took our order.

All we had to drink was water with lemon.
The water is a pitcher on the table,  and we waited ten minutes to have it refilled, and had to ask a second time. Then the staff finds the need to top off our glasses when they seldom pass by. 
 Either do it all the time and pay attention, or not at all; at a $60+ per person restaurant, this quality of service is expected.

The food was delicious, aside from: the server asked how he wanted the salmon cooked, and we requested med-rare. Yet it came out medium, more well done than we asked.

To eat we had:
""Small Bites""
Chickpee & eggplant
Tuna tartare

The chef sent out two fried Gruyere balls as an amuse.

French onion soup
Cesar salad with pesto 

Scallops (3 for $33)

3973580,2014-08-13,1,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"I think I had high expectations of this place due to famous chef Daniel Boulod. But I didn't feel the food was anything super amazing. It was just ok. Presentation and service was top notch though. We had made a reservation for a very early dinner since we had other important activities later that night. So it wasn't very busy when we went. It's also Happy Hour till 6 daily and we were hoping to take advantage but it was only in the bar area. We ended up with a bottle of the sparkling pear cider. We had to toast to a special occasion, our friend's impending marriage. First came the water (traditional = tap water vs bottled water) and then the complementary bread - an herby focaccia type and a baguette type. Anyways just to make it easier to split the bill between our large group, we opted for the prix fixe menu. It's $48 for three courses. We tried to get a variety of different things so that we could try a little bit of everything. The first two courses had 4 to 5 options and the dessert came with 3 options. For the appetizer, I had the salmon rillettes, which is like a salmon spread. Though they didn't give us any bread or something to spread it on. The salmon was good and not too fishy. Not too salty for me (other yelpers complained about this).  Topped with some white things. It also came with spots of green sauce with capers, some sort of white foam, and a super thin slice of some kind of toast (too fragile to spread any of the rillettes on but prob just to give the dish a different texture. I tried a bit of the pate de champagne bourguignon, which was not soft and spreadable, like I was expecting. Though that did come with 2 slices of fresh bread. For the main course. I had the coq au vin, which is French braised chicken. I don't think I've had it before but it wasn't my favorite. While the chicken was tender and fall-off-the-bone, it was a little dry and the flavor of the stew didn't seep into the meat and stopped at the skin. The braise of the wine, lardons (pork fat), and mushrooms was really delicious. It also had al dente pasta and perfectly cooked carrots. It came with three pieces of chicken and I really only ate one and a half. It just wasn't my favorite. I also tried some of the steak frites and it was very flavorful and tender. As for the dessert, I had the black and white fondant over molten chocolate cake and verbena ice cream. The cake was warm and chocolately and to die for. This was probably my favorite. The ice cream was very interesting. I've never had floral flavored ice cream and we were trying to figure out the taste before just looking it up. About half the table also got the pistachio and cherry sundae. It was huge and though I didn't get to taste it, everyone looked like they really enjoyed it. The other option was the fromage/cheese plate. We were also joking with our waiter to see if could get a little something something for our guest of honor and he was able to bring us a complementary chocolate cake shot. I've never had this but it's liquor you drink and then suck a sugar coated lemon and it supposedly tastes similar to eating chocolate cake. 

I should've paid more attention but I think and want to say our waiter's name was ryan or brian. He was great and always around to answer our questions. Also there was a multitude of waiters, guys in suits, and bus people around to take way our plates, refill the water, etc. Presentation of the dishes and the table was fabulous. We definitely ate well with our eyes first. They were always bringing our food and taking the empty/finished plates away and providing us with new utensils for every course. It was all very professional. The staff was also very available to take quite a few group pictures of us, both at the table and also right outside the restaurant. It was a very wonderful experience and I would definitely be back but maybe try some other dishes. The fois gras terrine was calling my name but I would've been too full to have that and my three course meal.",shVyD312LNnLUvQEPdzo7g,2,1,3,Cuuw3M9_XwRxIXB0VK9GZw
3973974,2014-05-18,7,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"Three of us, a biker, a runner, and a hiker, met for dinner last night (5/17/14).  The runner had made arrangements with the house for a tasting menu for the three of us with specific dishes included in the tasting.  More on that later.

The evening started with our dual appetizers of Torchon foie gras and Pat√© de Campagne Bourguignon. The pat√© and foie gras were excellent with some fris√©e served with them.  We each got two slices of bread on which to spread the pat√©.  

Following this, we were brought escargots sp√§tzle with chicken oyster, garlic, parsley coulis, and hazelnut.  The sp√§tzle was soft and very tasty and the nut pieces for texture were a perfect addition.

Next came a course of sea scallops on a bed of corn.  The scallops were cooked on point and this, too, was a very tasty dish.

The the Tunisian lamb chop with some merguez sausage with cousocus, lemon braised spinach, red pepper tagine, and some chickpeas.  The chop was excellent, perfectly rare, and the spinach was very good.  The sausage had a small bit of spiciness to it.  Another winning dish.

For the last main, we got the crispy duck confit with a petite onion ring, trumpet royale mushroom, and some swiss chard and a small turnip.  Excellent duck.  

We then went to our dessert course.  We had ordered 6 items--a cheese plate with 5 selections, raspberry clafoutis, black and white fondant, Gateau Basque, ""Le Pr√©sident"", and Madeleines.  The five cheeses were: Pierre Robert Triple cr√®me, Humboldt Fog goat, Petit Basque sheep, Pennsylvania Noble cheddar, and Fourme d'Ambert bleu.  The cheese plate was served with cranberry bread, nuts, and quince preserves.  The cheese plate was outstanding!  My favorites were the triple cr√®me and the bleu.  I often buy Petit Basque so that was nothing new for me.

The desserts were quite good.  Standouts here were the Gateau Basque, ""Le Pr√©sident"" and the black and white fondant with verbena ice cream. ""Le Pr√©sident"" was a chocolate-hazelnut mousse tort and coffee chantilly.  The gateau Basque was a custard cake, brandied cherries, and vanilla Anglaise.   The texture differences of ""Le Pr√©sident""--the mousse tort with the bitter chocolate rings hiding the interior were wonderful together.  The gateau Basque was very smooth and quite a different cake than generally served.  With dessert, two of us had coffee and one had a single espresso.  

Throughout the meal, the waitstaff was excellent.  There was a little hesitancy with one server as the restaurant has only been open for about three weeks.  I was brought a fresh glass of iced tea before finishing the one I had.  Water was refilled during the meal.

The only reason I didn't give the fifth star was the mixup in the tasting menu.  The runner had taken the lead in contacting the restaurant about a tasting menu.  After some conversation, a list was sent and approved for our group.  However, two of the things we had chosen were not served and one of the appetizers we got, the scallops, was not ordered.  Additionally, we were headed from our lamb right into our dessert course skipping over the duck confit--one of the must items on our list.  When brought to the attention of our lead server, a manager came over in a short while and told us the chef was preparing our duck.

I know the restaurant has only been open a short time, but for a Daniel Boulud restaurant, when a menu has been submitted and agreed to, it should have been followed.  The serving staff was excellent.  The back of the house service needs some improvement.

The bartender was the waiter for someone at the bar, our table which was close to the bar, and a table clear across the restaurant.  They had two women just standing around near the hostess stand.  Was one of them a floor manager?  I don't know because neither one of them were moving, just talking.  Their French onion soup was truly one of the best I've ever had.  But then the rest of the meal, (a decent quiche for me and a croquet monsieur for my hubby) came out slowly and without the fries my hubby ordered.  It took us another 5 minutes just to find the bartender who was MIA.  Even the patron at the bar was wondering where he disappeared to.  Well he forgot to order the fries.  So my hubby is almost done with the sandwich and the fries come and unfortunately and obviously underdone.  Nothing worse than soggy white fries.  By that time, we weren't going to complain, since this was supposed to be a quick lunch.  What I found odd was for a restaurant that was created by a reputable chef, why weren't any of the front of the house people as well as the waiter coming by asking us how was everything?  No one asked the gentleman at the bar how his burger was either.  Well when the bartender brought us our check he took the fries off the bill.  That was nice but he didn't even ask us how our meal was?  Someone in management needs to see what the workers are doing on a Sunday morning in this place because for these prices you can't afford hiring statues.",6Bkvmbq6HY28lC-44h05XQ,0,0,2,CdEvdIRR11uHLYoLKQwFiQ

Here is a breakdown of what went wrong:

1) Entrees were late

2) Steak frite was lukewarm and served rare (ordered medium rare - I would have let this one slide, but it compounds the other issues). Both the fries and steak were lukewarm.

3) We had a super awkward runner/bus boy who stared at us while pouring water; He spilled water on the table while pouring but didn't bother cleaning it up. Also, while picking up our completed dishes, one of the knives fell on the floor, to which this person told me sarcastically, ""I got it!""

4) My wife ordered ""a glass of Chardonnay"" and we received a $16 glass of Chablis. You could probably blame this on us, but the waiter had no common sense to figure out that we likely did not want a $16 glass of wine

5) Our waiter must have been new. He seemed nervous and was rambling about the $20/oz wagyu. That initial conversation lasted about 20 more seconds than it should have. Left a bad taste for the rest of service.

What went well:

1) Steak frite was pretty good - the peppercorns gave the dish a nice bite
2) Charcuterie board was good. Nice terrine and pate. However, only 2 slices of bread and a measly amount of mustard
3) A runner named Eddie - super nice and talkative - explained the charcuterie board and brought us some extra bread. This guys deserves to be a waiter!",gJJ1goAiuhkpWsRlPTbejw,0,1,2,uZUEqODLhSA4u8ecYWTdVg

TLDR: Skip it. Daniel Boulud prices with poorly trained staff and horribly prepared meals. 

The first thing I noticed was the impressive menu and extensive wine list. We enjoyed cocktails (DB knees for me, dirty martini for my boss) and some of their fantastic bread. We shared a french onion soup, which was pretty good. 

For our entrees, I had the salmon and she had the sea bass. Unfortunately, neither of us could even finish our meal because they were both so bad. The roasted Brussel sprouts that came with mine were undercooked, and tasted like they were boiled instead of roasted (as listed on the menu). The salmon was poorly prepared and lacking flavor.

The service was the most atrocious part of the meal. Our waiter felt like a used car salesman, hard selling the most expensive entree on the menu. He took our drink order and then came back to take them again. Our booth was next to one of their computers and he would check in about our meal and drinks while there half paying attention and entering an order. And the icing on the cake was when he spilled water all over the table and a bit on my lap when filling up my glass. 

I'm not usually one to complain, but I expressed my concern about the poorly prepared meal (when he noticed both were hardly touched) and he offered dessert on the house. I ordered the souffl√©e and my boss ordered the flourless chocolate salted caramel cake. These came while I was in the restroom, and the person that poured the cr√®me anglaise simply poured it on top and let it go all down the side of the souffl√©e. The waiter came over with another container of cr√®me anglais and apologized after putting it where it should actually go. Both desserts were enjoyable though.

The check came, and the dessert was actually charged to us instead of on the house as promised. After interrupting a group of wait staff chatting about the plans for after work together at the computer by our booth, we were able to get the dessert charge removed.

Overall this experience was a poor poor representation of Daniel Boulud. I will definitely not be returning, and can't imagine why Daniel would even lend his name to this place.",tSQ2787xx_cPtH9Ke1N8EQ,4,2,2,wakaoANgab--UeE7RuuorA

I'm not sure if it was the happy hour crowd or the fact the restaurant is just off the Casino floor, but it was fairly loud. I'd definitely recommend asking for a table towards the back.

I started with the Country pate Bourguignon. It was delicious!! The meat was flavorful, the salad tart, the bread fresh and it was laid out nicely on a wooden board. I highly recommend the dish!

Sadly, I can't say the same thing about the New Zealand salmon. The sunchokes and Brussels sprouts were so hard you could barely spear them with a fork. Nothing was hot, including the salmon, and the pur√©e was blah. 

The pommes frites and amazing cheese bread saved the meal from being rather dismal.

Great wine list, but I would have preferred more French wines by the glass as it was fairly slim pickings.
 
The souffl√© looked and smelled amazing, but I was too tired to wait for one. I'm hoping to go bs k and try the dish before I leave town.

4451933,2014-12-16,4,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"DB Brasserie was the location of two very important events this December:

#1 My friend's birthday.
#2 My last meal before I had all four wisdom teeth extracted

I ate at DB Brasserie 7 days ago. It was the last ""real meal"" I have had in a week. As I type this review I have been living off of chicken broth, extra blended smoothies, hydrocodone, ibuprofen, water, and lots and lots of sleep. 

When we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess who noted I was a local, which I thought was a nice touch. We were brought into the restaurant to a round 4-top table in the middle of the dining area. Our server arrived and quickly gave us our menus, and a wine catalog. I ordered a Chardonnay ($11), can't remember which region of France at this time. 

Before our drinks came out the server dropped off some very light, airy, cheesy round breads, ""compliments of the chef"" - they were savory and light.

Next came the bread and butter plate, a decent portion with warm, spreadable butter.

Appetizers arrived in a timely fashion, we had:

Terrine of Foie Gras that comes with fig mostrada, turnips, almonds, and a balsamic, and rustic bread to supplement. The foie is meat butter if you want to get down and be honest with yourself as you slather it on the bread, top with a bit of fig and devour. 

Escargot Spatzle, our second choice of app, was fantastic. An earthy dish with many complexities to include fried chicken ""oysters"", mushrooms, garlic, a parsley sauce, hazlenuts, and of course, the snail fricassee itself. Each bite is a different medley of flavors. Make sure to get a bit of everything.

Next, both my friend and I took advantage of their Prix Fixe Menu, for $48.

I started with the country pate - pork, with pickled vegetables, comes with rustic bread (more bread!), as well as a small dollop of grain mustard. I would have killed for some more of that mustard. The pate itself was pale in comparison to the foie and the escargot I had just consumed. Not to say it was bad, but just somewhat bland.

As for the main course, both my friend and I decided to go with the server's suggestion of trout, which comes with broccoli, cauliflower, golden raisins, capers, and a brown butter sauce. As I first ate the fish it was delightful with a pleasantly crispy skin and flaky fish inside. But as I continued to eat the dish got very, very salty. Unfortunately I believe my fish was over-salted. I actually could not finish the whole piece as it was just too much.

Lastly, I had the black and white fondant, which comes as a molten chocolate cake, topped with the fondant and accompanied with vanilla ice cream. I also paired my dessert with a cup of coffee. This was a fabulous way to end the meal, as the cake was baked to perfection, with gooey warm chocolate inside and topped with the perfectly placed presentation of black/white fondant.

Overall this was a fantastic dining experience. One I would recommend to anyone looking for a moderately priced French meal in Las Vegas. I will be back... you know, after I can eat solid foods again.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,10,10,5,iOJdGlkBEWKW5saV4EZZxA

4652788,2015-05-17,0,d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q,"I remember coming here nine years ago when I stayed in The Venetian. It was during Happy Hour in the late afternoon, and I sat at the bar with a couple of my friends. Nine years later, I am doing the same exact thing with the same friends. Though, I don't think it was called DB Brasserie then.

We just ordered two items off the Happy Hour menu. The Mussels Gratin baked sweet peppers and parsley and garlic bread crumbs. The mussels were fresh, and most important, cooked extremely well. It was soft and tender and just slightly chewy. The juices from the mussels oozed out that mixed in with the garlic, bell peppers, parsley, and olive oil created a delectable sauce that was herbaceous, earthy, and with a sweet taste of the sea. A very well-prepared, and flavorful dish.

The second item was the P√¢t√© Bourguignon with a fris√©e salad, homemade pickle, bread, and grain mustard. The P√¢t√© was amazing! It was well-balanced in flavors and very tasty, and it was surprisingly light. The fris√©e salad was a little overdressed with the vinaigrette causing it to be more sour than bright and fresh. I wish I could just put everything together and eat it like a sandwich lol, but I had to share. Cutting it up, and putting it together still made a very delicious and delectable bite. The bread actually toned down the richness of the p√¢t√© and the sourness of the fris√©e. The mustard added a nice spice and slight bitterness to it. Basically, everything went well together.

The bartender was really friendly and funny. Attentiveness was lacking a bit because it appeared that he not only had to serve the diners at the bar, but also the nearby tables. It wasn't very busy, but he was a conversationalists, so I can see why he takes a while. Luckily another bartender showed up a little later, and got things going.

Overall, I've really just scratched the surface here, and just based on how good these two dishes were, I get a sense that I wouldn't be disappointed at all when I return to dig a little deeper.",0aNZMeSxwIG6N7uy3a65ig,0,0,5,LcWcxlqX3yfFhRxeg-5rWA

The food was fantastic and rarely do I fully enjoy a meal from start to finish. The restaurant is beautiful and I love the atmosphere. Great spot for lunch with friends or dinner date with someone special. Elegant, but not stuffy.

Service was wonderful. Our server was friendly and engaging. Our glasses were never allowed to empty and the wait staff worked together harmoniously.

We started with complimentary bread: Green Olive Focaccia and Baguette with butter. I'm not typically a fan of green olives nor is Ruben, however, we really enjoyed its subtle flavors in the focaccia. It was a really lovely bread. The baguette was delicious as well. Both of them worked well alone and with the butter.

FIRST COURSE

Trio of Fennel: Fennel Royal with smoked salmon, Fennel Arancini with basil aioli, and fennel and navel orange salad. What a fan and fabulous dish to honor fennel! I love fennel, so it was real treat. The royal was really creamy and very subtle with fennel; worked perfectly with the smoked salmon (I would have liked more salmon, but who doesn't?). The arancini was delightful. Miniature little fried balls of yummy and the basil aioli was great. The salad was just as fantastic; crisp, refreshing - it worked really well with the Royal and the Arancini too.

Chilled Tomato Soup: Olive, cucumber, basil, and rosemary croutons. I'm not a huge fan of cold soups (I can deal with gazpachos because they're usually served in small portions). That aside, the soup had great flavor and Ruben really enjoyed it (the man LOVES soup).

SECOND COURSE

Short Rib Tagliatelle: Braised short rib, housemade pasta, summer vegetables, basil, Parmesan, and beef red wine jus. Let me started by saying that this dish is ridiculous... and I mean, ridiculously AMAZING! I'm just gonna say it: BEST PASTA DISH EVER. I may have had a better or equally good pasta in the past, but I've forgotten all about it after meeting SRT (yes, I can call him SRT). I want to scream it from the top of a mountain, it's that good. Okay, I've gone on enough. The details: The short rib is insanely tender and the sauce is so succulent (reminded me of a bolognese, which I LOVE). And that housemade tagliatelle, oh man. It was great. Perfectly al dente, of course. There was a lot of ""Hmmmmm"" and ""OH. MY. GOD."" while eating. Do yourself a favor and order this dish! 

Chicken Paillard: Roasted carrots, sp√§tzle, hazelnuts, arugula, and sauce diable. This was very tasty, but it's a good thing I tried this before I had my pasta. Anyway, the chicken was nice and I really liked the unexpected sp√§tzle! Great sauce too.

THIRD COURSE

White Framboise: White chocolate chiffon, raspberry mousse, raspberry pur√©e, and white chocolate crunch. The dome of white chocolate chiffon was delicious. The crust was really lovely and it wasn't overly sweet or heavy. I loved the tart raspberry pur√©e and light mousse with the cake. 

Trio of Sorbets: Cucumber, Watermelon, and Cantelope with fruit relish and shortbread cookies. Adorable presentation of light and refreshing sorbets. I didn't care for the cucumber one as much as I thought I would and my favorite was the cantelope (which I would normally not lean toward). But everything was still good and I loved the fruit relish featuring the same fruits (and vegetable) as the sorbets. 

This is definitely a 4.5 - almost perfect - anchored by one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. I would come back JUST for the Short Rib Tagliatelle and gladly. Great news is that it's available on their Lunch Prie Fixe menu! In words of The Terminator: I'll be back.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,2,3,4,X-kf1xlNXipXaXbd1a4lNA

After Boulud's departure from Wynn Las Vegas in 2010 I feared I would be forced to travel away from Las Vegas to enjoy his cuisine, I couldn't have been more wrong.

db BRASSERIE, a home for Boulud at Venetian that opened last week Thursday, is a contemporary French restaurant featuring single Edison bulbs mounted to antique brass fixtures, travertine limestone panels at the entrance and four-panel, 12-foot-wide exterior doors that open to the casino.  An open yet elegant and sophisticated space.

Stealing from Clint Eastwood's playbook, let's discuss ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.""

THE GOOD.  We started with the Assiette De Fromages (a cheese plate with quince preserves, nuts cranberry bread) and I neglected all but the blue cheese as it was so delicious.  She had the Crabe & Avocat (dungeness crab, fennel, avocado grapefruit, pink peppercorn, mint) and I had the Saint Jacques √† la Proven√ßale (seared sea scallops, stewed sweet peppers, baby zucchini
green olives, pine nut persillad) - both were delicious.  I speak with limited breadth on the Crabe & Avocat, however, the Saint Jacques √† la Proven√ßale was very flavorful with each bite; yet not spicy.  Even more delightful, Chef David Middleton was about the floor and was very available to all.  Refreshing.

THE BAD.  One of the team experienced a leaking coffee pot.  Not too shabby in my book.

THE UGLY.  db BRASSERIE is located next to a bar that, during my visit, blasts 80's rock music.  Exiting db BRASSERIE, such an elegant space, I did not expect to exit and here Twisted Sister raging; I can't say this proximity is ideal.

One can't slight Daniel Boulud for a leaking coffee pot and hair band bar next door, db BRASSERIE is all aces in my book.",OdcUDgb0-oDSMvHetOSX-w,8,5,4,2O1EHiB_habSuyrsNxKXVA

Because the bartender was drunk...and not just tipsy...almost falling down drunk. When we finally got our drinks we attempted to order food, but the bartender was too impaired to take our order. Honestly, for a moment we thought we were being Punked because the situation was so ridiculous. We had to ask for a manager who came over, took our food order, and moved us to a table so we would no longer have to deal with the severely impaired bartender. The rest of our meal was slightly off because our food was delivered to our table but we really did not receive any sort of ""service."" The food was fine...nothing special.

1) The server couldn't tell my friend whether the wine she was asking about was a red or a white.
2) A couple of us had questions about the menu, and asked the server specific questions about entrees (easy questions, like, is this good? Or does it come with X?). He couldn't answer any of our questions. It was like he had never seen the menu before or had any idea what any of the items tasted like.
3) We were most of the way through our appetizers by the time our wines were brought to us (and it was not that busy when we were there)
4) The server brought me (and charged me for) the wrong glass of wine from what I ordered - one that was $5 more than the one I wanted. Despite not being able to tell me anything about either dish, he insisted I should get the one that was $12 more, and it ended up being on the mediocre side. I could have made the same dish at home and had it taste much better.
5) The busser kept bumping into me. There was no sense of personal space at all. Every time he reached in to take something it was really intrusive; I had to keep leaning away and stopping conversation to get out of his way. Once or twice is fine, but by the time the meal was over I was so annoyed. 
6) They specifically asked us whether we were celebrating a special occasion. We were a bachelorette party with the bride fully kidded out with veil and everything. They did nothing. Why ask us if you don't plan on doing anything?
7) Three of the girls ordered the desert rose cocktail. It was universally described as 'tasting like cough syrup'. Not recommended.

When the total bill is ~$500, the service, the food, and the drinks should all be good. This is not worth the price. Retrospectively, I wish I had complained to the manager while we were there, but I didn't want to do anything that would hinder our special night out. The restaurant had already done enough of that. :/

Side note: After looking at the other recent reviews...it appears that the four and five star reviews are mainly for happy hour, for dinner there are a lot more one and two star reviews. Apparently our experience was not unique.",d7DCa-j4lHGei1eIl0d3kQ,3,0,1,ITZmq0Q27MVAc14wy1P0Xw

Appetizer we ordered - 
SALMON RILLETTES(Fennel, Dill, Creme Fraiche, Crispy Baguette) I haven't had a rillette in a while, this was standard but solid. 

Melon Gazpacho (RW menu lists a cucumber gazpacho but this was different) was sweet and tangy in balance and really refreshing. I could drink a pitcher of this as it was very well made. 

Main we got -  

PEI MUSSELS (white wine, parsley, preserved lemon, french fries). Generous portion of mussels and gently steamed to where they are still tender. My one thing was a few shells were really strong in taste....it was a briny flavor I've not encountered before, slightly ammoniated and made me associate the flavor of getting crap in my mouth when I cleaned out horse stables (I volunteered at a riding ranch in HS). The not horsey brine ones were good though and the fries were nice. 

YANKEE BURGER( iceberg, tomato, vidalia onion, sesame bun, pickle, french fries) was cooked to preferred temperature right, decently seasoned, but wasn't a standout with all the burgers this town offers. 

Dessert we shared: 

DULCE CHERRY BOMB(Dulce de leche mousse, cherries, dark chocolate cake) This had nice texture but the flavors just kinda blended together in a generic way. Definitely no dulce de leche detected in the mousse. 

TRIO OF MELON SORBETS(Watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydwew, shortbread cookie) was fresh and a pleasant palate cleanser. 

Service was a bit impersonal. After we said we want to look at the RW menu the attitude changed. We werent asked if we wanted beverages and water refills came but weren't the best. I guess a 20% tip on $45 isn't worth being friendly. There weren't many tables so might as well make the most of the opportunities. Shame.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,4,3,JMHobK__sIKX8VySljB-Sw

First off our table wasn't ready when we got here when they specially told us to be there on time when we booked. I tried to get a drink at the bar and when I requested a drink that wasn't on the menu the bartender rolled his eyes and said ""I don't make that"". Ok thanks for the attitude. 

We finally get dinner. We had a large dinner which was good, brought our own wine & user the corkage fee. The main thing that I have to complain about this restaurant is the service. It took forever to get out food, our wine corked, even the initial introduction from our waitress took forever. We would request additional condiments, water or utensils from busers...and would constantly have to remind them when they returned to our table without the requested items. 

We informed the waitress after dinner and at the time we ordered coffee that we had a show to catch and would need the coffee to come out as soon as possible. We also ordered a Resling 15 minutes prior to the coffee that has not yet arrived. 20 minutes later our coffee arrive as did the Resling finally.  We total the man bringing the Resling that we didn't need it anymore because he has a show to catch and wouldn't have time. He said it would take less than a minute to open in which case I replied ""And how long do you anticipate it will take us to drink?""

This incarnation, a modern brasserie using the freshest, locally sourced, seasonal ingredients in updated, French classic dishes.  Intriguing elements in every dish brighten flavors and awaken the palate.  Add some beautifully imagined French craft cocktails; this is not your typical austere brasserie.

The requisite classics are there; a well made pate de champagne bourguignon with bits of this and that served with house made cornichons and whole grain mustard with bread, the authenticity of which is rarely tasted outside of Europe.  The obligatory shellfish plateau; a mountain of fresh seafood, begging for a glass of Sancerre.  The austere coq au vin, with it's perfectly braised pieces of chicken amidst lardoons, mushrooms and pearl onions.  All good but pale in comparison to dishes showcasing the chef's Michelin pedigree.

The artichoke veloute is incredible.  Velvety smooth.  Huge vegetal flavor of artichokes balanced with cream around a mushroom royale.  Bits of mushrooms provide texture.  A submerged ""crouton"" soaked in butter adds even greater richness.  Pair the dish with the ""Bee's Knees"" and be blown away by the complexity created by the sweetness, acidity, and richness.  The salmon rillettes, all the flavor of salmon, made smooth, rich, and creamy.  Hints of fennel add a wonderful anise notes, fried capers add texture and briny salinity.  Finally the dry aged Brandt ribeye.  Simply grilled served with a b√©arnaise sauce, more acidic and with herbaceous notes than most that heightens the nutty, bleu cheese flavor of the steak.

Tip:  Lunch is a deal.  $26 for two courses, $33 for three.

Tip:  Match a craft cocktails with each dishes.  Cocktails are extremely complex with the use of many different bitters.  Most have great acidity.  Dare I say, perfect pairings work better than wine.

Very good wine list.  Heavy emphasis on France.  Decent vintage depth.   Best ""value"" in older vintages.  

Contemporary, bright ambiance.  Excellent, relaxed service.  You would never know the restaurant has been opened for only a month.

Having visited every Daniel Boulud property in New York City, from the eponymous 3* dining room and its original 1* Caf√© home to breakfast and brunch at Bistro Moderne and Sud, respectively, it was with great delight that I learned of the chef's return to Sin City - a new Brasserie helmed by former Marche Bacchus chef David Middleton scheduled for dinner with two friends, a tasting menu presumably pre-arranged by private dining manager Heidi Voskuil.  Every bit the bustling space suggested by its name, with close set tables and traditional heavy woods beneath the sexy glow of globed lighting, it was just after 6:30pm on Saturday when our party was seated and starting off with a stunning riff on the Bee's Knees our menu was confirmed...at least conceptually...though much of what followed was not exactly what was requested and much of it was marred by still-green service.  Setting aside small mistakes on sourcing and pronunciation as well as beverages spilled more than once plus an obvious miscommunication from front of house to back about the menu requested it was with a duo of Boulud's superlative terrines that we began and with the foie gras smooth as silk while the chicken and pork pate upped the ante with an earthy funk one can only hope for this program to expands; a ""Bar Boulud"" charcuterie program like that in Manhattan's theater district seemingly a perfect choice on The Strip.  Moving next to outsourced bread and salty butter before progressing into the one-two punch of garlicky snails followed by the best scallops I've had in recent memory as the restaurant filled to perhaps 80% capacity it was in our fourth course that things got interesting; the lightly seared lamb and its spicy sausage tender and delicious but served as our ""main course"" when my request had clearly delineated the duck as a 'must.'  Eventually served the confit after much hemming-and-hawing including the involvement of the Dining Room Manager suffice it to say that the crispy-skinned fowl is absolutely worth visiting (and perhaps fighting) for and finishing the evening with a glut of sweets plus a quintet of award-winning cheeses one can only hope the service can soon keep up with the kitchen...not only does Chef Middleton's cuisine warrant it, but so does the textbook Gateau Basque.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,3,3,GGuUzZQB9ziA0iay1p0Nug

- Issouf, our server, was very personable and professional. He made sure that the visit was exceptional from start to finish. 
- He grew up in Paris so the theme of eating at a Paris restaurant, even though we barely ordered anything authentically French, was heightened. 
- He informed us on the specials. Recommendations on drinks, entrees, and desserts was presented to us very nicely. 
- The portions are small but enough for you to feel satisfied without feeling stuffed. You can always ask for more bread to fill your stomach, too. 
- Calamari was flaky. Sauce had a thai spice. Good appetizer. 
- Steak frites was great. Made medium. Tender. Comfort zone food. 
- Seafood linguini was made from scratch. Zesty flavor. Big chunks for shrimp. 
- Souffle came warm and fluffy. Sauce drizzled on top to make it fall. Tasted wonderful! Great finisher. 
- The pastry chef wrote happy birthday in cursive and Issouf gave us complimentary coffee for both of us.

I recommend the Duck Confit and Frenchie Burger. The steaks are alright. For dessert, get Le President and a Rocky Road Macaron. I love the popovers which is part of their bread service. 

However, the service is borderline rude. My friend called to confirm our reservation and that they were aware we were celebrating a birthday so we'd like something simple yet special like ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate with chocolate and a candle. The response she got was ""we already know it's her birthday."" Wow! On behalf of my friend, I'd like to apologize for bothering whoever answered the phone as I'm sure she had more important and intellectual things to do than deal with customers. When we got to the restaurant, our server seemed like she was having a bad day. A friend had ordered her second glass of wine but she only got 1.5 glasses because the bottle ran out but the server said she'll get a new bottle to fill her glass - that didn't quite happen without grief. And when the dessert came, there was nothing ""Happy birthday"" about it - no chocolate writing, no candle.

I think when you have to deal with customers, you should be allowed to ""call in bitchy"" that way you can get your act right and not piss off paying customers.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,10,7,2,3Rd6TPxdc4d3ogldR_xjJw

I like the pine nuts instead of the typical bread bites.

Every year the No1DP goes to Vegas to attend a conference related to his industry. Since the conference and his hotel room are located in the Venetian|Palazzo complex he'll look for restaurants inside the complex for quick and full service dining. Three years ago he first found this place and loved it because it was one of the quieter fine dining places boasting a decent wine selection. On his second visit he took me on a wonderful date on the condition that I keep it off-record. Shortly before this most recent visit I read that DB Brasserie was to close as chef/owner Daniel Boulud wanted to focus on his other restaurants. I suggested we dine here one last time to bid the restaurant farewell. The No1DP agreed - he also wanted to introduce his mom to Vegas fine dining to break the ice.

VENUE: The closer you are to the ""outside"" the less privacy your meal will be, but in exchange it's one of the prime spots for people-watching inside the hotel complex. It is situated right along Restaurant Row that connects the Venetian and the Palazzo. Towards the back are tables and booth space. Despite being a brasserie I was able to have a conversation with the No1DP without having to clarify every other sentence. 

SERVICE: While our server was nice she did the bare minimum because she knew as well as we did about the restaurant closing. The restaurant gave off this sad vibe and was just living out its last days until its closure at the end of the year.

The No1DP and I had mules. They were served in regular glasses and were quite unremarkable. 

- Escargots (sp√§tzle, wild mushrooms, hazelnuts, $15). Surprisingly this was my favorite dish. I haven't had escargot in years and I just loved the texture. It was quite earthy and I especially loved eating it with mushrooms. 
- Caesar Salad ""Provencal"" (tomato confit, basil pesto, rosemary cro√ªtons, $9). No1DP's salad. He thought it was okay.
- Roasted Butternut Squash Soup (spiced cr√®me fra√éche, toasted chestnuts, shaved apple, $12). The No1DP's mom's dish. She wasn't in the mood to eat very much so she got through half of her soup.
- Seared Diver Scallops (celery root & chestnut pur√©e, trumpet royal mushrooms, apple pine nut gremolata, $39) No1DP loves his scallops so it was quite a statement for him to barely touch his plate. He says they were a tad overcooked.
- Crispy Duck Confit (braised kale, caramelized onions, white beans, $32). I was already getting full from eating escargot so I only had a few nibbles of my duck confit. Duck meat was soggy and not as tasty as excellent duck confit I had in San Francisco.

Boulud closed the space because he nor the hotel could settle on a concept for the space. The chef wanted to do casual French-American while the hotel, being one of the forefront hotels for Vegas luxury wanted something more upscale to compete with the other luxury hotels offering fine dining. The No1DP speculates that due to the changing demographic of Vegas travelers hotels want to bring in more bold, unique cuisine more suitable to younger people. What will replace this space will serve up Latin-American cuisine. 

Supposedly Chef Boulud hasn't given up on Vegas just yet, he just wants to find another hotel that is more willing to accommodate his vision. I look forward to what the chef comes up with, meanwhile this will give me more reason to try his restaurants in New York, specifically Daniel.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,12,12,2,UrX0V-2ULtA9NmylR5D5pg

       I've been a fan of chef Daniel Boulud and I've been to every single restaurants he owns in New York City, as well as his former restaurant here in Las Vegas at the Wynn before. I was stoked to try this DB Brasserie.

      The space is gorgeous, spacious, elegant, and Frenchies in an Italian ispired Venetian of all hotels in Las Vegas. ""db Brasserie is Chef Daniel Boulud's new contemporary French restaurant at The Venetian¬Æ Las Vegas. The menu stays true to Chef Boulud's signature French-American cooking and modern sensibility by offering updated brasserie classics, along with three of Boulud's signature burgers featured at his restaurants New York City. Market-driven dishes, using the season's best ingredients, and a selection of elegant desserts round out the menu."" It was exactly how I would imagined it. 

       Greeted nicely by hostess Elda and Jairy, we were seated promtly with our private party. Our servers were attentive to our party. Pass Hor d'ourves were flowing out nicely and qutie a few more dishes of the night that we go to indulge. 

- P√ÇT√â DE CAMPAGNE BOURGUIGNON, homemade pickles, country bread - Oh my goodness! 

- FOIE GRAS AU TORCHON rhubarb, turnips, pistachio, frisee - California banned foie, I got to order everything with Foie Gras in it. 

- HAMACHI CRU, eggplant cumin aigre doux, finger lime, harissa, shallot  - you wouldn't believe what a 3 Michelin Star French chef can do, ORDER IT.

- SAUMON AU CHOU, Savoy Cabbage, Horseradish, Maitake, Pork Belly, Radish, Poppy Seed - love. 

- CROQUE MONSIEUR, Warm Ham, Gruy√àre and B√©chamel Sandwich, CROQUE MADAME - Topped with a Farm Egg, I just had to order this, just because. 

- Crispy Duck Confit , swiss chard, turnip, trumpet royale mushrooms, onion rings - I can eat this dish ver and over. 

- ""LE PR√âSIDENT""  Chocolate-Hazelnut Mousse Tart, Coffee Chantilly - delicious.

      We're glad that chef Daniel Boulud is back in town. This is a restaurant when I come here, I will gaurantee the food will be good, consistent, and exactly how I crave for these French dishes. 

        Chef  David Middleton executed chef Daniel Boulud 's vision well. I highly recommend it this place, good food, good wine list, unpretentious, and in a casual and comfortable setting. Service was excellent fromn start to finish, hat off to the management since DB Brasserie is still such a new spot!

For appetizer we had the charcuterie platter and the chicken liver pate. Both were pretty good and nice to share. DB Brasserie has a signature French bread that is basically a hollow bread roll seasoned with peppers and cheese. It was really unique but delicous. 

I had the seafood linguine which was decent but not like earth shatteringly good. The pasta had a unique lemon and saffron taste to it which was delicious. 

The service left much to be desired though. The restaurant wasn't the least bit crowded but service was very slow!

Appetizers-
Classic French Onion Soup 13
Besides being too salty, the soup was decent. A ton of cheese (which I personally like). 

Pate de Campagne Bourguinon 18.
The best part was the toasted country bread. The pork pate was good, and everything together was decent. but nothing special. 

Terrine of Foie Gras 24.
Again, nothing special. It was okay. Expected more. 

Oysters 18.
3 East & 3 West Coast Oysters. The west coast oysters were super yummy and fresh. The east coast oysters were creamy and interesting. One of the appetizers I would recommend. 

Escargot Spatzle 18.
Another appetizer I recommend. With the mushrooms, garlic, and hazelnut, the flavors and texture combined so well together. Yum.

Entrees-
Sea Scallops, Creamed Cabbage, Beech Mushrooms, Bacon Lardon, Red Wine Shallots 30
The scallops were cooked perfectly. Slightly soft on the inside. These were good. 

Crispy Duck Confit, Swiss Chard, Turnip, Trumpet Royale Mushrooms
Onion Rings 36
Too salty. Onion rings added a nice touch and the duck was tender, but ease up on the saltiness.

Sea bass, Roasted Squash, Wild Rice, Toasted Hazelnuts, Romesco Sauce 38.
It was a good, normal sea bass. Nothing special about it. For the price you pay, definitely not worth it. 

Alaskan Halibut, Bean Fricass√©e, Rock Shrimp, Chorizo, Saffron Potato
Black Olive Sauce 40.
Their rock shrimp looks like it was frozen. Probaby was. Again, another average dish.

Short rib, Potato Fondant, Port Braised Shallot, Carrot Coulis. 36
Dry, chewy, not tender. Didn't even bother finishing it. Oh and salty....

Linguini de sud, Lemon Saffron Pasta, Clams, Shrimp, Shaved Bottarga, Sea Beans, Wilted Arugula 28
Saving the best for last... I was lucky I ordered this one. The linguini was perfect. Slight hint of lemon, a little bit of crunchy texture, delicious clams and shrimp.. Yum. One of the best linguinis I've had actually...

Service was good, but based on the price that everyone paid, this dinner was not worth it for the quality of food you get. Will not be back. I can see why this restaurant isn't michelin rated.",RkfQX8dSJNzkAAItX326Og,3,1,2,X32abIP1f6cF8rKx3eiZBA

The restaurant itself is extremely inviting, the menu is attractive and the service was great. What else can be said?! Ordered the Steak and Frites and it was delicious, tasted very similar to  the French restaurants in Paris, mmmmm! They actually had Coravin wine by the glass which is not all that common and essentially allows the wine to be poured without displacing the cork. Made my Pinot taste delicious... Actually, the only reason that I'm subtracting a single star is because the server actually spilled the wine when he was attempting to pour using the Coravin process lol, resulting in a bit of my $35 per glass wine on the table cloth. Regardless, the overall dining experience was great and the food was awesome.

The service is top notch, and I've never had a bad meal. Yes, they're on the strip, and it can be pricey, but that's the nature of the Vegas beast.

They do have a great happy hour twice each night. One early evening, and the other late, which I love. Mind you the prices aren't as cheap as off strip happy hours, but at least it's decent for the strip. The oysters on the half shell pulls the people in quickly, and if you arrive too late into happy hour, you could be out of luck. Another item I really like is the Thai calamari. They're beer battered with pickled Fresno peppers, kaffir lime, and cilantro. Add in a cold beverage or a glass of wine, and kick back to enjoy the people watching and the sounds of the busy casino.",DgZ-_dpdjpJBjCwVdxmLFA,0,0,4,NcrFEMYIpmuGOQ-p4d1rEg

I can see how some people won't be receptive to a loud, comedic bartender in a fancy dining area, but he was great. He suggested the pumpkin ale--which I know is in season--but it was a good ale. I'm just not partial to ales with lots of hop.

My companions and I ordered a flatbread with bacon and cheese. It was good except for the fact that the flatbread was VERY thin--tortilla thin--instead of my usual BJ Brewhouse type expectations of a thick, chewy, warm flatbread. It was good just not enough to fulfill the appetite.

Other than that, there were no complaints for the place except that you can't expect happy hour time to come with a waiter/waitress even if you are sitting at a table by the bar. It will have to be the bartender.",zmOdU_artMpKrG-AWYOSPQ,1,1,4,AfzGxZ98jjCo2bp8cFnS9Q

We were running a few minutes late, so I called the restaurant to let them know, and they were fine with it.

After walking through the Venetian casino, you will find DB Brasserie nestled in a back corner with a prominently displayed ""A"" health rating.

We were quickly seated in what was about a half empty dining room, and it remained that way through our whole meal.  The ambiance is nice, comfortable seating, booths, tables, a long bar.  Water served without ice, how European.

The Cocktail Menu:
There is a good mix of inventive drinks here.  I personally had the Ex Pat, with a flavor that developed nicely as the vanilla and ginger infused ice ball melted into the straight bourbon.  I tried my friend's Manhattan, and it had nicely layered flavor.

Food:
I started with Escargot that were fried to a delicious, almost crispy chicken skin consistency.  There was also a mixture of shaved and fried garlic with normally cooked escargot.  The Foie Gras with cashew bread and a sweet chutney leveled with the salt and fat present very well.  For Main, I had the steak frites - crunchy, salty fries, perfectly medium rare flank steak.  Friend had the New York Strip cooked near rare, and it was a little tougher than it should have been in my opinion.  Dessert - Grand Marnier Souffle - delicately delicious with nice citrus notes.  ""Black and White""- decadent and very rich.

General:
No salt and pepper on the table, which is not surprising.  Background music was a good mixture which specifically included a song by Disclosure.  Service was attentive.

We visited with the place only having been open around 6 weeks.  Overall, impressed, would come back, and not worry too much about getting a reservation on OpenTable.",Jwge6DL_IuRyVhIDpL51zA,0,0,4,jv99b-HcSPljQYjSGSshyA

They also had a drink there that was very impressive.  It was basically a burbon poured over a vanilla infused ice cube.  As the ice melted, the drink got sweeter and became delicious.  That was worth going for, just in itself!",n4ZBxNksdzcFhAopOusZnQ,1,0,4,YkLXDebGF623FCjW8gvvuw

The waiter was less than attentive, drinks took forever to arrive and were highly overpriced (even for Vegas). But to reiterate, the service was the worse I have seen in Las Vegas, if not other places. In addition, our waiter seemed to enjoy his smart wit rather than helping us navigate the menu. 

As for pricing, I have not seen mark ups of 4-5 times on wine in quite a while. Totally unreasonable, again even by Vegas standards. 

Lastly, the ambiance is poor especially if you are located near the outside where you essentially feel like you are in the casino. Overall the restaurant itself is incredibly loud. Our party of four struggled to hear each other throughout the evening. I have been to Bouchon in the same Casino/Resort (Venetian) and it was quite a great experience.

Shea, the bar tender, is awesome and makes this place more than bearable. And this man can make a drink. 

We had the Croque Monsieur (turned Madame) and the Frenchie Burger. The service needs help. The side salad was plain and bland. The focaccia is sour and comes with only a little butter. They won't let you have salt and pepper at the table, weird and annoying. It's not Bouchon.

The food:
Charcuterie board - prosciutto, duck rillettes, pate. While the duck rillettes were interesting, the other items were unimpressive both in quality and flavor. The standouts were the single cornichon and the mustard, both of which I wish there had been more of.

Steak frites - the steak was tough to cut and even tougher to chew. 

Short rib orecchiette - Really good flavor and loved the thin slices of short rib, but the noodles were fairly soggy and mushy in the mouth. 

Linguine du sud - noodles were al dente perfection and so deliciously lemony, but the arugula left a lingering bitterness that deterred you from the next bite. 

Can't remember what it was called, some kind of mushroom pesto pasta - was fine, and apparently not very memorabe

We were seated right away and greeted immediately.

The ambiance:
Red Hot Chili Peppers and No Doubt - both musical favorites of mine, but maybe not so much during a pricey dinner at a white-table-cloth French restaurant.
