They took 20 minutes to give us our water on top of hour wait when they said it would be a 30-40 minute wait. We only came here because it was our last resort. We wished we just stayed at Goyemon because the wait was just as long. When it was time to have our order taken, the food took forever and they kept forgetting orders. We had to ask other servers and the only guy that was really attentive to our party was the Filipino dude (wishing we got his name because he was the only one serving us) We ordered three times and never got any of those orders we had to keep asking. The last straw for me was when we ordered edamame and the table next to us who was there long after we arrived got their edamame. Seriously, we waited 30 minutes and I had to tell them to cancel the order because at that point we were beyond upset. My sister ordered a white tuna shortly after and she never got that either. The waitress who originally served us paid us no attention after we complained that we never got any of our food.  We saw the sushi makers just standing around.  The quality of the sushi was very mediocre. The sushi rice overpowered the sushi and was too vinegary. Honestly the worst sushi restaurant we've been too! I don't normally review restaurants but the service was so horrible that I had to. And the fact that our party was a big party the tip was included.

Come to find out it was bought out by YAMA 3 weeks ago! Well, no wonder we couldn't find it. -____- But we came for sushi and we were already there, so we decided to try it out. Same decor & layout as Doh previously had it, just different menu...

We ordered:
ROLLS:
- No name roll x 2
- Wet dream 
- Turning Japanese 
- Yama crunch 
- Eel nigiri x3
- Salmon nigiri x2
APPETIZERS:
- Baked green mussels x2 (4 pieces each order)
- Soft shell crab x2
- Dynamite
- Miso soup
- Edamame 
DESSERT:
- Green tea mochi
- Strawberry mochi 

Wasn't too impressed with the menu selection, but did like that each specialty roll on the menu had a little picture so you had an idea of what you are getting. Also, dinner is also only $23.95 (most AYCE sushi places are around $27)! Service was very attentive, but we did have 3 different people checking up on us -- so we often had to say, ""Oh, we already told the other server."" Made it a tad confusing at times. But overall, a decent dining experience... just nothing I would go out of my way for.

PRO TIP: Order half rolls so you can try different ones out. That way you get 4 pieces versus 8 if you end up not liking it. And if you do like it, you can always order more!",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,3,4,3,FicS51adjBv9SwEk_sPfEw

However; sitting at the sushi bar, we frequently found ourselves with empty plates, looking longingly at the sushi chefs - trying to get some attention. We had to actively flag down waitstaff to get refills on water or tea.

It wasn't a particularly crowded or busy evening. When someone is three feet away, and repeated ""Excuse me's"" are not acknowledged... Well, we definitely felt ignored.

The food...
eh.... on the average side of average.
The nigiri pieces were decent sized, but the rice would not hold together, and was fairly bland. The rolls are exactly what you expect at this kind of place - funny names, but no more than serviceable as food.

We had came here on a Tuesday night, seated fairly quickly as soon as we arrived. We had ordered some stuff to test out the place. Tuna, White Tuna, Yellow tail, salmon, sweet shrimp, giant clam, ikura, uni, tuna poki salad, soft shell crab, agedashi tofu, hamachi kama, dynamite, salmon skin hand roll, custom handroll consisting of salmon, avocado, and ikura. 

Out of the top items ordered, the best was...... the custom hand roll. Belly portion of the salmon so a fatty piece of salmon with ikura and avocado. The salmon nigiri was decent but only 2 of the 4 pieces. 2 were ok fatty, 2 were lean. 

Worst? tuna poki. dont know what the heck they used in terms of sauce but it was gross. Not any kind of poke i've ever had. Seemed like a variety of sauces mixed with each other. Flavors dont meld well together. Was spicy, salty, weird bittery taste. I dont even want to think if the tuna was fresh or not.

Hamachi kama was huge but flavorless. Wasn't seared/broiled enough. 

Nigiri overall, the rice was gross. Mushy. 

Yellowtail had some ponzu sauce over it with green onions. 

Giant clam (geoduck) is not fresh. Does not have that ""crisp"" feeling. Kind of mushy. 

Salmon skin handroll consisted of bitsy pieces of salmon with little skin. Not crispy at all. Salmon meat way more than skin.  Should call it a cooked salmon hand roll

Not a fan of rolls to begin with so didnt order any of those. Didn't see anything that stood out that wasnt covered in sauces or weird. 

The soft shell crab had a weird batter. Very different from what you'd find from other restaurants. Theirs flakes off too easily. 

Service wise, it was attentive in some aspects but unattentive in other aspects. It took a while for us to get the check and dessert but they were fairly good with refilling tea and taking orders. 

Overall, meh. Definitely not a fan of this place. Not for those who are interested in nigiri. Rolls and what not may be better but not my cup of tea. Not to mention the parking is horrible at most meal times here.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,2,2,OgeoEhlybQP5HbpmJ4oZCQ

Since its All You Can Eat, i expect bad sushi rolls and poor aperizers. I was wrong.

Sushi rolls were great, service was stellar, aperizers was suprisingly addicting plus free 2 scoop ice cream and mochi. Great deal!

AYCE for $23.95 per person

I don't know if it's the servers fault or the chefs, but a lot of times I never get what I ordered. Dishes are missing and I have to reorder again and again. Next is the rice, it is soggy and crumbling when you pick it up. One last thing is whenever my family gets seated, the seat is always dirty! There's crumbs of food and that irritates me so much.

I like their customer service a tad bit more than the original though 'cause it has more space and less crowded to give their wait staff more time to pay attention to you. At least that's how it was for me and the fiance when we went around 5:30PM on a Friday.

The food was great however the seat attendant told us it would take 20 minutes before we could be seated ended up being well over an hour and a half. 

After we got a table, one of the waitresses was placing a Styrofoam cup of apple juice on the table when it tore & spilled onto my daughter and niece. Just thanking God it wasn't a hot beverage. We didn't blame the waitress, but hoping the restaurant can invest in some higher quality products. 

There was a bit of attitude from the waitresses while taking our orders as well. My 2 year old is a picky eater, but she loves the miso soup with the extra tofu (that's all she eats at Sushi restaurants) so I specifically asked for it. When it came out, It was evident the bowl did not have much tofu. My daughter finished it quickly and asked for more. I asked the waitress for another bowl with more tofu than the last. And she told me they're working on it and rolled her eyes.

First off the space, so much room! Wide sushi bar, and plenty of tables. Several sushi chefs, and plenty of staff who check up on you, I think that's wonderful! 

Sushi is tasty, and comes out fast. They have all the rolls they had before at the other location. Appetizers/sides are a miss for me here. Chicken skewers are hard to chew and dry, I don't recommend it at all.
The hamachi kama and salmon kama was disappointing, both were incredibly small and dry. 
Seafood salad has shrunk considerably.

For starters, why wasn't a new Yelp page made for the new location?
DOH wasn't that great but why confuse people and not differentiate the two? Have Yama really earn their reviews and stars instead of reflecting off of DOH or mixing the two!
The place still felt like DOH, but with Yama menu, I'm sure they're still working on it.

The waiters/waitresses were attentive and friendly but I didn't like how it seemed like they were yelling every time someone walked in.
Maybe tone it down to a 5, since everyone working has to greet anyways, lol.

Now about the food..
My all time favorite (and would probably crave here and there) is the ""Wet Dream"" roll! Baked, cream cheesy, shrimpy goodness!
Then maybe ""No Name"", then ""Sun of the Beach"".

Their nigiris looked good, not too much rice and fish looked fresh, but I am more of a roll type of person! They also have a good amount of appetizers or sides to choose from.

This is my family's favorite spot to eat and it saddens me that they have missed the mark with us twice in a row. I definitely understand being busy, but in my opinion it comes down to the servers and sushi chefs lack of communication. I've had to place orders in numerous times only for them to never make it to our table. Manwhore was made poorly and not baked long enough. Long wait to get seated, longer wait to get your food. 

The reason this review is getting only 1 star is because they charged me 107.92 the first time because their cashiers put in a tip in the wrong amount. Although they voided it out and charged the correct amount I would have appreciated being in the loop rather than waiting for 20 minutes for our check and an explanation as to what's going on. A dismissive sorry and refusal to give the managers name did not make the situation any better. 

I will say if you are lucky enough to have the young Korean lady as your waiter your experience will be nothing like this. She always remembers my son when we come in.

The other Yama location is soo packed that I always feel claustrophobic there. This location is bright, airy, and modern. I really enjoyed that aspect. The menu is the exact same and I even recognized some of the same sushi chef's from the other store. However, a lot of the food was different to me. The ponzu sauce on the seafood salad, for example, tasted different. Not as citrus-y. The rolls appeared to be cut smaller as well. For this reason, we ordered 2x the amount of rolls than we normally would. Pricing for lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $23.95 which is extremely reasonable! 

I love that it's AYCE and you can get anything on the menu. First time there? I gotchu. Start with a seafood salad either mild or hot if you like spice. Then if you're into apps, the sesame chicken is good, as well as the tempura shrimp.  Then, bring on the rolls. My favorites are:

Happy Rainbow
Sun Of The Beach
Wet Dream
No Name
Ellen Roll
Harry Potter

I ordered some nigiri, and I was wondering why it took so long. Then I got excited because I saw it finally coming and they put it down at another table that got seated after me. Then I realized, they forgot my order. When I reordered it wasn't too long before they brought my order over. The dessert menu is tiny. They only have 6 things. 3 different flavors of mochi, and 3 different flavors of ice cream. My friends didn't like the texture of the green tea ice cream. I enjoyed the strawberry mochi and the pistachio ice cream. The parking wasn't the greatest. I was able to find a spot, but they weren't extremely busy. I could see it being a problem on busy nights. 

When it's your birthday, which it was for the table next to us, they play the birthday song through loud speakers throughout the entire restaurant. This is good for a sushi restaurant. Usually they don't make a big deal about birthdays. I'm not sure if it was a trick candle, or if the lady was just older, but it took her about 6 tries to blow out the candle they gave her. So be ready! 

All in all the food was good quality, and I love how you can order half rolls! The garlic tuna and salmon were good! Also, it is the next morning so it's safe to say, no food poisoning. It's good to be able to trust a sushi restaurant! I'd go again for that sun on the beach roll!",J2qXjEscZeBOT8MWY_MV4w,0,1,4,H4hoq9RdyBFa4FRXa47Z6w

They were still remodeling from Doh's original setting so ambiance was a little ... Unorganized which is understandable. I love that they kept the bookshelfs, very homey feeling...

We went for my birthday dinner around 7pm, party of...5 adults and my 5 y.o son.   The place looked pretty empty so We were seated immediately.  Servers were nice and attentive for the most part.  When we eat sushi we always do AYCE, so we ordered quite a bit.  Rolls started coming in pretty quick.  They were Good, but nothing to rant about...I was mostly excited to try the Baked Mussels (these are one of my favorite dishes when i go out to eat sushi/seafood)... And I must say when they arrived, they looked good.  But after tasting them , I was sadly let down, the excessive amount of sirracha on top was just unnecessary.. To put it simply, i didn't like it.  

I'm also going to say, beware of their spice meter, (little chili emojis in their menu) we ordered a roll that had a level one spice and it literally was like fire in our mouths.  While another roll that was level three spice tasted like nothing.  

All in all, would come here again, only
Because it's decent sushi.  But it's no longer my favorite sushi spot....",NPNgrVURNstd7GgtzQcEpw,2,1,3,7mdtkLvfLLMuodyoM3s4cg

Looking around, one thing that really surprised me was the decoration. I was surprised to see that the overall look of the place certainly did not match the whole- sushi aspect- of this sushi restaurant. There were bookshelves and it almost seemed as if this restaurant was first deemed to become a cafe of some sort. Just a random observation.

TNT, Firecracker, No Name and Happy Ending. Of course, the Seafood Salad.

Service is the same, still attentive and caring. But what knocks it down from a 4* to a 3*? It no longer has that home-y feel. The mom and pop store ambiance. It's commercialized or feels like a franchise.

The All You Can Eat (AYCE) menu seems to be similar from what I can remember at the other location. They also have a separate menu for those doing a la carte, which one of my three friends did. Among the things we ordered some of them were: baked green mussels, takoyaki, different types of nigiri, the Wet Dream Roll (one of my favorites), the Double Dragon Roll, and mochi ice cream. The rice to fish ratio is good to where the rice doesn't take the bulk of the sushi piece.

I wish they had a larger dessert menu. Ice cream and mochi ice cream is what I usually get, but it's nice to have other options just in case I want to try something else. Overall, I'd say it's a good place to go to.",1EHzfDx_pZuhWxdc9XoZog,1,0,4,fyNvAk36D6jsFvs7txY1PQ

I did the AYCE and it was very much worth the price. It was very fulfilling with the good variety of sushi. For desert, I was able to choose a scoop of ice cream, and one mochi ice cream, among other deserts. All were cold and refreshing.

This new Yama on Spring Mountain is also just as good. More spacious than the other Yama (I believe it used to be Doh sushi and tapas? I remember the set up being very similar), but with the same good sushi chefs and fish :) the menu is the same as the old one, but I felt that this one had a lot of character as far as the servers (cool names btw)! The Servers were very attentive asking if we needed anything and how things were AND they didn't rush us when ordering food. The food that we ordered came out SUPER QUICK. The appetizers actually did come first, which is  different because they normally take longer because they're fried, and then alllll the rolls and nigiri we ordered came together. (granted, we always order a lot up front because they take a while, but this place was on point). 

(However, the only bad part about everything coming at once and then ordering more at different times is that things tend to get lost. My friend order 3 more items, all of which did not get to us by the time we decided to get the bill and dessert. )

I would definitely come back just based on the sushi and the service (just make sure to keep track of your orders!), and now I might always go to this location for the speed :)",sGIGOFKg_yTd76cDPs6pjA,2,2,4,__MbS1M0ilooBXA3SwFB3w

I know people probably think they are going to share the food or something but it doesn't always work out that way. We got our food really fast and it was delicious.

2965999,2017-12-28,12,wdOOK3K6vzQy1d_OIk-U9w,"Yama Sushi is an AYCE sushi restaurant, though you can also order a la carte...But by the time you order a couple of dishes from menu you may find out you are better with the AYCE pricing: $20.95 for lunch and $23.95 for dinner. The set price seems to be the way to go here. 

Located in the very heart of Spring Mountain, Yama brings in a lot of foot traffic, so it can be quite busy here. For the record, it is not my typical choice for sushi, but it was already chosen by a good friend of mine.  The inside of Yama is very clean, even the air was absent of any fishy odor, which is often the signal for me to leave, without looking back...but on this day, you guessed it, I stayed.

While my guest ordered many different rolls and enjoyed them very much, I ordered Nigiri Sushi. I am not a fan of rolls in general, especially those drizzled with sauce, so I have nothing to say about the rolls here, I simply avoided them. As is often the case, some items are restricted to only one order per person, such as Uni, Sweet Shrimp, Giant Clam, etc.

A typical issue with AYCE Sushi restaurants is that they want you to fill up fast...they put too much rice on their rolls and Nigiri...not at Yama Sushi. Perfect amount for each bite!! 

The service was attentive and friendly. They don't rush you, but they are not slow to take your order either.

So, if you need a spot for AYCE and want the option of rolls, nigiri, and sashimi, this might not be a bad option for you.

This was around 1:30pm and there were still a lot of people eating.  The place was not too noisy and clean.

Not much of a sushi person, we each ordered a bento box.  For less than $9.00, we got miso soup, salad, rice with salmon and Korean bbq.  They were outstanding and fresh.  We also ordered spider roll for appetizer and it was so delish.

Service was excellent.  Waitresses checked on us often and hot tea was poured consistently.  The ambiance was great and we will definitely come back and try AYCE next time.

Walking in, the place was big compared to a lot of the sushi places in town. Probably could fit twice the amount of people. 

One of the workers was mopping which already gave me a bad vibe. Don't you usually mop before you open or after you close? It had a strong smell of bleach, which I am not fond of, especially while trying to eat. 

Service was great! Water was refilled quite quickly, food was served pretty fast, and the ladies were always checking up on us, asking if we needed anything. 

First up, some nigiri. Ordered the super white, yellowtail, eel, salmon, and albacore. Like another reviewer said, the rice was definitely not sushi rice. I usually order a ton of nigiri but these just were not cutting it. Slices were a bit more chewy than normal and if it came with a sauce underneath the rice, it over saturated it. 

Second up, Uni. Now I've had some good and bad Uni and these were on the border. For me, I think Uni has a creamy texture with a buttery finish. These had a watery creamy texture with a fishy finish. 

We also got the baked green mussels which had their version of a vinegar based sauce on it which were ok. 

The best thing we ordered were the kalbi or short ribs. Can't really go wrong or mess those up.

Service was variable. Initially, servers were very attentive and refilled waters and took orders, but later on during our meal, we had to work a little to flag people down. Nonetheless, the service provided was fine, and you don't really get assigned a single waiter/waitress.

The menu is fairly extensive and everything is included in AYCE (except some items can only be ordered once). I like the variety of items here, between appetizers, nigiri, and rolls. The quality was decent for all you can eat, and price around $25 per person for dinner.

First impression sucked w the staff. A friend had gotten a table first and my bf and I came in a couple minutes later. Waitress asked if we were ready and I said not yet. She said she'd be back but never came back. Had to try and flag someone down after 20minutes. It's like we were invisible in the area they sat us at which is once you enter the restaurant, all the way to the right in the corner. I'm not sure how many times I've waved my hand and the waitress just doesn't pass our table or just doesn't look over. 

Food was not that great. Rice had a strong vinegar taste to it, I think they went vinegar happy or something. The amount of rice in a hand roll was just absolutely ridiculous. There was so much rice, the roll became unenjoyable. We literally ate just the section w the fish/veggies along w some rice and there was still a good chunk of it left. The miso soup was sooooo salty. 

A few of our orders never made it to the table even though we mentioned it 2-3 times.

My favorite sushi options are always something with unagi.  The MOST popular one is the ""no name"" which is #24. I see why everyone gets it. it is sooo flavorful and captures unagi with salmon and shrimp tempura. Mmmm. I also like their #34 Spicy Sexy Roll for their take on spicy sushi, and really, almost anything here is good. I just don't care for deep friend rolls.

Some rolls were smaller and not as detailed, like the philly roll and the unagi. I thought it still tasted fresh, not like a sushiland. But I think b/c they strive to be quick, the details get lost.

Just a note that this is all you can eat for only certain items on the menu. There are limits on the more desirable menu items. Uni, giant clam, etc. 

Totally understandable except for when the waitress continues to take your order for said items and does not ever return. A bus boy ended up checking up on our order only to find out it was never put in after we patiently waited 30+ minutes. The manager apologized and explained sometimes the waitress make mistakes and take orders they shouldn't. 

It happens but shouldn't our table have been notified so that we could re-order other items instead of our waitress ""disappearing""? Seems like a total move to reduce the amount of food our table could order.

Personally, I love the new look. Came here on a Saturday night and was seated 20mins later on CES weekend. Since every restaurant on Spring Mtn had a wait, we looked no further. Everything seemed promising until I was handed over a dirty menu with soy sauce stains all over it. My miso soup tasted like bleach. I had also ordered a few nigiri rolls with Quail egg at an extra charge- but it somehow came out not inside the roll. Not sure why the server didn't even apologize or offer to make me another one. 

Me and my boyfriend also couldn't help but notice how every single roll going out to tables were abnormally ginormous... with too much rice. Like a ridiculous amount that I could possibly be full after 2 rolls. Wow Vegas, you like this kinda AYCE? You like to eat ALL YOU CAN EAT RICE?  

Cute server uniforms, creative name badges, water and tea refilled spontaneously. Pretty wall they had installed on the right which looks like you're somewhere in the Himalayas. Other than that, will not be coming back.

What ordered:

Fried green mussels
Mix poke salad
Seafood salad
Salmon kama
Miso soup
Tofu agedashi
Soft-shell crab

Negiri -

Salmon
Yellowtail
White tuna
Uni
Sweet shrimp with head
Albacore
Salmon roe

Sushi -

Double salmon hand roll
Spicy tuna roll
Ellen roll
No name roll

Desert -

Green tea ice cream
Mango mochi

I'm pretty sure that I'm missing more. But yes, we are now back to being regulars here. Fish to rice ratio is perfect. The baked mussels compared to Kaya is so much better. Not drowned in the cream cheese sauce and use whole mussels, not combining small ones to make it look huge. Timing on distribution was immaculate considering we order alot. As soon as a plate left, another took its place. No cluttered table, and no empty glasses. For the price point, value and quality, Yama hit the spot this night.

I occasionally go to this sushi spot and had been here since they have opened a few years ago, and I they have improved. Parking is pretty difficult to find, especially on weekends but the wait time at this place is short. Whenever I get there it is empty or I get there before the rush starts. 

They have a modern touch to their environment and I really like the ambiance. Since I have been there I have not experienced a stable server, which is fine because every server around (although they are assigned) are easily accessible if we needed a refill on a drink or to place another order. Portioning is a lot to me and they do not offer half sized rolls upon me asking so beware of that. I really love their garlic tuna out of everything else on the menu and when it comes to dessert their ice-cream banana tempura is delicious. The banana tempura is a part of the AYCE (TYJ!!!) usually some places only limit you one mochi per person but they do not do that with the tempura.

Like other ayce the rolls are available for half size which is about 4 slices. The uni here was surprisingly not that fishy and the giant clam was fresh! Definitely get the sweet shrimp too! The fried shrimp head was such a great surprise!

Garlic tuna was good but don't dip it in soy sauce... there is already sauces on it and if you do then the sushi becomes way too salty.

The only negative thing was a weird smell in the restaurant... it wasn't Clorox smell but it wasn't entirely a nice smell either. I randomly smelt it while I was eating and it kind of brought the experience down.

It causes the rice, which was rather chewy, to crumble upon pick-up and impossible to stay together. It all just fell apart. All the rolls ended up tasting the  same. No matter what different ingredients, they all just tasted like vinegar. Maybe the fish was smelly, and they did this to disguise it? Tempura was lukewarm and chewy/old tasting. Green mussels were the equivalent of chewing an ear. Firecracker had dried out overcooked spicy tuna inside that they tried to hide with a quart of mayo.

It was funny because the whole time we felt that we had 5+ servers for our table since they all kept stopping by our table making sure we were alright, taking our orders, dropping off the food, refilling our drinks constantly etc! The food came out super quick as well which was a huge plus considering our AYCE sushi experiences have us waiting years for our food to come out! 

Overall, the food was just ok. The miso soup was very salty which made it hard for me to eat. Their dessert selection wasn't very appealing for they only had ice cream and mochi. I was really looking forward to some tempura type of dessert but sadly that wasn't on the menu. Rolls that were great were the ""Harry Potter"" and ""No Name"" so I'd give those a try!

But I judge a sushi place based on their nigiri, and I'm sad to say I was disappointed here. The sashimi pieces were rather dry and the rice was lacking in flavor, like not enough rice vinegar. Their menu for nigiri was rather small, not as much variety that I'm used to, and missing some standards in my opinion. But they have a large variety of cooked rolls. The rolls, however, were really delicious and kind of what saved this place for me, 3 stars instead of 2. Their baked and deep fried rolls all sound amazing on the menu, and the flavor doesn't disappoint. But again, if I don't like the nigiri, I feel like I wasted my time. I don't really eat rolls at all, but I felt the need to try them here to really get the value for what I paid ($23.90 AYCE dinner). 

The service was great, orders were taken and delivered promptly. All of the servers were really nice and attentive, and I thought it was cute how all their name tags are cartoon characters.

There are plenty of nirigri options and the lunch menu really isn't that different than the dinner (highly recommend coming for lunch, so you safe a few $$). The specialty rolls are great and I love that you can order half rolls of pretty much anything! That way you can try them all and not worry about trying to finish everything.

I love the fish quality here. I've never had anything short of fresh and delicious. Their nigiri uses a little bit of rice, unlike some places that try to fill you up with cold, hard chunks of rice and charge you for it!

Service is always quick, even when they are busy. They're also very friendly whenever I come too.

Pro tip: if you want to try and space out your food but don't want to wait to order, make sure you order some nigiri and non baked items at the same time as the deep fried, or specialty things. This makes all the food come out in small batches, but you only have to order a couple of times and you don't have to try and flag down your server!

Since it was just the two of us we told the hostess we'll just sit at the sushi bar. They weren't too busy for being on a Saturday night.. no wait for a regular table and pretty open seating. When we got to the sushi bar the sushi chef Ginie I believe his name was greeted us immediately. He was very nice and attentive. We had ordered two rolls and got them super quickly, but we didn't even have waters or anything, while we've already been sitting at the empty sushi bar for 15 minutes. Nearly done with our rolls I had to stop a waitress to ask for water.... and only 2 mins after I asked another waitress came and asked if anyone got our drink order. Thanks but, you were 15 minutes too late. The food was delicious, but service was nothing to return for.",xRZBVvCJy8LOefuwgb99Rg,2,0,2,ycCDe-kONLlRV4rIogRFQg

This was his first time here and was he wow'd. I had take him to Goyemon for his birthday last year and he was impressed but this place just blew him away. The service was very good and attentive. We noticed they all had nicknames so our mission that night was to find out all the different names floating around. All their dishes were on point as far as tastiness and freshness. It kept up to the same level as their primary location if not more, because the staff at this location was a lot more customer service oriented. The only thing I found disappointing was the limit on one type of dessert- you can only get one mochi and one scoop of ice cream rather than two mochi's or two scoops of ice cream. When did that change?  Either than that, everything was FABULOUS!",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,12,12,5,yMWUN8qa3bkBhkOSwPF85A

Maria was our waitress. Carlos was super nice and went above and beyond with us, he needs to become a manager, only good service!!",syU8jzVhL1iY_iOa9MPojQ,0,0,3,65TG2UJCPQk3lx2-TneQJA
