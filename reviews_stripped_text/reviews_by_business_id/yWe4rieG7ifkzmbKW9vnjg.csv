Compares pretty nicely against the food options at Sunset Station and some of the other ""nicer"" Henderson casinos, and the property itself is pretty legit. Definitely recommend.",rUGOSq13jxpuYZ9OTRakJg,0,0,5,AcPWRKnd4H6Z64Iy6cC-qA

I ordered the carne asada burrito (and you know that's the thing I check for first usually if you are a Mexican establishment) with rice and beans. The burrito was average but the thing that didnt set well for me was their rice. It tasted like it was out the box.  This place has a long way to go to beat Vivo Michocan, Fausto's, Super Mex,etc...",-gfC7auUsRN2KqTBzHMBZg,0,0,2,mvezBWFqq1hQ800H93iyCQ

4693391,2008-12-29,1,yWe4rieG7ifkzmbKW9vnjg,"We started off with Mango Margaritas, the obligatory salsas and chips and a delicious (complimentary) tortilla soup.  Our entrees were Red Snapper Coscina - saut√©ed red snapper filet with a zesty tomato and cilantro sauce accompanied by rice and homemade refried beans. A picture of our entrees may be found in Webster's Dictionary under the page heading ""Mediocre"". We concluded the meal by sharing a caramel flan that was too dense, but very tasty.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,1,0,2,UxLiPXkpSDuj9TB6dYwbXw

I got the shrimp fajitas and was amazed the huge shrimps I got, yummy... Lots of onions and some bell peppers, which I know come with it , but really do not partake.. The rice was a little stiff, not soft and fluffy..
And the chips with bean dip was yummy too, and change from the salsa mix...
the extra star for service....",SnW3DwEKu_LWeuYnS1AMaw,0,0,4,4yOceM9cHoP9Q8tmfgCF-A
