Spicy and not overly sweet, and major bonus points for being able to order it with almond or soy milk.  The chocolates here are also great- the s'mores bar is graham cracker-y, peanut buttery amazingness.  Definitely a spot worth checking out.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,4,3,5,uvYEVAqZYIrfcSk6VHrZoA

85499,2015-06-22,0,7P3Z4HTUM8M8Y9Yw3cc7Pg,"Wow. This was literally the most amazing thing. So this was the first time i had ever had a truffle (they're like a cake in the inside). I had a red velvet cake truffle and a peanut butter truffle. The twist is that these truffles had LIQUOR in them! I guess I shouldn't be surprised since this is vegas, lol. But the chocolate was super high quality- and I'm a bit of a chocoholic. The red velvet cake had brandy in it and the peanut butter had amaretto. I don't drink much, but the alcohol wasn't overpowering, just enough to give it flavor. Soooo good I almost melted when I ate them. Pure decadence.

The iced ""Allie Baba"" drink is my favorite. It's a great blend of white mocha and salted caramel. Andrew (the barista) makes it perfect every  time! As for sweets -- I love the homemade peanut butter cups! You also can't go wrong with the white chocolate caramel nut popcorn. The gluten free chocolate chip cookies are amazing too.

296217,2014-05-24,3,7P3Z4HTUM8M8Y9Yw3cc7Pg,"Nothing vegan here except for coffee and an overpriced cup of instant oatmeal.  Trays filled with beautiful looking pastries and truffles and not one vegan. When I asked if any were vegan, I got the reply ""No, but we have gluten-free"".  Umm... NOT. THE. SAME. THING.  Great way to turn off vegans from returning.

$5 for a little cup of instant oatmeal made with almond milk instead of water? Not even an ubiqutious ""grilled veggie sandwich"".  Coffee was OK but reminded me of instant.  You know, when you pour hot water into instant and you get that brown foamish ring at the top?  When I order coffee at other shops, I don't get that ring from fresh-brewed/poured coffee.  Maybe it was steamed to make it hotter?  Who knows? 

It was OK for an one-time stop, but I'll stick to Sunrise simply for having more vegan options (like pastries and sandwiches) and better tasting plain coffee (and additions like agave).",VrAo40MP-MaHzJb9aSypnA,1,2,2,QbgG22Zy67pBeHL78PdidQ

The barista made three mistakes on the order of 4 items. The decor is bland, and AC is up too high. The seats were comfortable, but frankly my recommendation is get the truffles in a bag and go to Starbucks.  Or even Dunkin Donuts. 

These guys apparently make the truffles for a bunch of places in town, so they are pretty good, but they don't know the coffee business.

555915,2013-06-10,0,7P3Z4HTUM8M8Y9Yw3cc7Pg,"Locally owned coffee shops are a rarity in Vegas, so the fact that this one exists is, in itself, a nice thing. However, as far as coffee shops go, this one is pretty low on my list of good coffee shops in Vegas, even lower on the list that some of the larger chain brand coffee shops.

Food - avoid it. They get sandwiches and salads pre-made and stored in their refrigerator with not a clear answer as to how old it is. Upon eating one, it really lacked in quality, it was smooshy and tasted old. 

Truffles - never had any, but Tipsy Coffee is a breakout from the Tipsy Truffle makers. They seem to be quality made and have enough of a following to allow for a coffee house venture to be afforded, so they can't be all that bad. 

Coffee - seriously meh. They have a lot of custom coffee creations but are frequently inconsistently made depending on who the barista is. As I look at the iced mocha i purchased, I can see powdered chocolate sitting unstirred at the bottom of my cup. Quality here is consistently questionable even after they have been open for better than 8 months. They might want to stick with truffles. 

Atmosphere - frustratingly disappointing. This has the potential to be a nice place to get some work done. They offer free wifi and have a large work table with a convenient tabletop power supply hub and USB. The furniture is good for lounging and works well enough. My bigest complaint are the big screen TV's playing FOX NEws. Politics aside, when I choose to get away from the hustle of the day and go someplace relaxing to get a little work done or have a nice chat with a friend, the last thing I want is to be inundated with an antagonistic news channel coming at me from two directions, albeit muted, nonetheless personally annoying. If my battery weren't about to die, I would definitely spare myself from the onslaught of fear journalism.  When I first came here near to their opening, I suggested putting something more universally friendly on the TV's if they HAVE to have them on, the manager literally laughed and shook his head when I suggested the Planet Earth series  as an example of an alternative.

Located in a business complex with several health related business and next to a hospital, this shop has a relatively captive audience and a wonderfully niche potential to be something great in a city where local coffee shops are a rarity. Unfortunately, it falls seriously short on execution and chooses to aim for the bottom of its customers expectations rather than aspiring to something greater.",fR3PYzwhJPMxadF4Ak__Xw,2,1,2,KeiqoyWAXW998hhHzuwd3Q

687953,2016-07-28,0,7P3Z4HTUM8M8Y9Yw3cc7Pg,"My husband and I stopped here for coffee before going to the water park.  I ordered the Cookie Butter Latte and a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a croissant.  My husband had a regular coffee and the spinach, egg and cheese on a bagel.

I enjoyed the latte and felt the flavors were pretty balanced.  The sandwich was awesome.  The eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly and felt very fluffy and light.  I thought there was a bit too much cheese on the sandwich, particularly after it had started to cool down, so I ended up taking some of it off.  My husband had the same thoughts about his sandwich, but we both really enjoyed them and it was almost too much food for us to eat at breakfast.  My husband said his coffee was great, but noted there wasn't any creamer or milk.

Service is a little slow.  I don't know if the lady at the counter was working by herself or not, but it took awhile to get the drink and then the sandwiches out.  She was kind enough about it and asked if everything was okay once we got our food.  Just something to note if you're in a bit of a rush.

We'll probably stop by here again on our next trip.  I didn't get a chance to try any of the pastries or desserts and they looked very tempting.",goNQjuLSXSYdNKPJQKKv3A,0,0,4,k45cOvF98EczjBrrf_1fdg

Tipsy uses the coffee from Sunrise cafe. The owner is extremely friendly and the customer service from the staff is EXCELLENT! I came in my first visit and left feeling like a regular! 

Her pastries are great and go well with the coffee. I've enjoyed everything from her coffee to lattes. Drink up and support your local privately owned businesses!!! :)",QMc9ImKGo5X4zuKHjs4kOA,7,3,5,rPWjasD1RqYt_Hf_XVeXog

A quaint place that offers up different coffee drinks other than the same ol', same ol' of Starbucks.  I was greeted immediately by a friendly employee. I think she was actually the only one working at the time.  She showed me the menu of the unique items they had to offer.  Plus it didn't hurt that their treats were nicely displayed next to the ordering counter.  There were also fresh croissants and other breakfast items. Everything looked very tempting...  but my will power kicked in.

They had many drinks that were made with Nutella.  I decided on the 'Salty Scottie' ~ A Nutella latte with salted caramel.  My drink was finished quickly and went in for a taste.  So delicious! A different flavor with the Nutella.  It was my first time trying something with that and was very happy that I did.

As I was waiting for my latte, I noticed a large dining area with couches, comfy chairs and many tables.  The area was very clean and tidy with windows surrounding so it lit the area nicely.  

So if you happen to be in the area, stop in for a great coffee drink!  They also offer lunch specials with a sandwich, chips and drink ~ so  maybe next time Tipsy!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,11,4,4,hin2kQK8SjUeWiFVDGS0lg

Wild Willie's Coconut Tipsy Truffle - this one was my favorite. Delicious white cake with white chocolate and chewy pieces of dried coconut.

Tom & John's Red Velvet Tipsy Truffle - a beautiful ruby red color, with a very sweet red velvet chocolate flavor.

Dan's Double Fudge Baileys Tipsy Truffle  - this has a nice balance of fudge flavors and you could also taste the Baileys.

Zane's Whiskey Ginger Tipsy Truffle - I was glad that the ginger and whiskey was light and not overwhelming in flavor. The caramel drizzle was very chewy.

Also got to try orange peach ciroc drop which was a fun little burst of sweet with alcohol flavor. 

Service was good. I was a little disappointed that there were no pamphlets or menus available for customers. Prices are reasonable, truffles are $3 and drops are $2.

I was at Tipsy Coffee House this morning around 9:30am and upon ordering saw a jar sitting on the counter. I was unnerved and a little bit annoyed because I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be a joke or if it was a true donation jar. A few hours later I was still thinking about this ""tip jar"" and called the coffeehouse. After 4 attempts a male named Andrew answered and I asked him if this jar was in fact a ""tip jar"" or a ""donation jar"", to which he replied ""a tip jar"" I asked him if it was a joke and if he thought it was funny to which he responded ""uhhh, yea"". The note on the jar it reads (EBOLA FUN-D a little goes a long way). Personally, I find this distasteful, disrespectful and to me it's not funny nor is it a joke. I will never go back to this establishment and I encourage you all to avoid it as well. There are too many bad things going on in this world,and I would prefer not to give my hard earned money to a place that thinks a worldwide sickness that has killed thousands of people is a joke.",Kc6XUaNsMqGKr6QWoMD8oA,4,3,1,xiuac4_AMjxsyZXCpXOKnw

We originally wanted to go to Layers Bakery next door, but it was 7:40am and they didn't open until 8.  So we walked into Tipsy's.  My first impression was that this was a neat coffee shop and possible place to come and work and bring clients to.   My colleague ordered an egg and cheese sandwich and a bottle of diet coke.  I ordered the dark chocolate croissant.  I noticed the chocolate display and asked if there were any Valentine's Day specials as it was Feb.13, the day before.  She looked at me and said ""not yet!""  What a strange answer for the day before Valentines!  I asked about pricing and she seemed a little distracted and I never got that answer.  I certainly may have been sold a box of truffles for my wife if she had any desire to try - she didn't so I didn't.

There was only one person in front of us, so we thought this would be fairly quick.  My colleague and I started to have a conversation for about ten minutes when I noticed that the girl who took our order brought out a carton of eggs, a bucket of chopped ham and a bag of cheese and placed it on the back counter.  We had thought that maybe someone in the back was preparing the sandwich - obviously we were mistaken.  This girl proceeded to make one coffee drink after another before even starting my colleague's sandwich!  Finally, with only 5 minutes to spare, she started to scramble the eggs and prepare the sandwich.  We were in this place for 25 minutes waiting for a simple sandwich.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back as the service was atrocious and the food nothing special.

I got four shots over ice with some simple syrup and cream which came out to almost $6...seems pretty expensive but there was no price listed for just espresso so maybe that's just how much it is here. The espresso tasted similar to cold brew-slightly tangy and not at all dark and roasty like espresso should be. There were also a lot of fine espresso grounds  floating in my drink.

My barista was nice enough but as there was no one in the store besides us, I got the vibe that I was bothering him.

There is a beautiful selection of truffles crafted in-house in the display window, so if you have a sweet tooth, I would totally recommend checking this place out.

I have decided to embark on a new journey of coffees & coffee houses (yeah, I know, I am one or two decades too late to be trendy), but in the past, I have always stuck with plain ole coffee because whenever I tried a fancy coffee drink it was always extremely sweet. So I told the lady behind the counter my worries, and to my surprise she didn't act like my problems were boring (which, let's face it, they are - but she was nice & helpful anyway!) She suggested a marshmallow latte for me. Also, it was lunchtime & I was hungry, so even though she highly recommended the lavender & white chocolate scone, I opted for the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant.

As far as I can tell, the chicken salad was the only lunch option, so I was really surprised that it was not ready to order at 12:45 in the afternoon. To be fair, they finished making the salad within a few minutes of our order, but I still thought it was strange the prep had not been done earlier. The sandwich was very good - the croissant was not the full butter, crazy flaky kind, but a tamer version that is still delicious and that I think works even better on a sandwich. (I think the flaky kind is best enjoyed on it's own, but is too delicate for a sandwich.) And the chicken salad was well made, but it had dried sweetened cranberries, and I would have preferred it without. (Maybe I should have gone with the lavendar & white chocolate scone!) But my friend, who ordered the same sandwich, thought the cranberries were delicious, so it just goes to show these things are a matter of personal taste.

The marshmallow latte was excellent. A little bit of sweet, but I could still taste the roasted coffee. It was a very elegant beverage, and made me feel like I was having a grown up drink in spite of my emotional immaturity! :-) Fantastic suggestion by the barista!

a fan of iced coffee and they did it right, I got the red eye, which is iced coffee with a shot of espresso added. I could tell they had just got their new BEAUTIFUL espresso machine because every worker was watching it as it poured my delicious drink! I also opted to have a cranberry scone from here and it's the best I've had in a while. It's funny I actually never, ever go to Starbucks (not a fan of their coffee) but I got a cranberry and orange scone from there and let me tell you Tipsy blew them out of the water by a landslide. Perhaps it's because they bake and prepare everything in house fresh every morning! 
They also had cute little chocolate truffles, that I did not try this time, but I'm sure knowing me I shall sometime soon.
The only downer at this point, is that it has only been open a week, and I understand they are getting everything situated still. But it's not very ""coffee shop homie and warm"" yet.

I love coffee. I love the flavor of coffee and espresso and I value a delightful craft beverage that highlights those flavors. All things considered, I would recommend Tipsy's lattes to someone who does NOT like the flavor of coffee. The syrups were so powerful and sweet that my Salted Caramel Nutella latte (which sounds amazing, right?) tasted like sugar milk. I know there are yelpers out there who love things like that so if you do, keep on keepin' on, this place is your spot!

I was also disappointed in the pastry selection. Since they focus predominantly on truffles which feels like an odd combination to balance out such sweet beverages, I opted for the only non-truffle food remaining which was a biscotti.

When my friend and I made our way in, we were greeted and we purchased a couple of ginger scones which were delicious. I inquired about their iced teas and they said they could do any tea as an iced tea. I got an earl gray and my friend got an americano. I saw the barista preparing my tea from a tea bag being steeped and thought that could not bode well, as it can only steep with hot water, and any ice would dilute it. She didn't call us to the counter, but after sitting for a while we went up and checked and there they were. Sure enough, my iced tea was watery, but not terrible, my friends coffee was just okay.

I was starving and expected some savory options, but there were only pre-made sandwiches. While they sounded decent, I know refrigerated bread is never good, and they were pricey at almost $8 a pop. For a pre-made sandwich? Meh.. I'd stick with the freshly made scones. They also offer some boozy chocolates and truffles.

There were two other patrons in there when we went in, and they had ordered a chocolate. They took it to the table and inspected it for a while. Eventually they brought it back up to the counter to let the barista know they had been given the wrong chocolate. She takes the one that had already been given to them and set down on their table and puts it back in the case! Kind of grossed me out.

Some of their coffee drinks involve ice cream, syrups and cake in them, and that's just not really my thing. I like straightforward coffee drinks, I guess I'm a purist. I'm more adventurous with teas though, and I wish I had gotten their Chai so that I could maybe give a more positive review since they make their own Chai mix. I have respect for what they are trying to do, and a coffee spot was much needed in the area. Unfortunately, it didn't win me over.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,7,0,2,zlty6EfZzwhu3JuQMrfTIQ

The price really pleased me too. It was expensive (something like $5 for my drink and $2 for an americano) but again comparatively to other establishments, it's within reason.

The barista could have been friendlier... But then, I like my coffee slingers jacked up on caffeine and hyped up, so probably no fault of hers.

I felt welcome from the start of my visit thanks to the incredibly patient and engaging staff, and the warmth of their happy customers. The barista was very kind and personable, and I even met a regular who has a drink named after him! Tells a lot about just how local this place is. 

I thoroughly enjoyed their homemade chai, and the chocolate dipped strawberry that the regular mister so kindly ordered for me as I was trying to decide what to get. As commonplace as chai tea and chocolate can be, Tipsy provides a nice, distinct take on both - I can't pinpoint what it is exactly, but whatever it is, I'm glad they've taken the time to personalize their formulas to set themselves apart. 

I'm hoping they open a little later, eventually, maybe when people finally discover that there's a much more charming option here than the Starbucks down the street.

I got the cookies and cream vodka truffle. I took a bite and could taste that vodka haha. Super strong, but I enjoyed it. Also got the hazelnut liquor truffle with butterscotch. Way less taste of alcohol but very yummy too. 

Besides their truffles, they also have food like chicken noodle soup and sandwiches. 

The drink menu... man I had such a hard time choosing! Haha. Because I usually don't drink lattes. The thought of cookie butter melting into my mouth made my mouth water. You can order any latte iced or hot or frappe. I got an iced cookie butter latte. It was pretty good. All the chunks of cookie butter stayed at the bottom. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be more melted with the espresso or not but I still enjoyed it. 

My boyfriend got a monster smoothie made with fruits. If you're trying to wake up, that drink will do it! The monster taste was very strong. I was hoping it would taste more fruity. He liked it though.

Today I decided to have an impromptu coffee date with my little princess. When we got there at 10, the place was empty except for an old man sitting in a corner. A young lady was behind the counter (very snobbish and the whole time acted like I was bothering her) No good morning or some type of pleasantries exchanged. Immediately you feel the awkwardness. 

Being that my daughter is 3 and can't have coffee I asked what they had that she could have. Nothing besides a couple of fruit smoothies and some juices she said. Okay, so since she likes Nutella can I have that drink but without the espresso shot? She said they've never done that before but she can try (that kinda made me nervous)

So I ended up ordering The salted Scottie latte (Nutella & salted caramel, sounds super yummy right?) and Nutella latte (minus the espresso shot) for my daughter. We also got a croissant and a Honey lavender scone along with some truffles to go, Limony Cello and Val's hazelnut thingie. The food was ok, nothing really special to elaborate. The Nutella drink was generic tasting, mind you she charged me full price $5.09 for the small even without the espresso. Now my latte is the last straw, at $5.85 for a small size you would think it would taste somewhat decent but NO, it tasted like coffee diluted with a whole lot of water. It was bland, you couldn't taste the coffee nor the sugar. So I told the girl I was not pleased with the drink. She did ask if I wanted something else instead but between the ordinary food and the lack of service, I told her no and kindly just asked for my money back, I couldn't take any more disappointment. I'm all for supporting small businesses but if you offer subpar food, pricey coffee (I don't mind paying if the quality is there) and not so great service then there's really nothing worth going.

My LV coffee tour continues... and Tipsy gets an easy 5 stars from me and the hubby.
The barista was courteous and let us know ""I will be with you in a few minutes"" he was carefully making a drink for the couple ahead of us. We had the perfect amount of time to take everything in and figure out what we wanted from the drink menu.
The truffles and homemade reese's peanut butter cups looked awesome in the pastry case. Chocolate covered pretzel sticks with sprinkles? They looked awesome. It was too early in the morning to try it out but I will definitely try it out next time.

I had the Cafe Tipsy (dark chocolate & tiramisu mocha) and my husband tried a blended Ali baba (salted caramel & white chocolate mocha). While it took a short while to make, I didn't mind one extra second. It was very obvious that this barista was awesome and he took pride in the drinks he made --- my drink was AWEsome with a capital A-W-E. It was well mixed and you could taste the quality of the espresso, and even the chocolate itself. The drink alone was worth 5 stars. My husband's drink was just the right mix of flavors and while it was sweet-- it wasn't too sweet. It was the right ratio of caramely goodness and coffee.

Hands down, Tipsy is up there on my list of coffee shops - I would say top 3.  We really had a great all-around experience and we will definitely be back for a lot more.

There are a couple tv's to watch and keep posted on sports or news. The furniture is amazing, feels like I'm in a lounge! There is also a fish tank which I really enjoyed watching as I ate. The coffee and food were really good, I ordered a cinnamon roll with a large coffee. I will definitely be back!",DuKiq3MPeLXESTZXRhJPHw,0,0,4,kACevgg_P4-TiPwDD63Y7Q
5455220,2016-09-17,0,7P3Z4HTUM8M8Y9Yw3cc7Pg,"Came here In a Friday morning and the place wasn't too busy. I ordered the Allie Baba drink which was white chocolate and salted Carmel latte and it blew my socks off. It still had a strong coffee flavor and the syrup flavoring didn't overpower that which I liked and I could still taste the saltiness of the caramel. They have a wide range of specialty drinks and I definitely gonna come back whenever I'm in the area. 

I'm knocking one star off because of the pricing it was about $5 after taxes. And because I felt like the staff could've been friendlier and welcoming or explained some of the offered some input regarding the menu items to me because I did feel rushed to order since I took some time browse the menu and the staff who took my order just stood over me which I didn't like.",P19z16iz5I9Hh4T99pY8Sg,0,1,4,LyGx1tSKlATwEUI1fanq8A

5494499,2016-08-09,0,7P3Z4HTUM8M8Y9Yw3cc7Pg,Don't ever go this place. Went in for coffee and a cookie. Waited long time just to get one coffee and one bag of cookie. Coffee was cold and cookie was dry as rock. I don't understand how they train thier employees but nobody seems to know what they are doing. Its a shame how they even open the door for business. They should be a shame.,c36NHTfX9YsEIoA8XkxNXQ,0,0,1,5yIHKZJtE2YJ8FIc4FIc0A

I live in Henderson, but will make a special trip to ""Tipsey"" for scones.....Oh, did I mention they are home made, I did ask who their supplier is and the answers was,,,""we make them here""...that was all I needed to hear....when I go back for scones, I will also sample more of the menu.",nri_ckT5x7P_5Xpnz3NWsQ,0,0,5,PrvxX3kif9ZOAioMkoA-Og

It's also all very fairly priced, it's almost as if it's a cute little boutique except for sandwiches, little cookies and adorable teacup sets for sale.  

I would definitely recommend, bombdotcom. Great service too.",FzT-ujff-c11Wa_WdItwig,3,2,5,duPMTyG5VEpps9AMkw-FLg
5846458,2016-08-10,1,7P3Z4HTUM8M8Y9Yw3cc7Pg,"This place gets four stars because it's a clever little idea and a really smart location. It's near all kinds of medical buildings and I stopped in on a whim because I was early to my appointment. 
I ordered the white mocha espresso iced and then took four tipsy truffles to go, and a gingerbread man cookie. You can tell that the items are handmade. The gingerbread man was still pretty fresh, even a little soft. The coffee tastes fresh but I won't be able to give an accurate review on the coffee until I try it black. 
The real star though, those truffles. I was certainly not expecting the pop or that ACTUAL shot of liquor! They have so many of them and if you have more than a few, it's safe to say you'll need a DD if your drinking tolerance is anything like mine. 
I expected it to be just a little bit of liquor.... When in reality it ended up being a small veil of chocolate to encapsulate a mouthful of your favorite alcohol. 
Pretty special stuff. See all the pics.... Or you'll be standing there forever trying to decide. Ask for a sample too! They'll happily oblige!",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,1,1,4,BN1VH0HT4M7F4IeHGsqfvw

I went for the Mexican Mocha which was good but not great. It lacked the real Mexican hot chocolate taste of cinnamon. My friends loved the Blue Velvet and the Red Velvet.

Service was super friendly but also super slow.... I would give it a 3.5 stars but since I like small businesses and small coffee shops, I round up.",UyUJ2dAPVTwAELPV4dAqyw,1,1,4,7kfbj6LsdsMf38kxNuJW6Q
5979154,2014-11-11,0,7P3Z4HTUM8M8Y9Yw3cc7Pg,"Came here mid-morning on a weekday, so naturally the place was completely empty. 

The cashier was friendly and helpful. This would be a nice quiet place to come get some work done or study, since it's so empty, and they have lots of chairs, tables, and sofas to work at. 

I had the spinach, egg, and cheese croissant and a 12 oz cafe au lait. The croissant could have been flakier, the egg could have been fluffier, and the coffee could have been hotter. The breakfast sandwiches are ""made to order,"" but I have a feeling the egg and cheese were prepared fresh, then sandwiched between two spinach croissants (the tart kind, not a real croissant) that had been sitting in the case. The coffee comes in a paper cup, even if you get it ""for here."" 

They have a lot of specialty drinks and desserts that look like fun, but I am not really into fancy coffee drinks - love lattes, americanos, regular coffee, etc., but I don't really like ""coffee"" drinks that taste like sugar with a splash of coffee. That being said, this is a cute little spot if you're working nearby!",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,1,0,3,tcw0V9mC42V5CZfdUO6gpA
