399456,2017-10-26,0,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"To think that 8 years ago good ramen was something that was quite difficult to find in Vegas with very fews stores around the valley that served this delicacy. But fast forward to today and there's a new shop popping up all the time. Ramen Hashi is the newest one, and upon reading reviews where it drew comparisons to the famous Shin Sen Gumi in Los Angeles this place was a must visit. And it definitely does not disappoint. 

Location: Traditional Ramen Bar. There's no tables here but instead a long bar running from front to end. People come here to slurp their ramen and move on with their day similar to how ramen bars are in Japan. The good thing about this spot is that it's not crowded and the high ceilings and open space behind the bar leads to a less cramped feel unlike most ramen spots. 

Service: The owner/chef greeted us immediately when we sat and went over the ordering process which is quite simple. There's a checklist where you can select your preferred type of broth. Extra topping options. And finally drinks. Water is provided at each seat which is nice as it's more DIY service. He made sure to check up on us and made polite conversations.  He also went into detail about how his ramen differentiates from other local spots. He takes pride in the fact the the noodles are handmade and also that the broth is very light. This was music to my ears as my favorite ramen is one with light broth and of course handmade noodles. It shows great mastery of technique as it's only the broth and noodles with no extra fillings and stuff to mask or enhance it. If you can ace that then you definitely know your stuff. 

Food: Shoyu Ramen: Absolutely perfect. The noodles were cooked to the perfect hardness and the chef stood by the noodles the whole time timing it perfectly as it cooked. Broth is very light which is good as it allows one to fully enjoy the flavors of the noodles. Also there's no heavy feeling that comes with broths that are more oily. The egg is the most traditional way I've seen in Vegas where the yolk is still cool in the middle but the whole egg is soft enough to melt in your mouth. The Chashu was also a standout as each piece is laid out in a pan and individually seared with a blowtorch. This creates an excellent flavor profile and is different from the normal ones that fall apart in your soup. All of this is standard with an order and at 9$ it can't be beat. 

Chashu Don: The chef only makes a certain amount of this for the day and I happened to get the last bowl. When serving this dish to me he mentioned that they didn't have enough rice which he apologized to me for while also giving me a 3$ discount. This was a great show of character and service as the bowl had me stuffed and I couldn't even notice the less rice. The chashu is seared like the ramen but it's smaller pieces yet the portion is generous and it never felt gross which is common sometimes as it is a very fatty dish. Egg was again delicious and I definitely cleaned this plate in less than 2 minutes. 

I'm overjoyed of the fact that I can finally say that we have good ramen in Vegas and to see how much has changed over the years with so many great spots in town opening up is absolutely exciting. This is traditional Ramen in it's purest form with the ramen bar design and prices. I'm glad I don't have to drive all the way to Los Angeles for Shin Sen Gumi and I'm already looking forward to my next visit back which will definitely be soon.",rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,3,0,5,xwT7XznlY6bIZU3H8vydxg

The noodles are made in house but they lack bite and chew.  They are a bit soft and expand quite a bit in the broth.  The shio chicken broth is nice and clean but lacks umami. The tonkotsu broth had good flavor and thick consistency which was wonderful but the tare was much too heavy making it quite salty.  Chasu was deliciously tender with a nice flamed char.  Excellent.  Menma sweet and not soft... Very weird taste and texture.  Tomago was a perfect   thick runny consistency, but temperature was really cold.  Pork fried rice was also very salty.

I mostly wish there was a bit more variety in the standard toppings given. It comes with 2 pieces of chashu, an egg, and just tons and tons of green onion and menma. I would have loved to swap out half of that for a few chunks of garlic or a sliver of nori.

The chashu here is really really good though. It's a thicker and fattier style than the usual round slices, similar in texture to kakuni. It held up very well against the broth. It felt a bit luxurious haha, as it's a type of pork I normally eat with rice.

1380586,2017-11-21,0,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Came here for the second time on a Thursday evening when my friend found this place as something new to try. She hasn't been here before and i wanted to try to tonkotsu (since they didn't have it last time). 

We were seated pretty quickly upon arrival at the 1st two seats closest to the entrance. They still have not filled out the empty space behind the bar area. Wonder if they do have plans for that area or not o.O would be kind of a waste if they didn't huh, granted they don't exactly get the up-close and personal experience as you'd get at the bar

As mentioned before, i wanted to try the tonkotsu, and so did my friend. We both essentially got the same thing but i had noticed a slight change in their menu now. $2 for extra noodles ! HEHE ! After quite the long day of excitement, i opt'ed for the extra noodles of course. They said they served the noodles separately, when you are ready, in a separate bowl, placed into your soup. 

We received our food pretty quickly. As usual, every ramen comes with bamboo, 2 slices of chashu, green onions, and half a tamago. One of the chef's saw we were taking pictures of our ramen, told us to WAIT !!!! and piled up on the green onions and bamboo. He took the jar of housemade chili sauce, took up a spoonful and placed it artistically on top of the jar, next to the bowl of ramen. HAHA ! I then took half of that chili sauce and plopped it into my ramen. Of course i tasted the tonkotsu before mixing the chili sauce. Their tonkotsu, to my surprise, tastes completely different from any other tonkotsu i've ever had. Much less creamy and lighter tasting but thats about the extent of my speculation of this broth. Never had i expected it to taste so different. Do I like it? I honestly don't know. Do I dislike it? Definitely not. It was different. May take a few more times to dissect the flavors and make a decision. 

As mentioned before, nearing the end of my noodles, one of the chef asked if i was ready for my extra noodles. After saying yes, he went to prepare my extra noodles. After he cooked the noodles in the water, i saw he put the noodles into a bowl, and mixed it with something. Sesame oil maybe? prior to coming over and pouring the noodles into my bowl. With the flavor of the tonkotsu broth, i couldn't tell if it was sesame oil, but i did see an extra amount of oil that appeared. 

Another good bowl of noodles from this place. Looking forward to them having different noodles in the future !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,2,4,m8WlKCnBj6YUjO8f1bVtag

So much so, that the comparison between them all is hardly the ramen at all...because how do you really compare the same toppings, broth and appetizers?  

Tonight Chloe said, ""I don't even know which ramen shop is your favorite, mom.""  She's right. How do you choose?  Nothing stands out. Maybe Monta because it was my first love?  But it's definitely not because the flavor or noodles are different than the rest...

Ramen Hashi did the opposite of all of the new ramen shops in Vegas, and simplified the menu. 3 broth choices with all of the same toppings and the choice to add ""extra"" of what it already comes with.  I didn't expect anything different than what these other places offer in terms of flavor, but I was wrong.  

I ordered the chicken broth with black garlic oil and an extra egg.  The broth was light, flavorful, and the black garlic oil added a smokey flavor to it. It tastes homemade. Not too salty, nowhere near too bland.

Ramen is an easy 5/5. As a matter of fact, sans the Chashu Don and Ice Cream sandwich, the place only serves chicken-based broth ramen. Their whole menu is in a little sheet of paper you fill out when giving your order. You can do add-ons to your ramen, but that's pretty much it.

I always order the Tori Paitan Ramen + Black Garlic Oil with a side of Asahi. Excellent tasting broth, chashu is torched to add texture and crunch, the bamboo shoots taste great and do not smell, and the green onions add a lovely tang.

It is $9 for everything but if you want extras it costs $1-$3 for additional items.

Food: 
We tried the ramen with different soups as well as the chashu don which is a rice bowl. They put a ton of meat in the rice bowl with seaweed and it was totally worth the price. I think that if you have a small appetite you can share with two people.

They currently have three broth options - shio (chicken based w/ salt) ,  shoyu (chicken based w/ soy sauce) , and tonkotsu (pork based w/ soy sauce). I had their ""shio"" which was their chef's recommendation but I actually liked my boyfriend's broth more which was their ""tonkotsu.""

Ok so here is where things go bad..
I take a sip of the broth and it wasn't even warm. 
The broth tasted like straight up boiled pork water with just a little hint of salt.
I poke my onsen egg to reveal the yolk and it was more of a medium boiled than an onsen egg.
Finally, the chasu pork is more firm than the usual fall-off-the-chopsticks pork pieces I enjoy with my ramen. The fatty part is also hard.

The first time the hubby and I went, there was a sign on the door that said they were out of noodles for the night. Granted, we arrived rather late. However, before we could pull away, the nicest man ran out and stopped us. He asked if it was just the 2 of us and then said they could accommodate us. Yay! And how nice of him to do that!

I absolutely love Tori ramen. There are some amazing places in Japan and New York that I actually like better than your standard tonkotsu ramen. Is it blasphemy to say that chicken tastes better than pork?

Hashi definitely does a solid version of Tori ramen. The broth has a nice round flavor without being too salty. I like that the noodles are made in house. I think it gives them a better consistency when they're made in the same climate in which they're served. I like my noodles more al dente, with a chewy consistency. Theirs are ever so slightly too soft for me but decent nonetheless. The chashu is nice, thick, and super tender.

Ramen Hashi does have personality comes to Ramen spots around town. It first one that see the whole restaurant is one long counter. Every other Ramen spot been to in town you have mixture of tables, booths, and naturally counter area but not one the size of this one. I appreciate that fact cause growing up for me going get Ramen. I would always sit at the counter with my parents. It always makes eating more entertaining in any open kitchen more so when u get to see the magic behind the food. heehee.

The decor is pretty modern, tell it brand new spot nothing before, like the all the wood concept, and it definitely feels like Ramen spot for sure. The menu is pretty straight forward like most other Ramen spots you pick you broth, get choose extra toppings if want for extra charge, and they also chicken and pork. Basically check each box and once done hand it to the chef or waiter staff.  One thing that did find odd was no gyoza on the menu. So add that to personality of the place although would have to say not good one. Ramen spot it really should be all about the Ramen cause that the star. They do have macaroon ice cream sandwiches. Few appetizers.

I ended up going for the Shoyu base with extra tam ago . The noodles are made fresh everyday. Really good. The broth was awesome. It had nice depth, subtle, and not heavy. The portion size is great. 

The service was totally five stars. The minute walked in with the warm greeting and explaining the list fill out for your order since was first time. The chef making it checking up once was served everything was good.

Hashi makes their noodles in-house, which gives them a unique texture. I was informed that their signature broth is the shio, which they make with a chicken base. Think homemade chicken soup, but with ramen noodles. I thought the broth was incredibly flavorful and struck a nice balance with the fresh noodles. It usually comes with chasu, but he gladly subbed in an extra egg for me. 

My only suggestion would be to come up with a veggie broth so that non-meat-eaters can come here too! I appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into making fresh, quality products...I'm sure Hashi will do very well in the days to come.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,2,2,4,W3_F6bkpyWg4JeXXC_5EPw

Location: It is located on Spring Mountain, between Lindell and Jones, right next to Hobak Korean BBQ. Easy to spot. There is plenty of parking at the front. There is also parking space in the back if you need it. 

Decor: a simple, Japanese zen feeling. I came here Monday and their soft opening was on Friday so the room were not filled with chair and tables yet, but there were plenty of seats at the bar. It was an open concept dining place. You could see how the ramen noodle was being made from scratch, prepped and cooked. Bathroom was also clean and smells good (sanitary is important)! 

Menu: The chef mentioned their specialty is the Shio Ramen (chicken based broth with salt). However, they also offer Shoyu Ramen (chicken and soy sauce based broth), and Tonkotsu Ramen (pork and soy sauce based broth - if you like strong and thick soup base). If you are craving for rice, they have pork charsu don (braised pork with seaweed and egg). The ramen comes with: green onion, two pieces of pork charsu, takenoko (cuts and seasoned bamboo shoot) and half egg. No black mushroom with their ramen. Other sides toppings were available if you would like to add more. 

We tried the Shio Ramen and it was an okay for me. For this reason and because their ramen did have black mushrooms like how it was in Tokyo (for real!), I give them a four stars. Maybe because I am a fan of tonkotsu so the shio broth taste was a little too bland for me? However, the noodle was cooked perfectly and it was delicious. I did savor their Tonkotsu Ramen. I thought the pork broth was perfect. Not too heavy (fatty), nor oily or salty. The chef mentioned he does not use any MSG on any of his cooking. While his cooking are all delectable and flavorful, it will not leave you with a thirsty feeling afterwards.

I thought it was so interesting how they torched the pork charsu before they served it. Definitely added a delicate smoky flavor to it, I love its taste! Spicy lover, don't forget to add their home made garlic chili paste. Fyi, it's SPICY. 

Service was a five stars. The chef was friendly, explained the menu very well to us. 

They have calpico, but beers options are limited. They are working on adding more items to the menu. So hopefully, a more exciting new flavors coming up soon including charsu fried rice and gyoza. My recommendations: to add Tsukemen and Hiyashi Chuka (cold ramen) to the menu. It's Vegas and those two are the perfect noodle dishes for the summer. 

Check this ramen place out, it's worth trying. As for me, I will be back here again for some more ramen.",XU-JR0vGW1_O5GmNwZ0bfQ,34,20,4,Uv5-SSTO7rOhVTD3zt3nfQ
2372497,2018-03-01,0,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,This is my new favorite ramen spot. They make everything from scratch here. And let me tell you it tastes that way for sure. The bowls here aren't super large but they make up for that in flavor. Tonkotsu broth is rich and creamy. I sampled it before I mixed in the black garlic oil which just made it that much better. The pork chashu in the tonkotsu bowl is made sweet compared to the chashu in the shoyu my gf had. In short get the tonkotsu with extra chashu and black garlic oil or live an unhappy life.,r4EiDmw6IRTzR0-nDNN6_Q,0,0,5,P6OX9ds28Mo7MqdupCY9og

2393111,2017-12-01,1,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Ramen Hashi does a very well attempt at giving an authentic ramen experience with a very simplistic yet quality broth based bowl.

Their black garlic oil is a must try to any ramen and adds a Smokey flavor that is very complimentary to the broth. I particularly really like adding it to my go to favorite, the tonkatsu. On my last visit there I also tried their chicken based tonkatsu that was used to substitute the traditional pork broth base...and in all honesty I couldn't tell the difference and it was just as savory. It's not too salty compared to competitor ramen joints and the price and portion size are just as fair and affordability priced.

Their menu is simple and you order off a check sheet list then present it to your server/chef. A single bowl of ramen comes pre-set with chashew, bamboo shoots, green onions, and half tomago (egg). The add-on's are a dollar each, but I highly suggest the garlic oil previously mentioned above. 

The Chefs were all very polite and entertaining, checking on us all often and even joking with us on occasion. If you need water or more napkins, it's a self serve style set up and everything is right on the bar. It saves you the time and effort calling the hostess and waiting for a refill.

I highly recommend the Shio! The chicken broth base had a nice subtle taste. It wasn't over powering any flavors and made a nice combination with the chashu and tamago! 

They make their noodles fresh which is awesome! Love the noodles it had a nice texture! 

The chashu pork was so soft with a nice char on top! I'm drooling right now thinking about it! The chef torched the chashu to give it that nice char flavor! Wow! 

The restaurant itself was well kept and had a long bar. There are no tables here so it gives that Japanese small ramen shop feel where you can chat with the chef and your neighbors!

On our small Vegas get away we wanted to try something off the strip. We found this hole in the wall ramen place in the Chinatown area. 

When you walk into the restaurant, it's just a long counter facing the kitchen which is very similar to ramen restaurants in Tokyo. The two things that make this ramen place so special is that they are known for their CHICKEN based broth or soup and HOMEMADE NOODLES. 

I got the house special with BLACK GARLIC OIL and extra bamboo. Their menu was simple and to the point. Each seat has hair ties and chili. Love it!!! The noodle was perfectly cooked! The broth was so flavorful and you can tell the difference from the chicken and the usual pork. A must TRY! It was so amazing to see the chefs char the charsu. My bowl was like $10~$11. Very inexpensive. I'm so sad that this place is not local.

2816913,2017-12-29,0,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"So I really love ramen. We have a couple good spots in Vegas, so that's what I'm comparing it to. First off, the menu is really simple. Way too simple. I was thinking because it was so simple, the broth and everything else would be amazing. The broth is okay at best. Better than instant ramen, but not totally better. The noodles, apparently they make it themselves, so I was thinking it would be better. Again, it's not good, but it's not bad. I like noodles at ramen sora or ichi ramen way better. The service was good, but I mean it's really not hard to provide bad service at a ramen restaurant. The place also doesn't have a wait like other ramen places. I can't tell if it's a good thing or a bad thing. Is there no wait because people don't like it that much, or is there no wait because they are new? Anyway, I just tried this spot because I was in the area and ramen sora had a huge wait. I'll probably try it again in a few weeks to see if I have a change of opinion. All I can say is, with really good ramen on spring mountain and really good ramen at centennial, this place is going to face some tough competition",oegRUjhGbP62M18WyAL6pQ,1,0,3,j4eDpIlXU9aqdin8QYyVEA

I noticed this place used good noodle and the broth was good and it was so clean. I loved everything about the restaurant except one thing... which was the server.

This old asian lady who was very short with short hair was horrible. She got the order wrong and couldn't even speak english well. She made my experience very uncomfortable and I felt very offended by her attitude and how she was speaking with her very limited attempt at english. She made it very clear that she was just after the money and did not care for the customers.

After I paid my bill, the short, old lady had a very offensive look on her face with the tip I gave her even when she made my experience so horrible. She did not even greet me when I was leaving. I want love to give a tip to everyone else but she is not worth tipping 10 cents.

I love everything about the restaurant from the food to the cleanliness but this lady ruined it all. Her attitude is just horrible and everything about her is just horrible.

The owner of the place should be proud to run such a great restaurant but should think twice about keeping this lady to work there. I came here a few times after work before and she seems to work during the nighttime on the weekdays. She ruins the whole experience and I will not come back here again just because of the feeling that I am seen as someone who needs to tip well even when I had a horrible experience and not a valued customer.

No ramen stateside has really hit the spot since... until this place opened! I am literally in our car typing this review on my phone because I am excited to spread the news about this place! 

Located in the starting-to-get-busy plaza of the popular Hobak, Ramen Hashi presents itself as a more traditional Japanese ramen experience. You will sit along a long bar and fill out your ramen order on individual forms. The menu is straightforward, with three different ramen bases, and the option to add more toppings. We opted to try the tonkatsu and chef-recommended shio, which is chicken-based. I normally avoid chicken ramen, but the broth managed to be light, but flavorful, without the lingering taste of chicken bones I get at other ramen spots. I also normally get my ramen without bamboo shoots, but kept them here and was pleasantly surprised at how they complemented all the other flavors in the bowl. The chasu pieces were substantial, well-charred, and not too fatty. My husband had the tonkatsu ramen and had no complaints. Noodles were cooked perfectly and had a nice chew to them. We also shared a Chasudon (limited quantities available). The chasu here had a great smoky flavor, rice was done well, and served along seaweed. You serve yourself water from cold pitchers at your station, which also comes with sushi ginger, spicy sauce, and rubber bands to help people with their chopsticks.

Service was attentive and friendly, and the chef was eager for feedback and any recommendations we could provide. I thought it was a perfect, well-balanced bowl, and the restaurant add a much-needed genre of ramen Vegas has been missing.

Can't resist giving them 5 stars even though the menu was limited and they brought my check early. Service was pretty good though, nice server who smiled and checked in often, decent teamwork from the cooks to grab more tea and toppings.

They only offer cans of tea but it is the super dark great tasting Oolong tea. I needed two of them at $1.75 each but happy to pay for quality.

Speaking of quality I love the fact they DON'T USE MSG and have great Handmade noodles. I enjoyed every bite and slurp of this meal.

The open bar is fun because you can see the action and get the smells pouring from the kitchen.  Suggest they add more variety to the menu and better seating for groups but hard to find much to complain about. 

I got the Shio ramen: 5 stars Original chefs recommendation. 
It includes pork belly Chashu that they torch fresh in front of you giving it great flavor. On the menu I noticed you can add extra Chashu but didn't say anything about adding chicken on the menu. They have a huge bowler full of chicken that looked great so I asked about it and he said he can add chicken instead. I happy paid $3 extra and got both Chashu and Chicken to get a variety. 
Ramen is 5 star after you add the garlic paste, chili paste, and chili oil it was just so awesome. I devoured it all and can't wait to go back. 
You can add more noodles or other items part way through. I added more onions mid way for $1 which was nice.

For dessert they have Macaron Ice Cream Sandwhich/ Cookies: $3.50 wasn't cheap but this was so good and worth every penny.
It's a Macaron (mack-ah-rohn) with one 'O' not two. The server wasn't sure the difference in a macaron vs macaroon, we were both wondering if it was a typo. haha. I'm new to both so I used google. Basically they are different and the macaron is the bomb and just so good in the ice cream sandwich form. 
If you go for dessert only take cash, I think they have a $5 or maybe $10 card minimum which is fair since they pay fees. 

Still reading? Stop and go check them out. It might be hard but try to take your time and not inhale your food in 10 minutes like I did. haha. Enjoy!",2YiBYO8n32upYTJnpWgqLg,34,33,5,GoMgxbr5jRNz_pdTNOlkqQ

From the outside, the restaurant looks like it would be a lot smaller than it really is. But from the entrance down, it's a long stretch of chairs facing an open kitchen (Bar style). That is the only seating option, as there are no lone tables or booths. It's not a bad thing though. I love the vibe and ambience it gives.

This joint is very simple. From the decor to the layout, they just have one purpose. To serve good ramen. It's a nice lil place for a quick bite. Since the restaurant is a bar-style kind of eatery, coming here with a big group wouldn't be the greatest idea. Having to sit in a row doesn't exactly give you a chance to have conversations with everyone in your group. But if all you care about is having a quick meal, then come on down! LOL

Their menu is very simple too. Even though you can customize your orders, I feel like there's something missing. Selection is pretty limited as it is. However, the business hasn't been open for very long so who knows. The menu might be revamped and new ideas can always be incorporated. But like I said before, serving delicious ramen is their main focus. All you have to do is bring your appetite and craving.

If you're in the area, give this place a try. Plus, there's a boba place right next door for dessert. Oh the convenience of that. Need I say more? :]",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,7,4,4,d5Doh4xrPKrSf9Zt8cEMiw

3159745,2017-10-24,0,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Wow can I be more impressed? First of all, if you are a ramen enthusiast, then you have heard about shin sen gumi ramen from LA j-town. Shin-sen-gumi is the crown of ramen on the west coast, so to be able to go up against shin sen gumi is something to be proud off. The tonkatsu ramen soup here taste almost identical to shin sen gumi and I was blown away. Most establishments have really salty or weird flavor soup base like adding butter and garlic for a more western tongue (names I would not mention). The noodle here is the thin style but was a bit more soft compared to shin.  The owner said he could make it more chewy if I wanted to since everything is made by him including the noodles. He also said that his ramen has no added msg or preservative which is surprising to hear. I mean what? Asian food with no msg = mind blown.

Now for the con, the chashu and egg is very average. Here I feel the meat isn't marinated as much and not as sweet. The egg is bland as well like a hard boiled egg, maybe that was the intention to accentuate the flavor of the soup. The place needs more tables also. 

So why did I give 5 stars, based on the soup, noodle, and no msg, this place is on par with shin sen gumi. I support local family business and no longer need to go to la for good ramen. This will be my primary spot from now on.",_Myhjqjob0ST8a96BzQBPg,4,4,5,kDazr-9SvRdhcYqwhw93Mw

Monta Ramen, Ramen Sora and Jinya are some of a few to name. When I heard about another ramen place that opened up, I was just like......cool. Hope it's closer to my house (it is) and can compete with the rest of them. So I went here for the first time 2 days ago and it BLEW. MY. MIND. I at first could not believe how good everything was. From the amazing noodles they make fresh everyday, to the worlds most perfectly cooked eggs and to the awesomely flame charred melt in your mouth chashu, this place instantly became my favorite. On this day I ordered the shio broth which is the chefs specialty. Just to make sure it wasn't a fluke, I went back the very next day by myself this time, so I could really concentrate and appreciate the ramen for what it is. I ordered the shoyu broth which is pretty much the same as the shio but with soy sauce added. Yep, I wasn't dreaming.

3223761,2018-01-06,1,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Boy oh boy is this place fire. I love this place so much I legit have been going here at least once a week since November of 2017 and have ordered at least one of everything (which isn't hard as they only have 5
 food items). The most I have been to this place was three times in one week!

This place is different from most ramen shops in Vegas. When you go in, they set you up at a bar for that more traditional Japan ramen shop feel. They also have you order through a slip of paper. This was honestly the weirdest thing for me at first. I am used to ordering through a waiter or through a drive-thru. After my third time here, the paper ordering is a welcomed pro to the experience as it quickly speeds up your ordering as you just place your order on the bar in front of you and you don't have to wait for someone to come take your order.

A welcomed feature that I love about this place is the water at the bar. I drink a lot of water and not having to wait around for a waiter to get more water is a godsend. They give you your cups and a giant thermos like container full of ice water. I have yet to finish the jug in one sitting so there is enough for the average person to sit through their meal.

Their ramen soup is super light but not light on flavor. There are other ramen soups that have a lot of flavor but are full of oil and fat that weigh you down, and other ramen places that have light soups but almost no flavor and do not fill you up at all. Hashi has found a way to make a light but fantastically flavored soup. There are so many notes in the soup that make it delicious.

Once those noodles hit your tongue you're hit with a wonderfully odd sensation. That is because these noodles are homemade and you can tell how fresh noodles are meant to taste. If you show up usually towards the evening you can see them making their noodles through the glass. It is a wonderful experience to take a date or your family to see.

Now for some not so wonderful criticisms about this place. I am a super garlic fan but there are no containers for garlic. Fortunately all you have to do is ask for it and they will give you the minced garlic on the side. Something you have to try though is the black garlic for this gives your ramen a welcomed depth to your ramen.

If you are not a fan of ramen I highly highly highly suggest getting the rice bowl. I think this is probably one of the best rice bowls I have had in a ramen place. It is my second favorite thing on their menu and enjoy getting full off of their hearty rice bowl. I can't say much about it because I do not want to over hype it but please once in your life just order it and you will not be disappointed.",Y5Jn7FKHubCVjl5qZjA3yg,4,1,5,r1b1FDGoptcDa7kVKX0Yrg

That said, with limited space, I can see wait times being pretty long since the bar can only really serve around 20 at a time.

Overall, while not the best food, the price point makes it a very good option considering that in the US, ramen prices are incredibly inflated in comparison to Japan with much of a quality boost. However, with prices being set around $9 a bowl, it's a really good deal.

I got their recommended shio ramen. A huge positive was their ratio of broth to noodles to toppings. Generally, many places end up overfilling on broth causing the toppings to go soggy, but this place has it just right. The noodle thickness is slightly smaller than normal and has some bite to it, but its snap is not as satisfying as other noodles from well known Japanese chains like Menya Ultra. The chashu itself was very flavorful and tender with perfect charred edges and the bamboo shoots weren't overpowering the broth at all. However, the egg could have been a little more runny and seasoned a bit more as well. The real bugbear, though, was the excessive amount of green onions that was contained their dishes. It may have been due to the fact the vegetable was cut longways so you just got huge mouthful of it.

I also got to try their chashu don. Definitely mix the bowl before eating because their sauce is very salty. The egg in this one was more flavorful than in the ramen and the diced nori added a good amount of umami to the pork, making you appreciate it even more. There was too much rice in proportion to everything else, however, but it was a good way to dilute the saltiness from their sauce.",YMF7w4fuW9bocGukfuJ8RA,1,0,4,6-HE7yCh2XVDYw6Rhi3gyg

I lived in Japan for 7 years and I know that in the U.S. nothing will ever compare to Japanese food made in Japan but it can come pretty close. I went from being a regular at Monta, to becoming a regular at Jinya, and now I am probably going to have to say I'll be a regular at Hashi. 

The interior is so clean and set up as all bar seating (common in ramen houses). I didn't count but I want to say there are at least 20 seats lined up in front of the kitchen. I really enjoyed this because it's always nice to see how your food is being made. The menu is short and sweet. You have 3 broth options, a chashu bowl option, extra topping options, and drinks. 

I always order tonkotsu ramen where ever I go. I came around lunch time, so I was informed they had ran out of the pork broth because they make everything in house (noodles and broth). I was given another option, the guy told me it would taste just like tonkotsu broth but it would be from chicken bone (I forgot the name of this broth). I told him it was fine and tried it. My friend got the shio ramen which was the chefs choice on the menu. She liked it a lot! I tried the shio broth and it was so simple, light, and flavorful. I really loved the broth I was given, it really did taste like tonkotsu broth. I also added the black garlic oil in mine because I love garlic. It didn't hurt or make the ramen better because I'm sure I would have loved it without the garlic. The noodles had a good texture and taste to it, you can tell they were fresh. The chashu was sooo good in the ramen. It was so soft, and smokey in flavor because they hand torch each piece. I really don't know what it is but you can tell everything was home made. 

I stopped going to Monta because their broths became too salty for my taste. I started to go to Jinya because their broths were less salty, but I realized everything was so flavorful because they put a bunch of extra stuff in their ramen. Hashi is just good ol plain ramen. Simple, clean, and flavorful without all the extra crap in it. They just put the basic ramen necessities: bamboo shoots, green onions, chashu, and tamago. 

The best thing about this place was that I finished a whole bowl and did not feel lethargic or disgusting afterwards. I can't wait to come back when the weather gets cooler. Love this place!",JtpZw-NLL5m6BNjd0LPQVQ,7,3,5,Buwl9u10zgaQTRrdjuX-Hg

3591746,2017-10-27,2,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Honestly the best ramen I've had personally in Vegas.

I appreciate a lighter broth than is typical in the US. Most ramen places overdo the umami and salt which leads to a really heavy flavor. Hashi aims to use fresh ingredients and keep the broth lighter. They make all their noodles in a machine up front and the owner has told us that he intends to tweak the noodles here and there as they find their identity in the LV ramen scene.

At 9 dollars a bowl that includes half a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and chashu pork, Hashi is very reasonable and their portion sizing is excellent. Not too big, not too little. My only nitpick might be that there was a little too much onion and sometimes the noodles are kind of twisted together. I noticed the chef trying to loosen them up when he prepares an order.

I do have to mention that they seem to have some growing pains as tonkatsu wasn't available the first day we went, but we went another time and had it and it was very good. However, that day, the pork rice bowl wasn't ready because the rice was being made. I did get to try a mini version of it and the pork was slightly tough, but I'll withhold judgement until I try the full order.

They also have a spicy seasoning you can add that does add quite a kick to the flavor.

3742563,2018-01-07,0,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"The thing that sets Hashi apart from other ramen places in Vegas is that their broth is only chicken based, so they don't have miso or tonkotsu (I believe the change from tonkotsu to Tori Paitan was recent). They have house-made noodles and don't include MSG. They're also a bit more expensive than Monta/Sora at $10-11 vs $7-8.

At first, these ideas made me skeptical, because I've always believed that changing up traditional styles of cooking to accommodate western ideas like ""no msg"" ruined the taste of classic Asian foods. However, their Tori Paitan, the chicken version of tonkotsu is creamy, flavorful, and proved me wrong. The ramen here is different from anything I've had, but all the elements are done well, i.e. perfectly cooked egg, crunchy seared chasu, fresh noodles, etc. You have to try for yourself. 

The reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is that they have paper menus you have to mark on. This would be a cool concept, but you don't give the paper directly to the cook, you give it back to the server. Every time you have a question, the server goes back to the kitchen and leans over the counter. They even recircle what you order before giving it to the chef. Because the interaction is so server involved, it just seems unnecessary and really just lazy to have a paper menu instead of a nice menu where the server takes your order. It's a gimmick, and one that hinders the dining experience instead of adding to it. 

Overall, I liked the ramen, and I would come back. I do hope that in the future, they add extra seating and get rid of the paper menus.",iY7qj_LPKnsDNrCgdzKS1Q,0,0,4,Im48V9m4BPH0xBrSfWCMmA

A friend and I arrived at 12:30 on a weekday, and were immediately seated because it was pretty empty inside. I went with the Shoyu ramen. The chicken broth was perfect - not too powerful/salty. The egg was done perfectly, and as other reviews mentioned, the pork is torched in front of you and was delicious as well. I really enjoyed the in-house made noodles. 

The service was excellent. We were checked on frequently. Food was brought out within 5 minutes of ordering. Vegetarians, have no fear. My friend is a vegetarian and initially opted for the rice bowl and requested it without the meat when he discovered that all ramen options were meat based. When the chef discovered this, he instead asked if my friend would be open to trying his variation of a vegetarian ramen. From what I could tell, there was extra bamboo, seaweed, and a few other ingredients. Hopefully they'll add this dish to the menu eventually because my friend said it was delicious, but be sure to mention it if you'd like a vegetarian option. The chef asked for recommendations to improve his dish, and it did appear that he truly did want his customers to enjoy their food.

Finally got the chance to give this place a try and was pleasantly surprise how well everything was. I have a special place for Ramen, especially coming from Hawaii. Ramen is what I grew up eating and it's prepared in various ways from your traditional to your infused version. In Hawaii, we are accustomed to eating Saimin which is a fusion of Japanese Ramen, Chinese Mein and Filipino Pancit. 

Ramen Hashi leans toward more of a traditional ramen. A cool aspect of the restaurant is the open kitchen and every seat in the house is along the bar facing the kitchen. Condiments are provided including pickled ginger in a stainless steel container, I personally love. The whole process of ordering requires you to fill out a sheet with a pencil provided kinda like the ones at DMV. After, deciding which base and toppings you want. The server than forwards your custom order to the cooks and everything is prepared fresh including the in house noodles made on site. Wow, everything was simply delicious. It was prepared as how I want it and the option of ordering extra noodles are added once you finish your first serving. Which, I previously had my extra noodles place in my bowl rather than later on. A plus, since noodles get very soggy in the broth over time. 

The menu is streamlined so it's not to complicated but keeping with the traditional ramen taste. They have 4 different flavors that include; Shio, Shoyu, Tonkotsu & Chasu Don. I got the Tonkotsu, Pork based broth with soy sauce. The flavor was balanced and the noodles were just right in texture. I will come back for more especially during the cold nights in Vegas. Another great addition to the ever changing foodie scene!

I ordered the Shio ramen and really enjoyed the broth! $9 for a bowl, which is pretty cheap relative to other ramen joints. The ramen noodles are made/pulled in house and cooked to a great texture/crunch.

While serving mostly ramen, they do have a limited offering of chashu don. Their ramen features three different types of broths including shio, shoyu and tonkotsu. 

While mostly promoting their shio ramen, I tried the tonkotsu, which I expected to have a richer flavor. I found the broth to be too thin for my liking, which is rare for a tonkotsu broth. They menu doesn't allow room for customizing the broth richness, or noodles, but they were able to cook my noodles on the firmer side upon request. The rest of the bowl comes with a few pieces of chashu, bamboo, green onions and half a tamago. The egg was slightly on the undercooked side while the chashu wasn't the most tender. Seaweed is not included and costs $1 extra. I did enjoy noodles.

Service was fast and friendly. Although the ramen here is fine for $9, my recent trip to the land of ramen leaves much to be desired.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,9,7,3,9k4waP8AUXsav3hcnZtZaA
3898094,2018-01-25,1,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"TL;DR: recommended for your Ramen itch. Broths are well crafty with balance and flavor in mind. Orders are done on order cards to the cooks. Relatively speedy deliver of Ramen to your mouth in about 6 minutes depending on the complexity of your orders. Won't hurt your piggy bank. 

Do you remember the first time you tore open a 10 cent pack of Ramen? Paying careful attention to pour the exact required of water to cook hopefully not just the noodles but also warm up the soup base to eat at an adequate temperature? Maybe cut up some spam and sauteing it so to give it a little char crunch, maybe even fried up an egg for extra protein. Well, this place is the more adult version of that. Instead of tearing up a pack of Ramen, you instead sit at the counter with other Ramen compatriots and place your orders through an order card so any mistakes is probably made by your hands. Literally. If you have any questions or need a recommendation, a cook is promptly ready by to answer your needs. A far cry from your youth but the smell, the sight, the taste, the textures, and the soup will bring it all back to you.

I had the chicken paitan which is the special for that evening. It's a thicker, creamier style chicken broth we're used to but it is hearty and meaty. In the broth you can smell the good quality bones, alliums, and aromatics. I elected for char siu for the extra protein. It was moist, slightly smokey from the braise, with an extra touch of burnt flavor from the blow torch they use to warm it up behind the counter. Nice generous size on the order of char siu. The crisp from the char portions of the meat is a welcoming addition. The green onions bring a refreshing pungent presence like your cousin Gary when he came out at your last family reunion. The ramen is surprisingly springy, think of al dente, and soft on the palate. It's really well balanced between the subtle flavor of the flour and Kansai.

All in all, the experience is speedy but not rushed. Affordable but doesn't leave you feeling you relapsed into the package style Ramen. I highly recommend this Ramen shop for its shop cooking ability and simplicity of which it delivers nostalgia albeit a little more ramped up and tastier.",2_v3cWaTjauIeQH2bOWa2A,3,0,5,pvHeIjTRl3jeJmhQkDCOqg

Although they have Tonkotsu, here it's all about chicken based broths, including shouyu. There is one beer. It's on draft, and you are not expected to hang around and discuss world affairs with a friend when you are done. Come in, eat, enjoy it while you eat it, and leave. Someone else is likely behind you waiting for a seat. They make the noodles, and they are good. You can watch them take a blowtorch to the chashu to add additional flavor. And, it is great chachu.
Finally, there's the onsen tomago. They may not have a hot springs in back to make it traditionally, but it's a very cool addition that nobody else in town has, that I know. Make sure you get one. It's a perfect poached egg of mostly magic liquid yolk with a little soft white around it. Oh yea.

We've been here 4 times already and each time the service and the food was great. The restaurant is located on Spring Mountain and Duneville (in between Jones and Lindell).

We've tried the Chicken Ramen, Tonkatsu Pork Ramen and the Chashu Don rice bowl. All were delicious!! 

My favorite is the chicken ramen. When we first came, the owner urged us to give his specialty chicken ramen a try. I'm more of a Tonkatsu girl, but he seemed so passionate about it I had to try it. 

I'm glad I did!  It's the best item on the menu. I added seaweed to the Chicken Ramen. The broth is flavorful, but not too salty. The ramen noodles are made in-house. The egg was perfectly cooked with the egg white soft with a gooey, runny yolk on the inside. Yummmm The chashu was tender and fatty. There were times when they served it nice and thick too! For those who like it hot, there's a spicy hot paste you can add to give the broth a nice kick.

The Tonkatsu ramen is also good. The Chashu Dom rice bowl was cut up Chashu w/ rice, green onion and crispy seaweed. This was also tasty! All dishes were full of great tasting flavors yet it wasn't so salty that you walk out w/ sausage fingers from all the sodium you've consumed. 

Service was always greet. Everyone greets us with a smile. They take care of us very quickly! The food comes out fast. 

The decor of the restaurant is clean and simple. The layout is a true Ramen Bar w/ an open kitchen concept where you can see the chef's cooking constantly. It's interesting to watch! 

When I came here with my husband we enjoyed two Ramen bowls for $25 w/ taxes and tip included so it's inexpensive to eat here. 

There's ample parking and a decent foot spa next door! There's also a Chatime that just opened up so you can go next door to enjoy boba after dinner too. 

Right now they're pretty slow, but each time I come it seems to get busier! There's only about 25 seats available in the entire restaurant so they can get busy quickly. 

Happy Dining,

Ramen is my jam. I've been to most of the ramen spots here in Vegas. I have also been to the famous spot in San Diego - Menya Ultra. My go-to dish for ramen is always the ramen with tonkotsu broth.

My family and I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant is located on Spring Mountain near Hobak & Cha Time. Inside is pretty bare, and there were no tables - only bar seating. 

We ordered 3 things here - Tonkotsu Ramen, Shoyu Ramen, and the Chashu Don. Everything we ordered was extremely disappointing. The Tonkotsu broth had very little flavor - it literally tasted like boiled pork water. Tonkotsu is supposed to be rich in flavor. My hubs had the shoyu, and this was also bland. He ended up having to add an extreme amount of the hot sauce that they provide. The Chashu that was given in the ramen was also on the hard side. It was thicker than other ramen spots and a little chewy. Their Chashu Don (which is sold in limited quantities each day), was just bad. They take the same Chashu that is used in the ramen, and blow torch it to hell so that it's practically almost burnt. we felt like we were eating a bunch of char with rice.

Service:  The friendly staff greets you as soon as you enter and gets you seated immediately.  The dining area is currently one long ramen bar that faces the kitchen with 18 seats side by side.  You get immediate attention from the kitchen after you fill out your order on the paper menu in a 3 step process.  1) Choose your type of Ramen from 4 options. 2) Choose your additional toppings if you want any. 3) Choose your drinks if you want something other than water.  Simple effective and the staff is great.

Ramen: This visit I went with the Shoyu Ramen and added extra chashu and seaweed.  The Shoyu broth was a little bland and watery. I was expecting a little more flavor.  My friends really enjoyed the black garlic oil that they added to their Ramen which is something I might consider on the next visit. The chashu was decent and everything else in the ramen was fine. The noodles however might be one of my favorite currently in the 702.  I discovered that they make their noodles in house which explains the freshness and taste.  I'm really digging the noodles at Hashi.

The service is great and hopefully they'll add some tables behind the ramen bar to accommodate more than 18 customers.  Maybe I got the Shoyu broth on a bad day but if they get that up to speed with their bomb fresh in-house noodles, this place has the potential to be one of my favorite ramen joints.

4107077,2017-11-19,4,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Finally, a new worthwhile ramen option!

Ramen Hashi is a fairly new restaurant in a peculiar plaza which looks like office buildings but started hosting restaurants in a wave pioneered by nearby Hobak Korean BBQ. You won't find tables here, just one long counter of about 15 seats (UPDATE: 18). That means that group dining wouldn't be great here, but flying solo (as I did) or bringing a friend would be appropriate. I've heard that they do get crowded, but the room was oddly empty in the late Saturday afternoon, so I was seated promptly.

The menu is simple and traditional, save for how they want you to mark your choices on a paper with a pencil. Unless you want chashu don, aka pork belly over rice (and I may indeed try this in the future for reasons which I'll elucidate soon), you'll be picking from three broths (or more, such as a special tori paitan with a broth made from chicken bones) and choosing any desired premium add-ons if the universal defaults of bamboo, chashu, green onion, and tamago aren't enough for you.

I chose the tonkotsu ($9), which is described as ""pork based broth flavored with soy sauce."" The broth wasn't intense in flavor or too salty, perhaps even ""clean."" The thin noodles (no thick noodles here) were properly cooked. The best part was easily the chashu, which is the pork belly that typically comes with ramen. They sear it off with a butane torch, adding a char to the fatty and meat deliciousness.

As for the other toppings, the bamboo was more flavorful than most places'. I liked both the normal tamago and the soft egg whites of the +$1 add-on onsen tamago (which apparently came with a more gelatinous yolk as it should've; not sure why I was hoping for runny). The one real negative is the julienned green onions, which ended up stringy and clumsy to handle.
 
Of the eight local, still-in-operation ramen joints which I've tried, Ramen Hashi might only be the 3rd which I'd add to my rotation. I will definitely return to try some of their other entrees, and I recommend that all local ramen fans stop in posthaste.

(UPDATE 12/27/17: Shio ramen is nice and light, but don't get black garlic oil with it. Or with any ramen, for that matter. I believe the oil coats everything and blocks your taste buds from the flavors; the non-garlic oil shio tasted lighter but was far more vibrant.)",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,15,8,4,PsP8ZutG5cz3iFpb6yZAjw

The broth was very light, and tastes fairly healthy. I mean, for it being ramen. The bamboo wasn't as tender as I'm used to. The pork, however, WAS AMAZING. Charred to perfection! 

I had the shio added extra bamboo, which made me sad bc I didn't like their bamboo too much, and the garlic paste, which usually is free at most ramen places. And my boyfriend had the shio, with extra noodles. I like how they give you extra (and fresh) noodles when you're ready for it.

The cook was very friendly! He explained everything to us and kept a nice conversation going!

Overall, 4.5, just wish their bamboo was a little more tender and just a tad more flavor in their broth.. and free garlic paste . With as many ramen spots as there are in Vegas, this place sets itself aside by their daily made products. You can really taste the difference!",IzKc0jBJnmEbmOA9F5VyDA,3,1,5,U1UhhCmmmUhKa9lkAMYEbg

Thy have my favorite Tonkatsu, I was happy to find very flavorful as it should be but slightly less salty which is a bonus in my mind.

That being said don't be that person with a big party unless you're going to leave after your meal and let the other customers sit down. 

They are super fast with the food coming out and I could eat their noodles definitely again. The ramen I ordered had thin noodles and the texture was everything I imagined it to be. It was quiet and I wanted to slurp my noodles but I decided to eat it slowly... I deeply regret it now. The chashu was fatty and cooked by a blowtorch which is cool. I didn't love the chashu though. The eggs were subtle and not memorable. The garlic oil is a must and ask for a little because it can get oily. 

Overall, I would definitely go in again. I recognize the chashu and the egg might've not been my favorite or preference but the noodles and the flavor of the ramen with the garlic oil are more than great for me.",kYRyLtGD6FebXYaN7HCGjw,1,1,5,Ns7CuO0yNao5jWOK_rA8BQ

The additional topping of the delectable Onsen Tamago plus black garlic oil, to me, is perfection in a bowl.

Often way too savory, salty, and creamy that I just want to plunge into a pool and engulf enough that the 6 foot area is the new 5 foot level but Hashi got me saying, ""damn I could really go for a bowl of ramen""

Setting: It is located in the same plaza that Hobak is located. Upon entering the restaurant the seating is all bar and very long (looks like it could seat... 25?) The restaurant has a very open layout and the cooking is very honest (you can see them prepare everything). Conveniently utensils, toppings, spices, and a cold pitcher of water is all at your disposable without having to flag the staff. 

Service:  There was an asian lady that basically obtained your ramen order, drinks, brought you the check etc. The staff manning the kitchen brought you your food, and took care of any other questions or assistance needed. We had a very enthusiastic gentleman that kept us entertained but got a little too zealous while we were trying to eat. 

Ramen: They have giant pots that basically simmer the chicken/pork which looked like for days. Being the type that doesn't like the savory kinds of ramen I opted for the chicken based shoyu (waitress recommended) which took my breath away. So much complex flavors that hit your tastebuds from the chicken, soy sauce and whatever else made this God-like concoction. Best ramen in vegas hands down. House made chili packs a lot of heat but actually has good taste than just burning your bum.

I have been craving noodles for about a month now so imagine my disappointment when I get home and realize that there is a box of noodles missing.

The noodles are hand made in house and have a really good constancy (not too thick and perfectly al dente)!  We were told the broth is made from scratch, made with just chicken bones, no msg, no other additives!  Their charshu is the best!  Cooked for over 6 hours and charred right before they serve you.  I could eat a whole plate of it!  I normally don't fully care for the greens in my ramen (even though I love veggies in general) but even their greens enhanced the flavor of my perfect spoon full of ramen!

The chefs are friendly and even told us the owner interned in Japan for a year and takes his ramen seriously.  He has the timing of cooking everything down to the second and even has a machine that tests the broth for the taste and consistency.  His passion shows on his food because it everything we had was delicious!  

Tips:
- Try the Tori Paitan!  It's their chicken version of Tonkotsu!  My husband loves tonkotsu, but when he tried my Tori Paitan, he loved mine over his!  It's so clean tasting but still so creamy
- use their chilli garlic paste if you like a little kick.  It really enhances the flavor
- ladies!  They have a jar of hair ties so you can enjoy your soup without bringing home some of the broth in your hair.  Love this idea!

Watch out Vegas ramen scene, there's a new kid in town and he's out to play.

If eating here has taught me anything, it's that simplicity is best. No appetizers, no mile long menu, no msg, no fuss. Just choices of their signature chicken broth, pork broth, or chasu bowl. All bowls come with bamboo shoot, egg, and green onion. You can request extra, if you'd like.

Ramen Hashi is a single bar and  is meant to mimic authentic Japanese ""eat and go"" style. Our food was out no less than 5 minutes after ordering and all prepared in view of the customers. 

We ordered the chef special ""Tori Paitan"" ramen (basically tonkotsu style broth, but using chicken bones instead of pork) and a chasudon. Normally, I am a pork tonkotsu kind of person, but I wanted to try their chicken broth since that is what they specialize in. The noodles are housemade and SO GOOD. I was NOT disappointed. It was excellent. My boyfriend, who normally doesn't like ramen, actually said he liked it. The same goes for me in terms of chasu bowls, but it was the best chasu bowl I've had in Vegas by far, especially with their special chili paste. We were tempted to order more food, but not because the portions weren't enough (they were!). It was just that good.

Did I mention the staff is amazing? Our server made sure to explain each part of the menu to us. The chef came over to see how we liked it and explained that they aim to cook with ""honesty and love.""

4947976,2017-12-10,0,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Tried it by the suggestion of my friend.

Walking in, it is spacious and dredged up memories of Naruto. Infront of the bar seating you can see their clean kitchen and refrigerator, prep area and sink. The bar also has cute little decorations like you would see in anime ramen stands, the only difference is it is inside a building and not outside. They could maximize their space by adding tables or booths on the very empty wall, but that's just me. Could easily do 4-6 2 person table tops or bench style seating.

Ordering was fun. Reminded me of how you would order for some sushi restaurants:
Option 1 wad to choose between their broths or their rice bowl (which is a very huge portion and something definitely for me to come back and try it to finalize my thoughts about this place). After choosing the broth, then you get to choose your extras (including noodles, 2 types of egg (onsen or soft boiled and soaked in soy, bamboo shoots and their garlic oil). The last options are their drinks. TIP: They do not serve any hot drinks! Only your typical staple of the OCC (can't remember if that's the correct brand) of canned oolong tea, green tea, ashahi and soft drinks.

Being in a group of 9, it wasn't the best option for intimate dining to catch up with friends and we probably were that group that's  loud and obnoxious. 

The faster you get your order in, the faster you get your food. It's always nice to see how the ramen cooks prepare your meal for you, no matter how far away you may be seated from them. Aside from the server mixing up two of our orders, everything went smoothly. 

However, it was very off putting for all of us to see the attitude of the cook towards the server who messed it up. We all mutually cringed at the tone of the cooks voice towards the female server as he grabbed the wrong ramen order from my friend who only needed the one missing item that she ordered because she got the same exact order as our other friend. Giving us the item would have sufficed instead or grabbing the whole bowl after my friend already took a few sips of the broth and was about to start eating the pork. As a group, we literally cringed as thoughts of her getting an earful later as we left  (We collectively said that hopefully she doesn't get beat - which I know is not a laughing matter, but to see him throw that bowl that he grabbed from my friend and threw on to their prep table and seeing the bowl bounce a little showed that they definitely need to handle their composure for future incidents better).

Broth was decent. Salty because it was chicken broth and we did choose the shio broth. Their charsiu pork was thick and flavorful. Definitely need to come back and try their don bowls and their tonkotsu broth.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,1,0,3,nberqv3kBhB2kDtWqZrWmQ

Their noodles are the straight noodles, not the wavy ones that I normally like. Instead of miso or tonkotsu broth, I tried the shoyu broth here.  It was good and I was amazed how clear and not fatty the broth tasted. I wanted to try a ramen with garlic oil, but for some reason they did not have any that day.

To top that off their broth is made with chicken NOT pork and with NO MSG! Don't get me wrong I was a little hesitant when I read chicken broth because I have not found a ramen place that made good flavorful chicken broth for ramen but damn their Tori Paitan was FIRE!!! 

Tori Paitan - Amazeballs!! This is the chicken version of Tonkotsu. The broth is so super rich, creamy, and packed with delicious flavor that after slurping all of my noodles I wanted to drink all of the broth and lick my bowl clean. The noodles were made fresh and cooked perfectly. You can tell difference from fresh made noodles and store bought noodles. It wasn't undercooked and hard like the noodles I had at Monta. 

All ramen bowls include Bamboo, Chashu Pork, Shredded Green Onions, and half of a medium boiled egg. I loved the charred flavor that came with their chashu pork. We saw them searing them right in front of us in the kitchen. Bamboo was seasoned nicely too with a nice fresh crunch texture when you bite into it. Next time I'll ask if I can have soft boiled egg bc I love that oozing yolk porn to go with my ramen. 

Easy to find Ramen Hashi is located in the same plaza as the yummy Korean BBQ restaurant Hobak in between Jones and Lindell off of Spring Mt. You can't miss this place bc it's right next to the KFC plaza. The inside of this restaurant is long with bar seating on the right all the way down facing the kitchen. Looks like they may add some tables on the left or will soon need to when business picks up. 

This is definitely the place to go for a guilt free healthier version of Ramen. Their specialty is in their chicken broths with no MSG. Tori Paitan is a must try. Drinks are coke products, calpico, tea, or Asahi Beer. For dessert finish it off with their French macaron Ice Cream Sandwiches. I will be back again soon with all my chicken loving friends. Service was great. Our server and the chefs were nice and fast so we were out of there in no time which is a major plus. Ramen Hashi has made it to my top 3 favorite Ramen places next to Ramen Sora and Jinya. Enjoy everyone!",_2Sa7pq5z2XOUhS9DOCGHw,4,2,5,GJf2QErIaNBl246edAFRjA

""Ramen is a noodle"" the simultaneous reply from me and my two Asian poker buds.

""I meant spaghetti and meatballs, Olive Garden stuff.  I need non Asian friends"" he sighs in defeat.

Ramen Hashi, the city's newest entrant into the Japanese noodle realm.

Short and sweet, it's OK. Not close to toppling the two Vegas institutions (Monta or Sora) but it's a quality bowl, fast and cheap.

Noodles - everyday Sun noodle variety.  Toothsome, gently seasoned, machine made noodles.

Broth - Basic tonkotsu.  Not heavily extracted but a good porky flavor, good amount of gelatin, hint of garlic and konbu.  Decent quality, slightly sweet soy added.  Agreeable.  The shio and shoyu broths are both chicken based.  Not very little extraction and almost no collagen.  Clean.

Toppings - Well made, flavorful chashu cut thicker than most places.  Very well made nitamago (seasoned soft boiled egg) but lacking deep flavor.

Basic service.  Quick with food taking five minutes from order to table.  Perfect.

If nothing's wrong, why not a higher rating?  I've had better.  The baseline in Hawaii includes shops straight from Japan.  Use of multi kinds of flour to make noodles, combination of different kinds of regionally sourced soy sauce in the broth adds up to complexity approaching the great shops of Japan, not to mention having had it at the best of the motherland.  That said, this is still plenty good and will probably satisfy most any ramen craving.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,37,33,3,wBb2OIUTy7NmOSjHYau96g

The seating area leaves something to be desired. The entire left half of the restaurant could easily fit another long bar seating area or some 2-person tables. The wait wasn't horrible, but could probably become a problem as they get more popular.

Food: they have 3 choices of ramen and a Chashu bowl. Has your basic add ons like extra egg, noodles, seaweed etc. The noodles are very fresh and made in house, but the broth to me was a little bland. The broth at Monta has always been my go-to. Our bill came out to $33 with our add-ons and drinks

restaurant is very spacious - only bar seating so not best for more than a group of 3-4 people since it can get a bit awkward, they could probably fit some small tables along the wall but not sure if that would make the walkway too narrow

So to start, you're sitting at a counter facing the wonderful gentleman that prepare your freshly made-in-house ramen noodles. You have the cutest little menu with an easy system: check off what you'd like in your bowl; from broth type, to the extra toppings that you can use to enhance your flavor. I did Shoyu, added seaweed, and extra noodles. I added black garlic oil but they were all out and happily replaced it with regular garlic.

What I liked was that they also place little canisters at your place setting with chili sauce, chili oil, seasoning, and ginger. Adding those truly made the flavor pop. 

They also leave a little carafe of water at your setting so you can serve yourself. 

Service was fast, friendly, and yummy. They pay attention to their guests, and check on you to make sure that you were taken care of. And good news, prices weren't too bad.

5349100,2017-10-22,3,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Ramen Hashi is here to change the ramen scene in Las Vegas. They make their own ramen in house and they make their soup bases from scratch. They focus more on their ingredients and try to bring out the freshness of everything they use. 

Table? A place to chill? Not Hashi. Ramen Hashi takes after the ramen shops in Japan. When you walk inside, there is just a bar and no tables. You order, you eat, and you go.

They have a small menu right now but later on, they'll be expanding their choices. The chef spent some of his time telling us about what his restaurant is about and what he plans to do later. They do make their ramen in house -- they're able to control the consistency of their ramen: how thin or how thick it is. He said he could even control how chewy it is, as well as how soft or how firm it is. He did mention that later, he will make an option for thicker ramen and he's working on better soup bases. 

Currently, they have a shio, shoyu, and tonkotsu base. Unfortunately, there was no tonkotsu available when we went since the pork bones he ordered did not get here in time for him to make the soup. 

I opted for their shoyu ramen and added black garlic oil. All of their ramens are $9.00 each. They all come with two pieces of chasu, bambo shoots, green onions, and half an egg. If you want to add anything else, it'll be an extra cost.

I personally really enjoyed my bowl of ramen. The garlic oil was delicious... even though garlic was all that I could taste. My friend did say that the shoyu broth tasted like water but my husband enjoyed the light flavors. The noodles itself were delicious -- perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of chew. The noodles kind of reminded me of the ones I had at Ichiban in Japan. 

Their chasu was probably the star of the show.  It was absolutely delicious. It had a good balance of meat and fat. It wasn't slim; instead, it was like pork belly...a good meaty piece. They give it a crisp char by putting a torch to it. It was just so good with the perfect amount of flavor. 

The chef mentioned to us that his goal was to make his soup bases light with less oil, which I definitely appreciate. I hate how all the ramen places in Las Vegas were heavy with oil. I like the strong flavor but not the disgusting oil/ heavy feeling that came with it. In Japan, they were able to make strong flavors yet it wasn't oily or heavy or disgusting. I honestly can't wait to try their tonkatsu.

After visiting Japan, I haven't been able to eat ramen. There were only one or two ramen restaurants where I was actually able to finish my bowl without feeling gross. I now welcome Hashi to the list. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend people to try Hashi. However, if you're used to strong flavors, you probably won't like it. If you like Monta, you probably won't like Hashi. Its okay... more Hashi for me! I'm excited to watch Hashi grow.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,7,3,4,XmiX7zxEg_v4Wp3r4-3x5Q
5369464,2018-04-29,0,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Love places where everything is made in house. This place doesn't disappoint. The noodles are all made in house and it's all chicken based compared to pork which  most ramen shops are. The only pork is the couple slices of blow torched pork belly but if for religious purpose or just don't eat pork then you can omit it. Really tho who doesn't like pork belly. (aka the stuff what bacon is made from) something wrongs in my opinion with you but each to their own.

The ramen comes out really fast literally I say in 5 minutes or less after ordering. It's all bar seating like Japanese ramen shops if you ever watched a video on YouTube. If your really hungry it's a great place since the food comes out rocket fast. 

The paitan ramen (equivalent of tonkasu pork ramen except chicken) was awesome, the broth was just perfectly balanced so rich and not too salty. They state no msg used and I have to say it's true since I didn't get thirsty after consuming all the broth. The umame flavor comes from the roasted chicken broth and soy sauce. The first thing you should do is upon getting the ramen, taste the broth first, savor the flavor. 
I personal think it's best left unmolested with crushed chilli's or togarashi (Japanese chilli powder seasoning)
Which they provide. I think the flavor is perfect on it's own. The chef perfectly balanced the flavor of the broth.

My ownly compaint is the portion is rather small in my opinion compared to the price.  While it's very artisanal with the fresh noodles they make and all. The portion is more Japanese portion rather than US portion. I even got extra noodles and found it to be a bit small  portion for the price. Remember extra noodles cost extra $$. Hence why the 4 stars rather than 5

The noodles are good. They have a rice bowl option if you need gluten free. The broth has lots of rich flavor -- the kind where you get layers of taste throughout a bite. The meat is perfectly cooked, and there are several options. Perfect eggs -- hard outside, runny inside.

It's neat how you sit at a single long table -- think sushi bar. They have condiments like ginger and hot paste, plus self serve water carafes, laid out for you. They even have rubber bands to help kids with chopsticks, in a little jar. You order quickly and easily with a little slip of paper like at a sushi restaurant. It's all very efficient. Also the restrooms are well lit and spotless.

I will be back again soon. My only sadness is that I don't live closer.",ukxqToZ6vk7QjyZxP4nz8Q,1,0,5,QJrYpfLUvEVV_bntSgfn1A
5620435,2017-12-08,6,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"There's never a bad time for ramen, but it's especially welcome when the weather turns cold.  Ramen Hashi is a new spot where there's only counter seating so maybe not the best place to meet a bunch of friends.  My first visit was with one girlfriend on a recent chilly Tuesday at 12:30pm and we were able to get seated right away.  Service was friendly and quick and after deciding what we would have (Tonkotsu for her and Shio for me), we had deep bowls of steaming noodle goodness before too long.  The Shio I had is a chicken based broth seasoned with salt and named the ""Chef's Recommendation"" on the menu-I loved it.  With four ramen choices on the menu (Shio, Shoyu, Tonkotsu, and limited quantities of Chashu Don), each order already comes with bamboo, chashu, green onion, and tamago for $9 per order.  Extra toppings available for extra price:  chashu, noodles, bamboo, green onion, tamago, onsen tamago, black garlic oil, and seaweed. 
For a first visit, we were very satisfied and look forward to another visit to try the other ramen selections.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,9,8,4,6DqwHkUeOjHpP06Huuov_g
5629953,2017-12-20,3,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Hubby, mom, brother and I popped in for a quick lunch.  We've been hearing / reading good things about Ramen Hashi and wanted to check it out.

The menu is simple.  For mains, you have four options, three of which are noodles and one is a cha shu bowl.  I ordered #1 (shio, chicken base) and added extra chashu and an onsen tamago while hubby got #2 shoyu, chicken base with extra chashu.

Every element of my bowl of noodles was very enjoyable.  The soup was flavorful without being over rich or salty.  The noodles (made in-house) were perfectly cooked.  The chashu was nicely flavored and torched prior to servicing.  I hardly ever eat chashu in my ramen but the chashu here was delicious and fatty, balancing out the entire bowl.

And, to my surprise, there was already half an egg included in my bowl so the onsen tamago sat prettily alongside it.  Both eggs were perfectly cooked. (I ended up eating the onsen tamago in one big slurp!)

The price is affordable.  The noodle bowl already includes some chashu, bamboo and half an egg so there is less of a need to build up your bowl with the extras, like at other places. One regret I had was that I did not get more noodles afterwards because everyone else was done eating.  

Hubby and I agreed that our favorite part of this meal was that we weren't thirsty after the meal.  While other ramen places are tasty, we always end up gulping down gallons of water afterwards.  We did not get that way at Ramen Hashi.

Definitely a place to check out!",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,5,4,5,sjVNUMzVWDAAHxLw-ynAjw

5660222,2018-05-26,0,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"I went there with my son for lunch.

Things I love:
Service - from the server to the cooks all of them provided excellent service. When the ramen was served the cook asked me to taste the soup to make sure it is to my liking. If not he said he will fix it.  
Also my son ordered extra noodle and they cooked his noodle when he was about half way done with this first serving and then served the second  serving when he was about to finish his first serving. It was a very nice touch to keep the second serving of noodle hot and firm.
Food also came out in about 5 minutes.
Ambiance - the place has clean and simple decoration.

Things I like:
The Chashu pork - good flavor and very tender. 
Their house made noodle was pretty good. Nice firmness not soggy.

Rest of it just okay:
The soup base was decent. I ordered their Tori Paitan which is the chicken version of the tonkotsu. It lacked of depth in flavor, probably because I prefer pork broth which tend to be a lot richer in flavor and they don't offer pork broth. I ordered black garlic oil with my noodle which helped and added a nice flavor to the ramen. I also tried the shoyu which my son ordered. It was just average, a little bland.

If you like lighter and more subtle flavor for your ramen then you will like this spot. But this just not my cup of tea.

Also the menu is really small just three soup bases and one rice dish. 

Food probably deserves 3.5 star but service was excellent and push my final rating to 4.",lW9B0GUMNjjdmo7JU3vRWg,0,0,4,vAdZUxTOoJbNWlqk5u6GOg

Food: the menu selection is pretty simple. I ordered the Tonkatsu. Maybe because I prefer fatty thick broths and a lot of meat, but I wasnt that thrilled about the order I had. It tasted really vinegary or bitter. The meat didn't taste that flavored and the noodles were just okay. The soft boiled egg however was cooked nicely. 

Ambiance: very simple and bright. There's no tables, just the counter tops adjacent to the open kitchen.

5716304,2017-10-21,4,z2CVPfaG8C_rydUZCcsqbw,"Lots of ramen in Vegas, so it was a nice surprise to see something different here at Hashi. 

Tonight I went with the Tonkotsu ramen ($9). Hashi's version is a simple bowl: noodles (thin, nice!), egg, green onions, bamboo, and meat (that fatty pork was bomb! - next time I'll order extra). It's a clean bowl that might seem to lack on overall flavor, but no! Sometimes the other established ramen spots have bowls with high on flavor or they're heavy on ingredients which'll make me wanna take a nap afterward (I still like those from time to time). Tonight, I came in after a workout and I think I got just the right proportion. 

They're still only a week into their opening and I have a couple notes. A green tea was ordered and never came yet ended up on the bill somehow. There were probably two orders ahead of us (party of 2 and party of 3) and our order took nearly half an hour. Yes, they're still new and I imagine it'll only improve. 

The atmosphere is super clean. The lighting, the counter, and open visible kitchen, all a very nice touch. At the moment there's only counter seating but soon, table seating will line the wall.

It's noodle and pork heaven in a creamy rich chicken (yes chicken!) broth. Many ramen houses over season their soup. This was just sheer perfection. It took all my willpower not to order a 2nd bowl. Are there other places I should try out in Vegas? Probably, but if they're not as good, I'm going to have the old ""shoulda gone here instead"" regret.

Upon walking in the hostess/ server was great and the people behind the counter seemed happy.   I like that there was a lot of space so they could add tables one day if needed. 

I appreciate that they make ramen and that's it.   You pick the specifics but there aren't extra items or anything to take focus from the ramen itself.   That being said I expected this ramen to be great.   Instead what I got was mediocre. 

Yes, they make the noodles themselves fresh everyday.  The noodles were good and perfectly cooked.   However, the broth was so lackluster.   I got the tonkotsu and my friend got the shio.  Both lacked flavor and depth.   I usually don't like adding extras to my broth but I had to add chili paste, togarashi, chili oil, and ginger to give it some flavor.  That's bad.   Awful actually.

I thought the service was terrible too after the initial welcome.   I kept waiting and signaling to get the check.   Finally I had to just get up to get it.   It wasn't that busy inside.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,2,2,2,sxcl_8sqziHci1rkg6sbsg

They have complementary ginger unlike most of Ramen restaurants who would charge customers for gingers. (One other Ramen restaurant charged me $0.50 for ginger without even asking me and it was on the bill. Really?) I love spicy food so it was great to have spicy paste condiment that I could add as much as I wanted. Staffs were very attentive and friendly.

First thing to stand out was their supposed opponent to the Tonkatsu Shoyo Ramen, which was their Tori Paitan. I was skeptical at first but after having it, I could personally say it does stand toe to toe. The ramen here generally offers a more smooth, mild tasting base. It lets other components stand out! From beautifully charred pork, in house made noodles to its soft boiled egg. 

Their establishment is very spacious, easily accessible with a very simple concept. Another thing that caught my eye was their ""self serving"" mini station for every table. This enables us consumers play around and find our own preferences. It also saves time! Speaking of time, they offer excellent, speedy service! Your order comes out in less than 3-4mins!

The shio ramen was okay. To me it was kind of bland. The shoyu ramen on the other hand was delicious. I felt bad but I kept taking some from my friend's haha! The tamago was cooked perfectly! I hate how some ramen places have the egg cold. This wasn't the case here. The ramen noodles were also delicious. The Chashu was also very tasty and tender.

I would definitely opt out of suggesting the shio ramen. The shio ramen at Sora is better, but the shoyu here is definitely worth trying!

I ordered the shoyu ramen and added extra noodles. The good part about ordering extra noodles is that they fire up the second portion after you have finished some of your first portion of noodles. They do this so that way the noodles are at the perfect state when you get around to eating the second helping.
