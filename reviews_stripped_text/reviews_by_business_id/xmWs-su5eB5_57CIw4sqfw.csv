Always hommade, fresh, and tasty, and if you're not happy, they will make it right.  They also claim to make something not on the menu for you if you want, though we've never taken advantage of this.  Total mom and pop type place with the family running, serving, socializing.

The place is kind of small and can get loud...so not the best if you're trying to have a serious convo.  Good stuff though.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,1,0,4,mBoYTK71Zk_skyCJqvTZQw

The food is all fresh and hand made.  The bread reminded me of my grandmothers, the pasta was perfect, and the chocolate salami dessert was incredible. In addition, the prices were very reasonable.

This is a wonderful little Italian restaurant and apparently a secret to many. Please,  Spread the word ... we need to support the small restaurant owners.

WHY frequent the mass produced corporate owned eateries that proliferate the Vegas Valley when we have in our backyard this independently owned, and lovingly operated jewel?  

We try to always support the smaller, family owned & run eateries and find that we are infrequently disappointed.  Gina's Tops our List !!

Last night we dined on steaming bowls of the most delicious Pasta Fagioli I've ever had, it was served with a basket of warm & wonderfully crusty Italian bread (a new bread to Ginas).  We chose a lovely bottle of Sangiovese Puglia, an Italian Red wine that Vince suggested.  A PERFECT meal for a cold evening.

Gina's is a small but delightful restaurant. Don't be put off by the exterior of the building. This place is a gem. 
The owner waits on you while his mom is in the kitchen cooking for you. It is not unusual for me to dine at Gina's once a week. 
The prices are reasonable and the food is wonderfully homemade. Every evening they have 2 or 3 specials. If you have a request for something not on the menu or would like a dish modified, they will do their best to accommodate you. Being a vegetarian with a sensitivity to tomatoes, they always come through with a great meal. 
They make all of their desserts (delicious) and Wednesday is half price bottle of wine night.

We all loved that the place was fairly casual and moderately priced, but it was the wonderful food and friendly and professional service that won us over. 

I personally don't know a lot about wine, but my friends are pretty sophisticated when it comes to the grape...and they seemed quite content with the wine menu and their selection for the table. Again, I can't tell you if they have a great wine list or not, but we all enjoyed the reasonably priced wine that we ordered.

They serve really delicious bread!

We decided to share an appetizer of fried calamari, which turned out to be a bit of a mistake for two reasons. First of all, the portions of the pastas and entrees that were served later on were absolutely enormous. All four of us took food home. Secondly, I wasn't crazy about their calamari. I usually love fried calamari, but I found Gina's take on it to be a little mushy and not seasoned well. The breading was not crisp and there was hardly any salt mixed in. The presentation was fantastic and the serving was very large so when it was put on the table I was extremely optimistic. Unfortunately, it was a let down. My fellow diners all agreed. 

Other than that, the rest of the meal was perfect! Honestly, it was one of the best Italian meals that we had all had in a while and we all vowed to come back. The waiter couldn't have been more friendly or professional. The service was excellent.

All in all, Gina's Bistro was excellent and the only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because of the calamari.

We will be back for sure!",ngk1yxWvxCuO_lvJ87PReg,0,0,4,gOBiVFQD1gBD0wnAcdQR4Q

The food was great.
Went here for my birthday and it was my first time here.
My mom had the special which was the sole. She said it was very moist and delicious. My husband had the lasagna. He didn't leave any on the plate.

Just the right amount of breading and cheese. Incredible flavor. 
Every Italian restaurant I go to must pass the meatball test and this place did with flying colors.
The food reminded me of my step-fathers. He was a big Italian that made great food.

The young man who was from Italy went on to say that they didn't, mostly because they aren't able to get the same ingredients here to make it like they do back home. Therefore, they don't make it. I was so impressed!! That was my first sign that this would be REAL authentic Italian food. He then said that if we were to come back, to call in the morning requesting pesto and he would see what he could find here to make it as authentic as it is back home. Just that was so impressive to us!!

Free fresh bread to snack on which we loved while ordering. We split the Calamari appetizer ($12.99) which was 100% worth it! It came with a fresh, and I mean FRESH marinara sauce. It was so authentic and I seriously could have drank the sauce. The portion size of this apatizer was HUGE and we were both stuffed and didn't even finish it. Because we were so full, we split an entree (a daily special, some sort of ziti bake with mozarella on top). EVerything was to DIE for. I could tell it was all made to order, FRESH, and authentic. It makes Olive Garden look like absolute complete trash.

It is small, but cozy- like a family owned place should be. There were several other tables, but we were seated quickly, drink order taken and specials explained  from the new owner, Rosa. She and her family now run the place, having bought it from Gina in October. It was lovely to be served by the whole family (mother, father and son)- something rare in Las Vegas! 

Apparently most of the menu has stayed the same, with a few new dishes and some regional tweaks to make it more authentic to reflect the origin (Naples) of the new owners.

We ordered a glass of wine each, caprese (amazing balsamic), cioppino and farfalle with mushrooms in a light cream sauce. All of it was top notch and could have easily been double the price on the strip.

Service was attentive but not overbearing and once the rest of the tables had left, we had a very lovely chat with the new owners.

Dessert was a canolli and tiramisu- both made in house and both very well made! The tiramisu wasn't heavy at all- light as a feather. We had espresso and a capuccino as well- both hand made and not from an automatic machine. I could go back for that alone they were so good!

You can bring your own wine- which is nice if you like higher end wine, as the selection is limited (but adequate) and the family will go out of their way to make your experience or celebration a night to remember.

Portions run on the generous side- which means we get to enjoy  the leftovers  tomorrow at lunch! Prices are moderate to low for the quality and quantity, many items at other off-strip locations run double.

For those who didn't have a good experience previously- I would say return and experience the new owners- they are very nice and gracious.

We both ordered hand-made pasta with fresh sauces (mine the strozzapretti with lamb marinara, and my husband's the tagliatelli with meatballs, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, peas). Both were perfectly cooked and delicious, and both were enormous portions which would really feed two, but they were so good we ate more than we should. We also had the caesar salad which was perfectly dressed and also delicious. To put this in perspective, we could call ourselves foodies, and we've eaten at many great restaurants such as the French Laundry and Bouchon and many places in SF and the wine country, so we do have high expectations. At a place like this, it makes the most sense to go with what they do well -- the homemade pasta. We weren't disappointed. Also, the service was perfect. We were served by one of the three owners who was attentive and friendly, but not overly so.

I docked a star because the air conditioning system is very poor, it was hot 3 years ago and it is still hot now. They have fans on and luckily they don't make noise and are not loud, but in this warm summer heat, you definitely need a stronger air conditioning unit.

1026588,2012-04-14,1,xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw,"Oh, my.  Had dinner here Thursday evening.  I was suprised to be the only diner when I arrived at about 7:30 PM; two couples had also arrived by the time I left.  The quiet meant there was plenty of time to take counsel with the owner (Gina!) about the menu.

I had the aroncini for a starter, and strozzapretti for the main course.  I thought about the lamb (chop) special, but just those two courses were more than I could eat.

Gina taught me an important lesson: ""Listen to Gina!"".  I only wanted a glass of wine, and saw the Vino Nobile on the wine list.  As it's an historically significant wine, and I'd never tried it, I ordered it--even though Gina had recommended a Malbec or a Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon to accompany my meal choices.  She brought the Vino Nobile--and a sample of the Cabernet!  And she was right!  The Vino Nobile was fine with the mild--yet delicious--aroncini.  But with the strozzapretti, it seemed thin and sour.  But the Cabernet kept up with the rich pasta.  So I asked Gina to bring a glass of the Cabernet as well, and enjoyed the rest of the meal!

Gina claims to be no expert on wines, but by golly, she knows what goes best with her menu selections!  There are more than adequate selections on the menu and wine list to fully satisfy anyone who enjoys authentic Italian cuisine.

Las Vegans: PLEASE support this fine little establishment!!!  This is one you defintiely would not want to lose!

Edit: I forgot to mention this.  I had originally thought to have pasti i fagioli (and Gina pronounces it correctly, not like some New Yawk hoodlum!), but was told it was off the menu, as the season is getting too warm for such a soup.  I think that's neat.  And the aroncini was delicious anyway!",LEHVkcxBd66fBC1vXlWTSQ,5,1,5,yOVFJfG6DsF3goKz_BDPiQ

Gina's is in a cute little room that can't seat more than 40 people.  There is one unisex bathroom that must be entered from the outside (yikes!).

The pasta is hand made and cooked to perfection.  The sauces were also perfect, not too salty or too rich.  Just right.  I'm used to eating pasta off the Sysco truck or assembled in a corporate kitchen somewhere. Dining at Gina's was like eating pasta for the first time!

The prices are very reasonable.  In fact, the prices would be reasonable even if the food were merely average.  Most entrees were under $20.

quaint little restaurant - felt a little cramped but not a big deal.  Server had thick Italian accent - he did a great job the entire time we were there.

We shared several apps - Caesar salad, arrancini and calamari.  My fav of the group was the calamari but all were above average ( forgot pics of these ) 

Main entrees:

Chicken Marsala
Lasagne
Gnocchi
Fettucine Alfredo w/ sausage.

All entrees at or under $16

I thought all were decent, especially liked the meat ragu within the lasagna, the lightness of the gnocchi, the rich alfredo sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked. About the only negative thing was the sausage within the alfredo - we all agreed the sausage was a breakfast link - I almost dropped the rating to 3 stars for this ! But dang, the rest of the meal was very good and the service delightful so I opted to only ding one star.

It is very clean looking when you walk in. All the tables had such crisp white clean linens it was refreshing. 
Our server was a very attentive young man and took the time to tell us the specials. 
I ordered the chicken sorrentino as the server recommended, after I asked him of the 3 entrees i was looking at, he stated the sorrentino was the best and described the dish and told me why he thought that. And he was right. It was so light and delicious. The chicken pounded down to the perfect thinness. I can not eat thick chicken breasts in such dishes as this. The eggplant was light and tasty and most important not laden down with grease. 
My favorite dinner companion, my son! had the gnocchi. He also enjoyed his dinner.

We arrived for our 5:30 reservation and two other tables in the ~40 seat place occupied.In my online reservation, I had requested a split of prosecco to the table with glasses once we were seated. No mention and nowhere in sight. Oh well.

My butter dish (under my napkin) was really dirty, so I swapped it with the table next to me. Out of habit, I also checked the pre-set wine goblet - mine had a greasy smear inside. Eww. The (only) waiter caught me holding it up, and took both of them and then gave us two goblets from another table. He reviewed the specials (no mention of price), and we ordered our wine. Well, we tried to order a mid-priced bottle of white. However, they were out of all but the 2 most expensive whites, as they are ""redoing their wine selection"". I chose from the remaining two - at almost twice the price - and we moved on. We tried to order the arancini for an app - that and the eggplant for the apps they were out of. So, we ordered one of the appetizer specials - a potato pancake with mozzarella in the center. Husband ordered pappardelle with a meat sauce (which was really a simple bolognese) and I ordered cavatelli with broccoli and Italian sausage. 

As noted in another review - the bread was strange. The busser made sure to tell us it was their HOMEMADE bread, it almost had the consistency of a biscuit. The appetizer was good comfort food - after all, potatoes and cheese - but would have benefited from perhaps being plated in marinara, or with a drizzle of good olive oil, as it became progressively more dry in the mouth as one ate more. More on the appetizer later. Husband's meal was good - they pappardelle was clearly fresh - and the bolognese was meaty. Mine was also acceptable - the cavatelli was cooked appropriately, the broccoli and broccoli-pesto were good. The sausage was sliced into ""coins"", which would have probably been better incorporated into the dish as a ground sausage or at least out of the casing. The dish could have used perhaps some kick of red pepper flakes to brighten it up - and I say this because I make something VERY similar at home.

The food was something that we could easily have made at home. We got the bill - it was $14 for the appetizer (the arancini was a $7.95 appetizer), and the wine was almost $50 (the bid-price bottle was $27). We spent almost $100 on a meal that we pretty much could have made at home. 

Also to note - I overheard the waiter explaining to another table that they only had 2 kinds of bottled beer available out of what they listed. IMHO, I really think that this place might be closing its doors sometime soon. With their wine and beer offerings depleted, some of their less expensive items 86'ed within 30 minutes of dinner starting, and having such a limited wait staff for a Saturday night, makes you wonder if it will still be there in the near future. It seemed to us that they are using up what they have on hand in order to shut their doors.",LKvVZycVBZPgxQDK8yPXfw,1,0,2,wc5jtBQCh3I4H-cU7NL6bQ

Located in an unattractive strip mall, the restaurant is nothing short of unimpressive from the parking lot. However, upon walking in you are immediately transported to a quaint restaurant in Italy. There is probably only 12 tables in the entire joint with enough seating for 30-40 people. The tables are romantically lit and there are many framed photographs of Italy all over the walls. Having been to Italy multiple times, it is literally a copy of a restaurant you would find in Italy. The owner is also Italian with a heavy Italian accent. Can't get more Italian that that!

We were sat and quickly received bread and wine. There is a good wine selection of only Italian wines, authenticity people! The bread was fine (could have used a little warmer) with olive oil and vinegar for the table, love it! I ordered the Chianti and for $6 and a large pour, it can't be beat,

We ordered a bruschetta appetizer which was made with fresh tomatoes and garlicky (don't recommend if on a first date). It was also very messy to eat (reason #2 not to order on a first date). However, it was very good although, I could have used a little more oil on the crostini itself. Its also only $5.95 which is very inexpensive for the amount of appetizer you get. 

For our entrees we ordered the eggplant parm and the chicken parm (really branching out, I know!). Seriously, 5++ stars on the entrees! The eggplant parm was layered and delicious with a TON of sauce. Their sauce is the best ever. Authentic Italian sauce made by grandma in the kitchen-level good. I like my pasta and eggplant parm super saucy too so it was perfect. If you don't like a lot of sauce, I would recommend asking them to go light on it. The entree was paired with some of the best angel hair pasta I have ever had. Once again  covered in their delicious sauce! I tried my husband's chicken parm and it was equally as good. 

Honestly, this place is amazing and it was sad to see so many tables empty on a Saturday night. This is SUCH a great place. Service is so attentive, my mouth is watering while writing this review because of the amazing food, and the ambiance transports you to Italy.

The sausage and sauce that surround the pasta are amazing.  I think I even detect some truffle oil.  Wow this is so good.

Our waiter told us that they had none of the wines on the wine list, but put it out anyway because their new wine list for their new wines wasn't printed.  A bit quirky, but he recommended a Pinot Grigio and it was decent...so onward.

As this was our first time there, we asked the waiter for recommendations and ordered our food.  Me:  fried bread and mozzarella in tomato sauce and filet of sole francese.  Gf:  calamari (recommended by server) and (what else?!) cioppino.  

My appetizer was a glorified grilled cheese sandwich; nothing special, but not bad and a huge serving.  My gf's appetizer did not come at all.  We shared and got halfway through my appetizer, when we asked the waiter about her calamari.  He said it would be ready in 3 minutes.  Obviously, they started cooking it right then, and a few minutes later, out came her calamari and my entree!  

Her calamari was not good.  The breading was decent, but the squid itself was not.  The dipping sauce, however, was excellent.  This place has some of the better tomato sauce we've had in Las Vegas.  

Let's talk entrees:  My fish was raw on the inside.  If you check my profile, I love sushi, but not half-cooked, half-raw lower quality fish.  The francese sauce seemed good, but it was hard to get over the mushy egg-coating and raw inside.  The side of vegetables were excellent, but I'm really starving for something good to say.  (pun?)  

We asked about my gf's entree and were told it would be out soon.  About 30 minutes later, we left without getting my fish or her cioppino.  Our waiter obviously let us down.  We spent 1 hr and 20 minutes in there and got a glass of wine each, a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of undercooked calamari.  We left $40 on the table and walked out.  

Our waiter never admitted a single mistake, nor brought a comp'd glass of wine to hold us during our wait.  In fact, our wine glasses were empty for between 30-45 minutes and still did not get the attention of our waiter.  The owner did not acknowledge a mostly uneaten bowl of calamari and an entree that was sent back.  When we walked out, we passed the owner who couldn't be bothered to even spare us a glance.  

This restaurant was not busy.  There was no reason that a table of six, who arrived 30 minutes after we did, should be finishing their entrees when we walked out hungry and unserved.  Also, there was a brand new busgirl.  She was sweet, but had no training and was left to her own devices.  She was the only one who saw our unhappiness, but was obviously in no position to do anything about it.  

To quote my gf, ""Our romantic dinner turned the entire evening sour.""  Thanks for nothing, Gina.",WRiS2BiHblDHN-9SQlR_BA,15,0,1,b3oEGHTKgwRVT-J_AR1thg

My wife and i were shocked by how cozy and nice they made this place, It is nice to dine in a place that is comfortable, quiet , romantic and elegant in a simple way. The service was great, it is a true family run operation. Mom seats you, son and husband takes the order and son's girlfriend brings it out in no time. everyone try their best to make you realize how much they appreciate you being there. So enough of the atmosphere, how is the food?  Very nice, little place like this is usually handicapped as they have limited resource to order the freshest daily as they might have to let it spoil for not using it, not this place, everything is fresh, nicely prepared and tasty. Not overly salty like so many Italian places but prepared well and dosn't need to hide their flaws with a pound of salt. portions are perfect and price is average for a real restaurant. If you a re looking for a table cloth version of olive garden, then you will be disappointed ( see bad review below as the person expects salad with dinner have obviously never heard of ala carte and expect food to go along with dinner ! LOL ) I order liguine with clams and it was very good, clam was fresh, not sandy and pasta we perfect , not too soft as they usually are...just right. Warm spinach salad was great too and wife's spaghetti was home made with fresh tomato sauce , not out of a jar....so nice to get that and fast too! The dessert, well there is another story here..in one word... heavenly! They make the tiramisu there and it is unconventional but great! Just try it, you will love it. It is 10 steps above most of the local italian places as we eat out 4-6 times a week and all the other local italian places uses can sauce, soggy pasta and costco dessert...this place is closer to il molino than olive garden...well not quite il molino but then again does anyone dare to comapre themselves to il Molino? but hey at 1/3 the price( $65 for two with salad and dessert ) it is great food with perfect bistro atmosphere. We went back just yesterday and have the same experience and when the check came, they gave us a secret envelop which we can only open when we return the third time, guess we are having dinner there in a few days!

Seriously, ignore any reviews of this establishment prior to October of 2010 when the new owners took over.  The dining experience at Gina's Bistro was stellar from beginning to end, and one of the finest dining excursions we have had in over a decade in Las Vegas.

The owners are charming and doting from the moment you walk in the door.  From drink service, to the explanation of the entrees, to the food service to the deserts, every item was prepared to perfection, and utterly delectable.  I thoroughly enjoyed my pork loin (which was one of the special this evening) and my wife had a Cioppino that was spectacular.  The deserts were some of the best we've had at any restaurant regardless of genre, and again the service was top notch all around.

The wine list is not expansive, but well rounded and offers a choice for any palette.

There is absolutely no excuse for dining at one of the corporate, mass produced food warehouses with fare that would only appeal to those afflicted with a severe lack of taste.  This establishment is a true jewel in a city that prides itself on world-class dining.  Do yourself a favor and visit them for dinner.",HVjzF123P8MoP8NM0oAnGg,1,1,5,F5yDYZf1XM17M-ZknFXZRA

I also had a house salad with house dressing that was very fresh and dressed with house dressing that was excellent. My hubby had the sole with seafood special. Also excellent and a Caesar salad that was delish. For dessert he had the ""chocolate salami"". Also good.

However, the food was the worst I have ever eaten in an Italian restaurant. Bar none! The thin sliced read was stale, and my chicken marsala was inedible. The chicken was so gristly that there was only one square inch I could eat, and I could not cut through any of the other pieces. It was not overcooked nor undercooked, it was just poor cuts of chicken that were full of muscle. 

There was no detectable marsala flavor, and the mushrooms were rubbery and CANNED! The overall flavor of the sauce was tinny, with no detectable flavor notes. There was no love in this dish, no layering of flavors, nothing worth eating. 

My husband enjoyed his veal, but agreed the bread was too stale to eat, and noted that his red sauce was very salty. The staff could not have been better: they did everything in their power to make it right - offering me another dish, which I declined as I didn't want my husband to have to wait for me to get another meal. Though I did not ask, the server removed the horrible chicken marsala from our bill. I can't say enough about the integrity, professionalism and friendliness of the waitstaff. But I will never have the courage to try their food again. Thin sliced stale bread? Canned mushrooms? Nope. 

I've never been so disappointed with a restaurant, and sincerely hope the regular chef wasn't cooking. If I never eat another canned mushroom, I will never miss it. I really wanted to love this place as much as other reviewers obviously did. I'm so sorry I can't recommend it.",HMpoGgARRlHgcFXB3HHAMg,6,1,2,WTtuBXWYg9yppAHCEW8p2A

But the best part is the ""welcome home"" feeling you get each time you walk in.  

Whether it's for dinner with the family or a date, or you just need an attitude adjustment  (Chianti and an appetizer does me just fine) maybe after a long day before you get home, stop in and enjoy the harmony.

The food is way above average, the wine satisfying, prices are modest and the love that goes into the food is worth every cent.  Heads above the cookie cutter locations that offer ""Family Italian"" - trust me on that.

The wine choice,  is alright. I would rather have a sweet Merlot than a bitter cab.  

I am grateful for the accommodating staff available to tend to my family members. 

The main courses included a lemon dipping sauce for the fish part. The fish comes deep fried and battered with a non grainy, non flaky, non crunchy coating. In other words it was like the Tyson fish animal shaped, but tasted pretty good. Not like Tyson at all after tasting the fish. 

But I wanted to try his fried chicken but I was out voted,  and vetoed. So. ..no one got fried chicken.

About the only downside to the location is that their bathroom is ""outside"". You have to walk out of the restaurant into a separated bathroom area, similar to how some gas stations are set up.

After being sat, we were greeted by Riccardo, who I believe is also a part owner. If you can't tell by his accent, he is from Italy and has a lot of experience in Italian cuisine. He explained some things on the menu and when I questioned him on a few choices I was considering, he suggested my secondary choice of the Strozzapreti alla Norcina. The dish which he said is extremely popular in his hometown features hand rolled pasta with a sausage ragu in a cream based sauce. Similar to a dumpling like texture, the strozzapreti noodles are thick and were cooked perfectly. Being that they're hand rolled, there's a small section in the middle that acts almost like a bowl for the sauce. Their cream sauce is light, but has great flavor and has a hint of truffle oil in it as well. With the sausage mixed in, it's makes a perfect combination for a very meaty and flavorful pasta dish. 

We also ordered a piece of their NY style cheesecake to share, and were pleasantly surprised. Sticking with the same theme as the rest of their menu, the cheesecake is made in house and was extremely tasty. The crust was a nice thick and buttery graham cracker that wasn't too hard and added perfect texture. The cheesecake itself was rich and it didn't have that chalky or pasty type of texture you find at a lot of restaurants. Drizzled lightly with chocolate sauce and fresh whipped cream, I'd highly recommend a slice to finish out your meal.

Alongside excellent service and food, the prices here aren't one bit questionable for the quality. I noticed some other reviews suggest that you'll be spending a big chunk of change, which might be true if you're ordering apps, drinks, desserts, etc. But we walked out of there for just a little over $60 including tip. Not even taking into consideration the area, that's a price I wouldn't hesitate paying over and over again. 

Personally, I'm nowhere near finishing off my long list of Italian restaurant bookmarks, but if you're looking for a solid and authentic Italian meal, check out Gina's Bistro...you won't be disappointed.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,9,7,4,azs_P2GGMgiipsWWCU7srA

The atmosphere was very charming, a small restaurant with a comfortable dining room. The background music was a pleasant selection but the audio system was a little scratchy.

Our server was very pleasant and with assistants the service was timely and attentive. The caprese appetizer contained large slices of mozzarella but I was expecting tastier tomatoes  being they are at peak availability from local markets. The breast of chicken in lemon sauce was tasty and cooked perfect but more attention should be paid to trimming the gristle. The salmon almafi did not taste like salmon, it was just ok. Maybe it was cooked in to much olive oil? The salmon was to be served with a topping of sun dried tomatoes but mine had fresh tomato pieces. Both entrees came with a side of mixed vegetables of broccoli, carrots, spinach, and mushrooms which were perfectly cooked al dente.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,2,1,3,3oVWqd8qJ4VvoswseVREJw

I read on the website and learned of the powerhouse  team that is running the restaurant so I wasn't surprised it was really nice. We loved the small intimate feel of the place. The host had a thick Italian accent which I really enjoyed. Especially being in an Italian restaurant. 

PROS: 
*Caesar's Salad - looks plain in the pictures but the dressing they make from scratch is on point.

*Eggplant alla Parmigiana- HUGE portion. The eggplant was thin and breaded stacked on top of each other (3 or 4 layers) then home-made mozzarella melted with sauce on top. If I could change one thing I would ask for a little more sauce on the eggplant.

*Chicken Sorrento- Chicken breast with eggplant and mozzarella with sauce. Tender chicken, large portion. 

*Pasta comes with the entrees

*Italian host - his accent

*Pasta is hand made on the premises. Desserts are all home made too. All Italian desserts!


CONS:
*Only open for dinner


There was a tv set in the upper corner of the room but muted. A cooking show was on at 7:30pm Friday night. I didn't understand why that was there or even turned on. But I wasn't facing the tv and it didn't bother me. It just seemed out of place for the atmosphere the restaurant aired. Make reservations on the weekend.

The menu has plenty of Italian American classics -- perfect for those more accustomed to dining at chain restaurants. The consensus from the table was that the food was decent, not stellar. After sifting through a heavy layer of mozzarella, the lasagna was a nice blend of well seasoned ground meat and ricotta. It was really unfortunate that the flavors were drowned out by the top layers of cheese. Others at the table were satisfied with a mussels and clams dish and the chicken parmigiana -- two decent sized breaded chicken breasts accompanied with a side of spaghetti. The most disappointing dish was a veal dish with only slivers of meat in a white sauce that was also accompanied by a side of spaghetti in marinara sauce, an odd combination of sauces for one dish. Other restaurant oddities include employees with Italian accents that will have you wondering if they're real or not and a restroom located outside of the restaurant, towards the end of the building.

3837757,2016-03-25,2,xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw,"I was feeling somewhat down the day before, and needed the very familiar comfort of warm food to soothe my anxiety. My fiancé felt like Italian, more authentic than anything we've ever dabbled in around Vegas. So we rounded a corner onto Durango and discovered Gina's...which is perhaps the most delightful little hole I've stumbled upon (I've been discovering several in the last two weeks or so). 

The exterior is sore to the eyes due to age, but the first step inside truly does smooth over any doubt or concerns. The tables are draped white, topped with stemmed glasses reflecting the mid-day sun that peeks through windows. The kitchen can be barely seen between curtains that reside behind the hostess booth. A low lighting accompanies Italian opera which elicits light conversation without drowning words or being spoken over. Wines decorate shelves and corners, mirrors and artwork reach across each wall in a tactful manner. It's truly adorable, and very clean. 

Although the looks are quaint and darling, the service and food are truly what make this place a gem. 

I was a crying mess that day (we'd just lost our dog). I was all over my words, spilling red things on pristine white tablecloths and attempting to laugh it off. Truly intolerable, if not simply clumsy. However, our waitress was polite and very generous. She was patient, even with us being the only people left in the room. Both she and our host took care of us, and tolerated our every question, concern or request.

Riccardo and Ralica are truly wonderful. Their recommendations and absolutely politeness were stunning. I'd go back, if only to say hello again. Riccardo began our meal by recommending some specials of the day, which was inclusive of our appetizer and the complimentary basket of home made bread. It was amazing, to note. Though I don't recall the name (I'm humble to admit that I am no Italian), I can say that it was delightful. A must try. A light and flavorful broth with cooked down tomatoes, accompanied by potatoes that are the perfect consistency. We dipped the bread in, as suggested. Wonderful. 
 
I went on to order the Ravioli d` Aragosta. Definitely homemade raviolis. The lobster inside was immensely flavorful and stood out despite the robustness of the pink sauce. The amount in each ravioli was generous, and the textures of the lobster with the pasta surrounding it was divine (I'm afraid of mushiness due to the old Chef Boyardee days). Simply: It was wonderful.

My fiancé ordered the Vitello Sorrentina, which was just as incredible, if not more so. The moistness of the veil was very good. The marinara was wonderful...it was exactly what I've been searching for since the Italian Bistro in California. I had a small taste. He refused to share anymore. 

We took home dessert, which was three thick slices of Shokoladnaya Kolbasa. Also known as Chocolate Salami. I believe Riccardo referred to it by a different name, though this is what I'd known it to be in Russian. A delectable, rich, creamy chocolate dessert, rolled and treated like a sausage of sorts, the cut up to be served. Inclusive of sweet crisps and nuts, served with a small side of cream. Amazing. 

Throughout the entire evening, Ralica kept our glasses full to the brim. Even after we were finished eating, and stayed a few minutes to talk. She's incredibly sweet, and such a lovely individual to speak to.

Overall, our experience here was very pleasant. Riccardo even took the time to introduce us to his mother and grandmother, who are the actual chefs behind the scenes. It was a lovely gesture, and we appreciate every aspect of Gina's. The prices are not for everyday dining (at least not for college students like us), but the food is definitely worth the costs. Riccardo presented a coupon that can be used within the next two weeks, which was also great! I intend to bring my grandparents here before they leave for Korea (they've been craving Italian since they landed).",2YOWAF4_uQZ3ToABzRh4hA,5,4,5,UaytKfgj-8XcJrysvwkjKQ

That's how we came across Gina's Bistro and it's glowing reviews.  We headed down there for dinner on a Friday night after making reservations earlier in the day.  Gina's Bistro is located in a shopping complex right next to a Salvation Army store.  From the outside the bistro doesn't look like much but on the inside it's a cute little restaurant with dim lighting, white table clothes, ideal for a date night.  The place itself is small with about 15 tables inside.  When we went inside the place only had about 3-4 other occupied tables at the time so reservations were probably not needed.  Service was nice enough nothing too memorable.  However, the food left a lot to be desired.  

We ate:
-Homemade Bread (free) - The bread was a little bit on the chewy side and had a spongy texture to it.  When I took a bite of the bread it felt like I was chewing for a good minute before being able to swallow it down.  Can't complain too much I guess since it was free.  
-Caesar Salad ($7.50) - My friend and I shared this as an appetizer, personally both my friend and I like a robust Caesar salad dressing and the one served here was a bit too mild and watered down for our taste.  
-Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) - The cheese raviolis could have been good but I had no way of knowing because the entire dish was overpowered by the sauce which had a strong tart/sour taste to it.   
-Penne Campagnola ($14.95) - My friend ordered this dish and the roasted garlic chicken was pretty tasty and the sun dried tomatoes was a nice addition to the dish, however, the dish was again overpowered by the tart/sour sauce.   

I'm really sad that we did not end up liking this place, I was hoping this restaurant would be a hidden gem to eat at.  At least I can say that I tried this place and didn't like it...on to the next Italian restaurant to try!",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,3,1,2,E9LLIgQ1Rb6i4-3bdOs4zg

First, the place is small & in a strip plaza, but don't let the outside appearance & neighbors jade your opinion/sway your decision to eat here.  Stick with me...it's worth it!  Inside, it's  dimly lit in an attempt at mood lighting & a little cramped w/ tables close together.  And that's the end of the sketchy part.  All good from here!

Service - 5 stars.  Some nights it's packed & others you can walk in.  Just to be safe, make a reservation.  The servers are very attentive & in tune with how you want dinner paced.  The food is always delivered in sync & you aren't trying to finish appy's & your entree is already out.

Appy's - 4stars. calamari is decent+, could use a little more salt, but the batter is crunchy good!  Not the best, but you can't go wrong if you like calimari.  The arancini is outrageously yummy.  At only 2, it's a little small if you're sharing around the table though so order accordingly.

For entrees, I've tasted the seafood fettuccini, the mushroom risotto (garlicky deliciousness & large so you will have leftovers), chicken Marsala (Crazy amount of mushrooms!), cheese ravioli, sausage risotto (very unique..ate it ALL) & eggplant parm....all delicioso!  5stars

4371774,2011-06-13,0,xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw,"Tried it for the first time with my bf due to the reviews here on Yelp. We originally planned on going to Kai, which was a Japanese restaurant right behind it, but we didn't make it in time for happy hour so he asked about that ""bistro"" I mentioned before. As we entered through the door we were welcomed by its cozy and quirky Italian ambiance. The wait staff consisted of father and son, and the mom was stationed at the cash register; which really gives off the ""family-owned"" feel of the place. 

We were seated by the son. He even asked us if we preferred seating by the windows or not, which I thought was nice of him. For drinks I just went with water with lemon and bf ordered Pepsi. As we were looking through the menu, I noticed the selection was not HUGE like those chain restaurants; which I actually preferred. Quality over quantity any time :D I was actually having a difficult time making a decision when finally the father came to our table to inform us of the specials of the day. I heard ""bow tie pasta with chicken, asparagus, and wild mushrooms in white wine sauce,"" that hit the spot right there. BF ordered the gnocchi lol. They offer a bread basket of four slices and butter. We poured olive oil on the side plate and dipped our bread to soak up all that oily, buttery goodness ;D 

When our orders finally came, they were plated on square white plates with a garnish of some sprinkles of green and orange, no clue what they were but they gave that extra ""umph!"" in every bite. Man, whatever I ordered was the best pasta I've ever eaten here in Vegas. The first bite made me smile from ear to ear, and I'm pretty sure our waiter saw how happy I was with my food. Even the bf got giggly with how I was reacting to my food. His gnocchi was really tasty as well. I've had them before and the ones I've tried were heavy and cheesier, but these ones were light enough that you don't get too overwhelmed with the starch and cheese it's packing in small itty-bitty pieces. We usually put a small amount of our food in a separate plate and let each other taste the others order, and he finally understood why I was beaming with delight with my food. It looked like he just jizzed himself right there lol! He even asked for more from my plate XD 

After we were both done with our food, the waiter took our plates and asked if we wanted to order dessert or a cappuccino. At that point we were both stuffed and satisfied with what we just ate, we both just said ""we're good."" We stayed a little longer and talked after eating, Which gave us the chance to actually look around the place. There were pictures and paintings of what seems like places in Italy. It's small and cozy, but not cramped or stuffy, which is good. We also noticed that most patrons of this place are older married couples, which made me and the bf feel a little out of place lol.

We ate early because we had plans for the evening, there were 17 of us total, so a bit of a large party. The outside of the restaurant does not do the inside justice. It is definitely a hole in the wall with a very welcoming interior.

The waiter/owner was very friendly and prompt with the service. He was able to make suggestions and the food came out relatively quickly considering the party size. I was thoroughly pleased with the fresh pasta, amazing flavors and big portions. The pasta is made in-house and really makes all the difference.  

I went to Italy as a teen and felt like this restaurant did a great job to mirror the homey feel of eateries in Italy.

The only negative about this place is not being able to split checks. I completely understand as it is a small restaurant. But I felt like it was a hassle for the gentleman ringing up the bills and for us as well.",gJpvYNvxsyJxN-uiznbl6Q,1,0,4,flwusm_lg96wt1S9bjhleQ

It's definitely a ""cozy romantic"" sort of place, so it was a little bit awkward, but pretty hilarious. I had the gnocchi in white sauce and my ""date"" had some sort of long pasta in red sauce that wasn't quite spaghetti. My gnocchi was fluffy and well cooked, and the sauce wasn't over rich or over salted, and was just about the perfect thickness for the pasta; both the very different kinds of pasta.

Our bread was...bread? neither stale nor anything to write home about, but the butter was very fancy. We ate two baskets of it, either way. 

The staff was very attentive, and offered great suggestions, showed up when they were needed, but weren't hover-y at all. We showed up pretty early, so it was just us at first, but they filled up as our meal ended. I had to drive after we left, so I didn't get to drink, but I'd love to come here again on a real date, have a glass of wine, and try another dish. I'm pretty sure the pasta is homemade. I'll definitely be back on a real date to try other dishes, and will update review then!

- Great atmosphere for a date, quiet and cozy. Definitely as far from Olive Garden as humanly possible.

We arrived around 9:15pm (posted hours are until 10pm) and the place was empty.  The host/server was extremely gracious, (even opened the door for us), I know many restaurant staff that cringe at the thought of a table right before closing but we felt extremely welcome.  He also had a really thick accent (which I thought at one point might have been fake - but i think he was just a little nervous).  He was super sweet and attentive.  We shared a house salad (mixed greens, carrot, tomato, home-made Italian dressing) - simple yet the dressing was delicious.  I had a glass of the only Cabernet I saw on the menu - it was also fantastic.  There is a note inside the wine menu that states they serve wines that they've hand picked from mom & pop wineries - I like that!  My hubby had the 4 cheese gnocchi and I had the fettucini alfredo (we're vegetarian but they had MANY meat, chicken & seafood options as well).  The fettucini alfredo was done really well.  Often this can be a bland dish but it really was seasoned perfectly.  The star dish of the night was the 4 Cheese Gnocchi!  TO...DIE....FOR!  In fact next time we've decided we'll share that so we can save room and try their dessert!  At the end of our meal we were presented w/ a coupon for 20% off our meals if we come back in 2 weeks - SCORE!

Any pasta is incredible.  Pastas are always perfectly cooked and finished (the pasta is tossed with the sauce over heat not just poured over).  The veal bolognese is a standout (animal lovers please don't hate me).  A rich tomato sauce, velvety veal, hint of garlic, finished with a drizzle of EVOO and perfectly cooked pasta is so hard to pass up.

Tucked away on South Durango in a small shopping complex, just like many local gems that those merely visiting Sin City will never even know to exist, Gina's Bistro is one of those mom n' pop places I'd passed by a hundred times before finally deciding to stop in and touting ""authentic Italian recipes"" amidst a setting that vibes of an older couple's home the experience is one of well crafted food at a good price, while service ranks amongst the very best in Vegas...and bearing mind the city in which we live, not in a 'damned by faint praise' way.

Truly the sort of place where 'dining out' feels much more like 'eating dinner in the house of an old friend,' a visit to Gina's Bistro first sees the glint of a small kitchen tucked behind the hostess stand and quickly seated at a cozy four-top flanked in old photos and paintings it was mere moments before water was poured and perusing the menu while chewing crusty bread served alongside butter, olive oil, and balsamic a list of several specials was recited, a simply grilled fish atop orzo tempting though the housemade pasta inevitably got the nod.

Treated to soft Italian opera, the volume appropriate to shroud conversation without ever trending loud, it was not long before a duo of appetizers would arrive and although I personally would have not ordered the $19 Antipasto given the unexciting options, both the prosciutto and olives proved pleasant and sharable while a somewhat undersized duo of arancini proved far more interesting, though a bit more melted cheese and less ground meat would have certainly been preferred.

Moving on to entrees, an order of five proving a bit aggressive for just three diners when taking into account bowls of angelhair served with both plates of parm, it was with share-plates replenished and bread relinquished that a vast tasting began, the hand formed gnocchi a bit overcooked and sticky beneath rich cheese sauce while both ziti and priest-choker pasta were prepared perfectly al dente with no lack of flavor from housemade Italian sausage to be found.

Having already noted the duo of plates served 'alla Parmigiana,' it was perhaps an unfortunate choice to do both items on the same day alongside so much other food, for as good as the baked eggplant iteration was with a light breading overlying the baked vegetable and bold tomato sauce draped in cheese, the thinly pounded chicken was almost entirely flavorless beneath the same accoutrements, a slight oiliness reserving me to only a few bites, though by the end of the meal the plate - like all the others - was clean.

Limited in sweets, the options comprising small, conservative classics with $5 prices perhaps a bit much when compared to other similar spots in the city, it was a single cannoli with surprisingly delicate filling that joined an equally light tiramisu alongside coffee, and chatting with friends as a few more locals filtered in to half-fill the seating one really couldn't help but see the pride in both the maitre d' and waiter's faces as they circulated the room warmly welcoming each guest, water refilled for the umpteenth time without request as lit candles were placed at the center of each table.

Setting aside the fact that many of the classic plates are made using store bought dried pasta, and focusing mostly on what the mother and nephew team is doing in house, Gina's Bistro is the sort of restaurant unlikely to wow but happy to please, the service and setting ""Un-Vegasy"" in the best of ways while the food is often times quite good, particularly considering the price.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,14,4,3,Gh-cTghg7tjGbXfKWD9gkw

My husband is forever searching on Yelp for just the right place to eat. Boy do we love to eat and discovering a treasure so close to home is always great news. 

This is a small, intimate (seating for less than 50) place. Decor is smart and leaves a feeling of luxury yet prices seem very reasonable. We were greeted right away, shown to our table and were told about specials even before our drink order! 

Our first appetizer, one of the specials, thinly sliced prosciutto with a large spoonful of burrata cheese. Oh so good! I wanted more. 

The second app, we had the Arancini which is Arborio rice filled with bolognese sauce, peas and mozzarella, breadded, fried and served hot with marinara sauce. Also a very good dish, served with two large servings. The marinara sauce , sweet and balanced blend of garlic and oregano. 

For our entree's I had Strozzapreti alla Norcina, ' elongated hand rolled pasta, sausage ragu in a tomato cream & truffle oil, very fresh and the sausage ragu could have been just a bit more spicy for my tastes. My husband had Linguine alle Vongole, linguine in a white wine sauce with fresh clams and garlic. Plenty of clams really a generous proportion of linguine. 

Finally, we had to try dessert, our choice, spumoni ice cream cake, frozen blend of cherries, pistachio, nuts and chocolate. Great ending to a really tasty meal, very satisfying and filling without breaking the pocketbook.

Nothing was really very good except the potatoes. I must admit that the Pellegrino water was perfectly chilled and we drank 2 bottles. So here is the laundry list:

1) Odd smell when we walked in.
2) Bread, OK but butter in little Coffee Shop plastic tubs. ( I know but...)
3) Server was fast and attentive, however, his wine recommendation was not one I would have made if I wanted to increase my tip.
4) Wine, barely OK
5) Arancini, not hot, overcooked rice, and not much flavor
6) Zuppa di Cozze e Vongole, pretty good broth and clams, mussels had a bad texture and were obviously frozen.
7) Eggplant Parmigiana, Not good at all, hardly any eggplant or eggplant flavor. Tasted mostly of soggy toasted breadcrumbs.
8) Veal Saltimbocca, barely OK, veal was tough and I did not detect any fresh sage in the dish. Sauce and overall preparation was barely OK.
9) Roasted Potatoes, this was by far the best dish we had, pretty damn good but these are not on the menu and not always available.
10) Tiramisu, Tasty but a little strange, no espresso or rum flavor. Seemed to have used Limoncello instead to dip the Ladyfingers.
11) Mini Cannolis, inedible, so cute but flavored with banana extract and Amaretto.
Tasted like Bubble gum and not very good Bubble gum. Taken off the check.
12) Double Espresso, quite acceptable.

I had high hopes about Gina's Bistro, the Yelp reviews were mostly positive and a coworker from Italy recommended it highly. He has already been taken off my reliable list. Bottom line, I spent $142 for a seriously flawed meal for 2. Parma Deli would have been a much better choice, even Mezzo which has dropped so much in quality is preferable to Gina's. Way too many problems to have just been an off night. I will never return and can only recommend to stay away.",6fr-cVNPoa5lQmGvqkIhFw,5,3,1,S4ErritVJHS_YJcB_CUGmA

Cavatelli  and other home made pastas are great. Takes some getting used to eating mild flavors, but once you do it is addictive. 
Owner is very friendly and responsive",zPGUVq1Fwcx8f2836_VghA,0,0,5,Ob5jFVifojCfKokZUbevtA

You wouldn't think a place located in a mostly deserted plaza whose best outdoor view is of a gas station would be serving such great Italian fare, but they are and it's worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood.

As a lot of other Yelpers say, the atmosphere is nice and cozy.  Service was great and I think this was the only time in Vegas where we had a server that was actually from Italy.  But on a side note, how hilariously fucking awesome would it be if he were American and just doing a terrific Italian accent every night?  I would fall off my chair!!

I am a sucker for any place that hand makes their pasta and they make a lot of theirs in house with the exception of spaghetti and penne.  The parpadelle pasta was insanely good!!  I had it with a tomato sauce that included prosciutto, mushrooms and 2 HUGE meatballs.  Just to avoid going completely carb crazy, we went with a veal dish cooked in lemon butter sauce and that was delicious as well.

The only disappointment for us was the tiramisu which tasted a little weird so we didn't end up finishing it.  But who freakin cares when they're pushing out such terrific, well priced food?  Consider me a repeat customer!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,22,15,4,HvoDCLulqB7Uo395GZdx4A

I believe the chef is the mother of the family and the server is the son. We had the Osso Buco and a homemade pasta dish, and it was delicious. The homemade deserts that we tried, the Tiramasu and ""Chocolate Salami"" were equally delectable. As others have said, this is certainly a ""hidden gem,"" on a side street, and next to a Salvation Army.

I had the Spaghetti Aglio Dolce e Gamberi  which is a shrimp in sweet garlic white sauce and my 5 yo had the spaghetti and meatballs. Both dinners were delish! As of this posting there was not a kids menu so she got a full serving and it was a lot for her but we have yummy left overs now! Staff was so friendly and attentive. I will defiantly stop back and try some of the other dishes and hopefully a desert. Glad we tried this place tonight since it is hard sometimes to find good authentic Italian food in Vegas.,ZhoGqwq3wFvJZsLnzz2bLA,0,0,5,a5LKvxMajqnRBO-fl2Q1ag

We were the first people to arrive and order and the smallest group but our food was last to come out and we began to notice that all the waiters, waitress, and Gina herself was entertaining other customers and left us out.

5827672,2015-01-18,6,xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw,"A true Italian loving Las Vegas living the American Dream. Riccardo is the owner of this quaint little traditional Italian restaurant. From my experience in Europe, this is almost atypical of the family dining experience in an Italian restaurant. Family recipes, cooked by (or at least supervised by)  the owner represent the ballast and hallmark of this restaurant. Riccardo bought this restaurant (From Gina) in 2012 and brought his third-generation restaurant experience with him from his birth-home of Genoa, Italy on the coast in Northern Italy near the border of Switzerland and France.

This restaurant and the owner of this restaurant are a significant contribution to the Las Vegas culinary scene. This is a unique offering amongst copies of copies. The food is as authentic as the air you breathe, being recipes handed down from generations. 

There are few independent restaurateurs in Las Vegas who can offer such a wonderful dining experience. This is one of them at the very top of the quality scale. A superb wine list accompanies the superb dishes. A white tablecloth red wine pink sauce experience.

Expect to spend $80-100 per person, order appetizers and soup and salad plus the entree and get to-go for the leftovers.

Ask about the ""7 day discount"".

5837468,2014-07-12,3,xmWs-su5eB5_57CIw4sqfw,"This time a star was lost--by partly burned Bruschetta with fresh diced tomato.  Being told by our server that charring the Bruschetta somewhat was intentional in order to make the dish authentic was unconvincing and not at all believable--especially since I have not encountered blackened or partly burned Bruschetta anywhere else before or since.  

A cool Chopped Caesar Salad with tasty and crunchy homemade croutons, on the other hand, was very good.  And, a hot bowl of Minestrone Soup was a superior rendition of this Italian mainstay, with carrots, spinach, carrots, tomato, peas, celery, onions, and Cavitappi in a tomato-based broth.  Fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and great in texture and taste.  But, although Veal Piemonte featured well-pounded veal, it was warm rather than hot, and had a slightly stringy consistency to it..  Service was very good, but bread plates were inexplicably removed early from the table.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,3,4,tljLRxJtTKGFiIohQiC0bw

We started with a suggested special the peperonata, a stew of bell peppers and potatoes cooked for over six hours and into which we were advised to dunk the freshly made bread.  Super.  Another of us had the Caesar salad, which was great.

For the mains, the veal parmigiana was stellar, the ravioli were homemade, fresh, and amazing, and the Pappardelle 3 Bocconi which was also fantastic.  

If you're tired of huge portions of average industrial food and would prefer, fresh, authentic homemade food in perfect portions, then you should come here.

We arrived around 6 for an early dinner and were greeted warmly and seated. Our drink orders were taken and our waiter gave us a rundown of all the specials. He then gave us plenty of time to review the menu while he got our drinks and some bread for the table. We couldn't resist digging into the bread and it was fantastically crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Just like it's supposed to be. We indulged in quite a few pieces while we decided on what to order. I went with the gnocchi quattro formaggi. My fella got the mushroom chicken and my mom went with the eggplant parmigiana. Our Server was incredibly attentive and friendly, even while dealing with several other tables he was able to keep track of us and make sure everyone always had drinks filled to the brim and bread and butter on the table. 

Our meals came out quickly. All the pastas are made fresh and you can tell. Excellent textures and flavors. We all enjoyed our meals immensely and portions were quite generous. We all had leftovers packaged for later as well. Outstanding service, we were quite happy with our meal, I'll definitely be back to check them out again. They even gave us a 20% for our next visit, which is awesome. They'll accommodate just about any request and mentioned that if you are craving a particular type of pasta, just call them a day in advance and they will be sure to have it ready for your next visit.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,7,4,E4IARKcTUT4ROIfN9jVWUg
