I can never get enough Mr. Dither's and Archie's. OOOOoo and Blondie's I could go on and on. I could eat here everyday if I had the money. They have a great menu and a wonderful friendly staff. I dare you to say that any of their items are bad. I have never had a bad experience with service or food. We have catered a big family picnic with their sandwich trays. Everyone kept saying how delicious the sandwiches were, so we will have to do that again for sure! LOVE LOVE LOVE DAGWOODS um I mean  LOVE LOVE LOVE TJ'S!!!! PLEASE NEVER CLOSE BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE I CAN GET MY Mr. Dither's FIX!",QtnrzIf8lzS-lqF5tnoJqg,0,0,5,cstC7pPQ-RdVV1GZUaFtEw

Good bread, yummy meats and cheeses... tastes good without being soaked in oils and mayo like certain chain sandwich spots. We're locals and will be back for sure. Thanks!",PbLb6rYmWsVhIS7aARqtkg,0,0,5,cIxPWyUcnOpeeqwzgMw_ow
