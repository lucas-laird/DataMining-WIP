I actually had decent expectations. I was wrong. First, when I received my pizza, it was cold. To the point that the crust was slimey. In terms of the tomato sauce, chef - use some salt, would you? It was bland. Salt is a catalyst in ""conveying"" flavor. Charred crust can be delicious; however, they have managed to make it bitter to the point of no return. And the basil. Oh don't get me started. I love basil, but the basil on my pie was rotten.  To be honest, Little Ceasars is better tasting, and I don't like Little Ceasars very much. Don't brag about how amazing your pizza is when in all reality, it's nothing to write home about. I would rather pay to fly back to the east coast and get Pepe's or Lombardi's than to ever eat this ""pie"" again.",UEY8l4Jc8wv6W4jAW5Y-iA,0,0,1,OO3i-niiEhQGbkD-iVeD1g

One member asked to order a lunch item that was more expensive than the ""brunch"" menu which was only breakfast and was told no mimosa special if lunch was ordered.  Pizza Rock...brunch means breakfast AND lunch! Asked if there was any alternative to the country potatoes and was told no substitutions. Pizza crust was slightly burned and over crispy,  benedict was super dry even though asked for extra hollandaise. Everyone thought the food was ""fair"".

We also got the fried artichokes, which were delicious. You get two deep fried artichoke quarters - they looked like chicken drumsticks - and a tasty dipping sauce. The arugula salad with pancetta, mozzarella and tomatoes was good, but definitely large and a bit much. Because the pizza came out before our salad, they comped it (salad) off our bill. 

They had great beer selections on tap (I had a 20 oz. Dogfish Head 90 minute and hubby had the Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA)  and a great happy hour (we weren't there for that though).

106340,2014-03-18,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Very disappointed in quality & service!!
Walking by, we spotted Pizza Rock & decided to give it a shot. We debated getting a table or just buying a slice to try it. We finally decided to just get slices. We saw people buying cheese slices, and the pizza looked great. And one note, the young guy cooking the pizzas was awesome (no name tag unfortunately)... he was very friendly & charismatic & is the type of employee any restaurant would want dealing with customers... if he were the only employee we encountered, the ""service"" would have been great. Sadly he wasn't the only one we dealt with.  By the end, we felt bad for him... it apparently isn't his fault that he's forced to overcook the pizzas this way.

So we ordered 2 slices of pepperoni pizza. The first two he brought out just looked disgusting... they weren't just burnt, they were BLACK! We said no... he offered to get 2 new slices.  But then we saw what he put in the oven to warm up... they looked exactly the same, they were from the same exact large pizza as the first two slices.  He handed them to us, and we thought ""maybe it tastes better than it looks."" But first, we lifted it up... the bottom literally looked like asphalt, totally black on the bottom & the outer crust... burnt to a crisp... even the pepperoni was so tiny & curled & burnt.  We each took one bite off the tip, and all we could taste was burnt char and it literally crunched in my mouth like a cracker... not even good crispy pizza 'crunches' like that, it was hard & crunchy & only tasted like char!  No other flavor!  We said ""No, we can't eat that.  Why are all the pepperoni ones burnt? Why not take one out sooner, so they look like the cheese pizzas?""  The guy said ""I have to leave it in longer to cook the pepperoni.""  Really?  Why does NO other pizza place have to BURN it to cook the pepperoni? That just makes no sense, sorry!  We finally asked for a manager to get a refund, because he took another new pepperoni pizza from the oven, and it looked exactly the same, blackened & charred.
The manager, Joel (we were told later, he never bothered to introduce himself), finally came out (after waiting quite some time, guess they only have 1 on duty at a time)... and was extremely sarcastic & unfriendly the entire time. He stated that we were the ONLY complaints he'd had all day long. Okay, that's fine, we explained, but we ARE NOT eating that burnt pizza they offered us twice!  Also, I wish I had thought to tell him right then... numerous other people in line at the same time didn't seem to care, and we asked a big group of them ""Don't you care that it's so burnt?""  Their reply was ""We're so drunk & hungry, we could care less right now.""  Ahh, near all the bars, especially for a big event in town, lots of people so drunk they don't care WHAT they eat... so that's why nobody was complaining!!  We were also starving at this point... we'd already been waiting over 30 minutes for 2 slices... but we weren't hungry enough to eat black, charred, flavorless pizza.
After arguing about the burnt-ness of the pizza, Joel finally voided our transaction to refund our purchase... the then stated they were cooking us 2 more slices in a different oven inside the main kitchen... we never asked for that and at this point, we didn't want it... but he 'informed' us of that, and walked away... didn't give us a chance to tell him 'no thanks'... we'd been standing there about 40 minutes now, we were NOT waiting another 10-15 minutes for another burnt pizza... or worse. So we told the NICE young man cooking to please let him know we aren't interested, we'd rather leave & eat elsewhere.

So if you like burnt, charred, overcooked pepperoni pizza, this is the place for you.  Or if you like plain cheese pizza, that LOOKED pretty good!  Just not sure why they can't cook them the same... if the pepperoni slices looked ANYTHING like the cheese slices, nice golden brown crust & bottom... we'd probably be customers for life!  Sadly, they cook their pepperoni pizza to death, and have managers who are snide & sarcastic & downright unfriendly to their disappointed customers.  So we have no desire to return, and will never recommend this place to anyone.  Shame, because we're always looking for good pizza places.
We ended up finding pizza elsewhere... guess what, it was cooked properly, but not burnt... imagine that!",3ebfZkfUcJC6NaeCeNhgLg,1,0,1,aOLK1pwf8m3ikESVmS2n9g

Just a tip, they play they music videos with the songs, & they try to play the clean version of the songs. Keep that in mind if you have kids. Also, it took us like an hour to find parking. We found a parking lot which you can park at if you want to pay $20 bucks an hour. When we first got to Pizza Rocks, they said the wait was 45 minutes, but we got in within 10 minutes.

125014,2014-02-12,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I'm giving this a 2 star rating because of the service alone. There was a group of 12 with 4 kids. The staff was nice but we ordered 4 pizzas so we could try the different types and then 4 kid pizzas. The pizza took 40 mins for the first one to come out. Then they came only one at a time. It was over an hour before all 4 pizzas were delivered. And then the kids pizzas still didn't come. It took us 4 requests to them and then one came out a Mac & Cheese instead of a Cheese pizza and took another 10 mins. Asking for a refill took forever. We actually finally just went up to the bar to get the kids refills. They did end up taking the kids meals off the bill but still charged us the mandatory 18% gratuity. Which wasn't deserved.

Now on the other side the pizza was good when we finally got it. A bit pricey I think. $70 for one pizza, one salad, one Coke, and two Bloody Marys. We asked if we could buy it by the slice and they said only if you ordered it at the walk-up window outside ( huh???, whatever). And the place was nice inside. I would never go there again with a group or even kids at this point. So if it wasn't for the service which others have mentioned on here too.

The menu was overwhelming so after a good fifteen minutes I decided to go up front and get a slice. It was delicious!!  It was so good that I returned the next night with my wife and ordered a different pizza. I will give Pizza Rock 4 stars, easily. Eric, the man behind the bar was professional and helpful.

It seemed more pricey than I remembered, but I think that was just based on our choice. I do not recommend the large pizza they say serves 6. It's 6 slices for $40 of a basic pizza. Stick to the slices in this case. You can split most of the pizzas there with one other person, especially if you split an app too. We'll definitely do this again next time we go in.

Oh, the wait was about an hour. We explored the Fremont Street Experience during that time and we were greeted with a phone call from Pizza Rock when our table was ready. They waited ten minutes for us to walk over and were happy to hold the table. Great service! Also, Lone Star is on their beer menu.

236378,2014-01-29,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"You know I can't tell you how long I was looking forward to finally eating here. It was a real highlight of my move to Vegas. I had talked with the Pizza Rock Twitter for months leading up to me coming out here and was told I""would be taken care of"" when I first ordered here. I had no idea what that meant but I thought it was really cool they were taking care of their loyal fans or something. 

So I didn't feel like going and getting food and having to take it back on the bus or walking. Luckily I found a bike service that would actually deliver to my apartment. How cool was that? So I went and finally got a hold of Pizza Rock and talked to the guys and just said ""oh by the way the twitter said I would get taken care of my first visit, whatever that meant"". Then it was like I was trying this huge scam, Tommy the manager was trying to help, but he tells me to go back to Twitter and talk to them. Then Twitter backtracks and says they never said anything and starts ignoring me. At that point I'm beyond done.  I decide forget about it. 

I call back to try to explain to the restaurant maybe how to fix this and get put on with GM Ricky who immediately takes an antagonistic, smug, and condescending attitude with me. Saying how he is going to say ""take care of"" means we'll take care of you and I'm basically stupid for thinking anything more and basically just being an all around dick. Pretty much saying I was trying to scam them or play entitlement for some free food. No worries, I told him to go F himself. It's a shame but if that's the kind of people Pizza Rock wants to hire, they get what they deserve. 

As I type this, I am eating 40 dollars worth of Happy's Pizza. May not be top quality, but gave me 100% less headaches. Should have been Pizza Rock's money but can't support a place that has people treating loyal fans and first time customers the way GM Ricky was.

Appetizers: 
Fried artichoke - SO GOOD! I was shocked at how much I liked this dish because it seemed a little weird but it was delicious. 
White wine clams - first time I've ever tried clams before and they were really yummy. I'm not really a seafood person, but the sauce made it not too ocean-y. 
Green Beans: Garlic, flash fried, crunchy but not too crunchy. Really good, I could eat those all day. 
Meatballs: Oh my gosh. I'm not a fan of red sauce but I can't go to Pizza Rock without getting a side of meatballs!
Gorgonzola apple salad: my favorite salad! I don't always eat all the apples because I don't typically like fruit in my salads, but the walnuts and gorgonzola with arugula and the dressing they use is ridiculous. If you get this as a main course, I would suggest asking for chicken breast in it to make it a little more dense, but it could definitely be used as a appetizer to share or as a main course for one. 

Pizzas: 
Honey Pie: perfect combination of sweet and spicy. I've had this one a few times and sometimes it's a little too much spice for my liking, but the sweetness mellows it out a little. 
Cal-Italia: MY FAVORITE PIZZA EVER! I could go on and on about how delicious and amazing this pizza is. In my opinion, this is the best pizza in all of Las Vegas. The balsamic reduction is SO GOOD. It's salty, sweet, cheesy perfection. 
New Yorker: not my kind of pizza - too much meat for me. But the guys I was with when we got this one loved it. 

Today I came for brunch with my mom. It was outstanding! The french toast ambrosia was out of this world. I was completely stuffed and still managed to eat all of it because it was so good! My mom got the meatball hash with scrambled egg white- it wasn't quite what we were expecting presentation wise but the flavor was excellent. Overall an extremely enjoyable meal. Our server, Ryan (blonde hair), was fantastic! He was very friendly and knew the menu really well. He was able to answer all of my questions and was quick at bringing us what we asked for.

We enjoy going downtown every so often, and usually park at the adjacent lot by Mainstreet Station. Sometimes, it's free, and sometimes it's not. Either way, it's easy and we'll just walk around from there. The two drawbacks from this experience is the take out window needs some adjustments. The timing and execution of placing an order, paying, and then receiving it was confusing, backed up, and a bit disorganized. Perhaps, once they get into the groove then this will sort itself out.

Very few restaraunts, however, combine all of these endearing - and essential - elements of a glorious Restaraunt-going experience, and Pizza Rock serves as a perfect example of how to provide a wonderful dining experience for anyone fortunate enough to pass through its' glass doors.

When you first walk into the Restaraunt, lovely attendants will gleefully offer you a seat and/or table. Whoever planned the interior decoration of this place excelled tremendously, as each nook, each cranny, each aspect of the interior exudes charm and jovial hospitality, combining modern hot-rod overtones of black and red with hints of Victorian furniture, replete withnew-York pizzareia tomato soup cans on every table. Hell, even the bathrooms have beautiful decorations -  I can only speak for the men's restroom, though  - and the traditional stickfigure gender identifiers  comically squirm and cover their nether regions in a desperate attempt to reach the restroom.

In particular with the compassionate staff, we received a waiter named Billy, and he's among the nicest waiters I have ever met. He always answered any questions we had, and knew how the pizzas we wanted were constructed, and his friendliness did not come off as forces or artificial: he genuinely loved, and continues to love, his job. 

As for the food:

Oh.

My.

No idea what nitro is but liking the sound of it, I ordered. Delicious, nice foamy head with a crisp flavor. The pizza Napoletana I ordered was equally terrific with an ultra thin, slightly charred crust. Could this dining experience be improved upon? Absolutely and this is why:  

When I was ready to pay I discovered my wallet was not in my purse. Panic struck, I explained the problem to Billy.  He immediately set my mind at ease by speaking with his manager. She was very gracious, took care of my bill with no questions asked and offered to help me locate the missing wallet. As it turns out, a cabbie had called the restaurant to report a lost item. He didn't leave his name or cab details however. The manager, whose name I didn't learn, set out to call all of the cab companies who may have driven me to Pizza Rock. Long story short, the cab company was discovered, the driver identified, the wallet returned to me at the restaurant. In the interim - Billy offered to spot me money to get by in case the wallet wasn't found. The manager also offered to give me money to get back to my hotel. Once I had my wallet back, I tried to pay my bill.  Get this, they wouldn't let me.

Will I recommend Pizza Rock to friends and family? Without a doubt.

507350,2013-12-10,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I won't lie - I was skeptical.  How can one place make so many different styles of pizza and make them all well?  

Well, this place has come pretty darn close to achieving that goal.  We had the margherita, cal italia (proscuitto, fig, balsamic), and la regina (sicilian with picante, mozz, arugula).  Notice all the ones we ordered had won some kind of award.  I'm used to margherita not having sauce, this one had sauce on it - but it was delish!  The sauce was slightly acidic and not sweet, which I really enjoyed.  The crust was perfect, just wish the mozz was more spectacular.  The cal italia had a nice blend of savory and sweet flavors as well as amazing crust.  The la regina was my least favorite, the toppings were a little sparse and I've had better crust. 

Cool interior, awesome service.  I must be getting elderly as I was complaining to my tablemates about how loud the music was....  but even though I was screaming they couldn't hear me.  Not the place for a first date.  Get ready to use sign language and stare at the person across/next to you eat while you listen to 80s British and American rock.  Music videos included.  

Tip: Parking is a pain.  Just valet it right outside the restaurant at the hotel across the way.  You will probably end up paying the same amount anyway but won't have to walk a block.",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,1,0,4,wYpWBrHv_vu1YXPN_G19Aw
509457,2015-02-14,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Having heard of pizza rock from my brother, and how it had apparently been growing exponentially in the vegas scene, I had to see what this place was all about. Having tried dozens of different pizza places, whether they be mom and pop shops, or simple commercial, Pizza Rock undoubtedly takes the crown as king. I've tried their cal italia, new yorker, and margherita pizza on differing occasions, and all I have to say, is it's worth the drive to downtown. 

The cal italia was such a fulfilling pizza; with the balasmic reduction and fig creating a balanced concoction of deliciousness. 

The margherita pizza was exactly what you would hope to get from one. Tender crust, great sauce, and fresh cheese. It was light and satisfying.

As for the new yorker, it would be worth paying even $35 for it. Coming from an avid meat lovers pizza enthusiast, this pie is all you need in your life. Its almost a sin to grab more than one slice. The meat is succulent with a light kick, the cheese creamy and chewy, and crust perfectly foldable. Highly recommend trying!",vI0wXHLsJnt1mu5iyCZSUg,1,0,5,-fJkZSbDhKvNhmMGYFggqw

518925,2016-08-08,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"After working in the restaurant industry for five years I tend to judge my servers when I go out to eat, always tipping more then 20%. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. We had a party of eighteen. I arrived before everyone and was immediately shown to the table, a nice cozy room off of the main dining room. The temperature was a little chilly. The rest of the party arrived and a couple minutes later our server came by he took half of the drink orders then proceeded to walk away.  My table ordered a couple pizzas at this time and he did not think about asking the second table of they would like to place an order as well. 

The drinks were dropped off and he immediately walked away and did not take the rest of the orders. After asking for the server on three separate occasions he finally made his way back fifteen minutes later. By this time my tables food had arrived and we began to eat. The server proceeded to give attitude and smart comments to one of the guests at the second table when a comment was made about his negligence to their table. 

The second table did not receive their food until our table was finished eating. The server did not check back and ask how the food was or ask if anyone would like a refills. The pizza was good minus the fact it came out a little on the cold side. 

Overall I can say at the numerous restaurants I have worked at (one being a fine dining restaurant Cucina by Wolfgang Puck) this type of service and attitude would have never happened nor been accepted by management from me or my fellow servers. I am very disappointed on how the dining experience went and would not recommend coming with a large party because the server we had can obviously not handle larger parties.  We spoke to the manager mid way through the meal. We received the check and nothing was done with it. I am not one to go out and assume a discount for shitty service but when there is an issue some sort of discount should be given. After receiving the bill we spoke to the manager again and did receive a 15% discount. 

Everyone in the party was very disappointed with the wait staff and the food being cold. Pizza Rock will not have our business next time we are in Vegas.",xjc4Nz1JebGnImUqzqJihg,0,0,2,srMI0G_PTrhdO9_GCjH6_A

The general manager Tony stopped by our table to make sure  everything was fine.   He told us about the kitchen with different  Brick Ovens and the different types of flour used for the crust.

There was a VJ on the night we were there playing (from the inside of a semi tractor which is in the restaurant) a mix of old school rock and new school parodies - very fun! When the pizza came it was beautiful. Served up on a cutting board you could smell the rich aromas of sausage, caramelized  sweet onion and tomatoey goodness. The crust was light and crispy outside with a soft sweet still light center. I was told that the Guinness reduction in the crust and topping is what makes it so delicious. It adds a sweetness but very subtly and perfectly offset by the sausage and herbs with big gobs of melted mozzarella - YUM.

Garlic bread - not enough garlic!

Gorgonzola fries - nice flavor but very soggy!  

Cal Italia pizza - Their award-winning pie, was so-so.  Too much sweetness, between the balsamic vinegar and fig preserves, with not enough savoriness to balance it out.  The Gorgonzola cheese was an unexpected but welcome addition to the pizza as it provided some much needed depth of flavor.  However, there was not enough of it on there.  The prosciutto was too wet - drier would have been better in my opinion.  The asiago did not add any sharpness unfortunately.  Maybe put more on?  Another big pet peeve was the ratio of toppings/cheese to crust - way too much crust!  Also, the crust was incredibly bland, but maybe this was just my preference as a New Yorker.

Service - the waiter was not the most attentive.  I think it was because his shift was ending, but he completely forgot about my table and we went without water for most of the meal.",sBqC2bGRwwz8C56yyORrLQ,0,0,3,oDU151ZU-Xx3eAtgrjUH3Q

Did some quick research and we decided to give it a try. We ordered 2 locally made root beer, a 16 in. New Yorker pizza and some fried green beans.

We ordered this because of its good reviews, however we felt a little disappointed. Maybe it's good to those that never had the green beans cooked this way before, but to us it just tasted like stir fried green beans in lots of olive oil and chopped garlic, no other flavors. We then hope the pizza could save the day and it did. The pizzas in this restaurant are cooked inside the 500 degree hot brick pizza oven. Tomato sauce is made out of fresh whole tomatoes, it burst in the mouth once you bite into it.

Unfortunately, many people who write reviews don't know food and are not that into food.  Their frame of reference is either limited or they really prefer the food the grew up with and think that's ""the bomb"" and nothing else is as good.
Tony Gemignani is an 11 time world champion in pizza.  The first year he competed in Italy he swept the competition in all three categories, meaning he walked away with 3 gold medals, beating completion from Italy and all over the world.  So, obviously, the man knows pizza!!!!
I had wanted to eat at one of his places for a few years, knowing his reputation, but they were all in central California, an area I never visit.  I was thrilled to learn that he was opening here in Vegas and ate there the end of October 2013.
Everyone has an idea of what a crust should be like.  It's usually what they grew up eating, and anything else is lousy.  Tony has 3 ovens, a gas, an electric and a wood fired oven, all different temperatures.  The type of pie/crust you order determines which oven it will be cooked in.
For me, a pizza nut, hands down the best crust I've ever had.  Nice crunch, air pockets, good chew and yet still light and airy.
The quality is there on the toppings, cheese and sauce.  I did not eat anything else but the pizza so cannot comment on anything else on the menu.  I wish I could eat there twice a week.

their cocktails are absolutely phenomenal they do have one signature cocktail called a mother trucker which I would not recommend it is not my style it was very citrusy but too strong and it didn't taste good at all but other than that one drink they made very strong and traditional Long Island iced teas we had a lemon drops we had tequila sunrises we had adios mofo 

the decor is pretty hardcore they have a 900 degrees Stonefire often they also have a semi truck in the middle of the restaurant black and it has flames painted on it the staff was very friendly and full of bubbles are always smiling and helpful they come and check on you as often as possible

#1 Michigan Ave (ask for it to be lightly cooked. Trust me)

#2 Old Chicago

#3 Americano

Also the meatballs and the Gorgonzola fries are UNBELIEVABLE! Meatballs at a pizza place?? What?? Seriously though, these are better than any Italian place in LV and I have been to them all! 

The trick is to head down during Happy Hour 3PM-6PM M-F (or after 10PM). Fries are $4 and Meatballs are $6. Also they have personal pizza's for $7 during that time.

862686,2015-11-23,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"The pizza is good, but don't come here on Sunday to watch NFL football. We did and barely lived to tell about it... 

Visiting Vegas, so a friend searched around for a good place to watch all the NFL games. Pizza Rock told him they'd reserve a table for our group of six at 10am Sunday and the sign on the door trumpets ""Your Football Headquarters"". 

The first clue that this wasn't going to go well was when we showed up at 9:45 Sunday morning. The door was locked and the woman inside was signaling ""No"" to us with her hands, indicating that they didn't open till 10am.  Since the games start right at 10am sharp, if you're going to be a sports bar and claim you show all the Sunday games, you should open no later than 9:30. We asked the woman if all the games were going to be shown and she curtly replied, ""Whenever the manager gets to turning them all on.""

Sure enough, 10am came and several TVs were on the same game and they were missing half of the games that morning.  The two closest TVs  to us were both showing the same game and we asked for the game we most wanted to watch to be shown on one of those TVs. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes. We ask again about switching to the game we wanted and we were told that ""Bo, the manager"" had the remote and he was the only one who could change the channel. When it got to 30 minutes and we were still without that game, we started asking for Bo, but he refused to come out. When it got to be 45 minutes and we'd missed the entire first quarter of the game we wanted to see, we started to get really upset and basically said that we were going to go somewhere else to watch the games if we didn't get the TV switched to the game we came to see.

Our server said they were finally going to change the channel, but that Bo (the manager) had said that was the only one he was going to change. Bo of course refused to ever come out and talk to us, even though we asked to talk to him 3 times. He apparently hid in the back the entire time. 

At some point, we asked if we could have sound to one of the games turned on instead of the crappy music they were playing. The waitress said a flat out ""No"" telling us that if they turned the sound for our game, somebody else would want sound on their game. At this point, 30 minutes into our stay at Pizza Rock, we were the only people in the place. So basically, we were told that they couldn't accommodate us because some customers who weren't there yet and who might never even show up, might want something else. 

In short, this place is poorly run and they don't care about their customers. Looking forward to reading about them closing down in the near future, as you just can't treat customers this poorly and expect to stay in business.

I had a teenager with me and he wouldn't even eat it.  The waitress sent the manager over and he offered to fix another, but by that time everyone was pretty much just ready to leave.

It was hard to get a drink refill and we had to ask for a salt shaker for our appetizers because, as we were informed,  they don't put salt shakers on the tables. 

Dismal dining experience.

Went to this place with a group after work and was totally unimpressed. I can't say much about the food as I only had a personal pepperoni pizza (which was totally MEH), but I can definitely say the service, for the most part, SUCKED. 

The hostess was eager and friendly, however, our waiter was kind of a douche (which kinda fits the atmosphere, I guess). Perhaps he's never worked in service before, because his demeanor was totally whack. When we asked him if he had certain toppings, he was confident in telling us that the owner would NEVER carry that and that he would have to agree with the owners decision. Like, really? Thanks for the opinion we didn't ask you for, man. Perhaps we annoyed him because we took so long to order, because once we finally did, he was nowhere to be found! We waited FOREVER for our food (which was served by other people? maybe it just works that way there?), then waited another forever for our check. In fact, I think we sat there for a good 45 minutes before one of us finally got realllllly bored and actually requested the bill from a totally different waiter. The totally different waiter was nice, by the way. 

To be fair, this place does have an extensive beer menu. Perhaps it'd be good for some happy hour drinks at the bar, but I will definitely not go here for food.",U9fqlJDHaOC37pL21sXB9g,2,0,2,u2DQjJScyJSboszvml_V4w

It wasn't that the food as bad, although my meatball sub came out lukewarm, it wasn't the bad service even though I got the sense the waitress wasn't thrilled to have to wait on a table that had three younger children, it was the process in which the food was delivered and the awkwardness of watching everyone else at other tables who came in after us got served first.

All we ordered was one meatball sub, one order of mac and cheese, one p, b and j pizza from the kids meal (which was oddly a cheese pizza with peanut butter and jelly) and one cheese roll.  

The food took forever to come, and it came one thing at a time, really slowly.  First the mac and cheese for one of my sons, then the pizza, then the cheese roll, and then 5 minutes later my meatball sub.  The fact that it was lukewarm probably says that it was actually sitting there waiting for someone to get it.  

This sounds like a discombobulated communication error on the side of the kitchen staff and the runners/waitstaff.

I did get 20% off for checking in, but overall I was left less than impressed.  Perhaps I will give it another chance, or perhaps I will just stick with my standbys and let the Zappos folk flock to it and be catered to since it's hip for them.",CzCaoUWu_y_z6rUvJwTsIw,2,0,3,Xn1MUMLRvj5nJ6mFCzVcoA

940592,2013-11-18,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"This is a bit of a mixed review. On the good side, this place is fairly new, and the ambiance is fantastic. The menu is quite well put together, and the pizza is a great NYC-style pie. They also offer Chicago-style, but that, honestly, did not look very authentic. When we got our pizza to go, it was great tasting and reminded me of my time spent in Manhattan. I would return to this place based on that alone. The small pepperonis that have the reddish-yellow grease running are awesome. If you're from the east, it's known as Margarita pepperoni...at least where I'm from. Toppings were ample and the crust was tasty too!

Now for the down side. We returned to this place for a take-out pizza after walking around the area to see all the new businesses and a new casino. We ordered from the convenient walk-up window directly on 3rd St. Fantastic for passer-byes to grab a quick slice. So I ordered and paid. They said it would be 7 minutes. OK. Twenty minutes later, we went inside. They ""forgot"" to make our pizza. They offered me a ""free"" pepperoni pizza that was ready. How would this be free? I had already paid more for additional toppings. I said no, thank you. I'd like a fresh one. They offered a slice of pizza and a drink while I waited. I accepted that. All-in-all, we waited 45 minuted for a regular pizza order. I was on the verge of asking for my money back and leaving just as the pizza came out. 

We did have a drink at the bar. Quite a fun bar, and the service was great here. Personable bartenders and reasonable prices. Worth stopping in if you're looking for a refresher!

Overall, the pizza quality and taste was excellent. Unfortunately, due to the incident I encountered, I feel I can only give a 3-star rating. If you go, you're sure to enjoy great pizza...just don't be in a rush. That won't happen.",frxkO_E7DPz8GwrFtlaEdA,0,0,3,fqLm0RYXP0vfIPO3b0q56Q

Needless to say, the reservations didn't fill the tables, then we were seated and our waiter wasn't the greatest, often times passing our table without acknowledging that I was trying to get his attention because my children had empty drinks.

He was entirely all over the issue, asking for details and assured me that all issues would be addressed which is all that I had hoped for. 
 
My second visit was quite the opposite of my last experience and I was anticipating some kind of issues.  First off,  it was New Years Eve and second we had a reservation for a party of 12.  We started out with 10 people and added 2 more the day before with no problem.  When we arrived a few of us went to the bar to order a drink anticipating  to wait a little bit before being seated.  The bartender (I didn't get his name) was more than helpful and a very cool guy with Corona shaped New Years glasses. ;)   Amazingly we were seated within 5 minutes as the other people around us were looking at over an hour wait-because they didn't have reservations.  I highly recommend the reservations-especially on a major holiday.  Immediately we were greeted by our server Anisa with a smile and excitement that we were there and she was ready to help us in any way possible.  I must say I was greatly surprised at the service we received with all the factors I mentioned above.  Anisa was both personable and attentive that we hardly realized that she was serving other several tables.  A simple thing that makes you a super server-unfortunately not everyone can have that talent.   Drinks were flowing and we all ordered with 3 or 4 split checks without any issues.  For 5 of us we ordered the New Yorker and the Cal Italia pizzas.  The New Yorker is the most amazing pizza I have ever had...that is what we ordered the last time so you know it has to be good.  It is topped with sausage and little pepperonis....but my favorite part was the super creamy ricotta strategically placed on top where you could spread it around with your fork to savor a little on every bite.  Yum.  The Cal Italia had prosciutto and a balsalmic drizzle  that had a flavor like none other.  Seriously between the two pizzas we were 100% satisfied and all was gone except for one slice in the end.  Not too bad for 5 people.  Others ordered spaghetti and meatballs (it was gigantic), lasagna (which my man said he may have to order next time-it looked fabulous), the Romana  II (which gives you a little variety and its big enough to share).  Everyone was very happy with their food and we left full and tipsy. =)

Now we did have a small incident where one of my guests spilled a whole glass of ice water all over me.  It could have been worse right??   Anisa, even though it wasn't their fault, comp'ed us a pizza just for the inconvenience which was definitely not expected by any means.  We definitely were pleased with  our server so much that we will ask for her the next time we visit.

All I can say is FINALLY some good quality food downtown.  We've been waiting a long time for some good eats out there.  You can bet that's where we will be eating while we are down there.  Thank you Trevor, for listening to my concerns and working out the kinks.  I believe an honorable owner is one that listens to the customer and strives to correct the issues no matter how big or small they may be.  And thanks to Anisa for making our New Years Eve dinner a special one to remember.  Happy New Year Pizza Rock - my New Years resolution is to see you often in 2014.  Cheers!",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,9,11,5,d08KOPIdDdorYMd9hd0F6A

992412,2013-12-05,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"This post is overdue, but then again, when am I not behind? A couple weeks ago, we went downtown to try Pizza Rock. It's owned by Tony Gemignani you might know him from Bar Rescue. We also know of him because of his restaurant is San Francisco, Tonys Pizza Napoletana. Upon returning from our recent trip, I checked to see how the menus compare... they're practically identical. That meant those delicious meatballs could be had right here at home. We only hoped they were just as good. 

My brother joined us and we got there in time for happy hour (Mon-Fri 3-6; Sun-Thur 10-close). Beers, appetizers and pizzas are discounted (local's discount does not apply). They have a great craft beer selection ($5) so they hooked me on that alone. We each ordered meatballs ($3). The meatball itself was just as good as those in San Francisco, but the sauce was too acidic. Hopefully, the kitchen is still tweaking the recipe. Still, we enjoyed them. We shared an order of garlic bread ($5). Very garlicky, but otherwise unmemorable. 

We each ordered a personal pizza from the happy hour menu. This was a great savings and a way to try pizzas we typically wouldn't order. Frank's True Italian ($7) had pesto garlic and it was topped with mozzarella and cherry tomatoes. This was our favorite of the three. 
 
The pepperoni had some kick ($5) but it was the least liked crust and Cal Italia ($7) was too sweet for my liking; it seemed like dessert. However, it came highly recommended from our server and it has won awards. It has sweet fig preserve and topped with mozzarella, gorgonzola, and prosciutto. 

Pizzas I've had at Tony's have been far more impressive so next time I'll stick to the regular menu for pizza, but I'll definitely enjoy those $3 meatballs and $5 craft beers again.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,5,2,3,_0_V0n0PGyroBbCHe3Hhow

On the first visit we ordered pepperoni pizza and Parmesan rosemary fries and Paardebloem beer (a pale beer with fruit undertones). Everything was tasty and I enjoyed my meal.
On my next visit I went during late night happy hour. This time we ordered a Cal Italia   
pizza, appetizer meatballs, flash fried green beans, and Parmesan rosemary fries.  I liked the pizza, which was a no tomato sauce variety with prosciutto, cheese and a balsamic vinegar drizzled over it.  Once again the fries were spot on and fantastic. The meatballs were tasty and the sauce was fresh tasting. I could see these on a great meatball sub with some mozzarella.  The green beans were crisp and had some garlic added for flavor. Green beans are not my most favored veggie, but I tasted them and they were not bad. I still loved the parm-rosemary fries the most of all. They were YUMMY!!!!!!

On my third visit, I had the Burratta Burger and more fries----yummy!!
The burger was good and the bread was good too, it's large and I could not quite finish it all--- I tried though. :)

We asked and they informed us it was a 20 minute wait. We didn't wait much longer than 15 minutes and we were seated right away. 

I would give pizza rock a 4 on food and a 4 on service. For the first 15 minutes of us sitting we weren't sure who our server was but once we were greeted and got our order in, it was worth the 30-40 minute wait to get our food (it was really busy since it was Friday). Me and my bf ordered the Gorgonzola Fries (which were amaaaazing) and the fried artichoke (which was ok) and a Gorgonzola and Apple salad for starters (pretty good).  We then got the Cal Italian Pizza which was really good but we had so many appetizers we saved it for a late night snack. 

They also had a DJ booth that was inside a truck in the dining area so that was pretty cool. The music was loud and all rock. In my opinion, it's a great place to hang out and drink! Also, if you don't like dining in there's a to-go pizza area so you won't need to sit in and have your food served. Patios outside as well if you're looking for some scenery outside.

So, after two visits with several friends, here are my updated thoughts.

Classic Meatballs - moist, tender, and flavorful. A nice start to a meal if you are unsure how many pizzas to order (e.g. should we order 2 or 3 pizzas for the group). Using this example, I would order a large order of meatballs and 2 pizzas.

Beer Battered Artichokes - This depends on if you like artichokes (duh). Batter is light and the artichoke hearts are tender. I am a fan.

Pizza - What to order, what to order.  My favorite is the Cal Italia. Now, if you are looking for a traditional pizza, do not order this.  However, if you have an open mind and are looking for something a bit different, this is a good choice. If you are a traditionalist, go with the New Yorker. The crust has difficulty holding the ingredients, so might have to use a fork to cut & eat (I know, I know, Dante has some lower level of Hell for those who eat pizza with anything other than their hands). But well worth breaking generations of pizza-eating tradition to enjoy each bite. In particular the fennel sausage has just the right flavor to make the pizza interesting.

So, if visiting Vegas, take an hour or so, get off the Strip and enjoy a local favorite.  If a local, you should consider making Pizza Rock a regular part of your restaurant rotation.

My tip is if you're eating in a smaller group then try to eat at the pizza bar upfront where they sell pizza by the slice.  You can order a slice of everything instead of just getting one big pizza when you sit inside the restaurant.

I had heard so many good things about this place (speaking about the Downtown location)  and am so happy with the new Green Valley Ranch location. The only reason for the 3 star review was the service...but I'll get to that in a bit. 

We went on a Friday afternoon because of an early bedtime for our daughter and had no problem getting a table. we tried 2 different beers and even enjoyed the Fried Green Tomato app. I would literally go there just got that app. 

The New Yorker (pizza) was amazing and our daughter enjoyed her kids meal. We also couldn't resist the Mud Pie. 

The service was the issue, our server was close to his time off and your could tell he was rushing us with our order and even our meal. He wasn't very nice, made up excuses when he forgot our drink refills (and our appetizer) and even counted his tips in front of us. Piece of advice for you... counting your tips in front of your table will more than likely lower the tip that you are about to get from said table.

We sent it back (before I got a picture) and waited for a new one. After 20-25 minutes we were still waiting for our pizza.... getting a little mad it was taking so long. Obviously we weren't a priority. We finally decided to cancel the order. While canceling we were told our pizza went to another table & they were complaining  about it too. WTF! The bartender took the pizza off the bill & gave us a free drink so no problems with his service but really doesn't help with the poor quality & inability to correct it. We left & ate elsewhere.

I went with some co-workers to celebrate a birthday. I had heard horror stories about the wait times, but there were plenty of empty tables at lunch. And none of us are fans of the downtown parking situation, but you can park at the nearby Downtown Grand and get your ticket validated by the Pizza Rock hostess. So my first tip is to go for lunch (or, maybe, for happy hour) to save yourself some time and money!

Two of the ladies ordered the fried green tomato caprese. I tried a bite and wasn't too impressed, although it was a lot better after I added a touch of balsamic reduction. Another pair of ladies split a pizza. I didn't get the name, but it was topped with a ton of meat and looked pretty good (and they seemed to enjoy it). I went to the front of the house and ordered the slice of the day, which was bacon and serrano peppers. The last of my co-workers followed suit and ordered a slice of the vegetarian. $6 a slice, but these were monster slices--and delicious to boot! (Tip #2.)

Too bad we had to return to work (except for the birthday girl, who stuck around for a drink), because their beer selection was calling out my name. I think I'll return for happy hour soon, or maybe for their Sunday brunch, which is a favorite of the aforementioned birthday girl. Bottomless mimosas! Hello!

It's a great place that encourages sharing your food. Order 3 or 4 different pizzas and everyone gets to try a different type of pizza. I had the clam and garlic pizza. Just amazing. They've also got one with arugula that was equally amazing. This place is awesome, you owe it to yourself to come here. Oh yeah, there's beer too.

Which is good if you come with a large group, because then you can try more than just one pizza. It was just my husband and I, and we weren't going to be able to take any leftovers, so we had to find a smaller pizza to order, that was also on the cheaper end (some of the pizzas can get pretty $$$). We ordered a Neapolitan style margharita pizza, and it was fantastic. The reason for my 3 stars is the service and the appetizer. We sat at our table for at least several minutes before a server came to take our drink order (the restaurant was about 80% empty at this time). Then we had to wait a while for the drinks (which was just a water and a beer...). More often than not, the server was never around when we needed her. As our appetizer we ordered the woodfired asparagus, which came with prosciutto. We imagined asparagus stalks individually wrapped in prosciutto. Instead, it was one large pile of asparagus wrapped together, which made it difficult to cut. It was good anyway, but not great.

if you like spicy food the Picante is fab. You can always change it up a bit by replacing the hot sauce with the pizza sauce and have the jalape√±os on the side.

My girlfriend, best friend, and I came to Pizza Rock for the first time and were blown away by the service Ashley and the rest of the staff gave us.  We went a few nights ago and received the same amazing service. If you ever go here ask for her... guaranteed to get top notch service and you'll get an honest opinion on the food.

It is hard to come by a place that has a consistently good vibe like that. We all work in the hospitality and service industry and we just want honest service where the staff doesn't try to sell you the most expensive item on the menu.  If that is what you like when you go to get food and drink then go here.

The pizza is  phenomenal and the beer and spirits selection is actually pretty top notch as well. Being a local in Vegas means it is hard to find a place downtown or on the strip that has a good beer selection when you have microbreweries in the suburbs.  Beware though... If you don't want to feel the nostalgia of 90's and early 2k rock music then I would go to the bar first and still get a drink from Ashley at the very least.  

Overall the people that work there seem to always be enjoying their environment and they enjoy each other so that translates via the food and service in great ways.

1282977,2015-01-05,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"So I read an article about Pizza Rock, in one of the magazines that is in the seat back pocket on the airplane. The article made it sound pretty good so we read some reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. This place, pardon the pun, ROCKS!

First off, the location is only one block off of Freemont Street, on Third Street, an easy walk from all of the Freemont Street action.

The place has a really cool grunge, rock bar feel, yet it is appropriate for all ages. Our 11 year old and 19 year old both really liked the place, especially the good music/video mix they have playing.

We visited Pizza Rock twice while we were in Vegas. Visit #1 was so good, we had to go back for more a few days later.

Visit #1 - I can't remember the server's name, but she was awesome. Her recommendations were spot on and our drinks were always full. We ordered the Cal Italia pizza which is a sauceless pizza with Asiago, Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Fig Preserve, Prosciutto, and Balsamic Reduction. It was amazing. One of the best pizzas we've ever had. My 11 year old had the Margherita and it was very similar to the Margherita pizzas you find in Rome. We finished lunch with a Tiramisu and it was extraordinary! The best I have ever had!

Visit #2 - The second time we came to the restaurant was a Saturday around 10 PM and it was significantly busier than our visit a few days earlier, at lunch. This time we had the New Yorker, which was good, but it did have too much Garlic and the Ricotta gave the pizza an odd taste. If you are a Garlic and Ricotta fan, you will like it, me not so much. We also ordered Frank's True Italian, which is a Pesto Pizza similar to the style you find at Grimaldi's, it was very good.

Long story short, this place is a top notch pizza joint and it deserves all of the awards it has won. My favorite pizza place in Nevada, bar none.",8qsmYLq50FrvChuNrJbLEw,2,2,5,agAf-l8aVqGSCERBnPWdVQ

We asked the waitress to make sure she was back before happy hour ended and we quickly put together an order of a ton of appetizers to share as well as PBRs and individual pizzas for the group.  

For appetizers I tried the fried green beans, garlic bread, and meatballs.  For my pizza I had the Cal Italia which apparently won the food network pizza champions challenge.  They won't get any argument from me on that distinction; it was well deserved.  All of their food was incredible, and I really wish I had more time in Vegas to try more of their menu.

1324900,2014-01-12,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I went to Pizza Rock on a Saturday night, mainly wanting to try it after hearing about the award winning pizza. Before going, I personally thought ""Rock"" as a theme for a pizza restaurant marketing world cup pizzas was strange. I suppose one gets used to the typical pizza place filled with brick veneer and recreated vintage signs. Pizza Rock is certainly a representation of the owners personal taste. It is poorly laid out, however. You enter into a relatively dark entrance, that is juxtaposed to an overly bright take-out bar to your right. The host's stand behind wood topped tool chests with iPads hanging from them. You would not know the they were employees if they weren't behind the chests. Guest waited against the walls on chairs. It was loud, like a sports bar, with the roar of the Patriots Colts game. 

We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, they took my phone number so they could text me when our table was ready. I thought this was a cool feature, even more cool, our wait may have only been about 5 minutes. 

They sat me and my girlfriend at a table for two, it was in a very unappealing space. It kind of felt floating in space, right by the busy restroom hallway, kitchen door, and main path of travel for customers to their tables. Back to how it is poorly laid out, the restaurant is overly long and narrow. I did not walk the entire thing, but the seating felt unorganized with out clear paths of movement that are not distracting to guests. Many times during the meal did new parties moving to their tables walk on all sides of our small for-two table, making us feel consciously swarmed for a brief moment. 

Enough about the place, now to the meal and service. We sat down and immediately started reading the menu, their are many many options of unique pizzas complete with the temperature they cook it ATM the prices seemed fair. Our Caesar salad may have been a little overpriced though at $10 - but it was plenty to share. 

We were not immediately greeted by a server to take a drink order, probably about 5 minutes passed before we got concerned and happened to make eye contact with someone we thought might work there. Again, not dressed in any uniform or some sort, we simply notice he was talking briefly to our hostess. He asked us if we had been seen and then quickly got our drink order and server. 

The server was nice and adequate, he did wear a uniform, but the service was nothing exceptional, about the standard you expect in such an establishment. I will say the food did come quick after ordering it however, and the 10% locals discount is appreciated. 

We ordered a Caesar salad to share and the fried green beans appetizer. The Caesar was good, but the dressing was a bit cashier than I prefer. The fried green beans were disappointing because they were not actually fried. I was looking forward to something crunchy, maybe a bit salty but they are actually saut√©ed I believe. They were still good, just not what we were lead to believe. 

OK, the pizza. We ordered the ""Cal Italia"" (I believe it was called) it was one of the award winning pizzas. It came fast and was delicious. The crust was airy and flaky and the fig sauce drizzled on top gave a perfect sweetness to each bite. The pizza was the perfect size to share for two after an appetizer, at about 6 medium sized slices. However, once again slightly mislead. This was a sauceless pizza, although I am pretty sure the menu said ""Vine ripe tomatoes sauce"".. maybe this one was a exception for the category it was under and I overlooked this detail. 

I give this place 3 out of 5 stars for the whole package. The facility lacking basic design logic to make the experience comfortable and inviting. This isn't a critique on the decor and theme, but the basic layout. The service was pretty standard, I think I expect a bit more from these boutique restaurants, maybe it was an off night. I'd rate the food 4 out of 5, and would like to try more items on their menu, but I'll be in no hurry to go back. 

I say try it when taking a night out Downtown or if visiting Vegas. Its a casual place to bring a group of friends or family, watch the game, and get some pizza.",l59bJN_K-OVGNeKh9cWgpQ,0,0,3,2arXdvdMsG6YN34CwlqIyw

It was just a little too in-your-face rock n' roll for me. Sure, I may be sounding like an old curmudgeon whose coffee is too hot, but I felt like the atmosphere was drowning out everything else here, including the wonderful pizza. It bothers me when a place tries too hard for a style (i.e. Double Down Saloon), and that is precisely what Pizza Rock does best. What the hell does rock n' roll have to do with pizza anyway? My guess is that the owner/chef loved rock n' roll, was a shitty musician, but a great chef. So he took what he loved and juxtaposed it with what he excelled at. The summation of this effort is Pizza Rock. With all of that said, let me be clear here that the pizza was lovely.

We have to order no cheese which is fine but for some reason, their sauce is just lacking of flavor. One pizza we had actually had burnt stuff sprinkled all over the bottom...was it burnt pepperoni etc scraps? Ugh I would hate to think that.

We seriously thought the few times we have been here the salad was better than the pizza.

The service...even though they try hard...it's horrible. 
Consistently bad service. They deliver items to the table and then you don't see them forever. Or when you don't need anything they check up on you every thirty seconds.

We used our 15% yelp  check in discount . So. One amazing gluten free pizza that did NOT taste like cardboard cooked to perfection. We broke vegetarian protocol and added a Chicago fennel sausage (yep!) . One word. EXCELLENT  . We complimented our pizza wIth a local brew 'downtown brown ',
Ashley told us about a very special cocktail that is her favorite. We thought we should be polite and have them for desert.:)
 A Spicy Pomegranate Margarita.  over the top!! Oh yeah vegas baby.  Grounded Lavender sea salt rim, with orange & pomagranite liqueurs, home made sweet n sour freshest squeezed fruit with a Serrano infused Tequila . Oh yes ! Huge glass for $9.50 way worth it!

Had the Caesars salad and the Brooklyn calzone.  The food was on par, the service was not.  In the latter half of the meal, server disappeared.  

They came up for air once, to deliver the check, then nowhere to be seen for 15-20 minutes.   Eventually, way later, another server who had walked by my table over-and-over grabbed the credit card leather in frustration and closed the ticket out.

Extremely frustrating and disappointing service after a meal with food worth coming back for.  

Service matters, Pizza Rock.  It would be beneficial to not leave your customers hanging for 15-20 minutes when they're ready to end the meal and pay for your enjoyable food.",_yUhGXYbhO38PxwFUrB3KQ,0,0,3,80dE-SZ21gGn90lvxSXqDg
1363602,2018-05-01,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Best pizza of my life so far, definitely not the best service though.

We had 2 pies, the margarita and the New Yorker. They serve all different styles of pizza. We chose these two because they are classics and both won awards. The New Yorker was hands down the best. We love good crust, simple and fresh ingredients and this one delivered. A must get in my opinion with pepperoni, sausage, cheese, ricotta, sauce dollops and a garlic base. 

The restaurant itself is great. It is a pizzeria when you walk in, but the restaurant area has a great industrial ambience. We were just two and had a great table enclosed with curtains which felt romantic. 

The service fell way short though. It was a busy Friday night. Our server had a large table, and it was pretty obvious our 2 top was not her priority. We ordered apps and a salad, and our table was pretty small. When our two pizzas came no one cleared the dirty app or salad plate and didn't leave any room for us to eat the pizza. We actually had to ask someone to make room for us and clear our plates. Then we were left with no plates to share our pizza so our pizza sat for a while before we could get someone else over to our table to help us. Our server after rushing us through our drink and food order was never to be seen again until bringing our check. I don't really care that it was a busy Friday or that she has a bigger table, your 2 top is just as important as your 8 top. And if you have staff running food and refilling water they should see a table full of dirty dishes and 2 customers not eating their pizza and fix that. I don't think that's really above and beyond service, that's just basic service...

However we will be returning when in Vegas again, and will give both the pizza and the service another try!",BLR-zeDV-huhKqojtjr2LA,0,0,5,CFwPtzEDfozOKFV2Ac9sGg

Staff was very friendly (Thanks Ty!, and the manager that shared some free beer samples) and made the whole experience fun.  They had a happy hour going (who knew?) so the beer was a little cheaper, and some good food specials.

We didn't really feel like pizza, so we opted for the gorgonzola fries, and WOW, were they ever good!  Creamy, hot, cooked just right.  Not over seasoned or sauced.  A great late night treat!  Saw the meatball special and the couple that had them said they were wonderful as well.

What concerned me was the bar service or lack of.  After receiving my order I noticed that the bartenders all started cleaning up the bar.  I mean really cleaning up the bar as in removing everything, packing up and wiping down as if they were getting ready to close for the night.  No one asked if I wanted anything else or another drink.  The message sent was ""we're done here and so are you.""  However, it was only 11 pm on a Saturday night. When I checked with the front they said the bar is open until 2 am.  Also I didn't care for the to-go containers for the pizza.  The one for pasta rocked but the pizza box was so flimsy and weak my pizza almost fell out a few times. Dominoes has better boxes.  And the grocery store bag I was given to hold everything also didn't work because it was too small to hold everything.  Being that your pizzas can cost up to around $30, investing in a nice paper to-go bag that everything fits in would be nice.  And maybe let your staff know when you close.  I know this place is successful but it is the 2nd place on my Vegas visit that I noticed after experiencing success  seems to go towards an attitude of ""we're popular now so we don't care if you come back""  Customer service was not a priority and it almost felt inconvenient for me to be at the bar as the servers there were more intent on cleaning up for the evening.  You're still my favorite pizza place downtown but I hope the service at the bar is better next time. Don't forget your customer service skills.",9__yr8Aaw4nUZpDTsQkcsQ,1,0,2,aEsPZtgCWsZPljbniFAD7Q

1434002,2015-11-19,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"A couple years ago, I thought it would be a good idea to have a restaurant that specializes in serving several distinctly different types of pizza as a sort of homage to the great pizzas from around the world. Well this place beat me to it and did it better than I ever could.

The concept is solid. The execution is, well impressive. Only drawback is that the sheer variety of doughs they have to make forces them to limit several of the pies to a daily maximum. On one occasion they were already out of the pizza we wanted. Still, our second choice was quite good so no harm, no foul.

Happy hour food specials are very reasonable and quite good. The meatballs, although simple, are excellent.

Slice bar up front serves only the new york-style slice, which is definitely not the strength of this place, but if you are in a rush I think the Picante slice is a creative change of pace from traditional flavors and is definitely worth a try.

Finding myself completely alone at the spacious, circular bar and completely unfamiliar with the menu, I threw myself at Ashley's mercy. I asked what she liked. She recommended a popular pizza called the Cal Italia. It was a meat-free pizza but ""don't knock it 'till you try it,"" she told me. 

Oh, and I should mention this pizza won the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge. So honor this pizza!

Ashley had enough charisma and steadiness to her voice that I decided to trust her. 

I'm glad I did. This pizza was not only a beautiful work to look upon, but was very tasty as well. Tons of flavor. I'd rank it up there as one of my top five pizzas ever. Seriously. Loaded with asiago, Mozzarella, imported Gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and balsamic reduction. The combination works majestically. 

See the pic I uploaded here and tell me she ain't a beaut! A swirly kind of ""optical illusion"" kinda pizza.

Ashley noticed I didn't finish my crust. Yeah I don't like to down an entire pizza and if I leave the crust I feel like I only ate half.

1467771,2015-02-01,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"First off, the pizza here is GOOD. The best I've had in Vegas (so far, because my pizza quest is never ending). Here's the thing, I only ordered a very simple pie - cheese & pep - and loved every single bite. Sure did eat a regular sized pie all by myself. No shame. Judge me if you want to, but that pizza brought out my inner Ninja Turtle.

The beer slection was okie dokie... there are a few craft selections that I would've liked to see - but hey, it's Vegas and the craft beer scene is still developing. Plus side is that there were quite a few selections that I wasn't familiar with, so I got to try something new and enjoyed it! 

The atmosphere was interesting... I found it enjoyable to watch the music videos and comedy sketches on the various screens located throughout the restaurant. Kind of noisy - so soft talkers may want to speak up. The decor was... all over, honestly. There's  a friggin semi truck front in there! I like how all of the staff has a rock/punk look & vibe. 

""Well if everything was so good and you enjoyed yourself, why not give it 5 stars?!"" 

Firstly, I can't name this the best, yet. This may not be as good as it gets...that's the feeling it left me - fantastic, but maybe there's  phenomenal out there. 

Secondly, the host stand kinda jacked that last star, man. There was a nice little crowd in Pizza Rock during our visit, so we were on a wait... no big. They asked for our number to text us when a table became available. About 20 minutes after our quoted wait, I watched two parties, who had arrived and gave their names after us (we were standing near the host stand the entire time) get seated before us. Maybe they had reservations...maybe they had checked in earlier... I wasn't  sure so we went up to ask about how much longer. Neither of the previous mentioned situations were the case - we had just been forgotten. Womp, womp. So be sure to keep an eye on the hosts or you'll  be standing around hungry with the scent of delicious pizza taunting you.

Maybe next time Pizza Rock can get that 5th star from me. :)",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,2,1,4,rPveHHJPcCqBsnZ0BwYwzQ

That's right, if you are seated in the dining room you have to get up and go purchase your pizza slice. Your only other lunch options are burgers (I'm not ordering a burger at a pizza joint), meatball sub, Italian sandwich or chicken sandwich. So... Bring a large group, or don't bother. Your lunch options are salad, one of three sandwiches, a burger or walk up and get your own food. 

What's ridiculous... They have a happy hour menu with personal sized pizzas. But it's only after 3pm.  Why not make it a lunch. Is the food good? Who cares. Stupid restaurant. Stupid employees. I ordered iced tea. My buddy ordered water. The girl had a 50/50 shot at getting it right. She failed.

I had the Margherita and New York pizza. Both were delicious! The Margherita's crust was so thin and yummy, I think it's my favorite.

1485496,2015-03-24,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I've eaten at Pizza Rock three times already, so I thought maybe it was about time give a review...This place, without a doubt is serving some of the best pies in Las Vegas. I live in Henderson, so I rarely venture downtown unless friends or family are in town (you know how Hawaii folks love their downtown casinos). but this place is pretty easy to get into, just valet at the Downtown Grand. Walk through and out the side of the casino, and there it is right across the street (be sure to get valet ticket validated at the restaurant, so parking free).

My new absolute favorite pizza is their Cal Italia, topped with a mix of my favorite Italian cheeses (including Gorgonzola, yum!), a nice handful of prosciutto, fig preserve, and finished with a spiral of balsamic sauce. It's a perfect concoction of tastes I like, the hint of sweet with the savory. the crust, awesome with the right amount of crunch.

Other pizza I've tried...the Mob Boss, thick and crunchy awesomeness. The Garlic with clams pizza, tasty, loaded with lots of garlic and the single clam in the shell on each slice is a nice touch (tip: don't eat the shell...). The Romana #2, large served on a board with 3 different pizzas...pepperoni,sausage and cheese on one side, a sweet pesto in the middle, and a pepperoni, with sweet peppers and topped with fresh basil. All delicious.

Besides the outstanding pizza, they also serve some really good pasta dishes. I brought my parents here, my dad had the lasagna and said it was the best he had ever had...the meatballs are amazingly juicy and tasty...the Mac and Cheese, forget about it, it's got bacon in it! Cheesy, porky goodness...

So, after all I've told you, all you want is a salad? Got you covered, the Caesar salad is legit, or try the arugula salad topped with a heap of bacon (or was it pancetta?)...or maybe spring for the Salumi Formaggio (spelling?) board, my wife's favorite. A selection of sliced meats and cheeses, fig preserve and candied walnuts.

So, overall...great experience, prices in line for what you're getting. So what if the music's too loud, I think it's great they have DJ booth built inside the cab of an 18 wheeler!...I mean, who does that? Come on people, try something new, get out of your comfort zone, put down that greasy, congealed slice of pepperoni pizza from the ""Hut"" you're used too. Me, I can't wait to go back...I hear they just opened second Pizza Rock at GVR, so now I won't have to wait until family's in town.

1513908,2013-12-14,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Wow, really? In the middle of Vegas? I find a restaurant that serves a true Neapolitan pizza? I am truly amazed. 

I'm here visiting Vegas with my 19 month old while my husband is here training so I did a yelp search to find somewhere to have lunch. When I saw this place pop up on my search I initially wrote it off because I haven't had many good experiences with Neapolitan pizzas in the US (of all the States I've visited, Portland surprisingly had the most delicious Italian style pizzas). Anyway going back to my yelp search, I saw that the owner/chef here won a pizza award in Naples (side note: my husband's father is from Naples, so we visit the city often) so I knew I had to try this.

I ordered a house salad (which the waitress told me was half a Caesar salad), meat balls and the Neapolitan margherita pizza with bufala mozzarella. They were all delicious!! The meatballs were devoured by my 19 months old son. I thought they were beautifully made and the marinara sauce was just perfect. The pizza dough was just the way I like it and should be, soft and chewy with a bit of char to it. Mmmmmm I dipped the leftover crust in the meatball sauce, genius! Ahaha

I was pleasantly surprised, and at the same time amazed that anyone here in Vegas could really appreciate this food. No offence. But Americans (I'm a Brit/Japanese) prefer American style pizzas. I'm sure that's why this place offers different styles of pizza from Cali to NY pizzas. I'm not a fan of those so I didn't try them. But I've no doubt that everything on the menu is delicious here. 

I hope Pizza Rock expand into Los Angeles so I can eat this every week! I saw that SLS hotel is going to house 800 degree pizza from Spring 2014 so seems like there'll be some competition starting next year.",aBA_aA1o7IzjaGFlG-2ihg,2,0,5,I1_KBOOKYvapjNrfOf-jRw

It's not PR fault it's just the way of Downtown. Inside is great for dining if you are with a group. If you just want a slice or 2 of pizza then check out the pizza window. The line can get crazy long but the guys working behind the counter do a great job at keeping the line moving. Slices start at $4 and they are huge. What I like about this pizza window is that you can try a few different types of pizza without getting a whole pizza of the same or half and half. Another thing you can get at the window is a side of their meatballs and I recommend you do that.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,12,11,4,I52w-5M5421-tSkt_OZKeA

But on this occasion we were enjoying some downtown attractions and decided to walk over for a slice.   Now these slices are HUGE!  I chose Pepperoni and was very pleased with the taste, a little greasy but fat is flavor right? 

I will say that I was disappointed to see that a cheese pizza that just came out of the oven was tossed into the garbage right in front of us.  I saw the cook lift it up a little and I guess to him it was more on the well done side so he tossed it.   I get that there is a certain quality they are going for and although I appreciate that as the consumer, wasting food is not a good impression.  It was salvageable and they could definitely think about donating their slightly imperfect pies to some of the local shelters, or some of the food service programs for the homeless (rescue mission) just saying.   

They have daily specials and honestly they all looked delicious, and the place always looks busy which is a great sign.   There were a few of us using our complimentary slice coupons that were graciously given to us by the facility some time ago and we just never thought we would take advantage of these until now, the only problem I found is that the worker taking them had a bit of an attitude and kept repeating ""Oh you have one too?"" in a bothered sort of way.

Location - in Downtown near the Fremont street experience. Not a lot of convenient parking since it is downtown. 

Restaurant - loud, spacious, plenty of seating for large and/or small parties.

Service - A-ok.  No complaints about our server. 

Food- tried meatballs and calamari (half spicy / half regular) for appetizers. And Picante pizza for main meal. Overall not bad but nothing memorable. I didn't like the spicy calamari though. I thought they would toss in cherry peppers or something like that for the spiciness. Except it was more like chili powder. Way too overpowering in a bad way.

I'd give it one more shot and order something different to truly judge whether it's worth repeat visits or not.",3l5lrs0_voc3cZz_UiLeZA,1,1,3,19hB0eMu92j7oVS7CHod4g

THIS spot gave me some hope in humanity. Actually, it knocked my socks off.

Last week, I met up with some friends for a chill Happy Hour and my friend suggested this spot. I was hesitant at first, but I'm down for an adventure.

Here's the breakdown:

Drinks
-- Awesome Happy Hour. Ends at 6pm M-F.  My massive beers were $5.50. Clean beer lines, no skunkiness. Absolutely perfect.
--$3 well drinks

Food
-- Amazing! Get the meatballs. $3 for 3. They are swimming in marinara which was also fantastic. I don't usually care for marinara, so this stood out.
-- Pizza: You MUST get the Cal Italia! Fig preserve, prosciutto, asiago etc. Amazing.

Ambiance
--PERFECT. Great for groups, small and large. Music is fun and the TV's are MASSIVE. I'd definitely come back to watch a game here.

Service
--Very accomodating. Our server was awesome and attentive without being annoying.

After a little 80's reference, good tunes were playing in the large dining area which was clean and open.  Decor is edgy with a flare.  Located just a block off Fremont, it's one of the better places to eat downtown.  

We were greeted and seated immediately  .Our service here was great.  Our waitress had an upbeat personality making it a pleasure to dine here.  It was during happy hour so we started with the $3 appetizers of meatballs and Gorgonzola fries.  The meatballs are huge with great herbs and spices making these a win.  The Gorgonzola fries did not fall short either.  The creamy cheese drenched the fries with cheese crumbles also on top.  Both appetizers were delicious and would order again.  

For our pizza choice we went with the Diavola.  It was topped with sopressata, hot red pepper oil, parmigiano-reggiano and arugula.  We chose to leave the arugula off.  This wasn't my favorite. I thought it would be a little more spicy but it was ok.

The pizza looked great and the sauce and cheese were very good. Unfortunately whoever baked the pie burnt the crust. I don't mean they toasted it; there was an overwhelming charred flavor that really ruined the pizza.

A few Blue Moons and a Spanish Fly (really enjoyed the agave nectar).  Chorizo mussels served in a spicy tomato sauce over thick chunks of toasted bread.  Battered & fried (not greasy!) large whole artichokes served with a slightly spice aioli (nice size for the price and were slightly addicting).  And this was just the beginning (Go ahead, read it again with a smile).

Six hungry, hedonistic gastronomes with an expectation of sumptuous, savory sustenance drawn from a not-so-long-ago memory of amazing pizza in San Francisco.  Tony's Pizza Napoletano.

Will Tony's pizza be just as good here as it was in San Francisco? Will the hot (ok, not so hot in November), dry Mojave desert climate affect the chewy goodness of Tony's pizza crusts?  Will two pizza's suffice?  Perhaps we should opt for three?  Perhaps order two and add a third later?  Our friendly server, Autumn, suggested placing our order all together due to several large parties.  Thank you, Autumn!

Here goes:
Clam and garlic - OMG.  Best damn clam pizza we've had.  Perfect Goldilock-sized pieces of clam with garlic generously enveloping every bite.

Diavola - Like spicy?  We like spicy.  And we really like Diavola!  A spicy pie served with generous chunks of sopressata, mozzarella, and arugala.  And oh yes, a spicy tomato sauce.  I loved that the arugala was ever so slightly wilted, providing a slight pepperiness without being overly bitter.

Qual Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale - Guanciale is one of our favorite Italian pork products.  The rich flavor of the buttery guanciale paired beautifully with the delicate flavors of the potato, quail egg, and mozzarella.  Very nicely done!

After consuming all but a small slice of the clam & garlic and looking at it sadly, then glancing around the table, we realized we were satisfyingly satisfied.

And then Autumn brought the dessert menu.  Mind you, we were stuffed.  Truly.  I just kept thinking how perhaps a bit of gelato would... I don't know, do... something.  So, since we started a coconut trend earlier in the evening I delightedly selected some coconut sorbet.  My sister chose the Pecan Turnover - a puff pastry brimming with a sweet maple-pecan crunch and a generous serving of ice cream on top.  The coconut sorbet was a very generous serving of refreshing coconut, and I feel badly and a little sad that I wasted so much.

Are you a local?  Do you love pizza?  Do you like hanging downtown?  Me too!  And guess what?!  Locals receive a discount.  Oh yes.  Keep me coming back, baby.  And... they have take out.  I sense Mastunicola in my future (by the way, Google translator is great for learning how to correctly pronounce Italian pizza names).

NEW YORKER 23
Winner, Best Traditional in the World, Vegas
Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, 
Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta

The ricotta was not how I usually see ricotta on a pizza. This was whipped and light and I can't say I was a huge fan of it, but as you can see I still give the place 4 stars. If the ricotta was not whipped and so soft, I would have liked it thicker if that makes sense. It would have been absolute perfection of a pizza! 

The pepperoni was top notch, and this is coming from someone who hates pepperoni. I never get pepperoni on pizza. It was small, crispy, and tasty. Although a bit greasy, nowhere near what I think of when I think of pepperoni. I am just glad I tried what real pepperoni should be and now I can't say I hate pepperoni. Sausage, I would never ever choose sausage on a pizza but I was with my friend and hubby and majority rules. Well, this sausage was really good. I rarely ever say that about sausage or any meat on my pizza. The combinations of flavors on this pizza was perfect. The toppings were spread out perfectly getting a bite of almost everything in each bite. The dough was perfect and cooked to perfection, also tasted good and I ate the crust. This pizza dough was exactly the pizza I like. 

The service was very good for being as crowded as they were. I was actually surprised by the good service we got with that many people in the restaurant.  Our waiter was so friendly and came around just the right amount of times. I did not need to hunt him down for more water, and he did not come often enough that it was annoying. 

I was expecting rock music since they are called Pizza Rock, but I did not hear rock music. I heard music that reminded me of skating at the skating rink in junior high. I enjoyed it, but it was really really really loud. I could not hear my friend who was sitting right in front of me. 

One of their downfalls for me is their location. It works for them though and I am sure brings the great business. I am just being selfish and prefer to go to restaurants not on the strip or not in downtown.  The wait was a one hour wait (I hate waiting for food) and they were extremely packed! I saw bachelorette parties, wedding parties, large parties, and all kinds of interesting people (people who looked dressed up for a marathon, literally ran the marathon then came in for pizza? love that). It was a tourist crowd for sure. Parking is a bit of pain coming from someone who got spoiled by Vegas' easy parking. But, it won't stop me from coming, it just is more of a ""hassle"" being in downtown area near Fremont. I wish they would open one in downtown Summerlin *hint hint*. 

All of their pizzas look amazing and I can't wait to try the prosciutto and pear, clam and garlic (brings back childhood memories of clam pizza on Venice beach-I have not had clam pizza since and would love to try theirs), cal italia, and more. 

-1 star only because music was too loud, waits are long, ricotta was weird to me, and a bit pricey. It won't stop me from coming back because I really enjoyed the majority of everything in this restaurant, specifically the pizza. 

I did get a yelp check in offer and was very happy about that!!",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,1,1,4,HBdFdHCfqFSkvPEfFrOYAA

1708733,2015-06-09,9,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Possibly the worst margherita pizza I've ever had. 

I don't know who in Italy voted for this but our pizza was wet and soggy. When I picked up my slice the tip drooped & I was hoping I was about to get punked. I really couldn't believe that we were served this pizza. I can't imagine it's meant to be this way & it was also really charred, overwhelming the wettest pizza as a whole. My man said to me that my search has to stop because he can't handle anymore let downs. 

We also had the meatballs & garlic bread which were excellent. Decided on tiramisu as well to get the pizza taste out of our mouths. 

The place itself is a lot of fun with so much personality. It's also very dark which I always love. It had so many manly features like a semi truck! Fun! But it also thought of the ladies with chandeliers & a super cute restroom (I love it when places don't forget about the restrooms). The service was great & the atmosphere was awesome but I still can't get over our soggy pizza. After all this place is called Pizza Rock & our pizza didn't rock at all.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,20,13,2,zPDgJ2q0NU1cnFCiWbYasQ

The pizza by the slice is huuuuuuuuuge! Greasy and delicious, just the way I like it. 

I, however, opted for a whole pie. The 13"" is 6 pieces. The slices are much smaller than the slices sold alone, but look just as good. The pizza sauce tastes homemade! Legit italian pizza. They don't skimp on the cheese or pepperoni either. There is seating inside if you wish to dine inside, or theres a nice little patio with outside seating. You can get drinks at the bar nextdoor and hang out.

Perfect deep dish crust with buttery crispness.  Authentic brick cheese and perfect sauce on top.  I added fennel sausage and wow the flavor was amazing.  The pizza is cut in four slices and are huge.  This way everyone has a corner piece. The service was quick and our waiter was attentive but not overbearing.

The Old Chicago is crispy thin and just the right amount of cheese.

1718906,2014-12-13,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I wasn't expecting much after trying grimaldis but damn, I gotta say, this place is pretty impressive. We started out with a small Caesar which is weird, because the menu listed only one size, but I gotta say it was the best Caesar salad I had in a very long time. I'm still dreaming of it. Usually anchovies are brown/gray in color these were white. We also had the fried artichokes which looked like two pieces of fried chicken, yes two, so if your party is larger than 2, I'd suggest ordering more. it came with a thousand island looking dressing which was flavored with horse radish. After this pizza came I used this sauce for the ends of my crust. We also ordered the picante style pizza, which is a some what spicy pizza with Serrano peppers, banana peppers, calabrese peppers, linguica, cholulua sauce, and chorizo. Things u must know: 

A) there's a yelp coupon if you check in here for 15% off your bill

B) if you want to dine in but want slices you have to order from the front first because the front take out and the restaurant do separate things was what the waiter said. 

C) if you see something from the front that you like, buy it cuz it runs out.

D) the front counter serves pizza with pineapples but not the back, I saw a pie with jalape√±os,pepperoni, pineapples, and dollups of ricotta that I coveted but when I got back they sold out :(. 

E) valet parking at the grand hotel which is located right across the street.",Ao55V9Y8yFdKqpU1J6vMPw,0,0,4,w56Y53hcg6KvP7SyQlYORw
1724313,2015-01-08,2,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Pizza Rock

Location/Parking: Across from Downtown Grand Hotel and Casino. Limited parking in front of the restaurant, so park in the hotel garage.

Atmosphere: Casual and friendly. There's a nice dining room if you want a sit-down meal, a walk-up order counter inside for take-out orders, and a walk-up window outside if you don't feel like coming inside at all.
 
Cleanliness: No issues. The one time I sat down to a table in the dining room was very pleasant. 

Service: The service inside and outside is great, but the walk-up window isn't open that late. When it's open it's fine, but it closes at midnight. Midnight? In Vegas? For a walk-up window? Don't they realize how many drunk tourists are out there stumbling around looking for a good slice of cheese at 3am? Sadly, they have lost my business more than a few times for closing early.

Food/Drinks: I've been here four times so far and have ordered a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni from the counter and from the outside window, and I've had a whole pepperoni pie inside in the dining room. Good stuff. They even have a gluten free crust available, but if I'm going to cheat and eat pizza, I'm going balls to the wall and getting the good stuff. Speaking of good stuff, the Chianti they serve is really nice. 

Happy Hour: I haven't been lucky enough to hit it at the right time, but they have a Happy Hour 3-5-7 Menu. Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm and late night 10pm to close. Draft beers $3-$5 and wines by the glass $2 off. Several snacky size appetizers for $3, $5, or $7. Probably worth trying if you're in the area.

Price: $4 for a slice of cheese, $4.50 for pepperoni. Totally reasonable for such delicious cheesy goodness, especially in Vegas. Full menu available for inside dining, but let's be honest, 99% of the time you just want a quick, hot, delicious slice of cheese to go. How you negotiate eating it while walking around downtown sipping a 100-oz. adult beverage through a ginormous straw? Well, that's on you.",PP7mV3SKVhtkuhwUDHUJXQ,4,2,5,V4ilowYH5J3iWYwsIdKmmw

So you can bring a group of people who are craving different styles,  and all of you will be happy! I've tried several pizzas here and I have to say that the crust is amazing on all of them,  no matter which kind you get. 

They have a variety of appetizers,  and some main dishes if you aren't interested in pizza.  I recommend the meatballs if you're looking for a quick bite.  

The thing I'm most happy about is the Beer list.  Pizza and Beer are just meant to go together,  and with such a variety in their pizza,  they need to have a variety in their beer... and boy do they! So many great brews on draft,  and an excellent bottle selection.  

One thing about this location I would change is the dining room ambiance.  The Bar is... Ok,  but the dining room feels like you're in a cheap food court,  and believe me this isn't cheap pizza.",qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg,1,2,4,_x9yNLK9E0vZCp-GJInkQw

But actually it's no problem at all since they validate parking at the Grand Hotel. On walking in, there is a very noisy vibe.

The number of pizzas on the menu is somewhat intimidating for those of us here for the first time. We settled on a very thin crust Pizza that came out almost wafer thin with excellent cheese and toppings. We also got salads. The Caesar salad was truly outstanding. The garden salad was just above average. The only thing wrong with the meal is that they seated a young couple down next to us that were drunk out of their minds and ended up leaving without paying the bill. They also managed to spill water all over the table.I felt bad for our server who did nothing wrong, got stiffed for her tip, and had extra cleanup.

1846091,2016-04-08,6,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I hate to be a party pooper, but I just don't get the hype. I came here with extremely high expectations, and I was seriously let down. Not just once, but on a few occasions.

On my first visit, I had their ""World Pizza Cup Winner in Naples"" Margherita Pizza (San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Sea Salt and EVOO). I've had some good pizza in my life, but I don't recall ever having an award winning one. Damn, this must be the ish. This was music to my belly and food porn to my eyes. I literally couldn't wait to make love...err...to get my hands and mouth on this pizza. Well, that was about all the foreplay I got out of this as it quickly went downhill once I bit into it. For one, this award winning pizza was not dried enough when it got off the boat from its Italy trip. It was extremely watery and extremely doughy. I mentioned this to our waiter, and he replied with, ""that's the way it's supposed to be."" Okay, I'm Italian, however, I am not an ""award winning"" cook, therefore, perhaps I just don't know what the pizza is supposed to be like. I don't know, maybe it was just me, but I really didn't like how doughy and watery it was so I just left it there.

We also ordered their Classic Meatballs (Smothered in Marinara) and Garlic-Garlic Bread (House Made Ciabatta with Mozzarella, Pecorino Romano and Oregano). The meatballs were extremely salty. They weren't terrible, however, I'd prefer they hold the salt a bit...okay lot. Their garlic bread was pretty darn good and was about the only highlight during our visit.

The second time we went there, we got The New Yorker (Winner of ""Best Traditional Pizza in the World""at the Las Vegas Pizza Expo). Perhaps their award winning traditional pizza would be a hit with me. Nope! Nada! Zero! Not at all. This one was overcooked, and I don't mean slightly, I mean this pizza was burnt. It wasn't pleasant to bite into it. Once again I just left my pizza there. Man, these folks went from one extreme to another, from too watery and doughy to burnt.

Since I really wanted to like this place, we came back for a third time hoping that this one would be the charm. Frankly, I don't remember what I ordered this time, but I do remember getting a ""non award"" winning pizza. Well, once again it was underwhelming and the only thing that I enjoyed was the meatballs and garlic bread. However, what I do recall is that this time my pizza was just flavorless.

I probably won't be back unless I'm in that side of town and I'm in the mood for some good garlic bread.",oGUSlyu6pp2er4wAo6MXQw,6,6,2,p5eevqrK-7MaR8_ujKbX2Q

1913292,2014-04-07,6,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Hands down the best pizza in Vegas- and it's probably not close. It breaks the mold of gangster inspired stuffy pizza joints (prevalent in Vegas) where the Godfather soundtrack plays on repeat all day and every pizza comes with 35lbs of cheese on it. 

I had not been to Pizza rock before last night. I had been to Tony's in SF (another location with the same owner) so I knew how good it was going to be but somehow just never got around to it- shameful I know. It is located downtown just outside of the ruckus. It is across the street from the Grand hotel and casino and you can valet park there to attend the restaurant.

We made a reservation but it didn't look like it was necessary for a Sunday night. As we were being lead to our table it took every bit of restraint I could muster to not snatch slices off the many delicious looking pizzas we walked by. The decor is very Orange County Chopper-esque and the music is a lot of rock from the 90's which is good for the newly over 30 and old crowd. Also when I checked in on Yelp I got a 15% of coupon so make sure you do that. 

The Food

We got two pizzas since we couldn't decide. We had gotten the meatball appetizer in SF and it was great but we decided to skip it and try for dessert. 

Cal Italia- this was the pizza we had in SF and it has haunted us ever since. It is a white style pizza with prosciutto and fig preserves, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. It sounds pretty weird I know but it is INSANELY good.  The Pizza Rock version did not disappoint. 

The Ogden- this had olive, goat cheese, and sausage on a white pizza. I know what you are thinking ""two white pizzas?""- and yes we went there. This was not quite as good as the Cal Italia- but still good. It could of been improved by adding some more goat cheese- some of the pieces had quite a bit, others almost none.

Chicken Parm- I didn't get this unfortunately- someone at the table next to me did. It looked so good I strongly considered cracking his skull open like a coconut and taking it before going on the lamb. 

They have so many other unique flavors of pizza I will definitely be going back in order to try as many as possible. 

Mud Pie- I saw someone else get this dessert and had to get it. It comes with some awesome flavored whip cream (grand marnier?) that is sort of orange tasting- highly recommend.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,5,5,5,M7kPg5hLJlLC36NZx64UYw

The pizza only took about 15 minutes. It was delicious. Im not a fan of thinner crust but it truly was delicious in every way. The crust has a perfect chew, was cooked perfectly, and toppings fresh, not out of a box. Toppings were plentiful, not sparse. We killed the pizza and were eventually full.

The pizza. Well - its a big claim to have won the pizza world cup and try to maintain that standard but its one they live up to. It was excellent and my kids declared it the best pizza he's tasted.

It's located in the heart of downtown Fremont, right across the street from the Grand hotel and casino.  

Wander in and you'll be absorbed by the black interior and its strong grab at being 'rock 'n roll'.  It kind of works.  It kind of doesn't.  But there are some private tables for more intimate dining and there is also a pretty cool looking bar area.

But where it counts - the pizza.  They have so many different ovens and cooking types it made me curious to see their kitchen - it must be massive.  It's either massive or they're lying and every pie goes into the same oven.  But I wouldn't call their bluff.

Don't quote me, but I believe they have 9 different types of ovens/cooking styles.  I ordered the Neapolitan Margarita pizza with a friend.  It was beautifully cooked, fresh, and simple.  I'd highly recommend it for anyone.

The music blasting through the speakers isn't half bad either.  It doesn't make for an quiet dining experience - but the place is called Pizza Rock so that wasn't a surprise neither.

I believe for those looking for a quick bite, they have regular pizza available by the slice by the front door, so you don't have to have a sit-down meal.",pcv-MEpcI6t4_ytr49LFpw,0,0,4,r6ttDEraBdhUrfvQ36Im9w

None of us were wow-ed by the pizza. Too much cheese, soggy dough. Meh. It was fine. The gluten free crust was good and the ingredients were fresh so that's positive. I'm a total pizza snob so maybe my standards are too high. The truffle fries were really good which is the reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2, which I still think is generous because really, I'm in Vegas, I should be able to get good fries lots of places. We did sit outside which was nice. I'm sure there's a better choice for pizza downtown though.",CbVfkcZrSHgSA2uqCzTtsA,1,0,3,NOWTz7TYzts9AyHexI5kQg

Three weeks after my introduction to Pizza Rock, I decided it was time for my taste buds to revisit the flavor, but this time without the delay of delivery.  

We had the Gorgonzola & Apple Salad, I had the New Yorker with a Chianti, and he had the Classic Pepperoni with a local craft beer from Henderson, NV - Citra Rye.  We were pleased, although I didn't feel the Chianti at all.

After about an hour, (he had devoured his pizza minus the slice I had), my pizza was noticeably cold.  I recall earlier this year I had Ethiopian food and ordered the Derek tibs which was served in a hot earthenware dish with hot coals on the bottom - this kept the meat hot for the duration of my meal.  As a recommendation, perhaps integrate this concept to maintain the hot temperature so customers can still enjoy their hot meal after having a great conversation lasting almost two hours.",amvZ9tmLWraWoML6K4Xiuw,1,0,4,hu65K9l--QMaZ0-B628s_w

I went up to the take out counter and like another review said the man behind the counter listed off all the types of pizza's and their ingredients.  Well, not being a brave soul I got the Pepperoni only slice, it was HUGE.  I added a dash of hot peppers and parmesan cheese (Only $4.05 with tax!!!)and started to walk back to work, but the smell got me and I had to take a bite.  Oh my it was good, the wood fire stove taste was there and the sauce was rich and the cheese gooey and I was sold.

First things first, we parked at Binion's and walked a few blocks over. Yes you have to pay for parking, but it's the easiest way. They said the wait for 4 on a Saturday night was around 1.5 hours. We were able to get on a waiting list and gave them our cell number so they could text us when our table was ready. Then we went and hung out on Fremont St. for a bit. I got a text after about 45 minutes so we made out way back and were seated right away! The vibe is relaxed and chill inside. 

We ordered:
Pancetta & Arugula Salad 
Beer Battered Artichokes
6 Meatballs
River City Ranch Pizza (ranch, chicken, mozzarella, bacon, garlic, cherry tomatoes, green onion)
The Butcher Pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, Genoa salami, pepperoni, bacon, linguica, Italian sausage, mortadella, hot coppa, prosciutto)

Salad, meatballs and appetizers came out right away.  Like I am talking within 5 minutes of ordering. I loved the salad, although it was a bit under dressed. The pancetta was crispy and salty and paired nicely with the peppery arugula. The artichokes were just ok, but I liked the dipping sauce that came with them. BTW I love dipping sauces. The meatballs were amazing, I love their marinara sauce as well.

Pizzas came out shortly after our apps. I should mention that the pizzas only come one size. The ones we got were listed as 12-13"", which seems small, but it was more than enough food. I tried the river city pizza which was good, but very salty. Maybe because of the ranch? Speaking of ranch, theirs is excellent! I was too full to try the other pizza, plus I don't really care for all that meat on my pie, but it was gone so I assume it was good. Total for 4 of us was just around $100 with tax and tip. Food good, service good, vibe good! I will be back!

FYI - If you just want a slice to-go, they have a walk-up counter inside the restaurant to get slices, but from what I saw it looked like select items only.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,4,3,4,_59ageNRy0TAIQRYecf4zw

We had a few drinks, the Rosemary Garlic fries,  and split the Honey Pie pizza. The fries were delicious, but they do not skimp on the garlic, so be forewarned! The Honey Pie pizza would have been great on its own, but my companion insisted on adding spicy  sausage to it. Although tasty, this overwhelmed the flavor of the pizza. It probably would have been good with just regular sausage. 

The best part about Pizza Rock is the ambiance! They were playing really fun (and funny) videos on the tv screens all around the restaurant. The volume was loud enough to feel festive, but not so loud that you couldn't hear a conversation.

I understand large groups can be challenging especially with separate checks. The food came out at all different times with some not getting their food until others were already finished.  When the checks arrived on clipboards, we each paid our tab accordingly but there was still a mix up. Myself and a co worker were waiting for our receipt and change after our entire party had already paid and received receipts. After multiple attempts with getting my receipt and change, somehow my coworker paid my bill and I received her change, since it was too much money I was getting back, I knew it wasn't mine and reminded them of my name and order two more times and they had to research what happened, which took another ten minutes. When they figure out what happened, they asked my coworker for the money they gave her back and told them she paid the wrong bill and she owed more money since my bill was less and they needed to now close my bill and hers. We had to wait for a manager that never apologized for the mix up or offer to comp our meal or offer a future meal, as we have now waited 20 minutes or more after our party left.

The toppings were not spread out properly so some parts of the pizza had a lot of bacon the other had nothing. We specifically asked the server if there was a lot of ranch And he  told us there is light ranch on the pizza however when I took that one bite I felt like I ate a spoon full of ranch. After ordering our pizza we never saw our server again. Another one of their staff came by and started helping us but didn't bother to ask if our food was good. It was obvious it sucked since we only ate half a slice of a 16"" pizza. For $21 bucks it was definitely a waste of money. Blaze pizza cost $8  and it's better than any pizza this place has to offer.

A 20 minute wait just to order beverages and we took the queue and ordered food at the same time. After the drinks arrived it was another 20 minutes for two sliders to come out. The two personal pizzas we ordered took more than 30 minutes.

Our zipeline ride was at midnight and we had to ask for the check when the pizza came out because we ran out of time.

2131410,2017-06-05,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"We had newly arrived for my first trip to the city of sin and we decided to hit up Fremont Street on night number two to see what sort of trouble we could get into.  After a rocking great time listening to some 80's/90's band, a ton of great drinks and numerous trips into various bars and touristy shops we decided we wanted to try to get some great pizza, preferably New York style.  So with the aid of my trusty Yelp! app we determined there was a really good place named Pizza Rock nearby.  After a bit of walking we came upon a small place a bit off the beaten path but looked to be fairly busy with people going in and out getting individual slices of pie.  

By the time we arrived it was getting a bit later so many of the patrons of this fine establishment, including my wife and I, were a bit inebriated and beyond hungry.   Thankfully our wait was not long as the guys slinging pies were on top of things and we got our order in.  The pies, like most New York style places, were already cooked and the guys waiting on us were just taking orders, then heating up the slices in the large oven behind them.  Both the wife and I went with traditional pepperoni (nothing fancy here) as we wanted to keep it simple and that was what they had the most of.  

After about a five minute wait we were presented with some fantastically gorgeous, huge, floppy New York style pieces of pizza that I had seen in a long time.  Yes I let the fact go that the pepperonis were not the traditional New York style large, flat pepperonis go because they used the wonderfully small, slightly curled up cupping a tiny amount of grease (don't ever let anyone tell you that good pizza doesn't have grease on it, oh yes it does, just not too much!) on our pizza.

A few bites in and I knew I was going to give this place the highest rating I could because the pizza was freakin' delicious.  The cheese was gooey, the crust was nice and crisp on the bottom but had that big, floppy, New York style feel to it, with a slight bit doughy on the top and the crust at the end was fantastic tasting bread that you want to eat every bite of, not the big crust you end up tossing into the trash.  The sauce was a little sweet but very tomatoey and as mentioned before, the pepperonis were not only delicious looking but phenomenal tasting as well.  Everything about the pizza was top notch and I am getting hungry just writing about it.

Fantastic pizza and probably even more fantastic if you're a little drunk and a little hungry.  Don't hesitate to check it out if you're in the area.  If I lived in this area I'd be buying this pizza on a regular basis.  

One last side note, the guys behind the counter seemed to be having a good time interacting with the crowd and were friendly to us.  Great to see someone enjoying their job and it really made the fantastic pizza all that much better.",MqvuybIfFPZpKbwLcaeutg,1,2,5,Rx7XfVtBaBtaREAAUHf7aQ

2150584,2014-10-12,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"The Skinny: awesome happy hour however the regular dinner items were only okay (3.5) service: pretty good for a pizza joint although it wasn't particularly busy when we went (4) value: amazing happy hour for the price while regular dining is a bit pricey for what it is (3.5 round up to a 4 starred review).

Note about the Parking: do not go inside the Casino for validated parking. Just park in the The Grand self-parking lot across the street and the hostess at Pizza Rock will give you a sticker to put on your parking ticket for free parking. Score!

After visiting twice, I have decided I do like Pizza Rock.

The first visit for dinner, I wasn't terribly impressed. We ordered the old Chicago cracker thin crust pizza and a house salad. 

The old Chicago pizza was okay but nothing I needed to order again. Specifically, the crust is very burnt on the edges of the pizza which was off-putting. Although the sausage/pepperoni/ricotta cheese combination was good, the pizza felt that it was missing something... like a hit of mushroom to kind of unify all the flavors. It was a bit greasy as well.

The house salad is rather small with a very generic tasting balsamic dressing on top. For $6, I'd pass on this.

Enticed by the happy hour prices, we decided hit this joint again. We ordered the personal pizza sized Molinari and the Cal Italia for $7 each and tried the fried green beans for $3 and fried calamari for $5.

The green beans were pretty good. They are not fried per se but sauteed lightly with a lot of garlic. For those who are watching their waistlines, the amount of oil on the bottom of the bowl is intimidating however. For $3, the serving size is quite generous.

The fried calamari was delicious! The calamari was soft and tender while the breading was appropriately on the lighter side. Portion size was rather large. You can get this dish in either the spicy version/non-spicy version or even half and half. Personally, I found the spicy version to be a little too strong for my tastes so I'll stick to the regular version.

The pizza crust was very good - slightly chewy with a nice crispy bottom which was a good change from the burnt crust on their ol' Chicago.

For me, the Cal Italia was only okay - a bit too sweet due to the figs and balsamic reduction and needs a bit more of the gorgonzola and proscuitto to balance things out. I almost wished they hadn't reduced the balsamic vinegar to retain a bit more of the acidity to the dish.

The Molinari was a great old school pizza - it's basically what they call Everybody's Favourite back home in Canada (Sausage and Mushroom). The crust and sauce was great and everything just went well together. Some may think that it is a little greasy (which it is - no doubt) but that comes with the territory when you serve  3 types of sausage on a pizza. So good and totally guilty pleasure.

Overall, this joint has a lot going for it - the variety on the menu is good and the happy hour deals are excellent. Although some of the items are hit or miss, the Molinari and fried calamari will have me coming back for sure. Service is good if you are going during off peak hours/days (we went Happy Hour during the week and Sunday evening at 5:30pm). Overall 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,2,4,RF9R_2yprdz6COsHuaAjCg

Finally luck shined upon me and we went there last night with some out-of-town friends.  I actually had no idea there was an entire restaurant area back there - all I'd ever passed was the little pick-up window with slices.

We were seated within a few minutes of arrival and I dig the decor. Dark with a rock, Italian flare.  Sounds strange, but they do it well.

I ordered the 3 meatballs for an appetizer and they were some of the best darn meatballs I've ever had.  They were rich with flavor, didn't fall apart and were actually quite filling.

My meal was the Artichoke Joe - holy cow. Every single ingredient by itself was good, then it was placed on this magnificent pie and baked.  The roasted artichoke is so tender and juicy, the sauteed spinach has a wonderful flavor without being mushy or overpowering and the Creme di parmigiana was an interesting but delicious surprise. This is probably one of my favorite pizzas ever.  I had some leftovers reheated in the oven tonight and it was still just as good.  Cowabunga, dude.

We never had the patience to wait in line for Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco. But I found out Tony Gemignani opened this place in Las Vegas...what an opportunity!

We came here around 3pm midweek...the place was empty. The bartender served us...he was very friendly and efficient when the place started filling up later.

We started with the gorgonzola and apple salad...this was probably the tastiest thing we had. It was a tasty mix of greens, gorgonzola, apples, candied walnuts, dried cherries and an overly sweet ""balsamic"" vinaigrette. In a recurring theme, it was a bit pricey at $13. The kiddo had the classic cheese pizza, while we had their ""World Pizza Cup Winner""  Margherita Pizza Napoletana at $17 for a 12-incher. This pizza was pretty good, but definitely not the best I ever had. It was...pleasant...but so was the regular cheese pizza. In the ingredients list, they list Fior di Latte mozzarella...in other words, regular cow's milk mozzarella, like 99% of all pizzas in this country! This is what disappointed me the most...at this price, they didn't use mozarella di bufala...this would have made a HUGE difference in taste...as it was, the cheese was rather bland and tasteless. 

So the food was ok...but very pricey. If you are in the neighborhood, by all means stop by if there is no line. I wouldn't make a special trip or wait for this food however.",cHZhssS9U7FXOsxUDISNVQ,0,0,3,X8raj5duzz7yMCpLcjhL-A

I didn't see a build-your-own pizza option, which would have been nice. We had the Vedura pizza and the veggies on it were marinated differently. So, onions tasted one way and tomatoes tasted another. It was a bit overwhelming and very vinegary. Plus there were two types of cheese on it--feta and mozzarella. Not a huge fan. We also ordered the Gorgonzola and Apple Salad which was drenched in dressing and mostly just a big bowl of salad greens. The thing that bothered me the most about this place was the dirty tables. We were surrounded by empty tables covered in dirty plates and glasses. Waiters would dump dirty plates on the tables instead of just taking them into the kitchen. It took quite a while for them to be bused. Maybe the boss was out that day....",0R5zypNdbrt_HZylzl916Q,0,0,2,xhl50u3OKHdg1A3YBy-5kg

And the answer? Yes.

I agree with Nate M that Pizza Rock looks like it could be a douche-tastic Guy Fieri concept, but thank Gaga it's not. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Sure, there's a truck parked in the middle, nbd.

Once you realize the spiky-haired fellow had nothing to do with it, Pizza Rock earns lots of cool points. Sure, the decor is a bit outlandish, but hey--when in Vegas...

The service here is outstanding. Our server was so fun--I wanted to be her bestie. She was fast, attentive, friendly, and just the perfect amount of snark. She also made fantastic food suggestions.

Speaking of the food, we started with a caprese salad, and it was the best I've ever eaten. I couldn't stop eating it... I may have licked the plate. As for the pizza, I had a gluten-free cal italia, which was also delicious. Picture it: cheese, prosciutto, fig jam, balsamic reduction... it was the slam. GF crust tends to taste like cardboard, but not at Pizza Rock! And in a city that either doesn't understand gluten or just sticks their head in the sand, this place was a much-needed respite from a week of explaining how that damn little grain makes me sick. 

If you're in DTLV, you HAVE TO come here. As I sat here writing this review, I caught myself drooling a little bit. Yep, that's how good PIzza Rock was. I cannot wait to go back.",wSByVbwME4MzgkJaFyfvNg,5,4,5,AesyZvVQFn6bBJAlU6nWtg

We started with their version of a caprese salad; tomatoes, mozz, kalamata olives, peppadews, basil and some balsamic dressing. I use most of those things as topping on my pizzas and it was a good start to the meal.   Then came the pizzas.

I wanted to try two different styles of pizza so we ordered the Diavola ""Classic Italian""- style pizza with vine-ripened tomato sauce, mozzarella, sopressatta, arugula, hot red pepper oil and parmigiano-reggiano.  The crust was baked pretty nicely but the pizza was extremely over-topped.  It was just a big soggy mess.  Furthermore, it just wasn't that flavorful or even spicy for that matter. 

The next pizza was their ""World Cup Winning"" Margherita pizza.  They only make 73 per day and I guess we were early enough to get one of them.  I decided to add honey calabrese sausage to the pie.  Unfortunately when the honey met the high heat it just caused it to blacken.  It tasted OK, but it wasn't the right choice for Neapolitan.  As for the Neapolitan pizza itself, I was disappointed here as well.  Although this crust had more taste interest than the Classic Italian crust, it was only because of the charring.  There was no spring whatsoever in the rim.  It was just flat as a pancake. The cheese was utterly forgettable and everything slid off the slice when I tried to pick it up. 

As were leaving I kept thinking to myself that I didn't choose the right pizzas on the menu and my suspicions may be correct.  On the way out, I looked at their to-go slice operation.  The NY-style pizzas looked quite good and that may well be this restaurant's forte, but I won't know until I return to Las Vegas at a later time.",eD9gOUs3fLgT4Ywj6Y0IJg,4,1,3,vjRPxdxk1_jdZzYfCGYO-Q

2497462,2016-01-07,5,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Pizza Rock is one of my top recommendations when out-of-towners ask me where to grub near Fremont. They offer some great happy hour deals and the pizza is pretty freaking good. Pay the up-charge, assuming it's not already on the pie, and add the ricotta. It's a little cheese filled cloud of epic goodness. 

Happy hour runs Monday-Friday from 3 to 6 and every night from 10 to close. They offer some pretty good food specials and there is a good selection of draft beer to choose from. Deschutes Fresh Squeezed is my go-to. It's usually on tap and $2 off during happy hour. Personal pizzas with one topping are 5 bucks and they're pretty big for a personal pizza. 

I've had dinner in the dining room and drinks at the bar. Both are perfectly acceptable options. I tend to choose the bar unless I'm with a group. The bartenders are personable and I enjoy the energy in the bar. People always seem to be having a good time at Pizza Rock.

Usually there is a wait. I have had both fast service and super slow service. The variety of items is what I like. You have a ton of types of pizza. All with fresh handmade dough and only the finest ingredients. The meatballs and garlic fries are both solid appetizers. If you like calzone, the one here is worth trying.

The margarita pizza, had a good char, tasty crust but fell flat on the overall taste. They also gave it to us late but very nice enough to take it off the bill. So A+ for customer service

Even though it is not on Fremont, it is only a quick walk from it. And quite frankly it's worth it since sadly a lot of the food options on Fremont is well... not so good.

We showed up on a Saturday evening and was seated shortly afterwards. The decor of this place is a feast for your eyes. I loved the cute pee-pee sign for the restroom! We were seated right next to a semi truck! There were lots of TVs for your viewing pleasure. LOVE the fact that on some of the TVs there were closed captioning. (I would like to know what's happening instead of watching a silent film, well in this case game.)

Our server, Tim C., was excellent! (He is part of the reason why this place is a 5 star!) We let him know that it was our first time there. He was very thorough in explaining on what was popular. During our meal he came back often to make sure our food was to our satisfaction and if we needed another beer.

As for the food, since we had pizza the night before we decided to have a non-pizza meal. (I know, who goes to a pizza join and not get pizza right?!) I ordered the Gorgonzola & Apple Salad. This hit the spot! Love the combination of the gorgonzola and apple with cranberries and walnuts. It was not heavy at all and it was very satisfying. I had a bite of my husband's Gorgonzola Burger. It was delicious! The patty was very juicy. And OMG can I say their fries that come with it is AMAZING! They use real garlic and they use a lot of it! Really puts some hair on your chest. Definitely don't be kissing anyone after that. But definitely eat it!

2634664,2015-10-13,12,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Pizza Rock is a popular favorite for both tourists and locals alike. I have to give credit where it is due and compliment the owner and staff for truly defining what a modern upscale pizza place is ""supposed"" to look like. It has all the attributes that make it modern cool, like whimsical chalk art, faux semi truck visual display, take out counter, full bar decorated with masculine biker style adornments, a full menu with unique toppings like clams (in the shell) and others. It caters to Yelpers by offering discounts and Check-in offers. It's menu is eclectic and fun. The table has a large white butcher paper covering with crayons provided for drawing and tic tac toe like Macaroni Grill. The sign is neon and ultra hip and cool. The only major issue I have with the place is that it simply tries too hard. 

This is a place that I have dined at 3 times and left every time thinking it was pretty good but also pretty overrated. The pizzas are good. The portions are large but the flavors don't really knock me out of the park. 

I would like to see all the pizzas available in a personal size version. Many of the unique creations are only available in one size. The prices are pretty hefty for a pizza place but it is also expected due to the ""hip & cool"" overall theme that it represents. 

Overall, I do like Pizza Rock. Though I feel it is a tad overrated, it isn't anywhere near as overrated as some other popular places in town (like Hash House a Gogo, for example). It is really a place that you go to because you want to enjoy some better than average food in an awesome cool atmosphere.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,28,22,4,sIaR1jecLVOkW8HN3owoVA

2638913,2013-12-21,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"We had dinner at Pizza Rock last weekend while staying across the street at the Downtown Grand.  We had a 15% off coupon from the hotel so we basically had the tip paid for when all was said and done.  Here's what you need to know.  Pizza Rock is NOT Pizza HUT.  You will be seated with a menu and you will have choices of pizzas that have been designed for you already.  They have different types of crusts and are cooked in different types of ovens and some take much longer than others.  It's very important to ask the server to go over the menu with you so you know what you're getting and then you get to figure out something to share.  The ingredients are very fresh and I THINK we chose the American Classic - Downtown 19.  It was really tasty.  The ingredients were piled high on a medium crust and it was just a mouthful of flavors, especially considering we're usually just plain old pepperoni and pineapple.  And we LOVED the pepperoni they have.  YUM.  Also, we had the garlic bread before the pizza came out and I CAN NOT RECOMMEND YOU EAT THIS ENOUGH!   It's so freaking good, might be the best garlic bread ever with WHOLE garlic cloves on it!  In fact, I want that right now... I might have to make some at home tonight.

They have a good selection of beers and some rotating ones as well.

The ambiance is kind of loud, but fun and there are like two little tucked away 2 tops with curtains that are sort of semi-private.  If you think you might want one, ask at the desk before you get seated!  That's where we sat and we liked it and everyone who walked by said, ""oh, I want to sit there"".   There's your tip.  Great, now it will be full when we go back.  Ah well.

Enjoy it.  I know you will.",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,2,0,4,yjp1FimJu2Qzm0NE7a6v8A

Then we received rude behavior from the manager on right now. 
To be treated with this type of harshness, when we love this pizza is not cool... Then the manager left all of us, went to her waitresses, rolling her eyes. Why? What is the purpose of treating people in this way?

Surprisingly, the Italian fries were ON POINT. Crispy and filling, and oh so flavorful. We tried the rosemary garlic and the truffle. I wonder if we could mix the two. Mental note to ask for this. The group loved both but we ended up ordering a second order of the rosemary garlic because garlic is life. 

They definitely have a large selection of pizza cooked in different ways. We went for ones that won awards - the Margherita and the Cal Italia. The Margherita was a big underwhelming disappointment. The flavor was good but the sauciness soaked into the crust, making it soggy - had to fork and knife it. As for the Cal Italia - we inhaled the crap out of that. The fig preserves gave this pizza an extra oomph that made us end up ordering another one. 

Sangria was good, ros√© option was good, and service not bad. Since it's in the Fremont area it wasn't packed and covered in tourists, which is a win win win.",tnXng4PbOdJKTdMPBYczOg,2,1,4,07AgdTkn60084WsuR3WC8g

2716920,2015-05-22,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"There's pizza and rock music, and a semi tractor inside!  The interior is fairly dark, the truck looks cool (and somehow seems appropriate) but you won't care about the truck while you're enjoying some incredible pizza.  I've been here easily a half a dozen times, took friends in for lunch today, and finally had the presence of mind to check in.  This is my favorite pizza place when I'm in a pizza mood and can get downtown.  So here we go...

You enter right at the corner of N. 3rd St and E. Ogden Ave.   As you walk in, you're greeted by a cool host team always ready to take care of you, no matter how busy the place is.  If you need to wait, there are chairs, or if you're going to be in and out, there's a pizza bar to your right.  Every time I've been there, the place is fairly full (except for the time I arrived very shortly after the doors opened for the day).  I've only made a reservation once, but honestly, I recommend it if you want to be sure you'll get a seat or you have a schedule to keep.  Since they've put the option to make a reservation right on their webpage, it's probably a good idea.  Fast and easy...just do it.

The pizzas:  They're made fresh and they can take a little time to come out, so plan accordingly.  It's never been an excessive wait though.  There's pretty much a pizza on the menu for everyone, so read through it.  It's not a lengthy menu, but there are a surprising number of options.  The price will seem a little high if you're used to fast food pizza, but your taste buds will thank you for spending a little extra for a gourmet pie.

The rock:  The playlist is long enough that you won't wonder why you're hearing that same song again, and the variety is great.  You'll hear current and classic rock, and they've even snuck a little country in there now and then.  The volume is a bit louder than most places with background music though, but it's not so loud as to be annoying.  If you're looking for an intimate and quiet setting though, you may want to look elsewhere for that lunch or dinner and come to Pizza Rock when you want to enjoy the food and the music.  Don't worry, you can still have a conversation with your friends, but the music will be there to accompany you.

Speaking of intimate, most of the tables are set to seat small groups and they're done in a way that the staff can make seating for larger groups.  But there are several places to sit along the wall that I'd consider semi-private booths.  They're nice for a more intimate setting, but remember, you're in Pizza Rock (not Pizza Light Jazz).  (They can also set you up for private dining if you prefer.  Check the website or call them for details.)

There's a bar and happy hour.  If you're in the mood for a beer or cocktail, you can satisfy your craving.  

The waitstaff is always hopping, but they're always awesome, keeping drinks full and checking in regularly to see if there's anything you might need even after you're enjoying your pizza.

So now you've decided to give Pizza Rock a try.  There's metered parking on the streets all over downtown, and you'll want to look on Ogden first as you approach the restaurant.  Interestingly, spots seem to opening up as quickly as they get taken there, so try your luck or even make a couple laps around the block.  Beware of the small, off-street lot marked Public Parking at the corner of North Casino Center Blvd and Ogden.  It's also metered but the cost is $15 for the first hour.   (Yes, you read that right!)  I recommend you stick to the more affordable meters on the street or find another lot associated with the downtown area.  Save your cash for the delicious food!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,1,0,4,TZtTVLpb45066oQSGByQJA

So we started with 3 pretty nice sized Meatballs for 6 bucks. Should of got the 6 for 10 deal because the Meatballs were some of the tastiest chunks of beef I have had in a very long time. The marinara sauce that it sits in might as well have been gold because if I wasn't in a public place and was at home, I would have been licking the bowl clean. We also ordered Caesar Salad for 10 bucks. It was pretty good but for that price, I thought we could have gotten more.

After going over the menu, we wanted to try the world famous Margherita Pizza. Here's the actual description from their very own menu:
*MARGHERITA 16
 (Limit of 73 Made Per Day) World Pizza Cup Winner Naples, Italy
 Dough Hand mixed using San Felice Flour, Proofed in Neapolitan Wood Boxes
 San Marzano Tomatoes, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Basil, EVOO and Sea Salt

As quickly as we were excited, our server told us the cold hard truth. THERE WAS NO MORE! :( 
So much for our excitement. It does say in limited to 73 per day. What a weird number. I think I will ask next time why.

In the mean time, we decided to go simple and ordered a Classic Thin Crust Pepperoni Pizza for 14 bucks. This was cooked in a gas brick oven for 550 degrees. This thin crust features tomato sauce, mozzarella, and pepperoni. Its so simple that its great.

As a side, I wanted to try their wood fired asparagus for 5  bucks. Now this was sheer disappointment. What they give you is like half of what you would get at the supermarket so the portion size was definitely lacking. As for the taste, well lets put it this way, any time you cook vegetables, especially grilling them, you just want to cook it just enough for it to be a little bit crispy still. In this case, it was limp and almost to the point that it was soggy. So yeah, it was overcooked.

Service was on point. We didn't need to ask for anything. Refills were constant and we were constantly checked up on.

The only negatives that stood out for me was the limp Asparagus and the music being played. I loved what they were playing but I thought the volume was a bit loud. I only bring this up because even though my wife sat across from me, after our first conversation after sitting down, we had to repeat just about every other word. As I looked around, it didn't seem like anybody else was being bothered by it so I just left it alone.

2753384,2014-08-04,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"my daughter came into town and i put her up at the D.  we hung around the fremont street experience and when she got hungry, i googled ""gluten free"" restaurants and lo and behold, pizza rock came up because of their gluten free selections.  and it was just around the corner so we could walk there.

we arrived and we loved the ambiance.  our greeter was friendly and the waiter was prompt.  we just missed the drink special by minutes and i was kinda disappointed the waiter didn't bend the rules for us as most restaurants have done in the past if we happen to make it just after the cut off time.  

my daughter was happy to see a vegetarian gluten free pizza so we ordered that one.  the waiter was very polite, but not exactly friendly.

our drinks were served promptly and we waited for the pizza while admiring the decor, including a huge truck cab next to our table.  there was a bit of a wait but we didn't mind as we were catching up with each other.  right about the time i had the thought that this was taking longer than it should, the waiter comes over and says that there was a problem with our order, and we could have a free appetizer while they cooked us up another pizza.  i thought that was very generous and we opted for the fried green beans.

OHMYGAWD!  these were AMAZING and i am drooling as i type this. seriously, if you like green beans, you have GOT to try these.

as we were happily crunching on these pieces of joy  in between occasional moans of absolute contentment, the manager or owner came over, introduced himself, apologized, asked us if we liked our green beans (which should have been obvious as our eyes were practically rolling in our heads) and then proceeded to tell us that the entire meal would be comped except our alcoholic drinks.

WOW!  we were happy to hear that, obviously. me especially as i had just spent a small fortune on having a great vegas time with my daughter!  and while we continued to wait, he kept us interested in his experience with micro brewed beers and gluten free beer much to the delight of my daughter, who is a connoisseur, and then he proceeded to tell us the interesting story of how pizza rock came to be.  our pizza finally arrived and he discreetly left, and once again my mouth waters as i type this.

i never thought i would be a fan of gluten free pizza but this was absolutely delicious.  and i come from chicago, where chicago style pizza is a delicacy.  

all in all, i am giving this place 5 stars because of the excellent food, and how a manager or owner took what could have been a negative experience and turned it into a fun and memorable evening out with my daughter.  that is a skill, and an art!  we will be back!",dq4MLIMiPDzfEuhxJ72U7A,0,0,5,GzxdO6V8WPbi9NVPlXyJNw

This is hands down the best pizza in the city of Las Vegas.  I noticed they will have another location soon in Henderson in Green Valley Ranch Casino. I will frequent both of these spots. The slices are NY quality, with the crust hard enough to fold at the crust...without the middle flopping back down to your plate.  There is no major oil runoff.  The cheese is not overflowing.  Toppings are fresh and delicious.  You're probably saying to yourself ""If he's saying how great the food is...why did he give it only 4 stars?"".  Here is why...

THE PRICES!! C'mon Pizza Rock!! I know you guys know you have a great product, so you're charging $4 for a slice of pizza?? $6 for a veggie slice?? That's absolutely bonkers and it makes me mad!! No reason why I should order 3 slices of pizza and a water...and it total $17!!! If you want to mimic a product from NYC, please go do some research and look at their pricing...because I'm sure that their store rental is more expensive than Vegas real estate...and they prosper just fine.

You have a great product, and its a great floor space.  Love the dark colors, the decor, and the friendly staff.  Hate those prices.",Cwkkowhq9MZue1Xyk57BMg,3,0,4,PifOMBr9TstCR-nLGQX44g

We ordered pizzas by the slice, and took them back to a table where we ordered alcohol from a waiter. The pizza was NY style, thin crust that held up to the gooey portion of cheese. We came in close to their closing time so the place wasn't very full and our waiter was super attentive with getting us drinks and water refills. Some of us definitely needed that water so it was much appreciated. Their pizza menu for full size pizzas is so extensive, you'll rarely find so many options.

Thin, New York, Sicilian, whatever... they'll have it plus different electric and wood ovens to boot. Their extensive menu can be overwhelming for those that are indecisive, like me. So, it's best to peruse the menu ahead of time or just let someone else order. The Cal Italia ($18) was the best pizza I tried with its rich flavors from the sweetness of the figs to the savoriness of the prociutto. I also enjoyed the quail egg white rose potato guanciale ($18) even though I'm typically not crazy about spicy foods. The Roma III ($32) is great if you're in the mood for an appetizer, entree, and dessert pie all in one. Although the middle section with the cream sauce and meatballs was the main standout for me. Not so impressive were the margherita ($16) and farmer's market (pumpkin puree, cinnamon, marshmallow). Our group even had room for dessert. The pecan turnover and apple calzone more than satisfied my sweet tooth. The mud pie, after chiseling away at it, was a letdown. It only succeeded in making me feel guilty for consuming all those calories. So, while dishes were hit or miss, there's enough promise to warrant a return visit.

Let me say the place is a lot larger then I thought with ton's of seating and a decent size bar. I decided to go with a tall boy can of PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) brown bagged and the $7 personal size pie. The pizza dough was chewy and a bit burnt on the bottom but never less it was good. The sauce though was lacking a bit sweet but bland and the cheese was ehhh ok. Topping on the pizza was really good I'll give credit where it is due.  I kinda felt maybe the personal size pie was a little bit on the cheaper end of quality and that it's not what I would say is the standard here so I would have to give the place another run around to see if it hits the spot with a larger pie. My first impression with the happy hour pie was basically not far off from Domino's. Spoiled growing up in New Jersey with pizza? maybe but for now I'm giving it 3 stars not the worst by far but not what I expected.

PIZZA ROCK, and boy did it!!! We ordered The New Yorker, excellent choice, our friends ordered the Downtown, another excellent choice!!! Different pizzas baked in different ovens, a totally unique taste!! The ricotta cheese on the New Yorker was a perfect compliment to the whole taste of the pizza! I made sure to smear it all over my piece:) mmmm mmmm mmmm

note... The New Yorker was mostly a meat pizza with in house homemade sausage..yummy

The Downtown was loaded with beautiful veggies and with homemade sausage also.

Both were fabulous! I must try on your trip to Vegas!!!",2gPQiilJeCDDwlMNHtA0Tg,0,0,4,sYQHon3OYQro3IsG__6VZw

In true Vegas fashion, this place has a lively and fun atmosphere, ample seating and today's featured soup: beer. I've come here a few times and some of the pizza were hits and some were misses, I wish I had taken better note of which of the pizzas I had already tried. One time my husband had us order the ""QUAIL EGG WHITE ROSE POTATO GUANCIALE"" and the mix of toppings completely killed my taste buds, and the crust had a very burnt flavor (not the good kind I've had on their other pizzas). I personally wanted a Pepperoni calzone that day and was really disappointed by what we ordered. We left the restaurant, went to Commonwealth, and on our way back to our car, I stopped inside Pizza Rock and ordered a slice of pepperoni from the to-go area and it was heaven! Their MARGHERITA 17 is another reliable favorite that has a subtle flavor and they advertise that they only make 73 per day. The staff here is usually on top of their game, very well-trained. One thing I love about this place is the DJ mixing music videos - because who doesn't want to see Chumbawumba being mixed into other 90's hits while eating delicious food?

We also tried Old Chicago, which was very thin crust with Tomato Sauce Mozzarella, Provolone, Sliced

2892998,2015-04-13,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"The pizza in Naples is so good because of the flavor imparted to the dough by the oven. On a molecular level this is the formation of carbon due to high temperature pyrolisis of the pizza dough surface. Some of this carbon remains in the oven and some of it adheres to the pizza dough. The carbon that remains in the oven over time is transformed into exotic and possibly undiscovered allotropes due to daily thermal cycles. These exotic carbons adhere to the pizza, providing its flavor. The pizza in Naples is so good because the carbon has had centuries to form unique and flavorful allotropes in the old ovens.

That said, one day the oven here will also be capable of producing the Naples carbon, and this pizza will then be truly amazing. However, at present the new oven, like new wine, is producing young and bitter carbon structures that have not yet reached full maturity. Until then, stick with the slices in the window which are on par with the best NYC pizzas.",RzqUH_ON22FVEpDWi2YkNg,0,0,1,BlSdZ_y9ADqbaKzuLAUMHg

2970616,2014-08-20,9,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"How deceiving is the decor in this place? 

Pizza Rock on the inside gives off the Guy Fieri/ Affliction look. Over-the-top designs and trying really hard to be the cool ""rock-n-roll"" type place to eat pizza. I didn't really notice that much ""rocking"" decor except for in the bathroom, where an airbrushed Jimi Hendrix face stares at you while you do your business. Don't forget the giant Semi Truck with killer flames on it placed in the middle of the restaurant. Nothing says, ""Rock-N-Roll"" like a truck with flames bro.  

That being said, the food here was actually very good. I arrived right before happy hour was ending and the bartender was cool enough to get in my food and double my beer order so I could get the happy hour prices. Great customer service move, plus she never rushed me and even gave pizza suggestions while I hungrily stared at the large menu. ""I'll have the Cal Italia Personal Pizza and the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA"". Mmmm, IPA. 

Along with my order, I also got a Caesar Salad which was pretty basic minus the anchovies laid on top, yikes! Not my idea of appetizing, but ""when in Rome"" or ""Pizza Rock"" do as they do?...Naw...these were promptly picked off and placed on the side. The salad was very large and could easily have been a meal all on it's own or shared. Crisp lettuce, shaved parmesan, and garlic croutons, great foodie starting point. The pizzaI I ordered, The Cal Italia, is an award winning pie according to their menu, in fact it's a Gold Medal Winner from the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge. How's that for a stamp of approval!

This pizza was very tasty from the three different types of cheeses, balsamic reduction, and sweet fig preserves. This crazy combination only got more delightful with the addition of thinly sliced Prosciutto di Parma, B-O-M-B. There were only four slices of this pizza, but I could have easily eaten eight. The beer just complimented my eating experience, thank goodness I had two in front of me. 

The Guy Fieri style decor might turn-off your hunger, but as the old saying goes, ""don't judge a book by its cover, only by how tasty its pages are"". I might have made that last part up.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,11,13,4,F_4iW7GoQRWhZS31KI-Cwg

We had the Artichoke pizza and the Margherita pizza, which we all thought was a little underwhelming. It wasn't a bad pizza by any means, but it wasn't considered great in our standards. Or perhaps my pizza standards are just way too high since I'm from New York?? 

Service was attentive enough and we were in and out pretty quickly. It filled us up without breaking the bank - plus they were able to split the bill into 4 cards, which was really helpful.

In the front of the down town location there is a pizza to go bar, where you can order by the slice. 
I live the cal italia, new 
Personally i love the calnitalia. New yorker and old chicago.

My only issue is that its a family-style type of eating, which was good for today since I was sharing with my hubby. If you plan on eating a slice or two, they have a take out window and bar at the entrance - You can have pizza by the slice that way. You can also go during happy hour and get a personal pizza of your choice. 

Service was good! Our server was really nice and helpful. They ran out of hard cider, which made me sad since I do not like taste of beer. He suggested I try the grapefruit ale. It was really good and a wonderful alternative. My husband loved the different beer choices and how knowledgeable the staff were on the lagers and ales. 

The ambiance is super classy and modern. This is more of a place to enjoy, sit, and drink - not to get drunk. I really appreciate that since it seems that in Vegas there are so many drunk people walking all over the place.

The menu was a little intimidating at first, since they have such a wide variety of pizza types, and each type shows what type of oven it is baked in and at what temperature. 

I selected the New York style pizza, and it was five star.....very fresh sauce seasoned to near perfection, superb crust, quality cheese. 

It's hip, in one sense, but more hip in a 1998 kind of way, but that's fine because this place is about the pizza and service.  I enjoyed the mostly 1990's soft alternative rock playing while I was there.

The service I had was also five star, and I got a 15% locals discount.

We went here on a weekend and the place was pretty packed. The host was attentive and seated us right away. I would describe this place as a bar kind of place rather than a restaurant. The music was loud. Trying to have a conversation it was a little bit of a challenge. 

We ordered the White Wine Clams for appetizers. It was so good! The garlicky sauce was perfect for dipping with their complimentary bread. We opted to get the classic Margherita Pizza. This too was excellent. The crust was perfectly charred which added to the great flavor of the pizza.

I've had the gluten free pizza, it's terrible, but to be fair, gluten free food blows. 

I've had a burger, it was only OK, again to be fair, it's a pizza joint and I couldn't ask them to make legit burger. The fries where good tho.

I've had a personal cheese pizza, but I was drunk and all I remember was my stomach ache the next morning. 

My latest visit was to watch game 1 of the NBA finals, a game in which this place showed, but didn't play the sound for, it was the game lebron was having cramps due to the a/c being broken in san antonio, but I didn't know that's what was happening, I thought something was seriously wrong with america's best current athlete. 

Regardless, that night a friend of mine and myself got 2 pizzas. The crispy Chicago thincrust w/pepperoni and a regular cheese, both were OK, but for the boasting and carrying on by this place puts out there and the ridiculously price, it was substandard pizza and I can't see myself every going back for a meal, unless someone else is treating. I've given this place too many chances. Also, my stomach was ruined for the next 2 days. 

I have a philosophy when it comes to pizza, if you do it right, you don't need all the bells and whistles. This place has an enormous menu, too many styles of pizza, I have a tip for pizza rock, get good at making one kind first, it's a clear over compensation. 

Finally, the people here are all very nice and they do have a $5, 32oz. pbr, which is only $3 dollars during happy hour, but with that said, they have destroyed the beautiful simplicity of good pizza and also the hopes of a great downtown pizza shop.",zWm22VdQMQQNZxRua5W51g,1,0,2,a8oKyEp6rHdLP1kHMXAXsQ

I have always heard good things, so we ventured in on a Saturday night. The entrance had an area you could order to go and apparently some slices? We didn't check it out much since we wanted to dine in. The wait was going to be about 15-20 according to the hostess, but it only took us about 10 minutes to get seated. I did go to the bathroom at that time and it was well maintained, which is always a good sign! 

They sat us in the room closest to the bar. The place had tons of TVs so it would be a great place to go on a game night. It is a very loud place, so i definitely had a hard time talking with my date over the small table. The prices all seemed very reasonable for the items listed. We went basic and got a pepperoni pizza, but they had all sorts of awesome creative and foodie type of pizzas preplanned on the menu. We just weren't feeling it this particular night to go fancy in flavor. The pizza fed the 2 of us perfectly (they come presized, so no picking larges or smalls). We liked the crust, but some of it was burnt so not as tasty. It was a little heavy on the grease for my stomach and what I'm used to. Our waitress was super prompt in the beginning, but did a classic fade out.....as soon as we started truly needing attention for refills, she became harder to find. We were done with our pizza in about 10 minutes but we stayed another 5 mins after waiting for the bill and another 5 or so waiting to get our credit card back. That's a pet peeve of mine. I'm done!

I love Pizza Rock!
I feel like shouting it from the highest rooftop in Vegas. 
But... apparently, one of my pet peeves showed up at my beloved Pizza Rock. For a couple of the employees...smiles must cost extra. Seriously, you say? Yes, I am sad to report that of the many times that I have been to Pizza Rock for a delicious slice of thin or think crust, there are employees that refuse to smile.
I work nearby, so when I discovered the pizza here was sold by the slice and it was only about $4 a slice, I was in carb heaven! I may have to go up a dress size, but my taste buds are not suffering at all. I enjoy every amazing bite. I preach about this pizza at work. I bring coworkers here, people I have only said hello to, people that I see in the breakroom at work. I say Go... eat at Pizza Rock. Brave the heat and take a walk down the block. It is worth a little sunburn on your nose. BUT, do not expect a smile. I give them the heads up. Close your eyes, look away and just point at the pizza. 
Unless Ryan is working. Ryan is awesome. He chats while making the pizzas and makes us feel comfortable and we have a few laughs with him. Ryan is cool. Others might need a smile seminar or something. Makes a difference managers... well, maybe in the case of Pizza Rock and myself, it doesn't. I will just not expect anything else but great pizza.

I really like variety when it comes to pizza, and Pizza Rock certainly has variety. The only problem with variety is that it can be a challenge to agree on a pizza when ordering for a group. They don't do half pizza which is unfortunate, but their pizzas are small enough to order a few for the table, though they can get expensive. A few coworkers and I came for lunch on a Tuesday and ordered the Fratellanza ($32). This is one of the only large pizzas they have (technically ""giant Sicilian style""). The pizza was indeed giant and is said to serve up to 5 people. Well, I had two slices and my two coworkers finished off the rest so if you're super hungry this could easily fill up 3 people. The slices came in a square shape with thick, slightly overcooked crust. It was simple pizza but great flavors. Could have used a few more mushrooms. I highly recommend this for anyone not knowing what to order because the others are a bit overwhelming. 

Pizza Rock has a great beer selection but the prices are steep. I ordered a weiss draft beer for $8.50 and my coworker got a bottled 12 oz Weihenstephaner for only slightly less. Even their local beers are around $7.50. Can't order very many of these at that price. I guess the only other thing that turns me off about Pizza Rock is the decor and theme. It feels really Hard Rock Cafe to me. Combined with the prices it makes me only want to come here on special occasions because it's more of an event or comparable to a Strip restaurant. The pizza is really good though and if I'm downtown and it's late I have been known to stop by their takeout counter.

UPDATED!!  8-10-14:  Changed review from 4 stars to 1.  Would give it zero if I could. Went last week with a party of four to have pizza and the pizza was the WORST I have EVER had; & being from Chicago, I fancy myself as a pizza expert. My usual, the Sam Giancanna, was TERRIBLE!  Ordered a large. It came out BURNED... Not just sort of crunchy, but BURNED!!! It was dry, black on the sides & bottom, burnt!! I said to the waitress,  ""you're serving THIS with pride??!!! Please serve us another as this pizza is terribly burnt"". She did, thankfully. But alas, the second pie was BURNED!!!!! AGAIN!!!!! Could  not believe it!!! We tried to eat a few slices, but left almost half the pizza. When asked if we wanted to box the rest, I declined, and was disgusted. I ALWAYS either finish the pie, or take the rest (GOOD pizza is even BETTER cold).  I didn't complain further, because why bother, knowing this was just a vulgar display of bad service and bad food. I can't believe this place is as trendy and busy as it is. TOURIST TRAP for sure.  In my first review, I discuss the bad bartender service. Here, the awful food. Just because you're in the now trendy downtown district, you shouldn't take it for granted that you might have discerning customers!!!!!!!   Your pizza is indeed like eating PIZZA ROCK.  JUST LOOK AT the pictures customers are posting!!!!!!! 99% of them ALL THE CRUST HAS A LOT OF BLACK, BURNT edges. THAT IS NOT CHICAGO, or good pizza people!!!!!!!  That is BURNT PIZZA that is dry & overcooked!!!!!!  Hellloooooooo.  Being a newer restaurant, doesn't give you card Blanche to rip people off. And THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING, RIPPING PEOPLE OFF!

Started off with some appetizers
-Calamari, spicy and original, fried to perfection with a spicy aioli and marinara sauce. One of my favorite things from dinner, loved how spicy the calamari and aioli was. Yummmmm
-Fried artichoke, never been a huge fan of artichokes but not bad. 
-Meatballs, not a huge fan of ground beef either, but I devour these in one bite.  

Now moving on to the main attraction aka love of my life...pizza.
-New Yorker, oh em gee this was amazing! So cheesy and the pepperoni with sausage was a wonderful pairing. The ricotta cheese was a game changer. 
-Margherita pizza, yes please with extra basil. 
Dessert
-Mud Pie, perfect amount of sweetness and chocolate with a drizzle of caramel.  

Loved the trucker truck inside the main dining room and loved the sanitary foot door handle in the restroom. I am such a germaphobe, little things like this make me so happy.

After walking in, we were barely greeted by the two girls chatting at the hostess stand. I asked to see a menu and was given a dirty one, I handed it back to her and asked for a clean one. She looked at me as if she had something to say then said alright let me look. The second menu she handed me was satisfactory.

After sitting down it took about 15 min for our waitress to come over. As soon as she comes over I ordered the Gorgonzola apple salad, and the honey pie. The salad was very mediocre; the pizza was tasty but had a few flaws. The main flaw being the fried onion strings on top of the pizza. They were unnecessary, made the pizza greasier, and took away from the other great ingredients. Fried onions have no place on a pizza!",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,1,0,3,r4ckAeapXb_b8R0EZPBunA

They had gone the day before and absolutely had to go back ( that says tons in itself). We were not drinking so we had Las Vegas Coolers which were refreshing and not overwhelmingly sweet. We decided on the New Yorker and the Frank Nitti. The Nitti has thin crispy crust with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. The spinach had good flavor and texture. The ricotta was the perfect touch. The way it was baked was perfect! The ingredients were balanced to let you taste everything on the pizza and not focus on one ingredient particularly. The New Yorker lived up to its name. The crust was a little thicker and had a great consistency. What stuck me was the sausage. Such a distinct fresh flavor!!! Amazing... The sauce to cheese ratio was perfect. The meats were all delicious and generous throughout the pie. Come here tell your friends to come here!!!

We walked in sat eve. No greeting, no hello, no smile, just a blank face ""how many?"" I said there was going to be 4 for dinner. I was told it would be a 30-40 min wait and I was fine with that since it is Saturday. Our friends en route told us they were 3 instead of 2 so I told the hostess that we were going to be 5.

It's been a while since I visited Fremont St and we were very impressed with the improvements in the area.  

Pizza Rock has some incredible food.  Meatballs were delicious.  The saut√©ed Green Beans made for a great starter as well.

We ordered several pizzas and all were delicious.  My favorite was the Margherita which they only make 73/day!!  We were lucky to get one of those and it was so good.  So good that you crave for it when you get home!!

The restaurant preaches to ""Respect the Craft"".   The staff and the chefs here clearly do more than toss pizza dough.  Pizza Rock is hands down the best pizza restaurant in the city!",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,0,0,5,X79_pHm7_a2hAKXE4scHyQ

They actually stick the slices of pizzas back into the oven for a bit then give it to you. After we put cheese and peppers on it, it was actually one of the best pizza slices I have ever had.

When you first walk in they have a section you can walk up to and order pizza or whatever they have there from the front or you can ask to sit down.

The place itself is very nice and really feels like a place built to feel like a rock house

The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the menu. The menu is made out of old record holders and the happy hour/specials are on the record itself they give you (printer on). It's a really cool concept but the menu seems so cluttered and unorganized. Change the design and that will help


We got a pepperoni and ground beef pizza (see pictures) it was worth the money for it (we paid 26 after our drinks and stuff I think it was like 18 for the 12"" American original pizza)

The Sauce was actually good and the fresh bake of the pizza in the wood oven really brings out the flavor.

3291022,2016-07-11,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I came to Pizza Rock on a Sunday with 2 friends for brunch. Unfortunately, our experience there was disappointing.

The restaurant is located in downtown Las Vegas and you should be ready to expect some traffic on your way there on the freeway. There are a few parking structures around the restaurant but you will need to pay for them (Update: I have been told that Pizza Rock offers free validated parking at the parking garage across the street at 3rd and Ogden. Ask about it people!).

Service was disappointing and extremely slow and the food was rather good but expensive and you would expect better quality for the price you pay. We all had the bottomless mimosas for $15 and I had the Mob Boss pizza for $32. 

The main problem was that the food took over 45 minutes to get to our table and my pizza was cold by the time my friends got their food. The free appetizer we received unfortunately did not warm up my pizza even though it was a nice gesture. Finally, our waiter was also very slow to refill our mimosas since we had to wait over 20 minutes on several occasions with an empty glass despite several requests, telling us that ""he had other tables as well..."". A little rude maybe?

In the end, I would not recommend this place mainly because of service issues. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",JR7AYVUJ1_Nq36UBW3XHYw,4,1,2,6u84J5HsWS-aBdStIfQtCA

The server was very quick to make sure we knew that the pizza was thin and chewy and you'd have to use two hands to pick up a piece.  He also mentioned that because it's cooked over wood, it will be slightly charred.
What we received was so far from an award winning pizza we were speechless.  The char was overwhelming and overpowered any other flavors that were part of the dough, sauce or toppings.
When we let our server know that we weren't happy, the situation was handled extremely well.  The server loooked at the pizza and then smelled the pizza and let us know that there was definitely something wrong with the pizza that we were served.  They brought a second pizza (this time we had the New Yorker) and it was pretty good.  The manager went as far as to bring us a 2nd Margherita pizza so we could see what the pizza was supposed to taste like.  It was still overcharred on one side but we could defintely taste the flavors.  To be honest, I still wasn't impressed with this pizza.
While we ended up not having to pay for our meal (which I thought was very nice and it was unexpected on our end) I thought the prices were high for a pizza joint.  So while the staff and management definitely recovered nicely from their error, in the end I just don't see what all the hype is about.",mofmCos6HegKPXopOLz9EQ,6,1,2,AOx9YPnEYmKtw5QJRMA3BA

They are known for their margherita pizza which is supposedly award winning and its kind of cool because they only make a limited number of those pies per day.

We were hungry, so we ordered the Gorgonzola fries and the two different calamari's for appetizers, The original and calabrese style. The Gorgonzola fries were to die for, they were crispy but had such a strong taste of the cheese sauce on it, very flavorful and delicious! The original calamari was good, they only gave one small little lemon wedge for all that calamari, so that bugged me. The calabrese calamari was super spicy, so don't Oder this unless you like heat. The aioli sauce and marinara that it came with were also really good. For the pizza, I had to try the award winning Margherita pizza and we ordered the QUAIL EGG WHITE ROSE POTATO GUANCIALE. The Margherita pizza came out first and Looked really good. I tried the crust first, very good crust on outer edges. So I picked up the slice to eat and it was so limp and soggy it just falls. You have to eat it folded or you can't bite into it. So one complaint is that the crust toward the middle of pizza is soggy and wet. The sauce was a bit tart for my taste. All in all it was okay, but I wouldn't order again. Then the quail egg white rose potato guanciale came and it looked good once again. But, WOW, TOO SPICY! I didn't see any potato on it and the server said they grate it because they use the 900 degree oven and it cooks in 3 minutes and unless you grate the potato very fine it would remain raw. So basically you can't even taste potato on it, I didn't know or see if it had pork cheek on it. The chorizo is what you see and taste and it is too overpowering. That's all I tasted. Lastly we ordered the tiramisu, that was one of the best tiramisu's i've ever had! I wanna go back and try different pizza's next time. I can tell they do good food here, I think that I just ordered the wrong pizza's for me. Also for two appetizers , two 12 -inch pizza's , two soft drinks and one tiramisu, our check came to over $70!

This makes the quality stand out above all other places I've tried. The pepperoni and sausage are home made and of course the sauce. The pizza crust is crunchy yet chewy; essentially perfect.

The first time we went on a whim of mine at midnight and the VJay was playing all my favorite 80's and 90's cuts on the big screens adorning the room.

Aside from the fact that it's nestled in downtown Las Vegas, where all the strangest people are about, this place was pretty damn good. We ordered Gorgonzola fries and spicy calamari to start. The sauce on the fries was out of this world. The spicy calamari was just that...spicy. Be prepared. But still pretty good. 

For Pizza: we ordered ""The Butcher"" and ""Ned Itty"" (possibly the correct name). The Butcher was honestly, just average. But the Ned was excellent. Garlicky. Spinach. Ricotta. Very very good. 

Environment: meh, sub par. It was a mix of a diner and those old pizza places you would go to as a kid. For $20+ a pie, they could have classed this place up just a wee bit. Also, as I usually will mention, it was loud. Loud music and loud people. Be prepared!

So on a last minute decision I ended up going to Vegas this past weekend and stayed at the Main Street Hotel which is a different review altogether.

Based on the location of my stay going to the Strip was just not that easy to do so ended up walking Fremont and getting some stuff there...

So after walking down and getting a beer or two, ended up at Pizza Rock on everyone's recommendation around there.

Ordered a pizza and the meatballs...couldn't have chosen a better appetizer and a meal. The server was awesome and the selection of beers was just as good.

The meatza was cut in squares, which makes it easier to handle. The meatballs were saucy but I needed a little more and it was glorious. I will definitely try to make it again to Pizza Rock if I happen to be in Vegas.

I highly recommend this location, try to go there before you fill yourself with all the other delicious foods in Vegas!",yw_CG3Fj0a74-y70I0e5SA,3,0,5,q21w4i2YFHslb-k1-Tk2rg

Had the Cal Italia pizza. I enjoyed the offbeat sweet/tangy/salty take on traditional pizza. This pizza is for the curious and adventurous. It was good, and I'm glad I tried it but now it's checked off the list, I wouldn't order this as my standard.

Some at out table were into just plain old good pizza, so we also ordered the Chicago Crisp Michigan Ave. It was well received. The thin crust was great!

The service was off. They were changing shifts, so our server introduced the new server. Then we never saw him again until we hunted him down for the check. The first server kept serving us until that point, so it was just weird. I could kind of tell she was supposed to be off work by that point because our service went from awesome when we were sat, to not so awesome after she introduced our new server and then he never came back. So, yeah, disorganized would be a good word for it.

One thing I loved? The MUSIC!

We got the pepperoni pizza. My friend that I went with visited the place several times and mentioned that it wasn't the same pepperoni pizza he gets. Regardless, I thought it was great!

I went for a single slice because their ""personal pizza"" was for/during happy hour.  So I went with what was available and tried the Veggie Pizza.  I love ""supreme"" type pizza's and I wanted to add pepperoni to it, but I couldn't.  It was sold ""as is"".  

I took it back to my office, and I'm sure if I ate it there, it would be hot and taste fresh.  I took a bite of it, and thought, ""oh just like any other"" thin crust pizza.  But then I took another bite and started enjoying it even more.  I was sad at the end, because I went back in the box hoping another piece would magically appear.  I'm the type that likes veggie pizza and crunchy crust pizzas so, this pizza fit my likings very well.

I really wanted to order calamari as well, but didn't know if I'd have time to wait for it and still have time to get back to my office in time.  So I'll eventually one day come back to try other things or at least come back to try their happy hour. I do think they are a little pricey.  :\

We came just in time for Happy Hour (M-F 3pm-6pm) and they had such great deals! I can't remember the prices exactly but they were very reasonable especially for the quality and quantity of food that you get! 

Classic meatballs - who doesn't want juicy and hot balls made in house? ;) Delicious and fresh, if you're a fan of meatballs, you should try these.
Truffle Italian fries - large portion and you can definitely taste the yummy truffle!
Calamari - also large portion and comes with aioli and marina sauces
Cal Italia pizza - OMG. I was very hesitant to order this since I wasn't that hungry and usually don't like pizzas without tomato sauce but since it's deemed a ""Gold Medal Winner"" of the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge, I knew I HAD to try it.  So nobody wanted to share this personal size pizza so we pretty much all ordered our own and let me tell you, i'M SO GLAD I DID. The ingredients were so unique, I never thought a combination of prosciuttio, fig (and I don't even LIKE fig) and balsamic reduction could taste SO good.  I was too full to finish it at the restaurant, so I took my leftovers home and heated it up the next day in the toaster oven and it was still DELICIOUS. AS. EVER. 
Tiramisu - served in a martini glass, it was delicious, light and fluffy! I usually don't love tiramisu but the cake was so soft and fluffy, my spoon kept going back for more.

I would highly recommend coming here for happy hour (I believe they have late night happy hour from 10pm-close as well, just call and ask) or coming here for a meal. Their menu is filled with plenty of delicious and unique pizza and pasta options so if you're an Italian lover, you must come. The restaurant is pretty big so it's great for large groups and there's also bar seating. Lots of TVs = good place to keep men entertained while you chow down lol. It feels like a chain restaurant but DO NOT be fooled, their food is beyond and very worthy. Make sure you check it out and you MUST. GET.

3454418,2014-04-22,5,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"On my last visit to Pizza Rock, I knew I had to bump my rating up to 5-Stars.There's a reason why this restaurant receives plenty of accolades: their pizzas, as well as their other menu items, are bomb. 

Salad - Pancetta & Arugula: The crispiness of the pancetta reminds me of Bacos, but you know, better. There's tons of arugula, so if you like the green stuff then eat up! As for me, it was too bitter and I don't have an acquired taste for it. I would've enjoyed the salad more if it was mixed with other greens. But don't get me wrong, it was solid. Their Gorgonzola and Apple salad is a little sweeter, and I prefer it over this one. 

Pizza - Picante: Having a penchant for spicy foods, the Picante's a pie that made me perspire a bit from its serrano, banana, and calabrese peppers --- If you order this, make the server's job a little easier by requesting that he or she leave a pitcher of water on the table. Oh, before I forget, the crust is perfect. It's not too thin, not too thick, and it has a delightful crunch.

Other eats - For appetizers, try the Calamari Fritti and the Moretti Battered Fried Artichokes. As for pizzas, The Cal Italia remains one of my favorites, but their Romana pizza is divided into three sections and offers different topping combinations.

Other - I haven't seen this place packed beyond maximum occupancy, but it does get busy. Go ahead and make a reservation anyway.

Service - Great.

Overall - It'll be hard eating anywhere else in Downtown, knowing that Pizza Rock is nearby. But if I have to eat elsewhere, I'll be fantasizing about Pizza Rock.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,10,7,5,rWCxi9cMmRsKRY8fY3x0Tw

The menu is amazing; different pizzas and crusts, prepared in different ovens at different temperatures with different cooking fuels.  And the pizzas themselves and the toppings.  The bar has a great selection of draft beers too.

I've read what some others have said about ""burned"" pizza; but they explain that it's a cooking technique.  TRUST ME, TRY IT and you'll enjoy it.  It's one of their signature pizzas and they flash cook them in an oven for just about 5 minutes.  It was great!  After going in December, we back in February for the ""Kids in the Kitchen"" program held every Saturday.  It fills up fast, so you need to call early.  It was a great morning.  We got to tour the kitchen, throw dough up in the air (yes, they let the parents play along too!) and then we got to make our own pizzas under the guidance of one of the cooks.  Then they cook it and you get to enjoy your creation!  They also let us sample a few other treats on the menu.  There's a pizza with honey, sweet onions and other sweet toppings (it's NOT a dessert pizza though).  I never would have ordered it, but when they offered me a slice I tried it.  It was great!  The whole place is fun and you'll have a difficult time even picking out your pizza.  Just be prepared that the music is a bit loud; but what do you expect given the name.

The guy behind the counter, Auggie, was kicking some butt and the line was moving fast. He was taking the orders and food was being served like a well-oiled machine!!

Monica ordered a slice of pepperoni and i got a slice of the picante with a soda. We sat at the bar to enjoy our pizza. The pizza was grub!! Not burnt or greasy, just delicious!!

As we enjoyed our chow, we couldn't help but notice how Auggie was handling the orders, crowd and always remained courteous and professional. Please and thank you were words often heard said by Auggie. He also made sure our sodas were never empty. 

Now days, customer service is lacking in so many businesses. It would be so easy to expect a pizza joint to have a guy behind the counter that doesn't give a damn about much other than his paycheck. Auggie is the absolute 180!

We stuck to the classic half pep half cheese and that blew our taste buds away the others must be Amazing and cannot wait to come back to try the rest! I would drive all the way here from Centennial to get this pizza... It's that good! 

They have thick and thin pizza! 

The sauce is so flavorful, you can taste the time that went into this. The cheese bubbly, fresh, hot! The dough crispy yummy! Sooooooooo good! 

Service is great and detailed! 

Gelato is a perfect sweet ending to this flavorful meal!  

We will be back and will be spreading the word!",b7ppmK1yIvK5vx5IcdE-3g,1,1,5,Ym00701cRwxt8EUpNFxOGA

Needless to say, they've been sitting us with 2 little kids on a bar table. We did not enjoy that. I must say, regular tables were still available. We were not asked if we are ok with that. As soon we sat down, I'm looking at those small plates sitting on our table, 2 stets of 4, the top ones were dirty, but that was not all, litterly every single plate of those 8 were dirty. Either we still had the ones from the previous customers sitting there for us to use, or they just do a darn bad job in cleaning them. 
The waiter promised a real Italien pizza, ok heard that a lot of times in this town. 
Pizza comes out and the dissapointed to is huge.
Way to soggy in the middle and the whole pizza has way to much pizza sauce on it.
I know how a pizza has to be, I learned in Italy and been in Europe for 33 years.

3509604,2014-04-06,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"The western U.S. wrote the book on terrible pizza, but Pizza Rock is an exception to that rule. The overall dining experience here is 5 stars - especially in comparison to other Las Vegas ""pizza"" locations. But there are a few issues keeping this place from truly rocking it, as it were.

Most importantly, Pizza Rock's menu needs serious help. Someone at this restaurant needs to understand the menu, as presented, is way out of bounds when it comes to pizza menus. With pretty much any real pizza joint, you typically have your crust options followed by your topping options, and a few ""specialty"" pies, and that's it. Short, sweet, simple.

Pizza Rock, in an effort to break the mold (which I always encourage) prints a large and very clunky menu that takes forEVER to read. Although it is loosely broken down by pizza styles, each pizza (and there are MANY) has its own custom toppings. Between the styles, names, awards, and ingredients, it is a daunting read. It's like hey you can get this Italian pizza with 12 cheeses, a half pineapple and five rabbits' feet or this next pizza that won the South Central Tracey Bonham award in 1998 and it comes with four butchered gnomes and an upside-down piano on it. 

The point is, ASK THE SERVER. I was so sick of reading I just requested whatever Pizza Rock's version of a large New York style pizza where it goes crust, tomato sauce, then cheese. And, wouldn't you know it, the pizza tasted great!

The other issue is the restrooms. Terrible! No water pressure, no paper towels, AND you had to pull the door inward to leave (which means touching the handle everyone else who didn't not have water or paper towels just touched, and dreading picking up your next slice of pizza.

Pizza places MUST have clean bathrooms. The fact that so many reviewers don't seem to mind really gives you an idea of Yelp's demographic.",x0WpY0u5PqIeBqP9MaLfqA,1,1,4,B2Ci5CJMPXwnTlp94CUbbw

To the left of that is the hostess stand and dining area. The line was short on one visit and longer on the next. They really move the line through nicely. They have some stools at the counter to the right of the register where you order, but it's a tight space and there isn't a lot of seating. I just plan on popping in and grabbing my slices to-go when I come here. I like that they offer the typical cheese ($4) and pepperoni ($4.50) slices as well as a different ""slice of the day"" ($6) each day. The slices are huge. You can't beat the price, portion or quality. I tried some Sicilian cheese and it wasn't bad, but could have been more crispy on the bottom instead of being a tad too soggy. I'd still give it another try during another visit. 

They offer a variety of pizzas baked at a variety of temperatures here at Pizza Rock. I plan of trying most of them. The menu says only 73 of pizza champ Tony's award winning margherita pizzas are made per day. There are actually other pizzas that are made in limited amounts each day, but the margherita is a favorite. I'd call ahead if you are interested in any of the limited batch pizzas. Unless you are meeting a group of people here I'd just call your order in anyway for pick-up to avoid the parking hassles of downtown and have someone drop you off to grab your order.

My favorite pizza by far is the Sausage and Stout pizza -- it was introduced around St. Patrick's Day last March and hadn't been printed on the menu the last time I was in (mid-July) - but I'm hoping it has now.  Absolutely amazing.

My next fave is the Honey Pie - it's the perfect combination of sweet and hot with a mixture of honey and peppers...really good if you like a little kick in your mouth after a bite.

My friends ordered the Tomato Pie on our last visit (not being as adventurous for spice as I am) and it was also great -- very traditionally Italian tasting.

I've also had the mac & cheese, fried green beans and garlic bread on other visits...so I can highly recommend those.  I wish I could recommend other items, but I love the above three so much that they're all I can ever bring myself to order!

As we took-in the only worthwhile site (The Freemont Experience light-show), we saw a glowing sign slightly in the distance ... Pizza Rock. With a name like that, we were SOLD!

The walk over was filled with phrases like ""Watch your back!"" and ""Keep your wallet in your FRONT pocket!"" but when we arrived, this place was a black oasis in a pretty dumpy area! 

The interior is GORGEOUS! Matte black walls with glossy black designs. It is literally walls to ceiling black ... and PHENOMENAL! There are little coves with curtains and chandeliers for parties of two ... super neat!!! Needless to say, the music is ACTUAL rock ... none of this rap/hip-hop dreck that seems to fill all of Vegas.

The Margherita- this was brought out first. The San Marzanos tomatoes make this pizza so tasty. The dough is soft and and cooked in perfectly. Defiantly reminds me of Italy!

Classic Italian style- decided on the Prosciutto and Pomodorini. This was my favorite of the two. The fresh arugula and the cherry tomatoes adding some acidity. Also this dough had more of a crisp to it. amazing!

It's been a few months since we've dined at Pizza Rock, and since we were playing tourist on Fremont Street, we thought we'd take a little detour to get a slice since we still had complimentary vouchers to use from a Yelp event a few months back.

We originally lined up outside by the walk up window, but were later directed inside by one of the pizza guys since there were a bunch of seats open at the counter.
The voucher allowed us to get any slice from the menu above the oven-Cheese, Pepperoni, Picante, Slice of the Day, Vegetarian, or Purple Potato were the choices at the time.

Never had Peruvian Purple Potato on a pizza before, but I'm glad I went with a slice. It also came with Pancetta, Feta Cheese, Rosemary, and Pesto. Each flavorful bite was delicious, and the crust was crisp with a nice chewiness to it, just the way I like it, and I'd definitely come back for this! Yes, I'm still a fan, and thank goodness we don't have to deal with massive wait times for a table like the Chef Tony's Napoletana in SF.  ALOHA!!!

- The coccoli fried dough was warm and delicious (if not healthy) served with a generous cup full of burrata and surprisingly tender prosciutto. 
- I didn't like the wood-fired asparagus as much. The veggies were fine, but the quail egg on top was small and over cooked. Maybe quail eggs are a fancier ingredient, but it didn't provide the runny, yolky goodness that I wanted. 
- The family-size house salad was great for sharing, plenty of crisp greens and a good dressing on the side. 
- B and I split the Artichoke Joe pizza- mozzarella, artichokes, spinach, garlic, parmigiano cream, provolone, pepper, and the secret ingredient.... LEMON! It was so delicious I didn't want it to end. I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to put lemon on a pizza, but brilliant move!

Is it weird to be in love with pizza and is it considered cheating? 

There are so many things to love about your pizza let me count the ways. 

1. You can have up to eight different styles of pizza at a time.

2. The Cal Italia and the Diavola will have you at the first bite. 

3. Calamari is sooo good and they have a spicy Calamari option. Seriously why doesn't everyone do this?!

4. The service, music, and atmosphere are all great. 

5. Tony Gemigani has so many Pizza related accolades it's ridiculous but seriously he is the U.S ambassador of Neapolitan style Pizza and has won multiple contests and awards for his mad skills.

*caprese salad- 5/5 stars the grape tomatoes were so fresh they tasted like they had picked them right off the vine out back!! the mozzerella was fresh and had a wonderful smooth texture, the olives added a nice flavor and the bal vin dressing was subtle and oh-so-good!!

*calamari fritti (half spicy half reg)- 5/5 stars
although im not a huge calamari fan, i couldnt stop eating the spicy calamari!! it was fresh, fried perfectly crisp n it gave such a good kick! yes, im a sucker for the heat!!! came with both marinara and aioli sauce.  

now for the pizza!! we got:

*the butcher- which is a thin crust pizza with ALL the meat basically :) the flavor of 
this pizza is incomparable to any other pizza ive ever had, it was BOMB!! ... and thats coming from a self proclaimed 'pizza expert' who prefers no meat on my pizza (the occasional pepperoni being the only acception) but seriously.  yes... so much YES.

so, yes we had a great experience, yes we walked out tummies full and smiles on our faces and yes we will def be back for more!!!

We ended up having more people, but the staff graciously smiled and just added more chairs.  Everyone's food was good, service was OUTSTANDING, and everything went great.  Every one of our servers and food runners were attentive, fun, and polite.  About 95% of our guests were first time visitors to Pizza Rock and were impressed with the food, environment, and service.

Thank you Pizza Rock for making the end of our wedding such a fun and easy event.   All of our guests really enjoyed the service and meal and plan on being repeat customers.

3708470,2016-07-12,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"After reading about the Moms Eat Free deal on Monday, I figured this would be the perfect place to go for a family dinner. The deal is that a mom's entree is free for up to $20 when a family member also buys an entree, so my family took advantage of this and we were able to save about $33, which was awesome. For our dinner, we ordered 2 appetizers, the clams and asparagus, and 3 pizzas: the New Yorker, St. Anthony, and Cal Italia.

   Both the apps were pretty good. The clams were cooked well and we liked the asparagus, but they were both fairly expensive. While the asparagus was wrapped in proscuitto and topped with a quail egg, the proscuitto didn't have that much flavor and the quail egg just seemed like a small egg. I liked the apps, but I probably wouldn't order them again due to the price.

   However, as the name suggests, you come here for the pizza, and this was unquestionably the best pizza I've ever had. The crust was incredible: thin, crispy, and slightly chewy without being too heavy. Of the three, our favorite pizza was the New Yorker, which was huge, super thin, and topped with fennel sausage, pepperoni, and ricotta. The meaty slices of sausage were bursting with juice and flavor, and the pepperoni was nice and crispy. And the cool, creamy dollops of ricotta were so good, the perfect complement to the hot savory pizza. 

The St. Anthony was also fantastic and topped with fennel sausage, italian sausage, roasted peppers, 2 runny eggs, ricotta, and red pepper oil. The italian sausage was juicy, had some heat, and a really nice sweetness to it as well. The heat from the peppers and pepper oil added a fantastic hot flavor and necessitated the cool creaminess of the ricotta.

Lastly, while we preferred the more savory pizzas, the Cal Italia was still pretty tasty. It just tasted more like a dessert pizza because of the sweetness from the fig preserve and balsamic reduction.

   All in all, I recommend this place to anyone who is craving insanely good gourmet pizza. The only drawback is that the pizzas are somewhat pricey, but this can easily be accounted for if you go with your mom on a Monday.",rGdqwZViTrUKFPi74SToiQ,0,0,5,6XI9uZEgX54sIcdStN_PEw

Upon walking in there's actually a to-go spot. So if you're in the mood to grab & go you have that option here as well! Pizza is about the same price, though my boyfriend thought slices were larger at the to-go joint.. 
Ambiance was great! Super relaxed and they played a ton of classic rock/alternative songs. The killers, Muse, Motion city soundtrack (random I know). Pretty large restaurant with plenty of booths and tables set. The bar was large & had awesome happy hour specials. Cheap PBR's whoooo! 
As for the food it was super yummmm! Started off with an appetizer, we tried the garlic fries. Perfectly fried to a crisp & the garlic powder/ cheese on top were finger licking good. We ordered the New Yorker pizza... pretty darn good. I myself am more of a deep disher but my boyfriend likes the NY thin crust. Not bad I must say! Very generous on the toppings & the waiter was super prompt.

3728249,2018-06-23,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"So my friend and I decided to check out Pizza Rock located on 3rd street let me tell you my experience..

Well this place rocks! (Pun not intended) lol Huge outside sign you can't miss it! Pizza Rock is on a corner of a small yet beautiful street , the face lift of downtown is amazing so far. Parking is quite hard to find and it's paid parking I think it's like 2 dollars for 2 hours but it's downtown it's like that everywhere over here. Well let's go inside shall we ? 

So I've been reading the past reviews about their hostess being super unfriendly well I guess the management corrected that real quick. We were quickly greeted with big smiles and were sat almost immediately. Good job guys . The inside surprisingly gets bigger the more you walk in .Beautiful  rock and roll theme with a modern flair and of course with the music to match! The servers were nice,drinks came out fast, and staff was knowledgeable about the menu . The menu is a little hard to read, way to dark and since there's a lot of items it can get confusing . Well Let's eat shall we! 

I came in during happy hour . So I ordered a personal pizza for 7 dollars called tony 2 times basically a meat lovers pizza . It was delicious nice char on the bottom of the pizza super good crust and the cheese stretch sealed the deal for me . My friend ordered the pesto paradise which is a thin crust pizza I didn't get to try it but she finished her pizza before me so I'm guessing it was good ? Lol 
My daughter got a personal pizza and since it was only one topping it was 5 dollars that stretchy cheese made it fun for her to eat . Last we got the garlic and rosemary fries which were soo good especially at the bottom where all the garlic and rosemary is at sooo good ! Kinda wish they had a ketchup bottle for the tables however . 

This place is super trendy, kid friendly with a kids menu . Good music and equipped with a nice bar for adult drinks . A cool place to take pictures and just hangout . I most definitely recommend this restaurant GO GO GO !!",2V_oIMdrPBsq5u8rXACG2A,0,0,5,LyeUJ00uGHREQTZBmjjVdA

3758476,2013-12-30,4,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I'm a huge fan of Tony Gemingani so it was only a matter of time, with me being a frequent visitor to Vegas, that I would visit Pizza Rock over in Downtown Vegas. 

The menu is virtually the same from Tony's Pizza Napolitana in SF.  It includes his famous award winning Margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from NY Style, Romana, California Style, and Gluten-Free.  And it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  Don't forget to check out his burgers too.

Same menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional Italian restaurant look from Tony's in SF, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for Vegas actually.  That being said, the pizza is really top notch.  And although I've been to Tony's in SF a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that I still haven't tried.  My friends and I decided on their Cal Italia and the Honey Pie.

Cal Italia -- http://bit.ly/1bGfTSF
Gold Medal Winner - Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge
Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, 
Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction 
Although I've been to Tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning Cal Italia.  It's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  Very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  I really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time I come back to either here or at Tony's in SF.

Honey Pie -- http://bit.ly/1kBVpvu
Quail Hollow Farm Honey, Calabrese Peppers, Green Onions, Mozzarella, Piave Cheese, 
Fried Caramelized Onions, Serrano Peppers
I've had this pie before at Tony's in SF and I ordered it again to share with my friends in Vegas so they can try it for the first time.  It's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  If you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a Chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that I can compare this pizza to.  Although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  But for some reason, I wasn't tasting the honey.

One honorable mention I recommend from is their Burrata Burger.  I didn't have this at Pizza Rock but I've had it at Tony's in SF.  I think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  You get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (http://bit.ly/1ePXy9t). Definitely worth trying out!  

I think what I like best is that the wait time at Pizza Rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in SF where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  Though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  It looks like Pizza Rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, I can see it doing very well in Downtown Vegas.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,8,4,4,IbQW0BVu7KvZSfM9UMMBsA

As I mentioned in the first review, we brought the kids along. They loved it. They loved the truck. Loved, that they were allowed to write on the paper table cloth. Loved the pizza.

I asked the 8 eight year old if she had fun and she said ""Yup"". Asked if she wants to go back. ""Yes."" Was her answer.

Then I asked my 6 year old the same questions. She nodded her head ""yes"" when asked if she liked it. She was chewing up some pizza crust. Return? The six year old wants to go there on her birthday!

When we arrived, we checked in for Yelp. We then received a discount which saved us a few extra bucks for gas money. Nothing wrong with that! Too bad the Mayor, Carolyn Goodman wasn't there this time.  Kids would have gone bonkers.

Since this restaurant had a 1-1/2 hour wait, we decided to get slices of pizza to go and hunt down a place with frozen drinks. We waited 30 mins for pizza by the slice. I got the Vegi pizza and my friend the pepperoni pizza. My friend indicated it was the best pizza she has ever had. Not sure how mine's could tasted...read on....It had potential..really it did!!!
I was disappointment by the staff behind the counter. We were getting it to go and they had flimsy plates to carry it out on. After seeing a huge pile of to go boxes that another of the staff had made up, the man helping us said he had NO boxes... ""Really."" I said. ""Then what is that behind you."" Reluctantly, he put my friend's pizza in a box, but not mines. He said he could not give any more boxes away. WHAT?! 
 I was really bummed I had to carry it outside with the pizza slice lopping over the side of the flimsy plate. I lost half my toppings on the ground. I ended up folding my plate in half to keeping the remaining topping from falling off. I bet this pizza was good, but I will never know to what extent it was good. But hey, after we found the margaritas and enjoyed the concert all was good!

I know their restaurant is excellent. I will be back to eat there on the next concert outing!

However, staff behind the To Go counter needs to be schooled in the art of customer service and the To Go counter should have better quality plates to hold up their awesome pizza. Come on Pizza Rock...you can do it! Rock on!",__O_vpFaO1E3Ham_pnB0VA,1,0,4,6iIDWK4ftkHUKfu404BeIQ

3819995,2016-06-21,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"There are now two things that Las Vegas has completely ruined for me: Hainanese Chicken Rice and pizza. 

I'm not a big pizza head. I don't generally crave it, don't gotta have it, rarely even think of it as food. But when I want pizza, I usually want Chicago deep dish. Which I did that one evening in Las Vegas. And as luck would have it, I happened by Pizza Rock after the introduction of the Detroit Red Top. 

We stopped by on a Saturday evening and the line was out the door, for both the restaurant and at the counter where you can buy individual slices. The wait for a table was going to be an hour. But don't despair and don't give up! Just push on in and find the huge bar that has open seating all around. You'll find a spot there. It may take a few minutes, but this isn't the sort of place where people hog spaces at the bar if there are others waiting. Nice crowd!

The place is loud, so you do have to yell a bit to be heard or to get a bartender's attention. It's all worth it though when you finally sink your teeth into that crispy, cheese-baked-into-the-crust Detroit Red Top. Lots of interesting beers on draft, including Not Your Father's Root Beer, which was my first encounter with an alcoholic root beer. The decor was very modern rock and roll and you could see what I thought was The Pizza Oven from the bar. Turns out, that was only a pizza oven. This place does something I've not encountered--they have different ovens for different styles of pizza. Totally makes sense! The pies are huge, so we didn't get to anything other than the red top, but I'd come back here in a heartbeat. In fact, this place even makes me crave pizza.",CI0MxhxvVbhSgouy_z-ztw,2,0,5,xmMqvkl_6-UhRL7sR9Ww_g

Went here before a night of bar hoping.  We ordered the Picante pizza and a Romana that included the parmesan/proscuitto/arugula section, the nutella/apple/walnut section, and the sausauge(?) and some other meat that i can't think of section.  We already ordered the regular calamari and the spicy calamari.  The picante lived up to it's name!  But it was so delicious.  It included chorizo, cholula hot sauce, jalapenos, and pepperchinis.  Highly recommend it if you like spicy food.  The 2nd pizza was amazing and really big.  All 3 sections were so good.  Great crust and great combination of toppings.  My favorite though had to be the calamari!  I love calamari but not every restaurant that carries it should serve it.  Pizza Rock calamari rocks!

The service was fast, efficient and friendly.  Our server took the time to explain the different pizza options (yes there are tons: New York, Chicago, California, Italian, Flatbread, Focaccia, etc).  Also, the decor and ambience was very fitting of the downtown area.  They actually have the cab of a Peterbuilt big rig in their restaurant and looks pretty cool.  It would look cooler if it were painted like Optimus Prime, but that's just my geek opinion.

One thing: I do wish they would put the dividers back in to the little alcoves on the side of the room with the curtains.

Goal was to try one pizza from each of the ovens.

NAPOLETANA - 900 DEGREE WOOD STEFANO FERRARA. We went with the MARGHERITA. This was pretty standard, nothing stood out, I felt it was served a bit cold as well, although Michael made a good point, it couldn't been from the photo ops.

PIZZA ROMANA - ELECTRIC BRICK OVEN 700 DEGREES. We chose the ROMANA III. It's 3 pizzas in 1. 1/3 was Gorgonzola, Dates & Pecans, Apples, Honey, Nutella (this was my favorite) 1/3 was Sweet Fig Preserves, Prosciutto, Gorgonzola, Balsamic Reduction (this was my second favorite) and the other portion was Ricotta, Garlic, Basil, Linguisa, Piquante Peppers. This was a nice option if you have lots of people in your party, you can a piece of each.

CLASSIC ITALIAN - GAS BRICK OVEN 650 DEGREES. We chose the CAL ITALIA. This was the Gold Medal winner on the Food Network, and the winner for Jaime W and I. I liked how all the ingredients came together.

CALIFORNIA - 900 DEGREE WOOD FIRE OVEN. We chose the QUAIL EGG WHITE ROSE POTATO GUANCIALE. This had a kick, spicy! This was my least favorite of the pizzas, not a fan of eggs on my pizza, but at least I can say I gave it a try. 

We then sampled the Farmers Market pizza, weekly special using ingredients from Downtown Farmers Market, this week it was pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, bacon and topped with dollops of marshmallow. Didn't really do anything for me. 

Dessert, yes we still had room for dessert. Mud Pie, Pecan Turnover and Desert Calzone. Nothing really excited me. It was all pretty standard. 

Overall, I wasn't in love with this place. Nothing was that spectacular that would make me drive to Downtown and attempt to find parking. Save this place for the tourists.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,15,11,3,B9J2VT0XFkIYK0fsec7KQw
3870369,2016-09-07,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Went with my family and parents. We got the Detroit pizza and the New Yorker. Overall wasn't bad. The New Yorker had a bit too much sauce and not enough cheese. The pepperoni, although tasting good, is the kind that curls up when it's cooked, a sign of a cheap product. The Detroit was good. Nothing special though. My daughter and son are allergic to cheese so we got them a pie with just sauce, pepperoni, and bacon. According to my daughter it was the best cheese-less pizza she has ever had. 
The atmosphere was questionable. It was a Saturday night around 8 when we got there. It was crowded which is a good sign. Lots of TVs  that had the college games on. My big complaint was the music. It was bumping so loud that we couldn't even talk to each other without having to scream across the table. Not cool. It was like night club loud. Then around 9 o'clock, they turned the game off and put music videos on. Music was still just as loud. That was a big let down. 
Overall, it's a good place to try out. The pizza is WAY overpriced for the product which is average at best, but given the location, it's about exploiting the tourists.

3876004,2014-08-14,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"This is now my second run-in with pizza made (or rather associated with) Tony Gemignani. He's well known in San Francisco for being a world pizza champion and owner of Tony's Pizza Napoletana. My first experience consisted of a long wait, which was all I could recall. I guess the pizza was less than memorable. 

A local B-list celebrity chef opening a spruced up rock-themed pizza joint in Vegas? Why do I have a feeling this is a setup for failure. It's just a feeling. First, the good. I like the concept of offering different styles of pizza made from different oven types. They are very temperature specific ranging from the hottest wood-fired oven, an electric brick oven, and down to a gas brick oven. The Cal Italia, made from the latter oven was a winner for me. It was also crowned the winner of the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge. The crust was perfect - lightly crispy on top with a mostly chewy consistency. The sweet fig preserve and balsamic reduction paired with the prosciutto and parmigiano-reggiano was a home run. 

The bad. The menu is way too large. I tried the burrata burger, which was awfully salty with the bacon mixed into the patty. I could barely taste any of the burrata due to the over seasoning. The meatballs and truffle fries were average.

The ugly. The margherita, the supposed World Pizza Cup winner, was burnt to the point where we had to ask the waitress to return it. I know my pizza and the occasional blistering of the crust, but this was beyond that. It was black all around as well as burnt black flour underneath. All I could taste was the bitterness of the charred crust and of regret. A wood fire pizza cannot sit in a 900 degree oven very long. The saving grace was a very apologetic and helpful waitress. 

I like the large space and the fact that there's a big rig in the middle of the restaurant, but the atmosphere cannot entice me to return. For a city that prides itself on offering free parking in most places, the downtown parking situation was abysmal. Street parking was minimal and most of the offerings around Pizza Rock were at one of the local hotels that offered valet (free only with validation). Oh, I also happened to use the restroom before leaving and witnessed a guy vomiting and retching profusely in the stall next to me. To be fair, I cannot say if it was from the food or the alcohol.

In more than one word: dry, short on flavor, unbalanced, and the bun was a touch stale.

They show the video that goes along with the music. Ordered a plain pepperoni pizza that says it feeds six but its more like 6 grown men!!! It was only a pepperoni but it was the perfect amount of grease to cheese to sauce ration. It melted in my mouth. Also had the spicy fries calamari which I absolutley loved!

We started with an order of three meatballs.  They were very good and the tomato sauce was great.  I took the serving spoon and ate some of the leftover sauce like soup.

For our main course, we opted to split a Stromboli. We got the Romano's Original 1950.  It had cheeses, pepperoni, sausage, and sweet peppers.  The crust was thin which is a plus but the interior was missing some filling.  The sausage and pepperoni was meager.  There was a lot of cheese inside and the Stromboli was good.

We were pressed for time.  Our server, Shani, knowing this, brought our check before we were done so paying and getting to our show was easy.  In fact, we arrived at the show 15 minutes early.

A big criticism I have is the LOUD, LOUD music.  At 6:15, they cranked up the volume to just one decibel under now you have to shout to be heard.  Is this really necessary?  When I checked their website, I got the same blast of music and I learned to mute my computer before looking at their site.  Too bad we didn't have a volume control at the table.

I may be back, but if I do return, it will be at an earlier hour when they have lower music--I hope.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,15,10,3,-ItpO8BuucZFS_Y3KvRmxA

All the pizzas are great but the best are either the Slices up front or get the same pizza in the restaurant called the Old New York 22"", if you're sharing. If you get the individual slices they are BIG so have them heat it up order a beverage or take your slice to the bar and order your drink up there.

The cheese was thin crust and maybe the winner of the night for just a solid, good, perfectly cooked pie! The Sicilian was very good as well, with a good deep dish dough and miniature pepperonis! You can get a large variety of pizza styles here ranging from Chicago deep dish, to New York thin crust, and more creative gourmet styles! My one knock on this place is that it is way over priced! In Vegas where there are a few great pizza joints, with Vegas style prices, this place definitely hits the high mark with our three pies and sodas topping the $100 plateau!

All bad.

So we asked them to exchange them for the Coconut Cooler and the Pomegranate Margarita. Both were much better thank god.

I ordered a Margarita Pizza, which is one of my favorites types of pizza when done right. What I got was a serious disappointment. 

You couldn't even taste the basil, nor did it have olive oil drizzled over the top like it should and the amount of fresh mozzarella was lacking  and there was no fresh sliced tomatoes layered on top.

Meant to take pictures of the pizza, but was so excited when it arrived we started eating and realized it was too late. hahaha....

The ginger beer is the REAL stuff, like with ginger floating in it. Really good if you like ginger beer...

The foccacia bread is worth the extra couple of dollars, especially when you're hungry but don't want to overdue it before the REAL pizza gets there...

The first visit was at about 11pm on a Wednesday night after a few hours taking in the public spectacle that is the Freemont Street Experience.  We were looking for something quick and easy. That is precisely what we got. They sell by the slice all day, but at that point in the evening, you get what you get & you don't throw a fit.   But what we got was a nice thin crust with plenty of yummy toppings.  
Our second visit was a dinner party with approximately 35 people. There were multiple pizzas ordered, so I tried three. The pizza that stood out for me is their Cal Italia (I now know this is a gold medal winner on The Food Network pizza challenge). Oh my!!  If you go - you MUST try a slice of this one.
Only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating is because the service for our big group was a bit lack luster. We waited too long for drinks & refill. The food, however, is 5-stars all the way.",QJ9WEmbfivkycSCGWHrvzw,0,0,4,VlyWW_JpOhMRWjcDDhJC3w

This is located next to the Freemont Street Experience, so be wary of the terrible parking, especially on the weekends. We came inside and were instantly hit with the smell of delicious pizza and music playing the background (which can be too loud for people with sensitive ears). Very fun atmosphere. In the front you could order pizza by the slice on the right, or get seated in the big seating area to the left.

We were immediately seated! Our waiter was very attentive. After reading that there were 2 award winning pizzas, we had to try them out!

Margherita pizza ($17) - 5/5: This was the World Pizza Cup Winner in Naples, Italy and only 73 are made in one day. We were lucky enough to get one, and it was so delicious! The crust was baked just right and the toppings were not overbearing and blended perfectly well with each other.

Cal Italia ($19) - 5/5: This is the winner of the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge and I wouldn't doubt it! It has Asiago, mozzarella, imported Gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and balsamic reduction. It was quite possibly one of the best pizzas I've ever tasted. It was sweet, but had a great tang to it. I'm salivating as I'm writing this review! It's definitely a must try when coming here.

If you're in DTLV, you HAVE to come here. This has the title of the Best of Las Vegas for a reason!",Nv3PWqYZ47GQuG0p8u4uQg,3,1,5,gshK64eTR9h4ESJT5KWUlw

I've been here numerous times over the past few years and have always walked away full and satisfied.  I've been with both larger and smaller groups and the staff is always accommodating and attentive.  If you plan on going on a weekend night, I would definitely recommend making a reservation to avoid a wait.  They have a decent beer selection and they make a good moscow mule ($11) too.  On the weekends this place can get a little loud with the music (sometimes they have live music too) and is loud just with the sheer amount of customers coming through so just be aware of that.      
 
Top Favorite Dishes:
-The New Yorker ($25) - 16"" crust, your basic pepperoni and sausage pizza amped up, comes with three different types of cheeses, the ricotta cheese adds a sweetness to the pizza that surprisingly works well with the other ingredients, I get filled up on 1-2 slices so I usually share this with one other person
-Classic Meatballs (6 for $9) - covered with marinara sauce in a balsamic vinegar reduction, great starter to kick off the meal
 
I've also had the Americano Pizza ($21) which was decent but too much toppings for me personally.  The La Regina ($32) is also really good but I don't usually get it because it is quite large and feeds 3-5 people alone.

Also, the ranch is SO GOOD. I could drink it.  I actually have at times.... don't judge me. I love ranch and I love it more on my pizza.

During Sunday brunch Pizza Rock is offers unlimited mimosas for $10.00 per person when a brunch entree is ordered. I opted for a Belgium Blond beer which paired great with the Cali pizza which consists of quail eggs and pork cheek.

The area that this restaurant is in seems fairly safe, but keep an eye out just to be on the safe side. 

Prices were a bit high, so we decided to split the Detroit Red Top ($27).  

Our pizza was somewhat similar to a deep dish, the restaurant describes it as:
""Square Style Pizza Cooked in Steel Pans from Detroit, Wisconsin Brick Cheese, Mozzarella, White Cheddar,Tomato Sauce, Pecorino Romano, Oregano, Garlic, Butter Toasted Corners""

This pizza is quite heavy, but it was extremely fresh and tasty.  We thoroughly enjoyed it. 

The restaurant states that the pizza can feed 2-4 people, I would say that is accurate.  We left with 1/4 of our pizza in a takeout container.  This would probably be a great pizza for 3-4 people to split with salads or an appetizer.

What's cool is you can have different styles of pizza cooked in different ovens, 900, 750 and 550 degree.  I had a 900 degree pie, which they sell as authentic Italian, that wasn't so good, the server removed it without a hassle. Which was awesome, the fact it's a 900 wood cooked pizza , it should have had some  charring with a varying degree of soupiness in the center.  however the line between charred and burnt is very fine.

For an appetizer please please try the spicy honey sausage thing they have on the menu!  It literally is the most delicious thing!  Since we drive to Vegas we stop here and get sausage to go and put it in the ice chest.  Problem is, it doesn't last when we get home.  It's amazing!  

We also have had the Caesar salad and split the small one to add greens!  It's very tasting dressing!

Our first encounter was a group of us ordering pizza by the slice at the entrance since the restaurant itself was closed (late night). It won us over for sure!

Our second trip here we came for dinner and got to sit in the restaurant this time around. Very nicely decorated inside, tables galore! Bar is in the back of the restaurant surrounded by televisions everywhere. Bathroom was nice too.

The service was great, we wanted to customize our pizza order a bit so our server pointed us in the right direction as to the type of pizza we were looking for so that it didn't cost us an arm and a leg. She was prompt at filling drinks as well!

We were already sold on the Classic Pepperoni pizza from our first visit so we ordered that, the Boss 32 and the Classic Meatballs (a must try, the sauce is delicious)! Everything came out so fresh and hot! I thought it was cool that they carry 2 sized of bottled Coke. :)

Some of their pizzas can get pricey but if you stick to the basics, it'll be fine!

Great pizza joint! The classic pepperoni reminds me of pizza back home on the east coast! Give it a try!",05CNyGQyXIiwXII2nciV6g,0,0,5,o6BzC4BSG6NYi5XL_aHSOA

And I only convinced him with the bribery of pizza. I? want to move down there. I? wanted to go to the Downtown Grand. So Pizza Rock was miles ahead in my book. 

Place: Great location! ample space between tables. FABulous Fat girl seating. and nice little 2 person curtained booths for 'date night' oh and the giant ""peterbuilt truck"" is a full on WIN. *it's their dj booth* - Win & 5 *****

Service: We went on a Sunday, no reservation and at 4pm - Football time. No wait at all. We got right in. Got our drinks ordered (more on those later) then we got a new server. Nice guy, lousy waiter. I hope he's a dancer or an actor because waiting tables, he'll starve. Slow service, never came back to follow up, we had to actually go to the bar to order a 2nd round of drinks. there were only 4 other tables in the place though 1 was a party of 6. however we were all by each other. so sorry but only 2 **

Food: We had the truffle fries: Excellent! not too truffly to overwhelm. We went with the classic Pepperoni x-cheese & sauce: perfection - Just like my favorite NYC brick oven pizza. The right amount of crust to topping ratio. Not a tough dough, just a good chew. We want to go back to try some of their specialties like the   SPACCA NAPOLI or the Picante. Tiramisu: just the right amount of soaked ladyfingers to alcohol. 5****

Drinks: We were excited to see bacon bloody Marys on the menu. *if you follow me, you know i'm the queen of bloody Marys in Vegas* so of course we ordered 2. Nicely garnished with a very nice hearty piece of perfectly cooked bacon (not some floppy end under cooked piece* and a seasoned rim. Then we tested it. heavy aftertaste in the bloody Mary mix. Not nearly as good as even Mrs. T which is pretty inferior. But I finished mine & my son's. He wanted a shot & by then I'd had 2 might as well go for a 3rd, eh? we waited. and waited. & someone took the 'dead soldiers' we asked for our waiter. and waited. and waited. finally I (after 2 bloody marys) went to the bar to order. He brought them over without even questioning why i had ordered them from the bar. 2 ** 

Bill: 
3 bloody marys & 1 shot  & 1 soda. 
1 classic pepperoni 
2 split appetizer 
1 dessert 
AND 
1 additional pepperoni to go for dinner tonight *yum* 

62.50.  this was with a 15% local discount and an additional 5% for checking into their facebook page.  that's another 5*****

4196905,2014-07-31,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"This is definitely not a typical pizza place- if you just want a plain traditional pizza, go somewhere else.  So far I've tried three different pizzas, and each one is better than the next.  

Must try:
~Honey Pie- savory pizza with honey on it- trust me!
~Romana III Pizza- this one is a mix of a proscuitto and tomato, ground beef, and NUTELLA- all on a different third of the pizza.  The ingredients don't touch, so don't be grossed out.  The Nutella/Gorgonzola is life altering good.  You have to ask for extra nutella on it. 
~Salumi and Formaggio Board- you can build your own sandwich. 

Good but not amazing:
~Caesar salad- comes with whole anchovies on top, and kind of pricey considering it's just a caesar salad.
~Meatball appetizer- skip it and just save room for the honey pie. 

Other: Sometimes does Groupon deals, and no more valet parking in front.  You can park in the Grand's garage that's kitty corner, and they validate parking.",eD2YmdHwXmns0fI9NEOByQ,0,0,5,WhLX8O09Q9yJ8DPmO9swww

I ordered a pizza over the phone to be picked up 20 minutes later. I arrived on time and saw there was a huge line at the pick-up/ order by the slice area. 

I waited in line for an additional 15 minutes which wasn't great but not too bad either. The reason I'm giving three stars is I noticed the two cooks weren't exactly careful in regards to cleanliness. I don't blame either one at all; it seems like a management issue. The cooks were making the pizzas, taking the orders, and accepting payments. It annoyed me to see two hostesses just standing at the register looking super bored and super unhelpful. If they see these two are slammed, why not help out and take orders/ payments while the cooks actually cook? 

All I could think about was how many germs were on my pizza. The cook was all over the place in that tiny work station and just touching everything including the register. I paid $27 for one pizza; I'd like the cleanliness to reflect that. Even Little Cheeser's keeps cooks/ cashiers separate.",-MKgxmSxXjHcoycYt0NWJQ,1,0,3,IxkZ8yrJMfAu7r68QV0gCg

4225547,2018-04-04,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I have to say that I LOVE Pizza Rock; this was my first visit to the downtown location but I had visited the Green Valley Ranch location on multiple occasions.  You absolutely must try this place if you like pizza, calzones, traditional Italian food, salads, burgers, or sandwiches.  Our group tried almost all of those categories and nobody was disappointed!

Positives
1) This location is right downtown off 3rd street and very close to Fremont Street.  Outdoor dining options available and the main dining room inside is expansive with a nice bar near the rear.  TVs line every wall and you could watch essentially any sporting event during your visit.
2) Menu is incredible and diverse!  I highly recommend the Truffle Italian Fries, Fried Green Beans, Garlic Bread, and Calamari Fritti for your appetizers, all were exceptional!
3) Pizza menu is epic and wide ranging.  The Margherita Pizza is an absolute MUST!  Their menu says they only make 73 of these a day; don't pass up the opportunity to try it.  We also had ""The Butcher"" pizza which was essentially a meat lover style pizza that was fantastic, and we had a ""Detroit Red Top"", can't miss with either!  This location also has a place up front to buy pizza by the slice!  Awesome...
4) Their sandwiches were also great; our party had a meatball sub and Italian trio sub.  No complaints here!
5) A wide selection of draft beers and cocktail menu.

Negatives
1) Parking is limited and will almost certainly require parking at a nearby casino if you cannot find street or adjacent parking.  Plan ahead and drop off your party and have the driver find parking.
2) For Pizza the pricing is a tad on the high side but I think well worth it.  Just know going in that it is not going to be lower end pricing.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,1,0,5,32hS91dZ_t8jwe_WooFH_Q

Not quite sure where the best place to park is for free parking. I ended up going to the Binion's garage (free 3 hour parking with validation). It's just a short walk away (1 block).

A Sunday brunch stroll in was welcoming. Not too busy, friendly staff. We decided to start off with the Salumi & Formaggio Board and a Margherita pizza, which apparently is a signature pizza they're proud of. Ended the meal with a tiramisu dessert.

Salumi & Formaggio Board: Assorted meats and cheeses, candied walnuts, focaccia toast and fig jam. I enjoyed this. One of the lighter options to start off your meal.

Margherita pizza: The pizza was quite tasty. You can tell they used some great ingredients in this. Split between 2 people, this pizza satisfied us, but it's not a heavy pizza. The ravenous might want to go for one of the heftier pizza options.

Tiramisu: Really tasty and creamy, served in a glass. Not a huge dessert, but makes for a good closing. 

All in all, a great experience here. One thing I noticed on the way out is that they have weekly specials that use ingredients purchased at the Downtown 3rd Farmers Market. I'm going to have to give those a try on my next go around.

4242088,2017-08-16,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Our visit got off to a rough start.  I called to make reservations because we were coming with 5 adults and 2 babies in strollers.  We knew the strollers are sometimes an issue due to spacing of the tables, which was the main reason we called ahead.  The girl I spoke with put me on hold to check with someone about space for strollers and confirmed that they had a table for us that would have more than enough room.  

Fast forward to our reservation time.  I check in at 6:25 for our 6:30 reservation and was told it would just be a minute.  We wait and wait and wait.  15 min has gone by, and we see other people walk in and get seated right away.  I go up to ask how much longer our wait would be and the girl who I originally checked in with asks - ""do you have a reservation?""  Are you kidding?! I already told you we did 15 min ago!  We have been sitting and waiting this whole time right in front of you!  I tell her - yes, 5 adults and 2 strollers for a 6:30 reservation.  She says there's no tables that can accommodate strollers, her reservations just says 5 adults and 2 babies.  What?!  Apparently she assumed they would be sitting in high chairs not strollers.  I explained that we called ahead specifically about the strollers.  Instead of apologizing for the mixup, she rudely tries to show me her iPad to prove she's right and her reservation doesn't specify strollers.  I believe you, the person taking the reservation screwed up...fine! But what are you going to do to make this right? By now we have been waiting 20 min past our reservation.

She tells us we can sit at a tall bar top table.  With the strollers?  That doesn't work.  We see multiple long empty tables, but we're told they're reserved for other reservations.  Finally she walks away...presumably she was tired of dealing with us.  So we find who we believe to be the manager and he finally finds us a table.  

Look, I get it.  This probably wasn't the best place to bring 2 babies in strollers. We know that now. But we were visiting from out of town and didn't realize the vibe of this place.  But the fact that we called ahead to make specific reservations, then be treated so rudely by the girl at the front desk with long black curly hair is unacceptable.  I wish I had gotten her name, but I didn't.  The only reason we didn't leave right then and there was it was a Saturday night and we probably wouldn't find another restaurant with a short wait time, and we were hungry! 

Our waiter was just ok service wise.  The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 was because we enjoyed the food.  The artichoke appetizer was delicious, as were the pizzas we got (I believe it was the St Anthony and Stout pizzas).  

Would we come back? Hell no!!  The pizzas were good, the service was HORRENDOUS.  Not worth the trouble in my opinion.",A6YI_CxrOw8piqqymbQlZQ,1,0,2,8oIu8cAJ8qDTJ_cJFyXOMQ

Now on to the food. We had to order a pizza, obviously. We ordered a Sicilian style Peperoni pizza with the thicker crust and it was perfect. Cooked just right with plenty of cheese and serves up to 5 people! We had 4 in our party and had so much left over so I think it could prob feed more depending on how many slices each one has. Our server wasn't too bad. But, she wasn't the greatest either. There was times that our salad plates were left on our table a little too long and we couldn't fit the pizza and the other plates so kind of annoying.

But, other than that, I loved this place! Great vibe and great for the downtown area (right next to Fremont Street). Definitely recommend.

The salad was a salad, nothing special to report. I've ordered lots of charcuterie and cheese boards before and let me tell you the portions of prosciutto, cheeses, and salami were huge!

4261579,2014-05-28,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I have been to this place 3 times...twice on a pub crawl and once for dinner (using a groupon deal). 

For the pub crawls, the moment you walk in, the smell is just absolutely amazing. Even if I wasn't hungry, it made me want to chow on some pizza. For the pub crawls, they have a great selection of beers on tap and the service at the bar is fast and they are friendly. 

 I love a quality pizza so I was happy to actually try it out. The deal included a beer, a pizza, and an appetizer. For our app, we tried out the calamari. It was quite a generous portion and they let us split it half and half, so we tried the traditional and the calabrese style. The calabrese style was very spicy! Enjoyed the app but the container for the marinara dipping sauce was far too small and not enough to go around. As far as for our pie, we decided on the Romana II and it is such a cool concept to have a pizza that is 3 in 1! That can sometimes be the challenge of trying to decide on a pizza. Especially because menu and the types of pizzas can also be a tad overwhelming when making a choice. The pizza was a thin crust style and it was delicious. I was happy to eat leftovers for two days! 

My reason for giving it 4 stars, dropping it down one for the service of one of the waitresses. She seemed to be judgey about my beer choice when she dropped off my beer. It's not like I had ordered bud light, sweetheart, it was still a craft beer and from a brewery I had never heard of. Then when some people walked in and took a table while the hostess was away from the desk, she copped a major attitude. If your hostess happens to not be there and someone walks in a grabs a table, be cool about it. No need to throw your hostess under the bus and complain to the patrons. It just leaves a bad taste in people's mouth and is completely unnecessary. I will say that the waitress that actually served us was very helpful and nice.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,1,1,4,fJZqTTcyT_tA_7p8f_cpJQ

4293799,2015-01-26,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I was pretty shocked by our experience here this past weekend... I mean, this place is almost at 5 stars after 600 reviews! You would think even on an off night they're pretty amazing. But alas, it was very disappointing and if I go back, I would only do it on a relatively quiet weekday night.

We were there for a friends 30th birthday, and the group was about 15 people. There were a few other groups larger than us, and perhaps that was the reason that things were so chaotic. Our server was stressed and unfriendly, but hey...I've been there. I know it's terrible to be stretched so thin you can't even breathe, but at some point the disorganization got pretty comical.

Drinks and food were brought out randomly with people yelling out what it was and people having to raise their hand. This was funny because it was a long table, and it was LOUD in there, and I happen to be sitting on the end where the servers were coming from. Seemingly none of the servers knew where anything was going. All night, from drinks to extra silverware to pizza, people would just come out and yell something... and more than likely not get a quick response because nobody could hear them. A bunch of times it wasn't even supposed to be for our table. So service, not great.

But all bad service can be redeemed by good food. Like I said, I know what it's like to be swamped as a server, so unless you're a complete bitch, then whatever. We're here for the food. However, we got ""The Ogden"" pizza, and it was just plain bad. It seemed undercooked, and the flavors just didn't come together at all. Perhaps it was rushed, but it wasn't crispy at all and it was rather oily. Unfortunately, the birthday girl and many others felt the same about their pizzas...it was just alright.

The prices weren't the worst, but they weren't cheap either. Because of the reviews and the higher than normal prices, I guess I expected too much. Even so, restaurants with this high of a rating still manage to blow me away, so I don't know what happened last night. Go back on a weekend night? Never. 

I may try it again for lunch or something, but I just didn't even get a glimpse of what the fuss was about.",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,2,0,2,BtWWXM-ogvRnw-9YqObKnQ

We were a bit inebriated in DTLV, and wanted to find some food to sober up. I was craving pizza, and Pizza Rock was only two blocks away.

There are two parts to the restaurant, a pizza by the slice counter and a more traditional type of restaurant that has a sports bar type of feel. We initially were seated in the restaurant, but changed our minds as our intention was just to get a quick bite to eat and be on our way.  We decided to give the pizza by the slice counter a try.  I kept it simple and just ordered a couple of slices of pepperoni. They were huge! Very filling and also very tasty.  One of the staff also hooked us up with an order of meatballs! They were outstanding, and sealed the deal that I have to come back here again.

We stopped in a lunch for a quick slice at walk counter.  He slice was huge and also was very reasonably priced considering most food in Vegas is now on the higher end. The slice was less than what we would pay at a Mall type slice walk up counter.  And oh goodness was it good.  My husband ventured on the purple potato and lived it (which is surprising because he is usually a meat lovers type guy).  I had the pepperoni and it was delicious.  The slice held us over from our breakfast donut (at the nearby The Donut Bar - go there too!) until our fairly late night dinner at...Pizza Rock.  

So after a full day of gambling and just a few drinks we stopped back in around 10pm for dinner.  It was great to find they had a late night happy hour menu.  Again with the happy hour aspect it was a great value.  We got more pizza and ordered one order of meatballs right off the bat.  So the truth is the meatballs came out just slightly warm.  They should have been hotter.  But after tasting them there was no way we could refrain from eating them all before the waitress came back by for us to even mention the temp issue.  By the time she came around (which wasn't long by the way) we had eaten them and our only complaint was that we needed more (and yes we ordered another order of them!!!!).  The sauce on them is so so so good.  My husband said he could put the sauce on a cup and just drink it it is that good.  Do not leave this place without getting the meatballs.  And seriously that's saying a lot as I am typically not a big meatball fan.  

Our service was awesome and there was a personal touch as it turned out that our server was from a nearby town in our home state.  We were in and out quickly, and our drink cups were always full.  Great service.

What I did like about the establishment was the friendly staff, extensive pizza selections, and the fact they played old music videos on one of the many television screens.

What did not work and the reason for 2 stars is that we were very clear with the waitress that we could not have fontina cheese on the pizza because my dining partner was allergic.

Located in the Downtown Fremont scene, this pizza joint is a great addition to the downtown scene. The ATMOSPHERE inside is dimly lit, TVs scattered around the restaurant, with just enough class and sophistication to go with the wonderful smells of the vegetarian, prosciutto and ricotta pizzas that our table had ordered.

Tonight I attended my boyfriend's holiday work party. We had a separate room and the SERVICE was great. Constantly checked on by the staff, waters were always refilled and the servers made sure that we had everything we needed on hand. I wish I remembered their names, but all three were welcoming enough.

I believe we had a prefixed menu for our holiday party FOOD, and seriously? It was sooo yummy! Even the appetizers. We started off with Caesar salads, meatballs and sauteed green beans. Being pescatarian, I had to pass on the meatballs but I heard they were quite filling and savory. Our entrees included four different types of pizzas: prosciutto, ricotta, vegetarian pan pizza and a meat pan pizza. I only tried the vegetarian pan pizza, which was enough for me. The vegetarian was cheesy and crunchy on the top and edges, layered on a fluffy tomato-saucy bread. I loved the pan pizza. It was so fluffy (and filling), I probably could have eaten half and used the rest as a pillow to sleep it off into a pizza oblivion. The slices were large portions and I was only able to eat two. 

For dessert, we had apple empanadas served with vanilla bean ice cream, and some sort of chocolate ice cream mousse cake thing. Not quite sure what it was exactly, but it was a sweet ending to the meal and hit the right notes. Rock on! Now I really could have slept on the fluffy pillowy pizza at this point. Pricing, I believe ranges from $6+ per slice. For the overall experience, I would say it's worth it.

We sat within 5 minutes and had drinks in less than 10. Extensive craft beer menu including Joseph James (local to NV). Pizza comes in various styles - we ordered a New York Style and a Napoletana. Being both from New York and Neopolitan, I can tell you with confidence these were the real deal (it got my 76 year old dads seal of approval too).  Waiter was super Friday and attentive, and appreciative of our compliments. He even gave us recommendations for other good eats in the area.

First off, the pizza was amazing. I got the veggie. It wasn't overly greasy, overly cheesy, etc. They didn't overdo on the crust...the crust was relatively thin. Toppings were really fresh with huge baby tomatoes and spinach. Big slice as well!

Inside of the restaurant is pretty cool. It's classy, but rock n roll at the same time. 

I love the 18-wheeler DJ booth. I have to say, the DJ kicked ass! He was playing a good mix of 90's hip hop, new wave, 90's grunge...it was perfect. However, it was a tad bit loud. I thought it was cool that instead of just music, they play music videos and throw in old SNL skits. We were highly entertained. 

We ordered:
* Classic meatballs
* Woodfired asparagus
* Fried green beans

Everything was super flavorful and cooked with fresh garlic. It was all quality...like some little Italian mom had just made it. Everything tasted so fresh!

Service was super fast and the waitress was no fuss no muss. She was busy, but made a point to get us everything really quickly.

We were ""dough eyed"" patrons hoping for a real NYC pizza experience and boy did we get it! The counter and pizza window were a great entry into the really nice restaurant area. The staff seemed friendly enough.
We ordered 2 pepperoni and sausage slices that just seemed right. The slices were huge and had that wonderful authentic pizza aroma with not a lot of grease. The crust was thin yet chewy and held up to being picked up and eaten. The cheese held on and didn't slide off with a bite, the sauce was the right amount and fresh. Toppings were spread on evenly and the pepperoni had the crispy edges. We watched him make another pizza and carefully distributed the toppings evenly across while telling us the secret to their great pizza...semolina flour and imported Italian tomatoes.

We went on a Friday night so they were pretty busy. I went with a group of 8 and we were seated in less than 10 minutes.

I would have preferred them coming out at the same time. Our pizza was ginormous and SO good though that it was well worth the wait. 

Pizza Rock has a great atmosphere too! They had this large random front end of a truck in the restaurant and there was a DJ in the driver's seat playing music all night. He was playing some great throwbacks so we were very entertained while waiting for our pizza. 

I checked in on yelp at got 15% off the bill for us! Our server was nice and was more than happy to apply the discount. The drinks were part of happy hour so it didn't discount from that but it saved us some money on our pizza. Love yelp check in specials!!

4451507,2013-11-17,3,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I've now been to Pizza Rock twice. First things first, why not 5 stars? Basically because I've been here twice and I have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. What the heck Pizza Rock? I don't typically go around asking, Hey can I get a local discount? But. When I've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, I've been able to get 20% off but haven't? Arg. That ruffles my feathers.

On to what is GOOD. Happy hour is awesome. Personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. My friends and I came here during HH and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared the meatballs. Okay. I'm no meatball expert but I think these are delicious. Meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. I also like that these meatballs are simple. I've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. Another reason I like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. Quality. I think.

Other than HH.... I came here with my hubby on a Saturday night. Luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. Service was quick and to the point. Our server neither impressed me or upset me so I'll give a neutral rating for service.

What we ordered... The New Yorker 23. It was the one pizza on the menu I figured my picky (and rather plain-Jane) husband would enjoy. The New Yorker comes with: Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta. I asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. They were happy to oblige. Under the menu it says, ""Winner, Best Traditional, Las Vegas"". I'm not sure what that means.

Overall thoughts on the pizza... I enjoyed it. I love the thin crust style. The mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. Pepperoni... Okay. The Ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni and garlic. The flavors were that of a ""normal"" pizza, but with a refinement. I think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.

Final decision: Mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. Although delicious, I would rather go back for the happy hour. HH is your best bet here. And ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. You'll probably get a discount, unlike me. I'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.

Other things I want to go back for:

Their Margherita (only 73 made per day)
Clam and Garlic Pizza
La Regina (The Gold Cup Winner)
Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale Pizza
Cal Italia (again, this comes as one of the Personal Pizzas on HH menu and is a FoodNetwork winner)
The Chorizo Mussels (App)
And I would come back again for the meatballs.

Looks, like I'll be making a few return trips. The great thing is, I am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where I live now.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,4,bsmH4G78ULgN15YwTxlVYA

4477403,2016-01-19,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"So on a last-minute diversion from HQ, our company decided to have a director's meeting here in Vegas.  What that meant to my schedule today was a hectic morning, shuffling and pricing flights to get to Vegas, end result putting me back $507. It also meant that I didn't have time to grab a bite to eat and I arrived at about 3:35 PM good and hungry.

How lucky was I to find that Pizza Rock was just across the street from the Grand Hotel where I'm staying downtown?  I had eaten at Pizza Rock a few months ago when my company had a national sales meeting here and was really impressed with the pizza so it was a no-brainer making that trek across the street after I arrived.

I went with the ""vegetarian"" pizza which is essentially a margarita pizza with cherry tomatoes instead of tomato slices. All the ingredients are fresh and wonderful, which makes for a very tasty pizza. There are three things that truly define the pizza. Firstly, the dough and how well it's baked. Well, at PR, it's fire roasted here to perfection.  Secondly, it's the cheese. If a restaurant uses low-quality cheese there's just something about how it tastes and how it melts that's not correct, and that is not the case at this restaurant as it's chewy and delicious. And lastly and most importantly, it's the Marinera.  An unsavory and bland Marinera can absolutely ruin the pizza no matter how good the dough or cheese is.  Pizza Rock's Marinera is zinging, spicy, and just right.

Add to that a 500 ML bottle of Mexican Coke and you have the best first meal to have when arriving in Vegas.

4484496,2015-06-24,9,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"We left the Reggae Festival at the Amphitheater after 11 pm, so I checked Yelp to see what restaurants were open.  I was shocked to find that so many downtown joints close at 10.  On a Saturday night in summer??  Pizza Rock was open, and since I hadn't been at the Yelp Elite shindigs held there, it was definitely on my bucket list.  

The front of the restaurant looked like the kind you'd find on any street corner in NYC, so I was surprised by the size of the dining room in back.  Dark. Loud.  Dark's not a bad thing, but loud's another story.  I liked a lot of the music they being played (live DJ), but not the songs that were so thunderous that they reverberated through my body as if I were being tased.

We were there at Happy Hour time, so we took advantage of that.  We shared a house salad (not on the HH menu) and a Frank's True Italian personal pizza.  Hubby ordered the meatballs; we didn't share those because I'm not a fan of balls when they're the traditional beef, pork and veal combo.  I know they're supposed to be the best, but it's just not my thing.  The sauce, though, was divine, and there was enough of it to make a meal.  It may well be the best sauce I've ever tasted.  He loved the whole thing so much he ordered a foursome for $4 to take home.  And I put some of that sauce on my pizza, which doesn't come with the red stuff.

So why, almost alone among Yelp Elites, do I give this only three stars?  After all, the table was comfortable, the service was terrific, the Yogi Berra quote stenciled on the wall was hysterical, and the HH prices reasonable.  Aside from the blasting music, this is, after all, a pizza joint, one that's revered by many.  And the answer is:

I DIDN'T LIKE THE PIZZA!!!

As born and bred New Yorkers, we know that no matter how good the toppings, pizza needs a crispy crust.  This was soft, and weird, almost like the boxed stuff in the supermarket frozen aisle.  I took home the couple of leftover slices, hoping they'd crisp up in the toaster oven, but they didn't.

I found a deal on Living Social for $29 for 1 craft beer, 1 appetizer, and 1 pizza to share. It was well worth it!!  The total for this portion of our bill was $54!  

When we walked in, this place had a nice vibe. The music was a great selection and it was the perfect volume.  We were sat near the bar, but asked to move, so we didn't have to sit on bar stool level table and chairs.  They were very accommodating and moved us no problem. 

Of course we all ordered beers.  They have a nice selection of drafts, and an even bigger selection of bottles. 

We ordered the SALUMI & FORMAGGIO BOARD for our appetizer. The menu describes it as - Assorted Salumi & Formaggio, Fig Jam, Spicy Candied Walnuts, Rosemary Focaccia Toast.  It was very good and is a nice bite for 2-4 people. Unfortunately, we were so hungry, I forgot to get a picture of it. :P

Then for the pizza, we decided to get our money's worth of the coupon I had and ordered the biggest pizza we could.  LOL! 
We chose the Romano II. It was divided into three section with three different toppings. All three were delicious!  The pizza was thin and crispy and there were plenty of toppings and cheese. 
Here's how the menu describes it...section 1: Tomato Sauce, Natural Casing Pepperoni, Italian Sausage; section 2: Pesto, Caramelized Onions, Goat Cheese, Roasted Tomatoes, Garlic; section 3: Ricotta, Garlic, Basil, Linguisa, Piquante Peppers
Section 1 was perfect for that typical man ""meat lovers"" pizza. Section 2 was unique with the sweetness of the Caramelized onions and saltiness of the goat cheese.  Section 3 was my favorite, even though I think they forgot the ricotta. I loved the sweetness of the Piquante Peppers (like a roasted red pepper), and the Linguisa is very similar to their pepperoni. 

During our meal the GM came over and asked us how we were enjoying it and even told us all about the business, from the encouragement of my Aussie friend.

I have been here once before and the food is amazing, the prices are little higher then your standard pizza place however, the quality of the ingredients used are WAY above the quality of a normal place.

I really like this place and very excited they are opening one up closer to my house in the Ranch.

Park at the Downtown Grand like the website says - just a short walk.  Got a few bottled beers from the bar for the wait - decent beer selections & appreciated the $4 prices for some of the bottles.

Lots of TVs - this was a March Madness weekend - yet the four TVs in our line of site all had the same game on where there were at least 3 other games going.  Even when the sole game on went to halftime the screens weren't changed.  When that game ended, the screens were finally changed so two different games were on.

Pizza Rock has Coke products - yea! Ordered meatballs for appetizer and ""The Boss"" Sicilian for our party of 3 to share. FYI - they will take items off their pizza but won't substitute other items.  

Meatballs were excellent.  Tried to order a second appetizer after the meatballs came to the table; took forever for server to come back to table and our garlic bread order came to table after the pizza.  

Menu was huge and complex and could have had more detail.  Some pizzas are 12"" and some are 16""; some are thin crust and some are 1.5"" thick crust and some are served square.  Why not put all of this on the menu?  The server explained each pizza type but it was confusing trying to remember which pizza was what size.

Our Sicilian pizza was quite good.  After the first bite, we realized something was off - some of the toppings were cold, while the crust was hot.  When our server came back to the table, I asked if there were topping added to the pizza after it was cooked and she said yes.  From what I could determine, all of the vegetable toppings were cold - added to the pizza after it came out of the oven.  We had asked for no green peppers and no olives, would have been even more cold toppings without leaving these off.  Didn't affect the flavor of the pizza too much.  Never had pizza like this before.

The garlic bread was excellent.  It was served with huge side of marinara.

We took home more than half of the pizza.  Can't wait for leftovers - I can heat all of the toppings.

HUGE wait for tables when we left. Make a reservation, if you have the opportunity.  We'll be back.",bvnu6ts51ICEPI0p3HMm8g,0,0,4,R7gkOVy6Jcct4RoNU9PgbA

4628453,2015-01-05,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"My visit took place on Jan 01, 2015. I ate at the bar and watched the Rose Bowl.

But also know that I actually sought out this restaurant because more than one professional restaurant reviewer listed Pizza Rock as amongst the ""Top 10 Pizzas - 2014"" in Las Vegas. In addition, these writers noted that the restaurant has multiple pizza ovens - different ovens to facilitate the production of different styles (Neapolitan, Roma, New York, Chicago...) of pizza, and this caught my interest.

So let's start with the positives:

It has a great location. It is across the street from the Downtown Grand, or one block off of Fremont Street. So if you want to get away from the noise, and casino and chain eateries on Fremont Street without having to drive, it a good option.

The interior is well decorated. If you want to have a nice meal without distractions, you can.  And if you want to sit in an area with views of TV screens to monitor your sports team, you can.

The pricing is very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber, and the service was also very good.

But with regards to the food.... I can only give ""an average"" rating based on my one meal.  I ordered the Traditional Neapolitan Margherita pizza, and did not ask for any special customization. I wanted to see what their interpretation was. The pizza was beautiful to look at. But I prefer a dryer, crispier crust. The rim of my pizza's crust was doughy and more like fresh bread. The bottom (flat area) of the crust was ""wetter"" than I prefer. Maybe this is the new trend. (I also visited ""800 Degrees"" on the Las Vegas Strip, and experienced the same issue of wet crust.) Perhaps I need to try a different ""style"" of pizza next time?

Here's the bottom line: the place is nice enough that I am willing to go back and try another meal. And having read my review, the staff is friendly enough: you or I can describe the textures we want from our pizza to the server. They can suggest a style of pizza that is to your liking, or they can ask the kitchen to accommodate. And they do have other entrees besides pizza.

It has a full bar, and a good selection of standard and craft beers.",psU9IaROPzivxgO2jDcmJg,0,0,3,58aG4WQ2fGC10QOsEnuTow

You can dine in, but there is also a cute little walk up window which works really great for late night. There are tables and chairs outside along a brightly lit side walk.

Sure go watch the Bellagio fountains, take your picture with the Vegas sign, watch a show, gamble, visit the Mob Museum then eat here.  I liked the place so much that it's now a must stop anytime I'm in Vegas.  

It's located in the old part of Vegas so if you visit the Mob Museum or Fremont St, it's right there. When you walk in the doors, you know you are immediately in a fun place.  There's a Jimi Hendrix painting on the wall, a classy bar with several TV's to watch the games, and a big huge semi truck with flames on the hood just because.  When you sit down you are presented with rock vinyl album covers which when you open them are menus.  My only complaint about the entire place was I had a Barbara Streisand album cover as my menu.

I was with 2 other people so we decided to split 2 pizzas.  We got a margarita which is served wet as it is in Naples.  The thing was amazing.  The crust had a perfect char and flavor.  It was up there with the best Margarita that I've ever had.  We also got the Quattro Carne which has as the name says 4 Italian meats, mozzarella, peppers, arugula, and goat cheese.  This was equally as good.  Their beer list was a good mix of styles, locals and imports.  The waiter knew his stuff about beer and gave me a great recommendation.

The VJ of the night played a lot of songs from the 90s, and it was actually really cool to see how they inspired the current songs. However, this makes for a rather loud experience, and we could barely talk to each other during dinner.

We got the famous margherita pizza, and a sausage pizza (the Sam Giancana). The pizzas were decent -- each of us had our own preference, mine being the margherita. The crust was thin and chewy, and the tomato sauce was delicious. I would just mop up the tomato sauce on its own.

However, combining the service, ambiance, and food, it's not really worth the price. It's like you're paying your way into a very, very expensive frat party.",x0i6NgHySrXWgb17gVMTuQ,0,1,3,4duwy607Zj_IsRVTfTFacg
4678947,2017-11-03,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Looking for someplace to have dinner on/near Fremont St. and had heard nothing but praise about this place, so we gave it a go. We walked in and were seated immediately. Nice, authentic and laid-back (if quite literally dark) atmosphere. The menu has a great variety of items - practically any type of pizza you can imagine is likely on it. Of course, they also offer typical Italian fare, e.g. pasta, and have a surprisingly wide array of salads to choose from. I opted for the classic Caesar and it was good; everything tasted fresh with a nice balance of croutons and cheese, and it wasn't drowned in dressing like many Caesars tend to be.

Now when it comes to pizza, the plainer the better for me; I typically like a classic margherita, no bells and whistles. The Ms. is a bit more adventurous than I am, though. Still, we decided to go well out of our comfort zone this time, and tried the Detroit Red Top - it's a square-style pie, cooked in steel pans imported from Detroit (says so right there in the menu's description) with the sauce atop the cheese, hence the name. 

The Red Top's crust is noteworthy for its buttery yet smoky, quasi-burnt (in a good way) taste - in fact, it was slightly overwhelming, but again, not necessarily in a bad way. In fact, it was absolutely delectable - sauce was robust, the variety of cheeses all meshed well together - but, man, was it filling! I had two slices and was beyond sated. ""Heavy"" doesn't begin to describe it. I'd say we ate around 8 pm or so...I wasn't hungry again until around noon the next day. Good thing we were staying in a suite furnished with a kitchenette (no humblebrag, honest!), so I could refrigerate, reheat, and enjoy it over the next couple or so days we were out there; it does reheat quite well, by the way. 

The Red Top isn't cheap at $27, but considering the quality of what you get and how much of it you get, that's a price you just deal with, I guess. 

Overall, excellent experience. I got what the hype and acclaim are about having visited here. Definitely merits a return trip (where I'll probably try their version of my old standby margherita) whenever we get back to LV.",GJDWR3qcl1o7W_bHAMiPSA,0,0,5,0ksYF09TPO_nkb73f89KrA

4701444,2014-01-10,2,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Their pizza is OUT OF THIS WORLD. That's all you need to know.

My first visit was during Yelp Helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). That night, I tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. Everything was so good that I returned just four days later with my fiance and friend Hally!

During my return visit, I had to order the Margherita ($16) again. The dough is hand-mixed with San Felice flour and proofed in Neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, Fior di Latte, Basil, EVOO, and sea salt. Finally, it's baked in a 900-degree Wood Stefano Ferrara oven. It's limited to 73 pies daily (although I heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy. True Neopolitan pizza! 

The three of us also shared the Downtown ($19): Pepperoni, Molinari Salami, Bacon, Chives, Mushrooms, Red Onions, Bell Peppers, Black Olives, Italian Sausage, Cherry Tomatoes; which is one of their ""American Originals"" pizzas that all feature tomato sauce, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. As well as the Honey Pie ($17): Quail Hollow Farm Honey, Calabrese Peppers, Green Onions, Mozzarella, Piave Cheese, Fried Caramelized Onions, Serrano Peppers; one of their ""California"" pizzas that use Caputo Flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. 

The Downtown reminded me of a ""supreme/deluxe"" pizza, but definitely better. I had tried the Honey Pie during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, I came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. I also tried their Classic Caesar salad ($10) and it was tasty. For drinks, I tried the Strawberry Fields Martini ($9.50): Stoli Strawberry, Strawberry Puree and a Hint of Mint and Hally ordered the Moscow Mule ($12): Stoli Vodka, Ginger Beer, and Fresh Squeezed Lemon Juice. Both really delicious cocktails. 

From both visits, my favorite pizzas are the Margherita, Honey Pie, and New Yorker and I absolutely loved the Sweet Nothing cocktail, so good. I didn't care for the Calamari Fritti, Rosemary Garlic Fries, or the Mastunicola pizza. Anyway, I could eat that Margherita pizza every day. It's that good. I have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so I can try their other delicious concoctions (I have my eyes on the PIzza Campari, Clam and Garlic, and Proscuitto e Pomodorini). Hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry Grimaldi's). But seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?

Parking is best on the surrounding streets like on Casino Center Blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at The Downtown Grand (super easy and close).

I have tried many of their pizza's but currently my fav is the Vedura veggie pizza, something about it is incredible. Another good one that is award winning- Cali Itlia, super unique pizza and tasty. If you really want to step outside the box- try the one with quail eggs, it is actually pretty good. 

Our issue: We put in an order for two pizzas (at the bar on a Tuesday non-busy evening) and 15-20mins later the bartender walks up and says ""Oh guys, I totally forgot to put your order in..what were the pizza's again?"" Ok..these things happen, not a huge deal as long as you do something to make up for it..I don't know- free bread or salad or a discount or something? NOTHING...I was pretty surprised by the fact that she did nothing to make up for the situation and obviously this had to reflect in her tip (we are very good tippers). 
Besides that, we always get service at Pizza Rock but typically go to the GVR location. 
Another example of the fact that service usually gets better further away from the strip and/or touristy areas..

UPDATE- 8/03/2016 
Went into this Pizza Rock location last night. Enjoyed three of our fave pizzas and some beer, and with the same bartender but this time she was great (: no complaints at all. I am always craving Pizza Rock and encouraging newbies to try it out.

First thing they tell us after we made a reservation was that we had a certain amount of time before we had to leave because of the amount of reservations they had that night. Are you kidding me? 

Servers looked miserable. Kinda slammed our plates down, turned right around and walked away. Even other people that were helping the server didn't seem friendly at all. We felt like they hated that we were even there. Service was slow. I will definitely never come back. I know they probably don't even care. But I hope it gets better for whoever else goes here.

Try going during happy hour, before you go out for the night. They have cheap, ice cold draught beers and $5 personal pizzas that are plenty big enough for a quick dinner.

I rarely get downtown (shame on me), so when I was attending an event at the Downtown Grand, I decided to give Pizza Rock a shot, as I'd heard good things about it.

I had two different slices over the course of the event (they offer some really awesome choices for slices), and both were excellent.

Both dining experiences were at the counter, so I can't comment on service in the sit-down portion of the restaurant. But the guys at the counter are great!

This may be a little thing, but I also thought it was very cool that sales tax was included in their prices. More establishments should move to that practice, in my opinion!",sOPmVW0bmbb8vwEH5C7FzA,2,1,5,1k4GZbXoXisFwjakvh665g

Now to the food: we ordered the famous award-winning Margherita and the Cal Italia. The Margherita has a nice nutty aftertaste to it, however, I don't see what makes it so special compared to any other Margherita pizza I've had. I think the Cal Italia was much better and is the superior pizza. The inclusion of balsamic and parmigianno makes the pizza very creamy and not too sweet. 

The only complaints I have are that the food is overpriced and the sangria was weak. They charge $25 for a New York style pizza - insane. If you've been to New York, you know that a slice of pizza is $1.

4750309,2018-06-11,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"PIZZA ROCK!!

Downtown wins again. One of my favorite happy hour locations in Las Vegas. A solid food menu with a far reaching drink and beer selection (sourced from around the world) gives you new items to try every time you visit. I have already been exposed to around a half of dozen new beer brands that I have added to my lexicon and I haven't scratched the surface of what they have to offer. 

I usually go straight to the bar to drink and order where the bartenders are always attentive and impress me with their knowledge of their beer options. From here I am in view of any one of the many large screen televisions that surround the eating areas adding to the enjoyable experience. 

Pizza Rock works well with groups as well, with tables and booths to choose from. I went with a few coworkers and the timeliness and quality of service did not drop off with the more people that visit. 

Pizza Rock even features a to go section where you can order slices and whole pies to go along with specials for to go orders. An all around all star location situated on the downtown scene.

We arrived just before the 3 pm happy hour on a Friday and were given some fun menus designed as record album covers with menu records inside. There are three varieties of happy hour Italian fries. We ordered fries with both gorgonzola sauce and crumbles. Some fries were crispy and some were soft in texture. The flavor was very good and the portion size was very generous for $4.00. Next we ordered a personal size  pizza with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni that was $7.00. It was cut into 6 slices. The crust was thin, golden brown and crispy. The restaurant is known for making extra thin crust pizza. The pizza smelled good & spicy and presented with large pieces of tasty sausage and appetizing little round Pepperoni's. Everything was so good! The regular menu prices for a whole pizza were a bit more expensive at around $23 to $28 dollars although they probably are also quite delicious. The hostess was friendly and cheerful greeting us we entered and exited. Our server was helpful in explaining the menu items. The decor is fun. There is a  semi-truck cab pertruding out into the dining area from the outside wall and wall paper made to look old, multi-layered  and vintage in the area of and leading to the restrooms.

The asparagus was wrapped in prosciutto and drizzled in a balsamic vinegar glaze. The pizza was delicious as well. The crust was very thick which was a little surprising.

I don't know what kind of dressing was on that salad, but it was so good! The pizza was so hot and fresh! The guy just brought it out of the oven and placed it on the table.

We also participated in happy hour. Of course. It was $2 off draft. The guy behind the counter was soo nice. Let us sample a beer we had never heard of. Ended up liking it, and drinking it...a few times. Everyone who works there has a genuinely positive attitude. They were willing to help. Anything that was needed was taken care of.

I was so disgusted so I immediately notified the hostesses and their response was appalling.  They made no attempt to deal with this crawling disgusting bug.  I had to make a big deal about it and finally the guys sitting at the table next to ours killed the bug.  By that time my appetite was nonexistent!

The cons:  Service was very slow, and I can't even blame it on the server. Drinks coming from the bar were slow, food delivery was slow.....the salad was so slow in coming that it came with the pizza (with the wrong dressing) and we sent it back.

The beer selection is always stellar and the bartenders have no problem letting you try some new beer before you purchase one.  I like the fact that you can purchase a slice and sit at the bar and get a beer.  It reminds me of being home again .

Had to bring it back to the bar which may be weird & inconvenient to most, but I was in a good mood this night so no complaints. What I will give 5 stars to is Dan the Man @ the take-out bar, he was super friendly and very informative! I got vegetarian and it was pretty good... for vegetarian. And for people who like pizza.

4870274,2014-10-02,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Went here on a Friday night with a group of 6 friends after very briefly doing the Fremont-Tourist-Thing. I had been dying to give this place a try since, after living in Chicago for 5 years, Vegas pizza had sucked balls, on the whole. 

We ordered the Cal Italia, and the Old Chicago, because fuck yes Chicago Cracker Crust. We also ordered a third pizza that never showed, but was only briefly missed. The other two were so wonderful...I almost don't have anything to say because, yeah, perfect pizza. Perfect. Crust, perfect. Sauces, perfect. Balance, ridiculously perfect. Ugh, I want some right now.

Waitress was awesome; attentive, informative, helpful, and not hovering, and the place was packed, so I do not hold the missing pie (which we were never charged for, either) against anyone. Super kind to one of my tourist friends, whose accent makes her pronunciation of things like ""prosciutto"" a source of embarrassment quite often. We felt utterly welcome and had a truly happiness-enducing meal.

 My only gripe was the noise level, which was pitched just above ""easy conversation"" range. That's to be expected at Fremont on a Friday, but not my bag. Will try it on a different night to see if the levels change.

It's a little on the pricey side for pizza, but I find I really don't care. It's so good I am happy to pay a little bit extra for pizza I truly enjoy. I will just go all Rhett Butler on my budget and remind it I don't give a damn. It's cheap for actually sating the Great Pizza itch.

Onto the menu! They have a nice beer selection, and the menu for pizza is huge. It's divided into all these different styles. There's really no small, medium, large. Each style of pizza comes in a set size. 

We picked the New Yorker, which I would say feeds about 3 people. I wanted to order more things, but the BF knew my eyes were much hungrier than my stomach, and plus we didn't have anywhere to store leftovers as we were going to the festival after. Good call because I was stuffed. Anyway, OMG, this pizza was SOOOO GOOD!  I think it was pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, fresh mozzerella, and little dollops of ricotta on a thin chewy crust. Everything about this pizza was amazing. In fact, I think I even said, ""This might be the best pizza I've ever eaten."" 

When I came to Pizza Rock for the Yelp Elite event, I have to say I was not that impressed. It's probably because they weren't prepared for how many people were there and everything was just chaos and the food wasn't prepared as well. Who knows. All I know is this time around the pizza was on point!

My only complaint is that the drinks are so expensive. $12 for a Moscow Mule? Aren't we downtown at a pizza joint? I guess that's downtown prices now.

But the star of the visit for me was the pizza oven and cook on display and dealing slices out the window, really, really made my heart feel like I was in Harlem or somewhere in New York
 
As for the pizza itself I ordered two pizzas and one burger, a bit of a challenge to get the kitchen to perfectly have the order ready in a professional time, but they were on it four stars alll the way with this restaurant.  Downsides were they had no Sicilian crust or dough so I could only order their La Regina on Chicago style an amazing homage to the freshness and taste of Chicago.  Their American Pizza is worth its weight on the menu and could have the stomach to go against the most difficult palate.  Don't forget Pizza Rock on your next trip into Downtown Las Vegas area, grab a slice out the door, or call in an order they are very easy, professional crew.

I think the place feels like business people have money to try and look cool but not quite getting there.  

Who care?  Pies are good.  You gotta be impressed with the amount of money that went into buying all those ovens.  Most pizza joints boasts only one.  The variety on the menu is impressive and some choices are inventive.  I especailly liked the farmer's market special.  I mean they are within walking distance of the third street Friday market, they should take advantage of it and make a pizza out of what is fresh that day.  

The pizzas are huge and tasty.

The clams that we got were huge and tasty.

I can see people hosting parties there.  There is plenty of space and pizza is good grub to feed a lot of people.

There's also a takeout counter.  I think they serve folks at the Downtown Grand too.  

Get there during happy hour.  Get the meatballs for cheap.  :)

What is the best thing about the place is that the people working there are receptive to reviews, right then and there.  They really want to know what you think.  That is always a plus for me.",Vh3XdOLujwPsUWygXQNO_w,1,0,5,cxlnCDba3cuxMj_ehNVTIA

The atmosphere is very Gothic rock--rock music is constantly being blasted (it can be a little loud) and the lighting is a bit dim, but I like how they committed to an aesthetic, and enjoy the ambiance. 

The food is the obvious best part of Pizza Rock. The New Yorker is probably one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten, and I never get tired of ordering it. Due to this, my pizza range has been limited to this one and a few others, but I've had friends try some of the more unique recopies, and have given nothing but rave reviews. Appetizers like the meatballs and calamari are also pretty great. 

They also have a phenomenal happy hour, with half-off well drinks and some great beer options. If you enjoy pizza, I think that Pizza Rock is a spot you should definitely check out.",5lI9bnqtUC2pHkTspM4gOw,0,0,5,SnkIvUafIZ6zvK8AGTBieQ

5016659,2014-09-01,2,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Mmmmm Pizza Rock! Let me start with normally I'm not a huge pizza person. My husband Joel on the other hand could eat pizza everyday and be perfectly happy. So when our friends Dyanna and Brent suggested pizza for our dinner out one Saturday night I knew Joel would be down! 

Since it was Saturday night we had to wait 45 minutes. The hostess were nice, but could have given a little more instruction. They said that they'd text me when our table was ready, but the only text I got was one saying we should head to the hostess stand and wait. Which we did for 15 more minutes. Finally, we were seated. It was a hot night so we ordered lots of water. If your feeling like something other then water they have a fully stocked bar too. Plus, real Mexican Cokes! 

Now, let's talk pizza! They have so many! I love that with the description they tell you the degree that they cook the pizza at. From traditional to the unique they have it. Dyanna and I both ordered a side salad and they ordered a New Yorker and we ordered the Cali Italia. Wow! I really enjoyed the salad dressing which was a super garlicky and creamy vinaigrette. Our Cali Italia pizza had a lot of cheeses, sweet fig preserves, prosciutto and a balsamic reduction. It had that total savory, salty and sweet thing going on. A must try if your looking for something non traditional. Dyanna and Brent's pizza was very classic and Joel could not stop talking about it! 

The atmosphere, once seated, had a fun rock n roll vibe! Flat screen TVs are all around the restaurant which play old school music videos. Yay! They even have a huge truck in the middle of the place that is the  DJ booth. Along the walls are other rooms that give u some privacy if you have a large group. Perfect for a bachelor or bachelorette party. 

Pizza Rock has some tasty pizza. It's been on my mind since we went. Make sure if your going on the weekend you call ahead for a reservation. Also, check Yelp for 15% off your check when you check in. (Make sure you inform your waitress.)Parking can be hard in this area of downtown. I suggest using the Downtown Grand valet. You can park for free and get it validated at the hostess stand at Pizza Rock.

After having a few cocktails at DCR and Sip'n'Tip on a Thursday night, I finally took the plunge and grabbed a Picante slice ($6) at Pizza Rock's slice counter.  Good pizza comes down to its crust and Pizza Rock's crust was great!  It had nice crispiness, chewiness, and a little bit of char that served as the perfect medium to top with a perfect amount of pepperoni, linguica, chorizo, banana peppers, green onions, serrano peppers, and ricotta cheese.  It had plenty of spice and saltiness that in my mind made for a perfect pizza to go with beer.  Alas, I didn't have a beer with it.  Next time...  As pizza by the slice goes, Pizza Rock's Picante slice (and likely its other offerings, too) was a bigger slice with a better tasting crust and toppings, and an overall better value than Secret Pizza or Five50 Pizza.

5042209,2013-10-16,4,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Today is day one of the week long grand opening for Pizza Rock!  So excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  What's even better was I heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on Saturday.  Originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  This was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!

The restaurant is on the corner of Ogden and 3rd St, attached to the Mob Bar and Triple George saloon.  Right away, you notice the huge ""Pizza Rock"" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  When you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  Everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  Because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  To the right of the hostess stand was the Pizza Takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  Pretty cool.  After the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  Super cool!  It serves as a multi purpose art.  Aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new DJ station AND serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  WOW! The bar is huge and gorgeous!  Lots of metal art accents around it.  Lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  They even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  Lots going on and it all seems to work.  

When we were greeted by our server, Shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  They didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  Kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so I couldn't really complain.  Shirley was a bit flustered as I expected on day one.  She quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  I completely understand.  First day jitters are a given.  She had a GREAT personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.

For dinner, here's what we got:

Classic Caesar, normally for $10.00:  Hearts of Romaine, Homemade Caesar dressing, House Croutons and shaved pieces of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Definitely a shareable dish.  I think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  Lots of fresh ingredients, but I didn't have a few issues with this salad.  The croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  The dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  They made it with A LOT of anchovies.  Now I'm a HUGE fan of homemade Caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.

Margherita Pizza, normally for $15.00:  This pizza was a 2007 World Pizza Cup Winner in Italy!  Hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from Italy.  WOW.  San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt.  The dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  The sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  Mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a Margherita, which was awesome.  The only critique was the basil.  Not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. 

Downtown Pizza, normally for $19.00:  WOW, lots going on!  Mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, Italian sausage and cherry tomatoes.  Think of it as an upgraded supreme.  With all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  WOW loved the flavor punch.  My only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  It couldn't support the amount of toppings.  It became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.  

Manhattan Calzone, normally for $12.00:  Stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta and garlic.  As my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks for cheese and bread.  LOTS of CHEESE.  Omg, it was everywhere.  I personally don't think Ricotta is needed.  Maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  Holy cheese!  

During this week, all menu food items are free.  Our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  Please remember to tip your servers great!  This review, I've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  Just the ambiance alone will take them far.  I will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  Next time, I'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,7,5,4,hLBWz1-2_ZCK9-n5kBHUsA

We got the salumi and formaggio plate, which came with three cured meats that were all pretty similar but the bleu cheese, fig spread, and walnuts were exactly what I wanted. The calamari was alright; it's a large portion and you have the option of doing half spicy, half original. The accompanying marinara is BOMB.

But let's talk about the pizza!! We opted for the award-winning Margherita. The crust was chewy and had a nice texture and toasty flavor from the charred blisters - fantastic. It tasted homemade in the best way. Worth ordering, especially because most American pizza consists of a thick, bready crust built to hold the onslaught of toppings we tend to like.

Because unbeknownst to me, we had just happened upon  one of Tony Gemignani's restaurants.   IMHO he makes the best pizza on earth. I can attest, I've been to Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco many times and it's bona fide pizza heaven.  

Pizza Rock is conveniently located across from the Downtown Grand Hotel. Our server was attentive but not hovering and it was a fun vibe too.  Menus are crafted from album covers for Pete's sake!  We hung out at happy hour which made this an even better deal, I'd have been completely satisfied paying full price.  

Rosemary Garlic Italian Fries and Fried Green Beans were a sold start.  Classic Meatballs were as drool-worthy as they are in Tony's San Francisco spot.

Nice size place with lots of seating and I love that they have multiple styles of pizza ovens.

Margherita Pizza - I loved this pie when I had it at Tony's pizza spot in San Fran. I wasn't as in love with it here.

Meatballs - not grandma's but not bad either. The sauce was good and at 6 for $10 it wasn't horribly priced.

Fries - hahahahaha... next (please take this off your menu.. i would be embarrassed to serve those)

Beer - Blanche de Bruxelles on tap. Thank you!!!! ""Pissing Boy"" beer for everyone!

Service - ehhh... our waiter was a bit awkward and not great at answering questions we had. When I asked how much the beers were he just said ""it's not as expensive as elsewhere""... ummmm.... thanks? He poorly explained the size of the sicilian pizza which we realized when we saw one come out after. But... he did give us 20% off on our bill for being locals so YAY!

We asked if they had a sicilian pie without all the crazy toppings and were told that ""we can take the toppings off but it's going to be the same price."" So for the people like me that like a simple pizza... fugghetaboutit.. full price for you!

Hopefully some of these issues and inconsistencies are due to the fact that they haven't been open long. I wish them the best and I'll be back again in the future to try some different dishes.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,2,0,4,XSm5MnwFvoyC1ZzaxbEJkQ

While the cheese slices cost $4 and pepperoni, $4.50, the other slices are $6 each. 

We stuck with cheese slices each visit (hard to beat this classic for any vegetarian) and Pizza Rock was completely on point with the balance of tangy marinara, thin crust, and delicious cheese.

Garlic bread - good, but not amazing. 
Calamari - good, but not great. The spicy was crazy spicy though. I just wasn't a fan. 
Sausage and Stout - I wasn't the biggest fan, but everyone else dug it. 
New Yorker - yes. YES YES YES. SO GOOD! If you haven't tried this one, please do. Everything from the crust, marinara, and toppings were amazing!
Old Chicago - Another YES. This was probably my favorite. Mostly because of that sausage. 

Overall, this place was amazing. My favorite thing - the ricotta cheese. That stuff was so light, fluffy and flavorful. I don't eat pizza that often, but I have never craved it so much that I can't stop thinking about it for the next few days.

Then boy, do I have a place for you!! So, maybe that was a loaded intro, but I'll make up for it by keeping this short and sweet. 

We ordered the 6 meatballs, truffle fries, rosemary garlic fries, a margherita pizza and a Cal Italia pizza. 

The meatballs had zero flavor to them and were mighty dry. The sauce was passable. Not only could I have made better meatballs, but that one Aunt everyone has who cooks terrible food and brings it during your family gatherings could have out shined these meatballs with her eyes closed. 

The fries were an embarrassment. Like, think cheap bargain basement U.S. Foods quality fries with barely any flavor added to them. It's a pizzeria and they weren't too outrageous at $6, so I won't hold that one too much against them. 

The pizza we ordered was the trendy napoletana style small undercooked pizza. It was ok. Not $16 ok, but ok. I should really have tried the New York style, but that will be saved for another time. Those are $20+ a piece. And should you want a Sicilian, they offer them here, but for $30+ for a rectangle. Apparently you can get away with charging these prices in Downtown Las Vegas. At somewhere like New York Pizza & Pasta, you pay $17 to start, and it fills the entire square of the 16"" pizza box. I didn't try the other pie as the toppings didn't do it for me. 

The server was friendly. Though, a pet peeve of mine is when a pizzeria doesn't automatically bring out parmesan and red pepper. It should either be on the table right away or served with the pizza. That's pizza 101, guys. Thankfully, the drinks weren't too nuts. My Jack and Coke was like $7. They also offer a 20% discount for locals, so I suppose those two things ease the highway robbery a bit. There are TV's everywhere and the place is spacious. So, the highlight of my experience was that there were TVs and I wasn't crammed in around other people... It's downtown, where it's trendy to overpay for subpar items and deal with inconvenient parking. Not sure I'll return, unless I'm in the area and starving. If I do, I'll try a NY style and skip the meatballs and fries. You probably should too.",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,11,6,2,jX8A177iQ4snPtPLg7U71g

Came with a group of Yelpers with big appetites, so we were able to BLAST our way through quite a bit on the menu!

My FAVORITE by far was the Cal-Italia ($18): Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano & Balsamic Reduction. This was EXCELLENT and the highlight of the meal for me! Great mix of sweet, savory and vinegar/acidic flavors.  Highly recommended :)

Another great choice would be the Margherita ($16): San Marzano Tomatoes, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Basil, EVOO and Sea Salt. Honestly, this was probably the FIRST enjoyable Margheria I've had! Not usually a fan of this style pie.  Whatever they do differently here, I enjoyed...but you may not for the same reasons.

Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale ($18): Mozzarella, White Rose Potatoes, Chorizo, Pork Cheek, Rosemary, Fromage Blanc, Calabrese Peppers & Lavender Sea Salt. This was surprisingly SPICY...a bit over the top, but still enjoyable.  Order it knowing it's actually spicy, and you'll do just fine.

Romana III ($32): 1) Sweet Fig Preserves, Prosciutto, Gorgonzola & Balsamic Reduction. 2) Ricotta, Garlic, Basil, Linguisa & Piquante Peppers. 3) Gorgonzola, Dates & Pecans, and Apples, Honey, Nutella. Interesting combinations here...the only one that didn't really satisfy was the middle portion. A bit SPENDY, but it's huge and serves 2-4 people.  I'd pass on this one next visit.

For dessert, we also tried quite a bit.  The best IMO was the Pecan Turnover : Light Puff Pastry, Maple Pecan, Crunch & Coffee Ice Cream. This was pretty tasty...probably the most enjoyable dessert we tried. Came out piping hot too...yum :)

Apple Calzone : Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Caramel & Vanilla Gelato. This is served with 2 calzones...pretty GOOD overall but nothing extraordinary. 

Market Pizza : Pumpkin Puree, Cinnamon, Brown Sugar, Bacon & Marshmallows. Not really my kind of dessert...perhaps if you are a PUMPKIN lover?

Mud Pie : Oreo Cookie Crust, Chocolate Ganache, Coffee Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, Caramel & House Made Whipped Cream. This was very FROZEN...hard as a rock. I enjoyed the cookie crust though. 

So it's a hit or miss kinda spot for me.  Depending on what you order, your results WILL vary...for better and worse.

5212473,2015-01-30,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I'm going to start this by saying that I am originally from New York City. Anyone who knows anything about the legendary rivalry between New York and Chicago when it comes to pizza knows that it goes much, much deeper than that. Pizza sauce runs in my veins. I have been called (and rightfully so), a pizza snob.

Having said that, Pizza Rock has some of the best pizza I've ever had. In my life. It was even better than any pizza I had when I lived in Italy. The fresh ingredients and the special oven(s) make their food taste like heaven. The crust..... I could write long paragraphs about the texture of the crust alone, about the crisp crunch when you first bite into it, followed by the chewy texture, but I won't go on about that. 

I will tell you that my favorite pizza is the New York. Ha ha. No, really. It's amazing! At first I thought it was strange that they put little dollops of fresh ricotta cheese on it after it is baked, and I was taken aback. Just a little. But darn if it didn't grow on me, fast. They've ruined me now for all other pizza places. 

I have not tried the pastas yet, but I will. Also, I like the place. It is rather large inside, but somehow manages to feel intimate. A good place to gather with friends and family. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food. Beer selection (and I'm not really a beer girl, but I'm learning) is not too shabby either.

We were downtown checking out the Container Park (great spot, by the way) and we wanted to eat inside since it was getting chilly outside, and most of the containers don't have much indoor seating.

(Surprisingly, my kids even liked this and it had gorgonzola in it, which is pretty amazing, since most kids won't touch that sort of cheese, right?)  It could have used a little more prosciutto.  But the flavors were awesome - sweet, salty, and savory all together.  I love foods like that!  For the kids, we got them just a regular classic pepperoni/cheese pizza to share instead of ordering off the kids' menu, which they liked.  They have a large draft beer selection (I had the Moose Drool), and kid's drinks (if you don't buy off the kid's menu for a meal deal) are $1, which I always appreciate.

This time was just to walk in and grab a slice to go at their front counter. The guy was nice enough, and made our orders with a quickness.

5278117,2015-01-14,2,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Pizza Rock has the absolute best cheese pizza by the slice. Located right across from the Downtown Grand, Pizza Rock occupies a prime location. Whenever I'm downtown, I always end up at the to-go window for a late night buzzed-driven snack fest (it doesn't help that Pizza Rock stays open till 2AM on Fridays and Saturdays). 

From the window, the slices at face value don't seem like much. I've witnessed many passerby ogle at the pizzas offered and then keep walking on by. They don't know what they're missing, I tell you! When you order, the window employees pop your pizza slice back in the oven. Your pizza slice is now pipping hot and newly fresh. :) The cheese slices are dripping with cheese. I don't know how that thin crust can hold the weight of all the cheese. I don't even like thin crust, but I like Pizza Rock's thin crust! Don't even get me started on the size of the slices. You'd need ogre hands to be able to handle one of those slices. 

Slices of pizza are $4-6. A fountain drink is $3.25. You can either sit at the stools inside (elbow room is limited) or try your luck with seating outside. Be warned! The pizza is definitely greasy. Don't be a pansy about it. Eat it! Don't dab at it with your napkin. It adds to the flavor. 

I prefer getting my pizza at the window versus eating inside at the restaurant. It's pretty pricey for a pizza place and my dining experience was lackluster. The garlic fries ($6) were cold and disappointing, and the garlic bread ($7) was as hard as a brick. And the hostess girls were snooty. Worthy mention: The Picante ($19) pizza was inventive and loaded with flavor.    

I forgive all, because I can't get enough of my cheese pizza slices. Until next time, Pizza Rock.

Having repeatedly neglected to visit Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco in favor of places like Una Pizzeria, Pizzeria Delfina, Zero Zero, and others I was admittedly intrigued when the well awarded chef opted to set up shop in downtown Las Vegas at Pizza Rock - the swanky new digs, multiple televisions, and Guitar Hero worthy playlist a far cry from the eponymous Bay Area location even though the multiple oven and top notch sourcing concepts remained intact - and it was with all those things in mind that myself and five others descended on the restaurant for a tasting of sizeable proportions, a total of 4.5 pizzas and three desserts served over the course of just over two hours with hit-and-miss results.  A surprisingly large space, literally big enough to park a truck, it was an early arrival that assured us use of the large private dining room and with excellent service from both the general manager plus an enthusiastic young waiter it would not be long before our pizzas started to arrive and brought out in three separate courses it was with the signatures that we began, the ""limited"" Margherita proving cool to the touch and shockingly bland despite both excellent char and chew to the crust while the Cal-Italia proved far superior with a crunchy, toothsome crust more than able to stand up to a bevy  of toppings both sweet and savory, acidic and creamy.  Moving next to the interesting yet overly complicated and entirely too spicy Quail Egg selection it was at last the ""3-course"" Romana with its cracker crisp crust and well-paired toppings that wowed me most - the central third particularly well done with the rich meatballs nicely balanced by light cream and ample garlic, though the sweet selection was certainly not lacking in contrast or flavor either.  Moving last to a gifted half of the Farmer's Market Pizza, unfortunately overloaded with cinnamon just as the Quail Egg had been with spice, and finally to a trio of desserts where only the delicate pecan turnover would prove either inspired or memorable I think it is safe to say that the key to enjoying a meal at Pizza Rock is to simply embrace the concept and realize that ""everything to everyone"" and ""do one thing and do it well"" are very different mantras; the former definitely improved by a group of good people, excellent service, and (at least in this case) fond memories of 80's and 90's rock ballads.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,5,3,cnMiEyZgY2WmT12IYWxJSQ

I ordered a Bloody Mary to start and could only choke down a quarter of it. So I ordered a margarita instead and told the waitress I wouldn't be finishing the Bloody Mary and she pretended to not hear me. The margarita was yucky salty and way too sweet. Disgusting. For dinner I ordered the Downtown pizza 12"" which was enough for 2 people to split. Also at our table was a Marghertia pizza and the New York pizza. I definitely ordered the only good one. I would say it tasted good, but it's not the best pizza I've ever had. The Marghertia tasted burned and the waitress told us that is how it's supposed to taste. Award winning my ass. The New York pizza was ok with the exception of the dollop of nauseating creamed cheese on top. To other fellow food snobs I would stay far away from this place. The reviews are misleading.

So the food, we ordered the margarita pizza, the owner won a pizza contest in Italy for it so that was a no brain er,  and a pear, walnut and Gorgonzola salad. Nice server, took the order, then never came back, it was not busy, finally someone else brought everything out at once, we didn't care about that after all it's a pizza place. The salad was good, about the same as that salad anywhere you go, but the pizza was cold! We had to call the server over to see if maybe it was supposed to be served that way? Nope, he took it back, and brought us a hot one. It was good, very simple good crust, tomato sauce just like in Italy, and yummy mozzarella and basil.

1. Calamari Fritti, 13
- Traditional or Calabrese style with calabrese aioli and marinara dipping sauces 
2. American  Original - Downtown, 20 
- Mozzarella, pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, sahhlots, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, black olives, Italian sausage, cherry tomatoes
3. Soda, Unlimited refills, 3
for 7 (Used the Living Social Deal - $29 for $8 beer, Antipasti, and pizza (excludes NY22"")

- Parking is pretty lame. We tried Binions because they have Free Parking with validation, but they took out the validation next the cashiers! Fail. So there practically isn't anymore free parking on the strip. You gotta eat at their restaurant or actively gamble. $8 for 1.5hrs. Shiet...
- Got in around 9pm, seated in a few minutes. Sat in the back, next to the bar, right next to a speaker, great place to have a screaming conversation.
- Ran out of Sicilian Style dough. Just our luck. ""Just served the last one 15 min ago."" I guess if we came earlier, we wouldn't have had to deal with that problem. We actually wanted to order The Boss pizza instead because the crust is thicker with Sicilian Style. I'm not much of a fan of ""the potato chip like pizza"" or should I say thin crust. haha 
-Because we sat next to a speaker, our server, Chelsei, couldn't really hear us over the music. After several AHEM, excuse meess....one of them got through, and she handed us utensils and napkins after we got our antipasti. Who eats calamari with a fork and towel anyway? haha. come on now...Anyway, she was very good at drink refills and attentive thereafter. 
- The calamari was great. We got it half and half. I recommend it bc after I ate a few spicy, i needed to balance it out with one regular. Spicy one or Calabrese style tasted better. Chelsei hooked it up with dat extra dip doe. haha. Needed that for the extra dunkers na mmm saying. LOL. 
- The downtown was fresh. Loved the cherry tomatoes, so red. 6 slices. didn't like the uncooked onions. peeled off. Wood fire pizza nom! 

Break down of the Living Social deal...
- So if you choose the most expensive Antipasti, which is  the Calamari at $13 and the most expensive pizza, Romana, at $35, get the beer $8, then technically, you can get the saving at 48%. 
- I probably should have just saved the deal for another day and just used the Yelp Check-in Promo of 15% off.",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,7,6,3,cYoadXqVgUBy8y-qFScLwA

/endrant

I read on a review to park in DT garage 3 - well, I didn't do that. You can also parallel park in front of the restaurant or across the street - I didn't do that either. I parked at Binion's which is a short walk from Pizza Rock. I was told that the DT garage is a mess anyway. I had no clue where I needed to walk after parking my car so I followed a showgirl wearing sparkly stuff and feathers. She was walking towards the opposite direction - I was late for dinner but I got pics of her nice cheeks!

/endshenanigans

The place is filled with TV's so you can watch sports. There's a big rig coming out of the wall. Sheet metal with a heart, spade, club, diamond cut out on the ceiling. I got a Chimay...3/4 of it since 1/4 of it ended up on the table when it was put in front of me. They were giving me a grapefruit drink which I apparently ordered and not a Chimay. I hate grapefruit so let me go ahead and order me a grapefruit drink because that makes sense!

I was looking forward to trying their truffle fries/ rosemary garlic fries and Cal Italia pizza. So we get those plus meatballs and margherita pizza. Kacey informed us that this is the same as Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco. She was right. Same menu and everything. We were debating whether or no we should get a Sicilian pizza but it's $30...for a pizza? What?

Truffle Fries:
Fries were crispy inside and out. Truffle flavor was not noticeable. They drizzled a little bit of truffle oil, I only saw a few tiny specks of black truffles on these fries. Flavor was definitely lacking. 2/5

Rosemary Garlic Fries:
The rosemary taste was strong. I was hoping for more garlic flavor instead of GROSSmary. 2.5/5

Meatballs:
6 tender smelly balls. Smelly because of the cheese probably. They were ok. 3.5/5

Margherita Pizza:
Great crisp chewy crust. Real tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and basil. A pizza for the purists. 4/5

Cal italia:
Mario and Luigi did not approve of the Cal Italia. This California-inspired pizza was a Food Network Gold Medal winner if it matters to anyone. It has gorgonzola, asiago, mozzarella, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di Parma, Parmiggiano-Reggiano and balsamic reduction. Sweet and salty...not for the purists. I enjoyed this bastardized pizza. 5/5

We got a 20% discount for being locals. Their happy hour starts at 10pm and some menu items go for $3, $5 and $7. Service was not the best but it wasn't horrible. Pizzas were good but skip the fries. So, overall, this place deserves 3.5 stars.

Shortly after posting my review, I got a message from one of the owners and he said:

""Would like to send you some additional info on Pizza Rock:
- Free valet parking is available for Pizza Rock directly across the street at the Downtown Grand casino.
- The Sicilian pizza is a large format pizza and generally serves 3 people, hence the $30 price tag.""

5321983,2013-11-14,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Went to Pizza Rock tonight with my wife, daughter, and a family friend.  While I was aware they have an extensive menu, it was such a pleasant evening we wanted to eat outside.  Pizza Rock has a nice outdoor dining area adjacent to an ordering window that faces the alley at The Grand in downtown off 3rd street.  
   
We went up to the window to order, but since we weren't 100% sure on what we wanted to order we went just inside the entryway to place our orders, since it's a bit quieter and we could here the servers/cooks better.  They had several varieties of pizzas to choose from all ready to eat similar to other pizza-by-the-slice restaurants.  I ordered 2 pepperoni slices, my wife got a pepperoni and a cheese slice, and the kids each got a slice of pepperoni.  

The prices were reasonable my wife's and my 4 slices total and 2 sodas came to $22 which was about what I had planned on spending for a meal for 2.  The slices are very large, larger then other slices I've had from any other pizza-by-the-slice restaurant.  It was just enough to be a full meal without being too much.  The servers were very friendly and helpful too - quick and efficient.  

We ate out in the aforementioned outdoor dining area, and had a great time together.  The location was fun, with many people coming and going, and the music from the Fremont Experience was keeping us rocking in our seats.  The pizza was hot and tasty.  I give the pizza 3 out of 5 stars, and the atmosphere, locale, and staff the 4th star.  

I'm more partial to a New York style crust, a slightly thicker than cracker crust.  Pizza Rock was the extra thin crust style which is not my personal favorite.  The cheese was good, but average and the pepperonis flavorful but lacking any real oomph.  The best part for me was the sauce, which was a very light, and not overly tomato-ish which I find Sbarro's sauce to be.  Not my personal favorite, but quite good overall. 

I would go back for slices at Pizza Rock, as we all had a blast and the pizza was good.",fsLjz-J6Wqim0AR-hKFX4w,2,1,4,cxR6lRud8dLjmCoi9IAorA

5357378,2017-06-24,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Ok I'm writing the same review for both locations so here it goes again.!
Pizza Rock is the best pizza restaurant in the city of Las Vegas hands down. Pizza Rock was started by a guy named Tony Gemignani who is a Triple Crown winner of International Pizza Championships in Lecce, Italy. He is also the 2007 World Champion Pizza Maker at the World Pizza Cup in Naples Italy. He's the first American and non-Neapolitan to win. To start I recommend ordering the classic meatballs or the Honey Calabrese sausage. Both are delicious. As far as pizza goes the must try is called ""Sausage & Stout"" it's made with Honey Malted Guinness Beer Dough, Green Onions, Crushed Red Peppers, Beer Salt and drizzled with a Sweet Guinness Reduction. It's amazing  they only make 23 a day so hurry. Another favorite is the Old Chicago which is outstanding. I get it well done and I add pepperoni. 3rd on my list is the Honey Pie. It has Mozzarella, Calabrese Peppers, Serano Pepper's, Green onions and local honey  topped with fried caramelized onions.! A few other popular choices are the Cal Italia Gold Medal Winner with Asiago, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano and Balsamic Reduction! 
The Margherita which won the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy Has San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Sea Salt and EVOO.
Whatever you do don't go and order a cheese pizza, take a chance step out of your comfort zone and order 1 or 2 of their specialty pizzas. Better yet get some friends or small group and order 3 or 4 different pizzas so you really get the experience. It will change your entire view on pizza!    happy pizza hunting

We came mid afternoon after parking in the deck across the street. The hostess will validate your parking ticket upon departure. We went straight to the bar and were greeted immediately and given menus. Man, the menu is huge. My brother easily ended any indecisiveness by saying, ""We're all over this Sausage and Stout."" Done.

They are limited to 23 pizzas per day at $28 for a pizza that feeds two. You can add two pints of Guinness for $5. The pizza definitely had some interesting combinations and was an interesting pairing with the beer. Mainly, it was a salty/sweet clash. Mozzarella, beer sausage, fontina, and beer salt vs. Guinness beer dough, caramelized onion, and an almost overly sweet Guinness reduction. This brought out the crushed red pepper on the pizza and after following with the beer, the malty and burnt tones of the Guinness were accentuated even more. Again, an interesting combination which had me reaching for slice after slice.

We polished off the pizza and beer and with 15% Yelp check in discount, we left pleased and felt we got our money's worth. I'm looking forward to more of what Pizza Rock has to offer.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,0,0,4,HCSP28Xg_aChWdrZM-0Fbw

Anywho! My fianc√© and I came to Pizza Rock to see what all the hoopla was about! First of all, I totally understand wanting to be downtown by action, but wow I'm not really a fan of the parking situation! They do have limited spaces available right near the restaurant, but mostly you have to find parking in one of the garages around Fremont Street.

When we walked in the front door we were immediately greeted by three hosts. They were all smiling and genuinely seemed to enjoy their job! It was nice to see! We were sat at a nice little table for two within full view of the bar. I'll have to try sitting at the bar next time, everyone looked like they were having fun!

Our server was very nice and attentive. She made suggestions since it was our first time. We started off with the garlic garlic bread. Yummy!!! It came out piping hot on a bread board. The slices were nice and thick, nicely buttered with chunks of fresh garlic. So much carbs, but ohh so good!

The pizza we decided to try the La Regina. I wanted to try something different since I'm used to eating thin crust pizza. It took about 20-25 minutes to come out, which is typical if you want your pizza nicely cooked. The Regina was huge! Like a pillow!! It had the right amount of sauce, and the salami and arugula tasted fresh and delicious! I had not one complaint! 

Again, our server was very sweet and attentive without being overbearing. She kept my fianc√©s drink refilled, and made sure I was ok with the cider I ordered.

Dude.  Those meatballs are the bee's knees.  And even if bees didn't have knees, I would glue knees upon bees to illustrate the point of how good the meatballs are here.

Not to mention the pizza.  They have both a walk-up by the slice area, as well as sit down.  Their personal pizzas are excellent.  Their calzones are the size of footballs or very small babies, and full of cheesy, meaty goodness.  I covered the Bacon Bloody Mary in the ""Tips"" section, but if you didn't read that, get that too.

Downtown consistently pleases me with their food choices that have popped up over the last few years.  Pizza Rock is another fine example of ""good eatin'"", and I am all about this place.  And it's reasonably priced as well, especially happy hour.

5498947,2016-04-12,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I haven't drank as much of the Tony Gemignani Kool-Aid as some people. The rockstar pizzaiolo's claim to fame here is that he makes something like a dozen different styles of pizza out of six or seven different types of ovens burning different materials at different temperatures.

I'm a firm believer though that it's extraordinarily difficult to do a lot of different things and be great at all of them. Howard Johnson was a utility player for the New York Mets in the late 1980s. He was a third baseman by trade, but also played shortstop, second base, left field and right field. He was a good third basemen. He was terrible in the outfield.

Basically what I'm getting at is that Tony Gemignani is the Howard Johnson of pizza. He does a few styles of pizza really well. And a few others ... well, he tries.

The best of the bunch, by a long shot, is the sausage and stout pizza, topped with fontina cheese and infused with Guinness in the crust. It's made in limited quantities each day and is worth getting there early for. The Detroit Red Top is like a Chicago deep dish on steroids - order one of these and you'll be eating it for a week.

Somewhat less successful is the New Yorker pie - an interpretation of a classic that just feels... off. Maybe he's trying to elevate it. But the whole point of New York pizza ... if you're elevating it, you're doing it wrong.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,0,4,SzczzNBJvJcVdxgnDeIqmw
5503399,2018-06-12,6,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I decided that I wanted to spend my 40th Birthday in Vegas.  This was the first place we decided to come to for a little lunch before checking into our hotel.  We found parking outside right in front ($2.00 per hour) and walked inside.  

Walked up to the front counter and and was asked how many.  No smile or welcoming, just a blank stare from the ""hostess"" (Sunday, June 10th around 12:30pm).  She asked if a high top table would be ok, but I'm never a fan of high tops if other tables are available.  She led us to a regular table just to the left of the big rig truck.  She dropped off our menus and was on her way.  Sure as fuck wasn't friendly.  Anyways.....our waitress was super nice and made up for the nonchalant shitty vibe that the hostess had.  We ordered our drinks and my buddy arrived a few minutes after that.  He got his drink and then we ordered our pizzas.  We went with a Detroit Red Top with pepperoni, and a New Haven Lou.  Here is how they were.........................

New Haven Lou-  This one sounded great....white pizza with spinach, meatballs, and ricotta.  Unfortunately, it was just alright.  The crust was bomb (nice and blistered and charred on the bottom...great chew, great texture), but the toppings were kind of meh.  The ricotta overpowered everything, and got cooled down pretty quick.  The meatballs were sliced nice and thin, like I love, but even those were lackluster.  It kind of looked like gyro meat on the pizza and the meatballs didn't have much flavor.  The spinach was fine.  I think this pizza may do better with some of their red sauce.  We tried to power through this one, but left a few slices remaining and wound up giving them to a homeless dude across the street.  

Detroit Red Top-  If you come here, you should definitely get this!  I had this pizza previously at Tony's place in San Francisco last year on Father's Day.  It was bomb!  One of the best pizzas I have ever had!  Happy to say that Pizza Rock's version is right up there with his SF location.  It's a rectangular pizza cooked in steel pans from Detroit.  They use Wisconsin brick cheese, white cheddar, mozzarella and pecorino romano for the cheeses, bake it in the pan so that the edeges get all crispy and crunchy, and then layer the sauce on top once it's done.  WOWZERS!  This pizza is fantastic!  A tad oily on the bottom crust, but it was gosh darn delicious.  The blend of cheeses are incredibly rich and tasty, the sauce melds well with everything, and those toasted corners of hardened/crisp/burnt cheese are the best part.  If/when I come back to this location, or go to ANY of Tony's pizza joints, I will always order a Detroit Red Top.  Super delicious!

Like I said earlier, our waitress was awesome and on top of everything.  Prices were fair for what you get ($75 after tip for 2 pizzas and 2 sodas..I guess a little high?), and the pizza was legit.  Minus the ""hostess"", this was a damn good first stop in Vegas.  I will continue to think about that Detroit pizza for weeks/months/years to come.  Simply amazing!",6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA,6,4,4,wgeFCKrHEIsoZYblKRu_jw

- $2 off wines, draft beers and cocktails.
- $4 well
- $4 32oz PBR

PIZZA ROCK MEATBALLS ($4 for 3 balls during HH, $1.50 for each additional meatball):
http://bit.ly/2hDLZd1
Believe the hype folks, these tender meatballs were absolutely delicious!! 
Meaty, tender and no bready fillers. It comes smothered in this kick-ass marinara that our table couldn't get enough of. We kept dipping our fries, pizza crusts, calamari - everything we could use to get every last drop of that sauce. I'd return just for these babies.

COCCOLI ($12): Served with burrata and prosciutto.
http://bit.ly/2izk0rG
These addicting sea-salted fried dough arrived hot and oh-so-fluffy! Savory with a subtle sweet finish. 
- The melt-in-your mouth burrata starts to melt immediately as it touches the bread. 
- Throw in a generous pile of delicious prosciutto to elicit even more oohs & ahhs from our table. The perfect indulgence and great start to our meal.  . 

CALAMARI FRITTI ($12):
We got both the regular and the spicy calamari. Served with a marinara and spicy aioli dipping sauce. 
http://bit.ly/2iOTdej
- Fantastic crunchy batter that doesn't fall apart when you eat it.
- LOVE the delicious marinara!
- The calamari was really tender but the over-salting on the spicy calamari was hard to look past.

GARLIC ROSEMARY FRIES ($4 happy hour price):
http://bit.ly/2hyhlwP
Cooked just right (crispy on the outside and soft in the inside) and chock full of yummy fried garlic, what's not to like? 

CAL ITALIA ($7 happy hour price for personal pan size): Topped with asiago, gorgonzola, mozzarella, fig preserve jam, prosciutto & balsamic reduction drizzle. 
http://bit.ly/2irjTS5
The dough was very similar to our appetizer but with a nice char. I got it without the jam because I'm not a fan of sweets and it seemed like overkill when there's already a balsamic glaze as well.
- Wish there were more toppings on there, especially the prosciutto. My lil guy was a bit naked...

Definitely will return for the Coccoli and meatballs!",lsSiIjAKVl-QRxKjRErBeg,35,28,4,2t3MWzUgerr7nTymJgSCvQ

We came at lunch so it was not really busy and the service was just okay. I wasn't thrilled when my boyfriend and dad wanted to go back when my dad was in town visiting. I hesitantly agreed, so we went in during dinner time but early like 5pm ish. There were some open tables so we were seated right away. Our server was nice, but seemed kind of aloof but still managed to get our order right. I do like this place for the beer selection. They have a lot of different beers on tap and in bottles so it was nice to be able to have my favorite imported beer with my pizza.

There are many pizza choices on the menu but we opted for a New Yorker pizza. It had fresh mozzarella balls on it, sausage and fennel. It was seriously one of the strangest looking but best pizzas I have ever had. The pizza was not greasy at all, super tender sausage and fresh creamy mozzarella. It was seriously so good even though it was different. It is also a good size so make sure you have people to share with. Also the price point of this place is a bit high, no surprise because you are in a tourist area and its newer, but keep in mind the prices before ordering tons of pizzas. Also most of their pizzas are a bigger size, so inquire before you actually order, larger parties of 5-7 tourists could probably be full of 2 pizza for example.

Overall my second time here was much better then the first, between the service, ambiance and quality of the pizza. I would consider coming back if I am downtown again.",BIcfTJw4-76b9NuZUgpKIA,2,2,4,O4ymoGcSasqg46qM1GlkNA

But that has absolutely nothing to do with quality and taste of the pies they serve up here, which are on point.

Amazing choice! The crust is a hand tossed yeast dough, infused with Guinness beer, with a spicy sausage, caramelized onion and lots of cheese! The Guinness reduction drizzled on top was a great sweet balance to the spicy sausage and red pepper flakes.  We loved how original the pizza was!

CLASSIC CAESAR - Hearts of Romaine, Croutons, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Caesar Dressing.  I did not have any of this but the group loved it.

For pizzas, we got a variety so we could try different things.

MARGHERITA - San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Sea Salt and EVOO.  This was so tasty.  The crust was crisp and soft at the same time.  Good tomato flavor.  

NEW YORKER - Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, House Made Fennel Sausage, Pepperoni, Garlic, EVOO, Oregano, Pecorino-Romano and Ricotta.  Yum.  The sausage was spicy but tasty.  Loved all the cheese on it.

Chicago Cracker Thin Pepperoni - loved the thin crust.  Good pepperoni flavor.  Nice to having something thin with all of the thick choices.

Giant Sicilian Style House Made Focaccia with Pepperoni - this was delicous.  Even though it was thick, it was not heavy.  Definitely good for a big group.

THE VEDURA (VEGGIE) - Vine-Ripened Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Saut√©ed Spinach, Mushroom, Caramelized Onions, Garlic, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Shallots, Green Onions and Feta Cheese.  Our vegetarian really liked this.  Lots of good veggies on top, good flavor.

He apologized and offered it to us for FREE. As if that weren't generous enough, he also gave us a FREE order of meatballs. The crazy part is, our NY pizza arrived at our table a few minutes later and we never would have even noticed the mistake. I'm not sure how many other restaurants offer such wonderful service but Pizza Rock definitely deserves 5 stars.",zolJ74a05lmEAbm9KlY7Gg,2,1,5,MGCmDxJBLurdGbU_4yBD7w

  I know if my kids wrote the review, it would be 7 stars. It's noisy, trendy, great for groups, has a lot of visual appeal, service is very good. 
 Located across from Downtown Grand and a stone throw's away from the Mob Museum, on a mini restaurant row of a clean and quieter part of the 3rd street. 

 I've visited before with my work group and everyone left happy. Altogether, I've been here 4 times and last two I only ordered drinks while the rest of my party pigged out on giant pies, burgers and fries, hence the reason for downgrading the rating. I love the atmosphere, just can't get into the food here. It sounds amazing and looks good, just somehow misses the flavor. Now, if you are on vacation, all bets are off and nobody is watching the scale- that might do. But when you live five miles away and still have to fit into a pencil skirt in the morning- throwing caloric caution to the wind is only appropriate if the food is REALLY worth it. If it's just ok, I'll have a cocktail and call it a night. Of the things I have tried here, I would say calamari is my favorite. Not under or over fried and not full of shady fillers of fried celery and carrots. 
 Definitely more of an atmosphere place on which Pizza Rock delivers nicely.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,2,2,4,1RhYNwCJ2ifUgpA61uNlMQ

5656997,2018-04-30,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I have started avoiding all pizza except neapolitan 900-degree wood oven pizza, because making a great neapolitan is an art, and great neapolitans are like radiant mandalas of near-psychedelic ecstacy.

I had avoided Pizza Rock the first couple days staying at the Grand next door,  because during the day, the joint was empty - - and loud, and dark - - couldn't imagine sitting there at a table like a stooge.

The last night in Vegas, with the vintage hot rod show outside, needed some tucker so took a stool up front by the slice counter (thanks, Yelper Lauren T for this recommendation!)  and ordered the Sicilian slice of the day (deep crust - - foccacia?) and the Picante (basic 'American style' slice).

OH MY BLOODY HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GRACE were these slices great.   Pizza Rock is not so much pizza as art - - it is pizza as SCIENCE,  and the science at Pizza Rock is not myopic test tube, it is more like transcendent astrophysics.

The Sicilian had a crust that was solid and toothy, but then disassembled as you bite into it - - a crunch and a melt at the same time, with beautiful light delish tomato accent.   This is a pizza with a structure like the scaffolding that held Michelangelo up while painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

The Picante presented itself modestly - - simply a thinnish slice studded with eye-poppingly colorful toppings with bright white mozzarella blobs - - a slice from a larger pie, re-heated 30 seconds before being served - - and the message was clear:  at Pizza Rock they have the formula.  They know precisely what they are doing with the alchemy of crust and topping (and top, top ingredients at that) to create masterpieces of texture and flavor.

Not JUST art.   But also science.",oDftpTXngPupJl4HuVX29g,2,0,5,q4H1BuTx29tR98FIpXBbWA

5667369,2014-06-07,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Eh...it was fine.

We were hanging out watching the band outside the Downtown Grand and watched 395898 people get pizza here. I knew I remembered the name from Yelp and that it had pretty good reviews, so we decided to get a slice before heading up to our room.

We stood in the Take Out line, 3 people in front of us and it took a really, really long time. However, the guy inside was seriously hustling, so it wasn't a lazy thing, more a ton of people eating inside thing. I really wanted a basic slice of cheese, but they were out so I went with pepperoni.

Like I said above, eh..I thought it was a little too greasy, and nothing to write home about. I ate about a quarter and called it good. I think I would have liked the cheese better, but it's hard to say. Would I eat it again? Maybe, if it was late and there wasn't really anything else open. It was cheap, $3.75, so it had that going for it. 

I will say they had other, more interesting pizzas like a California and purple potato, so maybe those would have been better choices, but I think that maybe this place just isn't my cup of tea. I would say it is probably worth checking out and forming your own opinion though because between the 4-5 star reviews and how busy it was, a lot of people would disagree with my opinion on the place.",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,3,0,2,BwG-TWhRhLWKvVgdmMPwmA

5674647,2014-04-14,1,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Time to update my review after dining at Pizza Rock a 2nd time - this time for Sunday brunch.

On Sundays they now offer an ""Acoustic"" brunch, with live music.  My friend and I arrived just about 1pm and there was about a 10 minute wait for a table (it's a pretty large place, so this kind of surprised me).

Once we were seated I was a bit disappointed that we couldn't see the actual performers, but oh well.  We could hear him (them?) and it was decent.

It's a pretty standard brunch menu, but with a Pizza Rock spin on things.  I had a tough time deciding between the eggs benedict and the meatball hash, but decided on the hash (wish I'd have gone with the bene).  My friend ordered the french toast ambrosia.  I had the bacon bloody mary ($10) and she ordered the bottomless mimosas ($10), which were either orange juice, passion fruit or mango flavored.

Now, I didn't have the best experience the last time I ate here, so I've been hesitant to return.  Unfortunately, this time there were a couple of hiccups as well, but I am adding a star because these glitches were handled pretty well by our server.

So, my friend gets her food, but they don't bring my order.  The runner looks at the ticket and says ""looks like your meatball hash should be on the way.""  Now, I don't necessarily believe that they should be delivering one diner's order and leaving the other person without food, but they probably didn't want her food to sit in the window getting cold either.  

When I received my food, it was cold.  I  am guessing that it was ready when the other order was brought out, but the runner missed it.  Pretty disappointing, since I was starving - but I sent it back.  The waitress was very apologetic.  I wasn't upset, just hungry!

Since they were remaking my dish, the waitress brought a complimentary order of meatballs so I had something to snack on and didn't have to just sit there while my friend ate.  I was very appreciative and this was a great move by her!

Once my food came out, it looked nothing like the 1st order.  I think they had just messed up my original dish overall, because the 1st plate had no meatball, while the 2nd had tons of it.  There was a noticeable difference.  The meal itself was decent.  I probably wouldn't order it again, I prefer the more traditional hash.

My friend LOVED her french toast ambrosia.  It looked really good.  Something like 4 slices of french toast, made from their house made foccacia bread, and topped with TONS of fruit - strawberries, berries, bananas and cinnamon whipped cream.

My bacon bloody mary was ok, but for $10 I don't think I would order it again.  There was nothing really special about it.  The $10 bottomless mimosas (or sangria) are a much better option.  In fact, as it got closer to 2pm (when brunch ends), our server mentioned that she had the bartender make another pitcher of mango mimosa since my friend had not received any refills yet.  She made sure that she got a few more refills, even after 2pm.

Overall, the service was good.  Our server (Harmonie) was friendly and attentive and I appreciated that brought me complimentary meatballs when my dish was being remade.  They also removed my meal from the bill, which wasn't expected, but much appreciated.

I am still on the fence about this place - both times I've been, there has been quite a few hiccups.  They've been open long enough that there shouldn't be that many issues, but I know this stuff happens.  I just wish it would stop happening to me so that I could simply enjoy a meal here! :)",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,2,1,4,KMC5VO7LUXmS_xayKT5zEQ

They also carry the stiel (I think that's the brand if not it's close to that word) grapefruit beer in a bottle it's super refreshing like an alcoholic Italian soda. You can also get slices up at the front if you don't feel like sitting down and waiting.. The slices up front are a little bit bigger than what you would get from a regular pie.

Went on Saturday 4-16-16 at 6PM for dinner.  This restaurant is located on 3rd St. between Stewart and Ogden.  $30.17 got us a margherita pizza, a kid's spaghetti & meatballs, a caesar salad, and an iced tea.  

The $7 caesar salad was just about the best one I've ever had...it was cold, crisp, perfectly dressed, and it was zesty....almost spicy! It took every ounce of my almost non-existent self-control not to lick the plate. 

The $7 spaghetti and meatball from the kid's menu was a hit with my toddler.  He was covered in sauce and didn't even notice that I stole his meatball.  Sorry...not sorry.  It was like stealing candy from a baby...except it was a meatball.  

The $17 margherita neopolitan pizza was incredibly fresh-tasting.  It was rather soggy and could have used a bit more cheese but it was still enjoyable.  I think for the price I'd rather go to Blaze or Pizza Rev & get unlimited toppings, a crispier pizza, and I could probably get two for this price. 

Service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was super cool and chill.  This would be a great place to take out-of-towners or a date. Yay! I'm a fan!!",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,18,13,4,Rtm5Ylg03vjaVVsDQGxCEQ

5736743,2014-08-16,0,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I've had the pleasure of dining at Pizza Rock quite a few times and for the most part they are pretty good. They are a bit on the pricey side and service can be spotty, but the food is always on point and delivered hot and fresh to your table. The interior is pretty cool, it is large and open, there is even a semi-truck on the inside!

I'm a big fan of the Old Chicago pizza, the meatballs are delicious and the fresh ricotta is creamy and melts in your mouth. The Cal-Italia is an interesting choice if you are in the mood for something a bit sweet. All of the ingredients work really well together, despite sounding a bit odd. I've also tried the Burrata burger and while it was a good burger I think that Burrata is too delicate to melt on a burger. It's a cheese that you need to eat alone to really appreciate the flavor. I've also had their meatball sub and while I wasn't a huge fan of the bun, the meatballs were flavorful and delicious. The rosemary and sea salt garlic fries are a pretty good side as well.

They also have a counter right inside the door where you can grab a quick slice. I've spent many lunch breaks perched at the counter with a slice. Again, it's a bit pricey, but the slices are huge and you can try a variety of toppings. 

I think that Pizza Rock is a great addition to downtown. It's great for big groups and it's nice to have an artisan pizza restaurant within walking distance from work.",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,1,0,4,UhwDfp5tw4GgRLixDJt18w

That's pretty much what I remember from my recent trip here. Eight of us came to celebrate a friend's birthday, but it wasn't a great place to talk to everyone and catch up. We were literally yelling just to talk to person next to us. I think by the end of the meal we all gave up on talking to each other and just stared at the TVs playing music videos instead. In general the whole restaurant is very loud, but I think we were directly under a speaker, making it even worse. On the plus side, they were at least playing good music!  

As for the food, the pizza was just ""meh"".  Five of us split the mob boss, which is a Sicilian style pizza. The menu said serves up to 5 people and it did for us girls, but if you're really hungry, I would say it's good for more like 3 people. The pizza comes in a big rectangular pan and has super thick crust. I feel like too many pieces had more crust than topping which was disappointing. 

This place has just about every style of pizza one could dream of, so I'd be willing to try another kind. I'm sure there's got to be better pizzas than the Sicilian on the menu.",yvMQhKw2_dq-bgf3lOCjEg,1,0,3,-c2sucbuVnJcKIRC17bLig

We ordered 'The New Yorker' which is a 16"" pie with pepperoni, sliced meatballs, and mozzarella swirls. The pie took about 20 minutes to come out. After receiving the pie, we started to dig in and I saw that they were very generous with all the toppings. The mozzarella swirls tasted quite interesting, somewhat sweet and very creamy unlike any mozzarella I have ever had. I thought that the pepperoni were too oily and crunchy for my taste, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. Overall, the pie was tasty, but I thought that it was too pricey for a small pie. For a 16"" pie, it was $23, but with tax and tip, it came out to $30. 

I would try it out, but if I came back, I would definitely try something else!",iCggRg8YUw8JXTGh1FsdkQ,0,1,4,C-aua99f08q6EVhamtTgTQ

5837391,2014-01-12,2,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"I went to Pizza Rock with high expectations, based on some articles and reviews I had read, and the fact that it features international award-winning pizza.  But,  unfortunately, those expectations were not entirely met.

Italian Wedding Soup was very good spicy and hearty soup, but nothing like traditional Italian Wedding Soup.  It was more like Minestrone with medium-sized meatballs, carrots, celery, tomatoes, ditalini noodles, and basil.  I was mostly pleased with a Classic Caesar Salad that sported a good light Caesar Dressing with a little kick to it and a little sour flavoring, cold Romaine leaves, and lemony pieces of Parmesan sheets.  But it was in the all-important pizza department that I was somewhat disappointed.

A Three Cheese & Ham Pizza with extra cheese was very good except for the Parmesan powder tossed on top.  And the internationally recognized Margherita Pizza was excellent.  No complaints there!  But, with respect to the New Yorker, which was voted the Best Traditional Pizza in the World, I felt that the Ricotta Cheese and tomato sauce were overpowering and in too much supply, compared with the amount of sliced Mozzarella, sliced House Link Sausage, garlic, and pepperoni that shared the stage; and the crust was much thinner than I prefer.  

Overall, from my single experience, although the Margherita Pizza prepared here can definitely hold its own, even in the Las Vegas valley alone I would rank the other types of pizza I tried here behind Dom DeMarco's, Cosmopolitan's Secret Pizza, Metro Pizza, Settebello's, Biaggio's, and Enzo's.

The place has a nice spacious and informal ambiance, although it is rather dark inside.  Besides a large bar, white butcher paper is spread on white formica and black-edged tables.  Our server Allie provided friendly and very helpful service.  

The pizza sampled here was not at all bad.  It just wasn't as great as I thought it would be.

I like Neopolitana style pizza a lot.  After that, NY and Detroit style.  So since PR was known for their Neopolitana, I initially ordered that.  However, the waiter said that it was not really big enough for two ppl.  So we opted for the Cal Italia.  Great choice!  It had just the right amount of salty and sweet.  And the crust was incredible.  I think they use some sort of special flour.  Whatever it was, the chew was perfect.  

All of the pizzas look good, but things here are a bit pricey.  Though I think what we had today was worth it, I might  be hard pressed to pay almost $40 for a pie (the cost of a sicilian).  They do sell pizza by the slice though.  The basic slices were $4 each, which is on par with NYC.  But they also offered specialty slices like purple potato with rosemary and pesto.  I don't know if that flavor combination works, but I'm tempted enough to fork over the $6 next time.  And there's def going to be a next time!",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,1,0,5,UmjzmkeI-53li0uCtxq-FQ

Second thing that caught my eye was the awesome chalkboard sign in front of their doors that said ""Today's soup is beer.""  Sold.  

AMBIANCE  |  We walked in to a huge, high-ceiling, well-decorated and edgy pizza joint.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that there was a black semi-truck cabin sticking out of one of the walls.  The semi had a nice paint job with orange flames and added a nice touch to their edgy ambiance.  Their restaurant is large enough for parties and big groups and have multiple TV's on their walls and a couple above their bar.     

CUSTOMER SERVICE  |  We didn't receive the best service from the hostesses, they weren't the friendliest and most approachable.  However, our server was excellent.  She was really friendly and knew it was our first time there so she made suggestions on what to get.  She also checked on us frequently and made sure our drinks were always filled.  

FOOD & DRINKS  |  Because we had a late brunch, we only had room for fries and one pizza.  We chose the ""Downtown"" which was tasty and topped with mozzarella, pepperoni, bacon, some veggies and some really awesome linguica which could be mistaken for mini slices of pepperoni that curled up to look like little pepperoni cups.  The linguica was my favorite part of the pizza.  We enjoyed the truffle fries; truffle oil makes fries even better.  They had a nice selection of drinks at the bar and at least 10 types of beer on tap.  

I will definitely head back to Pizza Rock on my next trip to Las Vegas.  There are a ton of other things they offer besides pizza like Calzone, salad, Stromboli, pasta, burgers and desert.  They also have great operating hours (open till' midnight Sunday-Thursday and till' 2am Friday-Sunday)

My friends and I finally decided on an order of garlic bread and a The Vedura Classic Italian Pizza. The garlic bread came out first and was delicious! I appreciated that while the top of the garlic bread was nice and crispy, the bread itself was still soft. It also had cheese on it (automatic win). A little while later our pizza came out.

Im adding Pizza Rock to my craft beer list. The draft list was actually good (they had on La Folie for example) and so was the selection of bottles. They had everything from Pizza Port in California to Brooklyn in NYC.  

While the beer and pizza may be great, the service was not. Our waiter was very much in a rush , and after ordering a pizza, we realized that there was a late -night happy hour menu that he never told us about. I went to cancel the order about two seconds later and the waiter got incredibly agitated. He gave us such an attitude that another waitress came over and helped us out.

They have a ""pizza by the slice"" counter at the front of the restaurant, but if you have time I strongly recommend being seated and ordering a fresh pizza.  Like all ""PBTS"", it's reheated and never tastes nearly as good as a fresh one. 

Bonus:  They have 3 locations: Downton Las Vegas (Downtown Grand), Henderson (Green Valley Ranch) and Sacramento CA.",1Lh1ZVjBeliwP4E3CDb1UA,0,0,5,BhWujK6XuKhyMXBfGgBABQ

After complaining to the server about our burnt, soggy pizza, they were nice enough to give us a free box to take home. Sadly, this pizza was as burnt & soggy as the one we had.

Nothing usually tastes better than free, but not if the free thing is this burnt & soggy.

Hubby told the manager that from working in the kitchen for nearly 30 yrs., he knows this happens when the ovens aren't properly cleaned. Which is something that usually happens when a place is so busy that the cooks just rush through each order & can't find the time to clean the ovens between orders. The manager admitted it.

It was a busy night, so the service was just OK. Definitely not 1 of my fave pizza places in town. I liked Amore more. I'd probably go back for the Calamari. In my mind I've renamed this place to Calamari Rocks.",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,6,4,3,6m1gPTTBOZc_JWCV-L-QRg

I also like to peruse daily deal sites to see whats new and different in the area.  I am so over the Las Vegas Buffets so when I saw a Living Social Deal for this place, I scooped it up.  It was 29.00 for any antipasta, any pizza( except the 33.00 NY pizza) and one beer.  I had an additional living social coupon so I paid 24.00.  We also don't drink so we got a soda instead.  We also got a Caesar salad( 10.00) instead of an antipasta.  That was no problem.  My wife is from Milwaukee, the home of the best cracker crust pizza, so that's what we ordered.  It was a very thin crust pizza, but I wouldn't call it a cracker crust.  It didn't have that ""snap"" that a cracker crust has.  Nevertheless, it was a good pizza and so large.  We took a lot of it home.  The cracker crust pizza is cut always cut in squares. 

I really love the concept, numerous different styles of pizza at one restaurant.  Next time, I'm going to try the margarita and the NY pizza.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,2,0,4,FEVubcP2OYworcR37e2ZLw

The employees here are all very friendly and helpful when it comes to deciding on what you want to try. Service is quick and efficient. 
Sadly on weekend nights it can be a bit loud, but that's to be expected. They offer countertop eating and take out so you do have options if you don't want to eat inside. The decor is a bit random, but the food is great. 
One thing that I don't like is that they charge 50 cents for a side of ranch. If I'm paying $12+ for a salad I shouldn't have to pay for sides of ranch.

5967440,2016-05-08,2,3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,"Let's just say their staff and this includes their manager need some people skills. We went there one day for lunch to celebrate my co-workers birthday. We chose this spot because they have gluten free pizzas and my co-worker can't eat gluten. We arrive and the restaurant is semi busy but nothing crazy for St. Patty's day. We ordered three pizzas, one pepperoni pizza, one gluten free vegetarian pizza and a MARGHERITA pizza (one of the house specialties). First thing, the place wasn't busy. Let's make note of that. Secondly and this is a pet peeve of mines especially since I come from the hospitality industry, our server did not write our orders down. PEOPLE!!! I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, UNLESS YOU HAVE OVER 10 YEARS OF RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE THEN YOU BETTER BE WRITING DOWN ORDERS. And here's why...first pizza out was the pepperoni, 10 mins later the vegetarian pizza comes out. 10 mins later, we're still waiting for our pizza. We flag down our server and tell him that our pizza has yet to arrive. Before even checking to see what the status was on our pizza he says it'll be out soon and that's due to the restaurant being busy. So we wait, and wait, and wait. The guys have already eaten their pizza and the vegetarian is about half way through and still nothing. We flag him down again and he goes to look and claims someone walked off with our pizza. Yeah right. Keep in mind, there is no sorry yet. So we ask to see a manager. She comes by claims that she was just told this and she will have it out soon. and she will comp it off the bill? Not a sorry or anywhere near it. Any good manager would know to always apologize to the guest after hearing how their staff messed up a table. We kept telling her that we've been waiting and the server hadn't really down a good job but all she kept saying was I was just told this. By this time yes the restaurant had picked up but there was no way our pizza would have been overlook had the server stayed on his tables. He would have seen that pizzas were missing and he should have gone to the kitchen and asked them right away what the status was on our food and then gone back to check on it. 

On the plus side, food was delish and they had a semi truck inside the restaurant but with all that bad service that's not enough to encourage a visit anytime soon.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,4,2,2,oUmB0jnb3MlmOWdKuzhR9Q

Huge selection of IPAs and wine --- I knocked down a couple of the Imperial IPAs and at 8.9% alcohol, they took the edge off after a long day, haha. 

Menu is loaded with every type of pizza and Italian dish --- Chicago style, New York, thin crust, gluten free, etc. etc. etc. --- it took me forever to decide but I finally settled on the Carne Totiro and was absolutely delicious. 

I went back with a few buddies last month and we were not disappointed. We ordered one of their larger pies, loaded with meat and veggies and we couldn't finish. Great way to start the night!
