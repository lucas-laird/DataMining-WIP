My friend loved his NY Steak, which was cooked medium rare, just as he ordered it. I had the chicken tacos and enjoyed them. It's a fun, friendly place.",PWRJdCRafTE60OTkn3JCCQ,0,0,5,jQsEpp4Wd7T9vBxC52QP_A

Horrible place. The owner was using the word ""faggots"" all night, it was really classy, ""faggots""? wow. DO NOT GO HERE, SHARE YOUR MONEY & GOOD TIMES WITH OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS, THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE.",nwA6i8Z_qwRzjOFZ5RhgdQ,0,0,1,pNdAFKAvj3SEvi1v28Dorw

Ask about what to do and where to eat she will steer you in the right place.  Good to know a friend in Vegas.  Thanks Torri.,ZOnGX0X6fjlYPIswfR0H1Q,0,0,5,HcTFHpBwVFJiP5iACwRcRA

1330099,2017-09-02,0,nNV0E5Nve_dJ1uh_6nTK8w,I went late on a Thursday night. Lots of gamers and drinkers. The place is a bit divey but that's what I like. It was decorated like a tiki bar. Had a few pool tables and TVs. Stevie at grave shift is awesome. :) Neighborhood is a little harsh. I would go here often if it was closer to home.,5Bs1BZcD6_wo_sUiAGe7FA,0,0,5,kMZzvW6LmNk39wvjARlgCA

The staff were very friendly. The food was good and prices were right. The house wine was under $5. Good hang for locals.

When I called the bar I asked for a takeout order and the lady proclaimed that they don't do takeout orders! WHAT?!?!?! Its 2018!!

3410454,2012-11-11,3,nNV0E5Nve_dJ1uh_6nTK8w,"OH MAN! This place was really fun.

I came during karaoke night, and it is a really non-judgmental, laid-back karaoke scene here. 

We kicked off our experience with a nice pitcher of my NEW, old stand-by Hamms. After a few glasses, my friend decides he wants me to get up there and sing. Even though my voice was jacked up from laughing my a*s off all night! But he begged, so I decided to give the best rendition of Ginuwine's ""Pony"" I could muster.

They LOVED it, surprisingly! I had two guys ask me to go up and sing again. And they loved my cheesy dance moves that I had thrown in to mask my utter embarrassment. Who would have thunk it, huh? 

While there, some crazy, super drunk guy accused the bartender of taking his leather jacket. Mind you, she's like 5'2, small and seemed really nice. The dude flipped out and punched one of the game machine screens!! Luckily, two regulars quickly stepped in to subdue him and take him out.

They have a good selection of tap beers, some pool tables and some slot machines (in the bar and a few stand alone). They had a small menu of some bar snacks, like egg rolls. I liked the island decor, with the huge fish tank in the back. Good times.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,4,3,5,QbN5dyNRKisknvIJ-k0SbA

The drinks were poured nicely (read: heavy) and the beer was cold. What more can you ask for? Bottle service you say? Go to the strip for that you fool. Give this place a try, classic Vegas ambiance style bar. Thumbs up!",CwzhFRwIkYFGkaggG0sTlA,2,1,4,MBx6NJxBGMAbr5MOnlwnhQ

Definite locals
They do allow smoking, and you can tell they fry a lot of food in the kitchen; billiards, pool, video gambling; fair prices, no happy hour; probably won't make a directed effort to come back",QasfZU1HgCW4LNU8AFFfwg,0,0,3,GB5D4nRQMXwM-47__4a8qw

I really like this place.  Very open, spacious, clean, with a ""tiki hut"" kind of feel...

Tero, the bartender, was incredible, pouring REALLY strong drinks!

Drinks are super cheap and good here.  I can't believe I waited so long to come out.  
I'll go back again soon.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,1,0,4,TA9A-pBrb7TNrVJ48kHYGg

They had music and karaoke but construction has halted that. Pretty decent internet based jukebox and plenty of TV's to watch the game or what ever else may be playing.

It's a typical neighborhood poker bar with a tropical theme (love the small waterfall) and tiki decor. Any place that offers a match play is a winner in my book, though we didn't try the food.
The bartender offered to serve the Blue Moon with orange juice, which is also a winner. 
This is a Steelers bar, and as such, promos and prizes are offered during all games.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,1,4,DHuiD18DBE3l18doHidKKg
