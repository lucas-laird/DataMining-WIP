40487,2015-12-11,0,7qFtiPg0gdbk911_mj6LoA,Great place and service. I was there back in September with my wife and her uncle for her birthday and I had a broken hand. I ordered the steak and the waiter (Ken) took my plate and cut up the steak for me for my convenience even though I didn't ask for it. The place was great and I would go there again.,H1AaXkvekqqN5UXXGMNV7w,1,1,5,aZZxknZWkj99d3Ty3v15zg
82074,2011-10-22,0,7qFtiPg0gdbk911_mj6LoA,"Went down to Boulder Station to catch Little Feat in concert.  It was an incredible show and ended at the perfect time to grab a nice late evening dinner on a Friday night.  My husband and I noticed The Broiler, checked out the menu and got a table with no problem at 9:30pm.

Service was superb.  The hostess was a very sweet woman who greeted us with a bright, interested smile, held the door for us, showed us the salad bar, and seated us in a cozy booth as we had requested.  The bus boy was one of the best assistants I have seen.  Always present without stalking us, clearing things away seconds after we finished with them, and having carry out bags ready to go, eager to put our leftovers in the stack of containers he brought for us.  The waitress was one of those women who could really maintain control of her responsibilities while being pleasant and inviting.  She genuinely seemed happy to see us, just like every staff member we encountered at The Broiler.  Service was quick, ultra-efficient, and super friendly.  Ambience was calm and relaxing.

I chose the shrimp dinner and the waitress offered various ways for preparation: Panko, battered, or broiled.  I went with Panko (fried in breadcrumbs).  Excellent choice. $25

My husband picked the swordfish.  Also offered several preparation options, he chose blackened.  He loved it. $30

But the biggest surprise of the night was the incredible soup and salad bar.  This was actually included with our low priced entrees!  We each took a huge helping of the  New England Clam Chowder with those cute little hexagon crackers and then created our own salads of iceberg lettuce salad with bleu cheese crumbles and dressing, tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, croutons....they had so many toppings.  It was fantastic.  I then tried another salad they had up there: broccoli and chicken in a light cream sauce.  It was unreal.  I literally could have just eaten this all night and I would have been satisfied.  This broccoli and chicken salad was a dinner starter for me but I can't help but think it would also make for a refreshing summer lunch.

The selection of breads were also delicious.  We really liked the warm pretzel bread.

Sodas were crisp.  Espressos were perfect.

Perhaps we have been eating on The Strip too much.  The Broiler was a really nice find with a hometown feel and an affordably-priced menu.  We will definitely visit again.",qTllTILQ6JVifkO-5ezm2Q,2,1,5,aorsFhh0jIJlmCweO4cs_A

The Thanksgiving dinner was set--no substitutions. It included the salad and soup bar, which was nothing special but okay. The choice of entrée was turkey or prime rib--4 of us chose turkey--and the vegetables regardless of entrée were (yuck) Brussel sprouts and a sweet potato dish with burnt marshmallows on top. What chef would choose to serve Brussel sprouts without allowing a substitution--like maybe peas?  No dessert was included in the dinner price. The fact we were willing to pay extra to satisfy our taste buds which were yammering for pumpkin pie did not matter--there was no pumpkin pie--or even mince--available.

We sat in Stephen's section and had a couple visits from Kenneth the manager just to make sure everything was to our liking.

Cons:
-Pricey in some areas
-Service might take a while
-Food takes time to get prepared
I ordered the Surf and Turf, and even though I waited, I still got to eat because there's the salad bar! The Salad Bar was decent, it had salad, it had soup, it worked as an appetizer. When I got the Surf and Turf, it was the best! I tried the steak and it was cooked to perfection! The Lobster was really filling, it was just delicious! Then they asked if I wanted dessert, ""What do you have?"" I asked. Then they bring me a cart full of all the desserts they had.

1372819,2010-05-13,0,7qFtiPg0gdbk911_mj6LoA,"As the first Yelper stated great steakhouse!

 Cozy, dim lighted atmo. 
 The variety of fresh baked bread includes a rosemary sourdough, raisin bread (not my fav.) and a Deelish soft fresh fat warm yummy pretzel (accompanied with unsalted butter).  

Wine menu is offered ( and passed up).
Dinner menu has about a dozen entrees, the entree includes on side and the buffet soup & salad bar.

I decided on the Porter house Pork Chop ($25) with Mashed potato as my side and my hubby picked the Seafood combo platter($28) and side of French fries. each additional side if $5. But it's really not nessasary.

after our friendly server took our order I went to check out the salad bar.  WOW, was I impressed! started off with the regular Iceberg, then a Garden Mix, followed by a Creamy Dill Shrimp salad, Deelish and colorful Crab Salad, Also Plain but tasty Tuna Salad. Just as you pass down a ways, the nicely diced and pretty shredded veggies that make your build-it-yourself salad look oh so gourmet.  Salad Buffet concluded with a Minestrone soup and my FAVORITE Creamy Asparagus and Crab soup. SOOO GOOOD (chunks of realllly yummy crab mmmm)

Ok, so our Pork shop was HUGE, smashed potato's were real and yummy....
My husbands seafood platter was disappointingly all fried but he did chose to substitute the oysters and scallops for more Orange Roughy and HUGE shrimp. 

""First time I've ever been full off shrimp"" is what my meat and potato man said to me. 

I'm sure we will be back, although this kind of restaurant is a treat for us Parents on a budget. (we were on a date night just FYI)

Our dinner was about $62.00 including tip but we did not splurge. The Surf & Turf was a bit steep at $63. and Lobster tail about $48.  But I bet it's awesome.",hYan1ohCp1Vg58cNwPhV5g,6,5,5,CPfsPKzBMDP1WhULxjfysA

Our server was really sweet and answered all our questions easily. We ordered scallops to start, a New York strip with a Gorgonzola crust, a side of asparagus and a side of creamed corn. Our scallops took a while to come out, a couple that sat down before us got their food before we even had our first course, and our scallops were underdone, we still ate them but wish they were a little more cooked. Our steak was cooked perfect. We got the gorgonzola CRUST, it's really just melted cheese on top. Creamed corn and asparagus were cooked and seasoned really well.

The crab cake appetizer was very good and the free salad bar with soups and fruit was a nice touch with the entree...  I do admit, it is kind of strange to have a salad bar in a nice restaurant though.  The only big disappointment was the main course.  My filet that I ordered medium came out more well done and was charred.  Maybe do what another reviewer says and order it one level below what you actually want.  I suffered through and ate it, but I would not do it again.  I should have sent it back for sure and will if I ever go there again!  If I could make another recommendation I would say go to Sonoma Cellar at Sunset Station.  The filet there was absolutely magnificent and the prices are just a few dollars more.  No free salad bar at Sonoma Cellar but the salad bar at the Broiler was not worth the horrible filet.",nvMesqKS16ut01Fk_U-WDg,0,0,2,XBID7UDHe60OJgYyI4dC8A
1645710,2015-08-11,4,7qFtiPg0gdbk911_mj6LoA,"Every casino has some sort of attempt at a classy steakhouse- this is Boulder Station's. It's not bad for what it is, with a decent selection of steaks and seafood. Prices are low, quality is higher than the pricing leads you to expect, and the service is on par with a non-casino steakhouse (in other words, good).

There are quite a few apps to pick from- the escargot is my recommendation, but the scallops are good too. Interestingly, they have a large soup and salad bar as the main focal point of the dining room, and it's free with most of the featured entrees (or $14 a la carte)- lots of fresh veggies to pick from, two soups, and it's unlimited.

The prime rib is a popular entrée here, order early or be prepared to settle for medium. If you're a rare-or-nothing kind of person, the porterhouse is a good backup. Just don't gnaw on the bone like a caveman.

TIP: If you have the BS players card, you will get quarterly coupons via mail for $20 credit here ($40 minimum)!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,4,3,ySrjHbrtxqhHqd40_H7IGg

I'm not even sure what they do to it, and I really don't care.
Allow me to digress for a moment: My best friend and I drove up to Boulder Station to see UFO at The Railhead (huge fans for 35 years).We arrived a day early and felt like having a really good steak dinner and we were about to venture out of the hotel when several people told us about The Broiler. ""It's right downstairs, pass the slots, make a right and it's in the corner"" 

We find it no problem and walk in, they meet us, greet us and seat us, we look around, wow, what a blast from the past, this place is cool, an old school steakhouse vibe. Everyone was very nice. We both order ""The Delmonico"". Now, understand, my friend of 35 years is not only a food critic, but he does all of the cooking in his family and can sometimes be hard to please. When our plates arrived, it was love at first sight, they were very well presented, the smell was carnivore heaven. They did some buttery, crispy thing on the outside and perfectly tender and melt in your mouth thing on the inside. This was recommended by our waitress and it was their priciest piece of meat, I think we paid $60.00 each but would've paid more. If you ever get the opportunity, tell them Handsome Joe sent you.

3006645,2015-05-20,8,7qFtiPg0gdbk911_mj6LoA,"Came here for dinner on Monday evening around 5:45 PM for a reservation for 10 people.  We were seated in a private room, which was very nice because my cousin knows a few of the people who works there.

They have a salad bar up front so you can pick and choose what you want from there once you place your order at the table.  I went and got some olives and sliced cucumbers so I looked like I had some kind of vegetables on my plate.  Although, I did sprinkle bacon all over my veggies, so I'm not sure if they would still be considered as veggies by that time.

For starters, I ordered the crab cakes because I enjoyed the ones we had at Grand Lux Cafe so much, but we came to find out that it wasn't even close in comparison so we were pretty disappointed.

I ordered the queen's prime rib which is a 12oz, instead of the king which is a 16oz steak.  I asked to have my steak cooked medium rare, which it was.  The prime rib was well prepared and tasted much better compared to the crab cakes.

Auntie Bev had the 6 piece oysters on half shell as her appetizer and an order of oyster rockefeller as her entree.  I am not an oyster fan so I told her I didn't want to try them.  She said she preferred the raw ones over the rockefeller because the rockefeller  ones weren't too tasty.

Auntie Ann ordered the escargots as her appetizer.  I tried a piece and it was quite salty.  Although, I've never had it anywhere else before so I don't have anything to compare it with.  She had the crab legs as her dinner and she seemed to kind of enjoy it, but I had too much to eat already so I told her I wouldn't have any.  Everyone else seemed ok with their meals, I guess.

We decided to order the creme brûlée for dessert.  Auntie Ann finished one to herself, while Auntie Bev and I shared one.  I guess we were all in the creme brûlée mood this trip.  Their creme brûlée was probably the best thing from our meal.

Honestly, since Vegas offers so many choices when it comes to fine dining, I wouldn't make my way out here for the food.",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,11,9,3,UgLESzygHVLFIuhXfXV_sA

I was starving and somewhat desperate so I decided to try ""The Broiler"", one of the biggest mistakes of my life. We first have to wait 20 minutes to be seated (not too bad), but once we actually get to our take it took our waiter 10 minutes to even greet us and 15 more minutes to bring us our beverages. Finally when we got around to ordering I decided to get the porterhouse steak and the lobster Mac and cheese. I specifically ordered it to be crusted with blue cheese and cooked blue(under raw) with two different sauces on the side. I also got the salad bar which it was nothing special. The soup tasted like something from a soup can. So as I'm eating my soup and salad, my mac and cheese comes out shortly after....I'm eating and still waiting for my steak assuming it was coming soon since I wanted it served with my mac and cheese.  50 minutes later my steak is still not in my belly, nor on my table...so I flagged down the waiter which didn't even come near our table for at least 20 minutes. Once I told him how long we've been waiting her rushed to the kitchen. Brought me out a luke warm medium rare steak with no blue cheese and no sauces. This was seriously the worst service and experience I've ever had at a steak house.

Thursday night with no reservation I walked right up and was seated without a problem.  I went straight to the drink menu, skipped over the wines and ordered an aptly named Asian Persuasion martini.  It was wonderfully sweet.

I ordered the filet mignon, butterflied, medium.  It was to die for, to me the perfectly cooked steak.  It wasn't burnt on the outside and it was juicy and tender on the inside.  I unapologetically enjoyed every bite of it.  I didn't order any sides seeing that I was alone and I know they came family style.  However, if you order an entree here you can have the soup and salad bar, so for me, that was a better option.  I didn't get a salad but it looked well taken care of, instead I opted for a delicious cup of split pea soup.  Now I'm not a soup expert but I love split pea and this to me was very good.  It had huge chunks of ham in it and it was very thick.  They also gave me the traditional station bread basket.

Since Carve at the Eastside Cannery has gone downhill recently and Billy Bob's is gone at Sam's Town, this is probably the best steakhouse on the Boulder Strip.

The Broiler has a nice classic steakhouse ambiance, with dark colors and low light. There are nicer places for a special occasion, but The Broiler is nice enough and romantic enough to serve for most people. The soup and salad bar takes away from the fine dining experience, but adds to the value.

The salad bar is one of the biggest pluses for this steakhouse, as the offerings are fairly high quality. You can load up a Caesar salad with all the topping you want, though it might fill you up before your entree arrives. I always get a huge scoop of their shrimp salad every time I come here, as it is delicious and the best offering at the salad bar. The chicken and broccoli salad is also very good, but the crab salad is made with imitation ""krab"", bleh... The soups are always good and their cream of mushroom soup may be the best I've ever had (unfortunately they only have it one day a week).

Their steaks are reasonably priced, in the $20 to $30 range, and they are fairly good, but none of them will blow you away. They will blacken the steaks and provide house made sauces at no charge, which is also a big plus. They have an excellent peppercorn sauce and Bearnaise. All meals also include the endless soup and salad bar, so even though they don't include a side dish this place provides some pretty decent deals.

If your not a steak eater their roasted chicken and salmon are fairly good to. The salad bar cost $14 ala carte, so if your not that hungry pay the extra $4 and get the chicken for $18 and take your entree home. The chicken is always juicy, even the next day, and my wife usually does this as the salad bar fills her up.

If you like to have a big salad and soup before your steak, this is the place for you. If you live nearby and want to go out for a decent steak or a special occasion, The Broiler is worth considering.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,5,0,4,msixQCujAsIqc_mOZXw3zA

The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and tender as all get out, my husband had Porterhouse and it was super. We tried a few appetizers, the shrimp cocktail is great (huge shrimp & fresh) The lobster Bisque was not so great (but that's just my taste , as my fiance gobbled it up). The salad bar is wonderful, very large variety of items and nice soups. One could fill up on just the salad bar & a appetizer !! The service is great as well. I will be going here regularly for sure. They also have a special of 4 different entrees plus soup&salad bar for 24.99... I am going to try that next visit. I love this place !!",n0WGfNDEVZt_qQ9YoT4uTQ,1,1,5,FHYuXR-xN15f9m--Cb3kgg

The waiter, Marco, who was very interesting just to chat with, was friendly, helpful and so very nice, next time I'm in town and eat here I am asking for him, he made my evening.  Marco gave our party of 4 excellent service.

Now, the sign outside was misleading because it did not state that the special pricing on the beef dinner did not apply to dinners on Saturday or Sunday, but Marco made paying full price okay.  I wish I could pick 2 reviews A-OK and Yay I'm a fan.",nXqO234KU_4JOaxcnxP0iw,0,0,3,01NqOoGVDSaFZyc16w4wFw
5513359,2013-03-24,1,7qFtiPg0gdbk911_mj6LoA,"I have been to the Broiler off and on over the past few years.  My meals have ranged from good to really good.  The way I eat has also changed quite a bit over those years.  From eating like a fat kid to eating clean and restricted.  This place gives you the opportunity to do both.  The salad bar has been touted as being the best on the Boulder Strip (not sure if that says a lot) and the prices are comparable to the other steak houses in the area.  So, to start off my review: I'll give you the reason we came here this night.

I have family in town for the Easter / Spring Break and in ""celebration"" we went out to dinner.  We, as most families are, never can agree on where to go and what to eat.  So, when all else fails, a steak house is the most agreeable place to go.  

*Side note:  This is my 3rd steak house that I have been to in the last 3 weeks and earned me the MEATHEAD BADGE here on Yelp!

And, as I have stated in previous reviews, we eat early.  Our reservations were made for 5:30 P.M. on Saturday, March 24th.  And, per our family, we show up at 5 pm.

**2nd side note: In my family if you're 15 minutes early, you are actually 15 minutes late.

- We meet my family in the restaurants waiting area.  Where we are immediately seated at a nice spacious table.  Plenty of room for the 7 of us.  The table was set up very nice and the atmosphere was pleasant as well.  It was lit well but still had an ambiance that you could have a romantic dinner here, if the occasion ever came.

- As we were checking out the menu, and after our drink order was taken, we were feasting on the complimentary bread.  The best pretzel bread ever, by the way. 

- The majority of our table went with the $25 special they had going.  You could choose: prime rib, filet, chicken or salmon, which comes with a side of green beans.  It also gives you access to the A.Y.C.E. salad / soup bar and a dessert (either a piece of Lemon Cake or Chocolate cake).

- We took advantage of the salad / soup bar.  The chicken gumbo was great.  A little too spicy for some but perfect for me.  

- The meal came out shortly.  I can only comment on the Prime Rib.  It was a little tough and had some cartilage issues.  But, it was still cooked to order and edible.  I wasn't a huge fan of the green beans but that is par for me. 

- Dessert soon followed and the presentation was awesome.  I wanted to take a picture but I got a little too gun-ho and just jumped into it.  But, take my word, it was presented well and it tasted even better.  The dessert took the experience from 3 stars to 4 stars for me.

And, our waiter... John P. (I think that is his name... if not, I'll look at the receipt later and edit) was awesome as well.  He knew his stuff and was patient for those of us who are a little picky.  He was able to answer questions and was very witty.  He wasn't over the top, as some waiters can be.  So, he added to my 4 star rating as well.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,4,4,4,yyIQp0B1jbT_xhVFw134Fw

Noticed a commercial for a prime rib special( $14.99) and it jogged our memory and we jogged.....well not exactly.....we drove over for a very nice meal at a great price. We did the 14oz prime rib special that came with their above average salad bar, mashed potatoes, broccoli and a basket of bread. I also had a very nice flight of wines for the bargain price of $10. Overall prices were very reasonable and the sides were only $5. which is a bargain for a LV steakhouse. A terrific restaurant with a nice soft ambience at a decent price. Will def put this place on our steakhouse rotation though it is a jaunt from Summerlin. Def worth the drive.So ono.",Q3Y0AjsTpuJuQ-TWZOlVzg,0,0,4,_R5uZSiHZNZz-fupJtb8qg

The hostess had informed us twice before entering ""you do know this is a steakhouse, right?"" After that I already had mixed feelings about how our experience would go. And to my surprise, ha! - I was right. It was not how we had expected the night to end! Our service was very bad. And not to mention our food, it was to be completely honest, boring at the very least. There was no presentation in our entrees which all were pricey. You'd expect it to be dressed up nicely on their plates, but no you won't get that here. This restaurant lacked culture and customer service. When I dine at a steakhouse, that's what I would expect from their end, to get an above and beyond experience. So no, I definitely will not be coming back here in the future.
