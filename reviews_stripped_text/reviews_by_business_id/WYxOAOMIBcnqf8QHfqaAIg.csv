What server came by almost immediately and provided the desperately needed coffee. We each got a senior fit fare omelette made with egg whites. Each of us found the omelette to be delicious. It was filled with veggies and an appropriate amount of cheese. Neither of us could finish the omelette because it was so large. Next time I would consider getting one for the two of us. And the total bill came to just over $10 a head counting the cost of the coffee and the tip. Highly recommended for breakfast.,GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,2,0,5,C8j6wWbhiVxgSpUU0I-kLA

They got one star because my plate was filthy with dried on food. I got the chicken fried steak with broccoli and mashed p. There should be nothing RED on my plate, yet there was dried on marinara (obviously made it through the dish wash machine)....so I spent a few minutes deciding what to do and I move the chicken and there is more dried on food. This was OBVIOUS AND LARGE, I mean how do you pick up a plate to put food on it and NOT NOTICE BRIGHT RED DRIED ON FILTH??? so I set my plate aside and watch my GF eat.  I dont want the food replaced, this has turned my stomach. The waiter comes and takes my plate and assures me it will be taken care of, then the bill comes and nothing is comped except the plate WHICH I DID NOT EAT A BITE FROM. When someone messes up that badly, I expect at least to have my GFs meal, or the drinks comped. Nothing. Next time I will walk out right when that nasty food was served, which was our first intuition. SO THEN, we go to check out and the waiter tells me we cant use our military discount because we already used our discount by returning the disgusting food. This about made my head spin, so I had to argue with him till he miraculously discovered that he could indeed still give us our military discount. Needless to say I will never come back. Had the manager bothered to come address the issue and appologize instead of just glaring at me from across the restaurant I would have given 2 stars.

Server greeted us with ""what do you want to drink""
Really? That's hospitable. Server forgot my orange juice so I had to ask another server to bring it to me almost 10 minutes later.

I ordered some berry pancake and egg combo. The pancakes were ok. The were prob the only edible thing on the dish. My turkey bacon was cold. I told her my boyfriends was cold too but she only brought me bacon and not him? Also she asked for my bacon back on a side plate? I didn't even tel her my hash browns were cold too and my eggs were sitting in a pile of grease. It was quite inedible. I pushed the eggs and hash browns to the side of the table to the edge and the sever didn't take the hint. I felt like sh*t having to pay for food that was that bad. There was no manager in sight to even remotely fix anything. 

My server Alicia W had some good moments with us, but not enough to save this experience.

Someone at my table said ""it's dennys what do you expect""

To me that aggravates me because ""just dennys"" is taking my money and other people's money for what? Just because it's dennys doesn't mean you can't have a good meal or experience, I don't know why it's hard.

I really was in the mood for healthy food and ordered the Wild Alaska Salmon Skillet. It arrived within a few minutes of ordering and it was sizzling hot!

We placed our order. Whole waiting another couple sat near us. We waited about 15 minutes with no food, not so bad, but the other couple had yet to even be talked to. They ended up leaving. We waited close to half an hour for our food. No apologies about the wait or any acknowledgement about our well being.
The fries with the burger were cold but then burger was warm.

My plate had eggs with it. I specifically asked for over medium eggs.
I receiver what looked like the correct eggs, but were actually over easy eggs turned upside down to look like over medium eggs. Very disappointed.

Before I order the food I went to restroom wash my hand wow homeless man was in restroom and he was bleeding and he told me he was there since last night, informed server Linda about that guy they didn't do anything 
Also when we get hot tea my cup was so dirty 
I asked her and she gave me another one that also the same

We came in and were seated right away, our waitress  (Linda, I believe) was sweet & totally on top of making sure we were alright, food was good, not the worst Denny's I've been to. Everything was cool up until the end of our meal.
My only serious problem was when i went to pay our check. My total was $19. 
I left two dollars on the table since it was the only cash i had, and i put $2 on my card for the rest of the tip. 
When I was walking out I noticed that (Lilly, I think) the hostess charged $26 to my card?
What?! I wrote in the total on the receipt, $21. 
She charged me $7 for gratuity. On a $19 tab?
I went back in and pointed it out to her & she didnt even seem shocked. Just the dumb ""oh, my bad, i thought thats what it said""
2....7.... 21....26....? How do you confuse that?
I ended up leaving it because I was too annoyed to deal with her & our waitress was super awesome. 
But still, seriously take a second glance at your receipt after you pay. 
As for you little hostess, you need to be more careful when handling peoples money. Some people cant afford a $7 tip on a $19 tab.",v-_v3E31LMLssVoQPIa1Ww,0,0,2,jlekF7GZMB6ljmm5_-PmuA

Linda, our waitress, would do much better in tips if she wasn't so surly and maybe tried to smile. We were the only patrons at that time, yet it was like pulling crocodile teeth to get coffee in the first place and refills thereafter. When I asked for a menu, she shouted from across the room, ""There's a whole bunch of them right here,"" then gave me a look like I was an imbecile for not knowing that the waitress couldn't lower herself to bring menus to the customers' tables. Silly me, I just assumed, given that's how it's been done at every Denny's I've been to since...well...ever. She made me feel like an unwelcome burden. 

Here's a tip, lady: Ya got one job. As a customer, I'm it. If you can't bother to take care of me and even pretend to be friendly, find another line of work. Maybe something that requires deep sea diving or solitary confinement.
