I live 30 min away but happened  to be in the area so I decided to stop by finally. The prices are great, ranging from $5.99-7.99. No faux meats but vegan cheese and sour cream plus plenty of veggie options to choose from. The only reason I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5 is they were out of the beer battered avocado, and tacos made with that is is what I had my heart set on. I wasnt a huge fan of the enchiladas I ordered, so I ended up ordering some crunchy potato tacos as well because I refused to walk away dissapointed lol.

4934745,2016-12-07,2,9RQznFcE6Mhslaw0WlJ3jA,"We came here to try their vegan option and we it is great that they had choices. For those of you that are vegan and want to try some vegan food, i would definitely recommend that you try this place, although it only is a three in my book mainly because I was not inspired by anything here.

Ambiance- a small place with two tables for four and three for two.  Your basic low budget seating and if they get busier I wonder how they will fit anyone. Located in a small strip mall off Durango and Spring Mountain Road. The place has a fast food feeling to it. 

Food- we had both vegan options and meat options. 

Meat - we had the Carne Asada Burito and the  Carne Asada Tacos.  I would say that the meat burrito was basically unspectacular and quite boring, yet edible. I found nothing special in the taste or the texture. I felt like it was something I could make my self.  Same with the Carne Asada Taco. I mean you can go to Taco y Taco and get some awesome meat tacos brimming with juicy taste and aroma and that is to me a much better deal.

Vegan - we ordered the Vegan Enchiladas and the Veggie Crunchy Potato Tacos. Well, if the meat was unspectacular, I can tell you I was waiting anxiously to try the vegan dishes. I was dreaming that they would be created with care and passion, full of zest, juicy, morsels of vegan goodness.  What I got was unceremoniously a very uninteresting pile of food that well, would not even be considered a pile, more like lilliputian than anything else. Definitely edible, however, so is dry wheat toast.

Ambiance - Donde esta?  I mean, no air conditioning, bland tables, no accoutrements, and really, unimaginable.

Service - We were the only ones here at about 2:00 pm on a weekend.  And, it took a seriously long time, like over 20 minutes to get our food. 

I say, vegans deserve a much better choice than this place, however, you have to try this place, if not for all the other 5 star reviews from others... You decide.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,6,3,g4yRKzy_zg_ntwANMrO4IQ

It was a disappointment to discover that they no longer offer the homemade juice options, but the vegan food still tastes great! Hands down, they have the best vegan nachos in town. I highly recommend their vegan nachos, crunchy potato tacos, & cilantro lime mushroom taco/burrito. I can't speak about the carnivorous side of the menu because I have never tried it nor will I ever try it in the future. The vegan side of the menu deserves 6 stars though!

I will say upfront their food is so tasty and delicious but the running of the business lacks and needs much work. Their vegan options are absolutely amazing and delicious but that's if they have their food items available....

My 1st visit they were out of the mushroom tacos and crispy avocados so I opted for the zucchini poblano tacos and they were delicious, enough for me to return. On my 2nd visit, they again were out of the mushroom tacos and crispy avocado so again, I opted for zucchini tacos. Delicious but now I'm starting to question the ability of the employees running this store and maintaining a full stocked menu.

Today I came for lunch at 12:45 and they're closed. Not sure what's going on with this spot. It's under a new owner with a new name but I can see they are experiencing some difficulty in their business operation.

It's not a full out dining experience with full service, a waitress , the music, the ambience , the bar serving margaritas , etc 
I believe they don't even serve alcohol in fact
