2059821,2015-07-10,0,Rv1IiQaIIDunqzS8dSvHCw,"A mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that offers delicious Thai and Hawaiian-Thai fusion dishes. The spice levels are no joke, especially the ""Thai hot"" spice level.

There's not a ton of room to dine in; there are about 3 small round tables that could fit 2-4 people, and  the largest table set (2 square tables set together) could fit maybe 6 people. I'm guessing most of the business is through takeout or delivery.

The chicken katsu with Thai peanut curry is a great fusion that adds some Thai flavor to the staple chicken katsu curry, savory with just a bit of sweetness.

The hotter-than-hell fried rice is very flavorful, and when the spice really kicks in around the 5th mouthful, it's like eating a dish of delicious lava. When owner, Rodney, states both ""hotter-than-hell"" and ""Thai hot"", he's not messing around. I'm a big fan of foods that really are as hot as advertised, so this is a good thing.

Because it is a mom-and-pop joint, it can occasionally take longer-than-normal to get your food once you order, especially if it's with a group. To be safe, I'd recommend calling ahead with your order, especially if you have a time limit (aka, lunch break).

I like spicy food and after the explanation of what the levels were I chose 'Hot' thinking that the most hot levels are simply mild to me. Hot was very nice and accurately described. My mouth is still hot after finishing my meal and it was not so hot as to need to wash it down after every bite. 
This was my first visit and the experience will bring me back soon and I'll probably stick with hot but will test their ""Thai Hot"" at some point as my mouth has already cooled down typing this review.

silken reverie
invite to sing a long
from scented memory
- Olivia L.

A Thai restaurant with some Hawaiian options and a few Thai/Hawaiian fusion options, Plumeria Thai Cafe is a little take out spot at Rainbow and Cheyenne with a few tables for those interested in eating there...but at its core it's a spot for take-out.

The special thing about Plumeria is that you can taste the love. There are nicer Thai spots around, there are more traditional Thai spots around, I would even suggest that there are better Thai spots for my Thai preferences, but there is certainly not a place where dishes are made with more love...and that beautiful fact keeps me coming back. I usually order the Red Peanut (Panang) Curry...either with chicken or veggies, but have enjoyed their Pad Ki Mao (Thai Drunkards Noodles) and Yellow Curry (Gaeng Luang) on numerous occasions.

Plumeria makes it easy to order ahead by calling or going to their website. They even deliver in their area. If you to come in and order you can usually pass the time talking with Rodney. Rodney is from Hawaii and brings a genuine welcoming presence to the space. His wife is Thai, and may peak her head out of the kitchen with a beautiful smile if it's slow, but usually demonstrates her welcoming spirit with her wonderful cooking.

In the end, I'm a fan, but it is certainly worth checking out yourself to decide if it's a great option for you too.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,16,14,4,V3FnG-yKhmMF0gRMABlNww

2546446,2015-11-09,7,Rv1IiQaIIDunqzS8dSvHCw,"Stopped in for takeout based on Yelp reviews while starving and exhausted from staying with my PIC at nearby MountainView Hospital. Owner Rodney and his wife Phong and their charming little restaurant were the perfect pick-me-up. 

The Chicken Larb w Thai Spice was delicious, chock full of veggies and I was pleased that they took my desired Thai spice level seriously. Tofu Pad See Ew was a very generous portion of flavorful noodles and a large variety of veggies, I especially enjoyed the Chinese broccoli. The complimentary Thai Iced Tea with Yelp check-in was tasty, too. 

Definitely filled with Aloha spirit, serving up delicious food cooked to order in a welcoming setting, I'll be back to try Tom Kha, Crying Tiger, Drunken Noodles...and more. This is exactly the kind of locally owned gem I adore, you can taste the love in the food!

2564867,2017-08-28,20,Rv1IiQaIIDunqzS8dSvHCw,"We LOVE this place, we have been ordering here quite often since it opened. If they had a rewards card, we should be a VIP by now, seriously. Family owned and our favorite Thai food in all of Las Vegas. It used to be Pinkaow but after this place opened Pinkaow is now 2nd to Plumeria. The owner can probably drive to our house with his eyes closed. I'm in no way suggesting this so please don't even try. 

Our favorites:

1. Pad Siew- I always order this spicy and I always crave for it at least 2x/month. I'm craving for it now while doing this review. Order it with tofu!

2. Chicken Katsu w/ chili sauce- my boys' favorite here, all 4 of them. It comes with macaroni salad which I end up eating with them since it's so good. I'm the kind of mother that likes to clean her kids' plates . 

3. Thai Fried Rice w/ eggs- A must. We never not order fried rice. Why eat if you can't eat with rice right? 

4. Thai iced tea- I used to just order 3 iced teas, I figured we could share since we gotta teach our kids about sharing right? Why not teach them now while saving a few bucks? But.... the kids end up racing to finish it whenever they'd take a sip. So while trying to enjoy my meal, I'm listening to them argue about who finished the iced tea. I've never seen a child take the longest sip  (holding their breath) in my whole life. Except when they're competing who can hold their breath the longest underwater in the pool. So now, I order 6. More money again for plumeria. My thoughts... support family owned establishments . 

5. Vegetarian Spring Rolls- I have a 13 year old that eats everything but never seems to gain weight. So, whenever he discovers a food that he really loves, I like to order it for him. I want him to gain a few pounds so I never forget to order the spring rolls. I enjoy this too, but I dip it in vinegar instead of the sauce they provide. 

The rest of the menu:

1. Thai hotter than hell fried rice- the first time I ordered this, my family and I just looked at each other after taking  our first bite and fought for the Thai iced tea w/ tears running down our faces. It was definitely hotter than hell (I've never been and not planning on it). I did order this a second time just last week, idk I was feeling brave and didn't feel like sharing my fried rice lol. And... we still managed to finish it by the end of the night. 

2. Thai Volcano Chicken- Did not enjoy this, we ordered it once and no one has asked for it again. 

3. Coconut Shrimp/Shrimp Rolls- between the two, I prefer the coconut shrimp. I like to change our appetizers every now and then and have always gone back to the coconut. Could it be the Pacific Islander in me? Maybe...

4. Crab Rangoon- haven't ordered it again but willing to give it another try one of these days.",1x89yXeDnFTcx0L_z0kvQA,25,10,4,hmcYXbW_a6dvxq_kXot_yw

The food here, was simply divine.

This isn't spruced up food that you'll find in any Thai places on the strip, this is more of a home-cooked dining experience, and it is wonderful.  We had the Pad Thai, Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli, and the Chicken Katsu with Thai curry.  All the dishes are made to order (unlike some Asian cafes), so you're able to specify the level of spice for each dish (which was great for my mother who hates spiciness).  

The owner's of the restaurant recently moved here from Hawaii, so there are several more Hawaiian inspired dishes on the menu than you'll find at other Thai cafes.  The owner was very personable and very welcoming into the establishment and we enjoyed our conversation with him as we ate our dinner.

The dessert. For dessert we had their seasonal mango with sticky rice.  The owner explained to us that it's seasonal, because they're very choosy with the kinds of mango that they are willing to serve to their customers.  This kind of particularity showed, as this dish was delicious.  In Las Vegas, most Thai dining experiences are usually compared to Lotus of Siam as the benchmark for good Thai food, and having had both, the mango with sticky rice at Plumeria was hands down the better of the two.

I, for one, am very happy that this restaurant is now open in the NW area of Vegas and plan to return many more times to try the rest of their menu.",WTE4gtyCs1eJDSCj2Afo_A,2,1,5,_9cj28rPWEMMc5PiHkhb6w

Not to mention, there were peanut pieces in the sauce and it honestly looked like throw up. The ribs them self were dry as well. It came with a side of macaroni salad which I assumed would be Hawaiian macaroni salad since it's called 808. It wasn't. It honestly tasted like a mix of macaroni salad and potato salad.

Its truly a hidden gem in Vegas and took time to find this place but once we arrived we notice it was a small caf√© and probably only room for about a dozen people. They also have take out and delivery. 

Our server Rodney who is the owner as well was very friendly and engaging with us. We had a great time reminising time of our island life in Hawaii with him. We ordered a papaya salad and it was a perfect blend of spices and it was spicy to the way we like it. My sister got the Eggs Volcano 808 and that was a complete meal in itself. It was flavorful and spicy to the way she likes it. I got the Pad Siew with Chicken and it was really good with the spicy level at a medium level was really balanced with the soy sauce and mixed vegetables especially the chinese broccoli.

Plumeria Thai Caf√© is the newest iteration of this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant in the plaza off of Cheyenne & N. Rainbow.  Let's hope it stays there!

Owned by a local ex-military bruddah from Oahu & his little Thai wife, this place has some ONO kine' grinds!  Want some Thai food with a little kick?  Go here!  Want some delicious Hawaiian favorites?  Go here!  Check out the ""Broke the Mouth"" part of the menu.  Chicken katsu!  Oxtail soup!

It was our first time there and we ended up ""talking story"" with the owner for a good 15 minutes even before we placed our take out order!  That's just how we local people do folks.  In fact, owners prefer if you stay in the tiny restaurant to eat just so they can shoot the breeze with you!  Very friendly, lots of Aloha Spirit floating around in this joint.

When we finally came to ordering we went with:

*Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken ($8.95) - rice noodles simmered in tamarind sauce & topped with peanuts and bean sprouts

*Pad Siew (aka Thai Chow Fun) with Beef ($8.95) - wide rice noodles stir fried with vegetables, egg & Chinese broccoli

It was a carby night!  With your order, remember you will probably be asked about your spice level.  If you can't take the heat, stay low!  We did, and even at a mild level it still had a tiny hot punch.  Me personally, I like it hot, if I wasn't sharing I would have gone more toward a medium level spice.  

Servings of both noodle entrees were big!  One container of noodles would have fed the three of us easily.  Verdict?  Pretty darn good!  Pad Thai was less orange than I usually see, but the flavor was good, more on the sweet side.  Added crunch of peanuts and bean sprouts were good.  My fav ended up being the Pad Siew, I love a good chow fun!  This one didn't disappoint, fat rice noodles with pieces of beef all simmered in a lovely soy sauce concoction.  The Chinese broccoli added some color as well as texture.  Very tasty.

We'll be back again to try some of their other Thai specialties, especially their rice and curry dishes.  Until then Plumeria Thai Caf√©, MAHALOS!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,11,5,4,eIW0kiMe2S-wcjsRNe0bLQ

The menu looks pretty similar but has a few new items. Hawaiian items. They have Hawaiian macaroni salad and a banana coconut spring roll. Sounds interesting but I had already ordered my standard pad see ew and paid when I found the new stuff. Next time.

Like I said, I ordered my standard pad see ew tonight. It was not the old standard I am used to. Usually it is chicken, broccoli, egg and noodles. This dish I got tonight had carrots, celery, cabbage amd bell pepper in addition. I'm not saying its a bad thing. Just different. There is more substance. While I more often than not would prefer to keep it simple, what I care more about is that there are noodles and good flavor. These were some good noodles. A little spicy as I ordered a level 3 (higher end of mild?). I ended up with a squirt of fresh lime juice to really make the flavors pop. While this was not my favorite representation of pad see ew it did go down fast.

This restaurant offers your Thai favorites like curries, rad na, pad Thai, pad see ew, and a selection of other dishes. The family owns and operates this place, you will likely be seated by the owner's cute son. Then greeted by Rodney, who is a very friendly and kind man who would love to chat. 

I've had the beef jerkey which is well worth the 8 bucks they ask. Some places skimp on the beef. This place doesn't. The beef is tasty, chewy and plump. The dipping sauce is uniquely Plumeria: Salty, tangy, mildly spicy sauce with red onion and cilantro. 

I've had the pad Thai, which I was hesitant to try as most pad Thai in vegas is sickly sweet, gluggy, and overall mediocre. Now let me tell you. This did not disappoint!! I would highly recommend trying the pad Thai! I had it with chicken, which was tender. The noodles are perfectly prepared and have a little bite to them. The dish is topped with really fresh bean sprouts. A lime wedge and crushed peanuts are on the side for garnish. Flavor is on fleec. 

Lastly, I have had the Rad na. Beautiful fresh noodles, pan fried and topped with a wonderfully flavorful, tangy, tasty gravy with tender meat and Chinese Broccoli. 

Overall, The food is as good as it comes. It's not trying to be anything that it isn't. There's no fusion twist, no elaborate plating, nothing but tasty, home cooked Thai food. Did I mention the portions are plentiful? And the prices are under 10 bucks? 

The establishment is clean. There is no bathroom. This place is small. It's on Rainbow and Cheyenne. In the same lot as olive garden and IHOP and a gas station. I drove past this place a few times. It's all the way on one side of the strip mall, opposite side of the IHOP. 

Seriously if you're tired of Pin Kaow (does anyone still even go there?), or the Thai noodle house on Lake mead, give this place a shot. It will deliver on flavor and be easy on the wallet. Plus the guys here are very nice people. Even if you're not tired of your current spot. Get over to Plumeria.

4892400,2016-09-28,0,Rv1IiQaIIDunqzS8dSvHCw,"This is my second time visiting plumeria. My first visit was with my boyfriend and we were looking for nice local spots to eat having just moved into the area. We had a bit of trouble finding this gem because it's kind of hard to spot in the shopping center it's in. The inside is small but cute with Hawaiian flowers and is very clean. The dining room definitely couldn't seat more than 20 people but that's fine cause they do take out! My first visit I ordered the chicken katsu with curry and the crab rangoons while my boyfriend ordered the red peanut curry with Thai level spice (the hottest level) he found it to be deliciously spicy which is a huge plus because often he will ask for the hottest and find it to be still too mild. The flavor of the curry was delicious and blended with the spicy well. My own curry that paired with the katsu was much less spicy and far more peanut-y. It was delicious but not exactly what I was craving with my katsu but luckily they also serve it with a sweet chili sauce which is da bomb. My chicken was fried perfectly and still tender yet crispy. The crab rangoons were deliciously crabby and you could tell they were home made. During our visit the owner Rodney came and checked up on often while still executing take out orders on his blue tooth ear thing. He's a very efficient guy and super friendly. The cuisine theme here is Thai with a little 808 flavor. Rodney told us his family had lived in Hawaii for a while and started learning the cuisine and integrating it into their traditional dishes. The best part is that it's a mom and pop restaurant that is absolutely killing the game. Their food is delicious and prepared by his wife in the back every day, she's occasionally pop out of the kitchen and wipe down tables if theirs no tickets. they are friendly and attentive and the man makes his own jerky every week. You've got to try it. 
So after that we decided to take our whole family out to plumeria to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. 
We got the rangoons on my suggestion, delicious. 
-pineapple curry with shrimp and pork. Didn't taste this one myself but Adrianna said it was delicious.
-red curry Thai hot which was considered delicious by my spice loving boyfriend 
-pad wunsen which is glass noodles with vegetables and your choice of protein, I chose shrimp. Oh my god this dish. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. I don't usually order shrimp when I go out because I'm fearful of overcooked shrimp but these were perfect. The veggies were also nicely cooked with a good crunch to them in the right places. But the star of the show was the glass noodles. They had soaked up all the sauce making them a translucent light brown and you could taste it. I did medium heat which went perfect with the flavors. I can't overstate how delicious the pad wunsen is guys. Try the pad wunsen.",RekZuJgKrbpoXW0TyDyVLQ,1,1,5,8dxysOgz0dPA-Nv9L7pluA

You like Thai food? You dig Hawaiian grinds? This is your home now. The spirit of Aloha flows from this place like the lava from Kilauea. We're so looking forward to coming back soon for both the food and the conversation. Rodney is just awesome. 

Now that food, if you don't know what ""broke da mouth"" means before you eat here, you will after! There's a great mix of Thai and fusion Hawaiian on the menu. So many choices, so just pick one and go. Get the rest later! (Check in on Yelp for a Thai Iced Tea!) 

As mentioned previously, that Volcano Sauce is da bomb. I told my wife you could dump it on a dead frog and you'd be happy to eat it. Man, it's just a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy (but not too spicy). It's too much for a light weight, but for most folks, I imagine it's just about right. (I can't speak for the spice levels of the food as we didn't order anything inherently spicy. From overheard conversations, I'd advise you to not overestimate your ability. 

The Peanut Sauce is great. 

I'd like to point out something interesting, a little extra effort to make everything a little special is their use of a mix of red and white jasmine rice. The attention to detail shows the amount of care with which their cuisine is prepared. 

Also, it may sound odd, but the Thai Tapioca dessert with corn and coconut milk is absolutely delightful.

I definitely had to try their Mac salad- I've been in Vegas for 2.5 years and been to many Hawaiian restaurants here but this place, that Mac salad just brought me back home...omg!

Okay, within the 30-40 minutes we asked a lot of questions and felt like familia.  Typical island-like friendliness and best of all how and why he cooked his pork belly the way he does.  Bottom-line if they can't eat it they won't serve it.  Now it's healthier than most Asian-like eateries and if it's off the so-called traditional way then it's because Rodney and Pong has their version or kick to it.  Open mind open palate you're in Vegas so I can accept the diversity.  I'm not in Cali anymore so if I want 100% traditional I'll stay home and cook but going outside it's an experience and Rodney I'll be back for sure.
I called this place the Vegas' Wing Lee version of SF Wing Lee (Jackson/Hyde) no longer around since 2015 but it was small holding only around 20 seats but it was around since late 1950's.  It became a landmark for cable car conductors and grips and the locals.  This place will be the local place for Vegas.  Your Chow Fun (Pad Siew) is on my list of the top five best Chow Fun ever.  Better than the typical Pad Siew sweet but not overpowering and spicy 5 was just at the point but I still taste the broccoli, beef and fun (noodle).  Texture was perfect: noodle and vegetables were not overcooked or soggy; thus, I knew you didn't have the either of them sitting in water all day prior to us ordering it.  Crunchy it was.
Chow fun was the test at my first round so next time it's your island cooking I'm going after.  Pretty sure you and Pong will kill it.  I feel the love in your cooking.

When i asked his opinion on what was good and what ingredients were in certain dishes he was clueless and not helpful at all.  I had to ask his dad the owner, who answered my questions.

A solid 5 and that's something that lacks in even the nicest of places. 

I was the only costumer so I was able to talk with the owner over my meal. We talked about hunting and his experiences back in Hawaii. It was like visiting an old friend. I will be back while on my week long trip to the area.",ddsNTwpIBCF5At2TfF0LLw,1,0,5,YbP5hd0rR4xr5T-WI93DZQ

This place seems to be family owned that shares all their family recipes to their customers. Me and my girlfriend ordered about four different entrees.

1.)Thai Herb Chicken Entr√©e.
2.)Pork Belly w/ broccoli.
3.)Green Papaya Salad.
4.)Shrimp rolls. (Definitely a must order) 

The items we ordered never disappointed me. All the meat entrees came with side of rice and Mac salad. The papaya salad was a lot for a very cheap price compare to others. The shrimp rolls were the best part Becuase of its unique style of being wrapped like a real fried spring roll. All in all the food and staff deserves two thumbs up.
