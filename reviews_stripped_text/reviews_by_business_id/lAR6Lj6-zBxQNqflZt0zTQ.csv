Nicht wirklich schlecht, aber halt auch das typische Mittelmass und amerikanische Austauschbarkeit. Abgesehen davon: Sehr, sehr typisch amerikanisch, auch wenn das Lokal versucht sämtliche Italieneische Klischees zu bedienen. Manchmal mischen sich zwar spanische Sätze in die Dekorationen an der Wand, aber ist ja alles Europa.

The lasagna had a little too much cheese for my liking but that is only one dish, the other dishes might be good. I did have quite the stomach ache after eating here which I read in some of the other reviews. That could be from any number of things though. There are too many other places to eat to give it a second chance.

The Buca di Peppo family must be a dysfunctional family! We were at this restaurant for over an hour before we were even able to place our drink orders (3 tables worth) and because we were seated by the bar instead of one of there group rooms we had to deal with the other large group(s) that were waiting for their group room to become available. I was waiting for a manager to come and offer an apology but this never happened. There was one server for our 3 tables and he had the help from a couple bus persons but it was obvious that they were also taking care of other customers. Our 3 tables were served dinner at different times. They were slow to seat us, they were slow to take our drink orders, they were slow to bring us our appetizers, they were very slow to come back after they served the appetizers to take our dinner orders and then they served us a different times. This is NOT how my family does family style. Buca at 412 E. Flamingo in Las Vegas if I thought you gave a damn about your customers coming back I would call the manager and give him/her a piece of my mind. This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in Las Vegas and lived there for almost 30 years. Congrats Buca! ....oh I never talked about the food. Well if you still want to know about the food after knowing how bad their service is, here it goes..... 

We ordered the Cheesy Florentine Toast that wasn't bad, the appetizer trio (calamari, fried mozzarella & stuffed mushrooms) was pretty good. For entrees we ordered Spicy Chicken Rigatoni which I liked, we also ordered the Chicken Limone...very good and we had the spaghetti and meatballs, not enough sauce and the meatballs should have been called meat loafs, they were tasty but nothing like any meatballs I've ever had. One our tables ordered the eggplant parm and it was pretty good from a guy who confesses to not like eggplant very much. 

Bottom line....if you have a big group and are looking for a place to have a family style meal out in Las Vegas......KEEP LOOKING!",ZQyOz3H-dZ88qg1jEKSjLw,1,0,1,O04z6um4PKMsdj2mXC3qaw

We have eaten at Buca Di Beppo in Seattle and have always had a very positive experience; great service and great food. So we were really surprised by our experience at this location.

We had a relatively large party (13 people) but were seated quickly and they worked with us to arrange seating so that we were all together. Our server was pleasant. While not rude, she was not very helpful and did not display the upbeat demeanor that we had every other time we have eaten at a Buca's. Had this been the only shortcoming, we would have overlooked it. Unfortunately, when the food came we were in for more disappointments and let-downs.

The salads (chopped, Caesar, and Apple-Gorgonzola) were good ( a bit less flavorful than we have had in the past, but good).

With the exception of the Chicken Parm, the entrees were bland, under-cooked, and for several of the dishes, cold. Even with the wine and Sangria, these dishes were hard to eat and not at all enjoyable.

So sadly, we will neither return no

I don't know how to describe it, it just made me crinkle my nose. The meatball didn't taste good at all. It seemed too soft for a meatball. I also had the chicken. It was VERY lemony.

He a small piece of boiled chicken, a lemon, and pasta with no sauce. Hmmm.... we looked at his dish and analyzed it for a while, thinking this must have been a mistake. 
     So I called them, and they were very nice about. Although I do not agree with the justifications, I realize that accidents happen especially in the food industry. He said the meatball should be cooked because it sits in the sauce and has had at least 4 hours to cook. I dont know about that seeing as the meatball was pinkish red. Apparently he said that the chicken limone is supposed to be like that. In that case, it was  a HORRIBLE dish!!!! Boiled piece of dinky chicken with noodles and no sauce... for $10.00. They were nice enough to send us a coupon for free entrees to compensate, so I will try them once more, and retract my comment if they are good. Otherwise... stop being so cheap buca! keep your standards even though the economy sucks!",FLLrA7D34jmzX0h2k3i2MQ,3,0,2,4RUELCSnNul8ufesqRcpIA

We were seated in the bar area, which is nice because I was able to watch football but we waited a long time to order or even acknowledged.

The food wasn't bad. Obvouisly it's all family style. It has a friendly atmosphere. We had a party of 3 so the amount of food we ordered was good.

 When we arrived, the host walking us to our table asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. We told him it was our anniversary.
 we were then seated at a table in the middle of the room facing the kitchen.( I figured that with so early a reservation we might get a more discreet, less noisy table).
 We sat for 10 minutes when we were approached by a busy but kindly  waitress who then asked (if you can believe it ) if we were celebrating a special occasion . Realizing there was obviously no communication between host and server, we told the occasion for the third time.
 While the waitress was getting our drink another server  came to the table to get our drink and tell us the specials. We told her we were already being served . She then got annoyed and told us she would be right back, obviously to chew out the other server who started us.
 She then came back and told us She would be our server. So we then gave her our drink order and she Id me and my middle aged husband.
 Our caesar salad arrived, which we enjoyed
(it was brought by another server) . Just before dinner arrived another server brought our drinks. Both of them wrong. I sent my  drink back, my husband kept the wrong one they gave him.
 Our dinner was excellent ( the eggplant parm is done perfectly there).
 After dinner the waitress asked if we wanted dessert as she was cleaning off our table. At this point we told her no.  Having told 3 people about our anniversary and then being ignored and given attitude by our server I was royally turned off.

A little later he came out and told us that he forgot that they were out of the mashed potatoes but they did have rosemary potatoes. I told him those weren't on the gluten free menu as an option, but he checked with the kitchen and they said they could do them gluten free so we agreed. Well, the meal came out and we were enjoying it until I took a ""crunchy"" bite of something. If you're gluten free you would appreciate the terror I had with that bite...I immediately spit it out and looked closer at the potatoes and saw a number of ""crunchy bits"". My husband investigated and realized it was breading from something. I was horrified! We spoke with the manager and he was very rude. First he told me there was not breading on the potatoes and I showed it to him and he said it was from the calamari that is also cooked in the fryer (cross-contamination in a common fryer is a huge no-no for gluten free). He further explained that nothing says their food is  gluten free (despite the gluten free menu and waiter).  After I explained that I would get very ill by what they did, he asked if he needed to call me an ambulance or if I had my epi pen with me.

The mozzarella was ok and so was the Caesar. We also ordered the lasagna, fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and baked ziti.  All of the food was overly garlicky. As my husband mentioned, we could have killed a vampire if we burped...
The bread sucked and was overly toasted, the fettuccine was so dry that we had to request 2 additional bowls of sauce which we got charged for, the ziti was dry but, by that time, we didn't even care anymore. The only thing that was semi tasty was the lasagna. At least it wasn't dry...
Total came to over $150 for everything. And, they charge for everything...like $10 for the chicken in the fettuccini ... Pick another place for Italian.  Actually pick another place for dinner...period. Will not return.

When we got our table we noticed that about half the restaurant was empty. There were only 3 tables occupied in our section so we thought things would go smoothly. We waited for another 30+ minutes before anyone came to take our drink orders. Don't worry, the drinks took forever to arrive after that too. When the drinks finally came we had to wait again. 

It was almost as if they didn't want to take our food order. Finally a manger came to take our order. This was the one glimmer of hope that the restaurant had all night. She brought us some free bread for our wait and took our food order. While waiting for our food to arrive she took pretty good care of us. Brought some more bread, filled our drinks, etc. However, once she brought our food we never saw her again. 

Nobody came by to refill drinks or do anything while we ate. I eventually went to the kitchen to get our drinks refilled.

First time here,always wanted to try it. Have always been a big fan of Olive garden, so ere it goes....

Portions are freaking huge...One small plate can definitely feed two people and maybe even have leftovers!

Fried calamari+baby octopi   A
Caprese (always a fan)   A
Caesar salad (nothing spectacular) B-
Prosciutto Chicken (fricken amazing) A+
Rigatoni (less than stellar) C
didn't try the spaghetti
desert variety plate:
strawberry cheesecake (good,but I've had better) B+
Chocolate decadence (great, but a little dry) A
Tiramisu   A

My drink was house Chardonnay, and it was great

Based on my free experience, I would definitely go again, and this time try something with lobster or more garlic :D

I might also mention that up until that day I had just completed a 5 week straight 500 calorie a day diet, and this was my breaking point-free food. SO I enjoyed myself thoroughly.

     The food was delicious, and I should know, I think we ordered everything on the menu after we robbed the Rebels with a buzzer-beater three pointer. I can't quite pin down my favorite dish, though I can say the the bread was amazing.

What got me so upset was when my friend asked the kitchen personnel if our food is ready after we heard him tell  a person who came after us that their order is going out next. My friend asked if our order is almost ready and a bald guy with tattoos in the kitchen responded: ""What!?!?! I don't know, I only know about her order cuz hers is a lot!"" WTH!!! So in other words, he does not care about our order or any other person's order for that matter because ours is not as many as the other person's? I got upset because we're all paying customers, small orders or not. We decided to take our business to them instead of another establishment during one of the busiest evenings of the year and this is the treatment that we get?!?!?!! This man is so rude and unprofessional, I don't even know why he's still working there. 

The food is good but the service that we got from this place is very unsatisfactory and unprofessional that the bad taste of the service resonated to the food.

I think the server, Evan, was just super lax; he took his sweet time before greeting us and getting drinks. But he was nice and checked up on us often during the meal and boxed everything up at the end.

We had to ask for the lunch menu cause serving sizes even for a small size off the regular menu would be way too much for two people to eat. Those entrees didn't even come with a side and that would be separate. But anyways, it didn't make sense why they wouldn't provide that at the beginning either.

I dined at the location at Ballys a month prior to this visit for a catering event and that was what made me want to return here. I had the chicken limone and was craving it thus that was what I ordered, with a side of spaghetti marinara. BF got the spicy chicken rigatoni. 

When the food arrived my lunch combo seemed like it was switched; it was as if I ordered a spaghetti marinara with a side of chicken limone lmao. The chicken itself looked like half a chicken breast! Nonetheless, it was good but the one I had at Bally's was better. The rigatoni had peas which I don't like but bf said it was also okay, quite heavy though.

I'd say come with a lot of people. I don't think a party of three or less will enjoy this place much even for the lunch menu portion.",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,1,0,3,R1RO28IdvJ6Or3q6gmRHvQ

1987482,2015-03-17,0,lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ,"I've genuinely had great experiences at other Buca di Beppo locations, but not this one. Am I just unlucky?

Today's lunch experience was really the final straw. We arrived for lunch as a party of 2 to an empty hostess stand. There was nobody else waiting. We stood around for 10-15 minutes before a cook peeked out around the corner of the kitchen and let us know someone would be with us shortly. It was probably 5 minutes later when the hostess showed up and seated us, but it felt like forever.

Every single time I have been here, it has taken way, WAY too long for our food to arrive after ordering it. That includes today. I didn't look at how long it had been since we ordered when we finally got our food, but it was probably around 30 mins. For lunch, that's unacceptable, considering 1) how little people there were at the restaurant and 2) how the party of 2 seated after us received their more complex dishes within 10 mins of ordering.  My boyfriend's chicken was also very obviously reheated. The chicken had telltale signs: cold around the edges and extremely hot in the middle. Actually, his whole meal was probably forgotten and then stuck in the microwave. It was just sad looking. I generally like the baked ziti from Buca but mine wasn't really that great tasting compared to previous times I've had it. I don't expect a chain restaurant to have fresh-that-day-and-super-amazing ingredients but... this lunch was a disappointment.

I think our unhappiness scared off our waitress. She came by only twice after our food was served. First, she asked how our lunch was going, and almost immediately ran off before I could say more than ""okay"". Then she dropped off our check and a box after we had to ask some random plain-clothes wearing guy (the manager, probably) for it. Then the same guy picked up the check and brought back my card and said goodbye. We walked out of the place, right by our waitress, who didn't say anything. Sorry, lady. :(

I don't know. I still genuinely like Buca's tiramisu and, at least until this one I just had, their ziti. I think if I ever really desperately crave these dishes again I'll just get it to go instead of having to sit through such awful service.",0OnqSvyblod55eNNmnn4BQ,1,0,2,T39jvDiqR9B0KonIalJVYA

Now I have been to a few BDB's throughout the country and everyone offers some really good eats but it's the feel of this particular BDB's that shines out the rest. There generous portions are so large you'll get stuffed in no time. Here they have a choice of sizes to the menu plates.
I suggest that you get a couple of the ""Family Size"" plates cause you'll want more later as a midnight snake.

The first time I went to this location was just before the holiday's and close to closing so I assumed (about 10-10:15). I brought my slave after a day of chaotic running around,
The place was almost empty with the exception 3 men all talking Italian in the booth two over from us. Italian standards were playing and our waiter ""Ken"".
He had a very distinctive Bronx slang and was the perfect touch that a restaurant like this demands.

Polite, patient and knowledgable, Ken knew exactly what we needed and wanted for dinner. He made us feel instantly like we were family treated us likewise. His suggestions were right on the money too.

The food and wines were very palatable with the exception of the house wine (so pay the extra $5 and get something better).

The second time was with a large group of about 10 and lemme tell you again the service, food, drinks, jokes and laughter so delicious the we didn't wanna leave after 3 hours with absolutely no pressure to go we were exhausted and ended with picture momentos of that night.

The stuffed mushrooms were tasty however getting like 7 mushrooms for like 14 dollars is ridiculous! A waste of money for sure. We continued to pour our own wine. We finally got our mains. The linguine with all the seafood was good apparently (the Guys shared that and I don't eat seafood). The chicken sausage ziti us ladies got. It was terrible! There was absolutely no flavor. No salt. No nothing. I ended up getting some marinara to try and ""give it some pizazz"" and still. Blah. So once again left there very unsatisfied.

Each entree comes with either a small or a large plate. I would recommend ordering a small if it's you and one other person. Because like I said...their portions are HUGE.

Everything served up family style, which I liked. We ordered stuffed chicken, stuffed pasta shells and Caesar salad. Everything was good. Not completely authentic, but decent Italian food.

If you've never been here, the first thing to note is that everything is served family style.  As such, I've found it's much more enjoyable to go with a BIG group of people so you get a varied choice of a bunch of different things.  I went last night with one friend and we got the gnocchi and chicken marsala.  And, while the gnocchi was good, you can really only have a small portion before feeling like a dumpling yourself.  The marsala is different - it's much sweeter than what I'm used to, but still very good and is served with big, plump mushrooms.

Their salad with prosciutto and gorgonzola is fantastic, and we ordered a $10 tiramisu wondering what a $10 tiramisu looks like.  Well, we found out.  It came in a giant bowl and 3/4 of it is still in my fridge.

The meal selection was Linguine Frutti di Mare.  My only complaint here was that I did not have enough room in my stomach to finish; which was probably due to the fact that I ate most of the bruschetta (did I mention how much I LOVE bruschetta?) and that we asked for a meatball ""just to see how they were"" and the one she brought out was HUGE!

The service staff I would give 5 stars to.  

HOWEVER, This being my first experience at Buca Di Beppo, I expected at least Olive Garden Quality.  My Nephew and I shared the Spaghetti and Meatballs.  The Meatballs were yummy, however there was a complete lack of sauce on the pasta.  The meatballs maybe had a ladle of sauce, but the pasta had what I would call tomato water under the meatballs.  Not yummy!  

The Pizza was crisp on the edges however the dough was soggy under the toppings.  I did like what my niece had, I don't remember the name, it was Chicken Alfredo, Sausage macaroni basically. 

 I would give this a higher rating however in terms of value to money spent I felt this place needs to apologize for itself.  The food is mediocre, the pricing is too high for bad food.  At least at the Olive Garden I get a fresh salad that comes with my dinner, not here, it's ala-carte.  I think I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $18 for Spaghetti and meatballs.  

Any one who's ever been to a church spaghetti social can tell you that for $5 you can get a plate of pasta with a rich meaty sauce that is way better than this place.  While the church Spaghetti comes with a little guilt, Buca's comes with shame.

Going around 4pm on a Thursday certainly has its perks, as we were only 1 of 2 parties in the entire place! So we were greeted promptly and  seated quickly. I was diggin' how the place is set up with the whole Italian thing. There was so much to check out on the walls.

They have most menu items set up as small and large. Small apparently feeds 2 people, while large will feed 4 people (or 2 really, really hungry people). We opted for some good ole lasagna and a basket of mozzarella bites. The food was just not that great. Not only that, I was really bracing myself for a good size portion and it was kind of puny for all the hype. lol

The mozzarella bites were pretty good though. we wooffed through those things before even polishing off the lasagna.

The young man who was our server was polite, friendly, and attentive. In fact everyone we came across was very nice. The issue wasn't with the service, just the lackluster food.

So, it wasn't horrible, but with so many dining options in town I honestly don't see myself going out of my way to come back here.

2957156,2013-03-30,0,lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ,"I don't really like giving chains 5-stars but I think Buca deserves it for several reasons.  First off the servings are huge, which allows you to order a few things for the table and have your party pick a large variety of tastes.  

Second- the price point is not bad for the amount of food you get with entrees ranging in the $15-$30 range (depending on serving size).  if you sign up for their e-mail club or coupon clip you'll see a $10 off purchase of $20 or more.  Get a small pasta and two drinks and you've got yourself a very reasonable date!

Lastly the food is very good.  Maybe they don't have the bread sticks or salad like Olive Garden, but the dishes themselves are very good.  As you'll see with my other reviews of Italian places, I use Buca as my ""base-line"" to compare other maybe fancier places.",M-xJMhi-HphpWaD2992K3A,0,0,5,WFhZNEpkqazGReO2BUCMkA

Throughout the night, two servers were on the ball and granted all of our requests. They were friendly and helpful (especially considering there were many kids in our group, including mine).

I was a fan of the very first course, a delicious caprese salad. It's so simple, yet so elegant. I love that it represents the colors of the Italian flag. Yes, I'm corny like that.

The second and third courses were salads that I wasn't particularly interested in. They were good, but not really my thing. 

The fourth course was fried calamari, and it was delicious. The marinara that accompanied it was stellar, and I of course squeezed fresh lemon over the top. I was already thinking about trying to save room for the entire meal. I knew that they were going to go all-out (after all, you only get married once [in theory]).

The next course was a spicy chicken pasta. The pasta sauce was good, as well as the chicken (although some people thought it was too spicy). I liked it.

Course number six was a shrimp pasta. It was quite good. There was a lot of savory shrimp inside, and the sauce was tasty.

Everyone began rubbing their tummies, feeling full, and anticipating dessert. That's when the groom-to-be stood up and announced, ""I hope you all saved room for the main course."" A lot of us laughed, but he wasn't kidding! Oh man, I ate too much already. But bring it on, they're only getting married once, right?

Out comes huge family style plates of chicken parmesan (I've lost track of the course numbers by now). I dove right in to discover it was well-breaded, seasoned, and delicious. I was really feeling full at this point when the chicken with capers arrived. It was moist, tender, and had a flavorful sauce.

Next, some succulent, well buttered broccoli arrived. I made myself eat some (we need our veggies).

Everyone was doing their best to continue eating when enormous trays of meatballs in marinara sauce made their appearance. Needless to say, no one left hungry.

At last, we had made it to dessert (most of us barely being able to move). Huge trays of cheesecake surfaced, as did tiramisu. It's safe to say we all gained a few pounds that night.

3184170,2012-02-22,0,lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ,"We recently held our small wedding reception at this location on 2/18/12 and I would absolutely NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone with ANY kind of party. First off, if you want to make a reservation for a celebration they make you sign a contract. You damn well better make sure that EVERYTHING they verbally promise you is put into that contract. The lady we talked to on the phone, Jennifer, said the rooms were ""semi-private"" and ""partitioned"" meaning that they were off to the side and that we would have our own space to mull about and have our little party. We all showed up after the wedding and from the get-go, it was a bad experience. Our tables weren't ready so everyone had to hang out in the packed lobby for 15 minutes (it was February and quite chilly outside so that was really our only option besides sitting in our cars). When they called us back, our ""room"" would have been great for a party but they had sat 3 additional tables in there with us! Instead of letting us spread out and sit comfortably amongst the booths and tables, they crammed as many of us as they could into these long booth/table combinations so that anytime anyone in the booth area had to get up to go to the bathroom, the entire side of the table had to shuffle about. When we asked the manager about this, he denied that they even offered private rooms (though I passed many on our walk through the restaurant). Instead of checking with the sales coordinator, he made us pull up our contract on our phone right there so he could point out that the contract does not specifically guarantee us a ""private"" room only that they reserve the right to make changes and only attempt to honor our seating requests. We decided to just sit down, shut up, and make the best of it. Our servers were nice and the food was good but the whole thing just felt rushed. We were still able to get up, have a little toast, and hang out but you could tell the other 3 tables in there with us felt really awkward about having to share their space with a party that they were clearly intruding on (though it was no fault of their own). When it came time to pay the bill, the jerk-manager begrudgingly gave us a discount for the inconvenience. My sister and I noticed that this included a reduction in the servers' tip.  When we asked jerk-manager about it he looked quite disgusted and made the snide comment that ""everyone is going to have to suffer for this."" I found it to be absolutely unacceptable that the poor waitstaff who makes $2.13 an hour had to suffer for their mismanagement so in the end we left them a rather large tip. They couldn't clear us out of there fast enough, while we were all trying to get our coats and say good-bye, we were having to dodge busboys slinking through trying to clean so they could seat another large party. We ended up going with Buca because Maggiano's required a much larger reservation fee for an actual private room.

If you aren't familiar with Buca di Beppo, the main concept is that it offers ""family style meals"". This means that when you select something from the menu, the portion is enough for two or more people, from appetizers to salads to pastas. The Food is great and I had enough for left overs!

There was another larger party right next to us so it was a little busy. We ordered the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni per suggestions on YELP. This dish was horrible. The chicken was dry and the sauce tasted like pasta water. There was no flavor to it at all. I was there with 2 other people and they had the same experience. We couldn't even eat it so we asked the waitress for extra marinara  sauce. This still did not help much but made it somewhat edible. On top of the bad dish the staff behind us was arguing with each other on who would get the next big table.

3577004,2011-01-24,0,lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ,"I'm not really going to go into a lot of detail on the food as Buca di Beppo is a pretty large chain of restaurants.  It'd be tantamount to reviewing a hamburger from McDonalds, as if it would be different from that of any other McDonalds in the US.  The distinguishing factor between Buca locations will largely be service.  However I will say that Buca has kind of ""sold out"" in the past 10 years and the quality has noticeably gone downhill as they've expanded. 

I went with a friend around 5 PM on a Sunday and surprisingly they were not at all busy.  We were seated immediately and we were asked if we had been there before.  I said yes and then the server went into a spiel about explaining how big the dishes were and we could even order from the lunch menu if we wanted.  OK, why ask if we had been there before if you're going to explain the dishes are huge and feed multiple people?  Anyway, the server took our drink order.  Then a completely different server came over and asked what drinks we wanted.  I explained we were already taken care of before and he asked if we had been there before.  After saying yes he started explaining the sizes of the dishes again.  Are you kidding me?  Thankfully while he was going through the exact same speech we got our drinks from the first server and he left.  

Anyway I won't bore you with the details of the food.  It's above average Italian chain food.  Better than Fazoli's, not as good as Olive Garden.  Service was of average speed.  I had to wait a bit too long for a drink refill, especially considering they had only a couple of other customers.  

Where this experience went horribly wrong was the end of the meal.  We were visibly done and had placed all the plates at the edge of the table and nobody came over to give the check or collect the plates despite passing by several times.  OK.  Eventually a server came over and cleaned up, and asked if we wanted the remainder of the food in to go boxes.  I said yes and asked for the check as well.  He took two dishes to the back to box up, came back and put the remainder of the mashed potatoes on a piece of chicken after asking if it was OK to combine the two in the same box.  I said sure and he put them together, saying there would be no way he could eat that after the two foods had touched.  OK I'm not sure why you felt the need to tell me that, but whatever.  Still no check.

Eventually after both my friend and I were standing up and waiting to leave and waiting for another couple of minutes, I went to the bartender to ask him if we could get the check.  He ran off, came back a bit later and said it was on the way.  After waiting another few minutes I went all the way out to the front where there were 3 staff members and practically begged someone to bring the check so we could leave.  Finally a few minutes after that I got the check but it was wrong.  It took another few minutes to correct and finally we could leave.  

An absolute failure with respect to service in every way.  If they mess up so badly on a party of 2 when they aren't busy, I can only imagine how bad it would be with a large group, if they were busy, or both.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,3,0,2,3rMoqZl7WsR63O9toNEU4Q

The decor is odd and slightly off putting, it's overdone and strange at times. We were seated in the Pope room, which you can guess is decorated with Pope memorabilia. There was a giant Pope head enclosed in glass in the middle of our table on a lazy Susan. Strange/odd/bizzare are the best words to describe it. 

Food, let me just preface this by saying I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it because it's hard to find good Italian at a decent price in this city. Heck it's even hard to find decent Italian at a higher price in this city. The food was bland, and it made me sad.

3669223,2014-05-14,3,lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ,"Yes. 5 stars for making my lunch wedding reception so memorable and awesome! I had an early wedding ceremony in Treasure Island Hotel and my first choice of reception place is the Maggiano's. However, the booking rep there did not realized that the room I have been eyeing for a while now, signed a contract, has been booked months ahead and only advised me a month before my actual wedding day. I know, what a mess. So I contacted this branch and the sales coordinator, Ms. Shelby Hellweg immediately responded to my inquiry. On February, she sent me the banquet prices and it was really affordable. At first we are looking for less than 30 guests so she gave us the smallest room and provided some ideas. Signed the contract and she asked us if we have anymore questions. 

At the very last minute, we did not realize that we will be having more guests so we needed to amend the contract. She made it ALL STRESS FREE for me and my husband! =) She reserved us the EGGPLANT room w/c can accommodate up to 72 guests. In the end it all worked out. 

She was really easy to talk to and responded to our non stop emails in less than 24 hours. When we finally met her in person (the day before our wedding reception), she showed us the semi-private room, dropped of our table arrangements and she made sure that she will take care of everything. 

RECEPTION DAY:
-- Ample parking space!!!!
-- Guests came in really early but the manager and the servers accommodated them right away. Drinks and food came in just in time. Servings are huge (family style) and lots of leftovers and allowed us to bring everything home. They assisted us in neatly packing the leftovers and even gave us some containers for our wedding cake and cupcakes. 

We didn't feel rushed and everything went smoothly. The guests had so much fun and I was glad we were treated well here. I am recommending this place for wedding reception on a budget. The food is awesome for sure and the servers were awesome. Forgot their names.  

Days after my wedding, I left our wedding champagne glasses and Shelby was kind enough to call me and notify us that she's willing to ship it back to us for free. They are really great here!",3kBpZPOORmJHG_GxWiJhQA,5,7,5,Nw8PtynbF3MPU3OKv-vvFw

I found this Buca on the GPS to be very close to the Hard Rock. Infact it was just down the street from the Hard Rock on Flamingo. I came here on a Sunday evening, and there was next to no one here at 6pm. It took a total of 2 minutes to get seated. 

The menu is exactly like any other Buca's around in Socal. I ordered the Quatro Al Forno which comes with 4 different kinds of pasta and a meatball on the side. The total after tip had to be less the $20. This wouldn't buy me a single plate of food at the Wynn. The management there was very friendly. I remember them asking me how the place compared to the ones in Socal. I lied and told them its superb, when really it was on the same level.

On any given day I am a big Buca lover, I go to a few times a week to the Summerlin location, but today I had family to meet across town and made the unfortunate suggestion for this location.
Starters: Buca trio; 
      Calamari ( over cooked to a blackened shame of it's former self)
      Stuffed mushrooms ( cold like they had just been sitting out until some happened to order the poor things)
       Fried mozzarella ( soaking in marinara that seemed mostly comprised of water)
Entrees:
       Penne Basilica the sauce was the only saving grace, the chicken was ""curiously"" soft and squishy, as was the pasta. Oh and the broccoli? Oops sorry they were out, at 6 pm..
       Chicken Parmesan: I could let the burn edges go, if the rest wasn't soaking in the same tomato water excuse for marinara sauce. 
       Sausage Ziti: could you possibly believe they made sausage and sauce too bland to finish? Yeah my brother was shocked too.

No doubt that I am an Italian snob.  Yes, living in Italy spoiled me and I decide whether a place is a good Italian place based upon its ability to provide amazing gnocchi.  This place is not Italian.  It is better to define it as Italian-American.  Large portions.

There is a charge for bread.  A charge for pasta.  A charge for vegetable.  I sent the green beans back because they tasted like someone poured lemon juice on them.  I didn't think it was possible to mess up green beans, but yes, they made it happen.

It was really expensive for eh Italian food.  I can make better at home.  I will stick to the authentic places in town and there is plenty.  Maybe this is the place for a large group meal for kids going to prom, not for two adults.",kWj6AdUtkvbzhdsqRifwLQ,4,0,2,sy2pMj9vPhduIt2E3oiXOg

The decor of the restaurant immediately grabs the patron from the time one walks in the door until you leave. I love the pictures and images all over the restaurant it gives it flair and a sense of old Vegas. The low level lighting at the booth we were sitting at was so elegant too.

Our server was so gentle and welcoming he assisted us with all the menu questions that we did have. The menu that they do have is in true Italian fashion and encourages sharing which we did. The menu does specify that too that the small serving is for about 3 people and the larger servings are for 5-7. We ordered a small pepperoni pizza and still took home left overs between myself and my twins. We also had the mini meatballs and they were so good that we ended up with two orders of them. The mini meatballs are made from scratch and have mozzarella inside of them. 

After eating I did save room for dessert too since I have heard they do it here the best. We ordered the brownie sundae and it was huge. It was full of brownie bites, vanilla and chocolates ice cream with Carmel sauce through it. Then on top was whipped cream all over with colorful rainbow sprinkles. It does not get better than that !

I've been to this location several times on a dinner date and was seated in a small intimate dining area, I guess meant for couples. 

One thing I don't like about this restaurant or many ""Italian"" restaurant is how diming lit it is. I like to be able to see my food and see the face of the person I'm eating with, but lighting is so dark in here. I know it's supposed to help make the place seem more intimate, but it's not my thing. 

Service has always been quick and efficient. Always seated fairly immediately and our waiter/waitress are very quick to come and take our drink/food order. Since I usually came before the dinner rush, we never had to wait too long for our food to come out. They bring you complimentary house bread and butter while you are waiting. The bread is a hit or miss. The last time I came, the bread was pretty hard and dry. I didn't end up finishing my slice since it seemed old. 

Our food, on the other hand, was so good! All their dishes are served family-style so you can share dishes. Their small servings serve 2-3 people and their large servings serve up to 5 people. This could change depending on how hungry you are when you come. For me and my date, small was more than enough for us. We would normally order a salad and two entrees and share. Take home about half of our order for another meal is always a plus. 

The Caesar salad is my favorite of their salads that I've tried. Everything is pretty perfect about it. Lettuce is always fresh and crisp. Only thing I'd change would be to add a bit more dressing to the salad as it seemed pretty dry for a salad. 

Their Chicken Parmigiana is soooo good! The chicken is perfectly breaded and cooked. Was not dry at all and the flavor was delicious with the just perfect amount of marinara sauce. Another of my favorites here is the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni. Yum Yum YUM!! Was not at all spicy for me, so I added more crushed red pepper on top and then it was perfect. Penne alla Vodka is another great choice as well as their Baked Ziti, Cheese manicotti. The Penne alla Vodka could definitely use more sauce, but it was well seasoned and the pasta was perfectly cooked. 

Our server came around often to check up on us and refilled our drinks often. They are super friendly and love to make conversation with you. I would definitely come back.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,31,25,4,0eigKOp8bTJEUDDe5vFAOA

Came here for dinner to celebrate my graduation. We booked the Kitchen Table, which we were quite excited about.

Plus, we were a tad disappointed that the Kitchen Table, wasn't really in the kitchen...kinda deceiving, if you ask me. We will book the Kitchen Table at the San Diego location next time we go, cause at least that table is in the kitchen, hence the name. 
We sat down in our own private dining area and as Lorenzo promised, we were the only ones in there.  We literally had the waitress (Jennabea) all to ourselves!  It was very nice; Jennabea was fantastic and incredibly attentive!

Anyhow...so the food, as you should know, it's all served family style, and as always, it was all very delicious. Everyone loved their food, there wasn't much left on the plate.  In fact, I had to push my plate away in order to to stop eating.. ha!

From the first bite, you will know you are at a low level chain restaurant that doesn't have a real chef on staff.  Do you want a real Italian culinary experience?  Go to Il Fornaio or the likes. This is the Pizza Hut version of Italian dining.  Eat too much, leave stuffed and yet less than satisfied.  

Then, dessert.... enjoy your diabetic coma if you get the Colossal Chocolate Brownie Sundae.  It is as big as a football.  Don't order unless there is at least 5 people to eat it.  Seriously huge.

I will say that the cannelloni was really delicious, the eggplant parmesan was about as good as you'd expect, and the cheesecake was also really good and different from typical store-bought cheesecake, possibly due to a different cheese being used.

""I just wanted to write to you about our experience at Buca for our wedding reception. My husband and I were running late to the reception and I got a frantic call from my Maid of Honor telling me that Buca swears that no wedding cake was delivered. I had to get in touch with the bakery, who called the driver who insisted that it was delivered at 9AM and he even gave me the name of the person who accepted the cake. We had to insist that Buca check the freezer for the cake. Finally, they did find it.

Our reception was supposed to start at 1PM. We arrived at 1:30, but my guests were there at 1. Our party wasn't even served salad until 2. Once the entrees came, they were barely even warm. We specifically asked for a vegan salad and entree, which is on the banquet contract, and the server had no clue what we were talking about. My maid of honor had to wait for them to make it, and be served well after everyone else.

The server barely came by. We had to hunt him down to ask for things and ended up having to flag down a different server a few times. We had 3 people that didn't show up, so we had extra food. The server didn't even offer to box it up for us, he just threw away extras that we paid for without even asking. No one offered to help with the cake or even offered us any extra plates to serve it on. We found some plates on a shelf, and had to get them ourselves. We probably would have had better service had we just walked in and been seated at a regular table.

I planned my reception at Buca because my friend had her reception there a few years ago and highly recommended it. She told me how great the service was and how helpful the staff was. This was only my 2nd time ever eating at Buca, and I was greatly disappointed with the entire reception. I just thought I would give you some feedback on how our reception went. ""

Our wedding banquet was about $600. I wish we had spent the money elsewhere.

4287348,2011-07-19,4,lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ,"So the bf suggested we go here for dinner, and I was like ""hells yea!"" bc I had a coupon! This is the 1st and def last time we will be eating here!

We walked in and the first thing I noticed were the plastic flower outside of the place. SUPER CLASSY!!! LOL. We go inside and got seated quickly, I was dying of thirst from The Secret Garden visit we just had and was looking for our waiter to no avail. We were looking at the menus and another party got seated behind us, 3 minutes later a waiter takes their drink order, brings it back, and asks if they were ready to order! WTF! 

We finally get graced with the presence of the same waiter and he finally takes our drink order, and asks if we would like an appetizer. My bf thinks hes money bags McDuck and orders the garlic parm french bread. I sit there in price shock, I couldnt believe how pricey the food is!! Esp since they had deco of plastic/silk flowers! I'm sitting here thinking to myself, ""I havea 10$off coupon with the purchase of 20$, one freakin plate costs 20$!"" 

Our drinks and app (which were cold!) finally come and I chug down my water, I then go on to ask him about the ""Italian soda/creme sodas"" and if he had ever had one? His answer was ""Yes, but have I told you my suggestions for dinner?"" WTF! I wanted your opinion on creme sodas, not what YOU like for dinner here!!! I then asked for an iced tea and he went away. The meals here are typical italian fare. Spaghetti and meatballs (huge ones) rigatoni, baked ziti, and all that pasta. Then they have chicken and some fish, which was meh on the selection. The bf ordered a small spaghetti and meatballs and a small margherita pizza, I ordered the stuffed small prosciutto chicken breasts. 

His pizza comes out and which looks yummy and we all get a piece... meh. I pile on the parm and it makes it a little better but still meh. The rest of the food comes out and I was like OMFG! Not at the food, but from the utensils that came with my chicken... a fricken bbq grill fork! My 5 year old was like ""WOW!"" I right away took that away, my son woulda had a field day! I look at my bfs spaghetti and was not impressed, pasta was al dente & tasteless and the balls were ok but nothing to fall in love with. I've had WAYYYYY yummier balls in my mouth before; I'm like a ball connoisseur I guess : )

My chicken breasts looked ok, seemed like they were sitting under the heat lamp for a bit. I made myself a plate and cut into the chicken, and took a bite......... I was not satisfied! It tasted & looked like a frozen piece of chicken cordon bleu!  It was bland and tasteless also! UGH! I  also loaded that with parm from the shaker and some salt, it was ok but still dry. FAIL! It also came with some pesto sauce which was ok, but no cigar!

The bill was over 68$ WITH my coupon!! NOT worth the money! Some people may like it because of the large portions, but the quality is terrible! Paying 17$ for spaghetti and 2 balls in insane! And my 23$ frozen cordon bleus were criminal! Horrible!! STAY AWAY! Better yet go to Maggianos and get better quality food (More food & a dessert also!) for about the same!!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,3,2,2,p1zgrcZnu1NJHrnBIBrn8Q

We were pleasantly surprised. We got the Baked Ziti and the Pizza, and both were actually good. The ziti was really good, the pizza was meh in consistency but the flavor was very good.

Seating was prompt, the server was not. It took awhile to get our server's attention when we were ready to order. My friend is gluten free so we both ordered from that menu. We came around lunch time but there is only one lunch entree that is GF, so we were forced to get that and something from the dinner menu.  Also had an antipasto salad.

We stated from the start that my friend is gluten free, and we were ordering from the GF menu. Yet when our entrees came, there was pasta in it. The server said it was GF. Having cooked GF pasta before, and doing research on this establishment, no.. That was not GF pasta, particularly since they never ever have served it at Buca.

About 30 minutes later we got our dish again, this time with like 4 pieces of broccoli. The chicken breast (chicken limone) was considerably small. We also got chicken marsala, which consisted of 3 chicken breasts and like 5 mushrooms. Really need a starch in there. Could they not have put potatoes on the side?

I think we spent about 3 hours and $40 here, all for 4 small chicken breasts, a salad and not much else. I've read about their huge portions. Not the case for GF items.",GYz2-BBolFD5h_D6S5gi3w,3,1,1,ZjsqiIiHCZdr_4nsk9z_pQ

So when my fiance's best friend (who lives in Vegas) said we should go here I was instantly happy. And it was even better than I had imagined. 
    When I walked in I felt as though I had walked in to a restaurant in Italy. The decor was funny, like an Italian version of TGIF. But it only added to the whole experience. We wound up spending WAY too much for three people and getting WAY WAY too much food, too. But it was VERY much worth it. The food was awesome. And the quantity was huge. Although it seems a little ridiculous for them to charge $2 for a side of marinara sauce when we just got two $11 appetizers...but hey that's a fancy place for you. Had we ordered one dish and one appetizer I think we would have been perfect...but when your in Vegas you go big or go home.

Despite not seeming to be too busy (the room we were in was completely empty, at first), we had to request waitress service twice to get water and place our orders. We did not receive any food, other than bread, for 90 minutes. It took two hours to receive our entrees, and they came out slowly over another half hour or so. 

The manager came to talk to us before the food came out and told us their systems were down and the 'to go' orders had been lost, so everyone who had called ahead to place orders who then came in to pick up their food had to reorder at that time. Those people I feel terribly for- they were all rowdy and stuck in the foyer when we were leaving and someone said the restaurant had closed early because of the back up. And people were still arriving with reservations. 

The waitress was clearly upset and angry, and was not attentive to the table and was defensive when she was asked questions or received complaints about the wait or whether the right food was coming to the table (because total orders were not coming, just half orders then later more half orders). 

The people behind us finally left after not getting any food for 90 minutes, and then only getting a tiny pizza to split for a table of ten. Many people had kids with them, and by now the room we were in was full and we were the only ones eating. 

The food was fantastic. I have read the portions are huge at this place, but we did not experience that. The food portions were acceptable but not typical of Family Style in my experience. The chicken in the dishes was perfectly cooked and the chicken parm was the best I have ever had, by far.

4764542,2015-12-07,1,lAR6Lj6-zBxQNqflZt0zTQ,"I stand corrected. When I'm wrong, I'm wrong. For the record, it doesn't happen often, but when it does, I usually admit it. I have to say I was completely wrong about Buca di Beppo.
I'm thankful that I'm a person of second chances. If I wasn't the person I am, I would miss out on some of the finer things this world has to offer. One of those things being, one of my new favorite Italian Spots.
I decided to give this place another chance. My friend and I arrived at 5pm, just like last time. As we entered, the hostess was standing at the podium and she had the nerve to be smiling. It's been a long time since I've been anywhere where someone greeted me with a smile. Oh but she did! She was also very perky and attentive too. I like that! Make me feel like you're happy to see me lol.
We were seated promptly, and once the hostess walked away, the server, Ken, came right over. He was pretty cool. He took our drink orders and brought them back fast, along with the ""free"" bread and the oil and vinegar mixture that I remember ol so well, from our last visit. He then asked if we were ready to order. We were in fact ready, so we proceed to do so.
We started with the mozzarella garlic bread and Baked Rigatoni. It sounded like a beautiful combination. To be honest, I were skeptical. I was just hoping whatever we ordered, tasted better than the Fettuccine, from last time. I also was going to get into a fight with the cooks if I paid $10.99 for a cheesy-garlicky brick, and I didn't want to go to jail over food. Joking!
We reluctantly started on the ""free"" bread. Surprisingly, it was soft and tasted nothing like the boot they served us last time. It was actually good.
Meanwhile, Ken, came back with a salad for the table next to us. Being greedy, I called him over and inquired about it. He gave me a few details and ran to get the menu, so that I can look at all of them. He brought the menu back and pointed out and described EVERY SINGLE SALAD. Ken showed me more attention than my last date did. 
So we decided to order the $14 Caesar salad. I don't know if Ken had anything to do with that or the fact that we were extremely hungry. Either way, he put it in and came back with it after about 6 or 7 minutes, a little after he dropped off our Garlic bread.
Speaking of Garlic bread, I'll probably never have any bread that will be as good as it was. It came with about 15, perfectly cooked, pieces. It had the perfect crunch around the edges and the softest and moistest cheese in the middle. Can someone say worth every darn penny! It was just delicious.
We almost forgot all about the salad that was sitting there all scrumptious looking. We scooped out some of it and it was really good too. It was well worth the money.
Around that time, Lorenzo, the manager came around. He's a really nice guy. We chatted about my experience and I was honest with him about everything. He subsequently, apologized about the last visit. I could tell that he was really passionate about his job. I was delighted to let him know that EVERYTHING we had just tasted was perfect. 
Lorenzo asked what entrée we ordered. I told him it was the Rigatoni. He told me that the Rigatoni is really good but his favorite is the Quadro el Forno, which was $20. It actually sound really good. Being me, I wanted to make sure that we experienced all of the best recipes that they had to offer. We ordered that one as well.
Ken brought out both entrées fast. I have to tell you, they both looked delicious. We looked like we had enough food to feed a clan of pregnant women. We took a couple scoop of both. My friend and I both just looked at each other. The food was nothing like we've had in a long time. It was just impeccable.
We liked everything about the Quadro el Forno dish. The cheese was perfect, all of the pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce had the perfect spice. It was excellent.
We enjoyed the Baked Rigatoni too, but the pasta seemed to have been cooked al dente. I like soft pasta, myself, but my friend thought it was perfect.
We ate maybe 1/3 of both pastas and then Ken brought a ""To Go"" container, and we packed the rest. I have to say, for the record, we ate it for the next 2 days. It was just as good heated.
Lastly, Lorenzo came back around and made sure everything was ok, which everything was awesome. He recommended, along with Ken, that we try a dessert. We were damn near stuffed to complicity, but we did want something sweet plus everything looked so good.
We ordered the Colossal Brownie Sundae. Our face dropped when we saw that thing come out. It was bigger than any dessert I've ever seen. It had to be for a whole family. We maybe ate a fourth of it a packed it up. It was magnificent though. The brownie was warm and soft and ice cream just complimented the cake to the fullest extent. It lasted 3 days, after that day.
In all, the experience was 100 times better that the first visit and the food was 200 times better. We'll definitely go back, maybe even today!!",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,3,2,5,5wUOSE_sKfvQa1WJFKN7vw

However, I decided to go to the flamingo location tonight for my birthday dinner with the family and my experience was total trash. First we walked in with a reservation and our table wasn't even ready. We only waited about 6 minutes so it wasn't a big deal. We get seated and it is going good until I realize we have been seated for a little over 10 minutes with no greeting or anything. Finally someone comes over and says, ""Has your server been to your table yet.?"" Then our server comes over and while we are waiting for a couple people to arrive we try to order drinks and an appetizer. Our drinks didn't come to the table for about 10 more minutes and they came one at a time. Finally our whole party is complete and we are all kind of just hanging out.... have yet to see our server come around again. When she does she stands at one end of the table and takes the whole tables order from one person which is fine. But instead of letting us know we probably ordered too much food for our party size, considering the portions are huge, she acted like it was going to be just enough food for us. We wait about an hour and 10 minutes in total before our food finally comes out and we are super disappointed at this point. They didn't even pre bus our table to make room for our dinner plates. So while they were putting them down we were literally handing them empty appetizer plates and dirty napkins and silverware. We never received more napkins or silverware either. The side of mashed potatoes was literally cold, like the butter didn't even melt on them, and they tasted like they were scraped out of a TV dinner. Our side of garlic mozzarella bread is nowhere to be seen. Chicken is a little dry and way too buttery not quite enough lemon. We all have empty drink glasses majority of our time and until I track down our server and let her know there are multiple issues with the table she didn't even check back. I let her know and she takes the mashed potatoes, brings back the same exact dish of them and says they are hot now. I didn't come out to eat to have microwaved mashed potatoes. Still haven't received water or soda refills. And at the end of our dinner the small amount of staff they still have on comes to sing to me for my birthday. At the end of the song I blow out the candle and the server asks if I want the birthday cheesecake, kind of implying that it is maybe a free dessert. I say no and someone at my table says yes. It ended up being on our check. A $12.99 piece of ""birthday cheesecake"" that I said no to when she asked. Odd. Anyways. We are looking at the check and we ordered the spaghetti with meatballs but after we ordered it she comes back and says they are out of the ""homemade"" meatballs. And they can do the meat sauce instead. For some reason we are still charged for the meat balls which is only a 5 dollar difference but still. I bring it to her attention and she has to adjust the bill. In the end I will say I am NEVER going back to this location again. Clearly they need new management and more staff because they had no idea how to run a restaurant in there.

As for the entree they serve in these huge family style portions. The small serves 1-3 people and the large. who knows.. The Cardinals offensive line maybe? Well we ordered the quattro soemthing or another. It consisted of stuffed shells, mannicotti, chicken cannteloni and ravioli. The sauce was very minimal and tons of cheese. I left feeling guilty for thinking I'd just consumed an entire wheel of cheese- My bf was very disapointed in the ravioli - he thought it would be the best since it was the center of the dish. Wrong. It ranked dead last. We both agreed that the stuffed shells came in 1st place. If I went back to buca I'd def. go with the stuffed shells. To be honest though..

I hadn't heard much about this place but once I did. I just had to try it out for myself and see what all the talk is about. 
Traditionally I know vegans don't really have a place in Italian restaurants due to the cuisine being primarily cheese and meats. Thankfully they had a wide variety and very a helpful waiter who made sure my choices were animal product free. But first I must acknowledge the atmosphere of this place. It is a traditional Italian home and family like environment. With what looks like hundreds of pictures of Italian culture; family, love, togetherness and the appreciation for the simplicity of enjoying one another's company during a delicious Italian freshly made meal. 

First the bread with the oil and vinegar was in my option delicious. The bread tasted fresh and very soft.  I ordered the Apple Gorgonzola salad (I hope I spelled that right) and I must say this salad was absolutely amazing. Obviously I had the Gorgonzola cheese removed so I'm not sure how it tastes with it but It was sure good without it. I was able to share a small with my girlfriend and it was plenty enough plus enough for take home. To remind you I am a big guy 6'6 ft tall and I weigh 275lbs and just half of their small salad gave me exactly what I was looking for. 
For my main course I had the veggie pizza and needless to say I ate the entire thing. It was just scrumptious!
The best part of the experience was We having the pleasure to meet one of the managers Lindsey Luzier. She just happened to be there and made sure our welcome was a warm one. She was very friendly and accommodating. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. 

From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out I was amazed and convinced that this place will definitely be a must revisit for me.",GTFnwya4c77RFyHTQXhZFA,1,1,5,uC21BVGKkOdfIc1KjkGf_w

With a party of about twenty, we ordered several large plates to share.  

To start, we began with the Chopped Antipasto Salad ($15.99).  This was probably the only tasty thing I enjoyed and I definitely didn't get enough of it.  Fried Calamari ($14.99) was the next to arrive.  When it comes down to it, one can never mess up calamari as long as you eat it while it's hot.  Some of the entrees I had a taste of included the Pepperoni Pizza ($19.99), Spaghetti Meat Balls $21.99), Chicken Marsala ($24.99), and Veal Limone ($24.99).  The pizza was not good, period.  The spaghetti meatballs was not bad, and the chicken marsala was the only decent entree available.  The real disgusting dish was the veal though. Blah!  It looked bad and tasted bad. 

When it came down to it, the dinner cost me $40 and I was still starving when I left.  It was such a waste! 

Service was okay - not bad, not exceptionally good.  Just average.

Caesar salad- disappointing that they got rid of  serving anchovies and lemon on the side since that was made it into a good, real Caesar. It's not that hard to keep small cans of anchovies around since they keep for ages. 

Caprese salad- it's standard and hard to screw up. The components were all fresh. 

Stuffed mushrooms- in a huge portion restaurant it came with 6 small crimini mushrooms. They were decent, but nothing standout. 

Veal Parmigiana- it was okay...the breading soggy with oil. I've had this at other Bucas, where it was much better. My brother wanted eggplant, but that was something taken off the menu as well because there's an eggplant shortage currently.

4 Cheese pizza- Parmesan, ricotta, mozzarella and provolone cheeses were fine, but there was something missing. This didn't have sauce so it was more like garlic cheese bread. I put some more parmesan and some red pepper to give it something more. 

Baked ziti- this was pretty decent with a tomato creamy sauce. Too bad this wasn't something we ordered a big portion of, but a buca individual serving that was free taste from a coupon I found on the Yelp page. 

White and red pitchers of sangria- good flavors, but didn't even feel a buzz and I'm a cheap drunk.

I went here only because I had family in town and they wanted to have dinner here. 

The food was OK, very overpriced but half decent. I am not a huge fan of the whole ""family style"" dishes where they are meant for sharing. My finance is a vegetarian, i am a meat eater... see the problem?

So we end up paying nearly 70 dollars when all is said and done. Not outrageous but for that price I would have picked an authentic Italian restaurant. 

So a number of days later my finance is checking his CC statement and somehow our 70 meal turned into a 140 dollar charge! We drove over to the restaurant and spoke directly to the manager. He was able to confirm the server had ""somehow"" given herself a 70 dollar tip. The manager said he would take care of this and call us when he did a little investigating.  

After a few days the manager said somehow the server had ""accidentally"" switched the tip and the total amount up. I have worked in food service before and I don't even know how that is possible. The manager said they would reverse the charge but corporate needed to do this and could take up to 2 weeks. Two weeks is an awfully long time to wait for a mistake, their mistake, to be corrected. 

Eventually the charge was corrected but the company never reached out to apologize or try to make it right. That right there sealed the fact that I would never return to this location or any of their others.

Yesterday, he decided to take me out as a surprise dinner date. 

Upon arriving, we were seated the the waitress came to our table to take our order. We ordered our drinks and ordered the pasta that we love so much, the Penne Arrabiata. After we ordered the waitress gave us an attitude and look as if saying, ""is that really all you're going to order?"" We just smiled at her politely, and eventually she went to put our order in. Although it did seem kind of rude, we just brushed it off because they were pretty busy that day.

One of the things we love most about Buca is the bread. After placing our order, we waited patiently for our bread. Sadly, it never came. We saw that same waitress bring bread and attend to everyone else's table but out own. The only time she came by our table was to bring out our actual meal. The penne arrabiata was good as always, but sadly not even that can make me give this place any higher of a rating. 

Besides the lack of bread, our cups of water needed to be refilled and not once did she come by to check on us. I even made eye contact with her a few times and tried to get her attention, but she never stopped by our table to check on anything. My boyfriend, who was at the edge of the booth even drank all of his water and placed it at the edge of the table to see if anyone would notice, but no one did. 

Sadly, the dinner at Buca was definitely one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. I will just have to find a new one to go to.",Nh-ztLj1IxS8ROHQqDFSiQ,7,2,1,5hHoCa-MLcd4FgdIJyLv1Q

We just came from dinner there and were extremely disappointed. This was my first experience at the restaurant and I was far from impressed. 
From the get go it was quite shady and unprofessional. We called about 20 minutes ahead of arriving and asked what the wait time was. We were told about 20 minutes so decided to head in. 
When we got there, there was no wait and we were seated in the empty bar table area. We had never been to this location and didn't even realize there was another section to the restaurant. Our ""server"" was actually the bartender. While she was nice, it appeared that she cared more about increasing our bill instead of our experience. i.e when we asked if it comes with bread the server asked if we wanted garlic or traditional, knowing full well that there was complimentary bread but wanted to charge so the bill was higher (she only mentioned that it's complimentary after we said no to their ~$10 bread on the menu, which she pointed to). In addition, our beers arrived extremely large (at least 750cc to 1L). She never mentioned that there were two sizes and just gave us the larger, more expensive beers (the bill mentioned almost $10 each!!). 
We received our $24 entree within less than five minutes of ordering it (somebody said microwave). It was large and a decent size for two, however was not very tasty and was a bit cold after few bites. After our entree had been on the table for about ten minutes, we received our beers. Ten minutes after that we got complimentary bread and waters. Definitely not how the order of service is supposed to go :(
The bar area was extremely cold to the point that we couldn't even finish our beers. When we got up to go to the restroom we realized that there was a much larger, warmer and vivid area (we were the only people at the bar at this point). We should have been asked if we wanted to sit in the bar area or the main dining area and since it was our first time we just assumed the bar was the main restaurant. 
We never saw our ""server"" at our table for the rest of the evening. She just yelled from across the bar if we wanted desert or the check. She dropped the check and never came to pick it up. After waiting more than ten minutes we went to the bar and paid because we could not sit freezing any longer. 
It was terrible and we will not go back.",RJvdpmNCHrLvM7um05FMZg,0,0,1,S8nW2u2QBuIiz5M1vFpUqQ

The Pizza Angelo is amazing, although different. The Calamari is made just right, in my opinion, the marinara sauce that comes with the calamari is even better than the marinara that is topped on the spaghetti. Maybe it's the spicy taste. The Tiramisu is very ""rum""ified. The Cheese Cannoli is great in a comfort food way. The garlic mozzarella bread is so good, you might just want to eat it all night. The salads aren't all that amazing, just salad. 

The waiters and waitresses are very pleasant. So.. the decor can be overwhelming for some folks, but for others (like myself), it's immediately lovable. A good suggestion is to come with a group, or at least 3 peeps. That way, you can taste more varieties without taking home leftovers (not that is it bad).

Both Shelby and Jacqueline were extremely kind and professional-they really know how to set up an excellent dinner! Even though the restaurant was very busy, we had a private room for our guests and the food kept coming! Hot, fresh and scrumptious! We received many compliments on the quality and taste of the different menu items, and all of our guests were very pleased, and and very full! 
We especially appreciate that we were allowed to substitute an entree for an appetizer- it was a wise decision because everyone LOVED the lasagna!

I came here with a group as always so we got the large portions of the stuffed mushrooms, calamari, shrimp fra diavolo, eggplant Parmesan, prosciutto stuffed chicken, spaghetti and meatballs and an everything pizza. For dessert we had a tiramisu and strawberry cake.

I'm not going to individually rate each food and go into detail as nothing really stands out. Nothing special. The food is inconsistent. We came here a few months ago and pretty much got the same items on the menu - sometimes the food is dry, sometimes drowning in sauce.

Second perk of being outside the strip. Due to being less busy, our waitress was more attentive and a lot of friendliness was felt.

As a party of four we got two lunch portions of spaghetti and a salad (one of each) and the small family portion of the spicy chicken pasta. We also ordered a small order of garlic bread and we were stuffed! The meal comes with regular bread but it's cold so I recommend the garlic bread. Small portion is about 8-9 sliced pieces. The large is about 5-6 more slices.

This is my 2nd experience at this location, first time was last year at my cousin's graduation - food tasted fresh, hot and the service was impeccable.  This trip?? Horrible.  Our cousins were visiting from New York and a few of us from San Diego drove over to meet them; there was a total of 14 in our party.  The waiter (Kevin I think) seemed friendly when a few of us first arrived but then quickly got overwhelmed.

We ordered the di Beppo salad, Cesar salad, green beans, baked ziti, eggplant parmesan, veal marsala, chicken marsala and calamari.  The salads were great, good flavor, cold and crisp.  Calamari was excellent, comes in a huge martini glass (tentacles and everything)!! The breading is light, not greasy and you can actually taste the calamari which is extremely tender.  The baked ziti was extremely dry, very little sauce.  Both marsala dishes came covered in a thick sauce which seemed more like a glaze rather than an actual marsala sauce; the meats were tender though.  All of the food (minus the salads) came out luke warm.

The green beans were the biggest disappointment; one of my aunts is a vegetarian, and this is one of her favorites.  We placed two orders to start, but both lacked flavor and seemed like the beans were previously frozen.  She sent one of the plates back and was brought a ""fresh, hot batch.""  However this one was worse than the first two - no flavor, chewy and tasted like they had been quickly defrosted. 

This is usually such a fun restaurant to come too and have family style meals; I've been to multiple locations but this one is the worst one by far.  I know restaurants have off nights but this was extremely disappointing.",84pCpTCfbhXBbzjw-g_Rhw,3,1,2,ldmaGbpcgd9kF5-6PW3RSA

But, there was so much crap on the table that it felt like we were dining at a 4 person table. After we were seated, it took our server a few minutes to get to us. We get it, it's super busy! However, the server we got had a major attitude. She was very curt and fast w/ us even when we were asking questions about the menu. We just brushed it off because we understand it was busy! 

But, an attitude like that can get super annoying QUICK. She took our food. Every time she came by she would serve us w/ the biggest grumpy face I'd ever seen. I've worked at a restaurant before and I always tried to be nice even if it's busy. Life is too short to be a sour pus. 

The food was okay. We got the platter, spicy chicken rigatoni, supremo Italiano pizza, stuffed shells and tiramisu. Everything was okay. The platter was the best thing on the menu. It comes w/ fried calamari and shrimp. They ran out of mozzarella sticks so they gave us extra calamari and shrimp to make up for it. The shrimp had a nice kick to it. 

Spicy chicken rigatoni was cooked too al dente for my taste. The sauce was not spicy at all. The portion was HUGE! We weren't able to finish all of it. 

Supremo Italiano pizza was ok. We got a small portion that was perfect for us all to enjoy along w/ the appetizer. 

The stuffed shells were good especially w/ the marinara sauce it came with. 

The biggest downer was the tiramisu. It was NASTY. They made a special ""Holiday"" tiramisu that looked and tasted terrible. Normally, it comes in a nice bowl w/ chocolate powder on top. This time we just got a slice that they just threw on a plate.

I had the Penne Ala Vodka and the Mozzarella Caprese. Delicious! (I split this with three people and I still had some food left over to take home)",H9_IXMIxRQYyzOUAcGFJHA,0,0,4,Wn1lbzlzYi-heV8Z0RRH4A

Food was plentiful and hot, though a lil slow in coming out...45 min between salad and pasta.  They forgot lil things like bread and salt and pepper but we were a large noisy group.  Food was OK. Service OK. But the fact we all sat together and no issues with ordering and all food came out together for whole group (40 people) priceless.",3hNsTGeEw_edCBWDIYKDaA,0,0,4,cY7K0tnLLm6SmkjT5mv6ig

Each time we have gone in the last year or so it seems to be going downhill.  Upon getting there and sitting down as i was scooting my chair in, i stuck my hand in gum, went to the bathroom to wash my hand and it smelled of mildew, but its a bathroom so maybe it wasnt?  :/  Previously we got small plates for bread and large plates for dinner, so when dinner came we stacked up our plates and the server saw us but never brought new plates so we had to unstack and use the small plates to eat on.  Our spaghetti had meat but not really any sauce.  It tasted like a bowl of plain noodles, I was extremely disappointed.  We also had ordered a large lasagna and the server, Dale, told us all that was left was a piece that was 3/4 the size of the large that he could give us and charge us for a small or wait 45 minutes.  We said ok but we're very disappointed in the piece we got.  It was really about 3/4 the size of the small, maybe he thought we had never been there but I was pretty upset.  We ate most of it and my youngest slept through dinner.  Luckily we also had pizza for.him because there was not enough left to feed him because of their lack of preparedness at 440 just before dinner rolled around.   Dale was nice but the food was the main issue this time.  We probably won't be back for a long while.",nCb3xVAMRJ4SIwS1FkHB3A,1,0,3,T1zBiE5DXmrTgbCdxreh-Q

This night we went in just the 2 of us.
When we were seated I think Dinner hours just started not too many people here yet but while we sat there more came in but service was slow.

We ordered the Speghetti with meat sauce family style,
You do get a lot and we ended up taking a lot home I think because we filled up on bread.
We ordered the cheesy bread and we got 4 pieces under the appetizers for $13.99!!!
It was the Cheesy Bread Florentine
Parmesan, mozzarella, provolone, spinach, Roma tomatoes, garlic and Alfredo sauce melted on top of our house-baked Italian bread.
If you go to the web page or the menu and look at this bread it has tomatoes!!! Check my picture out it had a couple of small pieces scattered over all 4 pieces. This is a JOKE!! We were going to say something but my husband was mad and said forget it , it will be our last time going here.
The regular bread came out first and we were pretty hungry ate that and while we waited for our dinner which seemed to be taking forever we ordered the appetizer of cheese bread.
The Spaghetti finally came out after we had ate our regular bread and the appetizer
and we were by then getting full on Bread!
So the picture shows how much Spaghetti we ended up going home with,
Over all I think were better off going to a  authentic Italian restaurant with a good reputation than going to a chain restaurant.
The service this night here was not too good. The server seemed to disappear for awhile before we seen her again.
We left not too happy spending what we did and not getting our moneys worth,",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,1,1,2,F4pgJWs5vwfzZtSNDrjvRg

I ordered a small chicken carbonara to go and it was enough to bring to a potluck. The pasta was not dry and it was very flavorful. The bits of bacon gave it more taste.

What concerned me the most is their customer service. There was NO customer service in this restaurant at all. The host was busy talking with who seems to be the manager and they didn't even acknowledge my presence when I was right in front of them. I also received no help when I was at the take out counter. I was standing there unattended for a good 5-10 minutes before someone even asked me if I was being helped, even though so many servers came and passed by me (they were even making eye contact with me).

Their online ordering system also needs more improvement. I ordered online and received my confirmation email, so I thought it was all good. When someone finally helped me, they told me that they cancelled my order because my payment didn't go through. All this time I was unaware that they cancelled it without notification so I had to wait at the restaurant even more so they could prepare my order. The person I was talking to seemed to blame me because of my cancelled payment (even though I used the same card I put in online) and was not apologetic for the inconvenience.

Overall it was such a disappointing visit. I wouldn't mind eating at Buca di Beppo but I will definitely go to another location.",gvs53lmnU-rwlwjOGstMFw,0,0,2,ZQtwiuDlbl6HBbdRiQm7jQ

They were in the side dish section, but to me it was a real meal lol. Our server was great and was trying to accommodate my needs, too bad in the kitchen they were not really prepared ( no ranch and no tartare sauces). The service is very fast. As for the price, this place is only convenient when you go there with your entire family. So you can order one plate of spaghetti for like 30 bucks and be full. Me and my boyfriend are not big eaters, so it was a little bit of a waste for us. The sour note was that when I ordered my wine I made sure that they would bring me the house wine, it was supposed to be around 8 dollars a glass. And when the check arrived we saw that they charged us 15 dollars. Is it just a mistake? I don't think so. We will not come back.",wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,0,0,2,_vYYjUnjQrZ5ec6U5SfoYg

He served the table behind us and a couple were seated as we were taking our order and they were served their BILL before we were served our entree. Our server told us that our entree would be out shortly and then went to another table (who was also seated after us and left before we got our entree) and chatted with them for about 10 minutes. When he took their credit card for processing he noticed that we still had no entree on our table and clearly scrambled. He ran to get it and it was obvious that our dish had been sitting for several minutes. It was dried out and was very light on marinara sauce. We asked for a separate dish of marinara. He went to input the order behind the bar but started serving patrons at the bar instead. After several more minutes we were able to flag down Nick to ask for a manager and he kindly offered assistance. He explained that the manager had to drive to another Buca location to pick up marinara sauce because this ITALIAN restaurant had run out! 

This highly disappointing experience wasn't entirely our servers fault I admit. However the situation would have been avoided if he had just communicated with us anything instead of finding ways to avoid us. Granted he took the dish off of our bill and comped a glass of wine which was nice but the damage was done. I love Buca and they haven't lost me as a customer but this location has.
