108029,2010-07-30,3,cW-guonyUbsjZ7b7tXauHw,"You have got to be kidding! As if Las Vegas needs any more contributions to it's notable lack of culture, authenticity and overall blandness. Here you have a place that is touting a new kind of BBQ, ""Las Vegas Style"". Now if by saying ""Vegas Style BBQ"" means that nothing that you do is actually barbecued, then Sassy Sal's has accomplished great things. Now I know that I'm sounding a bit like a LV hater, but I'm not. I just believe that the reputation that Vegas has as a cultural void need not be enhanced anymore. When you walk into a restaurant (or outside for that matter) and you do not smell any food cooking, this is not a good sign. When you walk up to, or into a BBQ restaurant and you don't smell any food cooking, or more importantly any smoke, or other aromas that define the style, you are definitely in trouble. I'll say it again, there is nothing at Sassy Sal's that is actually barbecued. Let me explain. I ordered a sampler (Ribs, Pulled Pork, Brisket, Hot Link and 2 sides), plus a 1/4 chicken. Cost around $20. Not too bad, except that $4 of it was the leg and chicken thigh. I watched the cook pull some ribs and a hot link from the cooler and put them on a grill. Then the other meats were re-heated somehow (probably in the microwave) and then sauce was applied. NOTE: Just by putting BBQ sauce on something does not make it BBQ. As we all know there are many great styles like Memphis Dry Rub that do not use sauce at all. The ribs and pork were decent in texture, but were obviously baked and or boiled first, then heated back up (no rub, no marinade or other seasoning). The brisket was terrible. Dry almost like jerky (though jerky would be much better) no smoke ring, no grill flavor (any Texan would be appalled). The chicken never even saw the grill, I got it ""Cajun style"", seemed to be boiled, then broiled, with some pre-mixed seasoning sprinkled on top. I'll give a nod to the potato salad because they used nice red potatoes and fresh veg, but it was quite salty and unbalanced. The staff was friendly and the service was quick. The best items were the Hot Link and Beans. However it does not take a culinary genius to buy some decent sausage and open a can of beans. By the way, the obviously canned beans were the only thing that had any smoky flavor whatsoever. Last but not least there were the 3 mini buns that were included with the sampler. I figured, hey that's a nice touch, maybe some small dinner rolls, or slider buns to use with the pork. THEY TOOK A HOT DOG BUN AND CUT IT INTO 3 PIECES! Now I could go on and on, but please, if you are going to promote something that is called BBQ then you'd better Barbecue something (low, slow and smoky, or fast, hot and smoky, I don't care). If not, at least you could include a flavor step such as a spice rub, or marinade, maybe even some liquid smoke if you have to. Just give it something, pretend like you care. You could show that you actually give a damn about what you are offering. You could help positively contribute to the local food culture instead of robbing people of experience, all while arrogantly claiming to be creating a ""Style"". And the story goes on and on.

265688,2010-07-29,1,cW-guonyUbsjZ7b7tXauHw,"Sassy Sal's does some pretty darn good BBQ for a value price. A sandwich and a side for about 6 bucks ain't bad in this economy. Their BBQ is a good combo of sweet and tangy, leaning more towards the sweet side. The Psycho fries are, indeed, inSANE! I normally don't dig spicy food but I'm all over these. Unfortunately, they also tend to end up all over me. They are coated in two kinds of sauce and kinda messy. 

Two reasons why I'm not giving this five stars- number one, the last time we were there we had to wait an ungodly amount of time for our food, because someone messed up the fried pickles. (which were kinda so-so anyway) Our food still came out hot, thank goodness, but it was an awful long wait.

The second reason is because they took out the tables. :( My fiance and I used to go there for lunch (he works nearby) but now with no place to sit we'd either have to eat in the car or find some place in the ungodly hot outdoors to eat. Bleh.",WbJuDPwlDctt7QD8nQhetw,0,0,4,rBrkCHrxFZfGAJ0U9XS_gQ

Beef brisket is nice and tender and flavorful.  The pork ribs were okay.  I think if they add more of their tasty BBQ sauce to completely cover them I'd love them much more.  I just tried their classic burger and my husband stole it from me.  He loved the flavor from the patty and he didn't have to smother the thing in mayo and mustard like he does with most of the burgers he tries.

408937,2013-03-23,0,cW-guonyUbsjZ7b7tXauHw,"Tuesday is Buck a Rib day with purchase of medium or 2 small sides. Limit 24 ;-)

So, I decided to give this place a try after walking passed it, on my way to my favorite place in Vegas...Retro Bakery.

You know how people always say, ""I really wanted to like this place""? Well, don't worry; I'm not going to say that. However, I will say this...Yet another BBQ place that I was disappointed in.

Here's why...

I ordered the Daily Deal to go, which was, buck a rib day & 2 small sides; collard greens & Mac & cheese.

First of all, I asked if they had sweet tea. The answer was yes. So, I was happy about that, or should I say the expectation of sweet tea. The reality of it however, was this; a cup filled with simple syrup first, and then filled with the sweet tea & handed to me. No stirring or shaking or anything. Sadly, it was not very good.

I waited a total of about 10 minutes or so to receive my order. When I finally arrived home & after having done my Food Porn photo shoot for Yelp, I grabbed some hot sauce, (I prefer Red Devil) for my greens & Mac & cheese. I tasted the greens & the Mac first, prior to saucing them. I will say this, the greens were very good. They were slightly sweet & had a good twang to them, from the vinegar. The Mac was pale & didn't look very pleasing, however, it was pretty good & not too bland, and like a lot of Mac you get from BBQ places. As far as the ribs go; they were mediocre, at best. No seasoning to the meat really. All I could taste was the BBQ sauce, which was pretty lackluster & not sassy at all.

Overall, I probably wouldn't really recommend this place. I would rather go to Famous Dave's; for a chain, that place is pretty good & has some great sauces.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,3,0,2,WebqsmMyjpTJIdXpb2JDbQ

1st stop, H and H BBQ ( separate review on that ) - i had to make it to way north lv for a meeting, the 'q sitting on my front seat as i'm driving - and yes, damn straight - i was plucking pieces of hot link at each stop light, somehow, i avoided the sauce on the shirt. 

lo and behold, my meeting is a short block from one of my favs - retro bakery ! cupcakes baby !! I barely made it to my meeting so the 'Q had to sit on the front seat a little longer - breeze thru the mtg ( one of those, i see the lips moving, but i'll be damned if i could tell you what anyone was saying ! ) jumped in the car, planned to wolf the 'q down in the retro parking lot. i get there and i see the sign for Sassy Sal's . hmmmmmm 

F- it ! save the H and H for dinner, i go into SS, order a link sammie w/ mac and cheese ( $6 ) - i book on down to Retro order up some cupcakes. 

Return to Sassy Sal's - get the food, plop my booty back in the car, open up the container and what do i see a link swimming in melted cheese - huh ?!?! of course, later , i see Scott's review on the place and i laugh about the cheese . I ain't a BBQ affectionato - wasn't born in texas, memphis, kansas city , etc etc, grew up on the grilled/charcoaled summertime family meals and didn't get the ""bug"" until college. So i don't have too much room to talk, but dang it, there's somethin' sacrilegious about putting cheese on 'q - it ain't right ! 

still, push aside the cheese and it's a decent sammie and the M&C - good stuff - might give a slight nod to H an H on the M&C but i tell ya - more value at Sassy's.",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,1,1,3,brJI0DVjVj-HXn9uX3kHfQ

He catered our wedding for an unbelievable price, delivered and even let us use chafing dishes! 

When we first got in contact we set up a tasting where he let us sample the pulled chicken, pulled pork and the brisket and his various sauces, which my fiance and I couldn't get enough of. We got the chicken without a sauce, which was great for the kids in attendance and was still extremely moist and had a great smokey flavor to the meat. We also got the Piedmont Pork which is a pulled pork in an INCREDIBLE vinegar sauce. The true hit at our wedding was the brisket!

Traveled well across Vegas to get to this little spot.  I had the small sampler, so I could try a little bit of everything.  The pulled pork and brisket were on the tough side; the pork was very dry and the brisket was fatty.  The ribs were okay (not fall-off-the-bone) and definitely had the best tasting BBQ sauce on it (did I fail to mention that every meat has its own sauce?).  In lieu of the hot link, I ordered the pulled chicken (which they graciously allowed to substitute) which was by far the most unique tasting.  Not bad, not great.  It came with seasoned steak fries (always a favorite) and a choice of two breads--I chose the cornbread and Texas toast (which was made hot and fresh).  I gotta give it points though for the portions and the price and the friendliness of the employees (apparently under new management).  Also, note that there are only 3 tables in the dining area, so I'm guessing it doesn't get very crowded (or, plan for take out).",QZDS5x8YE7KWsOBhXmw0Fg,1,0,3,munE0XG9SiYr9F8x4zjNpw
1811769,2010-01-10,0,cW-guonyUbsjZ7b7tXauHw,"I used to live in the neighborhood of Sassy Sal's but never had a chance to pick up a bite. A few months ago I returned to LV and made a beeline to the place one night when looking for some solid tasty vittles close to home. It hit the mark.

I had a chance to sample the brisket and the pulled pork, both which contained a solid balance of spice and flavor. The Sassy Sauce is very delicious on anything it touches. Their parmesan garlic fries had ample garlic, but the cheese needed work. A slightly heavier dusting would have worked, and the cheese looked like the stuff out of a Kraft container. C'mon Sal's, splurge a bit for the real deal!

Though Sassy Sal's makes everything fresh when you order it, it does take a good while. My order for two took at least 10 minutes to arrive. Nothing was cold, all was served nice and hot fresh from the kitchen.

I did have to deduct one star for the slow service and the parmesan debacle. Regardless I'll certainly be stopping in for more the next time I am in town.",UhrGgnCuHCWyNrEco3mDTA,1,0,4,Cxl22tj6gkGJgRPpzO_Hag
2090215,2014-06-07,0,cW-guonyUbsjZ7b7tXauHw,"I have to say that I hated EVERYTHING I just ordered. I am so offended by the fact that this place eve DARES to call itself a bbq joint. The potato salad was filled with UNCOOKED potatoes. COME ON! You can't get POTATO SALAD RIGHT??? Then they give me these collard greens that were flavorless and CRUNCHY??? They are supposed to be TENDER AND FLAVORFUL! Now on to the spectacularly bland and suburban dry to the touch so called cornbread. UGH! Now to the best part. And I say best because I had to throw everything else in the garbage in disgust! The brisket. It was tender and very well marinated/seasoned. Everything except the sauce which reminded me of dark ketchup! Horrible sauce! Lastly...the baby back ribs. They would have been tolerable if they were soaked in a decent sauce. But they weren't so they reminded me of some ribs that should be sold prepackaged to truckers next door at 7-11. Truthfully, I am no race baiter or anything but if I go to a joint serving collard greens and get served by a crew of young high school girls the authenticity is going to be questioned right off the bat. Constructive criticism? Get some SOUL in your food. Spice it up! The girl at the front was sweet and more than likely family but you are running a business. I didn't so much as smell a HINT of bbq happening even when I placed my order. You expect to be punched in the nose with the smooth smell of smoke and sizzling meats hitting you before you even get to taste it! This was a watered down experience and that is being GENEROUS. There are no other places that serve bbq in my neighborhood so I hope they get it together.

This is now the second time we've picked up Sassy Sal's and I can easily say I won't be going back ever again. The menu is all over the place, the restaurant itself looks terrible and the staff is not friendly at all. 

We decided to get a few things to share and order some ribs since they are $1 a piece on Tuesday's. I had an Austin City sandwich which is now the second worst brisket I've ever had behind TC's on S. Durango. It was literally like rubber and almost impossible to eat...no amount of BBQ sauce could fix it. My wife had a pulled pork sandwich that was okay but their pork seems to be really fatty and the meat itself isn't very flavorful. The sides we picked were mac 'n cheese and greens, both subpar at best. I thought the ribs were decent though and about the only reason I can give them more than one star.

To be completely honest, I don't know how this place is still in business. Both times we've been here to pick up food, we were the only ones in the restaurant.

My son and I ate here before picking up cupcakes for his bday. I got the Piedmont Pig sandwich ($7.99 for a combo meal) with fries and a small side of mac-n-cheese. The roll was nicely toasted and filled with a large mound of tender pork, which had a slightly tangy and sweet taste, and was topped with cole slaw. It was the kind of sandwich where no matter how you held it stuff was bound to fall out. It is a BBQ place so of course you're gonna get messy.

I loved the fries and the sauce it came with -- some sort of mayo based sauce with a bunch of spices. The mac-n-cheese, unfortunately, wasn't as good. It was bland, not cheesey enough and not hot enough.

Kids under 5 eat free with a paying adult. Kid's meals come with one side and a drink. My son was a fan of their grilled cheese and fries.

The food is good with a twist of different.  To date I've sampled their pulled pork, quarter chicken (white), and the Sassy Fries.  It's certainly barbecue-y, but not in a Carolina, Memphis, or KC way... so I suppose it is appropriate to ascribe ""Vegas Style"" to this place.

Their meat offerings are tender and well-seasoned, and the fries are mighty good, but the one thing that was a bit off-putting was the consistency of the barbecue sauce.  It was, well, watery and thin.  Good, mind you, but quite runny and transparent.

The next time I go I'm going to ask if they offer dry versions of their meat.  Unfortunately, however, I fear that wet is the only way they prepare their fare.

Price-wise, the place is pretty cheap, especially when compared to other BBQ joints I've been to around the nation.  

At any rate, I'd go back if I needed some BBQ in a pinch and didn't have time to drive several miles to Buzz BBQ on West Craig Rd.  I still prefer the way Memphians get it done in Tennessee, but nevertheless...",GMWHx-rH9r3FgovM9BEBhw,0,1,3,UDD1vqVfH5hTtmi-ssOg9g

The story behind that is the Health Dept. came and said if there isn't a bathroom available to the public then the public can't eat in here. So all the seating was removed but then Sassy Sal's created a pathway through the kitchen to their bathroom and then the Health Dept. gave them a thumb's up and lo and behold booths appear.
Now that I have cleared up the seating/bathroom rumor mill let's move on to what's really important -  THE FOOD:
Not Fair: The pulled pork sandwich comes with coleslaw on it so you could order fries as your side but the pulled chicken sandwich comes with no coleslaw so you had to order coleslaw as your side and then order fries which meant more money spent and not to mention unfair treatment to chicken eaters!!!!!
Last week I represented chicken eaters around the world (free of charge of course) and brought my concerns to what looked like the new owner and he assured me that the pulled chicken sandwich can come with coleslaw on it. He said the reasoning  behind having cole slaw on the pulled pork sandwich only is that it is a southern tradition. I will hold the owner to his word on my next visit...
I love the fries here-it's steak fries (thicker than regular fries but thinner than wedge fries) They put what looks like cajun seasoning all over it and to accompany the fries is a creamy mayo lightly colored orange sauce-YUM!!!!
They now have corn bread that looks like cupcakes and various desserts are now offered here-FYI-only the cobbler is made in house however. The owner kept trying to sell us the desserts but I wanted so badly to tell him that with Retro Bakery only a few steps away if I'm going to spend my hard earned money on sweets as well as calories I'm walking to Retro Bakery, Sorry new Mr. Owner.",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,2,3,3,jBHt-RBwtIWwxf9c4KUNRA

Ribs and pulled pork taste the exact same. Even sassy sals BBQ sauce just leaves you with a tomato ketchup after taste.  My hot link was cut length wise and grilled again. So it was even dryer then if they would have just left it whole...  Idk I had high hopes for sassy sals. But it just seems like they don't care at all. BBQ is about leaving people speechless. So much they don't even wanna talk because their busy eating.  Good BBQ places have a line out the door at all hours of the day. I have yet to see someone on the north side do this.. It sucks. I wish rolling smoke or john mills, even famous Dave's would open a location up north. Or maybe even the smoking pig truck on the new horse and forte apache exit will get a walk in location soon. Ugh can't believe I wasted $27.00 +$5 tip. Never again.",WAb5zPq711dVH7GzxZpLNw,1,0,1,vpEuJcrxx165me3iAz9Xkw

Their claim to fame is ""Vegas-Style"" BBQ. Looking at the menu everything is very reasonably priced and they have beef,pork,chicken & links plus burgers and all the standard bbq sides and red skin potato salad.

It's a real small place next to DQ and it has 6 small tables is painted purple and has a flat screen on the wall to watch while you wait & you will wait.

Well I tied the beef brisket,pulled pork & hot link sandwiches plus mac n cheese,coleslaw & red skin potato salad.

$5.99-for a sandwich & 1 side.-What a deal!!

all the sandwiches come covered in cheese, onions and sweet bbq sauce -that's VEGAS-Style?!

They smoke their meat so it was real tasty I dont get why they smother it in a sweet bbq sauce. The pork sandwich was the best with coleslaw on it and the bbq sauce mixed real well.

The link & brisket were good but I'd rather skip the VEGAS-stuff. Mac N cheese was weak, potato sald was alittle runny but the colslaw was quite a suprise. real good.

This place has good prices & good meat-just know how to order it without sauce & it's a winner.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,9,4,3,3kLzLekrX_KYTY5hfSE8ng

My favorites are the Ribs, brisket and sausage but these are my favorites at every bbq place. The sausage has the perfect amount of spicyness. Meats have always been cooked to my likeness. I like to get the sauces on the side because Sal has about 5different kinds of sauce for the different meats. I only use 2 the brisket and rib sauces. Different flavors for different palates I guess. My tastes are different than most ppl probably. I like mustard with my sausage and bbq chicken without any sauce. I think the staff is friendly. I have never had a problem with my order everything is always on point in my opinion. The cook/owner is a quiet guy but I have talk with him once b4 and he seems friendly I think he is just the quiet type. My fav sides are the mac n cheese and the beans. I always get the small feast for my family. Prices are reasonable compared to other bbq places in town like Famous Daves.

4845530,2011-08-14,1,cW-guonyUbsjZ7b7tXauHw,"I was visiting my parents on the northwest side of town and we decided to try Sassy Sal's for dinner.  My first thought when looking at the menu was that the items were reasonably priced - 5.99 for most of the sandwiches.  My mother and I each got the pulled pork and my dad decided to get a combo with 1/3 rack of ribs and one side for 9.99.

Well when we got the food home I was in for a bit of a disappointment.  The menu says of the pulled pork:  ""Slowly smoked seasoned pork topped with creamy coleslaw.""  Fair enough, I'm used to good sized pulled pork sandwiches with a heaping amount of coleslaw.  There was a very moderate portion of pork but the real bummer was that the coleslaw was not on the sandwich, but a minuscule portion on the side in a one ounce cup- filled half way- even trying to spread it thin I couldn't get it to reach to the end of the bun.  The pork itself didn't have much flavor, I was desperately wishing for some sort of sauce to put on to give it some taste, but of course a side of sauce is sixty cents extra.

My dad said the ribs were good but they were also pretty meager and his side of mac and cheese was of similar proportion. 

We did get a side of fries which were very good, other than that the place was a big let down.",GQHALW3lLovKRXhHPEq00g,2,0,2,ms78vikHUhnAaQqP5z58XA

They do close a litte early for Friday and Saturday though...right at the peak hours when most people want to eat dinner on the weekends. The inside is very small too, so it's not good for groups. 

The food was good, but just like most BBQ places, not everything is amazing. I'm from Oklahoma, and they have some of the best smoked BBQ, so I would say that I am pretty picky. The most tasty was the brisket. We had the small sampler which comes with ribs, brisket, pork, sausage, 2 sides and bread. Unless you eat a lot, this is perfect for 2 people. 

Ribs - had a good flavor, not very tender. 
Brisket - Most tasty, very tender with a great smoke flavor. 
Pork - Not tender and the taste was very bland.
Sausage - Very good flavor and spice. 

Cole Slaw - Carolina style, I loved it. 
Mac & Cheese - It was okay, it was not that creamy, and it had been cooked for awhile. 
(Mind you, I went 30 minutes prior to closing) 

Overall, if you're craving smoked BBQ and you're in the NW, it's a overall good choice. I recommend the brisket and sausage, but this is all based off of my first time eating there. I would like to go back and try their burgers.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,2,0,3,Tm83KSCeXHi_-igpHC93pg

I came looking for Seafood Station, but it looks like they closed shop!  Walked around, and figured I would give Sal's another try.

Since I didn't have a huge appetite, I wanted to try a sandwich instead of going crazy with a bbq platter.  I went with the Austin City Sandwich, which is a Texas Style smoked Brisket with cheddar cheese, Texas BBQ sauce, and crispy onion straws. 

The brisket was cooked well and had lots of smokey flavor, and was a very large portioned sandwich!  Great deal for $6.99 too....I will ask for extra BBQ sauce next time, since I really like their sauce, and it wasn't messy enough for me!

I'll probably come back for the sandwiches alone though...give them a try if you are in the neighborhood :)",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,2,1,4,gn_uO355nIINgQ_DPdycvA

The cashier was not helpful in answering our questions about the menu. My friend orders Pulled Pork sandwiches everywhere she goes. Se said this was the driest sandwich she ever ordered. She's pregnant so you know her taste buds are on point. The man behind the counter (the chef) was rude as heck. He was rushing my friend to order so I said Nah we ain't eating here. Then he seemed to be pissed off so I grabbed both my girls and we went next door to Dairy Queens for a hotdog. Needless to say we are never ever going back to this unpleasant food joint. I don't recommend this place to anyone. No welcoming feel.,n6_omiRPyUthZMlpevRgdQ,2,0,1,E5Iy3nALhEsfOkutMgZT_Q

All of the meat was tender and done well.  We had the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, chicken, baked beans, and the mac n cheese.  The price was a bit steep at $90 for the large family meal but I would rather support a local small business over a chain in my neighborhood.  I will go back again but I would recommend taking it to go.  There's not much room to sit down inside and no outside seating available.  The only real down side to the location is the parking.  Little Caesars and 7/11 make parking a real pain in the butt!  But they do have parking in the back of the center.

The same BBQ sauce seems to be used for all of the meats. It has a nice tangy sweet flavor with a little bit of heat. 

Beef brisket: Very tender, but not a strong smoky flavor

Pulled Pork: standard pulled pork drowned in BBQ sauce, not bad but definitely my least fave of the meats.

Pulled chicken: Tender shredded chicken in BBQ sauce, reminded me of when Chic-Fil-A used to make ChickenQ sandwiches. My favorite meat selection!

BBQ Pork Ribs: Fall off the bone perfection with a smoky taste smothered in the above mentioned BBQ sauce. 

Sals famous fries: Crispy, seasoned steak fries with the perfect amount of spice. Extremely generous portion as well. 

The food we ordered fed a family of 6 with quite a bit leftover for just under $50.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,3,2,4,49GIKP0qS_qexixfJWv58A

The Mac and Cheese is made daily with three kinds of cheese.

The mac and cheese was really good, but the greens were amazing! The girl behind the counter warned us that the sweet tea isn't all that popular (or good), but we ordered it anyway.
