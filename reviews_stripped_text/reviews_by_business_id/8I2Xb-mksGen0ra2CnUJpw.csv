Always clean restrooms, nice clean well stocked store and a great Subway inside. Myself and my son will often drive out near Apex to watch the trains or will go exploring up Hwy 93 just North of this location.

1135400,2016-10-08,0,8I2Xb-mksGen0ra2CnUJpw,"I was filling up gas and it stopped at $14.40. I pulled the pump out (holding it in the air) and it kept on going stopping $15.76!! I can understand a pump can get faulty, but I am EXTREMELY disgusted with the customer service I received regarding this incident. None of the managers came out and acknowledged the situation and they refused a refund for the extra $1.36 (something that I didn't really care about anyway). The employees did a test on the pump and found that when they stopped pumping gas, the price would still continue and go up. If it weren't for this test, they wouldn't have refunded my money!!! I am not mad at the fact that I was overcharged, but I am more mad at the principle that they automatically denied the refund without even looking into the situation and the manager didn't even bother to come out to speak to me or apologize at that matter.",HRV_u1DGGM-OzG10ce_gnw,0,0,1,RcCJADdX96hKe5bN6E3Gxg

1298451,2015-09-22,0,8I2Xb-mksGen0ra2CnUJpw,I stop here on a daily basis for fuel and drinks and snacks. Fuel prices are very competitive compared to other truck stops. Sometimes around 4pm this place gets a little crazy and you have to jockey in to position for a fuel pump. The restrooms are always clean. They have a decent supply of commercial truck accessories along with personal products.,faKa3zvARpwwzebcNu7QUw,0,0,5,GMJFfeWfXWq9fXxvTggX6g
1606598,2013-10-10,6,8I2Xb-mksGen0ra2CnUJpw,"I stop at Love's when headed to Caliente or Pioche because it has everything you could need for a road trip. I stopped in to get drinks and snacks for our latest trip and debated getting something from the Godfather's Pizza they have inside. Between Godfather's and Subway the smells were killing me. It just smelled so good and other people thought so too because the line was no joke 20 plus people deep. you can order a whole pizza, but they don't sell it by the slice. They have the mini individual pizzas starting at $3.99 and you can make it a combo blah blah blah. I decided to peep out the jerky section. I remembered they had a lot to chose from the last time I was here and man was I right. I picked out a couple things and then went in search of something ""Hostess"" for my wife. Too bad they only had Little Debbie! It's all good my wife is a fan of her too so the iced honey bun I got her went over well. They have oil for your car, jerky, candy, drinks, pizza and even a gift shop area. Some things are way overpriced but that is to be expected. It's your typical gas station/convenient store with a few extra bonuses.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,7,7,4,MCAxwWeptSx7qFE8jjnoRw

2221532,2018-04-08,0,8I2Xb-mksGen0ra2CnUJpw,"This review is more for the RV storage facility across the street. But they are one in the same business. 

DO NOT trust these people to provide the service they claim to provide.  We pay for two spaces with pper to keep our batteries topped off. And every single time we have made our way up to check on our rig the power is out and our batteries are dead. They fail to keep the other tenants here under control as the have people running a fridge and air conditioning on the 20 amp connection shared by a number of units. What's worse is not only have they completely killed my brand new battery bank but they refuse to do anything about it. This place fails at customer service and fails at even providing the services you pay for.  It looks nice and is apparently fairly secure but that is all. I wouldnt tust them with anything beyond that.

As a trucker there's a long line which blocks truck parking from leaving or parking in the front ( nearest parking spots ).

3971621,2011-09-19,2,8I2Xb-mksGen0ra2CnUJpw,"I stopped here yesterday on the way back from Caliente.  This Love's opened a little more than a year ago, and it's an easy on/off from the freeway.  There is plenty of parking space in front for cars and in the back for trucks.

Gas prices are higher than some places, but they don't gouge you like some freeway gas stations.  The store is fully stocked with snacks, drinks, and all kinds of travel needs.  There's a sub shop and a pizza shop in the mart.  Restrooms are clean (I assume the women's room is).  

This is but one more option when the needle on the gauge is getting into that uncharted territory you'd rather not explore.  It's also a sight for sore eyes when your bladder is that uncomfortable zone and you're not sure you'll be safe until you get to a Starbuck's.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,2,1,4,Itm1mKP80KULlzMCRUgQcA

Inside the station there are plenty of drink and candy options. I ended up getting some of their ice tea, which 1.50 for a huge large cup was a killer deal. Lots of coffee options too, but no ice coffee unfortunately. The bathrooms were large, very clean and well stocked.

4732062,2016-07-30,0,8I2Xb-mksGen0ra2CnUJpw,"We broke down at this station... spent about 6 hours there for our towing service until a good Samaritan / subway sandwich worker saw us take out our jumper cables (to start our generator for air conditioning). He tried to jump the car (even though we said it wasn't the battery)... but then he asked if we spoke to the Love's mechanics. WTF? There are mechanics there??? We just spent 6 hours waiting for a tow in 109 degrees with our dog in heat stroke. In 15 minutes they drove over and helped jump it. Car started, but the mechanic realized our battery wire was burnt. He changed it - the next morning we paid $100 for the mechanic to drive to Vegas to get us a new part and install it. Very nice mechanic... hilarious! 

And they sent us on our way - 

However, I wish they would have realized the alternator was about to go out - we had mentioned the belt sound and the dim lights... but it just didn't click. None of us had any idea that this would  be the first of 5 break downs to come... all for the alternator! 

Anyhow, If you find yourself at this stop - there is a semi truck mechanic area on the other side of the building. No one tells you and it's hard to see. But there are mechanics there. They may be able to help you (7am-11pm). 

Thank you to the Subway Sandwich worker who stopped to help! You were the only one who even looked our way for 6 hours!",hLF7GVROaTP1lUqZc_euDg,1,0,4,8ZMonfLGXsd5kVmAKaOk6A
