It has a good mix of American Chinese food, which satisfies the husband, but also has more traditional dishes. They have all been very tasty so far. I agree with the other reviewers that the prices are a little steep for the serving sizes. Service is always friendly, and the chef seems like he comes out to check on his guests often. 

I'm sure take out is great, too, but we usually dine in. The restaurant is spacious and the ambiance is modern and upscale. It's not a Chinese food dive.

We loved the shrimp spring rolls, such fresh and crispy veggie goodness!  

The kung pow chicken was cooked with high quality chicken, loads of water chestnuts, spiced perfectly in a tasty brown sauce.

The singapore noodles were made perfectly.  

Our waitress,  Bridey was a real delight, eager to make our experience a great one.

The manager came over to make sure we  were satisfied.

Seriously ... they're noodles !! Noodles are cheap and the portion would have been acceptable with a larger portion of noodles. You could skimp on the chicken and shrimp with extra noodles. It's not rocket science. Mongolian beef was good but also pricier than most restaurants. Eggplant dish was so yummy but I recommend cutting the eggplant differently than they do.

Every dish was so fresh and flavorful! It was perfection! My husband and I were so pleased, and excited to try more dishes on the menu. I also had the pleasure to meet Shawn....

1495726,2018-02-19,2,2lUp2T09MltaVT5awHRElA,"The soup was excellent. Other than that, nothing was good.

When we sat down for dinner around 6 pm we were given Chinese noodles, which were stale. We called the owner over who said they were made in the morning and couldn't understand how they could get stale in one day. He then said I'll get you fresh noodles. The ones he brought he tasted the same as the first group. I doubt he had the chef make fresh noodles in 3 minutes time.

My wife ordered Moo Goo Gai Pan and I ordered chicken with broccholi. The waiter presented these and said ""The rice will follow."" Why did the rice have to follow after the main meal was served? Normally they are served together.

The broccholi was ice cold and the chicken was tepid warm.

The moo goo gai pan was tepid warm.

Each dish was only large enough for one person...it was not ""shareable"". When was the last time you ate at a Chinese restaurant and did not have a big enough plate to share? At $12-14 per dish, it was overpriced or undersized.

The main dishes came out about 10 minutes AFTER the soup was served. Normally the main courses are cooked while you eat the soup so there should not have been a 10 minute wait. At this point there were no other ""new arrivals"" waiting to be served.

I offered to pay for the soup but the owner said never mind.  We walked out without eating the cold, undersized dishes (still waiting for the rice to appear).

MAYBE I'll go back and try lunch.",zMY8yPP78f_wiZ41FhdrSg,5,0,1,8dXXPzH6qcfzLuO_Qk-ErQ

The steamed rice was cooked to perfection. Vegetables on both our dishes were crisp and flavorful. My shrimp was perfect and was neither mushy, nor rubbery.

The best part about this place is that it's right down the street from my house.  And the decor on the inside is very nice.  

I thought I would get some take out.  And ordered a shrimp with broccoli.  I asked the gentleman how big are the portions and he informed me that they were family size.  So I placed the order.  


13.95 plus tax.  Said about 10 minutes.  

So the food comes in about 10 minutes.  

Definitely not family size.  I almost was about to say where is the rest? 

The food was cooked but there was absolutely no flavor at all.  

I would never spend 15 bucks on a meal there again.  

New York Chinese food on Fort Apache and spring mountain not only is way better but their small size shrimp and broccoli is not only just as big and more flavorful but half the price. 

In my opinion that's the best Chinese food place around but I wanted to give you guys a try.  

Definitely not worth it and anyone who's looking for the best take out in Summerlin for Chinese go to New York Chinese on Fort Apache and spring mountain.  Best In Town.  

15 bucks will get you a shrimp and whatever 2 egg rolls a wonton soup and you will get change.

If you are looking for Chinese cuisine to rival that of any restaurant in both China Town and on the strip, then I.C. China bistro is the next stop for you. Complete with classic Asian favorites like steamed or fried pork dumplings, to General Tao's chicken. I.C. China also offers a wonderfully sweet and crispy sesame beef and succulent roast duck to appeal to your taste buds. The atmosphere was clean and inviting, complete with an open bar area that features a belly up wood and polished stone bar only steps away from there spacious restaurant seating. The guys and myself started our meal with the spicy IC wontons,(a house special)salt n pepper calamari, crispy asain chicken wings and pan fried pork dumplings. All of which were amazing starters and were better than we even hoped them to be. We then continued to order crispy sesame beef, Pad Thai (in both chicken and shrimp)two orders of crispy roast duck, General Tao's chicken and a succulent moist Asian sea bass(for the groom of course). With every single dish turning out to be the perfect end to an amazing meal. We were then treated to a round of bachelor party shots from their already hospitable owner Shawn. As if the amazing meal wasn't already enough. In short, I have been working in the restaurant hospitality industry for the better part of two decades and let me say that I.C. China is one of the best Chinese food options that I have come across in a long time. Best of luck to you I.C.

Unfortunately, the food needs to be improved. 

We went there on a Saturday afternoon, and ordered:

1. Hot and Sour soup, soup is too vinegary. They use mince pork, rather than pork slivers. Egg drop is a main ingredient and yet it is in chunks. 
It also lacks the taste of a good hot and sour soup. 
2. Seafood combination on a hot platter: fish in this dish, although edible, is starting to emanate a strange odor. Scallops are over cooked. Sauce is too thick. Veggies ( broccoli mainly ) was not first blanched and then stir fried. 

Pricing is slightly high but acceptable.

End of our meal, they turned on loud music, instead of letting us know it was closing time. Then they started turning off the lights while we were still eating.  

Food: fried fish was oily, not crunchy, some pieces had tons of salt and hit peppers, while other pieces had none at all.  Have they heard of mixing things?  Vegetarian egg roll was entirely mushy on the inside.  Won ton Soup portion was big. Fried fish portion small. Spare ribs were medium.  Every sauce was sugary and filled with msg.

2933846,2018-02-25,1,2lUp2T09MltaVT5awHRElA,"Wow!!!!!  This place is legit. It's not slimy, over spiced, too much sugary or salt based sauces... it's the perfect balance of flavors and it's soooooo good. We ordered the buffalo chicken wings and calamari for apps. Calamari was on a bed of cabbage and was tossed with scallion and pepper, definitely was my favorite. It is spicy, but I like spice. The wings were perfect. We made a bleu cheese sauce at home to dip them in. For our main courses we ordered chicken chow fun, which had flat noodles and not the skinnier noodles shown on pic. But it was so good and I didn't care. Orange chicken was insane!!!!. Lightly breaded, and more chicken than breading, and sauce wasn't overly sweet. Sezchuan schrimp which I didn't try. But we had a side of garlic green beans YUM!! And it came with a side of steamed white rice and since we bought over $50 of food, they gave us a choice or fried tempura or chicken fried rice. We chose the fried rice, which was just basic, but good. EVERYTHING was perfect!!!! 

Honestly I'm not a fan of Chinese food, and always have bad experiences with it. But this place was phenomenal.  Will be back often.",UsnVveOndIxCpxvHARI8AA,10,1,5,lMPi5AwJei_Ts4Ir33c5Gw
2952979,2018-05-02,0,2lUp2T09MltaVT5awHRElA,"IC China Bistro is an Americanized, mostly Chinese style restaurant worth a 5-star review! I say mostly Chinese because Pad Thai and Tom Yum soup, which are obviously Thai food, are also included in the menu. I walked in for a quick lunch since I was in the area, and my first impressions were:
-Wow, this place is really clean, spacious, and more elegant than what I had assumed was supposed to be just another usual Chinese takeout type restaurant!

-The food doesn't taste oily or full of MSG! My orange chicken was meaty with a light crispy batter and not overly drenched with sauce. I prefer Panda Express' more tangy-sweet orange sauce, but IC China's version was still good enough for me to finish my plate! My Oolong tea was somewhat lukewarm, and the lunch special fried rice was basically just seasoned with soy sauce and no peas or carrots, but I didn't mind much because I really enjoyed the entree. The banana rolls drizzled with chocolate sauce made for a delicious dessert too! :D
 
-The server was very friendly and attentive, and the manager (Shawn) checked on me personally! I hope they have better luck than the previous Indian buffet restaurant that it replaced. They probably have more people ordering take out than eating in so I wasn't surprised by the empty tables. 

-Great variety on the menu making me wish I had more room in my stomach to try the other entrees! Menu items seem ordinary, but the quality of the cooking was a notch above what I expected so I think that the dishes were reasonably priced with satisfactory portion sizes. This was the first time I felt like I was eating healthier Chinese food, and I'll certainly be returning for more!

-Location can be hard to see, but it's behind the Marie Callender's restaurant that's in the same plaza. Stop by and give it a chance! :)",1o8vB0WKHfV7omrYWB_OLg,1,0,5,x_iLXP9Ihd1B1hypmXKroA

The only plus is the rice was cooked very well. The wings were soggy, gross and grease filled. I tried to eat them and just trashed them.

4484787,2018-06-08,1,2lUp2T09MltaVT5awHRElA,"With all the mostly rave reviews on Yelp, we were surprised to find ourselves alone in this spacious and modern restaurant. It occurred to me later that it had to have been due to the [sad] last game of the VGK Stanley Cup playoffs. Whew! Because this place deserves to be fully occupied every night.

Shawn was a welcoming and engaging host; though he's the owner, he was also our waiter; I guess on such a slow night there was no reason to have more help.

The menu has some typical Chinese-American dishes, along with a smattering of Thai. There are also some interesting chef's specials, at slightly higher prices. We ordered Szechuan Chicken, but with broccoli added, and Singapore Mei Fun with beef. We specified no extra salt and very light on added sugar, and that's exactly what we got. The Szechuan chicken, which is always heavy on soy sauce, has enough salt for even the most iodine-deficient, and sure doesn't need extra. Same with the Mei Fun, which is in a yellow curry. Any time there's a sauce involved, there's no need for more salt, IMHO. You can always add more. But in this case, we were loving both dishes.

To one side of the entry is a small, pretty bar, with stools and some pub tables. They have a happy hour from 3-6. A wine and cocktail list is on the restaurant tables, and they have some interesting cocktails, but I stuck with my Riesling.

With a trendy grey palette, good lighting, engaging music at the perfect volume, friendly service and delicious food, we were so happy to have found I.C. China. With knives on the table and chocolate cake on the dessert menu, it may not be the most authentic representation of Chinese cuisine, but it sure tasted good and felt right.

Oh and the yellow curry isn't your typical yellow curry. It's not made with coconut milk, it had a very different flavor. And the Thai tea did not taste like Thai tea at all. Which is why I'm assuming it was the wrong beverage. If it was Thai tea, I don't recommend it.
 I still give 3 stars because I don't think it was made poorly on purpose, maybe this is just the way they make their dishes and we were not fans:/",gQMQH2hFZHcirlKBAxjj6A,2,0,3,nSIDZfTdpXUOMIJ3vv3q_g

Ordered the following:

Chicken Singapore noodles- over all 4/5 needed a bit more seasoning but overall good texture to the noodles and the veggies in the dish

Mongolian beef spicy- 3.5/5 needed a bit more love. Sauce too sweet for me and needed to be more spicy although I asked.

Vegetable fried rice- 4/5 just your normal fried rice nothing special. Rice wasn't over cooked or drenched in soy sauce.

Walked into this place and it was a no mans land. Super rad decor and the bar had some great offerings for someone's visit it it. Parking was easy street and they have plenty of seating.
