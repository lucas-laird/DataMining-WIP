Chicken Wrap- Chicken is diced and served with tzatziki sauce. Only reason why I give it a 3 stars is cause the chicken is diced and not shaved like how you normally get at Zankous. Chicken at Mad Greek is not great but its A-OK and the pita bread is nice and chewy and fluffy which I like. The cucumber yogurt sauce that comes with the wrap is so addictive, I seriously place it all over my wrap and my rice. The rice that comes with the dish has good flavor too, not mush or firm. All the wraps come in a meal so you have to get a drink even though you don't want to. 

Shawarmah Wrap- Beef and lamb. I didn't order this but my friends did. They said it was good. The meats were sliced thinly and meat had good flavor. For some reason it looked dry to me but they said it was fine. 

Fried Mushroom- Must get! When I ordered it, the mushrooms were freshly fried and came with the yummy yogurt sauce which is a great pair with the fried vegetable. 

The cafe is not cheap and its not the nicest looking place. But overall, its decent greek food and is a place I continue to stop by because it became more of a tradition for me if anything.",-3GwonyrKEu4tHSO11bSRQ,3,2,3,_GYmIbRgS-p6W8HRClftHA

I've passed by this place many times before but was very iffy of eating at restaurants in the middle of the desert in no-where-ville.  But after passing by it so many times and seeing all the Greeky decorations, I had to try it! After all, it has been standing in the middle of the desert for quite a while now so something MUST be delicious, right?


RIGHT! Not only is their gyro yummy but it is also jiggaanoormouus!!! The pita is soft and fluffy while the meat is tender and oh so delicious! Their menu also consist of not only Greek but Mexican food along with Mexican chefs in the back, but heck it tasted authentic to me!  

The decor was cute inside, it reminded me of My Big Fat Greek Wedding!

So although its Greek, don't expect an ""OOPPPAAAH"" rather an ""HOLAAAA!"" 

Happy Eating!

We used to love it here when they danced and threw the plates but these days it is more sedate.   If you are playing video poker, they do not give you any drink free - only bar brands...

Well it was getting late and we were hungry so since it was on the way back to our hotel we took a chance and tried it. Now I know what Greek food should taste like because I am Greek and have grown up eating good authentic Greek food since I was born.

If your looking for good authentic Greek food this is the place. The food was AMAZING and reminded me of the Greek food I had in Greece. It was WONDERFUL! My boyfriend had the souvlaki plate and he loved it. He especially enjoyed the cucumber sauce and the portion size. It was huge! I had the Gyro Plate and that was fabulous as well! Huge huge portions. 

Trust me the place is totally worth it and the price can't be beat. If you can get a coupon do it because you will be wanting to take more home. It's truly worth it. Truly worth it!",9JOnwW9bb0R2VI4o5-KKHQ,2,1,5,WXvT55SdlG639JuGLY6nIg

After heading out of Vegas back to the Bay area after a crazy weekend in LV for EDC , we were stuck in traffic and very hungry . We stopped to get gas off the freeway and I instantly panicked when I saw there were no healthy options in sight. I dont care for fast food it always makes my stomach hurt. Plus it was 100 degrees outside and we were in the middle of the desert. I was worrying about the nasty food I was about to be forced to consume .. and then boom this place pops up . I was so happy ! made the bf pull in so quick I think the car made a screeching sound (ok im exaggerating) ..

so the food.. I had the Gyro and fries. Fresh delicious Gyro meat and the fries were perfect and not greasy at all... 
My bf had the same and some deep fried somethings that were tasty. This place is really good and I cant wait to come back and have some more !",bcT4xK_54QJXYhPoq4lTIA,0,0,5,muhqXX-2KLXSi2vqOo8Oow

It sits right in the corner of a little strip mall looking place next to the strip.  I was perplexed by the menu so I asked the kid at the register and sure enough they have NO SHWARMA!  I get that every time I go to the classic Baker restaurant.  I went ahead and got the Mad Gyro which I was told is beef and lamb (not unlike shwarma).  I got it with no onion, peppers or tomatoes.  It was excellent.  The cucumber salad thing that always comes on the side was, as always, delicious.  Rice was perfect.  I will definitely go back there again.  I can highly recommend the Mad Gyro.",n-xYvlrFyhTmPBUObkW-AQ,0,1,3,FZMTOl4fSU6eoAtmQxsLuA

4522952,2008-12-30,1,8oSNaQnLGfbFC0uyRUjfCA,"I remember Mad Greek being featured on Food Network some time ago, but I totally forgot about it on my recent trip to Vegas until my mom brought it up, except with her Chinese accent she pronounced it as ""mah greek."" Naturally, I was thrilled to finally try this place out. Mad Greek serves other classic favorites such as burgers and pastrami sandwiches besides their famed gyro. Apparently there are several Mad Greek locations all centralized near or around Las Vegas. Here's the dealio:

Have been here twice within a span of two days. I went to the one in Baker as well. The first time to check it out, and since I wasn't hungry enough for a gyro, I got a strawberry milkshake, a pistachio baklava, and a spanakopita to go (yes, definitely wasn't hungry). Here I was expecting to be knocked off my feet and my socks rocked the hell off by the shake ('cause apparently my mom has tried it before and loved it--she rarely likes food). It tasted...not really like a strawberry milkshake. The strawberry flavor was completely off and tasted very bland. Ok, way to mess up a strawberry shake.

The pistachio baklava was all right, but had way too much syrup in one layer, so you ended up with this effect of an imbalanced, overpowering sweetness as you chewed through the pastry. The spanakopita...well I have had much better back in the Bay.

The second time I came back I tried the gyro, and my mom ordered the chicken gyro. The fries were soggy and not crispy. The gyro meat, yogurt sauce and rice were all ridiculously overloaded with salt. Not sure how people could stand that level of sodium on their pallet. I wolfed it down despite the saltiness, my determination to finish it driven only by the price (10 bucks) I paid for it; the gyro was, in fact, a huge disappointment. I love gyros and have tried a number of them, but this one was definitely far off from being the ""Best Gyro in the USA."" The chicken gyro was actually quite tasty and less salty.

As the juicy cherry on top of my whole experience here, the prices were ridiculously pricey. Almost 5 bucks for a shake; 10 bucks for the gyro and rice or fries, 4 bucks for a fruit cup that didn't even taste fresh or sweet, etc.

Extra star for the interesting decor and funny ass signs posted around the place. 

I may return in the future to try out the fried zucchini, but until then Mad Greek you make me sad.",q1y9ZPiRHIKJTQdL_W2ZIA,1,0,2,Pu44ASNZiUqCDG1QX93F6A
4578390,2013-02-14,2,8oSNaQnLGfbFC0uyRUjfCA,"Visited The Mad Greek Cafe a couple days ago after the lunchtime rush because I saw the big sign advertising $7.99 lunch specials from the road. I guess I should have known by the fact that there was no one there to turn around but instead I just figured I'd order since I had already walked in. 

I ordered two lunch specials (one of which I was taking to my friend). One was the gyro plate and the other the vegetarian pita sandwich. Each came out about five minutes after I ordered in separate containers. A side of plain rice came with each sandwich and some type of vinegar dressing and the gyro with a yogurt dressing. I picked the vegetarian for my friend and I had the gyro. 

Well, let's say that the gyro was pretty flavorless. Oh, except for the thousands of huge chunks of onions. I ended up pulling out half the thickness of the pita with just raw onions. Total overkill. As for the meat, it was not the fresh meat I was expecting. Kind of dry and very little inside the sandwich. I believe there was a couple tomatoes and perhaps some lettuce. The rice was also flavorless and bland. There was a little pile of lettuce and tomato and more onion for a 'salad' that I didn't quite understand since I thought that some of my sandwich had fallen out but evidently that was a salad. 

My friend wasn't thrilled with his sandwich either. It had feta cheese, avocado and tomato. His reply when I asked how it was ... ""It's okay... too expensive for this though.""

Overall The Mad Greek Cafe is overpriced for what you are getting. I would expect something this bland and unexciting to cost around $4.50 but here they are charging $7.99. 

I would not ever eat here again.",OTJRvjzZmlVvtKO12Gmy1A,2,2,2,0y2P1262oHOvP3guUZkPbw
