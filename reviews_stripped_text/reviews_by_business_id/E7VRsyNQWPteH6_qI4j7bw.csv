They recently forgot to add the sides of white rice to our order, so we called to have the rice delivered to us. The man that answered the phone told us that he would not drop off the rice to us, gave a single order, although we had 4 orders, & only stated that he wouldn't add rice to our order again. I've been in the restaurant business for years, & I know what rice costs them. My staff & I will never order from these cheap asses again.

69188,2015-11-29,0,E7VRsyNQWPteH6_qI4j7bw,"I had a late night craving for Thai food yesterday, after hosting a movie night with two friends.
We decided to try Thai Pepper, because it had good reviews and was located less than 2 miles from our location. 

When we ordered, we were told there would be 1 and a half hour wait time.  We were okay with this... except that the food actually took 3 hours to arrive.  I called the restaurant at least two times to check on the status of the food and about 2 and a half hours in, I was told that the food hadn't even left the restaurant yet.  I asked if we could receive a complimentary appetizer to makeup for the extreme lateness, but we were told that adding it to our order would place us in the back of the order queue and we would have to wait all over again.  WTF

When the food came, we didn't even get the egg rolls we ordered (they ran out apparently), instead we were given fried wontons... at least they tried to be accommodating.  The driver was friendly as well.

Portions were small.  Too much sauce - it was like the food was drowning in a puddle.  In fact, the liquid had spilled all over the inside of the bag and got everywhere in my apartment. 

This is seriously unacceptable.  If they are so busy, then they should hire extra staff.  They should be able to afford it with their high delivery fee and minimum order price requirement.

Thai Pepper sucks.",Fj8wyH-0LewlRq87nLiUzg,0,0,2,Ud26upaxh2MOCfLCyWrJLw

Appetizers - We normally alternate between getting the veggie egg rolls or the pot stickers. They have always been nice and crispy. Never soggy which I find happens a lot when I order take out from other restaurants. 
We have on occasion ordered the Thai dumplings and they are delicious as well but it's just a matter of personal preference! 
For entrees I alternate between yellow curry and green curry - Both are delicious but be warned if you don't specify how spicy you want it you could end up getting a hot surprise! With take out though I've noticed they normally include the spice on the side for you to mix in  yourself! My personal favorite is the green curry with chicken and extra vegetables! Can never go wrong. 
If you're in the mood for something else though the pad thai is delicious as well. I normally get it with mild spice and chicken. Its a generous portion size so you will be full ! 

Only ever tried dessert once - We got the sticky rice with mango - it was good but it is a very very sweet dish. The rice is soaked in a sweet white syrup that tastes kind of like coconut - the mango that came in the dish though was delicious and ripe!

GENERAL: From the outside this restaurant does not look extra special but when you walk in you will be greeted politely and find that the mood is very calm and comfortable. Thai pepper is air conditioned and has a large beautiful bathroom for customers. 

SERVICE: The Thai Pepper staff was friendly and very helpful. They helped us figure out which dishes were the vegan ones and even modified one of the dishes to make it vegan. The food arrive quickly.

FOOD: Thai Peppers food was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. We ordered the Satay Tofu, spring rolls, Vegetable Fried rice (which is NOT vegan but they kindly made it for us without egg.) and other dishes that I cant remember. It was all very flavorful and not oily. It was the kind of food that you have to close your eyes to eat.

I definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone, but especially the hungry vegans who are only surviving their Las Vegas trip with Ronald's Vegan donuts and cheese-less pizza. Go have some dinner! Go to THAI PEPPER!",M6QetURqE-KmFho4iA72MQ,9,7,5,38EQc9AbxpoOQte3bKOWnQ

We placed the order with the anticipation that we would be eating at or around our scheduled lunch time.  Note - the restaurant is barely 5 miles away from our place of employment.

30 minutes after the expected delivery time we contacted Thai Pepper to see what the hold up was as they were now cutting in to our lunchtime and we were starving. Thai Pepper advised that the driver was on the way. Another 30 minutes goes by and we call again.  Thai Pepper gives us the number to the driver to ask him about the delivery time.  The driver states that our place of employment is really far and that he was 15 minutes away. At this point it's beyond ridiculous that is has been 2 hours since the initial order was placed and the driver has the nerve to say that 5 miles is too far!  Seriously?!

We told the driver to forget the order as we could no longer wait and lunch time is now over!

30 minutes later the driver shows up! Are you serious? We told the driver the order was cancelled since he's forgotten the conversation from 30 minutes ago that promised delivery in 15 minutes.

OK - If Lotus of Siam and Thai Style Noodle House are 4 Stars in Vegas then this can't be four stars!!!  If you are desperately starving for ANY Thai and absolutely can not travel or drunk then eat here.

Food - OK, Staff- Friendly, Menu prices - a few are incorrect and they know it.  Appears equal too or more expensive than Chinatown with less quality.

NOT clean! Bathroom and back area...Dump.  Typical old world Asian dive that doesn't understand expectations of new world cleanliness.  Owner doesn't have pride in his product since people keep buying.  Being clean doesn't cost much money.  Just look at the dust and junk around the cash register.. then look up at the 1/8 black filth sticking to the air vents. Then visit the bathroom.  Advice-Take an uber or 25 minute bus ride to Chinatown... eat great food, get a $35/hour message, bring back some Chinese baked goods for breakfast...
He is 200 yards from all the fantastic SLS HOTEL restaurants (go there and get an umami burger!).  It appears the last time they really cleaned was for the wedding 2+ years ago in the other pics.
Unless it is a table top they don't appear to dust and I don't think they own a vacuum (only a broom).  The cooking area appeared ok through the serving window but if the customer area is dirty do you really think the back is spotless?

To be fair - I only ordered Pork w/sticky rice (special of the day), mango sticky rice, and Thai iced coffee.
Pork dish - Tender, rice marginal - stiff, flavor - good but accompanying sauce was very salty.
Mango - perfectly ripeness, rice - fine, all items drenched in condensed milk and Coconut milk making this the sweetest mango sticky rice ever eaten. Thai Iced coffee - strong but very sweet so I drank half.",EN_GC97QtYi3vBZnc-t56Q,0,0,2,X0dIHm8_Di1hXDWcK8z2Ig

Ordered December 25th late night, via Uber Eats (I think) 
Hubs wanted some Chinese delivery, no place was open that we like, and so we settled on this place. While it's not Chinese, they had items he wanted.

He order veggie fried rice, no oil, no egg, no onion. Looked great! Lots of veggies and even basil on top.

Pad Thai no egg, no oil, was made with choice of tofu. Spice level was a kick! 

I wanted to try a tomato basil Pad Kee Mao type of dish and requested no onion, no oil. 
It was not bad! Husband actually stole it from me and said it was the best dish in the whole order.

He ordered the vegetable egg rolls but I'm not sure why because I knew he would only eat one like he always does.

All and all he had a pretty good experience, lots of leftovers, and I enjoyed my baked potato and Buddha bowl I had already fixed myself ;D",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,11,12,4,NoUHrFlg9wz4UZ4GJ97ZuA

Thai Pepper is tucked in a little strip mall near SLS and Westgate. I consider it a fairly easy walk from those places, but with the Vegas heat and those long Vegas city blocks you may not agree.

Anyway, the bottom line here is that the food is really god damn good. Their lunch special is an outrageously good value for what you get, and it isn't just sugary globs of fried meat like with most Asian lunch specials. Here they bring you an entree, soup, salad, rice, and an egg roll or potsticker for 5.95. At a casino that's gonna cost you 30 bucks and it wouldn't taste half as good as here.

The sauces they use have the perfect balance of salty, spicy, and sweet. There are lots of crisp fresh veggies mixed in. To me that's what good Thai food is all about.

This restaurant is located at the end of the Vegas strip near Stratosphere. Not many places are open very late at this side so a 24x7 thai place is really great.

AMBIENCE: The ambience is casual. They have a bar area and a live performance at nights. When we went here at 11 pm at night, a guy was singing some thai songs Karaoke style. Though we didn't understand what they meant, it was a pleasant background sound. The place is inside a strip mall and is just a little rundown but perfect for late night meals

FOOD: The food was delicious. Right from the fried wontons to the shrimp fried rice to the green curry... the food was cheap, came in generous quantities and was yummy. No complaints here

SERVICE: The only thing to complaint about was the service. It wasn't what you'll call slow because the appetizers were brought out quickly but the main course was spread out way too much. For just the two of us, the shrimp fried rice was brought out in good time but the green curry wasn't brought out before another good 15 mins. That was the case with our neighboring table too. That's weird when you have to sit and watch somebody else eat while you are starving.

1694197,2015-01-03,0,E7VRsyNQWPteH6_qI4j7bw,"Was in Vegas from Pasadena CA for a friend's wedding Sept 2014, after the wedding, clubbing and a couple of drinks at 1:00 am I was hungry again. No buffet open at 1:00 am, no restaurants open nearby and tired as you can imagine. I told my fiance (wife now) I guess the only choice within walking distance is that McDonalds over there and with such disappointment she agree, as we got closer to McDonalds we noticed a sign that says Thai Food and with an open sign on the window so we quickly change our mind not knowing what to expect but we thought anything will be better than McDonalds that's for sure.

So we order and first thing we noticed was the portions are big but then to our surprise the food tasted even better. Three months earlier in June 2014 we started planning our wedding after 8 years as a couple, two kids and with my fiance catching the toss of the bouquet at our friend's wedding we needed to set a date quickly. We knew we were getting married anyways but no date was set yet then.

As we ate our meal wife and I (fiance then) started talking about making Thai Pepper Restaurant our choice for our dinner reception which was planned for Dec. 2014, when we first visited they were remodeling the room adjacent to the main entrance but that didn't discourage us knowing that the meal we had was delicious. When we paid our check I approached Win at the cashier and asked information about having a dinner reception here and he was very attentive and showed me around and the room they were remodeling to hold events of this type and with that information we left convinced that this restaurant will end up been where we will have our dinner reception. Once a date for our wedding was set i contacted Win again to let him know of the date and approx. number of guests coming to our wedding, he was very attentive and dedicated to customer service we exchange numerous e-mails in the 3 month period to our wedding and with each one i sent he replied to every single one of my e-mails, very patient and courteous.

Fast forward 3 months later, our wedding, Fiance and I + 35 guests arrived into town, Win and his staff will go above and beyond to satisfy your needs and demands. They made the room very cozy, decorated it with roses and our clothed napkins shaped in different designs for each of our guests, they kept the newly remodeled event room neat for our dinner reception and the endless parade of non-stop food coming. I was so happy seeing all my guests happy faces and congratulating me for the choice of food and family felt cozy restaurant.

By the way we are a Hispanic couple with Hispanic guests, that's how good our meal was that we didn't even look back in search for a Hispanic food restaurant, we knew after our first meal that our guests will enjoy just as much as we did and that was exactly what happen. 

They also treat us with live music and Karaoke throughout our dinner reception at no extra charge which at the end of the day we ended up taking over the mic and the karaoke set and started singing for our entertainment, glad they were so cool about it they step down from stage and just let us ran wild with our wild singing the rest of the night. 

If you made it reading this far, you will learn from my experience that this restaurant and its staff are: 

- very dedicated to you as a customer and your satisfaction

 - No hidden fees, no charge for the event room. something most places charge on the strip. 

- You only pay for what ends up making it to your stomach, your food. Period!

- If you love Thai Food, give it a try it will not disappoint you. I promise

- And most importantly you will end up saving around 70% of what you would normally spend anywhere on Strip. My bill was ($645.09) for 35 of our guests.

***If you need a photographer, ask Win. I didn't have a photographer for our dinner reception and he saved our day. For a couple of $ he shot over 200 pictures with his camera and gave it all to us on a memory stick. I will post some of those pictures for you to see and to let the pictures do the rest of the talking for me and to back up my words on this review. Thanks again Win and all of your staff for making our dinner reception to our satisfaction, I'll come visit you soon again and to have another delicious dish of Thai food.

At a glance, it is a back ally location, in a crappy part of town, and it hard to see from the road.

I don't eat anything spicy so I order all of my food at a spice level 0. Our food got here and I was the last to start eating my food. When I took a bite it was super spicy my boyfriend tried it because he knows how I'm a baby about spice and it was even spicy to him. I thought ""no big deal I'll call and get it fixed"". I called the guy told me that it was my fault that it was spicy because ""all curry has to be made spicy"". Now i understand that some places have curry that is spicy and they can't change that. Which is why I asked the lady who took my order if the curry i wanted to order was spicy. She said ""no it is the same as everything else. You can order it 0-10"". So when the guy told me that it had to be spicy i told him what the lady told me. He told me ALL curry is spicy no matter what. (Which is 100% not true, i eat curry all the time. It's not all spicy all the time). So eventually he decided to tell me to order something else, and they would bring me my new order and take the curry. That was weird, but whatever. So I tell him I wanted Pad Thai. The curry I got was $12.95 and the Pad Thai was $7.95. He told me he would give me extra chicken because of the price difference. I was really confused and asked if he was going to refund me the price difference. He told me no,  because they only refund if there is something wrong with the food. He refused to accept that being lied to about the food not being spicy was something wrong but he would not accept that. So he tried telling me that he would just give me more chicken. And even if he was planning on putting a pound of chicken in there that was not acceptable. So since he told me he was not going to be refunding my money i told him to tell me what on the menu was the same price as the curry i had ordered. He kept telling me the boodle dishes which i had to keep reminding him were only $7.95 not $12.95 The only thing on the menu that is $12.95 is curry. I asked to speak to the manager. How convenient manager isn't there. Ok, well let me talk to whoever is in charge. He tells me no one is in charge. That made no sense. So then i decide i want him to just give me my money back. He can have the curry i don't want it. At this point i have wasted an hour or more and I'm starving. He argued with me more telling me he was definitely not going to refund my money. So i asked when the manager was going to be in. He told me he didn't know and to call tomorrow. I asked if i call tomorrow and all for the manager will he just tell me the manager isn't in again... he actually said ""yes"" i asked again to clarify whati had just heard i said ""so if i call tomorrow and your manager is in and you know it is me calling you will tell me the manager is not in? "" he said ""yes, exactly"". So i told him to come get the food and my money needed to be back in my account tomorrow or i would be down there to speak with whoever was in charge. He eventually agreed to this, and then never came to get the food! I called another thia place ordered curry, clarified that it would not be spicy, got my food and enjoyed my level 0 spice curry.

Me and the hubby started w the papaya salad, medium spice. Very flavorful, and the sauce at the bottom of the salad one hell of a kick to it. 

Then we split a chicken soup, medium spice, and it was delicious. Mushrooms, tomatoes, tender chicken, and lots of flavor. Def recommend getting the larger size- fair price and the novelty of the flame on your table is worth it.

Then we got the basil chicken- and here is where we messed up- we asked for it spicy. They do not mess around w spicy.

They had all the hotel info, but then informed me that they were not allowed up to the room.  I'm worried.... Does this mean that he is downstairs right freeking now???!

He's sitting there and jumps up right away.... GOOD GUESS...since we have never met before.

Pad thai was okay, a little bland so I put a good amount of hot sauce to make up for taste. Tom yum soups about average, fish cake average, drunken noodle okay. Basically everything was just okay tasting and mind u we azn af and hungry af and broke af after losing that night so that's why it was good lol.

Once all of us had placed our orders, the food came out in odd segments. Two people were served while the other two sat and waited awkwardly. Those who had food didn't want to dig in and be rude, so they sat and waited with us for 5-10 minutes. We were given one large rice bowl for four people, which was quickly doused in curry sauce. 

We sampled the papaya salad, which was decent. A fair portion for $5-6 bucks, but nothing to do a jig of joy over.

I ordered the roast duck curry. There were a few pieces of duck swimming in the sauce, but it seemed that it was mostly skin/fatty bits and a few pieces of vegetable. At $7-8 it's not horridly expensive, but it's not a generous serving of protein OR vegetables; it's just a whole lot of sauce. 

Halfway through the meal, one girl found a large cork-screw shaped piece of metal in her food. It didn't cut her mouth, but was alarming nonetheless. 

Risk of ingesting metal with little other filler? Meh. I'd rather go down the street, there are far better finds in Vegas. Too bad.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,3,1,1,KttEopp9yB7jSDLnzloJiw

They said that the latest we would get our food (which is ridiculous but what can you do) was 12:05. Keep in mind that we tipped 20% in advance, without waiting to see what the service was going to be like (apparently a mistake). At 11:50, I'm kind of wondering where the food is because seriously, we've ordered from other Asian places that are way farther away and gotten really good food within 30 minutes. Needing over an hour is pretty ludicrous. We tried calling the number three times on each of our phones and it seemed to be shut off? Not very professional. Finally get through at 11:56 and someone very bluntly asked me what my address was and then the only detail I got was ""it's already out for delivery you will have it in minutes"". At 12:35 we get a call from the delivery driver asking for directions. My husband gave him simple directions to follow but he simply couldn't comprehend them so my husband ended up having to go out to the street to meet the delivery driver to get our food. It took from 10:54 to 12:38 to get the food and they couldn't even get it to our door. At least the food is amazingly still hot.

The basil shrimp had overcooked, flavorless, frozen shrimp, with more julianned something, at about a pound and a half of sliced bell peppers but with basil leaves added.

Each food comes with an overt amount of white rice and they charge you nearly $3 per dish to substitute brown rice.

In the end, I was either eating ginger cough syrup with chicken, or flavorless shrimp with mystery vegetable. And to add content and volume to the food they just put a pound and a half of green bell peppers in each dish.

My girlfriend got the pad thai which was recommended by grubhub but it ultimately tasted like boiled noodles with rubber beef as a garnish. If it weren't for the lemon included, it would be virtually tasteless.

I got the pineapple fried rice which is more flavorful in my opinion but is heavy on the curry powder. Aside from that, you really need to find a peice of raisin, pineapple, or  tomato, to add flavor to the rice with flickers of curry. Unlike the pad thai beef, the chicken does hold a smidge of flavor on it's own.

Although those were our main dishes, the best part of the meal were our appetizers the potstickers and the free egg rolls (if you order more than $25). These 2 were obviously the easiest to make (deep fry) and were the best tasting. So thank goodness we didn't only order the entrees.

Although the entrees were a bit bland, the appetizers and the fact that they delivered at midnight makes it somewhat satisfactory but it most definitely wasn't worth the price. This place just wasn't my Thai-pe (type).",SlnLBqEdBxTxj7ZPKdiONw,2,0,2,mVEzbT7Pyo1AMpMPaBUz_A

As for the menu options I tend to go for the Mongolian beef, a classic, that comes with your option of spice level and quite a bit of onions.

The karaoke singers (or maybe they were the house band because they went on and on and on and were like playing the instruments) were so awful and annoying and I just don't know why we didn't walk out of there! The BEST part of the evening was right at the end when the waitress came to our table and dropped off the check then when we pulled out the card to pay she made it a point to say we should give her the tip in cash then stood there until we handed her some cash! She didn't even take the card and bill with her, we had to walk it up to the register. Honestly, the service and food was so awful that she didn't deserve any kind of tip but the fact that she assumed she would get some cash then stand there until she got some was so shocking that my wife just handed her 10 bucks and we got the eff outta there!

Well that was what I got in my  red curry this past Monday July 9th ...

 I have been to this place several times before and even though I was aware of its not so fancy location, I have enjoyed what I considered decent food for not too much money.  That was until recently, when I noticed a roach stuck on the inside of the clear plastic take out container for my red curry.  I found the nasty surprise after I had enjoyed the last spoonful of tofu and veggies with some of the broth and after I had put my spoon back in the container.  I was about to pick up the container to dispose of it and there it was, stuck to the side of the container after I had enjoyed the last bite and only some of the curry broth was left in the container. 

This was no doubt, the worst experienced I have ever had while eating out!  Who knows how many times this had happened previously, considering that the employee or owner of this place was very apologetic, first over the phone, then in person, and did not even question the fact that I wanted my money back. She even dared to ask if I wanted something else...  Give me a break!!!!  When I got to the restaurant  to get my money back and showed them the proof of my horrible experience, all the lady could  say was that she was sorry and that she would tell the cook to be more careful.  Really????

Needless to say, I am never going back to this place, and who knows when,  if ever, would I get take out or Thai food again... At least not for a good while , but if I do, I would be very paranoid and extremely cautious.  

Let's face it, these things happen, insects get into these places, but the fact that these things end up in your food makes you wonder how careless they are when it comes to hygiene before and right up  until the food is prepared, that is just simply ridiculous and inexcusable!!!",fbTsqu2vjEmv08GqBBqvkg,8,0,1,4NXp1curmaUM4zI7VB_qBQ

I ordered the red curry at a medium spice level. I typically eat very spicy food, but being my first time there I figured it would be safer to start medium to gauge it. It was the perfect amount. It had a good kick without taking away from the flavor, and I was having to ration out my water intake towards the end. So even if you do like spicy food be warned that medium is quite hot.

2nd time I go in with only 2 people in the restaurant  I order to go, after waiting almost 40 mins I ask where my food is, that no one is here, it shouldn't take this long, the guy tells me its right here while pointing to the kitchen, 5 mins later still nothing  so i ask again the lady tells me ""the health inspector is here they can't make food,"" really? what type of bs is that, I tell her why didn't you tell me when I was sitting there for 50 mins she says ""he came after  you"" so I tell her then my food should have been cooked, after almost an hr waiting for my food!

I later find a HAIR in my rice!!!

Ordered through yelp and specifically asked for some plates. You know to eat off of since we are at a hotel. We ordered a out 6/7 different dishes and they didn't even send one extra plate. Asked for extra sweet and sour sauce and was willing to pay the extra didn't get that either.  They did give lots of sou and their nasty hot sauce but we didn't use the soy and the hot sauce was nasty. Order delivery at your own risk.

If you are lazy like me, have them deliver! They make deliveries all night! So much to the point where our service was a little slow because everyone is going in and out making deliveries and not really one person waiting a table. :/ But... I didn't mind too much because..

Everyone was so sweet and we were approached by a few different people asking if we were ok. (Even though they forgot our drinks at first. Oops!) I felt like I was at a family party but didn't know anyone, but everyone tries to make you feel comfortable! Lol. I was feeling the vibe and diggin the people out there being themselves while  singing Karaoke all night and enjoying some drinks too. :)

The food was delicious, good bang for your buck, and home-like. Shareable portions! Like when you go to a friend's family party and there is at least one aunt that throws down in the kitchen and your flimsy plate is about to fall apart because there is so much food on it. Lol.

3654330,2013-05-31,0,E7VRsyNQWPteH6_qI4j7bw,"Recently went here for lunch with a few co-workers and I was not overly impressed.  The place only had one person working, so thankfully it was not busy or we could have be waiting a long time.  We were there while the lunch specials were still offered and we all ordered variations.  Initially we were given menus and allowed a few minutes to decide and then when it came time to order, the waiter started taking orders and then simply forgot to take the last person in our groups order.  We were a group of six and after taking the fifth order, he simply walked away and started doing other things.  After everyone got to order, the food started arriving within a decent time frame considering there was only one waiter.

I started with the pot stickers and they were pretty tasty.  Unlike the other pan fried pot stickers I have had, these were deep fried and it gave them a nice texture.  The soy based sauce that they were served with was also tasty, flavored with slices of pickled jalapeno.  I ordered the spicy basil chicken lunch special, which took longer to come out of the chicken than the other five dishes, a lot longer.  When I did receive my meal, I did think the flavor was pretty good, spicy but good.  Like most Thai places you order the spice level you desire on a scale of 1 -10 and I ordered a 5.  I would say their whole scale is a bit spicier than most, as the 5 was pretty dang spicy.  The lunch special came with a cup of very tasty vegetable soup in a clear broth.  Then the main dish was the spicy basil chicken, steamed rice and one small spring roll.  One pet peeve of mine is restaurants that serve canned soda, this is only made worse by charging $2 for said can of soda and that is how they do it here.  All in all I rounded up and gave this place 3 stars when the service etc made me want to assign 2 stars.  Overall the flavors were still quite good and that is ultimately what matters in my book.  I would return buy only for the lunch special, if it was any more expensive it would not be worth it.",qJXoA6sxmiJ357nLeAIlGQ,0,0,3,t_CeX64fbpaeGQaP2tXWig

The neighborhood is a little sketchy and the last time we were in there, there were a couple of troublesome kids hanging around (I realize I sound like an old lady saying that...but it's true!) and the staff didn't really know how to deal with them.

Ordered shrimp pad see ewe, panang curry (chicken) and basil chicken. We normally do medium spicy but because of all the other comments went with mild. The basil chicken is served ground, like beef, and was the spiciest. We could have probably ordered medium on everything else except that one. It's full of flavor and goes well alone or with rice (you don't have to order extra, they give you plenty). Pad see ewe was on par with everywhere else I've eaten it and not overly oily. The shrimp was *slightly* dry and didn't soak up all of the flavors, my only complaint. The panang was delicious, fragrant, sweet and subtly spicy. Will try medium next time and order with broccoli since it just came with chicken and peppers. Chicken was soft and tender.

My staple dish at any Thai restaurant is pad thai which gives me a good reference dish. It was actually pretty good. It wasn't too dry or too greasy and had great flavor without being too spicy. And also the best part is the lunch special starts at 5.95 and includes an egg roll, soup and salad. It has awesome bang for your buck. I was completely full for 6 dollars. The yellow curry apparently is really yummy too. The server was attentive and got us in and out of the restaurant in less than an hour with 8 of us in our party. 

So if you're on the strip and  can make it to Sahara and Paradise, you can get an awesome meal for an even better price.",jP4YUD-fWcf6j4bqZ13ikQ,0,0,4,ZgTsFFaQhYf1LSFoGgq2lA

The drawback for me is that the flavors are not balanced and sometimes the crispness of items like the tempura shrimp are soggy, and still served hot?  It's confusing for sure. I've also noticed that the spice level isn't consistent. Mild is really spicy, medium is really really spicy.. and I'm afraid to try ""hot"". This is from a guy that loves pretty spicy food.

My least favorite item that I thought I would love was the ginger chicken. Really spicy.. but otherwise bland and not a whole lot of chicken. Lots of veggies, which is nice.. but not allot of meat. 

I've been a fan of their wonton soup however, and the crispy veggie eggrolls are good. Overall, I would prefer the fusion style Thai of places like LeThai on east Fremont.

For $70 We got: 

Combo appetizer- was ok, crab Rangoon was a little off tasting, tofu was a little soggy but that's expected with delivery, egg rolls were ok, chicken potstickers were ok, the other thing (don't remember what it's called) that was included was decently good. Ordered this because there's absolutely no pork in it which is great.

Tom kha shrimp soup- really good but the shrimp was dry because it over cooked in the piping hot soup

Panang chicken curry- really good but asked for no spice so baby could eat it but still spicy 

Shrimp chow mein- weird noodles used but ok flavor, not like Chinese chow mein but that's to be expected because it's Thai

Garlic pepper chicken and rice- pretty good with much rooms in it

Mango sticky rice- good but no condensed milk on it so the rice was really dry

Bottled water

For Thai Pepper's delivery I had to go to the lobby to meet the delivery guy, but that was better than eating in the restaurant options downstairs, esp. after a day of LVCC exhibition and work stuff.

My tom yum soup $8 and cat fish red curry with rice $13 was pretty spicy - despite ordering Medium - so if you like it cooler order accordingly. The flavor was very tasty and not too salty unlike so many other food joints. There was plenty of sauce to soak into the white rice. If my room had a fridge and microwave I'd have it again tomorrow as this order was enough for two people!

The delivery guy was friendly. My only complaint was that no one mentioned the $5 delivery charge on the phone (it is on the menu that comes with your order.) Oh, and the plastic cutlery was really crap and bends when eating the hot food.

The one GREAT thing about this place though is that it is 24/7 (don't quote me on the 7 days part), so if you are hungry late at night for some Thai...well, hi there. You just found a place. You're welcome.",n9zwrWp8EeB9ODTitKZYsw,0,0,4,LXNdENIjE06Pp6ZqAOjP5w

Was looking for some late-night Thai food and I had two options but this one seemed to kind of fit my mood... In a strip mall with a couple of fast food options... Ordered through the yelp app and the pricing was in line with other Thai food places... possibly just a little cheaper...

The app said it was going to be about 45 to 50 minutes for a pick up/takeout... I went ahead and called the restaurant to confirm that and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes so heads up yelpers!... If you do see a weird or lengthy time for takeout... I've been told by Restaurants to give a phone call to confirm...

I got there a couple of minutes early and was just waiting on the other half of my order... I ordered pad see ew w/ chicken and the chicken wings ...

The Pad was good but I would've preferred more noodles... I actually really like the noodles... The chicken was very tasty and tender... The chicken wings had a light almost tempura style batter which was really good... Came with a nice dipping sauce but I kind of just like the wings on their own... Very hearty and tasty...

While I was waiting in the small but comfortable restaurant area... Seemingly plenty of tables there is a back area where they had a DJ and it looks like they might do karaoke... It looked pretty fun back there...

I was greeted by one of the managers as well as the cashier and the order was ready and hot and the place smelled good... All in all I would say above average tie food...

Walking in, the place was decently packed and was staffed by only waiter. The waiter immediately seated us but then cautioned, ""We're really busy right now so it might be a little while"". Uh oh. I have a Con to get to, man! Right about now is when we realized that is was uncomfortably warm in the restaurant. I look at the thermostat - 82 degrees. Not the business. 

10 minutes go by. The waiter drops off waters and takes off in a hurry. Btw, the water tasted really bad. Another 10 minutes go by. I start getting antsy and my husband is glaring at me because he's hangry. We realize it's going to take FOREVER (in the Sandlot voice) to get our food and get outta there. We decided to leave and go elsewhere because time is precious. I felt bad for leaving while the waiter sadly watched us walk out, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

Worth a return visit?
Probably not. Don't come here for lunch if you're on a tight schedule!

5318575,2016-12-22,0,E7VRsyNQWPteH6_qI4j7bw,"I am Thai and frequently eat at Thai restaurants, so I feel like I have a good grasp on what is okay Thai food, and what is delicious Thai food. Thai Pepper falls under delicious!

I came in while in Vegas craving something hot after being disappointed the previous day when eating at Pho Kim Long. There wasn't anyone else because they had just opened for the day but the place was clean and nicely decorated in a homey kind of way. There was a corner that had a setup for live music. The place is a lot bigger than it seems on the outside.

I judge Thai restaurants by how well they make my favorite dish, pad see ew. It's a flavorful stir fried noodle dish. I got the pad see ew beef, and my brother got the lard na (basically pad see ew with a gravy type sauce). My mom got the beef combo boat noodle and my dad got the pineapple fried rice 


The bathroom could be worked on though. There was no toilet paper and the soap dispenser was broken in the men's bathroom but it was relatively clean. The women's bathroom had no toilet seat covers and was a little dirty. This is coming from someone who likes hole in the wall type restaurants.

My mom's boat noodles came in first. It's basically pho but way more flavorful. The broth was nice and dark, and the scent was so strong that my tummy rumbled in anticipation to try it. It tasted as good as it smelled, and the beef was soft and chewy. I  started to regret ordering my pad see ew when looking at her soup. 5/5.

My brother's lard na came in after. It looked beautiful, with lots of seafood including shrimp, squid, and mussels. I began feeling envious of his dish as well (I'm greedy! Haha) and asked for a taste. The noodles were so soft but chewy and had such a flavorful impact on my senses. The gravy was thick, the shrimp was huge and not that cheap, terrible pre-peeled tiny shrimp so many other restaurants tend to use. The flavor existed without adding chili too, which I love. 5/5

My pad see ew came in after, and after seeing those two dishes, I was really excited. Honestly though, nothing was wrong with the dish, but I've had pad see ew at many, many different Thai locations and this did not stand out. It did smell heavenly though, with that somewhat charred smell from the pan that shows that the chef was a professional at making pad see ew. Without that scent, you know the noodles will taste soft, mushy, or rubbery. The texture of these noodles were great. There was a fair amount of beef as well, but the size of the dish was a little small. It wasn't a knockout in terms of flavor like the other previous dishes. 4/5.

My dad's pineapple rice came in last, and it was probably the most disappointing out of the 4 dishes. It was average. The rice had the scent of chicken, lemongrass, and turmeric so it smelled very light and refreshing. The rice was a bit mushy. However, this fried rice dish was miles above the fried rice failure that I was served the day before at Pho Kim Long (beautiful but tasted like white rice with my eyes closed). With this dish, my dad believed that he has had better fried rice. 3/5. 

Overall, I would recommend this place. The prices are very reasonable, and $10-15 will get you a delicious, hot meal. This is definitely a great place to eat on a budget and even a great place to eat even if you're not on a budget!",SVIOUIuXAnvStuG_sQuqhA,2,1,5,B1CbiBF6YMtwsTxe1lbdrQ

We ordered the appetizer sampler, a bbq pork soup, pad see eiw and shrimp fried rice. First of all all the pictures look completely different from what is actually served.
Every single item on the app was fried even the pot stickers! The BBQ pork soup was like water with some cabbage and CHICKEN not BBQ pork inside. Weird huh! 
Pad sei eiw was ok, pretty salty though! Shrimp fried rice was ok but the shrimp wasn't cooked enough. kinda light light pink almost transparent and we didnt eat it.
We asked for the bill and the waitress offered us a 5% discount if we used cash.
I gave her the certificate and she went to process it. She came back and said we could only use the certificate if we were going to use cash. Whats with this lady and cash?! I told her to please show me where it says you have to pay cash to use the restaurant.com certificate. She accepted my card.

My husband ordered the chicken pad Thai. The meal was kind of bland and nothing to write home about. My meal was the green Thai curry that came with a container of white rice.

I got to order 2 dishes for about 10! I ordered the Beef Salad and the Thai Sausage. It took 30 minutes to receive my Salad, which kind of lessened my mood here. However, I think Thai Pepper redeemed itself, and here's why. 

About the Beef Salad, it was bold and exciting. Though, I recommend that you get the dressing on the side. The vegetables, along with the tangy and spicy sauce, gave the salad a unique flavor. Everything tasted really fresh! 

About the Thai Sausage, its one-of-mind. It's a mixture of different meets like pork and pork skin. It has the right level of saltiness, and doesn't taste too fattening either - not drenched in oil. It has a nice side of peanuts too. 

I'm going to give this place a 5 star overall because I think it's a 5-star for the price. Also, come for the lunch special between 11-3 PM.",0XOWPRwmSMdmdxnZHZwcBw,1,0,5,hPsyVBjY9iTTpqVtEQpitw

Turns out when I called to place my delivery order around 12:30pm that day, they never even charged my card until 2:21pm (I have the receipt to prove it), so no wonder it took so longer.  THEY NEVER EVEN PROCESSED MY ORDER! When I called multiple times to ask where the food was, they kept telling me ""it's on it's way"".  So, how can my food be on it's way at 1:30pm, 1:45pm, 2:00pm and 2:15pm with a receipt that's be ran at 2:21pm... So, here it goes again:

First, let me just say they their food is very tasty.  Their service however is really awful.  They lie about timing, and quite frankly it happens all of the time.  I've ordered from here multiple times and have always had to wait over an hour for food.  I understand it's a small business, but having to wait almost two hours for a delivery order is unacceptable.

The Thai Sausage and Thai Dumplings are nice.

The mango sticky rice was also very nice.

The pot stickers were deep fried, even though I checked the ""steamed"" check box on my online order. One of the best things about potstickers is the slightly gummy pastry when boiled or steamed. Even if you pan fry them after you steam them, they still have that great gummy taste on the top. When you deep fry them they turn to leather, the potsticker equivalent of beef jerky. Sure they cook faster when you deep fry them, but I like deep fried pot stickers about as much as I would like deep fried Spaghetti Bolognese.

The duck fried rice had two pieces of duck. I could have been happy with the rather modest protein portion if they had taken the time to dice the duck into a few more pieces, but it was clear they had allocated less than two seconds of time to cutting up the pre-roasted duck for this dish. If they had just allocated 40 seconds and cut the roasted duck into 10 to 15 chopstick friendly little pieces, I would have been a happy camper.

The wontons in the wonton soup were too floury for my taste, the pastry was were either too thick or they were cooked/soaked too long. Takeout wonton soup is always better if they ship it without the soup and you assemble it when you get it. They did not do that here.",kpL9GJYRkE_DYV6dsM-Y_g,0,0,3,GmrSUyHk5mvEWzl0NT8N7A

The prices are very affordable and they play music which was a plus for the night.

Gyozas were great not just because they were free but the sauce was off the hook.
However the orange chicken looked as if they took precooked frozen chicken nuggets and threw some sort of  citrus runny sauce in it. Yuck.",nwPRF-NNYxB-hx56LoBWBA,2,0,3,B8D29x7c6Wf5b33K65a03A

Two bags of Thai goodness were delivered to the SLS lobby by 5am although the app estimated delivery at 5:33am. And the delivery guy was all smiles, very friendly. 

Everything was piping hot, fresh, and delectable. I held back a star for authenticity as the cuisine is clearly prepped for the American palate, a contrast from the down home Thai fare I can get at 4am in Hollywood's Thai Town, back at home in Los Angeles. 

Still, my expectations were exceeded since I wasn't expecting to float on the Mekong or anything. This hit the spot while breaking up the routine, continental breakfast monotony.",VeJxI6D5SMRuX8_0RYT1TQ,2,2,4,KymO9UkJk5uoqG3bTWLJlg

We had the combination platter, which was awesome but we did not need with the portion sizes they gave on the entrees-to start then the pineapple fried rice and the thai spice noodle with beef. Both were sooo good! Prices were reasonable as well.",5HmaNREIlTjGPf2pCAKUwA,0,0,4,oZ_cCq0GsRyFWLQMnbZ-dw
