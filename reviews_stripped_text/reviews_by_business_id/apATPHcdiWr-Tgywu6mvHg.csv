The first time I ordered chicken nachos that were pretty soggy,  but edible.  However, this time I ordered a chicken tostada, chicken quesadilla and menudo. Both chicken meals were completely inedible!  There was chicken broth that completely covered the bottom of both containers and they forgot the tortillas for the menudo.  When we went back the man that prepared the food came to say that was completely normal. I have never ate a soggy tostada or quesadilla from any other place in my life,  so please don't give me that bull!  This same man started speaking to the cashier in Spanish hoping that we didn't understand him, but my husband did and he was rude and dismissive.

I can't live with $2.75 For a teeny cup of Pico de Gallo. You charged me that much and rice and bean side dishes are the same price! Also a $3.00 increase on many combo items is ridiculous.

3128531,2016-04-13,0,apATPHcdiWr-Tgywu6mvHg,"Food was great, no complaints there. However the management needs to inform the staff(and be informed) of Federal and State ADA law pertaining to service animals. I brought my dog in(fully trained service animal) and set him down by our table an went to the counter to order. First, the cashier asked if he was my dog and i said yes, and then she asked if i had a ""card"". First of all, it is ILLEGAL to request any documentation for service dogs. Second, private parties can purchase service dog certifications and cards online. It is also illegal to have a dog out in public identified as a service dog that is not fully trained.

There are only two question staff are allowed to ask patrons with service animals. 1) Is the dog a service animal required cause of a disability? 2) What work or task has the dog been trained to perform? 

You cannot require documentation, you cannot require that the dog perform its task, and you cannot inquire about the nature of the persons disability.

4147658,2015-10-09,4,apATPHcdiWr-Tgywu6mvHg,"I like Roberto's Taco Shops a lot. I look forward to Wednesday nights when I can get a couple of $0.99 chicken tacos. And an order of three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Those are a little more but oh so worth it. This has become a Wednesday night tradition for me. This past Wednesday was no different. What was different about this latest visit was the location. I came to the shop on Russel Road at Boulder Highway as I was in the area. I got my usual order as outlined above and eagerly awaited my mid week treat. The shop was busy this night as is often the case on cheap taco night so it took a few minutes to get my food. I was never disappointed with what I ate though there were some differences from what I am used to. The rolled tacos with guacamole were fine. Crispy and all. The guacamole seemed thin and bland compared to other Roberto's locations. The cheese was pleantiful but not at all melted. The tacos had more chicken than what I get at other shops. That was nice. They were actually pretty solid. What I did not care for as much is the amount of black pepper in the chicken. It was a little heavy handed for me. Regardless, I still enjoyed my meal. My reasoning for a 3-star rating is for the restaurant itself. It seemed dark. Dimly lit if you will. With the area it is in and some of the scary looking people around, I felt a little uncomfortable. Also, when I was ordering, I saw young girl of about 4 or 5 running around the back of the kitchen barefoot. I'm pretty sure she was the child of one of the workers. Perhaps the manager even. But I also fairly certain it is not OK. A child should not be roaming a restaurant at all. Let alone doing it barefoot. Surel there was an office she could have sat in if they had no place else for her. I don't know. That just bothered me.
