Called Domino's - not the greatest pizza but at least it shows up in a half hour.   After several calls and excuses pizza finally shows up 3 hours late. And way after domino's.  

They did comp the food - but it was middle of the road.",5-IOLqG_0L4dZ47sTT-gEw,0,0,1,4yp_lPEig_xlsCSKFbHKnQ

I should have just tossed it into the trash, but I couldn't drive anywhere and ordered a Stromboli and a Greek Salad. Now, they say Stromboli on the menu, but this is clearly a calzone I think. Ok, it is in the shape of a calzone, but was missing the Ricotta cheese that is always found in Calzones. I guess its a cross-over thing, but anyway the crust tasted like a Croissant pastry. If they use that for the pizza, then it will be trouble. THe mozzarella cheese was decent inside, but veggies were overcooked and that pastry crust shell was tough to get past. Salad was just regular with feta tossed on top. Move to the next menu if you see this place and $2 delivery charge.",ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,0,0,2,HLsE3RdT1-GVJ1B-BbESSg

Also, refuse to do business with these jerks, they won't stop sneaking in our gated community and soliciting in a non-solicitation zone. Called and politely asked them to stop soliciting our neighborhood and they refuse to stop. This business will suffer due to bad customer service and a lack of respect for its surrounding community. Lots of better competition to choose from too.",opbIGwiOlaVdQSfIuXto-Q,1,0,1,9DSdMs5qv78n5gHWlSMIwg

I first ordered during the Super Bowl last year and it was amazing and the staff was very friendly but the next few times I went the pizza would be mediocre or amazing. It's hit or miss but it's still better than some other places I've been to.",3jCgfOvgfzYa2iXEywceAA,1,1,3,tqUUVTC5JbfIS9NPNk5irg

I believe that was $15 or $25. The food was average quality. Not the best, but not the worst. It was a little overpriced, but this is expected for Las Vegas.",Io0b0zFMWcW5lpUtTxQ8BA,0,0,3,ckDAj5HBrSHmdsr9Ny1kkw
