As a recent transplant, I have made finding a good spot in Las Vegas one of my missions. I visited this place last week when I was missing LA and feeling a little blue. 

I had read a few reviews and decided to brave it out, but with a chip on my shoulder since I think I know good Ethiopian food when I taste it. I walked in and went to the bar to order my food to go. 

The bartender immediately knew I was from California and welcomed me to ""Hell"" ( her pet name for Las Vegas). She took my order and gave me a complimentary tea which was deliciously spiced and a little sweet. 

The food took a while but when I got my order home, I was not disappointed. I ordered the vegetarian combination with fish. The total was around $10.00 and the portions were right on! I got three pieces of fried fish (which I thought I would not like but loved), a generous amount of injera ( they offered me white or wheat bread, but I said hell no to that!), and a plate loaded with the typical Ethiopian veggies and lentils. 

Long story short, I will come back. The food was well priced, well spiced, and the bartender was friendly. I don't miss LA so much now!",wzxU0tbrO9KoWetsFkZeGw,4,2,4,kcC6BEBOKb_szi3F0AqJMg

Kitfo special is an amazing dish that is serve raw, medium or cook. Its mince up meat flavored with ethiopian butter(niter kibe) red pepper powder(mimita) I love the raw one whenever I go to meskerem. Make sure you call in advace if your planning on taking out, cause they take foreverrrrrr to cook lolz. Trust me on this!  One day I had to wait 45 mins for my food to be brought out, I almost fell asleep waiting. Now I know better. Overall great food!

Meskerem satisfied perfectly. It's not fancy, in fact, it's rather dingy. It's in a strip mall just off Las Vegas Blvd. and it's next to the sorts of down-on-your-luck stores one might usually find in a strip mall. But that does not matter, because Meskerem makes delicious food that will restore you. I ordered a vegetarian sampler platter (although it was cryptically called something else on the menu). It arrived with plenty of delicious injera bread to mop up the varieties lentils and greens spread out on even more injera. I kept eating and eating, feeling more and more restored with each bite. Then I got a little worried about what all of those lentils and greens might do to my digestion. However, there was nothing to worry about. It was the most satisfying meal I had during my stay in Las Vegas.

Usually, I'll order the Veggie combo, which comes with a bunch of stuff that I can neither name nor figure out, but it's all wonderful. This is served on injera, the crazy fun spongy flat bread. You peel off chunks of bread and use it to scoop up the food. The staff will give you a look of disdain if you ask for a fork, so just eat it with your hands. (Apologies to my mother, who raised me to pick a chicken clean with a fork and knife.)

But this time when I ambled in at lunch there was a buffet set up. There was much of the same stuff from the veggie combo plus soup, a chicken dish, beef stew and a beef/cabbage thing. The buffet and a soda set me back only $10. Of course, it was amazing again. 

Looks like they have live music at night, which might be worth checking out. But remember that Vegas venues charge you an extra 10% Live Entertainment Tax if there's even a guy playing a kazoo loudly in the corner.

2210838,2011-07-25,1,M5Ft2YKkh9fFjyUNmAeRGA,"Day one of Vegas/APP, we're drunk and needed to find food. Luckily, John Johnson gave the veggies and vegans of APP a list of places we could go, and it was walking distance from the hotel. 

So we started our trek, and walked, and eventually we got there. Has a sort of hole in the wall vibe, and was a smal little place with very friendly people working and loving their job and the food they make.

We went with a party of I think like 5 or 6 people and we got this huge platter full of different meals, and they gave us lots of injera (a sort of fermented bread) to scoop food up and eat with your hands.

I'm giving Meskerem 5 stars because of a myriad of reasons;

1. The food was absolutely incredible. This was my first time having real Ethiopian food and it blew me away. Its up there with how much I love thai food and burritos and sandwiches, maybe even more.

2. The employees were very nice, always smiling and non discriminating (remember, this was during APP so all of us are heavily tattooed and pierced)  about staying open later for us to finish our food and we left our server a huge tip for being so patient.

3.The atmosphere. The employees factor into this too, but it felt more like having a group of friends in a big house where the employees here were our family and we were just having a nice meal.

4. The eating with your hands is new to me, but it adds a whole new level of intimacy. Sitting in a tight circle of close friends, scooping up food with the injera and eating with your hands was an awesome bonding experience.  

Not to mention the ambience, the personality, the Ethiopian music playing in the background, and just....I could on for days. It was really quite incredible. Will Definitely be coming back next year while I'm here for APP.

2308386,2013-01-13,1,M5Ft2YKkh9fFjyUNmAeRGA,"This was my first experience with Ethiopian food. We planned an early dinner - and when we arrived at 6:00 - we pulled into a deserted strip mall, save for 2 taxis and two other cars. Meskerem and a, ehem, ""spa"" - were the only businesses still open.  Upon entering the restaurant, there was one other group sat at a round table in the showroom area - the rest of the place was deserted save for the taxi drivers that popped in and out for coffee and to play a round of pool in the adjoining room. The decor is somewhat sterile and aged with all the charm of a 1980s cafeteria and the walls and ceiling could definitely use a new coat of paint. That said - the music that they play here is great - upbeat and authentic! Our waitress was very reserved, very quiet.

Four of us got two vegetarian combo platters to split. The injera bread was an odd experience at first, on the cold side and spongey - but great for scooping up the wonderful bits and bites of curried and spiced lentils, cauliflower, collard greens, potatoes and salad. The food is really great! I washed it down with an Ethiopian beer called Bedele - which is a Czechoslovakian-style pilsner made just outside Addis Ababa. Mild carbonation with a cloudy pour which tasted a bit fruity or honeyed which made me wonder if the flavorings were intentional (like a German Hefe) or a bit off. I hoped for the former.  It matched well with the food at any rate.

All in all the experience was fine - but I'm interested in trying out some of the other Ethiopian establishments in town as well.",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,1,2,3,-QVIZqZ8TElaTsEuCT9Neg
2359011,2011-03-04,14,M5Ft2YKkh9fFjyUNmAeRGA,"Welcome to the first, and hopefully last, ""Charlie Sheen"" review. 

After a long work week where I interacted briefly with thousands of people in English, participated in long client meetings in Spanish and German, and was forced to eat each night  in crowded Las Vegas restaurants - I really needed a quiet, simple home cooked meal to rejuvenate me and enhance my tiger blood and Adonis DNA.

I was far from home, but Meskerem really came through for me. This small Ethiopian restaurant was across from my hotel room in a nearly deserted strip mall with 100 parking spots, but only featuring two or three cars. It's so deserted, it looks more like a place to skateboard, play roller hockey, or facilitate a drug deal. And well, for all I know, this place could be a drug front. Or in other words, a place where Charlie Sheen might hang out when he's not too busy dating porn stars, ranting about practice, and ""winning.""

When I approached the joint, two Ethiopian guys smoking cigarettes stared at me. And when I entered, I was greeted by a woman with a big smile that was acting as a hostess, server, and bartender. I was the only person inside the humble restaurant that features some old tables, chairs, a full bar, and a flat screen TV (that was showcasing a basketball game). Part of me felt I was in an episode of the Ethiopian version of the Sopranos. It was just two guys sipping coffee and beer at the bar and me. Or in other words, there was just ""two and half men."" Ba-dum-cha!

I went up the bar and asked for a menu. The server said to sit anywhere and she handed me a paper menu. I was highly entertained and eventually appalled by the number of writing errors in the menu, which included ""Red Strip"" and ""Micalobe"" and ""Merllo"" for beer and wine. Where's the spell check, guys? It looks as if I am dealing with fools and trolls.

Luckily, the joint cooks a whole lot better than it can spell. I ordered ""Ye Awaze Tibs"" and after a long 20 minutes, I was presented with a huge piece of injera (Ethiopian flat sourdough bread) and my dish of red stew (with beef, onions, and green peppers) on the side. The server then poured my steaming hot dish all over the bread, which included a small veggie side. She then brought over two extra pieces of bread and I dug my face into my meal like Charlie Sheen does cocaine.

It was a nice, filling meal. I just wish it had been spicy (as I had requested). In the end, I got the quiet and simple home cooked meal in an atmosphere where I could relax, watch a game, and sign up for a Twitter account on my Blackberry just so I can follow the man, the myth, the one and only Charlie Sheen.",0kSXMbNFo7mdwTPj4iQv9A,13,10,3,moHQHiiYJB9mDjBmIJdqOw

Being vegan and never having Ethiopian food before, I was glad to have my companions with me to make suggestions.  Apparently, this establishments specialty is the vegetarian dish so we knew we were in for a treat.

Starting off with lentil sambusas, I had wished I had ordered more.  My companions stated they were the best they had ever eaten.  The dough was flaky, tender,  the sauce was flavorful and the filling was simple and delicious.

The vegetarian platter we ordered was literally enough for two to three people.  It has an array of lentils, vegetables, salads, and is served with injera.  You eat with your hands here.  The display of this dish is beautiful and I immediately had to take a picture, it is a work of art.

My friends ordered the Ethiopian coffee service.  The gentleman told us that the lady who performed the service was off that day.  We were surprised to find that she did come in on her day off to perform the service for us.  Wow is all I can say.  Please do not leave without having the coffee service, it is an experience and is delicious.

At first glance, this place appears to be closed. The windows are dark and it's in a rundown shopping center that has certainly seen better days. However, the door does open when you pull it and the interior looks a little better than the desolate outside. 

Apparently, there's live entertainment at night because there's a small stage in the corner of the restaurant, and when I've driven by the place at night, it's bustling with business from cab drivers.

Although I couldn't imagine why they'd want to eat here.

I went with some folks from work in the afternoon a couple of weeks ago, and we all opted to do the lunch buffet, which costs roughly $10. I would have felt better if I had paid half that for the quality of food provided.

The buffet set up, at first glance, appeared to be empty of food. However, on closer inspection, there was tons of food shoved into two little buffet carts. About half of the items were labeled, and less than a quarter of the items actually tasted good. Unfortunately, most of the items that tasted good were un-labeled, so I couldn't even begin to share what was enjoyable. 

The waitress told us the only item on the menu not included in the buffet was the kitfo, so we ordered some, which was also $10. It was surprisingly bland compared to the kitfo I've had at other Ethiopian joints.

It was good going down and burned like a fucking banshee on the way out. We got two lamb dishes, a fish dish (rhyme, lol!), a chicken dish, lentils, all kinds of good veggies, and a couple o' beers.

They were out of sambusas - kind of like samosas if you know Indian food - and they were also out of chickpea dip.

The place is kind of a hole, in the same kind of crappy strip mall that Lotus of Siam is in, but the food is excellent.

We usually get the Sambusa - a deep fried pastry stuffed with a lentil and spice mixture. The pastry is super yummy. Like a Samosa but a little different and crispier. $2 for the lentil Sambusa.

The Vegetarian Injera is always our main. Injera is an Ethiopian bread that's rather porous and soft. On top of the bread is a plethora of toppings. These change daily. There are always multiple lentil dishes, vegetable dishes and salads. It's a super yummy and healthy meal. $9 for this.

It's good, but lacks a bit of variation in taste, so if you're looking for a variety of flavor, simply order two or three dishes to share.  The service was excellent, the restaurant was empty save us but we still got great, courteous service, and parking was a breeze (the lot looks abandoned but I promise it isn't).    The strip mall only has 3 open stores--a massage parlor, the restaurant, and the ethiopian store that is attached to the restaurant, but don't let that sway you!",S0CoIlPKRmijNgC9v649xw,1,1,4,ZL2Y1JHe83khvrj7s0gQDA

I cannot easily describe it is a soft airy bread that has a bit of a sour flavor but not sour in a bad way.  You hold the bread in one hand and tear pieces off and use the pieces to scoop up the goodness on the platter in front of you.  The goodness in from of you will have to be up to you.  Read the menu well and enjoy it with an open mind.

You may hear a lot of ruckus next door but no worries it is just a bunch of cabbies playing bad pool!  LOL

This place gets a bad wrap for it's bathrooms and floors and decor but I have traveled over seas many times and eaten soup from rivers that no one should eat from and had pieces of meat in my food that I could not identify but here in the US we are a bit of a food snobs so much food is wasted because it looks funny or feels funny or is different. 

The food here is great the service good for what they know and the cleanliness is fine for a dive food place.  I will be back to get my fix of bread in the not so distant future!",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,3,2,4,k3GDhN1SlLq8FxrXX7JD2Q

The food was very authentic and filling (although spicy if you are sensitive.

I had the meat stew dish, with an ethiopian beer (there is two, one pilsner and a apricot beer that I had). Way too much for myself, so I took the rest home.
The service was mediocre, but it was late in the day and the server had friends at the bar.

Overall I would be glad to return, maybe next time at night (it looked like they had some kind of bar/club/live music scene going at night).",pziygTgwFxGWi02ySYk8cg,0,0,5,BRjyIT2ebQ-zYumn7E_mUw

It's about a five minute walk from the corner of Convention Center Drive and S. Las Vegas Blvd., in a rundown strip mall near the Riveria casino.

Based on a suggestion I found on the web about the restaurant, I didn't bother looking at the menu and just ordered the Veggie Combo. It took a bit of time to get my entree after I put the order in - the waitress was by herself, so I was a little more forgiving - plus I was looking forward to having some Ethiopian food.

The combo came with a generous portion of injera to eat with - the food was typical ehtiopian, and I don't mean that in a bad way. It was good and really hit the spot. The stews were delicious!

4974709,2009-08-14,0,M5Ft2YKkh9fFjyUNmAeRGA,"Fourth Ethiopian restaurant in a month - I think I can safely say I've had a good share of what Vegas Ethiopian food tastes like.

Meskerem Ethiopian Restaurant is the most lighted of the four we have visited thus far.  They actually have natural light shining in, which makes the restaurant feel less like a club or disco.

On a Friday night, there was only one diner before our party of three showed up.  By the time we left, one couple (non-Ethiopian) and one other diner (Ethiopian) arrived.

Starting off with what we know best and love is:
* #3. Kitfo ""Chopped lean beef seasoned with butter and mitmita.  Served with injera and ayb (cottage cheese), prepared to desire: raw, labilb - medium or well done."" ($9) - We ordered this raw, of course.  (And I'm really learning that it's a surprise for the waitress when we say we want raw because I guess they aren't used to hearing us non-Ethiopians wanting it raw.)  It was a generous portion that she poured out on three sections of the injera bread.  It was my favorite out of everything else we ate.

* #5. Yebeg Alicha ""Mild lamb stew, delicately seasoned and cooked with spiced garlic, ginger and other house spices."" ($9) - We went for a meat stew this time, and chose this one because it was 'wetter' per the waitress.  It came with two chunks of lamb, more like goat, and a few other pieces.  It was a bit gamey-tasting and wasn't my particular favorite.  The Husband said he probably wouldn't order it again because it wasn't that special.

* #11. Yetsom Migb ""Vegetarian combination with fish and split lentil."" ($9)  On the menu, it's a misprint, so there's really no fish in this veggie combo.  What is included is the salad, red lentils, green lentils, yellow beans, steamed potatoes, cabbage and carrots, and collared greens.  I was a bit disappointed because usually we love the lentils and the spices they use in it.  This time it lacked a little something.  It was okay, but we actually had leftovers for once.  It didn't have the same explosion of flavors like the other Ethiopian restaurants we've been to.

Service was okay, as there was only one waitress when we first arrived.  She was very sweet, although a bit over-efficient with wiping down our table and taking our water glasses before we left the table.  We did try to inquire about any Ethiopian coffee since we saw the cups laid out near the TV, but the waitress pointed to the coffee maker they had behind the bar. We didn't see any kind of Ethiopian coffee ceremony listed on the menu either, so we figured they didn't offer it.

Overall, it's a decent restaurant for Ethiopian food for what we had.  But if we were craving kitfo and the veggie combo, we would probably go elsewhere.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,4,4,3,1M-yiKTP_TDp0nUc-vDPtA

I had never had Ethiopian food, but when my wife told me that Ethiopian restaurants offer raw meat, my interest was definitely piqued. 
The place is small and we were the only ones there.
The woman that served us was also an owner, and she was one of the nicest, most patient, and knowledgeable server that I've ever had.
She explained all the dishes to us, but I was only interested in trying the raw beef.
The bread was not my favorite thing, but I can honestly say that it was nothing like I've ever tasted before. Spongy, sour, and I learned that it is not cooked, just poured onto a flat surface and left to set.
The raw meat was reminiscent of steak tar-tar, except that it was a huge portion.
I would have preferred it a little less seasoned, but the server told me that the next time I go there, I should order a different raw dish that would better suit my taste. 
My wife ordered some vegetarian plate, so I didn't taste any of her dish, but for what it's worth, it looked good. 
They also owned a little shop next door, and our server walked us there and introduced us to one of her relatives who was behind the counter. This server was so nice.
There was a little room in the back with a billiards table, but the rules of the game were too complicated for me. It wasn't like regular pocket billiards.
The service was excellent, and I can't fault them for the food not being particularly suited for my taste.
The food was fresh, healthy, and I will be going back to try some of their other dishes.",TP84hS-tDZGv0vEDSowrxQ,3,0,5,xpp_yBc6rGvUetmFejOdFw

The food - 4.0 stars
Overall - very good!  But, all of is was fairly cold.  If hotter, it would have tasted better.

Red Lentils - 4.5 stars
Slightly underdone, but great spicy flavor.

Yellow Lentils - 4 stars
A great change of taste vs the red, with a very unique tangy flavor.

Cabbage - 4 stars
Fresh and tangy.

Green Beans - 4.0 stars
Delicious.  Never had that served at Ethiopian restaurant before.

Salad - 3 stars
Pretty plain, but it was refreshing.

Injera Bread - 4 stars
More whole wheat-like (or Teff) in both color and texture.  Quite good.  The thicker version used on the tray was quite sour, almost too much.

5609010,2011-09-02,0,M5Ft2YKkh9fFjyUNmAeRGA,"Disclaimer: So this is my first Ethiopian experience. Soooooo, I don't know if my score is unjust or not because I don't know if ethiopian food is just not for me or not. Generally, I like everything. So it sounds about right, but if I try another place and get a feel for Ethiopian food more, I'll re-review. 

I walked in super excited about trying Ethiopian food for the first time. I wasn't even familiar with what to expect. I glanced over the menu, and pretty much decided to ask the waitress to recommend me whatever she thought was best. 
My friend got the Veggie Combo and I got the Meat Combo (described as the GASTRONOMICAL ADVENTURE, how do you turn that down?! seriously?) 
I asked her if that was too much food for the two of us and she said it wasn't. Well, the food came out, and it was a TON of food. 
Both of our dishes came out on the same platter. The veggies along the edges of the platter and the meats in the middle all portioned on top of their bread. 
My friend describes their bread as elephant ears, which is the reason why I wanted to try Ethiopian food. Who doesn't want to try something that reminds them of elephant ears?! Okay, maybe the average joe but that's what peaked my interest. But the bread is pretty much unleavened bread thats super porous. It was actually really really good. 

The whole experience was very interesting. You eat with your hands and take the bread and use that to grab the veggies and meat mixtures. The only part I didn't like was that I thought all the portions of the food was very bland, but that just might just be how the food is supposed to taste? 

I also thought the food was WAY too much food. My friend and I barely made a dent with the portions of the veggies and meat. There would have been enough food for the two of us if we would have just ordered one. 
I just wished the waitress would have told us.",NnNdqH3DaleFtQk60UT-og,1,1,3,dDx7fJ_vZs7n5txM25ytFQ

I got it to go and ate in my Marriott hotel room around the corner, but I would go back and stay there as once inside the restaurant it is fine. The area is a tad seedy, but that adds to the adventure, right? 
Not thrilled about the tons of travelling I will now be doing for work, but I am comforting myself with the idea that I am going to have a lot of fun yelping my way around Vegas! Oh, and the beet sald ans sambusas were great.",efpYzD7cnywDo2SVHb5yvg,1,0,4,koPEz9WKumSahXguAu1SqQ

We were a group of 4 and ordered the veggie platter and the lamb platter.  Both were incredibly good, and there was definitely enough for all of us.  My favorite, had to be the lamb plate.
