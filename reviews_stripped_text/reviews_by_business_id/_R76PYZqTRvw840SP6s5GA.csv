I often visit some of my regular clients in the are and I noticed this newly opened coffee shop. I decided to give it a try because it was lunch time and of course I was hungry again.

The first impression was that the place is very clean and cozy. Next think was the friendly smiling girl behind  the counter. I ordered a Cuban panini (of cource - I grew up in Cuba and have a special affinity to everything Cuban). The lunch was very tasty. I also had my usual double espresso, which was very strong and with wonderful aroma. I recommend to visit Globe Cafe if you are in the area.",G0BxLN3TDXA9n2TlMwvxfw,2,0,5,qfdUFmdkgRi8dUzOBofqHQ

They need to figure out the decor. It was a cross between a living room & a diner. There were too many televisions. I expect a cafe to be a place to relax or get work done. I don't want to be inundated by CNN. 

The latte I had was fine but not special. I also had a Danish and was disappointed that it was not fresh. They serve the pre-packaged kind. It was not very good.",zvIM7M-nFcsockXoc823RQ,0,0,2,t-Oy71Yn5aH38-9TBLzOBg

And the foam, guys! The foam! My hazelnut latte was prepared by a craftsman, clearly. The foam was delightfully thick, perfectly aiding in coating the mouth to prevent burn while sipping on the hot latte. Seriously a rare sighting. Sizes are small, medium 16oz, and large. And even though it was in a to-go cup they added a foam design . The staff was friendly but not too chatty. 

The temperature in the place was nice, not too cold (a common, yet unwelcoming theme in Starbucks for some reason). It's well lit with lots of natural sunlight through their many windows. The patio is cute, has two tables with umbrellas for shade, and seats four. The indoor tables are high tops set for two (I loved the comfy, leather padded with back support chairs).

1404157,2015-12-23,13,_R76PYZqTRvw840SP6s5GA,"I'm giving this spot 3.5 stars, but rounding up this time due to the ambiance. Globe Café is a solid coffee/drink spot with sandwiches and salads that shares a model that is similar to a Panera. It has just recently opened, and it looks like it has the potential to become successful. 

I've been watching this spot for a while. It has been a bakery by it's previous owners, and now looks more like a casual café spot. It is located off of Eastern Ave, and Wigwam. There is plenty of parking availiable outside.

I really liked what they did with the interior. It gives off a clean, warm vibe, and it was designed really well. I especially liked the fireplace near the back. There is also sections where you can pick up soft drinks and chips if you like. I ordered my food and sat down to wait.

Coffee: Just ordered a basic coffee. It was well brewed, no complaints.

Cuban Panini - I'll start with the good news. The bread that they used is really good, a real quality bread. The ham and cheese were tasty and of good quality as well, and I liked the addition of pepperoncini, and the pickles were good as well. The bad news: This is not really a 'Cuban' sandwich. It was more of a Ham and Swiss sandwich. There was no roasted pork in the sandwich, which there should be in a Cuban sandwich. Also, I didn't taste any mustard. My panini wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it to be, and the cheese wasn't melted. I would have liked it if they had brushed melted butter on the outside on the bread before pressing it, and pressed it a bit longer, about 4 minutes on each side to get the cheese to melt and to create a golden brown, crispy crust. But other than that, if it was called a Ham and Cheese Panini instead of a Cuban, I would have been happy.

I don't like monster chains like Panera, and I like more mom and pop type places that do that style of food. They have some impressive looking viennoiserie, and I look forward to trying them in the future.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,23,20,4,qb5IPtcxcImuxwbXCN1WEQ

The breakfast burrito with turkey was decent, and I like how they finished in a panini press to get the exterior crispy. Lattes are consistently good and served warm but not piping hot, so I don't have to wait in order to start enjoying them. I've tried their soup of the day and a smoothie and was less than impressed with those items.

 Indoor seating is a bit limited, with a nice but awkward couch and fireplace area in the corner. They also have some tables outside if the weather is nice, but only a few are covered.

I chose Kenya beans and it was possibly the best cup of coffee I've ever had in my life.  Really. I also had a vegetarian grilled panini that was not only delicious hot-but was still good the next day when I ate the other half.

It's clean, bright, and very welcoming. There's even a couch that faces the fireplace! It almost makes you feel like you're right at home, especially right now with all the holiday decorations. 

I ordered the salmon panini, Caprese salad, and soup of the day (which was cheeseburger chowder- sounds gross but was actually really delicious and hearty!!!). The salmon panini was to DIE for. I am a salmon fanatic and was shocked at how delicious it was considering the simplicity of it, as well as the price! The salad was also very good; nice fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil. 

You definitely get the mom and pop owned feeling when you walk in. It's not a very big cafe (about 9 seat inside, but there is also seating outside as well) but I was not disappointed at all. Usually the small shops are the best!

They just need more customers. By far the best coffee I've tasted in this entire area. If you are a lover of genuine Italian espresso, and a wide variety of coffee drinks, this is the place for you. I will definitely be back.",XfW_g_DZnOwaJperZXeaag,0,0,4,B3YqHM1sSNp5aQlpGjq14Q

The man behind the counter, I believe was the owner was very friendly and made sure we were taken care of. The coffee was great! My kids took a seat next to their fireplace on a big comfy and clean couch. We will certainly come back to Globe soon. Thanks for the great service and coffee!",0uSLt3BODXJBG1CQE2KfiA,0,0,5,8U7UgIg-8ZkqnlSNRDr5qw

I ordered fruits crepe and caramel macchiato. Both were delicious. Ice cream and fruits on the crepe and fruits and whipped cream inside the crepe.
I going to here sometimes.",tSIKpSTlqexZ9sulnlbkUw,0,0,5,GCJV6F6_KaHtl9P9bpQsOg
