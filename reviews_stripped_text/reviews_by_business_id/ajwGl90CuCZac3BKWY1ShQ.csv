It is of less quality than the stuff they feed inmates at that tent prison in Arizona...literally. What McDonalds does is take some low quality beef, add soy and other mixtures for filler, and then flavor it with addictive chemical flavorings that they make in a lab. Look into it if you don't believe me.

1. I waited about 10-15 minutes for my food. I should've just went to a regular restaurant if I knew I was gonna be waiting that long.

2. AFTER they charged me for the McFlurry and after I waited 10-15 min, they told me their ice cream machine was down. I asked for a refund. They took too long with the refund so I just said screw it - give me cookies or something. So they gave me a bag of old & stale cookies.... thanks?

3. ALL of the food came cold. When I say cold .... I mean.... literally looked and tasted like it had been sitting for hours (you know that yucky McDonald's French fry taste after it was sitting for so long, so you microwave it?) that's how all of our food tasted. Even my COFFEE came cold. It tasted like it had been sitting & warmed with a microwave.

4. Not only was the food cold & stale... my Chicken tenders were so rock hard & over cooked that it's inedible!

So I just paid $20 for cold chicken, cold fries, cold coffee, all stale... all tasted like it had been microwaved..... and I waited sooo long for it to be disgusting and cold.

When it's dinner time I always order the Bacon, Ranch salad - no bacon bits, grilled chicken on the side and Ranch dressing. I repeat the order 2 to 3 times and they still get it wrong. There is always so much turn around in this place, that's probably the reason why they're NOT listening to the customer. Their new system of placing the order on an I Pad of sorts doesn't work. They can't custom order what I want. Each and every time I explain to the employee that machine won't take my order they don't believe me. I have to prove it to them.
