125366,2017-02-26,1,kpLt4l5J5kbMD4oxQLC2aA,"We came here after Pin Kaow had a 20 minute wait.  I'm sure glad we did.  I would say the King and I has been around for a very long time.  It's tucked away in what is considered ""The Lakes"" area of Las Vegas near Sahara and Durango.  I'm a loyal Yelper and count on my fellow Yelpers when I decide to go somewhere to eat.  I came here about 5 years ago and decided to return based on the Yelp reviews.

This place was legit.  My ""picky"" family loved it.  There were not a lot people around so the service was great as you would expect when no one else is around.  At the beginning the server was very direct, but as the night went on, the server and staffed warmed up to us. I appreciated that.

We ate at around 8:30 P.M. and I was concerned the food would not come out fresh.  I was wrong.  It was fresh and great tasting.  They also offer some Chinese dishes in addition to Thai food.

If you're a big fan of Thai BBQ Ribs, they do offer it here as an appetizer, not an entree, but even as an appetizer, they give you 4 good sized ribs with a fair amount of meat on them.  They were good.  I had the fried rice combination plate which adds Chicken, Pork, Shrimp and Beef.  It was really good.  It wasn't spicy but I didn't ask for it.  

We also had mixed vegetables with Chicken, Beef Peppered steak and Won Ton Soup as an appetizer.  All great.  Family had the steamed white rice and it was moist and fresh.  I want to try their traditional Thai dishes next time and I'm not usually that adventurous but I'm confident based on my experience that it will be good here. 

I will definitely return to The King and I.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,1,1,5,vNFmhxbqzOSH32gazP5lXQ
185570,2011-12-22,0,kpLt4l5J5kbMD4oxQLC2aA,"The food here is very good and the value is outstanding.

My recommendation: I ordered the Bangkok Connection which featured shrimp, scallops, chicken and pork mixed with carrot, bok choi, pea pods, and several other vegetables in a light pepper sauce that was not too spicy.  With the amount of shrimp and scallops in the dish, I don't see how they can serve it at $14.95.  This is an incredible value!

And even better, the dish was cooked perfectly.  The most impressive thing was that the scallops had obviously been cooked seperately because they were perfect: cooked through and warm but not rubbery (which happens with scallups if cooked even a minute too long).

There were a couple of minor issues.  First, when we got our left overs, the server wiped the spoon of sticky rice with her finger to get the last kernels into the box.  Also, atmosphere is slightly off for dining in.  It is small and cramped and the Neon signs are the main source of lighting.  It is on the Lake but you can't actually see the lake.  And on the trivial side, food does not come fast and there is a language barrier.  

So great value and delicious food gives them my very enthusiast 4 stars.",_f2gLN3JSI-WYpgakE66aw,0,0,4,6g-gcU3pPRBdTm_1610QFg

Ordered combo fried rice it was very good I think the only thing we ordered that was good we ordered pepper steak I asked for no onion and red bell pepper but said green bell only. We got no peppers and it just tastes bland same with the Kung pow combo. No flavor it tasted like TV dinner Salisbury steak.

A friend and I are having an anti-valentines dinner.. Or so we thought. Placed an order on eat24 at 8pm. Their delivery estimate says 45-60 mins. We realized it was vday, so realistically it would probably take an hour. Both times I had ordered before, it had been half an hour and they had called to let me know they were at the gate. 

When I hadn't heard anything at 9pm, I followed up with eat 24. Said they spoke with the restaurant and the driver was on his way. Great. No biggie. When no one was here at 9:25, I decided to just call the restaurant myself. Their phone was either off the hook, or they were deliberately ignoring calls. If it weren't for eat24, I would still have been charged for my food. Luckily they gave us a full refund. 

If you're too busy to keep up with your orders, then fine. At least call your customer to apologize and explain that you wouldn't be able to make it. Their food may be good, but this experience was unacceptable.",DUBGSJ9M-oPvpnbehC9p2Q,5,0,1,leyZqiZUSHgfoM4Zs8q0Ug

I've eaten here once or twice since my 20 year stay in The Lakes, and this last time, the food was so awful it was inedible. The softshell crab was overpoweringly fishy and the person I was eating with actually began to gag to the point where they needed to use the bathroom. I was very disappointed, because even my pad thai had a bizarre, low quality taste that implied it had either been left out all night or just scraped off the floor. I've never complained at a restaurant and I absolutely don't have high standards for food, but this was just the worst meal I have ever had. I'd have driven back and asked them to taste what they sold me (for twenty dollars) and see if they would be able to eat it if it weren't raining.

I love their:

Hot and Spicy Beef Combination Noodle Soup, if you have ever had Thai boat noodle before, this is as close as it gets and then some. This unique bowl of yummy goodness consists of beef, beef meatballs, Chinese broccoli, and a bold flavor of spices.  

Their papaya salad (Som Tum) is not too great and consistent.  I always request for extra extra spicy and it never is. What i usually get is always either too sweet or never enough salt. :( 

The Shrimp Tom Yum Goong however is really good and spicy as i always request it.  The customer service is as good as delivery service should be....Great! This bowl consists of squid, shrimp, octopus, mushrooms, onion, and a nice sour tang from the lime juice.  My request on spice was so on point, my husband choked sipping on the broth....mmmm just how i like it!

The Shrimp Springrolls on the other hand consists of wayyyy too much romaine lettuce and not enough shrimp.  :/

It is definitely a local establishment nestled in a small shopping center in the lakes area. First red flag in general for me was the picture menu. Standard Thai fair, panang, red curry, yellow curry, etc. Food was good, again pretty standard. Prices were average $10 or so an entry. Overall though my favorite for the same price or maybe a tad bit more is Lotus of Siam, but if you aren't willing to drive down there this would definitely more than suffice. 

I had the panang, my favorite unadventurous dish, and it was good - not out of the ordinary good but good. We had the Tom Kha Kai which had a large portion, chicken was dry however that seems to be the case at most places with this soup as it is hard to boil chicken and keep it tender.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,3,7SVHISsfXBFfkbiDcLUAbg

But the food is not Mom and Pop --- it is LV Strip quality and the Orange Roughy is outstanding.  Also...Linda does an excellent job of catering and has on many occasions helped me with parties and the food is always freshly prepared and beautifully displayed.  $$$ - their prices are very reasonable; I would say very affordable if you are on a tight budget.

Yesterday, we were charged for them, by owner,  Linda's quirky husband.   He changes his pricing at will...Also, I have ordered exactly the same thing as my husband, and my portion is always smaller.  I asked them why, they said men always get larger portions, even though we pay the same.  That's why we stopped going.  Yesterday, we were starving, it was convenient, so we went in.  The place was dead.  We ordered.  When the food came, ( while we were still eating our large bowl of soup) again,  hubby's portion was twice the size of mine.  Their portion size is never consistant, depends on if you are one of their favorites. We struck up up a conversation with the only other person in the place...Linda's husband aggressively approaches our table and asks if we are finished.  We had obviously not finished.  I told him no, we were still eating.  Like he wanted us to leave.  He returns in a minute, interupts our conversation again and asks if we wanted a box, I said ok, by then I just wanted to leave.   He and server don't ask if we want to save our large bowl of soup, just dumps other bowls and spoons into the soup, so we could not save it.  The thai tea rip off followed as we paid.

 I really liked the location, near our home, near the lake, a cozy,  relaxed place, we put up with the strange ""traditions"" but the owners are so unprofessional,  weird and rude.  Sometimes Linda is sweet and welcoming, the next time, she's ice cold...  Their unprofessional additude has finally overshadowed the food, which, by the way was once delicious. ( Very bland this time, chicken was of questionable quality...)after the way we were treated today, we will never come back. If you are one of their favorites, you'll be fine.

I was a customer here for a while, and only because their location is convenient and they deliver I stayed loyal and ordered food on a regular basis. The  FOOD is very average, my boyfriend didn't like it at all,as he knows what a good Thai food is, but since I am limited in my choices as I am vegetarian, I could live with it. It's hard to spoil tofu, you know.I agree with other reviewers, the food is different every time, and I had to ""enhance"" the flavor with bunch of sauces from my fridge.
 
Today I ordered as usual a soup and two main dishes. My procedure to order is the same- I always make sure they understand it is a vegetarian order and I will get tofu and veggies instead of meat. To my surprise- I received an order with Tofu in the soup only! The main dishes were just bunch of veggies! 

Ok, I call them up and talk to the same person who took the order. I think he said his name is Kal or something like that. To my surprise, he started to argue with me and say that I ordered only veggies! His English is somewhat limited I think. But it didnt stop him from being extremely rude! He  said  he heard my order  very well, and that I didn't make it clear what I want, and that if he had a recording he would prove I am wrong! He didn't offer anything to do about the issue as if I am calling just to say hello! He was very rude, especially when I insisted they fix the mistake in one way or another. He told me not to teach him what to do! Who talks like this? Especially to a customer? This argument was very frustrating for me. At the end  he said he can send me some tofu so I can add it and mix it up! Not to mention that one dish even didn't have mushrooms,though they are listed on the menu! At this point I got very angry myself and said I will cancel the credit card charge as I am not paying $38 for veggies  and I do not want to wait another hour for a tofu to come in, then  he offered a 20% discount on my next order, though I made it clear I have no desire to order from them any more. He even didn't care about that.

So, if you don't want to spoil your day and deal with these people- order somewhere else, I wish I read reviews on Yelp before I payed them hundreds of dollars this year! I am sure there should be a better Thai delivery place in 89117 area!",_3i53YRGV7tqHJFRVSri9A,0,0,1,eXuQrVTJZQ75gxisim1vCw

KING & I STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS: A familiar dish done really well, wings stuffed with pork and glass noodles. Not too greasy, four piece order for $8. 
DUCK NOODLE SOUP: Duck plus noodles, in a savory brown soup with cilantro and bean sprouts. The best and worst part was the broth, which was extremely rich and flavorful, but entirely too greasy to enjoy the entire portion. 
KING & I FRIED RICE: Fried rice with the usual mix of meats (shrimp, chicken, bbq pork) and the addition of pineapple and cashews. The last two ingredients made me hesitant to order this, but they made the dish! The nuts added a nice texture and the citrus helped cut the excess oil. Menu describes this as spicy and I didn't detect any heat at all, added in an entire cup of chili oil and it was just right.

It's small, and nicely decorated- definitely a neighborhood kind of spot, I really enjoy the ambiance. Opted for a large takeout order, flavors were good and prices were fair.  Unfortunately, the excessive oil/grease used in a few of our dishes turns me off to coming here  frequently, but it's a solid option for rice and noodle dishes.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,15,4,qFNddhMHLRmIJ4Bpl0Gjkw

King & I is that place. It is by no means your average Asian food, so don't be surprised if the Orange Chicken is not what you are used to. Even the fried rice is very different. It's good, but it's not fried and sticky.

We went in to order take out. There service was mixed. the first woman was nice, the second was rude, the man was friendly, but short with us. Honestly, kind of typical of Asian restaurants in Vegas.

One person in our party ordered green curry and when the dishes came out, they gave her red curry. The person in our party told the waitress that she ordered green curry, the waitress argued and argued that red curry was ordered and refused to take it back and left it on the table. So my group member reluctantly ate it. I ordered Kung pow chicken and it was about the worst I ever had, but maybe it was my fault, ordering a Chinese dish at a Thai resturant. It was extremely salty. I tried my wife's mint beef dish and that was also very salty. Bottom line: service: thumbs down. Food: thumbs down.",k3FnRgkMnQmU03xlsuPypA,4,0,2,xXPFuIP2AJmXa2R4nfWiMQ
2261616,2012-02-08,0,kpLt4l5J5kbMD4oxQLC2aA,"This review is for takeout through roadrunnerfood.com only.  I've never been to the restaurant.

We've ordered from them twice and it's been tasty each time.  I've tried the Panang curry and the red curry.  Both were excellent.  The larb was also really good.  They have pork larb... yum! I also liked the spicy catfish.  The homemade chili sauce it came with was more like a curry.  Still, pretty good.

When we ordered the hot and spicy beef and meatball noodle soup to go, the noodles were packaged separately.  But we got confused and ended up mixing them with another dish, shrimp pad hot chili pepper, because we did not know what dish they were supposed to go with.  (I guess we forgot we ordered noodle soup.) So the soup wasn't all that good.  The shrimp pad hot chili pepper tasted good, but it wasn't supposed to be a noodle dish, apparently. I should probably just go to the restaurant and eat the dishes as intended.

Each time, we've asked the food to be ""very hot"" (aka spicy) but it has always come out pretty mild.  Luckily, they give us some hot sauce and chili pepper flakes.  But I'm not convinced that the food is the same if they just made it spicy in the first place.  I understand the reluctance to give truly spicy food to people through a third party delivery service.  So once again, we are probably going to have to visit the restaurant to eat the dishes as intended.  Still, I really dig this Thai food.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,1,1,4,8st64Xm_Ar4L9U6nOFKQ3Q

Me and my boyfriend predictibly order the same thing every time: some kind of chicken curry, tom kha gai, and thai beef salad. We share everything and always have leftovers.

This restaurant is Thai and Chinese fusion, but since I was feeling more hungry than adventurous I stuck with one of my favorite Thai staples: green curry with chicken. 

Unlike some other Thai restaurants I've been to, they don't let you choose your spice levels here. This could be a problem for those who are sensitive to spicy foods, but I thought they found the perfect balance of spice from the curry paste and creaminess from the coconut milk. Thai curry is all about balance of flavor as well as contrast of texture, and their green curry incorporated both of those elements. 

The service is decent and prices are reasonable as well. Portions are sized to share, so if you have your eye on multiple dishes your group can just try a bit of everything. 

The King and I is tucked away in The Lakes so it's a little hidden gem for your Thai food fix. I hope to be back soon!",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,1,2,5,3CmNHfN2Uq6yy0p6c7nkjA

I think the only thing is that every once in a while you get a little less than what's normally expected, but that's not common at all. Like I said, consistently good food, at least for 90% of the time I've had the food here.

Located in a nice neighborhood, although somewhat hidden, this place has a really cool atmosphere and friendly service.  Trendy music playing, it's a very inviting and ""warm"" place to eat!

I ordered the Thai beef jerky and one of the specials, salmon curry.  The Thai jerky was pretty good.  It came with a sauce that looked much more exotic than it tasted.  The sauce was rather bland.  That was ok though because the jerky itself had a nice roasted flavor.  It wasn't too chewy either!  

The salmon with curry was a slight disappointment for me.  I ordered it a 4/4 on the heat level, and it came out rather mild.  The taste of the curry, which was a panang style curry with moderate thickness to it, was rather bland.  A tad sweet, and thick, not offensive in any way, but bland.  The salmon was a nice big portion for $16, and tasted pretty good although a touch dry.  It came with American broccoli, which usually pairs well with this style of curry.  That was probably my favorite part of the meal.  They also give you a big portion of rice, so sharing would be an easy thing to do here.

Overall, this Thai restaurant is a good one if you don't like your Thai food too spicy or too flavorful.  For me though, I am not sure I can find a reason to go back.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,3,1,3,LZGDkIfKkLTM_EpofNc81w

Pad Thai. A must for any first venture to Thai dining, and theirs did not dissapoint. Every bit of peanuty fish sauce goodness married beautifully to noodles.

The Beef Salad and Spicy Chicken Larb were also aromatic highlights, cooked so fresh and yet so light as to not induce any food coma. Health conscious diners can dig these dishes almost guilt free.

Our favorite dishes are the panang curry, red curry, pad Thai, and kung pao chicken.

3617313,2010-12-28,1,kpLt4l5J5kbMD4oxQLC2aA,"King & I is a little restaurant surrounded by houses hidden in the community known as ""The Lakes"" that resides next to an artificial (very) blue lake. Perhaps like in a rural area of old Thailand, but instead hidden in a jungle and residing next to a real lake. Would be nice I imagine to be served Thai tea and just sit there enjoying the scenic view of the lake, but for me when I taste a Thai restaurant's thai tea it sets my mentality of the. For King & I was ""meeeeeeh"" because of the overly sweetness and a mild tea essence. 

King & I delivers, which is a huge factor in why I consume their productions even though the food is ""meeeeeeeeeh"". The consumption of their food takes place during my work days where I usually do not have much time to take a breather and taking a thirty may result in chaos possessing my work place. Godsend that they are delivering from their work approved yummies from a location fairly close. Most importantly delivery is decent, usually 20-25 minutes, which might break down into 15 minutes to cook and prepare for delivery then another 10 minute drive.

They have an excellent value lunch menu, but is limited to a daily special if you're ordering on a Monday to Friday. On the weekends though you can choose any of the lunch specials. The lunch specials are usually consisted of a fruit salad with a mild salty dressing, a scoop of fried rice, ""insert lunch item"", and a (20oz?) fountain drink. For the most part I order the chicken pad thai because I enjoy noodles, although when its to go the noodles are usually bundled together because of its time in the styrofoam container. The pad thai always seems to be a bit sweet to me though, even with an increase in spice level, I can still taste a sweetness. 

I've had a few of the curries (panang and yellow curry) here during my off days, and for the most part, they are a bit sweet for me, but smell great. 

The service here is friendly, but sometimes when I order over the phone there is a bit of the a language barrier, especially when I ask for recommendations. 

Great for lunch, but during off times where time is not a limiting factor, I would try one of the many other Thai restaurants in the area.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,3,2,3,Y3iyTZ6GMhLrMHK2F-EhbQ

The Delivery is always fast always quicker then told and always hot and freshly made.  The delivery packaging is secure and never had leaks.  They always send a new menu which has a $5 off $20 or more so if I remember it makes a great discount!

Add ons- Brown rice, I think I found a new favorite. It seems like this was soaked or sprouted then steamed. Not a traditional brown rice that barely has the nutrient hulls scrubbed off. Cucumber salad- vegetable candy. ;)

We started with their  appetizers. I had the spring rolls which were  nice and crispy. They had this sauce that I thought would be my much sought after plum sauce but it was just a really sweet dipping sauce. It was good .  My husband had their Thai Beef jerky which was a little tougher than other places we have tried. 

I haven't had curry in a long time so I tried their Yellow Curry .It had potatoes , coconut milk and of course curry . The dish was really flavorful and hearty.  They give you a big serving with plenty of rice. It can easily be shared between two people.

Located on the main lake, right behind the big Citibank complex, they do both Thai and Chinese food. The staff are always very friendly and I have always received good service. Linda, the owner, will typically come over and say hello if you go in there enough too.

Whenever judging foods from different regions, it seems like there is always one item upon which all opinions are based. For example, a lot of people judge Mexican restaurants by their salsa. For me, I judge Thai restaurants by their Tom Kai Gai soup. King and I's is incredible. The coconut milk broth is perfect and the chicken and mushrooms are always just right. 

For an appetizer, I usually get the chicken satay, although this is mostly for the peanut sauce. I love Thai peanut sauce, but there can be quite a bit of variation depending on the restaurant. King and I's is one of the best I've had.

The entrees are all good. I have yet to try one that I don't like. The only time I've heard anyone complain about one of their dishes was when an acquaintance ordered the pad thai. She claimed the noodles were too sweet. I didn't think so, but consider it a possible drawback if that's your favorite dish. Regardless, besides her, everyone I've ever gone to King and I with has been pleased.

What I ordered:
Panang Curry- I ordered it medium spicy and it wasn't spicy at all... like no spice; but that's not the bigger deal, it's that the curry was super, super, sweet. Just not very good. The consistency was great, the flavor was just off.

Pad Thai (with chicken)-This was terrible. Legit, the worst pad Thai I've ever had. The noodles weren't the ""normal"" pad Thai noodles, rather they were more round like chow mein style. The noodles were very dry and had a strong flavor of old grease. (You know the flavor of old french fry grease style). Furthermore, the chicken in the pad Thai was large chunks with gristle. Sorry... I don't do gristle. I'm all game for some juicy dark meat, but gristly chicken is a deal breaker for me.

White rice- O.K. A little over-cooked and mushy... but passable.

Crab rangoon- Inedible. No, really... I KNOW good crab rangoon; I'm a connoisseur of crab rangoon (just ask my thighs). The crab rangoon had a really funky flavor, combined with the old grease flavor. I ate 1 and threw the rest away.

An order like this being not shared by anybody should at least give me leftovers for a day-- alas the food was so unappetizing I threw it all away.

I went during the swing shift so it was nice and quiet and I knew I would be able to enjoy myself without feeling rushed and crowded. My waiter as nice and helpful with selecting my choices. For an appetizer I chose the spring rolls. They were the crispest spring rolls I have ever had. They cut them in half so you can share with someone or take them home in a doggie bag for later. For my main entree I had the Pad Kee Mao with pork, mint, bell pepper, onion, and other spices served with flat wide rice noodles. It's one of the most flavorful native Thai dishes to be had. I like spicy so I asked for extra spice but they didn't believe me so I had to keep asking for peppers and hot sauce. But since I have visited several times in the last 6 months, I think they have gotten the idea. Subsequent visits I have enjoyed the Pad See Ewe, Singapore Noodle-minus the shrimp (allergic), Pad Thai, and the Won Ton Soup. I am rating this place as a 5 for the food. But I must say the service has gone down hill as the original waiter that I have had every visit except for this last time on July 27 wasn't there and I seemed to be an after thought with every request.

Spicy Thai fried rice with pineapple and cashews is one of my favorite dishes and I have ordered it in many, many restaurants. Well, when this dish was delivered to my home, what I received appeared to be rice mixed with pineapple, cashew, and meat. There was absolutely no spice whatsoever. Not even a hint. I couldn't even see anything other than the rice, meat and veg. I don't even think it was fried. It was so incredibly dry. The Pad See Ewe had no flavor at all either. Just wet flavorless vegetables and noodles. The panang curry was not spicy, but at least I could taste that. It still wasn't very good. I called to speak with the manager to resolve the issue, but when I finished telling her about the Thai fried rice, her response was ""So what do you want."" When I wanted my money back, Surprise! They don't do that. So if you want a large portion of flavorless food that's not cheap, this is the place for you. Gross. Do not eat here if you like Thai.

5390869,2012-05-25,2,kpLt4l5J5kbMD4oxQLC2aA,"If there's one thing we need more of in Las Vegas it's Thai food.   The current structure of one every block simply will not do!   Needless to say I was excited to try the King & I when it popped up on my ""Best Matches"" list on my way back from a haircut (Hypnotic Salon, check my review [plug plug]) 

I went simple on my order with a Chicken Pad Ka-Pow (they spell it Kra-Pow on their website but I've seen in Ka-Pow on others which sounds much cooler).   Right off the bat I loved how they asked if I wanted the chicken sliced or ground.   Sliced, always sliced.  Then they asked me for a spice level and I went my usual 7 out of 10.  They then asked me for a level from 1-4 which totally threw me for a loop.   I didnt really get why I had to do the math conversion myself.   Let's see, 10/4 is 2.5   so 7/2.5 is a 2.8?   #1) I have no idea if I even did that right and #2) in real life I ended up just saying ""2 and a half to 3?""   I also ordered a bottled water as advertised on their site and was told they only had iced tea or lemonade.  I was mildly flustered with this whole process.

Service was friendly in regards to picking up the food, and I brought it back to the office to eat.  The 2nd big bright bonus spot in addition to the sliced/ground option was the plethora of sauces they provided.  In my bag were packets of soy sauce and hot mustard, and little containers of hot sauce and sweet and sour sauce.  Way to be thorough!   As for the meal itself I was surprised to find a small fruit salad, an egg roll, and lots of those (technical term ahead) crispy fried wonton strip thingies.

The egg roll may have been the best bonus egg roll I've received in a Thai lunch special, as it tasted fresh and was larger than I usually expect.  The fried wonton crisp thingies were delightful as always, and I bypassed the fruit salad because it was too healthy for me.   I really enjoyed the flavor of the KA-POW!, and actually prefer it to many of the other versions I've tried at other restaurants here in town.  If you would have seen me scarfing it down in my office you'd have thought I was going for a record.  The only thing disappointing about the meal as a whole was I didnt really get any kick out of the spice level I requested.  I'm not sure if when I called they didnt understand when I said 7 out of 10 or if they actually do just prefer to deal with a 1-4 level, but next time I would definitely try a solid 3 or maybe even 3.5 given the lack of spice I got this time.  

Overall very solid!  With only 500 options for Thai restaurants here, it should be easy to make room for King & I for a visit.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,1,4,FtlIf3ij3JxyMLh9GSEZXw

It's in a nice little shopping center, situated right next to the lake of ""The Lakes"".

Things started out well enough, my girl and I reviewed their selections, placed an order, and waited.

And waited.

And waited.

A girl came in, placed a to-go order, left, came back, and picked up her order.

We still waited.

Bear in mind that there was only one other couple in the restaurant, who had already gotten their food, and were finishing up eating.

Finally, we got our food after about 45 minutes.  The pork ribs were actually frozen internally.  Not as in frozen completely solid, but it was that stage of cold where the ice had just melted, but its temperature still permeated the food.  It was colder than my drink.

The rest of the food was just okay.  I wanted to like it, it just wasn't anything exceptional.

Finally, we waited for the check.  We kept trying to get the attention of the waitress.  We were the only customers at this point, and she was watching TV and chatting away to a friend on her cell phone.  Finally, after a loud ""Excuse me"", she turned around, told her friend she'd call them back, and got us our check.

Not impressed.

Still, the view surrounding the restaurant is wonderful.  We took a nice walk by the lake, and then decided to find something else to snack on to pad our unsatisfying lunch.

Great location, frozen food, distracted service.  Don't bother.  

UPDATE: And while I've been ""reviewed"" myself in this review for being some sort of ""meanie"" in not finding perfection during my unsatisfactory visit, I don't think it would be a reasonable expectation for me to just automatically 5-star this place because I was unable to enjoy the same apparently positive experience that others did.

My boyfriend and I are both sick with mega colds, so we decided to order some food for delivery.   
We've been regulars at this restaurant for a loooong time.  Personally, I've been coming here for well over 5 years, and I've never had any issues before. 
We ordered Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, Won Tons, and Tom Kha Gai for a total of about $40, for delivery.  The food was delivered on time, but everything was horrible!  I couldn't believe this food was even from the same restaurant.  I actually wondered if we had accidentally called some other place.  The won tons were hard, and looked baked.  The bottoms were flat with little bumps on the bottom (maybe some frozen, boxed brand?).  One of the won tons looked completely different than the rest.  It was a lot smaller, fried-looking, and a different shape.  Wtf?  The Pad Thai was bland, and the noodles weren't even the right kind! The Pad See Ew was mushy, and gross, with almost no sauce. All of the chicken was horribly overcooked.  The food was so bad that we decided to drive over, and return everything without even trying the soup. 
I calmly explained everything to the owner when I got the restaurant, and he was a complete asshole to me!  I apologized, told him that I wasn't trying to insult him, and that I loved his restaurant, but that this food just wasn't up to standard.  He ate a bunch of the food from our takeout containers (ew!), and said that it tasted the same as it always did.   He wouldn't even admit that it looked different, when it obviously did.  He refused to give me a refund, because it wasn't ""merchandise"".  After loudly arguing with me in front of about 10 other customers, and yelling at other employees in a different language while pointing at me, he finally agreed to give me my money back, saying that he had never had to do that before, and that he shouldn't have to.  I told him that all legitimate restaurants refund their clients when they're unsatisfied, and he actually had the gall to say ""OH, SO YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE!?""  I was speechless.  Seriously?  Yeah, I just LOVE paying for delivery when I'm sick,  then driving around town, returning nasty food, and dealing with rude business owners.
He said that he refused to deliver to me again, and that if I ever ordered pick up, I'd have to taste everything at the restaurant before being allowed to take the food home.  What a joke!  I don't think he'll have to worry about that happening any time soon.  I would have gladly given this restaurant another shot  if he hadn't been so insanely rude to me, but after this kind of ""service""?

My favorite is the Cashew Nut with tofu... sooo flavorful and leaves me full and satisfied every time! If you're not feeling a soft drink with your meal, just pay an extra $1.50 to upgrade your drink to a Thai tea or Thai iced coffee! 

The staff are friendly and service is really fast - sometimes I'll call in for a pick up order and they'll have it ready within 5 minutes. The inside is kind of small but cozy and has has an authentic Thai feel to it.

The curries are all good with steamed rice, specifically the green curry which is a bit sweet from the coconut milk but not overbearing.

5723836,2010-12-11,1,kpLt4l5J5kbMD4oxQLC2aA,"After writing my first review of this place, I originally gave them a 4.  I was raving about their pad thai, which I had a couple of weeks ago while dining in, and then had a craving for it.  So, the other night, my friend and I ordered food to go... Which is why I ended up dropped that first review down to a 3-stars.....

When I called in the order, the guy who answered seemed short on the phone, and after I got off the phone with him, I had a feeling that he didn't get my order right (a simple pad thai with tofu AND an order of beef satay).  So I asked my friend to double-check the order when he was picking it up...and yes, our order was incorrect.  Apparently, the guy missed the second item, so my friend had to order it then and ended up having to wait the extra time.  And even then, they ended up giving us chicken satay instead of the beed satay that we wanted.

Maybe it was a different cook OR simply because he had our food to go, but the quality of the food was not the same as when I first had it just three weeks before... The pad thai was not as tasty, it was on the salty side, and the noodles were not as moist and sticky as I had described them in my first review.  As for the satay, the chicken was dry and the peanut sauce did not look good at all... In fact, it was too thick (just not the same consistency as other, normal peanut sauces out there), and it just looked old and the color too dark (as if it was not freshly made that day and had been microwaved over and over again).

This take-out experience turned me off, as I don't think I will be returning for their food...especially when there are a lot of other thai restaurants out there who can offer better quality and better service.  Trust me, I've frequented other places, for both dine-in and take-out, and I've never had this problem of inconsistency before.  And this is why I have dropped my rating of ""King & I"" down to a 2...because I have DEFINITELY had better.",nj0Ls0-lCgjNoH7kl_XHoA,7,2,2,xuHAiLhK6yfPYRIm9Z-kZg

I stumbled on this via Eat24, it was close by (really close) and it looked good. Last night the boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. So glad we did, I will always eat here when I want Thai. We got green curry, pad Thai, combo fried rice, spring rolls. EVERYTHING we got was delicious, cooked well and full of flavor. Mmmmm mmmm",rwxIAhvgoYQZr6VNz1lvhA,0,0,5,3Z8eAEwlxsfUMxuQIwgf1Q

MMMMMM Their SWEET AND SOUR sauce is yummy! I want to take a bath in it. Hand me a case of it please...

I was introduced to this Thai place through my friend Karen who eats here on a regular basis. This restaurant is hidden, very hidden as I used to live across the street from it for years and never once saw or heard of it.

So we went to lunch today and dined on two complete meals, hot and sour soup, an appetizer order of spring rolls and two drinks for $15.03. Very nice! Basically my meal was free, love it.

What we ordered:

Meals come with Hot and Sour soup which was really good!

Chicken Pad Thai w/rice

Pad Kee Mao

Appetizer spring rolls

Food was good, I am partial to Thai BBQ by my house, but was open to try this Thai restaurant as is my friend's pick and close to her Apartment. I was not impressed with the spring rolls Appetizer, a bit dry and not very flavorful.


Service was good, plenty of refills a flowing!

My Pad Thai noodles were good and the portions are good and filling for the lunch special selection.

I walked out stuffed, licking my lips and happy!

I took pictures, yay I remembered :)",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,8,7,3,jPRDFcBz0KQx93J0FipoXw

SHARE the dishes - they are HUGE. The $6.99 Egg Drop Soup was the size of a 12"" wide, 5"" deep salad bowl (used for serving).

You will experience a party in your mouth at this place.",7OYQhMvldzCRCxdStv8YJw,0,0,5,jwK8ROfsUrE8Fy62xthEqw

5893153,2017-06-24,0,kpLt4l5J5kbMD4oxQLC2aA,"Love, love my first meal here, red curry with pork. The coconut basil sauce was amazing!!
You choose heat level from 1 to 5, I went with 2, which was perfect! It was pretty spicy, and that shows me this place is the real deal!
Lots of veggies in this entree, such as peppers and bamboo shoots. 

My second meal, a shrimp curry entree, was less amazing. Again, the sauce was the star, but it lacked veggies. It was good, but I was so impressed with the pork curry that I will be getting that next time! They have a quick turn around on takeout and I never waited longer than the quoted time.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,1,0,4,0zChoB310no2swC_lxaVgg
5918768,2011-03-30,1,kpLt4l5J5kbMD4oxQLC2aA,"A tiny mom and pop-type Thai restaurant secluded in the middle of ""The Lakes"" suburb of SW Las Vegas (W. Sahara and Durango), serving up homey but flavorful Thai and Chinese food without the fancy culinary flare.  That is how I would describe King & I Restaurant.

Frankly, I think the location of the business is far from ideal, given the very limited car and foot traffic on the residential street it is situated in.  However, the restaurant has been in business since at least 1996 when it earned its first ""The Best of Las Vegas"" award and presumably is still operating on the same spot, so they must be doing something right.

They offer $7.95 lunch specials from 11am-3:30pm.  Besides their usual lunch specials, on each weekday there is a unique lunch special, and on Saturdays, all the weekday lunch specials are available.  I guess for those that work or live nearby, you can keep coming back and order something different every visit and not get bored.  

My review is based upon my recent dinner visit to use up a Groupon I bought for K&I before it expires.  And overall, I was satisfied with my meal and the service provided.  I thought the price was reasonable for the portion served, as well as, on par with other Thai restaurants in the area.  The food I ordered was tasty. However, I thought that the culinary skills of the cooks preparing the food were just average, so on a typical day you are getting your average mom and pop-type restaurant food.

Yum Woon Sen (I have seen it translated as Thai Glass Noodle Salad at other Thai restaurants).  It is a salad composed of shrimp, chicken and clear/glass noodles flavored with spicy lemon juice. It costs $9.95, but is large enough to serve as an entrée salad for one average person, or plenty to split for 2.  I liked it, and can see myself ordering this as a small dinner.

Panang (Sweet) Curry - $9.95.  Choice of beef or chicken ($11.95 for shrimp), sautéed with kaffir lime leaves, bell peppers, coconut milk and peanut butter sauce.  It was good, plenty of chicken and a lot of curry to go with the rice until you are full.

Thai Iced Tea - $2.50.  If my one and only Thai Iced Tea is the typical glass served to every customer, then it is one of the better ones I found served in local Thai restaurants.  It is not overly sweet like at many other restaurants, but no refills (hats off still to The Original Thai BBQ on S.Jones for the generous refills).

Service was adequate and pleasant.  It was nothing special or extraordinary, especially considering that I was dining alone and the restaurant wasn't packed to capacity.  My food order was taken, and when it was prepared it was delivered to the table while it was still hot.  

I didn't have room for desserts, but their selection of premade European style desserts (tiramisu, European Pie, Manhattan Truffle, White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake) priced in the range of $3 to $4.55 had no effect on my typical urge to consume sweets before, during or after a meal.

Ambiance: 2/5  Just a small restaurant with Thai decorations here and there, with the bulk of it mostly out of view towards the back hallway leading to the kitchen.  I did felt relatively relaxed looking at the guppies and angelfish swimming in the small fish tank during dinner.
Food:  3/5  Typical mom and pop Thai food at average price with nice portions.
Service:  3/5  Adequate and pleasant.
Price:  3/5  Some items cost more than other Thai restaurants in the SW Las Vegas area, while others is cheaper.  But overall it is pretty comparable.

3 stars!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,1,3,7PYyhDt8Mqo_U_U8N_56pQ
