854945,2017-08-19,0,SVtv-HglZotLo64QMWtQfA,Excellent customer service here. Our host Torica was super helpful and informative of the new loaded fries that we don't have back in cali. She was really nice and positive attitude along with the rest of the staff. Definitely coming back here next time were in Las Vegas.,E_-VVqjr2zLSmut7h_r9mw,0,0,5,ih4i3YNt3H9nQO2GiXEhYA

So If you worked that day, thank you for being nothing short of amazing. They served you with a smile, joked around, & provided some of the best customer service around. This is definitely going to be our go to Wingstop from now on. From the start of walking in the door to the very end of walking out the door I did not experience a single bad thing what so ever. They can all turn your day around with just a smile. Best spot around",JtlRv7tkLMiAiCRgEuJIzg,1,0,5,8Iki4-IMIXxOHnp-un154Q

First things first was the customer service! She was such a nice girl!! She was very friendly and helped us out a lot. I wish I got her name, but she told me she just moved down her and really wanted to go to edc lol :) 
The food as well was really good, i would go here before Buffalo Wild Wings any day. Unfortunately I live in Henderson which is far from this location, I'm just hoping they are as nice down here as she was up there!",ug4NbwL7gIouAdN8DZ5TmA,0,0,5,uMiOVddoaCBk1bGcRNix7A
2655131,2017-06-13,0,SVtv-HglZotLo64QMWtQfA,I love their wings. Might be the best spot in town. I'm convinced! The food is always hot and the service is excellent. I have  no complaints about this joint! The only thing I wish is that they would have bone in wing specials on Monday and Tuesday instead of just boneless.,NrkNV1xU0dQoOxZz9pzw1w,0,0,5,nV8doWoNPmgRumF7wPfvOw

Although we just met in person, I fell in love. Definitely no CatFish here... hahaha. Sounds like an online dating scene gone oh-so-right! Well it is! I order online, baby. Lawd knows I'm impatient.

2930633,2017-11-16,0,SVtv-HglZotLo64QMWtQfA,This is a fast and easy place where I can go to lunch. The staff is really friendly and if you order ahead of time you are in and out. I usually take mine to go and eat it at my office. I get the hot boneless wing with fries and a drink and that fills me up. The hot is just the right amount of hot because I enjoy a kick but I don't want to be dying from the kick. The fries are seasoned and they are pretty good too! They have like a sweet taste but it's the right amount of sweet! Really enjoy getting lunch here.,p8IDOaEADVMeV65GzHbqKQ,2,1,5,CoO9tUCJAGsBNASc5PCQBw
3236207,2017-05-28,0,SVtv-HglZotLo64QMWtQfA,"While I was around my neighborhood on a small shopping trip with a mission for beer and a bottle of tequila, I noticed a new restaurant has opened up called Wingstop.

I've never eaten at a Wingstop before, but I'm all about some good wings with beer! 

The sign said open for business, so I stopped in to check it out. The aroma of the wings hits you as you enter in and because the place is so new [5 days old], the place has am immaculate look to it with the tables almost full of patrons who are eating or waiting for their order.

The cashier immediately says, ""Hi, welcome to Wingstop"" with enthusiasm. With a smile to match her energy, I did feel welcomed.

I let her know that I was just checking things out and without pushing products on me, she let me know that she was there to answer any questions if I had any.

The menu board was simple, not to complicated, and had quite a few flavor selections all menu items bundled with drinks and fries of different varieties.

I perused the menu and found something I would enjoy.

I ordered the 10 piece wings and had 2 choices of flavors. I chose garlic parmesan and BBQ wings.

I did not know that they came with a drink and side of fries. WOW! All for 11.99! Good deal! 

I placed my order and began walking around observing the dinging area. Lot's of seating, clean tables, and the patrons seem to be enjoying their meals.

I chatted it up with the cashiers and then eventually the manager asking if it was okay to take pictures for Yelp. He smiled and let me know that it was totally fine.

After receiving my order, which wasn't a very long wait at all, I headed home.

I couldn't wait to take a bite of the food and here's my assessment:

The wings, they were cooked just right, juicy and not drowning in butter garlic sauce or BBQ, plus I was given ranch dressing [You do get to choose your dipping sauces], The fries were soft, I prefer mine extra crispy but, that's my fault, I should've said something.

They Coke products but I did find a green tea that I enjoyed as it wasn't too sweet and so refreshing on such a hot day here in Las Vegas.

The customer service, the wait time for my food, and to biting into my wings seemed flawless and worth the wait.

I'm happy this place is now just down the street and is  another offering in the downtown Las Vegas area adding to the diversity of food to choose from if you're like me who resides in the area.

I'll be coming back again when I have them wing cravings! If you're in the Charleston/Maryland are, come stop in for a some good wings to enjoy!

But I did it...I received my to go order of boneless louisana rub and lemon pepper...both were severely salty and over seasoned... But their tea was great with the fresh lemons they had and the restaurant was very clean..I'll give them sine time to adjust before going again",RL3Dxq5kN6r_D87NAD8hIg,0,0,3,EDrKztqDsQfFYYPocwd2gA
3960329,2018-05-15,0,SVtv-HglZotLo64QMWtQfA,This is a great Wingstop. I stop here for lunch at least once a week. The staffs here are super friendly. The restaurant is very clean. My orders are always accurate and tasty. The only downside is this place can get really busy. Ordering 20 minutes before your arrival is probably a good idea. Definitely a great place to satisfy my cravings for good wings.,96GpOsmTQa0UJSo_9JEOog,0,0,5,ibX4gbH4dvhp5Lib0bJKlQ
