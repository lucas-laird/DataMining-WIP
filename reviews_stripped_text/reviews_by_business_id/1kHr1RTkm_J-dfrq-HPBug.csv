4849208,2014-01-27,1,1kHr1RTkm_J-dfrq-HPBug,"My wife and I have eaten here several times before, and each time previous the food was fast, cheap, and delicious. Sure, it's named differently but anyone who is anyone in Vegas knows it's the exact same food and menu as a Roberto's.

That's not my issue, however.

My problem is the last two times we went, it was late at night since my wife works a late swing shift. I'm not sure how the training works for these franchises, but aside from the questionable customer service, I can assume proper food handling and safety is not a part of the training and I will explain why based on what I saw with my own eyes.

We go in to order, and the cook, who was also working the register, was busy taking care of a big order before us. He pauses to take our order, without ringing us up and continues to finish the order before us. After 10-15 minutes since we entered, he finished the first order and continues to work on ours. Shortly after, he finishes our food and comes to cash us out. We went to pay with card but he told us he didn't know how to work the register or the card machine. He suggested us returning the next day to pay, which was a bit off to us both.

Now I mentioned questionable customer service, and it honestly can be overlooked if it wasn't for the fact that while he was working on our food, he was not wearing gloves, and he had open cuts on his hand which were bleeding as he was making our food and touching the register(and believe me when I say these cuts were deep enough to visibly see the blood) . It completely made us both sick to our stomachs and we had to leave.

We don't want to go back there knowing someone is bleeding all over our food, it's just unfortunate since the times we ate there previously everything was good, which is why Im giving a fair 2 stars out of 5.",n_DYDZeUbNwDLQwKHp61Xw,2,0,2,fENf62kON4cIVmyGcM7Gvg

5880398,2018-01-15,1,1kHr1RTkm_J-dfrq-HPBug,"Update!

This is my second visit here.
I don't know if it was a coincidence that on my first visit here I ordered when I was alone. 
Second visit, my husband (who is half black, by the way) came with me.

Anyway, we ordered the same as last time, Chilaquiles with no egg. 

I don't know if they think it's ridiculous to order chilaquiles with no egg or the fact that my husband, who is black, is with me, who is fair toned.

*I've eaten at places that seem to single out people who come in by OBVIOUS STARING AND JUDGING just for being there. I think it's just happened to us AGAIN, in a different way. And last time it was at Tacos El Gordo by the way. Racist! 

Anyway, so as we waited patiently for our order, some 15 people ordered AFTER us & BEFORE we got our order. 
After about 10 Carne Asada Fries that came out after our order, we asked the lady at the register where our food was? She said it wasn't ready yet. Which to me, is obviously not true. I know this because I work with food and I know what takes longer to put together. It takes much more effort to build 10 Carne Asada Fries than it is to make 2 orders of Chilaquiles WITH NO EGG! Where in the world would it ever take a total of 45 minutes for a simple breakfast dish? Nowhere! If this happens to you, you're getting played! I just played!
Let me just say this, she did not have a single care that we just waited half an hour while others were getting served before us. So, we decided to wait by the counter until our food was ready. As it should've been already anyway.

After another 10 minutes, she slides us our order and didn't even say a word as she greets the next person in line. If I wouldn't have asked if it was ours, I wouldn't have even known. So rude! No thank you. No sorry. Not even an excuse for the wait. No nothing. We asked again why it took so long for us to get our food when we ordered before all those people? She said, ""well next time you should call your order in!""

That was just the most ridiculous thing I ever heard and honestly it was so unprofessional of her. Also, she did not apologize or compensate us for our wait in any way, like any other decent food establishment would have done. And I really hope the management here reads this and does some changes with the lack of care for those that work with customers on their customer service and total lack of compassion. And not for me particularly, but for the sake of others because I will not come back here again.


This was written on January 14th, 2018 from a very upset pregnant (half white) woman who is married to a (half black) man.
