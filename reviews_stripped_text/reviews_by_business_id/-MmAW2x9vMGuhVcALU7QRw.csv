There  was a homeless man drinking his soda in a booth and my dad purchased him some food to eat a McDonald's employee then went over to the man after he picked up the food that was ordered for him and then told he needed to leave because this wasn't a hotel they then proceeded to turn off the soda machine so he couldn't get anymore soda I'll never support another McDonald's you people are disgustingly disrespectful the food was paid for let the man eat!!!!!,pOpGzwW1xQbMIK4kJmCZxA,0,0,1,vuqehclGzKFe7Ajx199JGw

I didn't try anything else on the menu but the iced coffee because I just wanted an ice coffee as I was passing by McDonalds and this had to be by far some of the worst iced coffee I've ever had. It tasted like water where I couldn't even tell if there was even any coffee in it. So I would recommend just walking a little further to get your iced coffee from a Starbucks because there are a lot down the strip, but I guess if you're there for a meal like burgers and fries then the quality of those foods MIGHT be the same.",hfMsuhcXiUOhw6rUXIZpaw,3,3,2,TWIYWAxvT0greH5-hjn7gQ

There were several homeless people inside... most are okay except one younger person hang over me (observing me and my food).    It got pretty uncomfortable and no employees noticed that.    After a few minutes, the guy then went to the garbage cans searching for food but came up empty.   He then came back hovered near my table - and I was very worried.   I put away my phone and packed up - went to the counter and asked for a bag to take what I did not finish back to the hotel.   

I was ready for a fight should the guy followed me out as I need to go to the stairway up to the pedestrian bridge back to Aria - and it was isolated in the morning.   It was good that he stayed in the restaurant when I left.  As I was ready for a struggle should he attack me at the stairway.   I think that I avoided a life and death struggle :-)     That is good enough for me!",-jt1ACMiZljnBFvS6RRvnA,0,0,1,DSgKyuHoa-ueCyy4lb6QZA

This franchisee should not be permitted to operate if they're only going to offer a small fraction of items commonly seen at other McD locations.,rhtps55mnfi2TP6bxn0tIA,0,1,1,Q9gE7RHrNVLimofhpfBMtg

Came here while I was adventuring at Vegas.  Had a strong craving for their apple pie and their Coca Cola Classic.  I literally had to travel great distance, battled a few hobos and street walkers, dodged a few bikes and cars, cross a bridge of glass, went up and down a few stairs.  And the experience was meh. 

This place was small and cramped and the floors, tables and seats needed to be cleaned.  And unlike any McDonald's I been to, their ""dollar"" any size drink is actually 1.79 for a small.. really?  Fortunately their Apple Pies still 2 for a dollar.  

Overall probably one of the worst McDonald's I've have seen.  And I have seen many!",f__9p6lo6hmwnAEh3yorsQ,89,53,2,xzazfU8o57SXBDxOJ5nS-A
