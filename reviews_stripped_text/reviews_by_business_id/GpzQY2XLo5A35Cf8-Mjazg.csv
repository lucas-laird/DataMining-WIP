If I hadn't of been drinking, I may have not lost it..but my god it was all so amazing. The burger was just like I ordered, rare, with bacon, and pepper jack cheese, the corn dog was fabulous (but the stick hilariously broke on me), the fried pickles were an unexpected treat, and those fries..a hedonistic gut bomb of bacon, cheese, and a flavorful, creamy condiment sauce that take the whole dish to heights of belly devastating satisfaction, and suffering. I loved every bite, but regretted the hell out of it later. I'll say about Johnny Vegas Grill, exactly what I'd have said about my favorite ex boyfriend, ""I hate myself for loving you."" ..but I keep coming back for more.

4 stars because I found a piece of steel wool in one of their burgers once. I really enjoyed the fries and that burger, or I wouldn't have given them another chance. Their food has become something of an addiction. I enjoy living dangerously, I guess. haha",CmTSZNEjcwxFfvq71WTM0g,0,0,4,Bl_1ZTIOdrZmlh19eYS1OQ

229907,2016-03-29,0,GpzQY2XLo5A35Cf8-Mjazg,"This place was inside of a dive bar called Mr. G's. This was a nice find near my place for some slightly better than average bar food, a beer, and to see a game. The creative JVG fries are my favorite menu item so far.  I ordered hot wings, cheese pizza, and philly cheese steak fries.
Wings=the wings were big which I did not like.  They were breaded and then dipped in hot sauce. I am a naked wing fan. The wing sauce was a good flavor.  I will not order the wings again.
Philly fries= I will order this again.  Fries cooked well and the philly steak meat had a good flavor.
Cheese pizza= i will not order this item again.  The pizza was sprinkled with italian seasoning and garlic which was good. The cheese was great, the sauce was decent, but the crust ruined the pizza.  It seemed like a stiff frozen pizza crust like red baron freezer pizza. I requested a side of marinara which was the same as what was used on the pizza so I doubt the entire pizza was frozen and cooked. JVG please change the pizza crust... It is not good... At all.
I would compare this place to the food place in Rum Runner near the corner of boulder and gibson. Although I need to try a JVG burger and some other items to make a full assessment. Recision to come on my next visit.",C9QPC4Qs1tIhHUeeLYXfig,1,0,2,RTGj7Eyg6MHnJBKVqgpA4w

Only one downside to ordering for delivery... Says minimum order for delivery is $15, then you complete your order and at checkout it says minimum is $20. When ordering for only yourself and no time to pick up the order, I had no choice but to order stuff I don't need/want like soda and dessert.

You don't see that often so while I can't talk my husband or son into eating here again even if for free, that type of customer service shows a whole lot about a place and how it's run. Plus there aren't many bad things I've read about this place. Like I said every place has a bad day, or order in my case but the way he tried to make it right impressed me. Maybe I'll stop in one day when I'm alone and bring home my leftovers and then prove my family wrong.

955075,2017-03-31,0,GpzQY2XLo5A35Cf8-Mjazg,"I learned about Johnny Vegas Grill (JVG) through Yelp, of course. Very positive reviews from patrons, with many giving  4 or 5 stars. So, two days ago, I had a craving for pizza and burgers, and really I just wanted to indulge in good food. 

 I looked over the JVG menu on Yelp and was impressed by the limitless number of food options available. This establishment offers everything, from pizza, burgers, hot sandwiches, salads, and deli sandwiches, to battered fish, chicken strips, fries, onion rings, wings and a variety of appetizers. I'm a foodie,  with a palate for all sorts of foods/cuisines, so I love this. 

I placed my first order from JVG through Yelp eat24. I chose the 16 inch ultimate pizza,  2 JVG burgers (these are build-your-own burger's) garlic bread, and an order of their fish and chips. For one burger I added american cheese and bacon (both of which were an additional .95 cents charge) grilled onions, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo and mustard. The second one, which was for my daughter, was to include american cheese, mushrooms, jalapeños, grilled onions, bacon and lettuce. The jalapeños, grilled onions, bacon and mushrooms were also an additional .95 cents each. My total came to nearly $60. There was no delivery charge.

The delivery quote time was average, 45-55 minutes. So, I was impressed when my food arrived within 30 minutes, possibly less! Seriously, it seemed like jet fast delivery! Score!! 

Upon first glance, the food was hot! I looked over the pizza first, since that's the main thing I wanted. It had all the toppings for an ultimate/supreme pizza, but, it just didn't look too appealing. It looked like a frozen pizza. I lifted the pizza up to check the bottom crust and it felt really hard, just like frozen pizza crust. I'm worried at this point because being a yelp browser, I recently came across a reviewer who claimed that the pizza from JVG  he/she had ordered tasted like a frozen ""Red Barron"" pizza. I tasted a slice, and low and behold, that's exactly what it reminded me of...Red Barron, which I'm familiar with because I only buy that brand. So, I was disappointed because at $18.99 for a 16 inch, I was looking for ""real"" pizza. I felt it was way over-priced, and wished I'd just made my own.

About 3 hours later, I reheated a slice and was completely disgusted. The crust (also mentioned by another reviewer) was completely undercooked. It was soggy, mushy, just absolutely gross. In all honesty, this is the worst pizza I've ever eaten. The pizza alone, I felt was just a 1 star. I would never order it again.

The burger's- my daughter's burger should have had cheese on it. There was none. The bottom bun was soggy, inedible. She had to remove it and just eat the burger without the bottom bun. I thought my burger patty tasted burnt. I didn't enjoy it because of this. But I did eat it all, wasn't so bad that it was inedible. Overall, even with having to remove the soggy bun, my daughter still enjoyed her burger. 

The fish and chips- these were OK. The dish came with tarter sauce and malt vinegar. The fries had Italian seasoning sprinkled on them, the fish was alright (you get four) but not something I'd order again. I'd agree with the price had the dish been outstanding.

Garlic Bread- It was OK. Had Italian seasoning on it. Looked and tasted like garlic bread and the cost was reasonable.

I gave JVG 3 stars. The three stars, for the most part, are for the outstanding customer service they displayed. I did call in to tell them about my daughter's burger. They were very friendly and apologetic and offered to remake the burger or refund me, all at their travel expense. I opted to have the refund since my daughter found a way to eat the burger and plus we had food from another establishment, as well. Within 40 minutes they were at my door with my refund and also brought me a Hershey's candy bar. I really appreciated that. They did what any GOOD business would do. Just the customer service alone would be a reason I'd return here. I'm big on how businesses treat patrons and in my book, JVG gets 5 stars for it. Hands down. 

So, in summary, I felt the pizza was a major let down. I think it should have been cooked longer and I agree with another reviewer that if they worked on the crust, JVG's pizza would be amazing!! The toppings were excellent! Would I return? I think I would. As I stated above, they offer a multitude of dishes, and I'd be willing to try some of them. I'm seeing from the Yelp reviews that they make a mean cheese steak! Wouldn't mind trying it.",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,0,0,3,3_qdaZOHwlaMZAosUgqpAw

It seemed to be a typical All-American burger joint/bar food type of place but the exceptional reviews for the fried mushrooms and loaded fries intrigued me. We ordered the chicken ranch fries, philly cheesesteak sandwich (with onion and mushrooms), fried mushrooms, crispy chicken salad, and a side of hot BBQ sauce. We received our order quicker than I expected from a very friendly fellow. We found the chicken ranch fries to be phenomenal and can understand the great reviews. Also, the fried mushrooms were absolutely fantastic with the homemade sauce which was very good on its own. The philly cheesesteak was okay. It was hot and edible but nothing special. The same can be said about the crispy chicken salad as it was a little bit of chicken with a whole lot of lettuce. The hot BBQ sauce as a salad dressing was the only saving grace for the salad. Overall, Johnny's Grill is worth it for the loaded fries and fried mushrooms if you want quick food and delivery. It definitely fit with the previous reviews and I would recommend Johnny's.",jfUVDLdFOOj9dJ08USqcLg,0,0,4,dEdipIzJoWoCxsaM_Nctbg

This creation is comprised of a large, folded, griddle-cooked tortilla packed with cheese, sauce, and your favorite pizza toppings!

The pizza-dilla is a messy meal, and not a healthy one either. But if you're in a junk food mood or can't decide between contrasting cravings, it's a solid option. The supreme version has peppers, onions, olives, sausage, and pepperoni. The plain pepperoni version is a great classic choice that takes me back to childhood kitchen experiments.

Late night cravings started to call my name and this location was one of the very few places open super late at night near my area. I ordered take out and had my boyfriend pick it up because their delivery service was down due to their employee calling out sick. That didn't matter too much because we don't live far and I wasn't driving, lol. Anyway, I ordered their regular Philly Cheesesteak and a side of fries. Let me tell you, I enjoyed this sandwich more than I did an actual Philly cheesesteak from Philly that I had last year. The fries were delicious and the sauce that came with the sandwich was amazing. I would say that the sauce is what elevated the meal for me and made me love it. Had I known their sauce would be that good, I would have ordered an entire bottle (if they offered it that way). The sandwich itself was nothing short of tasty; everything was prepared beautifully and the bread was not soggy or anything.

If I could change one thing it would be that this place was a stand alone store/restaurant. It gets a little confusing because it's in a bar but nonetheless it is good food. I can't wait to try other sandwiches and snacks there.

The mac and cheese bites are hot, perfectly crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside. Even the pasta on the inside is cooked perfectly.

2298055,2017-04-27,0,GpzQY2XLo5A35Cf8-Mjazg,"The people here are the best. Let's start with that. I was stuck waiting at the DMV and really wanted a slice of pizza. I Yelped and saw this place Johnny Vegas wasn't too far. It had some crazy food combinations, like the Philly Fries and the Pizza-dilla. I couldn't pass those up so I ordered both. I called in to place a pickup order, and besides not saying his name, the gentleman was very helpful and polite. Before I arrived, Taryn (I think that's how you spell it) called and told me my food was ready and how to get there, because they were inside of a bar and their sign had blown off.  They don't have a lot of space inside, but it works. It's not in a great neighborhood, and you can't bring your kids in. Sorry. 

Taryn was expecting me and greeted me by name.  I paid and we made small talk. She offered different suggestions to other things on the menu. I noticed something wrong on my order but they quickly took care of it. While I waited I ate the pizza-dilla. Kinda greasy, super cheesy and decent. 8/10. It would've been better with something more than just cheese. While I was eating, the delivery driver came in, stayed for a second, and left. On his way out, he smiled and spoke to me.  Ok why is everyone so nice... 

Taryn seemed to be training someone (he was also nice, aware a patron was in his establishment; a novel idea these days), and you could tell she took pride in teaching and just being there in general. She was very engaging and has such a great smile! Basically... she was amazing. My new order came out. Before I left we talked a little more. I was just so impressed. 

I tried the Philly fries back at the DMV. First thought... Damn this is a small portion. I guess I was used to the massive loads you get from Robertos. Didn't matter, I didn't finish it either way, SMH. 9/10. I think I would like it better if the fries weren't seasoned. It kinda clashes with the great seasoning of the steak. Plain fries I think would be a 10.. I like the ideas they have, and being from the east coast, not too far from Philly, I looooove Philly Cheesesteaks. I would like to try other things on their menu.  But their service was a 100/10. That's not a typo. They're all that good. I don't live on this side but would consider driving over to eat and chill. I might seriously start doing that.

Taryn, thanks for being a highlight in my day!",xmtWxX67wF7afssQRcVqiw,2,0,5,-Y9K41MnGSyWZZUb9_zjGg

One pizza and one order of 5 chicken fingers cost us $38. We ordered and paid for bacon as an extra topping and it was no where to be found on our pizza. The pizza dough was way too soft it fell apart and there was just way too much tomato sauce that it was the only thing you could taste.

In terms of food, I can't even believe it was still hot and good by the time I got it! (Due to my own fault, lol) but even the sauce...the SAUCE was hot. Not just warm, but HOT.

I ordered a veggie pizza for delivery. Upon first glace I could tell that the cooks do not care about the dishes they put out. The toppings are lazily piled in the center of the pizza with an after thought of cheese ""layered"" on top. The pizza is cooked at too high a temperature. I could tell because the edges are burnt while the center of the pizza was completely raw. On top of this, it is obvious that whoever prepared the menu does not understand the ingredients they are working with. The toppings on their veggie pizza all release water and when I received my pizza it was wet from the run off of the cooked out water.

Seriously, once I laid my hungry eyes upon your layers of bacon, melted cheddar cheese, and drizzled garlic mayo and cilantro herb seasoning, I knew my plans for a healthy diet would not last (at least for that day).   

I first had these fries when my coworkers ordered for delivery.  The following week I ventured to get some of them on my own.  It turned out to be a little section within a bar/pub.  It's more of a delivery or take out place for this reason unless you want to sit at the one tiny table in the corner of the pub.  Oddly, there's also a $1 take-out fee.

Since then, I've actually ordered from Johnny Vegas Grill multiple times while at work for all my co-workers.  We've tried so much from their menu and the majority have been a huge hit with the staff here at Desert Springs Hospital.  

Some things I'd suggest to try out:  Pizza quesadillas, fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers w/ cream cheese filling, Italian philly, delicious fish tacos (spicy), and of course their Johnny Vegas Fries.  

They also sell candy like Caramel Apple Pops and Twix here!

Their food is exceptionally good and they truly appreciate their customers.  The last time we ordered from them they threw in a free slice of cheesecake with a personalized 'thank you' message.   It was delicious and now is also on our must order list.   JVG has become our #1 go to spot for late night food delivery and we'll be ordering from them time and time again.

He said he would call right back. Ten minutes went by and we called again and he said he was shocked the guy still hadn't arrived. He offered me $10 off my next order and said he couldn't do anything on this order. 

The delivery guy finally showed up and blamed the guy at the store for misquoting the delivery time. 

We order finger with buffalo sauce. The fingers were ok but the buffalo sauce was awful. It was like butter and tabasco mixed together.

Over all I will be ordering from here again but will probably stick the burger and fries ! I also tried their coleslaw on the side and it wasn't bad.",ujHjmh1AuweIldJKusI6AA,0,0,4,RFB6jz8USaSRtVG3-eZv-g
2757809,2018-03-27,0,GpzQY2XLo5A35Cf8-Mjazg,"Update:  Five Stars.  I'm really struggling to remember why I ever gave them four instead of five.

Nonetheless -- since my original reviews, I've ordered from JVG (as I like to abbreviate them) four or five times.  We've tried a selection of their specialty fries and sandwiches and have NEVER been disappointed.  Tonight I ordered their March Madness special (as listed on their Facebook page) and was so happy.  We got a philly cheesesteak sandwich, the chicken ranch fries, fried mushrooms, and a 2L of diet coke.  It was more than enough to feed the two of us with some leftovers to spare.  

We've only ever done delivery, largely because it's consistent and delicious.  My husband feels like he has a ""relationship"" with the driver at this point, which is a sign of a good local business.  The food is great - we've tried a pretty broad selection and have never had complaints.  It always comes hot and fresh, and reheats pretty well (see my below hash suggestion).  We will certainly continue to order from the JVG.  :)",utS9ZAswZZx3QkegS_25SA,1,0,5,wR-qvmbwx9XwJxtucmC9vQ

2839709,2018-01-24,2,GpzQY2XLo5A35Cf8-Mjazg,"Whilst looking up ""Best Chicken Salad"" I stumbled across Johnny Vegas Grill. I told my buddy in food eating shenanigans, Malinda, about this place as we are always on the hunt to taste and judge supposedly the ""best"". I didn't care for the idea of a chicken salad, but I saw reviews on the burgers and it became top priority on my food eating agenda.

We drove out of our way to Desert Inn and Sandhill, which was my old neighborhood growing up. George E. Harris Elementary School!
That brought back so many memories, I was looking forward to a Vegas style treat. I'm all about Old Vegas!
She had visited the day before based on the reviews and really couldn't wait. 
She came back to me and said the staff was amazing and the place was ""the size of a stamp"". I said, ""It couldn't be that small, it had a pool table"".

When entering, it reminded me of a Vegas bar from the 80'S = perfect!
The ""grill"" is in the back right corner upon entering; you're basically ordering at a door. I'm not pretentious and I don't expect the Ritz-Carlton. In fact, I prefer more down-home and less fancy-schmancy.
The venue was NOT the size of a stamp, it was in a bar with plenty of room for a mechanical bull if they wanted one in there.
We came up to the door, and were greeted with a smile - which is always a great way to start a meal.

Ordering was easy, we were given all the options for toppings on our burger. I asked for some coleslaw on the side so I can put it on my burger, I highly recommend that!!!

We chose to dine in, you do have to get your drinks at the bar even if it's a soda.
I didn't mind that, I'll leave a review for the bar itself.
We chose to sit at a booth seat, low and behold they didn't call for us to come and get our food, they brought it out. 

Now that's what I'm talking about, old Vegas service!

Let me get into this food situation:

The wait was average, not too long, and long enough for me to order my drink which means it was not a heat lamp Burger.
The burger was THE BOMB = juicy, full of flavor = exactly the way I wanted it. It had all the fixin's, however I forgot to ask for onions. I politely requested them, they were brought to me promptly. Nice!
The fries were Finger Licking Good = nuff said.
My friend ordered the chili fries, it was a tidy tastefull mess = how chili fries should be.

I enjoyed every minute and every bite of my meal, which is exactly why I went clear out of my way driving from Henderson just for this burger.

I decided on my way out, I definitely need a Johnny Vegas hat. I'm an avid hat collector, so I have to figure out how I'm going to get a hat.

Some might complain smoking is allowed in the bar, which would bother them while they're eating their food, however I'm not a douchebag - it's an old Vegas bar and exactly what I expected.

I would definitely eat here again, worth the drive.

REASONS TO VISIT JOHNNY VEGAS GRILL:
1. Parking Lot
2. Reasonable Prices
3. Friendly Service
4. Great Food, especially the burger. 
5. Take-Out
6. Dine-In

I ordered the fried mushrooms and philly fries..

I intended to share the fried mushrooms, but that certainly did not happen. I am thankful for fresh mushrooms and tasty breading. Definitely not the overly frozen stuff that I'm used to. 

The philly fries were great - lots of meat and the flavor was delicious!

To top it all off - the gentleman who delivered my meal had excellent customer service and was very thankful when I handed him a tip. (you don't see that very often anymore).

We started out with the fried ravioli which were delicious (and I ate most of them, LOL!). The cook might want to consider adding a sprinkling of parmesan cheese before sending them out to the table, but they were great otherwise. 
My husband had the chicken sandwich, which he thoroughly enjoyed... And I had the two ton pizza quesadilla.  (A PIZZA quesadilla? WTF?). 
I had my doubts about the concept - but once I got my first bite, OHHHHHH BOY was I hooked!!

Honestly, I love greasy heart attack food.  Johnny Vegas Grill is just the place for that.  My bestie and I were both just in the mood to stuff our faces and have no regrets!  This place was pretty close to work so we decided to check it out.  We ended up getting SO much food.  We split a burger and got a bunch of apps, including: cheese curds, olive poppers, mozzarella sticks, and boneless wings.  

For the most part, the food was great.  Some of it could have used a little more flavor, but overall I was pleased.  

The only reason they lost a star was for service.  My friend and I were intrigued by the pizza quesadilla and we ended never getting to try it.  They completely forgot it was on our ticket and we never got it.  It ended up being on our check... which we of course got it taken off.  Also, I'm not sure if they solved this problem since we were last there, but their prices on the menu didn't match the prices in their computers that they actually charge.  The prices were higher in the computer by anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar.  I know a lot of these are service no-nos, but my reviews are heavily reliant on the food and the food didn't disappoint.

Unfortunately I don't have much to say about the quality of the food because I never got to try it. I had noticed my order for delivery was running a bit late so I called to see if they had forgotten about it or what have you, turns out they delivered my order of a pizza and the specialty fries to my neighbor. They also didn't care to send over a new order or refund my original order at all(paid online with a card). So I'm out 31 bucks. 
The reviews concerning the food seem to be good, just beware of their customer service.



Update: About an hour after posting this review I got a response on here as well as a voicemail from JVG, they seem to now care about helping me with this issue after I've posted it on yelp. Unfortunately when I initially called they didn't care as much. To be honest I don't care if grub hub or JVG made the error, The point of this review is to highlight the customer service of this establishment. The issue is I got zero help when I called JVG about this when it initially happened before I posted about it on yelp. An obvious attempt to save face.

They deliver well, quickly, and tend to follow any special requests with a high accuracy. Plus, with a $15 minimum, the delivery itself is actually free. I am always impressed with how they handle orders that often need to be split up amongst my multiple coworkers in different containers with the food arriving as requested and in perfect condition. I will say, however, that they are a bit stingy with their condiments, as in even if you order a ton of food you may only get four packets of ketchup. 
The food is pretty typical of it's kind, greasy and delicious. Their Vegas Fries in particular are the favorite of my workplace, and I personally love their Pizza Quesadillas - though I would like them even more if they came with marinara or something to dip it in.

Their staff is absolutely stellar. My cat likes to try to dash out the door, so I leave a note to that effect. Every single time I've had delivery through JVB, the delivery guy was braced to catch the cat if he made it out before I shut the door (one even helped me catch him when the cat slipped past us both).

The year I spent on the Eastside was peppered with break-ins, apartment troubles, getting towed from my own parking spot, and even a stalking incident. The only reason I'm sorry to be leaving this hell-hole is that I won't be in delivery range for this place anymore.

ORDERED pick up via EAT24 and used my weekend coupon save $2. Benefit from the coupon, that's when you add the stars like bacon, sauce, etc, etc 

ORDER WAS READY 20mins, also the restaurant calls to confirm your online order and calls again when your order is ready.

I ordered Mr. G's Burger w/ onion rings: cooked med well w/ lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, cheese and thousand island dressing. I added bacon to mines, totally worth it.(Bacon is extra) Nice hand pressed patty, cooked on a grill top, super juicey. They know how to make a burger at this place, not over cooked, burger falls apart, very little pink just how I like.  Very reminiscent of my grandfather's homemade burgers, a very simple recipe with fresh ingredients and seasoned well. I'm all about fresh ingredients, it makes the food that much better.

Driver was friendly and offered packets of cheese and hot peppers.  Each pizza had plenty of toppings and cheese and each were cooked through nicely.
I would say the only negative and reason it didn't get the fifth star is for the extra crust around the outside of the pizzas.  The main part of the crust was thin and cooked just right but the full 1 inch of hard crust around the outside would have been better served with at least some sauce and cheese.  I realize you don't want too much on the outside because you wouldn't be able to handle a piece but this was just a little too much wasted.  I'm probably nit-picking here.

Just so you know, this place is actually in a bar card Mr. G's and it is leased out of it like a lot of pizza places do, so don't bring the kids or expect the traditional restaurant experience. It's either eat at the bar or take it to go.

The staff was friendly and the lady at the counter helped us order. She said the most popular things are the Johnny fries, Philly Cheesesteak and the pizza quesadillas, so that's what we got.

The Philly was a little disappointing, only in that there was nothing really special about it. I've had better and had worse, and it was about as middle of the road and plain as a Philly can get. Considering it doesn't even come with fries I would not order it again or recommend it.

The Johnny fries are fries topped with bacon and their garlic mayo. They were delicious, but the amount of fries they came with seemed a little light of a serving. I mentioned this on the way out and the staff said we can ask for extra fries for a small upcharge, which we would do if we ever ordered this again.

The best think was the pizza quesadilla. I cant remember the name of the specific one we ordered but it was the one with pepperoni and sausage. I really enjoyed this and would come back for it. The Quesadilla was cooked nice and crispy on the outside and was stuffed with cheese and meat. It tasted great and the serving size was decent for the price.

Also the bar itself had some decent priced beer specials, so have a beer while you wait and another while you eat. If your in the area and feel like some good bar food, I would check this place out.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,4,WSQYEP1HzRSgZfNkI22z-A
