So I sat there waiting a good half hour while a nervous waiter was busy doing his opening chores being completely ignored. This went on for more than a half hour and I finally asked where my order was and was rudely told by the guy with a foreign accent "" I didnt take this order"""" and promptly walked away! I showed him my reciept (which I paid for already at the bar with ""Mr Charming""). Which rude waiter took with no apology whatsoever . Apparently ""Mr Charming"" forgot to tell ""Snotty guy"" I had ordered thier over priced muffin breakfasts and coffee earlier. 
  After ANOTHER 20 minutes STILL nothing..not a fork, not a spoon not a ""hey would like some coffee?""I had better service in a Burger King. I did something I have NEVER done before..I walked out! Save your money on the hospitality of Vegas other great fine dining experiences. And to the snotty waiter..Im a great tipper and I may also suggest you go into something other than the public sector as a career. I will NEVER go back to this establishment (nor my friends if I can help it).",kEfuEfmdbMSsaznkq6O7jg,0,0,1,Lf-Kl0TgwWvAZ5MF1apxYA

Also, this place serves way more than pizza, so I'm not sure why this is listed under 'pizza'?",e5n-s1OhaqXP9siQ6dNm0A,2,1,4,DBuztxZlkLdvrRLmUztB-w

My older Son held his Wedding Ceremony here. After they had already booked the place, the Bride's Mother, the Bride, and myself, thought it would be a good idea to ""sample"" the food.

We were given ""samples"" of filet, fish, and pork. The appetizer samples tasted good.

Problem, at the wedding, the dinner plate was composed of sample sizes! The food was cold. What was supposed to be a Crab Cake, turned out to be a small crab salad, with a sprinkling of fake crab. 

The 6 ounce steak, was the size of about 3-4 ounces. All were precooked, and served cold. The mashed potatoes side was little more than a table spoon. Everyone left the wedding hungry. 

The room was very small. We had my wedding at Del Frisco's, and our room given as a comp, was twice the size for half the people. 

The cost for my wedding, with far superior, made to order food, and a full open bar was about $90 per per person.  My son's which had ""Airline"" food, and limited drinks, cost $140 per person. 

This place is known as an after hours place, that crawls with hookers, and druggies. In the summer, it is renown for it's topless pool and hip hop DJs. 

This is not a place to go for a good meal and ""fine dining"", and certainly, not a wedding.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,0,0,1,SMDUpabukTshgOaXGL5IDQ
