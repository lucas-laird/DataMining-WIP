20923,2017-11-14,0,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,This place has a great location but unfortunately the food is way over priced and they charge and undisclosed resort fee of 5% aka CNF fee on your check. I'm a Vegas local that eats out daily and Ordred the carne asada for $23. I received 4 small pieces of meat and two tortillas some guacamole. Javiers across the street at aria has much better food and bigger portions for the same price. The extra fee they charge is ridiculous. No other restaurants on the strip add it and the bartender had no explanation as to why it's there or what other value the customer receives because of it. If we hadn't asked she would not have disclosed it.,MAfU2TiU5pB4daGAXZK4iA,2,0,1,RgzFFKuO8-2C7QJ6LULMhA

40960,2016-09-22,0,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,"Der Beer Park befindet sich direkt am Paris Hotel & Casino - über dem Hexx. Man nimmt entweder außen die Treppe nach oben oder innen den Aufzug.

Wir waren am frühen Mittag (direkt zur Öffnung) dort. Die Bedienung (und auch das Personal am Empfang) hatte es wohl gar nicht eilig - wir mussten nämlich ziemlich warten. Es lief zwar viel Personal herum, z.B. um die Tische mit Soßenträgern einzudecken, aber wir wurden zunächst ignoriert - obwohl noch gar keine anderen Gäste da waren.
Wir bekamen dann einen Tisch zugewiesen und nach einer Weile kam dann tatsächlich auch eine Bedienung an unseren Tisch. Von da an gab es ""personaltechnisch"" nichts mehr zu meckern, denn unsere Bedienung war sehr nett und aufmerksam. Wir hatten einen Burger, einen Caesars Salat und ein Spezial-Angebot mit Brisket.
Anfangs saßen wir noch im Schatten, später wanderte dieser, so dass wir halb in der Sonne saßen. Tipp: Bei heißen Sonnenwetter möglichst nah am Gebäude und nicht zur Straße hin sitzen. 
Zur Kühlung wurde dann die Wasserdampfanlage angemacht - ich persönlich hasse diese Dinger, die es leider inzwischen an fast jeder Ecke am Strip gibt - aber das ist wohl Geschmackssache. Zum Glück haben wir davon an unserem Tisch nur wenig abbekommen. 

Wie man sich schon beim Namen denken kann - ist die Hauptspezialität vom Beer Park Bier. Auch wenn der ganze Laden mit Budweiser gebrandet ist, bekommt hier Biersorten aus aller Welt (auch aus Deutschland). 
Tipp: An der Theke kann man kostenlos einzelne Biersorten probieren - einfach nachfragen. Wir haben so jedenfalls eine neue leckere Biersorte gefunden (zufälligerweise sogar aus Las Vegas).

Das Essen kam im normalen Zeitrahmen. Wichtig ist: Wie schon erwähnt, sind Biere die Hauptspezialität - den Speisen kommt hier nur eine Nebenrolle zu.  Sie werden so serviert, dass man sie am Tisch mit allen teilen kann und es gibt wohl nur Plastikgeschirr.
Der Burger war saftig und mittelmäßig lecker - völlig okay, aber nichts besonderes. Für den Preis auf jeden Fall zu teuer.
Der Caesars Salat war lecker, allerdings mit zu wenig Dressing - ebenfalls zu teuer für den Preis.
Das Brisket-Spezial war lecker und wirklich reichlich - der Preis war angemessen.
Das Bier - sehr lecker - unverschämt teuer - ein Glas für 11$.

Der Ausblick auf den Strip geht auf die gegenüberliegenen Hotels. Die Fontänen vom Bellagio kann man nur sehen, wenn man sich ganz aussen an die Geländertische setzt - dann sitzt man tagsüber allerdings in der prallen Sonne.
Man kann hier viele Spiele spielen, die überall verteilt sind (z.B. Tischkicker, Jenga usw.). Außerdem - wie üblich in den meisten Bars/Restaurants - gibt es einige Fernseher - meist mit Sportsendungen. 

Wir hatten hier einen Groupon-Gutschein (16$ bezahlt für 40$-Wert an Speisen & Getränken). Es gab keine Probleme bei der Einlösung.
Nun zur Rechnung ... Es gibt in Las Vegas eine Handvoll Läden, die nehmen unverschämterweise eine ""Concession Fee"" in Höhe von 4,7%. Es wird zwar auf der Karte darauf hingewiesen - aber ziemlich klein in einer Ecke. Okay, wir wussten das vorher und hatten ja außerdem eine gute Ersparnis durch den Groupon-Gutschein. Trotzdem empfinden wir diese ""Concession Fee"" als unverschämt, vor allem, da die Preise hier eh schon gesalzen sind.

Fazit: Wir würden hier nicht mehr hingehen. Wir fanden das Essen als zu teuer - und nur zum Biertrinken ist es erst recht viel zu teuer.",nhASzYdqRwYiUgASyMVKUw,3,0,2,PHZxoyq-kINUlDQJw8Llsw

There are tons of TVs to watch football on; when I booked I was asked what game I wanted to watch. I had to change my reservation a few times and there was no problem with this and my table was still ready when I arrived.

The place has a fun atmosphere, there were people watching the football game while others were enjoying playing the games at their tables such as Jenga and Connect Four.

Menu had the usual sports bar selection of food. My BBQ Chicken Cobb Salad was a good size and tasted good. Was disappointed to hear they had run out of all their cocktails on draft when I went to order one. Also when we received the bill I discovered that they have a CNF charge that is known as the ""Concession and Franchise Fee."" That was an extra charge on our bill we weren't aware was going to be there. I think it's on really small print on their menu!

1265282,2016-06-26,3,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,"Beer Park is a must go in Vegas.

Once you see the giant sign stating ""Beer Park"" leading you through the entrance, you know you have arrived. You walk up the flight of stairs where you find yourself at the hostess stand. All of the hostess' are exceptionally nice and treat you like they've known you forever.

Beer Park is explained through the name. The layout is literally a beer park. It is outside with a view looking over the strip. It kinda reminds me of a baseball field. Green grass, picnic tables, red solo cups, and plates designed to look like a paper plate. Love the atmosphere.
Beer park has picnic tables, two bars, and stool seating looking over the strip along the side of the restaurant.

They also have drinking game for anyone to play. They have a beer pong table, life sized connect four, life size jenga, and much more. 

The bar is non-smoking so if you want to smoke you have to go sit on the stairs in the back where the exit is supposed to be OR you have to go all the way downstairs and smoke near the entrance.

The servers here are also really nice. They don't hesitate to make sure you have everything you need plus more. They definitely know how to take care of their customers here. 

For my first refreshing drink in Vegas I really was craving an ice cold beer. So, what better place to begin than Beer Park.

I ordered the Shock Top (apple wheat); I have to say it hit the spot. Cold, fruity, refreshing. Great pick me up from the treacherous, 120 degree humid weather. 

Too top it off my friend and I decided to share 2 appetizers.
We ordered the Buffalo Onion Rings and the Loaded Tator Tots.

The Buffalo Onion Rings are beer battered onion rings served with blue cheese and hot sauce. I wasn't a big fan of the hot sauce they serve them with but the onion rings go really well with the barbeque sauce they have on the tables. I really liked this appetizer because the onion rings weren't drowned in the fried breading and actually had a thick onion in each.

The Loaded Tator Tots are tator tots dressed with bacon bits, sour cream, Bass IPA cheese sauce, and chives. YUM. That's all I need to say. The portion size was perfect, just enough to share comfortably with two people. 

The atmosphere, layout of the restaurant, service, and food will keep me coming back for more. If only they had a Beer Park in Maryland then my problems would be solved. Until next time Beer Park. ;)",kBJ479cSD071LhulSSaNWw,5,3,5,uOzq3T5cxqwTBfT_6NEmJQ

I should have known, in Vegas, that it would be sponsored by a huge corporate entity like Budweiser. I still gave it a try because I enjoy Goose Island and some of the other breweries Bud has purchased. 

On the up side, the beer was reasonably priced (around $8 for a 16 oz) and our server was extremely sweet and attentive. Waters were always refilled on a hot LV afternoon, and she had a great sense of humor. 

Sadly, the hot pretzel I had here was probably the worst one I've ever had. It tasted like deep-fried bland dough. Not flaky and salty like a pretzel should be. My friend ate the cheese it was served with and commented about the weird film the cheese had on top. 

I love the idea of this place, but I'd only return if I couldn't find any other options with more beer. Having 20-30 beers on your menu isn't very impressive in an age where brewpubs have 100+ taps.",H1lhB-gCSbdtblglfVysag,2,0,3,z-dqTMydccBSIzSc4qWjPw

Beer Park is centrally located (directly across from the Bellagio Fountains) with a stellar view and plenty of games to choose from if you're not indulging in the insane selection of beers and tasty bar bites. 

Anytime I have beer enthusiasts inquiring about where to go on the strip, I have usually directed them to Yard House but Beer Park has been my new go-to. Located in front of Paris hotel, Beer Park is a few quick hops up some stairs to a great Sunday Funday location. You can check in with the hostesses to get games (they have Shuffle Board, (used to have) Pool (maybe it'll be back in the warmer months?), Jenga and connect four, just to name a few. You can enjoy an insane selection of beer (I reccomend the Apolocolypse line) and some bar bites while playing the games or watching whatever sports are on - this place has plenty of TVs on location.

I will say that the food we had was not bad, but it wasn't the best bar food. I had ordered the chicken drums thinking they'd be smaller wing sized but they were three ""medium"" sized chicken drums. They were alright...something was weird about the taste that I didn't finish them... but then again, I had been drinking all day so it really could have just been me. 

Beer Park is definitely worth a visit if you're on the Las Vegas Strip in search of something fun and casual to do. :)

Good choice of craft beers, lots of Jenga games, pool tables, beer pong, lots of tv's for viewing sports, and table soccer games. You can sit at the end and look down onto the strip and people and car watch.

My only -1 star is because it's the strip. The price of beers are like mlb baseball prices. A 32oz glass will cost you from $13-15 bucks depending on what beer you order. The 16oz is cheaper pending on the 

The food menu is decent. I only had the blue cheese burger and tator tots. Both were good but not great. I don't know how the other foods are but I was told by the bar tender that all the burgers were good and the tator tots. 

I would definitely come back again. The best time to come during the hot summer days is at night from 7:30 pm on. The best times are Friday and Saturday night because they open till 2am. The rest of the days they close at 11pm.

My boyfriend recently got his new California Driver License, and the format has changed. It looks completely different! 

He approached this particular bartender for a drink, and when she seen his identification, she said, ""she could call the cops for presenting fraudulent identification."" She was really serious!!! Instead of that bartender asking management if it was a legitimate, she automatically assumed it was fake, and made a very ignorant remark. 

My boyfriend felt extremely discriminated , and told the bartender to call the cops so they could train her on government issued ID's. She felt really stupid after he told her that, and decided to call her manager. She said, ""she was just kidding""! She was being serious, and was not joking! Even if she was joking that was not funny. No one feels like laughing after someone tells them they are going to call the police on them. Especially for getting a drink.(FYI...My boyfriend was sober,and was getting a drink for me.)

When the manager came over. He showed no sign of sympathy over the situation. He said they had the right to refuse to service to anyone. He didn't apologize or make any attempt.  We agreed with the manager  about refusing service when it's just. It was not our fault they were ignorant with California ID's updates. We  suggested his staff get better training. Especially on government issued identifications. They also need to keep updated with any current updates on government  issued ID's. A bartenders jobs is not that hard. ID someone, charge, and pour...

It's unfortunate that the lack of staff training is making this facility loose patrons. Ignorance does not make it okay for them to discriminate and act unkindly. Especially after we had spend more than $500 on food and drinks.",ZhmOZaS1HQkaUutfl3pntw,2,0,1,LSljnFmYBymwH50RA6ukFg

Being the football fan that I am and finally gaining the courage to make a few sports bets, my stepdad and I decided to go off MGM property to watch the game (since the sports bar and sports book in the casinos don't serve food...I mean, how can you watch sports without food??)

Amazingly, it wasn't crowded at all, especially considering the number of games on. 

It's upstairs, near Paris. It's like an outdoor mancave!! Sparkly green turf covered the floor, TVs every direction you look, built in heaters, picnic-style tables with board games galore and a hidden receptacle for bottled beverages! The whole thing is outdoors so dress accordingly, but do remember they have heaters :-)

Ladies, there are even purse rings to hang your purse at the end of each table! They have a life-size Jenga, Connect Four, and other fun games that adults would love to partake in!!

We were only craving appetizers since were going to eat dinner after the game. My stepdad got the 7-Layer Dip and I got the Guacamole. Our server said all the appetizers were shareable...see pictures. That guac was not only NOT shareable, but hard to eat out of that tiny container. But it WAS good. I can't wait to go back and try their real food!! Those waffle fries are calling my name...

They serve you with what LOOKS like plastic red SOLO cups and paper plates but...SURPRISE!!! They're actually ceramic or something!! Way cool.  My only real complaint is that our server refilled my stepdad' s beer 3 times but never refilled my soda. I actually had to call her over and ask, even though every time she visited our table my cup was most obviously empty. I get it, free refills don't earn the money.

You can take awesome pics of the strip in either direction.  It's just a really neat place, my new favorite in Vegas :-)

We normally sit at the ledge area over looking the strip and fountain. People watching is the best. Some of the things you see on the strip is crazy. If it gets to hot, just move toward the bar area, there's communal seating with fans and mister going to cool you off. They have the classic games, jumbo jenga, connect four. 

But let's get to the point, they have tater tots. I mean come on, how can you go wrong with tater tots. The food menu is great, not a fancy foo foo menu. Straight to the point of burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches. Bings that go great with beer on a hot summer afternoon. Also, the music selection is great.

Giant Jenga and checkers games, pool and shuffleboard tables make it a fun time, and there's also a view of the Bellagio fountain show. Toss in 30+ HD TV screens, making it a great place to watch a game. It's like a backyard party on steroids, in the best way.

Menu features shareable apps (mostly fried stuff), burgers and sausages- the buffalo onion rings($8, huge portion) and garlic fries ($8, served with black pepper baconnaise) were both pretty solid, the guys liked their burgers ($11), and the Shock Top Sausage ($14) was surprisingly flavorful. In two hours, we went through a couple of pitchers, and those added up fast. The food was pretty well priced for a Strip location. Before we left, my friends were already talking about when they'd be back.

TIPS: 
*You can only enter from LV Blvd, so from the Paris casino floor, exit by Hexx and the entrance around the corner. 
*You get the shuffleboard pucks from the hostess, who will require your ID.

Okay so to find this place was a chore too, but basically you climb up the stairs on the right corner of the Paris Casino.There you can pick to sit at the couches or the tables. Obviously being comfort over food we chose couches for a large group. 

Location was pretty cool being near the Bellagio and under Paris, I'll give them that. The cool air blowing in the outdoors was nice as well. The aesthetics were pleasing with the grass and woody feel to much of the tables, so I enjoyed that part.

However when it came to order beers they were ""out."" Never had I thought a beer place would not have pretty much anything I selected on their menu. IPAs of all things too. So disappointing. I had to just go with some wine since no one drinks that anyways. I didn't want canned beer when they can pour out of tap. This was just embarrassing on Beer Garden's part.

1942060,2018-02-06,10,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,"Las Vegas usually conjures up thoughts of partying poolside by day and clubbing late into the night, and while I love to travel, neither of the aforementioned activities are really things I'm interested in. So, the fact that this lovely outdoor beer garden overlooking the Strip and facing the gorgeous Bellagio fountains was right outside our hotel, I was thrilled. 

AMBIENCE: This trip was meant to celebrate my sister's 21st birthday, and she's a lot like me: she's not very much into clubbing, but loves to drink and sight-see. After a long day of walking around and swimming in the Nevada heat, we came here on a Tuesday night around 9 pm. There were a lot of people, but we easily found a spot exactly where we hoped we would, facing the Bellagio fountains. It was dark and... maybe the beer helped... but one of the most gorgeous views I've ever had while drinking. 

STAFF: Our waitress was very relaxed and answered whatever questions we had about our beer, because again, it was my sister's first few days being able to drink legally, so she had a few questions! 

PRICES: The beer was a little more expensive than I would've liked, but it's on par with what I expected when it came to buying alcohol in Las Vegas. Probably $7-8 for a Blue Moon, but it was vacation, so I'm not furious. Makes sense!

Overall, if you want a casual spot to drink a beer while overlooking one of the most famous streets in the country, Beer Park is a low-key, enjoyable spot for just that.",vTTd3ZT34-7pkxpW1zmVIw,25,18,4,w9FwkmSgviyoA9NZeHP78A

However, the service is actual crap. A big steaming pile of it. 

I think just for us to get one beer while sitting AT THE BAR took a good 15 minutes after placing our order. Then we got to wait another 20 for a water that I asked for and for our food orders to be taken. Mind you, the bar itself had maybe 7 people sitting at it. Additionally, when I told the waitress I just wanted a Coors Light (please, don't give me shit - let's save that for another time. I know it's piss water), she looked at me and smirked and goes, ""Okay. Well. We don't have that, so. We have Bud Light."" Okay, GIRL, there are about a million other NICE WAYS you could've worded that. Nobody asked for your smirk or attitude around here, so I don't know who you're talking to with that tone. 

I digress.

I wasn't too hungry when we came here but I knew I needed to eat something. So, I ordered the appetizer guacamole & chips. Their guacamole is pretty solid, but definitely could use a little bit more salt. Whatever they season their chips with is FIRE. Seriously so good. Takes a regular old tortilla chip and brings it to LIFE. 

One thing about Beer Park that really stands out is the view. The view from the rooftop is spectacular, especially at night. Also, they allow minors and there are different games located on the rooftop for people to play with (foosball, giant Jenga, giant Connect 4, etc.). 

In the end, it was about $112 before tip for 5 beers and 4 meals. Not too shabby in my opinion - but you'll have to brave the service.",lrSlArehU8XqQlRNPQ7dbQ,5,1,3,XQGiNAM2y03EQSljTibNBg

How to get there: The bar is located outside on the second floor at the Paris hotel. There is a set of stairs outside near the Paris valet circle/front entrance on the sidewalk near LVB. You'll see an archway to the Beer Park, go under the arch and up the stairs, where you'll find the park. There's also an elevator, which I believe you need to access inside of the casino. 


The beer: This is the BUDWEISER beer park. They have plenty of beers on tap, but don't expect local microbrews, coors light, or any of Budweiser's big competition. You can scroll through the pics others have posted of the menu for a grasp of the beer offerings. They also offer mixed drinks & some bottled beers. Although nobody in our group was partaking in the mixed drinks, I watched the bartenders mix quite a few. They didn't appear to be heavy on the pour, but they weren't skimping either. 

The atmosphere: We were here on a Saturday around 10pm and this place was happening. It was a good time, and I had a hard time wanting to leave. There was a DJ going, people playing Jenga, a connect four game, people dancing, etc. There are two round bars upstairs right next to each other, picnic tables, bar stools having LVB. While we were there, there were plenty of people, but you could still find a place to sit. 

The service: The bartenders were fast making drinks, trying to serve everyone, but there was a bit of an attitude from one. Particularly when I tried to order a Coors Light and was reminded how this is a Bud bar.  We never actually saw a food or bar menu, so without looking at the taps I didn't know what was offered. Also, we were skipped a couple of times to others who had walked up after we'd already been waiting. It was probably a busy night for them, so the mediocre service is being overlooked a bit in this 5 star rating.

2050866,2016-09-24,1,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,"Der Beer Park befindet sich direkt am Paris Hotel & Casino. Man nimmt entweder außen die Treppe nach oben oder innen den Aufzug.

Wir waren am frühen Mittag direkt zur Öffnung dort. Die Bedienung hatte es überhaupt nicht eilig - wir mussten ziemlich lang warten. Es lief zwar viel Personal rum, z.B., um die Tische mit Speisekarten, Salz, Pfeffer und Mayo einzudecken, aber wir wurden zunächst ignoriert - obwohl noch gar keine anderen Gäste da waren. Die ganze Zeit lief laute Rockmusik.

Wir bekamen dann einen Tisch zugewiesen und nach einer Weile kam dann tatsächlich auch eine Bedienung an unseren Tisch. Von da an gab es ""personaltechnisch"" nichts mehr zu meckern, denn unsere Bedienung war sehr nett und aufmerksam. Wir hatten einen Burger, einen Caesar's Salat und ein Spezial-Angebot Burger mit Brisket - einer texanischen Rindfleischspezialität.
Anfangs saßen wir noch im Schatten, später wanderte dieser, so dass wir halb in der Sonne saßen. Tipp: Bei heißen Sonnenwetter möglichst nah am Gebäude und nicht zur Straße hin sitzen.  

Wie man sich schon beim Namen denken kann - ist die Hauptspezialität vom Beer Park Bier. Auch wenn der ganze Laden mit Budweiser gebrandet ist, bekommt man hier Biersorten aus aller Welt (auch z.B. auch Hefe-Weizenbier aus Deutschland). 
Tipp: An der Theke kann man kostenlos einzelne Biersorten aus kleinen schnapsgläsergroßen Plastikbecherchen probieren - einfach nachfragen. Wir haben so jedenfalls die leckere Biersorte FIRESTONE Hoppy Pilsner entdeckt (zufälligerweise aus Las Vegas).

Das Essen kam im normalen Zeitrahmen. Wichtig ist: Wie schon erwähnt, sind Biere die Hauptspezialität - den Speisen kommt hier nur eine Nebenrolle zu.  Sie werden so serviert, dass man sie am Tisch mit allen teilen kann und es gibt wohl nur Plastikgeschirr.
Der Burger war saftig und mittelmäßig lecker - völlig okay, aber nichts besonderes. Für den Preis auf jeden Fall zu teuer.
Der Caesars Salat war lecker, allerdings mit zu wenig Dressing - ebenfalls zu teuer für den Preis.
Das Brisket-Spezial war lecker und wirklich reichlich - der Preis war angemessen.
Das Bier - sehr lecker - aber unverschämt teuer - ein 0,4 l Glas für 11$.

Zum Glück hatten wir einen 40$ Groupon-Gutschein, den wir anrechnen konnten.
Eine Unverfrorenheit fanden wir allerdings, was auf der Rechnung als Trinkgeld-Vorschlag stand - ganz unten auf dem Foto zu sehen!

Fazit: BeerPark - no more!

I got the pulled pork sandwich because it said it was slow smoked for 12hrs and had jalapeño slaw.  The slaw was regular with a single jalapeño slice on top.  The pork was dry and very little smoke flavor.  They put their BBQ sauce on it instead of on the side and it was not very good and definitely did not compliment the pork.  I also got a side of Buffalo onion rings.  Sounds like it could be delish but it failed badly.  Instead of blue cheese crumbles and buffalo sauce drizzle on them served with ranch or blue cheese on the side, they had some kind of crappy blue cheese dust on them served with a side of not very good hot sauce.

Beer Park is perfectly situated in front of *Paris* on the second floor with wide views of Las Vegas BLVD from the spectacular Bellagio water fountains across the street to the Eiffel Tower up above.. what a perfect venue to drop by during the day or especially at night. Inside the ambiance and vibes are nice with a rooftop feel and lots of great beers on draft. They also have water misters to beat the heat outside and the DJ was spinning great hip hop and throwbacks around 8pm the Wednesday night I came by. Sweet! 

Nichollete was our server the night I came here and she gave the best service. She was on top of everything and gave a great impression for my first time here. They also have a full bar in addition to the beer selection along with food, beer flights (Any 4 6oz from draft beer menu for $14), beer cocktails, and other specialty cocktails. I enjoyed the beer and cocktails, but the waffle fries meat and cheese which was yummy (however I would recommend skipping the egg which we added for an extra 2 bucks). I also liked the large connect four they had which  we also played with that night. This place can get pricey as my group got carried away, but when in Vegas might as well enjoy with food, shots, drinks, and beer!

This place has a great view of the bellagio and its fountains. My friends and I were constantly asking ourselves if cannons were going off with the loud bangs in the background. Tables were all outfitted with different games like jenga. Decor was also solid with a more upscale sports bar appearance. 

Food wise, appetizers were fairly solid. The burger however was quite lackluster. It didn't have enough kick and could've used maybe a little more salt. It was perfectly tender cooked at medium, but lacked that little bit of oomph. Served on a pretzel bun ish style bun which was good. I got the guacamole burger which has good toppings but the burger itself was a little lacking. Drink prices are fairly average for Vegas.

If this place wasn't in Vegas I might give it a higher review, but with standards so high there I couldn't give it higher than a 3 with the burger a little lacking.",44SmjKnfNIeMv2ms3fsQlA,1,0,3,wLtAJJhkakEu-5Sd8b6XbA

I said no we have someone getting us some can i just get a pretzel. The pretzel was a 10. Super hot and the cheese was yummy. It took a while to get that but I guess they were really busy. We wanted to order more food but our server never came back. After I got my pretzel another male server brought us waters, an hour into us being there.

So happy we discovered Beer Park. It's totally right up our alley - great craft beer selection, great food, awesome view, dope music, and family friendly! Located right in front of the Paris Hotel, with an amazing view of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains. Our kiddo enjoyed the games provided and the Bruno Mars/JT playlist, he sure loves to dance! It was about 95 degrees out that evening but the misters, fans and ice cold beers made it feel very pleasant up there. Beers were on the pricey side but that's to be expected of the location. No complaints there. We ordered the Loaded Tots, although it could have been more ""loaded"". I had to ask for an extra side of beer cheese and bacon. That was probably the only negative of the night but the service, delicious cold brews and great vibes made up for it. We also ordered the crinkle cut fries for our tot and he was all about them. Good fries + lots of games = happy kid. Happy kid = HAPPY MOMMA AND DADDY! =)

When we arrived for our reservation, the hostess initially told us that children weren't allowed that night because there would be a DJ playing that evening and the cut-off time was 8pm. Any other time would have been fine. I totally understood, and kindly just said I had wished we were informed that when I made the reservation. Before walking away, the hostess tells me, ""You know what, hold on. Let me talk to my manager and see what we could do."" A few moments later she returns and tells us the manager said it would be fine to bring in my tot, as long as we could be done by 11pm. Perfect! We were done around 10:30pm. I was so appreciative that she took the time to ask her manager, rather than just sending us away. Now that's great customer service. I can't remember her name...Kailani perhaps?.. but a big thank you to her. She was such a friendly hostess. The service for the rest of the evening was superb as well. We are definitely hitting up Beer Park every time we visit Las Vegas! 

Conveniently located right below Beer Park was HEXX Chocolate & Confexxions. Uhm..YUM! Perfect spot to grab some dessert afterward (or before!). Our tot enjoyed running amuck in there. It was a perfect ending to a perfect family fun Friday night!",tQe7VX4PnbB1yJts-KNQcA,2,0,4,0pSKvtyv262zwBiu6U8lFQ

Beer Park is located in front of the Paris hotel/casino and is right on the strip, so you will get a nice strip view should you sit at a table instead of at the bar. You can park for free at the Caesar's parking lots nearby if you are a Las Vegas local. If not, parking will be paid anywhere in the vicinity.

We had a few beers and some food. Everything tasted good, but the very high prices were quite disappointing. Expect to pay at least $10 for most beers, and over $20 if you go for one of their entrees. They do offer a very large selection of beers though. Food selection will be much smaller though.

The atmosphere here is pretty nice even though it will get quite crowded on weekends during the summer. Please note that you will sit outside so cover up between November and March since the heaters will not be enough to keep you warm.

In conclusion, I would say that this is a good place to get a beer if you don't mind paying a lot of money for it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",JR7AYVUJ1_Nq36UBW3XHYw,5,3,3,jmGmVltoNftFucN-pQoh7A

I was prepared for high prices, but not this freaking high! I don't mind paying a pretty penny for a good quality beer. $15 for a pint of beer is a bit steep. I do however object to paying a significant premium for Budweiser's portfolio of ""craft  beer"". Heck, even Bud Light was $10 or something! 

Being the sucker that I am, I ended up with a Founders Session IPA for $13.50 or something. I wasn't even close to drunk yet so that stung a bit more than the Vegas sun that was beating down my neck while sitting at the rooftop bar.  

The rooftop bar with a killer view of the strip is a great idea. In fact it's the whole point of going here. It wasn't even all that hot on the day we were there and I couldn't imagine sitting out in the sun uncovered for much longer. If it weren't for all the beer splashing me from the frat dorks playing beer pong behind me, I would've overheated out there. 

The service wasn't all that great to make me wanna come back either. I felt ignored for the majority of the time that we sat at the bar. That's okay because I ignored the line on the receipt where it says tip...

No thanks to any Budweiser swill. I'll stick to Sin City Brewing for all my beer needs until real craft beer eventually hits the strip. Or better yet, hitch a ride to downtown where there's a few decent breweries popping up lately.",Y61y11_nYsbc2UWjDh8ZEA,22,17,1,7nDNkz39HzbFnArLUCAu9w

The food was really good! I enjoyed the beer park pie! The Mac and cheese in there was delicious. My wife enjoyed her popcorn chicken but the fries here are addicting so be careful! The drinks were so delicious. I tried the park tea and Moscow mule which is definitely the best I've ever had! I enjoyed that there wasn't an over pour and I could actually enjoy it! But they also weren't skimpy drinks. My wife enjoyed creating beer flights to be able to taste a lot of the options. 

Now I'm saving the best for last! The customer service was beyond amazing!!!!! Our bartender was Alyssa who was so friendly and super funny! She was attentive all night even when she started getting super busy. Thank you for such a great night for my wife's birthday! This will definitely be a bar that we visit often!",BD1Gft3aW2smo-DSfbWwqw,0,1,5,9oQzLEx_iNq2MASHZ_D3Ww

Ordered the BBQ burger which comes with jalapeño slaw. I HIGHLY recommend it.  So flavorful and the spicy slaw was an amazing contrast to the sweet bbq sauce.

I ordered sweet potatoes fries.  They were perfectly crispy.  Frequently restaurants undercook them but Peer Park knows what the hell they are doing.

3720764,2016-10-06,2,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,"Wenn man in Vegas ist, sollte man unbedingt einen Abstecher in den Beer Park machen. Dieser befindet sich direkt beim Hotel Paris und ist ein Dach-Terrassen Restaurant und Bar.

Tagsüber sicherlich etwas wärmer und in der Sonne auch unangenehmer, trotz der Ventilatoren und Befeuchtungsanlagen, dafür aber nach Sonnenuntergang um so entspannter.

Ergattert man dann noch einen Platz direkt an der vordersten Reihe zum Strip, hat man einen wunderbaren Überblick über diesen und sitzt direkt gegenüber vom Bellagio und kann sich die Fontänen aus der Ferne anschauen.
Dieser Teil des Beer Parks ist für mich der Beste gewesen und erstaunlicherweise auch nicht so oft belegt, wie die normalen Tisch im restlichen Teil.

Der Service war immer freundlich und relativ flott zur Stelle. Das steckt ja in der US-Kultur drin, das Service meist sehr groß geschrieben wird.

Da wir öfters Abends hier vorbeischauten, konnten wir einiges auf der Karte probieren.
Die Bierauswahl ist immens und preislich im allgemeinen Rahmen von Vegas.
Auch die Cocktails lassen sich sehen und hier gibt es auch einige nette Angebote. So zum Beispiel einen Pitcher, den man u.a. auch in einer Long Island Iced Tea Version die vom Fass kommt.

Das Essen ist klassisch amerikanisch, mit Burgern, Sandwiches, Salaten und vielem mehr.
Zu empfehlen ist der Guacamole Burger und dazu als Beilage die Mac'n'Cheese. Beides sehr lecker und ordentlich in der Größe.

Vorweg sind auch sehr gut die Chili Cheese Fries. Chili con Carne auf French Fries mit Jalapenos darüber.

Zu erwähnen, das alles super satt macht und man im Grunde aus dem Restaurant rollt, muss ich sicherlich nicht. Es schmeckt aber auch wirklich so gut.

Insofern ist der Beer Park, in der riesigen Auswahl in Vegas, eine entspannten Oase, in der man nicht nur gut amerikanisch Essen kann, sondern auch noch leckere Drinks bekommt zu fairen Preisen.

3849632,2017-09-15,3,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,"Beer Park is one of the most unique spots for sports fans in Las Vegas.

First, the view of The Strip and the Bellagio fountains (although blocked by the trees across the street) is outstanding. 

Second, you really have to know where you're going to find it...and then even find the entrance. (Getting out and into the main casino floor of the Paris hotel is much easier) This isolates it from everything else and it is kind of an escape from the normal Vegas vibe.

It is basically a ton of picnic tables and bars, while you can also sit at a counter top overlooking Las Vegas Blvd or use the patio furniture seating near the pool tables.

This is a place where locals hang out and not necessarily the big gamblers. I'm guessing roughly 80% of the people here on the opening NFL Sunday were locals and about 1/3 of them were clearly Raiders fans, with the Eagles running a clear #2.

Even at 11am, it was warm in here. However, despite being outdoors, virtually every seat is covered from the sun and there's a calculated effort to keep the place comfortable despite not having air conditioning.

They have a lot of TV's, but honestly they could use another 6-8 of them and buy them a little larger. Either that or take a few that you have, split them up and scatter them around to more of the table seating. This is a bar where you should be able to see the game from any seat, but currently there are bad spots to sit if that is your primary purpose for being there. 

Tremendous beer selection, but you're going to pay handsomely for it. Food prices are more in line with what you would pay anywhere else for casual dining in Vegas. Therefore, you might want to just watch the game relatively sober, enjoy a quality lunch and then play the tables to get your drink on for free after your game is over.

As much as I love Las Vegas, I also love places in Vegas where I can escape Vegas for awhile. This is one of those spots, although the views on three sides or straight up toward the Eiffel Tower will quickly remind you of where you are.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,4,5,3,kIYYUqa-Gv47xZbd26Jysg

We didn't really come to eat, but I did order the shocktop bratwurst, which was pretty good. It had a kick to eat as it was served with their version of spicy mustard.

It's a ""Concession and Franchise Fee"" that charges you an additional 4.7% FOR NO REASON.  You get nothing for this fee.  Throughout Vegas, the majority of restaurants do not charge for this BS fee, but Beer Park is one that DOES.

It sucks, because when I was there they actually had a bottle of my favorite beer there which is pretty hard to find.  Will I come back?  No.  My favorite beer is usually $11 a bottle.  Beer Park charged $27 for the same bottle... and then slapped us with a 4.7% fee for NO reason.

Make sure you look at the very fine print to see if your Vegas restaurant charges this fee.  You can find it in tiny writing on the menu.  Then, do yourself a favor and don't attend these restaurants.  

We all know how expensive many Vegas restaurants are anyway.  Is this secretly devious fee necessary?  No.  Just like resort fees and having to pay for parking, it's one more way Las Vegas is trying their best to steal every penny from customers and keep other tourists away.

In addition to boycotting, fill out a trip advisor or yelp review about this place.  Post the information on Facebook and Twitter and tag them.  Let the company know what their doing is unethical and thieves like this should not be supported.  It's not the bartenders' fault so please don't take it out on them.  It's the owners and they should be reminded multiple times a day how much money they're losing every day when customers avoid their establishment and go elsewhere for a beer.  What's the best way to let them know?  Take one second to write up something like this online.

It's a shame.  Most customers don't even realize this occurred until the check is given.  PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILLS CAREFULLY.  
Ask for a manager.  Let them know you won't be returning due to this fake fee.

Cheers.",C-t8tfqnWxcwSQTcJUdbIw,1,0,1,6lO_dcVoJ7lRP9_0GfTLCg

We didn't try any of the food items but their beers are solid, as are their Micheladas. Nothing out of the ordinary, but if you're just looking for a chill spot with a group of friends, Beer Park it is. It was the perfect spot for us to kill some time before the club. Not as extensive of a menu as Yard House, but if you're looking for something you can't find in the LA area, again, this is it. 

They were playing reruns of The Sandlot and had table games (giant Jenga) which proved to be a nice break from typical Vegas.

I took the easy way out and did a flight of four beers, all of which were quite tasty and refreshing. In terms of the food, we went with the Chili-Cheese Fries (crinkle cut fries, chili con carne, Bass IPA cheese sauce). Then we waited.

We waited so long, in fact, that the bartender grabbed our check and made sure that she had put the order in. The food finally arrived about 20 minutes after we'd ordered it and was nowhere near hot. It had obviously been sitting there for at least five minutes before it had been brought to us, so the cheese had basically gone hard. (There were no oh-so-satisfying melty cheese strings here, that's for sure.)

4106128,2016-08-05,1,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,"I had heard lots of good things about this place and after reading the reviews on Yelp we decided to give it a try.  We are locals and rarely go to the strip these days.  Going there completely reminded us why we don't go to the strip anymore.  The food was meh, wasn't bad, wasn't anything to rave about.  I know I make a MUCH better burger at home and I can get the same wings at Buffalo Wild Wings.  The atmosphere is pretty unique, I will give them that.  It's just sad that this place, along with many more to follow, like a mindless heard of sheep, are continuing to punk people for excessive bullsh*t fees!  Really?  CNF charge of 4.7% for exactly what?  Not one single possible reason could ever justify that ridiculous fee.  Right up there with sleazy resorts bending people over and shoving it up their butts with the ever so popular ""resort fees"".   I would bet you anything that 99% of the people don't even know about this sneaky fee tapped onto their bill.  Sure it's on the menu (as it was pointed out to me after I questioned what it was, in the smallest font possible) and I never got a clear reason why.  It's a money grab, simple as that.  Perhaps to many of you 4.7% means nothing to you, it is such a small amount after all.  This is true, it is a small amount.  It is the principle behind it.  If you need to make more money then just tack that onto the cost of the food!  Just one more way The Strip is chasing away the locals.  Which actually is quite fine.  The Strip is meant for vacationers willing to settle for the smoke and mirrors of Vegas.  Regardless of this tacky sneaky fee, I wouldn't have gone back just because of the mediocre food.  

As a side note, when I got home I did some background search about the latest money grab.  It turns out this isn't the only place in Vegas pulling this stunt.  Cabo Wabo (why would you eat that crap food is beyond me) Hexx Kitchen and the cheap rip off from the real Senor Frog's are all guilty of this shameless practice.",ot4WjTlmOSYsGkjLSl9JVg,0,0,1,CD6WsslB15SEyeBKH4hc9A

On to the service, I was confused, we had two different girls come to the table at different times so it was confusing which was actually our server.  The one we deemed as our official server was very mediocre with us in her service.  Anyways on to the food.

Chili Verde nachos: Saw all the mouthwatering pictures posted and all the amazing reviews.  I was fooled, I did not care for them.  My first bite, something was off, it just had this weird taste that I'm not used to nachos tasting like. So I'm like okay, maybe I got a bad taste, I'll go back for another, nope still the same off taste.  Then I realized it tasted like a hint a beer, which was causing the off taste, as I do not enjoy the taste of beer.  My boyfriend drinks beers here and there and he also didn't like these nachos. The cheese was very mute in flavor, didn't have the typical queso flavor, no tomatoes, lettuce, guac, sour cream.  Even the pork was weird, I think they should offer chicken or beef as an alternative.

Bleu Cheese Burger: This is what my bf got and it was pretty tasty, however the fries were an extra cost and way too much salt.",XxjaFDQdDxLBVM4jxZfYsQ,2,0,3,zVBJG4G48y1Mz404_BXAyg

We were given water by the busboy and also menus. We were told at the bar we were sitting at that it wasn't open and we weren't going to be serviced over here that we had to go to the main one that was open to please a order. Hubs went to order a drink for me and walked up to the bar and was ignored by the Asian bartender. So he went to ask for some help at one of the cocktail waitress and was told by her she was too busy for him. One when we walked into their kitchen and asked who was in charge, and when he answered hubs said there should be someone to serve people at the no service bar. We have money that we wanted to spend while being here to watch the game.

IMHO final euro soccer game y?u should have more people on staff, it will get full, they're a bar what did you expected especially being in Las Vegas. And the people who are servers shouldn't have such a attitude when you're in the customer service industry, try being a little more polite just saying. 

We sat there for the whole game ordered food and ordered drinks throughout, the bartender that we had made up for the fact that his fellow coworkers didn't have the same attitude as he did.

We had the chicken bbq wings, the waffle cut fries and their chicken quesadilla. The wings were savory, the fries were crisp and the quesadilla was tasty and served ""pizza style"". 
Music, games, big screen tvs, hot dog stand and beers galore. I will definitely come back...especially for NFL season!!",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,3,2,5,pYn8YLzLaQ6O2_5li-xKsw

Yesterday, made me realize it's time to find another watering spot! 
Sat down, bartender (Daniel), looks over, sees me, and Goes about his business. The bar top was 3/4 at this point. A few minutes later, he says he'll be right back with a menu. 
Two gals sit. He greets them. They get menus. I get it, ladies first. 
He finally circles back. I get a beer menu. 
Here's the mistake on my part: I should've ordered right then and there. 
Takes him longer to circle back to get my order.
Now I realize why his side of the bar was 3/4 empty. 
Saw people eating food. Didn't offer a food menu.
Daniel definitely does not need to be in the bar business.
Awful. Just awful service. 
Spend your money somewhere else. Tilted Kilt. Not great, but completely more competent staff.

Everything on menu is a la carte; sandwiches don't come with sides.  That being said, if you order the backyard bbq dog, ask them to put the potato salad and baked beans on the side, and they serve these in small dishes instead of piled up onto the hot dog.  Highly recommend the homemade blue cheese dressing.  Ask to substitute it, if you order the cobb salad.

BEWARE - This restaurant charges a ""Concession and Franchise Fee"" that is 4.7% of your bill.

Minuses: Beer selection is mainly dark or Amber beers. Super hot up on the roof even at night. The cool air Misters blow right up into the air. Totally useless. The view of the Bellagio fountains? Non existent through shrubbery. Waitstaff was less than pleasant.

We had a full view of the strip and the DJ (Bayami) was playing the best set. We had such a fun time with our beer flights and playing oversized jenga that, get this, we came back the next day!

Only complaint was the ahi was really salty to the point I had to scrape some of the seasoning off.  The reason I gave this place a 3 was because I think they need to adjust some of their prices.  I didn't feel like drinking so I got a soda-- cost me $4.95 for it. Had I known I would have gone across the street and bought a bottle at CVS.

It's just a fee they tack on to charge you more. Most people, apparently, don't even notice because they're pretty wasted by the time they pay their bill. 

Apparently, there's a notice on the menu literally slipped into the same small print notice about eating undercooked eggs.

Yes there is a problem when I have to move my seat and when the waitstaff admits it when I tell them.

The food was pretty good. We tried some nachos that were tasty. But what I liked about this place was the beer selection.

5221768,2017-10-02,0,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,"This is a cool place to watch a game. Great atmosphere. TV's everywhere, ice cold beers on tap. Still has that 'new' feel to it. Everyone had their teams colors on. What more can you ask for? But for us, there were some negatives.

The bad: it was 95 degrees out by kickoff at 1pm. My arms were getting a little scorched as the sun would peak through gaps in the awning overhead. My wife was starting to look uncomfortable. I asked one of the servers about the misters I had read about that help keep the place cool. She said she'd check with her manager about that. She returned after a few minutes and said they don't turn them on this time of year because it doesn't get hot enough. Um, okay. Its 95 degrees out! It doesn't make any sense whatsoever to have this feature for the comfort of your guests but decide not to turn it on even though it was a scorching hot day. 

We ordered the pretzel with queso dip and the mac and cheese egg rolls to start. They were both good except they both came out piping hot and the heat made it a little hard to enjoy the food.

We suffered through a half of football before leaving to find somewhere to watch the rest of the game indoors with some AC.

Honestly, if it were not for the issues we encountered with the heat this place would merit a solid 4 stars.

Note: A couple reviewers mentioned a $35 per person minimum for Sunday football. I called to inquire about the minimum per person charge and was told it was in fact $50 per person. When we got there we were prepared to stay 3+ hours to watch an entire game and were willing to pay that but no one mentioned anything about a minimum charge. And since we only ended up staying for half of the game and only ordered 2 appetizers to share and a beer each we didn't get anywhere close to $50 or even $35 per person. When we asked for the bill we paid for what we ordered and left. Obviously I'm not complaining but I thought they were inconsistent with this policy. I guess it depends on who you get and what type of mood they are in on any given Sunday.",JLqFX-w2a4CyiP0wttt81A,2,0,3,72e38HjfvqkUodjQuxwfUQ

Conceptualized as a year-round Backyard Barbeque and optimized for watching sports on one of over two-dozen Television while drinking a cold one, enjoying innovative twists on iconic American Foods and  even playing a variety of party games such as Jenga, it was just prior to 5:30pm that stairs outside the newly designed Alexxa Bar were climbed with greetings quickly offered by two young women, a well-advised reservation soon confirmed and the party of five subsequently led to a picnic table with a good vantage of the Rams and Falcons as well as Hockey and College Basketball.

Now approaching anniversary number two and still doing big volume, the weekend leading up to CES and a flood of New Yorkers in town for the Rangers versus Golden Knights on Sunday creating a particularly lively scene and broad diversity of jerseys and chants, it was just prior to shift-change that seats were taken and Waters poured, a quick perusal of the laminated menu showing several new additions, the decision to order in two rounds proving a wise one as the increased volume saw several items including Beer Park's Ribs still in the midst of a second batch being made.

Dining with familiar faces of varied preferences, part of Beer Park's appeal the surprising diversity of a fairly straightforward menu catering to many tastes, it was alongside an enormous pile of crispy Tortilla Chips smothered in Pork, smoked Chiles and refreshing Herb Cream that Beer Park's signature Mac & Cheese Egg Rolls were presented, the wrappers holding up better this time than last and thus even more appealing compared to the more frequently seen deep-fried iteration while the all-new ""Beer Park Pie"" dialed up texture and spiciness by combining elements of the other two Appetizers into a dish both Southerners and the occasional Midwest native will find familiar and audacious yet delicious.

Not the sort of place to cut corners, on-site smokers, house-ground Burgers and artisan Sausages forming the backbone of entrees that also include Salads, Sandwiches, Fish and Shrimp, it was mostly in traditional Backyard favorites that appetites were invested, an off-menu ""Kids Meal"" featuring naked Hot Dog plus Fries pleasing a youngster before the desired half-rack of Ribs was ready, the smoke seemingly not as deep-penetrating as last visit whether as a result of being rushed or the intervening departure of former Pitmaster Eddy.

Again impressed by Beer Park's housemade Pickles and focus on authenticity, the Wonder Bread beneath Ribs and dishwasher-safe Red Cups amongst many examples, it was just prior to halftime and in the middle of an intense game of ""Chairs"" that three Sandwiches arrived,  the Nacho and  Guacamole Burgers similar though the first placed Tortilla Chips and housemade Cheese Sauce atop the finely-ground Patty while Beer Park's smoked Meatloaf Sandwich proved not for the faint of heart...or delicate in taste buds...thanks to scorching Jalapeno Slaw that required a bit of extra Barbeque Sauce, Pickles and Water refill to help cool off.

**** America's longtime epicenter for televised athletics and now the proud owner of an NHL Franchise, Las Vegas' position as a major US City in addition to its ""destination"" status now an immutable fact, there nonetheless remains a lack of family-friendly venues to watch the game while dining in Sin City, though in the Strip's typical fashion Beer Park makes no mistake by going all-in.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,5,4,7Wk_hy96TScqALge_gedTw

Newish sports bar type place OUTSIDE of the Paris hotel. They have TONS of big screens tuned to all the relevant games and lots of delicious beers on draft and bottled to choose from.

Food is overpriced and not anything special. I shared the carne Adana plate ($22) with my uncle and it was tough and lackluster. My parents said the salads were decent but it's $15-$20 bucks. Definitely skip it.

Another positive: they have a ton of games you can play for free (they hold your ID  while you're using it). They have a jumbo connect four you can play on your table, and my dad and I played shuffleboard while we waited for our food.

My advice? Skip the food. Come here for a beer (or 3) and to catch part of your game.

WARNING: they have misters but if you are in the sun/here not in the winter months or at night it will be HOT and miserable.",ONAC8zv6KUlnx1EAyRZbmA,0,0,4,69l8kgCquMFj7q3cpTrB4A

That is not the case. The selection was subpar at best. Very few regional beers, nothing I haven't seen while grocery shopping. Though they are priced as if they were imported from the ends of the earth, delivered by golden knights on horse back. Disappointed to say the least. 

The food however (priced cheaper than the beer in most cases) was on point. I had the pineapple jalapeno bbq burger on a pretzel bun, amazing. The Gilroy garlic fries with a side of cheese sauce, great flavor. My friend had the guacamole burger. Well seasoned, cooked perfect and reasonably priced.

I enjoyed this place! First time here but I will frequent it whenever I am in Vegas. It's a get away from all the hustle and bustle from the Vegas strip. It's sort of a roof top bar, but it's not super high up. Great views of Bellagio and the fountain show that happens every 15 minutes. Also a great place to people watch and watch the traffic go by.

They serve all sorts of beers. We only did one round and did not try any of the food. I'd like to try the food next time. Seemed like it was just appi's but the food we saw looked decent and like typical bar food. The prices were normal, we got 2 beers and the total was like $21 bucks. 

They have tables and also bar stools across the edge of the roof, where the view is great. The bar stools were extremely uncomfy! My bum def hurt by the time we left! So that's one thing I would change about this place. Other than that, the ambiance is very chill and there are games all around which is super fun! It was a hot night and they had cool air flowing so it was comfy. The people that come here seem to be very laid back and normal, which is a nice change from the regulars of Vegas. I was way too over dressed because we had plans prior and after Beer Park, but I could have worn shorts and a tee and would have fit right in!

The bartenders were nice and efficient and the music playing was great! I actually was a huge fan of the music at this spot. We were singing away to the classics that were played.

We decided to check it out spontaneously after we finished the rehearsals. It is fairly easy to get to, I recommend parking in The Paris Hotel garage and walking through the hotel to the main entrance. Once you step outside on Las Vegas Blvd, it is located on the right. At the bottom of the patio, there is a cool little bar that people can walk up to and get a drink to go. One can order a simple beer but also available are the more touristy, fruity slurpee drinks. We headed upstairs where the main patio is located. We got a nice table and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains, The Cosmopolitan, and the Eiffel Tower at The Paris Hotel. The beer menu is extensive with a long list of draft beers and craft bottled beers. As a craft beer lover, I was pleased with the choices. We had already eaten so we didn't order any food although the waffle fries looked good as they floated by covered in a creamy, cheesy garlic sauce. Mmmmm they smelled delish! 

The patio is large and extensive with a bar and plenty of seating. There are several large and small tables under a patio with tarp like shades. There are a couple of areas where you can play life size versions of Jenga and Connect Four. Also they have a couple of pool tables to use as well. We had amazing service from our server. She was prompt with delivery of our drinks and checked on us often. They do allow tastings of the draft beers in case you are undecided. 

Overall, I liked this place. The views are phenomenal and at night with all the hotels lit up, I am sure it is even better. I plan to return when it warms up a bit more, pull up a barstool overlooking the boulevard and people watch.",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,6,4,5,oXWaNQFYop9_e6TDwT6WMg

We were there Saturday night, a very cold Saturday night and it was still pretty busy, but you can tell as soon as it warms up it will be slammed. There are a ton of neat things to do (people size Jenga, Corn Hole, Pool, and several other games I can't remember now, lol) and the view is fabulous! There are a ton of TV's playing every sport you can think of and a wide range of seating options (bars, tables, group tables, comfy couches) 

Let's get to the good stuff, the food! At the moment, they are not doing the full menu but a small sampler of what they will have. I am very excited for the full menu though, as many of their offerings have some kind of beer ingredient involved which sounds very cool. Another thing I have been excited about are the prices. Everything is very reasonably priced, especially for the strip! Love that they are not going crazy on the pricing, it means we can eat more, lol!

On Saturday we had the Chile Verde Nachos, and Hummus. The Nachos were fabulous!! The chips taste homemade, the cheese sauce (made with beer) is great, and the pork was sooooo good, and I am not usually even a pork fan. It was one of those meals you keep eating after you are full just because it is so yummy! The hummus was great too and the pita chips that came with it were yummy and there was a TON of them! My husband and I shared and couldn't even finish all the food, great portion sizes!

I should mention too that the cups and dishes look like red solo cups, or plastic cups, and paper plates but are actually a sturdy hard plastic and it is just kind of neat. Gives you that outdoor bbque or tailgate feel, but is actually a sturdy option. They even have tiny red solo shot glasses! 

I'll end this with saying they also have a TON of beer (duh, beer park) I actually had margaritas (YUM!) but will have to try some of the bazillion beers they have another time. I saw them giving little tasters of beer out, which I thought was very cool, so you can make sure you like it before you get a huge one.

Just like your local community park, Beer Park is a completely outdoor venue with a playground of grown-up activities.

While you can't grill your own BBQ as you would at the park down the street, Beer Park's got a pretty good food menu.  For me, I didn't dive into the entrees, but I can attest that the Chile Verde Nachos hit the spot.

5737616,2017-10-11,0,-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,"We ate lunch at Beer Park and came away quite impressed with this center strip restaurant. Perched right atop the Las Vegas Strip, this outdoor venue treats you to a great view in a fun & casual environment. 

The menu is about what you would expect. Appetizers, burgers, sandwiches and a few entrees to choose from. On our visit, Karen decided to go with the Popcorn Chicken appetizer. Dipped in a spicy buffalo sauce, and served with blue cheese & ranch (Karen passed on the blue cheese), this appetizer is a healthy portion. Karen hardly made a dent but it was great to take home for lunch for the next day.

I went with the Kahuna Cowboy Burger minus the cheese. An average size burger, it is served on a Pretzel Bun and is topped with a tasty Jalapeno BBQ sauce. Like many places on the strip, the burgers are served a la carte. Instead of adding fries or onion rings, I decided to add the Bavarian pretzel on the appetizer menu. Perfect size!

The service was really good on our visit as our server was very helpful on a number of questions. You will also hear some of your favorite musical artists over the sound system which helps create a fun vibe. Lastly, I wouldn't go here specifically to watch a game because there's no game sound, but there are plenty of TV's around should you want to keep an eye on a game or score. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend Beer Park. There is one negative that absolutely annoys me. On all checks, there is a ""CNF"" fee added to your bill. As far as I can tell, this is simply an added fee with no real reason for being added. It's a cheap move and sadly in line with many fees now associated with your visit to the strip. It's not much (ours was $1.73), but to me, it's still the principal. If you need to raise your prices...just raise your prices. Don't disguise it in a fee that nobody knows what it is.

Atmosphere - 4 stars

Background - Untappd lead me here to earn a badge.

Atmosphere - You can see the place from the street.  I was spending most of my time at the Flamingo.  So I head down the street heading south.  I see the stairs, the door is locked.  Which I figure you need to enter from the inside of Paris.  I took the elevator near the bar, which took me to the night club and was ushered out quickly.  I was told use a door and turn to the right.  Wow so much easier coming from the south going north.  The stairwell is very visible.  So it a large bar on the roof top of the first floor looking out onto the strip.   The place was packed already at 5:30 on a Saturday night on cool fall night.  I wonder how popular this place is during hot summer nights.   
 
Food
  Drinks - This is AB InBev bar which means that there is a lot their beers which you can order.  I had the Joe, an IPA from 10 Barrel for $12 plus tip.  The one cool thing is that they have is the Goose Islands sister beers, which living in Reno those are pretty rare.  Since it was just me and I like sours but not enough to finish off 765 ml bottle, I had to skip on them.

Service - Sitting with money in my hand looking at three different employees that were not waiting on any customers was frustrating.  Finally someone paid attention, wham bam and done.  Just a stare to indicate they are ready for my order.  Beer arrives and the huge price tag.  Fine the place is packed but a smile and hello would be nice.

Future - Probably not with the prices here.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,26,15,3,mu0cPJuM3Yw_VeXBIB0law

My family and I arrived around 6:30 on this past Friday, we were greeted by a friendly hostess she asked how many we told her 4...then another RUDE hostess interrupts and says you will have to sit at bar, all table are reserved. We were confused since we had under age kids with us, but we went to bar and found seats. The bartender asked for our kids IDs and we explained the situation that happened. He stated to us SINCE THEY ARENT THAT BUSY we would have to be seated at a table...We laughed and said that's what we wanted all along! He had a manger take us IMMEDIATLY to a table!! I guess they weren't all reserved. We had an awesome table with a view of the Bellagio water show. We had a beer sampler, ate nachos and garlic fries and played words against humanity..We had so much fun. I would say that the nachos were big but could have used a lot more of the toppings..Never the less they were delicious...SO I guess I should thank that rude hostess because due to her unwillingness to help us and be kind we ended up with a 5 star experience. I would come back here in a heart beat!!",rIBStsFqfa2FoW15WDl86g,1,0,5,lWtiR1RveQYJs2ng0-Hs6w

The Beer Park has a nice selection of craft beers including two of my favorites from Goose Island: Green Line and Sofie. 

We were sat immediately by a cheerful hostess and then served excellently by ""Karen"". Karen stayed on top of our needs the whole time and tried to keep us longer but alas, we wanted to walk the Strip. 

While sitting on the balcony deck we had a great view of the people and cars going up and down the main strip. We also watch the water show across the street at the Bellagio. 

There is a stage on the balcony and I was told by Karen that Beer Park was having a lip syncing contest that night at midnight. We got to watch several rehearsals and knew that the event was going to be cool. 

We ordered a few small plates to compliment the beer. They were good but not to die for. On the other hand we didn't go into the Beer Park to eat so we were not disappointed",ECFPcA5tiKc5ZGu38MhR_g,0,0,4,JLgwBxrZEr74F3-NWmLS1Q

Was on the hunt for a place with good beer, outside away from the casino smoke, and where I could watch the game.  Beer Park sounded enticing so I checked them out.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that Beer Park also has an awesome view, and a nice open, clean large space to hang and enjoy.  Finding the entrance was a little confusing, so just ask somebody. 

The beer selection was pretty good, catered a bit to the masses, but I was able to find a few yummy ones.  I went for the $15 flight because it seemed like a good way to get my monies worth.  Was really nice to enjoy on a 101 degree evening while taking in the strip from above.  Also, the music was awesome, they were playing some really good mixes, and the atmosphere was just somewhere you want to be.",DqvPZh-crUdz4vN4tuVw-Q,5,2,4,za4i0UfYGACKjFPZB46yEw

We watch the Georgia Florida game and had the pleasure of being helped by Laura Madison and Cole.  These three ladies working like crazy but took the time to smile take a couple pictures and laugh along with us. I've sent quite a few people here and when I told my UK clients that I was there, they immediately asked how Madison was. Apparently they were taken with this mixed martial arts beauty/bartender. All the ladies had great costumes on that were not overly sexy and ridiculous. A scarecrow a zombie cheerleader and rowdy Roddy piper were all perfect for that day. Thank you for a wonderful time. Will be back soon with more friends. The food was good the alcohol prices were a bit steep but that's to be expected if you're on the strip and how nice the place is. Ps.

Most people are probably hammered enough by the time they pay that they don't notice. Go literally anywhere else. We have many quality beer establishments in Vegas who don't charge this ridiculous fee such as, Beerhaus by the TMobile Arena, Atomic Liquor, and Banger Brewing.

You can see the fountain show every 20 minutes! When we were there they were still getting their kitchen fully operational. However, they still have some delicious food available, like hummus, guac and pulled pork sandwiches. They have a lot of monitors to watch sports on, and its just a lovely atmosphere.

Here is the short story: the beers are ridiculously overpriced. $12 bucks for Elyisan Space Dust pint? $9 dollars for Squatters Hop Rising?

No thank you.

I get that this is Vegas, but give me a break. Thats just highway robbery.

You are paying for the view, which is really good. However, $12 dollars + for some beers is just too much.",WfePuaS_iXGNGU6bfDe3JQ,3,2,2,aOWdRL7yD09IyQK7ER3WOA
