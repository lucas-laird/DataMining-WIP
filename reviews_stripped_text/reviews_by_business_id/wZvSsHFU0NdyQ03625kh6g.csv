I bit into a crunchy, soft and crispy sandwich. Yummy. The veggies were really fresh, the meat had flavor and there was just enough heat to get my attention.

289516,2017-07-29,0,wZvSsHFU0NdyQ03625kh6g,"Not a very good experience.  The decor is boring and plain.  Our host/waiter was typical no-personality poor service expected from a Chinese waiter.  Except for filling our teapot one time, no one asked about our food, if we wanted anything else, etc.  We had to ask for the bill at the end of our meal.

As for the food?  We originally ordered 4 dishes from the MENU. Three were not available.  We were notified after our order was placed that two of the three were not available (at different times I may add), requiring us to look at the menu three times to choose 4 dishes that were available.  We had shrimp cakes that tasted like crab, and pork, so were either very old or they just didn't want to come back and tell us the shrimp cakes were also out of stock.  The ""porkchops"" were salty, looked more like short ribs.  The only dish that was tasty was the green beans.  

Finally, they gave us a family style bowl of rice without our ordering it.  $2.00 was then added to the bill for two orders of rice.  Since they did not charge for the hot tea, I paid without complaining and my party did eat the rice.  The total for the rice and 4 dishes, two of which were only vegetables was over $61.49.

Our family of 6 came for dinner on Christmas night.  We had the house special fish, fried chicken, salt & pepper tofu, special seafood-tofu pot, sautéed green beans and sautéed Chinese spinach.  The food was below average - the fish was mushy and not very fresh, and the fried tofu was over done.  A large number of our family lives in the San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles, CA, so we know good Chinese and Vietnamese food.  This restaurant would never make it in the SGV.

Worst of all, the cashier/management was highly unethical.  Our dinner was around $90, and the itemized receipt, which added in both tax of about $10 and a 15% service charge of about $14, came to just over $114.  We provided a credit card, and when the charge slip came, the ""new total"" was $144, an extra $30 higher!!!   The itemized receipt was also gone from the little folio.

We went up to the cashier counter to ask a for copy of the itemized receipt again, and sure enough, the tip was already in the original total of $114, and the $30 was secretly added on.  When we pointed this out to the cashiers, we weee quickly told, ""Oh, this was a typo, we will cancel this charge and issue you a corrected charge slip.""  No apologies.  We had been fully ready to tip extra due to the holidays and the hard working servers, but NOT after this unethical shenanigan.  

Go elsewhere for good Chinese food, or if you must eat here, check your receipt and charge slips carefully for more ""errors.""  Consumer beware.",Fmd4_nplXpZY29CojSqQow,0,0,1,W9-vVmboTBQOFu5N5e9mxA

This may very well be our last time in Chinatown after a long absence from eating out in general. It used to be the cool place in Vegas to eat and shop at a good price. These days our experiences have been very negative. We've visited a few restaurants in this area and the same scenario plays out: non-American Asians and the few whites around are treated well; and everyone else F.U. 

What started out as a small enclave in the Westside where anyone could come as they were has now unofficially become ""Asian only"" in certain establishments. I guess the Asian tour buses in Chinatown Plaza take the place of other customers (local or not). This type of segregation reminds me of rural America and plays a big role in ruining the once vibrant spirit of Las Vegas. I was not raised to separate myself from others who are different than myself; and I find this new ambiance very jarring and disturbing. 

My advice is to observe the clientele and interactions to determine which places will be a right fit. It is not advisable to just ""walk in.""

On another note, their credit card receipt looks ambiguous because the lines for pre-tip amount and tip amount were almost the same. One needs to be careful and clear when filling out and signing their credit card info on the merchant's copy.",5GPJYhFS9h71eb2Ow7Gj5w,0,0,2,vh14pLCHKR8CeCaZG-BcjQ

I honestly was craving some good vermicelli and Pho Kim Long had a really long wait... pressed on time we came here out of convenience. Thinking back, I would have been better off with panda or some other form of fast food... 

My Food Review-

I ordered a beef vermicelli bowl... which really was just average.
In addition I decided to add to my order beef chow fun, but of course I specified no veggies... come to find out it came with a sauce that i was not a big fan of. So i kindly asked to have it remade. This is where the issue began... after having, who I think is a manager, come to yell at me, I also had the waitress come to me to... both times they showed me the menu but I  still could not see an issue since it did not say anywhere in English that it came with a pool of super saturated gravy.... so eventually the order comes out -this time there are veggies - which I had been very clear to them before they placed the order... so at this point I didn't complain... I simply spent a good portion of my time taking most of it out.... meanwhile, I had the staff walk past me ignoring me completely.... 

Conclusion-

Food was below average and the service is not any better. Places should respect what you order if you are paying. Let alone, want to enjoy a potentially good meal. My recommendation, go somewhere that is actually delicious and has good service!",x5TnPRgrUGQ8eP35ThRrHA,0,0,1,GQUE6OcUQ88fATRsLp10Vg

Menu options include fish, shellfish, crab, squid, shrimp, and even sea cucumber- basically everything that comes from the sea, plus options that don't (beef, chicken, pork).

I had a killer craving for salt and pepper shrimp (labeled here as House Special Shrimp) and found them perfectly crispy, with tons of fried green onion and jalapeno, but the actual shrimp itself was less salty and less peppery than other, more flavorful versions I've had in town.
We also got the sautéed spinach, add garlic, and found it to be tasty- comparable to the baby bok choy dish at Ichiza, except with spinach and a slightly less robust sauce. Dish was tasty but a bit gritty, as if it hadn't been adequately rinsed.

Nonetheless, I drove them to Chinatown and decided to try this place. 

The next day at the convention center, we were all in the meeting room when one of them asked me ""Do you have diarrhea?""

Did he just ask me if I have diarrhea? I told him no. Then, another of my co-worker confirmed that he, too, has diarrhea. 

Great, a company meeting on diaarhea. Apparently,  everyone in the room had it, except me. 

One by one, they asked me if I ate this or that dish...

Co-worker 1: Did you have the spicy beef with chili peppers?
Me: Yes, it was good, spicy but good.

Co-worker 2: How about the sweet and sour fish?
Me:  Ah, I had it. It was pretty tasty and tangy.

Co-worker 3: Maybe it was the hot and sour soup.
Me: No, I had that one, too. A bit sour but still has that nice kick.

Co-worker 4: Ah, it must be the jellyfish.
Me: That, for me, was the best dish.

Finally, the President then said:  Well, then it must be the sea cucumber.
Me: Oh, that slimy, alien-looking thing? I'm Asian but I'm not that Asian.

Both cooked perfectly - not overcooked and really flavorful. We also got the crab appetizer - which was a special. That dish was so bad that neither of us could eat it. It was cooked so long that you could even bite all the way through the pieces. And it had a sauce that was totally funky.

The Pho Tai was surprisingly good since the broth tasted just like places I've been at in California.  The meat was also good, but I noticed red onions were used instead of white onions.  The Mongolian Beef was delicious, the pork clay pot was good and the half Fried Crispy Chicken was not bad.

Capital Seafood was suggested as one of our venue's to host our weekly activity. This fine ethnic establishment fit all of the requests, cost, menu items, and round tables.  (Long rectangular tables or split seating in general makes for awkward dinner conversations where everyone is just not able to get involved.)

The hostess and staff were friendly and polite, attentive and our drinks were never less than half full (woo hoo!).  

For the first hour (even on a Friday night) our party was the only table in the house, hence the stellar attentiveness from the staff.  But the restaurant filled up shortly there after.  Hot tea to start passed along the lazy susan (love those!), won ton soup was delicious and the egg rolls though nothing overly special were tasty.

I can't recall all of the menu items we ordered but everything I tried was fresh, hot and delicious.  Bonus was the lack of sticker shock when the bill arrived! We only had 5 people in our party this week but appetizers, entrees, soups, all came to a reasonable $115! Impressive.

My only gripe is that of most ethnic restaurants (sometimes), the smell. I get it, the place is called ""Capital SEAFOOD"" and such but boy o boy I was ready to jam out of there as hour 3 of family dinner took effect. Fishy, greasy, I don't know but it was making me queasy, ha.

if they sit you on the left side it's usually to eat Vietnamese (black menu), no white table clothe :(
on the right will be chinese food (burgundy menu)
you can also pick a fish or crab or lobster from their aquarium. they will cook it for you, price is per the pound.

The food has always come out to our table very fast and they never forget to refill our water. The only thing that takes a while is when we're ready for the bill and for our change.

First, she ordered way too much food for 2 people.  We got beef chow fun, mixed vegetables with garlic, breaded salt and pepper pork chops, and a tofu hot pot.  Yikes!  The table was full and there were only two of us.

The dishes were all very good.  My favorite was the hot pot.  The tofu is fried first and then put in the broth.  There were a couple of kinds of seafood in the hot pot and some chicken and pork.  There were also some beautiful mushrooms that held the heat from the burner below.  Be on guard to let the mushrooms cool a bit before eating.

A couple of things regarding service.  We were seated and our server was prompt at getting our order.  Since my friend is from Taiwan, she ordered in Chinese and I'm sure that helped our service.  

At the end of the meal, they brought us a complimentary warm mung bean dessert that was very tasty--not too sweet.  Our server also packaged up all the leftovers in take out boxes and I have enough in my refrigerator to feed half the Taiwanese army.  It will taste good as leftovers.

One stereotype I encountered was that one of the servers placed a fork and spoon with extra napkins at my plate but not at my friends.  I wanted to jab him with my chopsticks when he next went by, but I realize he was being helpful.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,4,4,DujPoNlzSLjjnotBjrzBSg

 We have been to this restaurant a few times in the past and their food was always pretty good, and we always enjoyed it. However, tonight's dinner was totally disappointing. We ordered four dishes: Beef chow-fun, Pea sprout stir fried with garlic,Gai-lan broccoli with shrimp and Frog legs with ginger and green onion. The Beef chow-fun arrived first. The taste we expected from  this noodle dish was a little odd. It tasted sweet instead of the well balance of soy and oyster sauce seasoning. Then followed by the shrimp and Gai-lan, which tasted bland without seasoning, the Pea sprout was the best of all dishes but still fell short below standard average. Most disappointing was the frog legs, one could tell the protein was previously frozen and didn't thaw out properly and cooked in a rush, the meat tasted rather dry and chewy without any flavor, a disaster for people who would expect the moist, sweet freshness of frog legs.  

Since we were all hungry, we did wipe out most of the dishes except the frog legs. Besides the poor food quality, service through the meal was minimal, no check back after food was delivered and no tea refill either. 
We could see servers chatting on the side and no show of appreciation for business while we were exiting the establishment. Bad food, poor service - I don't think we will return to this restaurant in our future trips again!",bDJoNpTbgax-3bw_kuMHEQ,1,0,2,CA8iOmx713v83SovRNmgfQ

I was in town during the National Rodeo Finals, 12/8-12/14.  Due to the economy, Vegas has become quite dead.  The same goes for Chinatown.

I don't understand why the restaurant has a Vietnamese side and a Chinese side when you are mostly seated on the Vietnamese side.  We ordered 3 bowls of Pho and they arrived luke warm.  Who wants luke warm Pho anyway?

To top it off, our lettuce came with a big clump of dirt.  We ordered some eggrolls and the lettuce that came with that also had a big clump of dirt.  We brought it to the attention of the Manager (whom we always had good rapport with).  He took the lettuce off our table and came back 10 minutes later with the same lettuce rinsed under the sink.  At this point we were done eating.

We told him to save it and he mumbled something and walked away.  I guess there must be customers coming out the wazoo for this unexpected rude service.  I wonder why the ""A"" is on the window?

To make matters worse, one of the waitresses was cleaning up the table next to us and said in Chinese that the people were cheap and didn't leave a tip.

They do offer a great deal of lunch specials, but we ended up ordering the entree portions for our party of three.  We went for the Vegetarian Chow Mein, Hong Kong-style ($8.50) and the Beef Chow Fun ($8.50).

They start you off with complimentary sweet and sour soup.  It was pretty salty, not something I would order on my own.

The entree dishes were pretty decent size (check out the pics), but I could have used more veggies in the chow mein order. 

They also gave us complimentary dessert - a hot sweet soup with tapioca balls and jelly.

More than likely, he just likes delicious whole fish.

A couple of weeks ago we had asked our favorite waitress at Thai Noodle where she liked to eat. Being a college kid, she said she spent a lot of time hanging at the 24-hour IHOP on Rainbow partially because it is 24-hours and partially because there is a really great waitress there. Besides pancake combos, she said she really enjoyed a hot and sour whole fish at Capital Seafood. I can't tell you if the waitress at IHOP is really that great, but I can give you the run down on the whole fish at Capital.

The Mr. loved it. It is a whole flounder pan fried with hot and sour flavors. It is delivered piping hot with a pile of jalapenos on top. I must warn you that the sour smell is intense if you get a deep whiff, definitely a fermented sauce lurking in the mix, but the flavor is great-- kind of like a sophisticated McNuggets' sweet and sour. (Be careful because if you accidentally order the SWEET and sour I think you will be in for a bigger dose of fermented smell. I overheard the owner tell a table that not too many people can handle the sweet and sour.) I think the sauces are more Vietnamese than Chinese, as the restaurant is half Vietnamese, and on the Chinese menu the dishes also have Vietnamese names. There is also a completely separate Vietnamese menu.

In addition to the fish, we ordered green beans in garlic sauce without meat. (Always important to make that clear at Asian restaurants.) I could imagine someone complaining about the beans being greasy because the whole time I was stuffing them in my mouth I was thinking, ""These can't be good for me."" Still, my taste buds approved the perfect combination of garlic, spiciness and grease. Plus, the green beans were wilted exactly to my taste. I can't stand when green beans are all waxy and squeaky when you bite into them. Blame my Southern mom for raising me on overcooked vegetables. 

The pot of white rice was super hot. The service was friendly. The food was delivered quickly. All in all it was a positive experience, but our next whole fish adventure will probably be testing out the frying service at the fish counter of Ranch 99. (That place has to be the nicest smelling Asian supermarket I have ever entered.)

The Mr. said he would definitely eat the whole fish at Capital again, but when it comes to food, we seem to always be searching for the next better thing. I am sticking to three stars because eating two dishes does not really qualify me to bestow more.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,3,1,3,RHVyNcjMdgd4MRVXi9fb3A

5283049,2018-04-16,0,wZvSsHFU0NdyQ03625kh6g,"My boyfriend introduced this place to me and my favorite dish here is the house special fish filet. We've gone here normally during lunch together and I will say their service is quick. We've always called ahead of time to let them know we're just coming in for lunch so they always have our dishes ready for us as soon as we get there which is great since we both have an hour lunch! The fish filet is seasoned in this really nice sauce that I absolutely love. There's green onions and jalepenos to top off the dish so it's perfect if you want some spice. It comes with steamed rice, soup and dessert. Now I give it 3 stars because it seems something is different every time I go and for these reasons below. They've never told me I had to have a minimum of $10 in order to use my debit/credit card but I was never told this. The last time I went in for lunch the older gentleman who was my waiter informed me it needed to be a $10 minimum and that there's always been a sign there. He let me know that this time it was ok but for the next time it's the minimum $10. I have no problem with the $10 minimum, but I'm just curious did they change the policy or did they charge me more during my past visits when I've always used my card? The hot and sour soup it comes with seems like it has too much cornstarch or something since the consistency is sort of like gelatin/gloppy soup. The warm desert like soup they give you after your meal is not my favorite, it's just not for me. But decent place for lunch and for a quick lunch!

*TIP: call ahead and let them know you're coming for lunch/dinner and if they can have it ready by the time you get there, give them an ETA. It's easier when you know what you want ahead of time so I advise you look at the menu ahead of time before calling and letting them know you're otw!",7kM0cE5UfCirNA2it1O2Qg,0,0,3,nP644riRMc0k88iouAN1Eg

This is always the go to spot when I want to treat my parents to a meal. It is only becoming more difficult to convince them to go out with the economy, but with the mere mention of Capital they are getting ready. It has a lot to do with the prices, quality, and service.

The prices are cheap for the amount that you get. I am not a fan of getting a large plate of substandard and Capital Seafood does not make me feel like I am lowering my expectations.

The whole fried fish in sweet and sour sauce ($7.95) comes out so crisp that you can eat the bones around the edge. An order of kung pao tofu ($5.95) comes out looking like the Great Pyramids topped with whole chilies, peanuts, and chunks of scallions. My sister's favorite seafood chow fun in gravy ($7.95) is always hot and filled with gai lan and a variety of shrimp, fish cakes, imitation crab (only bummer), squid, and fish fillets. The Peking pork chops (6.95) are massive and plenty. I wish they were more crisp. The fried battering gets soft quicker than the ones at other restaurants. The bonus of being connected to the Vietnamese restaurant is that I can order a che ba mau. They make my favorite version in Vegas. I recently had a bad experience with this dessert at a different place, but Capital restored my faith.

We were seated right away and given a few minutes to look over the menu. They not only serve Chinese food, but they also serve Vietnamese food from the place next door. I'm assuming it's the same owner. The Vietnamese for consists of your typical spring rolls, egg rolls, pho and traditional rice dishes. We decided to just stick with the Chinese food since that's what we were craving. 

// FOOD // 
French style beef: I always love this dish. It has such great flavor and it's so tender. They make this dish extremely well here! It comes out on a bed of raw onions and a few slices of tomato. 4.5/5

Fried tofu: Can't go wrong with something that's fried. They serve it here with a light soy sauce and a sweet and sour sauce. It comes out nice and crispy and I believe it came with 8 pieces. 4/5

Shrimp in lobster sauce: This was probably the most disappointing dish out of them all. It didn't have any flavor and still lacked flavor even when we added soy sauce and white pepper to it. 2/5

Black mushroom with bok choy: Your typical vegetable dish. The mushrooms were light and had a great texture to them. The bok choy was cooked perfectly as well. 3.5/5

Beef chow fun: Your typical beef chow fun. Can't go wrong with a noodle dish. 4/5

I don't know my servers name, however she (a younger female) was knowledgeable and pleasant. My meal which consisted of pho, and crispy spring rolls, which is my favorite. There is usually a gentleman at the register, but I didn't see him today. I wanted to thank him for his suggestiions of my take out lunch the last time I was in. It was a hit!  OK that's it for the pleasantries. There was a little short grumpy women, who has never waited on me before. My bill was $17 and I left a $3 tip on the table. When I stopped at the cashier to pay my bill, the little short grumpy women asked me if I had cash. I said ""sorry, I don't have anymore cash on me"" The little short grumpy women, then rang everything and applied the balance to my debit card. I still had to sign my receipt. When I handed it back to her, she turned the receipt toward me and asked ""No tip!""? I looked at her a little confused at first, but replied ""I left it on the table"". Now my blood pressure is rising, and I wanted to say a few things to her, for insulting me. I decided Yelp would be a better way to go. She also reprimanded a young man (I believe he's new) in their language about the number of place settings on the table. I don't know his name either, but he wore black framed glasses and worked the room with the younger female server. You could tell by the expression on his face, that he was a little embarrassed, since she yeld across the room. 

Well the little short grumpy older woman ruined my lunch. I thought about her condescending remark to me all the way home. Hopefully she is not the owner, because she should be a bus person only. This same little short grumpy older women borrowed the hot sauce from my table. She didn't ask, but she did say hello as a distraction while she had to reach pass  me to get it.When the little short grumpy older women retuned the hot sauce it literally was a drive-by. It startled me to see the hot sauce sliding across my table like a baseball player sliding into home plate. She never broke her stride, and never looked back.

I've been eating lunch/early dinner here since 2004, and as much as I really love the food, I haven't decided if I will ever go back. I don't eat Pho anywhere but here.

First of all, the place is LOUD, with big groups of boisterous business types and crying babies. Service is a tad slow too. 

The lobster was good but not equal to the California version. This one has a less buttery flavor, is a bit spicier and with a lot of pepper. We ordered a Thai style seafood soup that could have used more flavor as they seem to skimp on the ginger, galangal and lemongrass.

The mung bean dessert was great. It's not a universal favorite but I'm always happy to eat 2 or 3 bowls of it when others decide to skip it.

Ordered the seafood platter, roasted duck and a plate of veggies to share for a party of five.

Seafood platter barely had any seafood - shrimp I could count on one hand and had imitation crab meat and fish cakes. Not what I was expecting from a seafood platter. Also the whole dish was loaded with white cabbage. 

The duck itself looked like it was mauled and the presentation was bad. Skin also was not crispy and not cleaned properly - had hairs still on the skin. Inedible and some parts were tough. I had roasted duck before in Philly and other parts of California and this doesn't compare.

The reason why I am giving this place a one star review has to be the service. The service is the icing on the cake: tea pot was empty and never refilled until the end of our meal when they started dessert. Also, the duck came extremely late - to the point of where we finished all of the other plates and the roasted duck came out. When we questioned why it was late, we were given a ""Oh, other places cook at different times we take longer"". Since we were quite full and sick of waiting at this point we wanted half a duck.
