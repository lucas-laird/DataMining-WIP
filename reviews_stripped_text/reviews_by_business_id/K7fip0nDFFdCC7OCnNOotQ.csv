The drinks were okay (I can't complain too much because they were free) and it was insanely crowded everywhere we went. One of my friends practically got body-checked by a bouncer while trying to make a path for a bunch of cocktail waitresses holding champagne bottles to get through. The view of the fountains kind of makes up for the overcrowding. This was the first place of the night we went to, and we stayed for about an hour. The music was good, but it was way too crowded. It's definitely awesome to see the fountains (which went off more often than I thought), but I'm not sure I'd be back for the late night club part.",iQgm7ZCSuyWklP8fsUDfcA,0,0,4,ZU03Yp4no5RyIIpqlu-1VQ

Loved dancing in this area as the cool air prevented us from getting too sweaty.  

As others have mentioned, Hyde is much smaller than the other Vegas megaclubs, but that didn't detract from the party atmosphere.  The crowd here is more upscale, which I fully appreciated.

Casino security and Hyde security were totally unhelpful. They basically said this happens all the time and there's nothing they could do. Adding insult to injury Bellagio security said maybe she lost it and it will turn up tomorrow. Casino security also said the club is rented by SBE and Bellagio has nothing to do with what goes on there. Since the club is full of cameras it's unclear why they were unwilling to be helpful.

When we got to the bar at the same time as another man, the short, blond bartender waited on the man first. Already a bad sign. We ultimately ordered our drinks and asked the bartender  for a stronger drink and said we would give her a generous tip.

Instead they let some ugly girls in the club before us. I can understand letting in girl groups but the girls they were letting in were just ugly, ugly dress and sandals?

We waited an hour and asked the promoter Richie are we getting in or not? He said that from the looks of it No. The bouncer told my friend that these guys pick and choose who they want to get in. It doesn't matter if you are on a guest list or if your party is an even ratio. They said if you want to get in  you can pay them $100 to get you in plus the cover fee.

Either way, we were getting in for free, they had an open bar for the ladies until 1 am and he gave us additional drink tickets. Its close to midnight and we're thinking, this is going to be great! 
  As we walk down the hall, we hear the beat of the music, see the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and we get excited. Then we round the corner into the club and are immediately met with blinding strobe lights, the pungent smell of sweating bodies and liquor, along with a wall of people. Oh, and the obnoxiously loud sound of the bass, since all they play is techno, house music. We should have just left there. But we had free drinks and we were going to get them! So we slowly made our way through the crowd to the bar (which is in the back of the club) and got our free drinks, and you could taste the cheap liquor! This is the stuff that will have you feeling awful the next day.
  With drinks in hand, we meander over to the ""dance area"" since there isn't really a dance floor, and find a tiny section to stand and sway in (isn't room for anything else). But after 2 ""songs"" of bass that you can feel through your body, the constant strobe lights, body heat and cheap alcohol, we all felt sick and called it quits. This place was awful!

399080,2015-02-09,0,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"By far the worst clubbing experience I've ever had and I've been to my fair share of Vegas clubs.  

Let's start with the TWO positive things about this place.
1) The drinks were pretty strong and were free because a lady outside the club gave each of us a free drink coupon for signing up to their email list.
2) The music had a great mix of top 40 and hip hop.

Now on to the negative aspects of the club...
1) The people checking us in were giving us such a hard time for being guys...  Listen buddy, there may be 2 guys in the group but there were TWELVE girls!  I don't care if they were joking, it made us uncomfortable and turned me off about the club. Not funny at all, maybe try and act more professionally next time since you are representing the club and hotel. Horrible customer service...
2) The ""dancefloor"" is a sliver of a hallway surrounded by all of these roped off areas.  The layout is horrible and confusing.  How do you get to the bar?  Oh you have to go to the dimly lit hallway on the far end of the club past all the tables.  There was one point in the night where I turned to my friend and asked ""How do we even get up to the bar?!?!?""
3) The bouncers act like they are kings of the club for some reason.  I tried going to the table where my friends were to go dance with them.  Next thing I know I feel a finger jabbing against my shoulder pushing me back and almost making me fall over.  Apparently the table where my friends were was a ""girls table"" and we weren't allowed to be with them...  What does a ""girls table"" even mean?  He then proceeded to shoo me away.  I could not believe the rude behavior from the so called club professionals.
4) For some reason they think it's a good idea to turn the lights completely on for seconds at a time giving everyone a nice view of all of the sweaty faces in the crowd.  There' a reason why clubs are dark...  It's so people can have fun dancing without anyone seeing.  The bright light made people in my group really uncomfortable because everyone's smudgy makeup was visible. (Haha)

I will not be returning unless they somehow fire everyone who works there (besides the bartenders since they made some pretty strong drinks).  The layout needs to change so it doesn't come off as pretentious and pretending to be classy.  And last but not least, the bouncers need to back off and not act like hawks every 5 feet in the club. I know it's their job but it made me feel uncomfortable knowing that someone was watching me the whole time we were there.  I would NEVER pay to get into this place.  Now I know why there so many people with clipboards desperate for party goers to go to the club.  It also makes sense why I've never heard of this trainwreck of a club.  1 out 5 stars only because I'm not able to rate it 0 stars.",LCyA2V_4aqJLQTevOAUtKw,2,0,1,TvCUhK4CdWng6hBbw9hVGA

The club was fun, but I have never experienced such overt racism in my life. I was about to have a panic attack so I hurried out of the club, and one of the security guards asked, ""Well, if you didn't do anything wrong, why did you run?""

It was chilling and humiliating, and I don't want anyone else to experience that. No. One.",qxlP4Nuyg3eGc7PdCep7qg,14,0,1,m_f7lbSLDug8BSNS8BIEtQ

A bouncer approached us and asked if we would like to go to a table. There was a great group of men and women who welcomed us. We sipped champagne and danced the night away.
The DJ was so much fun, he let us up to the booth for awhile. The staff made sure that we were always taken care of. At one point the manager even came with a stack of cash and let us throw it from the top of the stage!
The only incident I noticed that night was group of about three girls got into a brawl. The bouncers noticed immediately, took care of the issue and escorted them out before most people even knew what happened.

500211,2013-05-13,3,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"This review is for their ""Club"" mode on the weekends:

In our early 30's, we are past are clubbing days for the most part but enjoy good music and some drinks.  Just finishing a game of Craps, we walked past Hyde and were given some discount tickets from one of the bouncers so we figured why not?  We only waited a couple of minutes to get it but that was annoying as there were like 10 people waiting behind their fancy pretentious red ropes.  I wasn't willing to wait much longer anyhow and how the hell does anyone wait an hour or more?  Really?  Don't you have anything better to do with your lives than wait an hour to get in and pay $2k for bottle service?  

This place is really small and lots of the space is dedicated to table service (so all you making $70k can feel like you're rich) but the women are very attractive as are the servers and dancers so no complaints there.  The drinks are expensive like everything else in vegas - $14 for a mid-level liquor (Absolute, Captain, etc) but poured strong especially after a good tip.

Music:  They had a good DJ (no clue who) who really kept the party going with great remixes of very new music.  My complaint is that their sound engineer must've had bottle service too as even 8-drinks in I could hear the horrendous distortion as they pushed their speakers beyond the limit.

We have some great clubs in Atlanta that have more space, better prices, no waits, and better looking women (although they were quite nice here).  But I guess this is Vegas where everyone can be a VIP for a price.",ATVL40mU7-hqJGJEZjzn3A,2,1,3,1OuiZkEF-SnEQrAd83U6dA

Keep in mind that we showed up at 10:00. Bar tenders are attentive & very polite. Occasionally you'll see the dancers walking around offering free shots & if you take one make sure you tip them. Trust me, if you tip they will keep coming. You can either tip $2 for a shot or pay $10 for the sane shot at the bar. Hyde  has a sophisticated, laid back feel to it. The dancers are beautiful & security was really nice. I approached one to ask where the restrooms were & he personally walked me to it.

First off, it's a shit show just trying to get in! That's understandable, but the line that was not being monitored or controlled what so ever, so if you are waiting in line another group of people can pile in and just cut you off. They say there is an ""open bar"" but nope, you receive just a couple drink tickets that work for the cheapest liquor or champagne available and there's a cut off time that varies on who you talk to! 
On top of that ....the bartenders are extremely rude when you try to use your drink tickets which makes you not even want to redeem them. What's the point of offering ""free"" drinks if your server has the worst attitude when it's time to serve us?! 
The promoters have no pull at all either. Useless.
Bouncers are rude and biased as can be! 
My group and I waited pretty long to get in and before we can even enter the building I was escorted out for no reason and heard a bouncer tell another to ""not let me in""! 
When I asked what happened he said ""nothing"" 
So for no reason I couldn't enter? 
Well I was let back in by someone else anyways LOL and wow, all I can say is WOW! 
The club is smaller than a shoe box and overly crowded. It was like maximum capacity and then some. Bouncers flashing light in your face to move but yet there's no where to move? 
They need to get some control and clarity in the way they run their business and treat their clients!

I have to say this is a hidden gem inside of the Bellagio! We visted this amazing place around 8-ish when it was still a lounge. The door man was very nice and cracked a few jokes while checking our ID's which made us all walk in with smiles. Went straight to the bar and ordered a round of drinks and sat at a table. The drinks were strong and delicious! We then flagged down a very nice server who was great! Can't remember her name though :/ I decided to order a bottle of champagne and an appetizer which we were all very satisfied with! Later on my sister came to join us and we enjoyed a few more cocktails. 
THE BEST PART I must say is the EPIC view of the Bellagio fountains! You're so close  to the action that you literally feel the mist from the water!

Last night after spending $5k+ on 2tables, my boyfriend and I left happy & holding hands.

Immediately after we left, they grabbed my boyfriend and accused him of grabbing ""A guys neck"" but the security guard couldn't think of who's neck had been grabbed when I asked him 3 times.

Also that's impossible, he was still holding my hand.  

Later the small security guard who had made the fabricated the story all the sudden decided it was a security guard's neck that had been grabbed...interesting. 
If he had somehow grabbed a security guards neck( while holding my hand which is impossible)... They would have tackled us to the ground before we left & would have been escorted out. This is so bogus

They knew I was the only witness & that this entire story was fabricated, so they Hyde security made me leave immediately so that I could not give the cops a statement for the report. 

Then they took him to lock up where they lied to the cops & he was beaten.  

I WAS TERRIFIED that I would get ROBBED OR RAPED walking all the way back to my hotel ALONE and I asked if someone could please Walk Me there Safely, but they said no & demanded I leave. They said if I didn't leave, I would be in trouble too. 

WHILE he was in Lock up, he audio recorded his conversation & 2 small girls were brought in while he was recording... Also from HYDE. 

These girls were BEATEN by 3 big male violent HYDE security guards, one had a BLOODY FACE& they KNOCKED Her TEETH OUT!!

this is just one example from one night at Hyde... This is how they regularly treat high rollers at the Bellagio.

The club is smaller compared to other nightclubs I've been to in Vegas. Like others have said, it's more of a lounge than a club. There's not too many places you can stand and dance because it's mainly roped off for the VIP seats. Because of the VIP seats, we had to walk up and around them just to get to the bar. We had free passes for vodka drinks which were watered down in my opinion (that's why I always have my own drinks before clubbing).

I thought for sure Ms. Everdeen was going to bust into the place and start a revolution!  I couldn't help but feel completely oppressed and belittled by the atmosphere and vibe this club gives off.

The Tuesday night started out with a decent line; but with a contact we were able to get in with little issue.  The cover; a bit steep, but considering it's location, not unreasonable ($40 for guys; $20 for girls (another injustice; but accepted by default).  At this point; Hyde has already put themselves at a disadvantage.  More money at the door means less money for drinks; less drinks means less fun, and more sobriety; more sobriety means less willingness to spend a fortune on drinks.

Speaking of drinks; prepare yourself for $18/ drink.  Going with a large crew; prepare yourself to spend a fortune, or not drink at all.  My 'crew' was fully prepared to spend money to have a good time; but after a few rounds of drinks it was apparent 'our kind' wasn't the target consumer.

I understand the concept of table/ bottle service; but their is an injustice to those who aren't capable of spending $1000 a bottle to 'enjoy the night'.  Be prepared to feel as though you're constantly in the way.  Not being able to spend $1000 on bottle service, there is little to no area for you to stand or dance.  You're practically crammed into a hall way with all the other 'common folk' starring at the 'box' of one percent'rs spending thousands of dollars to over indulge.

It was by far the most degrading situation I've been apart of.  Leaving; we all made comments to one another; and the one that stands out the most was:

""It was like we spent hundreds to watch 'rich people' spend thousands; so they could have fun... like a weird twisted game, as if they were getting off on knowing we were watching.""

Perhaps it was the night; or the club in general.  Either way, there was no accommodation for those who live practically; but still want to enjoy the night life.  The only decent thing of the night was DJ Spider; although with nowhere to dance we couldn't fully enjoy it.",IPBtFIasrRcZO2yya2Q38w,14,2,1,8AWJz2EhIpW8P-AhYKOrmg

- They have good drinks - strong! 
- If you can get to the back where the windows are, there is an amazing view.

CONS: 
- Bouncer was a douche (not unusual I guess) 
- Place is not big and incredibly crowded - barely walking room - but it was the Mayweather fight weekend, so that's probably why :) 
- There isn't really a ""dance floor"". It's an odd layout that isn't open, but choked by way too many private booths and walkways, so people are just dancing wherever.

5 stars for Tuesday Industry night (we got countless free drink tickets and the promoter even told our group we could come back any time and see one of the bouncers to get more tickets, sweet!).

5 stars for the awesome DJ even on a Tuesday night (though from this first Vegas experience it seems like this city's weekday nights are still like Saturday night).

If you get there early then you might even be able to score a spot sitting down near the fountains in the lounge area which you'll need to rest your heels in prep for the dance floor. This was perfect for our group, and I imagine most groups of friends, who meet up in Vegas to catch up a bit before the night really begins.

Free drink tickets being given out like crazy has amongst many possible cons, one that I found particularly annoying and relevant to our groups main goal of dancing --and that is that free drinks makes for a sticky, sticky dance floor.

So you pay to have the table, but they don't rope it off (I'm talking the club kind which just tells people ""this ain't community space--these people paid"". 

From LA to NY to LV, we've never experienced such a thing.

Soooo, as we sat there, trying to sip our expensive cocktails at the table we paid for, strangers kept coming up and SITTING ON OUR COUCH! Also, people kept PUTTING THEIR DRINKS ON OUR TABLE! 

Staff repeatedly saw this and did nothing. I can't believe this is a Sam Nazarian property. Totally unworthy of his name, and the Bellagio experience. 

NEVER, EVER pay for a table or bottle service at this dump. Your table and seats will be used as community space by strangers because the Hyde does not follow basic club/lounge etiquette to take steps to let people know that particular coveted space has been paid for and not common area.

I can't even begin to say how disappointed I was with this place. I had family coming into town so I called to get on the 'guest list'. The girl who answered said it was no cover charge for girls as long as we were on the list. The time frame was 10pm to midnight, so we got there at about 10:20(I wanted to avoid huge crowds). Also, one of their promoters sent me a text earlier in the day asking me to send him a message when we had arrived to he could 'take care' of us. 

Ok, so like I said we arrived there at about 10:20pm, I notified the promoter who had contacted me and received a text back saying I was all set to just give my name at the door. The crowd wasn't huge yet so I had no problem going right up to the front of the line. I immediately let one of the guys know that I was on the guest list with 4 girls total, he said we'd have to be checked off and it would be a few minutes. As we're waiting there, other girls/groups who had gotten there after us were getting in before us!! I approached different security people and promoters who all just brushed me off and told me to wait. 

By this time it's like 11:00pm, I've been waiting for almost an hour and my patience is running really thin. Girls are getting in left and right with free drink tickets and I'm just being ignored and brushed off. At 11:30 after an hour and a half of patiently waiting we leave. I texted the 'promoter' a short  text about how his guest list is crap.

Just to make it clear, I expected to wait...it was free! But i NEVER expected to get the treatment I did. I was highly offended and I will NEVER again set foot at this club.

I feel like this place has the potential of a 4 star, but I can't in good conscience give it more than a 3.  I'll update my review when they get their service in order.

Let me preface this with the fact that I am a relatively patient person when it comes to flaws in service.  I've worked in retail and know it can be hard to juggle customers.  But the complete lack of service from our waitress was just not forgivable.  

We waited 15 minutes after being seated for someone to come take our drink orders.  After coming to the realization that no one was coming, we flagged down a server who said he would take our order to our waitress.  Our waitress, who was hanging out all the while, came over a bit after to confirm our order and pretend like she was doing something.

The server came back with our drinks after a pretty long wait and apologized, saying that our drinks took a particularly long time to make because there was something wrong with the computer.  My guess is that there was actually something wrong with the waitress.  

The cocktails were delicious and the view just behind the Bellagio fountains very nearly justified the bad service.  Note that I said nearly.

The waitress brought us the check for the first round of drinks and promptly disappeared.  We wanted to order another round but of course she was no where to be found.  We flagged down the poor server again, who was a good sport about it considering it wasn't his job.  But after a while the waitress came over and rather impolitely informed us we would have to pay for the first round before receiving the second.  Because of course we're gonna jump the barrier into the fountains after we down the second round, right?  Well whatever, we pay cash and expect to get change back to sort out the tip.  BUT THE WAITRESS DOESN'T GIVE BACK A DIME.  We were intending to give her a 15% tip and she took over 20%.  I was a bit taken back by the poor etiquette.

After we got our second round, she gave us the check and came back around 3 times to check if we were ready to pay, at 5 minute intervals.  What kind of service is this?!  Honey, your big fake boobs can only get you so many tips -- you need to learn the basics of service if you're going to appeal to ALL your clientele.  On the last round, we tipped her 10% then handed the server who helped us extra on he way out the door.  I know it's rude, but if you split the difference between the extra she basically stole from the last round and consider how bad the service was, I think it was justified.  Either way, I can live with it.

I wanted to devote most of the space in this review to talking about how flavorful their cocktails are and how amazing the view is!  But the service just ruined it.  I hope I'll have something more favorable to say when I come back for the nightclub in June.",x3NLF32dUj-IcjiZuYW4bQ,12,4,3,VZJh0F4mrmEMdy0e4-Fmfg

Table service doesn't start until 10:30, so you can sit and there are waitresses before then.  The Bellagio fountains are easily viewable from the club, which was a nice bonus.  We tried several of their signature cocktails, all of which were very good and obviously devised by a talented mixologist. The Bloody Sand with scotch and sangrita was my favorite, but the mojito-esque cocktail was also tasty.  We also tried one with berries and brandy, I think.  All of them were ~$18 but the ambiance and views made it worth it, at least prior to 10:30...  

At 10:30, the club changes from a rather relaxed space to a rather uptight, exclusive bar. You have to pay for bottle service to have a seat.  The dress code gets stricter and almost all the chicks were wearing very, very short tight dresses. Didn't see another gal in pants or slacks...It was enjoyable earlier in the evening but as the night wore on, the music got too loud for conversation and the room started filing up so we decided to leave.

As we exited, there was a long line of people waiting to enter (even though there was plenty of space inside). We asked about getting our free drink vouchers so we could have 1 more round prior to departing, but the door man said we had to get in the back of the line if we wanted the vouchers.  We decided to head out instead.

Minus 1 start because:
I had been talking to a promoter who kinda flaked last minute, said he would get me in contact with another promoter who never got in contact with me and I showed up the night of and I wasn't on the list. Luckily the guy at the door was super nice and said he would take care of us but my first impression is that whoever is in charge of the promoters needs to tell the promoters to get their shit straight because it was really unprofessional. Also, there were 2 girls dressed in bunny and penguin mascot uniforms..that really threw me off. It looked super trashy, this isn't Chuck E Cheese Bellagio. At one point in the night they were also dancing on the little areas where the go go dancers usually dance and it seriously killed the mood.

HOWEVER, the music was great. the space itself is super tiny and if you don't have bottle service you're pretty much confined to dancing in walkways but who cares if you're drunk and with a great group a people and the music is good too you're not even paying attention to all these things.

The girls were dancing with the guys when the bouncer asked them to leave.

1986284,2018-01-20,6,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"Visited Hyde Bellagio for the first time last Wednesday Night. I didn't like the crowd at all. Everyone was on the older side, (mid-40s-to early 50s). I felt suppppppper young and out of place. Total sausage fest, business guys all in suits. Totally awkward, most guys could have been my dad's age. Lol.

My friend, DJ Serafin was spinning that night, so my husband and I came to support. If he wasn't spinning that night, we wouldn't have ever thought to visit Hyde. The actually dance floor area was super small. They had more bottle service tables than actual dance space, this was annoying. It's like you had to have a table to have dance space. Also, the ONE bar that was open was super crowded and didn't have a good sense of order. People kept cutting, seriously? How rude. 

Drinks were Vegas Club Prices; my 1 Jamo ginger was $12 in a short glass. The bouncers in the front did provide ""free drink tickets"" except they were only redeemable for champagne and a vodka well drink. I don't drink either, I'm a whiskey girl. 

With the weird crowd and no dance space, it was hard for me to enjoy myself. Luckily, since Serafin was spinning I was able to dance on stage and kick it with our DJ friends. I also enjoyed seeing the water show in the background but if you didn't have bottle service access- you couldn't get pics since the tables were along the water.

2002527,2011-12-30,6,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"One of the upsides of seeing a club/lounge at a preview is that you have the opportunity to see the space at it's best: Just furnished, that subtle nervousness in the air, even with an occasional comp'd open bar, and brand new staff.  (We could smell the paint on the walls!)  This is the perfect time to do a review of this latest in the chain of lounge/club properties of Hyde, a venue owned by the SBE group offers, what they claim, is the ultimate in ""exclusive socializing.""  I'm not quite sure what that is but the crowd was a mixed group for the Preview Night on December 29th to select groups, VIPs, and then some.

First of all, Hyde Lounge isn't completely sure what it wants to be.  The decor is a cream/black/chrome color scheme that works on a basic level.  It's not dazzling, but it's simple and offers rows of books, artifacts, and glitzy jewelery in little alcoves, shelves, and small rooms.  (I don't know if this is going to make way or is in fact a very simple boutique type thought put into the club, but it would work well with the concept they're working.)  This is a -lounge- and I don't know if this was for the preview, (which I'm questioning as Paul Oakenfold is slated to be the New Year's Eve guest DJ) but it had a dance floor and was jamming like a -club.-  While I could go on and on about how Vegas has very much killed the term ""ultra-club"" by adding chrome and mirrors and about twenty yards of sheer fabrics as well as 9x9 foot space that they purport to be a dance floor everywhere to signify this space, this is pretty much your standard fare of said term.  While it was -nice-, it wasn't mindblowing or really anything new.

What IS to be applauded is the completely open-air, gorgeous windows to the fountain show and Lake Bellagio.  If you are going to Hyde, PLEASE get there before midnight to catch the fountain show from the back.  It's a gorgeous view and something that is truly special.  

Also, having DJ88 is to be applauded, as well.  Having a local, talented DJ who had some terrific jams going on, (Work it out girl!), is just awesome.  

The ""dance floor"" is abstract, as once it thinned out a bit, it was manageable but it's hardly fit for the ratio of booths vs. space on the dance floor, etc.

The entrance/exit flow had a LOT of people confused.  There needs to be more signage for individuals to figure out how to get out.  Those in search of the egress were heading to the entrance to be pointed in the completely opposite direction.  Not clear signage.  

Watched a group of people at the door, who were PROMISED entry into the club by Bellagio President, Randy Morton, get told the club was at capacity and had ten minutes until closing to go away while they let the wreck of a ""DJ"" Pauly D waltz in with his equally garish entourage.  Thanks, bouncers, you're an outstanding bunch.  (Although I will say inside the club, one on one, staff was very friendly including security.  No one hassled me for hanging out by the entrance, waiting for friends to get in.  

While the crowd was very mixed (ranging from a guy in a zoot-suit, to guys in t-shirts/jeans, to a guy with his hair in Pippi Longstocking-esque braids), I'm curious as to if the lounge will keep it's doors open to such a wide range of styles or if it will go back to the standard fare of normal club fare.  I'd be thrilled if it went for welcoming over-the top artisan styles, but we'll see.  

The bottom line is that I'm a little sad because before this was the Fontana Club, which offered live bands on a stage, a beautiful patio to sit and drink while watching the fountains, and it was very classic Vegas.  Ultra-lounges are a dime a dozen at a myriad of properties and frankly, this one offers nothing new:  It is a desperate move to pull more money in and it's attracting a crowd that isn't very Bellagio nor what Wynn would have allowed on his property.  But go ahead, MGM, continue to turn the Bellagio into another typical casino, one space at a time.  The next space is a Light Group lounge, Bloom?  Fantastic.  Can't wait for the obnoxious bouncers, velvet ropes, booming music, and pretentious atmosphere.

Will this be here five years from now?  Who knows.  Clubs and lounges come and go in Vegas.  Only the evolving and the strong stay.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,15,5,3,sZhJ24-FH78zBsRKnmwTDw

We were pleasantly surprised wit the setting inside and how much space there was.

Overall the service was pretty good - of course it could have been better as we did wait like 15 minutes to order and then another 15 to get the check.  Just slow, not surprising considering there was a private party that probably spent enough to garner personal treatment; so really it wouldn't normally have been that big of a deal if we didn't have dinner reservations to make.

The drinks were good - but I need to caveat this with the fact that we only ordered a single cocktail and beer.  So not the best sampling to go from.  Of course, they were good enough that the next time I'm (we're) back in Vegas this will likely be a stop!",SykFoD1kxIbd2OYij8JJqw,0,0,4,QGQlZEDjY2l9n5q35CvAdQ

It doesn't get too packed here and the crowd seems to be a little older than the more popular night clubs. Drink prices are decent. One night we went, there was a magician performing over by one of the bars. I was absolutely mind blown. The view overlooking the water and fountains is spectacular and it's also great when you need some fresh air after dancing for a while. Hyde might not have the appeal of an XS, Marquee, or Hakkasan, and it certainly isn't for everyone, but it's been perfect for me the times that I've gone.",IJ-8pnPsS4z9NCigimoylw,1,1,5,F9o1C7eY7JpyGWIE_ak4Kg
2073997,2014-08-13,1,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"First off, the best way to ensure a great experience at this nightclub is by having a bottle service.  This place is quite small so reserving a table in advance secures more room to dance especially on a jam-packed weekend.  Floor plan is also well thought out so you and your guests won't be disappointed wherever you end up being seated; either inside near the DJ booth or outside with one of the best views of the strip next to the Bellagio fountain.

I seriously don't understand why so many people bash on this place since I've never really had a bad time here.  On my last visit, I decided to drop by solo around midnight to meet up with a group of friends that were already inside the club.  Being a Saturday night, I was apprehensive of even trying as the chances of getting in alone is quite slim.  However, I was quickly picked out of the huge crowd and was even escorted to my friends' table near the DJ booth.  What impressed me the most was how that same promoter kept coming back throughout the night to make sure our group was well taken care of.

Overall, Hyde Bellagio is definitely an excellent choice if you're looking to party all night.  Something about the crowd in this club that always give off a great atmosphere.  This is also one of the few joints left in the valley that actually plays hip-hop so it's always a good breather from EDM whenever I find myself here.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,2,3,4,l6E9RPOcGwsH4m-7WaUckQ

I think they want this place to be more high class, so if you want to dance you have to get a table or find a small area to dance. We ended up dancing in this small walkway area which was great for the two of us. 

Because it was a Tuesday night and Hyde was the only club only, I think they decided to charge everyone extra. It was $30 for women, $60 for men. 

The music was pop, hip hop, and some other things. It seemed like it was a good variety of different types of music.",sGfaR8ZM1cjOl866lizsKQ,0,0,3,hQUNBgBOgEHFvbe2Lo5wdw

The music was great, and we had a good time. 

The only other issues we had were minor ones: 

1) We had a table on the outside portion of the club- and the ceiling fans weren't working! It made for a pretty hot (not in a good way) time, especially since we were dancing.

2) The cocktail waitress wasn't all that speedy or attentive. We made our own drinks several times because she was nowhere to be found.

We arranged to have a table on the patio through Kelly (the bachelorette coordinator) and requested a specific table... she made it happen! We had the best table in the house... dead center right over the lake... this was AWEOME. I just wish that was all we had done. 

We had set up for a prefix menu of small plates and apps... our waitress seemed to have no idea of this. Once she was made aware, we all had one of their signature drinks. Ugh I would not recommend them... I had a mango jalapeño drink (seems hard to mess up that killer duo) basically it was just mango juice. I couldnt taste the jalapeno, bitters OR alcohol. When I said I couldnt taste any alcohol... she took it to the bar and came back and said ""well they said it was the standard pour"" really? Helpful, thanks. This is just bad customer service. Seriously just add a splash and make the customer happy. There were 5 of us... no one liked their drinks. 

The appetizers were ok at best. The best thing we had was little caprese crustini or something like that... that was pretty good.. but nothing else was too great. We were supposed to get churros with our menu... she said she was putting the order in, they never came. Honestly our waitress was pretty terrible. I will not be going back here.

Here's the key: This place is a restaurant right up until 10 PM.  So if you're being particularly cheap (and quite honestly in Vegas, you have to cut corners where possible), get there around 9:30-9:45 PM, wait for them to convert to a club, get the re-entry stamp, and LOL at everyone in the line trying to get in while you go hit the poker room and come back at 12 AM.  Honestly, there's no reason to pay for it if you don't have to.

Aside from that, it looks nice for a lounge.  The location has probably been talked to death about, but it's pretty nice to have an open breeze (during summer only, obviously) and a straight view of the Bellagio fountains at night.  Aside from that, drinks aren't cheap...it is what it is.  You'd hope you can get cheaper because it's not a club, but HA not meant to be.

P.S. And you never know who you'll see here.  I'm looking at some ugly-looking dude talking to some hot Asian VIP waitress, and my friend swears he's looking at Mesut Özil (for those uninformed, he plays for Real Madrid and Germany).  I'm like...dude, NO WAY that's Özil.  Five minutes later, I'm next to homie's table drinking my RBV, look over at him with his Avatar-bug eyes staring back at me, and I'm like ""Holy SHIT, that IS Özil!""  Well, least that made my night worth it hah.  On a side note, for a top-level footballer, I've never seen a guy chain smoke so much lol.",aXuxyyTDs5RGoFrhajPLYg,4,4,3,dyBEaPArh5UBWaUqbOv68g

It's not a huge club (compared to many of the mega-clubs at the other hotels), but the night that I was there it was pretty packed.

There wasn't a good place where anyone else could see the fountain, other than those tables... of course I found a way to get in there to get my photo :)

The decor was nice, the DJ was decent. I was pretty confused by the outfits of the go-go girls.  I understand trying to be different, but I felt like random props, w/ no meaning were thrown into these outfits, that didn't mimic a theme or purpose. An example is a medicine mask that doctors used to use during the time of the black plague...

The patio opens up to the Bellagio fountains, and even in the heat of June, they keep enough AC going to keep it cool enough. The waitresses seem to be going for quality than quantity of service. They seem spend a lot of time with each table so it can be slow when they're not at your table. You can get great service though, each time we've been the server wasn't just shuttling orders in one direction and drinks in another, they knew something about drinks and had opinions when asked.

Hyde specializes in expensive signature drinks that change every few months (except for the Belini's they always have those) but if you want something in particular (like a suggestion for scotch, or real margarita instead of the cucumber thing they had last time) just ask and they'll either get you what you want or do their best to figure out the right substitute. As an example, I wanted a  Jameson and coffee to keep me up (I'm old and need caffeine to stay up past 11pm). They don't have coffee, but our waitress Bree wasn't giving up. They have espresso, so she offered some ideas using that, or to get a coffee from the restaurant next door. We landed on an Americano with Jameson, and she made it clear I she wasn't charging me if I didn't like it. 

They have some appetizer/tapas type plates from 5pm until some time before 10pm (no idea when food actually stops, I just know we tried to get food at 10 and couldn't), the sliders were excellent.

2482129,2016-06-16,6,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"TLDR: Bad atmosphere, bad music, really dirty.


Came by here on our first night of Vegas (Friday). We weren't really planning on going clubbing and just stopped by to check out how long the line was. Because of that, most of us were just wearing Tshirts and sneakers. Surprisingly, there was no line, and the bouncer was completely OK with letting us in. He even comped the girls. Due to our initial excitement of getting into a ""high -end"" Vegas club so easily, I failed to recognize all this as a bad sign.

After we went in, we pushed past the crowd to eventually get to a more open area. On the way at least three drinks were splashed on me. The rest of the night, I was sprayed with countless other drinks. It got to a point where I couldn't stand on one patch of floor for too long because my shoes would start sticking to it (disgusting). I know that most clubs will have some drink spillage, but this was on a ridiculous level. On top of that the DJ was absolutely horrible. There were several times, during the middle of a song he would stop MID BEAT to scream something intelligible at us. MID BEAT and he would always do it just as the song starts ramping up. You're supposed to wait for a natural pause or just before a drop to add to the anticipation NOT MID BEAT. They could have just put on a YouTube playlist and it would have been better. It got to a point where, as soon as I started to somewhat enjoy myself, a drink would spill on me, or the music would stop.

I appreciate the bouncer letting us in, but I think that helped them more than it helped us. In hindsight I know why there was absolutely no line here, the place was a shit show. And to Hyde, please hire someone with a basic understanding of how music works. Or, at the very least, get someone who isn't an alien trying to understand humanity by measuring our response to extreme disappointment.",TwE-aWryPrO8rrxAN4UMgw,4,2,2,h5AwsmTDU9KkWlvPXhtidw

Hyde is a beautiful venue! It was extra special walking into the club and seeing the gorgeous and dramatic up-close view of the Bellagio fountain show going on in the backdrop. If you stand right at the balcony during the fountain show, you might get misted on! But it was fun! 

We were on the free guest list and arrived early, around 10:40pm on a Saturday night. The line wasn't too long at all, probably a 10 minute wait at most. As the evening progressed, the place got packed! It's very tight quarters inside with a tiny dance floor and not much space to dance. Definitely arrive early in order to enjoy the venue. 

The music was your typical club hip hop. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that really got me in the mood to dance. 

The bouncers here were a step above in the professional department, unlike Hakkasan. Some of the bouncers were helpful and friendly, some where indifferent, but none were blatantly rude.

However, the bartenders were insultingly rude to my girlfriends. We were at the back bar that's closer to the bathrooms, and my friends had a few 'free guest-list drink tickets', they asked the bartender questions about what types of drinks we could get with them, but the bartender was unnecessarily nasty and replied with some serious snarky attitude and spoke to them like they were deaf wild animals. She also threw their ID's at them since she felt that she wasn't going to get a tip. Unfortunately, we were all super over that lady and didn't get her name, but she was blond and had a boy cut/short hair.

The promoters scour the Bellagio during the day for ladies to let in for free, then charge an arm and a leg for the boys to come in and slobber. Dancing is difficult since the dance areas are the walkways between the seating areas. The music is insanely loud.

Warning and Notice of Danger to yourself if you enter this club.  My sister, who was celebrating her 21st Birthday party, and her two female friends and I were invited to enter Hyde by their representative and to have free drinks.  We accepted the invitation since we were Guests at Bellagio. We were inside the club for a couple of hours when a security guard for no reason took me by the arm and escorted me outside into the casino.  This action greatly confused me so I walked to the Hyde security outside the Hyde entrance in the casino and I asked to speak to a manager.  The Manager did not care about me being taken out for no reason and he did not care about telling my sister and her two friends that I was escorted out.  The Hyde manager had no customer relation skills and did not care about fixing their mistake.  The Hyde manager called Bellagio security and Bellagio security also had no customer relation skills.  I tried to explain my wrongful eviction and the only thing Bellagio security would do was threaten me with a trespassing charge.  I told them that was not helpful and I questioned why they did not want to resolve the situation and satisfy their customer and Hotel guest and then Bellagio security took me away.  When they took me away, several Bellagio security guards assaulted me and beat me up.  They punched me over 25 times in the head, in the eye and all over my body. They almost knocked me out and I had to try hard to stay alert.  I've never been beaten like this in my life and I've never even been in a fight; it was a nightmare.  I feared for my life. They called the Las Vegas police so I was arrested with a Disorderly Conduct charge.  When my attorney appeared in court, the prosecutor dropped the criminal charge against me.  I have since filed a lawsuit against Hyde and Bellagio.  I am intent on getting the word out publicly that you risk your safety and liberty dealing with Hyde, their security and Bellagio security.  I have been a repeat guest at Bellagio for over  15 years with my family and I was always accustomed to the most excellent customer service.  So this experience is a complete reversal and has to do with the low caliber people that they hire for security.  These security people are goons, they act like thugs, not educated with respect to customer relations and they believe that the right answer to a customer concern is to be trespassed.  If you question them, you risk being trespassed or beaten.  Fair warning to everyone, if anyone suggests going here, change your plans.  If  something similar happened to you, please message me.",Vs_AvBBA04EKflYs-03bTg,6,0,1,-d11ilIS-LE2hfPNe4BFsw
2611425,2013-01-14,1,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"Hyde is the best club experience I have had in Vegas, period. XS, Tao, Haze, Pure, Jet, Bank... 

The thing that sets Hyde apart from the other clubs/lounges in Vegas is the music. DJ Five and the DJ who was on before him (who honestly, was a better DJ) weren't spinning typical Vegas mixes. At almost every club you hear techno/house a little bit of top 40 and very little hip hop. These guys actually know how to mix music and they were playing a lot of hip hop and top 40.

Another great thing about Hyde is the view. The 1 nice thing about Pure in Caesar's is the view. The view in Hyde is awesome, you can look out on the strip and see everything. I think I saw the Bellagio water show out of the corner of my eye but I was much more focused on what was going on inside. There is an outdoor balcony that they managed to keep warm even though it is January.

Hyde isn't a huge club, it's closer to a lounge. They do cater to those who wish to spend $10K and gain a lot of attention by parading them around in makeshift boats carried in the air. It's strange, but whatever.

Hyde is perfect for people who want to party but aren't trying to roll heads and listen to house all night.  Right in the middle of the hotel, the terrace extends out to a beautiful view of the Fountains and the Strip.  I mean, you literally have the Eiffel Tower behind you.  Music was awesome - mostly stuff that you've actually heard before if you're not into the major DJ scene.  What made our experience so incredible was being able to reserve a table on the terrace.  Bottle service starts at $550.  You could also ask for a drink minimum which is $100/person.  Kyle made sure we were taken care of... before you know it, you're meeting your min and beyond because the service is impeccable.  Wednesday nights are worth it!

Drinks are pretty pricey, of course, but we were lucky and each had a free drink coupon from My Vegas, so instead of $18 each, we were FREEEE (plus tip of course).  It was a nice time although the server we had was sooooo slow and we'd be talking to her and she'd just look vacant and walk away. It was very odd.

The actual club is pretty small - definitely no XS or Marquee. But there were enough people that we had fun on the dance floor and still had enough room for our group of 6 to circle up and have fun, drink, and dance. It was actually a nice change to have enough room to move around (and not be packed in like sardines) - not a place I usually find myself in Vegas. 

The one thing I loved about this place was the view over the water. Even though it was past midnight so no water show, it was still beautiful and unique. The whole back wall opened up out over the water.

Plus, you can't go wrong with a patio that overlooks the Bellagio fountains.

Between 5 and 10 it's a lounge. There were several places to sit, chill and grab a drink. The specialty cocktails are $18 (it is the Bellagio afterall so you know it isn't gonna be cheap) and the three I tried were all amazing. Their version of a Moscow Mule was the best of the bunch.

At 10 the place turns into a club -- DJ, table service, etc, etc. But, there's actually room to dance and walk around, unlike other clubs. The specialty cocktail menu goes bye bye, but the bartenders will be somewhat happy to make whatever you want. The waitresses are all hot and wear freaky masks (think V for Vendetta... or maybe that changes nightly?). It makes for a good show.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,10,8,4,UZrz07913rleNlu05gSstg

The drinks were good, but they do run ~$18 for a cocktail. If you do decide to get a cocktail, my recommendation would be the Blood and Sand, a delicious and hearty bourbon cocktail that a friend ordered.  Our waitress was fine, but it would have been nice, when we ordered our drinks at 9:45 if she would have mentioned that all seating changes in to bottle service by 10:15 or 10:30.

The worst parts about our Hyde experience...well, the bottle-service seating thing (since the space is on the small side), the pricy drinks, we wanted to try the $20 liquid nitrogen cocktail, but were told told that they were out of the nitrogen, and lastly, and the most egregious:  we had been given tickets on the Strip that noted reduced cover and a free drink.  When we first arrived and tried to use the ticket we were told that the door person should have given us the drink ticket...out I go to ask them for the tickets.  They tell me that we have to wait until 10:30 to get the ticket, even though we were already inside the club. Ok, so I go back in and we hang out, until around 10:30 when we can no longer sit, we go out to get the drink tickets and are told that since we were already in the club, to get the tickets, we have to stand in the super long line.  With the smallness of the club, and the hoard trying to get in, we decided it was not worth it.  Hit up Chandalier in the Cosmopolitan for cheaper (and better) drinks and great people watching.

In the end, it wasn't event that I wanted was my cheap well freebie!!! I just felt that it was totally false advertising and the door people were VERY condescending. I would recommend going before 10, watching the fountains, and heading out.",kw6zLk4gsGd1e8L8eia9YQ,2,0,2,NRdhGg1gQ86D1eIMv_EKRg

Some would argue Hyde is small.... yes that is true and it can get a bit crowded, but it makes it a little easier to find your group! LOL  What I like the most is the view, as the nightclub is center stage to the fountain show!

Another advantage is all the fresh air you get from outside due to the patio.  So many clubs are sweat boxes that this is a refreshing change.

What a great setting to have a drink and enjoy the Bellagio fountain show.

Went here with a couple friends before the O show.... so we were here before it turned into a nightclub.

We were quickly sat at a lovely booth up where we could see the water.
Now... I wish they had some outdoor heaters because on a February evening... this open air lounge was COLD!  Good thing I had a cape to fold around me and keep the chill away.

The service was very good... not stuffy or pretentious.  Everyone was very nice and wanted to make sure that you had what you wanted but didn't bother you every 5 minutes.

I highly recommend their signature margarita... I think it was called a cucumber watermelon margarita.  Refreshing ... a tad sweet yet strong.  I could drink these all night... good thing we were headed for O.

The food (tapas) available are fairly limited.... there's maybe a 1/2 dozen things to choose from.  Do not go here to eat... but their nibbles are tasty.

We enjoyed the salmon flatbread, kobe sliders, pork belly sandwiches and potato chips.  (Yes, the ""potato crisps"" were ""potato chips""... but fancy ones with dipping sauce.)

All were very tasty but the sliders and sandwiches were tad on the greasy side.... which ... now that I think of it.... is perfect for when you are drinking.  I especially liked the salmon flatbread .... light and not too fishy.

If that hadn't happened, I'm not sure if we would have even stuck around to get inside.

It was cool to be able to see the Bellagio fountains from inside the club, but the edge by the windows was all reserved tables, so it was pretty much impossible to get up close to see.

The layout of the club made it very hard to find a spot to dance unless you had a reserved table.

Places like the Chandelier Bar are no longer alone in creating great artisanal drinks for you.  Hyde is a little different, though.  It's a lounge up until 10, when it becomes a club - DJ, table service, you know the drill.  Being inside the Bellagio, it's a given that this place, as well as the staff and the patrons, would be gorgeous.

The cocktail list is strong and versatile.  Any liquor you want to sample is showcased in one of their drinks.  As others have stated, I wouldn't come here to order rum and cokes, as it costs major $$$.  I'd select one of the classic cocktails they have on their list.  Their take on an Old Fashioned was pretty good.  Or if you enjoy ordering non-menu items like drink snobs such as Matt L., they are more than happy to create a drink tailored to your interests or their talents.   

They have a bellini cart that is wheeled around if you enjoy sipping those; I, however, found myself highly intrigued by the liquid nitrogen cable car.  After I ordered it, the bartender wheeled a mobile bar/cart to the patron side of the bar.  There, she created my drink ""tableside"" (although I was sitting at the bar).  The exhibition was nice, as the creation/presentation of the cocktail was impressive.  The drink is actually more like eating a sorbet, and gives you a pretty sweet and quick freezer burn at first touch.

Also, if you're not a fan of standing outside to wait for the fountain show when it's ""cold"", Hyde offers the absolute best views of the fountains.

They presented us with a bottle of vodka, poured us our drinks, continued to refill whenever we were low and even gave us special watermelon shots to top it all off! After about an hour (and one entire bottle of vodka shared between 4 of us girls), they moved us down to a larger table with more people and again, provided endless Skyy vodka with waiters/waitresses to pour our drinks. Tip: definitely bring cash to tip the servers, especially if you get in via promoter, we left a little over $100 in tips total. The entire staff was super friendly and added to our experience.

From inside, you have a view of the back of the Bellagio fountain! You're closer to the water than viewing from the front. It was breath taking.

The music here is different than other clubs on the strip. They play a balanced mix of old school hip hop/R&B with some new school house music. This pleased my eclectic taste in music and got us dancing all night long!

This is one of the best Vegas clubs I've experienced, thanks to Jomari and my bridesmaids.

The whole indoor-outdoor theme that Hyde offers really enhances your entire experience because you get to actually go outside and cool off after working your dance moves out on the dance floor. But wait... That is only if you have a table located out on the balcony. If you're in luck you may have a nice person invite you out to the table they have.. Who knows? But definitely being able watch the fountains and enjoy the view of Las Vegas Blvd is awesome! 

The service at the bar was good, however it just wasn't consistent in the friendliness category which is why I couldn't give them a full 5 star review. My friends received a few drink coupons prior to entering the club and one of the bartenders seemed a bit bothered by processing these and we weren't sure why since we were tipping on top of that free drink. Anyways the coupon was for a house vodka I believe and champagne so it wasn't like it was a hard drink to make. Nonetheless we finished out the night tipsy enough to remember that we had a great time overall.",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,5,4,4,g1KQouRxXuFCiucbvwQWvA

First of all, we weren't even planning to go to their club but their promoter kept pushing it so we agreed to give it a shot. I've only been to the Bank at the Bellagio and that place sucks so I was willing to give this a shot. When we got into the hotel we were stopped by another promoter which I guess was the promoter for the Bank and he kept pushing it and we kindly declined and asked where Hyde was located. At that point he was EXTREMELY rude so that didn't help and I shot back with some wise comments which are too inappropriate to repeat on here and stormed off. 

Since it was me, my other female friend and our guy friend we just walked up to the front and showed the bouncer our passes. He smiled and told us we would get in right away. However, right when he saw our guy friend he asked if he was with us and we said yes and instantly his demeanor changed and told us to get in line. I was absolutely disgusted. I have never had that happen before and I have never had to wait in line to get into a club in Vegas before. Pissed off, my female friend and I went to a different bouncer who wished me a happy birthday (it was my birthday weekend) stamped our hand and let us in eventually. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone and the club wasn't even that great anyways.",SwP-wrWkPGynwEuad_BAGA,2,2,1,SMLYA16XXdflsVk0ukqoCQ

Some times the bartenders drinks are not good but having two bars inside helps so you can always find at least one good bartender to go back to.

I like that its not a huge megaclub, intimacy makes for better parties in my opinion. I liked it better when I came last year though, the views of the fountain where gorgeous and it was choreographed to play with the beat of certain songs. This year it looked completely different to the point where i almost thought i was in the wrong place, because they put up some glass walls all along the beautiful fountain area, totally killing the view and atmosphere, and the fountains barely came on. I stayed at the cosmo again to get a view of the fountains but during my whole stay, the fountain barely came on. Anyways, I guess they closed it off to put on the AC. It was Friday night, July 4th, guestlist, no problems at the door, place was packed, good music, alternated between sets of hip hop and EDM. Good mixed crowd, everyone dancing. The bellinis fell off, they no longer do the 2 nice flavors that they used to have on their menu, but still we just had our bubbly and there were good vibes. Only problem was after they dropped a wave of paper confetti, there were paperballs all over the floor, and it was so hard to dance with those sticking all under your heels.

But we're too cheap to take you to see a Cirque Du Soleil show, even though there's a good one across the street at the MGM Grand.  So we'll take you to what we think is a hip, hot, happenin' joint:  Hyde!""

At least that's how I interpreted it.

It's an exclusive club, complete with a velvet rope;  they don't let just anybody in, and it looks like you need to have a little dough to get in and imbibe.  Once you're in, it has a high-class feel in its decor, furniture, and view of the fountains.  Pretty good thick pizza and sliders.  And drinks, of course, with more emphasis on the drinks than the food;  I think that if I asked for a Coke, they'd give it to me with rum in it.

Not really my kind of venue.  Our group had the back part reserved for our private party, with a clear view of the fountains dancing around to ""In The Mood"".  I spent most of my time eating - well, I am on a seefood diet, y'know.  The music was not so loud that we couldn't talk to each other, what a relief.  I was disappointed that no one got up and danced;  I was told that this happened after our party was over, and that it got a little weird.

I guess it's okay if it's your thing.  No complaints about their prices, which I didn't check out;  at least you get something for your money, which you won't in the casinos (remember, the house wins almost all the time).

Thankfully, we were placed on the guest list (and did not have to waste our money on the high cover) but left after about 40 minutes due to the yawn worthy ambiance of the crowd, set-up, and staff.

First, the place is located inside the Bellagio hotel. Parking will be easy but paid, and the place itself should be pretty easy to find if you follow the signs inside the hotel. 

Once you get there, the line is actually rather short, but be ready to spend a lot of money. The  cover and the drinks there are rather expensive. Since this club is very small, be ready to have very little room to dance once inside since it will be very crowded.

The main problems with this place are the staff which can be very rude, and the drinks, that are usually pretty weak even though they are expensive.

Overall, my experience with Hyde was negative and I would definitely not recommend it. Go to any other club in Vegas. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",JR7AYVUJ1_Nq36UBW3XHYw,6,2,1,Qv4vwHaYW1eCxh32qqQGDA

My group stopped in on a Wednesday night around 11 - obviously not the ideal clubbing time. We actually were looking for Fontana Bar, which was a patio bar that overlooked the Bellagio fountains and piped in the music that the water was moving to. It was my favorite bar in Las Vegas. Must not have been too lucrative, though, because they replaced it with this nightclub. Bummer.

Our mixed-age group felt comfortable only because there were two or three other tables near us (remind you, this was early on a Wednesday) also had some older members. We immediately sat down right next to the window that overlooked the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower at Paris. GREAT view. The tables were cute and the cocktail list was fun. Our server was nice despite us obviously not being there to drop hundreds of dollars on bottle service. The waitresses sure are dressed to the nines - I would imagine male patrons loooove them.

After we left, a member of our party realized she left her iPhone in the seat of our booth. She called Hyde and a nice member of their staff went over to look for it and gave it to security in the hotel. That counts as awesome service to me.

We did not have to pay cover charge and champagne and vodka were free up until 12:30. We were told that they stop letting people in 20 minutes after opening, and the cover charge for male is $50 so there are plenty of rich guys to buy us drinks.  The professional dancers and cocktail waitresses were beautiful.  

Why two stars? The champagne was awful. There was no where to sit unless one spends $550 for a table. The only place to stand and dance was in an awkward passage way between tables.  I feel bad for those people standing outside of the club waiting to get in when they have plenty of space inside.  I guess the exclusivity is what makes the club popular.

The heavily-promoted View Of Lake Bellagio is a just a small, plexiglass-lined 10-foot space that's roped off.  

No dance floor, just a bunch of people packed in & standing around what's really an undersized room adjacent to the casino.  

The redeeming aspect of this place was my martini, mostly because it provided a quick infusion of about 5 ozs of vodka, and not because it was $17.50 and served in a plastic cup.  I felt bad for the suckas with the bottle service.  And for anyone who waits in line to get in.

It's exactly what I've learned to expect from Vegas: sexy, over the top, obnoxiously expensive but worth the experience.The ambiance, the views, the music, the drinks and of course the people watching never disappoints. It's not your typical club, it's (probably purposely) expensive so it attracts and keeps a certain clientele and expels the stragglers. On a week night, they have some really cool bands and lounge music, entertaining and even relaxing. Later in the night and on weekends, they have fantastic DJs and sometimes appearances by celebs and famous singers.The dancers are a whole other attraction on their own, beautiful creatures and great performers. The staff are of course impeccably dressed and easy on the eyes, very attentive and even can be seen dancing away when the music is irresistible. It's always fun to watch one of the big customers get carried on the 'boat' or shoulders of the staff with the beautiful girls waving the flash lights, announcing the big bucks dropped on a bottle ( this is the kind of obnoxious entertainment that you could probably only find in Vegas, but like an episode of Kardashians, it's the guilty pleasure that you know is the anti-brain food and terrible for your IQ but can't resist to check out).

It was hard not to notice that there were other groups of people being offered free drinks,special admission, etc. If you were female and unaccompanied by males, you were in this rarefied group. A large group also got special privileges. Couples, not so much. Couples probably don't spend as much.

We sat at a table, drinks in hand, and a guy jumped down onto the couch to thrust a menu in our faces. The only things on the menu are bottles. Husband said, ""We don't need a whole bottle, can we get single drinks?"" Bouncer/waiter said, ""Then YOU don't get a table."" I thought that was pretty shockingly rude and if others had overheard, it would have been humiliating. But whatever. He wants to make money. 

The bouncer then came up to my husband to explain that the tables were for bottle service only. Um, yeah, we got that. I think he regretted being a jerk. I see from the other reviews that some people do sit at tables without buying entire bottles. 

You cannot go onto the balcony to admire the view unless you pay for VIP.

There was nobody dancing, but it was when the club opened. But it was downright dead for a Friday night.

There was nowhere to sit unless you paid at least $50 for 6 bottles of Bud Lite (the cheapest thing on there). 

Perhaps it would be better if you were in a big group, were a lady in a group of ladies, but it was a thoroughly unpleasant waste of time. And the gin and tonic was about 95% tonic.

I reckon it would be great to go here during the week or earlier in the day, but I would never go again on a Saturday night.  Too many people, too much cigarette smoke, too many posers.  Which is all too bad, because the music is really good!!

I used Free Vegas Club Passes (AKA Chris Hornak) and got on the guest list for free. (Review here: http://bit.ly/1Emdatf) That's about the best part of my entire experience at Hyde. I came with my boyfriend and after waiting 30 minutes, we entered the club. 

Hyde is a sprawling, stylish nightspot with floor-to-ceiling windows and a sophisticated lounge vibe. Don't get me wrong, this place is posh and spirited...and of course, it overlooks the iconic Fountains of Bellagio. Hyde caters to upscale and high-end party goers--think bottle service and reserved booths. In fact, a lot of the areas are reserved so good luck finding a space where you're not confined to a tiny spot dancing next to the stanchions. The venue is definitely beautiful and expansive. But how much can you truly appreciate its architecture and décor when it's dark (I understand it's a NIGHTclub) with a massive crowd of semi-drunk people (I understand it's a nightCLUB) flailing their bodies around and bumping into you? Not very much enjoyment there. Top that off with horrendous drinks (worst tasting cocktails I've ever had but they were free as part of my pass so I guess I can let this slip), and music I've never heard of (was it electronic, hip-hop, international, contemporary...Miley Cyrus? I don't even know), and it's a grand recipe for a grand ol' unpleasant time. 

I foolishly thought I could escape the madness by stepping out to the patio but there were some Justin Bieber type dudes out there smoking--except they were much older. Everyone outside was smoking, so unless you wanted to take part in that, you can't escape or Hyde (sorry, I had to). There was also a line of females who were dancing and standing on the back of the couches. So not only did the limited seating get even more limited, but you had inebriated ladies in tight dresses waving their arms around with drinks (which are gross!) in their hands hovering over you. A nightclub nightmare?

I don't know if I would want to visit Hyde on a night when it's poppin'. It was already extremely crowded; I understand it might be due to the fact that it was the only club open that night, but I'm pretty certain it will be packed with bodies regardless of the night. I guess if you had enough alcohol (and delusion) in you, then Hyde can be pretty entertaining.",JGnqasIkGMLfSejt7mw9qQ,13,9,2,HwLWEK5O-n4oMK1SC892WQ

It was awesum the host just got us in front of the line and we were in! Woo hoo no line! So once inside the place it was packed!! and lady gaga go go dancers were everywhere! um pretty small dance floor if I say so myself.

I loved the music though, there was some journey, AC/DC, Guns N' Roses. It was so packed and not enough room that me and my friend decided to leave. But the club didn't let us! Haha we were wandering around the place looking for the door, which I thought was the way we came in from....but I guess it wasn't.... So in the meantime we were just admiring the views, which were pretty spectacular if I say so myself. 

At last we found the door, which was pretty great planning if I say so myself. Exits were away from the entrance so that if it sucked and people wanted to leave all the people in line at the entrance wouldn't see.

Memorial day weekend at Vegas and on Sunday night we came here after we randomly bumped into some nice guys on the strip who were celebrating a Bachelor party (we were celebrating a Bachelorette). There was a girl with this large group of guys that was telling us she had a hook-up at Hyde and could get us all in for free. We made the long walk there and got in the club no problem. Unfortunately the guys who were also trying to get in weren't allowed in the club; they were all wearing shorts!! That sucked for them! But we still went in lol. Right as soon as we walk in there was an older guy who had bottle service and a table all to himself; he signaled me and my group over and we happily obliged. Free alcohol? An area to sit? SURE! He looked somewhat cooler with a group of girls I'm sure, haha. So that luck might have colored our experience at Hyde; we had free bottle service. 

The music being played was actually pretty decent; they had a mix of EDM/top 40/old school 90's r&b and our group liked it. I can't speak to how much the drinks usually are or the service at the bar. I don't remember having a view of the fountains so I can't speak to that either lol. The dance area in the middle was somewhat small, so keep that in mind.

I approach one of the hosts outside the club and asks him if he can hook up a local.  He tells me they have a local night and it's a holiday weekend, then stops himself, and says what the hell I'll take care of you two.  Wow.  That doesn't happen very often in Las Vegas, and it was definitely appreciated.

Hyde was packed, and seemed either too small or just that busy.  Nothing really stood out as amazing in this place, but I think the small footprint makes it just seem like it's that much busier and more fun when the other clubs are half empty.

The scrawny guy with the clipboard will one day get a good face slap/punch from a guest. He purposely walked back and forth, giving you the impression he was coming your way, all to go back the opposite direction. I watched him let in females that looked like straight garbage. The one next to me smelled like a wet dog and looked like she was dragged out of an alley. Not clean at all!! Then he said he cant let a guy in bec he didn't have a collar on his shirt. Yet there it was, 3 other guys walking in WITHOUT collar shirts. People came up AFTER us and were let in. So I finally complained to the Asian girl working the front as well and told her, ""We've been standing here for 30 mins snd this dill hole keeps ignoring us. If we're not getting in, tell us so we don't stand here looking like idiots. Look at me, I'm dressed clean and classy, yet this girl next to me looks homeless and she's about to get in. What the hell kind of place are you running?!""  She immediately went to that stupid guy and whatever she said, he came over all friendly and what not, then let us in. I definitely believe these people are racist. Felt sorry for the guys next to us as well. They came with 6 girls and the girls were admitted, but the guys got stopped at the rope. What a slap in the face. After one of the guys realized that his GF went in and left him outside, he said ""Screw a relationship.. Lets go bec we're not getting in"". All of a sudden the GF realized, a bit too late, that she should've stuck with her group she came with. After the BF said he was leaving (and he did) she ran after him.. Pretty funny drama while on line..lol.. Anyways, we got in and it was more of a lounge setting than a club. I don't care for house/techno type music much, but some of it is do-able. The bar had about 3 people working it and about 30 patrons waiting for drinks. Ridiculous! As another review stated, this is a standing club unless you buy bottle service. As for security, it's amazing what these $8.50 an hour sloppy guys do. The super obese Polynesian guy, with the hotdogs on the back of his neck, was beyond rude (but these seem to be the people Bellagio takes pride in having work for them). He pushed several people and forced people to move out if the way. Ummm hello, where was the damn fire Marshall?! That place was a fire hazard, so it's difficult for people to move around in there. Pushing people is a no no and I got pushed I would've been tossed because they would've been wearing my free drink. This is a discriminating place to patrons. Funny thing is, they should be the same way with the staff bec the big black guy at the ropes looked DISGUSTING and so did most of the others. They want attractive people in the club with their puke face staff. Give me a break!!!

It was a Tuesday(yes, we were going UP on a Tuesday lol) so we knew there would be no celebrity DJ. It was a last minute outing. And we decided to hit up a promoter for HYDE. He got me in for free and it was open bar for the ladies until12:30 that was nice. It was no surprise that my fiancé had to pay since it was just the two of us. When we come with a larger group (more girls than guys) we usually get in for free.the promoter got $10 discounted off my finances ticket ,as well as a free drink,cool.
That was just the entry.
As far as the actual club, let me first state that we had fun. We came in aware of the circumstances and so we were not expecting much. 
1. Entrance- free with a promoter. Although he promised he'd get us both in for free $20 just for him with 5 free drinks combined was not bad at all. The bouncers have priority to the ladies and it looked like they let ANYONE in and I mean anyone. Some girls weren't even wearing what I consider formal club attire but rather beach or some type of Cinderella dress as I recall a girl wearing! Mmk?
2.the drinks- (open bar) champagne or vodka w/ mixer. The vodka drinks were STRONG and I got pretty buzzed off my first drink. By the second I was good to show off my dance moves. So was my fiancé.
3. The music- it's all hip hop and top 40's. I would recommend a younger crowd who has never Been clubbing before to come here , it felt like prom . No mainstream celebrity, sad face. 
4. The view was phenomenal; we got front seats to the BELLAGIO water show. The club is literally located balcony style on the first floor of the hotel. GET THERE at 10:30 to get a good seat!!! 
5. DANCING- usually I could care less about getting a seat or lounge spot but this time it was crucial to get there early. The dance floor is tiny and PACKED. The hallways are the only places to dance other than the private lounges! If you get there early your experience is bound to be that much better!

In spite of one of the waitresses standing just behind us without moving for a good portion of the time & looking eerily like an Oscar in her  shiny gold supertight super mini dress, the rest of the staff was great- good service.  I'd happily pay $18 for a margarita here to enjoy the view & the atmosphere again any time...",5ebu1xwPmX5jhkDFO4yg_Q,2,1,5,SodDExrqIf2TDZxJIfX5cw

First it has to have one of the absolute best backdrops to stimulate your visual senses, the Bellagio Fountains. Second some of the friendliest/nicest door staff in all of Vegas. Now days with all the hubub, super starts and High Rollers it seems if your not dropping $5000+ grand on a table they treat you like shit. NOT the case here at Hyde, I've been here for parties, yelp events, Day/night and different nights of the week. They guys at the door have always treated me with respect, even when I'm getting in free. 3rd- Cover is never rediculous, a lot of times you can get in free with a VIP card they hand out in the casnio, if not it's usually $20 for guys. Way better than the $150 cover Hakkasan charges guys just to walk in. They've usually got a couple great DJ's each night, it's always packed and you can't beat the location.

There was free drinks for ladies until 1 a.m. which included champagne or Pinnacle Vodka.  We had no troubles getting a drink.  The place is small and was pretty much VIP tables with walkways.  No real ""dance floor"" so at one point while we were dancing we were yelled at because it was a ""walkway"" although the only open areas all looked like walkways.

4271321,2015-02-21,1,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"Party at Hyde only if you have a table!
Hyde is a lounge in the early evening, thus the setting carries over to the nightclub. The dance floor is small, small, small. If you don't have a table, there's really no place to stand. You'll be stuck on the completely packed dance floor, up against the bar or in the bathroom walkway. If you're looking to get a table and hang out with just your large group of friends, Hyde is perfect. If you're looking to meet new people or go table-less, I suggest another club. 

Music: Top 20, old school hip hop mixed with EDM.  I heard Jay-Z's 99 problems, Fergie's London Bridge, Sia's Chandelier and Miley Cyrus's Party in the USA mixed together with EDM last night (do EDM songs have  names? haha)

If you're getting a table, get one against the windows to the fountain show. The next best table would be the ones directly in front/under the DJ booth (if you don't mind having the entire club stare at you!). There are tables on the stage, but that isolates you from the rest of the club.

4275605,2014-07-11,0,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"This is one of my favorite underrated clubs in Las Vegas.  I've seen my fair share of nightclubs from the inception of the scene with Studio 54, Rum Jungle, Utopia, to the transformation into the mega club!! The over the top gaudy large scale party behemoth the Las Vegas party scene has become today.  

If you want a good time come to Hyde for an awesome club, small and lots of character.  From the amazing view of the Bellagio fountains, to the hype men dressed in horse head costumes, crazy gogo dancers dressed in awesome get ups .... and one of the last clubs in Vegas with HIp Hop/Mix/Top 40 music. 

Almost every time I come here I have a good time.

Parking: Bellagio self parking, stay right, but don't walk outside in the lobby and you'll hit Hyde.  Not too far of a walk.. not like Hakkasan at MGM.

Entry:  Look up and call ahead to see if the club has a guestlist.  This is good for mostly free or discounted entry for girls, but some clubs let guys in free with a 1:1 guy: girl ratio.  Doesn't hurt asking. 

Table line: Facing Hyde located at the left.  The podium is there, and the front is small so if you booked a table you can find your host there, or if you're walking up get in the table reservation line.  Tables are LIMITED here so be sure to arrive early, before 1130 or all the tables get sat.

Bars: 1 main bar as you walk in all the way the right.... and another small bar in the far adjacent corner when you walk in.

Hyde is not well known because it is smaller but I honestly love this club. Although if you're on the patio tables sometimes the spray of the fountain mist wets you a little bit.  For girls, that can be a big no no. 

EXIT:  When exiting folks, don't go out where ya came in, go behind the DJ booth as you were going the bathroom which brings me to my next point... bathroom is outside the club... right outside... don't you worry now.. it's not too far. About 10 meters from exit.

Go Sundays for XIV for a crazy day party during the colder days.  Day parties = to help ease the withdrawal of non-pool party season.

For an independent host with no fees and no rip offs guaranteed... give me a shout jennysvegas.com or 7025055014 for table inquiries.",fIrdxywQxiL0BP141dQqeA,2,0,5,lGCinRuvwQ1JFxrfr4DMUg

When I checked in I was given a special VIP pass and told to have a good time.  I was also told that there were special VIP areas for me that I had full access too.  The problem was that all areas were roped off but I had no idea which side was VIP and which side was not VIP.  I found it kind of funny because with my VIP pass every velvet rope was lifted up for me.  Yes that is cool but what side should I be on.  It was a little confusing.

We also had passed apps and the staff serving them were really nice but it was some of the worse food I have ever had in my life.  I honestly could not even call it food...Costco samples tasted better then this stuff they were serving us.  I would have expected more from a location in the Bellagio.

The bar near the windows was also really packed and I could not get the bartenders attention to get a drink.  I then spotted a bar way on the other side and decided to see what was going on over there.  I had to go through two Border Patrol check points (guys with the velvet ropes) to get there and still had no idea if I could get a drink down there.  I asked the bartender and she said sure...okay things were starting to look up.

I will tell you that seeing the dancing waters from the backside was unique.  It is also a closer vantage point then standing on the street.  My two stars are for the five star view.

I'm not sure sneakers, jeans, a plaid shirt and a down vest is business casual but we had to go somewhere. 30 bucks is steep for a mediocre club and they don't offer discounts to gay guys even though they have no reason to pay to meet chicks because the doorman said if gay guys want equality they should pay the same price. They was a pretty pretty good comeback, so we paid. BECAUSE WE HAD NO WHERE ELSE TO GO since Share is only open on certain nights and for some reason THERE ARE NO GAY BARS ON THE STRIP.

You were just able to buy a table or individual tickets, so I assumed we'd be able to sit at the bar or at cocktail tables or something.

So I bought two individual tickets (no table) online and the time was marked 10pm. I found that odd, so the next day, I called Hyde to confirm -- they said yes, it started at 10pm and that they'd look into the situation with the website.

Fine, fine.  SO... cut to Saturday, we're excited to be seeing Dita's show at Hyde (which is new and we had no idea was a nightclub)... until we see Dita tweet that she would be doing a ""cameo appearance"" at midnight for her champagne glass act.  

Record scratch.

Maybe it's normal in Vegas for people to pay $50 a head to get into a dance club, but I'm going to guess for regular folk like me who is local, but isn't a native Nevadan or a sucker tourist, that's a bit steep.  I am totally fine with $50 to see a show, but $50 to STAND for 2 hours and get elbowed by strangers with too much cologne is a bit much. 

I think their marketing could've used some work here. If it had been made clear that this was a nightclub -- like a bachelorette party/stiletto heels/bromance/velvet rope kind of nightclub, I probably wouldn't have bought the tickets.  It gave the impression on their website that it was a lounge and that this would be a private event/show for which you bought tickets and saw a performance.

It was really more of a ""Hey, pay a huge cover get into our club and you could see someone famous for 10 minutes."" like when you see Carmen Electra will be at Pure on some billboard off the 15.  That's what it boiled down to.  I love, love Dita, but I would've seen her in a different venue.

THAT SAID... we were standing really close, so we did get a great view of her, tassles n' all, even if it was for only 10 minutes.

PROS:  Amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains -- seriously spectacular. 

The staff was VERY nice -- everyone from the bouncers to the bartenders, very accommodating and helpful and not condescending in the slightest (which I admit, I expected, since this is clearly a high-end dance club full of beautiful people -- I pre-judged).  No one made us feel like we didn't belong there except maybe us. 

The decor is beautiful as well -- and from what I understand, they are open as a lounge from 5pm to 10pm so you totally can visit here when it's not all oonce-oonce-oonce-oonce.

CONS: Aside from the marketing miscommunication, the only con I had was the one drink I ordered. I ordered a Cosmo and it tasted like pink lemonade from concentrate. In fact, I'm fairly certain is was made with lemonade. I tasted no alcohol in it at all, so I didn't bother getting another at $14. (My boyfriend ordered a Jack n' Coke -- also $14. How does that work?)

I would consider going again, this time during the cocktail hours. The outside patio and view of the fountains really is worth it, even for just one drink.  I'd like to try their beverages when it's not Night at the Roxbury.",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,4,1,3,QVDEUH5OoKCUBw_V73wJUA

The aspect of the club that really appealed to me is that the location used to be a restaurant and they kept the open patio area for Hyde. Since the club is right behind the Bellagio fountains, several times while dancing you could look out and see the water show. It really added a beautiful touch to the whole experience.

The cover charge for guys was $75. I don't know if that's standard or inflated since I went over 4th of July weekend, but that's just madness.

Tuesday night is industry night so locals, industry folks are free. 

Beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains that go off every hour on the hour. 

Two bars, lots of booths (for a fee), and small area to dance. It's open format so not too much house, edm, hip hop or rap. It's a good mixture of all.

Overall a good place to party at. Crowd is a tad bit older then most clubs but it's fun!

Like I said, we were here on an organized bar crawl so we were able to bypass what little line there was for a Tuesday. It seemed busy, but that's because unless you had a reserved booth there was NO where to sit. We made the mistake of trying to go outside (as it's right by the fountains) and were turned away because it was VIP area. Except not a soul was out there. Hokay.....

The people with the booth obviously were there to drop money on bottle service, but if that wasn't your cup of tea - skip this place. Trying to get a drink at the bar ended up not even being worth it. After wandering around in hopes of finding a place to chill, having another member of our group getting threatened to get booted for dancing (apparently not in the right area, and that right area was - you guessed it - in the VIP area!) we happily left. 

It's hyped as ultra fancy but even in the dark, it has a very worn out look. I'd be curious what it looks like in the daylight.

Dance floor in the center with easy to reach bar. The Lounge opens up to a scenic view of the Bellagio fountains and Paris Eiffel tower 'Juste en face'. Dancers liven up the place leading everyone to feel the vibe. DJ was solid and kept the crowd rolling with modern dance music. The crowd is good mix of ages all dressed hip. From 10 to 12 it is an easy lounge blend as after midnight it turns up the heat and becomes clubby. For Vegas this 3 star is a great review. You know what it is...

The food was exquisite! Fresh, delicious and perfect. Like it was made by a top chef.

The drinks were all high quality and classy. The place a had a great vibe of class without really being snooty.

One thing I didn't care for was that they had several big screen TV's around playing sports. It kind of degraded the whole vibe. I wish they played music videos or something instead. Or just did away with them altogether, and played music. The volume was good though. Not overpowering, so you were able to have conversations.

The VIP Host, Tommy, was super helpful from the moment he replied to me, and continued to be so throughout our night at Hyde. I've done table reservations/bottle service at plenty of clubs in Vegas, and this is the first time I realized how awesome a VIP host truly CAN be - in the past I've even had trouble getting them to seat myself and the friends I was with for our table reservation, whereas Tommy was right there waiting and checked on us several times throughout the night.

Additionally, while Hyde tables are about average price compared to other high-end clubs on the Strip, I highly suggest paying the little extra for a fountain view table. It was amazing to be able to watch the Bellagio fountains from so close - I only wish they'd continued going off all night long!

Our server (Jessica, I think) and the busser were also amazing - we didn't go without at any point during the night. Also, the DJ wasn't anyone I'd heard of before, but he was great, too.

Most impressive of all was walking into the club and witnessing the vision-filling Bellagio fountain display just outside the patio.  It was breathtaking.

We were supposed to be on the guest list... but we ended up not being on there so us two girls were able to get in free (+a free drink ticket). The boys however, had to pay (I think) $40 each (and no free drink ticket). A regular cran/vodka was $15.

It was a Tuesday night so it wasnt ridiculously crowded. I thought it was a pretty cool thing that when you buy bottle service, the waitresses come out with these flashing lights and make a big scene all the way to your table. There was a wedding party going on too, so along with all the waitresses and their flashy lights, they put one of the waitresses in a small (like 6ft) boat and the bouncers carried the boat as they walked to the table with a huge bottle of Dom. It was something different :]

Their dancers have very interesting outfits. Maybe it's because I'm from Hawaii, and we don't have that kind of over the top stuff, but it seemed very Lady Gaga-ish. I can't explain it.. The dancers later stopped dancing and walked around giving out free shots (just gotta tip them).

Music was great... Popular hip-hop, things you hear on the radio type of songs :]

We did stay until about 9, then left as they were making the transition to the club scene. I'm pretty sure we would have been kicked out of the table anyway, not to long after, to make way for bottle reservations. 

Cigars are fine to enjoy here, they only have one cigar ash tray though. If someone else gets it before you, then tiny ash tray it is. It is super expensive, but the drinks are worth it.

We got to bypass the velvet ropes and were escorted to the VIP area, where we weren't even challenged as we stepped up. Apparently some have had a problem with this, not us, I just waltzed right on up when I saw some of our party.

There We found tables that were stocked with bottles, with mixers, bowls of ice and glasses. If I tried to make myself a drink, a person was RIGHT there, skirting in to make sure that it was made for me. Of course this person often stepped on my feet to do so, when s/he was making a drink for someone else as well. 

For a Friday night, the music was pulsing, the DJ was someone that the Bossman had heard of, but I was not familiar with, and yet, the sound was good. I especially liked when the cannons blew out the confetti and then the strobes came on, it was like waves of slow motion -stuff- was floating through the air and you didn't know weather to be afraid or excited by what was coming your way. 

I danced, and I enjoyed myself for the hour or so I was there, people watching as people watched us dance. Another review comments that if you're here you've got to watch those that pay for the vip status, and sadly that does seem to be the case, People were standing on the side lines watching those in VIP with a hungry look in their eyes.

We found the promotion through Instagram which advertised Men and Women free entry until 1 AM and women drink for free until 12:30 AM if you were on the guest list.

We got on the guest list and arrived at the club. While we were waiting in line we were asked if we wanted to get a free drink, all we had to do was sign up by giving them our email address. We asked if we would still get free drinks regardless until 12:30am because we were on the guest list and the promoter said that she would give us a card which we could exchange at any time...even after 12:30am.

Once we get to the front of the line we were charged 60 for Men and 30 for women. Even though we showed them the text which proved we were on a guest list as well as their advertisement on Instagram. They completely dismissed it. We still payed since we had already waited in the guest list line for over an hour.

Then when we got to the bar and the bartender said nobody drinks for free and the cards they gave us were only redeemable for one drink.

We are aware that Vegas can be expensive, I am not upset about the money. We were upset because the promoters and the club lie to the guests in order to get them to come.

DO NOT GO HERE.
There are so many other places to spend your money than this stupid club. It wasn't even fun because of how overcrowded it was.",YCv5YeXyb6iFEvG1fWBMtw,3,1,1,N6ZD9xsXdLq2ZKwT5cKKiw

5022885,2012-12-14,2,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"It was our last night in Vegas, so the girlfriend and I decided to check out Hyde Bellagio.  We're not ones for the club scene, so we got there much earlier in the evening (around 6:30 pm on Friday) to experience Hyde in its daily, early evening, cocktail lounge mode featuring a surprising array of craft cocktails.  Located just off of the casino floor, Hyde has a sexy, cool, chic ambiance, but its best feature is its spectacular front row view of the Bellagio's signature fountains.  As such, you're treated to a great view of the fountain show, which provides a beautiful backdrop for the entire space.

Although the lounge was pretty much empty but for a handful of other guests and we could've sat pretty much anywhere, we elected to sit at the bar.  At the risk of getting smacked on the head by the gf for noticing, Hyde's bartenders and cocktail waitresses were extremely attractive.  Haley, our bartender, was no exception, but more importantly she was exceedingly personable, professional, and passionate about her cocktail making.  I started off with the Ruby-Rye Cooler ($18) made with Bulleit Rye, Founders Ruby Port, and pineapple and lemon juices.  It was a bit on the sweet side from the port and pineapple juice for my personal taste, but not cloyingly sweet.  It was still an enjoyable, refreshing drink.  More enjoyable (and much more fun) was my gf's choice, the Jose Andres inspired liquid nitrogen cocktail ($20), made tableside by one of the lovely cocktail waitresses, using a bunch of unidentified ingredients and liquid nitrogen. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hyde-bellagio-las-vegas?select=7__FShVFi-Hys58WR6gFWw#7__FShVFi-Hys58WR6gFWw Less a true cocktail and more a whimsical, boozy, Egg Nog ice cream, it was fun to watch being made and more fun spooning into my mouth.  Pricey, sure, but it was good tasting entertainment!  Closing out our visit, the gf and I split Hyde's signature cocktail, the Love Unit ($18) expertly made by Haley with Stoly Elit, Stoly Vanilla, muddled Thai basil, fresh lime and grapefruit juices, and ""hand extracted"" (a fancy way to say ""muddled""?) bell pepper juice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hyde-bellagio-las-vegas#tD8KZt-W5LAktIVrKLqOaQ  I'm not really big on vodka based cocktails, but the Love Unit really struck gold as the Stoly allowed the bell pepper and Thai basil to shine.

I don't know what Hyde Bellagio is like after 10 pm, but I certainly liked my early evening cocktail lounge experience.  It's not an inexpensive stop for drinks, but it's in line with prices on the Strip and it's still cheaper than the exorbitant prices being charged for inferior drinks at Lily http://www.yelp.com/biz/lily-bar-and-lounge-las-vegas#hrid:WxrU1pRUwFnkNSHEqVgX6g/src:self .

Was threatened to be kicked out for ordering two drinks at once, when I had a friend with me.  I understand in a club of this volume they have to deal with a lot of misbehaved drunks, however I was extremely polite and said, okay, fine, may I have just the one drink and two waters.  

I handed my drink to my friend while I opened my wallet to pull out some cash for a tip- bartender grabbed the drink out of my friend's hand, dumped it out, demanded for security to come throw me out and refused to even give me waters. 

Again, I understand what usually happens here, but in this level of ""high end"" nightclubs is this really how we treat patrons? I was given only one drink, what is the problem?  I was made a spectacle of, spotlighted and escorted by the arm away from the bar. I wasn't even intoxicated. 

My one star goes for the security guard, who saw the whole thing go down and didn't throw me out, just escorted me to the other side of the bar and told me to use that bartender instead- who was slow but at least served us.

We had read reviews of two different ""scenes"" at the club.  Early in the evening it appears that it is a place to watch the sunset and the fountains while grabbing an early cocktail.

He put us onto Hyde's guest list (4 girls, 1 guy) for free entrance before 11pm and unlimited drinks for the ladies before 1am. It was too good of a deal to pass up, so we headed over after dinner when they re-opened the lounge at 10:30pm.

We waited a few minutes, but got in and we got plenty of drink tickets. The location is awesome as you can dance and see the Bellagio water show making it one of those over-the-top-but-expected-in-Vegas moments. The bartenders were nice and drinks were solid as you had a choice of champagne or a vodka mix. Even the bathroom attendants were super helpful! The official dance space (which we assumed to be in the middle of the room) was a bit small, but that basically meant that you could dance everywhere (and everyone did!). The music itself was on point as the DJ played a variety of music (90s to current Top 40), so everyone knew a bit of something.

Hyde is probably the tiniest ""club"" in Vegas. It really doesn't even look like a club, but more like a lounge. If the place is packed (which it usually is) there is no room to walk, no where to sit, no dedicated dance floor, and there really isn't anywhere to stand. Prepare to get pushed, shoved, bumped into, and accidentally hit. This shit show is at it's absolute best and worst when they do the XIV, a neon party (which is one Sunday a month and stars at 5 PM). No joke. You can't ask for a better party pit, but the only way to thoroughly enjoy this space is to have a table. MUST have a table. Seriously. MUST.

When it's not the overly packed, the space feels a lot like an upscale lounge. Stunning views of the Bellagio fountains and the surrounding strip area. The music here various from Top 40 to EDM.

Cover and drink prices are on par with other strip club/lounge pricing. Look for a promoter on Twitter or Facebook.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,3,2,2,RLb8mXpL5-f3VRCgLjU7UA
5323675,2017-08-07,0,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"I've only ever been to Hyde between 5-10pm when it's in Lounge Mode as opposed to Ooontz Mode, and since the majority of the 1-star reviews here are filled with nightclub-specific complaints, I still feel comfortable with my 5-star rating.

It's best to make a table reservation a few weeks in advance, and it's key to note your preference for a seat on the terrace (which only has seven tables).  As of my last visit, there's a $50/person F&B minimum during lounge hours, which is *easily* met after a few drinks.  And if that still feels like extravagant pricing, have your server bring you a bottle service menu from Ooontz Mode and be thankful you've not paying $30,0000 for a bottle of champagne.

This place is class. Doesn't matter if it's 105 degrees in August or 40 degrees in December, the terrace stays mild and comfortable, thanks to an army of heaters and misters.  And there is nothing more Vegas-magical than having your Strip view completely obscured by a wall of illuminated fountains only a couple hundred feet away, feeling the after-mist rain down over your table, and knowing that you and perhaps 20 other fellow loungers are having this experience.  Yes, we've all seen the fountain show from the scalloped decks on Las Vegas Boulevard, but it's *completely* different and massively more impressive from Hyde.

The noms from adjacent Lago are overpriced and a bit under-delivered, yes, but the drinks are imaginative, the servers attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere....unequaled. I know people who visited Hyde *once* three or four years ago and *still* wax nostalgic about it.  This is the definite place to bring people who don't like Las Vegas.

They won't magically *love* Las Vegas afterwards, of course, but I guarantee that all of their future ""I hate Las Vegas"" rants will perennially have the exception ""except for that one place....""",5Oxq2pC8lt-wkxY7coBLCA,6,1,5,UFJD5RzFXy029yawP_daTg
5330925,2014-08-28,0,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"My Hyde experience was top-notch. 

I went to the nightclub on a Tuesday (apparently the club goes off each Tuesday). I was staying at the hotel, so with a quick call to the concierge I was added to the guest list. ...Arrived at the spot about 11:30, told host I was on the list, and bam - they let me in without having to stand in line. In my opinion, one of the biggest reasons to stay at a joint like The Bellagio is to take advantage of the perks afforded hotels guests. ...The club is mostly an enclosed area but the back of the room opens to the famous fountains. It was cool to see the water tricks from this perspective. 

The prices for drinks are outrageous. You have to know this, and just be able to deal with it. The truth is - you are experiencing WORLD CLASS nightclub entertainment, and it is costly. The DJ was excellent. Not that he did any amazing scratching - but he kept it moving as well as any I've heard. His mixes and cuts were without mistakes or glitches, and the selection of music was relevant, and included enough hip-hop to keep it from being an EDM fest. 

The peak truly was an amazing sight to be a part of. The lights, music, and natural energy of a Vegas party was everything any club goer could ask for. Did I mention, this was a TUESDAY!?

5370292,2015-05-03,1,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"Hyde is a fun break away from the mega-clubs in Vegas! 

Located inside the Bellagio(which is a where we were staying for this trip)Hyde offers fountain views from the club, if you can work your way though the crowds of people to see them. They have two main bars, one down by the fountain area and one overlooking the dance floor. They gave out free drink tickets in line which was very nice. The bartenders were also very nice and quick.

However, what was not so nice was the admission for my boyfriend and I. Look. I get it. It's Vegas. A couple is never going to walk into a club free of charge, especially the dude. Hyde was charging ladies $20 to get into a smaller club. $20! I have gone to TOA and Liquid beach parties as well as the marquee (all just my boyfriend and I) without being charged a cent. So that seemed a little bit ridiculous. However, if you are apart of M-life you get your admission slashed in half, which is exactly what we did. 

The club itself had a lot of tables in the center of the dance floor as well as around the perimeter. I think this club works best for people celebrating large group events because you can grab a table and use it as your own personal chunk of the dance floor. People who did not have a table were forced to make their own space. Because their is so much seating around the dance floor, I would recommend getting rid of the center tables entirely to  make more room for people who do not buy tables. 

The music was fantastic and came with a confetti drop as well as glow sticks, which was really fun and worth the admission fee. The people at the club were also good, with a nice range of ages and no aggressive or idiot drunk behavior, everyone seemed to be there to have a good time. 

HOWEVER. The reason for the 4-star review and not the 5 are the bouncers/security. Because the walkways of the club are compromised by all the tables, people start dancing in the walkways where bouncers have to move. I was literally shoved twice by two different bouncers that night, hard enough to knock me off my feet. I don't think it is ever acceptable to push/shove a girl, especially when that girl weighs 130 and the bouncer looks to be 300.  I had 1 drink that night(the free one), a touch on the shoulder would have been enough to move me, but shoving me is unacceptable from staff. 

Overall, I would recommend Hyde if you want to experience a smaller club environment or celebrate a large event with a table and really get your moneys worth. The music and atmosphere were great. Just be wary of overly aggressive bouncers and a steep entry fee, even if you are a lady.",t6wSA4lT-KjdmdF_mddplA,3,1,4,HZroSka1pLo8I8z68EdKWg

I took one star off because if you don't have table service, you're definitely left to dance in the walkway, which is passable.  The club itself is not very big, one large room and two smaller rooms to the side.  

If you're having a special event and you get table service, they print your name out on large posterboard and make a big deal about your special event.  Nice touch.

Heat lamps for the uncovered area was also welcoming (compared to Tryst where it's freezing until more people show up).",9Axvn1u7-Hds0U1ulohLMQ,5,0,4,D7cIAI-AP5lBGuYjHjPEkQ
5386525,2013-01-11,3,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"Were celebrating a 50th Birthday in Vegas and wanted to go out without going to a crazy club.  Hyde Lounge (emphasis on the word lounge) sounded like a good place and overall it was.

The place itself is very nice. If you happened to have been here before when it was still the Fontana you will be amazed at the renovations. We had a table, which was on the small side for 10 people, but they make up for it with the drawers located under the seats and the low sitting area above the seats. Our servers were ridiculously attentive to anyone who needed a refill (I prefer to pour my own drink however, so this did not work for me so well). And they do some fun stuff to keep you entertained like blast confetti in the air and pass out glow sticks. The view of the fountains is also pretty incredible (although there are other places at the Bellagio with amazing views - See review for Olives).

The reasons why I am giving it 3 stars however, stems from the following:

1. The place is very small. I understand it is a lounge but if you want to order a drink at the bar or try to dance, you will be packed like a sardine unless you have a table.

2. The ""dancers"" are incredibly creepy. I understand all the cool clubs have dancers in skimpy outfits and that this place is trying to be different, but is it really necessary to have them in ugly wigs and Jason masks on? Worse, is it really necessary for them to quietly come up to you and make you feel like you're at a haunted house instead of a Vegas lounge? I think not. I beg you Hyde Bellagio, please change this. It is super freaky.

3. The music. Maybe I just went on a bad night, or maybe the DJ was drunk because it was his birthday. But while I totally appreciated the variety in genres, it definitely turned into rap/hip-hop hour for a long while and he definitely kept cutting songs off left and right. 

So in short, not the best club I have ever been to but definitely not the worst. Had a great night overall and I think I would give it another shot for sure.",iCqpb2C3TZrB5gdMASf8LQ,4,1,3,lVTmm-QnFKJPigesKBD79g

5443192,2013-10-25,0,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"Hyde at the Bellagio is a smaller and more intimate club versus your typical night club. The club has a very small dance floor, but they have plenty of tables and booths. I'm guessing it's like all other clubs where they offer bottle service. I'm not too sure since I came here for an event so everything was free. 

The service here is very good. The person at the front was very friendly. Once inside you have the option of going up to the bar to get a drink or wait for one of the girls to come around to take your order. On that night they had two bars open with 2 bartenders total. Both were female and they were wearing low-cut vests to show off some cleavage. The girls that come around to the tables were wearing gold dresses. Pretty much all of the workers were female except for a few guys who were serving the food. 

The view here is absolutely beautiful. The windows are completely open and you have an incredible view of the Bellagio fountain show with Paris and Planet Hollywood in the background. The show was playing every 15 minutes so don't worry if you missed one since you'll be able to see about 10 shows during your visit here. 

I would definitely come back here to see how it is when there isn't a private event going on. I feel like each club in Vegas kind of caters to a certain age group. In my opinion this club caters to people who are in their late 20's on up. I also think this club is more for socializing rather than dancing since they have enough seats, but barely any dance floor.

Formally, ""The Fontana Bar and Lounge"" SBE Entertainment and MGM International decided to redesign and rebrand the Fontana Bar to add some nightlife to the Bellagio, I believe it kills the sophisticated and classy theme that makes the Bellagio famous for. Hyde Bellagio is in the same league as the Bond Bar and Chandelier Bar at the Cosmopolitan which is only a 10 - 15 minute walk. In my opinion, those bars have much to offer compared to Hyde. The few things I liked about the this bar / lounge was the close view of the Bellagio Fountains, drinks, and friendly staff. 

It's nice to come by, relax, mingle with tourists, and watch the Bellagio Fountains. The fountains were so close to the lounge, that you can almost feel the mist from the water  jets. I'm not much into the clubbing scene as I was a few years ago but the lounge is a great place to just relax from the casino or whatever. 

TIP: Bellagio guests get in free, just show your room key and you're good to go. Unless they have a special event going on, just have to pay whatever fee they have.",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,7,5,4,wa2yjoNjI1fvGBqRqM--6w

Staff was rude, I mean like extremely rude. They messed up our bottle reservation, then wanted to move us to another table b/c the Director was demanding he had 3 tables for that evening that put them in a tailspin tizzy.  But based on the experiences w/ the staff  I'm not surprised management was floundering around trying to 'make this work'.

This guy stops us and asks us what we were doing that night. We tell him that we were going to go eat and then to a bunch of bars/clubs/etc. He tells us that he works for Hyde and he can put us on the guest list and get us a table with complimentary champagne and vodka. So, one of my friends gives him her name and number, and he adds us to the list. Fast forward a couple of hours to around 10:30, we decide to try this place out. We go up to the door and, like the guy said, we are on the list and we are being led to a table. The club/lounge is nice. It does have a great view of the fountains. But the one thing I noted was that there was a group of girls at every single table. And no one in the place is dancing. Everyone is just standing around, drinking, listening to the loud, but just ok, music being played. When we get to our table, the guy who led us there tells us that we should drink, dance, and look like we are having fun. Two waitresses come up right away and make us drinks with vodka and mixers. Right away I got why we are being treated so nice, we are basically there to make the club look its sooo cool and just THE place to be. And we obviously were not the only girls who were there for this purpose. This is all fine and dandy, I mean, hey, we got in for free, we have a table, and we have free drinks. The issue started when, as the club became more and more full, they began to cram more and more girls into each of the tables. They had obviously promised a lot of girls free tables and drinks. And the people at Hyde kept telling us to dance and smile and drink. After a while it was like really? If the music was good I would dance. If I was having a good time I would smile. The sad thing is that people who did pay to get into the club didn't look like they were having a good time either. It just was kinda lame. Other girls who were put into our table also started telling me how they were not really having fun, either, and how Hyde just seemed to be a joke. We left after less than an hour in the place, because although it was packed, it just wasn't that great. I feel like most Vegas clubs are like that.

They took our jackets and were informed that we had to sit up on the back of the couches, they told us we could stand and dance on the backs too, but we weren't allowed to sit down on the couches like a normal person. They kept security around the booth so that guys could get up close and watch, but they couldn't drink off our bottle and they couldn't dance with us.

We went to Hyde specifically to see our favorite DJ SKRATCHY. He was headlining that night and his musical choices never let us down. He played everything from classic hip hop (which we love) to current radio hits and club grooves. DJ Skratchy even played some Biggie! Yuss!! Thank you for that because it can be rare to hear real hip hop at a club on the Las Vegas strip. We had such a good time and were thrilled to once again see DJ Skratchy rock the crowd.

Our host JC was also very accomodating. He hooked us up with some drink tickets. The drink tix were good for a vodka drink or house champagne. We were grateful for the gesture and we highly recommend JC with your table reservation needs in the future. He will definitely take care of you.

Hyde is smaller than the new Vegas mega clubs but I liked it. We had no complaints. Music was great and drinks were good. The video booth is a nice touch just like Hyde in Hollywood. It's a good memory to have and you can email it to yourself. 

Thank you Hyde for a classic night. We shall return... Tell DJ Skratchy and JC thank you and we hope to see them again real soon. Vegas!",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,6,5,5,5bMi__AMTdq3-lrfZWs3dg

My friend and I were walking up the the Bellagio earlier in the day and we ran into one of their promoters, Malik London, who told us about the promo going on that night - free vodka and champagne for ladies, 10:30 - 1am. Sold! Drinks are always $14+ in Vegas, so that sounded deeeelightful.

We arrived a little after 11 and called Malik who was super friendly and fun and let us know we'd actually be getting a table with free bottle service, our own waitress and security. WHAT. O_O I was dying.

The club was awesome - everyone from the hosts, our promoter and waitress were lovely and treated us like royalty. The view of the Bellagio fountains is spectacular and the music is crazy good. Just the perfect mix of some throwback favorites, current hits and gems that just get everyone excited and dancing. We were dancing on the booths for hours while our waitress poured us as many drinks as we wanted..the perfect Vegas experience on our last night in sin city!! Will be back again for sure.

The GM (I'm guessing) spoke to me and seemed quite friendly. He put me on their guest list after a small conversation and welcomed my friends and I back for free as long as it was before 12. I was also able to walk around inside (during this lounge period) to survey the environment/atmosphere. I'd say Hyde is a very pretty/classy/upscale-esque club but on a small side. The lounge has a view of the Bellagio fountains which I thought was so romantic and beautiful. I'd def come back for an intimate night here with my s/o or a small group of friends.

   Overlooking the iconic Fountains of Bellagio, Hyde Bellagio will mark the first-ever nightlife experience in Las Vegas from SBE and globally acclaimed design icon Philippe Starck. SBE Founder, Chairman and CEO Sam Nazarian collaborated with Bellagio to deliver this spectacular 10,000-square-foot, indoor/outdoor venue. This is 1 of my favorite clubs in Las Vegas, because it's NOT too big, and I love the open door for fresh air coming, a sense of security and easy to navigate in this club.

    Rediscovered as Hyde Bellagio, the villa has been artfully brought back to life by visionary design icon Philippe Starck. Boasting a seamless indoor/outdoor space and floor-to-ceiling windows, Hyde Bellagio features an expansive terrace that showcases Las Vegas' most celebrated landmark, the Fountains of Bellagio. 

    Elevating the décor, Hyde Bellagio introduces an exclusive early-evening experience beginning at 5 p.m. highlighted by an award-winning mixology program and a menu of intriguing small plates. Long after the sun sets, Hyde Bellagio offers 40 VIP tables, a diverse rotation of DJs and live performances.
  
     Introducing LOST ANGELS Tuesdays at Hyde. LOST ANGELS represents a select gathering of insiders and influencers from Vegas and around the world, celebrating the culture, sound and style of Los Angeles from the exclusive confines of Hyde Bellagio.  With an energy that's rogue, sexy and uncompromising, LOST ANGELS provides VIP experience for women and showcases an unprecedented rotation of DJs and musicians whose art has come to define LA's transcendent culture. I saw Nick Jonas performed live here and a few others. When I was here for CES, I saw 50 Cents, and a few other artists and celebs here. They offer resident DJ Travis Baker along with a few others.

+1 part hippity-hoppity-happenin' nightclub
+1 part hip, extravagant ultra lounge
+Several parts gorgeous people
+One badass promoter (Randon Cornett, will get to that later)
** Blend all of this together to produce what is known as Hyde Bellagio.

As you might have guessed from my little set of ingredient, Hyde is essentially the perfect happy medium between a beautiful ultra lounge and a packed, traditional Vegas nightclub...and I think that may be the reason it's one of my new favorite stops in Sin City. While it is not large in terms of square footage (not too many places to hyde...ha, ha, couldn't avoid the pun), they make up for it with their spot-on, wide-ranging music selections, superb bottle service, and overall aesthetics. And how many other clubs are literally 10 feet away from the Bellagio fountains? Uhh, NONE. About their music, I'd venture to say that it's a perfect mish-mash of EDM (my preference), top 40, and that ""old school"" hip-hop that every girl screams at the top of their lungs for-- like middle school girls listening to whatever teeny-bopper pop icon that is popular at the moment...I'll make my appointment for hearing aids soon. 
I have found Hyde to have more of an overarching exclusivity about it-- I have rarely seen those ""questionable"" folk inside (compare to that of Pure...ugh, review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/pure-las-vegas#hrid:Z10vyPsArBMDqTPzaDHJ-Q). Like I've said, Hyde is beautiful, and most clientele inside match the interior design in this way. Pretentious, yes. One has got to have a pretentious side to drop $1,100 on a handle of Goose. But ghetto? Not so much. 

I have been lucky enough to go through a promoter by the name of Randon Cornett. Hands down the best promoter/host I've encountered in Vegas, he has been superb to my groups each time and has always hooked it up for us. PM me for his contact info-- he is definitely more than capable of helping you out with guest list/table rezzys.",qT4Tnxde6kNokU5G4Fhv4A,4,3,4,zsdpEyXuJOOJZPUHtDyNxg

I've had the ""VIP"" treatment before but never on a level like Hyde provided. Our own personal bartender I thought was better than sliced bread. And the view of the fountains had me in a daze. Have to thank my friends Jen and Christina for taking us there. On a Tuesday night the place was packed! Also the security team there did a great job helping my sister get to and from the bathroom with out the trouble of fighting a crowd of people lol. Probably will be back in Vegas in February with a few friends. We already know one of our stops during the trip. It will be to come back to Hyde for a jaw dropping instantly fun night to remember!",FT6cXhd3DAaXATXNTqYD9Q,4,0,5,Bj-n8NYlNRST84P5Vovv6w

He negotiated a great deal on a table for our party and went above and beyond. He texted me updates, met us outside the club and escorted us in. He even got us upgraded to a premium table with a phenomenal view of the fountains. He checked on us several times to make sure we were happy throughout the night and even asked if i was happy with the music. We come to vegas often for business and pleasure. We will definitely be calling Fred again and I suggest you do the same if you want to enjoy in style. Thanks for a memorable and fantastic night!

5910842,2014-12-16,0,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"Quite possibly the BEST dance music on the Strip :) Old school hip-hop mixed with top 40 mixed with just a touch of EDM. Perfect. 

Decor is nothing amazing, but if you want table service, the seating areas looked quite nice and comfy. GREAT VIEW of the Bellagio fountains and Paris. 

Bartenders are friendly and generous with the booze. Security was very respectful/nice. 

Only complaint is that the dance floor is tiny tiny tiny. There is a pretty good crowd here, at least on a Fri night, and it's kinda hard to find a comfy place to dance, but considering how good the music was, we made do!",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,1,1,4,4caGvaCPHyqBlDCro8M3Ew
5911663,2018-04-04,2,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"This hidden gem has one of the best views you can enjoy the fountains from. The cocktails are weak, simple and overpriced as usual. The small bites were nothing exciting nor was the service. Head in for a tall glass of water, relax your tired feet and take in the views for a while.",hmqAOLJmJVNaK4yPg9_1_g,4,3,4,rXsVwU6lRFk2MpMihHLhYQ
5963819,2017-02-26,4,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"Absolutely horrendous. I bought a package that was VIP entry for our bachelorette party group of 10 that included free open bar midnight to 2 am. Well as soon as we get in, I asked how it worked with the open bar. I spoke to a man who said he was the manager who was very rude. He said there was no such package even though I had proof of purchase. I went right back out to the entrance where I was given drink tickets for our group. Um?! So, then everything is fine until 1 am when the bartender said they don't take our tickets anymore. Clearly on the ticket it says until 2 am. She said I could talk to a manager and I said no I'm fine, ok ready to leave this fourth rate club anyways. I'm a local and will NEVER return.",RXSFT4K09Ta6oTdrvFGmCA,3,1,1,ENGojA3mXbQsn7tew7cczQ
5983646,2013-02-19,1,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"For a nightclub, Hyde is REALLY small.  There's just the main room, the outdoor area, and the little other area with the other bar.  All areas are connected and open.

I've been there multiple times and I still don't know if they have a dance floor and where it is.  The famed view of the Bellagio fountains is still my favorite and I do love seeing the show when I'm there although you can't hear the fountains music because of the club music.  Other than that, Hyde is just okay.  

The waitresses aren't very friendly, even when you have table service.  One night, our waitress disappeared so we asked another girl who was just standing there if she could help us.  She just scoffed and told us our table wasn't in her section and then continued to stand there. Oh well.  The security guys are normally nicer when you have table service.  They introduce themselves and check in on you if you have table service.  The last time I was there we were outside near the fountains and the bouncer kept coming around asking if we wanted the heating lamps turned on and if we were doing okay.  That was much appreciated.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend going to Hyde unless you have table service.  It's too small and awkward inside to stand around while people are trying to dance since there's no real dance floor.  I really do still love the view and really only like Hyde because of it.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,5,2,3,Y0sfXNOWVDTzIt3K0g5m9w

The light show of the dancing fountains are amazing, but they could have designed the lounge to have better views!",DT2rrnOzGmBSItlotPIIKg,0,1,3,aB7Q6OHjmkVsHY6CHurJBA
5985720,2018-03-06,0,K7fip0nDFFdCC7OCnNOotQ,"Nice size club without being to packed when you walk around.  Spacing of sections is awesome and with more than one bar it pulls people in different directions instead of everyone piling up and waiting in line.

The view from this place is awesome!  It overlooks the fountain and you have a clear view of much of the strip.

Outdoor and indoor space to roam all of which allow you to hear the DJ clearly.

We were there when DJ CLA was there and she had the vibe that everyone was enjoying with a good mix of edm, top 40 and hip hop.",sGI1svtG_retrGgnythe1g,1,0,4,YqM_P7Nmyu7tzd-7fpBQfg
