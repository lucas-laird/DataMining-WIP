Then we had the Japanese sweet corn which was yummy. The pork cheek gnocchi was perfect and awesome. The lamb crepinettes had good flavor these were ground lamb, not pieces of lamb. 

The cocktails here are thoughtful and well crafted. Liked the deer in the headlights. Coulda had two or three of those, easily. Too bad it was a school night....

Will definitely come back again.

The side of potatoes was good- crispy with a Cajun kick. The ""Improved Mule"" cocktail was refreshing, citrusy, and effervescent.

Starters: we had the Spicy Pork Rinds. The best way I can explain them would be an adult version of Cheetos. Don't let the make fool you cause their not spicy. We loved them! 

Plates: I had the Wood Roasted Chicken Hash and my fiancé had the Benedict. The Chicken Hash was flavorful and moist not dry it came with Texas toast but I didn't care for. The Benedict doesn't come with the traditional muffin they make their own bread and it's spongy and delicious.

Drinks: Glutton Mary & Pappes Peaches. The kimchi in the Glutton Mary gives it a kick it's great for hangovers and it comes with a hudge shrimp. The Pappes Peaches has a smooth peppery Peach taste

Service was okay. We were sold on the special which was a salted caramel French toast. Really too sweet and the bread was cut in such huge chunks that it didn't cook right - the center core was dry and bready, the rest of it was very eggy and a bit undercooked. Probably would have been better as French toast sticks. The baked tomato and egg dish was lighter and seemed to eat more like a dip. Took us a minute to figure out how to eat it, but it was pretty tasty. The kale was nice with it. Coffee was alright- nothing special. I should have ordered the charcuterie panini - that's particularly delicious.

Plates are small and intended for sharing. We ordered a few to start and figured we'd delve deeper into the menu as needed. 

They have a pretty good beer selection. I'm always pleased when I find Deschuetes Fresh Squeezed IPA ($7). It was a short wait for our first dish, which was the Brown Butter Gnocchi ($16). It was the most hearty of the three ordered. I didn't expect it first, but we didn't mind digging in. The sum of its parts were good, but it fell a bit flat. Underseasoned and the gnocchi were a bit doughy. 

We were served the Buffalo Sweetbreads ($12) next. These were flavorful and a playful twist, but it left me wishing the sweetbreads were chicken. The hot sauce was a distraction from everything I love about sweetbreads. The delicate sweet creaminess was completely lost. 

The last dish to arrive was the Truffle Gougeres ($8). I was anticipating airy bites with gooey truffle cheese centers. They were gooey, but not so airy and just a hint of truffle was noted. The dough was so bland. It was in desperate need of salt. It was a let down.

Three strikes and we were out of there. I really wanted to like Glutton. On the surface, it seemed like a winner, but when it came down to execution it missed the mark. I was rather bummed, I had hoped for more. Especially at that price point. It's a shame too, because the menu is intriguing. I hear brunch is good; perhaps, that's the better choice?

I consider myself a pretty avid foodie and a big burger lover, and the top burgers in town thus far have been consistently Bachi and Gordon Ramsey.  The Best burger I've ever had was at Bradley Ogden at Caesars Palace and my burger world has not been the same since they closed back in 2012.  Even with Ogden's short lived place at Tivoli Village, the burger just wasn't quite the same there.
Thank you Glutton for bringing me back to the pure joy of biting into a burger and instantly knowing that this is something special and different!  
The glutton burger is different than the Bradley Ogden burger.  The BO burger was served with meat, bun and cheese if you wanted.  That's it...condiments on the side.
The Glutton burger prides itself on fresh made everything.  They've added a sweeter bun, homemade butter pickles, onion, lettuce and homemade cheese.  ""Everything from scratch,"" our waitress bragged!  And rightfully so.  I honestly have not had a burger that juicy since BO.  
So, mix this delicious patty in with a slew of condiments and you have a different, delicious gourmet burger experience. 
Imagine an awesome gourmet Big Mac!  Some may say, eew...Big Mac? But MickeyD's has it's place in burger lore (and I have found memories of eating my first Big Mac as a kid), I mean, it's what we grew up with.  I honestly haven't had a Big Mac in 20 years, but the Glutton burger is like (what I remember of) a Big Mac on steroids, with fresh greens and extra juicy flavor.
Top it off with a side of mushroom poutine fries (another favorite of mine...poutine!  Well done Canucks) and this is the best one/two punch in town!  But go for the burger, and the burger, and the burger.
Thank you for this Glutton...

1448103,2015-08-20,16,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"With a name like Glutton, I was expecting indulgent food- but there was nary a bone marrow, truffle-infused, or deep-fried dish on the menu, just your typical trendy-upscale-urban take on new American. Not that I'm complaining, it just doesn't fit with the logo and restaurant name.

PICKLED TOMATOES: Really, this dish should be called ""whipped ricotta WITH pickled tomatoes"" as the portion contains maybe six tomatoes and a fluffy heap of cheese. While I enjoyed this dish (hello, cheese and tomatoes with bread, what's not to love?!) and the criminally smooth texture, the flavors were a bit too subtle: cheese was mild to the point of being almost flavorless and the pickled tomatoes lacked any sort of vinegary or briney ""pickled"" taste. 
FURIKAKE STREET CORN: I'm not a huge corn fan, but I ordered this dish because it's getting rave reviews. It was just okay. A bit too much oil, but nicely charred kernels and interesting seasonings. 
WATERMELON & FETA SALAD: If the word ""feta"" is in the dish name, I expect more than a scant half-tablespoon in the entire salad. The salty, creamy notes that the cheese adds to this dish were almost nonexistent due to the skimpy portion used. That said, the textures and subtle sweetness of the watermelon, tomato, and cucumber together made for a fresh, vibrant summer dish.

Service was decent during my visit, and I enjoyed my seat at the kitchen bar watching the chefs in action. None of the dishes I ordered really lived up to the hype, or to the restaurant name. Perhaps dessert is where the gluttony kicks in: the PB&C and profitroles both sound great, I'll have to come back another time to find out.

ETA: It's not going to change my rating or anything, but the ""Buy a round for the kitchen for $5 to show your appreciation"" on the menu is extremely tacky.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,14,3,oR408o75W0lD4M5WsGagJg

For snacks/starters, we had the Spicy Pork Rinds and Pickled Tomatoes. Oh man... The Pork Rinds reminded me Cheetos, only infinitely better! The Pickled Tomatoes was a better version/play on Caprese. LOL. Maybe I just like grilled bread with a spread a lot more?
Most of the group ordered and liked their Glutton Burger. I think the only downside was that the boyfriend's and our friend's burgers got mixed up - meat was cooked differently. No biggie though. I most definitely liked my Spaghetti Carbonara. The poached egg made the sauce creamier, and Shiitaki mushrooms were definitely used right. Not to mention I rarely see it on menus, so it was a good change, especially as a substitution to bacon. Weird, right?

Highlights:
Whipped Ricotta - spring peas, mint, pistachio chutney, grilled focaccia
Chicken Liver Mousse - bread & butter pickles + grilled bread
Carlsbad Oysters - banyuls mignatte, cucumber
Bread & Butter - house made parker house rolls, breakfast radish, cultured butter
Brown Butter Gnocchi - braised pork cheek, soy, safe, pine nut gremolata
Creekstone Farms Sirloin - peas & carrots, red wine reduction

I would order the ricotta again in a heart beat and loved the use of veggies throughout all the dishes. I'm not a huge oyster fan, but I saw them come out of the kitchen and had to give them a try.

The chicken liver mousse was everything we had hoped for. Creamy, flavorful & spot fricken on! That also comes with toasted bread so by the time we were finished with the two we were overstuffed! 

Oh, I almost forgot the pig roast cocktail. It is very interesting. Smoky & bacon flavored & definitely unique.

Clean, modern, intimate & cozy is how this place feels & looks and I really enjoyed the space. Great job on every detail! One big downer was the air conditioning. We were warm throughout the entire meal which really sucked. It's over 100 in Vegas everyday now and I need some serious air action everywhere I go.

The cocktails are interesting & ambitious and they helped with the temperature issue. The Merica cocktail was perfection. The Japanese corn was so sweet & equally salty from spices, great start to any meal. The fig & prosciutto pizza was again a great balance of sweet & savory and then the star of the show, the brown butter gnocchi! Show stopper! The gnocchi were little light pillows of heaven & the pork cheek was drenched in decadent sauce that was incredibly flavorful. 

Everything we tasted was brilliant except for the dessert. Ending on a disappointing note sucked and with us sweating at dinner I couldn't give them a 5 star rating but the food & service really deserved it. The dessert was supposed to be chocolate cream crullers. What we received were dense hot doughnuts with watery chocolate sauce and a cream foam.

1703770,2015-10-01,2,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"So this is where all the good food is hiding in Vegas. Whenever in Vegas, I always hate dining at the restaurants on the Strip. I feel like they're all tourist traps and the food is always overpriced and mediocre at best, minus the (very few) exceptions. Skip the mediocre and pretentiousness go discover the hidden gems that are in Downtown.

Staying on Fremont St over the weekend, I wanted to checkout a nearby restaurant for Breakfast. As soon as we walked up to EAT, we saw the humongous line outside and quickly decided it was not worth the wait. Went across the street and discovered Glutton! At first, I wasn't sure of the place as the name of the restaurant suggested they probably had unhealthy options. As soon as we walked in though, I was pleasantly surprised with the decor and atmosphere and the FOOD...omg the FOOD looked amazing and unique and oh so Instagram worthy. Scoping around at everyone's tables, I knew we were in the right place.

They were pretty busy but the kitchen bar area was open so we took it. Needless to say, I was really impressed with our meal, drinks, and service. Even though they were really busy, they never forgot to attend to us. We love this place so much, we came back twice during our stay. 

What we ordered:
- Pork Benedict
- Chicken hash
- Breakfast salad
- Chicken salad sandwich
- Cinnamon roll
- Lemon coffee cake
- And coffee...make sure to get their coffee! It's SO GOOD.

I really appreciated their amazing service and attentiveness. Totally different experience than other Vegas restaurants on the Strip. Couldn't recommend this place enough, every item we ordered were nothing less than perfect...just take a look at these pics!",q841aGW6y2D3OwSRB6w6nw,6,5,5,soFVaD68Y5Tu7IRjg0cRzg

The cooks and the bartender are allowed to be creative with their craft which in turn allows them to be passionate about what they do and really put love into what they make! I ordered the zucchini Parmesan which is vegetarian (btw I'm am NOT vegetarian I LOVE meat) and I was Worried this wouldn't satisfy or fill me but man was I wrong!!!! Not only did it satisfy me but I was super full. It was a sandwich that consisted of fried zucchini with arugula, tomato sauce, burrata and of course Parmesan and fries on side. It was delicious!!!! To top it off the bartender let us try new drinks he was creating for the new menu.

1747045,2016-02-27,0,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"We are always looking for an informal not too expensive place to eat dinner before going to the Smith Center. Based on the reviews, Glutton seemed to be a reasonable option. It is located 5 minutes from the Smith Center across the street from the Container Park.
Ambience: very informal in a very hip type of way. No tablecloths, unpadded seats, a couple of high top tables, exposed vent ceiling, open kitchen, relatively small bar with a TV in the rear, Spartan decorating.
Service: our server, Stacy, was at our table almost immediately after we sat down. She was very warm and welcoming. She explained several of the items on the menu. We needed time to navigate the menu and she was appropriate in giving us that time. There were 5 servers working the room with only about 15 tables in the room. Service was very attentive,  excellent. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I did not find the service overbearing. Stacy checked in on us at reasonable intervals to make sure that we did not need anything.
Food: the menu is really very limited. The night we wish here there were only 8 cases for small plates 7 cases for large plates, and one flat bread. Stacy explained that the menu varies depending on what is in season, and that should be a good thing. When you were trying to share dishes, finding things that each of you would like on a limited menu is a bit of a challenge. We ended up choosing the ahi tuna tacos from the small plates and the cavatelli and short rib from the large plate menu. The chef should get bonus points for the presentation of each of the dishes. The taco dish came with 4 small tacos in a very crisp shell. The ahi was garnished with sweet chili guacamole, frisee, and pickled Fresno pepper. Delish. The short rib dish came with a fairly small piece of short rib in a bowl with confetti, some wild mushrooms, & a large dollop of truffle mousse. All of that swimming in a beef broth. Quite tasty. Best described as comfort food. The best dish of the night was the desert. Caramel corn profiteroles. A great way to finish the meal.
Value: the overall dining experience was just what I was looking for. Informal, relatively quick. However, I feel it was a bit pricey for what you got.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,1,1,4,qDCeu3VKIkX-ApKklLHACg

Alex was the bartender on duty and he was fantastic!  There was another bartender at the beginning and I didn't catch his name BUT Alex was perfect.  He knew the drinks and he knew the food.  Guided me and my friend to great drinks and great food.  :)

We started out with the whipped ricotta and picked tomatoes.  The bread that was served with it was perfect. Perfectly charred to add flavor whatever you are eating with it. I spread on the whipped ricotta and was thinking that it might be a little bland as ricotta unless it is seasoned heavily tends to be bland.  Boy was I wrong.  It was delicious.  Add the tomatoes and it adds a different nuance to the entire plate.  It was so good. :)

We also ordered the chicken liver mousse with port wine reduction If u don't like stuff like this don't order it BUT if u love this kind of stuff...ORDER it.  Lol it was delicious.  It was so creamy and full of flavor but it was not heavy at all. It was very light and very airy and the port wine reduction added just the right amount of sweetness to the dish.  :)

Then we had the glutton burger with mushroom poutine fries as a side.  Alex let us know that we could just make the fries into the poutine instead of getting fries on top of fries as we had been considering getting the poutine as an extra side.  :)  We also got another side of the shredded Brussel sprouts (our healthy dish of the night....lol).  So ask the server/bartender....u never know how they will guide u. 

The burger was juicy and well seasoned. Yummy!!!! :) The mushroom poutine....mushroom and cheesy heaven.  Lol The Brussel sprouts....healthy and yet delicious!!!!

I almost forgot the drinks.  Lol they had rodenbach grand cru on tap!  I love sour beers and it is rare for me to find one on tap.  So that totally made my day.  :)  they also had a stout....and yup normally I do not like stout beers....BUT this was so yummy!  It had strong coffee and chocolate tones and it was not heavy at all.   This might convert me to like stouts! Lol but get there soon as when the barrel is gone....so is that stout!!!! :)

I have been here to eat 4 different times, tried something different everytime, and left feeling gluttonous and satisfied each time. Service is always amazing as ive been in groups of 4, 2 and myself and its aleays consistent. My drinks r never empty, the servers and bartenders r easy to strike up a covo with but not overbearing. I had the benedict which was amazing, calamari fries with unagi sauce which i had to finish because the flavors were too mind blowing to share. Ive tried the curry cauliflower which was so flavorful especially considering i dont like cauliflower and id order this again. Ice had smoked sea bass on a crostini type bread and i made my friend (who HATES fish) try it and she didn't believe me it was fish and took a second bite! The bloody mary is def top 2 of the best bloody marys I've ever had. Its huge and has a ginormous prawn on it only complaint is my NOTHING! hard to believe with hiw picky i am but true! 

 Now my favorite part of glutton as a restaurant my very first time coming in my server was amazing his name is Justin and he recommended for me to get the glutton burger man was I happy I trusted him. This burger is huge for starters the meat was cooked perfectly and still had its juices and flavor and was so tender the pickles we're so good I wish I could buy a jar of them to take home. And recently I found out they make the pickles in house it came with some skinny shoestring fries and I love french fries and a burger but I didn't even touch my fries as his burger was so amazing I'm not sure what kind of cheese it comes with but it's one of the best cheeses I've ever had instantly a timeless classic everybody who comes to this restaurant needs to try this burger you will not be disappointed!!",EzHwCfCdB8ugVK1AryL4Zw,0,0,5,itlaULf4wi5E1Tf9Fho0tg

A new American menu using local ingredients with a fresh open kitchen and wood burning oven, community seating or regular.  We took the community seating, got to mingle with a couple from the Las Vegas area, who loved this restaurant. I had the baked eggs in roasted tomato sauce and crunchy kale- Omg, so delish, eggs were a bit overdone, but it was cooked in their wood oven so the entire dish has a bit of a smoked flavor the tomato sauce was fresh chunky, seasoned well and superb, kale was fresh and made this delicious.  Also had their zucchini muffin, served warm in a square pan, sweet, light airy and fresh served with a side of maple butter, so delicious as a starter for under 5 bucks. Hubby got the French toast with fresh fruits of strawberry and blueberries with warm real maple syrup, 2 thumbs up.  The menu is great, execution of dishes and fresh ingredients are superb, very crowded with locals and some tourists, but they know where to find good food!

You definitely don't run out of dip before you run out of things to dip in it. And that's a rarity. The shrimp were large, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked.

I suppose I could gush all night about the blending of flavors, the surprising presentation of the eggplant (kinda like a chunky salsa or jam), the creamy texture of the grits, the curry that didn't overpower the cauliflower, the root veggie dish that I could honestly eat every day, the perfectly seared scallops, and the wonderful smell and taste of rich dark chocolate, but I will spare you.

2288521,2015-06-17,6,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"Terrible terrible arrogant manager. It's a shame, because it's a cute restaurant with decent food, and I love to try and support new local places. Their manager is so poorly skilled at problem resolution and exudes so much arrogance, it's appalling. I was charged twice (not authorizations, actual posted charges). But I only signed for one charge. I called and was polite and friendly and wanted to have them reverse the 2nd charge. 

He basically told me it was my responsibility to prove this charge wasn't mine, that I needed to provide him with the authorization number, that I needed to contact my bank, that I needed to bring receipts, etc. Why should I have to do all this work for a charge that wasn't mine, that I didn't sign for???? I asked to speak to the owner, and he said ""We are in the middle of lunch and he is busy, and just the fact that I took your call (you are lucky)."" I said, ""wow you are unbelievable"" he said, ""YES I AM"".

Wow...awful. I love to support local businesses, but never will I go back here. And I am filing fraud charges with my bank. They ran my card and put through a charge I DID NOT SIGN FOR. Be cautious.",2dUCHVOx0jt37JKa-oVEQA,12,7,1,qr7N0H23pHemKj9uNBcpdg

Atmosphere: Open, inviting, plenty of seating. Good for Family style or for adventurous first dates.  I'll be honest, we started the evening by putting our name on a waiting list for Carson's Kitchen, as we had previously eaten there and it was great... but they wanted us to wait ""30-40 minutes"" when over 1/2 the restaurant was open! I used to be a hostess so I know how to account for a wait list and that was ridiculous. We were walking past Glutton while we were waiting and saw a fellow we knew so we joined in and they accommodated the change from 2 people to 6 in a breeze.

Food:
Watermelon Salad. Order two or don't order it.
Japanese Street Corn is the better version of  Mexican street corn
Squid Ink Linguine- Black like my soul but light on the flavor, don't be scared
Shaved Brussels, easy.
I wish we had been able to try Garganelli!!
I can't stop, order everything, you won't be disappointed.
We had 6 small plates and 3 large plates among 5 people and it was just enough to leave room for three decadent desserts.  you Must have the desserts if you enjoy living. 

The service!!! What a team! It's not a regular place where just one server takes your order and brings your food, the chef, the bartender, the entire staff are there to make sure that everything is timed to a T and delivered to exceed. It was 104 in Vegas and none of our water glasses ran dry even once. 

We tried to go back again, but it was a Monday and they were closed. I can't even be mad about it because if I owned a business I would be closed Monday too.",FY7sB0TJdAIgb7QNUrHn5w,0,0,5,XjTQsgfYQyXUtwK-vZ7exQ

2394280,2015-05-27,0,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"This place is welcomed addition to the downtown scene!  I looked through Eater to find a new spot that was hot on the map and landed here.  We live on the West side and try to make it downtown to the more local scene as much as we can and in the midst of all the new commotion that is happening in the Carson street area Glutton hits the mark!  

We had the Peach and Burrata Salad, of which my girlfriend fought me for the last bite with her fork in trident position, the Brown Butter Gnocchi (a bit over cooked, but the braised pork cheek was so tender and had beautiful flavor), the Half Chicken (Chicken was juicy and had a wonderful wood fired skin that I stole immediately) and the Carmel Corn Profiteroles.  My only disappointment is that the Profiteroles seemed a bit on the store bought side and had no flake to them, but the flavor of the dessert and the carmel corn was really tasty, (mind you I am not a dessert guy, but I do love me some salted caramel anything really.).

It has a Patio in the back for those who don't want to hang in the main restaurant dining area, (which was FRIGED!! ), a small bar to the back of the restaurant that seats 5-6 max and the general decor is somewhat thought out but looks a bit standard with lots of two top tables that you find in a local pizza shop.  Cute and unpretentious but doesn't do the food justice.

All in all the food was great, the service was exactly as we wanted it, (I like to be left alone so I can actually enjoy my meal without being bothered every 2 minutes).  We had Brad and he was solid with lots of suggestions.  The only thing I might suggest is that you also inform your other staff of what is actually on the menu.  They didn't seem very aware of the food or have knowledge of it in any real sense.  Everyone should know your menu from the Chefs to the bussers, you never know who will ask a question and you should never hear ""I don't know"".  How about ""I'll get someone who can answer your question more accurately as I have yet to try that dish.""  Just a thought.

It's refreshing to be able to stop in without trekking miles. I've been for lunch and dinner which were both really yummy. I look forward to returning to try more options.

These are the menu items I've tried and wholeheartedly recommend:

Zucchini Parmesan Sandwich - The burrata, basil aioli, arugula, san marzano tomatoes, parmigiano reggiano were a fabulous compliment to the zucchini, so many great flavors going on. 

Truffle Gourgeres - Split these with my Hubs. Warm, cheesy, gooey, flavorful deliciousness. I could make a meal of these. Perfect accompaniment with a glass of crisp white wine or an ice cold martini

Mushroom Poutine - A very messy interesting dish with good flavor.  Great for splitting with friends and chasing with a cold beer.

Glutton Burger - Huge!  I had a bite and it was GOOD!

Brown Butter Gnocchi with Braised Pork Cheeks - I saved the best for last... This dish seriously made me weak in the knees.  The braised pork cheeks were tender and delectable.  The sauce was beyond sublime, it reminded me of my Culinary school days & my Saucier class. (I gained 10 pounds that semester!) the gnocchi was perfect & I loved the texture and how it was lightly grilled outside.

Everyone from host to wait staff to Dean (the awesome bartender) to the Chef were friendly and welcoming.  I truly hope this place makes it in the tumultuous restaurant world.  I want to make this my regular place for a long time to come.",BiO3EO18YJeRn9VQPAnVcg,0,0,5,li3WF8ulEHMi9NMj7LcyFQ
2490118,2015-07-20,2,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"Had a date night here last week and was expecting something similar to Carson's Kitchen or eat but I was pretty disappointed.

I was surprised that the place wasn't too busy - it was 7:30. Maybe that's too early? I'm not sure. Anyway, the minute we sat down it all pretty much went to shit. 

Our waitress started out nice but by the end of the meal - I'm so sorry to say - she was beyond overbearing. In fact, the staff felt overbearing. The waitress came to us four different times in a matter of 10 minutes to ask if we decided what we wanted. It was our first time and we were still looking over the menu. Finally the final time, instead of asking for a couple more minutes, she hovered over us until we ordered. When she asked if we wanted alcohol and we said no, she rolled her eyes. I looked over at the bartender who seemed pretty bored so I figured she's just trying to give him something to do. We told her we aren't drinking at the moment yet she continued to offer us alcohol for the duration of our meal. Even with dessert.

Our dishes slowly started coming out one by one and for each dish our waitress thought it would be cool to explain, in detail, the different ways that people eat them and two times even talked to us for an annoyingly three minutes straight on her personal life and her son and past customers, etc. I appreciate the enthusiasm (for lack of a better word), but we are really just trying to have a date night and talk. I don't need to hear about your son's birthday experience in full detail. And OMG, not to mention that you take two sips of your water and someone IMMEDIATELY comes to refill your glass. After a while it was just a distraction. I drink a lot of water which meant that every couple minutes - literally COUPLE of minutes - someone came by and interrupted to fill the glass. Not once was my glass half empty and it became such a distraction because they were also constantly walking by to get to a table near you and this place isn't even big.

The food was blah. The Brussels sprouts salad was way too dressed, the ""spicy"" pork rinds literally tasted like cheetos except on a pork rind instead of a chip (complete with orange stained fingers) and it wasn't spicy at all. The popcorn ice cream was good but I was hoping that the bread the ice cream was in was warm - something on that plate should've been warm. The only dish I enjoyed was the gnocchi. For the prices I will not be coming back to this place. I didn't enjoy myself.",zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,9,2,1,s37-HVocLAjb8RvFep1fdA

I have yet to indulge in dinner, but after 2 very filling brunches, I can't wait to return. 
Both times I have dined, were Saturday mornings, and upon arrival the place was dead! 
WHY it was dead confuses the hell outta me, because the food is delicious and the service is superb. 
I highly recommend the proper breakfast sandwich if you like sausage. Its a patty that's like a burger! And the peach waffle with mascarpone whip and bourbon syrup, need I say more?
I also really enjoyed the cocktails. The 'Merica is like an adult lemonade. The Evan's colors is a refreshing cucumber cocktail. And the Glutton Mary, is pretty much an appetizer as it comes with pickled veggies and a big ol shrimp! Speaking of cocktails, right now they are doing a ""parking meter payout"". Basically, show that you paid to park weekdays between 4:30 and 6:30 PM, (after work crowd) and get 2-4-1 cocktails. Sign me up for 'Merica's til I can't walk please!
I can't wait to try more food here. Welcome to downtown Vegas, Glutton.

2595405,2015-10-06,60,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"Inhaling copious amounts of food is the idea, unfortunately that's not the case here. The portions are miniature and barely enough for one person; if you want to share, that's pushing it. I understand the high prices reflect the area of downtown, yet the entire dinner I was left wanting more from each dish; the 4 tablespoon portions were a tease. My date and I struggled sharing the food since we had to be mindful to conserve a fair taste for each other. I've dined at ""small plate"" style restaurants in downtown, for example Carson Kitchen and didn't have this issue.

Brandade Rangoon $11 (salt cod, garlic, potato, cream cheese, honey) - These were imaginative and a unique spin on our beloved crab Rangoon. I tasted the subtle salt cod, the garlic and potato was smooth and the cream cheese made it velvety. I loved the pop of sweetness that the honey added - I just wished they added more or drizzled it on top of the Rangoon. Rated: 4/5

Japanese street corn $5 (miso butter, furikake, chives) - I appreciate it being served cored, making it easy to eat. Also, lots of the corn bits were charred and crispy adding a wonderful texture. It was slightly sweet and delicately seasoned by the miso butter and chives. I didn't taste or see the furikake, but the corn was still tasty regardless. Rated: 4/5

Brown butter gnocchi $16 (braised pork cheeks, soy, sage, pine nut gremolata) - The overall dish was lacking salt and it could use texture. I found the soft gnocchi average and the braised pork cheeks boring. Try dumping all of your Japanese street corn into the brown butter gnocchi - we loved that combination! The gnocchi needed some crisp texture and that really helped! Rated: 3/5

We really wanted to try the maple & mascarpone cheesecake with walnut crust, blueberry & preserved lemon, but alas they ran out. So we opted for the Churro & hot chocolate $8 (cinnamon sugar churros, chipotle spiced hot chocolate, & marshmallow) - The hot chocolate's ""chipotle spice"" flavor was super weak and it was served room temperature. Even after they warmed it up for us, it was not something I wanted to continue drinking. The churros were moist and custard-y inside, but everything was a total lackluster for me. If I'm going to consume the extra calories, I want it to taste better than OK. Rated: 3/5

3 ""small plates"" a drink and dessert totaled $46.49. The food was decent but not a knockout, there were too many simple mistakes that could have saved the meal. They weren't busy when we arrived, yet the service was off: distracted hostess, under-seasoned dish, unavailable dessert item on the menu, hot cocoa served room-temperature & a forgotten soda - these minor issues added up to a forgettable dining experience.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,68,68,3,G3rQxNVMFPCpOUn5e0AMvA
2668561,2015-10-28,5,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"Sometimes being a glutton for delicious food tends to backfire in your face (or stomach).  Such was the case of my experience at Glutton.  My gut instinct was telling me to walk away when the buzzing of house flies made it a mini-game of keep away as we swatted around our food to protect it.  Surely, if that weren't enough to turn us away, it would be the undercooked noodles, that paired with their braised short rib, or the distasteful rangoon made from some type of fish (my wife and I were not fans.)  

However, we were in the area and while my wife could not eat the food, I did not want it (and our money) to go to waste so I took it down.   It was a stupid decision for me and a lifelong lesson to remember.

That night (without having eaten anything else but this food) I awoke up to extreme cramping and eventual trips to the bathroom on multiple occasions.  I eventually kept throwing up even with nothing left to throw up.  For 24 hours I could not keep anything down and I was confined to my bed room and my puke bag.  It was not an experience I ever want to feel again.

Life-lesson learned?  Do not eat something that your gut-instinct is telling you to push away.  Secondly, if the store just opened its doors for dinner (5 PM) and there are already house flies annoying buzzing around, it's time to fly away yourself.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,5,3,1,gDcWOKRRMi1m6lyotHN1Vg

I've been twice now, once for lunch with coworkers and again for lunch with my mom. Both times the food was so-so, (improvement the 2nd time around), but the service was just very very strange both times. I can only assume they are still working out opening kinks and finding their groove! 

On the first visit there were 5 of us, and there weren't enough plates or silverware at the table, and it took a reallllllyyyy long time to get someone's attention to get extra plates, even after our appetizers arrived, so we had to wait to eat them. There were also random french fries scattered around the chairs and floor from the people who had sat their prior to us, that we kept finding throughout the meal. It was hard to get water refills, or anything else we needed for that matter. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which was just SO bland. It was as if someone forgot the salt and seasoning entirely, and just put some diced chicken on a piece of wheat bread....really odd. Others said they liked the burger and panini, so perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. We did all enjoy the whipped ricotta appetizer. 

The next time I was there with my mom, service again was quite weird. The server kept bringing her extra sodas without asking if she wanted any more, and also before she had finished even half of the first one...and this happened twice. The entrees were dropped before our appetizer plate was cleared which is my biggest pet peeve, and then the bill was dropped not even 2 minutes after we had taken our first bite. 

I got the Togarashi chicken sandwich, which was much better than the chicken salad sandwich and quite large...and the side salad was great. My mom didn't care for the side salad because it was almost half chicory and/or fennel leaves which I happen to LOVE, but is super overpowering and can be a really unique taste for people who don't like it. I wonder if that was intentional or if the line cook got it confused with arugula... :P She really liked her panini as well, so we were both happy with our meals, but again- weird experience! It's definitely not a cheap lunch either, works out to about $20 pp. Am bound to go back due to the proximity to my office but not jumping at the chance...",bkcWR-bVxx4wjRkjZdUfNQ,2,1,3,8l2Z3TAD9bYzxkj5CHmTJQ

From our hotel on the main strip, it's about a $20 cab ride to this location. The restaurant is located on a corner and they have a few tables for outdoor seating. It was chilly (60s) with the sun out, so we ate inside. The venue reminded me very much of being in the PNW..with the dark wood floors, and brushed metal finishes on the furniture.

I ordered their benedict which arrives stacked high. Due to the chopped fresh tomatoes (not quite a pico de gallo, but close) my hollandaise was tepid. The eggs were solid, which bummed me out but I was hungry and the dish was otherwise tasty, I didn't complain. The portion was just tipping to overfull, which was a plus. 

I had read about how to order water while in Vegas, and here the server admitted that she didn't know if their tap was filtered or not, so we opted for a bottled Fiji and hot water (which has been boiled at least?). It was interesting. Service was otherwise attentive and patient. She chatted with us when we asked for recommendations on stuff to do while in the area.

I went there with a girlfriend and we sat at the chef's bar. Our waitress let us know that they have sort of a sharing concept there which is great for me because I want to try as many dishes as I can. 
We started with the pickled spring tomatoes. It came on top of whipped ricotta and served with fresh grilled bread. The bread melts in your mouth, the ricotta is perfectly creamy and the tomatoes burst in your mouth with flavor. It was outstanding!
For entrees, my friend ordered the Squid Ink Pasta which was lovely and they didn't shy on the crab meat at all.
I ordered Creekstone Farms Sirloin that was served on top of smoked chili whipped potatoes. Beautifully cooked and the flavor was spot on.
Finally, after seeing all the pictures on yelp of the desserts, we had to try one. We got the peach cobbler and man, was it good! It was served with a bourbon butterscotch sauce and ricotta & ginger ice cream. Amazing!!! We were able to watch the chefs make a batch right in front of us which is a plus.
They have a great brunch menu and I have to come back and try lunch and at least four other things on the dinner menu. 
You have to try this place! Carson kitchen took the cake last year for downtown eating, and Glutton is taking it this year.",7gSwABACGPVrRvWlO5ORGA,1,2,5,bapimpt9htz76vGTBdgyVw

Upon entering Glutton you'll quickly settle into the casual vibe and it's hard to miss the wide open kitchen. I love open kitchens as you know that the food is most likely going to rock with an emphasis on cleanliness, showmanship and quality ingredients on display. Our seat at the bar with our server/bartender/city guide/wealth of knowledge/all around nice guy, Dean gave us a front row seat of the food flowing from the kitchen, crafty cocktails and the outside lightning strikes. 

We decided that sharing a bunch of plates was the way to go and jumped into several of the recommended dishes. The whipped ricotta with tomatoes and bread got the big wheels turning, but I'll instantly fast forward to my two highlights. The beef cheeks and the salmon. 

The beef cheeks were fall-apart tender, served over a bed of homemade gnocchi and kissed with a rich sauce that was beyond delicious. This dish could have been three times the size and I would have devoured it all. 

The salmon was one of the best pieces of salmon that I have ever tasted. I don't even remember how it was plated and it really doesn't matter as the salmon itself was absolutely ridiculous. The chef showed some serious technique on this hearty filet, which was extremely crispy (not burnt) on the exterior, but perfectly cooked to a juicy medium on the inside. We could have scrapped for the last bite but played nicely and each offered the final morsel to each other. True gentlemen I tell ya.

Thanks for a fantastic dinner and I'll definitely be back to see you next time I'm in town, Glutton.",aIJ-2R1q5G7oqzBSgK_Vvw,16,18,5,LQNr-sESMZG6Ms5RU5hjgw

2778542,2016-02-11,6,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"This is one of my new favorite restaurants. I've been about three times now and have been impressed with each meal. Their ""small plates"" section is loaded with some gems. Ingredients like beets and brussel sprouts are common at many restaurants these days, but their spin on them makes them anything but boring. Roasted root vegetables were charred and tender and made even better with a poached egg on top.

House made pastas are always great, particularly the butternut squash agnolotti with celery root puree and black truffles. For a larger and more savory dish, the cavatelli and short rib is excellent. The hearty, beefy flavor is a perfect cold weather meal.

They change up their menu regularly. I appreciate that and the fact that they aren't afraid to experiment with dishes. One daily special recently was shrimp, grits and pork belly. The spiciness was mild, but had enough heat to enhance the bold flavors and pair nicely with the sweetness of the crispy yet succulent slab of pork. The only drawback was that there wasn't enough grits.

Desserts are strong too. The churros with hot chocolate was as good as expected. The apple cobbler had a doughy quality to it, but with the brown butter ice cream and butterscotch sauce... I still destroyed it. The best dessert I've had at Glutton is one that isn't on the menu.

She was right 4 pickled cherry tomatoes with olive oil drizzled on top of some yummy ricotta cheese with a small side of bread. No seriously you get 3 small wedges of yummy bread on the side of this dip.  I think it's really crappy that we have to pay $2 for an extra side of bread.  Just give the right amount of bread in the first place.  There is too much yummy goodness left over just for the one side of bread even if you were like us and piled it on!

Dean is an awesome bartender! He made us some melon cucumber cocktails that were awesome!!! Then we had to ask our server how much they were, $12 and they are tiny martini style glasses. Seriously for Vegas strip prices they should be on the strip not around the corner from container park hidden. And our server Bryan was really nice and helpful. Not much of a talker but he was busy. He kept checking on us.  And they kept our water glasses filled. 

For our entrees my friend ordered the burger and I ordered the gnocchi. Bryan said the menu is set up to be shared. So I'm thinking ok at these prices you expect us to buy a bunch of items??? Yeah with one app 3 drinks and 2 entrees our bill was $85 before tip. So the gnocchi was ok, the meat was delish but the gnocchi its self was a bit chewy for my taste. The burger was delicious too and it came with fries. They really should state that on the menu. Because spending that much on a burger is beyond my scope. But this one was juicy and good with home made pickles!!! And the fries were awesome! 

There was some girl playing a guitar and singing.  The manager came and introduced himself. All in all if you can afford it come here ask Dean to make you a cocktail and order the pickled tomatoes and burger. Don't forget the extra bread!!!! 

I swear if the service wasn't so good and the food tasting awesome I'd demote you guys a star for charging me for more bread! Seriously 3 pieces isn't even an equal share for two people! Just double it up, please!!!",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,3,2,5,IK9Ni9BDyYYDqzXISJPHCQ

Starting with the positives, the Japanese Corn, the flatbread, and the Peach Cobbler are all 5 star dishes.  Then again, when two appetizers and your dessert are the best things on the menu, that doesn't say much for your entrees.  

I went with a group of six people.  The service was good, but the overall noise level caused by the music (turned up to club level) was obnoxious.  I could barely hear my friend sitting right next to me.  Starting with the drinks, they are average at best.  The bacon drink was interesting at first, but quickly became overwhelming and gross the more you drank it.  As for the mule and the other drinks, they were just okay.  

In terms of the food, I we ordered the brussell spouts, the tuna, hamburgers, and the squid ink pasta.  The brussell spouts looked like cole slaw and wasn't good (Cleo and Radio City Pizza have much better brussell spouts, although I make better ones at home).  The tuna was insipid.  My friend asked me to taste it.  It tasted bland and stale, and lacked any freshness quality to it.  We sent it back.  The hamburger and fries were good.  

As for the squid ink pasta, for $25, you would expect more to the dish than a dollop of frozen crab meat and a handful of pasta.  Seriously, the overall food cost on the dish had to be $4.  As to the ""dungness crab,"" it was clearly frozen or old and had bits of shell in it.  The pasta was bland and too thick.  All in all, the dish is a fail.

Not only is he passionate about the food and can describe it in very real terms anyone could understand, but he also can give an honest opinion about what should be ordered based upon what you like.  Now to the food. 

I think that the food overall was well prepared. The descriptions on the menu look great and are written in a way that you ask questions and definitely want to order so many dishes. But, the food itself when it got to the table was a bit underwhelming, I gave 4 stars because I think most of the food was technically sound but was missing dimension. My fiancé who is not a ""foodie"" just used the terms ""missing something wow."" When I pushed she said the food lacked dimension. Texture was missing on the fried rice dish and the garganneli pasta dish. Maybe some crunchy veg versus cooked or pickled would have made it a better dish. In addition we generally like a dish with some more pop. General population says pop but to be specific it needs a bit more acid. The garganneli pasta should have had some vinegar. Maybe Banyuls or possibly apple cider but some vinegar. The rice dish just needed more pickled veggies and it would have been perfect. 

I was happy with the atmosphere and the food just think they could tighten it up.

The menu, at first, doesn't look like anything really special. But our server Justin was incredibly enthusiastic about the menu and made everything sound delicious. Justin was really the best server we had on our Vegas trip, FWIW. 

We started with the shaved brussel sprouts (awesome), wood roasted shrimp (awesome) and curried Ccauliflower (OK, but not my favorite) for the table. For the main course we tasted the garganelli, glutton fried rice and seafood of the day, which happened to be salmon 3 ways. Everything was delicious.

... And boy did they. I love the look and feel of this place, like a 100-year-old East Coast speakeasy, but with windows? My friends and I sat at the bar right behind the open-air kitchen and began to order food and drinks. First off, the alcohol selection here is great, different styles of whiskey, gin, vodka and tequila. They have a great cocktail list as well, but I went with the 12-year-old Macallan, neat. 

We ate family style and loaded the bar with gorgeous plates of food...

- Pickled Tomatoes, with whipped ricotta, basil and grilled bread. The pickled tomatoes were amazing and the combo of ricotta smeared on grilled bread, killed it. 

- Curried Cauliflower, almond butter, cumin pickled shallots. The Cauliflower had great curry taste, but it was a tad over cooked. 

- Wood Roasted Shrimp with garlic bread, parsley salad, bacon scamp and butter. Perfectly cooked giant pieces of shrimp and bread. More tasty soft delicious carbs!

We also ordered Braised Beef Cheeks and Pan Roasted Salmon. The Beef cheeks were ridiculous, most likely made in some heaven sent out of this world device, because these were so tender and juicy that I had an ""out-of-cheek experience"", an absolute must try when coming to Glutton. The Salmon is most likely made in the same heavenly cooking device, flaky, moist and with that perfect hint of salt and citric acid.

Basically we arrived downtown on a weeknight at 730pm. Parking was easy... We threw money in the meter and headed into the restaurant. 

The hostess greeted us with a smile. We asked her about the menu items and if anything could be made vegan. Yes, I know glutton is next to an all vegan restaurant... But I wasn't overly impressed with vegenation and their recent health grades... Plus We wanted something different:) the hostess asked our server Stacey and she came back with four different menu items that could be prepared vegan. We decided to sit down and give this place a try. 

The decor is very simple... Open ceiling and exposed ventilation systems... It had a very lofty, industrial feel. There was seating around the exposed kitchen which we loved and will probably use next time. Overall it has a great feel to it. 

The service was great. Stacey was extremely knowledgable about the menu and I felt very comfortable asking questions and ordering from her. Our water was never empty... And the table was always clean thanks to the busser.  

The menu is easy to navigate and isn't very large. However, it's eclectic and has something for everyone's taste:)
We ordered our cocktail and wine... Both were delicious. I'm not sure I've ever tried a mule that delicious... And my wine... The best 5$ cab I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the brown butter gnocchi. He said it was good. Listed under the large plates... It was definitely a large plate... With a very small portion. For 16$ I think he expected to be blown away, and he wasn't. I ordered the shaved Brussels sprouts prepared vegan and the cauliflower prepared vegan. Both dishes were listed under small plates... Both were pretty decent portions and priced accordingly. I will say that both dishes were lacking something... However when we combined them together... They complimented each other perfectly. I would definitely go back and order both together, but never separate.

The only speed bump we had after our party of 6 was seated was a longer than expected wait for coffee, but it was worth the wait. The breakfast menu has a lot of interesting specialty items. But instead of focusing on one of the more elaborate breakfast specials, I had to fixate on the yeast pancakes. I make a lot of pancakes, but always baking power and/or buttermilk style, and I've wanted to make yeast pancakes. After having theirs, well, it'll be tough to go back. To accompany these, I ordered sides of bacon and the ultra-gravity exuding ""duck potatoes."" Again, I was satisfied beyond expectation. The bacon was perfect and nicely seasoned. The duck potatoes are similar to the home fries I make, with red and green peppers included, and, well... duck fat! Everyone else was equally satisfied with their meal.  Refills for water, coffee, and tea came promptly and often. We were checked on frequently. The staff are a delight with whom to converse.

While I did not get to have anything here other than breakfast, I had earlier in the week discovered Glutton by doing a search on, of all things, poutine (because the group I was with love poutine). They have something called a mushroom poutine. Very intriguing.

Ironically, we came to Glutton because our first choice, eat., had a 45 minute wait. From our table, we could see people still waiting to be seated while we were enjoying our delicious meal. I hope - nay, expect - that the lines will grow here.",MnYfi2DODiZkLIwJFuwB2g,1,4,5,qc6K98NLTezPXlsScFDkPg
3167494,2015-09-02,3,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"I've had Glutton on my list since before they opened, and was excited to give it a shot when a good friend of ours decided to celebrate his birthday here. We sat down with 15+ people and decided to order almost everything on the menu to share family style, which I highly recommend if you come here with a group. Some of the dishes are a bit smaller, and probably better for smaller groups, but everything is easily shareable.

To get started, there's a few items that I would say are definitely worth ordering...

Mushroom Poutine & Spicy Pork Rinds - Both of these happened to be on a HH menu when we arrived, so we started with them. The mushroom poutine is nice, crispy fries piled high with mushrooms and cheese. Tons of flavor, and good enough that I think our table finished a whole bowl before the entire party arrived. The Spicy Pork Rinds have like a Cheetos type flavor, but on steroids. There's a huge amount of cheddar flavor with a good hint of spiciness from the cayenne, and they are perfectly crunchy.

Shaved Brussel Sprouts - Maybe not exactly fitting to the name of the restaurant, but definitely worth checking out. If you're a fan of brussel sprouts, even in the slightest, you've got to order this. It's bright, fresh, delicious and has more flavor than you'd expect.

Japanese Street Corn - Yes, I'm mentioning this...and I'm really not a fan of corn. It's certainly nothing I would order on my own, but I'm glad someone at the table did. I love that it's cut off the cob, and that the flavors are bold. It's nicely charred with a hint of smokiness, and is probably some of the best corn I've eaten anywhere.

Other stand outs for small plates are the Buffalo Sweet Breads, Curried Cauliflower and the Chicken Live Mousse. There really wasn't anything that we didn't like, and I think we put in more than 1 order for a few of the smaller items.

Once you're done indulging on all the appetizers, here's a few things to try off their ""Large Plates""...

Squid Ink Pasta - I was only able to try a little of this, but wow, it was good. There's a lot of flavor in the pasta, and I liked the addition of crab meat. It didn't have an overpowering seafood taste, and the addition of mint gave it a hint of freshness.

Brown Butter Gnocchi - Although I think the portion size is a little small for the $16 price tag, the flavor is nowhere near small. The braised pork cheek is incredibly tender, and would probably be a hit dish served on it's own. Gnocchi is traditional light, soft and pillowy texture that absorbs all the great flavors from the sauce.

Glutton Burger - Not the best, but easily one of my favorite burgers in town right now. It was a bit on the salty side, which may be intentional, but was otherwise seasoned very well. We ordered it medium rare of course, and it came out just right. One of the most unique things about this burger is the soft, kind of sweet bun they use. This burger is something you can't leave Glutton without trying in my opinion.

Other stand outs from the bigger plates were the Bacon & Fig Flatbread, and the Linguini Putanesca. Much like the smaller, starter plates though...there really wasn't anything that we didn't enjoy. 

Aside from the delicious food, the service was excellent also. Our party was pretty big and we had one main waitress who really handled everything extremely well. She was on top of everything from the get go, and didn't stop checking on us until the minute before we left.

In short, if you haven't been to Glutton yet, you're definitely missing out. As a whole, I think it's a great representation of the way Downtown LV is heading. I loved it, and absolutely can't wait to get back for brunch.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,8,7,4,0fLa8b_ixNYAtyk5qk46hA

Had the cheesy pork rinds (which was the only marginal thing we had) and the eggplant for starters (eggplant was great).  Then moved into the Ahi Tacos  (which were great) and the Calamari Fries (amazing) followed up by the evening special.

While just a tad on the pricey side, it was great to have good 'grownup' food and really enjoyed both the atmosphere and the staff attentiveness (thank you Justin)!

3203602,2016-01-01,6,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"The story is long, the story is old...Rex meets girl, girl meets Rex, Rex likes girl's indoor plumbing, girl likes Rex's musky scent. Rex and girl fall madly in love until her the money ran out.  Rex had a love like this Downtown...but sadly it faded. Rex needed another love...and this love arrived with style, with class, with her own teeth...2 of them.  Rex swooned, Rex caressed, Rex laughed wildly, Rex made sweet love...Rex finally left the house to be with her. Her name was ""Hot Tonsils"" Kramer. Oh, she was peach of a gal...she felt like a rotting peach that sat in the sun too long. Rex's eyes are watering. 

To celebrate our love, Rexy, the king of sexy, arranged a wonderful date.  Sadly the dumpster behind Denny's was filled with two trash bags full of dogs blood and a man who looked like Neil Diamond.  He insisted he was Neil Diamond...but who hasn't done that.   Rex needed to improvise. Rex remembered a place he had seen catty corner to Eat. and next to the Container Park. Rex grabbed Hot Tonsils, quickly carved an out of office message on the back of a sleeping hobo and hustled to Glutton. 

Gluttony was a true revelation. The beautiful couple started with the Ahi Tuna tacos and the calamari fries. the tacos were terrific and beautifully seasoned, but the calamari fries were quite simply incredible. Each and every piece of calamari were incredibly tender and flavorful. Arguably the most tender calamari Rex has ever had. To heighten the experience the chef added crushed peanuts to add the needed crunch and a spicy aioli to add the heat and acid. It was perfectly balanced.

The next course was the ""larger plates"" but they are still meant to be shared.  Hot Tonsils wanted the Butternut Squash Agnolotti, Rexy Poo wanted the Cavatelli & Short Rib dish and we compromised on the Spaghetti Carbonara.  All three had house made pasta and all three pastas were dome brilliantly for each dish.  The Angolotti was soft and delicate, and the puree underneath was delicate but had good flavor. The Carbonara was outstanding, the poached egg ran out and mixed with the cheese to make a great sauce, and the shitake ""bacon"" was inventive and added to the dish tremendously. The real star of the round was the Cavatelli and Short Rib.  The short rib was fall apart tender and the sauce was intense. The strong beef flavor and additional herbs and flavors were beautiful. The cavatelli was dense and stood up well to the softness of the meat and the gravy. 

Lastly, Rex's lady wanted all 3 desserts, and Rex obliged. He saw that look of love in her eyes, and he knew if he ordered those dished, she would use the Hot Tonsils on Rex's most intimate of areas...Rex's ear lobe...oh the lobe of love! The jar of cake was good, but not great. Tasted like soft pudding and cream. Strong chocolate flavor. It was difficult to share and didn't have a needed crunch factor. The dish can be saved, but it needs to be presented differently for sharing. The second best was the apple crisp, and on the right day it could be Rex's favorite. The fruit was soft and flavorful and the crisp was sugary and warm and comforting. The star of the show, the meal and maybe of the entire Las Vegas dessert menu scene is the Caramel Corn Profiteroles. Of all of the desserts Rex has ordered over the years...this was the best hands down. The profiteroles were perfectly soft and light, but had a crispy exterior. The ice cream in the middle tasted like popcorn...seriously. No gimmick. No fancy chef trick. The ice cream tasted like popcorn. Incredible. 

Sadly Rex and Hot Tonsils were forced to part after a particularly randy session ended in two severely burned lobes and an itchy crotch.  Love isn't easy, but getting a great dinner downtown is. Great waitstaff. Amazing food. Just what downtown needed. Glutton should be a great success in an area that really needs it. Bravo.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,3,2,5,JnN3BjkyYJe7xRR3WV42Fg

You have a belly bursting out of a button shirt  and the word glutton, making you believe your going into a hearty meal. But this just wasn't the case. Instead what it was is essentially a tapas restaurant. The food was mediocre at best, but again misleading. The spicy pork rinds were anything but spicy. The flatbread was bland and soggy. The shrimp was chewy and definitely not worth the price of $15 since the serving is just three. The only thing that was very tasty was the Brussels sprouts salad, but again when I think of glutton, a vegetarian salad is not what I would think of.

My boyfriend and I dined here for the first time and so it is my civic duty to let you know exactly what I thought of this yummy little restaurant.

We came around 5pm or 6pm and upon arrival we were both greeted and seated immediately. They have these cool menus that are attached to clipboards; the first page contains their small plates, big plates, desserts, snacks, & special/food of the day while the second page displays a list of the alcoholic beverages they serve. We had two servers, I'm not sure which was our main one but I mainly recall the young lady with the colored hair because she was very helpful and super friendly! She was prepared to answer my question about some of the food on the menu and informed us that they also have brunch menu from 9am-3pm which, in her opinion, had way better food and so she went to retrieve a take home menu for me to look over with their brunch menu and their evening menu. I have to say, I will definitely be coming back to try some of the brunch food because they all just look so good! 

The other server, a brown hair young lady, vaguely comes to mind only because I remember she was nice, but she didn't stand out like the other girl, but she advised us to get big plates and that way my boyfriend and I could share because they come in big portions.... Don't do that. 

I ordered the Brown Butter Gnocchi from the Big Plate section and my boyfriend ordered the Ahi Tuna Flatbread from the small menu. Both were the same price, $16, but the Ahi Tuna Flatbread could have easily been mistaken for an appetizer because, although it did taste good (and a bit on the spicy side!) that is definitely not something that would fill up a grown man! My Brown Butter Gnocchi wasn't exactly a ""big portion"" at all, it was actually the perfect size for me.

Aside from that, I will definitely come back here and I do recommend it to you all. These little places are way better than those other food chains.

The name of the restaurant is Glutton. The word in my mind conjures up images of rich, deep fried foods. Just a bunch of fatty-fat-fat goodness. But actually, the menu is creative, the food is freshly prepared in-house, and they incorporate those foods called vegetables into their dishes.

I lunched here with a friend on a weekday before noon. The restaurant was chill and not busy, especially considering how lunchtime was approaching. The Togarashi chicken sandwich called my name. The sandwich was comprised of fried slices of chicken, miso ailoi, and pickled vegetables -- so freaking delicious! It had a sweet and savory flavor to it that was irresistible. The burger also comes with a side of fries, which is a plus in my book because so many restaurants nowadays serve them separately -- talk about un-American.

The food may be great, but I felt rushed once our server, who was curt whenever she interacted with us, left the check on our table before we even took a bite of our food. The reasoning: she explained the restaurant provides patrons the opportunity to pay quickly if they're on a lunch break.

Looking back, I see that our first warning of what to come was when the non welcoming hostess corrected us when we asked if they served breakfast, ""no, we serve brunch."" From there we were sat at our soon to be table of dismay and frustration as we were overlooked by every single staff member there. At last, the bartender, who for whatever reason became our server came to take our drink order. Of which we each ordered alcoholic beverages that lacked flavor, with a hefty price tag to boot. The waters we ordered no where to be seen. Our server who was never to return, was no help in this matter. So we had to do the unfortunate thing of asking other servers for it... This took over 10 minutes as they forgot all about us even though our table was literally in the center of the room. By the time we received our water we had a good guess that refills would be out of the question. At last we put our meal orders in, by our new server whose blank stare really portrayed how happy she was to be there. I'd like to say this story ends happily, however, when everyone else at my table's food arrived mine was never to appear... As apparently she forgot to order mine and never checked up on us after the busser dropped the food off. If she had she might have noticed (doubtful) that clearly a plate was missing at the table. By this point as my group had begun to scarf their food down I no longer wanted to prolong our time there so when I did finally get her attention I asked her ""to cancel"" my order... If she even knew what it was that I had ordered to begin with. No apologies, but rather looked perturbed that I was bothering her. Our bill, as you can imagine, was not timely and was missing the drinks that we had ordered with our original server. Weird how he suddenly remembered us now that the drinks were missing and came back to our table with the second check and asked ""how was everything?"" Being in the service industry myself and having a degree in hospitality it is quite upsetting to go into a restaurant such as this and have absolutely no type of apologies or even sympathy toward the above circumstances that happened. I let him know of the terrible experience in which he said, ""it couldn't have been THAT bad!"" and took my check and charged us. To be honest, at this point, I was not looking for anything free (because that certainly didn't happen) but rather some sort of courtesy and understanding of just how miserable the experience was.

Glutton offers a menu of ""recreations"". Nothing you've never heard of, but everything features an original twist: not just ""truffle-oil fries"", instead, a heaping bowl of fresh-cut fries smothered in a mushroom/sherry reduction and melted cheese curd.""

Glutton celebrates fattening fair.  Yes, a former whole new parade of comport foods to try, including a brown-butter gnocchi served with slow-cooked pork cheek.  It's just a little on the ridiculous side. I do not want a calorie count on this one.  When I eat this one, I imagine myself sitting on a porch in Sardinia. A masterful gourmet take on farm food.

All of the ingredients a super-fresh, too. The grill is right out and the open. As if the owner is saying, ""Look! We ain't reheating s**t from plastic bags here. Our chefs are cooking from scratch.""

This is a very nice addition to the growing DT business district.  My only sadness comes with the gentrification of the area and the displacement of those who can't afford a $9 bowl of gourmet fries, however savory or delicious they may be. But such is life in the city.  

At any rate, I left Glutton with the taste of braised pork in my mouth and I can't wait to eat here again.",IJL--65w5S4Pj-iSY3njJw,1,0,4,HgAMeqSCUdmWmk9f9__HoA

without filling up too quickly.

I met up with a bunch of super cool peeps for some dudes birthday and we had a glutton fest! I had a few things I wanted to try and immediately upon arrival, the Chicharrones and Mushroom Poutine were already on the table. I got a drink called the Pig Roast which sounded good on paper, but tastewise was not all that. I'm a liver lover...Calf's Liver, Foie Gras, Ankimo, etc. Glutton's Chicken Liver Mousse with Port Jam offers a rich delectable start paired with crisp grilled bread, great flavor and texture for sure.

 The Glutton Burger was another item on my hit list. Ordered medium rare, the cooks not only know their cooking temperatures here, but the seasoning was on point too. As other plates were passed among our table, I also managed to snag a bite of more deliciousness-Buffalo Sweetbreads, Gnocchi, Brussels Sprouts, Cheese Gougeres, Japanese Street Corn, and a forgettable pasta dish with crab. For dessert, we shared the Chocolate-Chocolate Chip Cookie Sandwich with Peanut Butter Ice Cream and Pretzel Dust which was a nice end to our dinner. 

Our waitress was great from start to finish with her team of servers delivering/bussing plates in a timely matter, drinks were filled quickly, and when it came for the bill, checks were split no problem(we had 15-20 people). Overall, great first visit and I can't wait to return for their weekend brunch!  ALOHA!!!

I anxiously took my first bite into my burger and WOWWWWW it was so juicy with incredible flavor!!! Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had.

Don't let the playful name fool you - Glutton has some serious chefs! They serve up totally decadent dishes with gourmet flair. I had the shrimp scampi omelet with crispy potatoes ($18). So good! Also, the zucchini ""muffin"" ($5) comes in a big buttery skillet. Divine. Prices are definitely high for brunch, but they know what weary party people are willing to pay for a carb-filled morning meal.

3952049,2016-11-24,0,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"Glutton is a cute place in Downtown. My husband and I came here for a Sunday night dinner. The place was empty when we came in, so the place was quiet. The service here was phenomenal. Our server did an excellent job explaining the items on the menu. He went into such great detail that it made our mouth water when he described how the Barolo Wine Braise Beef cheek is made! However, the overall meal was okay. 

FOOD: We tried the following: 

Lamb Neck Gravy (whipped feta, almonds, mint and olive bread) - The lamb neck was tender, but the dish had a more vinegary & sour taste to it so only try it if you like this flavor. But when you add it to a piece of bread it balances out pretty well. 

Japanese Street Corn (w/ miso butter and chives): This was the best dish we tried! The miso butter on the corn was so tasty. The corn was perfectly cooked with a hint of burnt corn in it, which was delicious! I would come back here to try this again. 

Barolo Wine Braise Beef Cheek (w/ Yukon potato & horseradish puree, early fall vegetables and shave truffle): The beef cheek was tender, but only one side was tender and the other side was tough and chewy (lame). The potatoes and horseradish puree complimented the meat, but the puree lacked taste. There were bits of truffle on top, which we all can appreciate in any dish! 

Lobster Lasagna special: This special item was the worst thing on the menu and the most expensive. Maybe if we didn't have the lobster lasagna I wouldn' have given the place a 3-star. The lasagna barely had any lobster in it. The sauce was sweet, which I wish the server would've told us it was the dish was on the sweeter side. It didn't taste good at all. 

Apple Fried Pies w/ date & walnut compote, vanilla bean ice cream: I'm a sucker for apple pies. Then, when I heard the pies were fried - I was TOTALLY DOWN! This is was an excellent dessert. The pies were perfectly fried and the inside had fresh apples and caramel oozing out. It tasted amazing with the vanilla bean ice cream. I definitely recommend this dish! 

PRICE: This meal for two people was about $105 w/ tip. I think every item was reasonably priced since it's made from fresh ingredients that is locally grown. However, that Lobster Lasagna was too expensive for the lack of lobster and it did not taste good. 

SERVICE: Service was amazing. I really enjoyed the staff there. They took the time to tell us about the restaurant concept, their favorite dishes and even described the way the menu items is made. I really appreciate how our server was also funny and attentive to our needs. 

Overall, I give this place a 3-star for food, 5-star for service and 4-star for the price, so a 4-star for the entire experience. I recommend the Japanese street corn and fried apple pies.

Downtown has grown a ton (in coolness/gentrification) in the last couple years. We went to eat soon after it opened, and it felt like it was an outpost of hipster in the middle of rundown weekly motels. But now...glutton, vegenation, poboys on one corner, John E Carson hotel on another corner, eat on the 3rd corner, and the container park on the 4th! Just waiting for a whole foods to move in down the street!
Anyway, Glutton fits in perfectly with the vibe of those other joints, and has really good food and drink to boot.
The inside is semi-industrial, with lots of windows to look out on an empty lot (haha - growth for the future! And there's lots of pedestrians these days, too!!).
We started off with drinks after our friendly server informed us it was happy hour: 4:30-6:30 (not sure the days - it's definitely on on Wednesdays), 2 for 1 beers, wines, or well drinks. Yay! Glutton has a pretty cool, though not extensive, beer list. Probably about 15 selections, including some in big bottles. Wine list looked pretty good, too. But the cocktails! We sampled the 'merica and the whiskey one (shoot, I forgot the name). Both were really good - love me some gourmet cocktails.
For food we had:
Japanese Street Corn - my favorite dish of the evening. Served with furikake and butter, I think. So good.
Brussels Sprouts Salad - with fennel. loved this one, too. It was more salad-y than Brussels sprout-y, and was a good complement to the other dishes.
Cauliflower - very curry, but I surprisingly loved them. Even my 2 year old loved them!
The steak - served with a little bit of creamy delicious mashed potatoes and some avocado/jalapeno topping. I am not a big fan of avocado, but I loved this little salsa. It added a creamy-spicy-sweetness to the meat. Very good.
Woodfired shrimp - Good shrimp, but kinda standard.
Half chicken - I did not try it, but my dining companion stated it was excellent.
Wish we would have tried the pickled tomatoes!

For 5 adults, 2 kids, with drinks - $150. I think that's pretty reasonable.

Added points for having a woman in playing guitar and singing on a Wednesday!

The only problem is, there are so many great places downtown, that I'm not sure when I'll be back!",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,3,2,5,zaYz3rAYn2SLu8iGAIm5Ig
4051899,2015-06-11,7,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"Boozy Brunch? Count me in. Glutton is an excellent choice for weekend cocktails and grub. Located in a beautiful space on the corner of Carson and 6th, which appears to have become a hotspot for eating downtown, I was surprised there weren't more people taking advantage of the recently launched weekend brunch promotion. 

Dyanna and I ate at Glutton on a Saturday morning. For part of our visit, we were the only customers there. I could see a group of people waiting to be seated at another eatery across the street and almost felt sorry for them, clearly they had no idea what they were missing at Glutton. 

The service we received was excellent, as one would expect from an almost-empty restaurant. I started off with the Morningshade, a chilled coffee drink with tequila, cinnamon, vanilla and orange ... Very reminiscent of a Mexican coffee, I couldn't taste any tequila at all in this easy to drink concoction. 

I love a good waffle, so I was unable to pass up the special for the day, a Peaches and Cream waffle. Perfectly cooked and topped with delicately sliced, delicious peaches, a mound of whipped cream and a very generous drizzling of bourbon syrup.  

I don't go downtown often, but the delicious weekend brunch offered up at Glutton is going to be hard for me to stay away from.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,11,10,4,xj_PIR8Hi6ha0KzRCM8GgA

Came in for Sunday brunch and left incredibly disappointed. First off the hostess could use a hug, because she was certainly less than pleasant. Smile, chick it won't hurt I promise. The waiter on the other hand did greet with a smile and was easy to interact with and was really the only reason why I stayed after initial glance at the menu as I thought of going next door to vegenation. $14 for a chicken salad sandwich and fries? And certainly nothing stands out in that salad, as it was tasteless. $11 for an egg white frittata that wasn't bad but was a bit on the small side for the price. And that gigantic $5 cinnamon roll, you can pass on that if you were wondering. Seemed almost day old with the putter layer being hard (almost stale like). Obviously if I left 80% of it still on the plate, something is wrong with it. After tip...$39/ brunch drinking waters and the meal was uneventful to my taste buds. To top it off, the temperature control should be turned down a bit. I was uncomfortably sweating while eating.

The two of us ordered 1 diet soda, 1 specialty cocktail, an order of pork rinds, an order of wood fired shrimp, an order of cauliflower and the shaved brussels sprouts salad. Our bill was close to $70 with tax and tip! That is too expensive no matter how you slice it. The portion sizes are very small too (the shrimp dish had THREE shrimp for $15.00!!), so small that we ended up having to hit Fatburger because we got hungry again a few hours later. 

The food was just okay. The brussels sprouts salad was the standout. It was pretty amazing and would be the only reason I would consider returning to Glutton. The shrimp was good but not worth $15. The cauliflower tasted like something I could get at any restaurant anywhere, and the pork rinds were so gross that we ate a couple and stopped. The ""Pig Roast"" specialty cocktail was one of the most disgusting things I have ever put in my mouth.

The atmosphere is hipster and sparse, and I really enjoyed the truly open kitchen. The service was really sloppy. First, the entire concept of the menu was utterly confusing. Was it family style? Small plates? What was flatbread and what wasn't? Our server was less than helpful. Nothing on the menu was printed to give any sort of guidance. It was annoying and slightly obnoxious. 

There's also an item on the small menu where you can pay $5 to ""buy a round"" for the kitchen staff. Are you freaking kidding me? This seems like such a desperate attempt to be cool and different that it annoyed the mess out of me!

Our server wasn't the most pleasant person either, and she constantly forgot to bring drink refills, silverware, etc. She offered zero advice even when asked. I also thought a lot of the staff looked sloppy. 

I'm not a professional food critic but I love to eat and love experimenting with new flavors and dishes. Unfortunately, Glutton failed on pretty much every level.

My friend and I shared:
-Calamari Fries ($15) - Delicious, the calamari kind of looked like chicken tenders.  The calamari was served with sriracha mayo, eel sauce, and peanuts on top.  This is considered a small plate, but honestly you can eat this as your meal and be satisfied. 
-Glutton Burger ($14) - Your classic burger but done right.  Served with pickles, onions, American cheese and buttery toasty buns, probably one of the better burgers I've had.  Served with a side of fries sprinkled with rosemary on top.

The best part by far was the poutine, but be warned it is so rich- two people could share it and be full. 

Second time around we came for lunch, and had the Japanese street corn and charcuterie sandwich.  The street corn was so buttery and good.  Pretty sure you could order that for an entrée and not be hungry for awhile.

Anyway, one evening a bunch of friends and I were on the Easteide of town and wanted to come to the DTLV. None of us had ever been to Glutton but we'd all heard good things. We decided to give it a chance. We started out with their pork rinds. They were fine, like very light, airy chicharrones but not incredibly flavorful. I chose a cocktail with gin and Aquavit in it, it was very strong and not really my taste although it was my first time trying Aquavit. A couple of us ordered that night's special, the cioppino. The cioppino was so, so good! It had nice and rich flavor and was hearty and light at the same time and perfect. 

I have since returned and had their burger with wine for dinner, and that is literally a slice of heaven. Their burgers are so frickin' good I can't even... Seriously, the beef is wonderful quality, they cook it to perfection, I mean, juices everywhere. It's glorious. Pair it with an inexpensive red and you are all set. Seriously, I should head over there now.

Thank you Jade for your most attentive service, we look forward to coming back. Keep up the great job Chef!

Food:
Shaved Brussel Sprouts-fresh, crunchy with right amount of tahini dressing and nutty bits of Parmesan. I would probably take a Beano beforehand because raw Brussel sprouts :)

Pickled Tomatoes - whipped ricotta made by little cherubs. The bright cool tomatoes pop in your mouth and compliments the creamy ricotta. This tastes like the definition of farm to table.

Curried Cauliflower - again the attention to detail with the curry sauce on cauliflower with almond butter & pickled shallots. Would love to have this served with garlic naan bread.

Singaporean Chili Crab - King crab legs with a slightly spicy, tangy tomato sauce accented by strands of chili threads served with toast. It's easy to eat and savor every delicious bite. I've been lusting after SCC ever since seeing it on Unique Eats. Chef said they may even add it to their regular menu items.

Ahi Tuna Tacos - fresh, crisp, light yuzu guacamole and just really good.

Raviolo - perfect single ravioli with oozy egg yolk in the middle that mixes with the brown butter to give you a more decadent sauce.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,41,35,5,TdYw4SAp3zGcj6m2CdEaug

The inside has the same vibe a lot of restaurants in DTLV have currently. Concrete floors, open ceilings, a bar, snazzy little plates, and hardware, etc. All the stuff you would expect from a trendy Downtown place. Luckily the place has better acoustics than Carson Kitchen, because while my friend and I were there during a lunch rush we could actually have a conversation with each other without yelling.

As for the food, I ordered the Linguini Putanessca, which was FABulous. The spaghetti itself was so amazingly fresh. The sauce was also rich, with a nice tang from the capers. The crispy porchetta rinds add a much needed *different* layer to the pasta.

Unfortunately, I was still hungry after I left. The portion was small -- even for lunch. I wish they would add just a bit more spaghetti to the dish, and it would also be nice of them to serve the pasta with a crusty garlic bread of some type as well. 

Service was abrupt and kind of cold. Not sure if our server was having a bad day or what, but she was not very congenial and brought out our bill pretty hastily.

We split the Grape Salad and the Garganelli Pasta ($45 with a glass of wine and an iced tea). The pasta was great. You could really tell that the ingredients were super fresh, even the house made pasta! The salad was OK, too, but I was hugely disappointed because the description said it came with a maple vinaigrette which I was excited about...but I couldn't taste anything over the edible flowers which I hate and which were not in the description.  Honestly, the salad was my only complaint.

We had planned on stopping back in before they closed to try their fried rice, but they had closed early because they were slow. Maybe call 1st if you're planning on stopping by later.

Back for the second time at Glutton to try the Boozy Brunch, and wanted to speak my mind. I really was not happy with my food this time, so I was prepared to lower my rating. 

The service was great, don't get me wrong.  Kayla was on top of filling my water with a warm, friendly smile.  I liked our waiter Justin, he was friendly and attentive. However, I was not happy with his suggestion of the breakfast sandwich 3/5. 
The duck fat potatoes 2/5 were dry to me. I expected them to be more rich and flavorful  than normal, but I was very disappointed. The bread was amazing on my sandwich, but I did not enjoy the sausage patty. It had too much herbs, and felt like I was eating a veggie burger where they were trying to hide the taste of the meat instead of enhance it. I halved it with my friend, and she complained about the exact same thing. It just wasn't good. I should have gotten the chicken salad sandwich, like my first instinct. 
We got the ricotta spread 5/5, and again, it did not disappoint. This is probably one of my favs on the menu. 

Ok...so just when I had made up my mind to downgrade this place to a 3...Dean - saved the day! He was the bartender. We just happen to be sitting right next to the bar. He kinda mosied over and started to speak casually to our table. I guiltily admitted I overheard him creating a new drink and sharing it with the staff.  I asked him about the liquor he put in it. He immediately brought the bottle over and showed us. He started explaining about this aloe Vera liquor. He brought along a shot glass and gave us a taste. He then shared so much knowledge with this liquor and many others. He was so impressive with the amount he knew about his alcohol. He even let us taste his new sage drink. I will not share the name, to keep the haters from stealing it, as it was very clever.  The drink was also delicious!

Then at his suggestion, we decided to try the watermelon salad 5/5, as I was still hungry since I didn't eat my food. It was amazing!!  It was so light and refreshing. Now this is 5 star food!!!

Management, wherever you stole Dean from, keep him!!  He was so friendly, and so knowledgeable, I want to come back just to have more drinks by him. I was so prepared to lower my review until he came over and made my whole brunch better. 

When you come, be sure to ask for him, ask his suggestion for a drink, and tell him I told you so. Pick his brain...you will be amazed too!!!!

I'll be back!!! :D",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,2,4,a2pV1j13VxHVNyl57bZDZA

Our waitress was awesome and could even tell which was the diet vs the regular coke just by looking at it ;)  Call me easily impressed but we both got a kick out of that.

We also tried the chicken salad sandwich. This dish had a good flavor. The bread was nicely toasted and the chicken salad was fresh and tasty. Although, both dishes were good, there are no items that I would remember. Overall, the restaurant has a very nice atmosphere and good service.

The staff is always friendly and welcoming. I always find myself chatting with the chefs.

4893847,2015-08-25,8,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"3-1/2 stars. This review is for dinner items. The extra 1/2 star is for the service. The name of the restaurant itself made me want to try it - who doesn't want a gluttonous experience right??? Glutton has a somewhat quiet, romantic atmosphere and nice modern decor. It's conveniently located on the corner of Carson and 7th, (a block from Container Park). Came in around 8pm and was seated right away. 

Here's what we ordered: 

- Shaved Brussel Sprouts
- Bacon & Fig Flatbread
- Squid Ink Pasta
- Brown Butter Gnocchi

First of all, the Shaved Brussel Sprouts - I liked it! It was like eating a small crunchy salad that had the texture of raw cabbage. You could really taste the parmesan and tahini vinaigrette. I would definitely get this again.

Next, we had the Bacon & Fig Flatbread - it was a little too sweet and on the plain side for my taste. Wasn't salty enough. More blue cheese probably would have made this pop. I was looking for a contrast of texture and flavor, but didn't really get it. Kind of reminded me of a mini pizza with no cheese and no toppings.

Squid Ink Pasta - I was expecting to get the pleasant saltiness of the squid ink, but didn't get it. Also, the pasta was a little too al dente for my taste. Very forgettable. I've been searching a long time for the perfect squid ink pasta, but unfortunately, this isn't it. I guess I'll have to keep looking. 

Brown Butter Gnocchi - the braised pork cheeks were tasty! The gnocchi itself, however, didn't do anything for me. No emotional spikes here.

Lastly, service - service was excellent. Server made sure our drinks were full, always smiled and checked on us frequently. 

I will come back to Glutton to try their weekend brunch as well as their desserts. Hopefully, that will be a better experience.",4Zqh0-Db39qpGEHCIll9hw,9,9,3,rP1MRxI6T3FrebVfrFTDqg

I started with rose and I really enjoyed it. It was the first rose that wasn't too fruity which was I was in the mood for so I was happily surprised.

We then ordered three small and one regular menu item to split. We had the spinach and artichoke dip, the shrimp, and calamari for the small plates. We then had the pasta dish with pesto as the large plate. We may have over ordered but everything sounded so good! My favorite was probably between the pasta or the dip although I did like it all. 

We didn't get dessert because we were too full.  

The menu items do change seasonally so I would like to see how the menu changes the next time and visit again.

Aside from that, the other items we ordered were okay.

This place has really cute decor and is a simple open space. Our waiter justin was very friendly, informative and enthusiastic. He works damn hard for his money. The menu is small but you feel like there's so many options because you want to try everything. We went with his recommendation and got the special of the day, which was the frisée French salad with pork belly, and the burger. Food came out relatively quickly. The salad was actually a big portion and such a good deal for ten bucks. There was a poached egg that comes with it. You break the yolk and mix it in with the salad. It was heavenly. Loved the crisp greens the dressing and the crispy pork belly. This pork belly was not at all fatty. It was like pork chop meat 

The burger was good as well too. Very juicy and cheesy. We ordered it medium but it came out a little more on the rare side. It was ok for us but if you don't like pink meet you might have sent it back. Burger came with fries in the side. The burger was solid but I didn't think it was as special as the salad.

Glutton was pretty okay! We went for brunch on a sunday. We got a bloody mary, a benedict, and a scramble. We also got these tuna tacos.The bloody mary was okay, very overpriced because you're essentially paying for the tiger shrimp inside it. The waiter was really sarcastic and unhelpful. He was trying to be a cool downtown hipster by pranking us saying that glutton was a vegan restaurant as soon as we ordered something with animal products like shuuuutuppppp.

The food was VERY basic overpriced hipster food which was disappointing because I was hoping this place would be different from the rest of the restaurants downtown. Our bill came out to a whopping 86$ which is insane. The food was okay, but the tuna tacos were horrible. They were deep fried chip tacos with baby pieces of ahi or whatever.. we couldn't even finish them lol.

Ordered the ricotta tomato side dish tasted good but a very small portion. Loved the pork rinds but ask them to place the cheese sprinkle on the side unless you like the flavor of Doritos.

Finally the Best part was the peach cobbler to die for incredible. For 3 of us it was $110 with no alcohol. Left not terribly impressed. The name Glutton gives the impression of good comfort food. More like a tapas place where many orders required

Unfortunately, Glutton, an American urban bistro, doesn't quite live up to its excess implying name but what it does deliver is good.

Part of the DTLV revitalization, the eatery has a contemporary feel with a real life, off Strip vibe flowing through it.  A breath of fresh air.

Brunch (served Saturday and Sunday only) showcases stepped up versions of American classics.  A stack of yeast risen pancakes griddled in butter with a side of maple cider syrup, rich and indulgent.  Fluffy with pronounced chew.  The Benedict, swaps out the Canadian bacon with a flavorful, braised then pulled pork topped with a chipotle hollandaise with enough kick to keep the dish interesting, better than most.  Finally a refreshing watermelon salad, bites made sweeter by the inclusion of acidic tomato and zesty vinaigrette and a sprinkle of ricotta crumble.  Cucumber and toasted hazelnuts add texture.  A welcome palate cleanser

Dinner offerings are mainstream urban bistro done better than most.  Brussels sprouts are hot, this one done with shaved Brussels sprouts with their inherent bitterness accented by shaved fennel bulb and fronds, and kale tossed in a vinaigrette.  Exudes freshness.  Pickled tomatoes sit atop a airy whipped ricotta.  Add olive oil and basil, spread on some grilled bread and create the ""bruchetta"".  The creamy goodness suddenly interrupted by the pop of tart, tomato goodness.  

Other notable though slightly flawed dishes include a curried cauliflower (tasty but slightly overcooked) and the  calamari fries (tender but kabayaki sauce makes the dish too sweet).

Good service with personality.  Well chosen list of libations.  Reasonable markup.

All told, a great addition to DTLV and a solid spot for some snacking when on the downtown pub crawl.

I've been here a couple of times now and I've always gotten great food, drinks and awesome service. 

Yesterday, we tried the Benedict and the chicken fried ribeye. 

The Benedict - very, very good. It has a good spice with a kick to it that makes it a tad different than everywhere else. Also, the potatoes they serve are insanely good 

Chicken fried ribeye - it was okay. It was very salty, so much that I had to scrap a lot of the breading off. It wasn't bad, just not my favorite. 

Also, their drinks here are really good. We had mimosas.

-Beet Salad: the plating was very artistic and the flavor profile was quite tasty
-Calamari fries: nice and tender
-Curried Cauliflower
-Cavatelli & Short Rib: cooked perfectly, so yummy
-Garganelli: the smoked flavor on the chicken is a beautiful touch
-Glutton Fried Rice: the rib-eye was tender, the kimchi friend rice was also delicious 
-Striped Bass: Flaky fish
-Caramel Corn Profiteroles: the popcorn ice cream though!
-Chocolate Bread Pudding: perfect ending to a great meal

5169966,2015-10-16,0,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"Visited Glutton with my mom on Sunday. We originally wanted to go to EAT but it had a huge line and we thought - why not test out this place? The person sitting near the window was eating a super delicious looking burger that seemed to have caramelized onions so we were like yes - this place!

The meal started on a weird note. The busser said he was ""meticulous"" in cleaning his tables as he filled our water glasses, even though the glasses stuck to the tables which was disconcerting.

The brunch menu was heavy on alcohol and light on food - I think there were only about 10 - 15 menu items. No worries because everything was a little unexpected from the typical brunch menu - but there was a ""breakfast plate"" for the boring people of the world as well. 

My mom got a wild mushroom omelette with goat cheese (and I think a bit of truffle oil). It was rich and super delicious - and came with awesome duck fat fried potatoes. 

I got the zucchini parmesan sandwich - crazy good. The chunky tomato sauce on the bread was sweet and super awesome. I knew it had to be on the menu for a good reason - and definitely loved my choice. I barely ate the french fries - but they were very good as well. 

We both had coffee - really good. You can tell it's a hipster spot because they only have ""Sugar in the Raw."" :)

5211849,2015-10-03,1,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"I'm always looking to try new eateries in Las Vegas that don't involve the same tired buffet or diner. I was noticing some new places open up off the beaten path downtown and Glutton looked like a new place to try. We walked by and the hostess saw us looking in the window and walked outside to give us a menu. She was very helpful and you can tell she genuinely enjoyed being there and loved to answer questions so on her attitude alone, we went inside for dinner. We were really hungry, but our awesome waitress told us that the best thing to do is order a few things and split them, so that's what we did. We were really hungry so we decided to order a lot of things to try. Even though the place had a few people dining, the food came out FAST...very cool.

For starters, we ordered the shaved brussel sprout salad and the watermelon salad. I've had watermelon and feta salads before and loved them so this sounded like a good bet. The portion wasn't huge but a good size, especially for one person. It had red and yellow watermelon and the sauce/cheese combination was fantastic. It was better than I was expecting. The brussel sprout salad though was even better. It was sort of the consistency of shredded cabbage but not as tough and a LOT more flavorful. We couldn't eat that salad fast enough. A+ on that.

For our entrees, we got the Brown Butter Gnocchi and the Glutton Burger. The gnocchi were perfectly cooked and the pork cheeks that went with the dish just melted in your mouth. the sauce this all was bathing in was nectar of the gods. Absolutely delicious. Then came the burger...and this was no ordinary burger..it was the best I've ever had and that says a lot considering Vegas has a specialty burger place in every casino now and I've eaten at many of them.

No, this piece of heaven on a fresh bun (from a local bakery) wasn't just a dressed-up bunch of ground beef...no way. The meat is a combination of brisket and short ribs...yeah, it's that amazing. There was just enough mayo on the burger to give it some zest and to top it all off, freshly made homemade pickles and fresh cheese made right in the restaurant. I'm drooling on my keyboard just thinking about it. Seriously, you haven't had a hamburger until you've had one at Glutton.

To wash it all down we had a few adult beverages from their very hipster-esque alcohol selection and how could we not be gluttons if we didn't have dessert. We opted for the Maple and Marscarpone Cheesecake. It was like eating a cloud of cheesecake goodness. 

An absolute epicurean delight and the entire experience eating here was an absolute treat. We will certainly be back and look forward to bringing others in the future as well to one of our newly found favorite places in Las Vegas!",W3fshc9xGnrYuA1QwF4sLw,1,1,5,WTChkpFou8I8ES6qYL-8vQ
5216971,2016-03-02,0,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"4 stars because the service was excellent. As a member of the service industry I value good customer service, even though the food wasn't phenomenal I'll be back just for the pleasant and comfortable environment.

-I got the pickled tomatoes as an appetizer. Those were delicious! Of course you must be a fan of tart and heaps of melt in your mouth ricotta. For $9 it was very tasty and unique & came with nicely grilled bread to spread (I've seen similar appetizers elsewhere that charge $12-16 so it was a fair price I thought)

-the cheeseburger...or maybe it didn't even have cheese? It tasted identical to fatburger. I was a manager at fatburger for sometime so I definitely am not making that one up. Nothing bad about it because fatburger is awesome but not the quality or taste you expect for $11 at a sit down restaurant that recommends it as one of their most popular menu items.
(The fries were even more sub par, not bad for shoestring. Maybe I'm just picky but I swear I've been to local bars and shifty fast food joints that had better fries)

-the last entree was the short ribs with a pasta side. I don't remember exactly what it was called but with the limited menu you can't miss it. $23 and topped in at one of their most expensive menu items. The short ribs were yummy! That's undeniable. Considering they describe how long they are cooked for I would hope for yummy. The noodles were bland and very very rubbery. The best part was the sauce that gets thicker as you eat by mixing in another glob of what I assume is a ricotta of some form. I wasn't fully disappointed in this plate as overall the flavors were great and watching it made from scratch in front of me showed regardless of my opinion it's being made well and right, but for $23 it just left a sour taste in my mouth.

After an overall $50 check for two it was not the worst night out but also not the most satisfying. I did not feel any glutton, instead I still felt hungry. 

But again...the service was so excellent and our waitress was the sweetest. I'll be back for a beer and maybe once again try a different entree. 
It's downtown....so you can't expect cheap eats but there are definitely places that don't leave you feeling empty after spending half a bill.",MuSLgPpgYoONb_h5roCcqQ,0,0,4,qmNXOULnEEXdJAZQYgnndw

5278806,2015-10-14,7,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"More than a little impressed by brunch at Glutton shortly after the Saturday-Sunday menu was launched, it was with four friends that dinner was planned in the small dining room off Carson Avenue this past Friday, Chefs Bradley Manchester and Joseph Kudrak given carte blanche to serve as they like with the exception of a few requests.

Admittedly a bit of a misnomer in terms of name and signage, the small-plates portions and delicacy of the food not really prone to bursting belts or making one feel too-full-to-walk, Glutton represents the vision of a Chef who turned away from the confines of Casino kitchens in order to follow his heart and with a menu riffing on comfort food classics reinvented with interesting ingredients it was in seventeen plates that appetites were invested, all but one succeeding in its premise while several were amongst the very best in class.

Small in space and high in style, the wood tables atop cement floors and open kitchen beneath exposed ceilings following a path traveled by many hip spots in cities across the United States, the pride of Glutton is found in a wood burning oven used in many of the restaurant's preparations, and updating the menu far more quickly than many of its East-of-Strip brethren it was in the now familiar pig-skins that the evening got started, only one item to follow a repeat from just a few months prior while some were just introduced that night.

Playing to my ears in terms of soundtrack while sending out plates in rounds that never once led to the table being overwhelmed, it was on the heels of a hearty caponata that the evening's first ""wow"" moment occured, the delicate taste of creamed salt cod packed into wonton wrappers absolutely delicious with just a kiss of sweetness while the follow-up flatbread was unfortunately less balanced, the raddichio a bit too bitter when paired to the crust's blister as both pork and pesto were mostly lost in the mix.

Quickly regaining traction with two salads that showed not only the quality of Glutton's produce, but also the skill of Manchester and team for reinvigorating tired trends, suffice it to say that beets amidst goat cheese and pistachios were every bit as boldly flavored as they were beautiful while the shaved sprouts and 'superfood' found new depths of flavor when tinged with dill and the unexpected aromatics of toasted sesame seeds.

Progressing on a trajectory of flavors that grew bolder by rounds the two items presented next comprised the last of the menu's small-plates, and although the flank steak beneath mushrooms and blue cheese was almost too rich to be enjoyed past more than a few bites it was a sidedish of corn that had the whole table swooning, each roasted kernel glistening with butter while the Japanese accents contributed volumes of umami and just the slightest hint of spice.

A bit saddened to see the brown butter gnocchi finally removed from the menu despite being a hit from day one, it was at the gratuity of Chef Manchester that the dish made one last appearance alongside two new pastas for round five, and although both the springy Cavatelli and Butternut Squash pockets grounded in celery root were absolutely flawless they still could not match the complex flavors of tender potato dumplings tinged in soy beneath supple pork cheek, pine nuts, and sage.

Taking a well calculated risk with poultry in a final pair of savories, suffice it to say that Manchester and Kudrak are not afraid to use one the bold flavors of swine to augment something less rich and although some may say ""why bother?"" using turkey to craft meatballs if they are only to be blended with guanciale the results were, in fact, outstanding amidst a bowl of creamy polenta, the pepper stuffed roulade no less enthralling with smoky notes finding their foil in a sauce of sweet bourbon.

Again a bit sad to see the rice pudding arancini axed from the menu it was with a 'one of each' finale of desserts that the meal would end and although the newly launched brunch-only caramel apple fritters could have benefited from a bit higher center-to-surface-area to circumvent some oiliness both the cheesecake and churros were reference standard in their execution, the signature profiteroles with flavors of Cracker Jack still undoubtedly Sin City's very best.

**** Willing to take chances while other restaurants seem content to sit back and rely on celebrity marketing or familiarity to push their brand anyone interested in food would be well served to stop by Glutton in order to see what Manchester and his team are doing, the results not quite perfect yet perhaps all the better for it from a kitchen that shows no signs of stopping...or even slowing down to take a breath.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,6,4,uimfqVe4oFwmsh8x1J1uYw

The waiter was off-putting and seemed annoyed that we didn't want to follow the family style rules. 

We asked if we could split the check in any way and they said they could only take up to four equal payments and couldn't split the check by specific groups of 3 or 4 people. So a friend and I who didn't get drinks ended up paying for everyone else's drinks. And then when we got the check there were seat numbers on it with the specific meals that we ordered, so obviously he could have split up the check at least into smaller groups. Anyone who has worked at a restaurant knows splitting checks is annoying, but they were not accommodating at all. 

As far as the food, it was very average and overpriced. Some of the menu items were very small (the gnocchi) and others were very large (the burger) and the menu didn't distinguish between plate sizes- they were all on the same side of the menu.

Before I get to the food lets talk drinks...
We ordered :

Arnold Palmer w/ Malibu - delicious !
Glutton Mary - the Kim Chee addition to a classic drink makes you want to keep coming back for more.
Summer Peaches - delicious and not too sweet either.

Ok here's the 4-1-1 on the glutton goods:
Steak & eggs - kalbi marination adds a crisp tangy flavor to the medium rare steak. The kimchee rice is something that makes my mouth water just thinking of it.

Benedict - delicious and fulfilling . Definitely something you can share . The braised pork melts in your mouth.

Proper breakfast sandwich- mouth watering perfection.  The potatoes are made with duck fat !! So good! 

For dessert we ordered peaches & cream Belgium waffle. Vanilla bean whip with cider maple syrup. Deathly delicious . Talk about a deadly sin 

Oh and to top it off all food is made in house.

I rarely get this excited over an establishment or their food.  During my Vegas birthday frenzy a few weeks ago, I bookmarked this place due to all the great reviews.  I found myself nearby on Freemont Street for the Bike Fest and had some hangry-pains.  I almost wandered into EAT across the street by accident (due to too many Bloody Marys) but quickly corrected myself and grabbed a corner table at Glutton.  Brunch was on my mind - coffee, an egg sandwich perhaps, and another bloody mary please.  My husband and I really wanted to grab some food and be on our way.  Luckily they had a ""proper egg sandwich"" on the menu which turned into a sublime, religious experience.  The bloody mary arrived first - fabulous - with a nice, succulent shrimp perched on the spiced rim along with his pickled veggie buddies.  The coffee was rich and bold - just the way I like it.  The service was fast and friendly.  The sandwich arrives with a side of potatoes cooked in duck fat - um YASSS.  The sandwich looks pretty normal at first glance.  When you sink your teeth into the soft briocche bread, then the house-made sausage, then the cage free egg, then the cheese and aioli - it brought a tear to my eye.  You'd think an egg sandwich is relatively easy to make - slap an egg on some bread with some cheese and call it a day.  Nope, not here.  My hubs gets up and asks for the chef.  He literally walked up to him and shook his hand - it was THAT FREAKING GOOD.  I don't care what else they have on the menu.  I will fly to Las Vegas again just to have this sandwich in my mouth one more time.  The chef thought we were nuts, and clearly we are, but I couldn't leave without extending my appreciation and taking a snapshot with the first dude ever to perfect a breakfast sandwich.  My husband said, and I quote, ""If I go to the electric chair, this will be my last meal.""  Yep, that good.",4HAk6ZipKCuTLdMlX7ezjw,1,4,5,3nNPilXC9IBjdYCJGESsgw

Yes, I showed up with half my face numb, but no way I'd miss my brother from another mother's celebration because everyone knows I love birthdays.  I didn't think I'd get to eat anything that night, but, luckily, the novocaine started to wear off, I got enough feeling back that I didn't bite my tongue off, and I could sample many of the dishes that we shared, family-style. 

Highlights for me, although we must have had almost every dish on the dinner menu since were rolling at least 16 people deep:

-Bacon & Fig Flatbread:  really liked the sweet and salty combo
-Mushroom Poutine: a bowl of these French fries with cheddar curds was sat right in front of me the whole evening.  I ate most of them because they were great and also because everyone else was ignoring them--more for me.
-Japanese Street Corn:  I could have eaten the whole bowl of this corn with miso butter, furikake, and chives, served off the cob, not on it  It was my favorite dish of the evening, but...
-Brown Butter Gnocchi:  Maybe this was actually my favorite dish, or it's a tie with the corn.  The braised pork cheeks were so tender and I'm a gnocchi fan already--loved it.

We had excellent service the whole time, especially for such a large group. Chef Bradley came to the table later in the evening and greeted us, too.
I enjoyed my first visit here and thankfully I didn't miss out on eating. This is definitely the type of place to come with friends so that you can share many dishes like we did. Looking forward to being gluttonous at Glutton brunch next.

5653540,2016-12-03,1,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"Glutton - ""The act of habit of eating of drinking too much""....Love the title of this restaurant. I just like saying the word and experiencing the act!

On a beautiful, sunny day last week my co-worker and I were looking for a new place to try out  for lunch and I had this place bookmarked so we decided to check it out. 

We were warmly greeted by Dean the bartender and quickly sat by the friendly hostess/server. I perused the menu and I loved the unique twists offered in the dishes. This restaurant is a nice size but there did not seem to be a huge lunch crowd dining here. I know there are so many options downtown now, but I love this corner location. Nice big windows to sit by and watch the interesting foot traffic walk by. The decor is industrious and not fancy but the place gives off a warm, welcoming feel.

We decided to start with the Charred Broccoli. The presentation of this small plate was pleasing and upon my first bite, it was tasty. Then after a couple more bites, I wasn't sure I liked it as much. I am not so sure the butternut hummus went well with the dish. Overall, I would give it a 4/10. Next came the main courses. I ordered the Chilaquiles which featured smoked chicken, fried eggs, queso fresco, wood oven roasted tomato sauce and avocado.  My friend ordered the Zucchini Parmesan Sandwich. I was a little confused when my dish arrived and there was no avocado. I am a huge avocado fan, and I was like, ok where is the AVO??? I asked the server and she ran back to the kitchen and brought me a plate with four slices. I loaded it on my dish and to my utter disappointment, the avocado was not ripe and hard as a rock. I ate it mind you but it provided no good flavor to the dish. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with my choice. The dish came out warm and I prefer my food hot. I did eat most of it but kinda bummed! My friend liked her sandwich but stated that she would have preferred the zucchini to be grilled versus fried. 

Thankfully Dean came over and talked to us about the badass cocktails he makes and invited us to come in and try some. He guaranteed that we would be happy with his service and his drinks! Nothing wrong with the service but just a wrong choice perhaps on my part. I decided I will try this place one more time and hopefully my review will increase to 4-5 stars!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,4,2,3,vO6pb5Ir61B51XCHJbJE6Q
5672840,2015-11-30,0,VD0zZKG_ZEz_VYlKLtu9Zg,"This place will get a 4 because the food was overall good, but I did have some qualms with it after leaving. No lattes which I find is a must on most brunch menus and also I didn't think the service was very good. We ordered the Egg White Frittata and the Straight Up Breakfast Plate for two people which is a very large amount of food. The frittata was good, but the breakfast plate came with huge sausages that looked like hamburger patties which had very little flavor. 

We were interested in getting the Caramel Apple Fritters but weren't sure if it would be too much food, but the waitress recommended that we do get them so we did. There were three and each was pretty big. They were doughy in the middle and undercooked. We at one and shared this with the waitress who offered to make us a new batch, but we were so stuffed after one that we didn't need two more. She still charged us for these. 

It's a good place overall, long drink menu, and creative plates, and we walked in and got a seat immediately. Friendly staff and right across the street from this cool park with lots of neat boutiques and fun activities.",akgMrTkbtc80Coh4t5Kzpg,0,0,4,7vCphQfKl-MIEqbETliWhQ

I think our waiters name was Chuck, he was very friendly and noticed my debit card had the Padres on it. He told me he was from San Diego and we chatted about baseball for a few minutes. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, feels like you're in the middle of a neighborhood with the big front windows, we sat right next to the big window that over looks Carson. 

The menu is great! A lot of interesting combinations of ingredients. We started off with the whipped ricotta and tomatoes, it was an excellent appetizer. It is a bowl of whipped ricotta with some small cherry tomatoes they tasted like they were marinated in balsamic. Olive oil was drizzled over the top along with some basil, think caprese but served as a dip with some grilled bread in the shape of breadsticks. 

For our entrees I got the Glutton burger which was an awesome burger, especially the cheese a combination of three different cheeses I think Parmesan, cheddar, and another that I can't remember. The burger was huge and a little messy but very tasty. I upgraded my fries to the mushroom poutine fries, they were good but there was a little bit too much of a ""tang"" for my liking, kind of tasted like a vinegar drizzle, there was just a little bit too much of it I think. They aren't your average gravy cheese curd poutine, still good but different and too much ""tang"". 

My girlfriend had the brown butter gnocchi, it had pork cheek with it I believe. The gnocchi itself was very good and fresh as well as the cheek. The gnocchi was a very small dish, so if you are expecting a big plate or are very hungry you may want to get another plate to accompany it. 

For dessert we had the pineapple upside down cake with Apple cider ice cream. It was a top notch dessert! The Carmel sauce and like a brown sugar cinnamon crumble that accompanied it was a perfect addition to elevate the cake. 

We live just down the street so I'm sure we will be stopping in again at some point to try some other things.",NR8hSGOUqD-iY8rQPw4UAg,1,1,4,Cj9W4Bf0SI3PVL-Hs4Josg

Went on Sunday 11-1-15 around 5:30 PM for an early dinner.  The restaurant is located on Carson, behind container park, right beside Vegenation and two doors down from Zydeco.  

$28.22 got me the prime flank steak, apple cobbler, and a ginger ale.  

The ginger ale was flat and 3/4 of the cup was filled with ice. 

$8.00 apple cobbler was served first.  I asked for it with the meal but hey, no biggie.  It was served room temperature and very sloppily presented, spilling out of its dish.  I have never in my life been served cobbler at room temperature.  I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be like that and she said ""I'm not sure...it's a new menu item.""  Then she suggested I pour the bourbon sauce on the cobbler.  Not the best idea since I was sharing the dish with my 16 month old son.  Although I was tempted to help him sleep better than night, I decided that drunken babies are probably frowned upon.  The miniscule scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and the bourbon sauce was the best thing I ate there last night.  

$18.00 prime flank steak with mushroom fondue, blue cheese relish.  This is the worst thing I have eaten in 2015.  Although they managed to make a very modest cut of meat very tender, the flavor was terrible and bland, bland, bland.  I asked for medium and was served an almost well-done piece of meat swimming in the most disgusting vinegar-y sauce.  There was no flavor, no depth, no richness, no salt, only vinegar and blue cheese.  Maybe my palette is not refined enough or something...if this is how rich people eat I'd rather stay poor.  I would rather lick the inside of a dumpster behind a nursing home than eat this again.  

It pains me to give this place such a low review, especially since the staff was so nice to us, but the food was bad.  Next time I will try their brunch or breakfast items.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,7,8,2,Q7OvKJ079CLTrdZJ0v_Xmg

I was so excited over restaurant week and trying this local establishment but the unaccommodating chef and manager as well as the food really put a bad taste in my mouth. The menu offered, had what I thought was a lamb and octopus choice however to my surprise you received both. When I informed our server Jade that I did not eat lamb i asked if I could get a garden salad instead. After she went back to ask the chef, she informed us that there was no substitutions whatsoever and there would be no accommodation made. I asked again if I could get anything in place of the Lamb since I did not eat lamb, the manager then came over and said no. Once receiving the octopus I found it to be extremely overcooked and  unappetizing. Also since I don't eat lamb I wasn't able to enjoy the rest of my meal. The only thing that saved this restaurant was that Jade who was pleasant through service however i would not ever return or recommend for the food quality. I was also surprised that they were so unaccommodating when all i asked for was something that would be a less cost than the original offering due to dietary restrictions.",4STalMGbC_YDqaiEz2p9Cg,1,0,1,HUwGwGDVMAzgYDXtUzFPrA
