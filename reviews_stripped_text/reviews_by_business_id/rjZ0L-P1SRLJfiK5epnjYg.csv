You walk in and it's just a bunch of booths selling spas and blinds and phones and non-working health devices. I saw nothing ""cultural"" or ""religious"". The food was way overpriced for what it was. If you have no means of getting out of the city, then this might be the place for you; I have experienced festivals waay better than this one. 

Even though parking is free and everyone wants a close parking spot (who doesn't?), you're better off parking in the Bass Pro Shop parking lot and walking either through the store or around the Bass Pro Shop and to the front of the Silverton. You'll save yourself a lot of time and hassle and the police directing traffic. If you take that main turn to the Silverton, you're going to be stuck for a while with everyone else going to the Festival. Keep going straight and around the corner and you'll see a place where you can turn left to the Bass Pro Shop parking area.

Oh, and don't forget to bring CASH. Don't get stuck pulling out money at the ATMs they set up front.",40XJCWv0kMmo6dL8ZBNv3Q,4,0,1,iBMW5Ye-mbMSXI1-fiX0qQ
303486,2012-06-14,24,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"My Italian family back in Pittsburgh would smack me upside the head if I were to bring them here and then call this an ""Italian Festival.""  Seriously, all I can hear in my head is my Uncle Vince saying, ""What the hell is the matter with you??!""  

When you walk in, you are greeted by Republican candidates, real estate agents, and several booths where you can ""Spin the Wheel! Everyone is a Winner!""  Once you get past the gauntlet, you find yourself amongst the food.

So we started to make a lap around the booths.  I was hoping to find some Italian restaurants from town I could try and maybe grab a slice of pizza.  Instead, I found nothing.  Either it was not vegetarian or had been sitting in the hot sun for far too long.  

Ummmmm now what?  We made another lap.  That's when I noticed that none of the booths had a business name on them.  They all just said ""Italian Sausage"" or ""Calamari"" or ""Pizza.""  So this is just a traveling festival and nothing they sell here is local?  LAME.

I finally found a local caterer and wound up getting a $5 Caprese salad that came in a Dixie cup with a slice of garlic bread.  I'm still starving!!  I then broke down and went to one of the generic booths selling pizza.  They wanted $7 for a slice that looked like it had been sitting out for the last two hours.  No thanks.  I got an ice cream cone and decided I had enough.  I'm out.

On the way out we walked past some circus side shows that involved snakes and monkeys.  I knew I would get too depressed looking at them so I kept walking by.  And then I proceeded to get super depressed watching the poor ponies being forced to walk in circles in the heat without any kids even riding them... or the sheep covered in wool that looked like they were going to pass out from the heat..... Then there went someone selling used hot tubs....and crappy jewelry....and ugly t-shirts....

Oh, and did I mention that they also sold Mexican, Greek, and Japanese food here?  There goes my Uncle Vince again....

So in short: I have been to Greek, Lebanese, Indonesian, and Hawaiian festivals in this town.  They all represent their cultures well and are made up of small businesses or churches.  The people running this mess apparently think that Italians only eat sausage and old pizza and like to buy used hot tubs.

997924,2012-05-10,0,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"Just got back from the first 2012 Feast, and we had a GREAT TIME! This was our 4th time going since we went to our first one, and this one has been the best so far, followed closely by the first visit (since a bunch of my friends went, now it's usually just my husband two kids and I. I don't understand why nobody wants to go..) 

ANYwho, you just have to know how to work the system! It was at the Rio again, which I don't really mind what location they use, but I've never had to pay for parking. I'm not sure what that's about down below.. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say the website, but there is one online that we purchase our San Genarro musts before we even go to the event. 

On there, we get two people in for $7 (kids are little and free), and we get the Anthony's Steak Sandwich vouchers online from this site for $4.50 a piece ($9 at the venue). Those include any sandwich, sausage or steak. Delicious!! We love them. The real kicker however is the amusement wristbands. Normally $25, we get them for $15 on this site! Best thing I've ever done. Our kids went on a ton of rides, even though there isn't much for my youngest, she's not 36 inches yet, but I think we used them up wonderfully. Oh, and the first two nights either Mom or Dad is free, so that's unlimited rides for $45 for four people. I think that's a steal.

My ONLY problem, is that everything else food wise is SO EXPENSIVE! I don't understand the $15 pasta plates, $6 pizza slices or the $7 fried Oreos. You can get them downtown for .99 cents. Besides, the whole point in my opinion is to go and try LOTS of things, because there's so much to choose from. You can't do that at those prices and portion sizes. They really need to rethink this strategy.

My husband had his sausage sandwich from Anthony's, and an outright AMAZING baked potato from another vender there. I had my steak sandwich from Anthony's, and a slice of cheese pizza later from another vender down the right lane. It was fantastic. I had the tiramisu from the ladies that keep the slices out on the counter down the right next to another popular eatery there (I wish I could remember these names guys, sorry.) But the best of all was the Gelato we got for the kids! It was so creamy and delicious, lots of flavors. They had the strawberry and the pistatio, and the guy gave us ""kids scoops"" for $2, which were plenty. He was super sweet and was donating all his tips to charity. Really great stuff.

Due to all this, we're actually going to go again tomorrow night, so I will come back and name all these places, as I'm pretty sure they are there every year, and I'll see if I can include that website. The wristbands go quickly, so there aren't any left for this year however. That's okay, get them for the September Feast!",bz7P6roLHXUlbYKuJSKcew,5,1,4,VEv0k4z4JcNDpRi_HYWuSg
1131710,2010-05-10,3,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"Calling all Italian food and entertainment lovers!!!

I have been going to the annual San Gennaro feast couple times a year, when it was at 215/flamingo. And now they have moved their location to Silverton casino! 

So here are my overall thoughts...

[FOOD] 
The overall food was average and not to mention! pricey! holy cow! We had the ""infamous"" sausage and pepper sandwich $8 (meh), garlic fries $6 (yum), and of course for dessert... the funnel cake! (dark & white chocolate drizzle with cherries on top $6) mmmm! **2 stars 
Tip for thought - bring cash to this event because its an easier transaction, some vendors don't accept credit/debit cards. 

[RIDES] 
The only highlight for me was Wednesday's, MOM'S RIDE FOR FREE!! whoo hoo. Saved $25. They also had Father's ride for free on Thursday! Fri-Sun is regular fees. Too bad they don't have a 'kids ride for free' day too! that would of made the rating higher haha. Just sayin. They sell unlimited wristbands for $25 - definite must for my daughter and for all kids. **2 stars

[ENTERTAINMENT] 
no offense...but the music is not what I'm use to, I digg it on some levels. Its just not my cup of tea. however, the alcohol drinks helped!!! haha. 

I like the fact that this event is twice a year. It's nice to get away from the hectic Vegas nightlife and shenanigans. It's definitely something you'd want to check out for some fun and enjoyment.",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,5,5,4,qv0_buRV1HdVQTy906dBKA
1224842,2013-05-13,2,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"Ey, foget about it... 

It's a Vegas favorite. As you may know there are one or two Italians in Las Vegas. More? Oh. Of course. Better believe this Italian goes both spring and fall. It's a complete county fair along with an entire Italian flare. 

Hungry? Hope so. To truly experience the array of cuisine at this fest I recommend taking a small group and sharing a bit of everything you can eat. Vegan and veggies, sorry, you'll have little to choose from. However I suppose you're used to that. Oh!

Bring plenty of cash with you as few vendors have card readers and the atm fee is 5$. Worry not, there's plenty to spend it on. Clothing, jewelry, accessories, art of all kinds. It really never ends. 

Great live music throughout the 4 days on the main stage. Guitar wielding duos with accordions traveling about singing your favorite Italian classics and posing for pictures as well. 

Is it hot? Uh yeah, we're in the desert. Drink plenty of water and you're good.

The food is amazingly amazing. I'm a big fan of Italian food. Correction, authentic Italian food and its great here. Everything from baked zitti to zepoles, to lamb gyros to kabobs. The food is a bit pricey, anywhere from $9-$15, but at the end its worth it. 

Great drink specials from beers that range from $4-$6 and AMF's and margaritas from $4-$6 as well. The park rides are $3-$8 depending on the ride but you can always get a $25 ride pass and you're good.

I'm glad they held it at the Rio Hotel this year rather than the Silverton. That equals more room and better parking. Looking towards the next event.",WX1k1QLhG6_kmbK-R2YQiQ,2,0,4,xCvDUAmYJITchjvkDXUIkg

They had Italian food made in big pans, everything Italian, but it was cold (my friend ordered pasta). They had the pans sitting over bricks but it seemed like the food was just sitting their throughout the day/night without anything below keeping it warm. I would have had the shrimp scampi pasta but after my friend said her pasta was cold, I decided to go with the asada-dog since they made it in front of you. Only thing was their horchata was nothing like horchata. Also, I would suggest bringing a bottle of water or drink if you don't want to pay $3 for a cup of water. I've been to festivals/feasts where they had a water refill station, at no cost (you just bring your own bottle). I think it's a little ridiculous to charge $3 for a cup of water.

Other than that,  we walked around looking at the many food options, vendors, rides, and games. 
I really liked how the seating area was constantly being cleaned by staff members. That was great. 
We ended up eating cheesesteak phillies along with tea from Oooh Wee sweet tea. It was the greatest combination ever. Every bite, every sip. I honestly wanted seconds! 
As the wind started to finally calm down, we walked over to the rides section and saw the cute petting zoo and lots of other games and rides. We didn't ride anything though. 
Then we shared a delicious homemade funnel cake. 
Besides the horrible grass hurricanes of fury and the expensive prices, It was honestly a really great night. I think between my husband and I, we spent about $60-65 for the whole night, which is higher than our usual outings!

Cons:  
The ground was absolutely filled with not just dirt and pebbles but huge rocks.  Pushing a stroller or even walking was horrible.  I can't even tell you how many people I saw trip or accidentally kick large rocks at people.  This area needs to be cleared and grated before hosting another event.  All of our feet actually hurt after walking on rocks all night.  I can't believe no one got really hurt.  Lawsuit waiting to happen.
Just like every carnival the rides are so overpriced.  I hate feeling like I'm getting ripped off.
The carnival vendors (food/beverage trailers) were expensive and the employees were rude.
The festival layout felt cramped and chaotic.  It was hard to get around in certain areas due to how close booths were with small pathways.

Pros:
The fireworks were beautiful and I'm glad we stayed to watch.  My kids and I really enjoyed them.
The Happy Nest booth had a lovely quiet spot for feeding and changing babies.
The fresh funnel cake booth by the stage was amazing and fairly priced.  The staff was great there too.
North Las Vegas Police did a great job keeping the peace and ensuring parking was smooth.  Our entrance and exit was the easiest we ever had at a San Gennaro Feast.

Somebody was trying to charge for parking, but it was free at Gold Coast across street. I can picture this place becoming a hellish mob of sweat and people on the weekends because the aisles are way too small and there clearly isn't enough places to sit. On this Thursday night at 9pm, it was almost full, so chaos might reign in a few days.
    The $7 large slice of Spinach and Chese and garlic for starters was quite bold in taste and was easily foldable to boot. It's the only place that has that variety of pizza, so you can't miss it. Main course was the $10 monster slab of Lasagna from i think JUniror's? It was right in the pan that it was baked in and she cut a healthy chunk off for me. I had to add the garlic bread for a buck and talked her into a 2nd piiece for free, but bread was hard and not good at all. The sauce on the lasagna was a solid red and this thing had some good layering of cheese, meat, and noodles under the excessive sauce. No way you can eat this standing up, but it was filling and worth the price. Finally, the sight of an overflowing dish of cannoli's with Chocolate chips appeared and for $4 scooped up one at the Sweet Shop - easy to spot too. These were filled with a heavier cream than usual, but it made for a different and denser pastry, but still top notch.

2340305,2017-09-18,3,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"Well this is truly my most disappointing review. I have to admit that I agree with the overall 2 star rating for what this festival has become over time.

Here's what they did well to earn their 2 stars:
1. They do a great job of offering you variety. Even though it's a Italian themed food festival, that doesn't stop the owners from bringing in vendors from all food varieties. This includes merchandise. Any and all vendors are welcome to take up a spot.

2. The venue is covered in ATM's. As most of the vendors if not all only take cash, the festival coordinators have generously made cash available at any turn. For a fee of course.

Now here is where they lose points as a whole:
1. Food Sanitation- most vendors have prepared food for the festival that is exposed to open air and uncovered so that you can see what they offer. Gross.

2. Pricing- it's obvious that this is a weekend cash grab for this festival. Understanding that they need to turn a profit there is still a difference between profit and down right price gouging. 
$35 for ride wrist band (Ads say $30)
$15 for most vendors for a simple plate of prepare air exposed food.
$20lb for unclean unveiled shrimp
$10 to get in
$3 to park

3. Ride vendor- I have attached photos of the banged up rides that have severe wear to them that has been provided for this festival. I would never set foot on any of these pop up rides",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,9,4,2,txUdxmnsj-i17-ldwKG5sQ

People demonstrating Kitchen Chef cutlery, a Mexican women selling premature baby turtles which probably doesn't have a permit, and a bunch of knockoff, cheap goods.

In Vegas, most if not all of the beer festivals, concerts, wine walks, etc. are overly expensive and yet there never seems to be a shortage of people ready to pony up the cash to take part. San Gennaro is no exception. It can be costly, especially if you are not a coupon user and/or have a large family. 

I had a group buy for 2 VIP tickets (which just meant we got to bypass the ticket line) for $8. So it only cost $4 per person to get in. Not bad. After that I pretty much just walked around and people watched while stuffing my face with food and drinks. No, it is not the best, most authentic Italian food I have ever had. Maybe that's because I'm not in Italy. I'm in a casino parking lot in Las Vegas with port-a-potties and a petting zoo. (Insert comment about bringing hand sanitizer.)

Lots of vendors will gladly give you a sample to try before you buy so you'll never get stuck with a food purchase you don't like. Obviously there are exceptions, like the roasted corn on the cob. You can't sample it first but it smells wonderful and is one of the few vegetable options offered here. The fried dough covered in powdered sugar is good if you get one fresh and hot. Don't accept one that is already cooked, sitting on the counter under the heat lamps. It's $4, they will make you a fresh one and it is worth the wait. Wash it all down with a lemonade or draft beer for $4/$5. Purchase a baby turtle in a small ""aquarium"" for $12 and call it a night. 

Per Dennis. T: parking in the garage near the buffet isn't a bad idea. 

Also, you can hit the restrooms when you walk through the casino. There is a line outside for the port-a's.",u9w4LOoKYsM00Scb0HCH1w,2,1,4,XZstIWVAsgEeDyGuKRL7-A

- parking was crowded, though not a problem to find a spot

- Admission can be pricey, so search the net for $4.00 off coupons. Worth it!

- I was disappointed that the chicken parmesan left much to be desired. I came with an empty stomach and the notion that my taste buds were going to be in ecstasy with every bite of dripping marinara, but nope. It tasted like watered down Prego sauce, hard noodles and too-hard chicken. It might have just been the vendor that I chose. 

- I was bummed about my less than perfect chicken parm encounter, but that was almost forgotten when we went and rode the carnival rides. Lots to ride, lots to laugh about and almost pee your pants if you're not much of a thrill seeker in carnival ride form, like me.

- entertainment. I love the mix of entertainment on the 'main stage'. Older gentlemen belting out tunes I've never heard of, accordion acts, more older gentlemen dancing. I truly enjoyed this aspect.

- people watching was on par. Who wears tight mini dresses and 5 inch heels to a parking lot location? Oh yeah, people who go to this Feast. Was that Snooki and Deena I just saw? 

- I snapped out of my sad food mood when I saw BROWNIES, BANANAS and STRAWBERRIES DRIZZLED IN CHOCOLATE, ON STICKS!

Even with the worst expectations, this festival stooped below that! There is nothing Italian about this festival. It's more like a cinco de mayo carnival or a shitty kabob cook-off. You're better off going to First Friday for quality food! 

People hate this fest - for good reason too. It. was. terrible. So terrible! I had to see it, to believe it. 

When we first moved here a few months ago, we were actually really looking forward to going to the ""Italian Fest"" (...yeah right) since my boyfriend is Italian. But after hearing and reading about all of the horror stories, scams, and terrible food, our enthusiasm died down immediately. Unfortunately, we didn't get to dodge the bullet this time since our friends wanted to meet there for dinner and I didn't have the heart to crush on their plans. 

The verdict? Let me tell you this, it's not worth it at all. At all! Everyone in our party had this look of complete disgust on their face by the end of the night. Talk about buyers remorse! Not only was this ""fake Italian food Fest"" a scam, so were the not-so-Italian vendors acting overly stereotypical ""Italian"" 

Vendor: Ayyyyye guys whaddya gonna do?! Comma try authentic sausage and peppahs justa likea momma usedtah to makea! 

Me: no thanks 

Vendor: ahhhhhhhhhhhh! You see dis!? You see dis? (Throwing his arms theatrically in the air in disappointment that we're not buying his food) 

Me: Keep walking. Hurry. 


Here's how you quickly burn money:
- $18 for 2 adults to enter this hell-hole called San Gennaro Feast

- $8 for doughy-as-hell, stale, and nasty funnel cake from Funnel Cake Factory

- $15 (!!!!?) for a super ripoff ((1 inch)) lobster (cut with all crab) roll from the Lobsta Trap. Are you f'n kidding me?! Who the hell do you think you are playin' with give'n us that ant sized portion!?

- $12 (?!!) for ((3)) !!! offensively-salt-bombed jumbo cajun shrimp from T&T's Shrimp Basket

- $10 for a plate of stupid, overcooked, burnt, rock-hard steak and dry-as-death chicken kabobs with wilted salad and dripping in oil, soggy fries from Kabob House 

^^^ you have been duly warned. 

Only 3 items were actually decent and worth recommending:
- $5 for 2: 1 chicken and 1 pulled pork tacos topped with coleslaw and a side of baked bean chili from Billy's Bar-B-Que. I highly recommend the pull pork tacos topped with coleslaw! Juicy and delicious!!! 5/5

- $4 dried and overcooked BBQ corn from the Roasted Corn on the Cob stand. The corn was overcooked but it was pleasantly sweet. Just make sure to add all of those toppings and you're in business! 3/5

- $5 for a cold, bread-y, mushroom & olive calzone from JR's fine Italian Cuisine. The gal apologized to us that it was cold and took it back to reheat it. That didn't do much to make it better, but my Italian boyfriend ended up finding a glimmer of satisfaction in it. 3/5

2705159,2015-05-14,0,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"We have been to this event in previous years, however this experience reminds me why we do not make it out to the bi-annual event.  First issue was the entry fee.  At $9 a head I would seek out a special discount or coupon to make this expense more manageable.  We searched online and found one for two $$'s of each adult.  A plus was the no charge for the Kiddos. They do get you however at the carnival area where they charge anywhere from $3-5 per ride.  Ouch! The best deal would be to get the wrist band for $30 and this will allow you to ride as much as the little kids desire (big kids too). 

Now to the food....they have just about every type of food imaginable which is odd seeing that is an Italian festival with feast in it's name.  They had Thai, Middle Eastern, Mexican, American and many more.  The food was rather high  priced for what you get I feel.  Example being a Philly Cheese  Steak with no side  for $9 or the $11 Falafel or the $5 Slushy.  This most likely not the vendors fault but the organizers and there high cost of space or booth rental for the 4 day event.  

Some of the Vendors were a little odd as well, many of which were not in any way related to Italian American Culture or Heritage.  I was surprised to see vendors promoting magic pain lotions, shoe polish, cell phone accessories, and portable fans and misters.  The cover count for an event like this I am sure is up to at least 10,000 visitors a day.  If you want to beat the crowd arrive early in the afternoon to avoid long food lines.  Quality is sacrificed because cooks are not making as much fresh food.  If you like a big party come when the sun starts to set and I am sure you will enjoy the event with adult beverages.  

Entertainment wise at San Gennaro, the kids on stage were pretty cute singing there top forty songs and doing there little dances.  I enjoyed the eating contests the most.  We witnessed ""El Torro"" become the 3 time meatball eating Champ.  The Cannoli one was quite gross because it looked like vomit both coming and going.

Went last night with friends. You have to pay $9 to get in. The food is good but rediculously overpriced. I had a smoothie it was $7 a plate of pasta was $14 and a cup of soda was $6. Very good italian food but the prices were unacceptable. You can't pay with credit cards, so you have to use their ATM machines that charge $5 per transaction.

The rides... you have to pay $5 per ride or $30 unlimited. What a rip off. With the wife and kids I spent over $300 in 4 hours.

The parking was a complete fiasco. The the line to get in... 1.5 hour wait in line. They were totally understaffed and the whole thing was not set up with any type of direction. There were so many people walking around you couldn't move. And like most carnivals in Las Vegas, 90% of the people were human scum. Multiple fights breaking out, gang members, etc. As I was waiting for the kids to get off a ride these black guys would walk up to me and ask if I wanted to buy cocaine at least one time every 5 minutes. After 11pm there were literally mobs of black kids straight outta the ghetto wearing gang colors and bling bling everywhere.

There were only 2 toilets, rent-a-johns, that were so filthy people were running out of them. No toilet paper, feces all over the floor, used tampons on the floor, and a stench that would make anyone puke.

If this event was run PROPERLY and prices weren't so high they'd get much better reviews. Management needs to get a grip.

Another tidbit...they need to keep the vendors Italian themed. There were vendors selling time share scams, air conditioning units, vacatins to Mexico, nudie bar tickets, etc. There were also multiple vendors selling the same product (who the hell needs 8 vendors selling plastic jewelry).

One positive thing, the VERY FEW actual italian people working the booths were very polite. They were elderly but they brought back memories of Little Italy in NYC.",xYuJAH8j6ExWEyP00819SA,4,2,1,GAi4UgQZkNZJjTmlrTKZvw

A seafood vendor ""Lobster Muddah""(?) was actually very good. Depending on who you took a gamble on, the food was good or bad. Pizzas were doughy, some meatballs were loaded with bread crumbs. Prices for food were ridiculous. You would have thought you were in a proper restaurant. The covered seating area was adequate during the day but once it got busier in the evening you had to be aggressive to find a place to sit. Entertainment on Saturday was the highlight for us. The Las Vegas Bee Gees played at 5pm and were great. Unfortunately the organizers didn't have a schedule for entertainment at the venue or website, so you were on your own to figure it out. The carnival rides were your typical roadshow of rides and games. Once the sun started going down things got interesting. People were obviously dumping their kids without supervision at the event.

STEAMED ARTICHOKE W/WHITE WINE CHZ SAUCE & BREAD PUDDING $10 - it was a huge artichoke but would have to say not worth my money... i susually get the other artichoke that is smother in a red type of sauce. It was cold & tastes sour =/

STUFFED PEPPERS - friend got this & it was green bell pepper stuffed w/ meatball w/ marinara sauce poured on top... from the same place I got the artichoke so it was also cold, sure it would have tasted better hot.

FRIED ALIGATOR - was expecting something super crunchy & tough for the meat part but it was surprisingly delicious. It came w/ a type of aioli to dip in & the texture was flaky like fish.

BANANA & NUTELLA FUNNEL CAKE $8 - freaken BEST thing that we ate here & thank god it was the last thing that went into my mouth because it was DELICIOUS! The dough was just right & slightly doughy on the inside while being crispy on the outside. Definately could have used a lot more Nutella to cover the dough.

BEEF BRACIOLI FRIES $8 - one of the FIRST items we ate when we walked in & it was delicious as well. It was fat fries with meatballs & marinara sauce all over. I would have to say it was super expensive for the portion though.

And try to protect our food from getting seasoned by dust hay.

There were tons of food booths though. I was impressed by one of the corner booths that had a display lined up of huge cooking pots. The only thing that bothered me was the food was sitting out in the sun uncovered. Some of it was seafood too. Plus they were so huge. I wonder if they sold enough. And how old was the oldest of it?

SO, first of all, the ground is paved in the food tents areas--although still unpaved in the games/rides areas (don't know for sure, but I saw some past reviews state that the ground was dirt and painful gravel everywhere which a lot of people disliked especially on windy days). I wore cruddy shoes to the Festival in anticipation of this and was pleasantly surprised to see that the ground was actually paved this time and wasn't going to get even my ugly shoes dirty.

The tents offered plenty of food options, but as other Yelpers have pointed out, not all of the food tents are actual Italian food, sadly (I guess, how could they be?). What I WAS happy about, though, is that the food tents that we did pick had good food and I, luckily, wasn't disappointed by anything that I ate although friends that were with me didn't like everything they had. My best suggestion: shop around to avoid any food choices you'll regret. Look at other peoples' food, too! Your nose is your best friend, here.

Yes, it's expensive. Entry after coupon was still $16/couple. AND food inside is not cheap. We scoped the games and found a couple that were fun, affordable and (most importantly) beatable. So my group and I stuck to some fun things that worked for us. We didn't stay for hours upon hours, but we ate a good amount of food and played a couple of good games. I guess my SO and I always know/anticipate that these food festival things always get a little pricey and planned accordingly.

All-in-all, I'd say, we had a lot of fun (more than I thought we would, actually). I personally had some great food (the Italian sausage and peppers stand at the front of the park was really good and so was the fresh squeezed lemonade) and I think I'd go back again next year if a bunch of friends wanted to go with me again.",WDm0OqWQoLuqFo36woMiEA,4,2,3,1RqcF_UqAzyE9iMfhTVlLQ

The looks of pure joy in my babies eyes while going up, down and running around on all the rides made it worth every penny. 

If you go online you can print out coupons for reduced admission (two adults for $14...instead of $18 and a $5 off unlimited ride band which puts it at $20). Another really cool thing was that we went on the night where mommies can ride for free, which was lovely because my little dare devil daughter wasn't quite tall enough to go on some of the kiddie rides by herself. I know tonight (Thursday) the daddies ride for free. 

The food is pretty tasty and yes its pricey. I highly recommend Fat Sonny's booth...they were super nice and made a nice plate for the kids of shells, marinara, cheese and meatballs (must try their real restaurant).

I wore flats.

It's been three days and i'm still being punished for my decision. The place is all on really rocky, as in covered with sharp rocks, ground.

Also be prepared to walk a good ten minutes to get into the actual fair.

Also be prepared to pay.

Entry- $10.00/Person
Food- Ranges between $7.00-$30.00 per item
Drinks- Ranges Between $6.00-$12.00 per drink
Games- $5.00/Game but usually everyone wins at least a little something
Rides- $30.00 for an all access wrist band.

Not a cheap fair by any means.

It was pretty packed which did not surprise me being the last night of the fair. For the most part the food was decent (No where near worth what they were charging) but decent all the same. The live entertainment was surprisingly good, and the games and rides were what you would expect at any fair/carnival type of event.

Coming from San Diego where the Del Mar Fair is perceived, and for good reason, to be one of the best most extensive and lavish county fairs in the area. I was a tad dissapointed, but I did enjoy myself for the most part.

4409613,2011-08-26,2,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"I spend more time looking for positive experiences and memories than people may believe. Times are hard, I'm at the point where I can't think of many positive things about the future and most of my future plans don't extend beyond getting thru the week. 

Present tense, I spend most of my time looking for more ways to make money than the 3 stooges did with all the odd jobs, schemes, etc. Applying has just become something that makes everyone doubt one's strongest abilities. And thanks to the internet, I now have to worry about personal information and credit theft and automated, untraceable scams offering me more income if I ""spend a little money to make a lot of money.""

So that leaves the past. We can always find things that were great before, especially before the ""big change."" Even though locations have changed, I've always found San Gennaro's at least consistent in it's offerings every year I went. 

Every year, I say I want to go to Clark County Fair. And every year, I had work, didn't have money, or didn't have a way to get out far north of town where it often is located. So in valley festivals became the staple I counted on. 

I saw San Gennaro's as where I literally feasted 1-2 times a year. I ate more here than I did on Thanksgiving and X-mas, 2 holidays I was used to working instead of celebrating. 

Most festivals have similar components that people complain about every year, yet I didn't see attendances decreasing any. In fact, I'd say it's easily one of the top 10 events of the year I talked with friends about going to. There are many things that cost a lot and yet we go once or twice a year to ""reward"" or ""indulge"" ourselves. 

Most of these things I understand. Vendor booths are for whoever wants to pay them for the most part. Those booths have things from the miracle seen on tv products to hot tubs, to things you don't know why they're being sold. Usually, we checked out all the booths and ate. 

And before leaving, if something passed all my mental reasoning we'd go back and check something out one more time. Booths bargain more at the end of the night/ festival. 

The rides we know can be dangerous from the shoddy maintenance and wear, but we go on at least a few rides no matter how much the tickets are. And as a former ride mechanic, I have gone on rides, knowing there were ""extra parts"" still laying around the base of the ride. The scariest thing a man can see besides a kick in the crotch is a butter knife in a tool box. Dance with death.

There are a lot of things for kids to do, most cost money. The biggest moral dilemma I still think is neat is the live fish ping pong ball toss. It's cool kids can win fish as pets, they're simple(r) to take care of if they are healthy to begin with. As far as pets go, it's least traumatic when a goldfish passes away than a larger pet.

Most importantly, out of most yearly events, I think there's an issue of safety that's taken for granted. The Feast is always well lit, there is adequate police presence. I never saw fights break out in the midway that decreased the popularity of my hometown fair. 

Food is more of a focus than alcohol and team rivalry, or music that fans believe they need to be on hallucinogens to enjoy. I believe those are the biggest factor of public nuisances. I believe a full belly keeps people happy and non combative.

It's why I always thought of San Gennaro's feast as one of the most consistent festivals year after year for families, everyone.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,1,1,5,0ily-W4KPrp-IBfG4HQ6HA

The only way to control how much you spend is to bring $20, a few friends to share food with, and leave your atm card at home.  also bring your own drinks because it was HOT HOT HOT there! and plus, its $$$ for beverages anyways.

the part i disliked was that many booths didn't have prices, and that there wasn't a map of some sort to indicate which booth had what.  Is that too much to ask for?  maybe, idk.  but i felt like all the booths were the same.  but then you see someone else's food and you wonder where they got it and you get mad because you wish you had gone there instead. cuz that happened to me... my funnel cake was flat and this family had a huge puffy won, and i was a little jealous. and it turns out they bought it on the other side of the venue...whatever, what can i do but live and learn?

so we were able to try a philly cheesesteak for $9,  funnel cakes were $6 for a plain.  theres a booth with two huge ravioli,  meatballs and a breadstick for $5, sausage and peppers were i think $8 and pizza by the slice was $5.  there was more we tried, but not worth mentioning.  

it was a fun experience.  i think this feast is the closest thing to a county fair las vegas has, which is a shame.  in any case, i would go again in september, but never again on a saturday night.",ZMp-I7Jm9LpnCErn9TbjiQ,1,1,3,JnL0eKFp8TDnPNGYfQp6xQ

When you enter, you come up this row and the third booth in on the right is a Veterans Booth and they ask for a $1 donation for a bottle of water.  I will tell you, this is the cheapest bottle you will get there, because all the other places charge from $1.50 to $3.00.  The $3.00 one's are just plain scum bags and don't deserve to be there, selling the same bottle for $3.00 that you can get for $1.00 and it helps the Veterans (not a hard choice there).

Once you come up to the ""T"" you have 4 rows, 2 with food and 2 with crafts for sale.  On the left is a place called Lucy's and I had the WORST Philly Cheese Steak I have ever had.  I lived in Philly for 6 years and the dumpiest place in Philly still served a better cheese steak then these people.  It was very disappointing and NOT worth $10.00.

Across from them is a place called Anthony's and for less money, you will get the best cheese steak you can find next to POPS out on Decatur.  This was more like an authentic steak.

The food is ok, nothing to write home about and certainly not worth the price the venders charge.  You can get a much better Italian dish at Buen Guesto on Eastern and Horizon Ridge in the Albertson's Shopping center for a much cheaper price.  People were nice, but its like a traveling carnival with over priced food that does not taste as good as the signs say they are.  Will I go back, once a year if more then enough, however, next time I will probably go full so I don't have to spend a ridiculous amount of money for very very LOW quality food.  

On a good note, Carmines had pizza which was very good.  They are located on the right side of the food booths towards the back and they are worth the price.  A slice is a little more then in a regular place, but worth the price.

Overall all, for the prices they charge, I can only give this even a 2 and unless forced to drive, I would never go back to this event again, its not worth my time, money or oxygen....",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,4,1,2,cYKcljq6UDOk2-WIdz7TMQ

1: Parking. Fleece your customers to park sort of close or fleece them a little less and make them walk halfway across the west side of Vegas to get a parking space. 
1a: Find the surliest, most hateful parking attendants in Vegas. Hire them based on attitude. 
2: Find the most disorganized and slow way of getting people to the gate to pay admission. Did the ice sheet in Antarctica melt by the time it took us to get in? 
3: Once inside run past the pushy merchants trying to sell you everything. 
4: Pay out the nose for food. No let's take an arm and a leg too. 
5: Offer a super tiny itsy bitsy teeny weenie little place to sit and eat your overpriced food. (Think Strip prices but on the wrong side of I-15). Oh wait, we don't want you to sit, that would take up too much space we need for maximum monetization of the event!
6: Let's charge way too much for carnival ride tickets. 
7: Let your friends cut in front of everyone that waited 20 min for a ride. (Happened 4x)
8:Fight hordes of rude, stupid people who must have been born in a barn and don't have a freakin clue about basic courtesy.
9: Walk back to your car that was supposedly watched by ""security"" to find your mirror broken off and dangling and other damage done to your car. 

Las Vegas deserves a San Gennaro Feast that is in the Italian traditions, not the Mafia traditions. I felt like I got fleeced, mugged, and downright abused at this year's event. 

Someone needs to step back and rethink what the heck they're doing here. This could be a world class event but the way it's going, this will be the last year I go back.

4765234,2009-09-21,3,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"Don't get me wrong, I had SOME fun at this place, but not a lot. 

First off, the food. The food's not very good, to be honest. There's a lot of VERY pushy sales-people. (Lady, I don't want your goddamned Philly Cheesesteak for the 5th time... I GET sandwiches from a sub shop that specializes in them.) 

A lot of the food is left sitting in the sun for hours. This scares me from a health/safety standpoint. Most of the fare is carnival food, with a few exceptions. The pizza was very dry and unpleasant looking. The only positive point was my funnel cake that I had. 

--

Second - The booths. There's a LOT of garbage being peddled here. Also on the way in, they tried to loop us into a scam, saying we had won a free trip by giving us a swipe card etc. I swiped the card, and put in my first and last name, then it was saying ""I agree to allow X company (I think Wyndham) to contact me"" and then started asking for my phone number. I quickly canceled out and discarded the card, then took my friend away from the pushy salesperson telling her they were giving her a trip to Mexico or whatever at no obligation... (riiiiight, and I have a bridge in San Francisco to sell you)

--

Finally, the carnival. I'm sorry, but $1 per ticket, and like $3-6 dollars per person, per ride? Can I PLEASE have some of whatever drugs you're on, if you think that's an acceptable price? 

Also, please try putting in some fun carnival games. I don't feel like seeing 8... (yes EIGHT) booths of Balloon Pop... 2-3 shooting gallery games, and NO Skee-Ball. Ya wonder why no one's playing the games? Maybe because they've seen 7 other booths with them in less than a football field's distance? Just a thought.

Came for the fall '14 show and left after half an hour, but blamed that on the scorching Vegas heat wilting all the food and making things uncomfortable. Heard ads on the radio all week for the spring '15 festivus, figured it'd be cooler in the evening, so decided to give it another shot.

Food was more appealing -- overpriced carny food, nothing gourmet, as to be expected, but a somewhat impressive variety of options -- and we had an okay time.

BUT: we came mainly because the radio spots (and website, promotional ads, etc.) had all touted the Sunday evening fireworks show. Fireworks were scheduled at 9pm, to be followed by Zowie Bowie at 9:30. The earlier act went long, so we waited. And waited. Then they spent forever trying to get the sound set up for ZB, so...we waited. Finally the closing act came on, about 10 past, and it only took them another five minutes to get everyone's mic plugged in.

We listened for 10-15 minutes, but by then my date was frustrated and ready to go. On the way out we asked one of the security people (who was very friendly and helpful), and found out that the fireworks had been cancelled. (He said it was because they're building a new apartment complex nearby and someone had complained, or something?)

At no point did anyone on-stage make an announcement, warning, or disclaimer. The rest of the feast and show would probably get a 3-star rating, but feeling so disappointed and annoyed knocks off a lot.

Also: my lady was wearing shoes with a bit of a heel; definitely not stilettos, but not flats either. All of the rides -- and, amazingly, the porta-potty restrooms -- were off the tarmac and away across the gravel. She couldn't comfortably cross that with her shoes, so all of that was effectively off-limits. So frustrating!",ddu4rHcDU93mOkM4Haopbg,5,1,1,RWvAWe-Q4ANz89zt01hjng

Honestly  I was all kinds of excited to go as food feasts are abundant in LA and love them. It was in such a small portion of the parking lot that there was too many people there..they over packed it to be comfortable for the space. It was a bitch fit to go through and since theres the entrance fee (was it like $10?) + all the hiked up food vendors it wasn't stacking to much value either. I was out  fighting for a place to even stand to eat so what I did was order, go in another long line and eat in line a few times as I had no other choice, but even then there were so many people bumping into me that I scratched myself with a fork on my face. We finally got a seat eventually, but it was by the stage and was very loud to be right by the speakers that we got up again to find someplace else. 

I didn't do carnival games which I LOVE to do honestly and am good at. I browsed and there was very few in variety and a bit pricey for games and rides. Also at that point, I was unsatisfied with food other than a funnel cake and a italian sausage sandwich which though good I don't think should be like $8-10 (I'm sure they have a bitch of a vendor rate though to pay off)....there was this rotisserie chicken plate that though the chicken was good and the macaroni decent,  the side of rice was spoilt. 

I was planning on going to AYCE or Korean BBQ that night. I should have for having spent about $60-$70 ish on both of us to sample foods. Totally worth it in LA where I enjoy myself, here I just felt sad as this is really it when it comes to festivals and this is overhyped. Sadly, it was once good and really fun. My BF told me of a time when he and his family have gone when he was a kid and had a great time. 

This year they moved to SIlverton Casino. I hope that makes a big difference. I don't think I will be back unless many people say its vastly improved. 

Find me at the GREEK festival this September.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,4,1,7soopAbCgrqklBmqszfjow

The Rio one gets a bump up to two stars for having normal parking instead of the dirt field at the last one. My review is staying the same for the most part as my previous one for this event... overpriced, overpriced, overhyped.... yet, I still keep going. Go figure.

$10 for a crappy knock-off philly cheese steak!!! I wish I wrote down the name of the places I ate from so I would remember never to go to them again. I've eaten microwave cheese steak better than the one there.
$9 sausage and peppers - really good but c'mon... $9!!
$4 italian ice - for a small! it was good though haha

best deal:
$3 for a small bag of Kettle Corn! It was so good that we ate half the bag on the way home.

It shouldn't be a entry fee since your going to play for games, shopping, rides and food? Might as well have to pay to use the damn bathroom too. Just be cautious of the food. A lot of the venders keep the food open and bugs flying around and people sneezing and coughing everywhere. 

One ride might cost you 5 bucks, so they have deals where you can get a bunch of tickets for 35 dollars and some have a all day pass. 

Food is about 5, 10 and 15 dollars. 

Games are 5 dollars and up. 

You'll probably end up paying over 50 dollars for a few hours in this festival. If you have family, then much more of course.

5228686,2017-05-17,4,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"We went to San Gennaro on Saturday evening, and it was a fun experience.

Located at Craig Ranch Park, the San Gennaro Feast is 3 days of food, shopping, and entertainment.  

We had a coupon for $2 off per adult, so our admission was $16. 

I've said before, I'm not a fan of festivals that you have to pay admission, and then pay for food on top of the entry fee. I know most of them are like this these days, but I'm generally not a fan.  
We decided to do SGF this year because it was close to the house, and we found ourselves with a little extra spending money, and in need of a date night.

The event itself is big, and is pretty well organized, layout wise.  Rows of food vendors are separate from the rides, and there are shopping vendors all throughout the place. 

Honestly...I have to admit, while we had a good time and enjoyed ourselves...we won't be going back.

1. The food:  I thought this was an Italian festival...not that I mind having a ton of foods to choose from, but I honestly thought it was going to be more like the Greek Food Fest, and specialize in Italian food.  It didn't.   And to be honest...we didn't have any of the Italian offerings, because everything was ridiculously expensive. 

What we did have was tasty, but it wasn't Italian.  (We went to the Wild Game booth and had a rattlesnake/pheasant sausage and a reindeer sausage.  Both delicious, and not super expensive.)  We also had a funnel cake, which was undercooked and greasy,  and a huge ice cream sundae type thing. (That was great.  Biggest ice cream truck I've ever seen, and totally worth the $7.) 

Everything else we looked at was minimum $10, for not a lot of food.  
I'm sorry, but being a tasting festival...lower your prices for the amount of food you're offering.  
There were places with shrimp and lobster dishes for $15...man, I can go to Smiths and buy 3 pounds of crab for $15.  No thanks.   $18 for a bacon wrapped turkey leg?  Are you serious?

2.  The non-food vendors:  A lot of them were pushy.  I don't mind someone trying to get me to come in and look at their wares, but for crying outloud, stay out of my personal space.  I had a lady come up and stand practically on top of us while we were listening to one of the bands, to tell us to come look at a cable package.  Personal space is a thing, even at a crowded festival.  Also...I really hate that scam MLM businesses like ItWorks (it doesn't) and those ugly LulaRoe leggings places are able to vend at events like this.  Personal pet peeve, I suppose, but I'd rather see the artisan olive oils, handmade soaps, and handmade jewelry, than 2 Lularoe booths.  Also, the guy who was there for DARE was really pushy,  asking outright for money, rather than explaining anything about the program, and seemed really pissed off when we said we weren't able to contribute. Sorry man...we're on a budget, and we came here to eat.  Don't act so put off if I ask for a card or something for later on.  I'd have been happy to do an online donation this weekend after I get paid again, but your attitude and failure to give me a card or contact information has solidified that I won't.  

3. The rides:  50 cents a ticket isn't bad.  It was cheaper than I thought it was going to be...but...some of these rides are just ridiculous.  9 tickets EACH for the Farris wheel?  That was the one ride I had kind of REALLY wanted to do on our little date night, but at $9 for both of us to ride...I'd rather go get another rattlesnake sausage.   The wristband is the way to go, but that's $60 for rides for the two of us.  I'd rather drive to Knott's Berry farm for that kind of money.  

4.  The games:  again...really expensive.  Some of them had signs that kids play till the win something, which is cool.  I really did like that part of it...but...its difficult to appreciate and enjoy things that are priced so high that you have to choose between that and food.  

All in all...I'm glad we went.  We had a nice time just walking around holding hands and people watching.  We seriously considered going into the petting zoo, too...that looked fun.  But will I go back?  No.  Will I recommend it to others?  No.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,9,4,2,Oqrh1JEhogKs5kk-KJyj-Q

5837924,2011-09-14,0,rjZ0L-P1SRLJfiK5epnjYg,"My mate and I just checked out the new Rio rendition of the Las Vegas San Gennaro Feast on its opening day, and other than having great difficulty finding it and a parking spot in a Rio lot, we both pretty much enjoyed the food and entertainment. I thought the Feast was situated behind the Rio, and it was.  But it is not accessible from Valley View Boulevard. The best way to reach it is to enter the Rio and go around the Carnival World Buffet right to the back and out the Rio near Gaylord Indian Restaurant.  Signage is horrible until you reach the back doors of the Rio that lead to the Feast. I needed to ask the security guard manning the Rio Security Desk how to get to the Feast, just as did the person in front of me. 

Once there, the usual sights and smells of a wide array of Italian and other cooking food products were prevalent, with several vendors touting their products as potential patrons walked by. I wanted to try a new food vendor this time--and did--but to my disadvantage. The hand-tossed pizza looked real tasty with cheese melting nicely on slices that were dotted with pepperoni. But the taste of these slices was bitter, and tomato paste was much too dominant an element in the sauce. At least the outfit selling this mediocre stuff is from Northern California, and only sells at fairs and festivals (I checked), so you won't accidentally run into this pizza in the Las Vegas valley. The two pizza slices I ate set me back $8.00. I am going to Biaggio's for lunch later today to get some first-rate pizza to make up for last night's clinkers! 

Much better was the Philly Cheesesteak I bought from an Anthony's booth, as I did last year. I watched it grilled before me. Since I hadn't eaten all day in preparation for the Feast, dressed with self-administered ketchup and packed with small cut up pieces of cooked beef, red and green peppers, white onions, and well-melted Mozzarella Cheese inside a soft 6-inch bun, this $9.00 beauty was worth the high-sounding cost. Diane's Potato Tornado, greasy bent circles of deep-fried potatoes that were a cross between thick potato chips and french fries, also tasted quite good. And, a large-size bag of Cinnamon Roasted Almonds that wasn't that big was steeply priced at $9.00 but offered both of us a nice sweet ending to our dinners. Everything was washed down with very reasonably priced bottles of spring water and Sierra Mist purchased at the Rio's own Cafe Martorano booth. 

We didn't play any games of chance/skill but I saw a huge banana, pig, Bart Simpson, and other stuffed creatures in attendees' hands, so some people were clearly winning major prizes. As in the past, our main focus was on the food and entertainment. 

And, the entertainment we saw was excellent and largely different than what we observed in previous years. Dick Contino, Tony Sacca, and Lena Prima performed once again, but there were also the Motown Divas, Chris Lista from the East Coast, an actor-singer who plays Frank Sinatra in ""The Rat Pack Is Back"" at the Rio, the bird trainer from ""America's Got Talent"" appearing with Danny the Parrot, Deja Vu from South Point, and Kim Styles, who belted out a very nice rendition of Adele's ""Rolling in the Deep."" The Michael T Orchestra that backs up singers was also once again excellent--especially the saxophonist. The fine live entertainment in the Tony Sacca Show that begins at 8:00 p.m. each night of the festival, and changes daily, is worth the $6.00 price of admission (with coupon) alone. 

Uniformed Las Vegas Metro officers were clearly visible, the crowd seemed happy and very mellow, debris on tables was picked up by Feast volunteers very soon after a diner got up to leave, and colorful amusement rides were in full bloom.  We were both glad that we attended yet another Feast.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,1,4,0naHJ5s93Fe-bXG5nHFZJw

First they should really stop labeling and marketing this as some unique Italian food festival. Yes there are some Italian food vendors but don't really expect some special authentic Italian foods. Just call it what it is a fair/carnival with some food vendors stop trying to make it sound like more than what it really is. As most have said they are getting pretty ridiculous with the prices. Just for two people your looking at 50 bucks minimum between the $9 entrance fee each(ridiculous) and a small snack (not even the full meals). Also please stop with the animals it's borderline cruelty. Especially the part where kids ride the ponies.

This year I enjoyed the location of the San Gennaro feast more than the previous year when it was hosted at the Silverton hotel & casino. 

We parked at the Gold Coast hotel & casino, had a few drinks then walked over to the festival. We went around 8pm after the sun went down and it cooled off a bit, it was still booming. I am glad we did not go to the Rio for parking, we could see what a bleeping nightmare that was with all of the cars and parking congestion. No thanks! 

We walked around to take a look at all of the food vendor options before deciding on what we would grub on. That took awhile as it was wall to wall people, just walking through to check out the food vendors was an obstacle. They created the isles too narrow and did not think of the crowd when setting it up. I don't enjoy buying an ice cold beer and having my freaking elbows knocked into spilling my beverage!!! No No No! I don't enjoy in the heat of the desert night walking grinding hips and rubbing backs with strangers. 

Ok...so after the complete challenge of getting your food, where to sit and eat you say? Not enough tables and chairs, we had to search as if on a scavenger hunt to find a spot to sit and eat our food that was growing cold by the second! Ugh...

Ok so on to what we ate...we had many rounds of cold beer from the beer tap truck. Mmmmm so refreshing and cold and I am not even much of a beer drinker. I had three beers just because they were so cold and went well with our grub and the heat. Yeah it was still HOT out at 10pm we were some sweaty mofo's!

We stopped by Taste of Chicago, mmmm yum and so glad we did! We ordered an Italian beef sandwich, paper-thin sliced beef marinated in A JUS served on Italian bread. That was tender and tasty, nice size with lots of meat! We also ordered a pizza puff, mmm yes yum you heard right! A pizza puff! A deep fried pizza pocket like pastry but delicious and loaded with yummy sausage, cheese, marinara, spices. That was a winner! I could have eaten many more of those! Mmmm yum yum yum yes yum I say. Ok so this vendor happens to be a local joint. They are located inside of Lucky's at 7345 S. Jones blvd, LV 89139.

Can't forget dessert! Classic funnel cake sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon did the trick. Was fried perfect, so tasty I was moaning at this point in our venture. It satisfied my need, my want, my craving for something sweet and delectable to embrace my accepting tongue. Mmm yes I needed you and you gave me what I wanted, thank you Mr. Funnel cake!

We happen to sit next to some really cool locals who we could shoot the shit with, was awesome we had a blast talking, laughing and joking it up. Exchanged phone numbers, yeah made another BFF also, yay! 

The music was awesome, enjoyed listening to the live musicians do there thing on stage making us groove!

Only 2 stars, the food is good but overpriced, yes we expect that unfortunately. The crowd control sucked balls and not the kind I usually like to suckle on. They just want our money, it is clear they do not consider the comfort or convenience of us the patrons. We are just a heard of cattle they need to milk and send on our way. The negative outweighed the positive on this event.

In our group the 2 children under the 54 inches so didn't have to pay for them to enter.  I also printed off the online coupon for us  so two adults entered for $5 each. Last I printed of TWO coupons for the $5 off each all pass ride. If you plan to stay to buy the all pass ride.  cuz tickets for a min of 3 per ride and at $1 ticket or I think it was 20 for 26 tickets the $20 pass with coupon makes sense.

I've been to this festival about 3 times, with each time asking myself why I've returned. 

Food is the primary focus obviously, and it's often overpriced, represented by many  local restaraunts, mostly Italian, but other cuisines  too. Depending on when you go, the quality of the food is very inconsistent. It's easy to get food that's cold, bland and overcooked simply because the vendors precook everything. 

They have a carnival/fair as well, to keep the children and younger kids entertained. 

They do have some free shows and live music as well.

Overall, if you've never been to one of these, you're not missing very much, but if you have absolutely nothing to do on one of the nights these are going on, go ahead and give it a try., just don't expect to have an amazing culinary experience.",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,6,0,2,jrANc7htOws9SMZo7dBhlw

The game was simple enough: out of a bunch of slimy rubber duckies in a small basin, you're to pick 2 (out of 3) that have the same letter written at the bottom. There are only 3 letters in all: S (small), M (medium) & L (large). My 1st pick was ""S"". Great.

""Do I need to pick these 2 letters consecutively?"" I asked. It wasn't a tactic, but it seemed to work: it looked like the word ""consecutive"" flew right over her head, & she appeared stunned & contemplative for a while. I may have won, but to this day, I'm still not 100% sure. After picking 3 rubber duckies, I just kept saying, ""Purple cow. I want the purple cow. That 1.""

As the carnie reached for the purple cow, she explained that she kept hitting her head on the rod, & that the cow served as her cushion. ""If I take 1, I gotta put 1 back, know what I mean?"" she said with slurred speech. As for Georgettina, she's gradually turned into a footstool.. True story.

Most of the fare seemed overpriced. We bought a couple of teeny orders of lobster thingies from some food truck. 17 bucks. That was probably not even mostly lobster, but lobster molecules mixed with lobster-like mystery meat & extenders. I really don't know. The funnel cake was good, but nothing extraordinary.",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,3,3,3,Q8F6cWove5VwKTuBvPcaaw

I was under the impression this was an Italian festival so please explain why there was hawaiian food, chinese food, cajun food, mexican food? why not just call it the international food festival instead? the italian food was good. not gonna lie. but after missing it for the last 3 years since moving here, i'm not regretting those past decisions one bit. 

Yes i stole this from my FB review but really, what else can I say. I don't think I'd bring my kids unless I'm in the mood to spend loads of money and fight crowds of people.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,9,3,2,3PH7amEpecREtU_p4yb6uA
