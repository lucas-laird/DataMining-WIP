39436,2011-08-28,0,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"We were in Vegas for four days and we ate breakfast twice at Le Cafe in the Paris hotel.  We first dined here on a Friday morning.  The service was great and the food came out fast.  The food is like American breakfast with a French twist.  My sister-in-law had the french toast and it was very decadent.  I had the baked eggs in marinara sauce, something I had never eaten before, and I enjoyed it.  The thick cut bacon is delicious.

However, we also dined here Saturday morning.  The service was horrible.  It took 20 minutes for the waitress to finally come around and take our order.  The table next to us left because they waited so long.  Once we got our food, it seemed like our waitress forgot about us.  We could not get drink refills and had to chase her down for the check.  The people two tables away who were seated before us were clearly upset and requested their check as soon as they saw the waitress at our table picking ours up for payment.

The food was good Saturday morning also, however, it almost seemed like we were eating a different restaurant.  The potatoes were prepared differently even though we had ordered them the same as before.  Also, the english muffins looked like small pancakes rather than larger fluffy rounds of toast.  I was told later this was because the smaller ones were hand made.  Not sure why they change it up...??

I must mention I had the fried eggs the second day and they were served over pork cakes.  Very delicious, but did not care for the potatoes.

My overall opinion, I will not go back nor would I recommend it to a friend going to Vegas.",CHxrRXVWb6X3mXNOwiE-6w,0,0,2,pfmBp1kpQkZQ-w1f8gVQwA

The salmon was ok, it wasn't as flavored as I like. The grilled steak was good, cooked how I liked it. The mashed potatoes were really good.

54407,2012-01-09,0,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"This place should be called ""Le Cafe lle Bad Service."" Never in my life have I been treated so horribly at a restaurant. My family and I went for lunch at 1 in the afternoon. There was no line and the inside was empty except for 3 other families. We were seated immediately. 

Ten minutes after being seated, a busboy asked us what we'd like to drink. He barely understood our orders, ran around like a headless chicken, then disappeared into the kitchen. We were told our waitress will be over very soon to take our orders. I guess twenty minutes is considered very soon, because that's how long it took. 

After taking our orders, we waited about ten more minutes until my iced-tea arrived. My parents' and brother's drinks were nowhere in sight. After complaining to the manager about the horrible service and informing him that we felt neglected, he simply smirked and replied ""I assure you that you're not being neglected."" Yeah, that REALLY assured us.

I noticed that there were no waiters in sight, and the three families that were seated before us still did not have their drinks or food. One family complained to the manager and left. Finally, the rest of our drinks and our food arrived (we had been seated for a little over an hour now). The food was alright, DEFINITELY not worth the wait at all, and it wasn't even hot. 

My soup came without a spoon so I asked my waitress for one; she said she will bring one right away. Five minutes later she came by our table to check on us, no spoon in sight. Again I asked for a spoon and she went to get one; she came back without a spoon once more! I asked for it one final time, and after a total of 10 minutes of not getting  a spoon I personally walked up to the utility station and took a spoon. Ridiculous! 

DON'T EAT HERE; this place does not deserve your business at all! This was probably the fifth time I have eaten here in the past four years and each time the service seemed to get exponentially worse. This is totally unacceptable especially in Las Vegas where restaurants are extremely competitive.",T7IZZ1kQG48fMZCWy26r9g,0,0,1,RzZRDh0boKR3RUk0uGrD9A
58405,2014-03-27,0,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"My plans needed to change. Wanted a steak for my birthday, but dinner plans took me to a show instead. That left lunch, and the elusive birthday steak... Read the menu at this cafe in the Paris Hotel, and it looked good.  Ordered the Steak Frites, a nice flat steak with french fries, a bearnaise and a bordelaise sauce accompaniment. Also ordered a mixed green salad....

The service was good, attentive, and efficient. The bread came rather late, with nearly frozen butter, but worked around that faux pas.

The salad was really good.

The steak was on the tougher side, but cooked to perfection. It looked like a top sirloin, but semi-sliced before cooking to give it a pattern on top. It was okay, but not what I'd hoped for. The sauces it came with were weak and flavorless. Had to salt and pepper both of them just to get some taste on the steak. The bearnaise sauce was the weakest, and not the classical version. The bordelaise needed the salt the most, but was closest to what you'd expect in a classic French reduction sauce, but tasted jarred, or mass produced...not from the pan my steak was made in.

Overall, the experience was okay, nothing to write home about. And with so many other Vegas options, can't see myself ever returning. I would recommend this place only if hungry, and currently at the Paris Hotel, and you don't mind the casino right there as you eat. Not worth a special trip for.",XX6sfOfklJYA7kzr3lyrTw,0,0,3,sfjR1ZasLmsjAPLsYtAadg

But we still gave it a shot and try, and the food turned out to be delicious to us. We got French onion soup as appetizer, and then prime rib as entree. We chose chocolate layered cake as dessert. We liked all of them. 

The onion soup tasted really good, we liked that they don't put much black pepper (or probably none) to over-power the taste of onion. But if you like black pepper, then probably you won't like it though we liked it. The prime rib was good, it came in good size, they said it was 12 oz and we think so too. It would be even better if they have fresh horseradish, but we were satisfied enough with the quality of prime rib though there was only creamed horseradish. We got to choose 2 sides with the entree. I chose Yukon whipped potato and French fries, while my husband chose baked potato and creamed spinach. I liked the Yukon whipped potato a lot. French fries was over burned though. I didn't make a big deal about it because I had pretty enough to eat already. My husband thought his sides were okay, not bad but not wow either. Both of our rib eyes came out with the correct doneness we asked for. At the end when dessert came, we liked the layered chocolate cake a lot too. I think it is pretty safe to go for the set dinner. We don't know how it would be if we were to order items off the regular menu.  If we go back in the future, we probably will do set dinner again because it was good priced and portion is just right.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,4,A5lKaqNl1Q9nCMwWC8cTFQ
97303,2014-04-12,0,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"As a Las Vegas resident, I generally avoid restaurants on the Las Vegas strip both because local restaurants often offer better value and because of the traffic hassle. However, we needed to meet relatives who were staying at the Paris and had just experienced a 6 hour delayed flight. It seemed only courteous to meet them where they were staying after all of the travelling they had done. 

We made a reservation for seven people for 7:45pm on a Friday night, but apparently not a real busy Friday night. We arrived in three parties and thankfully were seated as we arrived. We ate ""inside"" rather than on the ""outside"" near the casino floor. This was a thankfully quiet place where we could all hear each other. The next plus was that the bread that was served was good chewy bread rolls, and unfortunately, freshly baked good bread is often not served in Las Vegas.

Three of us had the peppercorn steak. One rated it 8 out of 10, I thought the sauce could have been more subtle; the third person liked the sauce. One of us had the French dip and declared it excellent. Two had the duck a la orange; one thought the duck too lean, another liked it. The person who ordered the beef in wine sauce liked it and the person who ordered the omlette said is was okay. Service was good, there was never a need to catch the waiter's eye. 

With one of us ordering an appetizer and no one rushing through dinner, the meal lasted an hour and a quarter. To me, when you get together with relatives from out of town the meal should be a leisurely occasion. I see the speed of service is a constant source of debate in Las Vegas dining. Some people want to get in out quickly, others like myself resent a waiter asking, ""Are you still working on that, sir?"" 

For me the restaurant served its purpose well: A nice quiet place to have a leisurely family meal with no one rushing us and reasonably good food and excellent service.",3b5EsiTkqgdbxPXz7LfBpA,0,0,4,b6jSGs5JTo__1R8vTy0Y6Q

215706,2014-12-04,0,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"""Should Had Known Better Based On Our Waiter's Attitude To Walk Away""

Went there for a late dinner on 11/27/2014 with my husband. As soon as we sat down out on the casino floor, my husband left to take a call. The waiter came by with a rather ""I don't want to be here, but I have to, so deal with it"" attitude. I asked him for his recommendation on their Croque Madame Sandwich was since I had previously had it at the Mom Ami Gabi there at Paris and found it be extremely bad. His response was why did you have it? Well because I normally like them, and it turned out to not be so good. He then said, ""if you didn't like theirs, I am pretty sure you won't like the one from here either, their food is better."" ""Ok, we are off to a good start"" I thought. When my husband returned, he looked tired and hungry, so I did not mentioned the conversation I had with our waiter. 

The waiter came back, and disdainfully took our orders. My husband then mention to me, ""what is wrong with him, looks like he has an attitude and we just sat down to eat, he seems a bit odd."" At this point, I just wanted to eat and go as fast as possible. I had the St. Louis Club and my husband had the Turkey Croissant. Both were less than average. In addition we ordered the Cheese Fondue, it was average at best.

The waiter came by once and asked if we needed more water, my husband said, yes for him. Another 10 minutes went by and my husband decided he would just get the water himself from the waiter station. At this point when he saw my husband headed to get the water he came running and started pouring the water, half of it ended on my husband's plate. He did apologized out of fear my husband would get upset. However, my husband didn't get upset with him; he just brushed it off since we just wanted to leave. At this point, I understood why another couple who was paying their bill when we had just sat down were looking at him in a way like "" what is his problem""? Another sign we should have walked away before ordering. 

So after a very lack luster, unusual, weird, and nuts dinner, we paid the bill and left. After we left I realized I had left my sweater behind so I told my husband I needed to go back. I did and the waiter mockingly pointed in front of the last group of diners that it was inside and to go get it. Of course my husband was not with me at this point, so he was his old mean, weird, crazy self. I went inside picked up the sweater and ran out rather embarrassed. I really meant to go back and speak to management the next day and tell them about our experience, but just ran out of time. If the restaurant's management hires people like him, then I am sure my words would have fallen on deaf ears. Please do not waste your time and money on this place. It is lovely to look at but it is bad to the core in more ways than one.",hFZ9IM1VjG7vSV7UPOidEg,0,0,1,qKzT3edEWSgLTMEDy4z-OA

2 years ago it was great...  Now not so great.

Ate there 2x last week, once because it was good before and the second time i was drunk and needed to eat asap.

1st exp this trip,  food was a little cold coming out and the server didn't really care to help us split the tab, he figured with a party of 8 he would bank on the auto tip, even though most of us tip better than that. 

Got the french dip, tasted good, but the bread was hard.  Everything else was ok, except the wait time of almost 50 minutes for food.  I shook that off as party of 8 and was taking some time.

Two days later, 3 am I am back and order the dip again, it's the only thing I have had there so i rolled with it. 

1 hr and 20 minutes later still no food or refil.  I got the mgr and had a chat, I also had a togo order for my wife which I asked for when Im about to leave.  They bring a to-go order out in a bag and say it's my wifes omlet.  That omlet sits on the edge of the table till our food is brought out and he asked my friend why isn't she eating her omlet, at this point we were stunned, he had said it was the to-go and now he is saying it was the omlet for my friend.  

The mgr came back out and got into this dude big time and said all the omlets would be free, a new one would be re-made to go and for my friend. 

30 minutes goes by and the mgr walks up, she says and I quote.

""we suck, and the whole bill is on me""  I said thanks but we still need food....  I mentioned that at the build an omlet station at most buffett's they only take 3 minutes to make not 30+.

They no longer have French toast on the menu. The patio seating is still there but they reduced it to make room for a Chinese restaurant.

We skipped them for breakfast (no French toast) but went for lunch one day. We both had the French onion soup and salmon dishes.

It was definitely a giant miss for me.  After being seated and waiting for so long, I was about to just leave when the waiter called out on his way from the next table that he would right there.  After another long wait, he finally showed up. When asked about any of the menu items, he just looked confused.  When ordering a wine with dinner he had to put his finger on the page and leave with the wine list. Of course during this time, we had to specifically ask for water to drink be brought to the table. 

For the appetizers, I had the French Onion Soup (not bad), while my companion had the Tomato Salad which consisted three slices of tomato with baby sprigs and a dressing. Hardly enough to be considered a salad. 

When the entrees arrived. They both looked, felt and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long. My prime rib was cold as well as my ""whipped"" (mashed) potatoes. My companion had the club sandwich with rosemary pomme frittes (French Fries). Its hard to mess up a club sandwich, but the fries were cold, limp and greasy.  EVERYTHING had to be sent back to the kitchen!  My meal came out a second time and it was correct. My companions pomme frittes came out in the same state as the first attempt. She just gave up and simply said ""never mind"" to the fries. 

During the course of the meal our drinks ran low and eventually empty. My companion had to go to the hostess stand and ask if the manager could stop by our table with some water. 

When Mark the manager showed up, we conveyed our experiences with Rey the waiter.  He of course politely apologized. And offered to ""adjust"" the bill, which Rey promptly delivered. Rey seemed to have forgotten the the special I ordered came with dessert, so I had to remind him.  Of course coffee wasn't offered so I had to flag Rey down for som coffee. When we got our coffee, Rey was distracted by something else yet again and just put his carafe on the table in front of me like we were at an Ihop.  Since we ordered coffee, he had to add that to the bill and we had to flag him down yet again.

The soup was a creamy chicken vegetable which reminded me of Thanksgiving, and it would have been pretty good had it not been luke-warm.  The filet mignon came with a hollandaise sauce, roasted potatoes and some steamed asparagus and green beans.  The filet had nice grill marks, which inspired some hope, but it was over-cooked, under-seasoned, and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.  The potatoes were pretty tasty, but the veggies were under-seasoned as well.

We also ordered some mushroom crepes.  These were the best thing about the meal, but not by far, and I am not exactly a crepe expert.  They tasted similar to the soup to me.  Perhaps some cross-pollination going on?

The proximity to our hotel elevators and a friendly (albeit somewhat inattentive) waiter helped redeem some value on the experience, but all-in-all, I think I could have executed the meal better in my own kitchen.

510337,2010-09-09,0,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"I ate here a couple weeks ago and thought the food was pretty great, so I was surprised at all of the negative reviews it got. However, I remembered that I ate here:
-At 4am
-while absolutely starving
-and maybe a bit intoxicated (just a little though, honestly)

So, that might have hindered my perception. However, I'm going to go ahead and review this place anyway. I promise it's not too inaccurate as I ate here with two other friends who ordered the exact same thing I did and we all raved about it afterwards.

Logistics/Price: It's open 24/7, which is its best advantage. It is also conveniently located about 40 feet from the hotel elevators leading up to the rooms, so if you're already staying in Paris, this is a good place to satisfy some late-night/early morning cravings. The prices during the day are kind of expensive for only average-tasting food, but its late night menu is not bad and sometimes they have certain $8 specials that could be worth it (check the menu right outside the restaurant to see). They also have a random Chinese menu as well filled with basic Americanized Chinese fare (chow mein, fried rice, orange chicken, etc) that ends at 3am but I wouldn't recommend that unless you're really desperate.

Ambience: The cafe is an interesting one right in the Paris hotel. It is not in an actual building at all (no roofs or walls) but is instead in a patio-like area in the corner of the casino, seated in front of the hotel's backdrop of buildings made to look like the quaint establishments in Paris. It literally just looks like someone decided to section off a small corner of the casino and set up some tables and chairs. Despite this however, it doesn't actually look that bad, and is kind of an interesting set up - great for people-watching. 

Service: From the one time I've been here, I had great service, though  it was at 4am. We were seated immediately and our waitress was helpful, very nice and extremely prompt. We got our food within 15 minutes. 

Food: I ate here with 2 other guys and we all decided to order the French Dip - a roast beef sandwich on French baguettes served with Au Jus for about $8-12 (I can't recall the actual price at the moment, but am positive it was in that range). All three of us thought it was delicious. The roast beef was tender and flavorful and the Au Jus was steaming hot and served in a huge bowl - very generous amount. The bread was great, not too hard or chewy, and did not overpower the roast beef. I don't believe there was much else in the actual sandwich though - just roast beef and melted cheese, but from what I recall it was great as is. I actually didn't finish mine and took half of it to go, which I ate the next morning at 5pm and it was still very good (and unrefrigerated too).

My friend also ordered a Creme Brulee for about $7 and I thought it was fantastic. It was just the right amount of sweetness and felt like it melted in my mouth. Once again though, please keep in mind this was at 4 in the morning while exhausted and starving.

Verdict: A good place for very, very late-night meals - decent food at decent prices. However, only eat here IF you are either already at the hotel, are staying at the hotel, or are desperate for extremely late night food and are already close by. This is not a place to go out of your way to get to (even if out of your way means walking 600 feet up the strip). .",eEQV1KZlmO3yZfnxxYIYcQ,0,0,3,LrrZOQnQHQFLR8mezuS29A

We come here for the creme brûlée. The service in the middle of the day isn't bad we got the bread and water within 5mins of being seated.

Duck crepe was good and really filling probably should've split it. I've had poor service here before but this time the waiters were present, friendly and attentive. The food isn't cheap but not bad if you order with the theme of the place.

I ordered the fruit platter and bacon strips with a coffee.  Waiter never brought half&half even though I requested 3 times, each time he walked by to be exact.  Finally I had to ask a bus-boy for it, whom brought it promptly.  
The waiter had no idea what most of the items on the menu were.  My cousin asked about the beignets, he said he wasn't sure how they were.

Cold ones, to be exact, with the center of the pastries still a bit uncooked.  No beignets, not once.  Coffee was cold, my bacon was cold.  Just all in all, food wasn't the best.

Terrible, terrible, awful, horrible.

I understand that their main demographic are gambling, intoxicated people. I also understand that they're not catering to repeat customers because Las Vegas is a destination. But even so, there is no excuse for the dinner we had there over Labor Day weekend.

Bad food: French onion soup was a black, burnt piece of bread sitting in room temperature, flavorless broth. Barely any liquid. Scampi linguine had obviously frozen, expired shrimp and tasteless noodles. 

Worse service: When we asked for a table for four, the middle-aged hostess stared blankly past us for about thirty seconds (it wasn't busy, she was daydreaming) before sighing, gathering four menus, and dragging her feet to lead us to a table. We sat for ten minutes without service. Once our waters finally arrived, they were never refilled throughout the course of the evening. We requested bread before the meal. It came after our entrees had arrived. The sides with the burgers weren't what was ordered. Our server disappeared and ignored us until it was time to drop the check. Didn't clear our plates. 

The worst part of the experience was the very end. AFTER we had already paid with credit cards, the server (who had been missing in action all night) stood directly over us, watching us write our tips to see what we would write. I know that perhaps servers need to hover when people haven't paid yet since it's Vegas and dine and dashing is probably frequent, but we had already paid! I had barely put the pen down before she was pulling the check presenter out of my hands. Completely rude and inexcusable. 

If she had given us even fair service, she wouldn't have felt like she had to supervise our tip writing like a hawk in order to guilt trip us into 18%. She didn't get it anyway.

928293,2013-04-06,0,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"Le Café Ile St. Louis is located in the Paris hotel adjacent to its casino.  The kitchen is open daily from 6:00 a.m. to ll:00 p.m. and the bar 24 hours.  It is very nicely designed and decorated to imitate a Parisian bistro with an ""outdoor"" patio.   

My wife and I recently breakfasted there on a weekday morning.  The dining areas were filled less than 50% capacity, and we were seated immediately in the patio next to the brass perimeter railing that afforded us a good view of the restaurant and the casino. 

My wife ordered an omelet with mascarpone with a side of sausage, and I chose scrambled eggs and bacon with fingerling potatoes.  After a very long wait, our food arrived without the sausage.  Our waiter said the sausage was on its way and then he disappeared.  We started to eat, and after a very lengthy period of time I spotted our waiter heading our way with covered dishes.  I thought that one contained the sausage, however, he breezed past our table without a word and served a party next to us who had been seated well after us.  Before I could get his attention, he disappeared again.  We were just about finished with our food when our waiter reappeared.  I flagged him down and asked what happened to the sausage.  Without offering any regrets or apology whatsoever, he assumed an attitude of indifference and merely said that there was a mix-up in the kitchen.  He was then about to walk away, but I stopped him and stated that I wanted the cost of my wife's breakfast taken off the bill.  When the bill arrived, we were not charged for my wife's meal and nothing further was spoken between our waiter and me.  As to the quality of the food we did have, my wife's omelet was average.  It was the same for my food except the potatoes were very greasy and went mostly untouched.

Due to the wholly unprofessional service as well as the mediocre quality of the food, I strongly suggest passing on Le Café Ile St. Louis.",jJmAqgOflbx57NHjuLdQPQ,1,1,1,03_dfFpIcL7O8j389cA7Cw

2. They sure didn't have enough waiters. Once we were seated, the service was very slow.
3. Food came slow. They had to give us bread to keep us entertained. But the french rolls were stale and hard. I could have knocked someone out with those things.
4. Finally got my chicken sandwich. They left the buns open, which was good, so I was able to see the chicken breast inside. The chicken was burned and small. It tasted bitter (from the burn) and dull. So I tried other stuff that came with the sandwich. That one slice of tomato wasn't bad. Lettuce tasted bitter too. Pickle was edible. Buns were just boring buns. I was so starving (having late dinner and long wait) at that time, I decided to just eat everything that was edible - tomato and pickle. At the end, the busboy came over and took my plate, without asking me whether I was done or about the food even though I left all the main ingrediants on the place. Of course, they charged me the full price for my dish, which was already expensive compared to a normal cafe. What a rip off! And it totally ruined my night. My stomach was left cold and empty.

The prices were pretty outlandish, to be honest. An omelet was $11.99 and asking for egg-whites or the egg substitute was another $0.99 on top of that. Sure there were a mess of choices you could have, but you could only choose three before they charged you more. Even for Las Vegas, this was a little expensive.

The good: The food was OK but not great. We were seated relatively quickly even though there was a line.

The bad: The service was pretty horrible. It took them a while just to take our order. We finished our drinks well before breakfast arrived and nobody came by to offer any refills or to check on us. After a long wait, food did show up. They got my order wrong, however, so that required some fixing.

Once we'd eaten, they brought the check, but didn't give us a pen to sign anything with.

Turns out they hadn't opened for lunch yet but it was only a 15 minute wait, not too bad.

After being seated, we were greeted by the most cheerful waiter I have ever met. I'm 97% sure his name was Dennis. I ordered the Salmon Burger, my mom got the Foie Gras Burger, Dad and brother ordered Beef Bourguignon, other brother got Steak Frites. As we were waiting, we were given bread. It was crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, my dad liked it so much he asked for more.
I admit the wait for food was very long but rather than just being left at the table, Dennis was updating us very often and cracking jokes with us. 

I have to say that even though it's not very French, I enjoyed my salmon burger. It was tender and not the least bit dry. The dill mayo was on point. My moms Foie Gras burger was delicious, I've never thought of putting a slice of apple in a burger before but it was genius. The Beef Bourguignon was super tender and savory but my brother's Steak Frites was just alright.
The dishes that stood out the most out of this meal were my the Foie Gras Burger and the Beef Bourguignon.

1708656,2014-01-12,0,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"I am surprised by the binary ""love it"" or ""hate it"" trend in Yelp reviews for this place.

Here are the important facts:

1)  This place is not particularly ""French,"" despite the name and location.  Basically, this is a traditional American restaurant.
2)  The food is functional, but unlikely to inspire awe.  
3)  The physical environment is pleasant, though a trifle silly.  The Paris hotel/casino creates an internal design motif of a pretend French city street, with fake trees and shrubs, and a fake sky painted on the ceiling.  Hence, Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis has an ""inside"" seating area, and an ""outside"" seating area, under the fake sky, where one can people watch those passing in the ""street.""  Be advised, however, that at night a band starts up at another venue down the ""street,"" and the noise carries over to the St.Louis, making conversation more difficult.
4)  One of the consistent gripes in the Yelp reviews is slow service.  Our waitress, Ofelia, was the opposite -- exceedingly speedy, frequently checking on us, friendly, happy, cheerful to accede to any request.

For our dinner, I ordered the $39 pre-fixe menu, opting for the tomato salad, the filet mignon, and the cheesecake.

The serving sizes in the pre-fixe menu are markedly smaller than their a la carte counterparts.  As at least one other remarked, the tomato salad is literally 3 small slices of tomato (2 red, 1 yellow) with some clover-like greens on them.  Tasty, but tiny.  The filet was less than half the size of the filet that came with my date's steak au poive; furthermore the medium and medium rare cooking temperatures we had requested for each were both underdone.  Both steaks were a bit fattier than is ideal, and the flavor was good but not great.  

The exception to the ""smaller"" rule came at desert - our slice of cheesecake was so huge that the two of us could barely finish half of it.  

So, who should eat at Cafe Ile St. Louis?  Someone who knows they are not getting anything special, who wants a basic meal for a slightly elevated price, at a location that is conveniently nearby.  Don't expect to love it, nor to hate it.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,0,0,3,OZVzo8YDKU69u-7LS5NlbA

After being seated, we waited about 15 minutes until we were approached by a busboy who took our drink order. He assured us that our waitress would soon come and take our order, yet it took about 20 minutes more (a conservative estimate) for the waitress to show up. Meanwhile, our drinks were MIA, so I asked to see the manager.

 What a spit in the face it was when, 10 minutes later, a disgruntled gentleman (Mr. Manager) approached our table, and unapologetically told us to be more patient. When I told him that we were being neglected, he responded with ""what do you want me to do about it?"" then proceeded to walk away, mumbling insults under his breath. 40 minutes later our food came, tasty but nothing special. 

The management at this establishment need to understand that their customers are not cattle, nor are we fools. Shame on you Mr. Manager for treating us so rudely. I will never return here for a meal, and neither should you, unless your looking for a way to kill 2 hours while you're starving.",xAHf6IC8N29YqPMjU1RIXw,2,0,1,RK662-JH2zp0jW5JxJqM2w

The cafe has seating that lets you have a complete view of the casino, so people watching is a must. The menu does not have that many French options besides crepes; they have mostly steak and eggs, omelette dishes, etc.

I had the eggs benedict ($17), which came with canadian bacon and potatoes. The potatoes were well seasoned, but could have been crispier. I'm not a huge fan of hollandaise sauce (all that butter, no thank you), so I wasn't pleased when my eggs were drowned in it. I loved how the English muffin tasted more like a biscuit, since it was dense and savory. Portions were really good and everyone was stuffed after leaving. We also shared a croissant, which wasn't anything special in my opinion and not worth $6.

I didn't notice that my food was cold or that service was slow. The line to get in at 10 AM was about a ten minute wait. Price is a bit expensive, so if you wanted to eat at Paris, I would recommend the creperie.",57a4rVQ2Po6csI7VxBEjGA,0,0,4,UaqO6ZNjcVehn0gnNSIdhQ

first off - it took 15 minutes for someone to take our order.

then it took another 20 minutes to get the food 

we were hungry.
scratch that - at this point, we were ravenous.

my friend wolfed her benedict - which looked seriously underwhelming from across the table... the only little flair was the dash of paprika over the holondaise blanket.

the BLT was rather sad... the lettuce was limp - the tomatoes were mealy. at least they didn't mess up the sourdough & bacon.   i only ate half and wanted a box for the second half which again took forever to get... 

the cole-slaw was disgusting - i used to HATE cole slaw - but i've had good ones lately... so i dropped my guard... this slaw reminded me why i used to hate cole slaw.

it took us 5 minutes to finish eating our meals.
 
we were waiting another 10 minutes for anyone to ask how we were doing or even notice we were done & waiting... for the bill (and a box)

the only thing prompt about the service was when the server was returning us our change after we paid the bill.

On top of that, it looks like they didn't bother to fully staff it so a good number of the tables were unused and many that were being used stay uncleaned. We waited in line for about a hour, partially because they were letting all the Platinum and Diamond members in before everyone else. After a hour in line we were near the front when a group stormed out of the restaurant and told everyone in line to go elsewhere since they had waited 45 minutes for their food and were leaving since they had still not gotten it. This caused everyone in front of us to leave so we ended up at the front of the line, although we were still not seated since there were still Platinum and Diamond members waiting in the express line.

The service needs improvement. Our waiter was impatient. He tried to be polite (point! thank you!) but his mannerisms implored discomfort. 

The food failed to be spectacular. There were two special dinner options, and we each got one. Variety to taste everything, right?

This time we were staying at the Paris so it was  even easier but it's an expensive place and not necessarily convenient as everyday food. The cafe is easy and fast. It's really like a French cafe feel. I guess you get different a different waiter all the time and your experience will vary. 

I love the ""Croque Madame"" it's a French hot sandwich made of soft bread cheese and ham. That alone is the ""Croque Monsieur"". Topped it with a sunny side up egg and it's called ""Croque Madame"". I tried it twice and really loved it. I am French and I am always very skeptical to eat so called ""French"" food. 
The croc as we call it is very soft. I like the bread used. Not your usual toast bread! It's thicker and very soft. If you know Croque Madame you need to try this one. 

I also had Napoleon. Which we called Mille feuilles. It's a bit different cream inside. Usually it's made of custard and not whip cream.  It was not too sweet so I liked it. 

The chocolate mousse was really good.

I've been here probably six times already as it's within the Paris hotel and easy when you're staying here. So this review isn't after one bad experience.

GOOD: the food is good but not great. Granted all I've had was breakfast but the food is the only reason I have returned. The initial sitting is good as there are a few people who walk around getting drinks and coffee. They are prompt, kind, and have coffee and cream in hand. That is where the good ends

BAD: the service is extremely SLOW. Every time I have been it's taken on average 5-10 mins just to get someone to say hello. An ""I'll be right with you"" goes a long way. I've been a server in my younger years. I know how it works. They are polite, never have had an argument there, but the lack of attention is obvious. When it comes to the check half of them are MIA while the other half present it in a timely manner.

Paris, France (as in the city-comma-country that I visited last Summer) on the other hand, had a tough texture too and I could chew it and not be afraid of damaging my teeth.  As for the flavors, Le Cafe Ile St Louis was definitely Americanized since it was loaded with meat.  Good value for my meal, but for about the same price in Euro, the smaller ham and cheese baguette sandwiches I got in Paris, France (from several gas stations no less!) had less meat and more flavors in it that burst out allowing me to taste all the ingredients combined in all its glorious simplicity as if I were to eat it for the first time.

This is really the only negative review I have for food establishments our whole 5 days in Vegas, so that is pretty good.

We had lunch here today. I ordered French Onion Soup and a Caprese salad. The man had a French Dip with French fries. 

The soup was ok. Broth was a bit off tasting but we couldn't pin point why. The caprese salad was awful. So bad that we both agreed to not eat more and to send it back. It was served with both red and yellow tomatoes and only 3 slices of mozzerella. Kind of stingy for this kind of salad, but it was the tomatoes that killed the dish. They were not ripe and they were so cold they were hardly edible even if some of them would have been ripe. The sandwich was cafeteria fare at best, but what clinched this place as going on my shit list was the service. 

I have a long list of jobs I have held in my time. I will not go through the list here, but know that jobs that revolve around food and customer service are on said list. This being said, our waiter did not come back until we were blatantly waiting for the bill/some acknowledgement. When I told our waiter the salad was ""not good because the tomatoes were not ripe"", he told me ""the salad does not come with cooked tomatoes"". I told him he was not understanding what I was saying, that I was saying that the tomatoes were ""NOT RIPE"", he then told me ""well, that is how this salad comes"". I told him not to argue with the customer and to take the salad off of our bill. Needless to say, this was a first for me. I totally stiffed him on any kind of tip what-so-ever and a little part of me wished I could have skipped out on the whole bill all together.

3008434,2012-12-05,3,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"While perusing the 'streets' of Paris hotel we stopped in front of Le Cafe and the place looked poppin so we decided to stop and look at the menu as well as refer back to trusty Yelp.  The menu options looked pretty okay as well as affordable, but the reviews on Yelp complained about the service.  Usually I steer clear from places with horrible ratings on their customer service, but we realized we'd never eat if we didn't just choose a place to eat at already so Le Cafe it was. 

Right from the get-go the lady serving as the hostess up front was just rude, short and had no business being the first person any patron would have to cross before dining here.  Seriously, take the stick out of your ass.  So we wait and wait for a table when while passing the restaurant we had seen so many open tables for us to be seated at.  Then a group of older ladies come over showing their little card or something and they bypassed the line and were seated even though they just barely walked up 5 seconds ago.  10 minutes later we're taken to our table and it's filthy.  Trash from the previous diners were still on the table and the dickhead hostess just starts brushing off crumbs on the table cloth, um okay what about the food stains?  What are you going to suck those off or something?  So when my gf asks if we can have a table in the other patio since it has so many open tables the biatch WITH attitude asks if we want to wait.  Oh excuse me, how rude of us to not find the dirty ass table you made us wait for acceptable.  Right after that another lady brings over a fresh table cloth... okay 1/2 star for that.  

Ordering and waiter service was a nightmare.  It was a total and complete joke, I think I actually even started laughing in the middle of it all just because it was so shitty.  It took forever to get the waiter to take our orders and a day to get some bread & butter like the group who had arrived & ordered AFTER us received.  When I tried to flag the waiter, then just any waiter as I seemed to have been invisible to all the muthafuggin service people at this joint for some bread, the waiter literally kept walking away from me telling me while pointing at our waiter who was ignoring us the entire time that we needed to ask him instead.  Are you freaking kidding me???

Knowing we had a night of clubbing in tight dresses awaiting us we decided to go for their soup & salad combo and an order of some frites.  I chose the french onion soup with their frise with lardon salad, while the buddy got chicken noodle soup with caesar salad.  Portions were good, taste was subpar at best.  The instant noodles we had in our hotel room tasted better than the soups set before us.  My salad was boring and tasteless while the best part of my friend's caesar salad was the crouton and Albertson's deli prepackaged caesar salad's croutons taste better.  We never got our frites, which was fine with us as we could tell from the food we had already tasted we weren't going to miss out on much.  By the end of the meal we just wanted to get the f*ck out of there, but once again it was nearly impossible getting our waiter to pay attention to us.  Even those ladies who bypassed the line and were seated before us in the beginning were starting to complain about the horridness of Le Cafe's service.  And of course, those ladies received service before us once a-f*cking-gain.  

When we finally got some service I mentioned that they never brought us our frites so they needed to remove it from our bill.  Then the waiting game once again ensued for the actual bill, and what do we see when we finally get the bill?  The charge for the frites.  Like wow, are you guys just playing some nasty ass sick joke on us?  MTV's Boiling Point is that you??? 

My buddy catching glimpse of the manager quickly got his attention and just went to town on all the bullshit we had to put up including the disgusting food.  He tried to remedy the situation by offering us a dessert on the house which we responded to by giving him our does-it-look-like-we-want-to-waste-another-fuggin-second-here-at-this-shit-hole look and telling him we just wanted to get out of here.  He came back with the new bill in which he comped us for one of the soup & salad combos and removed the never received frites.  Another 1/2 star for the manager, but really he should have comped the whole meal because I would not eat here even for free.  Upon paying and leaving I did something I never do, left no tip, at least no monetary tip... just a written tip.  A not-so-nice one at that.

Our other companions also mentioned their fries were cold. My other friend who ordered the Foie Gras Burger said he wasn't too happy with his burger patty and his fries were also cold. 

Environment/Ambiance: The cafe really added to the Paris theme of the hotel. There was a lot of seating indoor and even in the outdoor aspect part of the cafe. We requested there to be seated outdoors. Because the restaurant is part of the casino floor, it tends to be on the louder side. What made it even louder was that they were playing the World Cup on various televisions around the casino, including the restaurant. 

Service: For a restaurant on the strip, I expected better. When we were seated we waited a long time for someone to even offer us drinks. We noticed that although our table of five was in the middle of the outdoor seating area, no one could figure out who was waiting our table. We saw numerous times when the servers, hostess, and what looked like the manager kept talking about our table. We watched as other smaller tables were seated and attended to quickly. I was particularly hungry this day and I was not in the mood to be ignored especially when there were so many people around us enjoying their dining experience. It almost came to the point where we were looking for a manager to complain to. To our dismay, most of the workers around us were staring at the television to watch the game. I was particularly annoyed at the fact that we still had not been even asked about our drinks. One of the hostesses came out and apologized and said our server was coming out shortly...which was completely incorrect. By the time our server arrived, she seemed way too distracted to even welcome us to the restaurant. I was appalled when she came to the table and said ""Hello, I'll be your server today"" and then immediately walked away from the table to start collecting checks. Things like this happened with this particular server a few times. By the time our food was eventually served, another waitress took over our table. We had no idea that they switched servers on us. I'm not sure when this took place, but it may have had something to do with our food being pretty cold. I don't know if someone forgot to run our food, but at this point I was already very unhappy with our overall experience.

Tips: I honestly have nothing good to say about this dining experience. Sure, this was a restaurant on the strip, and it looks like a good place to dine, but the service aspect really killed it. I'm pretty sure I won't be dining here ever again.",3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,10,5,1,nK4VVnTkw3wPKa7Xn24hRw
3109907,2012-09-10,0,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"I stayed at the Paris Hotel over the Labor Day weekend. After we checked in and unpacked, we were jonesin' for some grub and this was the first restaurant we saw in the lobby. The menu was basic but attempted a pseudo French flair to make it appear as though it was a step above a run-of-the-mill restaurant. But the location being situated smack dab in the middle of a noisy, heavily trafficked lobby, and the quality of food did little to convince me. 

I had the seared tuna salad. The tuna was absolutely overcooked and the potatoes were very large and seemed shoved into the salad along with the unruly green beans. The glass of Riesling was ok. Granted, the service was adequate and they do make an effort to capture the look of a Parisian cafe (blue painted skies and random Parisian decor) but the hectic atmosphere overshadows all. This is great for a quick and somewhat inexpensive bite but certainly not the creme de la creme of Vegas' culinary offerings.",YGK0hNTDD-eLXSA0ZdqYrQ,0,0,3,Ha_nDlE4kBET2JL6yGJ-wA

We went for breakfast and approached the hostess stand and stood there for a minute while the hostess carried on a conversation with one of the casino maintenance workers. The hostess then looked at us (no greeting) and told us it would be another few minutes before a table for two was ready. She then went back to her conversation with the maintenance worker. I stared at her for about 4 minutes until she was done with her conversation, and then, guess what? Our table was ready! I thought someone was playing a joke on me, not to mention there were a bunch of open tables in the restaurant. By the time she was done with her conversation, there were about 8 other people waiting in the line behind us to be seated.

Overall, the food wasn't what I was expecting. I have a pretty simple definition of a ""breakfast sandwich"": typically, meat, egg, cheese, etc between two pieces of bread that I can pick up with my hands. If that is not what is being served, I would appreciate a heads up or detail on the menu. When I ordered my sandwich, I asked for no mornay sauce and the waiter said that wasn't possible, so i'm guessing they are pre-made. Anyway, what was served to us was more like a casserole that you had to eat with a knife and fork than a sandwich. The ham and mornay sauce were between two thick pieces of brioche and the bread was topped with a sunny side up egg....again, not a sandwich. I had to scrape off the egg (im not a raw-yolk person) and probably only ate about half of what was there.

I would recommend going somewhere else for breakfast. There are so many options in Vegas...even the little bakery 10 feet from the entrance to the Café looked like a better option.

It is really a hit or miss.  In a previous trip here (a LONG time ago), I found the food to be amazingly delicious, but this time - not so much.  I ordered the Chef Special: Filet Mignon with a bunch of other stuff attached to it.  It was definitely NOT what I expected. As it turns out, they were filet mignon pieces, not a full on steak, and the vegetables were tasteless.  

The customer service is okay.  Servers are nice enough, but there were times when I felt a bit rushed.  I HATE being rushed when it comes to my food.  That was a boo on them, but considering my aunt teased our waiter about his name, we'll just call it even.

Overall, it really is a last resort.  When it's 11pm and you're hungry, your options are pretty limited...and when you don't want to travel far because of the cold weather outside (as was the case for me), you deal with what you have.  I would have given it 2 stars, but the time before that was a 4 star, so we're averaging it out. :\",hnhs-uzv_eoE6Pq8nXyufA,0,0,3,weCopHvmqmfD0oCVDyFeig

On the outside it looks and might even feel like a place to sit and chat while sipping a cappuccino, but being that it's open 24 hours and just heels away from the noisy casino floor of Paris Las Vegas, it's really just a diner.

Every casino has a diner and due to the nature of Vegas, they're typically the most popular places to eat at all hours of the day. Le Cafe is somewhere in the middle of the diner spectrum, neither exceptional nor completely downtrodden, offering a typical menu of American food and faux-French food.

Something I always found decent was their breakfast food. Sausage links, tasty omelettes, and hash browns was a meal they could whip up quickly and rather decently. Some of their sandwiches (namely the French dip) were passable for a solid lunch time option and some of the usual baked pastries that were done daily.

Having sampled lots of baguette combos, crepes, French onion soup, I just avoid the French items on their menu completely. Most all I've had were mediocre, uninspiring, and overpriced. This is no surprise for any casino cafe / diner establishment, but it's like going to a Japanese place only to find out the burger tastes better than soba / udon / ramen. As a result, some of my colleagues during my time here would commonly refer to this place as, ""Le Crap.""

But I am not much of a hater. Paris already is plagued with subpar eateries and most of them are closed before 11pm, which leaves the late night goers few options to enjoy. The key to these types of places is embracing what they do best, which for me was almost always breakfast. Service was for the most part pleasant always and the prices were casino worthy, but thankfully this kind of food is the easiest to comp with player points.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,4,4,3,tA70umQqQjSMLMnhJ-b9Rg

The cafe facade and the dining room do indeed remind you of old Paris, but the ""patio"" reminds you of that time you forgot to hit soft 17 against the dealer's 8.

The steak came with a baked potato, but the waiter was happy to replace the baked potato with some mashed potatoes.  I got some vegetables on the plate, too.  My friend ordered their ""early bird"" special - filet Mignon medallions with pommes frites for only $12.99.  If I hadn't been so hungry and if I had actually liked filet, I would have totally ordered that.  What a deal.

Our entrees arrived 15 minutes later.  Her filet was indeed rare and drenched in sauce.  My prime rib was huge!  I know what a 20 oz prime rib looks like, and that was no 20 oz. steak.  The quality of the meat was definitely above average, but it was slightly overcooked.  It was a good steak, even though it was prepared medium.  I thought about sending it back, but decided against making a scene.  I was having a good time, and the steak was darn good.  The mashed potatoes and the vegetables were pretty dull and lacked flavor, seasoning and salt.

When we were done with our meal, it took us another 15 minutes to flag down our waiter.  He seemed to have gone on a break, and the other waiters had absolutely no interest in helping us.  In fact, they chose to do the easiest thing and just ignore us altogether.

the good:
1. the first bite of my triple decker sandwich since i was starving. after a while it just tasted like any other club sandwich ive had. but i did think it was cool there was a sword toothpick to keep my sandwich together.
2. the waiter was always cheerful.
3. split checks

the average:
the french fries. they would have been much better if they were hot.

the bad:
1. there was line outside even though the restaurant was half full. this is as optimistic as i will be.
2. the service. had to flag down the waiter to order food. if you have us waiting out there im sure we'll be ready to order by the time we sit down. also took forever to get our food.
3. must ask for bread if you are ordering sandwiches/burgers. for the record the bread is ok. would have been better if they were warm.

Where do I start? We waited 20-25 minutes to get in for breakfast. It was the WORST service and food I have had in a long  time, and EXTREMELY overpriced (particularly considering the awful food and awful service).  My husband and I got mimosas (why not? we are on vacation) and they were $9 each.  We expected a large wine glass for our $9.  Instead, we received the smallest, tiniest champagne glass I have ever see.  It was a shot of champagne for $9. No thanks. I'll pass.  

Then my husband and I got the eggs Benedict to eat.  He got the traditional and I got their special one.  All of the eggs were overcooked, 2 didn't even run out when you broke them open.  They were basically hard boiled eggs.  The sauce over them was tasteless and cold.  Everything, in fact, was cold and unseasoned.  It was awful.  

The service through the entire meal was awful but when we tried to pay the bill, we were ignored for at least 20 minutes.   We almost walked out and I have never walked out on a check.  When I finally got up to complain and get someone to take our credit card, the manager brought the check but did not ask how the food was or if everything was ok.  Even the management didn't care.

The wings however, were pretty damned good - you could tell they weren't frozen prior.  With the sauce on the side, has a fried crust that made them taste like bite sized pieces of fried chicken.

I thought this was a French cafe, but it is just a regular American diner with super-high prices for what you are getting. $39 for a piece of steak? I don't think so. Here's what we had:

- Steak frites: Dry and small. All the French fries we ordered (came with the burgers and the steak frites were overcooked like they had been frozen and deep-fried)
- American burger: Nothing to report, no special dressing, nothing worth getting again -- we only got this at the behest of my cousin.
- Parisian burger: Better flavor, since there was brie and pear, but not great. Again, no sauce!
- Salmon: This was actually good, but the portion was insanely small. Very buttery and moist. 
- Caesar salad: A bit too salty, but I like the anchovy on the salad
- Roasted half chicken: Super dry and tasteless. 

The food sucked, and that breaks my heart, because I used to eat here all the time with my parents 10 years ago when they took my brother and me to Las Vegas. The food I remember was tasty! Even my parents liked it. 

Service blew. Our server took our order impatiently and didn't check on us. At one point, we wanted to order more food, but after 20 minutes, and asking someone else to find our server twice, we were already done with our meal and didn't want anything else by the time he deigned to show up! 

Also, one of my pet peeves is French grammatical errors at a place that is representing itself to be French. Their 3-course menu is called ""Le American"" -- sigh.

3713812,2012-05-07,1,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"I was reluctant to come here due to reviews about the wait being so long, but it was the closest place to my room and I've always been curious about this restaurant.  Let's just say the reviewers were right.  Once we were seated we waited maybe 15+ minutes just to order drinks, and another 15+ minutes just to order.  After we ordered, we waited another 30 minutes or so just to get our food, and so as you can imagine... we were not very happy and almost wanted to walk out.  No one even informed us that our food or a waitress was coming until we asked.

FORTUNATELY the food we ordered was fantastic.  My egg white omelette was delicious (see picture), as were the grilled veggies on the side.  I got a bite out of my dad's steak and it was nice and tender.

To sum up this review:  If you're down to wait a very long time to seat, order, and be served then you might be satisfied w/ this place.  I'm not sure if the wait is worth it, though, but luckily the quality of my omelette saved this place from me giving it a one star review.   If they had more staff on the floor this place would get a lot more positive reviews.  So yes, proceed w/ caution!",V5OgEqV2uCVCqixZYYUbdg,3,2,3,sZ7ukRAHWycN8bWBYL0MBw

We had Julie was our waitress. She came over asking what we want to drink after bringing waters to us. We said waters are fine and she seemed sour at that reply.

Asked another waitress who had just brought bread to a table that was seated after us if we could get some bread. She said that ""he"" would bring it to us. Not sure which ""he"" she was referring to. Needless to say we waited and waited no bread. After about 30 minutes our food arrived. My friend had asked for her burger well done and avocado on the side. The burger was medium  and the avocado was in it. About 10 minutes after we got our food Julie comes back over and asks us if we have room for dessert while holding the check in her hand. At this point we are only about half way through our meal. She says she will leave the check for us. We finished our meals and as soon as I put my credit card down to pay Julie rushed over to our table asking to run my card for me. Since there were 3 of us we wanted to split the check. Julie split the check but charged one of our cards twice failing to charge the other. Overall the food was good but the service was awful.

The orange juice was ok, but certainly was not fresh squeezed.  I'm thinking it's coming straight out of the minute maid bottle.   The coffee tasted very light though was very efficient, so my wife were actually thinking that they served caffeine water with black coloring.   In other words, it got us all jittery and wiry, but it didn't taste like coffee.  The eggs were cooked rather poorly, the bacon didn't look all that appetizing (didn't try it though), and the chocolate croissant, for it being ""Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis"", was really tragic.

Now had all this been priced at the cost Denny's would have charged us, I'd probably give them 4.5 or 5 stars and wouldn't complain one bit.  Certainly the food I had did not outshine Denny's at all.   But $36 for this (ok ok... $30 + 20% tip, but still!!!)   No, some Parisian's seriously smoking crack on the Ile St Louis if he thinks that this is competitive pricing.

I'll give 'em 3 stars because everything in Vegas has become overprice, but let's just say I'd more likely show a smile than shed a tear if I ever heard that this place went ""Au Revoir!""",jX52sZoojxyYV2viWNyO7A,1,0,3,fFlM79W-x902cRRgNLk6Aw

If there was a way to give this place '0 Stars' I would but sadly there isn't so you'll have to read this little rant of mine. 

Here is the situation. It was late at night (1:00am) and this was one of the few places open in the casino so our group (4 20 somethings) decided to stop searching the Strip for a meal and park it at the next closest table. 

We arrived at this poor excuse for a restaurant and was greeted by quite possibly the worst hostess in the history of life. After I asked for a table for 4 she just looked back at me in such a blank manner I thought I should repeat myself. 

So I did. 

Then after the 2nd go around she sat us down to a table and threw the menus on the table. (lovely) 

After having about 25 mins to go over the menus, the 'garcon' arrived with such dissatisfaction of our party, her current working situation and/or her life (it was unclear at this point.)

My friend asked her about what she thought of a dish and she simply stated ""It's good"" in a really monotone voice, way to sell it lady!

After we look around at the unhappy faces, read the terrible reviews on yelp, and took in the terrible ambiance, we start talking about leaving. Before we have a chance our unfriendly server comes up and pours water in my soda. My friend explains to her politely that it was soda and she says ""Oh"" and then slams the pitcher of water down. After she walks away we ask for the manager and after about five minutes the manager shows. We explain to her why we would like to leave and just then here comes our server with our food. We tell the manager we will stay and pay because it's already here. 

At this point the service didn't get much better and all we managed to do was anger the server. I sat there looked at my french toast, took a bite and wondered ""How you can mess up french toast?"" One of my friends ordered fish and chips. He stated that the fish was over cooked and very bland.

I can't say enough negative about this restaurant. Looking at the other reviews it obviously wasn't just an off day for them, this is their norm. After receiving our bill for our over priced and bland food, I felt it was necessary to tip our server, one cent. I feel that leaving one penny is worse than no tip at all.

My mom keeps making us come here for every God-forsaken Las Vegas trip. The service is ALWAYS really slow. 

First of all, it took the waiter a while to come to our table in the first place. By the time he got to us we were ready to order. My dad tried ordering wine, but their wine list was out-of-date and they didn't have several of the bottles of wine we wanted to order. We got the Merlot, it was okay.

We ordered three steaks, medium rare. Mine was rare, my friend's was so raw it was still grazing the asparagus (which he had specifically asked be removed in his order), and my brother's came out just right.

We sent back the raw steak for a longer cook time... it came back rare and cold about ten minutes later....

By then I had given up on my steak, anyway, so my friend finished it off.

My mom ordered the Croque Madame, which was awful and under-cooked (surprise!) and the creamed spinach that came with my order was clumpy and cold.

The only good thing about this place was the bread and butter (which took forever to get). However, when we asked for oil and vinegar for the bread, we were told there wasn't any. When we pointed out that another guy at a table had it, they went over, took it off his table, and put it on ours! Sorry guy! 

Seriously, I have low expectations from Las Vegas to begin with, but this was unacceptable.

The over-all experience was so awful I went out of my way to make sure this place exists on Yelp so I can warn future patrons.

I ordered off of the fixed menu for lunch $20. I got the French onion soup, chicken grand'mere, and napoleon pastry for dessert. 

The French onion soup tasted pretty packaged, but it was what we needed after a long night.

The rotisserie chicken was rather good and came in large portions. I believe they used Cornish hens and used half per plate. The chicken was moist and filling, and the rice with cheese bedding was probably the best part.

My friend ordered the salmon, which she said was okay.

The fruit teas were good, but I think peach had the most natural flavor.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was delicious: calamari appetizer with a lemony/zingy dipping sauce was perfect, and a very large portion.  Main course: I got the Club de St. Louis and it was absolutely wonderful.  Even loved the french fries which I don't normally find very exciting :)  The sandwich was layers of turkey, bacon, sourdough bread, with a tangy mayo-type-dressing and it was really delicious.  Also, it was big enough that I could only eat half and had to take the rest with me (note tho that I did polish off all the fries).  My hubby had the Club au Pollet and he, too, thoroughly enjoyed it.  
The only down-note was our server.  It took at least 20 minutes to get water (!!!) so I don't know if he forgot or was busy or whatever, but the rest of it went more smoothly.  He just wasn't friendly at all; no smile, no small-talk, no charm.  And he definitely didn't know any French!  We had to say the English names for the sandwiches for him to know what we wanted - I don't expect him to be fluent but at least know the menu!  He just kind of gave off the vibe that he didn't want to be there (which maybe he didn't, but you have to hide that from the customers).  
Besides that, we had a lovely dinner.  We may go back simply because the food was so good - and reasonably priced for what you get and for the fact that you are on the Strip and inside the casino!

Boasting a fried egg on top and cranberry aioli, I was excited to eat my turkey burger because it sounded pretty decent and I was starving. It was inedible. It tasted like a frozen turkey patty that was reheated poorly (and I don't doubt that's exactly what it was). It was tough and flavorless, and the raspberry aioli tasted weird.

The other times were semi decent and warranted returning visits. After this weekend though, I'm over it. We had a big party so we understood that it was going to take some time to get a table. Even the wait for the table itself wasn't bad. The suck came when we sat down. I'm not going to play the blame game and start pointing fingers either because our waitress seemed genuinely sweet. I just don't know whose fault was it so I might as well blame the entire establishment.

We got our table and menu. Some time passed before we were greeted or quite frankly acknowledged period. It was the first meal of the day and we were all craving a bite especially after a long intoxicating night. When we finally got the greet, just like any standard operating restaurant policy, drink orders were taken. Time ticked. Table of guys, trust me when I say guys know what they want to eat within a few minutes especially when you're hungry like a bear. Okay, drinks come and orders taken. Here is where it gets ugly.

Again, I've grown up in the restaurant business and understand when there's a big party it takes some time to get all the food out for a big table. Of course, the restaurants my family owned were all small hole in the walls. We were in Vegas, Paris hotel, 24 hour café, get your cooking line straight or maybe you need a Chef Ramsay visit? We sat, sat, sat. Friend got so bored, he passed around the keno sheet and we were picking numbers. He took three trips to the keno booth and still no food. Draw Something, Words with Friends, was being played by 80% of the table. There was a table of five women who sat down some time after us and they were half way through their meal. What did we have, bread & butter. Yeah, it was good bread & butter but where the F is my meal? I didn't order Australian Wagyu Steak. It was sunny side eggs, potatoes, bacon, and toast. Most of the guys on the table ordered soup/salad/sandwich combos. How long does it really take? Tick tock, tick tock, how deep does the rabbit hole go? No exaggerations. Trust me, I don't like to bash restaurants (just look at the majority of my reviews; mostly positive) but this was ridiculous. 

We finally got our meals and yeah it was decent. Nothing bad to say about our food. The guy who kept refilling our drinks must've felt bad because he kept bringing drinks over in attempt to keep us calm. Before most of us were done, we asked for the check in advance because seriously, we were done with the place & wanted to just roll. 

We were just looking for a simple and quick lunch but this ordeal turned into an unnecessary two hour+ fiasco. Not even an apology for the lag but whatever, you guys are Vegas and people will still return. Money will continue to flow inwards, but I will happily throw my extra cash and help put the strippers through college before I return to this cafe.",tXqVduTJHLbrrwVEO8JX6w,3,3,2,YKp285VALiCVPT7o5vk_SA

I had the french onion soup and it was really good. I got the mixed meats course where I ordered the mashed potatoes which was decent but could tell it was microwaved but the mushrooms dish with 5 different mushrooms which was pretty good. My meal also included two small lamb chops, a spicy italian sausage, and a petite mignon. The lamb was decent, sausage was dry, and the cook could not get the filet mignon right. I ordered it medium (pink and juicy). The first time it came out charred and over cooked and the second time, after I had sent it back it came rare and soft. The sausage looked like it was on a hot flame but the inside was dry and one end was cool to cold. For dessert the cheese cake came in and it was yellow and buttery, with not much cheese. We agreed it was like eating a sweet and salty stick of butter. My GF had the fish dish, I think it was salmon and she said it was OK but nothing special.

They were nice enough to try to make my meal right but ended up just getting filled up on the lamb and mushrooms. 

Overall, the service was outstanding and a floor supervisor even noticed I hadn't eaten much of the beef and asked if I would want a drink on the house. I kindly declined.  I imagine the kitchen had a hot flame and try to make the cook time faster but if they would use just a tad lower flame and a couple minutes longer to grill things the food would have probably been very good.

When we asked for a manager he was very rude, demeaning and certainly didn't care what we had to say.  I've never had someone so rude at a restaurant and believe me my boyfriend and I were not rude first or demanding anything crazy.  Stay away!

Located conveniently by the hotel elevators at the Paris Las Vegas hotel, Le Cafe Ile St. Louis offers French American cuisine, specializing in breakfast/brunch.  A cute facade makes diners feel they are in city of lights, with dining inside or ""al fresco"", which in this case means overlooking the casino floor.  I chose to sit ""al fresco"" both times I dined here, as it gave ample opportunity to people watch, both those gambling & those walking by, and to enjoy the filtered casino air.  I assumed seating inside would be rather stuffy.

As previously mentioned, I dined at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis on two occasions, for dinner then for breakfast the next day.  Here's the 411-

Dinner - There was very little wait & was quickly led to a table.  While waiting for my order to arrive, crusty bread & butter were placed on our table-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ
By crusty, I mean crusty.  The outer layer of bread was as crusty as my tidy whities after my first wet dream.  Yes, that crusty!  Inside, though, was airy & soft.  The butter was crack to me.  I asked for another helping of it, as I was liberally dousing each piece of bread w/ butter.  I even helped myself to spoonfuls applied directly to mouth, w/o the interference of bread.

Calamari - Fried squid w/ crispy onions, fennel, lemon & a dijon mustard vinaigrette $12-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#kVwRy-qO3v8PJYyLn5u9aw
This was delicious.  Generous portions, fried crisp & light with a captivating vinaigrette.  I asked for more of said vinaigrette because I was bathing each piece of calamari and/or onion with it.  

Burger and foie gras - Angus beef, pate de foie gras, caramelized apples, balsamic gastrique on a brioche bun w/ pomme frites $18-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#MeXfEou-G1FANcmYRGUT5w
Tres bien!  What sold it for me was the foie gras, a food item that was recently banned for sale in California.  It's like meat butter.  I delighted in the medium-rare goodness-

The pomme frites (french fries) were, sadly, soggy & limp.  I guess they spent too much time w/ the Paris go-go dancer the previous night ;p She sure knew how to twerk it, so I don't blame the fries for being limp LOL

Creme brulee $8 - 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#I2QqmkDyFQxm4iGwkx9Y_A
Ahhh, the crispy sugar shell forming a roof over the thick creme underneath.  This was magnifique!  I savored each & every bite, delighting in the burnt flavoring of the sugary shell.

Breakfast - There was about a 5 min wait, so it wasn't long before being seated ""al fresco"".  Complimentary toasted bread of choice was provided.  I chose sourdough & extra of that fantastic butter.  

Corned beef hash w/ two poached eggs $15 -
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#Lbn2VWRXcYHOWnJDlIpQ2A
Hearty, rich, stick to your ribs good!  I relished each & every bite, as the runny egg yolks slithered down the hash, making for a delectable meal.  Quality portions, worth the $15.

Cafe latte $5 - This could French kiss my derriere.  Weak coffee in a small cup.  I thought the Europeans were known for how strong they like their coffee.  This was more like Folgers.  The Gevalia I brew at home is leaps & bounds better than this drivel.

Service was good, as extra butter was brought out & drinks were refilled.  Seating is plentiful throughout, w/ my recommendation of dining ""al fresco"".

I enjoyed my 2 dining experiences here at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.  It's Vegas, so the prices can be a little high for what you get, but I mostly enjoyed the food I had the pleasure of eating here.  Plus, the convenience of having the restaurant located right outside the hotel elevators make stopping here a breeze.

Recommend!

Au revoir!

The food we had was all quite tasty. 3 steak & eggs, 1 omelet, and 1 eggs benedict. Everything was a perfect portion size and my steak & eggs were juicy and flavorful (though it was more medium rare than the medium well I had asked for).

My only complaint really was the waiter. He was engaging and interactive, but it felt like he was trying a bit too hard to be fun. Maybe I'm being picky, but there was just something about him that didn't come off right. Also, at one point one of the busboys came by to ask for some more water & while he did he gave me a bit of a mini back scratch which came of as very weird. It wasn't like he was coming onto me, but it was just one of those ""what the heck was that about?"" moments.Definitely something I'll be laughing about for a long time.",jH4i-q5cyHdLKDTJER0oew,1,0,4,4vVmMfDkQqItBuGtbCCeag

Don't get me wrong, I used to love this place for brunch.  They used to have drink specials and you could get some decent food without going too Vegas on the price.  

Now it's just... bad.

The food is average at best.  The Western Omelette was exceptionally plain, with the bell peppers, onions and (overcooked) ham thrown in seemingly at random.  The hash browns seemed like they had been prepared for some time before actually reaching my plate.  The calamari was pretty micro and the other breakfast options weren't much better.  At upwards of $13 a plate, I should've received two of what I ordered given the quality and effort that went into making them.  

Equally as bad was the service.  It took almost two hours to get our order taken, receive our food and then get the bill.  Not even the Keno lady was walking around with any sort of regularity so I wasn't sure what the staff here were trying to accomplish other than tempting us to dine and dash.  There are no longer any drink specials for us to drown our sorrows in, so we figured we might as well just go gamble and get 'em for free....",_SVAW_bwFx3G2tDqmsmOBw,2,2,2,mdav9kwv5lG3U4c25ijbpg

 A short time later, this bemoth of a plate comes out, completely covered with great quality corned beef and hash, with two overeasy eggs! Really, looked like something out of the Flinstones or something. And it was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.

 The downside here was the service: Friend asks for an Iced Americano. Out comes some iced coffee contraption with cream. Asked for water, had to ask 3 times.

I know most people don't really take kids to Vegas, but we were just on a quick day trip so we did have my son and there is no kids meal just as an FYI they do however have high-chairs.

Best friend & I stumbled still half drunk from the night before for some brunch and I'm sure happy that we did. We stayed at Bally's which seemed to have no restaurants in sight, so after strolling through the Bally's-Paris connection we saw this place and decided to give it a try. First of all the decor is pretty dated and old! They sat us inside and it was a pretty bleak ambiance. We passed 8 open tables but of course they seat us between two tables already eating so we had to squeeze in without bumping into everyone. But once we sat down the customer service and the food was AMAZING. All the waiters helped with refills, they were polite and attentive, and our sandwiches were BOMB.com! I had the Turkey club which was delicious and stacked high! Bacon pieces were thick and crispy, and my friend's BLT was just as good. The fun surprise was their fries! They were seasoned with garlic and parsley and came in a large portion. And once we got the check, our total was only $35!

 The wait to be seated was not the fastest, the selection was not the best, and the prices are high. But what else is new in the world of Strip cafes ?
  Just like the Paris Hotel and Casino, I add a star for a well done job on the theme. In my case, the Paris theme helps create a disbelief from reality. The attention to the Paris theme, kind of made me feel like I was dining in a Paris cafe. If this was an ordinary looking cafe, then I'd be turned off by the wait to be seated and limited menu.
   As far as table service, no problems. Oscar was a  professional and attentive waiter. 
  The steak special was decent. Just like the buffet in Paris, the potatoes are superb. I would of appreciated more potatoes than green beans with a fairer portion of steak.
   An interesting observation is that the prices here are similar to the far less fancy cafes. Including the Flamingo Cafe.
 If you are up to getting a good cafe meal at a decent price, I recommend an off Strip casino such as the Orleans. If you want decent food at inflated prices in a well-done Paris themed cafe, I recommend Le Cafe.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,2,1,3,GdrMzw6fChDakJTyUizhEg

I was starving and couldn't wait to get some food in me.  Thinking we could probably get a quick bite at the cafe, we proceeded to the diamond desk.  We were seated promptly.  

The place was busy but we got our drinks fairly quickly, the waiter got really busy delivering food to other tables.  He finally came by to take our orders and I had to tell him to put in a rush because we hadn't got much time.  He was nice to say 'no problem'.  

My fiance ordered a Western Omelet (yeah, he loves omelet), and I ordered a Paris Combination which had 2 pancakes, ham (bone-in), and 2 eggs.  I didn't like my breakfast at all.  The pancakes were not fluffy, the bone-in ham were interesting (with fat and skin still on), and the eggs (over medium) were just eggs, you know.  All these for $40.  I think I get better food at Denny's for about 1/3 of the price!  

Paris is supposed to be a 4-star hotel.  I am shocked at the restaurant quality at Paris.  (I also made the mistake of going to Le Villiage Buffet the next day.)  In fact the diamond lounge serves better food than the restaurants.  The only reason I didn't go to diamond lounge was because it was closed at the time.

Basically, it is a glorified faux Parisian diner. You look up and around and see that you are sitting below a ceiling of blue skies, white fluffy clouds, and fake building fronts. I guess Le Cafe is trying to mimic the feel as if you are actually sitting in an outdoor cafe in Paris, enjoying a cappuccino while puffing away on a cigarette.

Sure, the service can be a bit ""spotty"" here and on the slow side, but it is open 24 hours and is a nice reprieve off the noisy casino floor. It's a decent enough place when you are craving a late night meal, breakfast, snack, or just want some coffee and a pastry. As with most casino eateries they can be a bit pricey and Le Cafe is no exception.

As a late night option when the clock is hitting midnight and most other restaurants are closed, or if you just don't feel like schlepping down the Las Vegas strip looking for a place to eat, Le Cafe is always there, open and available.

As for recommendations, I'm not entirely sure what I would recommend. Firstly my group ordered a lot of Asian food, we do not recommend it. Another ordered your all American tuna sandwich and that's not too bad, so the safest is to stick to very American food here. Food that is simple and easy to make will be the safest.

Calamari was seasoned to perfection. Tasty Crisp light batter and ample portions! The homemade marinara sauce was delicious and had lots of garlic and spice.

Grilled steaks were cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. So tender you could have cut it with a fork.

When my wife and arrived at our hotel in Vegas on 05/16/13 we were quite hungry and ready for lunch. After a brief discussion we decided, we would get our bags situated in our room first and then head to this restaurant mainly because of it's proximity and because our stomachs talking to us lol. 

When we arrived at the entrance we were immediately greeted by the hostess and quickly escorted to our seats (So far so good). Now here is where it starts to go down hill (Just a mental reminder that this place was not busy at all during this time).

Ok so my wife and I sat at the table for well over 20 minutes before a guy finally arrived and asked us our drink orders. We quickly told him what we wantef to drink because by this time we already knew what we wanted for lunch. When I proceeded to tell him what we wanted to order he said, ""Your server will be with you shortly"" (Well that was a bold face lie). After about 5 minutes the guy brings out our drinks and some bread with butter for us to eat.

This bread was awful and its not so much because of taste but more so because the outer part of the bread was hard like rocks. So we thought we could bypass that by eating the soft inside which we found out was not even room temperature this bread was cold. So we ended not eating the bread. I say about another 20-25 minutes later our server arrives to take our order (FINALLY!).

After finally placing our order (The Paris Burger w/ Fries) that took another 15-20 minutes to finally get delivered to our table. The good thing is that when the food finally came it was pretty good. The fries were pretty good and I like how the top bum of the burger was cooked. The edge of the buns had a crispy texture while the rest of the bun still remained sofT. 

Overall the burger was not life changing but still a decent burger and the fries were good as well. In the end the reason for the low rating is because service was extremely SLOW and the bread was not good at all either (Some people might like that but not me).

The sad thing is that this place seems to be packed with people later in the evening however because of this experience I do not think I'll be coming back to this until maybe my next trip to Vegas. There are just too many restaurants and places to explore to be fixated on this one.

Maybe next time Le Cafe. Hey maybe you guys might have better look with service.

Sometimes, you can make an argument that the place at least tried to make decent food, but I don't think you can in this case.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprise if I'm putting in more effort to write this than it took for them to make my food - it was that bad.  

After partying at XS, I ended up coming here with some of my friends since they were staying at Paris.  Given that it was 4:30 in the morning, we were a bit too tired to stray too far, so this was convenient enough since it was right by the elevator to their rooms.  We grabbed a table amongst a dozen or so other guests, and quickly put in our order (btw, amazing how many old people are awake and gambling at that hour...makes me wonder if they didn't sleep, or just woke up).

As the food came out, we were just about starving.  Or at least, I was.  Since I wasn't in the mood for anything heavy, decided to order a bowl of clam chowder and the potato skins appetizer to share with the table.  When the waiter started to bring our food out, I could already tell something was amiss.  Everyone else's food looked fine, and the clam chowder looked like what I expected (mediocre), but the potato skins didn't look appetizing at all.  The cheese was scarce, the potatoes still looked raw, and there was barely any topping/meat at all.  It was edible, but so bland!  And once I ate a bite of the soup, that fact only became even more apparent.

Now, whoever prepared those potatoes is probably not the one that made the clam chowder because blandness is not the issue.  Instead, it's SALT.  While most places will season to taste with salt, these guys must have a GIANT cube of salt in the pot, and add chowder to taste instead.  Seriously, you can't taste anything else, whether it be the chowder or the clams.  It was so bad, I really - I had a handful of sips and just had to stop.  They might as well call it hypertension chowder.

My friends seemed to think their food was okay, but most drank more than I did so I don't really know if they actually liked it or not.  Good for this place being open 24 hours, but with so many other choices out there, you should do all that you can to go somewhere else regardless of the time.  Even if you're drunk off your ass and staying here, go upstairs and get room service...it'll taste better (since it can't be any worse) and you won't even have to leave your room.

The inside is a bit more like a nicer Denny's or IHOP?

Anyhoo...the burger I had was decent, and I got it with a yummy side of coleslaw.  The food was no-frills, but it the spot wonderfully.  My friend got their duck crepe, which was filled with tender duck breast and topped with a creamy sauce. Super tasty!

Coffee was piping hot, which was nice, and the refills plentiful.  True to the IHOP-feel, it comes in a thermos for you to refill your own.  I needed lots and lots of caffeine for the day, so the thermos was actually quite appreciated.  :P",dVHL4K-c50SgSDkawlZeVw,0,0,3,Lc4VQ12x47PU6T7BmLRKVA

We were staying at Paris and I noticed a sign for a three course meal for $39. The meal included a starter, an entrée with two sides, and dessert. What a deal!

What's even better is you can reserve a table with OpenTable.com, and pay with your total rewards points. I'm a platinum total rewards member, so I really didn't have to make reservations, but why waste passing up 100 points? 

We scored 9:30 PM reservations, and was seated immediately. We were seated in the patio, which attempted to make us feel like we were dining alfresco, next to the smoke-filled casino. I thought that dining in the middle of a casino with annoying me, but frankly I didn't even notice the people walking by. 

It took a few minutes for someone to take our drink orders, and took a little while for our bread as well. Service was a little slow, and we had to request our drinks twice. But since I read  the reviews on yelp, I wasn't expecting a lot of fast service. 

I ordered the wedge salad, the New York steak with creamed corn and Yukon potatoes, and the berries and cream for dessert. Stephen had the wedge salad, the mixed grill with creamed spinach and Mac n cheese, and cheesecake for dessert.

Food wise, it was pretty good. It wasn't the same caliber as Flemings, but for $39, I could not complain.

Our first course came out within 20 minutes, and our entrées came out shortly after. There was plenty of food and we were full, so we took our desserts to go since our hotel room had a refrigerator.

Overall a decent experience, and I must say I was pretty pleased that we had decent service. Aside from asking our waiter for drinks twice, I could not find a lot of fault with this place.  I guess I couldn't find any fault because the food was comped, since I use my total rewards points to pay for everything. 

I'd come back, but only if I paid with comp points.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,1,0,4,hZ7T-pWCZAbjN6MUrhbZuQ

The wait was short, good point... but our waiter took 20 minutes to come ask what we wanted.

Then we saw the eggs benedict at the table next to us.  We looked at each other at the same time: the english muffin were totally burned!  Shortly after the owner of the plate asked for more hollandaise sauce as there was barely any.

Then came my espresso... well that's what I had ordered.  I got some instantaneous coffee instead.  I asked if the machine was broken and they said no.  I then asked to get it exchanged for a regular coffee.  It was as bad but at least I didn't have to pay the $5.50 for my double-espresso.

Then much later came our greasy toast with fake butter and the rest of the order.

If you go there for a french experience, just forget about it.  This place should be avoided at any price.

As a nice alternative, go get your croissants and pains au chocolat next door at Lenotre which is a nice patisserie with nice coffee and pastries.

Enjoy your trip in Vegas!

Didn't think yelp reviews wouid be so low for such a place (I should have figured with the many empty tables though). But still, I like this place. They had a line forming outside their entrance even though they had many empty tables (I had thought they were reserved at the time). But I guess they were just taking their time seating people.

I had the special and tried the French Onion Soup... which was a bit salty for me (and nothing special). For the entree, I opt for the steak (forgot what cut though). Steak was pretty tender. It was had flavor, but not marbled enough. I requested creamed spinach and mac & cheese for my sides. The kitchen screwed up and gave me creamed corn instead of mac & cheese. But I didn't complain, because it was the best creamed corn I've had. I always though Lawry's in Beverly Hills made the best creamed corn... but I like it here more! So glad they screwed up my order! The creamed spinach is just whatevers. I figured after a few days of pigging out in Vegas... I should put some dark green veggies in me which is why I picked this instead of fries.

My boyfriend ordered the foie gras with caramelized apples burger which I tried a piece of. Either this place didn't make it right, or I find nothing fancy about foie gras (it was my first time trying). For dessert, I took my chocolate cake to go because I was too full to eat it at the restaurant. Heck I was too full to eat it at all until the next morning. But.. the cake was still really moist the next morning. I regret not eating it the night before lol. One thing really worth mentioning is our waiter Jose. He is probably one of the nicest waiter I've ever had! Kitchen service needs improvement though. It felt like forever waiting for our food and the restaurant wasn't packed. And they need to pay attention to people's orders. I might have liked the fact that they gave me creamed corn instead, but it might not always be this way.

5822622,2008-12-10,2,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,"Vegas, I think I'm done with you.  On my first visit, you were a bit obnoxious and fake for me.  However, upon further visits, you lured me in a bit.  Great deals on hotels, hundreds of dollars in blackjack winnings, and good food?  I was sold.  Last time you bared your teeth and took my blackjack money.  I started to see you for who you really are, not really wanting to continue the relationship.  This time was like visiting an ex.  I was in town, figured I'd introduce my friends to you even though I was mentally pretty much done with you.  This visit only clinched that for me.  I have zero love for Vegas anymore.  The strip is completely devoid of culture or anything I want to actually put money into.  The Paris hotel is a perfect example of that.

Ugh.  I always check Yelp before going somewhere out of town.  Why didn't I do that this time?

I was on a work trip to Vegas, staying out by the airport, and taking two first time Vegas-visiting employees down to the strip.  We were extremely tired and hungry, but on a budget.  Yes, we're on the company dime, and our company is on the frugal side.  Doesn't leave too many options for dinner on the strip.

We went into this place which, as others have mentioned, is like a French Denny's.  The menu was pretty darn expensive, too, for being the ""diner"" version of the Paris restaurants.  I saw similar prices on the menu at Paris's more upscale ""Mon Ami Gabi"".

We all opted for the $12.99 beef tenderloin with crab and asparagus topping, vegetables, and potatoes.  The crab topping was neither crab nor K-rab.  Not sure what it was, except for white and stringy.  The steak was kind of bland but at least edible.  I only had to spit one chewy piece into my napkin.  I think at $12.99, it was one of the cheapest things on the menu.

We had to ask for the bread, which was nothing special.  I had to eat some butter to make the meal taste better, though.

If you want cheap steak, go for the $10.99 steak and lobster in the basement at Binion's.  The atmosphere is similarly Denny's-like, and the food only slightly better, but at least you get some lobster and a salad.

We stopped by the other day for a late lunch, around 2:30, noticing the patio was about 3/4ths full.  Much to our surprise, we found a line about 4 tables deep.  Worse yet, there is Diamond / Seven Stars VIP line where you can get cut-off at just about anytime before you're seated.  They told us 45 minute wait -- which struck me as inexplicable given the only partially full restaurant.  Two couples jumped off line in front of us.  We got cut off by two Diamond members and we still seated in 10 minutes.  The inefficiency of this process should have been a clue as to the rest of the experience.

The place looks French and the menu reads French, but the food is neither terribly good, nor terribly French.  The onion soup arrived burned on top and without soup spoon.  The broth wasn't bad but it was really hard to eat with a teaspoon and, finding anyone to get us one took about 10 minutes.  I knew the second the waitress put it down that there was no soup spoon, but she was off like a shot before I could say anything.

The French Dip was almost inedible -- isn't the meat supposed to be either warm or lukewarm?  Theirs was cold, like from the refrigerator.  The jus wasn't bad.  The bread was nice.  The fries were disgusting, cold, and way too many of them.  

The salade frisee was dried out, looking like the lettuce had been left out in the kitchen too long.
