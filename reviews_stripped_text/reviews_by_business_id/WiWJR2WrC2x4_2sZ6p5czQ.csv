In the three years I have been coming to this location, I have never had anything wrong with my order. I always come later at night and usually within a couple hours of closing. 

The reason for the sudden review after so long is a drive through cashier named Dominique M. (That's the name that was on the receipt. It was Monday night at 11:50.) I generally don't like to visit fast food places minutes before closing because I don't want to inconvenience them after a long shift. I didn't even realize it was so late until after I ordered. Even though there were only minutes left before closing, he was very kind and patient. He didn't rush me at all, and told me to take my time. When I got to the window there was something I had forgotten to order at the drive through screen. He didn't seem annoyed at all, and even had a smile on his face the entire time. HE actually apologized to ME for the wait at the window, even though there wasn't a wait at all. Of all the fast food cashiers I have encountered, he left a memorable impression. Even though our transaction was no longer than a few minutes, I left with a smile, knowing that I needed to make management aware of the great employee they have running their drive through window.",A7rNfK0CXWgewK9mNttYWw,1,1,5,CZ6Ynon77jenvVCYi0Ol-A

ERA!! She was and idk even know to say this, the most helpful Taco Bell employee ever!!! 
We ordered 3 soft shell taco supremes with diablo sauce and I was in the mood for a blue raspberry freeze- poppin candy of course.
What ERA does went above and beyond my expectations was that with the popping candy- she put it on the bottom, the middle and the top! 
Made my dinner so memorable and delicious and the sour blue raspberry def washed away the oily saltiness of the taco meat. 
Regardless, Taco Bell is delicious (despite what anyone says) and will always be my fast food food of choice but thanks to ERA I will always remember this meal and not only that she was super friendly and as described before beyond helpful!",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,3,2,5,DYNIvLJqMpQG_1oJyJ6YeA

My boyfriend and I just left this location and weren't disappointed at all. We ordered just over $50 worth of food - that's a lot of tacos and our order was complete with no issues at all.

The cashier, Tyler, was helpful. Mind you, I hadn't been to a Taco Bell in a while. Although, not much has changed, there was a few new items. He explained a few of them, which was nice. (Not that there's much difference in the items.)

I'd probably come here again for my yearly Taco Bell meal.",WhphPcDFiDnVlFa9izB29Q,0,0,4,mgl4ICB16iujMW7SmrWulw
3134588,2014-03-19,0,WiWJR2WrC2x4_2sZ6p5czQ,"Came here a few days ago because we were starving and wanted tacos. The person behind the counter was cheerful (for a change)!  I started with a Cheesy Gordita Crunch no hard shell only flour tortilla, and my boyfriend's Mom ordered a hard shelled taco & we both had Cherry Kick Starters for drinks being that it was Happy hour!

This location is hardly ever clean when we walk in because the teens from the high school tend to come here for the free wifi & a bite to eat. The bathroom is LOCKED if you have to go make sure you ask someone to open it FOR YOU. : | I hate that about this location.   The one on Warm Springs is right by the Sierra Vista High & it's super clean.  Not to mention they don't lock the bathrooms on you.

Well all in all it was a decent improvement from the last time we came in and were treated poorly.  I have to say this is an A-OK rating because it wasn't spectacular service.  The food was HOT & FRESH. I hated the Mountain Dew Cherry Kick start, made me sick to my stomach a third of the way into it, I threw it away after getting nausea.  I will just grab a Fountain drink next time. : )  You live you learn.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,1,0,3,Pb37foIC3Yj8sSorb7xL-g

This morning it was horrible.  The taco had almost no meat, a few shreds of lettuce and cheese was almost nonexistent.  I guess it's typical fast food.  Of coarse I went through the drive through and didn't find this out till I got home.  And you know what Leo Gets said in the movie Lethal Weapon about going through the drive through!  

*****. Update:  well today, no better!  Plus I saw cashier dude was swinging the bathroom key attached to a ladle and pointing at the menu.

Kat has to be the happiest person on the planet. She said something on the intercom about it's a Merry day after Christmas at the Bell-- pause -- And then ""well that was fun"" haha I swore I thought she was a recording which is why the pause. She sounds like a commercial. A very happy one. Maybe she is practicing to be a comedian or just having fun. She's hysterical. 

I think we should all learn from Kat and make the best out of wherever crap hole you work. The world would be a happier place. Oh and the food? I felt too guilty ordering bean tostadas at Taco Bell on a non-cheat-day and even guiltier thinking my trainer probably saw my check-in... So I had a bite and tossed it. Sigh.

Polite trainees but really unpleasant manager. Finally left with a refund for one drink and the missing tacos and burrito.

The people that make the food were average young people i didnt see anything dirty, but its not like i stuck my head in stared as they prepared my food...

I must have a strong stomach since its been 3 hrs and I'm ok.. 
Maybe people are just over critical? Or it just seems like the type of people to always have a grudge against fastfoods somehow ends up rating it... Pretty much disgusted before even walking in... Its taco bell what did u expect?
