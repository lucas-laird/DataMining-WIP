I had the fajitas with just vegetables  and no meat, they had no problems not doing it, even though some of the cooks gave me a funny look, that's expected by now...

I ordered a side of rice, and a side of fried yuka. I had to negotiate on them making me a side of JUST YUKA. They have a portion which is a plate and the cost of an entre√©. I spoke to the manager or owner that was present and she was so kind and polite and she agreed on charging me a tad more than a side of fries for the Yuka. They really should add Fried Yuka as a side, it's much tastier than french fries. 

The vegetables were seasoned perfectly. Everything about it was wonderful, it was fully seasoned and cooked to perfection, not raw like you get in most American restaurants, and not soggy like you get in Chinese restaurants. Perfect tenderness!  

The rice was tasty and the fried yuka to die for! 

The people that were there were so friendly that it really makes it feel like a place one can become a local at. 

My compliments to the chef and to the people who run the place. I had a great experience and will certainly return!",GDY-w1OO_nzLfe9AAVzgGA,1,0,5,QZsx23Wfs6hb4HukHwRCHQ

Pupusas are delicious grilled hot pockets. Our cashier recommended the mixed but Yelp reviews clued us into the cheese. We also ordered two tamales: chicken and pork. We also got the fried yucca and pork.

The pupusas were amazing. Savory goodness gooey in the bread. The mixed pupusas is a must try. We adored the cheese pupusas. The cheese pulls gorgeously! When you eat it with the homemade tomato sauce, it was like a grilled cheese and tomato soup combination.

The fried yucca was so flavorful and crispy on the outside. The fried pork was also super crispy. They also give you a cabbage salad that is lightly drizzled with vinaigrette.

The tamales were steamed with a small sheet of banana leaf. The corn was steamed on the soft and wetter side. The chicken filling was super tasty. The pork was alright. 

Finally, the Salvadoran horchata was so different from Mexican horchata. Less sweet with a smoky bitter note from the toasted cocoa! I liked it!

2279642,2017-03-23,4,o01ztaNP08Dq8DJImuovcw,"I hate leaving this review, but these were arguably the worst pupusas I've ever eaten. 

I ordered a loroco, a cheese, and a pork. I could easily identify the pork and the cheese, but the loroco had zero filling. I think they forgot to fill it, because if was just masa. It was so greasy it fell apart and was inedible. It tasted like old grease that wasn't hot enough. The escebeche and sauce were both in little ziplock bags which was a car disaster waiting to happen, so I returned those to the counter before even leaving the restaurant. 

The cheese was burned on one side, and it was also extremely oily. 

The pork pupusa was the best; it wasn't oily like the others, and was lightly charred on one side which created a nice texture. 

The restaurant space was huge, lots of stone finishes - it was attractive and lots of seating. The staff was very friendly and if 2/3 pupusas hadn't been inedible, this could have easily been a 4 star experience.",45mRoEbA_IvHIyUHpiABBw,8,2,2,gOPmkH-R3uCdbx7QjdFk6Q

We came to this restaurant in hopes that we could finally have a wonderful little pupusa joint near home to go to frequently and left utterly shattered of that hopeful dream. 

The pupusas were 90% dough and 10% filling. We could discern the entire circumference 3/4s of an inch in was pure dough. The dough was so thick however that heat struggled to penetrate it and left it rather raw.
They were NOT the stable, thoroughly stuffed, warm delicacies I've loved for years. And at $2.25 a pupusa, I'm sorry, but we didn't pay to fill up on nearly uncooked dough.

On top of that, the house 'hot sauce' tasted quite literally like watery remnants of a store bought Pace salsa. And lastly, the horchata? Tasted burnt. How do you burn horchata? :(

To my surprise the owner Luis was in the building. He was courteous, polite and inviting, glad we had the chance to chit chat. The rest of the staff were also kind and all had smiling faces, obviously, happy to be working there. 

I decided on a traditional Salvadorian breakfast, pupusas and some nachos native to the country. All the food was piping hot and delicious. The fried plantains on the breakfast dish were outstanding. It was also the first time I had nachos served without cheese which is how they're traditionally served in El Salvador. The chips tasted like they had just come out the fryer, light, crispy and crunchy.

Totally filling, totally a bargain. I have gone back twice now, for the exact same thing. I suspect I will do this for a while until I tire of this one dish and try the tamal or Yucca tamal (looks so much like a pastele from PR)

We were expecting restaurant style seating but it's more of a fast food little hole in the wall joint. I am as a say those hole in the wall joints are absolutely fabulous. Authentic Salvadori and food with a lot of flavor and generous portions.  Give them a try.,oNvrc4KfjyQcdcHM5oFh_A,0,0,4,IQrvRR_zurw3hp_QNhjWjw

The Pupusas were so flavorful and the service was spot on! I'd recommend the mixed Pupusas with the house made sauce, not spicy, but so flavorful...",E0RqDmqrkzIwoBt3SLVxsQ,0,0,4,eXOyNdh-IyjGDdmfdz47BQ

1. the cashier couldn't properly take down my order
2. the cashier wasn't sure what a CHEESE ENCHILADA was, so instead, he punched me in for a medium drink
3. i even placed my order in both english AND spanish, and he still didn't understand me
4. he wasn't sure of the menu items at all, had to keep asking the cooks if this/that was able to be made.... which was yes at the register but 10 mins into waiting for my food, i was told couldn't come that way.. 
5. i almost forgot to mention, he forgot to give me my change until i put my hand out and even then i don't think he gave me the correct amount of change
6. the pupusas were dry and greasy, the meat wasn't seasoned at all
7. tomato juice and cabbage came in ZIP LOCK bags!! what am i suppose to do with the tomato juice?! pour it into a different container? poke a hole and squeeze it out?! dip my pupusa in the bag?! disgusting and inconvenient!
8. i still don't know what their cheese enchilada taste like because I NEVER GOT ONE!

i'm not coming back here, don't waste your time. they clearly don't know what they're doing or how to speak english nor spanish.",YVsA6hP0G1nU3siFZaCvPA,0,0,1,dDUHvF1FnHSQjMFF4j2anw

5805575,2017-04-25,2,o01ztaNP08Dq8DJImuovcw,"Just finished trying this place and I do have to say it's not too bad at all! It could've used more spice and maybe salt, I know salt is provided and all but still.

My girlfriend and I ordered the cheese and chicken pupusas. First off they make it fresh so it's not like it sits on the side or in a pan. They have a lady there that makes them and you can tell it's with love. They serve you a bowl of cabbage (seasoned) and a bottle of homemade tomato sauce, not too bad. There is a slight wait but it's due to the fresh pupusas being made. 

When you receive the pupusas, they come out nice and warm and it's good! I would recommend this place to anyone craving pupusas and I will be back to try the other Salvadorian food I saw on the menu! 

Oh and he horchata isn't your normal horchata it's a Salvadorian horchata!",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,3,2,4,N5cu1EvRy-rhn9R3atGMYg

I had the chicken pupusa and a bean pupusa and I loved how they are served with the refreshing pickled coleslaw and red sauce. The flavors paired together so well and I can't believe I had never tried one before. We also tried the corn tamale which had delicious shredded beef inside but the outer consistency was just a bit soggy for me, unfortunately. I still give this restaurant 5 stars for delicious pupusas and will definitely be back!",9KedzFFaQSK06pl25KcjhQ,1,0,5,QMtw1_2cRTwclwRDrnOvgA

5920754,2018-04-21,0,o01ztaNP08Dq8DJImuovcw,"I have been here a few times before but today they were extremely rude. After checking my receipt I noticed they charged me for an extra item, i asked them to credit as it was incorrect. The waitress was extremely rude stating there was no way to get refunded (even though I hadn't received my food) and REFUSED to refund the trans. She should not shift the blame on the customer, rather avoid any confusion by repeating the order. I love going to all locations but this recent visit will probably be my last. I have never had such rude waitress. Keep in mind that not everyone that comes in to your location is a tourist. I am a local from the SW and I will make sure to inform everyone to avoid this location",zQ6wDBHHiWSKxDmgox_Y1w,2,0,1,he_sE6ZwiwWc0oRDwZRC4g

I always like to try Salvadorian restaurants everywhere I go and by far this is the best I've had here in Vegas! The staff is so friendly and helpful when ordering. The prices are great too!
