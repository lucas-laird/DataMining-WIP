We ordered the lobster potpie appetizer (18), small but full of flavor and lobster. Wife ordered the special which was Lamb chops (36) and a glass of merlot (16). She said it was cooked perfectly, full of flavor, and the sauce surely complemented the meat. I ordered the new Your sirloin medium rare (38), flavor & portion size was OK but for the price I kind of expected it to be more tender. It's definitely not a Ruth Chris Steak.

228870,2014-06-30,1,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"Totally mediocre. I went on a Saturday night, so they should have been at the top of their game. Based on reviews, I was expecting something wonderful. I had the caesar salad which was delicious except for the pretzel croutons which were too tough to chew. Then I had the shrimp risotto. Only three little shrimp! The shrimp were good but the risotto was not. It was cold and the sauce tasted like Chef Boy'rD. My friend's broccoli side order was not put in right away so it came after the meal. It was tasty but it was strange to eat it like a dessert. 

There were lots of servers standing around talking to each other. They seemed bored, waiting for food to come out of the kitchen. I asked for a napkin because I didn't have one at my place setting and it took a long time to come. I should have just grabbed one from the next table.  

Anyway, I was so annoyed by the whole experience that I used my phone while we were waiting for broccoli to make a reservation at another restaurant for the next day.

The ambiance is nice, quiet enough to have a conversation. Oddly, there is a TV in the dining area but not in the bar.

Maybe the pizza would have been better. I saw some at another table and it looked good. But with so many restaurants in Vegas, you can do better.",nsABcPSjF6XzFr3-mvTfHQ,0,0,2,qeQvpV-hpX70hSvCfjZ_bg

The hazelnut dessert seems large enough to share, until you taste it and then you don't want to share it with anybody! The wine list is cushioned with surprises and a solid foundation of wines.

Also my husband was SO EXCITED because they carried Innis & Gunn beer and he hadn't seen it in the States before. I had a glass of Chard. I thought it was pretty terrible but I'm not one to complain about wines so I sipped it twice before my husband asked me if I liked it. I told him I didn't so he tried it. He thought it had gone bad so he asked the waitress to replace it with a different one. She was very kind about it and the new glass was quite nice. For entree I had the shrimp risotto and my husband had the roasted cauliflower. Both were great. We ended the meal with an odd sort of chocolate dessert with mangoes.

783345,2014-12-30,2,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"Such heavy seasonings and dressings that the actual food could not be tasted at all. So disappointing.   

We ordered: 
blistered green beans
kale salad
shrimp risoto
tuna two ways
french onion soup

Each dish sounded amazing. Sadly, each dish disappointed. 

Blistered green beans: it was very difficult to taste the green beans as the dish was smothered in overpowering creamy curry sauce. Such heavy sauce was unnecessary and it doesn't complement the rest of the dishes on the menu. 

Kale Salad: this too was drenched in dressing. The vinaigrette was strong and little of it would have gone a long way.  

Shrimp risotto:  this dish gets 5 stars. It was great! Risotto was of perfect texture, the grilled shrimp were done perfectly and their flavor was pure and delicious. The light tomato sauce complemented the rice and the shrimp well and nicely tied the dish together. 

Tuna too ways:  the seared tuna was so salty that we couldn't eat it. The tartare was - you can guess - swimming in lemon juice. I happen to love lemon and generally want to add more lemon to dishes, but this tartare was a lemon bath. 

French onion soup: I did not eat this, but must say it's presentation was not very good.  My companion said it was a ""lazy preparation/presentation.""  As we know, eating with our eyes is very important. 

On top of all this, service was a zero.  The sommalier was the first and only person that spoke to us.... He took our wine order, delivered the wine. Very pleasant guy.  He then walked by our table multiple times and seeing as to how I was half way done with my wine, he decided to take our food order.  [Perhaps he cooked our food too?].   He told us it's tapas style so dishes will come out as they are ready.  OK, no problem. 

Everything came at the same time 20 minutes after we ordered.  Terrible. 

No one came by to check on our food.  A waitress stopped by, fiddled with bills in her apron and took a plate off our table WITHOUT looking up at us or saying a word.  

No one else came by.  We only had one hour for dinner before our show so there was no time to complain and send the dishes back.  We both left hungry and sure we will never dine there again.  Immediately after we left, I saw a couple looking at the Menu by the restaurant entrance and I told them about our dinner and explained they were better off eating at the Food Court.",MaN-ZHzlEL8xRDLKTmzFTw,3,0,1,s7r6MT1crjKdCga-HlBgoQ

992671,2013-12-30,2,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"We had dinner reservations at Crush for Christmas. It's the restaurant that took over the space where Nobhill used to be. It had big shoes to fill, but we were hopeful since it's owned by Michael Morton who is also the co-founder N9NE at the Palms. The restaurant has a rustic chic garden feel. It wasn't too busy on Christmas eve, despite other restaurants being quite crowded. We had a booth in back after asking not to be seated at the high-top bar tables near the entry. 

They offered a nice blend of cocktails, wines and beers. We had Kronenbourg Blanc ($9) and Oro di Milano Riserva ($14), on the pricey side, but I appreciated the rare selections. The menu follows the current trend of small plates and specialty pizzas with a few large plate selections for those who prefer the old school way of dining. We started with the ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib ($16). It's offered as a small plate, but we shared as an appetizer. It's hardly enough for two, but quite enjoyable. The shortrib was rich and decadent. The gnocchi was tender and light, though it had less ricotta flavor than anticipated. 

We each ordered large plates for our entrees. My husband chose the Lamb Sirloin with Brussels Sprouts ($38) and I had the Seabass with Kale ($34). Large plate portions are not for hearty appetites but definitely an upgrade from the small plates. He really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts, and the lamb was tender and cooked medium rare as requested, but there was a flavor that was off putting. He barely touched it. The waiter took notice and offered something else from the menu. After some urging, he chose the wild mushroom pizza ($16). 

The pizza was pretty darn good. The crust was nice and crisp, the fontina was creamy and paired well with the earthiness of the mushrooms. 

My seabass and kale was prepared and served in parchment paper. It was topped with a tomato chutney. The flavors were good, but the texture overall was one note; mushy. It would've been better with some crunch. I tend to prefer fish with a nice sear. 

While dinner might not have been top notch the staff was very accomodating. They went out of their way to be sure we were satisfied. I give them props. They sent out a complimentarty Nutella Crunch dessert for the trouble. Hazelnuts and nutella are a match made in heaven. The dessert did not disappoint.

First off, DO NOT go here if you don't plan on spending your entire night at the table.  After placing our order, it took 25 minutes for them to bring out the French Onion Soup that we ordered.  I was really craving it because my mother and just ordered MGM Grand room service and gotten an amazing bowl of French Onion in her room.  After waiting nearly a half hour for it to arrive, I was VERY disappointed as the crust on the top of the soup was dry and burnt.  After we finished the soup, we waiting quite some time for the rest of the dishes to arrive.  All told, it was nearly an hour from the time we ordered to the time the rest of our food arrived.  Keep in mind that everything is an appetizer portion, so it's really hard to imagine what could take so long.  It should also be noted that the restaurant was slow that night and only had 4 or 5 other tables occupied.  

We were there for a VERY long time and although the food was okay, I don't think it was anywhere near with the cost of the meal.  We had 3 cocktails, 2 soups and 4 other small dishes.  The bill with tax and tip came to $175.  We joked that we were going to have to head over to the food court afterwards since we weren't even full.  

If money and time are of no concern to you, then you may enjoy your experience here.  Otherwise, I would choose somewhere else.  I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that if you pay $175 for a meal for two, that you should be impressed with the food and service.

The ambiance is really cool and they have these doors inside that open to a party room I assume, but the doors are lit from behind and provide a great backdrop (perfect for the 'Gram).

Our large party was seated in the very back room that included the Warriors vs Trail Blazers as well as chic wine decor.  It felt intimate but still lively.  My selections were the tomato and basil salad, lobster risotto and the sirloin steak with the happy ending desert. 

The caprese salad was delicious.  The cheese was soft and the tomatoes were fresh.  It needed no salt or pepper, which is rare for me and I could have been satisfied with stopping there.  Next the lobster risotto was creamy and prepared to perfection.  I was very happy with the quality given such a large party was being served at the same time.  Last my sirloin was HUGE and juicy.  Almost no one at the table could finish all 3 courses and unfortunately the sirloin was just too large to finish.  Still amazing.  The service was wonderful, and very attentive.  My glass was always full, and my silverware was always replaced.  This type thing really impresses me especially with large parties!

To finish things off, the happy ending dessert included a trio including macaroon dipped in dark chocolate, cheesecake and chocolate pudding.

Also, there logo contained a dancing mystical creature and it was placed throughout the restaurant. Service was good...attentive and sympathetic. We were celebrating our anniversary and they congratulated us multiple times and even comped a dessert. The wine selection was good and had reasonable options. Ordered the tomato soup; it was creamy and rich without being heavy. It was served with mozzarella like sticks, but they were triangles with cheddar stuffed in wonton wrappers. They were okay. For entrees, we both ordered the filet mignon...when it arrived it looked good drizzled with a balsamic reduction and a few fingerling potatoes slices and sauteed onions. We cut into both and they were overcooked; we ordered medium rare and it came out medium/medium well. The medium steak was still okay. Had good flavor, but both were more grainy in texture than I like in a steak, especially a fillet. The server quickly comped the medium well one as the kitchen was backed up and we'd have to wait awhile for a replacement. The a la carte side of lobster mash was quite tasty...Mashed potatoes topped with lobster. They were whipped smooth and the lobster cooked until tender with a light seasoning. Our comped dessert was a  mini cake duo with chocolate cake and cheesecake with a mango chutney. My favorite was the cheesecake.

1559671,2016-03-15,1,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"I really hoped for more from this place, not only because of where it was located in the MGM Grand and the posh atmosphere but because of the prices. 

My first disappointment was learning that they are no longer a tapas place. They are transitioning to a regular restaurant. I wish they had updated their menu online because we never would have chosen them in the first place as I was looking for smaller bites kind of place.

The AK crab risotto my dad ordered and the gnocchi my mom ordered were perfect and delicious (they told me). My husband's risotto was also super tasty he said, but he found a large piece of crab shell in it, which is extremely dangerous and unacceptable--mistakes happen, but have you ever accidentally chomped down on crab shell? Luckily, he felt the sharp edge before he bit down and spit it out.

Then, half of my lamb was severely undercooked--I had ordered it medium rare, and one of them was straight up raw in the middle. I imagine it had been frozen meat that they didn't thaw enough before cooking. The other one was closer to proper temperature, but it wasn't very tender. I ate lamb the next night at another restaurant, same type of cut (on the bone), that melted in my mouth (and it was about half the price). The carrots were also a bit too al dente for me, though I prefer less cooked to mushy. It all just felt sloppy to me.

Our server was initially very helpful and reasonable about accommodating my current diet restrictions, asking the chef for more information and helping me come up with alternatives. However, he disappeared for a long time, and it was hard to track him down when we had questions or concerns. They did get busy, which I know from experience makes it hard to focus on tables as much, but it felt like he was ignoring us. 

The manager came over to our table to serve me my recooked lamb (which was still rare in the middle, though I was too hungry at that point to try again--everyone else at the table had also long finished their meal). He apologized and was very soliciting after that point. He also said he would buy our dessert--as he walked away from the table. I didn't have a chance to tell him that my restrictions prevent me from, unfortunately, eating refined sugar. Then, they not only brought the dessert my husband ordered but this beautiful plate with several desserts. It was gorgeous and oh-so-tempting. I am sure that had I been able to eat it, I would have loved it. But I was left watching as the rest of my family, who didn't even really want anything except my husband, tried bites because they didn't want to waste it (we still left over half). 

Ultimately, I appreciated the gesture to make up for our experience, but it failed miserably because I was the one whose food was screwed up, and I didn't get to enjoy the gesture. If he didn't want to comp my meal, that's fine. Why not offer a glass of wine instead, something? The one thing I really did enjoy was our French Pinot Noir--it was a pretty good wine menu. Anyway, the manager both seemed concerned about the problem but not enough to actually listen to me. That would have been enough to bring this down to a two star review, but I must concede that the food everyone else ate was spot on, and again, those desserts were amazing (I'm told). Still, I would never go back to this restaurant, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",7G6WQKuL2di8e0ad8nfR3w,3,0,3,wEQI0HrCeykgDuxp1FYSmw
1577247,2015-06-15,0,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"This is the perfect foodie restaurant. Even though it's expensive, it has a sampler style menu, allowing you to pick out many different items and try lots of things at once.

My family was looking for a good place to eat on our first day in Vegas and we didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for the meal. We ended up at Crush because of their $15-$20 menu items. The restaurant itself is extremely well decorated. It has a dark Italian atmosphere with these big, inscribed doors near the back. I loved the circular patterned tile flooring. It was a level of intricacy you don't see nearly anywhere.

Onto the food. Well, turns out, the menu is deceiving. You only get about appetizer sized meals per $15-$20 plate. The waiter told us we should order 2-3 items per person or we won't get full. Even though we realized we kind of got tricked, we were ok with doing it sampler style. We ended up ordering 13 dishes for 5 people, with no duplicates. Basically, we tried everything on their menu that was recommended.

Salads: Kale, Arugula, Caesar, and Caprese. Let me start by saying I hate salad dressing. I'm a big fan of just eating salad on its own, so I never get dressing. All 4 of these salads had dressing on them. I loved them all. The Kale and Arugula had a dark, savory dressing that really made the salad feel hearty. The Caesar had a lemon Caesar dressing that was sweeter than the typical version of the salad and very enjoyable. The Caprese was the real showstopper. This was THE BEST salad I've ever had in my life. It was a traditional Caprese with pesto and special buratta cheese, which is a mozzarella blend. Even if you hate tomatoes (which I do in 95% of situations), this salad is phenomenal. Get it, love it, get it again.

Small Plates: Ricotta Gnocchi, Lobster Pot Pie, Fried Oysters, Angus Mini-Burgers. The gnocchi was interesting. The short rib tasted exactly like like Mom's roast, which everyone in my family agreed with. It was a good flavor, obviously, but too familiar in our efforts to try new things. I'd definitely recommend it though. The lobster pot pie didn't come until waaaay after everything else due to it's longer cooking time. It was ok, but I made the mistake of mixing the bread into it, which just made it soggy. Even the few bites I had before doing that, I'd still say it was meh. I've had average clam chowder that tasted better than that. The fried oysters were the special and we got them because my Dad loves oysters. I tried one, even though I hate oysters and I still didn't care much for them. They tasted better, but everything is better when it's fried. The mini-burgers were the other showstopper of our meal. They had blue cheese, onions, and tiny quail eggs on top of perfectly cooked wagyu sliders, in between buttery, toasted, delicious buns. I have had very few ""perfect"" burgers in my life. I've had the perfect ""fast"" style burger, the perfect ""burger joint"" burger, but I've never had the perfect ""gourmet"" burger until now. These are a must have.

Pizza: We got the Italian Sausage pizza. It was the biggest thing we ordered and could've easily served two people. It was flatbread style, so it was rectangular shaped with rounded ends. It was a decent pizza. The crust wasn't strong enough to hold the toppings, so it bent a lot and was too small to fold. It tasted pretty standard for gourmet pizzas, but I don't think I'd order it again.

Big Plates: 8 oz Filet, Rack of Lamb, Californian Sea Bass, Half Roasted Chicken. Each one of these were solid and delicious. They are exactly what you'd expect from a high end restaurant serving top tier meats and fish. Highlights were lamb and sea bass. The lamb was perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful. Some of the best lamb I've ever had. The sea bass was tender and buttery. It literally melted in your mouth. I haven't had fish that perfectly prepared in years. 

I've rambled long enough on this. Crush was so good it was the only restaurant on our week-long vacation we went to twice. Go there and get the Caprese, Mini-Burgers, Lamb, and Sea Bass!",neltG70Ua3aL-cS9Q5AUWg,0,0,5,82VOangD0gfyPsRqLW2Zjw

The quantity of the sides would've been the right amount for the whole table, so we over ordered. My friend ordered the lobster mash, but the 'lobster' tasted and looked more like shrimp.

We ate some of his potatoes au gratin, which were very good.  It took about 15-20 min for a new steak, so we were disappointed we didn't eat dinner ""together"". 

With that being said, Jeff took care of us! He comped my husband's steak and potatoes (which ended up being a nice cut and delicious) then brought us some sparkling moscato with paired cheesecakes.  OMG! This part was like, WOW! We don't even like moscato but it paired so beautifully with the cheesecakes. 

I also had the Barrymore rose' which was excellent!

Overall, our experience ended on a good note,  and the food was good. If it wasn't for Jeff, I don't think I would have given 4 stars. And I didn't give 5, b/c I didn't LOVE my food and my husband did have a weird piece of plastic in his food.",0m7CqR_fNwwGGKZpp0bs_Q,0,0,4,Jtzz2P0yKHOBz_seea2oNw

My sister and I also each had a steak - the 12oz sirloin with vegetables. Savory every bite!

While walking around, my husband spotted Crush and wanted to eat here. In the interest of full disclosure, I wanted to finish up on the floor and then take the taxi to the Venetian to eat at the Grand Luxe, but relented because it is rare for my husband to want to try anything new. I wasn't impressed to hear that the food was designed for people to share, especially given the prices.

However, the food itself really made up for it. It was absolutely delicious! And aside from Grand Luxe's Asian nachos, their food is the best I have ever had in Las Vegas. We were told to each pick out two or three items to order.  I ordered the roast cauliflower, tuna 2 ways, and the grilled salmon, while my husband ordered the lamb meatballs, the California sea bass, and the shrimp risotto. We were blown away by how good everything tasted, even as the portions were just tantalizing enough to make us want more. My husband was so impressed by the roast cauliflower and the carrot miso broth that accompanied the salmon, he has been working on creating them at home.

Always being a big fan of scallops, I was not disappointed at all by their scallop appetizer. For main entrees, I would recommend the shrimp risotto and baby back ribs. As to the chicken parmesan, the chicken was a little dry but the melted mozzarella on top was reeeally fresh.

The arugula salad was fine, as was the tofu, but the risotto was ruined by stewed tomatoes and the cauliflower was pretty much plain. Everything lacked taste, acid, salt, flavor. I commend Crush for trying to have vegetarian options, but when the pizza place downstairs does an incredible job with their food for 1/20th the price, something needs to change. As a start, have your chef could consult with a proper vegetarian chef to learn to cook for a cleaner palate.

I will say that the hostess we dealt with was top notch, and very accommodating as our group grew over the course of 20 minutes. The bartender we had as we waited only offered drinks to a couple of the girls (6 were sitting at the bar), which was odd. 
We ordered about 8 ""share"" plates to start, as we were still waiting for two girls. The food was average to a little better, some girls enjoyed their dishes more than others. I had a dish with some very nice balsamic drizzle, and asked for some bread so we could soak up some of the sauce. After about 20 minutes and another round of food ordered, I asked again for the bread, and was told, ""it takes a few minutes as they were ""grilling it fresh"". Even so, I would hope no one would leave bread on a grill for more than a minute or two.  
We received the next round of plates, and I again asked for the bread, to which our server replied, ""they're a little backed up, I'll check on it"". By this time our other two girls had arrived and had ordered 2 small plates each. Nothing for another 10+ minutes. As a manager walked around to check on us, one of the girls told him about how we had been waiting for 30-40 minutes for the bread that we asked for three times, and he was very gracious and went and got it immediately from the kitchen. Meanwhile, our other two girls waited about 30 minutes for their other 2 dishes each, and we were hard pressed to even get the server to us to order more drinks.

Not 100% sure I'm a fan of the tapas/shared plates concept-Unless the prices match the portion size. At Crush-every item was beautifully presented and absolutely perfect taste. The food quality was superb. Also appreciated the distinction of  vegan and food allergy options which makes it easier for someone with specific dining needs to enjoy eating out. My quibble with 4 vs 5 stars is the suggestion that food is meant for sharing in the Crush verbiage-and no portion size was adequate for sharing beyond a few bites. This makes ""having dinner"" a challenge in this concept, because if you come hungry-you will spend a small fortune or leave not feeling satisfied. Being a relatively healthy eater and not a fan of leaving stuffed like a beach ball and love interesting flavors and presentations-I felt the portions were entrée priced with appetizer size. The vibe is terrific and especially perfect for cocktails and light bites-just don't come wanting a full dinner as you may leave unsatisfied. Service throughout was adequate, however cocktails were not asked to refill, nor any offer of a dessert beverage despite ordering dessert. Such an easy sell when the question is asked!

They need to have more TVs or bigger TVs, especially for a big game like the Super Bowl.

My first choice, refused me admittance since I didn't have a reservation. It was 5:00.  Really?  They did me a favor as I happened upon the restaurant CRUSH.  

The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  I opted to sit at the bar instead of taking up a table for the large groups that were waiting.  I was given a menu with a varied assortment of delectables to choose.  I chose the Caesar salad and the Crab Risotto. Both were delicious, however, I didn't want the consumption of risotto to end. Cooked to perfection!  

I will be back to feast again!

Thanks again for a wonderful experience.",HBW06N6QIm6021QCS_ugtQ,0,1,5,XlPgsx-NsbDSvopAKbd1Qw

2688638,2015-05-07,0,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"Husband took me here for my birthday before we saw a show. We were supposed to have a reservation but for some reason they didn't have us down. At that point,  I almost felt like the staff looked at us and treated us like we didn't belong there. It was a really weird vibe. They were friendly but it felt very forced and fake. The food was pretty good but nothing to write home about. Basically their very small menu consisted of very small dishes. 

My husband and I ordered one of their pizzas, the sliders, and the fries. They all had fancy names but basically that is what they were. Everything took FOREVER! I mean, I understand its not Chili's, but holy cow we waited at least 45 minutes for the first item. We ordered all the items together and each was brought out  at their own separate time. Probably at least 10-15 minutes between each item being brought out. The sliders were my least favorite because of how under cooked the meat was. I'm sure that's how they were meant to be cooked and my husband liked them, but I couldn't stand to get through one with blood juices falling from the slider with each bite.

We then decided on the desert with the salted caramel. I wasn't super impressed and it took another 20+ minutes. By this point, we had to scarf it down if we were going to make it to the show.

Again, I understand this is not Chili's two for twenty kind of place, but I was pretty amazed at just how expensive it was when the quality of the good was not up to par with their pricing and the amount of time it took them to get us three appetizer type dishes. I think in total, we were there for over 2 hours.

Next time, I will skip this place, and we will head to a nice steakhouse or something where we will get what we pay for and feel more welcomed.",psn6mExIajFyif-QL4y5QA,1,0,1,76UM_Ntzs3OWIvJc7gVI_Q

- Roasted Cauliflower - Truly delicious flavors, and our favorite dish.

- Gnocchi - I don't eat meat, so I did not personally taste it, but my husband said it has interesting and tasty mix of flavors, and was a close second to the cauliflower.

We loved the ambiance, really dim and romantic. It just had a cool vibe and when we went it wasn't fully occupied. Most guests were seated on the other half of the restaurant so it felt like we had private dining. 
We were there on a weekend of a big ufc fight so as we sat there waiting for our food a big ufc fighter walked out of the end bar area right past us out the door. My husband sat there a bit stunned while I had no clue.

As far as the food we really enjoyed the two way tuna. It was so fresh and prepared beautifully. We liked it better than some of the tuna we had at just as nice restaurants recently in Hawaii, and it can't get any fresher than fish in Hawaii. Although, the tuna plate was super small. The kale salad was very light and tasty. The gnocchi was okay, not my favorite. The shrimp risotto was yummy, I just love shrimp and I love risotto. To finish off we had the pita bread dessert with the bananas, chocolate and other stuff. I honestly was surprised at how good the pita bread tasted with all the sweet stuff.

If it is your first time there the servers warn you not to expect large portions and suggest you order several plates if you want more of a variety. With this in mind I ordered the shrimp risotto and the salmon. The risotto came with jumbo shrimp and was a little more al dente in some parts than I would have cared for but was still good. I also ordered the grilled salmon which was ok on its own BUT to me what really made the plate outstanding was the bed of oyster mushrooms that the salmon was served on. The combination of the salmon and the mushrooms makes this plate a must try. I was sufficiently satisfied after both of these plates. My dining companion ordered the half roasted chicken. Unfortunately, the plate lacked the wow factor the salmon had, and the chicken lacked any flavor on its own, and the broccolini it came with was way overcooked and inedible. We ended up having to add salt to give the chicken any flavor. The manager also surprised us with a mini cheesecake for my birthday (yay!), which I thought was nice. To top off the meal I had a Smith & Forge hard cider (yum!) and my companion had some drink (can't remember the name) that had raspberries in it. Unfortunately, the bartender who made it forgot to strain the seeds out, making it impossible to drink, and it had to be sent back. I had to knock a star off for the lack of flavor in the the chicken and the inconvenience of the drink. Would I come here again? Absolutely. Would I recommend you give it a try?

3261109,2015-10-20,1,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"I am reducing this review to 1 stars bc as time goes on the more I'm regretting this meal. 

1. The menu was misleading bc the prices listed were in the $15-25 range per item but when We sat down they informed us that they were small plates so 2-3 per person was recommended. The menu didn't say anywhere that they were small plates. So for that much money, I expect the food to be dayum good. 

So when..
2. Their French onion soup was fairly large in size and the broth was good. but instead of a nice crusty/soggy bread covered with oozing provolone cheese, it was a tasteless puff-pastry kind of cracker with a crispy skin of cheese. Biiiiig disappointment. 

3. Their lobster pot pie was a decent size but it only had a top crust which was layers of puff pastry that was too thick to cut. Every time I tried, I just ended up shoving it down into the ramekin and spilling the contents everywhere. So eventually I ended up w/ a dense lump of sort of soggy bread that was still too chewy that I had to pick Around or fish out. This topper would've been much better on the soup. 

Also, it was way too tarragon-y. I was informed by the waitress that you could really taste the tarragon but was not told that it overwhelmed all the other flavors. The cream sauce was tasteless and too heavy, tough you did get some lobster flavor at the back end...

While I did get enough to eat, I left three hours later feeling gross and almost $60 poorer (wine included).",zO-nUuidncG002-LXDELHQ,2,1,1,R-IcF1jo-dk8WEaQ9md4cA

We had a business dinner here and ordered off a fixed menu.  For starters we had the choice of Ceasar salad or heirloom tomatos with barata cheese and balsamic.  I went with the tomatoe salad and thought it was fresh and delicious.  

Second course option was lamb meatballs or lobster risotto, I opted for the lamb meatballs.  There were 4 meatballs in a marinara sauce.  The meatballs were a little on the dry side, but overall the dish was pretty tasty.

Third course was choice of half a lime chicken, steak, and one other choice.. I went with the steak.  Portion wise I'd say it was about 4-6 ounces, served on toasted baguette.  

Dessert was a plate of 3 items, choc mousse cake, cheese cake, and a choc dipped macaroon.  All 3 were good, my favorite being the cheese cake.

Coffee rounded out the meal and boy it was very very good coffee.

3325906,2015-05-31,0,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"I went to Crush with a group of nine as part of a bachelorette party. It seemed to have great reviews and we wound up with a 9pm reservation even when booking three weeks ahead of time. This was our last night here so we were excited to end it on a high note. A few things I noticed:

Accommodations
They have an excellent allergen menu with many options. I'm gluten intolerant so it made it easy to narrow down my choices and order something that would be accommodating. 

Ambiance
We are a group of women in our late 20s and early 30s and we found it to be way too dark in the restaurant. So much so, I found it difficult to read my menu. I hardly have problems with my eye sight and as I looked around everyone was squinting at their menus. It has a great vibe and beautifully decorated with Edison bulbs and modern touches but starting things off there was already the frustration with hardly being able to see.

The waitress was very clear that it is small plates and she recommended that each person order two or three items. It took about ten minutes to be asked for our drink order after being seated and what we wanted to see was a drink menu. The waitress came back with one drink menu for the nine of us. So we passed it around since she left us quickly and came back another ten minutes later. The waitress did her job but not much engagement or level of care beyond that. A primary issue seemed to be the service.

Service
To say it in short it was slow. We were there from 9pm until 11:15pm and not by virtue of us hanging around and chatting. It seemed we had to continually stay on the waitress to place our orders from drinks to entrees. All of us there have worked in the service industry in some way over the years, from bartending to waiting tables to catering. We get a busy Saturday night. I don't know what else may have been going on, but she did the bare bones basics to get our orders placed and food received.

In addition, the small plates came out in an odd order. One of my friends received the salad she ordered first, then her soup and entree together second. Many of us ordered the soup as well, but all the rest of us received it first and then two other items second (which included salads for many of us). There was little rhyme or reason to what came out first. When the second round of items came out, one of my friends had not received anything. We were waiting since these items seemed to be coming out in short waves. The waitress came over to the table seeming to be oblivious, chirping ""So how does everything taste?"" Maybe because it was so dark she couldn't see that none of us touched our food. We pointed out that our friend's plates were missing. She said nothing and left for ten minutes and then emerged with the entrees without anything else to say. No apology or acknowledgement that it happened.

Food
The food itself was okay. We were all excited about what we ordered and the creative combinations of flavors written on the menu. The french onion soup was definitely a crowd pleaser and as others have mentioned, the kale salad was exceptional. I had the quail egg benedict that was really delicious, with a light hollandaise and on a bed of crispy potatoes. The quail eggs, being small, was a perfect fit for their small plates concept. I did notice that the eggs were poached unevenly, with one with a solid yolk and the other with the more expected soft yolk. A friend ordered the flat bread pizza that was described as mediocre with little flavor. She couldn't get others to even try the remaining half she had left. The roasted cauliflower also has little flavor despite being described to have a chili sauce and garlic. Surprisingly, it had broccoli mixed in (not described on the menu). 

Considering with drinks and three plates we each spent $70, it just struck us that the plates on the whole were not satisfying on top of lackluster service and an ambiance that made ordering and socializing a bit frustrating. If you are between Crush and elsewhere, I recommend you try something else. Not a Vegas must.",XMLsQh_TiADivLYLpN7FJQ,0,0,2,Lo4xtllBjp-458rYMfyYkQ

The overhaul of the former Nobhill space in the MGM Grand has resulted in a dark, intimate atmosphere perfect for a date night yet casual enough for a group gathering. The menu has plenty of shareable, small portion items along with larger entrees. We started by ordering two items while deciding what else to order. 

First to arrive at the table was a dense, bland ricotta gnocchi. The only saving grace of the dish was the braised short rib. Following that was a date and artichoke pizza with hints of heat and sweetness making up its profile. A decent dish for sure, but the somewhat underwhelming start to the meal quickly turned into the end of our meal as we decided not to order more.

I had the barrel-aged old fashion. Too many ice cubes. Tasted like bourbon on ice with a cherry. $16. I'll pass. It also took over 10 mins to get our cocktails after we ordered them. 

As far as the food goes. Ordered the French onion soup to start. Again, took a long long time to come out (and it's a slow time - 630pm). Soup tasted good, although very watery. Presentation was awful.

No bread or anything for the table and the waitress Mariel, rarely came around. 

Main course took an excessive amount of time to come out. Meanwhile, no waitress in sight. 

Main course was the Rigatoni in Bolognese. Pretty good, however it came out only warm, not hot. Waitress didn't check on us again.

3869210,2014-03-18,2,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"Situated where Nobhill used to be is a new Michael Morton tapas joint. I immediately noticed the decor, I kinda felt like I was at winery in Napa. White washed wood covers from the floor to the ceiling, candles lit on the borders of the ceiling, the tables and chairs made to feel like a sleek outside dining experience. 

Our server was quick to get our drink orders. They had a pretty decent hand crafted cocktail menu. The one that caught our eye was the Punch, Drunk, Love: mint infused Hendricks Gin, Lillet Rose, Fresh Watermelon Juice and Fresh Lime Juice. I suggest if you are going to have more than one drink (trust me, it's delicious, you will want more than one) you should share the family style, it comes in a carafe. 

Sticking to the idea of shared plates, we decided against doing an entree and just ordered a bunch of the tapas. 

Roasted Cauliflower appetizer-this was good, maybe a little heavy on the red  wine vinegar, I wish we would've tried the Cauliflower Mash instead. 

Sea Scallop Benny-Sunny side quail egg, chorizo and chipotle hollandaise. This was excellent. The flavors were very unique.

Octupus Ceviche- Grapefruit, Pickled Jalepenos. This was pretty good, I think I liked the Taro Chips more than the ceviche though.

Ricotta Gnocchi- Braised Short Rib and Pea Puree. Awesome. It's no wonder this is one of their signature dishes. The short ribs were so tender. Get it.

Littleneck Clams- Coconut Chili Broth. These were good, the broth was a little salty for me, but thankfully the coconut did mellow out the salt. Ask for an extra piece of bread to dip into the broth. 

This place is a little pricey, comparable to La Cave. The tapas are definately not sharable for more than two people.  Everything was pretty good, including the service. They also have a vegan menu.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,8,3,4,PAw7hJgXj3QD8Y78BrItag

My server brought a menu and a water glass was filled.  The server stopped by again and asked about drinks and I ordered my usual iced tea which was soon brought.  My dinner consisted of three tapas plates--octopus ceviche with grapefruit and pickled jalapeño, shrimp risotto with a tomato fondue and arugula, and ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée.  For dessert, I got the chocolate makeout--a warm chocolate fondant with salted caramel cream, peanut brittle, and caramel sauce.

The octopus ceviche was very good.  The dish had a good citrus flavor from the grapefruit and the pickled jalapeños added a good contrast.  Served with the dish was a small amount of corn chips which I ate along with the octopus.

The shrimp risotto was OK.  There was nothing special about the dish.  The shrimp were large but the dish as a whole lacked any wow factor to make the whole standout.   The shrimp were also a bit chewy.

Last was the ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée.  I really liked this dish. The short rib was very tasty as opposed to the bland ricotta gnocchi and there was no discernible taste of the pea purée at all.  Still, I liked the flavor of the short rib and the softness of the gnocchi made a good fit.

Dessert was the chocolate makeout--almost a chocolate lava cake but mercifully not another rendition of this ubiquitous dessert.  The chocolate fondant was rich and I could have piped the salted caramel cream directly into my mouth.  The peanut brittle and small amount of caramel sauce added texture and flavor to the dessert.

Service was varied.  The iced tea was brought with no sugar or other sweeteners.  When the server came by one time, he stopped and then asked if I  had wanted any sugar.  I asked for some artificial sweetener which he never brought.  After he went by a few times, I stopped a busser and asked him and I had a container of sweeteners in no time at all.

When it came time for dessert, a different server stopped by and asked me if I wanted dessert.  I ordered from her.  After dinner, the original server brought my check and took payment.

The server didn't ask if I needed anything explained from the menu nor did he mention more than one off menu special.  The other server mention a couple of them to the tab;e next to me and asked them if they had been to the restaurant before.  She then went on to describe some of the dishes and told the people if there were any other questions to ask her.  I think maybe she should have been with me the whole time.  The bus persons were very efficient and removed finished plates in a timely manner.

Crush is OK.  Your paying Strip prices for some average food.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,7,3,tE9rjwvHZ4mQBwCTOSulKw

We had eight girls and I easily made reservations through OpenTable about a week before, and then had to push the res back 30 minutes at the last minute. They were very accommodating.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous like most restaurants in the hotels on the strip. The ambiance felt romantic and intimate. The lighting was dim, but not too dark.

Everything on the menu sounded super amazing, so we decided to share everything. We ordered three flatbread pizzas (wild mushroom, grilled chicken, and the curry shrimp) - they were all really good, but my favorite was definitely the mushroom. It had the right amount of cheese and mushrooms were yum!

The kale salad was also a hit too. The arugula salad was a close second. Other notables included the octopus ceviche and ricotta gnocchi (very generous portion of the braised short rib!)

Surprisingly, that was enough food for the eight of us, and we were VERY satisfied with the whole meal, and the price! It came out to less than$20 per person for all that good food. We didn't get drinks because we were fine with water, but the cocktail menu looked pretty delightful.

Because our friend had a flight to catch we were here very early. And that's a good thing: happy hour!! Good value for money on alcholic beverages.

The concept consists of small bites of which you need 2 or 3 depending on how hungry you are. And don't forget to ask for the vegetarian options. They have a whole menu when you ask for it! My suggestion: put it on the normal menu. More and more people or no vegetarians but choose to eat less meat. And the options are good. 

My girlfriend and I both ordered the onion soup. Hot, hot, very hot and average in taste.The vegetarian risotto was perfect. Cooked to perfection. Nice taste. My husband ordered the meatballs. Nice, but he missed the spaghetti or some bread.

Not a place I would go for an nice evening out, but definitly a place I would visited again for a quick bite before going to a show or an evening on the town.

I had the scallops Benny, which were extremely tasty. The ricotta gnocchi which is definitely all about the rib is very tasty as well, I could eat a couple orders of this just for the delicious flavor. The octopus ceviche was good, it was light and refreshing, but I can't say that it is a must have. The angus mini burgers were good, but again not anything totally special, I love blue cheese so I think I liked them a little better than most people because they had a strong blue cheese flavor. 
The service was fine. It seemed like the main server is spread a little thin, but she did a good job. It was kind of weird that a younger woman came to our table and introduced herself as the co server, and then I saw her just kind of hanging out by the bar talking with coworkers the whole night while her ""partner"" took every order, and dealt with all of the clients. Maybe she wasn't really a co server and just said she was to greet/buy the main server some time.

However, myself and my mother ordered off the vegan menu and after having been blown away by the vegan menu at both Aria's Blossom and Encore's Wazuzu, we had the same expectations for Crush. We were so disappointed. We ordered the risotto, tofu and Gardein chicken. Our food was bland and lacking creativity. The carrot miso broth for the tofu was lovely but there wasn't enough of it to call it broth, and $18 for the Gardein chicken was a ripoff. I buy this meat analog all the time and prepare it better myself. If you're going to incorporate a vegan menu, you have to do better than simply opening up a package and dumping it on the plate. For people unfamiliar with this product it might pass, but if you're catering to vegans, you can't serve the ""chicken"" that way and call it good. We also asked for salt and pepper because of the lack of flavour and by the time it arrived our food was cold. 

The vegan menu definitely needs a re-do and the chefs should take a cue from the restos at Wynn/Encore.

 Coming into the place, it's not super big, but has a cool vibe. There's a big hanging swing chair in the corner that I'm sure people love to take selfies in.  From what I remember all around food was decent, although someone had some type of fish plate and it did not look or smell fresh.

  The one thing that really irked me and several others was that they couldn't seem to understand what a medium rare steak was.  First we get well done, then when we tell the waitress that the cook is wrong, she looks at it and goes oh is it not done enough.....no it way over done.  Then the guy running the joint is like ya well those are cooked medium rare, but I'll cook more for you myself.  Super condescending, I wanted to Google medium rare and shove it in his face.  So they come out, and the inside is almost raw to rare. At this point I'm like whatever, I'd rather have it be undercooked, and  I'm starving.  The overall flavor of the dish was fine, and the desserts at the end were very good, but bottom line, if you serve steak at a high end spot on the strip know how to cook it, and do a better job a client recovery.",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,1,1,3,H2lzDOzy4N8Nm0LTv41O2w

The surf and turf our main dish the filet was over cooked but not enough to send it back and the lobster was over cooked and very salty. The California wine flight was perfect.

Started out with attitude from hostess when we requested a place that had more light. Had to ask for a third menu even though we had told Angeli the server we had a third person. Had to ask for steak knife for filet entry and pepper for gnocchi. Had to remind Angeli to remove returned gnocchi from bill. Lastly we had mentioned both in reservation and when we showed up that we were celebrating two birthdays yet nothing came of it (although other party did have candle, etc.).  Bottom line I shouldn't have to do or remind staff what their job their job is. 

Ahi Tuna had good flavor but I always feel that sesame seed encrusting detracts from the tuna. Gnocchi was least favorite with the ricotta gnocchi having now flavor and the meat being so salty that we had to return it. Halibut was good but sauce again salty even though kale wasn't. Filet was was best of the bunch with being properly cooked. Was so frustrated with service we didn't bother to choose alternate entree to replace gnocchi and skipped desert (later had peanut M&M which didn't need being reminded how to do their job). 

Paid while holding our noses giving minimum tip (should have been zero percent).  Told the manager who seemed frustrated. Great news that there are so many choices on the strip like In & Out, White Castle, Subway, etc. that will give superior service.",GBfOPFlKzRXRAkQUJ1K_6A,0,0,1,jnJIbRO61OgtGfxK8_7Utg

The room is quite dark. We were sat on time per our reservation. While the food is good, I think it is priced high for what you get.

Given the tapas style I was able to try several options.
Salt & Pepper Frites come with a garlic aioli, romesco dipping sauce. The fries have good flavor, and the sauce makes them even better. This is a good sharing option.

Mixed greens comes with prosciutto, pine nuts and a cider vinaigrette. This is not ideal for sharing, but the portion is good for one so that is ok.

We tried a few of the wood fired pizzas. They were all tasty. The crust had good texture and flavor. The sauce was tasty and the toppings were solid. These are great for sharing.

I also tried the Hand Cut Beef Carpaccio. It comes with petit watercress, shaved radish and garlic & parmesan aioli. This was a solid choice. It could have used a little more flavor, but was ok.

Located inside the MGM, Crush MGM feels like a chill modern contemporary American bistro, the ambience is cool and chill, it has a classy vibe but not uptight, Our server couldn't have been more delightful (Thanks Natalie) the starters and the main dish -satisfyingly good.

For starters we had an order of Cheese Steak Dumplings (4) and a basket of Crispy Shrimp, The dumplings were delicious, the steak inside these little buns were beautifully seasoned, drizzled it with the fondue on the side and you got yourself a delish bite size starter. The Crispy Shrimp is okay, it really needs the lemon aioli served on the side as it helps adding a different layer of flavor to this otherwise plain fried goodies.

For the main course, I opted for the Charred NY Sirloin - Medium Rare, the steak had a good char but kept the delicious juices of this cut, perfectly done, deliciously seasoned, I love how the vegetables served with this dish was prepared, truffle port reduction which made the mushroom taste really good! My brother had the bbq baby back which he demolished with the help of our bros! (It's a very generous serving) my friends had the Shrimp risotto and the chicken fettuccine which by way of judging ones plate, they also enjoyed! Hahaha

With such delicious selections a good bottle of wine is in order! After reviewing their vast selection of reds, I decided to go for the Louis Latour Pinot Noir --- this wine is so forgiving and complimentary it's shame to waste a single drop- it was a hit!

Surf n turf.. which was $52. 2/5. First of all we ordered it medium rare. It was dry and closer to medium well. The shrimp was also the tiniest portion I've ever gotten when ordering surf n turf. 

Sea scallops benny 3/5. Okay. Love hate relationship with this. I loved the scallops and the sear on the scallops were perfect. BUT, why ruin it with chorizo and potatoes underneath? The chorizo was extremely salty and not needed at all.

Tuna 2 ways 3/5. I don't understand why there's so much bacon in the tuna. Over powering and not needed as well. It easily could be done without it. The tuna with ponzu was good but I didn't like the seared tuna at all.

Rock shrimp 3/5. Desperately needed some lemon. Very very bland. I had to ask for lemon to eat it. I feel lemon should be put in it or at least served on the side.

I sat at the bar, and the bartender immediately greeted me. I ordered a glass of wine, roasted chicken, and mashed potatoes. I was trying to be relatively healthy (save the mashed potatoes), so I wasn't expecting to really like the chicken, but it was perfectly cooked. I'm also weary of roasted chicken at restaurants, but this was flavorful and juicy. The mashed potatoes were amazing. Creamy and free of lumps. If I wasn't in public, I probably would have licked the bowl.

It was a little pricey for what it was, but since it's Vegas, and I wasn't paying, I won't hold it against them.

Service was great and I liked the ambiance. Would definitely return.",IZKX8BHHjS8YwHIVi9KJ2g,0,0,5,2z5IRORUqtfrA3K-_qzhag

Very cool, trendy looking restaurant with romantic lighting.  Tapas sizes, so you get to try a bit of everything!

The reason why I came here :

Sea Scallop Benny ($18): Quail Egg, Chorizo & Chipotle Hollandaise. This was EXCELLENT and even better than expected! I really liked the subtle spice to the dish as well.  Recommended!

Ricotta Gnocchi ($16): Braised Short Rib & Pea Puree. This was also delicious! I really enjoyed the short rib and gnocchi combination. The ricotta breaks down the ""beefy"" flavor and creates a more CREAMY consistency. Great!

Salt & Pepper Frites ($9): Garlic Aioli & Romesco Dipping Sauce. I LOVE garlic aioli and french fries even more! Of course this was delicious lol.

Hamachi ($15): Yellowtail, Cucumber, Yuzu Vinaigrette & Chili Threads. This was great, with good quality hamachi and a non-overpowering yuzu flavor.

Angus Mini Burgers ($15): Buttermilk Blue Cheese, Balsamic Onion & Fried Quail Egg. I enjoyed the Blue Cheese burger best personally. All cooked to medium-medium well though, so a bit over for my tastes.

And to finish, the Nutella Squeeze Ice Cream Sandwich ($9): Chocolate Whipped Cream, Nutella Cream & Carmelized Hazelnut. You already know this was good! Just do it already :P

Great place for date night, and one of the better priced spots in MGM, bang for your buck wise!  Check it out :)",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,4,0,4,yFbhqVp8Uc-SA0IqIA4ESQ
5229168,2017-11-17,0,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"What an awful experience! 

Came here for my BF's birthday dinner ONLY because we had Cirque the Soleil tickets for 9:30pm and this was the only place close to the theater, that had available reservations at 7:30pm which should have given us ample time to eat.

We ordered a couple of cocktails and for appetizers, their heirloom tomatoes and crispy shrimp. 

We ordered our main entrees. Mine came out first, the gnocchi. 25 mins go by and he (the birthday boy) still didn't get his, I had started nibbling at this point. Another 15 mins, still waiting on the birthday boy's entree. Still nothing. 

Flagged the waiter down and I guess he didn't originally hear or placed his order?! Wow, okay. Anyway, assured us at that point that he would order it and it would be super quick! 

20 mins later, I was done eating at this point and excused myself for the restroom and 10 mins later... go back to the table and still no food?

WTH. 

Waiter kept zooming passed us (he was managing a few tables) and I guess he saw the look on my face because he stopped to say, ""Still nothing?"" I shook my head. Really guys?! Get it together. 

Finally, after another 15 mins; I just told the waiter to pack his food ""to go"" since I didn't want to be late for the show. I ate but the birthday boy didn't.

When I asked for the check, I explained to the waiter that we were here for a birthday celebration and why I was upset. There was no sincere apology and he made no attempt to remedy the situation. 

Thanks for ruining his birthday dinner, guys. Never again, at this place.

With a menu slightly more interesting than the average casino based small plates concept it was on the invitation of a friend that I sat down for a public relations sponsored meal at MGM's Crush and with the kitchen clearly catering to the head of the table as Chef DeMarco sent out several plates intended to impress the results were largely passable, a few hits amidst several 'safe' presentations that had us all discussing the sweetbreads comments from the film ""Chef.""  Obviously intended to wow the millennial crowd with a large menu of cocktails and 'tapas' to be shared, the restaurant itself is of the loud variety and with high ceilings paired to minimal décor the long room echoes with the sounds of I Heart Radio as a youthful staff proves exceedingly efficient with excellent knowledge of the menu and recommendations thankfully far more useful than the typical ""everything is good.""  Low in lighting aside from the lounge in back it was with an exceedingly refreshing cocktail that the meal began and although not entirely inventive both the soup and salad that followed were impressive in their own right, the woodsy vinaigrette particularly memorable in its ability to upgrade an ingredient offered on almost every menu in town.

Moving next to several items selected by the table before progressing to those sent out by the chef both the risotto and the scallops proved competent, if underwhelming, while the lamb meatballs were clumsy and off-balanced without a bit of funk - the lone standout of the group a stunning ceviche with heat and acid surrounding supple cephalopod paired to crisp chips with slight sweetness making all the flavors pop.

Impressed by buttery flatbread beneath bright sauce that melded spiced meatballs to briny cheese it was actually the creamy crushed fingerlings that proved the best plate of the next round while overcooked salmon and steak both proved par for the course, the oft-raved gnocchi rounding out the savories with exceptional tenderness amidst hearty short ribs and au jus that entirely unfortunately overwhelmed any semblance of nuance that might have been added from pureed peas.

Always happy to over-order desserts it was with a trio of sweets that the meal wrapped up and while the $12 ""Sweet Elvis"" lived up to its name without any discernible savory notes added by the bacon both the 'signature' Squeeze and unfortunately named ""Makeout"" faired far better - the former surprisingly subtle with no lack of textures and temperatures in play while the later was decidedly dessert-like, a not-quite molten center avoiding tired nomenclature and instead eating like sticky toffee pudding with slight salinity keeping richness in check.

Backed by The N9NE Group and clearly gunning for the cocktail crowd without taking too many risks with the cuisine Crush serves its purpose and fills the small-plates niche for the MGM Grand admirably, its best utility likely as a place for drinks before KA for those unwilling to shell out the cash for L'Atelier and seeking an environment more trendy than what is offered at TAP; a lot of style, a bit of substance, and a bill befitting its location.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,3,_BYNE1Xfocn2EuF1rrmoDA

5417500,2016-11-21,0,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"Crush is a fantastic dinner spot, located in the MGM Grand. We came in just after landing, and overall it was a good way to start our Vegas weekend.

Ambience/decor/space is amazing. The outside does not do it justice. The ceiling is high, and there are a ton of plants that soften up the whole fake-stone effect. The decorations also give the place an intimate, trendy feel. I think it would be a perfect date-night spot, as it's very romantic. That said, I came with two girlfriends to kick off one of their birthday celebrations.

Starting with the positives, the food is FANTASTIC. Their ricotta gnocchi was insanely good-MUST try for everyone that can. It comes with delicious braised rib plopped on top of the delicious noodles and was easily my favorite dish of the evening, possibly the entire Vegas trip. The lobster mash was yummy but wayyy too buttery; I would have liked to taste the lobster more. The filet mignon was also predictably delicious; not revolutionary like the gnocchi, but a solid dish nonetheless, and prepared beautifully. We also had one of their flatbread pizzas - something with mushrooms - and it was very good as well. Since it was my friend's birthday, our waiter made sure to send over a dessert that included a small cheesecake bite (delicious) and some sort of chocolate mousse thing. The dessert itself was okay (more than acceptable for a comped birthday dessert), but the presentation was gorgeous and included a chocolate ""happy Birthday"" sign that I thought was a really nice touch. Overall, food was FANTASTIC and absolutely something foodies in Vegas should try to make a stop for.

**Major KEY Alert** They have an extensive allergen menu outlining Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, Vegetarian, Vegan, and other selective diet options. While I eat pretty much anything and everything, Celiac's disease (severe gluten intolerance) runs in my family, and because of that I have a unique appreciation for how hard it can be for those who have it to eat out, especially on vacation when getting violently ill is the last thing you want. My mom is always embarrassed to have to ask for a separate menu or grill the waiter for gluten-free options because she feels like she's being high maintenance and/or a pain in the ass. Crush includes these diet options on their menu they hand to everyone, making diners feel very comfortable finding something they can eat, which I think is a HUGE plus. Thank you, Crush, for your sensitivity - I will be bringing my family here at some point.

Okay, now the explanation for the star off - the drinks. Since we were heading out to the clubs that night and planned to imbibe a fairly impressive amount of liquor, we wanted to keep our drinks simple and for this reason didn't order any of the fancy drinks. My friend ordered a greyhound (Grapefruit juice/vodka) and I ordered an Old-Fashioned, and both were so watered down that I asked our waiter, Joey, if he would mind splashing some more alcohol in them. I legit couldn't taste anything but bitters in my drink. Old-Fashions are fairly standard drinks, so I had the expectation that while it might not be the star of Crush's menu, it was absolutely reasonable to assume I could get a decently balanced drink. Even after the ""extra"" alcohol, I still only took two sips because I didn't want to drink a cup full of bitters. My other friend's MacCallan 12 was perfect, but that was a drink that required no mixing, so there you go. Maybe the bartender was having an off night, maybe it's not normal, but all three of us were annoyed enough that I knocked off a star for it.

Back to good stuff - our waiter, Joey, also deserves a HUGE shout-out, because he was amazing. Attentive but didn't overly hover; tried to fix our drinks when we mentioned the issue of them being watered down, and made sure to make sure it was a memorable birthday celebration for my girlfriend. I would absolutely return largely because of his efforts, as his service and personality softened the drink issues. He also brought out some shots for us for my friends' birthday (some sort of gummy bear type shot - super sweet, but not unbearable).

Must-try for the stellar food, friendly and professional waiters, and wonderful atmosphere - just get your drinks somewhere else.",ONAC8zv6KUlnx1EAyRZbmA,0,0,4,-LRkyJ_uEGIItaaYpRvzBA

We were staying at the Signature at MGM, so Crush was just a few moving walkways away. We had made reservations for our anniversary dinner, and showed up just after 8pm on a Monday. The host greeted us warmly and seated us at our table. I had mentioned in the reservation that it was our anniversary, so she seated us in a beautiful, quiet corner booth that had an amazing view of the entire restaurant. Cobblestone floors, rustic wooden tables, lush greenery, and super cool Edison bulbs to give the place a dim, warm glow. Our waitress approached us within seconds of sitting down to give us our menus, explained the tapas-style ordering strategy (2-3 dishes per person), and took our drink order. A couple minutes later, she returned to take our food order. Great service and timing on her part. Okay, onto the food: 

First up was the heirloom tomato salad. Fresh tomatoes, amazing Buratta cheese, basil pesto and balsamic vinaigrette. Pretty much a high-quality, super-delicious Caprese salad. Get it.

Next was tuna, two ways. On the right was a citrusy, ponzu-soaked tuna tartare. On the left was a creamy, sweet seared tuna with avocado cream. Alternate bites between the two and you have an amazing balance of flavors. If you like sushi, get it.

Then came the gnocchi. Wow. It tasted like your grandma's pot roast and potatoes, but in gnocchi form. Pulled short ribs on top of pillowy ricotta gnocchi with hidden pockets of mushed peas. A burst of flavor with every bite. Get it.

Finally, the sliders. This was the highlight of the meal for both my wife and me. I never knew a mini-burger could taste this good. Soft brioche bun, medium-rare burger, creamy bleu cheese, caramelized onions and fried quail egg to top it off. These were so good we were fighting about who gets the last one. Seriously, get it.

And right when we thought our meal was over, someone from the kitchen brought us dessert, compliments from the chef for our anniversary! It was a milk chocolate semi-freddo with caramel sauce, nuts and freshly whipped cream. Had the perfect balance of sweet and salty. Get it!

All in all, it was one of the best experiences we've had in a Vegas restaurant. Great attention to detail, good value for the quality of food, and an awesome celebration of our anniversary. Thanks, Crush. You crushed it.",NEDJPw9-_mjhMTj-NZMklA,2,0,5,tbJG5Vh1WExcc995nD7omQ

Seabass was also good but again on the small side.  It also had a weak flavored chutney on top that seemed more like a cheap pace picante sauce.  The lobster mash was a cold, small serving and without much flavor and the creamy spinach wasn't even edible... seemed like cold canned Popeye spinach doused in elmers glue.

For food, we shared a bunch of appetizers. Rock shrimp, fries, philly cheese dumplings, meatballs and a couple other things.  The MGM Grand does not have the full menu for Crush on their website so I could not look back to see what I ate.  Having an incomplete menu on the website does not sell the restaurant well.

Location
In the MGM near the rainforest cafe.

Staff/service 
Very professional and friendly. The hostess sat us and immediately our server followed up in a respectable amount of time. When the bill came, we paid in cash and cards. They was an error on the amounts charged, $78 vs. $48 per person. The server was very apologetic and rectified the error with quickness.

Bathroom
Only one toilet in one room. It's really an inconvenience. I seriously had to wait till the cleaning guy was finished, sad times.

Food
Wasn't feeling that hungry but ordered the lam meatballs. They were satisfying but probably should have opted for something else. As I glanced at my friends items, the portions were rather small.

Drink
Order a Macallan neat with a splash of water. Always recommended.

If you're looking for a tasteful small serving dish with an accompanying fine glass of wine or neat spirit, come here. If you're looking for that ""average"" American meal, this place may not be for you.

They said this is only for people sitting at the bar and refused to give us any other opportunity. We felt it was completely unfair, especially because other upscale and nice restaurants actually accommodated us , by giving us alternative table. It's just either you are nice to your customers or you are not!!!",HZuDthXru8wylQVSOkrDqg,0,0,1,Pr6qNF3jX7iDJAUp0AOsvg
5779353,2015-08-25,0,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"Stopped in this past Friday night for a family birthday dinner and looked forward to the small plate format for sharing. With only a few exceptions I found the food excellent, although price/value was off. 

Reservation/Atmosphere - The hostess was very pleasant and they were prompt to seat us for our reservation. We had a table toward the back and really liked the vibe of the place. Comfortable seating.

Service - At first they gave us the sommelier as our waiter. At first I thought it was just for drinks but then he stayed to start our order. He was pushy & annoying, had to tell him to pump the brakes and let us look at the menu. Shortly later we had a regular waitress and she was very good.

Food - The food was very good but some were overpriced even by Vegas standards. The only plate(s) that I would say were not very good were the pizzas. The chicken pizza was flavorless, both the crust and toppings. The sausage has flavor but it was driven by the peppercini's they dropped on the top. Stay away from the pizzas. The Roasted Broccoli was very good but way way overpriced for what they delivered for a veggie dish. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was very good but they only give you four shrimp, again, way over priced. The Hanger Steak special was good but the marinade was over powered by citric acid. The highlight, and I'd go back just for this dish, was the Gnocchi with braised short rib. It has a ton of flavor from the short ribs & sauce. It was an outstanding dish.

I'd go back, but just be cautious about which dishes I ordered.",nYCuT2XuhFvxgg7906-wyg,0,0,4,pIMe-zrNViSWQ4dqhQSMag
5796791,2014-08-10,0,gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,"Paid a visit here after the JT concert on Friday night - best decision all weekend. Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.

The ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.

Our waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey.",2VRkBZBS5FO_N7yBRWfaLA,0,0,4,6mpdexlJQ-4WVjPw40xhog

Came in tonight around 6-6:30pm for a casual dinner. I love the style here - tapas/shareable portions of creative and delicious food! We ordered the short rib gnocchi, shrimp risotto, French fries and a date and artichoke wood fired pizza with jalapeño peppers. Honestly, Everything was amazing. Food came out within 10 minutes, service was excellent, and they got us in right away even in the busy CES convention craziness. The pizza and short rib were my absolute favorite.",0EQlpgEQVTxCeKd7CbetdQ,0,0,4,JwQpkQ5tpMlaZoJ3p_a_tg

$10 margherita pizza & $5 drinks at happy hour. The space is upscalish yet surprisingly comfy. We loved the chairs at the bar, they were big and soft! 
No lame bar stools here. The bartenders were more than friendly and a few of them (and the somm) may entertain you with a game called ""snaps"".
Just ask about it, it was so much fun!
Report back to me if you do!
On to the food- my sea scallop benny (a take on scallops Benedict) features Sunny-Side Quail Egg, Chorizo and Chipotle Hollandaise. Yum! Was a little salty but huge points for innovation! My cousin had the margherita pizza which was very flavorful! 
For dessert, we had the creme brulee threesome (vanilla, pistachio, coffee) also yum! and a chocolate something with ice cream. 
One of the better experiences I've had at a ""mega"" casino bar/restaurant and also one of the few places I'd be willing to venture to the Strip for!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,0,4,XagxW4fAhu6TAYkOaF0dkg

Some of the ""small plates"" are larger than others, but if you eat alot and don't want to break the bank ordering 10 tapas, go with their regular size entrees",uIB8qFzG5E3PUGfiCiUmqg,1,0,5,8SNsRHThzehvXlT-6t9j-g

My friend and I were looking for a quiet place to enjoy a few glasses of wine and a light but delicious bite to eat. Crush was exactly what we had in mind. It has great ambiance, active but quiet and a wonderful contrast to the bright lights, noise and pace of the Casinos and strip.

It was so dang tasty! It was not overly sweet, as you might imagine. It had a perfect blend of tastes. I crave it all the time. The specialty cocktails were very expensive for drinks. My friends had a mango mohito, and said that they were awesome. The service was good. The atmosphere is great. It was very busy at all, which I couldn't understand, but it was overall a great experience. Highly recommended for a reasonably priced, nice meal (reasonably prices for Vegas, that is).",_B1VdKkbqU7mrCuuTslNGA,0,0,4,bzhHKuXrMPTtx4uL27jJow
