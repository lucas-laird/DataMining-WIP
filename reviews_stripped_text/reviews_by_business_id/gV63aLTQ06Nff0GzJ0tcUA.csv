The service was more than incredible. We felt like rich people being serviced. It was an incredible experience! They provided us with sample food & we ordered an appetizer before our main course. It was plenty of food, all of it more than gourmet. It was exceptional.

The whole experience was just amazing & I highly recommend this place again & again.",LoTj1vS41ifdRPlXcS-URg,1,0,5,TpUFf_xtK8LJKMxmPE5DzA
47502,2008-09-16,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I'm going to go with the 3.5 stars as well.

We walked in without a reservation and got a great window seat right away.  I really did like the room, it worked and was warm.  

I had the asparagus soup which tasted well nothing like asparagus but it was a winner because the scallop in it was fabulous.  There was also a potato puree involved.  For my entree I had the salmon with crab, bearnaise  sauce, fingerling potatoes and asparagus.  Now my fault for ordering the asparagus soup with potato puree and then having repeat ingredients on my entree.  It kind of peeves me when restaurants have repeat ingredients.  It's a personal thing.  I kind of instantly found the bearnaise sauce a little cold but moved on.  

The food was good, old school good.  Like it reminded me of something I'd have years ago at dinner.  Classic French, but I did like it!

I found the service a little stuck between two different places. They tried to give good, fine dining service but I found these little upsells that I wasn't really buying into.  Like coming over and trying to sell us a Cognac flight after we both said we didn't drink Cognac.  Weird.  Also giving us INSANE pours of our wine.  Who does that?  We won't drink me just because it is in our glass.  

Lastly, the cheese plate seriously needs to be worked on.  Great concept but really generic cheeses.  There were about 7 different types that were the size of practically my fingernail.  They were things like ""gouda"" and ""white cheddar"" - I have no idea what they were doing on there.  There was also this one cheese that they made look like a flower.  It was HORRIBLE and quite possibly the worst cheese I have ever tried.  

Overall I did like it for a Vegas restaurant.  I could just really do without the little upsells they sneak in or maybe not be so obvious about it.",SJtOYNDTOh6gEjPQyuwHuQ,0,0,4,DrDTTQRyKua7SZRYFOGXpw
48366,2009-12-30,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"My husband took me to Alize on Christmas Eve and it was one of the best presents I have gotten! We are both ""foodies"" and could not wait to try the chef's 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Even the amuse-bouche was delicious and really did it's job of waking up our taste buds. My favorites were the phylo wrapped crab claw, fois gras, and rib eye. The truffle vinaigrette on the spinach salad is something to pay close attention to, they did a very good job of not overpowering with the truffle taste as is so easy to do. 

The staff was extremely warm and friendly, not at all pretentious or stuck up. Our waiter, I think his name was Silvio, extremely professional and knowledgeable. He explained all the courses in just enough detail and also the wine pairings and why they were chosen for that particular dish. We received attention to our table at all the right times and never once needed to look around the restaurant floor wondering where our waiter or busboy was. Of course, who wants to look around the restaurant when you have one of the best views of the strip in all of Las Vegas! We were lucky enough to have a window side table in the corner that faces everywhere from Encore and TI down to Luxor. We also very much enjoyed the classy, elegant atmosphere over some other restaurants that try to be too trendy with loud house music and waitresses wearing lingerie. One more thing to pay attention to on the way to the elevator- the nearly 200 year old bottles of cognac that line the entryway. 

The one downside of Alize is right around 10 PM. you can hear the subtle rumbling of the bass from whatever club is upstairs. Very unfortunate that this is how we had to end our very romantic Christmas Eve dinner. Other than that, I can say nothing other than praise for Alize and their staff.",xzSJVc6lQhOHd9uft-TAAg,0,0,5,-1xZ4Q04qMcDc2xPsQmLaw

Great view but they seated us at a table too small for 4 people and away from the windows.  I brought a nice bottle of wine to share with the group and was surprised at the $50 corkage fee until I saw the overpriced wine list.  Few items under $200 in the red wine category.  My friend and I ordered the venison and it was overcooked and served with a tasteless sauce.  My wife had Roast Duck (a classic French dish) and it was served in a sweet, non-french style sauce.  We all ordered Grand Monier souffles and they were also dull in flavor.

119373,2014-09-27,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Alizé is a very wonderful high-end fine dining experience. Located at the top of the Palms, get a reservation before the dinner rush and around sunset so you can watch the beauty that is the nightlife city coming to life. It was absolutely beautiful. There were storms rolling in and we were able to witness the most amazing lightning show throughout the skyline of Las Vegas. It was definitely a site worth seeing. Although Vegas is not accustomed to receiving such mass amounts of rain, the atmosphere was somewhat ruined due to five full minutes of the National Weather Service blaring overhead to alert guests of flash flood warnings. Atop that, many tables seated close to the windows were forced to move forward a few feet as the windows were leaking and water was dripping on guests, our table included, after I had been dripped on.

That aside, our evening started with the seared foie gras and heirloom tomato risotto appetizers. They were divine! I preferred the risotto with its creamy demeanor over the foie gras as the vanilla béchamel made it quite sweet. All in all, it was a perfect start to our meal.

I ordered a single glass of pinot noir and my company ordered a the special martini of the night. Both were great compliments to our meal. We were served two sequential  bouches between our appetizers and meals, the first a potato tart and the second a lamb jus with a small cream pouf. Together they were delicious.

For our meal we ordered the chicken breast, the duck breast, and the halibut with additional sides of the corn-ricotta ravioli and mixed mushrooms. The chicken breast was quite large, with a salty skin and tender middle. Served atop creamy pesto potato purée with a small side of con jus, together the flavors were perfect. The chicken also came with a short order of asparagus and speck, with two corn and ricotta ravioli. In the end, I could not finish my chicken due to its mass in size and the saltiness of the skin. The duck was served atop foie gras, sautéed spinach and leaks, beside honey-lemon cake and strawberry gazpacho. The flavors were rich, although the spinach was very subtle and lacking. The halibut was served beside two towering Anna potato cakes and truffle foie gras sauce with a drizzle of maitake mushrooms. The fish was flakey and perfectly prepared.

For our last portion of our meal we ordered the vanilla bean crème brûlée, the grand marnier soufflé and warm chocolate fondant. The crème brûlée was fresh, creamy and a delight to consume, garnished lightly with a single blackberry, raspberry and a small halved strawberry.  The soufflé had the warmest lemon sauce throughout and the cake was fluffy and warm. The chocolate fondant was served with strawberry sorbet with a dipped strawberry. 

The service was very attentive, though it looked as though the owner may have been there chatting with the other tables, asking how their meals were and discussing evening plans. Our table was forgotten and never disturbed, which was disappointing. The staff is well mannered and chatty; they take great pride in the unveiling of the dishes with a singular ""voíla!"" as the tops are removed to present the food. One of our waiters that night particularly was very nice, though he seemed nervous, as he continued to spill our water out of our glasses and onto our table cloth, but that is easily looked beyond.

In the end, I was very satisfied. The atmosphere was elegant and classy, with a wide variety of offerings. I would recommend anyone try Alizé at least once.",DhILUyWXSgArbn8afRMafA,0,1,4,UlyolpUZcJwv2cQEOGDCFw

We know it's expensive, around $600, but usually the experience is amazing and worth the expense. The service was terrific and the location is lovely, however I rate the overall experience as 3 stars and really had been hoping for more. The first red flag was that the same wine magically paired with each course, no matter what the choice was, which we found to be a little lazy on the part of the sommelier. The wines were all good, but that taste the wine, taste the food, then taste the wine experience was missing. The food felt a little old fashioned, while it was good, we didn't have the oohs and aahs that we usually experience due to the flavor explosions in our mouths.

While we were waiting we were offered 3 choices of bread. I had the french baguette. It was not warm. I expected better.

I ordered the $135 tasting menu and the St. Andrews cocktail. My boyfriend ordered the lamb entree with the same drink. Our bill was $275. OMG! That's grocery money for almost a month, but we decided to splurge. It was the most expensive meal either of us had eaten. The experience was nice but definitely not something we would do often.



Now on to the food. I am not used to eating like this and could not pronounce a lot of things on the menu. The waiters were helpful in describing what each item was. However I was disappointed in the overall taste of the food as well as the portion sizes. I expected more for the price.  The sauces were what made most of the food edible. Out of the seven dishes I had the lobster and the lamb were the tastiest.

For desert I had the chocolate souffle. I've never had it before and I would not have it again.

After your meal they offer you sweets, which were all tasty.

When I finally received my meal, the gnocchi was in a pan of oil. The duck breast was nearly white it was so over cooked.

When our dinner was served we asked the server to take our picture, he said ""I am serving food when I am done I will take it, guess what ""he never came back.""

208325,2016-04-16,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I simply googled ""French restaurants in Las Vegas"" and turned a Friday date night into a formidable experience to remember. Maybe I should back up just a bit. Background : my girlfriend is studying French and recently finished a very tough exam on the subject which is one of her great passions. Everything French, speaking French, returning to France one day, etc and so on. Many of the conversations we have had about French and her studies have included the idea of dining out in a French restaurant in Las Vegas where she could order in French and speak candidly with someone to build her language skills and boost her confidence a bit. My search engine request, mentioned earlier, lead me to Alize, in The Palms hotel and casino. A wonderful representative, Jana, took my reservation yesterday and confidently explained that Gabriel Fontenier, captain at Alize spoke fluent French and could be requested as our waiter. Once the excitement sank in and marinated, the true beauty began to take shape. 
Starting with our confirmation call Friday afternoon before our 9pm dinner reservation, and confirmation that Gabriel would be able to assist us, leading into our professional greeting both downstairs and upstairs by each hostess when we arrived. Our window side table on the 56th floor, above all things Vegas, was only trumped by the amazing service provided by Gabriel throughout our meal and the incredible food prepared and delivered by such an amazing establishment and staff. I wish I had all of the names of the kind, professional and happy folks we encountered to acknowledge them here, but I digress. One of the most important reasons that people eat out in the first place is for the experience coupled with the service. This is a mark fantastically achieved by Alize. A culture that cultivates an excellent ambiance while remaining unique, professional and, for lack of a better vocabulary, happy. I would love to describe the chef's complimentary Hors d'oeuvres that began our meal in all of their uniquity, however, I am not in French culinary school and I did not take notes like a professional food critic but just understand that they were feats of brilliance with the aesthetic pleasure that sparks a memorable meal. I also forgot to take a picture, lol. They were great. Followed by the French onion soup and market greens, our dinner began gaining some serious momentum. The pace was perfect and really helps you understand some important aspects to fine dining. Our entrees came to the table like a main event at the MGM. All eyes were upon our aged ribeye and rack of lamb selections. Each course was described to us again as it arrived which I felt was a wonderful touch. We really were made to feel comfortable in such a prestigious atmosphere. Professionally treated as we belonged there this evening. The meal was tender and melted on the palette. The combinations complimented each other at every turn. Dessert was followed with coffee and tea and we never felt rushed even after 11pm. I also have to note the wine list and sommelier. I admired the selections and even recognized a few wines but I cannot say that I have ever met such a down to earth and friendly sommelier with such a welcoming smile. His confidence and candor made us feel very easy and at home and I look forward to repeating this entire experience with such an amazing team again in the near future. Thank you to the entire staff at Alize and thank you sincerely to Gabriel for going above and beyond for us on this late Friday evening.

Nonetheless, the ambiance of the restaurant is elegant yet cozy at the same time. The reason for my lower rating is the food was ok. My lobster was tasty but a tad on the creamy side. Perhaps a weekend of decadent food was a bit much for my tastebuds and I wasn't able to fully enjoy the dish. Everything was nice but we weren't wowed, especially with the price you pay and the Michellin rating. The desserts left me wanting more.

Out of all the restaurants I have dined at in Las Vegas, or anywhere for that matter, nothing comes close to the dinner I had at Alize! Located at the Top of the Palms Casino, it brings a classy restaurant to a extremely trendy casino. As soon as I stepped into the private elevator to when I left, the experience was nothing but top class and a meal I will remember for a long time. I e-mailed the restaurant prior to making my reservation to ask if I could have a few items incorporated into the tasting menu and let the Chef choose the rest. They replied the next day and were more than happy to make my requests! I was seated in at a decent table but saw a little table in the corner that look much more comfortable and they were more than happy to move me there! The view is breathtaking! No bad seats in the house! If any couple is looking for a romantic dinner or a guy to pop the question this is the place to do so. Dark and spacious room with a sort of classic look to with large windows surrounding the entire room so every single person has a view of the Strip!

Once I was seated my server Ricardo Hernandez, PLEASE request this server as he gave me the best service throughout the night and the best I have ever received from a restaurant, presented me with my first dish, which was a request, Jumbo Lump Crab with Potato Gnocchi, Smoked Paprika, Mushrooms and Lemon Chive Butter Sauce presented perfectly on a bed of rocks still in the crab shell! OMG words can't even describe how good this dish was. A gift from God is what it was. So melt in your mouth good! Everything just blended so well together and had a silky, rich and smooth taste on the palate! Just try it and you will see what I mean!! 

Next request was the Phyllo Wrapped Anjou Pear with Roquefort Cheese, Spicy Pecans and Pomegranate Vinaigrette. The pear had a nice crispy outside and a sweet taste inside! Pecans added a little spice and the cheese adding a richness to the dish that I loved! Overall a great dish!

I had requested there duck dish but after overlooking there tasting menu of the night I saw it featured there signature Dover Sole dish and I couldn't resist! It consists of Important Dover Sole Sauteed Veronique with Winter Vegetables and Truffle Potato Puree! WOW! Much like the texture of Halibut, this unique and delicate white fish has a mild but yet sweet taste and was a honor to consume such a well respected fish in the culinary world that was prepared just perfectly. The potato puree was the best I've had and the vegetables fresh and cooked perfect as well! Its worth every penny!

Last and final dish before desert was the Rib Eye with Parmesan and Sweet Potato Gratin, Honey Glazed Turnips, Nebrodini Bianco Mushrooms and Horseradish Beef Jus. Steak was cooked perfectly with the juice still flowing out. The Parmesan and Sweet Potato Gratin was sweet and rich and I loved every bite of it. Simple, beautiful, and tasteful dish!

The palate cleanser was a refreshing peach sorbet that was the best sorbet I've had and cleansed my palate perfectly. 

Last and not least the desert trio!!! First was the Carrot Cake with Ginger Brulee which was my favorite! Secound was the Hazelnut Marquis and Chocolate Custard! Third was the Pineapple Fritter with Macadamia Caramel Ice Cream. All were of Oh So Good and rich but portion sizes were perfect making it able for me to eat all three!

I asked the Wine Sommelier, who was a nice fellow named Alain Visinoni , to do a wine pairing throughout my meal and he was spot on letting me try some very great and rare wines that I am now in search of for my own collection! At the end of the meal the Chef came out and introduced himself and I told him congrats on keeping the Michelin Star for 2009 and thanked him for the best meal of my life and he graciously said thank you and invited to dine at Andres downtown before they closed but unfortunately will not make it back to do so but I can't wait to see the adventure that awaits me when I try the one at The Monte Carlo in the feature. Everything about my meal here was perfect. Ricardo was AWSOME, Alain was AWSOME, Food was AWSOME, and the view is AWSOME. The portions were sized perfectly unlike the other restaurants I dined at and was able to enjoy the meal more this way. I was made to feel like the only guest in the room! At the end they present me with a plate of Petite Fours and a mini menu featuring the custom tasting menu along with the wine pairings I had and I left feeling like a King!",zjdNmQTjA6IXQaJZUYYwHg,0,0,5,OMvnMx7rESYUNUDfvplnMw

I had a Sauvignon Blanc and the warm chocolate fondant (I love Chocolate), was good, on par with every other restaurant that offers it....My friend though had roasted pears in a pastry shell with glazed nuts and ice-cream....this dish was Out of this world good....

Cheers to our fabulous French waiter with the Hermes bracelet!

My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary, we bought a travelzoo deal for 2.
We had 6 courses each in total. 

Boyfriend                       Me

Amuse                           Amuse

Vichyssoise                   Hamachi Tartare

Seared Foie Gras          Foie Gras Terrine

Steamed Salmon          Seared Scallop

Duck Breast                  Veal Wellington

Chocolate Souffle         Grand Mariner Souffle

The food was alright, it was the service that was horrific. Apparently because it was our anniversary, they place a key on the table and a card, or so we were told. 

There was a card waiting but no key. We ordered drinks and our courses and the food started to come. In the middle of one of the courses the manager came over and asked where the key was, we said we didn't know and there was never a key there. He said he knew that there was a key there because he placed it there himself. Then he said they are expensive and started to look around saying he would hate to charge the table for it! He was implying I stole this so called key! WTF! 

We had only started on our second course and had already been accused of stealing. I feel as if it was a prejudice or racial attack on my boyfriend and I being a young mixed race couple. Such bullshit. 

I made a point to tell our server assistant (the only person tending to our table) that the manager was incredibly rude and had offended us. He was in shock. 

By the end of the meal a box was delivered. We said we had no key and no way to open it. The food runner said he would send someone over. The server (who really never waited on our table) came to speak with us about the missing key. She apologized and said she didn't know what to do and could understand our frustration. She said she tried to speak with the manager regarding the situation but he ignored her and walked away. Great management skills, huh?

After she left the table he came over to argue with me and continuously accuse me of stealing this key. Why would I steal this key before the box came? Why would I steal it at all? I wouldn't. I didn't. I had no way to open this ""present"" they were trying to give us. How stupid. With him he brought a key (probably the one he forgot to put on the table) to show us what it looked like I guess. We told him we didn't steal it and if he wanted to call LVPD he was more than welcome to. He said to follow him up to the host stand and he would call security.

Security spoke with us and asked us a few questions and then the manager reluctantly took the charge off of our bill. The security guards told us it was a waste of their time to be there and that LVPD would not come out for something so trivial. We ended up paying $70 for the bill, even though we had already paid $145 (not sure if tip was included or what, but the $70 was for 1 cocktail and 1 non-alcoholic drink) and ended up leaving. At this point I was crying. Our anniversary dinner was ruined, not to mention a ""great"" start to my FIRST time in Vegas. I will never go back and will call travelzoo to let them know of our experiences.",kJBxbpCWZmDZ00DiGIJ9CA,2,0,1,SO2HeOHomsJradhg81rJPw

Service 5/5 Perfect from the moment we sat down, until we left. Each course was explained, as was the flavor profile of the wine. Service was all hands on deck, they worked together seamlessly to orchestrate our evening. Fresh silverware at all times, no empty glasses, plates cleared, etc. 

View 5/5 Just the two of us, so we were seated against the south side windows. My wife had the superior Strip view, while I was looking back towards the valley. I was a little envious of the four top tables against the east windows. 

Food 4/5 There were a few items that fell short for us such as the Veal Wellington and Salmon dish. Everything else was spot on though. Lots of thumbs up between the Missus and I as we chewed oh-so-slowly. The lamb chops was the big winner of the evening.  

Value 3/5 It was a lovely evening indeed. But for the money, I would rethink visiting again anytime soon. It was good, but it wasn't THAT good.

We were here with the Travelzoo voucher, and I'd say the food was abysmal. Frankly, lunch earlier that day at Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo was leagues better and cost less than half the price.

Firstly, the 'free' cocktail that came with the set came in a cheap plastic glass, and was so watered down that neither of us finished more than half. The food was equally bland - tasteless, not very fresh, and frankly, difficult to stomach. I really did not know if they were saving the truly good food for people who paid full price for the tasting menu, or if the restaurant really sucked. Truly, even a great chef would not serve disgusting food even if it was a discounted set. It was really hard to believe that the place had a michelin star in 2008 and 2009.

Again, the only reason why this does not get 1 star was because of the phenomenal view (ask to sit by the windows when you place a reservation), and the service.

Located at the top of the Palms Casino, Alize has some of the best views in Vegas. A little more formal than the brasseries on the strip but more relaxed than a high end Joel Robuchon, Alize is a great place for enjoying quality French food.

TIP:  Plan your reservation to eat about 30 minutes before sundown. You will get a view of the city during your appetizer portion and then get to see the city lights at night during your main course and dessert. In addition, ask for a window seat.

Drinks:  We started with a Boulevardier and an Amaretto sour ($12 each). The waitress didn't know what a Boulevardier was but, when she returned with the drink, she said the bartender had known. The first sip tasted great but there was so much ice jammed into the glass that it quickly became diluted. It was the same story with the amaretto sour. The wine list is on an ipad (very modern) and they have a good assortment of wines by the glass.

Amuse-bouche:  We were treated to two sequential bouches. The first was a small square of foie gras with a few dashes of chocolate and a savory sauce. I love foie gras so it is hard to go wrong when serving it. The second was a small cup of beef consomme paired with a cheese roll. Both were delicious and left you wanting more.

Appetizers:  We started with the lobster consomme ($18) and the spinach salad ($19). The consomme had a nice taste of the ocean to it. At the bottom of the bowl was an artichoke and mushroom dumpling to provide a little texture. The spinach salad was sprinkled with small friend onion pieces and topped with duck confit and a fried quail egg. The whole salad was drizzled over with just the right amount of truffle vinaigrette to make all the flavors stand out.

Dinner.  We ordered the duck ($44) and the grilled hamachi ($45). Before serving the duck, they give you a small glass of strawberry gazpacho to start. The dish has several pieces of duck meat topped with a generous portion of seared foie gras. Drizzled around the dish was clear, simple syrup infused with poppy seeds. The combination of the duck meat, liver and sweet syrup was simply delicious. I couldn't stop eating it.  The hamachi was grilled and served on a bed of quinoa and thinly sliced tomatoes. We had also ordered a side dish of lobster thermidor which never came. When we asked the waitress to check into it, she said it was left sitting the kitchen but the chef would not allow her to bring it out as it had grown cold. Whether this was true or not, I don't know, but she apologized and took it off the bill with no problem.

Dessert:  We ordered a grand marnier soufflé and one soufflé de jour which happened to be carrot cake ($15 each). The marnier soufflé was mildly undercooked and slightly wet in the middle but still tasted okay. They also brought over complimentary cups of four brandy marinated cherries as well as a plate of small mignardises (basically seven petit fours).  

All in all, it was a very good dinner. Alize has a kind of endearing quality to it due, I think, to the combination of good food, fantastic views and the unexpected little food surprises. This makes it easy to overlook a few flaws here and there. It is a great local place to take visitors for a gourmet meal that doesn't break the bank.",fzGcwCzSOv_1rLRg89BvRg,3,0,3,erZ5ls_1gHxhnDKuxoGu1g
467538,2012-08-29,2,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Basically - if the cost of this place isn't going to make you stress out ($100+ per person) then it is awesome.  If you are going to sweat the $$$ you probably won't have as great a time.  Also, be ready to settle in for a 1-2 hour dining experience - especially if you get one of the multi-course tasting menus. 

Practically every table has a great view from the top floor of the Palms tower, through glass walls, looking onto a panoramic view of the Vegas strip.  We try to make a reservation for half-an-hour before sunset so we can watch the Vegas skyline transition from daytime to nightime neon. So it is a bit like a dinner and a slow show.

I've been here several times - mostly on the basis that they offer a 5 and 7 course vegetarian menu with optional wine pairings.  This restaurant is great example of how if you let really good chefs be creative, they will create beautiful looking, tasty vegetarian food.  They also modified items on the tasting menu to accomodate my gluten-free wife.

Most recently I took my parents there for their 70th birthday and I knew they would stress the money - even though I was paying - so when I made the reservation, I asked the host to print a menu for our table with no prices on it.",BeOC3q6tyFIl15TjQpvU1A,2,2,5,mnmzBizR5mo-tN0oVuPNZw
468667,2009-02-12,3,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Located on the Palm's fifty-sixth floor, Alizé boasts a nonpareil view of the strip. In fact, I would go so far as to aver that no Michelin star restaurant on the west coast presents a more panoptic landscape. Okay let me stop there before my verbal incontinence leads to any further description of the restaurant's seductively Elysian setting. 

On to the food. With little more than a minute's rumination, we decided on the seven course tasting menu, spending well over two and one-half hours enjoying the boldly flavored fare.

First course: Piquillo pepper stuffed crab with avocado and horseradish cream. The cruciferous cream tamed the crab, and the pepper added a bit more heat and smokiness. Any concern about too much spice was offset by the chilled avocado.

Second course: Duck confit, spinach salad, brioche, quail egg, fried pearl onions, and black truffle vinaigrette. Spinach really lightened what would have otherwise been a dense course. The vinaigrette, too, humbled the unctuous confit and yolk. 

Third Course: Seared foie gras, roasted macadamia nut, orange segments, and poached pears. Speaking of unctuous, the foie quickly became my favorite course - that is until the prime rib arrived. Not only was the liver executed to perfection - properly deveined and perfectly cooked - but who would oppose duck fat in consecutive courses?

Fourth course: Dover sole with assorted vegetables on truffle pomme pureé. This, we were told, is Rochet's signature dish. While delicious and texturally pleasing, I preferred the Daniel Boulud's skate dish. Ordering sole off the a la carte menu will do some serious damage at $67.

A Raspberry sorbet palate cleanser came out and served its purpose as a light and airy treat. 

Fifth course: Prime rib eye, butter glazed oyster mushroom, parmesan and sweet potato gratin. As the server lifted the metallic lid, a wind of butter and rosemary diffused through the air, imparting hints of verdant forests. Pink and tender, the rib eye deserved to serve as the meal's crescendo. The lid became a mixed blessing for my dining companions as the heat steamed the meat, inadvertently overcooking a piece.

Sixth course: Cheese. Roquefort's strength confidently marches right past any aged blue cheese; in isolation Roquefort comes close to overpowering; fortunately, though, several pieces of bread accompanied the course.

Seventh course: Pineapple fritter with macadamia caramel ice cream, hazelnut crusted dark chocolate marquise and espresso custard. With so many distinct flavors, the desserts almost merited individual palate cleansers before traversing the plate's hilly partitions. I strategically decided to finish the espresso custard last, thus obviating the need for coffee.

Went here with my family for our Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a lovely restaurant with stunning views.

However, the dinner was disappointing overall, especially since I had heard so many good things about the chef and Alize.  Perhaps it's because it was Thanksgiving, and it's not like this on other nights, but I don't know.

The service was mixed.  A few odd moments included the waiter not bringing enough soup for everyone during the soup course, the waiter getting very confused and almost combative when we asked for sparkling water for some of us and flat water for some others, and one of our group having to send back their turkey because it was underdone.

The food had both plusses and minuses.  Very good dishes included the salad with huge cubes of bacon, the duck confit starter, some dish that had pork confit, and the turkey confit underneath the cranberry sauce holder (I love confit).  Not so good dishes included the butternut squash soup, the turkey itself which was dry and unflavorful, and the stuffing which had waaaay too many fruits and nuts in it.  I even liked the very buttery baby vegetables on the side more.

Like I said, perhaps it's better on a more typical night, but I wouldn't recommend this place for a special occasion themed-dinner.",n_iMQrrXX29aHbPoQ_NgCg,0,0,3,mq_bbdY46DlwI9tj3bEXtA

527856,2016-02-21,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Please note that I am French myself, and that we visited Alize me and my wife, on Valentine's day, which forced us to take a 5 course prix fixe menu, which ended up being $400 for two, with 4 drinks included.
Reason why Valentine's day was not the best day to come, is that the prix fixe constraint does provide a great romantic experience for the occasion, but yet doesnt provide great value for the food (Tourist trap/ Valentine's day big business)
However below are the pros and cons, regardless of the V-day context:

Pros:
- Great service and attention from the waiters. Highlight: seafood me and my wife were served, wasnt ""fresh enough"" by my standards (PSA: when seafood has the slightest taste/smell of burning alcohol, it is NOT fresh) and after I persevered mentioning it to a second waiter (a first waiter said he would bring it to the chef's attention, but i dont think he did) this one calmly proceeded to explain to me that he was 100% of the freshness of the products served, but that he would take care of it. I later found out that ""taking care of it"" meant giving us a $50 discount on the final bill, and I must say I appreciate this gesture because there is a saying in France that ""the client is always right"", and Alize observed it with class, showcasing the proper business etiquette for a luxury french restaurant.
- the food: this is Vegas, and what we ate for $170 a person, would have been served to us for about $50 in a small town in France. However this is the Vegas premium and I've seen way worse rippoffs than that, hence yes, the food is worth what you pay for, in the context of Vegas. It is good.
- the view: the panoramic view of the strip is amazing

Cons:
- very loud! We ate to the bass growls of the nearby disco (the ghostbar I think?) and while again, this is understandable in the context of Vegas, I don't feel like a restaurant can boast ""a premium dining experience"" or ""luxury"" tag if you can recognize any of the songs playing next door...",WGiWad8DY4b6Zu78Ul61rw,0,0,4,Qi7HNJYMCYFpLJcy8N_k3A

Upon arrival the host escorted us to a corner table for two with the the most BEAUTIFUL view of the strip we have seen to date and definitely set the romantic tone for the evening.  

Sylvano and his team took very well care of us throughout our dinner.  Speaking of Sylvano, he tactfully shared his knowledge of our meal, especially the wine pairings.  Even though I personally wasn't interested in knowing which small french town my Cabernet Sauvignon was cultivated...or the how and why...his genuine enthusiasm and unpretentious service  was very refreshing to come across at this type of a restaurant.

Everyone has different tastes in food and we felt that the food was very very good. Towards the end of our meal we were given a ""congratulatory anniversary gift"" from the restaurant...very nice touch!

Had the restaurant revolved (like Sky restaurant at the Space Needle in Seattle) and the food tasted like that of our favorite french restaurant (Fouquet's in Paris, France) it would of been a perfect evening....but maybe we're asking for a bit much. Lol

Can't wait to come back!

Overall:
3* for food.
5* for service.

Because the food was so uninspiring and at times disappointing,we definitely would not be going back here anytime soon. As a result, I can't bear to award this restaurant more than 3* overall. 

Would recommend tasting menu for:
1) Those who do not like surprising new dishes but would like to stick with classic dishes. 
2) Those who typically like to add salt to their dishes 
3) Those who want a tasting menu experience but are on a time crunch
4) Those that appreciate well-waited service or a beautiful view of the strip 

The more detailed summary:

Food:
I always thought Tasting menus are to sample the chef's more innovative dishes.  None of the dishes were innovative, just dishes you would typically see listed at any typical fine dining establishment.

The evening started off promising with an amuse bouche of seafood ceviche. They also came around with freshly baked bread and the raisin-walnut bread was oh-so-good! However, the first course came out and I was already disappointed. It was basically a dish of nicely sliced melons and tomatoes. I thought ""Did I just pay 1/7 of my $125 on a dish they did not even cook?"" Unfortunately, the dressing it was served with didn't bring out anything more. 

As for the rest of the meal, it was unremarkable. It was basically smaller portions of classical dishes you would see listed on the menu of any typical fine dining establishment. The menu made it appear that they were going to take a new twist on these classical dishes, but that wasn't the case.It was your typical foie gras, risotto, lamb, fish, etc. The sauces they were served with did not add anything either!

What was really surprising was that many of the dishes were overly salty! It wasn't just one, it was quite a few. i don't remember which dishes in particular, because, as I mentioned, this meal was rather forgettable. Also, the fact that we noticed that the sorbet palate cleanser was pre-scooped and refrozen only left more negative memories of this place.

Service:
I know that some people didn't like the service here, but for us personally, it was amazing. It was well-staffed and they went above and beyond what we expected. For example, any crumbs were gently swept off after each course. Our glasses were constantly refilled with water. Also, when I came out of the restroom, my waiter was already by my chair, waiting to tuck me back into the seat. We were surprised at how attentive the service was but at no point did we feel that their attentive eyes were intruding on our privacy. A++++++ for service!

Other notes:
The dishes came out very fast! From the time we checked in downstairs, to when we got on the elevator again after the meal, it took us 2 hours flat (maybe even less!). We felt there was barely time for a breather between dishes. At times, it felt like we either only had time for a quick chat or a sip of water, but not both, before the next dish arrived. We would've appreciated more time to relax, talk, reflect on what we just ate, etc.

The view was spectacular! It had a gorgeous panoramic views: you can see the strip, and you can also see the red rock canyons behind. Too bad they rushed our meal, so we weren't able to stay long enough to see the beautiful night lights illuminating the strip.",Uz4XUWYcMn8qTTtLyqhqnA,0,0,3,CiYK4syiLbLeZYjgOLFKtA

666254,2007-04-10,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"In Las Vegas?  Alize, a long-time fixture of the LV restaurant scene, is a great choice for finely-prepared French cuisine housed on the top floor of the Palms Hotel.  Andre Rochat, the owner and chef brain, has assembled a package of cuisine, service and ambiance that is worth your dining attention in a city chock full of great restaurants.
     With a group, we had the opportunity to graze the menu including specials.  Top of the list:  the veal chop with mushroom canneloni - the best veal chop I have ever had - tender, flavorful and prepared to perfection(including arriving warm on a warm plate).  Other winning entrees were lamb, minute steak, duck confit and dover sole.  All arrived exactly to order with vegetable accompaniments and presented beautifully.  This included the obligatory domed delivery by the experienced serving staff and dramatic(?) undoming by same.
     Appetizers, salads and soups are on a par with the entrees.  A tomato and shrimp timbale, spring greens with a pear super reduction and gorgonzola-stuffed phyllo, warm potato leek soup(deep, savory flavor), and lobster and prawn bisque(a house specialty) were all tasty, presented with panache and quite large.  I expect teeny courses but Alize breaks that mold.
      Dessert choices are adequate with the souffles featured.  We had both a chocolate and candy cane mint souffle which were well-prepared but a little short on chocolate sauce.  Our one cake dessert was the best choice.  
      Alize's view of the Vegas strip is a lovely addition to your dining experience.  I suspect, that on a busy night, getting a window table may be difficult;  however, almost every seat has a north or east view.  We lucked out(a slow night) and received a corner table.  Complete with sunset, flashing neon casino lights and eight airplanes in line to land - all night.
     One negative is the wine list, a negative that is shared by almost all LV high-end restaurants.  The prices, compared to Los Angeles, are ridiculous and encourage suboptimizing the evening's experience by going cheap by necessity.  As it is, Alize is $125-150 per person for a three course meal with obscure wines carefully chosen.  It is very easy to increase this by $50 per person with recognizable wines at over-the-top, premium prices.  Bring a friend who knows wine.
      In fairness to Alize, its prices for the quality of food are reasonable, particularly compared to its competitors.  It is located a little off the strip so rent must be a little cheaper than at the top casino venues.  And service, top to bottom, seemed to reflect a sincere desire to please and to have the patron return.
     As a package of all things fine dining, Alize is a excellent choice in Las Vegas.  I feel fortunate to be able to afford dining experiences like Alize once in while.  Save up - you won't forget your evening.",87nfs2EBoNLrkMd6jaQCcw,3,1,4,JJAh20dgBclaueEOVkSz0A

Whisked up and seated precisely at the time of our reservation, I was sipping that solid martini and enjoying the view from a corner table within moments. We started with and enjoyed immensely an appetizer of sauteed jumbo lump crab, ahhhh, delicious! Treated to a surprise amuse bouche, also delicious! I ordered a steamed 2lb Maine lobster and BJ went for the grilled Angus Rib Eye with parmesan and sweet potato gratin. BTW, the sommelier had personality-plus, even though we do not enjoy wine and thus declined his services. 
So, along comes BJ's steak and not-the-lobster-I-ordered. What was on my plate looked delicious, but it was my birthday, damnit and I wanted my lobster! As soon as I pleasantly mentioned this to our server, it became quite clear that he was a summa cum laude graduate of SnootyWaiterTradeSchool. Now I can out-snooty the best of THAT particular group, so my lobster arrived, to their credit, right away. Too bad it was overcooked. BJ's steak, on the other hand was melt in the mouth delicious. Seriously. 
So, on to the dessert we had pre-ordered, a s'more-type-thing with warm chocolate fondant, toasted marshmallow, graham cracker and smoked vanilla ice cream. Let's go with.....the tiny-cookie plate that the chef sent over was much, much better. SnootyWaiterTradeSchoolGrad dropped the ball big time on coffee and perhaps an after dinner cocktail for the birthday girl, so we lingered a bit anyway, enjoying the view. 
All in all, a very, very good meal, an amazing view and a five-star review becomes a 4-star review because of the waiter. What a shame.",x9g-i1DsB-VjSDGVOdRonA,3,1,4,ynVjEMG5J7C8lcUNRSB1Kw

Initially looking at it, Alize may seem pricey, but take into consideration their awards and recognitions...and the fact that it's a fine dining establishment in Las Vegas with AMAZING views.  The Tasting Menu and wine pairing was phenomenal -- add on a wonderful wait staff, especially Gabriel, and the experience was flawless!  Portion sizes of each course looked small initially, but at the end, they were portioned out perfectly to fill you up, but not over do it.  The special 'gift trunk' and card for my birthday was quite a treat as well - details, details, details!  Overall, special occasion, date night, or just a dinner away from home/the hotel, do not skip out on Alize - it's always good to splurge once in a while! :)  Amazing food, wonderful service, calm & secluded atmosphere, and unbeatable views!  Alize, you have received the stamp of approval from this picky foodie!  Thanks for making this a memorable birthday!
 
In depth: 
Highlights of the night (from 7-course Tasting Menu - wine pairing recommended!):

Bread selections: french, pretzel, and rice flour - all were great options. The French was very soft and fluffy in the center and crispy crust; pretzel was nice and soft - not too much crust unlike many others; the rice flour option was delightful - soft, light, and very aromatic with herbs

- Chilled Octopus Salad - very unique texture with the octopus; flavors went very well together!  The blood orange really added freshness to the strong seafood flavor.
- Sauteed Foie Gras **FAVORITE** - probably the most flavorful and delicious selection from the tasting menu!  Definitely a must try!  Another foie gras option available, but this option is the most popular.  Savory with sweetness from the roasted peaches - sauces are amazing! Rich, salty, sweet, melt in your mouth!
- Lobster Ravioli - great flavors, pasta was thin and not overwhelming.  Personally thought there was too much carrots in the dish and the consomme could have used a tad bit more salt.  Not bad, however.
- Tea Smoked Duck Breast - wonderful, bold, Asian flavors!  Beautiful balance of salty and sweet.
- Filet Mignon - AMAZING combination of the beef, braised endive with prosciutto, potato puree and the cognac sauce!  All components were wonderful, but the superstars were the mini greens salad with prosciutto and the potato puree.  Sauces had the spice, bland if tasted separately, but necessary to balance out the strong flavors of the other components.
- Cheese course was great...at least 2 of 3.  Not a big fan of cheese but I did enjoy the black tea cheese, which was on the sweet side - different but amazing.  The other was very similar to gruyere - really enjoyed the presentation of this.  It was served shaved like a ribbon-flower made of cheese!  The Vermont Cremont - ehh... not so much.  A blend of goat and cow's milk with a hint of mascarpone.  Great, soft texture, but the flavor was not for me
- Tea/Coffee course - opted for tea option.  Fun, simple selection of teas you can choose from. Freshly brewed for you and served with some simple butter cookies and a few other sweets.
- Grand Marnier Souffle - Great closer to a filling meal!  Light, not too sweet, hint of Grand Marnier - not too overpowering, and the sauce is to die for!

The key presented at the table from the beginning (for birthday) opens a little trunk they bring out towards the end.  It's a little gift from the restaurant.  Really cool and fun concept!

Once again, memorable meal from Alize and definitely will be back!",itlrEa4O9n6NFlwhpwK5yA,0,0,5,9uIvr7Jfz2QAboO544MJSg
732828,2008-08-03,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Absolutely the BEST meal ever!  My husband and I go to Vegas every year and try out different restaurants while we are there.  Most restaurants we find are overpriced for what you get and overrated.  Not the case here.  We read reviews online, and several locals we talked to also said Alize was known for really great food.  This was our first time at Alize, and this will be one restaurant that we will return to.   

Warning...it is expensive.  But worth every penny in our opinion.  The food was amazing, service was outstanding, and most of all the view was stunning (we made reservations around sunset time and it was dark by halfway through our meal so we had a wonderful view of the city lights.)  

We chose the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings, and it was more than enough food for me, and my husband was full by the end of the meal too.  (He did finish some of my courses/wine for me.)

The wines were perfectly paired with each course and the food was delicious.  First course was the crab-stuffed piquillo pepper...so good.  Then the spinach salad with duck confit topped brioche with a sunny-side up quail egg...presentation was beautiful and dish was terrific.  Then came the Dover Sole and that was followed by the Veal with crispy sweetbreads and green onion fondue.  All outstanding.  Then the dessert course:  3 mini portions of their best desserts.  My favorite was the cheesecake wrapped in caramelized phyllo with a sour cherry sauce.  And I am not a big cheesecake fan, but this was to die for!  

If you don't do the tasting course, get the Dover Sole.  It's their signature dish and it will not disappoint.  Neither one of us would have ordered it (because who craves dover sole?), but one bite and we were hooked!  It was amazing. 

Our server was Juan Augustino and he was the BEST!!  Extremely helpful, very attentive, and he made excellent suggestions.

735644,2011-07-14,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"My husband and I went here for our first wedding anniversary, and the atmosphere, staff, and food certainly made it feel like a special night. We arrived early for our reservation, and the host apologized that the table wasn't yet ready. He suggested that we wait at the bar, but we instead chose two comfy seats in the entry way. The host asked at least twice if he could get us drinks while we waited, which was only about 15 minutes--our actual reservation time. 

We were then seated at one of the large windows overlooking the Strip. Immediately we were presented with water and menus. The wine menu is ridiculous...at least 20 pages long. Needless to say, we floundered with that, so we decided to choose our meals. While we were deciding, the sommelier came over and asked if he could recommend something based both on our personal tastes and what entrees we thought we might order. At that moment, I thought, ""Here we go... He's going to suggest some $400 bottle that he knows we can't afford, thereby 'shaming' us."" To my delight and shock, he suggested a modest $75 bottle that we both really loved. (Modest compared to people's reviews, stating that there wasn't a single bottle of wine under $100, which is obviously untrue.) 

The meal in its entirety went swimmingly and was delicious, and the service throughout was extremely attentive without being intrusive. They started us with a lovely bread bowl and butter followed by a surprise amuse-bouche of avocado soup. I ordered the French onion soup, and my husband ordered the tomato lobster bisque--both great. Our entrees were both steak--me, Wagyu NY strip, and my husband, green peppercorn-encrusted filet. Both were hearty portions with sides and were delicious. We ended with a chocolate souffle, which you have to order with your entree, but our server reminded us of this, so it was, therefore, not an issue. It too was really good (even though we were so full that I could barely appreciate it). Before they presented the check, the waiter came back with a black box tied with ribbon, which he pulled, opening the lid, revealing a message of ""Happy Anniversary"" and two small bags of house-made fruit jelly candies as a gift.

While our bill was a little under $300 with tip, we had a lovely, lovely evening and thought it well worth the splurge. We may end up making this an anniversary tradition!",NOc1plCkDUYkU98Kf6MgwQ,0,0,5,3lF0XYcHPrg93MccM3uexA
750358,2016-07-03,2,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I absolutely love Alizé at the Top of the Palms. This was my second time dining here, and the experience was just perfect. I dined within a party of 4, with two of us opting for the chef's tasting menu (myself included), and two opting for a la carte selections. The service was impeccable, and even the staff that was training at the time was as professional and courteous as someone who has been there for years. They really take care of you here, and I appreciate the warmth and knowledge of the staff especially at a fine dining establishment. 

If you do opt for the tasting menu, please note that the portion sizes are remarkably generous, and at the end of the meal we were stuffed without feeling bloated. I could not have been happier with my meal, and the same goes for the rest of my party. What also was a sign of tact and professionalism was the pacing of the tasting courses, especially when timed with and in between the a la carte courses. There were pallette clensers and other small accoutrements that were given to the people I was with that had the a la carte selections, so at no time did it feel like we were just the only ones eating, which was thoughtful. 

The beef carpaccio and tartare, and the duo of foie gras terrines were absolutely delicious. The trio of salmon and escargot with bone marrow were huge hits at our table as well. Honestly everyone loved everything, from start to finish. Speaking of finishes, the desserts like their soufflés are unbelievable and not to be missed.

The wine and drink list is massive, and the view of the strip is spectacular, especially once the sun sets and the lights go up. Take pictures or ask to have your picture taken and they will happily oblige. And no, I don't care if that sounds tacky since everyone is allowed to be a tourist when you're away. I'd actually be more surprised if you didn't take the opportunity to snap a photo or two. 

I'd come here for the food if it was in the basement in the Palms and you took a service elevator to get to it, rather than seeing the hostess at the casino level who will take you up to the top. This is my favorite Vegas restaurant to date, and I'd give Alizé 6 stars if I could.",Uy3ferAq3DOgz-DpHeddmw,0,0,5,HW5DzNvxkoxmmjiSNy1aqA

The vibrant and colorful nightlights flicker outside the 360 deg glass windows. 

Before our meal start, we were presented with a birthday note card and a key to a gift after the meal and it is a sweet gesture. We were well-taken care of by the maitre d Gabriel as he present our food on each level. The food itself is exquisite. All the flavors play a melodious tune in the mouth and each plate complements one after the other. The foie gras is perfectly cooked and the venison almost melts in the mouth.

In short, it's a great restaurant. The view is breathtaking of course. But what is actually a bit surprising is that the food and service are also outstanding. Surprising because the restaurant is in the Palms so it could easily get by selling the great view (while serving mediocre food), to the Kim Kardashian crowd.

As you trip over the pile of James Beard Awards and Michelin stars at the front entrance, you expect this to be an amazing dining experience. There's not a bad view of the Strip from any seat on this top-floor restaurant. And the waiters are immaculately attentive, cycling out each course with a clean table, a smile, and a coordinated dish presentation with a full description of every item in every dish every. single. time!
  BUT. It feels like the chef made the restaurant to impress other CHEFS--not fans of fine cuisine.  Just based off the barage of fancy options, I was sold on the Tasting Menu. $150 a person, but hey, it was an 8-course meal, I'm sure there's value to this! Well...you know that cliche' you see in movies on occasion where the waiter brings an individual dot of food on a massive plate? This is one of those places. I've been to my fair share of fine dining restaurants in this city, and I DO NOT hesitate to drop money on a good meal....but this was the first time that I didn't feel a real VALUE to what I was paying. Don't get me wrong--the morsels of food I had were really good! But the problem was, that morsel made you immediately wish you had a more SUBSTANTIVE portion of it.  The scallop (singular!) was perfectly cooked, with a broad range of textures. The tiny slice of beef wellington was the best I've ever had! The lamb RIB (SINGULAR...once again!) was tender, juicy, and wonderfully grilled, too.
  But it feels that the true effort with the Tasting Menu is given more to DISPLAY and PRESENTATION than it is to making a real fullfilling and well-rounded meal. There's a barrage of different plate shapes and sizes, ranging from a rounded-corner triangle to a transparent glass circle resting on a cross-section of a log. An ridiculously elaborate coffee brewer is assembled at  your table to give you great coffee 15 minutes later. Silverware is perpetually replaced. If this restaurant just transferred some of that energy into EMPHASIZING the a la carte menu, or minimizing the Tasting Menu into four larger courses, making the coffee optional, and trading out forks and knives, I feel that I would've enjoyed that Tasting Menu substantially more.",QhQk2f4w8BFuAhA2cW9mdQ,0,0,3,hW4OB-f0yKNAzFInEh6WUg

We both ate off of the Farmer's Market Prix Fix Menu, which changes with the seasons. I had a filet with fois gras and summer vegetables (somehow the chef transformed these into the the most flavorful carrots and squash ever.) 

We also each ordered a souffle for dessert, mine the Grand Marnier and my boyfriends the Chocolate. Both very scrumptious. 

The highlight was the window seat where we were literally inches from the outside glittering Las Vegas skyline.

The food was delicious, I can't remember everything we had unfortunately, since it was a year ago. 

Prices were not too unreasonable either. I think we had dinner, dessert and wine and it came to under $140.00 total.

Two servers introduced themselves, pulled out our chairs, and even laid napkins on our laps.  Menus and water followed.  But no one mentioned restaurant week, and there was no evidence of it on the menu.  When we inquired, there appeared to be some confusion, and it took a long time for the appropriate menu to arrive.   After that,  service seemed to slow down considerably, although it continued to be gracious and accommodating.  They made a substitution and brought extra sauce without batting an eye.  What really let us down was the quality of food in the main course.  The pan roasted chicken turned out to be a typical boneless skinless chicken breast, dry and overcooked, accompanied by two asparagus spears, two bites of mashed potatoes, and overcooked mushrooms.  The sliced ribeye steak was rare almost to the point of rawness, tough, and chewy.  However, I have to say that everything produced by the pastry chef, from dessert to the little after-dinner tidbits, was heavenly.  I would go back just for dessert..

We called management to complain and they failed to acknowledge that their meat was bad and did not make any concessions to amend the situation.   I would not expect this from a so-called Michelin star rated restaurant (according to the concierge).  Customer service is just as important as the quality of the food.  Alize failed to deliver on both.,buRWcrts7B94FOuRZgvGzA,0,0,1,GG0wO3RfzfjZg2YLs1TVAw
894001,2010-09-07,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"This review is for the Restaurant Week 2010 prix fixe menu.

In a nutshell, nice view but for the price I'd much rather go elsewhere. Not at all satisfied even with the discount price I paid.

First of all, I tried making reservations online but a deposit was required, not sure if that's opentable.com's rule or Alize's but that's dumb. I called in instead however they had a less than favorable time available than that of the one that cost money upfront. That really should have been my first indication not to go here. 

So my boyfriend and I had the following:

First Course: Lobster Bisque & Field Greens and Herbs 

My soup was good however umm there was no lobster in it. And I would have preferred to put the Puff Pastry Croutons in myself because it got soggy and I kept hoping it was a chunk of lobster. While the presentation of the salad was nice the Caraway Cracker made it difficult to eat and there wasn't enough dressing.

Second Course: Salmon, Asparagus, Idaho Potato & King Crab Croustillant Béarnaise Cromesquis and the Grilled Ribeye 
Gruyère Potato Purée, Asparagus ,Red Wine Beef Jus

The salmon and steak were cooked well and the portions were big but the amount of sides to eat with it was inadequate. While both were pretty good, neither were great. Felt more like a chore to finish it.

Third Course: Crème Brûlée and Soufflé du Jour
The Soufflé wasn't rich enough for me. It sort of tasted like they poured nesquick into it. Good thing they poured my white russian well. It made my souffle worth eating. The Crème Brûlée could have been smoother maybe or less thick but it was good anyhow and I enjoyed it.

We got the 2 course wine pairing for an extra $10 each. The Chardonnay for the appetizer was light and yummy. The bf liked his Cabernet but my second glass (forgot what) was yucky! 

Service: The staff was very nice. However you kind of got the feeling like they were watching you like hawks. I'm sure it was because they were trying to refill or bring out/clear stuff in a timely manner. But it was still a little uncomfortable and we felt rushed. We were out in like an hour flat and didn't get to enjoy the view as much or have a minute to digest.

Also, when reserving they mention proper attire which is to be expected but there was a group of dudes in cargo shorts, t shirts, and flip flops. So much for dress code.",UV0AVm6_NSEVHXuL8ytWPA,0,0,2,QsjAacUw-SclcI9e_Lcqzg

If you are interested in wine - ask Claudio! Their wine list is unlike anything I've ever seen or tasted. Dining at Andre's restaurants is always an unforgettable experience, but Alize is the jewel! Be ready for a unique experience from the time you arrive at the bar to the time you leave. We had great martinis at the bar served by Lisa. Alize's General Manager, Stavros, made sure that we were brought to our table exactly at the time of our reservation. The view of the strip from our table was stunning! Every detail in our dinning experience was handled with such precision. I started with the Foei Gras and the Phyllo Wrapped Pear Salad. The combination of taste and presentation left me aching for more. I chose the Dover Sole Amandine for my entree. The fish was absolutely delicious and moist. For dessert, I ordered the Grand Marnier souffle. This was the cherry on top. OMG... just delicious!

The deal was fantastic, and the food didn't upset. And of course, the view was beautiful, and let's face it, Vegas is just 20 times better at night!

Had the lobster bisque (which they gave a way too plentiful heaping of) that I loved, the ribeye (with mashed potatoes and asparagus -- thank god because I'm sick of Chicago restaurants just giving you a hunk of meat on the plate. Beef a la carte is pathetic... but that's a sidenote...) and the chocolate souffle. All pretty divine.  I think we had 3 servers, all attentive and wanting to know how our meal was, it was nice but odd. The chairs and dim lighting made me want to pass out after the meal, similar to after a Thanksgiving feast... On any other night would it be worth the money?

Getting up to the restaurant was disjointed, very odd encounters with employees near the elevators. Finally, we arrived to the restaurant and we were greeted by the hostess. We had a table overlooking the north valley, a glance over my shoulder revealed the south strip. 

The views are stunning, clouds had gathered and I hoped we'd see a storm but none developed, but we did enjoy sunset. As for the $50.11 Restaurant Week menu they pulled the short ribs advertised and replaced it with Hanger Steak. The husband opted to order off the regular menu, I went ahead with the three courses offered by Restaurant Week.

We started with an Amuse of Tuna Ceviche

First Course
Angus Beef Carpaccio with Watercress and Parmesan Cheese; Basil Pesto and Toasted Baguette. 

Second Course
Hanger steak with Gruyere Potato Mousseline Sautéed Spinach, Braised Shallots, and Pinot Noir Sauce

Third Course
Andres Apple Tarte Tatin with a Pignoli Florentine and Calvados Ice Cream

Mister had the French Onion soup and Duo of Lamb with potato napoleon.

The carpaccio was delicious and prepared very similarly to the bison carpaccio at Andres, which is my ulimate favorite version. The French onion soup was enjoyable. My entree was tasty, hanger steak is my least favorite cut of beef but it was nicely executed. The duo of lamb was the better dish, but that was expected. The rack had a rich mustard crust and the braised shoulder layered with the potatoes was especially good when ran through the sauce and feta cheese. Dessert was adequate, but no part was particularily noteworthy. Honestly, it left me craving the apple cobbler from Buzz BBQ.

Alize was enjoyable, but not nearly as memorable as I hoped. I definitely prefer Andres at Monte Carlo. However, for all the places I've dined with stellar views Alize does offer the highest caliber of eats.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,2,3,NH9pDqozOQILJ0Jso_prrg

I called to request a window table and they said there were no guarantees, but if we came early we would have a better chance.  We did get there early and taken to a table where one seat faced a wall.  When we asked for a better table, they put us in the middle next to a couple with their poorly dressed and obnoxious kid (not the restaurant's fault that parents don't know how to handle their kids).  At that point I did not care so much about the window, I wanted away from that kid.  A window table came available and when we asked, we were kindly (and understandably) moved.  We ordered the tasting menu which was delicious top to bottom.  We added the caviar starter which was great too.  A couple of cocktails and glasses of wine and the evening was turning out lovely.  Service was OK (I had to tell them to slow down, we were not in a hurry) until the ultimate disappointment at the end.  I had called a couple of days before to order (and pay for) a $65 4"" cake.  I spoke to the manager the day before to make sure the cake was going  to be served as it was a surprise for my husband.  Well, dinner was over and the bill came, no cake.  I got up to remind them and the server said ""Oh yea, I saw that back there"".  She brought it out and asked ""is this the one?""  It too was quite good, but I would expect a restaurant like that to handle such a request (and purchase) a bit differently.

Greeted promptly and sat early, the views set the tone for a wonderful night. The menu was easily accessible, the service spectacular, not pretentious or snooty as some fine dining establishments in Vegas are. 

The sommelier made excellent suggestions, despite the difference in entree orders (lobster vs. Filet). The wines selected paired beautifully. My Lobster thermidor was divine, made slightly less excellent by the ratio of lobster to mushroom. When I order a '2 lb. Lobster', it would be nice if the lobster made up at least a third of the meal. There were far more mushrooms than there were pieces of lobster. Honestly, the flavor, preparation, and presentation were so excellent that I didn't even take any points off for the lack of actual lobster meat.

The foie gras, served on a cranberry scone, was simply the best I've ever had. I've dined plenty in Las Vegas, as well as San Francisco, Chicago, and Seattle. Nothing comes close. Divinity in food form. The views as well are beyond compare, with the whole of the Strip laid before you. It isn't cheap, it requires a little drive, but it is simply one of the best culinary experiences you can enjoy in Las Vegas. Full stop.

The Mr & I both wanted the Vegetarian Tasting Menu but our quandary was that we only had 2 hrs for 7+ courses.....not to worry though, as the staff made sure we got out in plenty of time

This was very close to a 5-star evening but for the ingredients.... 3 of the veggie tasting dishes contained animal-based gelatin..... which is a veggie no-no.  Places like Michael Mina use veggie-friendly gelatin options but not everyone does, so always pays to ask.  

We had advised the host when we made reservations about our no gelatin / no meaty broth restrictions but were still served animal-based dishes so ended up sending back 2 of the 3 ""gelatin"" dishes ( the chef came out after #2 to ask about our gelatin-aversion & then had us covered by dish #3 ) 

They were very gracious & substituted everything out but we felt like jerks questioning every dish & I'm sure the waitstaff didn't appreciate taking everything back either

If you're offering a vegertarian menu, please make sure it is truly veggie!  

But enough venting - onto the good stuff!!

Amuse - Caramelized pineapple in balsamic glaze - the top of the pineapple had a nice brûlée coating & paired well w/ the vinegar

Vichyssoise - this was a vichyssoise-gazpacho mix....paired w/ creme fraiche & truffle oil w/ potato-based croutons like potato chips. Awesome!  BUT - I forgot traditional Vichyssoise is made w/ chicken stock & they didn't disclose the stock as an ingredient, as they were telling us what was in the dish - I only HOPE there was no stock since this is *another* veggie no-no

Mushroom Soup w/ miso glaze. This was absolutely incredible - tons of mushroom varieties w/ heirloom tomatoes & something else I couldn't place.  The rose wine pairing for this was particularly scrumptious - it was a Colombo from Provence

Heirloom tomato salad w/ tomato gelato, candied tomato & burrata.  I liked how the cold gelato affected the little taste of heirloom tomato & intensified the flavor & add that to the creamy burrata.....

Curried cauliflower puree w/ roasted cauliflower scallions, pomegranate seeds. Paired w/ Oregon Pinot. Really brought out the creaminess of the puree

Soy glazed tofu w/ tempura tomato, asparagus, & brussel sprout. The tofu was really creamy & buttery & the soft chewy rice-cake like crust was a wonderful texture pairing

Cheese course had us trying out a goat cheese w/ fig walnut reduction, & a crisp w/ raisins. Super creamy & dense - we also got a dry swiss or maybe it was jack w/ apricot jam & zucchini ginger cake.....again, eye rolls!

Pre-dessert of meringue w/ grapefruit custard & poppy-seed boysenberry reduction - nice & fruity & cleansed the palette

Chocolate soufflé was the main dessert & it was light & chocolaty & the perfect ending on a fabulous meal

Although our visit was short due to our time restrictions, we in no way felt the least bit rushed.  Staff was completely attentive & we felt very well cared for.  Even w/ the hiccups, it was a super-enjoyable meal that I hope will be further enhanced for vegetarians & one we would look forward to repeating in the near future!

I've dined at a number of locations in Vegas that have great views, but the view at Alizé heralds as my favorite.

To start dinner, you are presented an iPad with a myriad of beverage choices.  Then you are presented with a number of bread options and an amuse bouché to wet your palate.  To start, I ordered the steak tartare for an appetizer.  I recommend that with no hesitation.  My entree was the Sea Bass which was good, although it came with a few different plated vegetables that were only ok.  When they present the dish to you, they pour a light sauce over the top which I could have done without.  There wasn't much depth or flavor to the sauce and I'm sure it could have reduced the calories in the dish.  Overall, the Sea Bass was still very flaky, had a nice crust, and overall... was still very good.  Our dessert was the warm peach gallete which was served with a marzipan ice cream.  This too was delicious.

1409223,2009-10-06,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"This restaurant ruined our New Year's Eve plain and simple.  This restaurant needs to fire it's waiters and hosts.  The maitre'd was the only nice person we came across in this place.

So, I booked this restaurant in advance for New Year's because I wanted to do something really special for my girlfriend.  It was our first New Year's together and it's her favorite holiday.  We arrive at the restaurant early so we can get a window seat since they are first come first serve.  The lady said we should come back in 15 minutes because they weren't allowing anyone in yet.  I come back in 10 minutes and all the window seats are taken!  We were pretty upset about this since we arrived early to make sure we got a nice table.  We told the host a.k.a douchebag about our concern and he said, ""you're still a few feet from the window, is that not good enough for you?""  Mind you, this was in a real smart ass tone.  

We should've known to leave at that point but we proceeded with the dinner.  We pretty much just sat there for like 15 minutes without anyone coming over to ask for drinks or take our order.  When the waiter finally did, he was very cold and certainly not friendly.  

I get my first course which was a scallop with sea urchin on top.  Some guy brings it over with one of those metal covers on top only to reveal that it had fallen over and the sea urchin was smeared all over the plate.  Instead of apologizing and bringing over another one that hadn't been destroyed, he just left it on my table and ran away.  For the amount I was paying for this, the presentation has to be spot on.  We're not talking about Taco Bell here, which I happen to prefer at this point.

I let that slide and moved on with the remainder of the courses.  At that point, we noticed they didn't serve us the pallet cleanser sorbet like listed in the prefix menu.  I told the waiter and he was like, ""are you sure you didn't get it?""  Wrong answer buddy.  Then he says he'll bring it out anyway even though we were supposed to get it before the last course we had just eaten, defeating the purpose of it entirely.  

At that point, we had both had enough and wanted to just pay for what he had and leave.  We spoke to the maitre-d and he didn't let us pay anything because our experience was so miserable.  I have to give him credit for that.  He was genuinely nice.  That doesn't change the fact that we were treated like crap on a very special occasion.  

What makes me even more mad was everyone had to order from the pre-fix so it's incredibly easy from the kitchen's perspective.  There was no reason to miss an entire course unless they just didn't give a shit about us.  I will never return to this restaurant unless they hire an entirely new staff.

1423913,2011-01-18,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Here is it. 

Food- yes, the food was good, more like B+ good, not great though. My dish was really tasty (filet mignon) and it had a lot of sauce added to it. My girlfriend's plate was so so, she had the salmon or sea bass, not too sure which one but it did lack flavor, too bland. We also had the scallops for an appetizer and for $26 for 3 scallops they we not the best tasting by far. 

Service- They were good too, not the best but good for their restaurant. 

Our table- the table was not the best and from what I had heard, there was not a bad seat in the house. Yeah, we had a small table in the back corner and it was very uncomfortable, I do not know why they even have a table there. The amazing views of the strip are for only about a third of the restaurant, the rest are not all that (who wants to over look housing?). 

Atmosphere- Look, if you want to have a quality meal go to Alize, but I will say this you will be bored and after you eat you will want to head back to your room and call it a night. The vibe is for someone who likes food and wants to talk for 2-3 hours after. I thought this place would set me up for a night out, I was totally mistaken. Will I go back? Probably when I feel like treating my parents. 

Overall- I didn't want to dis this place too much, but you really need to try it out for yourself. The restaurant is very nice and they have a ton of old bottles which can go for 30k each. What average person actually buys that? Go try the place out, you may enjoy it.

1434888,2015-04-06,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"We recently went to Alize. We had just come in after a long flight, and wanted a place that was both rated high and yet was close to our hotel (Palms).  Alize looked perfect, as it is well regarded and is also on top of one of the Palms towers.

Even better, Travel Zoo was offering a $145 for two people dinner special that we decided to purchase.  In fact, they are still offering it.

I am happy to report that Alize exceeded our expectations. 

Our first impression was the superb view.  Palms is a bit off the strip, which is actually a feature not a bug, since the view from Alize gives you a wonderful perspective of the whole strip.

Of course, what really matters is the food.  The tasting menu was a 6 course prixe fixe dinner, where you make a choice from each section (e.g. appetizer, main, dessert).  Every choice we made was excellent.  We particularly liked the Vichyssoise soup, scallops, salmon, duck breast, and Beef Wellington.  Our cocktails were great.

The Vichyssoise soup has a story.  In the middle of eating it, we noticed a piece of hair in it!  We pointed this out to the waiter.  He was immediately apologetic.  A few minutes later, no less than the general manager came out to our table to apologize.  We were comped our cocktails.  No hard feelings on our part.

That story typifies the service as a whole, which was excellent.  Everyone there treated us really well, and seemed sincerely customer oriented.

First off, I had let them know earlier in the day that we would be late to our reservation due to the fact we bought tickets for a show the same night not realizing how long it was.. no problem! Then we arrived even later due to a traffic issue; they didn't even ask us or seem bothered. Super cool.

Our server for the night was very French, very nice, very knowledgable and very cool. 

I was giggling in excitement over the tasting menu, everything was beautifully plated, tasted amazing and was just so flavorful.

This was definitely one of the most fancy restaurants I have ever been to.

The view is amazing, the food is excellent and it's just so nice.

I let them know it was my birthday ahead of time and they left a little note with a key on the table (which later opened a box with a surprise! so cute!).

I bought a tasting menu deal on Travelzoo after I had already booked a reservation for my birthday- there were plenty of other items on the menu that looked absolutely delicious but the tasting menu was outstanding! 

I started off with a ""Tuileries"" cocktail and totally botched pronouncing the name; our host for the night kindly corrected me when I asked and did not make me feel sheepish. It was DELICIOUS! Made with violet liqueur, mildly floral and very refreshing.

The first dish was a cucumber soup with a small ""salad"" type scattering upon a sheet of gelatin.  Wow! I don't even like cucumber; but it was seasoned so well I actually enjoyed it!

My date tried the king crab dish which was on top of a potato puree, he absolutely loved it. 

I had this sort of tomato salad with crispy little cubes of bread, rhubarb, feta cheese and a truffle balsamic; it was salty and the ingredients were SO so fresh. 

Selections of pretzel, french and a rice flour rye bread are available, all three were tasty. 

My date enjoyed the prosciutto wrapped lamb, my ""main"" was a delicious abalone mushroom dish which had beautiful sear marks and was on a sauce that had some sort of tumeric or middle eastern flare to it- it was very hearty and I liked the sauce, it was unique.

We both had a salad course that came wrapped in cucumber with several types of greens and a fresh herbal dressing and roquefort cheese- YUM!

I tried the white asparagus; it was the least exciting dish of the night, I don't even recall what it was served with.. it was okay.

Dessert was included and it was the first time I had ordered a souffle; grand marnier souffle to say the least! It was delicate and rich at the same time. My date got the cheesecake, it was some sort of citrus, it was also incredible.

For such small plates the six courses filled us up. We ordered espresso and lingered a bit. 

The service was impeccable, I felt very welcomed even though we were the most casually dressed patrons in the room, and each dish was good, great or outstanding.

I will absolutely be back and happily pay the $40-$50 per entree for the experience again. Thank you staff, we SO enjoyed visiting you guys!",NV3pDOP1kUDd3MY_s5kJ1A,4,2,5,IX7gBwuWaUV1yOwchF46FA

Alize will be closing its doors on December 31, 2017. My family has enjoyed some of the best dinners at this restaurant. One of the finest views of the strip and the rest of the valley, even better service and the best food! You don't normally see all 3 in one place but Alize has it all. For those of you who have not had a chance to dine here, I highly recommend the 7 course chef's tasting menu. Each course comes with multiple choice, vegetarian? Not to worry!! They would make you a 7 course vegetarian chef's tasting menu. 
Until dec 31, Travelzoo has an amazing offer of 7 course chef's tasting menu for 2 for $195 or for 1 person for $99. This even includes a glass of champagne!! Can't beat this deal.
Also check our their 50% cognacs and also buy one get one free for any wine bottle that is $225 and above.
The service is always excellent and food is AMAZING!! Each course is presented in a very elegant way, your server described the dish in the perfect detail and the it tastes so Good... it touches your heart!!!

The view is amazing, but the real let down was the service.  Maybe they were training a bunch of new people, but seemed like the staff was running around like crazy all night - and the place wasn't half full - on a Friday night at 7:30...The last straw was that they forgot an entire entree and tried to make up for it by pouring more wine - I don't want more wine, I want to eat.

I started with the PEAR SALAD, which was better than i could have imagined! It came with beautiful fluffy leafy greens, sliced pear, creamy cheese in phyllo, walnuts - served in a unique way i didn't expect and would rate that alone a 5.

1539191,2010-10-11,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I picked Alizé based on all the reviews and so I had high expectations. Things started off well. We were seated instantly, right next to the windows. We looked over the menu. I would have opted for the 7 course tasting menu but before coming my friend and I had said we wanted lamb and duck, neither of which were on the tasting menu so we ordered the duck and lamb entrees, the grilled foie gras and the escargot for appetizers and finally a pumpkin soufflé for dessert.

Neither the foie gras or the escargot were all that great. The foie gras in particular was pasty tasting. The escargot could have been from any cheap seafood place and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. So, by that time I was a little disappointed for such high reviews.

Fortunately the duck and lamb saved the day. Both were wonderful as was the pumpkin soufflé.  I'd have given them a 5 if the appetizers has also been as tasty. The duck actually started off as not so good for me. It came with slice of duck, slices of foie gras sausage and some prepared vegetables in the middle. I started eating each one separately and was not impressed. Once I started eating them together though it was amazing. Similarly with the lamb. By itself it was not so great but if you mixed a bite with the vegetables and fruits that came with it it was delicious.

The only other thing I feel should be mentioned, they had one 2 person table that had no view. Since they advertise the place as having an amazing view they really owe it to their customers to remove that table. I saw one couple get seated there and then move when a table by the windows became free. If that couple had not been able to move I'm sure they would have left disappointed.

1697697,2012-12-04,3,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"This is a swanky place reserved for special occasions. We dined here on a Sunday and there were only couple of other tables occupied. The view is very romantic as the restaurant is located on the 54th floor of The Palms. It is one of those places that is uncomfortably quiet with elevetor-esque music playing. My boyfriend kept on whispering at first until we got more comfortable and adjusted to the atmosphere. Our server was extremely attentive and had a great attitude. 

We started off with some cocktails. The wine and cocktail list is presented on the Ipad and left at your table so you can browse the several categories. Once you see something that you like you simply select to order it. Boyfriend had the Devil's Pancake which was a bourbon based drink and extremely potent and delicious. The ginger after taste was just amazing. I had a vodka based cocktail called French (and some # which I forgot). It was extremely delicious..it had Grey Goose and a sugared rim..with fresh raspberries garnish. So good!

The menu features a la carte menu or the chef's 7course tasting menu which was $125. We opted to go the a la carte route this time. As an appetizer we had Seared Pork Belly which was pretty good...it came with white cheddar polenta under and a quail egg on top. On the first bite I though the pork belly tasted a little overcooked..but combined with the polenta and runniness of the egg it worked really well. As an entree I opted for the good ol Filet Mignon medium and boyfriend went with Almond Crusted Rack of Colorado Lamb also medium. My contention was that my steak was unevenly cooked, yet his lamb was pretty consistently medium. The fact that my steak was not cooked evenly is the reason I am taking off a star. If I am at a place where I am paying over $50 for a small piece of meat, I'd prefer it blow me away. I would say given the option I would have gone for the lamb as that was just perfect. 

We opted to skip dessert and order another round of cocktails instead. At the end of dinner we asked the waiter to take our picture who responded with ""It would be my pleasure."" That was very gracious of him. We definitely did not experience any of the snootiness or bad attitude from any of the staff that some of the other reviews mention.

One star downgrade is because of the misleading menu, see below. 

We requested a seat near the window when making the reservation and they granted our request. We were seated immediately after arriving.

We both ordered the 7 course tasting menu with the $95 wine pairings.

We both ordered caviar listed at the top of the menu, the truffle caviar has ""($20 supplement)"" printed directly underneath. They billed us $20 extra for the truffle caviar I had as well as the russian caviar my wife had. They also billed us $11 each for the glass of bubbly. 

They also charged $20 for the sauteed foie gras that I had even though there was no mention of the upcharge in that part of the menu. 

Starter couse of caviar was just ok, probably the least memorable part of our meal although the champagne was a perfect match.

1st - We both had the lobster salad, very nice with big chunks of lobster.

2nd - I had the sauteed foie gras, excellent especially the port reduction which was surreal. Wife had the Toban-Yaki which was enjoyable.

3rd - I had the dover sole which were small fillets wrapped around a stuffing. My wife had perfectly cooked seared scallops.

4th - I had the pork belly (which I had never tried before) which was mostly fat but everything else with it just made the dish come together. Wife had the pheasant which had an excellent flavor but was a bit overcooked and dry. 

5th - I had the lamb loin, this was the best piece of meat I have EVER tasted. I would go back just to order this off the A-la-carte menu. Wife had the veal tenderloin that was merely excellent. 

6th - I had the Apricot confiture which I really enjoyed. Wife had the Etorki and she enjoyed that as well.

7th - I had the Grand Marnier souffle, perfectly done. Wife had the chocolate souffle and absolutely loved it. 

The wine pairings were excellent in every course and the sommelier did a great job explaining the pairings. Next time we will try the premium wine pairing. 

All in all the bill was $560 plus tip. The food varied from good to perfection, next time we will do the A-La-Carte menu and focus on the selections we liked from the tasting menu. The misleading menu was inexcusable, EVERY upcharge item should be marked on the menu. 

The service was impeccable except for one server who asked me if I wanted more bread, when I said ""not right now"" he removed my bread plate! Just a minor glitch that was more amusing than irritating. 

There should have been a different section on the bill to allow me to tip the sommelier separately.

1741307,2016-09-05,8,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"***Alize serves decent though not great French fine dining cuisine and also offers an excellent view of The Strip***

Las Vegas is filled with luxurious items and experiences including many of which like fancy watch stores that may not hold the same stature they did 10 years ago. Another category of luxury in Vegas would be the French fine dining restaurant. It seems top rated and expensive French fine dining restaurants are everywhere, and the classic French dishes are all here in the city from foie gras courses to indulgent soufflés. These French restaurants though, like many experiences in Vegas, have not evolved much. So many of these restaurants have been operating for decades and yet both the décor and the menu remain surprisingly the same, which makes you ponder whether you are enjoying a classic or something that is simply old-fashioned.

Alize is definitely a French restaurant that imbues that grandiose Vegas experience. The menu is full of premium ingredients and the view (56th floor of Palms) immediately makes you think amazing and exclusive. The food at Alize is a mix of mostly traditional though there are a few modern touches throughout to keep things interesting. Overall, the food at Alize is decent but not great. Their cuisine tops several other Vegas French restaurants like The Eifel Tower Restaurant, Aureole and the now closed miX though Alize does not quite measure up to Picasso, Joel Robuchon and L'atelier de Joel Robuchon.

I had their tasting menu, which was not too rich and heavy given the mostly small portions. The tasting menu is a build-your-own experience, and there is a good variety of proteins though I wish there were more vegetables to accompany the proteins. The dinner started with a refreshing chilled cucumber soup that was accompanied with cucumber gelee topped with carrots, pickles, black pepper, and pecans.

I opted for the supplemental caviar course, and while the portion was small, I did like the salty caviar paired with the creamy toasted brioche panna cotta even if the custard was slightly too sweet. The smoked salmon course was dainty, but I really enjoyed all the garnishes like the creamy avocado puree intensified with the use of an acid, salmon roe, fried capers and light potato crisps. The foie gras course featured a buttery and rich seared foie gras though the foie gras was a bit oily and lacking in smoothness of great foie gras I've had elsewhere. I enjoyed the sweet garnishes of blackberry, caramelized peaches, almond streusel, and toasted oat cream.

I was really disappointed with the truffled lobster ravioli. The filling was good, and I was not bothered by the very thick pasta sheet too much, but the porcini consommé, which was a big part of the dish, was incredibly bland. The tea smoked duck breast fared better even if the duck was cut too thin and cooked too long for my taste (the meat was still juicy and tender even though it was gray in color). The garnishes of gai lan, crispy soba noodle cake, ginger confit, and plum sauce were very Asian in inspiration (the duck breast was completed with a seared foie gras on top).

For my main, I was allowed to swap out their on-the-menu meat course with veal wellington, and I thought they did a good job with it. I liked the prosciutto wrapping, and the mushroom duxelles were very well prepared. The puff pastry was good enough, and the black truffle and shallot jus was thick, rich and noticeable in truffle flavor. Like the duck, I did not love the color of the veal, but it was surprisingly moist, tender and seasoned enough.

I did not love their choice of cheese (a run of the mill cow's milk cheese), but I really liked the plating and the garnishes (especially the fennel marmalade) to provide a fine dining cheese experience without the heaviness of a full cheese platter. The chocolate soufflé was very perfectly baked with a lightly crisp cake-like outside and a moist inside. The chocolate sauce was okay though I would have preferred a more contrasting (at least in terms of flavor) vanilla crème anglaise.

Service was quick and good (polite, professional and friendly). Prices are high (whether you go a la carte or with the tasting menu) though the prices are consistent with overly similar French or fine dining restaurants in Vegas. The décor is fine though not memorable with the real selling point being the view.

Alize is a decent French fine dining restaurant and might be somewhat surprising in quality given its location in Palms. It is the kind of old-fashioned and overpriced French fine dining restaurant that would struggle in most cities, but it will probably always have an audience in Las Vegas. It is not a must visit though if you dine in Las Vegas a lot and are a completist, you could definitely do worse.

Palms, like most Las Vegas casinos, offers free self parking.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,15,11,3,TBwZ_ESs9352x0T6yGQleQ

Where else you can enjoy superb food and a magical view of the Vegas skyline. Transported to the 56th floor of the Palms Casino yearning with anticipation to see it for myself. The massive multimillion dollar casinos morphed into the majestic barren-brown desert mountains, the scenery is breathtaking... The service was exceptional from the hostess to the friendly waitstaff.
Ordered from the pre-theater menu that consisted of 3 course tasting menu at $75, it's an affordable way to try some of their most popular dishes.
The evening started with the obligatory freebie amuse bouche. A delectable vegetable terrine with shaved parmesan and soup. The appetizers were tasty, keep in it classic with the gooey Gruyère cheese and a side of French onion soup. The smoked seafood dish consisted of Salmon, Trout, Bay Scallop, Hamachi tartare, the acidity shallot vinaigrette highlighted the woodsy smoke of the ocean basket's flavors with an added accent of a hard boiled farm egg for ultimate pleasure.
The entrees arrived via gueridon a fancy cart akin to a food limo. The chicken breast was moist and with a golden crispy skin paired an aromatic blood orange nage, there was an interesting cured egg yolk a top of the mushroom, bacon torchon. I tasted some of the decadent Filet, pure heaven. The desserts did not disappoint. Not your avant-garde cuisine but well prepared nevertheless.

We then indulged in the 7-course tasting menu. For the first course, I had the snow crab and octopus salad and my spouse had the roasted carrot and butternut squash soup. Both were equally delicious. For our second course, we both had the seared foie gras. It was perfectly seared, yet still light and buttery, and the spiced poached pears that accompanied it helped balance the richness of the foie gras. For our third course, we both chose the lobster thermidor, which was unabashedly decadent. The lobster was prepared perfectly, and the sauce and potato purée were delicious. I chose the roasted chicken for my fourth course and my spouse chose the stuffed quail. The chicken jus absolutely makes the dish, I could literally drink it, it was that good. The quail was fall-apart tender, and the porcini mushroom stuffing was flavorful and earthy. For our fifth course, I chose the braised beef short rib, and my spouse chose the Szechuan crusted venison. The short rib was tender and quite tasty, but forgettable. I do not typically order venison, but tried my spouse's and it was incredible. The crust was extremely flavorful with a slight kick, and the raisins added a delightful sweetness. For our sixth course, we each selected two cheeses. I cannot remember which two off the top of my head, but they were both delicious. They were accompanied with a drizzle of fig reduction, berries, and apricot jam. They also served a delicious goat cheese panna cotta with a mango reduction as a palate cleanser, which was so light and refreshening. Finally, for our sixth course, we had the coffee service, I chose the grand marnier soufflé l, and he chose the chocolate soufflé. The coffee service alone was amazing. They use siphon coffee makers and an organic blend coffee. It was deliciously smooth, and served with white and brown sugar cubes, whipped cream, and chocolate and orange cookies. I cannot speak for the chocolate soufflé, as I did not try it, but my husband said it was incredible. My grand marnier soufflé was fluffy, airy, and the sabayon was light enough that it didn't weigh it down or make it fall. Finally, the service was exceptional. The gentlemen who waited on us were knowledgeable, gave excellent recommendations, and ensured we were not wanting for anything. When combined with the panoramic view of Las Vegas from the 56th floor, we agreed it was one of our most memorable dining experiences!",zYGzrZP15X2j2M1RSnK8vQ,1,0,5,Ve5Bb9kwG66IluIz_2fjbA
1780001,2013-04-07,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Oh yeah...another Michelin star restaurant added to my book. We were a pretty big party of 11 including our kids venturing into the fine dining experience. This time it's Alize in Las Vegas at the top of the Palms hotel. First of all let me start by stating that I ordered the chef's 7 course tasting menu which is the basis of my five stars...had i only ordered certain a-la-carte items my rating might have been different, such as the Chilean Sea Bass which I would have preferred to have had a nice crispy skin and a lot less sauce/broth and what ever else was swimming around in it. This is one of my favorite choices of fish, I wish they would've kept the dish a little more simple. Also, the pork belly, though it was tasty and tender, I felt was nothing too special. Now, with that said, the tasting menu was great! Everything from the lobster bisque, and NO, it's nothing like the bisque one gets at Red Lobster...to think so shows just how uncouth you are, to the King Crab wth Black Truffles tucked in between the meat, to the Rib-eye that was soo tender and flavorful and of course, drumroll please..the Foie Gras. Whomever banned this stuff from California should have their taste buds hung. The generous amounts of Black Truffles and good portions of Foie Gras all contributed to a great dinner. I've come to the realization that just because a place has a Michelin star does not mean the food is automatically good and memorable, this is one of those places that got it right...at least with the tasting menu items anyway.",1IAtCtDJgDSzaE6gCrGAEw,2,2,5,UP0UbxaD1R0dRaog8_nd4g
1811785,2015-12-04,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I had the most amazing experience at Alizè!

My boyfriend and I decided to make reservations here for our anniversary dinner, and since we had a show at 7:30pm, we reserved for a 5:30pm dinner. The lady over the phone asked if it was for a special occasion and I had told her I wanted a table with a view.

As soon as we got to the restaurant we were seated promptly with a great view of the Las Vegas strip. We opted to buy the Travelzoo deal of $149 for a tasting menu for two. Nobody treated us any different for having that deal, everyone was very warm and accommodating. As soon as we were seated, the server presented us with a locked box and a key to open it at the end of our meal along with a letter greeting us a happy anniversary. 

Now I have to admit this was our first time ever trying a six course fine dining restaurant so I have nothing else to compare to, but the experience was great. The server was very nice and explained everything to us and told us more about what was in each course we chose. 

The courses that left a great impression to us that I will never forget are the following:
*The sautéed foie gras - AMAZING melt in your mouth deliciousness! I tried the foie gras that came with the duck meal but it wasn't as good so I would order the foie gras in the second course I think instead.
*My boyfriend ordered an Asian dish, I forgot the name, but it was memorable because the server presented us with freshly ground REAL wasabi that he made in front of us and mixed with some kind of sauce served with the dish; I love when restaurants do this!
*Grand Marnier soufflé and the chocolate soufflé - these were so good!! I'm more of a chocolate person so I liked that more, but the Grand Marnier one was just as delicious!
*angus beef carpaccio - this was amaaaaaaazing!! I don't know how they did it but every single item in that dish just went to so well together!
*the pretzel bread! Omg so delicious! Maybe it's just my obsession with pretzel bread, but it was fresh and just so good!

Overall, I would wanna go back there again! The overall experience was just so memorable and amazing. Thank you Alizè for giving me and my boyfriend something memorable to look back to! :)",6LhalPxJfvKwhEpvIvdrEg,0,0,4,AIiqjGUwmx6zvqqIRF2dzQ

We arrived for an early dinner, around 6PM, as we had a show in the Palms that night at 8.  It was slow at Alize, so we were really able to relax and enjoy the views.

The presentation here is superb.  The wait staff is knowledgeable, the wine list is excellent (though very expensive, with very few mid-level options), and the appetizers were delicious - we tried the veal cheek.

The issue here was the main courses.  They simply weren't very good.  We both ordered our steaks (one rib-eye and one filet mignon) medium rare, and one came out rare (rib-eye) and one came out beyond well-done.  Even at rare, the meat was tough somehow.  

The sides were very good, but small.  The potatoes with the filet were fried bits of dough - no taste outside of oils and minimal starch.

Needless to say, we didn't stick around for dessert after being underwhelmed with the main courses.

Service was fantastic.  Our server was knowledgeable, slightly cold, but was frank.  I like that.  Each entree was brought over covered with a silver shell and then uncovered in unison by six of the serving staff.  It was a lovely display.  Definitely got some oohs and ahhs from the party.  Each time I got up for the restroom, my seat was pushed in ad my napkin was folded.  

Food was not so good.  If it were up to me I would have naturally gone for the tasting menu, of which they have a choice of 5 and 7 courses.  Sadly, we were dining with others and they foiled our plans of gluttony for the evening. 

For appetizers we had the beef carpaccio and the scallops.  The carpaccio was good, but nothing that blew my skirt up.  The scallops were TEENSY!!!  Like the size of the scallops that come in a frozen seafood medley bag.  They were rubbery and small. Terrible.  I couldn't wait to pass them to the bf.

The amuse was some sort of pate, not my cup 'o tea, but I enjoyed the palate cleanser, mid meal, a tiny scoop of mango sorbet.

For the main course I had the beef shank ravioli and he had the filet mignon.  The ravioli could had been cooked a little longer, as it was a bit too al dente.  I liked the filling, very flavorful and moist.  The filet was nothing spectacular, but cooked at the correct temperature.  

Nobody in the party of twelve raved about the food and we ordered a vast variety of food.  One of the gals, took one taste of her swordfish and passed it over to her bf.  She stated it was very fishy.  

The dessert was alright, it was a chocolate fondant, with a pralined ice cream with toffee bits, encased in a block of ice.  

Maybe ordering from the tasting menu would be different, but I probably will feast at other parts of the strip before I return to this one.

The better the view, the worse the food.  They pay for the lease people, sometimes the pomp, doesn't make up for the quality of taste.

I can't complain TOO much, everything was bought and paid for by a CEO we happened to encounter during our trip.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,5,2,3,4gLYWwxrexFAZbwBPzHNWg

We arrived and our waiter Salvano greeted us and took our drink orders. We ordered off of the tasting course menu. This menu consist of 7 courses. You have a choice of 3 options for each course including one vegetarian option. So the variations are numerous. My husband and I decided to get different entrees for each course to maximize our experience to taste as much of the menu as possible.

The first course was a complimentary sampling from the chef. It was pheasant with filo dough wrap, with a strawberry puree, and a cauliflower puree soup. It was a nice surprise to start the evening from the chef.

1st course: Russian Golden Ostera caviar and Truffle caviar.($20 supplement)

2nd course: Ribeye Carpaccio and Maine Lobster and herb salad

3rd course: Sauteed foie gras and Chilled terrine of foie gras

4th course: King crab leg croustillant and Tempura calamari

5th course: Sauteed Dove Sole and Red Snapper

6th course: Aged beef ribeye and Spring rabbit

Chef palate cleanser consist of meringue coating around grapefruit puree and poppyseed sauce.

7th course. Gran Marinier souffle and Chocolate souffle.

Overall the dishes were decent size. The variety and flavors in each course made it so unique and delicious. With the foie gras the waiter recommended a glass of Sauternes wine, which was a pairing. The service was impeccable, even when it got busy the wait staff worked as a team to keep up the incredible service. Every waiter was knowledgeable and described in detail each dish as they served it. The view is priceless especially as dusk turned to night and you could see a clear view of the strip lighting up.

The service is impeccable of course. Very fine dining. We went during Restaurant Week. We were handed every menu except the RW one. No one mentioned RW. It was like a super secret thing they didn't want to encourage. And our server's face confirmed that suspicion when I said we wanted to do the RW offering. And it kinda felt like we were looked down upon from then on.

For an appetizer, I opted for the escargot. It was good. Not great or amazing, but definitely good. James O. got the french onion soup. It was fabulous.

For an entree, I had the salmon. This was the first time I had ever been asked in a restaurant how I wanted my salmon cooked. I went with the server's recommendation. And that turned out rather raw for me. I honestly would've enjoyed the salmon much more if it had been more cooked. But that's my own fault. The salmon sat atop asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes, and was topped with king crab and bernaise sauce. The asparagus was good. The mashed potatoes were wonderful. The king crab was divine. The bernaise sauce was great. James O. got the filet mignon with green peppercorn sauce. It was perfectly cooked and very tasty. 

When they brought the entrees, they were covered with those fancy silver domes. And the domes were lifted off both of our plates at the exact same time with a flourish. It was a cool touch that made us feel fancy.

For dessert, I had the creme brulee and James O. had a lemon fruit tart thing. The creme brulee was great. The tart was kinda meh. They also brought around a candy cart and we got two of each of these different homemade candies. They were all awesome.

All in all, it was a pleasant and tasty dining experience.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,8,2,4,9Rpg1JG0ue7NkTxzTdhl0A

I would suggest domestic or South American wines here.  The French wines were not reasonable.  The noise level at Alize is not high, so if you are looking for a business dinner place and your customer or you are at the Palms it is a solid choice.

2206253,2010-09-06,3,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"This is the review of the Restaurant Week 2010 prix fixe menu.

The Skinny: I've had airplane food that was better than this... when they used to serve food on planes... (2) service = white glove, silver dome service, friendly staff (4) value: normally this place charges $125+ for their regular menu. Quite frankly, I'd rather save my money and eat at In-N-Out (1)

I was super stoked to try this place despite my hubby's reservations. As soon as I got up there, my hope dwindled to despair.

The view is fantastic up there meaning one thing... the food's going to be terrible. Despite the friendly welcome and silver dome service (yeah, they lift silver domes off your food), it doesn't detract from the overall lack of imagination and platings at the restaurant. The food and menu looks like it hasn't changed in 20 years.

We ordered a couple of things: Lobster Bisque with Puff Pastry Croutons; Field green salad with caraway cracker and goat cheese; Pan Roasted Chicken Breast with  Potato Croquant and Butter Poached Leeks and Bacon Coq au vin; Grilled Ribeye with Gruyère Potato Purée, Braised Asparagus.

The lobster bisque did not have a strong enough lobster flavour. In addition, the minisule puff pastry bits scattered on top lost all the flakiness and became very soggy very quickly.

Salad was okay (although not properly dressed) but really ungainly to eat - the caraway cracker was way too hard to break with a knife and fork. Because it was so hard, it wasn't nice to eat either. The goat cheese was relatively bland.

The ribeye was okay but the sauce was singularly uninteresting - lacking both acidity and richness. The braised asparagus and the gruyere potatoes were in the same boat.

The worst dish of the evening - the chicken dish. It was like the food you'd get in the 80's at a really bad wedding. Dry and bland as the Sahara (you can see all the clear chicken jus on the top of the plate which means that it's not inside the chicken), the skin had an unpleasant soggy texture. 

FYI, leeks are an aromatic and should not be served alone like a vegetable. Quite frankly it's like getting a plate full of sauteed onions... not appetizing at all. The potato croquant was not crispy (I've had tater tots that were better). The bacon coq au vin was not appetizing in texture or flavour.

I didn't finish my food.

Dessert came and I was hoping for some redemption. 

The chocolate chip souffle was good but the chocolate sauce it came with didn't match with the souffle. It's like pouring chocolate over chocolate - it's a little too much. Not to mention, the chocolate sauce wasn't rich enough. The tiramisu was a little too heavy on the marscapone cheese and lack the lightness of a great tiramisu. Overall, an average dessert and I've had better.

Although I appreciate them participating in Restaurant week for the first time, their food isn't good enough to warrant a return visit at regular pricing. Sorry Alize... I can't help but give a 2 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,4,2,Teh5jXCLUC8kI5fRGBlzPA

The only weakness in my book was the roquefort toasty that was served with the salad.  Some people may have liked it, but it was way too strong for me because of the cheese.  Perhaps a smaller serving size would have worked given the extremely strong flavor of the cheese.

Elegant, classy interior with hundreds of bottles of wine all around the restaurant... these guys really know how to leave an impression! On top of that, you get the most amazing view of Las Vegas throughout the meal! I made sure to reserve seats in advance to get the strip view.

For the meal, I chose their famous 'Tasting Menu' which offered 7 courses from starters to dessert. Started from meal with the snow crab salad which was amazing. Moved on to the foie gras which was good, but had better. Then came the scallop. First bite, all I tasted was salt. Very disappointed with the flavor, but the scallop was cooked perfectly and had a amazing texture to it so I forgave it after some wine. Next up, the wellington. Very delicious! Our waiter let us try out all of the cheese they had to offer, then lastly was served their cake with their amazing coffee! Probably the best part of the meal! Since I was celebrating my wedding anniversary with my wife, we were given the 'special' box and key which was a very nice touch. I won't give away what was inside for all of you who've never been here so you can enjoy the surprise ;) *4 stars for the food (would've gave 5 stars if it weren't for the scallop and foie gras)

2389514,2011-07-13,3,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"It is with great regret that I write this review, not because I had a bad experience, but because when you can't usually afford a place like this, it almost seems like a sacriledge to say something negative about a restaurant with 2 Michelin starts. Nevertheless, I always keep it real for yelp and so will be as honest and thorough as I can.

Not gonna lie, I had a little wonder dust in my eye when I walked in and saw the place, got seated by my server and had a napkin placed on my lap (""seriously, I can do it myself... oooh well, ok.. thanks""). The menu looked amazing and so we procedded to order a round of cocktails (a tart martini for me (pomegranate liquor with ginger ale) and appetizers.

The tart martini was fine, not amazing but drinkable. The heirloom tomato salad was very very nice- containing a range of different heirloom tomatoes, beets and melons. Very lightly seasoned, but delicious enough that my non-watermelon-eating boyfriend actually enjoyed it. Success.

Then on to the main course. I ordered the lamb dish and my other counterparts ordered the steak, the sea bass and the lobster (among other dishes that I did not try and hence will not review). The server told us that main dishes take about 30mins to make because they are made from scratch. I was perfectly fine with this as it promised to be a great meal.

My lamb dish was good- alright here it goes: The lamb was cooked well, and it camed with thinly slices potatoes layered with thin pieces of lamb. Separately there were large chunks of lamb that were rubbed in an olive tapenade and cooked that way. To be honest, I have had more flavorful lamb at a lower (almost diner style) restaurants. The lamb was tender but it had no flavor - it didnt seem like it had been marinating in any sauce, and that the cooking time was fast (some of the best lamb dishes get cooked for 8hrs+). The potatoes did not have a lot of seasoning to it and it seemed overall bland. 

My bf's steak was great, juicy and cooked perfectly. The brocolli souffle that came with it, however, was pretty bland and nothing special (hate to say that I have made better broccoli souffles at home). His mom did not like the sea bass at all- thought it had no flavor (it even came with bacon mashed potatoes) and that it wasn't even coocked properly.

Finally, we ordered a chocolate and lime soufflee for dessert. The chocolate one was ok- a little undercooked and lacking fluff. The second one was definitely flulfier, but I could tell the undercooked factor because it tasted predominately like raw egg-whites- not a good sign.

The service seemed to be impecable except for one giant giant mistake: According to standard table service, servers should wait until all members of the table are done eating before they can remove all plates. However, the servers here did not wait and removed all plates but 1, leaving my bf as the only one still eating at the table. This is very rude because when you remove other people's empty dishes, you make the (still eating) person pressured and rushed to finish, which is not the dining experience you should be creating.

So there you go folks: my (hopefully) super objective opinion about a fancy 2 michelin star restaurant. Feel free to agree or disagree. I am sure everyone has a different dining experience.",VAI4LygxcbgHctXSS63kbg,6,1,3,XOAyziRac2QAoAVHptc8Wg

If you're going to celebrate your New Years Eve at Alize in Las Vegas, then this review is for you.
(Yes, it's the middle of August, but if you want to have dinner at high-end restaurant in LV on 31st, you should start planning early - restaurants get booked fast)

LOCATION: We chose this restaurant for 2008 not only because it had glowing reviews, but also because supposedly you get the best view of the New Year's fireworks from it. Yes, you do, but ONLY if you have a table facing the window overlooking the strip. Disappointment #1  We did not. Not only that, but our table was located right at the entrance, next to a wall + one side had a 2-seater bench instead of chairs. It was a velvet tufted bench, but still just a bench... too close for my comfort to another table... in a luxury restaurant... where they were asking $325 per person for the 2d sitting (prix-fixed menu) & we ended up paying $2000 w taxes & tips ($500 per person). Note: If you didn't know this before, almost all highly rated restaurants in Las Vegas have 2 sittings on New Years: 1st - usually from 6PM to 9PM, 2d - from 9PM to midnight (price & menu varies accordingly)

FOOD: All appetizers & salads were good... except for one order of pan seared foie gras, which came overcooked. That piece was also very thin comparing to another identical order we had at our table. Disappointment #2
Roasted 2lb Maine Lobster was cooked to perfection, BUT it was not deveined. Ouch!!! Disappointment # 3 My Sautéed Black Angus Filet Mignon was horrible: it was very dry and almost cold! I had only 1 bite. Huge disappointment #4
Desserts were not memorable.

SERVICE:  Disappointment #5 Our waitress was taking care of too many tables, thus was not very attentive. I don't think it was her fault though, more Alize's managers. Also, we had difficult time catching a sommelier.

CONCLUSION: We don't have the amount of money Kobe Bryant has, also we're not famous, but I believe our credit card was as good as anybody else's.  Apparently, not for Alize's management.
NB! If you decide to spend one of the major holidays at this restaurant because of its great view, please make sure you will be seated at the table facing the window.

You may ask why we didn't request to bring another appetizer, replace my filet mignon or divine the lobster. Well, we really didn't want to ruin our holiday mood by fighting for what we were supposed to get in the first place. Besides, the restaurant was understaffed, they had difficult time getting everything in time as it is; can you imagine how long it would take them to bring a replacement.

You may also wonder why we never contacted the restaurant afterwards to voice our disappointment. Well, in Latin it would be vox clamantis in deserto = the voice of one crying in the desert/wilderness. If they had cared just a tiny bit about their non-celebrity clients, they would have warned us beforehand that our table would be placed at the entrance of the restaurant with a bench instead of 2 chairs, letting us decide if we still wanted to keep our reservation.

Still, we had great time there. It was a memorable New Year with dear friends. The soreness about this whole Alize experience came to me later ;)

I would definitely give Alize a chance to redeem itself next time we're in Las Vegas, but I will not visit it on any major holiday.

 P.S. Yes, Kobe Bryant was in Alize that night with his lovely wife. Of course, he was promptly seated at the prime location.",nZ6OGzoZVyChxbeTcD1Rqw,2,0,2,yw2r28a2J-dE-5kYrjkHKw

I made reservations here for my mom's birthday and when we sat down they had a little note with a key, which was for a small gift they gave her at the end. We had a big group so we decided to order a la cart and share. For starters, the escargot was flavorful and foie gras was very buttery. For entrees, the filet mignon was very tender, the lobster with truffle was delicious, the veal wellington was made well, and the smoked duck breast was good too. 

Amazing service, amazing view, and amazing food. The whole experience was worth the price. Great place for a date!

Besides eating the best french food ive had in a long time, the views of all the fireworks from the other 8 hotels was amazing.

the service was excellent at this place. it also might have helped that we had a big party. some always came by to make sure we were taken care of. 

the view of this restaurant is one of the best ive seen. its at the top of the palm hotel. i would ask to sit next to a window if i went again. i think its worth a visit if you are at the palms hotel.",zthv4fbFYh7IHBURQszmTw,0,0,3,f8OX0NRUrXfe3BsyXLwgpQ

I was lucky enough to get a corner table that was super private next to the window.  Not only did I enjoy the delicious food but I could pair it with a panoramic view of the Vegas skyline.  The meal started off with two amuse bouche's from the chef.  I ordered the mushroom crusted filet mignon at medium well.  It was a bit dry and overcooked but the flavor was delicious.  For dessert, I took advantage of Yelp's check in offer of a free soufflé with an entree order.  They had three soufflé options to choose from and I picked the chocolate soufflé.  The soufflé was so light and not too sweet as long as you avoided the sauce that they poured in the middle of it.

Took the ride up to Alize and the views are spectacular...we were seated one row from the window seats and looked piningly at the heads of those with better views.  Service was great, as expected.  Took the recommendations of the french-accented waiter...I orderd the lamb and my wife the sole...it took a while for the food to arrive...I timed conversation well so that just as the main course arrived I would have exhausted by pithy comments..with a flourish they brought sterling covered plates to our table and...voila...they uncovered the wrong dish (filet mignon with some brown sauce)...now we had to wait another 20 minutes for our food...they got it right this time and the food was excellent.  

With a little prodding they allowed up to go the Playboy room which has even better views both of the city and card dealers.  I will say, all of the employees we met at the Palms were aggressively kind...if there is something positive about economic decline...folks appreciate their jobs apparently a lot more.",otcdePK12Kuoky_UEKF9eQ,1,0,4,UFB8BrRosxakbfavQDyUNw

Prices are on the high side, but not absurdly so, especially for a special occasion. I was very appreciative that our servers didn't make fun of us for not knowing much about fancy French food and actually helped us make better choices.

The lobster bisque was incredible - constructed right in front of us. The taste and texture were delicate and absolutely delicious. The Ahi tuna was equally tasty and tastefully presented. But the highlight of my meal was the dessert. I originally ordered the Crème Brûlée, but changed to an alternative offered by our server after it seemed everyone at the table was going the same way. When your server says, ""Isn't anyone going to try the [insert whatever he or she suggests here], it's one of our best items..."", a smart diner says, ""OK, I'll have that."" I honestly can't remember what it was called, but it some sort of delicate ice cream capped with some sort of delicate pastry with chocolate fondue. I'm no foodie, so I don't know the lingo, but I can assure you these folks know chocolate. That dessert did a little happy dance in my mouth.",dQao7i5qfoS8pT844afEyA,1,0,5,3mWTMBHDgfFGC07R6QAdIQ

The bread came warm (mmm) 

Alizé Hot Appetizer Trio - 
1.Braised Veal with Truffled Potato Puree - this was REALLY good and by far my favorite from this restaurant. 
2.Grilled Fresh Water Shrimp, Curry Cream, Mango Chutney - a little overcooked
3.Seared Foie Gras with Toasted Brioche and Crème Anglaise

Phyllo Wrapped Baked Anjou Pear Salad - Roquefort Cheese, Fig Confiture, Spicy Pecans and Strawberry Vinaigrette - this was good but the fig confiture was a little too strong in flavor for me. However, everyone else in my table loved it.

For my entree I chose the King Crab & Truffle Stuffed Chicken Breast; it was a little salty but very creative and cute. The chicken was tender which I greatly appreciated. My boyfriend got the 12 oz. Austrailian Wagyu New York Strip which was VERY good. 

View is great! The one problem I had was...the bar directly downstairs is so loud it can get a little annoying for the diners at Alize.",tgV6tsYQ66DZ3LQKvtC6cw,0,0,4,PoKm-SIXN1yXNXzZXlmZcQ

Made a reservation for 2 at 6pm on a Friday. Customer service was wonderful and Nikki was more than helpful and splendid. 

Arrived a little early and was seated right away. The view is spectacular whether you get a window table or not. Service is impeccable! Staff is more than attentive and makes you feel special. They are so accommodating and answer any questions.

Both ordered the tasting menu with caviar addition. The entire experience...was more than amazing!!! Tasting menu consists of 7 or so courses and you select one item in each course. You select everything at the beginning and also get an option for tea or coffee to enjoy with little cookie nibbles before dessert comes out. 

Food was wonderful! Caviar, foie Gras, fresh shaved truffle, amuse bouche, duck, lamb, cheese, bread, etc etc etc. Even the coffee was bad ass and the way they make coffee table side was neat. 

The only item that we both did not like....was the masa crusted chicken. Duck is far superior in that course selection.

Great view. 
Great food.

Expensive (it is supposed to be)

I ordered the tasting w/ wine pairing and everything was fantastic. My only ""complaint"", not even sure it is a complaint, is that the pairing had too many white wines selected. That said, one of the pairings was a sweet white wine (Reisling I think) with the foie gras. Holy $4!1 batman - that was amazing. Perfectly seared, tiny little sea salt sprinkled on top, then BAMMM, the reisling to kiss it. 

If you are at the Palms, here is my recommendation. Even if you aren't sure about spending this much money or aren't that hungry, no matter what you do, go up to Alize and at least sit in the bar and order this one dish with this wine pairing. I don't know if they have rules against that, but if they do, offer to pay double - it is still worth it.",_scb0Wm-0SkBPLm0c-3Skg,1,1,5,SI8yYTlEr-VM2PUbRd8E5w

The mood lighting, the breath-taking glittering view of the Las Vegas strip, the wonderful tentative waiters....what a beautiful night!! My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate Valentine's Day couple weekends later. We arrived around 7pm on a Monday night. Didn't get a window seat but we were close enough to see the floor-to-ceiling windows.

The minute we stepped foot in Alize, the service was on-point. Before we even sat our butts down in our chairs, we got 3+ waiters weighing on us hand and foot. One pulled out my chair, one offered me a purse holder thing that attaches to the table, and another checked my coat in. WOW! Talk about top notch service....Alize gives it to ya!

One thing I loved about Alize was portion control. They did not give us a basket of assorted breads. Instead, a waiter came by every so often and offered us three different kinds of bread. That helped me from constantly grabbing bread and getting full before my entrée arrived.

So we ordered:
Market Greens Salad-Asparagus, Hearts of Palm, Baby Artichokes, Tête de Moine, Balsamic Vinaigrette $18. -Very enjoyable salad....boyfriend loved it very much. I will tell you this though....the more your salad looks like it came from the backyard, the more expensive it is!!! =P haha!! I swear, some looks like my pet rabbit ate for her dinner!

For an entrée, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass-Butternut Squash & Jewel Yam Purée, Brussels Sprouts, Hazelnut Pesto $48. WOW!!!! This was off the hook!! Flavoring was perfect. It was cooked to my liking...tender on the inside, charred just a bit on the outside. I'm normally not a fan of Brussels sprouts but I'm telling you, the flavoring and the way they grilled it was tasty.

Boyfriend ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb- Bacon-Almond Baklava, Baba Ganoush, Cauliflower, Apricot Lamb Jus. $58 He enjoyed his dish very well and said most likely he'll get it again.

And to my fellow Yelpers, don't forget to check in because you get a free soufflé of your choice!! We got the Grand Mariner. Also, the chef sent us another small dish of complimentary desserts that consisted of sweets and macaroons.

Fancy restaurant. I liked how it felt like we were treated like royalty that night. ;) Always a plus! Definitely a return visit whenever the circumstance arises.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,6,5,5,uYU9UIOZtQ2ksXuC8vD36g

Birthday dinner, four guests, Sunday night with a groupon. 
We are not used to dining is establishments where a meal would cost more than our weekly grocery bill as we are humble middle class Canadians,  however, for this special birthday  occasion this was a treat.
We arrived at palms hotel, stunning with sparkle. A private hostess and elevator away to bring you to the 56th floor.
We arrived early and we're seated immediately.
We were asked if we had a show to catch,  which we did so our meal was perfectly timed.

First. The wine pairing was worth every penny to accompany the tasting menu. 

Second.  The service was attentive and considerate for all our guests especially as one of our party had food allergies, they took excellent care to ensure we had no incidents.  Top notch staff wait on your every need, well coordinated like a dance.  *Please tip these fantastic people.

Third. The food was truly a pleasure to eat.  Each course came with excitement to see what the plate beneath the silver dome contained.  There was not one thing we didn't not enjoy and we also added the caviar course in my opinion we were going this far why not add this experience as well.  The good which I experienced last night i may never have the opportunity to again, I wish I could have written about each course but there is just no time was savoring this art.  Food  flavour explosion.  Bravo, your ratings are well earned and deserved.

Fourth.  The view was like a dream. We watched the vegas strip come alive as it lit up with each course.  This is the type of views which make you feel as if you are in a movie.

Cons?  None really.  
If I stretched it I could say because we used a groupon and had 2 bills at our table it was a little confusing but once it was gently explained make sense and was very much worth each and every penny.   
Also thisb may seem silly, however the facilities for woman was a real lack luster. With a meal and resturant like this i would have expected beautiful marble, candles, sparkle and proper hand wash, real cotton towels,  tooth picks and hand creams along with other complimentary toiletries, rather than the institutional mental hand pumps which were embedded into the plastic type counter top and paper towels as if visiting my college washroom.  Again this would be a piece of the experience that was overlooked and when spending 3 or more hours together chances are you too would need to visit this facility.

So overall yes a 5 star.  Be prepared if you are not use to spending $600 or more per couple bit if you do decide to try this, consider it a "" life experience : investment and enjoy every moment.",3vT0lj9uXnTveikqHQX-iQ,1,0,5,SJ8KqkcKIBl-RgyhjeiN5A

They have a 7 course for $135 and for those that can eat, this would have been a good option. However they do require the entire table to partake. Maybe next time.
We ordered seared foie gras and escargot on top of bone marrow to start. If you love escargot, you will love this appetizer. Creamy mash potato held the bone in place, topped with tasty escargot!! Heavenly!! Who would have thought that combination would work so well together. The foie gras was quite tasty but I felt a little too rich for me. For my entree I ordered the wild mushroom risotto. It is listed under the appetizer but they made it into an entree. Very good flavorful and the risotto had a perfect creaminess to it. I highly recommend if you love mushrooms and risotto. When you check in with yelp you get one free souffle. Three of us have yelp so we ordered a chocolate, a grand marnier and a carrot cake. Everyone liked the chocolate and grand marnier. The carrot cake had too strong of the cinnamon taste. Souffle is $15 so definitely check in on yelp. The staff is super friendly.

2742551,2008-07-31,2,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Let me start off by saying...I wish I could give Alize 3.5 stars...

I loved the stunning view of Vegas from the top of the Palms hotel but I was less impressed with the food and even less thrilled with the high wine prices.  My friends and I definitely splurge on food regularly so spending top $ for food is not an issue at all.  

But, in a restaurant where the least expensive bottle of wine is priced at $120, I really started to feel like my six figure salary isn't enough to support my ""wanna be"" lifestyle (we ended up having cocktails and a bottle of wine priced at $150 haa haaa).

The food was pretty good but it wasn't impressive, which made me a bit sad.  I had really high expectations for this place and for some reason, I walked away feeling a bit empty.  

We started out with some yummy starters.  
- lobster bisque was decent, but not superb. it was creamy and tasty but seemed to have too much all spice or some type of spice that really overpowered the taste of the seafood.  
- pesto escargo was surprisingly well seasoned and nicely executed; it was awesome dipping bread!
- pan seared foie gras - my friend said his was done perfectly
- warm duck confit, black truffle and spinach salad with toasted brioche and Sunnyside Quail Egg was really unique, and wasn't too salty.

Next we moved on to entrees:

- both boys had the rack of lamb which was moist and juicy but for $52 dollars, I guess I was expecting a bit more...

- NY strip with roquefort risotto...as you know, I don't like blue cheese, so when I tasted my friend's risotto, I was a bit overwhelmed.  It was so so so strong.  It overpowered the taste of the beef!

- I ordered the veal loin medallions w/ sweetbread.  It was surprisingly good.  The veal wasn't thin medallions, it was a thick cut.  It was juicy and prob the biggest piece of veal I have ever had in my life.  The sweetbreads were really yummy...there wasn't nearly enough on the plate.  The contrast of the grapefruit slices and the salty slighy crispy sweetbreads was absolutely delicious. 

Finally, we closed out the meal with dessert.  we ordered the souffle when we ordered our meal because we were told to do so by our waiter but he didn't tell us we needed to order other desserts as well.  Therefore, after our meal, we wanted to add another dessert (bananas fritters or peach strudel cigars), they said we should have ordered that before placing entree orders.  It was quite disappointing.

This is not a three star restaurant since I loved the sommelier, Blake, who was witty, not to mention I enjoyed my veal a lot.  But, this is not what I would envision a five star would be - The food was good but it wasn't fabulous.  So I struggle with the four star rating.

I definintely recommend going to have that experience...not sure I'd want to go back again though.",hH0mqIsyk6WLfn7-wHX2NQ,6,3,4,6pz6aYn8J31s-wId1nNFTQ

I started with a cucumber Collins for my drink and my friend got the new old fashioned , I really liked my drink it was light and refreshing 

I did the taste testing menu 7 courses for 155$ 

My first course was a salmon dish nothing to me stuck out tasted like a sushi but wasn't flavorful to me at all was just blah in a sense 

Second was foie gras which was very yummy melts in your mouth :) this was one my favorite dish

3rd was the scallops I think was a little over cooked honestly so not to much to say 

4th was chicken I don't like fat so I wasn't to happy that I had to cutt fat away from from my meat and I'm not sure what the mushrooms were that were in there didn't like at all 

5th was the steak can't go wrong with steak and it was cooked perfectly this was my FAVORITE 

6th was a cheese which was good I mean it's cheese lol

***they give u lots of little extras in between which is very nice ***

I got the grand marnia soufflés it was ok... wasn't really my favorite 

But he sorbert that was really great light and refreshing plus I love berries 

****my friend didn't do the taste testing he got the filet mignon which he loved he said it was cooked perfect and delicious which seemed to be true since it didn't stay long on his plate lol ****

 Odd beginning with a server who wouldn't take order even though I shared on a tight schedule. Problem was with lack of phone/internet service because of 56th floor of casino tower. Took me a bit of struggle to share my pre paid voucher.  Was just an odd way to start evening.  Anyway, 15/20 min.later was sorted out.  Unfortunately, just wasted some of our limited time. I really appreciated the serving staff as a whole, being extremely conscientious about our time commitment for the rest of our dinner.  Serving staff work together as a team and Overall, service was attentive and well received.

Hit of the evening : 'seared foie gras' came on two dishes.....exquisite!  Scallop dish also delicious, but needed an extra minute on the grill. Chocolate souffle was also excellent a wonderful bittersweet dark chocolate... Very smooth.

This restaurant had me in a quandary.... even though the food was perfectly seasoned, it would rate between 3 and 4, because of the ambience and some of the interaction with the staff members I bumped it up to a 4.....but,I really felt only one dish was exceptional.",qIJGy4K8Mh8WgWWwFuOctA,1,0,4,85GrOBtyveXKkDJ3m2rRyQ

Presenting a seven course tasting menu without any delays is a challenge in itself, but the wait staff also managed to be very attentive and personable, answering all questions and giving a helpful explanation of each dish.

Each course offers three options, including a vegetarian option.  For my first course I chose the corn soup, which was very fresh and bursting with corn flavor.  They must have access to some fantastic corn, which showed up as an ingredient if several of the dishes.

My second course was the seared foie gras, which was not overly rich the way that foie gras sometimes is, and was supported by several sweet flavors including white chocolate and orange pain perdu (that's French toast to us Americans).  A very nice version of foie gras.

For the third course I opted for the scallops, and they were as good as any I have ever had.  The corn made an appearance again, as a puree, and the wild mushrooms were a nice note.

Fourth course was the roasted chicken breast.  I don't usually order chicken in restaurants; it is more of a cook-at-home dish for me.  But I'm glad that they had a poultry course, which really showcased how well chicken can play if properly cooked and paired with a variety of supporting flavors like ricotta-stuffed morel mushrooms.

The fifth course was the star - flat iron steak with fingerling potatoes and beef jus.  Perfectly cooked, tender and tasty.

The sixth course was a selection of cheeses, and if I only knew where I could buy them I would be serving those cheeses at home as a part of every dinner.  When you compare these cheeses to what is available at your local megamart, you will conclude that they should have a whole different name for this stuff.  Maybe ""ubercheese.""

Finally, desert.  I had the cheesecake, along with a bite of my wife's chocolate souffle, and both were excellent.  After that hearty meal I appreciated the fact that the cheesecake was small - just a few bites of heaven.  The coffee was quite good as well.

It seems that the tasting menu changes frequently, so there is no guarantee that any of the dishes described above will be available on the night you go to Alize, but I have great confidence in the chef, and you will likely find some excellent choices on your tasting menu.  One tip for saving a few bucks:  Our dinner, with drinks, wine, tax and tip included, would have come to about $500, but we saved a hundred bucks by purchasing a voucher from Travelzoo.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,1,0,5,rqSDYU4e_amS2GJI5snlUw

2848888,2007-05-18,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"My first formal dinner with my gf. I received the rec from 'hounds at Chowhound. I must say, eventhough it's a little drive away from the strip, it was the fanciest dinner I've had and well worth it. 
The entrance is VIP style where a ""doorman"" asks you if you're going to the restaurant or the club (Ghostbar I believe?) via an elevator ride up to the restaurant. We had dinner here in August of '05, and it was a bit empty at the time of arrival (which I didn' mind) - right before sunset, I wanted my gf to see the view of the city. The view of the city from our table was spectacular. 

Appetizer - Pan Seared Diver Scallops. I think it must've been the freshest scallops I've ever had. I normally end up with salty, tough scallops at other places. These were seasoned just right with the mixture of cheese and bacon. The mixture of ingredients didn't make it salty at all, but fused together beautifully with so much flavor. Texturewise, the scallops were firm, not tough, and melted in my mouth. Score!

Entrees - Green Peppercorn Crusted Filet Mignon (myself) and Grilled Prime New York Strip Steak (gf). We both ordered them rare. The steaks were both flavored just right and the portions were quite good for a fancy restaurant like this. We both ended up sharing each others steaks. 

Dessert - Compliments of the chef!! They were home made chocolates and my gf ended up taking all of them. :)

Service - Since walking in, we were treated like royalty. The staff was super attentive, but not overbearing. Anything and everything we needed or wanted came without hesitation.

I believe dinner was around $200 something with tip (no wine). Well worth it. I would suggest a window seat and earlier in the evening during the week for a really romantic dinner. I recently looked on their website and now they have a tasting menu. The next time the gf and I come to Sin City, we will surely be back.",EE9txZm_zUFqWeYGVGaFNg,2,4,5,u4M9xgwWPSD659dv1xQRjQ

Alize has a very nice design/interiors, takes good advantage of views.  Has a great corner table on the SE corner, where I sat next to my spouse in a booth and we had a full panoramic view to the east of the Strip - very nice.

Service was very good, only mistep was we requested to see the price fixe menu (we like to see these, although we do not always order off of them if they do not offer things we like), and waiter strongly dissuaded us for ordering off the menu - suggested it was much lower quality than the main menu (which is generally not the case in my experience - most fine restaurants offer price fixe as limited options of similar quality - they will not serve food that tarnishes the perception of their fine restaurants).  I sensed the upsell here more than a recommendation fully in the customer's interests.

Would up ordering one price fixe menu item and a series of a la carte items, both were very good - high quality, creative, well prepared/presented.  Rocket salad, french onion soup, ribeye with bean ragout, other items were very good.

One can easily spend $150-$300 per person here with food and wine, so be prepared, as this is a fine dining experience.

2913879,2008-08-20,3,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"One of my earlier Vegas trips, I stayed at the Palms with the boy, and since I love foie gras, ( I mean LOVE), we decided to try Alize.
I had the boy call and make reservations, which our entire stay they referred to him as Mr. L, which I thought was hilarious...anyways, he made reservations, we got all dolled up, and I don' t mean my slutty club going attire, I mean nice dressy attire.
We checked in with the host downstairs, then were escorted up in the elevator to the hostess upstairs, (really, is this necessary?). Alize is spectacular, the view is amazing, and the decor is how I would envision my French Secret Garden. White and gold, red velvet cushy chairs, beautiful, (make sure to time your dinner for sunset like we did, it was sooooo gorgeous).
Our waitress was nothing but nice,although not as attentive as I would expect in a restaurant like this. I did get the distinct feeling that everyone was staring at us, and judging us...you know that nightmare when you are giving a speech naked in front of a crowd...yea, that one. I mean really, I get that we were MUCH younger than everyone else there, but I work hard for my money, and I love spending it on food...so don't judge me for trying o dine with you!
On to the food, we ordered our meal, and our dessert as we were instructed to do, then over came the sommelier. Now usually, I love having someone make suggestions for me, but this guy rubbed me wrong every way he could. The boy isn't really a wine drinker, so I had the wine list, I was asking the questions about a syrah, BUT the sommelier was addressing the boy, and ignoring me completely. Rude beyond belief, I mean, I get that normally the male would do the ordering of everything, but the boy even told Mr. Sommelier that he didn't really know a lot about wine, and that I did, and that I would be drinking it. After much arguing with Mr. Sommelier, I ended up with a 1/2 bottle that cost $120....now I'm not cheap, an I knew this meal would be pricey, but really? $120 for a half bottle of syrah? I would have given ALize 4 stars had it not been for Mr. Sommelier.
That said, the food was outstanding, we had:

 Pan Seared Foie Gras 
à la Façon du Chef 

Phyllo Wrapped Baked Anjou Pear
Roquefort Cheese, Raspberries, Spicy Pecans and Raspberry Vinaigrette


Pan Seared Muscovy Duck Breast and Cherry Stuffed Duck Leg
Foie Gras Mousse, Haricots Verts, Pine Nuts and Smoked Bacon
Orange Shallot Sauce

Herb Crusted Colorado Rack of Lamb
Stuffed with Apricot and Merguez Sausage
Prosciutto Crusted Leeks, Fondant Potatoes
Feta Cheese Croustillant, Horseradish Leek Jus and Lamb Jus

chocolate souffle

An absolutely lovely meal, not 5 star by San Francisco standards, but the food was divine. The service needs improvement, especially the sommelier. Some lower price point wines would be nice, and while this is a high end restaurant, it would be nice if the younger crowd could dine here and not feel like martians.",8XmIIleAnuhOwB7EJjSaGQ,3,2,3,0oCDKSt85qum6hg1aSydyw

As a vegetarian, tasting menus can sometimes be lacking in options. Not here. Each course was carefully prepared and you could tell a lot of thought went into each dish, for both carnivores and herbivores. The pumpkin gnocchi was amazing! It was so soft and delicate, it melted in my mouth. Tempe! It was cooked perfectly, and so flavorful. The only course I thought was missing something was the salad. It was just arugula wrapped in cucumbers with no real dressing. It was honestly the only course our of 7 that I thought was the ""bozo"" dish. Overall, the meal was delicious!

While the menu does not have a wide taste range (almost every dish contains mushrooms or truffles), the food is very focused and quite good.  The restaurant feels like an event and the management clearly understands this is what their customer is there for, with almost every table set as a two-top facing the stunning top floor views.  If you are in Vegas for a romantic getaway, this feature alone should warrant a visit for dinner.

During my last visit, my wife and I experienced some of the worst service we'd ever had in a fine dining restaurant.  Our dishes were rushed in and out, the service staff barely spoke to us, and the most memorable part of the meal was how quick it was.  This latest visit was completely different.  Our meal was very well paced, allowing us time to enjoy each dish.  Our server, food runner, and busser were available whenever we needed them.  This meal was entirely enjoyable and worth the money we spent.

I will make a recommendation for you when ordering your entrees - order the chocolate fondant dessert at the same time.  As it takes 20 minutes to prep, you'll be happy that you ordered it early.

They were able to accommodate so I give them credit.

The food was not up to standard for my lamb chop was from Colorado instead of New Zealand.  For $50+, I really didn't expect a lamb chop that looked like a rib-eye steak.  It wasn't that flavorful and didn't tasted much like lamb.  

At the end of the dinner,  I tried to pay and no one really wanted to take my credit and check.  I flags down a waiter and he didn't look like he wanted to help.

3043945,2015-09-08,2,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"we initially enjoyed our dining experience at alize (*initially being the key -- please see caveat -- con #3 at the end). there are so many michelin-starred french restaurants in vegas and we ended up choosing alize because they had an amazing travelzoo deal ($149 for a 6-course tasting for two), and because it has a breathtaking view, located on the 56th floor. 

pros: 
1. service while dining was impeccable. we weren't treated any differently despite using the travelzoo voucher (i would hope not, because we never would have come to alize if not for the voucher. im sorry and appalled to read other reviews where people felt treated poorly because of the voucher). we were seated at a window-front table with an expansive city light view of the strip. waitstaff was extremely attentive but not overbearing. pace of dining was leisurely and appropriate, and gives you a chance to enjoy the view and relax.

2. the view is breathtaking. we stayed at the palazzo on the 47th floor and the view was similar, but it's truly an experience to be able to dine with that view in front of you.

cons: 
1. the food was less than stellar. we have many great french restaurants in LA and this is not up to par. highlights were the chilled vichyssoise soup, and the sautéed foie gras (which was notably ""tasting menu"" sized). lowlights were the lamb, which was gristly, the seared salmon with forbidden rice -- the spring roll was like a $1 egg roll from panda express. smoked fish trio, diver scallop, and duck entree were fine, but not outstanding. 

2. location at the palms. this was once considered a cool hotel for a brief 15 minutes of fame over 10 years ago, but now it's outdated and tired.

3. the part that really left me with a bad taste in my mouth was after the dining experience. the server and i forgot to exchange the travelzoo voucher information (however we were charged the amount less the voucher -- about $91 of tax, gratuity, and alcohol) so i received a LOVELY voicemail at midnight stating that if i did not call them back ASAP with the voucher number, ""the extra amount will be charged to the credit card on file."" im sorry, but that sounds like a thinly veiled threat, and since when do restaurants keep customers' full credit card information on file?? oh, so you keep the credit card info to threaten customers with unauthorized charges later? i see. is that even legal when we clearly signed and authorized only a specific amount - $91 - to be charged to the card?? if you ask me nicely, i will gladly call you back DURING A NON-UNGODLY HOUR AND WHEN YOU ARE ACTUALLY OPEN and give you the voucher info. 

good lord, threatening patrons with unauthorized illegal charges at midnight is not the way a michelin star restaurant should operate. if you are actually keeping customers' full credit card information on file to threaten them later with charges, then that's a violation of privacy and a security hazard. we won't be returning or recommending this place to anyone. if you want service that is legal, and french food that is actually good, please go to joel robuchon or picasso.",HODxLhIMSvB2b7TzQ230UA,3,1,2,63A5C2pmwlPC-qi1ikDMUQ

We have 7 course menu from travelzoo and there is no trouble with service. Good value. There is a choice of 2 meats items on each course plus 1 vegetarian option. We pick almost everything on that list except vegetarian.  

Wine: champagne. 
Appetizer : water melon does not tasted like they do anything to it. Foie gras is good.
Main dish: Personal favorite is squab and scallop.   All other food is just ok. 
Cheese course: we are not a fan, but it is fun to have. 
Dessert: Chocolate and Grand Marnier souffle were heavenly! Portion is good and you won't leave hungry.

Entering from the elevator on the 56th floor of the Palms Ivory Tower the views looking south, north and east are spectacular. I recommend requesting a table along the east windows. An early dining time affords a better chance for a window table.

We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation and were seated immediately. Service throughout the evening was excellent. The wait staff was friendly, helpful and attentive. The food presentation is extraordinary. Empty plates were removed immediately.

We selected the Three Course Tasting Menu which began with a choice of wonderful breads and rolls. The Parmesan Lavash was especially tasty.
The Amuse Bouche was a combination of panna cotta with crab and a gazpacho. Both were a nice introduction to the following. 

First course: The French Onion soup was hot with bubbly cheese. The Caesar Salad had a balance of flavors with a light taste of anchovy.

Entrees: Chilean Sea Bass was moist and delicious. Beef Rib Eye was cooked to perfection and served sliced. The Bordeaux sauce on the side had a rich beef/wine flavor.

Dessert Course consisted of Chocolate Soufflé and Vanilla Bean Crème Brulee. Both were excellent.

The Petiti Fours were brought out on a trolley cart. There was a large selection to choose and each beautifully created and tasty.

Since we were celebrating our wedding anniversary we were treated to a box of truffles to take home. It was a wonderful surprise ending to a superb dining experience.

A few times plates were attempted to be taken while we were still eating, but we understood this was just so we weren't sitting with dirty plates, not to rush us.  We had purchased the travelzoo 6 course tasting meal for two.  This was a wonderful value for 140 bucks.  Stand outs for us were the sautéed foie gras (my husband's favorite and excellently prepared), the roasted chicken (very tender), the scallops (prepared perfectly) and the soufflés (although my husband felt they were a bit too eggy).  Drinks were pricey at 16-18 dollars for a cocktail or glass of wine, but it is vegas.  We would definitely go again, but wouldn't  pay the full asking price for the tasting menu probably (145 a person).

Really? All the other tables seemed to have gotten a lot of attention except us. I felt very unwanted there so we got out of there as fast as possible and will not be returning. 

Also, when they bring the check they ask that you fill it out(sign, tip, total) when you give it to them with your card because according to the server the card can only be ran once.

The restaurant specializes in French food and has a very good wine selection.  All the alcohol is listed on an iPad presented by the wait staff.  Very comfortable restaurant and the service I received was excellent.  Started with the Escargot, this was delicately placed on top of bone marrow with garlic herb butter, halved heirloom tomatoes and garlic chips all atop mashed potatoes.  Very elegantly presented and had a wonderful combination of flavors.  Moved to my second course, this consisted of Angus beef carpaccio accompanied with a quail egg yolk--provided a wonderful richness to the plate, delicately sliced Parmesan cheese, a beef tartar--very good, with a smattering of mustard sauce and a few pickled vegetables. Very good course.  Next course presented was a wonderful sautéed foie gras gently placed atop caramelized apple slices, with almond streusel toasted oat cream and a blackberry puree--excellent presentation, and a great course (almost like a dessert).  Moved to a fish course, this was a great presentation of Nduja (spicy Italian sausage) crusted scallop--done perfectly, accompanied with butternut squash and parsnip hash and a velvety orange-amaretto Velouté sauce (a classic French sauce).  My poultry course consisted of a beautiful sliced tea smoked duck breast with a sautéed foie gras and Kai-lan (a Chinese kale) accompanied with a delicate spiced apple jus and a crispy fried soba noodle cake.  Excellent course the duck was done perfectly and all the flavors melded everything together.  My main course was a Colorado Lamb chop grilled perfectly, this was accompanied by a glazed Kofta sausage (a Moroccan style spicy sausage) and the tzatziki cream sauce with pomegranate and broccolini and a wonderful apricot mustard jus.  This dish reminded me of some of the Moroccan or even middle eastern spices and flavors, very good.  Moved on to a cheese course, this was presented nicely and consisted of a slice of L'Etivaz (a hard Swiss cheese similar to Gruyere) a wonderful Sweet Onion & Honey Confiture, Rye Toast and a drizzle of Balsamic Vinegar.  And the last course was a wonderfully light and airy chocolate soufflé with chocolate sauce--excellent preparation.  Overall, the meal was magnificent, service was outstanding, Claudio Vigani (wine director) was extremely helpful and all the wait staff were attentive and accommodating.  I can see why this is a Michelin rated restaurant--should have at least 2 stars.  A definite place to visit for a special enticing experience.",H446eHNe3lz4zLriZMTPDQ,0,0,5,NdJ1teFL4nQkNNaCY4OFgg

When you walk in, the view is stunning and we were fortunate enough to get a window table.  When you make a reservation, ask for a table by the window on the West side of the building because those are the best views of the entire strip.  The atmosphere is very romantic with dim lighting, windows across every wall and dark wood booths with red cushions.  The service was spectacular for the most part.  While the sommelier was helpful, he was a bit of a snob when we chose a lowly $175 bottle of wine.  It was completely overpriced and we were not going to spend more than that because the markup was about 500%.  Ridiculous.  However, we did not let his little attitude ruin our evening and the rest of the staff was so wonderful.  I love that the main courses are brought out under silver domes and removed at the same time.  It entertains me everytime!

The amuse bouche was a wonderful pasta with smoked salmon and prosciutto.  As a starter, I ordered the scallops and my husband ordered the French onion soup.  The soup was some of the best but the scallops were the best scallops we have ever put in our mouths.  I had a completely different experience than Cynthia because these scallops were plump and fresh with a delicious accent of bacon and scallions, but I cannot remember the sauce.  They were the best.

Then, my husband had the green peppercorn filet and I had the duck.  The filet was delicious and the duck was very well prepared.  The duck included a puff pastry with peaches and foie gras on top.  Yum.  Although we sufficiently stuffed ourselves, we continued on with the beignets for dessert and they were a divine, sweet finish to an inspiring meal.  After having a few disappointing meals in Vegas, this was definitely a turning point and a high standard of dining on or off the strip.",R0KVWeN9xR-F6j4z5k9wXQ,3,5,5,0msuEdVNuB6xBqhV4okXyw

Located at the top of the Palms Hotel & Casino, all tables have an insane evening view of the Vegas lights at night since there is floor to ceiling glass all around. But the view is really the added bonus.

The food and service are incomparable. I do miss their previous version of escargot that was created in a wonderful lengthwise split bone with bone marrow presentation. Last time I was there it had changed.

I always have their cheese plate to start, where you get to choose 3 cheeses from a cart of 6 or so. The cheeses aren't sliced tableside - a beautiful plate is presented moments later with added fruit, nuts and other embellishments, looking as if ready for a museum display.

That same attention to detail is given the other food as well. I've had the Dover Sole, the Lobster Thermidor and the filet, among other things. Everything so delicious and creative.

Definitely preorder the Grand Marnier soufflé. Or the chocolate, if you're so inclined. The top so fluffy it's like air - has to be negative calories. Has to be. Right?

When we questioned the waiter he responded that we only ask about the program and didn't specify that was what we wanted....we feel that he knew what we wanted he just saw an opportunity and took advantage of it.

3480876,2009-10-06,1,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"We were at a company reward function and Alize was chosen.  I liked this restaurant a lot.  Maybe I'm easily impressionable but it all started with the salad which at first I thought was salmon ""hmm I didn't order salmon"" then looked closer to see it was thinly sliced tomato's and greens as well as goat cheese, it was fantastic, I have no idea how the chef was able to slice tomato's like that.   I'm picky with salad,  this one was so well done.  

Then on to the rib eye, good, nice..and filling, I'm not a big eater so it was good to be able to eat the entire meal.  Then desert..so good I almost cried..don't know what it was, but some cream thing where the chef flamed the top to create a hard candy like surface, and graced it with a little fresh fruit.

The only thing that fell flat here.  The wine..when we asked what it was, the server said ""a mix""  I'm guessing a mix of swill, water, and something which created an unpleasant aftertaste after about 10 seconds in your mouth.  They made up with it with the Sherry.  It's a shame that such a great restaurant doesn't hire a wine consultant to get it right, white wine would have probably gone better with most of the dishes, but then again I've never been much of a fan of red wines.

Great meal, then we were on to watch the Play Phantom of the Opera which rounded off the evening which highlighted the trip.

3486312,2011-01-11,1,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I think generally, Vegas is where famous chefs go to make a buck and where cooking goes to die. There are exceptions (Robuchon, though way too expensive for what you get...and I had a very good meal at Picasso) but the quality is usually too low and prices way too high. You buy reputation rather than food.

I recently ate at Alizé on two consecutive nights. I have to say that in both cases I had very good meals. The first night far surpassed my expectations and the second night met my expectations. Great experiences. The ambiance...awesome view, nice layout and lighting...set the mood for a convivial dining experience. The service was meticulous and friendly without being underfoot. The sommelier, it should be noted, was terrific.

On both nights I started with Bouquet of Baby Greens (Caraway Cracker, Goat Cheese, Balsamic Vinaigrette). Fresh, flavorful and imaginatively served. On the first evening I had Wasabi & Sesame Crusted Rack of Lamb (Tagine Vegetables, Dried Apricots, Dates, Lamb Jus). It was delicious. The wasabi in no way overpowered the flavor of lamb. While in another case I might have a bit of mustard with lamb, this took the place of it in a more elegant, integrated combination. Inspired. On the second evening I ordered the oasted Venison Loin (Sweet & Sour Cabbage, Wild Mushroom Herb Spaetzle, Poivrade Sauce). It too was very good. The venison (from New Zealand) wasn't gamey in the least.

On the first night I ordered the Grand Marnier Soufflé for dessert. No matter how delicious, I couldn't do it a second night. Yum.

Great service, excellent wine list and sommelier, beautifully prepared menu, prices in line with Vegas dining, superb views and ambiance. A great way to spend an evening in Las Vegas.

Service is impeccable and at this caliber of restaurant you as a diner will demand - they will deliver. I appreciate the thoroughness in explanation as well as preparation to address any questions that goes into the service. It is rare that such an upscale restaurant is able to avoid being overly pretentious, but Alize accomplishes this.

The food is equally on par with the service as it should be. As with a restaurant like Alize, I believe the tasting menu is the way to go. However, if you choose to order alla carte you will have numerous, excellent choices in which to choose from. The foie gras terrine is a particular favorite of mine. The veal wellington, also noted by a lot of reviewers, is wonderful. 

Alize certainly runs on the higher end of the spectrum in terms of price point, even in Vegas, but you're here after all - you should be enjoying yourself and experiencing something special.",MwliVGpzMMOCPFYbgmq1yg,0,0,5,9jpvVkg9cXoP3Q4hahxJBg

In general we had a nice experience there.  We ordered the prix fixe with the regular wine pairing (not the sommelier wine pairing.  Left us wondering then who did the pairing for the regular pairing?).  

The view from the window seating was beautiful.
The service was very nice from friendly staff all around to a very attentive waitress.  
Food was yum, and the courses that kept on coming kept us on our toes.  

A side note: two orders of wine pairing was a bit much for us.  I think we could have shared one glass.  

One star off because for how much we paid I'd expect to be knocked off my feet by the experience.  I mean overall was a nice special meal but definitely was too pricey.

If this is a Michelin star restaurant then Michelin standards are no more for me.
But emotions aside, let's talk about busyness.
AMBIANCE: nothing remarkable, but with great views.
SERVICE: polite, trying to be professional, but still doesn't give an impression of a high class level with a few slips accrued. 
FOOD: was a complete failure in our case. From all the courses of our $155 (+$20 for the caviar course) tasting menu not even one was interesting, creative, well presented or at least really tasty. EVERYTHING was so bland and mediocre that you feel that for this kind of prices you are being actually insulted. We tasted many tasting menus in other high caliber restaurants. Some were better then others, some not, but NEVER we paid this kind of money ($343 total after redeeming our $150 gift certificate which equals almost $500) leaving half hungry and very disappointed in all aspects of dining except the view).
And that speaks about the VALUE point. Yes we can afford this kind of dining, but in return the restaurant (if it charges this kind of prices) should at least provide some satisfaction to the patrons who are willing to spend it here. This place failed in this department completely.",sCCJsk38T49wUA12dQzyiA,1,0,1,_uX6mpB44wCYLulXioqVqQ

View from Alize was spectacular! (better than mix) Our group pictures came out awesome because of this great view. I sampled all dishes my girls ordered. Everything was pretty good especially pan seared foie gras, roasted pork belly and lamb chop. (I have to say I think seared foie gras at Andre is slightly better)

I am not going to details about our dishes. I want to talk about service here.  My girls got me a custom fondant cake with big pink bow on top. Alize charged $8 per piece as slicing fee. They also decorated each piece of cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I thought that was wonderful. There are some places on strip charge same price but don't give you anything extra!

The tasting menu was played very safe; you had typical dayboat scallops, a grilled protein (pork, beef), and maybe a soup or salad for starters.  The execution was decent, but not great.  The menu was very traditional with very little room for flair or improvisation.  Service itself was terrific at some points of the meal, and lackluster at other points of the meal.

After reviewing so many Michelin-star restaurants in Las Vegas, I decided Alizé has the most appealing tasting menu; and boy, was I glad I made that decision!! 

BF and I came here on 12/24/14 for our Christmas eve/Anniversary dinner, and the staffs couldn't had been more helpful and fun. We were promptly seated upon arrival (unlike Le Cirque.... over 45 minutes of wait, with reservation!!) Alizé even had a ""happy anniversary"" card along with a secret key await us on our table, which was located on the edge of the restaurant and oversee a very nice and romantic evening view.

Here's what we had ordered from the their tasting menu:
-Russian Golden Ostera Caviar & Truffle Caviar (an additional $20 supplement:) we particularly enjoyed the salmon gravlax and the truffle gelée.
-Hamachi Tartare & Smoked Fish Trio: BF got the honor of eating the fish trio, and to my surprise, he enjoyed them all (he's a finicky, non-fish eater...)
-Sautéed Foie Gras & Foie Gras Terrine: Oh, the sautéed foie gras had to be the most decadent dish of this whole meal. The creaminess paired with the sweet potato purée, plus the apple chutney, then smeared on top of the brioche... my mouth is watering again as I'm typing this review!
-Steamed Salmon & Pumpkin Gnocchi: what I really enjoyed about the Salmon dish is the unique sauce that was poured over it.
-Duck Breast & Wild Mushroom Risotto: I ordinary hate eating animal skin since it grosses me out, but for some reason I didn't mind the skin that came with the duck breast. 
-Rack of Lamb & Veal Wellington: these two are the main features of this tasting experience. Veal wellington was extremely tender and juicy, the truffle jus most certainly complimented the veal nicely. oh, and the rack of lamb, it was served boneless!! 

******** We never got to finished the rest of the meal since my BF was a bit under the weather during the entire meal, I told the staffs we will call it an early night. To which not only they gracefully obliged, they also had the cheese plates boxed for me. And since they cannot get the desserts to go for us, they included a variety of macaroons for me to take back to the hotel.****************

-Tête De Moine & Robiola
-Toasted Spice Marshmallow & Grand Marnier Soufflé

Honestly, for a 7-course tasting menu, $135 per person was actually a very good deal. And if you can make it an even better meal, make sure to order their wine pairing, which cost an additional $95 per person. Though a bit under the weather, my BF and I really enjoyed the services, wines, and most certainly the food. Unlike any other fine dining restaurants, the staffs were unpretentious, and genuinely friendly. They even started to joke with us toward the end of the meal. We had a fabulous time!!

Oh, and the secret key that was offered to us in the beginning of the meal? It opened up a very cute little box which contained a pastry for us to take home. It was a very sweet and lovely gesture. We will definitely come back the next time we visit Vegas, and I am confident anyone that visits this restaurant would enjoy it as much as I did!!",8p9OUrGi0Jf_DNdA1GKxPA,3,2,5,CY3zLdOmO6JWPT1Zm0TKqw

I dropped $650 for dinner for two before tip and my dining partner had bones in her fish (and I later discovered one lodged in her throat!), sauces were hardened to plate, service was very old school and overall my feeling is they need to hire a restaurant consultant to make them in to what they think they are instead of what they actually are.

I'm stunned the chef didn't personally come out and talk to us over such a basic but dangerous prep oversight.  I was stunned when a comp wasn't offered.  I was more stunned that it took me THREE letters until I got a response offering a $100 gift certificate to come back. (why would I ?)

I have to say the wine parings were quite good but the bar and the wine set up was just a weird set-up and awkward all the way around.

I found my way to Alizé which is located right off of the casino floor.  The hostess that ushers you into the elevator that will whisk you to the top of the Palms stopped me cold.

""You can't bring that drink in"".  I looked at her quizzically, but not really missing a beat - I downed that sucker and put the empty glass on her little podium.  Not really the way to enjoy Bushmills, but I appreciated her steadfast allegiance to the house rules.

When I entered Alizé I was taken aback by the sheer beauty of the space.  A warm labyrinth of wooden architecture leads you into a room that floats above the Las Vegas skyline.  The atmosphere is airy, crisp - and the seating is comfortable.  Ooohs and ahhs as we saw the moon ascend over the tortured Las Vegas strip was the perfect entree to the Alizé experience.

The French Onion soup was a slight disappointment.  The broth had an oily consistency and left a slight coating on the tongue.  However, the salad that accompanied it was beautifully done.  Nuggets of roquefort interplayed with a sparkling vinaigrette that rode herd over beautifully arranged greens.  It was absolutely incredible.

Next, I had the filet.  5 stars on this one.  It was accompanied by a Wagu brisket that I'll remember for a long time.  However, the brussels sprouts that were to accompany it were all but nonexistent.

Others at our table had the Gruyere and Asparagas Risotto.  They were disappointed.  It was too rich, and the taste too cloying.  More than half was left on their plates, one plate was virtually untouched after one taste - which added another disappointment - they were not asked by the wait staff if there was a problem. 

The Grand Marnier Souffle was exquisite. 

All in all a great experience, but not what it should be.  4 stars for ambience, the filet and the ballsy hostess who actually helped me create a nice buzz for dinner.",KnZ6CiJuH1lufLl3r5mSFg,1,1,4,VeXoDxArMCDIgCUqkkeCQA

I was seated right away with my prearranged reservation and I placed my order. The restaurant week menu was surprisingly good, and this restaurant had a lot of options. 

I was given a tasting bite of Foie gras and carrot soup to start, compliments of the chef and both were excellent. The breads were also warm and tasty. I ordered the beet salad with goat cheese to start, the flavors was the perfect combination of sour, salty, tarty, and slightly sweet.

The views were just AMAZING!! 

On the table was an envelope with a card inside that said Happy Anniversary and then a key on a plate in front of the card. In the card it said thank you for choosing them and at the end of the evening you will use the key to open a small gift from the Alize team. 

They brought us water and a drink menu that was listed on an IPad. I got the raspberry tea and the hubby got a cocktail can't remember the name but he said it was good. 

For appetizer we ordered the mushroom risotto (delicious) then for the entre I got the Filet Mignon and hubby got the bone in Rib Eye (both were amazing). For dessert (which you have to order when ordering the meal since it takes 25 min to make) we got the Grand Marnier Soufflé (which was delicious but we wish we got the chocolate instead). 

We also got tons of bread and they let us get one of each kind of bread, and there were two starters we didn't order but we received for free. The first was a potato and cheese dish with some caviar on top and a red sauce. It went great with the bread and then a pop over type bread with a cup of a beef broth that you dip the bread into. And complementary assorted chocolate treats after dessert. Not sure if everyone got this since we only saw a few tables getting them but it might depend on what you ordered.

foie gras with granola and apple- first time i had foie gras. melt in your mouth delicious. tartness of the apple cut right through the fat. very nice
scallop with potato risotto- this is where i first saw a non-rice risotto. the sweetness of the scallop paired nicely with the creaminess of the potato

entrees:
new york strip with braised shortrib and st. andres cheese- cheese added a nice salty touch to this otherwise plain steak.

Service was impeccable but disappointingly rude which is the only reason we gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because judging by food alone it absolutely deserves a 10. The sommelier and servers didn't even attempt to hide their condescension at our having gotten a ""deal"" on TravelZoo - despite meal/wine pairing setting us back almost $400. We are well versed in wines and have dined at multiple Michelin starred restaurants but were explained things as though we were classless peasants, not to mention treated as though we were broke backwoods yokels. To reiterate, the treatment was only due to the promotion we'd purchased, as we were dressed appropriately, arrived on time, didn't drink too much, etc.

The courses however, should not be completely overshadowed by service. All entrees were absolutely breathtaking in both presentation and creativity. Being Californians, we miss our fois gras, and Alize's did not underwhelm! Everything was cooked to perfection, the duck, scallops, hamachi, salmon, and the souffle at the end was stunning!

I ordered the following:

Roasted Beets With Aged Goat Cheese, Quinoa, Port Braised Cipollini Onion, Arugula And Truffle Vinaigrette
I loved the harmony of flavor with the aged goat cheese and the mildly sweet beets. I couldn't really taste the truffle, but it was great nonetheless. If you are not a fan of beets, stay away.

Sauteed Irish Salmon With Black Olive Puree, Sauteed Spinach, Artichoke Ravioli And Limoncello Nag
The salmon was cooked right to perfection, a second more would've spoiled the salmon. The most surprisingly p art was the artichoke ravioli which had a black cover. The flavor was plain, but with the limoncello sauce and the black pasta skin, it was interestingly delightful.

Caramel Crunch Banoffee With Toasted Coconut Cream
I liked the flavor and the texture, but had a hard time eating it with my spoon. The tart shell is extremely hard with the caramel crunch crusted on the bottom. I risked clinking the plate a few times, but go through with it with no plates broken.

3877260,2017-03-24,3,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"If you're looking for a romantic dinner date, Alizé at the Top of the Palms has one of the most spectacular views of Las Vegas on the Strip. While Michelin decided to temporarily suspend their reviews of Las Vegas restaurants in 2010, it is noteworthy that Alizé secured one of those prestigious stars in both 2008 and 2009. Today, the menu features a $155, 7-course tasting menu with the additional option for an 8th caviar supplement (+$20). After taking a quick elevator ride up to the 54th floor, we were quickly seated by the window for a meal that would last 2 hours.

Service starts off excellent as they ask for any food allergies or sensitivities. Alizé is one of the few restaurants that I've come across that offer many gluten-free alternatives (more to come on that later). Dinner started off with an amuse of vegetable terrine and a tomato yuzu broth, both of which were quite savory and primed our palettes for what was to come. As for the caviar course, I ordered the basil, while my girlfriend ordered the sesame. Both were enjoyable, although I didn't think it was worth the $20 supplement. The flavors of the basil and sesame overwhelmed the delicate caviar. 

For the first course, I got the smoked salmon with quail egg, avocado, capers, and dill aioli, while my girlfriend got the chilled snow crab & octopus salad. The salmon was a deconstructed version of a lox of sorts - a little bit salty, but good. I very much liked the crab and octopus. It was fresh, refreshing and a great cold seafood dish. The second course was possibly my favorite of the meal. We had the sauteed foie gras and the foie gras torchon. The combination of the foie gras with the cranberry scone and cranberry reduction was divine. The torchon when combined with the fig compote had such an amazing sweet and savory flavor. The third course varied from the online menu as we had the mahi mahi served over a saffron broth and seared scallop. The fish looked quite dry, so I was pleasantly surprised by how easily the flakes broke off. Seared scallops are difficult to screw up and was of your standard variety.

Our poultry course consisted of the quail and the hen. The hen came with a wonderful potato cake, while the quail had a porcini stuffing. Our last entree consisted of a veal Wellington. The veal was well-cooked, but the puff pastry crust became quite soggy from sitting in the sauce a bit too long. These meat courses were probably my least favorite of the night, both in execution and flavor. The cheese cart features a selection of numerous imported cheeses of which you can choose 3 to share. Not only did we have a dessert, there was also a pre-dessert item, which was a raspberry sorbet with whipped cream. It might have been even better than the actual dessert, which was the Grand Marnier soufflé and a cheesecake. The amazing thing was that the gluten-free version of the soufflé had an amazing rise and was made of rice flour. Lastly, the meal ended with coffee brewed siphon-style by a Cona vacuum. 

The service was impeccable and the timing of the food service was on point. The prix fixe was everything that I would expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant. Tip: If you're celebrating a special occasion, let them know before hand and they will present you with a key at the beginning of the meal that will open up a box to a small gift at the end.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,4,4,4,b66vPzaHRWhK-CZs8C2OIw

After reading all of these fabulous reviews, both of us looked forward to dining at this twice Michelin rated restaurant.  The terms of the TZ voucher require users to give them a heads up when you make the required reservation.  This gives the manager advance notice to save voucher users the only table **directly** facing a wall.  There shouldn't even be a table there.  Why go to a restaurant known for its view to be given a seat like that?

This, along with the way we were asked how much we paid for our voucher several times, made us distinctly aware of how pretentious this place is.  One couldn't help but be made to feel second class.   The food was alright but the experience was overwhelmingly disappointing.

We made it clear we did not want to be there for 3 hours so to keep it moving as we finished our courses. Each dish had so much character and flavor. My favorite probably being the rack of lamb- Delicious and cooked to perfection. After finishing off our bottle of wine the sommelier came over and recommended a 30yr port (our favorite) that once again was delightful. We will absolutely be coming back soon.

It was the summer tasting menu on the restaurant's web page.  Suffice it to say the food was good, the company was excellent, and the view was stunning as always.

This was my 4th time to Alizé and most likely my last.  The reason for this came at the end of the meal.  When we got the bill, we noticed we were charged for the caviar course but we didn't order the posted $20 supplement for the one caviar.  

When brought to the attention of our captain, she condescendingly stated that she always tells everyone that there is an additional charge for the caviar course--that it's not one of the 7 courses.  Well, this time she didn't, but she was sure she was right.  The online menu has subsequently been changed so there's little chance for confusion.  The amount was taken off the bill but she missed the point totally.  Her customer service was awful!

This was one of my favorite places to go because of the food and the view.  I can get good food elsewhere and there are other places in town with a great view and great food, too.  How's that for a ""twist"" in my feelings?

We ordered the Chilled Seafood Platter...Invited guests were Lobsters neatly halved and easily accessed so to maintain your sexiness as you eat.  King Crab legs, also sexy ready...careful of the butter drip though...succulent raw oysters on the half shell...chill and with the perfect texture and freshness10 point Prawns, Party on your pallet baby; it was nice.  Try with a buttery Chardonnay like Cakebread.  Your senses erupt with the freshness and abundance of it all.  Honestly, if we would have stopped at the Seafood Platter and wine, I would have given one or two more stars but alas, tradition calls for the Entree... I had the Fillet.  It was dry and overdone like, again, it was out too soon and placed under a heating lamp.  Didn't have that just off the grill sizzle happening to it.  I understand the challenges of x amount of Chefs and cooks servicing x squared patrons, but my job is to eat, theirs is to satisfy.  I gave it an ""Ok"" due to it being so SEXY and perhaps, on another night, the Fillet would curl my toes.

They finally started moving once the groom sarcastically asked for a second round of drinks.  Their old fashioned is excellent! The view from the 56th floor of The Palms was really nice too.

I got the escargot appetizer. It was great tasting, although a little small (6 snails). The sauce was awesome with some of the provided bread.

For my entree I got the Pan Seared Muscovy Duck Breast with Foie Gras & Black Truffle Terrine, Chorizo Sausage, Quinoa, and Chanterelles.  Two other guys got the Lamb and the groom got the filet.  All of it was delicious. I highly recommend the duck and steak.

4069044,2015-04-06,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I understand that to really get a great meal in Las Vegas, you must spend a lot of money, maybe double what you'd have to spend in any other town in the United States. And that's really the proposition at this restaurant, touting fine French cuisine, old school service and an over the top view. Sadly, the food, at least what we had on the tasting menu just doesn't live up to anything close to being good. The tasting menu, offering tiny bites, literally tastes, from one of six to eight courses, was lacking in any consistency of great tastes. 

At a fine French restaurant, one would expect mind-blowing flavors that melt in your mouth and that even a small amount would satisfy the appetite as well as the eyes and mind. The over the top descriptions by the wait staff left us disappointed, as, like most things in Vegas, the food was all pomp and circumstance, with little real quality, execution or substance. And at $135/person for the tasting menu, most diners I feel would be disappointed. The flavors are overly complex, overly sweet and unimpressive. My advice would be to order the seared foie gras and have a couple of drinks, enjoy the view and quit while you're ahead. 

Note: I see this place has the Yelp Elite Crew all sewn up, or should I say bought off. I'm sure this real review that I post will not make it to the visible portion of this restaurant because it reflects a less than stellar experience at an establishment offering stellar views and prices, though no cuisine to match.",wtp71-5l5fR206Z0ZWYoKA,8,0,2,h2iKZsYKqvOG04DNewCWPQ

This is one of the best French restaurants I have been to, and since I love French food I have been to many.  Let's start with the view.  You are on the 56th floor of The Palms, with a vista to the entire Vegas skyline.  The views are spectacular.

Next lets discuss old school European service.  The kind that keeps me running back to europe, the kind that has been forgotten in the US.  Where wait staff master the art of their trade and this is their career and take great pride in it.  That is the staff you will find here.  Class and elegance throughout the entire dinner experience.

Then we have the food.. OMG the food.  This is French cuisine, but it has a slight Mediterranean twist to it.  Possibly a nod to the Maloof family, but definitely a successful twist.

Hubby ordered the escargot as a starter and the rack of lamb as his entree.  I ordered the seared foie gras as my appetizer and the veal wellington for my main.  I also ordered a Grand Marnier Soufflé at this time, because it takes 25 minutes to prepare.  We were served a delicious amuse bouche and choices of bread.  Of course beautiful european butter sat in the center of our table as well.  Everything was delicious.  Chef sent out another pre course, the most beautiful tiny panna cotta with apricot puree and blackberry.  ALL of this was so good, the panna cotta was divine.

Then our appetizers arrived, so beautiful to look at. I was shocked at how generous of a portion my foie gras was.  It was cooked flawlessly and it was paired with fruit and cream and I enjoyed every bite of it.  Hubby ordered the escargot, which are served on bone marrow in the bone and topped with garlic herb butter (emphasis on the herb), heirloom tomatoes and garlic chips.  He was in love.  Our staff, without prompting, brought out the bread tray for him.  They recognized that the escargot required something to sop up all the gorgeous sauce and marrow.  Neither of us left a drop of food, it was that good.

Then our main entree arrived.  Presentation is everything and they know how to present.  As soon as the domes were removed we both went OOOOO AAAAA, and looks were not deceiving, they tasted as wonderful as they looked.  My veal wellington was tender, so flavorful and delicious.  Unfortunately I had filled up on bread and pre starters and starters and could not finish my meal, but it wasn't for lack of trying.  This was exceptional.  Hubby didn't speak through his meal, but he kept saying mmmmmm.  He is a lamb chop snob, because in all honesty he makes some of the best I have ever had, and he was floored with his dish.  He would have never put this mix together, but he loved it.  His lamb dish comes with a small falafel, a kefta sausage and it was covered in an apricot sauce.  All of this worked magically together and really complemented the lamb (he wanted to make sure I said that, lol)  Let's just say, it was a huge hit and he's already planning our next visit to Alize.

Dessert is NOT to be missed.  No one does it like the French and Alize is very French.  My soufflé was sublime.  Light, airy and delicious.  I wish I had more room in my belly to finish the whole thing.  Hubby had creme brûlée and he didn't share.. LOL

Do not let the fact that this restaurant is not on the strip stop you from going.  It is worth the 4 minute drive, your mouth and eyes will reward you kindly.",ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA,4,3,5,G3Pnsngb8P5K4hFZ5JEbAg

4157673,2014-10-18,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Me and the boyfriend gave Alize a try because of the awesome Travelzoo deal I got, which featured a 5 course tasting menu ($135). If it weren't for that, I'm pretty certain we would have not gone there to try because of the insane prices. It was our one year anniversary so I wanted to do something fancy, and I have never tried a tasting menu before, so that was pretty exciting!

We made our reservations for 7pm, about an hour before we wanted to dine. Keep in mind that it was a Wednesday night, so it might not be as easy to get a reservation on a weekend. The self parking was a bit far from the Ivory Tower, which is where the restaurant is located. It's on the 56th floor, but when you look at it from the outside, the building doesn't seem to have that many stories (just an observation). I requested a table near the window because of other yelp reviews, and luckily, there was one available! The host graciously gave me the seat with the better view facing the strip, while my boyfriend got the seat with his back to the strip. It was quite beautiful. You could see the whole strip and the twinkling lights of the neighborhoods in Vegas too. They also laid our linen napkins on our laps, which made us feel extra fancy.

When we sat, there was a plate on the table decorated with a key design and a hefty, silver skeleton key laying on top of it. The host said it would be for the end of the meal, and opened a box with a gift for us inside. I just wanted the key. It was a quirky and mysterious concept. I loved it! 

We started off with bread service, which featured french baguette, a pretzel type bread, and gluten-free biscuits. We both had one of each. My favorite of them was the gluten-free biscuit. The french baguette was a little ordinary, and the pretzel bread seemed a little tough to chew on.

The amuse bouche that they brought out next consisted of pear, radish, and something I couldn't identify on top of that. I didn't really remember everything that he said, but there was also a cup of delicious apple-cinnamon consomme on the side that really made the dish feel comforting and homey. The pear itself was refreshing and crisp, and a sharpness about it, but the consomme really helped mellow it out.

Our first course consisted of the hamachi tartare and maine lobster ratatouille. I personally preferred my lobster to the hamachi. The ratatouille underneath it was flavorful and was really the star of the dish even though there was lobster on there too. They were both cold dishes.

For the second course, we chose the sauteed foie gras and the foie gras terrine. This was probably the first time I ever had foie gras at all, so the second course was an adventure for me. My foie gras terrine was served cold and with toasted and buttered bread. I thought it was just ok, but again, I don't have a defined palate when it comes to foie gras. However, the sauteed foie gras... DELISH. Probably the star of the entire meal. It just melted in your mouth with smokey goodness and was absolutely delectable. It was a freakin' sexy bite of food. Would do it again, fo sho.

Third course. We got the seared scallop and Irish salmon. To me, this was a tie. I loved both dishes. The presentation was spot on for both! Just good seafood. Both were perfectly cooked. Flavor-wise, the salmon was probably more flavorful than the scallop.

Fourth course consisted of the entrees! This was probably the hardest one to choose from cause we got to pick out of 6 choices instead of the usual 3, like the others. The boyfriend had the rack of lamb. I ended up choosing the veal wellington, just because how often do you have wellington? And also, I've never had veal before. I felt a little guilty though, since it is a cute baby animal. Oh well. It was so freaking good. So tender and moist.

Last, but not least, dessert. Chocolate souffle and grand marnier souffle all the way. My boyfriend preferred his grand marnier and I preferred my chocolate. The chocolate was decadent and rich, but still so fluffy and light. It was like magic in a bowl. His tasted like a custard with the essence of orange to it. We usually don't finish dessert when we get it, but this time, we did.

At the end of the very satisfying meal, they offer you coffee/after dinner drinks, and petite fours (small chocolates/sweet morsels of candy, etc). They lured us in and my boyfriend got a coffee and I got a cappuccino. I also wanted to indulge and try all the petite fours but I was so stuffed that I only got a toffee, hee hee.

We finally got to open our box too, and they had given us a tiny chocolate cake with a chocolate disc that said ""Happy Anniversary"" on top. It was adorbs. We loved the whole meal and would definitely consider doing it again. Also, for vegetarians, the tasting menu always had one choice in each course that was vegetarian so hooray for that! The presentation was spot on for everything. And the ambiance really elevated the romance level. It was a great night.",-gtZ4okpMWCBzuIsaYNumA,4,0,5,XAc__jEaescmla5FqLJTsA

4231439,2017-07-09,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Honestly speaking, I did have high expectations towards this restaurant, but even if I were to not have such a high one, I would have still gave them the same rating. I would rate their service to be 3/5, since I felt rushed during my dinner. Their food is about 2/5, and the environment definitely is not for a fine dining.

Do not get me wrong, I did not thing that their service was bad, but I have had so much better in almost every single fine dining restaurant I have been to. It was the bussers who seemed to rush us. They would be taking plates that we are not even done yet, and they were pretty tough when taking away the dish as well. The server rushed us with our wine. We would take about 2 sips and the glass would be refilled again, which did not go with the pace of our dinner. 

As far as their food, we tried their seared foie gras, which turned out to be grilled. It was dry, the sauce did not go well with it. It was a little too sweet, that killed my appetite for the rest of the dinner. Then, we also had their escargot, which was actually tasty, I loved the bone marrow that came with it, and the basil oil was yummy as well. I would say that it was a very well-balance dish. Then, we did not want anything from their entrees, so we skipped the entrees and moved on to their charcuterie plates. There is really nothing special about it. I could have got the same thing at Double Helix for probably half their price; however, I am paying for the experience not the food, I guess. We skipped their famous lava cake, since we did not find a reason to stay their any longer.

The dining environment was not that appealing to me either. It seemed like they just remodeled a penthouse and turned it into a restaurant. The lights were too bright. The view was not that great. Apparently, they only give out the strip view seatings to parties bigger than 4. There are many restaurants in vegas where I could get a nice view, Alize was not to die-for.

There are definitely many places in Vegas that gives you the option of nice view, good food and great environment. I would not want to seat at a cheap banquet metal chair, with rushing service and have a mediocre food. The experience was subpar for what I believe I should have got. I also believe, they should be including alcohol price on their 'minimum food purchase per person' as well. But for the most important, they should tell their hostess to cover more skin instead of showing off her underwear- very not professional. 

Would I come back? I hardly doubt it.",s01liMq8lG4G3f3AvJMi5w,2,0,2,1WONKS2lEbGKdLMET_DNEA

I came across Alize on Travelzoo and we thought it would be a good night out for the adults (my 2 oldest - 29 and 28 came with us - my youngest 21 and his cousins 19 and 18 did not).  

Wow - did we make the right choice!  A little off the beaten path it was nice to get dressed up and out of the noise and hustle of the strip.  We were seated in a corner table with great views of the city and the surrounding mountains and we could carry on adult conversations without screaming to be heard.  

We started off with a cocktail and chose our courses for our 7 course dinner.  What I like about Alize is that there are 3 choices for each course that you can pick from - so you decide what you're going to eat - not the Chef.  Each course was superb and there was enough food so you didn't leave feeling hungry like many other ""Tasting Menu's"" I taken part of.

Even better than the food was the service - at times we had 5 people serving us and explaining what each courses ingredients were and how it was prepared.  The servers were friendly and attentive without being overbearing.

Other than that great restaurant!,gK9x80p6d-3c_gpMO5SxJQ,1,0,4,m9pZwOFEqI9bmIm4D05yoA

- Wine selection is impeccable
- Hamachi Carpaccio was super delicious; the presentation was beautiful and the taste was superb
- Bartender recommended the Veal Wellington - and this dish is killer; OMG still salivating over this dish
- Grand Marnier Soufflé for desert - killer again - perfectly light and moist and aromatic

Service at the bar was very kind, cordial and professional; I appreciated that.  I was a solo traveler - and I love to dine at the bar - I felt quite welcome there - and I thank the bartender (i.e, I forget his name but he lived in Germany, Trieste and Japan for some time - he knows who he is) and the Italian maitre'd for their kind hospitality.

It was a new and far superior experience. I also wanted to have One really fancy dinner out. After much research and discussion with our amazing concierge at Red Rock (I'm talking to you, Melinda) we selected Alizé. Since we had a car, we cruised right on over. Although the parking lot felt a *little* sketch (maybe due to being a quiet cold winter Tuesday evening), once we got into the Palms, it was just fine. Once we gave our names and whisked up the elevator to the 2nd top floor we were transported to a tremendously beautiful ambiance. Quietly lit, decidedly French. Elegant and a little bit modern with panoramic views of Vegas. After checking us in and taking our coats, we were taken to a quiet corner table with pretty place settings.
The wine list was quite impressive, also the collection of Cognacs and Armagnacs lining the lit shelves in the entry hallway.
My husband and I each had our own server, always a nice touch. 
Each thing we tasted truly amazed and impressed us; and we consider ourselves foodies. We love to cook and live in San Francisco and are spoiled- accustomed to quality ingredients that are treated respectfully.  Here they were elevated to an art form- presentation, texture and taste. My husband had the venison, which is not my thing usually. It was Perfectly cooked and not gamey, accompanied with German or Austrian type sides that suited it perfectly (pickled cabbage, spaetzle, a dark berry sauce). I was over the moon thrilled with the Lobster Thermidor. I'd been obsessing a little for months, not having had tried one.. Who has Lobster Thermidor on the menu these days? Alizé! It exceeded my expectations.. although the lobster was ever so slightly, just barely, overcooked. By maybe 30 seconds. The Hollandaise was Fantastic. I know a good Hollandaise and can whip one up, (unless it's made last minute for 8 after a night out). We also very much enjoyed our amuse bouche, salad, Grand Mariner souffle, and especially the macarons (lemon and raspberry),
With the exception of the lobster's doneness and our servers confusing our entrees, everything flowed seamlessly. It was far and away the most romantic and delicious Continental cuisine meal I could have hoped for. 
We will absolutely go back.",_UZVsGIHSAFdQtf6vHQJVQ,4,2,5,dJhdW-xwJQL1WLm2OZ1Kew

service: the best I had!  I loved how a place so formal and grandiose could also be so friendly and inviting.    Also needless to say the high rise view was amazing.

the bread: was very good yet very basic with plain butter.  Waiter said they were out of the other bread they serve.  I expected a much more robust and exotic bread offering at a fancy french cuisine place like this.

appetizer: lobster bisque, OMG best lobster bisque or any kind of soup I ever had!  I'm not a soup person at all and neither is my wife but wow I could eat this dish every day.  the little lobster croquet, lemon puff, and the table dining theatrics of our server pouring the bisque onto the plate was perfect.  My only small complaint was why did they put the soup in a plate instead of a bowl?  To eat it you are basically scrapping the bottom of your plate which felt a bit out of place in a classy place like this.
Wife had the salad and was not a big fan of it.

the maincourse: ribeye.  My least favorite dish.  It was good dont get me wrong but I thought it lacked something to set it appart from other steak dishes I eaten.  Honestly it was only marginally better than some mass produced wedding steak plates I have had.  Also it was a tiny portion.  I'm kicking myself because I didnt realize they had chillean sea bass offered :(
dessert: creme brulee.  Impossible to get much better than this.  Perfectly caramelized top crust, perfectly rich and creamy custard.

If you'd like a cozy romantic table, ask for the one next to the window where you can sit next to each other (not across the table from each other). 

BAD: Spinach salad with duck confit and quail egg - the brioche tasted stale, the confit was very salty, the spinach was doused in dressing, the fried onions scattered over the leaves were pedestrian.

BAD: The chocolate souffle which was doused with liqueur even though none was mentioned on the menu. I couldn't eat it.

MEDIOCRE: Filet mignon ($58) that was slightly overcooked with tasteless truffles, parsnips that were not thoroughly cooked through, some rosemary gelee, a cooked prune, an overly salty eggroll filled with potato puree.

GOOD:  French onion soup.

GOOD: Sea urchin & crab fondue which arrives inside the urchin body. There is very little meat and it comes in a soup style, not fondue, but the meat is delicious. I was left wondering if I was supposed to eat the rest of the mousseline ""fondue"" in the shell, which was way to heavy to eat alone like a soup, but there was just so much more of it than the meat.

EXCELLENT: Chocolate fondant cake with marshmellow top. The ice cream is awful but that cake is great!",GX6YV2sORHR7tOma3mcYfw,2,1,3,4HZJLkO3VLhumwIVvV7R0w

The decor is lovely but simple so as not to take anything away from the breathtaking panaramic view of the strip.  The service is top notch but the staff retain their sense of humor avoiding the stuffiness that often accompanies fine dining.  I am a complete ""Sally"" and almost always have to rearrange the menu choices to suit my tastes.  Everything on the menu was paired so perfectly (and uniquely) that the only challenge was what to order.  The dishes were created so imaginatively that even items we've eaten thousands of times before (like the crabcake offered on the crab trio appetizer) tasted like something brand new.  Every item was prepared perfectly and with incredible flavor.  The dishes were plated beautifully and served with flourish. The spinach risotto topped with lobster and a beuure blanc sauce was as beautiful to look at as it was to eat.  The complimentary courses from the chef  were perfect additions.  The wine listed is excellent and the cocktails were some of the best we had in Vegas.    We found out the next day that it was recently voted one of the top 75 restaurants in the world.

4457179,2013-04-29,2,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"A lot has been written about this place, certainly one of the top places to eat in Las Vegas.  A spectacular view and top-notch service complement outstanding new French food.  The wine list comes on an iPad and while it's cool to do that, the interface and organization of the list is cumbersome and you still have to speak with a person to order wine - imagine that!  That being said, the sommelier capably steered us towards a delicious Vouvray to start the meal but couldn't stop us from ordering a Dolcetto d'Alba that had seen better days.

The tasting menu is a delicious choice.  It's a unique testing menu in that there are three choices for each course (one of which is vegetarian) - there are 7 courses and therefore 21 different tasting menus can be selected.  Furthermore, when ordering tasting menus, most restaurants have an ""all or none"" rule - either everyone orders it or no one orders it - however Alize does not require this - so we could all order what we wanted.

I had the tasting menu.  I have to agree with other Yelpers that the seared foie gras is outstanding - what a revelation to have it properly seasoned!  Other highlights included the tempura calamari and the ahi tuna.  The rabbit three-way (get your mind out of the gutter!) gets a demerit for the bone-in rack which was impossible to eat because the chine bone (spine) was not removed.  Some of the other courses were just ok, not spectacular, in particular my pear beignet dessert was nothing to speak of (sorry, I spoke of it).  My friend had the roasted pineapple and banana cake - now that was delicious!

As an aside, this being a top destination in Vegas, there are a lot of ""pretty people"" dining here.   A couple came in and we noticed them because of their attire - so casual to be practically backwoods - he with a messy pony tail and unkempt beard, and she with a drab smock-like top and lack of makeup.  This is Vegas, baby, and these guys looked like they should be on a pedestrian bridge selling water.  Anyhow, during our meal the sommelier came out with a wine cart and a dusty bottle of wine.  He worked the cork for what seemed like several minutes, taking it out in two pieces, and then decanted it lovingly over a candle in the old-school French way.  We found out that he was opening a 1981 Mouton-Rothschild - not something you see everyday.  We wondered who in the restaurant could have ordered that ... on the wine list it was about $850.  We scanned the dining room, checking out the various bedecked diners,  but to our surprise, it was the plainly dressed couple that we had ""dressed down"" earlier!  Wow, you really can't judge a book by it's cover.",jL-qSB8CAKrAdF6fKJNCxQ,4,4,4,s_IejsxHKAF9DSx2tSozDA

But a drunk and crazy, possibly homeless guy, got into the restaurant and screamed, ""Y'ALL GOT SOME RED BEANS AND RICE IN THIS MOTHA *expletive deleted*?!?!? Truly hilarious, made our night. If you've been in up here, you'd understand how strange this was. I mean, how the hell did the guy get through security, up the elevator, past the host, and all the way to a table. Priceless!

Anywhoo, our dinner was very good. It was a while back, but all I know is the view alone is worth the visit. When we dined, there was a whole bunch of heat lightening going on in the distance, simply beautiful atmosphere. 

Most of what we had is no longer on the menu. So wont go trying to guess my way through a dinner we had over 2 years ago. Their plating was masterful, unforgettable drink list (aperitifs, cocktails, wines, cordials, etc.), and beautiful decor. The food was good, but we felt slightly let down due to our high expectations and the total cost. However, I would not say the total experience wasn't worth it. We had a very fun time.

4478178,2015-09-08,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"don't think I've given many restaurants a full 5 stars yet, but this one definitely deserved it!

actually got a 6 course tasting menu deal off travelzoo, so we made reservations on a Friday evening, and were prompty seated.  Our waiter was Marcos, and asked us if we had evening plans in concern for time. That was a nice touch to start off being that we felt that our night was important to them, not table turnover!
A very nice touch too, was the fact that the hostess asked if we were celebrating anything, and I had mentioned a belated birthdate for my date.  they actually had a special little key to present to her and a gift to come at the end....A VERY NICE TOUCH....thank you Alize

in any case we opted for the wine pairings to accompany our meal...DO ADD THIS if you opt for their tasting menu, as the sommelier definitely knew his picks and each wine was the perfect match for our dishes.

Marcos recommended that we choose from the first two of each section of the tasting menu, the third being a throw in....sorry vegetarians!

They started us off with an amuse-bouche consisting of an asparagus terrine and a cucumber vichyssoise? in a sake cup.....nice refreshing palate cleanser!

we began with the Hamachi and smoked seafood trio
I thoroughly enjoyed the smoked dish, didn't think too much of the Hamachi though....my date thought the same, although she enjoyed the Hamachi more than I did

ok, WOOHOO time....next up were the foie gras terrine and the seared foie gras
the foie gras terrine was prepared nicely, although this is not how we prefer foie gras, it was very tasty and is a nice choice
SEARED FOIE GRAS.....definitely the choice in this course....WOW, not sure how better to describe other that food orgasm???? haha
I don't know why it is ever prepared other that in this manner as searing really brings out the best in foie gras and the pairing with a sweet fruit really makes the dish stand out

we then interrupted the tasting menu with an order of escargot served on bone marrow....this was something different that we wanted to try, since my date was a huge fan of both escargot and bone marrow.  she and I agreed that maybe the traditional way of escargot in herbed butter would have been better as the dish seemed a bit dry and a little salty. it was good none the less

our next course brought out a seared scallop and we were allowed to choose the dover sole as well.  the fish dishes were prepared well, with the scallop maybe being a bit on salty side.  The dover sole was a nice choice, moist and flavorful, do choose that if you are able

on to meat! we had the lamb and the veal wellington.  both were excellent choices, as the lamb was cooked a nice medium rare and was very tasty.  the veal wellington....again YUM, this was prepared nicely, extremely tender as one would expect from veal....a very nice dish

for dessert, we chose the lemon chiffon and chocolate soufflé
the first was nice and bright, as I do enjoy lemon desserts
but the chocolate soufflé....again WOW, on its own was just ok, but the pairing with a desert port/wine made this dish heaven, the right amount of sweetness to accompany the richness of the soufflé.....my hats off to our sommelier

LEST I FORGET, to top off the near perfect meal, I had ordered a crepes suzette to be made when I made reservations.  BOOYAH! I do not know why this is not on their normal menu as this was one of the best crepe desserts we have ever had.  the crepes were prepared nicely and the orange sauce was spot on.

They brought out a nice little wooden chest for my date and her birthday key!
this was a really thoughtful touch, and she was rewarded with some nice chocolates!.....dang, getting old, almost forgot the plate of petit fours to end our night...they boxed these for us since we were running late....sorry didn't get to try as the hot vegas night turned them to mush before we could enjoy them

I do recommend that you give yourself 2 1/2-3hrs to fully enjoy this restaurant
we gave ourselves 2 hours arriving at 7pm and were found pressed for time since we had tickets to Beatles Love at 930.  don't make that mistake and set aside enough time to fully enjoy the meal. and if you don't drink, start, because the perfect French meal must be accompanied by wine!

Overall, I must say I was really impressed with both the service and the food/wine here at Alize.  We will definitely return, although I am kind of afraid to since my expectations will be sky high on next visit....I am sure they will meet them though!

As close to a perfect night as I can remember, the perfect meal with the most beautiful gal in las vegas.  It was a night that I will never forget....we were going to the cirque show after and then to do the SkyJump off Stratoshpere at midnight.  I can honestly say after this wonderful meal, jumping off the tallest las vegas building did not bother me a bit!....although I would have jumped off the building for my date anyways....haha!....stupid things guys do huh?",XnI-AHs6Sf323o913vXObg,1,0,5,7tRpi1b0sYQ5IstpeQApcg
4501984,2008-04-11,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I went into Alize with high expectations and I am happy to say that it met and surpassed them all. I had made a reservation and then when we got there we realized that we weren't going to be sat by the window. SIT NEXT TO THE WINDOW! The staff were really friendly and accommodating when we told them we'd wait for a window seat. It only took about 20minutes but we were happy to wait. I went with four friends and we all ordered the 7 course tasting menu. It was all absolutely superb!!!  Quite possibly the best decision I've ever made. In addition to the food, the presentation was fabulous. Each dish was placed in front of us and all of the waiters came around so that the metal top/dish thingies could all be removed at the same time. It was honestly like Christmas each time they did that revealing the most beautiful food that has ever been placed before me. I know what you're thinking: too showy, and you'd almost be right. But hey! It's Michelin star food we're talking about. So not only was it gorgeous but all of the dishes were fantastic. 

We began with a ""ceviche"" which consisted of tender shredded crab in a sweet cooked red bell pepper accompanied with a fresh guacamole and chili sauce. All topped with a sprig of dill and a spinach leaf. The biggest surprise of this dish was how complex the single spinach leaf made and balanced all of the flavors. It was really impressive and surprising. 

For the second course we were served a salad. It was a cantaloupe, green apple, and heirloom tomatoes all stacked atop one another with some greens on top and a piece of fried phyllo wrapped brie cheese on the side. All of this was topped with vinaigrette. This was my favorite dish. It was simple and rustic and the best part about it was the freshness of the fruits and the loving preparation. 

For the third course we had foie gras, it was perfect(but hard it is to mess up foie gras-It's the materialization of smiles and rainbows?) and it came with a cranberry jelly and caramelized apples.  yum.

The fourth course was the dover sole. This was the first time I tried this fish and I loved it. The fish has a very nutty flavor and it went perfectly wit the sauted grapes. There was also truffled potatoes on the side with some veggies (not a big deal in comparison). 

Next came a little ball of passion fruit sorbet as a palate cleanser. Beautiful presentation btw.

The fifth course also superb. Tender steak atop fried phyllo wrapped cauliflower and cheese puree and a bacon wrapped short rib. The short rib was orgasmic and is tied with the salad. It really needed its own plate. 

The sixth course consisted of three different cheeses paired with a jelly. I cant remember all of the cheeses but one of them was paired with a red onion jelly that was delicious. I honestly felt the meal did not need this dish and would have preferred two desserts. Maybe a cocktail or something in addition to the desserts. 

The seventh course was absolutely beautiful. So beautiful and inviting, it was the only course I forgot to take a picture, and didn't until it was too late. The desert was presented in three parts on one plate. A chocolate souffle, a raspberry cannoli with mint, and a crispy donut like ball with pumpkin and powdered sugar. They were all wonderful but the pumpkin ball was absolutely heavenly. 

If you can afford to put down the cash, definitely go here. We had been saving up for a long time to go to a nice place. There were a few other restaurants we were looking at that were too expensive, but we decided to go to Alize because of the food quality and the atmosphere. 
It was a great decision.

One cool thing was the wine list came out on ipads so you can just choose whatever category and scroll down.  We decided on the 7 course tasting menu.  Overall it was good but did not meet my high expectations.

Tiger Poached Shrimp- I'm not a big fan of cold shrimp.  This dish was just average although the hazelnuts really added a nice crunch and excellent toasty flavor.

Diver Scallops- My favorite of the menu.  Scallops were nicely cooked although kinda thin.  Very herby broth with a great flavor.

Duo of Foie Gras- Sauteed Foie was excellent but this is something that every restaurant has and hey..... how can you mess up foie?  The other foie was a foie terrine mille feuille.  Nice foie flavor but nothing that wowed me.

Duck Breast- Actually a very nice smokey flavored duck breast.  But, I got just 3 thin slices and there was some tendon running through it that made it chewy.

Rib Eye- Perfect medium rare, nice smokiness, and an almost crispy crust that was oh so good.

Macerated Strawberries and Funnel Cake- I've had this at every fair I've ever been to so I was kinda disappointed with this.  Tasted just like every other strawberry and funnel cake I've ever had.

Chocolate Yuzu Custard- Very chocolatey, creamy texture, kinda semi-bitter.

The staff was amazingly conscious of us and our needs. Very nice, always refilling our drinks, and on top of everything we asked for. We even got a few desert treats from the Chef. 

For an app we had Calamari, and holy cow. All we kept saying was ""wow"".

My husband had the ribeye, medium rare, and he couldn't stop raving about it. Hes a huge steak guy and is so very picky about how well his meat is prepared. This was stellar.

I had Irish Seared Salmon with Crab. Wonderfully prepared, the potatoes it came with were beyond delicious. 

Our desert was a chocolate fondant with vanilla bean ice cream. BEST DESERT EVER. The chocolate was sweet without being overpowering or too rich. The ice cream had a buttery and sweet taste that (being from Wisconsin) rivals even the best ice cream Ive ever had.

This is a place that is well worth the price. We spent $150 for a martini, an app, 2 entrees, and desert. Well worth it! We are planning to make this a place to eat every time were in Vegas.

I came here while visiting Las Vegas, sadly my brother had left the day before so I was in the city by myself mainly playing poker. I love trying new food places and I wanted to do fine dining at least once before I left sin city and settled on Alize. So I ended up fine dining solo, dropping $200 by myself the food was awesome but it was an odd experience haha. Anyway on to the review

___

I opted for the 7 course menu ($125) with wine pairings ($75)

Food:
1) Heirloom Tomato Salad -- One of my favorite courses of the entire list, beautiful presentation, flavors were perfect, came with a Shallot Vinaigrette and a thin slice of watermelon which I thought was the touch that brought everything together.
2) Sauteed Diver Scallop -- Arrived on a potato crepe and a spicy shrimp bisque, scallop was cooked nicely and the bisque was a nice complement, good second course.
3) Duo of Foie Gras -- This for me was just ok, the first preparation came as a sandwhich style cold to me it was nothing special, the second preparation was hot with an apricot chutney that was pretty good but not as good as the first two courses.
4) Seared Duck with Chorizo Sausage and Baby Bok Choy -- Paired with some Merlot Cab blend from France, it was an interesting wine different from what I've tasted before, don't even know how to describe it except it was mellow and kind of earthy? This dish was pretty good I'd put it behind the scallop and even the salad but it was tasty. 
5) Roasted Veal Loin, Oyster Mushrooms, Yellow Corn, Truffle Port Jus -- Definitely my favorite dish of the night, 10 out of 10, not so much for the Veal (it was good but I'd just as easy have a different cut of steak) but everything else worked so well together the mushroom, the truffle sauce, the corn was sweet, so much going on yet simple, by far the favorite which for the main course is a home run.
6)  Manchego Cheese Apricot Compote and Pecans -- Paired with a nice Zinfandel, I was pretty full by this point cheese was good but no wow factor
7) Dessert came in two sets first the Kiwi sauce Yogurt Sorbet was pretty good and light, but the real winner was dessert #2 a cherry cheesecake with a graham cracker crust, easily the best cheesecake I've ever had in my life it was perfect.


Service:
My server Thierry was very friendly and very helpful with explaining each dish and the wine pairings that accompanied them. The runners were fast to change silverwear and remove dirty dishes, and finally the timing of the food was absolutely perfect.

Overall:
Alize was one of the best tasting menus I've had. The price was definitely cheap but I enjoyed my experience. The view is fantastic and this is probably one of the most romantic places I could imagine bringing someone, presentation for the food is great it's a must try if you love tasting menus and fine dining.",iLkQHRvFnQv2xY0ikG6E2w,4,1,5,ppiaIW5Y1_CYCWDkM5MsQA

Where do I begin? My bittersweet experience at Alize was sadly more bitter than sweet. Mainly due to the very rude, disregarding, and upsetting service that manager provided. I can say in the least that I will not be back to the palms by the service that tainted my experience at Alize.

The food was amazing, cocktails were  strong, wine recommendations were on point. At mid-meal, I definitely thought this was the perfect dining experience: Fantastic food, great drinks, and impeccable service... or so we thought. Service aside, the restaurant was incredible. If you boys want to wine and dine your lovely lady this is most def. the place to go. Though it isn't cheap, it's well worth the $^10, and will def. sweep the ladies off their heels.

Service was great up until the manager came and sucked the air out of our balloon. My party was def. taken aback by his comment/'suggestion'. We felt completely disrespected and can say I/We/any of my close friends will not be returning/dining to Alize.

It's very sad to see such a immaculate staffed restaurant led by a complete douche",VfkA4OlerlF2LRq_m3ql5Q,2,1,3,v-Ouwr64ihEu0BhaUDTgrw

The view is breath taking. They have one side facing the Strip where you can see the busy traffic and another side facing mostly residential areas, calm and nice with lights scattered all over just like the stars in the sky. 

Our server is very knowledgeable, he explains every course, ingredients, way of cooking as well as the origin and special points of the wine, Each course has a different bottle of wine paired. 

Both me and my boyfriend's favorite is Seared Ahi Tuna. It is half raw in the inside and nicely seared all around. Amazing! 

The only little complain I had is that after 11pm, ghost bar starts to play really loud music and we can hear it in the restaurant. I think it gets louder at some point that the glass windows are shaking which breaks the romantic,intimate mood of the restaurant.

We started out with this ridiculously large cold seafood platter, which included lobster, king crab legs, oysters, shrimp, and a few other things.  Now cold seafood is generally cold seafood, but the presentation and the mix of different types of shellfish made this starter simply divine.

I had been there 3 years ago with my husband when we just start dating on my birthday. Then we went to Alize to celebrate our wedding cuz we just got marriage. We went to there to celebrate our special occasion cuz our experience three years ago was great. BUT today the server who serve us was just totally break our mood on special day. He DID NOT explain abt their dessert need pre order at all n I just ask him why he didnt tell me when I order.. I was lil disappointed that I cannot have the dessert what I went there for.. but I was ok.. I thought he might forget cuz it was busy today..  BUT He was very offensive to us. He kept saying he did explain to us so that is our fault. Then he brought n show us their menu n said they already explain on the menu.. so that is our fault cuz we didnt read n pay attention on every word on the menu... OMG.. what kind service of fine dining restaurant could be like that???
We were just so mad n still dont understand how he can keep his job in the restaurant.
 HIS SERVICE WAS WORSE THAN FOOD COURT ON THE STREET.
 Although the food was alright, I think there is no next time in Alize for us.

Very intimate dark wood/brown colors with dimmed lighting. Screams romance. 

For dinner I had:
----Hamachi carpaccio- my favorite dish of the night. The presentation was very clean and unique. Fish laid carefully on plate with sauce surrounding. In the middle a fantastic little salad with puff pastry. Together it was YUM!
----Veal Wellington- this was my first experience trying veal straight up and not smothered in sauce so I didn't know what to expect. The puff pastry around the meat was good. The meat itself reminded me of a hot dog taste. Haha am I wrong to think this? 
----Gnocchi- this was very close to my favorite thing as well. Lathered in a truffle sauce. Very good and highly recommended as a side 
----Brussels sprouts- has bacon, nuff said. Good if you need veggies. 
----DESSERTS- I am a dessertaholic so we tried a few. My favorite was the carrot cake soufflé. Must order early. I always do a classic soufflé so the carrot cake flavor with cream cheese Anglaise was perfecto. I also Love lemon desserts so my favorite fruity choice with was not tart at all was the lemon chiffon. Both will not way you down at the end of the night because they are both light. 

Overall I guess I didn't go full French in the French restaurant. Service was friendly and attentive. The chef sends out a few amuse bouche during dinner with is nice.

Bei der Ankunft im Palms dachte ich noch ""was für ein prolliges Ambiente und das passende Publikum dazu"" 

Auf dem Weg zum Alizé muss man sich im Casino Level beim eigens dafür eingerichteten Aufzug anmelden. Von dort an, nimmt sich ein weiterer Mitarbeiter einem an und begleitet einen in den Aufzug.

Oben angekommen, wird man an den nächsten Mitarbeiter weitergegeben, der einem die Jacken abnimmt und daraufhin zum nächsten Mitarbeiter übergibt. Von diesem wird man dann zu seinem Tisch begleitet, an dem die Frauen exakt nach Knigge von weiteren Mitarbeitern an den Platz begleitet und an den Tisch ""herangeschoben"" werden.
Die Karte erhält man dann vom nächsten Mitarbeiter. Sage und schreibe 8 höchst professionelle Mitarbeiter haben wir bislang kennen gelernt.

Namen merken hatte sich nicht gelohnt, der Kellner mit dem Menü ist der einzige, der dann zum Glück für den ganzen restlichen Abend bei einem bleibt.

Das ganze war schon ein wenig skurril aber letztendlich hat es einen unfassbar ruhigen und reibungslosen Ablauf ermöglicht, bei dem man sich auch noch so wichtig vorkommt, wie der Prinz von Arabien.

Beim Blick in die Weinkarte staunte ich nicht schlecht. Die Frage, ob das die Telefonnummern der Winzer seien, konnte ich mir bei den Preisen nicht verkneifen.

Ich habe jetzt schon viele großartige Weinkarten gesehen, aber kaum eine hatte so viele aussergewöhnliche und seltene Weine wie diese hier. Dementsprechend gab es hier so gut wie nichts unter dem mittleren 3-stelligen Bereich. Viele 4-stellig und einige gar 5-stellig.

Vorspeise, Hauptgericht, Dessert - alles sehr sehr lecker und wirklich raffiniert, genau wie man es sich vorstellt. Dazu der Blick auf den Strip. Beim nächsten Las Vegas Trip ist wird auf jeden Fall wieder ein Besuch im Alizé geplant.",O3KvRC8pPFuUyM1iWi13Vw,1,1,5,2d-1PPlGtczk5u0ByK8unw
4793053,2017-03-21,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Slave girl and I flied in to Vegas late, thank goodness Vegas always has late night restaurants waiting for hungry travelers like us. After we checked in, we were ready to head out to Alize for a late night feast.

Since we got there late, the whole restaurant was pretty empty and it felt like we bought out the whole restaurant. That was cool. The service we received was excellent, especially after we were the only table left in the restaurant before they close.

We both ordered the chef's tasting menu and we tried to order different things so we could taste as many dishes as offered. We opted in for extra appetizer so we had 6 courses plus cheese cart, coffee, and dessert at the end. 

The food we received was generally good. We didn't think we would be full but when we got to the 5th course, we started to tap out. We loved foie gras, so sautéed foie gras was easily our favorite. However, I would also like to suggest the pan seared monkfish. It was done so well the texture was scallop alike, that was just ridiculous.

The worst dish for the night was braised short rib. It was overly salty and dry to me. I voiced my concern to our waiter and without any hesitations, he took the dish back to the kitchen and brought back a revised version which was  with the sauce on the side instead of pouring over. He told me I wasn't the only one felt it was too salty due to the sauce being simmered. Sadly, I still wasn't impressed. 

Just for reference, here is what we ordered: marky's golden osetra caviar, chilled snow crab & octopus salad, sautéed foie gras, foie gras torchon, pan seared monkfish, Maine lobster thermidor, roasted chicken breast, oven roasted quail, szechuan pepper crusted venison, braised short rib, the cheese cart, apple pie, and grand marnier souffle. 

We were celebrating anniversary so we received a little ""gift"" from the restaurant too. They gave us a key at the beginning of our meal and told us we would need it to open a box later. At the end of our meal, we got our box and inside was a brownnie dessert that said ""Happy Anniversary"". Cool. 

Overall experience was great! Excellent service, great food, we enjoyed it just fine and looking forward to a returning trip.",YApG_XpSXamn_itlOXQCBw,1,0,5,phBBcMVgMEUpm0CeFMsU_w
4794622,2016-04-17,1,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"This restaurant is very classy and pricey. I discovered this restaurant while looking for a nice restaurant option on TravelZoo. They had a Chef's 6-course tasting menu so I looked it up on Yelp and saw glowing reviews of this restaurant so decided to book it. The service was impeccable! We felt treated royally. I couldn't ask for better service! Wow, so absolutely perfect to celebrate something special. I had reservations for 6:30pm and the view is terrific at sunset! However, my palette didn't love this fancy French food. I enjoyed the experience immensely so I have no regrets trying something new. But I like much more bolder flavors and most of the items we had from the 6 course chef tasting menu were bland or very mild in flavor. There was two highlights I really enjoyed, the cocktail which was some sort of lavender infused cocktail and the scallop entree ""NDUJA CRUSTED SCALLOP"" which was beautiful and delicious, the purée tasted like it had a curry flavor.


Here are the items I sampled:

1. ANGUS BEEF CARPACCIO 
Quail Egg Yolk, Parmesan Cheese, Mustard Sauce, Pickled Vegetables, Beef Tartar
(Beautiful presentation but bland flavors)
2. SAUTÉED FOIE GRAS 
Caramelized Apples, Almond Streusel, Toasted Oat Cream, Blackberry Purée
(Not a fan of Foie Gras, was being adventurous but everything I liked here except the Foie Gras)
3. NDUJA CRUSTED SCALLOP 
Butternut Squash & Roasted Parsnip Hash, Orange-Amaretto Velouté
(Loved everything about this! The only plate I completely cleaned, except my dessert :) )
4. VEAL WELLINGTON 
Prosciutto, Mushrooms, Asparagus, Truffle Shallot Jus
(Really bland for me :( I couldn't eat more than half and it's a small portion given)
4-2. COLORADO LAMB 
Falafel, Pomegranate Glazed Kefta Sausage, Broccolini, Apricot-Mustard Jus
(Tried some of this from my company's plate and loved it! Wish I ordered this instead of the Veal Wellington)
5. GRAND MARNIER SOUFFLÉ 
Sabayon
(Ate all of this because I pretty much love all sweets)

We made a reservation through OpenTable, and was seated relatively quickly. Because I was in a suit, I found it very nice that they had a coat check area. I was there a couple of minutes early, but the hostess was very kind enough to have us seated earlier. Upon arriving at our table, we find a chest box that says 'Happy Anniversary. Open is at the end of your visit.' From then on, our attention was shifted to this mysterious box.

As we were waiting for our server to come and greet us, I happened to notice that many of the customers that were dining were all there on either special occasions or even meetings and social gatherings. This place screams out romantic.

We did the tasting menu, and we were able to get a deal through TravelZoo for a gift card off of the price. It was a five course meal, off of a pre-selected menu, and the cuisine was served to us in such a professional and classy manner.

The food was something different, as I have never tried French cuisine before, but it was definitely memorable. My girlfriend and I still laugh about it to this day. For our entree we 'enjoyed' the delicate taste of Foie Gras. If you haven't had it before, you should definitely experience it for yourself.

At the end of your visit, we finally opened the box to see that there was a little cupcake that we could take home with us. It was this nice and interesting touch that they gave to us as they gave us the key at the end to open the box, and it just leaves your mind to wander what is in the box.

The only reason why I deducted a star from the review was because there was literally no space to maneuver while you were in the restaurant. Tables were elbow close, and you could tell the servers have trained for walking in these close knit areas. Another thing that bothered me was their sommelier. When I told him we weren't drinking for the evening, he gave me a rude dismissal, and basically treated me like a non-privileged customer.

The restaurant it located at top of the Palms Casino and Hotel, which is off the strip. For your convenience there is complimentary valet parking but it is nice to give them tip for saving you the inconvenience on going to find a parking spot on their multilevel garage.

Once you enter the Palms, you enter directly to the Casino (as expected) and we had to walk to staff to lead us to the restaurant desk. The hostess confirmed the reservation and led us to the elevator that took us to the top of the building where the restaurant is, so pretty much you cannot get to that elevator unless you have reservation to have dinner there.

After the elevator finally reached the top, we were immediately welcomed by the staff and took us to our table, which was ready for the occasion. We had the 7 course tasting menu and a couple cocktails. Even when every plate is a smaller portion, at the end of the tasting you are full.

Every single plate was so beautiful that it was heartbreaking having to eat it, they were just amazing and delicate.

Our waiter was just amazing, attentive, making sure we were having a wonderful night. 

The restaurant it is quite small (not tinny) but that makes the environment more intimate and you are able to have a nice conversation without the loud music than other restaurants (specially on the strip)

Highly recommended but yes, it is definitely pricey but absolutely worth it as the views, service, food and the experience itself is outstanding.

Went for the 7 course meal for 135 per person for memorial weekend, I picked the top selections of the 7 choices per menu recommended.  3 out of the 7 was good but nothing great.  I gave 1 star just because it is a fancy restaurant above Palms casino.  Second star for appearance of food.  Service is ok, I can't say is great.  -1 star for overall value and experience.  The service they keep filling water and did say what we got served.   Personally I do not recommend this place for the price.  I went to Bacchanal buffet at Ceasars palace the next night, and all I can say  Bacchanal blows  Alize away..  Technically cannot compare buffet over a course dinner, but what a waste of $135+tax+tip.  (oh...excellent wine though)  My friend got the 3 choice selection with the lamb, i sampled his lamb and was delicious and did not have gamy taste and was cooked to almost perfection, and tender.

And dinner time seating around 630-7pm is a perfect time to enjoy the sunset and to start seeing the lights come on on Vegas blvd.

The tasting menu is a great deal. For the value and quality you are receiving plus the views from the top floor in the Palms Casino, it's really a no brainer to do the tasting menu because you get to stay there a lot longer if you were to just do the ala carte menu.

And if you choose the tasting menu, you have plenty of options to choose from so you can essentially have a little bit of everything in the food group pyramid. My favorite was the seared foie gras and the grand marnier souffle. Such indulgence.

Besides the food and ambiance, I was a bit perturbed with the constant bickering among the servers. It seemed like the main guy...the guy who looks like some mafia mob boss, who is probably the the floor manager...kept ""coaching"" the other servers right in front of my table. It was a bit annoying.

4965427,2013-11-08,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"All flash, no substance. That goes for the service as well as food.  You can say the waitstaff was trained to hear, not listen.  Our waiter failed to mention that the vegetarian dishes listed w/the tasting menu can be ordered a la carte until we asked whether they have side dishes.  When I pointed to the warm corn terrine, he instead brought the foie gras.  Big difference.  When we alerted the staff, they just said, 'well, i can take it back or you can eat it.'  Which the rest of the party did. And was charged. The corn terrine never appeared.  Did I mention that I told him specifically that I'm pregnant and couldn't have certain foods (to my sadness), such as foie gras, soft cheeses, rare meat. A full conversation.  But apparently, he isn't paid to listen.  Because   my medium filet (again, no rare meat) was presented still mooing. After it was sent back, it came back still kicking around.  AT that point, I just ate the end piece and was done with it.  Look, if that particular kitchen usually goes the rarer side, you need to tell the diner, and she/he will order appropriately.  Onto dessert; what a dissapointment.  Half the dessert menu requires that you order it 25 minutes prior.  This included the souffle.  Which was gelatinous.  The entire table had a taste and wouldn't eat the remaining.  

I eat out.  A lot. And I've been to some of the best restaurants in the world, and not all of them expensive (that falafel joint in Marais (Paris)!) but Alize should really just give up already.  The 'we're so tech-forward' iPad wine menu (lame) and the view (lovely) can't save this place.  This is one of those places where insecure men take their ignorant dates with thoughts on impressing them with an expensive French menu and view.  There are so many great French restaurants in Vegas; if you want to impress, go to Joel Robuchon, Bouchon, Guy Savoy. Don't even bother with this place.

So what makes a restaurant truly memorable? Is it simply saying, ""that place was great""? Or is it posting a few pictures on Yelp and giving it 5 stars? Well yes. But for me, I found myself actually missing Alize and their tasting menu, and wanting to go back and experience it all over again. 

After my first visit in 2010, Alize became, and still remains one of my favorite restaurants. It's the first place we thought of when we made plans for a celebration in Vegas. The service is consistently top notch. The view of The Strip is unrivaled. And of course ... the food, absolutely amazing!

We ordered the Summer tasting menu in early September '14. A Fall / Winter tasting menu in January '15 and another tasting menu in May '15. Their consistency was unmatched. Each course came out at near perfect timing. Dirty dishes do not stay on our table long as there seems to be staff members lurking in the darkness, waiting for us to put our utensils down. I won't go over each course individually as their creative menu changes with the season, and could possibly be quite different when you go. But I can state with certainty the plating, the combination of flavors, the view and service makes the entire experience memorable. 

If I had to complain about something (let's face it, there's no 'perfect' place) is a course called Etorki. I recall it to be a dry cheese course that just didn't work well with my palette and the tasting menu. 

Also, unless they did a recent remodel, but the men's restroom looks like it belongs at a truck stop. It's small, dark and dingy with an old paper towel dispenser. It's very unlike the whole Alize experience. But I didn't go there to use the restroom. I return to indulge in the whole incredible dining experience provided by the incredible chef and team at Alize.  

Highly recommended! 

Notes: 

* Top of the Palms. Depending on what time of year you go, reserve a table when the sun sets. The Strip view is incredible as the sky changes color during sunset.
* If you ask nicely for a table facing the Strip during the reservation process, they might accommodate, because they are just awesome! 
* If you're driving to the Palms, remember which garage you parked at. Apparently there are 3 exits and after a few drinks, we forgot where we parked. 
* Weeknights tend to be a bit less crowded
* Excellent place for any type of special occasion.",n8YKNoz1xJHJDe-_jxfbcQ,10,6,5,gRJ7PUv34YC5utmT22ubDw

Slight ding for the 3rd course (the scallion pancake).  Absolutely nothing special about this dish; it was basically an imitation of Chinese scallion pancake, but it was too starchy; I felt it didn't fit in with the rest of the courses (which were all outstanding).

5084389,2015-02-27,7,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Was back in Sin City for CNY and since the family loves to try new places, we decided to hit up Alize.  Located on the top of Palms Hotel, this restaurant has a spectacular view at night http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aliz%C3%A9-las-vegas-2#mGKK1forRTUmjA483VQnGw.  Be sure to request a table along the windows in order to get an unobstructed view.

Since we had eaten a late lunch, we opted to order a la carte but the set menu was definitely considered.

Started off the meal with two amuse bouches, the first being a foie gras mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aliz%C3%A9-las-vegas-2#FiQ5UsYfKcDAEiCpRPGrdw which had a brandy cherry on top.  This was simply awesome!  The second amuse bouche was a gruyere cheese puff pastry served with a cup of beef bouillon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aliz%C3%A9-las-vegas-2#tWPD3IiH4DohnOImsa3d0g.  Another tasty amuse bouche.

We opted to share 3 orders of seared foie gras http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aliz%C3%A9-las-vegas-2#b75lqRmllKSShZqbTAlaYA which was once again tasty but later found out it was too much for the 5 of us that we had a hard time eating our main dishes.  The foie was well seasoned and perfectly seared but I found the sauces and accompaniments to be too sweet for my taste buds.

We also ordered two of the escargots which were served on top of a roasted bone marrow http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aliz%C3%A9-las-vegas-2#2GO4KBKN65GEP7ZJ6TkS_Q.  I'm not an escargot person but damn was the bone marrow tasty.  

By the time the main courses arrived, I was already full so needless to say I didn't have much of an appetite to eat my veal wellington http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aliz%C3%A9-las-vegas-2#VNdUSfVTqOXvO9K99Iv2nQ.  Once again it was tasty but wasn't a fan of the green sprouts on top.  My only complaint was that it came out luke warm and the sauce had already sort of coagulated.

We also ordered three souffles for the table to share which included their vanilla souffle http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aliz%C3%A9-las-vegas-2#cAIErayMnORW3jm99F7yLQ, chocolate souffle http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aliz%C3%A9-las-vegas-2#E44XnKlZdovuIoy_WnlDQg, and the carrot cake souffle http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aliz%C3%A9-las-vegas-2#efBIlQ_yX9W-MTZ1ofE4LQ.  Needless to say we barely touched the souffles and did feel bad but we were stuffed.  Wasn't a fan of the carrot cake souffle as it just didn't taste right to me but both the chocolate and vanilla souffles were tasty.

Overall we were impressed with meal and would definitely come back.  One thing we noticed is that we were served plain bread w/ butter while others were given a choice of a variety of different rolls.  Perhaps the other tables ordered the set menu?

After visiting the restaurant several times in the past few years, I can truly say the chef has a great respect for ingredients.  The menu has changed over time but its always been based on quality.  Additionally, the menu has been fine tuned to the American palate.  Far out flavor combinations and ingredients that you can't pronounce have given way to more familiar dishes.  You can order in english.  You no longer need to point.

The mainstay of the menu has been the Dover Sole.  It is excellent.

The chef's tasting menus are outstanding but know that everyone at the table must agree to try it.  Unless you have not eaten in a week, the seven course menu is too much food.  

Souffles are wonderful!

The telephone book (if you still remember what that is) size wine list is incredible.  Every region of the world is represented.  You will need sommelier to help you no matter how much you know about wine.  Be very honest about how much you want to spend and you won't be disappointed.

Service is impeccable and is adjusted to your tables needs.  You will never be interrupted mid sentence and asked if you are ready for your next course.

While you can enjoy a great meal with wine for less than $100 a person, save and splurge here.  On a past visit, dinner for four was $3,200 but the memories of the evening will last forever.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,2,1,5,Cz_nbOpPIhs3Ydn0my26ng

After days of combing through reviews of the most romantic restaurants in Vegas we decided to go with this one. The ambiance of this restaurant was quiet, quaint, and the view was beautiful. To start both of the amuse bouches were delicious and had you craving more. I ordered the Lobster and my Husband ordered the bone in New York. The NY was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. The lobster was OK. It was very very rich and seemed to be over cooked or maybe just defrosted? It was a little rubbery. After working in fine dining for 8 years where the seafood was flown in fresh, this was just not what I was expecting. For dessert we ordered creme brulee, which was delicious. Since it was our Anniversary they also provided us with a Golden Key, which opened a box at the end of the meal. 

The service was good. We were greeted by name and promptly seated. The server who greeted us, never came back to our table which I thought was a little unusual. The Waiter assistant we had was wonderful. More personable than all of the servers, even engaged us in conversation instead of just talking to us to see if we needed a refill. Also there was a manager walking around who was very attentive, he even got us another glass of champagne when our server had not stopped by. Maybe if we would've spent more, we would've gotten better service like the couples on either side of our table did? (we still spent $300, but for this place we probably didn't spend as much as the other guests) 

All in the food was good and WA was amazing. Even though the prices were high it would've been worth it if the service was better. I will probably not being going back, I would rather chance going to a different restaurant.",vEEWEfglAuZw4JyPuJBOhw,0,0,4,QuXUTdlTe-NIXNjej5GNrQ

So I see there are some people who are saying it's overpriced. I won't lie, over the past 5-7 years, the portion sizes have indeed gone down, and in some respects, yes, the creativity. However, the QUALITY of the food has not gone down in MOST cases, though yes, I do see them making more mistakes in that regard over time. Also, the quality of staff service is becoming more inconsistent, which given the price tag I don't think you can allow. To wit:

SERVICE

Waitstaff was not on point on our visit, where we blew over $1K on multiple tasting menus, two bottles of pricy wine, and add-ons. They were a B+, which, for that kind of money, is not acceptable. 

The very first time I went to Alize, years ago, they were so impeccable with their timing of presentation, no mistakes made, no details missed, every time you moved there was someone suddenly standing there ready to attend you, or adjusting something for you, catching all the little details. For example, at this level of restaurant, you shouldn't even have to move your own glasses, for the prices they are charging you. If your glasses are in their way trying to present a plate to you, your main waiter presents and another guy comes under him to adjust what he needs to and make way. On this trip, I kept moving stuff around for my WAITER. I am not eating at Chevy's people, this is a starred meal, what is going on? 

Don't get me wrong, I come from a working class family. I am more than happy to move stuff around for people if I'm at Chevy's. But when I pay you this kind money, I expect you to meet that. 

Also wait staff switched two people's appetizers, one of whom was eating the tasting menu, another of whom had ordered a la carte. One waiter gave one friend at the table an elaborate presentation of her dessert (he presented, cut into her desert, elaborately poured on a sauce)  then left the table to go somewhere else. Two other people who got the same dessert were just handed the dessert as is, then forgotten. Someone had to flag another waiter to ask them to come back with the sauce, which we then got to pour on ourselves. We had multiple conversations with at least two wait staff serving our table who were not up to par with the rest of the staff (confused, missing things, forgetting things, rushing around stressed out) and you can see things slipping here.

Aside from that, though, the staff was nice and friendly and personable. They were definitely well meaning, they just weren't on the ball.

WINE

The sommelier saw me eyeing the wine list and early on Sat nite was eager to help out. Picked a great wine. I let him go slightly over budget. It was delicious and worth it. As mentioned by others, your beverage list is on an ipad which definitely makes it neat and fun and easy to evaluate your drink options. Sommelier was friendly and felt a bit like a dapper gentleman with a sparkle in his eye.

FOOD

The whole show so far would have been a 3. The food won me back to a 4. It wasn't perfect, but it was enough.

- Seared foie gras. Someone else says you can't mess up foie gras. Um, ignore him. I have had all kinds, all over the world, and will tell you that THIS foie? Orgasmic. It is a hint on the too sweet side, but is still amazing. If you could have ""lean"" foie gras that won't make you gag on its richness, that's what this was. The puree beneath it, paired with the Saturne? Blew my mind.

- Carpaccio : This was my all time favorite dish the very first time I came to Alize. This was what made me keep coming back, to find it again. But after that first time, they never made it the same way. The dish gets more and more mediocre. The first time it came on a giant platter with different dips and sauces and crackers. Each time I've had it, there's less to accompany and the meat tastes tender, but not as flavorful as the last time.

- Shrimp and scallop dish. My friend loved her scallops, I tried it, was great. The shrimp however, were mediocre.

- Dover sole: Signature dish. Very very good, I am very glad I had this in the tasting menu otherwise I would have felt only the foie gras were worth my time and been angry. Sweet with a hint of tartness, bright and smooth and rich.

- I had a rare something, filet mignon maybe it was tender and good, but red meet is not my thing.

- I had some pork loin on the tasting menu, I ate it, and don't remember it. It was passable.

- The amuse bouche the first trip to Alize blew my mind - this time, along with the palate cleanser , everything's forgettable.

- Souffle - great texture. Not amazing. I would have preferred to switch to another dessert but didn't bother asking. I ordered the butterscotch. Kind of meh. Unless you love that flavor I recommend you do another flavor.

-  As mentioned, wines were great. I ordered one cocktail and it was foul, barely touched it. It was citrus based.",XIR1_GVjl2M2P9uit2kxpA,4,0,4,vMBNtdyEfSd2VrgdvHcZlw

First, the restaurant itself is beautiful.  The view is amazing, the decor is wonderful.  It can be a little crowded, but never unruly.  

The staff, from the management down, is top notch.  I don't think the sommelier likes me much because I only order cheap wine (good wine is wasted on me), but everyone really goes out of their way.  I call ahead to request a certain desert, and the waiter already knows about it before I ask.  They are on top of things there.

The food is incredible.  Every time I bring someone new to Alize, I hype it up to the point they think it can't possibly be that good.  Then I get to see the look on their face when they take their first taste.  It's truly amazing.

The 3 dishes I can recommend are the rack of lamb, dover sole and the filet mignon.  Also, call ahead and ask for the coconut souffl.   It's the best desert I have ever experienced.  I promise you will not be disappointed.",JOR6G--IM6p9ltgyU25gWg,1,0,5,bj-ZvejHrs_czTHyS1DDdg

We were seated at a window table which has a breath-taking view of the Strip and a brightly lit view of the surrounding city. As I'm not entirely crazy for fancy places, I really appreciated this view more than anything. 


Alize's menu has two options: a tasting and an a la carte menu. We ordered from the a la carte one instead since I'm not much of an eater. He got the ahi tuna and I asked for the duck, with the chocolate fondant and ginger ice cream for desserts. 

If you enjoy fish, in particular ahi tuna, you will probably like this dish; although I've tasted several similar dishes at nearby places with a much lower price. My duck came with foi gras sausages and baby potatoes. The potatoes were undercooked, I mean seriously? How do you mess up potatoes? The duck was very tender, however and delicious and so were the sausages.

5279763,2016-12-23,3,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"With Mark Purdy now working alongside Joe Marsco to launch Andre's Bistro & Bar in the wake of Andre Rochat's iconic restaurant at the Monte Carlo unfortunately shuttering earlier this year, it was just past sunset on Saturday that dinner was served in Alize's gorgeous dining room at the top of The Palms, Chef Chris Bulen moving several stories up and bringing the already great food to a higher level, as well.

One of Las Vegas' most impressive views, the whole Strip spread-out with lights twinkling in the distance, it was at one of the coveted windowside four-tops that the party was sat, the floor to ceiling windows complimenting romantic lighting and white tablecloths as service from a team captained by Gabriel Fontenier assured an added degree of elegance.
  
Requesting the menu be served Carte Blanche, Chef Bulen at this point as trusted a toque as any in town, dainty amuses including a creamy Sweet Corn Panna Cotta kicked off what would eventually be unveiled as a 6-course tasting comprised of no less than twenty-one individual plates.

Serving every dish 'family style,' most courses arriving in threes, proper plates commenced by way of a roasted Beet Salad not unlike that at 35 Steaks + Martinis as a result of the Kataifi crusted Goat Cheese while thinly-shaved Bison Carpaccio melted on the tongue despite its leanness, a completely different sort of smoothness found in the Foie Gras Torchon with Figs, Pineapple and Balsamic ready to be spread on buttered Toast points.

More than a little impressed by the details and balance of round one, course two approached some of Rochat's more classical French plates with an air of refinement despite bold ingredients and portions big enough to share, the sautéed Duck Liver undoubtedly one of the city's most unique presentations atop a Fruit-filled Scone with sweetened Crème Fraiche while the Escargot and off-menu Sweetbreads riffed on traditional preparations with added elegance.

Anticipating an entrée-course at this time, but instead distinctly told that the third round was fish before meats, it was with good timing that more of Tammy Alana's housemade bread was brought forth, the gluten-free Rice Roll a perfect means to sop up the broth from Chef Bulen's Shrimp Bouillabaisse while the meaty Monkfish with Caviar and Rochat's famous Lobster Thermidor were expectedly great.

At this point starting to feel the effects of such a heavy meal, yet unable to resist either the rosy Duck Breast atop a Galette of Bacon and Endive or the ruby red Venison with soft Turnips in a pool of Black Currant Juice, it was with small hunks of eight Cheeses straight from the cart that the meal moved onward, the Mimolette aged to perfect crumbly sweetness while the Roquefort popped with bloomy Mushroom notes, particularly when paired with Fruit.

Taking an Eleven Madison Park tradition with tableside Coffee via Siphon, no accoutrements necessary but nonetheless welcomed as heavy Cream and Cookies, a small palate cleanser reminiscent of the beach transitioned palates sweet, Chef Alana flooding the table with a half-dozen choices including a whimsical Hot Chocolate Soufflé with Marshmallow Cream plus classic Crème Brûlée, Chocolate Fondant and Tiramisu plus Spiced Pear German Donuts and a caramelized Apple Pie beneath a net of golden Pastry.

*****Without a doubt one of the best Las Vegas Meals of 2016, Chris Bulen's classical skills honed at Andre's now cast in a more modern light high above Sin City, Alize remains an underappreciated gem in a city dominated by Celebrity Chefs, though with parent group Stacked Hospitality now venturing Off-Strip perhaps that situation is about to change.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,7,5,2Yjfqj0cPJlWY9Y7xP0PpA

5285938,2016-07-28,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I went to Alizé for my first time several months ago after buying a Travelzoo voucher for a six course meal. I went back again recently because my experience was so pleasant. 

For the six course meal, everything was absolutely amazing. I ordered the veal Wellington, which was perfect. The portions on the six course meal are small, but with so many courses, it was the perfect amount of food. The scallop that I had (yes, I said scallop, as in just one) was the best tasting and most perfectly cooked scallop I have ever had. When I went back a second time, I asked for a custom plate with more scallops, which they accommodated. 

Here are my only two negative comments. First, I ordered a coke on my first visit. It was $5 per soda, which isn't that bad. However, I didn't know that the refills were not included. I can usually tell that they aren't included if they bring out a can or bottle, but that didn't happen. So, when I received my bill and noticed that it had a $15 charge for my coke, I felt a little scammed. I wish someone would have told me that refills were not included. Obviously, being a nice restaurant, I didn't want to complain, but it annoyed me. So, I didn't order coke my second time. 

The next negative thing is that I ordered the filet mignon the second time and it came with a piece of brisket. I understand the need to be unique, but brisket with filet mignon? It was weird. Worst part is that the brisket tasted like burnt meat gristle. So, that was left on my plate. 

Other than those two things, I was very impressed with the food, service, and, of course, the view. I will definitely be back.",A0Z_UchZuzddAJjnay2f0g,2,1,5,whCGgLUlJX-TQ9ffimbiRA

This last time I was there it finally hit me why I don't care for it. It has that old time french restaurant feel, you know the one where you should be happy you get to dine here. The criteria I use is based on food, service and design. Service is first as you are greeted at the entrance by very nice people, but since the restaurant wasn't full i found it odd they sat us near a waiter station that was very invasive at times. The design, as I sat near the window I thought this was nice, again except for the chatter of the waiters behind me. over all the room looks good but is not designed well, it lacks warmth and doesn't really play off the view in a inclusive way. The service is nice, but again it feels old school french as if they are talking down to you and not engaging you as to creating an evening around you. The food very good, but again it felt as if the portions were a little small and I really hate that feeling, but it might just be me. I don't think I will be back this is probably my 5th time here and I can say that I have tried to keep the romance alive and love how Andre's has grown up, but I can't we have grown apart.",Tx2vXXhnepDfdIcvn6kRkg,0,0,2,IAu2CgM9RAwpCc177VqNNA

What an amazing meal, bite after bite of the most amazing flavors, presented beautifully and composed of delectable ingredients. 

My husband and I enjoyed the chef's tasting via Travelzoo and it was easily the best experience of our trip to Vegas. A quick summary  of highlights below

-Seared Foie Gras - Still dreaming and drooling thinking of this dish. If foie is wrong, I don't want to be right.
-Heirloom Tomato Salad - Proof that an talented chef can bring wonder with the simplest ingredients
-Mushroom Dish - Can't remember the exact name, but when my husband ordered it, I thought really? Your wasting an order on mushrooms? I quickly learned my lesson. The dish included mushrooms, squid ink sauce, salmon roe and finished with compressed cavier shavings and was a deep, earthy, complex bite of amazing deliciousness.
-Tea Leave Smoked Duck - Perfectly cooked duck, topped with foie gras. Need I say more?
-Duo of souffles - Chocolate and Grand Marnier, both equally delicious

Each of us had 6 plates (included desert) and had to ask for the final plate of petit fours to go. If you leave with room to spare, I'd be very surprised.
An incredible meal, with impeccable service. I'm day dreaming of going back and repeating the experience all over again.",FLgBEHMb9Y4HE6hlTRuJUA,1,0,5,hZ37Q2w0dsUWRjCUYRNhtw
5329893,2015-05-26,1,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"I made a reservation on OpenTable for an early celebration of my husband's birthday. I bought one of those deals from Travelzoo (ha! but the rest of the trip was expensive so why not save a little money where you can? :D), and wasn't sure it would be honored since it was Memorial Day Weekend. When I arrived, our server was very pleasant, and asked for the voucher straight away. 

Like other reviewers have said, if you have a voucher, you don't get window seating, but I don't think that detracts from the experience. From any seat in the restaurant, you can see all of the strip and the mountains. I think it's unfortunate that it is located inside the Palms, which is not a very nice hotel. This aspect takes a bit away from the experience IMO. They have a check-in desk in the hotel lobby, and the hostess directs you to a special roped-off elevator that takes you to the 56th floor.

All the service was excellent, and since we told our server straight-away that we wanted only cocktails, we did not have the same rude experience with their sommelier.

The food is A M A Z I N G. Everything is carefully plated, with gorgeous presentation. My husband and I had a wonderful experience there, and we would definitely go again.",FF5PuMO62WIoOM-WlfoKDw,2,0,5,ne_eKmnyqYiTyS86u_iIMA
5359288,2017-06-26,0,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"Alizé is one of my top two favorite French restaurants in Las Vegas. As far as the dining room goes it is absolutely the best hands down. It is elegant, romantic and decorated with class. People ask me all the time is it nicer than Top of The World over at Stratosphere. My answer is always the same, yes! Absolutely there is no comparison. Top Of the World has a terribly decorated dining room below average food subpar clientele but has a view and that's it. It literally starts and ends with the view. For that reason it loses terribly. People also ask me how does Alizé compare to Joël Robuchon's dining room? My answer to that question is a little different. Yes Joël's is nice and beautiful inside but still losses because it's on the ground floor of MGM with no view, they should convert one of the suites on the top few floors of the MGM then and only then would they have the complete package but they don't and Alizé does! If you are looking for a place that has an amazing ambiance absolutely delicious food then you must try Alizé. Whether you are on date night or have a special occasion like an anniversary or birthday you can't go wrong with Alizé. It's the perfect spot for any special night. Make the trip and start making some memories there you won't forget them.

We were seated by the window, which accentuated that part of our experience. The service is excellent from the moment you step off the ""private"" elevator to the time you leave. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and the sommelier did an excellent job of talking us through the offerings.

I had the roasted lobster, which no longer seems to be on the menu. That's a shame. It's much simpler than the thermidor, and delivered a strong lobster flavor with just a hint of char. I had the bone marrow appetizer, which was luxurious, topped with the same sort of garlic butter served with the escargot (also wonderful). One of my companions had the onion soup, which she adored.

Since it was my birthday, I received a special key which opened a birthday gift at the end of the meal. A truffle, not a new car, but much more delicious.

My meal at Alize was more than a year ago (sometimes these reviews lag!), and more recent reviews seem less enthusiastic. All the basic of food and service were there on my visit, and I can't imagine it's changed much. Highly recommended.",V7N4zvbBz4xz_NCTRm-yfA,3,4,5,4wlzz5fucPiEUt-b9t0VKw

Girl gets seduced.
Shamelessly.
Delicately.
Hard.

That's what happened to me.
I was completely seduced.  By the restaurant Alize.

I've been on a bit of a hotel restaurant kick lately, & it would be very remiss of me not to mention Alize in Las Vegas at The Palms.

I dined here long before my Yelping days began.

A friend of mine had highly recommended Ghost Bar.

So it went on my list, & off to The Palms Hotel I went.
But guess what? 

Ghost Bar was closed for a private party.

Sigh.

But while I discovered this misfortune, 
I also discovered Alize.

It was love at first sight...

The elegant & conservative space w the stunning views of Sin City dripping in all its brightly lit decadence is quite the juxtaposition.  The knee to ceiling views are just Drop. Dead. Gorgeous.
It's breathtaking.

Sure, LV is full of stunning restaurants.

And since I don't really gamble, LV to me is just a series of great restaurants I want to try...
& great pools to lay poolside.

The imperatives...

You MUST sit at a window table!  You MUST!

The food?

OUTSTANDING.

I had one of the best meals I've ever had here.  In my life.

If you order the tasting menu, I don't think it's possible for you not to absolutely LOVE every single thing.  God knows I did.  The dishes are perfectly executed & beautifully presented.  Just exquisite.

We started off with Foie Gras, 3 ways. The terrine and the sandwich(?) preparation was delicous but the seared foie gras was a homerun. Succulent, juicy, and mouth-watering. After that we had a tiny peach-like sherbet to cleanse our palette. That 'tiny' sherbet is exlpoding with flavor. For the main course, I had a wagyu NY steak and my wife had Pan Seared Muscovy Duck Breast. Now I know how wonderful wagyu beef is. If I were to describe it ,it's like the full flavor of a rib-eye with the butter-iness of a filet mignon. With smoke bacon and a Pinot Noir sause, it is everthing I can imagine that perfectly compliments the steak. The chamonix potato though is somewhat lost with all the full flavors around it. My wife's Duck breast was excellent too. 

For our dessert, we shared a warm chocolate fondant. For me, thay have taken cocolate to a new level! the chocolate fondant was so delicious, it even topped itself when it was paired with the lime sherbet, a perfect combination.

The wait staff have a flawless attention to detail. We felt pampered. The sommelier even has an iPad for you to use to brose their selection of wines, cool!

It feels like each casino tries to do an ""upscale European"" restaurant and then most defaults to Italian. Other than Bardot at the Aria, Alize is our favorite french restaurant in the city.

Alize does have an amazing view. Unfortunately the Palms is a bit outdated, which is a shame -
 I would imagine Alize would feel more exciting and fancy if it was in a newer building. 

Alize has all the trappings of a great french restaurant. Rich flavors, decadent meat-centric dishes, foie gras, giant cheese cart, and moderate portions that leave you wanting more but leaves you room for rest of the meal. Pages of wine from bordeaux, burgundy, Loire valley, and champagne. And even more pages of wine from outside of those 4 regions.  Impeccable service with a slightly stuffy air - but in a good way.

I went to Las Vegas with my girlfriend over Thanksgiving Weekend 2011 to get away, and wanted to plan one nice dinner for her. We were staying at the Palms (where this restaurant is located on the top floor) and decided to try the hotel's French cuisine.

Boy were were impressed. They honored my requested for a window table and put us in the very corner by the windows with two sides of Las Vegas night view right next  to us. Gorgeous!

The service was impeccable. Aside from a little spillage blunder the food runner made on our tablecloth (it's okay, we didn't judge), the entire front of house staff that interacted with us was timely, friendly, efficient, and kept us eating and drinking at a perfect pace.

The food was outstanding. I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed food that much. Every bite was like a foodgasm!

Venison Osso Buco & Bacon Croustillant, Chestnut Confit, Polenta Cake
Red Currant Purée & Poivrade Sauce

After all, it received a Michelin star so my expectations were pretty high.  In fact, this was the first Michelin star restaurant I have ever been to.  

I'll say this up front- Alize is pretty damn good but fell slightly short of my high expectations of what Michelin star restaurants would be like.  I got the 7 course tasting menu for $135 to enjoy the real experience so I will go through each menu item in some detail.

First, the dissapoint- the bread.  For a fancy french restaurant the bread was pretty mediocre with a small variety of plain tasting bread and *HARD* butter which was preposterous.  Luckily, the rest of the meal didn't follow the same path.

Course 1- Rib Eye Carpaccio 

Pretty good but not great.  It didn't seem to distinguish itself from any carpaccio I have had at other lesser known restaurants.

Course 2- Sauteed Foie Gras

Fairly tasty but slightly underwhelming.  It didn't have all of those intricate and unique flavors that chef's usually add to a dish like this.  It had plenty of potentially flavorsome components but most were overpowered by the flavor of Foie Gras.  This certainly isn't a bad thing.

Course 3- Seared Scallop

Getting to the good stuff.  This was pretty delicious.  Perfectly made scallop and a lot of flavor.  I only wish there was more than one :(

Course 4- Pork Belly

I'll admit that I've had better pork belly before but this was pretty delicious and very flavorsome.  The vegetables in particular were nice accoutrements.

Course 5- Lamb Loin

Very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Delicious side of sausage too.

Course 6- BREBISROUSSE d'ARGENTAL aka fancy cheese

I'm not gonna lie, its just fancy cheese.  This one in particular was like a very salty brie cheese.  A bite with all of the components on the plate made it quite tasty.

Course 7- Chocolate Souffle

This dessert was about what I expected.  Very light and tons of chocolate but was clearly inferior to the peanut butter cheesecake my dining companion had.

At the end of the meal they serve little candy trinkets that were pretty good and were a nice light ending to the meal.

Obviously the view is great and you can see most of the strip.  So, if you are one of those people that really care about ambiance and all that, you will enjoy this restaurant.  In the end, I thought that the 7 course tasting menu was slightly below my expectations BUT I'd definitely return to the restaurant for a regular entree of the Lamb Loin or Seared Scallop.",TZhIAnp1m3RzWevju1mp1g,6,1,4,jBDqC7laFHTk-K4dPkuCQA

5588265,2013-03-05,1,gV63aLTQ06Nff0GzJ0tcUA,"We looked over reviews for several restaurants before deciding upon Alize. 
All in all, a pretty decent meal was enjoyed, but for $400. without ordering a bottle of wine, decent shouldn't have been the opinion we were left with. I tried the filet with foie gras & shaved black truffles. This was exceptional. My girlfriend ordered the lobster thermadore; and while the presentation was impressive, the lobster was on the tough side. The main area of contention with us was the sommelier. we asked for him to make a choice by glass, as we we're going in such different directions with entrees. 
I briefly looked at price points for reds, and they topped out at just under $30.
I didn't  bother with the list for the white wine, and left that to him. 
The surprising reveal looking over the bill, was the white wine (Montrachet ) was 
$47. a glass. I payed the bill, decided against mentioning it at the moment, but ran into the sommelier in the hall on the way out. When I asked him why he didn't point out the quite high price point for the white, he replied "" maybe you're not use to dining 
in restaurants of this caliber""  What an arrogant ass!. We dine in 
restaurants of this caliber, but no one wants to get blindsided with paying nearly fifty 
bucks for a glass of wine. The manage heard about our rant from the Ghost Bar 
bar keep, and contacted me to hear the story, and offer a credit on the bill. 
Well done by him. Hopefully the sommelier will have more consideration and tact
with his patrons in the future. This should on the main page review, but the stupid 
system fails again. I take the time to write this review only for it to be placed where few can see it.  A waste of time.",CD64nx33PQ4hR0deUxDSOA,6,1,3,4UdOet-_tA9svcb_FhNUIw

Took the chef menu which should have been stellar, and was far from it.
- the caviar was unremarkable and served surrounded by an awkwardly sweet jelly err ""panacotta"" and palate killing cinnamon blini
- the smoked salmon was delicious but served in pinky nail servings - so the little there was that was good was... very little
- the lobster thermidor was drowned in tarragon - it could've been $2 shrimp in there you could not have figured out the difference
- the short ribs were decent but nothing to write home about
- the grand marnier soufflé was great

So - save yourself $175 and skip this hot mess. I can't fathom how this restaurant will keep its Michelin star, it's giving the institution a bad name",JhIi-DKcqQkkjDUBke9ejQ,3,2,2,KqrH6vSkPrBeRU32PXnVYQ

The service is attentive and what you should expect at a fine dining restauratn.  I went there with three other friends on a Friday night.  Our reservations were at 8 but we were starving at 6:30 so we asked if we could be seated earlier.  The hostess was more than willing to get us seated early and with one of the best seats in the house, near the windows facing the strip.

Since my friends and I are foodies, we decided to each order an appetizer and an entree and sample each other's dishes.  The appetizers we ordered included: Andre's Foie Gras Terrine, Calamari Steak, Pan Seared Diver Scallops and Crispy Chorizo Ravioli, Angus Beef Carpaccio.  Each appetizer was very unique and got our palets stimulated and ready for our entrees.  We ordered Roquefort Cheese Crusted Chicken Breast, Roquefort Cheese Crusted Chicken Breast, Grilled New York Strip with Snow Crab Claws and Pan Seared Muscovy Duck Breast and Cherry Stuffed Duck Leg.  To top it off, we also ordered a bottle of merlot and a grand merier and a chocolate souffle for dessert.  

Total cost per person for dinner was around $100 which I felt was a bargin considering we each had an appetizer, entree, a dessert and ordered a bottle of wine.

The place is on top of the Palms with a killer unobstructed view.  (the palms is a good ways off the strip)

The food is michellen star worth, your dishes are presented by staff.  Foe gras with Sautern is a newly learned pairing.   Try it.

Though, check the steak with melted cheese main course.  Seriously, is that really French?

Expect to drop $200/person for the full experience.  There's no other way to do it.

btw, after the tasting menu which we all left too stuffed to finish desert, I had Chicken McNuggets at 3 AM.  I remember being hungry, but maybe I'm a slob, or drinking and gambling works up an appetite, or maybe French food isn't fattening.

FRENCH FOOD...very rich and creamy! 
the fish was the best ....basically tasted like butter. I think it was some sort of a filet. foie gras was soooo good. 
(personally, spago 's 12 course with wine is only $420 sounds better).  this is a 7 course. 

I suggest getting the chef's choice. 
WARNING: when you look at the menu it says chef's choice is $125 (I forgot the real amount) and then there is a separate WINE PAIRING. $175 for sommelier pairing. That DOES NOT MEAN you are getting wine pairing and chef choice together for $175. It means THE TWO CHARGES ARE SEPARATE.

The foie gras melted in your mouth! It was good but very rich. After that I ordered the fillet mignon. It was alright. I wanted to ask for A1 so bad but I know they'd kill me.

Each person had their own server next to them and all at once they took the lid of and said ""wah Lah"" It was cool! You only see that in the movies. The service was wonderful.

This time we got the best table in the house right in front facing the strip. We got the 7-course tasting menu again for our anniversary, and again it was a great experience.  These are smaller sized plates that allow you to try many special dishes. Felt like a judge on Iron Chef. 

The crab/octopus salad and seared foie gras were the highlights, just amazing. Foie just bursts in your mouth with savory flavor and paired well with the sweet gingerbread and marinated pears. The scallops and flat iron steak were delicious, but pretty standard for high end fare. The squab (like pigeon) was a little gamey, but interestingly hearty and surprisingly unlike poultry. Chocolate and sabayon soufflé ended the diverse meal along with bold rich coffee. The other dishes were good but somewhat forgettable. We also got a few freebees like amuse bouche, pre-dessert goody, and a ""surprise"" box of chocolate (in a small wooden chest with a golden key) as an anniversary gift. We got this last year so it wasn't a surprise, but very nice touch of service. 

2 years ago we got the amazing 14-course menu at Guy Savoy for our anniversary. It was 4x more expensive, and once in a lifetime remarkable experience (at least my lifetime).

We arrived at 5:30 and checked in with the hostess on the casino level. We were then whisked up to the 56th floor. It was a very cold and clear night so the views from the 56th floor were incredible. We were given a nice table for 2 along the windows. 

There was a nice thank you card from Alize waiting on the table with a key for a surprise later in the evening. Our waiter Marcos arrived to introduce himself and take our drink orders. After perusing the menu I decided on the french onion soup and veal wellington. My other half opted for the rack of lamb. After receiving our drinks the bread and two amuse bouche's arrived, both of which were excellent. 

With only a few other couples in the restaurant the service was impeccable, something you rarely see any more. The onion soup arrived and was delicious. I liked how they served it in an actual onion. The veal wellington was next up. Served with the classic silver domes being removed simultaneously. It was good, but not great. I didn't taste any of the described smoked prosciutto flavor, only the mushrooms. The veal was a little tough as well. It was also odd that it didn't come with any side dish, none were even offered. 

By this time it was getting much busier, with a large party arriving but still empty tables remained. We did not see Marcos after the entrees were delivered. We sat for quite a while until someone came and cleared the plates. We had to flag down Marcos to ask for the check. He brought over my ""treasure chest"" surprise which was just a very small piece of chocolate in a box. Still a nice gesture.

Well, with this Alizé, it's quite the contrary of that characterization.  Alizé is Palm's fancy schmancy 5 star, four dollar sign, restaurant, located on the 56th floor of the Palm's hotel and casino.  The view from up top is amazing, and the ambiance is very 5 star-ish, quiet with staff ready to serve you, place a napkin on your lap and scrape the bread off the table.

The restaurant has a extraordinary Zagat rating, won several awards, and even has a travelzoo available which makes it a must try restaurant in Las Vegas.  We dined here twice using a travelzoo which offered a 4 course meal and club tickets (which we never took advantage of).  With the meal comes a fancy drink as well.

The food was served in small portions, and was served with presentation, plate covers, garnishes and all.  I never did document what was served the two times I've dined here, but only remember that everything was really good.  I did take some pictures to give you an idea of what you are getting.",p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ,5,4,5,XeHR2r30BKJV41_J4Gy1zA
