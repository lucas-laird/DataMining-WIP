I ordered some cronuts and donuts from Modern Donut and 7 pieces out of 12 that I ordered were not what I ordered. He sent some replacements which are cheaper than what I order. So I made a call and sent the e- mail to see what happened and how were they going to be responsible. The customer service said some of the ingredients have been changed over season. It is fall right now but the donuts he posted on the website were for summer. (there was no sign for that and he should have told me that he sent me the cheaper replacement but he didn't) He said hasn't had a chance to change the information in the website. (what the??????)  I still see that Modern Donut page posted one of the donut that I have ordered but I have not gotten it yesterday. I am sure he is lying right now. i don't get it what kind of excuse that he has? How could he run his business? How could he sell his donut if he keeps sending out the cheaper replacement of what customer has ordered? And how the hell could he say most of the customer is happy with their cheaper replacement? He has never told me he was going the send me the cheaper replacement. Why the hell should I pay for these wrong orders? However, he said he wanted to make me happy and he wanted me to send him out the e- mail again to let him know what I want. I did. And he said he would have to consult the baker again if he would be able to make it or not. And I guess not. Well, if you are not being honest when you run your business, you are completely destroying it yourself. And your business is going down. #moderndonut #moderndonutlv #bs",0JQytE64pkUVXHOX7t-X9g,1,0,1,rlemLRVFcDKJLUaeteJpCQ

One by one, we cut each donut into several pieces and everyone had little bites. Out of the 12 donuts I ordered, not one was less than magnificent. Rave reviews! 
Thanks to the wonderful company that made this party a smash!",ermSlc_ihFi4XebJhFKo5A,0,0,5,i0_z8GJF8ZR1Lq81D2Eycg

2617022,2016-11-05,0,drc_lGBhlkWgZrEIX7LGNw,These donuts were delivered to my husband's work and he couldn't stop raving about them!  He's really not a donut person but he ate 3 right away!  My husband was nice enough to bring some home for the family too!  They make the best cronuts I've ever had!  They were super fresh and had great flavors.  The s'mores donut was my favorite!! I think we've found our new donut place!,tO3v0wFwS3gL52B8Uy142w,0,1,5,lS45-8z1YJ_zhNM1cHHqAQ
3727340,2017-06-21,0,drc_lGBhlkWgZrEIX7LGNw,"My boyfriend surprised me with these donuts a couple weeks ago and it was a really fun surprise. Overall, the donuts were tasty but nothing that blew my mind. A few of them had a very weird taste and a lingering after taste that was strange. I think the concept is cool, getting something delivered to your significant other than flowers  but the company definitely needs to reevaluate some flavors, freshness, and the price point is definitely steep. Overall it was a fun surprise to get but maybe a little to expensive for the quality.",XcYOTqbY3Yr678gwWaHTJw,1,1,4,-IDjLjW5bnXEdSmryHCPNQ
4377405,2017-01-17,4,drc_lGBhlkWgZrEIX7LGNw,"My coworker received a box of these donuts as a token of appreciation from a client. I didn't think it was a box of donuts at first glance with the box being a thick, sturdy cardboard; I mistook it as a package of paper. Surely enough, the box was labeled with ""www.moderndonut.com""

My coworker opens the box, LOW AND BEHOLD: the most glorious dozen of donuts I have EVER seen was right in from of me. Every, single donut was a different flavor; yet every, single donut was its own masterpiece.

Donuts are the one food item that I get strangely Food-Network-food-critic about. There's a lot to take in with the pastry! Presentation? Overall flavor? Accents? Glaze? Filling? Fluffy? Spongey? Airy? Flakey?

The Modern Donut: the perfect package.

Besides an ace presentation, Modern Donuts certainly scores an A+ for overall taste. I had the honor of trying the Birthday Cake donut that was filled with a subtly sweet vanilla cream, vanilla glazed, and topped with cookie crumbles, sprinkles, and pastel icing. Very fresh. Very fluffy. And I normally do NOT like cream-filled donuts, but the cream in this one complimented the overall donut so well, I surprised myself to have devoured it.

^ you see what I mean about the food critic thing?

Fortunately in a sense, this business does not seem to have an open store front, meaning that all of their donuts will always be fresh and made to order for you. Their website is easily functional and you can view/order their vast variety of classic, gourmet, signature, and even cronuts! 

They deliver, so this would be an excellent gift to a boss, coworkers, or friends. According to their website, boxes range from $20-$40.",BOQ_p0wtX8Xl9k2R9FBiBg,4,1,5,dtB2eXdudBf_8mIEU_PNVg
5223901,2017-02-23,1,drc_lGBhlkWgZrEIX7LGNw,"not a very good experience with them.. im so excited to taste the donut coz of the reviews written about them so i ordered a week before valentines day for a surprise to my husband. unfortunately they called that day saying they cannot deliver it that day coz of a lot orders for that day, they said they will deliever it to me the next day, so what can i do? they ruined my valentines surprise for my husband!!! they said they will give me discounts, refund and coupons for my next order, which never came in to my email as they promise!.. so they deliver it the next day, we were so excited to try it and took some pictures to post and maybe promote the donut if its really good! but to be honest its just the presentation of the donut and maybe the box that looks good but the taste???? its a big NO.. it taste not freshly baked as what they say.. so disappointed! i should have buy at Winchells instead.",p9Fvx8x2qSKk5hD9RD451Q,2,0,1,RCHFaRZ8bJsHEN57I2_Hpg
5259735,2017-08-09,0,drc_lGBhlkWgZrEIX7LGNw,"We got a delivery today at work. Pretty good! More aesthetically pleasing than anything. Each donut has its own secure spot, as they have separators between each one so that the donuts do not touch or move. I had a bite of the  birthday cake donut. It was on the very sweet side. I had the cereal pebbles, that was delicious! 

The only thing really special about their donuts are the aesthetics. It's just like any other donut place.",2wA7LWsM7FJO25IPLDGngg,0,0,4,SpGMSJPPBjRpLUVmhg74sA
