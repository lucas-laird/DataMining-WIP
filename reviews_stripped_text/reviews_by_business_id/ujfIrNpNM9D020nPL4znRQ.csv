1549166,2016-09-20,7,ujfIrNpNM9D020nPL4znRQ,"I love Del Taco.  It is my ole reliable when I am out an about and in need of something to take the edge off.  This was the case recently while heading north up Rancho a little after 10 at night.  I spied one car in the drive-thru and thought I had scored.  That was until I pulled in and another vehicle which had come in from another entrance beat me to the squawk box.  

They took their time ordering and I get this is not DT's fault.  Listening to the order it was nothing out of the ordinary.  It just took a while for the driver and passenger to come to a conclusion.  

I quickly made my order which consisted of a quesadilla and a bean burrito.  I then pulled up behind two vehicles.  One of them was the original vehicle I had seen in the drive-thru.  I lost track of time after an approximate 10 minute wait.  I had to go to my happy place after thoughts of 4x4 out of the drive-thru crept into my mind.

When I finally arrived at the window, I felt an unreasonable amount of time had surpassed given the amount of traffic.  I wanted to just keep driving, but I was hungry.  You can't eat principals but you can always yelp.  The cashier was so so and in no way matched the pleasantries I was throwing down.  Oh well, at least the food was warm...",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,5,5,2,JRUwFTXCX7ZBmqlWbzZVfA
1869320,2017-08-22,0,ujfIrNpNM9D020nPL4znRQ,"I purchased two Del Tacos from this location with a coupon for buy one get one free. Upon receiving my food I remembered that I had received a birthday email from your establishment for a free premium shake. I advised the employee, Maria of the email and placed my phone on the counter so that she could read it. She looked confused and seemed to question the authenticity of the email. Once she was done reading I picked up the phone and read the email again myself thinking that I may have missed something. I realized that there was a button to view the actual coupon with the barcode in order to scan for the free shake. I clicked on the button and then placed my phone back on the counter for her to scan. She hesitated to even give me the shake and made accusations that the email was not legitimate from your establishment. I assured her that this was how the email was sent to me and showed her the barcode to scan. After attempting to scan the barcode for a few minutes she asked me had I used the coupon previously and that was most likely the reason why she was unable to get the coupon to scan correctly.  I assured her again that I had never used the coupon and prior to the look of confusion on her face I did not even read the portion that said ""click here for coupon"". In the end  she was unable to get the coupon to scan and had to override the transaction in order for the purchase to be completed. She asked for another individual to validate the receipt by placing their signature on the receipt and then proceeded to accuse me of attempting defraud your establishment by using a coupon for a free shake multiple times. What is really sad about the situation is that she did it in Spanish with her other coworker not realizing that I understand the language and it is spoken in my home. I was embarrassed in front of my coworkers. We patron this location numerous times during the month and there is always an issue with the individuals working during lunch time. Especially from the management. I also live less then 3 miles away and this is our Del Taco of choice. Apparently I need to rethink my choices. My family is Hispanic. This issue is in no way a race issue but a respect issue.  If there were truly a concern then it should have been addressed with me directly and in English because that's the language I was speaking at the time of the transaction. Also I think there needs to be a lesson in intelligence. Just because I am dark skinned and I look black does not mean that I do not speak, comprehend or read any other language. Prejudice comes in many forms and what I experienced today in your establishment was just that. I do not through the work racist out there because I think it is a term that is over used or abused but I will say it is a fine line because I wonder if i would have gotten the same treatment if I looked to be a traditional Hispanic woman in her opinion.",tpOqn0OsbWp0acpw7rkQcA,0,0,1,nx9kzcqp4EY9G0fhIMX__A

The coffee tastes great always. Mexican food is my favorite and Del Taco is the and their low prices are a bonus. Go try them today.,9buV4R83SPaE5THyTNkubg,1,1,5,bQN2-JVS6YtbOSYmY1hCBg

3889476,2018-05-12,0,ujfIrNpNM9D020nPL4znRQ,"I haven't been here in quite a long time. This Del Taco is conveniently located on Rancho Drive near the North Las Vegas Airport and just past the Texas Station and Fiesta casinos. 

It's always directly on my way home when returning from appointments, running errands and engaging in other activities in simply fabulous Las Vegas.

This used to be a fairly regular stop of mine specifically for the occasional taco salad fix in either the beef or chicken versions served in a large crunchy shell.

Service was usually quick and good although I did experience food that was disappointingly cold on at least one occasion. 

Such unfortunate incidents are likely a function of which employees happen to be working at the time - the competent or the incompetent.

All things considered, this is a worthwhile stop for fans of Mexican food who may be looking for something slightly different from what is available at the other major competitor in this type of cuisine, Taco Bell.

The current 2 for $4.00 and 2 for $5.00 Mix 2 Menu items are defintely worth a look.",1aJni3g7tN1ikyCxIHnmtg,0,0,4,SNkTXYCkVeUcJgnCUr4LVg

4417209,2018-03-12,0,ujfIrNpNM9D020nPL4znRQ,I wish you could give negative stars on here. We've been to this del taco before and they've been slow but never this bad. We stood there at the counter for 10 minutes and were not even acknowledged by anyone working there. The employees filled drive thru order after drive thru order as more and more people got in line and NEVER EVEN HAD AN EMPLOYEE LOOK AT US. It's going to be a very long time before we will eat at any del taco and will  NEVER go back to this location.,J9AsfMwQ4eIi3snPvv7Lsg,0,0,1,zcT3Kiwi_9NKRaHQn2BzZQ
4558310,2013-10-14,2,ujfIrNpNM9D020nPL4znRQ,"Listen, I don't know anyone who goes to Del Taco over other food choices. I mean, given the choice between other food places and DT, I'm probs gonna pick the other food places. This location is convenient for me because it is about two minutes from my house, but is this place worth the drive otherwise...?

The last two times I've gone to Del Taco, I've gotten the fish taco combo. Seriously, it's the only reason this place is getting three stars and not two. Speaking exclusively about the fish tacos -- great. I mean, really good given the price point. No complaints at all. I almost want to drive over there right now just for that. NOM. Why they think it's smart to serve french fries with fish tacos is beyond me, though. Everything else I've ever gotten there? Meh. Like you get it and you eat it because you're hungry and you're in a time crunch, but it's not like it's amazing. It's ok. 

The service here has never been bad. It's good and quick, so no complaints there. The place, also, isn't dirty or anything. So no complaints there, either. 

All in all, this place isn't bad. Some of the food will leave you wanting for more (in terms of delicious, not volume) but the fish tacos, I think, are totally good. Get them.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,1,0,3,QXGOCM7-lHs0g_gbA5b4iA

4764551,2016-01-15,2,ujfIrNpNM9D020nPL4znRQ,"Let me start by saying, I don't care what time I go to this place, day or night, I'm always greeted and asked how I'm doing. They have yet to break the routine. As I mentioned yesterday, most places I go to say, ""Go head with yo order."" I never get greeted at the other places. This place has my respect for being different.

I've never eaten a full meal from this place. If I do eat here, I'll grab a quick burrito or a few chicken tacos or even a order of Jalapeño Potato Poppers. I've had different experiences with the food. I can't say that I've consistently had good or bad food.

The Chicken Tacos are decent. I really enjoy them when I get them for a little of nothing, on Thursday. They're nothing special but they do hit the spot from time to time. I like them a lot better than the ones at Roberto's Taco Shop, but me cooking them, trumps all.

The Potato Poppers are usually pretty good. They usually serve them hot and fresh, but recently I had an issue where they gave me a order that was burnt and cold. They were horrible. I haven't ordered any since.

When they did give me the terrible Poppers, I took them back in to get my money back. I noticed that there were only 2 people working. I guess that's why the food was mediocre that day. Maybe they were overwhelmed.

I am here daily for drinks though. I love how large the large drinks are. The cups are extremely flimsy, but they are huge, nonetheless. I can also appreciate that they are only $1 too. I will never go to McDonalds for drinks if they keep them at $1. That, I am a fan of!

This place was already added to my, ""Greet me kindly, Greet me Daily"" list.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,2,2,3,6aMkOFpoD0_tw2dmfsFlag

But the service at the Drive-Thru at this location is slow, and terrible during late night.  They always ask you to wait when you pull up to order, sometimes for up to 10 minutes.
