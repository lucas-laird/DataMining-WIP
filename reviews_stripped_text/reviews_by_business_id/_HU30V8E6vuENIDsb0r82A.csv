  Hidden in a semi deserted strip mall, is a taco place worth discovering. As I made a U turn on Decatur and meadows lane I saw this taco sign by the sidewalk and my car automatically pulled in into the parking lot and there it was! tucked away in the corner of the lonely shopping mall. Tacos Los tarascos..they may be hard to find but very easy to love. The place is clean, service is great and the food is very good as well, I had the classic tacos de asada, they carry all the basic tacos you find in all the other taco establishments but if you feel venturous you can also try tacos of.....ready?.. Head, cheek, tongue, lip, and the most Interesting.....eye tacos! You might want to look into this, they are guaranteed to please your taste buds. ( so I was told )
 I was the only one at the place at the time but one other person that ordered to go, I was not really surprised since the place is kind of hard to see from the street, but I'm sure once people find out about it it should do OK.

This hidden gem is located way in the back of a strip mall across Cardenas Supermarket.(Decatur and Meadows) Our original plan was to hit up Karina's 2 for some bomb cabeza tacos.
They were closed, so we got on the Yelp App and Tacos Los Tarascos was just down the street.

Most taquerias in Vegas have the usual standbys-Asada, Al Pastor, Carnitas etc.
But TLT goes above and beyond and gives you the Real Deal Holyfield of taquerias as far as selections go...
Step inside, and go straight up to the counter. No menus here, On the side of the refrigerator, their menu offerings read plain and simple:

Tacos $1.49, Burritos $4.99
The 8 offerings to fill your Taco or Burrito are of course:

Asada
Lengua
Adobada
Pollo
Cabeza

and for the more adventureous:(I haven't seen anywhere else)

Labio (lip)
Cachete(cheek)
Ojo(eye)

we were on the fence about these last 3 offerings, especially the lip and eye, and after the guy behind the counter gave us a taste, we were surprised on how good they were, and we switched out some of our cabeza tacos, we gladly swapped it out for some cheek, lip, and eye action, and we ate them all...we even tried wax moth larvae tacos in SF at Off The Grid, and I can say that these are just as tasty, So don't knock it til you try it, and tap into your inner Andrew Zimmern and check out the more interesting offerings of this taqueria....EYE DARE YOU.....ALOHA!!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,6,6,4,ut7T06HobGYtmyW2FItWbg

I had just left Target when I saw their sign on Decatur and turned in. I was very much jonesing for some carne asada tacos, so I ordered a few of those and a burrito for my dad (I was on my way to his house). Yes, the place was empty and clean and service was ok, so no faults there. But what really got to me, and the big reason this place is two stars, is the following: when I ordered my asada, the guy pulled a tub of pre-cooked asada meat out and reheated it on the grill. That may be standard practice for fast-food places, but it's not what I expect from taco places. Not at all. I mean, making carne asada is the easiest thing ever: just grill up some flank meat, season it, cut it, put it on a tortilla. It's not like I asked you to bring me a space rock from the crab nebula, ok, so please don't re-heat my meat like you're saving all this time in a complicated process. No. The tacos themselves were ok -- ok in the way that you make yourself a grilled cheese at home and are ok with it. 

Flavor-wise, I would not return to this place. Re-heated carne asada wise, I advise you to stay away.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,3,0,2,5P0sZhf2uViXZ7kBGxNdqQ

This place HAS THE BEST TACOS in town.  Better than any meat taco in Cabo San Lucas (no fish tacos here though so Cabo still the best in fish tacos).  Salsas are AWESOME!  I go here three times a week. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!
Service is great!",qXV12m_U8rewItBwCJ8HmQ,1,0,5,DpotRB9QIWtjuf54CpDsOw
