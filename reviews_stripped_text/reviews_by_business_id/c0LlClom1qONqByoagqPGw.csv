If you are used to eating really great mariscos don't come here. It took me 20 mins to prepare my cocktail and it still tastes so bland, I ended taking it to go to go home to prepare it! The shrimp tostadas AGAIN! No flavor! Disgusting! How can they serve food so under seasoned is beyond me! My husbands carne Assad was good but come on, anyone can season and make carne asada. We are never going back. We will stick to other places! Save your money and time from not going here. So disappointing. If you open a restaurant make things how you would eat it. Not to where we basically are seasoning everything because it lacks so much flavor!",KYOZDeHciBkgCpDXVkfI8g,0,0,1,WLLj9We5xDnX0bkjxBlObw

Tienen un extenso menú de mariscos, al igual que opciones de carne. La mojarra frita y la campechana son mis favoritos.

2859422,2018-03-05,0,c0LlClom1qONqByoagqPGw,"I have driven by this place many times and thought ""I need to check that place out"".    So today was the day.  My daughter and I went for lunch.  The place was clean and very spacious.  The waitress told us to sit anywhere and so we did.  The menu had lots of seafood dishes!  I ordered 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell for an appetizer and a friend shrimp plate. My daughter ordered the ceviche.   It was all very good.  My only complaint was the food came out randomly.  The waitress delivered my entree first, then about 5 min later my daughter got her ceviche.   After I was about a 1/3 way done with my entree my oyster appetizer came out.    It was like the kitchen had no concept of staging the food order.   I will go back though as the food was very good.",gNAd-zCDlVl69PivRToqYA,0,0,3,HP7B9NnHvESqhwN0YByhGQ
2863595,2018-03-20,0,c0LlClom1qONqByoagqPGw,My father came in from out of town to spend a couple days with me and my family. We went out to eat here for the first time ever. Service was not good being that we were the only ones in the restaurant. Food was cold and took forever to receive it. These were the good things we experienced. I gpt the most horrible food poisoning i have ever had. Was throwing up for 1 week thereafter. I went back and approached them and all they did was tell me in Spanish that they did not understand English and shrugged their shoulders. Never eat here. When problems occur they run away.,juzqkBsBQROSmzPfiVJc9g,0,0,1,kbzSSy-IGY2bmqKFJ2F0hw
2923677,2017-12-11,0,c0LlClom1qONqByoagqPGw,"I'd eat here everyday if I could!  We come here once a week and always start off with a dozen oysters, which are always delicious, and a michelada (the best I've ever had)!! But what we enjoy the most is the molcajete de mariscos.   Basically it's a spicy seafood stew which consists of shrimp, crab legs and octopus with a side of tortillas.  The place is always clean and on Friday's they have a live band.  We don't usually go on Friday's because the music is too loud and can't hear each other speak.  The wait staff are always friendly and we never wait too long for our food. Highly recommend this place!!!",VtSFypGCtJbGGpg3RjMP5A,0,0,5,PQfLxyOtFjVoAO975_UEHg

I had Tacos de la Sierra which were great. Probably the best bean tacos bean tacos I have ever had next to being home made. I decided to to the plan taco with no meat because it has been a while since I done that it was not a disappointment at all. The Chile's that come with it where roasted perfectly, soft but not mushy or soggy to the point you can bite it. 

The service that I received from the establishment was out standing they were prompt. They were not over baring like some restaurants can be when they check on you to much which does not allow you to enjoy your food.

The environment was no overwhelming nor was it to dull. There are 6 or 7 different TVs in there to watch while you eat. Football, Soccer and Baseball was on the day I went. One of the greatest things was that we did not get rushed out after we were done eating and you get lollipops with your bill.",_GVfHFESIDKYO-WX3332ig,22,17,4,gV2_K--Pj_wFeceI2b_f1g
3170683,2016-03-02,12,c0LlClom1qONqByoagqPGw,"So Mexican food is my absolute favorite! I live very close to this restaurant and drove by it many times before deciding to try it. I haven't been this impressed with Mexican food in a very long time! I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted to eat since they had so many items on their menu. The waitress gave me some options which I chose the Diablo baby octopus. It was so delicious and flavorful! Their carne asada bean and cheese tacos are really good as well. 
So the thing I really like about this place is not just the food, but the restaurant is really big, good for groups and they have multiple TVs for people that like sports or telemundo (lol).... The service is unbelievably good. So friendly and attentive. Do not hesitate to come try this place out! It might be far from where you're at, but it is worth the drive!",0LzxzSM6oqOilJ_Tx8AXzg,23,20,5,yegCs9PLHb-cKTzQiQpEvA

3391003,2016-03-10,1,c0LlClom1qONqByoagqPGw,"They have a TON of shrimp plates and the plates are pretty big. Only prob is that is you don't fully fill such a big plate you feel like you aren't getting that much but still, seems ample enough. I got a steak burrito which was pretty yum. They poor refried beans over some chips on your plate which just makes me crave nachos haha YUM! The tortilla was interesting. It seemed like a mix of a regular tortilla and being cooked like a chimichanga. So it was a bit chewy but I liked it. Their red sauce on the shrimp plate was really good. The wife got the camarones el Diablo, which was pretty damn good. The chips for your chips and salsa are just ceviche chips but still good and the salsa seemed a bit thick and not the norm but still ok. I would definitely recommend trying this place at least once if not more. Next time I am back in the area I will be sure to at least stop in once. The place was pretty empty for lunch but at least the waitress still constantly made sure our food was ok and waters filled. I've been to places where if they aren't busy, they just disappear and you hardly see them especially if you want something else. So I liked how attentive she was. Will definitely be back!!! Can't wait! The burrito was on the smaller side just FYI but still good.",J-kYkJJYCgzAoI8BFvT0Cw,2,1,4,4mZkStapwYlHdaYTjnln-Q

3786753,2015-03-17,0,c0LlClom1qONqByoagqPGw,Good amount of food for the price. Loved their orchata and tostada mixta portions. My husbands burrito was good too. According to him tender meat. Personally disliked seeing alot of drunk men around kids and that loud  (tamboraso) music ....would have preferred to just have been able to listen to the 4 TVs .....but thats just a personal preference.

We also had the empanadas de camarón, and shrimp tacos.  They have live music on weekends so it can get a bit loud.
