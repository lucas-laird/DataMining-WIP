It is like a Motel 6 with pretensions to be a Radisson, but the key point was its pleasant cleanliness and newness.

This place is historic, for sure.  Marlene Deitrich performed here, along with Louis Armstrong.  This hotel was obviously the epicenter of Dean Martin whiskey swilling boozy smoke-filled room days and the classiness that somehow went along with all that.

I am being kind to the hotel to give them 4 stars.  The casino was tired, smoky (no longer cool), the music too loud, and omnipresent, and the clientelle not the best on the economic scale.  I did not enjoy listening to country music as I played roulette.  DID NOT.

The casino is a dictionary definiton of vulgarity, but even better (or worse) was outside the building where I tried to take refuge around noon:  brochures advertising hookers blowing across the ground, dirty, torn, and faded, with photos that looked like the covers of 1980's porn VHS tapes.  Some things never change, right?

Is possible to be base without being offensive?  I would have rather seen this hotel go the opposite direction, towards order:  moral, financial, architectural, all kinds.  Alas, it was not in the cards.

The hotel is definitely ok.  The casino was so awful that it was interesting.  They put a Buddha statue in the center of the casino, and that is the most interesting thing I saw in Las Vegas.

I went to Vegas with a group of friends (a last minute decision for me) and only picked the Riviera due to its cheap price (hotels.com!) and close proximity to The Venetian where we would meeting up/hanging out.

I arrived on a Friday evening, right at Midnight.. I was surprised at the amount of people in line especially since there wasn't much traffic driving in from California. Anyways, the line to check-in finally picked up once one of the employees started pulling from it and checking-in guests in the back office. I was one who got pulled out of line.

The room itself was fine, the room felt clean, even the bathroom. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. A nice King Size bed. At the end of a long work week, plus after a drive from SoCal to Vegas, it felt great. I was meeting with the group early in the morning, so I opted for sleep.. the only downfall was the loud girl in the next room.. the room I was in had a door leading to hers.. if we had been friends we could've opened up the door to go back and forth but she was a loud mouth and her voice carried over as if she was in my room.. not cool. I didn't want to be friends with her. She finally left the room and I was able to sleep.

In the morning, bathroom amenties were scarce.. soap and shampoo. No conditioner, no lotion, nothing else at all. 

The hotel didn't disappoint in it's close proximity to The Venetian.. I pulled out of the garage, took a right, down the backside of the hotel and headed South on Paradise. I took a right on Sands, a left on Koval, and a right at The Venetian.. I think total drive time was between 5 and 10min. I actually had to drive back and forth a few times and it was fairly quick. The next morning, I had to take a cab back to The Venetian and the cab ride was only $10.50 before tip.

***The COOL part is on Sunday when it was time to check out - I had tried calling the Front Desk for a late check out but got a busy signal. I tried about 4 times at least.. after 20min., I thought, forget it. Check out was at Noon.. I didn't leave my room until after 2pm. Not once did anyone knock trying to rush me out. I've NEVER had that happen before ANYWHERE!!

For the price it was cool. I would stay again if I had to although ultimately it's not my first choice. It served a purpose so I was happy.",8IImIY6OIKzGQhmkk4zb2w,3,0,3,wt519BM9qjlMVRrjYwCQsQ

On 30 June 2013 I went to turn on the floor lamp inside the room and I got a very powerful electric shock. My right hand and arm has very little feeling other than tingling now. I reported the incident immediately to the front desk. A security guard came up to my room and I filed an incident report. She assured me that Risk Management would call me. She took the lamp and told me maintenance would replace the lamp. The lamp wasn't replaced. After going to the ER I was diagnosed with Electric Shock Injury and was told feeling may never come back. I tried calling risk management every day. Finally after 2 days I went to the front desk and demanded to speak to someone regarding my injury. The manager, Debbie, came up and offered to refund my resort fees totaling $115.00 to make up for me losing the feeling in my arm by their faulty equipment in the room. They then upgraded me to the room I was supposed to have the whole time since I paid for an upgraded room. On 4 July 2013 housekeeping came to the room around 11 am. I told her I didn't need housekeeping and she said ""ok"" and walked away. We left the room around 1:00 and returned around 2:30pm. Upon returning to the room none of the 4 keys we had worked. I went down to the front desk and they gave me 4 more keys. I went back to my room and those keys didn't work. I went back down but this time to the bell desk. I explained what happened and how I already got 4 new keys. He said he'd help and he followed me to my room. His key didn't work. He said something had to be wrong with the lock or mechanism so he left and went to engineering. 30 minutes later 2 security guards (1 male in a black suit and the female security who originally took my injury report) arrived at my room. They told me I was locked out of my room because housekeeping came in to clean and saw my BB gun I had in my room. He told me firearms aren't allowed in the building. I had kept my BB gun in my safe which I kept locked. I told the security how I had told housekeeping I didn't need service earlier. I also told him how my BB gun, which isn't a firearm because it does not use combustion to fire a projectile instead uses air, was locked in my safe and asked how the maid saw my gun and also why was she coming back after I told her I didn't want her in my room. He then told me I was to leave the premises and was banned or ""86'd"". It took security an additional 30 minutes to get into my room because the door wasn't unlocking. The security guard kept trying to egg me on and asking ""Do you have a chip on your shoulder?"" ""Are you mad?"" ""Why are you mad?"" He had to be asked to leave by the other security guards because he wouldn't stop egging me on. Once inside I saw my safe had been pried open, my BB gun was sitting on top of the safe and the do not disturb sign that was on the door was sitting next to the safe. All the money I had in the safe was taken. I requested to file a report and I was told Risk Management would call me Monday. They never called. They didn't refund me for my extra night stay. I filed a police report with Las Vegas Metro Police. I will never stay at the Riviera. I will never recommend anyone, not even my worst enemy to stay at the Riviera Hotel and Casino Las Vegas!!

  Let's start with parking, good luck. We had to park a ways away because the self parking structure doesn't have enough spots and Valet was full. 
  We finally get in the hotel to check in and there are no more luxury rooms available. Wait, I booked a luxury room, what do you mean there are none available?!

Anyway, I'd give it two plus stars for being a decent, if sad, budget option, except for the bait and switch tactics the Riviera uses to lure those hotel shopping online: the base rate quoted on the travel sites excludes the $15/night resort fee AND is for a SMOKING room. ""Upgrading"" to a less gross nonsmoking option is an additional $22/night. So we're talking about a difference of $37/night between the online rate and the rate you actually have to pay.

Other than that, the rooms are decent but old, clean but shabby. The staff is neither friendly nor hostile but again, it's a cheap hotel.

184431,2013-04-13,0,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"Disclosure: I am not a casino type of person... this review is for the conference atmosphere. The hotel is one of the few retro designs from the 60s and 70s left in Old Vegas, and it is where most of the movie ""Casino"" was filmed.  All of the hotels in Vegas are set up like airport terminals, bridging and branching all over the place into various towers, which is fine once you get used to it--just wear comfortable shoes for lots of walking.

As a conference venue, it leaves a lot to be desired. First, low ceilings in the hallways and conference rooms can be pretty claustrophobic when you are in suits in hugely crowded rooms with boiling temperatures. The breakout rooms are pretty small (classroom sized, maybe 20 people to be comfortable). I gave a 15-minute presentation in a small room (50 seats) and was glad I had brought water! I thought I was going to faint towards the end, I was so hot. If you are planning a Vegas conference, you might do it in the winter time for the better temperatures--even in early March, it was nearly 90 degrees. There just isn't a lot of circulation in the rooms and halls, and with the combination of projector heat lamps, nerves, the massive amount of walking required, and people in the room, it isn't a comfortable presenting atmosphere.

Likewise, there were several other conferences going on, and based on the conference's needs, it isn't like one group gets a wing or special area--your conference area is butted up against another's. It can be confusing when you meet people in the hall who have nothing to do with your profession...make sure you check their lanyards :)

It was nice having inexpensive restaurant options in the Riviera (Banana Leaf) that was easy to get in and out of --even at noon on a conference day, there wasn't a wait.  I stayed at the LVH across the street from the Riviera. It was maybe a half mile walk, but I was carrying a laptop (bring your tablet instead). I brought both in case I had to make changes.

But the negatives outweigh the good:

Strike #1- I was a victim of credit card fraud from someone somehow getting through the hotel's phone system and posing as security, 
Strike #2- On one occasion the power went out in the entire casino,
Strike #3- On another occasion someone ""accidentally"" pulled the fire alarm early in the morning causing all the guests on the floor I was on to wander worriedly out of our rooms thinking there was a fire.
Then add, most of the people at the front desk are so unprofessional (rude and not discreet when discussing your room #, your stay time, your bill- for all to hear) and to top it- they will lie to you. I booked one room online and was told when I arrived- the room wasn't available and only an upgraded room was. I was upgraded being told one price what my bill would be completely when I checked out- and then getting a whole other total price when I checked out. I was charged an extra $1,000.

Upon arriving the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  They were quite aware of the lines forming at check-in and made every effort to take guest into the VIP check-in area to help keep things moving.   We stayed in a newer tower room.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was very clean and modern.  
  
A few months later I went back to Vegas for a Bachelorette party.  The bride really wanted to go to a male revue, so we decided on ""Men the Experience"" since my first time at the Riviera was so positive.  The show was amazing and the wait staff was very attentive to all of our needs.  The bride had the time of her life and felt so special!  On top of that, we couldn't have asked for a better looking group of men!  Especially Alejandro...he melted our hearts!   

After the show we had dinner at R Steak and Seafood.  We ordered a lot of different food and drinks.  Everything we had was delicious and we left very full and extremely satisfied.  The staff was helpful in suggesting dishes as well as dealing with us being a tad rowdy and exhilarated from just leaving the show!

I like to play but am not the most experienced, and they did not rush me and let me play at my own pace or sit out, there was no pressure.  They were also quite helpful about which bets to place, and did not seem to expect to be tipped so much as dealers at other casinos.

The ONLY good thing was that the beds were very comfortable. Check-in was terrible. Despite reservations made three months in advance, and phone confirmations made one month ahead and again two days ahead, they had the reservation wrong when we checked in and we almost didn't have a room for the four-day conference. When we got in our room (at midnight), we found trash from previous guests in cabinets. The next day, we mentioned it to the maid who was cleaning the room next door. When we returned after the room had been ""serviced,"" the trash was still there. WE had to collect it and throw it out. The room was never vacuumed our entire four-day stay. (I know because there were strings and bits of paper on the floor when we arrived and they were still there when we left.)  Used towels were NOT replaced, despite following the hotel's directions about leaving towels on the floor or on the rack to ""save water."" 

But the worst discovery was the day before we were scheduled to check out. One of our party had won $200 in the Riviera's casino two days before. He didn't want it on his person so he left the money buried in his luggage in the room. (Not a good idea, I know, but his partner had just been mugged on the street two days earlier in Chicago and he was feeling wary.) When he returned to the room, the money had been taken from his wallet, which was inside a bag, buried inside his suitcase, in a locked room. The charger for his new iPhone had also been stolen. Of course, we have no proof, but we believe the hotel maid staff is responsible. The hotel's security was completely useless (""Here, fill out a theft report."") which is really a laugh. [When we checked in, we were told not to order any delivery food (like off-casino pizza delivery) because the security guards keep close watch, and the hotel will fine guests an exorbitant amount if they catch a delivery person going to your room.] But if someone (likely a hotel employee) steals from you, security doesn't seem much interested. We told them we were checking out immediately and moving to a different hotel (the La Quinta Airport on Paradise, which we HIGHLY recommend!) and, after talking with a manager, they did refund that room for one night.

270312,2015-02-11,6,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"I found out WHERE NOT TO STAY in Vegas.

I expect a mistake or two and don't usually complain about anything minor but the Riviera Hotel seems to be the epitome of incompetence in the service industry. 

First off, we booked a Deluxe Room with two double beds, since it was just me and my grown daughter. We had to wait in a long check-in line and the desk clerk told us and wrote down the wrong room number, so our keys didn't work.  The Bellman came up with our luggage and had to call downstairs to find out what was going on. We were supposed to have a room a few doors down. He let us in but we had to go back down 19 floors to the bell desk to get the right keys. I thought to myself, well if this is the worst thing that happens that's not too bad, even though I didn't see why they didn't bring up the keys themselves since they had screwed up.

We came here on a few days where there was record breaking heat for February.  The pool was closed the entire 3 days we were there but still got charged a $17.00 a night ""Resort Fee"". People were laying out in the sun in bathing suits but no one could go in the pool.

The first 24 hours:

The Deluxe two double bed room would've been fine. It wasn't too spacious, wasn't too small.  But nothing in the room worked.

I couldn't program the safe, it kept giving me an error code. I had to call security up to fix it. I have never had any problems in other hotels I've stayed with safes. Had to wait for security to fix it.

I noticed it was hot in the room and went to turn the a/c on. I saw a wrench icon blinking. The a/c was not working, had to call maintenance and have them fix it.

The TV remote didn't work most of the time, couldn't see if it needed new batteries, it was completely sealed. It would only work if you were standing about a foot away from the TV, so you couldn't even use it from the beds that it was right in front of.  Even in front of the TV the remote wouldn't work sometimes.

The WIFI only had 4 bars and would cut you off or wouldn't connect at all.

The shower drain was clogged. had to call maintenance again to unclog it.

Called the front desk to complain, They said they would upgrade us to a Deluxe One bedroom suite with two beds for free and it would be ready by 1:30 pm.  The Riviera had told me they guarantee all their rooms to be ready by 4 pm, but we spent nearly the whole day until after 4 pm waiting for the room to be ""cleaned"". We were starving and had to leave to eat once.

2nd & 3rd days:

Suite was nice and spacious. WIFI was non-existent, even though it showed 4 to 5 bars. One bedside lamp didn't work and curtain puller was broken. View was of the side of hotel and Circus Circus.

We had a DO NOT DISTURB sign on our door yet someone still knocked the next morning. TWICE.

We were leaving around 1 or 2 pm for the day and I called and specifically asked for maid service while we were gone.  I called Housekeeping directly, told them we would be gone but would like maid service. They said someone would be right over.  I left a tip in the gratuity envelope for the maid and placed it on the bar.  When we came back later that evening, the room hadn't been touched. Beds unmade, trash not emptied, etc.  I took the gratuity back out of the envelope and left a note that said basically ""I called housekeeping and no one ever showed up so no tip for you"". 

One of the toilets kept running in the suite. I just got up and jiggled the handle, because it was loud. This happened a few times.

The night before we were going to leave, the safe we had been using with no problems for 2 days suddenly decided to throw up an error code with our valuables locked inside.  I had to wait for security to come up and bypass it again.

The valet and the bellmen were all nice. They received tips.

The lady at the fast food Mexican restaurant downstairs looked angry at the world and the food wasn't that great.  Wicked Vicky's was ok but too expensive for what you got.

On the day of checkout, I called the Bell Desk for help with our luggage and the bellman told me there was no one to check us out at the front desk. So I checked out over the TV system, and it said an e-mail would be sent to me. It didn't ask for an e-mail address so I assumed they meant the one they had sent 3 different confirmations to when I made the reservation.

When I returned home there was no e-mail. I called the hotel and they said they sent it to some e-mail that was close to mine but it was not right.  How is it they could send me 3 different e-mails before our arrival, yet screw up our e-mail address upon departure? I am wondering now if my credit card will be charged correctly as the charges are still ""pending"".

- The staff were universally unfriendly and unhelpful, causing serious complications in our time and energy.
- Our room was not cleaned in the 48 hours we stayed there.
- We were given the incorrect room (two twin beds instead of a king bed). 
- We could hear a loud buzzing all night from inadequately shielded electronics outside our room.
- The floor in our room was bowed so that the two twin beds sloped inwards, meaning that when we were laying down, whoever was towards the more-center of the bed would risk rolling off the bed if not careful.  

When we arrived, we had twenty minutes to make it to our show (Cirque Du Soliel - Mystique), which we already had tickets for.  It was either make it or loose the $200 spent on tickets.  I arrived with my ID and reservation number ready, but instead of being given our room keys, we were almost denied stay, even though I had made the reservation over three months prior, because the hotel had already redeemed the groupon we'd used.  As they'd already redeemed it, I couldn't find the groupon number for them when they demanded I give it to them again when we were checking in!  A manager had to be called to finally clear up the situation with the extremely rude and unhelpful woman at check-in, and the manager finally gave us our room keys; we made it to the show only because a taxi-cab driver was willing to speed to get us there on time!

It was told to the staff that we were visiting for our honeymoon.  OUR HONEYMOON, celebrating our recent marriage.  That guests would visit a place to celebrate such an important point in their lives should be a point of pride.  Instead, we were treated as vagabonds.  

We received the room through a groupon, but I will be contacting groupon to request a refund and report the truly terrible experience we had here.

Comfy mattress and nice television. However, I was very disappointed to discover that when I got back to the room after being out all day, $40 had been stolen from my bag! I could have used the safe for $3.50/day, but I've never had this happen at any hotel I've stayed at and since I didn't leave it laying around I had no idea that somebody would go through all my stuff to find money. What was even worse was I reported it to hotel security and they came to the room to do a report and I haven't heard anything from the hotel about it. It's only been a few days, but I know if I was a business owner I would follow up on something like this within a day. I mean, at least offer me show tickets, buffet tickets, anything.

Still not a bad price for Vegas. As we were walking to our room we had made it to our hallway and I just have to say that is stunk really bad. The hallway had a completely different smell then the casino. When we got into our room it was of decent size. The room had an odd smell but I sprayed my perfume to take away the smell. The bed was comfy so I can't really complain. A few days later I was checking my account and seen that I was charged $186.36 for the room!

Everywhere else that I have been to, the bell cart attendant would help me get my stuff out of the car. While I was checking in, the valet person told my brother that we would be able to get our car valeted, and all we needed was to give him the room number. While my brother went into the room I went to try to valet the car. The attenedant told me that  ""valet was full unless you have a handicap placard or a VIP card."" When I was telling him that he told my brother the exact opposite he didn't acknowledge me and kept looking away and just kept repeating ""go around the corner to the parking lot."" So I went around the damn corner and looked through the entire parking structure and there was absolutely no parking at all. So my brother had to come back down himself and tell the valet person what he had told him previously then he finally valeted my car. Then when I finally got to my room, the fridge (that I specifically upgraded my room for) was not working. And that was just enough.

To me, those hotels are like the pride lands where everything is popping while rivieria is like the Outlands where Scar reigned over.  This place is shit. I can't describe how filthy and out dated everything is. The $20   resort fee? That place is a poor excuse of a resort. 
I booked through booking.com and was told that I would be given a deluxe room with a flat screen tv and a non smoking room. Our tv was an old school tv. Everything was shit. Floors were dirty, sink was old, drawers were run down. When we walked through the halls, it smelled so much like smoke. My parents actually had ashtrays in their room even though we requested a non smoking room. We went down and complained. When my mom asked for a room change, they said that they would spray the room down. My parents didn't like it but they accepted it. Spraying the place down doesn't do anything. The particles from the smoke is still there and is still dangerous. When I came and requested a room change, the woman rudely said that they couldn't change my room because I signed in through the kiosk. They would spray down my room. And then she said that I couldn't change my room because I already put my stuff down on the ground in the room. They would have to call room service to clean it up. Furious, I left but after carefully thinking about it, I decided to book somewhere else. Fine, they can take my $19 that I paid for that piece of shit room that I stayed for about 5 minutes. I talked to a girl who told me she would get the manager for me. She came back, interrupted me and said that I had to call booking.com and then they would give me a refund. Before I was able to talk, she walked away. Excuse me, I wanted to talk to management, NOT her. Fed up, I went and talked to another girl and told her to check me out without charging me a resort fee. I left and went to the signature at mgm and enjoyed every fucken second of it.

I first was given a pretty nice,homely Non-smoking suite which also came with an ipod dock station...only problem it wasn't what I ordered!

Next I was given the wrong keys to what I would soon walk into,a burning up hot room,which still had the previous occupants old towels still on the edge of time. The room ended up being decent after an hour of air conditioner. I have to say,I did love the decor of the lobby and throughout the casino of legendary performers that have stayed/performed there. 

Also,the shower pressure was so high it actually left my  skin extremely dry,flaky and covered in dead skin. When I told housekeeping,she suggested i take a bath or wash off with a cloth.The ABC General store was actually super cheap(well that word doesn't exist in vegas but it was cheaper than anything else i saw.) It was pretty co having a McDonalds right across the street.The casino security was a bit anal about sitting in the Race section,though it was 1am and empty and full of plush chairs,if they caught with your eyes closed you were immediately kicked out.

Absolutely no exaggeration, i highly recommend AGAINST staying at this hotel. Thinking back, i should have just opted for better places for teh same price which were off teh strip. 
This is what happened and I leave it to you to make teh judgement....
I booked the hotel through Cheaptickets.com for a one night stay. We were at teh hotel by 7pm and were in teh queue for about 40 mintues (yes, freaking 40 mins.. there were atleast 15 folks ahead of us in teh line and only 2 at teh hotel registration and ofcourse they were old ppl who take a hell a lot of time to finish up on one person)
By this i was already disappointed with the hotel and to top it all the person at the desk says he can't find a room under my last name or credit card!!!!!!!!!! i show him the email, the hotel confirmation number but he is like ""something wrong with cheaptickets ppl, you call n talk to them and come straight to me no need to stand in line"" 
I call up cheaptickets who were very nice in helping me out but it just assured that the hotel ppl were dumb...
My friend makes an anonymous call to the hotel customer care number n give them my details and the say "" oh sorry the file was misplaced, you can now go to lobby""..
We go back again to lobby and the ppl in the line were so pissed that we cut them all.. WTF?
The lobby guy was ""oh yeah now i can see it"" idiot!!!! he should be sent to school to learn how to check in ppl more than just checking the computer in front of him..
i was very angry n demanded to meet the manager who was a complete clueless piece of crap.. she says ""oh , i understand sir.. the work goes through a lot of ppl so there are chances of error and am sorry"" thats it!!!
I said ""i had requested for a non smoking room"" and the lobby guy goes ""sir. its only a preference, its not assured. i ll be back"" and goes to teh manager and doesn't come back for another 10 mins.. i mean you either say i have or not have why do u have to have a conversation with the manager for that??????? 

Other bad things about this hotel:
1. You will have to try atleats 3 or 4 times and would be on hold for 20-30' if you try to reach the hotel lobby from your room phone..
2. The toilet in the room was pretty old with paint coming off its edges..
Good things about this hotel:
1. It has a door and two beds!!!!!!!!!!, if that is all you care.

I'm likely leaving Las Vegas soon, and decided to try it since I heard it's closing soon.(May 4) and I have some time off this week.

I used their self parking entrance from the Strip and the signage is more than a little confusing, but I did find a space finally. The parking area needs lots of ""sprucing up"" but since it's closing soon, I guess that's not gonna happen.

I was way past my lunch time so I went to the Wicked Vicky Tavern and ordered some Fish and Chips, which were actually good with very nice ""chips"". They had Malt Vinegar which for me is mandatory for your fish and chips. The bill came to $17.43 and I gave her my credit card and left $3.00 in cash as a tip, which I guess wasn't quite 20%. This morning, I notice an authorization for $21.43 on my debit card, so I will watch to make sure they don't bill me that full amount. $4.00 is $4.00:)

I was one of about 4-5 people in there, with a huge TV screen with the sound turned off on the Golf Channel. Who knew there was such a channel? Not me. It was almost amusing to watch these ""golfers"" and the talking heads, describing a game that you have to really be into, I guess.

The whole casino is pretty darn sad looking, with many slots out of service or blocked off. There appeared to be people checking in so it must have it's fans. I played my requisite $5.00 in penny slots and walked out with $8.50, so ""score"" for me.

If you are not a gambler like myself your room has no view of strip or whatsoever. Carpets are YES DIRTY! but it was ok. They have great slots for pennies. 4-5 blackjack tables, 3-4 roulette and couple poker tables or atleast thats What I saw. They have tattoo studio, a massage therapist and a steak house. Drinks in the bar was like 3$,2$ and 1$. (Yes its free in the casino but dont be a bitch and just tip the lady a dollar each time!). Hotel is like at the very end of the strip but it took us 10-15 minutes to get to the center of the strip by walking (To Flamingo). They have free parking aswell which is perfect and safe. They have dance shows aswell but as I stayed with my GF/Soon to be wife, I have no comments on that.

882492,2011-03-18,3,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"ok, BEFORE I get bannished from YELP for giving this place a 4 star rating, let me explain. 
Four stars means ""Yay! I am a fan"" and my goal for this business trip was to find a place on the strip at a very low price, that was clean, no bugs and friendly people.  When I go to McDonalds, I give the place high ratings since it is relative to what you PAY!!!  If I give McDonalds a FIVE STAR rating compared to other fast food places, then my review is accurate, if I compare it to a fancy steak house then I would give McD's a one star. So i am a fan of Riviera for this reason.

So this is the deal, I paid $50.00 a night on priceline. 
PROS:
* I was on the strip
* The room was clean
* The beds were VERY nice, great linens and many soft pillows NOT DINGY!!! It was actuall a treat.
* I played the slots in route to business and won more there than other places i tried out.
* The dinner buffet was good, (far from great) at $11.99 it was a  great price and I was able to review my notes from the day's work in comfort.
*  The people at the counter were VERY nice, professional and respectful, as well as everyone else that worked there from the bell hop, to the guy hailing a taxi me.
* The maid did a nice job everyday
* The TV and Ipod station were up to date
* There was hot water when i needed it.
* The room was very large about 400SF 
* Casino was large
* The Chinese Food Lunch buffet for $7.99 was VERY GOOD! (This was not at the normal buffet lunch, this was at the chinese restaurant on the Casino floor) 
* I checked out in the AM and was able to come back at 9PM via cab to pick up my luggage, that allowed me to finish my work for the day, then go out to dinner at the Carnigie Deli at the Mirage. ( corned beef on St Patty's day, it was great, but that's another review) get the luggage and head to the airport 
* Great place on business or pleasure on a budget, (UNLESS your spouse is a pain in theass, complaining type, then maybe spring for some more money for the grief factor)

CONS
(These are the little things that don't make the place ""AS GOOD AS IT GETS"" but did not sway me from giving 4 stars, again, because of price.
* Place is dated, (you can tell when they have a picture of Phyllis Diller as one of the stars who performed there) 
* The water pressure in the shower was lame (but I still came out clean, just needed another minute to rinse)
* The AC in the room was OK, i went there in March with temps outside up to 78 degrees. (but it did make me wonder how it would hold up in August, but if you go to the desert on August, you may want to find some nice reviews on Yelp for a mental health provider)
* The remote controll was slow in reacting to my pushing of the buttons. ( I felt really petty complaining about it since all that was on the news was the horror of the disasters unfolding in Japan, and i was complaining about the .3345 second delay to change a channel, while i was breating clean air in my underwear, in the safety of  clean hotel room in the good 'ol USA)
* The dinner buffet on my second trip was exactly the same, and it did get boring that time, so plan to go there ONCE and all is good in the hood! 
* The resort charge was (i forget the exact amount) was about $8.00 a day. But, after seeing other reviews about higher resort charges, at other LV places, perhaps this should be listed in the ""PROS"" section of this review.
* Not a great place to wine and dine your spouse, unless of course you are both cheap, then GO FOR IT and take the money you saved an blow it on gambling or food or whatever floats your boat.

883649,2012-06-25,2,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"Read several of the recent reviews and you'll get the idea. OLD & in need of up grades.. The room was tolerable, though disappointing for the $. I tried hard not to think about the price we'd paid for an old dirty barely updated room. The linens seemed fresh, which was the only positive. 

Lots of families staying here, which for me, helped the atmosphere. The casino layout was crazy & we were constantly lost, unable to find our elevator tower. We ended up spending more time at Circus Circus across the street. The wifi was incredibly s-l-o-w... nearly always gave up on internet & just turned the computer off.

Vegas has some sort of ordinance about hotel swimming pools closing early --- which was crazy to me. We're out all day doing things, in desert heat, and would have loved to come back to the hotel for a nice cool swim..... oh no no no-- the pool closes at 8pm, it's still light outside & very hot - just take a cold shower.

positives: on the north end of the strip, walking distance to other, better hotels
negatives: OLD & dirty, very small pool with blaring music during the day, the hallways to the rooms are VERY dark & poorly lit - maybe it's to hide the dirty carpets

If you're looking for a ""retro"" experience, this might be just the place for ya, it's hay-day has definitely come & gone

The RIviera is a true Vegas Classic as Vegas should be.
While it is at the end of the Strip you can still walk the strip after all it is only 4 miles and there is so much to look at along the way.
We arrived early . The only down side to this hotel is that check in is at 4 if they have a room ready you should be able to check in no matter what the time is.
The hotel was Vintage Vegas which is a breath of fresh air considering all the others except a few are way too modern.
The room we had was in the Mediterranean North Tower.It had just been remodeled which was nice . It had Comfy beds nice shower and for those who like them a flat screenTV, which I could care less about your are on Vacation you are not there to watch TV. Everything was extreamly clean that is the one thing I worry about. The size of a room and what is offered in room is of no intrest to me.
The food court was nice they had a nice choice of food. There is a McDonalds across the street and a Dennys about a block down.
The pool was very nice and clean. The Casino is also very nice because it is not crowded. There isa Duce Bus stop right in front of the hotel so you can hop right on.
This is  a Great Hotel to stay in if you want Vintage Vegas and less crowds.

1.  I prepaid for a king room and when we checked in we had 2 full beds.  I asked to be moved to a room with a king bed and they would not move us or discount the room price even though I PAID for a king. 

2. The room was old and musty.  I realize it is an older hotel, not a new gleaming one, but I was told the rooms had been renovated and were new.  The room I was in definitely had not been renovated in decades.

3. They advertise as pet friendly, but were anything but.  Pets are not allowed on the grass in the ""pet friendly area"", the are supposed to go outside on a small (filthy dirty) piece of astro turf and do their business there.  That was never explained to me when I made the reservation or at check in.    

4.  I was SCREAMED at and verbally threatened by a female security guard when my dog stepped on the grass in the ""pet friendly area"".   It was my only option as my dog would not use the astro turf (which was covered in urine from other dogs).  

5. When I called and wrote customer service about my stay and the issues I had I received no return calls or written response.

When we first arrived, we were a bit skeptical.  It certainly isn't the newest hotel on the strip.  They may not clean their front doors, and the parking-garage elevators may be dirty but, we hung in there, and ended up being quite surprised.

The rooms, despite being older, are spacious and clean.  Though they only service them every other day, the housekeeping staff was pleasant, accommodating, and did a wonderful job when they came through.

The location of the Riviera is the north end of the strip.  While we were pleased to be within walking distance of the Stratosphere, we had to rely on taxis to reach the south end (where the Venetian, MGM, Luxor and other hot spots are located).  A ride from the north to south end will run you $20 each way, with a tip.

The amenities within the Riviera include a convenience store, gift shop, deli counter, full-service restaurants, and of course a casino.  Denny's, McDonald's, IHop, and the famed Peppermill restaurant are located within easy walking distance.

Overall, we were not only pleased with the accommodations and service we received during our stay at the Riviera, its old-school charm actually grew on us.

The halls are lined with photos of Dean Martin, Elvis Presley, and other stars who graced the stage of the Riviera during its prime. Given the fact that the decor hasn't changed in the last 30+ years, you could easily imagine and appreciate the former glory of the Riviera.

Pros:

- Decent beds. Nothing too fancy, but I still slept pretty well. 

- Has a few fun souvenir and novelty shops. 

- Nice honeymoon suite with a deck and a good view. It was even large enough for a small, casual wedding reception. 

Cons:

- I came here with a wedding party. We were all supposed to be in rooms relatively near each other. Even though the reservation was made several months in advance, all of our rooms were on different floors and even in different towers. 

- The elevators were constantly malfunctioning. On the floor which I was staying, the up button called the down elevator, and vice versa. One night, there was a 100-person wait for the elevators in my tower. There are 7 elevators in that tower alone, so there shouldn't have been an issue. In addition, I found a staircase that went to the second floor, but I couldn't find one that went up to my floor. 

- 1 of the 4 lights in my room worked. The staff made no attempt to fix this during my stay.

The ""premier security conference"" he is referring too is ""defcon"" which hosted its first year at the Riviera.  There is always going to be problems and adjustments when switching venues and Riviera stepped up.  I also assumes the restrictions he had an issue with include not being able to destroy hotel property, fill the pool with chemical's to turn it purple, or reprogramming the PBXs.  But I digress.

Riviera has seen better days and is celebrating its 50th anniversary.  It looks it.  Its rooms are basic and clean.  It  provides quick check-in via a kiosks at the front desk.  It also has the basics for food including a buffet, a fast food court, and several uninspiring if not downright depressing sitdown restaurants (avoid Asian Restaurant at all costs)

Transportation to and from Riviera can be challenging.  It is on the strip but on the fair north end of it right across the street from Circus Circus.  So a cab or other transportation is a must.  To get anywhere on the strip will cost you between $10 to $20 per cab ride.  Riviera Bell Hops are not adept and managing the taxi queues and it can be frustrating waiting.  They have a notification light when they need cabs but according to the cab companies they never use it.  You can us the monorail to get to this hotel but requires walking from the back of the hotel to the Hilton station which makes for a 10 to 15 minute walk.

But if you are on a budget it provides 1cent slots, blackjack, poker, and the rest of the games you expect at a vegas with inexpensive rates.   

While the hotel serves its basic function you can't help but wonder when the explosives will arrive to replace this landmark with a new shiny theme hotel.",T-Y_g3jAhw6M46X-n76c8Q,0,0,2,i3RJPxeh4sFhihMrdR3njQ

But, since my convention was at the Riviera I figured I'd just stay there rather than have to cab back and forth from another hotel. My room was in the original tower (built in the 50's) and felt like a Motel 6 with new tile. The rooms have been renovated, but even your grandma looks old after her most recent facelift. 

Although its on the strip, it's pretty out of the way (but within walking distance of Encore or the convention center) and its surrounded by empty ghost properties that fell victim to the recession (Fountain Blue and Echelon).

How strange is this: although the building is only 6 stories, the elevator numbers are listed 31-36. So if you want to go to the ground floor, you have to press 31 (and there's no instructions, I sat in the elevator for 5 minutes until another hotel guest got in and instructed me on the Riviera elevator nuances)

Bottom line: it's a cheap hotel, but I wouldn't call it a bargain.

Pros: relatively cheap, great English pub, decent beds, flat screen tv (but it's small), mini-fridge in room for personal use, lots of history, free in-room wi-fi

Cons: Old and worn down, shower head is about 5 feet off the ground, resort fee ($11/night), $3.50 per night if you want to use the in-room safe, long wait to check in",QChOPGyCxALGAt3to-g2LQ,3,1,2,qvLQvqPn7mljTl_-vvafyg

Is it a luxury stay as if you are in the big name casinos on the strip? No, but for the price it is not a bad place. The last trip to Vegas we got a Groupon deal which was nice. However; after watching numerous episodes of #HotelImpossible it has made my attention to detail a little better. Overall the room was clean but the cabinets and picture frames look as if they were not dusted in a few weeks or better. The bathroom was clean by a child's standard but it could have been done a bit better. Outside of that it was clean enough for me. The only other thing i would say is that when i asked for a few extra towels for the room i was challenged and given a hard time before receiving the towels. The casino was clean, but a dated and the drink staff were great. Would i go back? Definitely, it is in  a decent location within walking distance of other casinos and the convention center and the pricing is good.",v8h02hAjTT9XLq8DhugDeA,1,0,2,2JHqkWF5ovTrSoizwh07sQ

Our hotel room was clean and basic, the bed was comfy. For the price the room was good. 

The problem is that it is run poorly. At check in time, there was a huge lineup that didn't move. It took us 40 minutes to check in. They had about 3 staff checking everyone in. Also, they made us pay a $100 damage deposit which will be returned to the credit card 3-5 business days after check out. Upon check out, we were informed that there was a $30 service charge for staying there and that we should have read the fine print when we checked in.

The fact that the decor of the place is filled with references to past glories like ""hey, remember when Don Rickles headlined here back in '68"", you kinda get the feeling the Riviera isn't looking towards the future.

It gets three stars, because it's not a horrible place to say. It's clean enough, no bugs, or anything like that, and premises seem well maintained, it's just decidedly unremarkable in a town, on a street that's loaded with remarkable.

The biggest strike against it, is its location. The Riviera is way up on the north end of the Strip, so to get to the heart of the action you can either take an overpriced cab or make the 30+ minute walk. Also, because of its less than ideal location, the casino isn't exactly a destination and feels a little lifeless. It doesn't help that the atmosphere is pretty gloomy with outdated decor really sealing the forgotten corner of the Strip look of it all.

My co-worker and I stayed here for a conference that just happened to be on the same weekend as a coaching awards ceremony that had dozens of high school soccer players swarming the place. My room was adjoining the room of a bunch of what had to be the most popular kids on the team since they decided to turn the room into the underage version of Caesar's. Let me tell you, you can hear everything going on in the room next door.

The room itself was all right. The bed was comfortable but the sheets were rough and stiff. The bathroom was in decent shape, but the hot water was inconsistent.

From top to bottom, the Riviera is kinda meh. Like I said, not a complete rat trap, but not a place I'd stay if it wasn't being paid for by a professional conference. The Riviera may have been a happening place in the '60s, but in 2012, it's decidedly lacking.",ai5xAV3B9OO7roqG6GiZzA,4,1,3,Q781CSA4QpEozNxGzmfMsQ

1098073,2012-06-05,4,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"The Riviera suffers from a serious case of Old. It isn't just that the structure is old, it's that its spirit seems to be merely lingering, waiting to die, as do much of its staff. That's not to say that it's bad. It's just old. It's various lobby and casino displays are themed around really cool events that happened there fifty years ago (when brass and mirrors were ""in""), and nothing about what's going on there now. Because there's nothing cool going on there now. ""Riviera! Look how hip we used to be!"" is a great slogan to sum it up.

My experience at the Riviera started out with extreme annoyance at how long it took to check in. There were maybe twenty people in line, yet it took about 90 minutes to get to the counter. And then I discovered that they had lost my reservation. After waiting another thirty minutes while the clerk was investigating the situation in a back room, she returned to say that they were able to work something out, and offered two free tickets to some crappy comedy show in their theater. Needless to say, I'd never heard of the comic, and just tossed the tickets.

If you're going to Vegas for other reasons, and don't plan on being in your room or the casino much, then you could do worse than the Riviera. If nothing else, it's cheap. We were in town for the NAB Show and just wanted cheap lodging, for which Riv came through.

The Queen Victoria pub is pretty good, and they have a lot of great beers and ales on tap. We had crappy service the first time we ate there, but the servers on the other two occasions made up for it. The fish and chips are excellent.

I also got a kick out of the pool area, because when you step into it from the hotel, you could have just stepped right back into 1960. It kinda made me feel like Frank. I would say that the period decor is spot-on, but it isn't decor; it's original period. If you're shooting a movie and you need a Rat Pack-era pool setting, get your ass to the Riv.

Will I stay there again? Probably not, since I've decided that my life goals need to be moving forward instead of stagnating. Next year I'm aiming for Treasure Island. Not Bellagio, yet. I shouldn't get ahead of myself. But, if someone were to tell me, it's the Riviera or nothing, then sure, I wouldn't mind staying there again.

The lobby was like entering a set of a 1970s tv show. Mirror chandeliers and out dated carpet. The check in line was very long and they only had 4 people checking guests in. I requested top floor and only got 17! I received 5749. I said there was no way that the room was on the 57th floor because the building didn't even look like it past 20 floors. We walked to the elevators which are beyond outdated. Scratched and scrapped up gold walls and Mirrors, doors and floors. I looked at the wall of buttons to push my floor and it had numbers 47-61? With arrows and other room numbers. I pushed 57 which is where my room was.  Got off and the sign in the hall said 17th floor but all the other signage says 57 but clearly we were not 57 stories high above the Vegas nightlife. It is extremely confusing and makes no friggin sense. That's all I ever heard the other guests complain about. The room we got was a ""luxury"" in the ""renovated"" Monoco tower. ""Renovated is an understatement! I think the last time it was update was in the 90's. The carpet on the halls was stained. The room doors are an old wood type very dark and ugly. The room was worse. It smells like mold as door are you open the door. The room was certainly not ""luxury"" nor updated. The bathroom was terrible. Ugly old 1970's yellow bathroom tile and shower and old outdated bathroom fixtures. The shower head was the worst I ever had in a hotel. Everything in the room was dirty. The rugs the ceiling in the bathroom stains on the carpet. The desk and the pictures looked like it hadn't been dusted in years! The windows were absolutely disgusting and dirty. The view was pretty good except the view of the ugly buildings and dumpsters but overall it was a nice view. The bed was pretty comfortable I was surprised. The fridge didn't work and we had to tell them 3 times to replace it and they never did! We came one night and there was absolutely no parking! All the garages were filled and even valet was full! The one night we did valet the car it took almost 30 mins to get the car. And they were very short handed.  I didn't have any change to tip on me except a large bill so I went in the hotel to front desk and asked for change and the older lady told me no and I had to walk to the casino which was on the other side of the hotel to the cage to break it. Really? You can't give me some change? I'll never come back to this place. The casino was horrible. They advertise $1 blackjack and only have it On 1 table! Really? And they only had 3-4 other BJ tables but the min was $25. Really? The slots sucked and so did the players club which gave me a. $3.00 crappy shirt for joining and spending all my money in their hotel. The restaurants suck and are fast food places. Please update it.

Obviously the Wynn is the most luxurious and newest and loved my stay there. Other than that, the Riviera has been my favorite. The staff member that checked us in was great, funny, and quick. We didn't wait in line long. 

Once we got to the room it was the perfect size. There was even a maid/cleaning staff person that greeted us and told us to contact her if we need anything. No staff member has ever done that at the other hotels. The bathroom was a little small but it was just right for two people. The only negative was that a hair was laying across the shower floor which was a bit gross. 

The casino itself is a little outdated but what do you except from a casino that was built in the mid 1950's? There were few food options. I will say that the worker that was selling pastries and coffee at their small kiosk near the back elevators was bit rude. I was standing waiting there to get a slice of cheesecake and she ignored me while she talked to another staff member. I left and went across the street to McDonalds where I got better service.

We weren't exactly ""on a budget"" but last time we came to Vegas we were NEVER in our hotel room so we honestly felt it was pointless to pay so much for really just a bed and a shower. I started reading reviews.. a bit obsessively.. because I was thinking, ""omg... I have made such a huge mistake... we should have opted for a place with at least AVERAGE reviews..."" because lets be honest, these reviews are horrriibblleeee! Well whatever, I didn't cancel because I kept telling myself ""we will never be in there. we will never be in there."" We checked in at 6pm with Sherry, who was sooo sweet and extremely professional! So there's one thing that was already looking up-- then we got our room keys and the nerves kicked in again. So we go to our room... we open it.. and ta-da! NOTHING WRONG WITH IT!!!! Solid win. For $50/night? Honestly.. I have no idea why people even complain... Red Roof Inns by airports aren't even $50/night... military hotels aren't even $50/night! YOU ARE ON THE STRIP OF LAS VEGAS PEOPLE. A bit far from the popular hotels but it is definitely walkable.. and there public transportation. It was NOT ""luxurious"" but the room did not smell, it was not dusty (I am highly allergic, so I would know.), the bathroom was clean, there was a mini-fridge... tv had limited channels but again, we were rarely in there. We would wake up, hit up the casino bar to get in on the $3cocktails then head to Peppermill for mimosas with our breakfast.. which was next door. ALSO, the slot machines were pretty ""loose."" I ended up just playing slots to fund my food and drinks for the day lol! I won over $100 on a couple of machines.. my husband and friend always played the Michael Jackson one, I always went for wheel of fortune and got lucky almost every time. 
Ok, now here's the thing. I went to see my friend's room (who was in the ""old"" tower) to see if the rooms are consistent.. and they are NOTTTT. His room DID have a funky odor... carpet was beige so you can definitely see stains all over the place.. but the room was bigger than ours. If we had gotten that room, I probably would have gone back to Sherry to get a room change honestly... that smell was a bit too funky for my taste lol. I honestly think that if you are not checking in too late or going on a busy weekend, you will get a great deal. It seems like the worst reviews on here are from people who have late flights and check-in after all the ""good"" rooms have been given away. I would also suggest to ask for a room at the Monaco Tower if available.
Bottom line, I would MOST DEFINITELY stay here again. We would walk the whole strip during the day, stopping by bars to keep up our ""buzz"".. cab it back to the Riviera and get ready for the night and leave again. I hope this review was helpful, and I hope that those who are having second thoughts staying at the Riviera will have a little relief lol. Also, you get free tix upon check-in for the comedy show.. it was pretty funny, I enjoyed it.

This wknd in Vegas was overly packed, so we were happy when we got such a great deal on a hotel!  Let me start by saying that I didnt really know that this hotel was so far down the strip... but its fine.. we could deal with the distance- not a big deal at all.

First off.. we reserved a two bed, non smoking room.. When we went to check in they had given our room up to whoever, and all that was left were a one bed non smoking or SMOKING rooms.  The lady at the front desk obviously didnt give two craps about what we wanted and basicalyl said too bad.. and said she would send a roll away.  Fine. Whatever.  it was already late and I had some late night partying to do, so we took what we got (the one bedroom non-smoking) and made our way to the room.  

The room was nice!  It was clean, it wasn't dingy, the beds looked new, the bathrooms redone!  Ok.. not so bad at all!  But an hour later, where was the roll away?!  We called the front desk and the woman has the nerve to tell us that they have 1 runner for 5 buildings, AND that because we booked it on PRICELINE,  we basically would have to wait longer.  Excuse me?!  What does HOW the room was booked have to do with the type of service we receive?!  Umm manager please!  

The manager apologized and said that the employees are not allowed to make comments such as that.  Within two minutes, the rollaway arrived.  

The next day after lunch, we returned to our hotel for a mid-afternoon nap (hey we partied till 5 am.. we were tired!) So we decided to give our car back to the valet.  It was full, but the previous nite, the valet was nice and held our car till they found a spot for us- no hassle.  This time- ""im sorry the valet is full"".  But we had seen TWO people pick their cars UP from valet.  how can it be full?

Then the valet guy asked us what room we were staying in, so we told him.  His answer, "" well Im not supposed to valet for you anyways"".  WHAT?!  Apparently that valet is reserved for ONLY people in THIS building, but there is NO OTHER VALET in the hotel.  Are you kidding me!?  

Parked the car, then went to the manager AGAIN.  His answer to this situation? ""Im sorry thats a different department.""  wtf.  He was going to comp us breakfast for the morning, basically to quiet us down.. but what he should have done after ALL that is comped us ONE night in the damn hotel, especially because we listed every complaint we had from the beginning.

All in all, the place it self wasnt bad.  But the service in this place makes this place totally NOT worth staying at (and btw, apparently a LOT of other ppl were complaining too).  Do not stay here if you want a pleasant experience!",BCF9zJkbGukrl9DldTbtRA,2,0,1,Za4sG5G7lJdQZGI7MrQ_nw

didn't spend much time in the casino. Plus is their convent store chain had good pricing even on the grab-n-go sandwiches. Strip valet parking fills quickly but found valet back by the convention center on property (and closer to rooms in the back.)

We just stayed here for 4 nights over the 2014 Super Bowl weekend and it was awesome! We arrived right at 4pm (enter valet/registration from Paradise Rd in the rear) and was taken at the counter immediately. We reserved a Suite, and they offered us a 1 bdrm deluxe suite for $40 more a night, and it was the best thing we could have ever done. It was a HUGE 1 bdrm suite on the 28th floor (with 2 walk out balconies) and a view of the strip. It was very clean, 2 flat screen tv's, wet bar, and 1 and a half baths.

The staff at the valet and front counter were very friendly, as well as the craps dealers were funnier than shit! The pool was closed, but we didn't care, it was a high of 55 degrees the entire time we were there. The Wicked Vicky Tavern by the casino had great food, as well as a shitload of beer choices, although just a tad slow on the service. 

Yes The Riviera is on the north end of the strip, and you will have to walk a bit to get to all the attractions. We took a $9 cab to drop us in the middle of the strip (30 minute walk, 5 minute cab ride). And that's where all the twinkie generation hoity toity snobs and guidos are. No thank you! 

If you want to go to Vegas and experience the CLASSIC-ness of it, the Riviera is for you. If you want to party till you puke with a bunch of whinny twinkie generationers, then stay somewhere in the middle of the strip, you won't have any problem catching a fight cuz some drunk guido thought someone was looking at his girlfriend or something.

The woman that I made reservations with on the phone lied through her teeth. When I made the reservation, she told us that we would have the ""family package,"" which is supposed to include two adjoining rooms, one with a king and one with two beds. When we got to the hotel, there were only rooms with king beds and no adjoining rooms. We had to get a cot, which usually costs $30 and I will give it to them that they comped this fee after much discussion. 

Then it turned out that the woman I talked with had completely lied about hours for the fitness facility and had told me that the pool was open when it was actually closed for the season! I would have booked another hotel based solely on this fact so when we found out that the pool was closed the next morning, we were pretty upset. 

We tried to contact the manager via this little phone on the front desk but of course the manager is ""unavailable"" and who knows when she/he will be available. 

THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE AND BEWARE THE STAFF WILL LIE TO YOU! In fact, as I was checking out, the person next to me who was checking in, was having a similar issue; she had made a reservation and then when she and her family arrived, the reservation was all wrong.

Once I got there, in order to check in, the lady at the counter told me to swipe my credit card and proceed with the check-in. After about a minute, while I was busy playing with the goddamn terminal, a couple jumped in front of me. I then got frustrated because I felt unattended and that I should have been able to leave the booking to the person at the counter and not a fucking screen.
I thought I was going to stay in a hotel but I quickly found out that the quality of the Riviera Hotel & Casino is comparable to any average motel (if not less than than). The view was horrible because we were facing a building under full construction so all we could see what scaffoldings. The faucet for the hot water did not shut off when I twisted it all the way left. I had to find a point where the water would stop. The drain for the bathtub did not drain quickly enough so it was almost as if I took a bath instead of taking a shower. Besides, the bathtub was not clean since it had dark spots that either didn't get cleaned or didn't come away.
If you want to connect to the Internet, you will have to pay a fee to do that.
When I checked out, I told the lady at the counter that I was not satisfied with my stay. She appeared to take notes but never apologized for the problems I encountered because she clearly couldn't care less. During the check-out procedure, I found out I had to pay an additional resort fee of about $7 in addition to the $91 I already paid.

1243620,2010-11-30,2,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"(Note, this is for the HOTEL only. I could care less about gambling)

I want to give it 3 and 1/2 stars, but Yelp doesn't offer that option yet. I had it at four until I remembered the long check-in and reduced staff feeling. 

But the big issue keeping me from giving it more is the ridiculous $10 charge for wi fi.  In this day & age, when every effing coffee shop has free wi fi, these guys can't as well? McDonalds has freaking wi fi now!!  

This amounts to a hidden room charge and for that amount I would rather stay at a LaQuinta Inn or other hotel-only place. 

I have to say the rooms were shockingly nice after walking through the casino that is trapped in some some sort of 60's/70's/80's mash-up. Check in took about 20 minutes because there was a crush of people due to a convention (reason we stayed there, mom was attending the convention and walks with a cane). For some reason the woman directing people at check in did not send them to unattended machines that would have sped up the process a lot. 

We had two different rooms (a double and a king-sized, both non-smoking) that were in the Monaco Tower. While not spacious, they were tastefully decorated. Each came with a desk, drawers, flat screen, ottoman high enough to use as a suitcase rack and mini-fridge hidden away. There were room-safes (my suitcase locks, so didn't need it). There were steam irons with boards in the closets and a hair drawer available in the bathroom. Plenty of towels were available. 

Everything was very clean, especially the sheets and bed linens. Speaking of which, the sheets were some of the softest I have found in hotel/motels. Also, really fast elevators that we never had to wait more than 30 seconds on. Actually that might be longer than we waited. 

If you drive to the hotel, use the Paradise Road entrance (where you will see a very convenient and cheap Arco gas station) for easy access to the parking garage. This is also the easiest way to access the convention entrance. 

The only place in the hotel I spent any time in was the Queen Victoria Pub which is open 24 hours with both food & drink. Really nice selection of beers on tap and some really good single malt scotches that our bartender charged us way under for. They have great homemade chips & crisps - be sure to ask for the curry sauce to dip them in. 

Another plus were the prices in the 24 hrs ABC Store next to Registration, which were reasonable. Pretty good selection of stuff too. 

As someone else pointed out, the Peppermill next door is a good (not great) place to eat. The decor is wonderfully kitchy neon over-the-top. And you have to check out the water fire pit next door.

It was great! Super clean, lcd tv, the works... Not such a good view of the strip - mostly a roof with a/c units - but a little sparkle of the Circus Circus across the street.

We walked to the check in desk but the queue was impossibly long so thanks to a review on Trip advisor, i knew about the check in machines in the hallways. I can highly recommend them, the process was quick and easy; and saved us about an hour waiting in line (we had tickets to a concert and were running late!)

Our room was in the Monaco tower on the 43rd floor, again the corridor smelt clean and the decor looked quite new. The room itself was very well furnished with two double beds, a decent sized TV and fridge...although there was no mini bar! The room was spotless, and the sheets on the beds were clean and crisp!

The bathroom was a standard hotel setup, with a few toiletries. Nothing exciting but again clean and well maintained.

I seriously would recommend this hotel, it's cheap and old but has been well refurbished. Also the Queen Victoria Pub does a stonking good breakfast and if you are a Las Vegas local they give you 10% off the bill!

The only down side is that it is a LONG walk to the center of the Strip, and not one i would recommend while wearing 3 inch heels!

1353809,2013-08-06,5,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"I try to make it out to Las Vegas once a year. I've stayed at many of the strip hotels before, but the Riviera has been my default location for the last several visits because I think it's an excellent value. Just a couple things you may want to consider before you read on: I tend to go to Las Vegas over the summer during the week, and I'm extremely low maintenance when I'm at a hotel. All I ask for is a mattress, running water, a television and a roof. If the janitor's closet has those things, they can put me in there and I'll be happy. 

Check in at The Riviera is normally a piece of cake.  From the moment I walk into the lobby, I'm on my way to the room in about five minutes. When I was there this past June, I had to wait in line for about fifteen to twenty minutes before I could check in; and had I gotten there later, I probably would've waited about twenty more by how much the line grew. If you think that's bad, keep in mind that in hotels like The Bellagio I've had to wait up to five hours for my room to be ready. 

The standard rooms vary in appearance. From my experience, the rooms in the Mediterranean Tower are the older looking ones and those in the Monaco Tower look like they were renovated in the last ten years. Their contents are the same. All have a bed, a lounge chair and ottoman, a desk, a television in a cabinet and a full bathroom in 500 square feet of space. That sounds okay, right? Do you know what a standard room at, say, Caesars Palace has? Exactly the same thing. The furniture is more modern looking, sure, but you're not getting anything extra except an additional $300 on your bill. If an ultra sleek looking room is worth that much to you, then got for it. To me, that's just a gimmick that I'm not going to fall for.

Regarding the reviews of people saying their rooms were dirty: luckily, I have yet to experience an unsatisfactory room at The Riviera. And I check, too. Whenever I go into a hotel I always check the corners of the mattress for bed bugs. Of course that doesn't mean they're lying, it just may not be as prevalent as you might think. Here's my take on it: First, many times when people say ""dirty"" what they really need to say is ""worn."" It's a hotel; that sort of thing is going to happen. And second, this is the Las Vegas strip, one of the most touristy places in the country if not the world and also one of the most putrefied. I don't care what hotel you're staying in, with all the scumbags coming in and out, there's a good chance that glass bottles have been broken, vomit has been expelled and hookers have been penetrated within and/or on the walls of your room. We try to ignore this reality whenever we vacation down there, but it's naïve to think that stuff doesn't happen. Some hotels are just better at hiding it than others. 

The reason for the lack of concealing their lecherous past might lie in the casino itself. I first went into the Riviera casino in 2003. It was as busy and noisy as those casinos on the center strip. And why wouldn't it have been? Back then this part of the strip was flooded in flashing neon lights from all the famous old casinos. If you wanted to know what the Las Vegas of the 60s looked like, this is where you came. Today, all but one of those neighboring casinos are gone and this part of the strip looks about as lively as the desert surrounding the city. Inside the casino is no different. Nobody's playing, therefore nobody is spending any money. Why not? Nobody has any reason to come this far north anymore. For many people, the strip might as well end at The Encore. It seems that those geniuses who tore down The Stardust, The New Frontier and Westward Ho forgot to build something else in their places. Until that empty space is occupied, people will continue to miss out on what I believe to be the last standing old timey casinos of the strip. No frills and no silly themes. Just good gaming. 

The Riviera has all the amenities of the more popular casinos such as a steak house, an excellent pub, a pool that goes deeper than four feet, a great value comedy show and a food court, but being so far off the beaten path makes it a victim of circumstance. Hopefully this place can keep its head above water until the north end of the strip livens up again. But stay here while you still have the chance. I've always had a great experience, and even though you're not in the middle of all the action, the only thing keeping you from there is an eight dollar 24-hour bus pass.

First off, they managed to mess up our reservation, thank goodness we had printed everything out because their computers said we were leaving a day earlier than what we had paid for. After waiting a lengthy time at the registration counter, we finally got settled into our room. Less than an hour later, we find a bed bug!!!!!!!!! We bagged it up & took it to the front desk....a security supervisor went in to let the hotel manager know what we had found and sent him back with new keys to completely different rooms.

So they give us new rooms & we get there & housekeeping has just arrived to get them ready.....seriously???!! I was pissed, I wasn't in the mood to wait another hour until our rooms were ready so I called the front desk & asked to speak to the manager which in turn gives us two of the shittiest rooms I have ever stayed in & called them ""suites"". From ripped up curtains to cabinets missing drawers & broken lamp shades, I was speechless.

I was there for a bachelorette party and we visited the show 'Men, the Experience' and had dinner in the steakhouse. The show was so much fun!-The boys paid some extra attention to the bride, which she loved. It's been a long time since I've had that much fun with my girlfriends. After the show we did a meet and greet with the dancers and then went to dinner in the steakhouse. The food was great, the waiters were friendly, the ambience was quiet and dark so it may have been a little bit better for a little bit of romance. Wink wink. We all ordered a variation of food and were happy with everything we ordered. it's very classic steakhouse food. Yum! Lots of bottles of wine later we ended up gambling and it just hanging out at the riv. We had a blast! It has an old Vegas feel to it and everyone who we encountered working there was super nice!

I will admit I didn't have big expectations because of all the bad reviews but I was completely shocked that the reviews were so low. I arrived Friday around 6 pm and waited to check I'm for no more then 15-20 minutes. There was plenty of staff working and James at the front desk did an excellent job of getting me the room I needed all in the same tower and floor as my friends. In no way is the Riviera comparable to newer Vegas hotels, but if you need a place to lay your head and hold your things it works fine. When we got to our room the ironing board was broke. We called the front desk and a new one was at our door in less then 5 minutes! I talked with some staff at Queen Victories Pub...excellent breakfast and wonderful staff...and they explained to me the Riv filed bankruptcy and was under new management. This may explain my experience compaired with other reviews. If you give the Riviera a try I'm sure your experience will be much closer to mine then those of past reviews.",4C5bfPUDGHsG0-VHL6uKxA,1,0,4,aCu2sbStUdGxE5cfgp1vpw
1376731,2009-03-09,3,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"No, we didn't stay at the Riviera.  But, since our flight was at 6:30 pm and our New York New York (ahem) (notice the quotes) ""LATE"" (end noticing of the aforementioned quotes) checkout was for NOON, well, we had some time to kill.

As mentioned in the review for NYNY, they have a great bell desk that will hold bags all day, free of charge, if you've stayed there.  So we checked our bags and went a-walkin'.

Straight on down the strip...passing the new development next door to Bellagio, the huge glassy glossy development for people that actually want to own condos on the strip, past the Bellagio, the Venetian, Paris!, the Venetian's twin sister Palazzo, the Wynn and it's twin, Encore (REALLY?!  You need two??), past the demolished Stardust lot, Circus Circus, the new Trump tower, all the way on down to the Riviera.  Here, we entered the casino to rid ourselves of any money we had left in our pockets.

You know, all those glamorous casinos and hotel resorts, fancy appointments and luxurious accommodations, well, they all boil down to one thing:  separating you from your money.  Some people need to be burped afterwards (before and during as well), and feel they ""deserve"" luxury, or what the fuck ever.  So, they stay at plush hotels, spend lots of money on the room before spending lots of money in the casino.  It's all just too much.

The Riviera, to me, is classic Las Vegas.  It's casino looks like a regular casino.  The forty-something waitresses in tights who bring you ""free"" beers while you spend roll after roll of quarters at the Wheel! Of! Fortune!!!! are friendly, and never fail to call you sweetie, or hon'.  And the restroom is actually within a five minute walk of the casino...a HUGE advantage over the mega-resorts further down the Strip.

When you're ready to leave to pick up your bags at NYNY on your way to the airport, just be sure you've saved enough money for the cab ride and the tip for the bellhop.  Cause otherwise, you're a classic Vegas chump.

The nostalgic part of me doesn't want Las Vegas developers to continue their process of destruction of the older casinos and hotels.  Something in Vegas needs to be seedy, besides the intentions of the casino owners and the deviant minds of its visitors, that is.

I mean, just walking this place and you can feel something is missing. It for sure needs renovation.

It's really not fair. This place opened in the 50's and you can tell it's iconic and has had many stars and amazing people walk through it's halls.

However, time has clearly passed this place over. The carpets are stained and dirty, the casino feels outdated. Even the shows don't seem to call to me.

I've made a conscientious decision to plant my ass in the hotel where I'm staying at (that's the whole point, right?) throughout my weekend trips; and so I didn't linger anywhere and stayed put here.

Upon check-in, the clerk gave us the wrong room number. We had some girls come with us in a different room and they gave us another horror story of a rude check in clerk.

When I tried to watch TV, I kept fiddling around. Found the porn channel and they were charging over $12 to view it. No thanks. Internet porn is free. Thanks.

So after roaming the casino, I found a bar that seems to be the reason why I gave this place an extra star. $1 beer. That's truly something special to have.

As for everything else. The food court is dismal and one friend told me the service was horrible at the Indian food place. The Banana Leaf Cafe was horrible as well. I didn't even bother with any of the shows because none of them appealed to me, unfortunately.

The R Steak restaurant was the only saving grace here as well. The only gem to be found and clearly a reason for you to visit the Riviera.

The pool was pretty neat, up until I went by the 3-ft area with the stairs to climb out and found a bunch of debris and a floating Corona cup. Not quite cool.

To make matters worse, my final night I ended up taking a walk towards Encore/Wynn, a hotel who clearly over-shadows the Riviera by a long shot. Upon entrance I can spot a difference IMMEDIATELY. There were so many beautiful women walking around and even if you took that away, you had people walking everywhere, it got so full at one point that we  almost got lost in the midst of it all.

Their nightclub 'Tryst' has more swag than the whole of the Riviera combined. And I HATE the word Swag.

Finally going back to my hotel in the wee hours and I just felt deflated. No nightclub to speak of, no night-life. Just old folks gambling.

Which brings me back to my original notion. It's not fair that an older establishment like this should be compared to by other more modern casino's. There is a certain charm to this place that should be absorbed. Unfortunately, in this day and age, I don't think that's enough to stay on par or ahead of the competition.",T2h6OlazEQRU9y4j1AlgIw,10,1,2,pPrJE5e_k7EFT3e0AWz_OQ

(+/-) If you sign up for a players card, you get to eat at the buffet once for free. I'm pretty sure this would cost you like $15 for breakfast/lunch usually, so probably even more for dinner. I went around brunch time.

The Valet was 5 stars. They always did their hardest work and fastest to ensure we had our car very quickly, even with a line. They were always courteous and always very nice.

One Star - Check in. The line for check in wrapped around the block, and after a five hour car ride, i was not thrilled. We were there late, like 1130, and it took us a half hour. there were only two people who were checking in people. Finally we went to the express check in, and got in our room. 

The Decor - one star. It was old, original paint on the walls, carpet looked sad and disgusting.

Our room - one star. Yes, it looked as though some woman had their period on the chair in our room, and then they tried to clean it up, but the stain was there forever. Can we say, new chair? I guess not. Our AC didn't work very well, the fan was not blowing so it was hot and stuffy, the bed was AWFUL and our TV was smaller than any TV I had seen before. It probably would have cost less than 20 bucks, it didnt even turn off. 

Casino - I did pretty well in the casino, but the cocktail waitresses were rude, old and haggared. She literally yelled at my husband while i was deciding what drink I wanted. Rude beotch.

Blackjack tables - they had girls dancing on poles which was pretty good, but the blackjack tables were being dealt by incompetent people. The girl at our table talked to other people, stared off into the distance, and yelled at every person with a dirty look who left the table. She was unprofessional, and replaced by someone even more unprofessional. This girl started talking to the pit boss in the middle of a hand, about her day off on this coming wednesday.

The only place in Vegas my voucher was valid for was the Riviera and I figured, ""how bad can it be?""  Old Vegas has it's charm, it's still on the Strip, so I thought it would be fine.

Esh.  Where do I start?  First off, the elevators in the parking structure are seriously scary.  Everytime we got in them, someone would remark that we were going to die, the cables would creak, and it was just freaky.  It got to the point where we started walking the 6 flights of stairs just to avoid the scary elevators.  We also started parking in the uncovered lot just past the garage, just to avoid the elevators!

Check-in?  Slow like molasses.  

Shops?  Lame.  The only good stores are the ABC stores, which have very reasonable prices.

The room?  It looked like it hadn't been updated since the 80s, except for a flat screen TV and iHome alarm clock.  The clock still had the wrong time and nobody had changed it since daylight savings ended.  The AC in our room rattled all night and we had to slap the panel in the ceiling to get it to stop.  Every hour it would start again.  We really should've asked for our money back at that point.  The walls were thin so we could hear the guy next door yelling at his kids at 7AM.  The curtains didn't close all the way, so we woke up when the sun came up.

The bathroom was okay, but there wasn't even a stopper in the sink.  I was paranoid I would lose an earring down that thing.

The first room that was so called remolded had a hole in the wall in the bathroom and broken furniture in the bathroom. Also, the room was really cramped and small. So we asked for another room and decided to go with the rooms that were not remolded since they were bigger.  

We get to our new room and as soon as we step in it smells like cat piss! We switch rooms again.

1601363,2014-11-04,12,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"Staying at the Riviera was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Absolute nightmare.

My girlfriend and I had booked 3 nights at the Riviera 3 and half months before we stayed there. We selected a non-smoking luxury room with a king bed. I double checked the reservation before we left, and everything was good to go - we were excited! We checked into the hotel late in the evening and were given our room key along with some brochures. Tired from the drive, we couldn't wait to get to our room and crash. But upon finding our room we discovered that we had been placed in a smoking, classic room with two beds. 

The room stank. Neither I nor my girlfriend are smokers, and though we had specifically booked a non-smoking room, we were forced to cohabitate amidst the saturated stench of a dirty ash tray. But the smell wasn't the only unpleasant thing about the room, not by a long shot. For starters, it was ugly as sin. There walls were stained, the bathroom cabinets were missing knobs, and the wallpaper was so hideous that it took every ounce of willpower I had not to gouge my eyes out.

I immediately called the front desk to get this sorted out, explaining that there was a mistake and we had not been placed in the room we ordered online. The front desk clerk told me that the hotel was completely booked and there were no available rooms to switch into. She suggested checking back in the morning around 11:00 a.m. to see if there had been any check outs.

11 a.m. rolls around and I am at the front desk checking to see if anything has opened up. Nothing. The clerk tells me there are still no available rooms, but to try back in a few hours. Fast forward and I'm back there again listening to them tell me that there are no rooms and there is nothing they can do. I ask to speak to the manager, and after about 15 minutes of waiting, he comes out of his office to speak with me. The clerks at least pretended like they wanted to help me and were doing everything they could, this guy had a pompous air about him that let me know I was wasting his time before he even said anything. I once again explained my situation, to which he smugly replied that the room choice option on their website was a preference and did not guarantee that the preferred room type would be reserved. Furthermore he told me that the hotel had enough guests to fill the luxury rooms, so he didn't feel inclined to switch us. Then, with the phoniest and most self-satisfied smile I had ever seen, he reiterated that there was nothing more he could do. 

What kind of bullshit is that? I don't know about you, but when I book a room I assume that the room I booked will be reserved.

Feeling defeated, I retired to my room to tell my girlfriend what had happened. But it wasn't over.

Later that night, we were getting ready to go to sleep. I was laying on the bed watching TV and she was just stepping into the bathroom when suddenly she released a blood curdling shriek. She screamed so loud I was sure I was about to see a dead body laying there on the bathroom floor. What I saw was worse. Scurrying across the floor was the most enormous cockroach I have ever seen. This thing was HUGE I'm talking the size of a small mouse. 

After completely losing our shit, my girlfriend and I regrouped to formulate a plan of attack. Our first instinct was to curb stomp the shit out of this vile creature, and send it back to the pits of hell from whence it came. But we resisted these urges in favor of a much more devious plan - bring it to the front desk.

I somehow managed to capture the disgusting hell-beast in a plastic cup, and skipped joyfully down to the lobby to speak with the manager. He emerged from his office looking complacent as ever, no doubt prepared to send me packing once again. ""How can I help y--"" he began to say as I placed the cup on the counter in front of him. Upon seeing this captured behemoth, his eyes went wide and the smugness left his face faster than you can say ""la cucaracha."" He was utterly petrified, and I was loving every second. Fixated on the cup for a few moments, he looked up at me with a grimace and said ""I don't like bugs."" And without missing a beat my girlfriend replied, ""Neither do we."" The delivery of that line could have been straight out of a movie, almost too good to be unscripted.

To his credit, the manager ended up giving us a $40 compensation to eat at one of the hotel restaurants. It didn't make up for our experience but at least it was something. In addition, he MAGICALLY found a luxury room for us to stay in for our final night there. So on one hand that was nice, but also a glaring confirmation that those assholes lied to us about the hotel being completely booked. Overall, I would rate my experience at the Riviera as thoroughly horrendous and would NOT recommend anyone to go there. Ever.",ReZOZpCWDffzwufzyEgdYQ,11,1,1,Z5RCHYJpupFGfa1xAZJ7VQ

The rooms have been cosmetically updated, but the shower was mildewy and the room had an old wall AC unit that was loud, ran constantly and was probably filled with mold (I woked up with my allergies going INSANE). Finally, you know you're in a seedy place when there is a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE DISPOSAL in the bathroom. WTF!?

The hotel hosted a conference for 3,000 people, but wasn't properly staffed to handle it. You had to wait at least 30 minutes for the pleasure to eat at one of their disgusting restaurants. All of the food I ate at the restaurants was deep fried dreck. I'm amazed I didn't get ill.

The casino is old, depressing and attracts a lot of creeps. At night they had a scantily clad girl dancing on a pole. Just sad.

Its not even worth it to stay here on the cheap since its so far north on the strip. You have to take an expensive cab ride to get anywhere other than Circus Circus (which is just as seedy and gross). The wynn is probably the closest place at a 10 minute walk.

In fact I bet the only reason our conference was at this hotel was because they probably gave our society some amazing deal on conference space rental probably because they had no other business otherwise.

Why do you ask? Well let me tell you. First, the WHOLE hotel smells like smoke. I know it is legal in Vegas blah blah blah, but this hotel reeked. AND to top it off, our no-smoking room smelled so much like cigarettes it made me and my roommate have a headache and made all of our clothes instantly smell like it too!

You ask, well you should have called to have your room switched? WELL I DID. And I had to be transferred 4 times before I could talk to a manager who then maybe believed me that my room smelled like smoke. I AM THE CUSTOMER! And when it comes to second hand smoke you and your hotel should really try a little harder to please your guests. So they had to send up an inspector to ENSURE that the room actually smelled like smoke, because they still didn't believe me since I was in the non-smoking tower, and they claimed there was no way it could smell that way.

Guess what, the inspector walked in and said, wow it really does smell like smoke in here. And we FINALLY got transferred about an hour later! This is just unacceptable treatment. And the hotel didn't say sorry, didn't comp us or anything. 

Know what else was bad? Well their key cards for the doors were constantly not working, the hair dryer only worked in 2 second intervals and then would need over 10 minutes of rest before it could be turned on again, the wifi is slow and pricey, the drink girls were how do i say this nicely totally not vegas material, the decor just made me feel run down just looking at it, the food in this hotel is not good, and last but not least? Well, this hotel is so unpopular (maybe the scary clown across the street at circus circus scares some away), that you cannot get a cab here to save your life. I waited 20 minutes until a cab was bold enough to drive down the cab lane. And when I got in and said I was going to the Bellagio, my driver asked, oh is that where you are staying? This hotel isn't very good. At that moment I knew that I was officially jealous of everyone I knew in the Bellagio, and that I would never stay at this hotel ever again.

THE GOOD - 
- My Monaco Tower room had a decent view and was a good size
- The grocery shops offere staples at somewhat realistic prices (food, liquor, souvenirs, etc.)
- The food court (though clearly dated in atmosphere) has some 24 eats that taste good (Indaian, burgers, etc.)
- There's a nice cafe with hot drinks and light food fare for airport prices (thought still tasty)
- It's walkable to a 24  hour Denny's
 - the have poker tables and tournaments (thought most games are no limit)

THE BAD - 
- the quality of the room is a crap shoot.  I visited some friends staying the same week and felt bad for them (no view, no frig, and wierd room configuration) The hotel is like 3 different hotels were united under one name but have different quality and style
- They have a pool! However for the size of the place, I couldn't believe that one little pool was to serve everyone (I literally looked and asked around for another pool).  Imagine combining two Hampton Inn ""swimming pools"" and having them serve3 high rise apartment buildings.
- everything is heavily DATED! neon lights, wallpaper, food court from the early 90s
- the worst  of it were a coupon book given at check-in coupled with multiple in-room ads and flyers that promoted deals that no longer existed (some by months) 
(for example, free Bingo cards - Bingo room permanently closed over a month ago, monetary bonuses for joining casino club - ended long before out arrival
- Limited table gaming (yet a good variety. There's one table each of multiple games.  So, people stood around waiting for others to give up seats - which can take hours)

 The room iteself is ok. It's a decent size, and the furniture, though out of date, isn't any worse than the one at the old tower at Caesar's. I liked the bed, but I missed having a nice, snuggly comforter. Bath tolietries were better than expected. We were right next to the pool, and it's a good thing we didn't plan on sleeping in because the shitty pop music starts blasting in around 8am.

It was easy to get around the hotel and casino area. Gambling here was fine, but we seemed to have better luck across the street at Circus Circus. There was a cool gambling promo advertised in the room (1st $1000 on us!), but it had since expired. I was disappointed that the bingo room closed as well.

The two big negatives was the buffett and parking. Both were sketchy as hell. I had oatmeal so bad that Oliver Twist would have turned his nose up at it. I think they used triple the amount of water that they were supposed to, and the water was obtained from a mop bucket. Parking was very inconvient and poorly marked.

This hotel isn't on top of all the action of the stip, so the prices tend to be a litte more reasonable.. and i think they are either remodeling or have a newer 'tower' in the mix.... however, I got assigned to maybe one of their orginal rooms?  You know, back in the day when the average human was only like... 4 ft 11 or so?  you would think so when you step into a shower and have to swat down to get your head wet.  It was either a very high faucet or very low shower head.

It has potential but there are just so many things wrong with how it is run.  My biggest issue was the lack of up keep.  The Casino, lobby, front doors and elevator were dirty throughout our weekend stay.  Finger prints, garbage, scratches, scrapes---it was really hard to look at the place on our way up to our rooms.  The check in process was inefficient.  They have one line for all needs and this one line moves ultra slowly.  When we checked in we waited in a long line and as we came and went we frequently saw an extraordinary long line.  They a few elevators that serviced all floors (not one for higher and another for lower floors) so the elevators were always very full.  

The rooms:  Were surprisingly nice.  We almost left after the check in process because we were so horrified but the rooms were nice!  Up to date, clean, spacious.   We were shocked!  The pool was okay---very loud could hear it from our rooms in the afternoon hours (or power nap time!).

There were some things they can easily improve on though.  For starters they could have nicer bathing soap in the rooms.  It takes half a bar and half an hour to take a shower, but the water was hot so that was a good thing.  The bars and restaurants in the casino need to upgrade their  wine list.  The list were just mediocre at best.  One place only had one white and one red.  Beer or hard liquor were better drinking choices.  My friend was in a much older part of the hotel with the original room fixtures and her experience was not as good as mine.  I think for this hotel you probably should plan on staying in an upgraded room.  It cost a little more but is still under $50.00 a night.

1901923,2013-11-16,1,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"Not terrible for the price. Our experience is best summed up in a list of Pros & Cons.

Pros:
-Wicked cheap! If you are looking to go to Vegas on a budget and don't plan on spending a ton of time in your room (who would in Vegas?) it's worth considering.
-Comfortable beds.
-Great fitness facility - equipment is new and the view from the 12th floor location is great.
-Good restaurants on site.
-Freebies! We received a coupon book with some great discounts to shows and restaurants on site as well as two free tix to the comedy show which was awesome!

Cons:
-While they play up the retro/classic angle quite a bit the hotel is old and outdated. If you are looking for a new hotel or a themed experience (a la a Luxor for example), stay elsewhere.
-The bathroom in the room is pretty tiny. Really. Like peeing in a closet. I had to shut myself in and sweat it out while blow drying my hair because otherwise my elbow was hitting the door.
-Parking is a big issue. We had a rental car and drove to several casinos while in town, not having any problems parking in any of their garages. It might be beneficial for the Riviera to look at expanding their garage or designating it for hotel guests only. After spending a day out and about the Vegas area I was incredibly annoyed that as a paying guest upon my return I had to go and park in the convention center's ramp and hoof it back to the hotel after a long day. The Riviera's garage and all adjacent lots were completely full. Well, at least we thought it was full. Although parking attendants were directing traffic away from the garage, it appeared that there were plenty of spots open outside of the valet area. 
-Your Do Not Disturb sign means nothing. When staying at a hotel, unless I plan to be there for five days or more I usually forgo maid service. This particular trip we were staying only three nights, so I set out our Do Not Disturb sign. On our last night there we arrived back at our room to find our Do Not Disturb sign missing and our room ""cleaned"" (I use quotation marks because other than the beds being made and clean towels being put out it really hadn't been touched). Not only that, but we requested late check out (noon) for the next day and then had a maid walk into our room at 8 AM! Then again right at 11! This is the situation I was least happy with. Be advised that your Do Not Disturb sign is not a guarantee and anytime you are in the room it's best to put the chain on the door. I was going to discuss this with the desk upon check out, but the line was so long that we simply dropped our keys and left. 

If not for the parking and the issues with housekeeping I would have given Riviera three stars. Overall it's not bad for the price - great if you are trying to do Vegas on a budget, but don't expect a perfect experience.",F5FjOYlaVqHMpo0Caoz6MA,1,0,2,ZM22zt_WcUwgzdv8tMmNjA
1911451,2013-02-03,2,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"This hotel is really disgusting. Someone else reserved the room or else I would have stayed somewhere else. To start off with, it's really confusing and inconvenient to get to the parking lot. The line at the front desk is really long and the first time we got our room keys, they didn't even work. Our room was also really far from the front desk and we got lost on the way there.

When we got in the room, we were struck by how outdated and gross it was. The chairs and carpets were stained and nasty. There were three giant blood stains on the wall- one was over a foot long and two inches wide. It looked like someone died in there. The bathroom had a blood spray stain. Really creepy. The window had no screen and was recently nailed so it would only open a couple inches. The door looked like it had been busted in at one point. I heard that there used to be a lot of mob murders at this hotel, and I believe it, it definitely looked like someone died in that room. We requested a different room, but they did not give it to us.

I had been looking forward to going swimming, but the pool was closed.

In the morning, they were blasting music in the pool area at 8 am and playing loudspeaker announcements. The pool area was closed anyway, so it made no sense for them to be doing this. Because the windows were so thin, it made it impossible to sleep. Instead of coming to clean the room in the afternoon, the maids started knocking on the door at 9 am. No one gets up that early in Vegas- people tend to stay out late and sleep in.

This hotel has a very inconvenient location- at the very far end of the strip, a couple miles away from most of the attractions.

None of them were cleaned. We even asked one of the housekeepers who was 3 doors away to make sure to clean our room. We came back a few hours later and our rooms were still not cleaned. Every worker there was unhappy and looked like they were out of it. Service was very slow no matter where you went. And parking sucked . valet gets packed and self parking was full!!

Please avoid this place if you go or at least pick somewhere that is closer to the strip. I wshould have stayed at circus circus or excalibur. I probably would have had a better experience.

oh and i forgot. They charged me a $22 fee if which i left numerous messages and e-mails as to what this charge was for and no one has gotten back to me.

There wasn't a refrigerator in our room, the room didn't come stocked with all of the essentials for travel, the TV service in the room is lacking (HDTV with no HD and lousy low def lodgenet service), and we had two rooms we had booked to be next to each other, but they were not able to make this happen. However, the casino is very nice and the staff is very friendly, and there's a nice pool and a tattoo shop along with other shops. Just take note that the Mediterranean Tower is inexpensive, so expect to be a bit underwhelmed. The one thing that made my 3 star rating a 2 star was the unavailability of WiFi, which is crucial for someone like me. The WiFi was working great on our first night's visit, but then the WiFi network dropped off early the next day on my and my friend's devices, and I was unable to log on with my laptop computer. Certainly the hotel can provide better coverage, especially for someone who might have to remotely connect into work in the case of an urgent matter, and it would have also been nice to play music on too. Of course I was in an inexpensive part of the hotel, but I wouldn't stay at a hotel that didn't have reliable WiFi. I called the front desk to complain and they thanked me for reporting it, but unfortunately we were unable to get back on the WiFi network in my and my friend's room, and we were a good distance apart. I hate to say it, but I don't think I would stay at this hotel unless I was given a free night's stay in a better room with WiFi that will continue to work.

Checkin was an absolute nightmare; it took over an hour for a line that wasn't really that long. Upon arrival, I discovered that I had accidentally booked a smoking room through Orbitz (even though I specified that I wanted a non-smoking room, I somehow chose an ""upgraded"" room in a tower that ONLY has smoking rooms...wtf). The girl who checked me in said that she could get me a non-smoking room in another tower, but that it would cost extra. I agreed only because I didn't want to spend a week in a room that reeked of cigarettes.

Turns out, my new room came equipped with pillowtop mattresses and a mini fridge. I later wondered if I could have transferred to a room in another tower that didn't have all these bells and whistles and not have had to pay extra. Oh well...

The pool is a LOT smaller than the other Vegas hotels I have been to. The Riv is also not very convenient to other places on the strip. It IS, however, located very close to a Walgreen's where you can stock up on goodies for your mini fridge. The layout of the hotel is awful and it's hard to find anything -- but I suspect most Vegas hotels are arranged like this so that you find yourself getting lost in the massive casino.

At one point, the girl who I was sharing the hotel room with called down to the front desk to ask about using the safe that came in our room. She was on hold for 20 minutes and was transferred twice just to ask this simple question.

I agree with some of these reviews, if you are expecting a high class joint, then this hotel is not for you. But for the price you can't beat it. We always stay in the Monaco Tower and we have never had issues. Although we have stayed in other hotels on the strip, The Riviera is the one we always come back to. You can't beat the minimum bets (because who the heck wants to play $25-35 min bets at other casinos, that are so packed you can't freakin breathe! ?!?) well certainly not us. We also enjoy that even on super packed weekends, we can sit at the bar and order good drinks for 1/2 the costs of those at other places. If you are into the club scene (or you are a twenty- something year old dressing in you underwear to hit the clubs) then this place is not for you, REPEAT, this place is not for you. You will not find clubs at this hotel, but f  you are done with all the club ""hype"" then come on in and stay awhile. Like I said, you cannot beat the prices, the game variety, the table minimums, and the drinks. The restaurants are not bad either (but let me save that for a later time). 

The crowd is mixed, you will find a bit of everyone in this hotel. All those people complaining about the smoke,well let me see...did you remember you are in Vegas? The smoking capital of the country? Ummmm..sorry cupcake but that comes with the territory. Sure it's smoky, ventilation is not like the new hotels., but it's not as bad as when you head to downtown. and lets remember this hotels has been around for 60 years so of course smoke is part of the deal. But in our room we have never NEVER had an issue with the smoke smell. 

Earlier I said I have never had a problem and I was not lying. We hit Vegas 2x a year and each time, the check in is a breeze, the staff is courteous and accommodating (even on last minute trips, I can always find a spot here). The parking structure probably needs a real updated because it is a bit scary, but they have security driving around so I don't freak out about that. 

This past weekend that we were there, we noticed that a lot of new hotels are being put up around , so i have a feeling sooner or later this part of town will start to pick up the pace, but I just hope the Riviera does not lose itself, because as old as it is, it has a rich history and its one of the last standing ""original hotels"".",US5Wov8LcMnsAtd3zqjdXg,5,0,4,skUsVZST4duWjO93N7l_Rg

2089166,2015-05-05,6,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"I'm yelping here to pay my respects to the Riviera Hotel and Casino.  Just like previous posters Shawn J. and Jamael T., the Riv's closing is a sad event for me.  I regret being unable to travel to Vegas to say goodbye one last time.

I've been to Las Vegas a total of three times and each time I've stayed at the Riviera.  I called it my home away from home whenever I'm in Sin City.  I first chose to stay there because a poetry convention I was attending was being held there.  I fell in love with the place immediately.  To me it represents what Las Vegas is all about:  The flashy neon signs, the casino, the Crazy Girls, and the overall tradition.  It was cool to know that I was staying at the hotel that members of the Rat Pack once called home.  

I am a traditionalist at heart.  I wanted to feel like I was in old school Las Vegas.  I know that the rooms were ordinary hotel rooms but I'm just a simple man from Georgia who doesn't need all the extra amenities that some posters here complain the Riviera lacks.  So what if there was no coffee maker in my room!  So what if the Riv doesn't match the modern glamour of the Venetian, the Wynn, etc.!  So what if it took a minute to check into my room!  All I needed in a Vegas hotel was there.  

Every time I was there, I took in the full classic, corny, ambience of the place.  I made it a priority to attend a Crazy Girls show every time I was there even though the show didn't change much in the three trips I made there.  And after the show, I made sure I got my photo taken with the Crazy Girls.  They took the photo with a Polaroid camera but that was ok.  The girls were nice and treated me like I was somebody.  

I would walk through the casino even though I didn't gamble, except for when I had loose change and took a chance with the slot machines.  But I just HAD to walk through that casino!  I'd hear the machines ringing and the lounge act singing and I smiled.  I was in Las Vegas!  

I didn't care about the crowd being an older crowd in comparison to most of the other theme hotels on the strip.  I actually found it refreshing.  I like older women and I looked at the Riviera hotel as a place I could relax without all the noisy teens and twenty year olds after I returned from a busy day checking out the rest of the strip and downtown.  And when I say I had a busy day, I mean it.  I know that the Riviera wasn't on the most action-packed part of the Strip but I used to walk all the way from the Riviera to the world famous Las Vegas sign on the other end of the Strip taking pictures of everything with my camera.  It was a long walk but it was worth it.  Later I would get on a Deuce bus and hang out on Fremont at night.  

In short, my whole Vegas vacation centered around the Riviera Hotel and Casino.  No one was mean to me when I went and I felt like a high roller from Ocean's Eleven there.  The Riv was affordable and rubbing the bronze butts of the Crazy Girls replica outside the casino was a part of my overall Vegas experience.  I don't know why, but the last time I was there I choked up a little inside as I turned my room key in before I headed back to Georgia.  I told the pretty Latina at the the front desk, ""I'll see you again soon.""  I guess I couldn't keep that promise.  

I don't care what anybody else says, The Riviera Hotel and Casino will be missed.  I'm at a loss for where I want to stay whenever I return to Sin City.  The newer hotels are more extravagant and while they're nice, they're so cookie cutter by comparison.

Horrible. Filthy. Worst customer service ever. Casino has literally 20 machines. No live dealers. This has been the worst hotel experience ever in my life, or should I say, Motel? I arrived at Riviera around 11PM to check in. The Valet guy was rude... 

Whatever, I just wanted to get into my room. Getting there, the clerk said we didn't specify which room my husband & I wanted so he would give us a smoking room with 2 queen beds. I didn't want to get a smoking room so I was willing to pay $20 bucks to upgrade to a 1 King size bed & no smoking. The clerk says, ""I'll upgrade you guys to the new tower."" -- in his mono-toned voice btw-- so any way, we get up to our room I thought this was a joke. It was worst than the local LA QUINTA. This is upgraded???? The room was HUMID, the fridge was broken, one of the lamps was also broken (button was gone) and the thing that got me the most was the HALF USED SHAMPOO bottle without a conditioner or hand soap to offer (which is what NORMAL hotels give you) OH and there was also a dirty hand print on our table. There was also a paper that says, ""This room has been cleaned by..."" and no one signed it... lol.... hmmm.

I am an easy going girl, really, but this was outrageous. Half used shampoo? Really? Could've refilled it at least so I wouldn't know :p anyways... I went down stairs and ordered to get my money back, (so about 15-20 minutes have passed now) the clerk went to the back to talk to his manager.... he talked for about 15 minutes, comes back out and does some typing on the computer.... then he says, ""m'am we would refund you your money but it says you have been in the room for past 30 minutes."" -- ARE YOU KIDDING ME? It takes at least 5-10 minutes to walk from the front desk to my hotel PLUS I've been standing there for 15 minutes waiting on him and he KNOWS that, and that's basically what I told him. He then goes to the back again and the manager comes out and instead of being NICE and comforting the customer.... no.... she acts like a total ... B....  ok so all this arguing goes on and she does not want to refund the money nor does she make me feel better (customer is supposed to always be right...) 

So FINALLY I demanded a different room AT THE LEAST... and she gives it to us.... so when we are heading to the room, we ask a different hotel clerk that checked us in the first time where the nearest rest room was and THIS A---HOLE says, ""I'm off the clock"" and just keeps walking... seriously dude? Just POINT your hand in the right direction!!! Nope... we should've known... shouldn't have wasted our time asking any way.... 

We get to our room, it's still disgusting but HEY at least my shampoo bottle isn't half used.... OH LOOK our lamp AND fridge works (even though it sucks lol) OH and the most important thing... the service card (whoever cleaned the room) WAS SIGNED!!! lol.... but yeah this place was horrible... USUALLY customer service HELPS make up for any mishaps but not here. That's probably why you would never want to stay here. You can pay the same price and stay at the Platinum hotel... I stayed there after this place and it made up for EVERYTHING!!!! Then again, I'm sure any other MOTEL would be better than the Riviera.

It had a king bed, a fridge, a clean iron and ironing board, and a nice bathroom.  My room was reasonably well soundproofed, and the individual air conditioning unit drowned out any noise that got through.  The WiFi service was fast and stayed up the whole week.

2158926,2013-02-27,1,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"This was by far the most pathetic hotel I have stayed at by a drastic margin. This review is for the hotel and casino itself, all restaurants will be reviewed separately as many were not one-star.

The room itself cost $40-60 per night not including taxes or resort fees. As cheap as that sounds, that's horribly expensive for the Riviera due to timing. It's not unfair, but I'm going to have at least minimum expectations for that. I booked a standard non-smoking room on the basis of it really being a place to sleep, shower, and change clothes. Of course, I find out the reservation was ""changed"" to a smoking room. After making it clear that was not an option, they offered a ""free"" upgrade to a ""luxury"" room in the Monte Carlo tower. Those quotes are there for good reason.

Having a confirmed reservation for a non-smoking room means just that. I know the front desk staff has little discretion there aside from existing management plans. The fact that they quickly found an ""upgrade"" made it clear there was an overbooking and they wanted to make themselves look good. I would give them credit for that if it were a real upgrade. I'd even give it a pass if what I got was a reasonable standard room. However, the ""recently renovated"" Monte Carlo tower certainly remains pathetic. The shower head and faucet had plenty of hard water buildup and chips in them. I'm fairly sure they were older than I am. The smoke detector had an inspection sticker from 2008. At least one bath towel had a hole in it. The pillow cases had a few minor stains. The Monte Carlo tower itself has a pervading scent which I knew I would be scrubbing off the minute I got back to my own shower. Honestly, I'd expect better than this for $50 on a weekday or $70 on the weekend. Resort fee included there since it is part of the price. 

The casino is reasonably open and uncrowded, leading to only moderate smoke smell. On the other hand, this led to many empty table games. I believe I saw craps open once. They seemed content to rely on a video craps game with a dice shaker machine. There was a heavy reliance on penny progressive slots with a handful of quarter/dollar slots scattered about. Video poker pay lines were the worst of any I have seen. It's almost as if they intentionally want people to end up frustrated with the entire place and go away as quickly as possible. Even when I was winning, I felt as if in a way, I was still losing. Every single other place I have touched on the strip was friendlier and more pleasant of a location.

The comps are virtually nonexistent aside from the standard cocktail offers. They couldn't even get their player's club rewards straight between signs and people.

If not for events at the Riviera, the only purpose to go there would be the exercise from walking that far down the strip.",m2a1WvdBx9tCohxvhPaTyQ,1,2,1,b43BEPA8hwBYiVniMBBPlg

The first lady we spoke with at the front desk was helpful and pointed us to an area we could pickup wifi while waiting for our room. The bellman was friendly and helpful in holding our luggage. Since we didn't pay to upgrade, we got what we expected--a run down 1 star...maybe 2 star hotel room.

There was a view of the pool, so that was better than nothing (although later we found it was closed until after our checkout date). According to the front desk lady the room we were getting had been ""partially updated"", but all we noticed was a new tub liner and shower curtain. When we went to put our valuables in the safe it said ""low battery"", so we called and they sent maintenance up. He wasn't able to do anything, so we asked for a different room. We were moved up a floor to the side overlooking the disgusting lower roof. Both rooms were the same. Old, dingy, over used, and barely holding themselves together.

The hotel was dead at all various hours that we were coming and going each day, so we're not sure why we couldn't have been checked into a nicer room, and earlier in the day. The bed was comfortable, wifi was strong and for the most part everything was clean-ish.

We stopped in the general store for a postcard and the business center for a stamp. Both lady's that helped us were friendly. The guy at the little coffee/bagel stand was also genuinely nice.

We ate at the R Buffet for b-fast and it was okay, but not worth the discounted rate we paid. We watched the magic show, which was pretty cool but don't pay full price for this either. It was an entertaining show but not worth some of the ticket prices we came across. We ate at the bar in the R Steak and Seafood restaurant because we had an offer of 20% off the entire bill, but when it came time to pay we were told it was only good in the dining room. We showed the manager there was no stipulation in the offer, but instead of correcting our bill he took my name and number and said he would see what they could do in the form of comps. We never heard back from him.

In the end, this hotel needs to be demolished unless it's being kept for that original vegas feel. Do NOT pay full price to stay here--$25 per night max because there is also a $15 resort fee (common for most hotels in the area).""",Hpy3N_oKFUrqKQPaN9LgkQ,1,0,1,7ZDz8eytML6clkBNaT5XqA

2232292,2009-10-08,13,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"Walking into this place is like stepping back in time.  Circa 1978.  Back in the day, my parents would come to Vegas to see Rich Little, Joan Rivers, and Frank.  (if you ask ""Frank who?"" I will punch you in the crotch).  And the Riviera was the place to be.  Emphasis on WAS.

Today, it's just a relic of what used to be hot in 1970s Vegas.  Oh, sure, they boast of ""upgraded"" rooms on their website.  Really, it's just a change in furniture and new linens.  That would be like your grandma getting a boob job.  Her tits would look like they belonged on a 20 year old, but the rest of her would still be busted.  Old, wrinkled, and hella busted.

So why did I stay here, you ask?  Good question.  I was here for a conference, and the room was pre-paid.  If I could do it all again, I would have stayed at the Bellagio and commuted down the strip everyday.

SInce I could be held legally liable if I make any accusations, I'll simply say that I left a cell phone charger plugged into the wall behind the bedside table and $200 in my wallet hidden in a messenger bag in my suitcase in my locked room at 9:30am and when I came back around 3:30pm the room was cleaned and so was my wallet. Those are the facts. Anyone with some common sense could put two and two together. My charger was also missing. Take that for what you will. The cleaning staff denied anything and were not helpful. They actually threatened to call security because I was upset (to which I responded I should call the cops because I was robbed) but I said get security up here, they should know I've been robbed. Security looked around the room but ultimately did not nothing but had me fill out a ""report,"" and of course I've heard nothing from them since.

As a COURTESY, we were not charged for leaving our hotel early, because I obviously I did not want to stay in a hotel, let alone the room, where I was robbed. Of course, I had already paid the price for staying with them and then some, but that was of no concern to them.

I'm fully aware that one should not leave valuables in the room, but its not like I left this sitting out in the open. ""Whoever"" took it, clearly went through my stuff to find it. Either way, the hotel took no responsibility whatsoever and was anything but apologetic. Whether it was hotel staff, another guest with secret agent skills and a master key, or a magic unicorn that stole my money and iPhone charger, this hotel is clearly not a secure place to stay. It ruined my entire experience in Las Vegas.

2250551,2012-09-08,3,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"The Riviera knows that I love it for its Indian food (in the food court yet some of the best in town), its Pinball Museum annex, the chocolate honeycomb toffee in its gift shop (one of only two places in town I know of that sells it), and the fact that it's one of the last standing in the vintage Strip casino set (and one of the least changed).

So, when I say its sign-up-for-slot-club freebie is weak (my husband and I each got a dollar in free slot play - ONE dollar), its parking garage is dirty, its ""pub"" is only authentic if compared to the most subpar of British holidays, its casino floor is smokier than most, and its location is - thanks to the economy - absolutely inconvenient to popular attractions (not even the discount show ticket booth is still there) and to all other casinos except for Circus Circus (or the Stratosphere or former Hilton, now with the stupid name, provided the sun hasn't gone down yet), you know I'm not just trying to poop on the place.

I would love to see the Riviera thrive, so I kind of question whether I should write this review, but I've also had visiting relatives with certain expectations put the Riviera on their short list, not realizing that it couldn't deliver, and I feel like I need to say something to prevent that from happening to others.

Look, tourist reading this, you SHOULD go to the Riviera. To visit. Not to make your home base. I admit that I've never seen their rooms, which might be amazing. According to the their website, they have some that are pet friendly, and I don't think that's very common. But unless you are really going to get a lot of use out of what the Riviera itself offers, there are better locations with more amenities for around the same price.

But if you have a dog and love Indian food and comedy shows or are dying to see the eight tushes of Crazy Girls in person, and you are just going to be in town for the one night, why not? Go classic. Go to the Riviera. It's safe and nice enough.

For everyone else, like I said, you should visit. Nick Papagiorgio played here! (And plenty of actual famous people, too.) There's the Indian and the pinball and the honeycomb, like I said. The casino isn't so smoky that you can't hang out for awhile (and I'm quite sneezy around smoke). Think of it like a museum that is fully interactive. Do you wish you could have visited the Thunderbird? The Frontier? The Sahara (pre-NASCAR)? Do you wish you could've saved The Stardust from becoming the half-finished parking garage monstrosity that stands on the ashes of the glory days? 

Well, go to the Riviera NOW! NOW! When the economy does turn around, as economies eventually do, the Riviera will be there to see it and, then who knows what its future may bring? This town is always changing, and won't you be glad to say you knew the Riviera when it was hanging tough where others had fallen?

Besides, even if you don't like Indian, you're just a matter of steps away from the Peppermill next door, which is like a Denny's, if Denny's had brilliant food and a really fun cocktail lounge (note that I didn't say soulless ultralounge).

When my friend booked the casino and told me where we were staying I had the immediate notion we where going to be saying somewhere my grandmother stayed when she first visited Las Vegas in 1965 and I was right. The decor was something our the original Ocean's Eleven (it was shot there I think). 

Our room was pretty standard. Nice bed, flat screen TV, SMALL fridge that could hold all of our ridiculously large bottles of liquor, a couch and desk. Needless to say, it wasn't anything to rave about.

The buffet, which I visited only once with my friend was pretty bland, not to mention they had an omelet bar display all over the buffet room but once we got to the bar to get an omelet a kitchen hand told us ""No omelets"", we asked him why and he replied once more ""No omelets"". We weren't getting anywhere fast so we just picked through the questionable selection of food. Soggy sausage patties, powdered hard eggs and flimsy, paper thin bacon. The only saving grace was the waffles. 

After immediate regretting that decision we headed to the strip. Note that this hotel is ALL the way north of the strip and walking is a mission to get 
the central strip or the south end.

After returning from a day long strip walk, we return and everyone needed a shower before the night began. We order some extra towels and didn't receive any until an HOUR later. We call the front desk requesting them again and they rudely tell that we called already, they are on their way and hang up.

There is a reason why The Riviera is still standing and that is because it got a reprive from the economic downturn we are currently experiencing, The same economic downturn that forced the halt of construction of the Echelon across the street from The Riviera and the massive Fountainbleu right beside it to the north as well as the closure of The Sahara right up the road. 

Had any of these construction projects gone forward to completion it would have been The DEATH NAIL for this hotel that is living on borrowed time. As it is, the only thing that has people staying there is its ""$25 a night rooms"" and as you might imagine, this draws in every type of undesirable element that you could ever imagine.

Lets start out driving North on LV Blvd in an attempt to check in to the Riviera. Its 6pm on a weekday and as we slow down in our approach to the Hotel there is a sign indicating ""Check in"" and a ramp leading down. Here we meet a old bald overweight Security Guard who is walking as if he has a load in his pants and he is none to pleased to see us. This person should be running a Prison instead of a Hotel, only time has passed him by as well and he;s probably lucky to have even this job. He surely informs us that this area is closed and the check in is around the back. (Why have a sign on the Strip indicating that this is the check in then?!) So we wind our way through and around this mammoth underground area and come up a ramp that brings us to a road with another entrance that appears to be the Check in area.

As we attempt to park here we are approached by a large Security Guard on a bike dressed in yellow & black and he too is in no good mood and informs us if we park here we will be towed. I ask him where the check in is and he points towards the road and rides off on his bike that is somehow holding up his massive weight. You would think that a Hotel that is on its last leg would at least try and have some kind of ""Customer Service Awareness"" or signs indicating where the Check in area is at....you'd think right?

So I get back in the car and we drive towards the area the chap on the bike pointed and we come to a curve with 2 tunnels in front of us both indicating one way traffic and NOT our way! We go forward as this is our only option and drive around a parking garage and finally come out on a road where we finally see buses & cabs and the likes and we move towards this area and get out and ask if this is the check in. Again we are met with more hostility being told by a ""Bellman"" that we cannot park our car here and that we need to find a parking spot and then check in. He does offer to take our bags though.

Now we are faced with finding parking. Good Luck with THAT!! We drive around the first garage we come to and go all the way to the top finding no available spaces. Now instead of us wasting our time and gas, wouldnt it be appropriate to have a sign indicating that the garage is FULL? I guess that would be to modern of a concept for this 50's era hotel. So we drive off further and further away from the check in area to find parking in a lot with buses, semi-trucks with trailers and we park there. As we get out we are approached by some derelict that has seen better days who asks us for some change. I guess this is Parking Lot Reception?

Finally we get to the Front Desk and there is a winding line of 120 people (I counted them = 120!!) all waiting to check in to the hotel and at the desk there are 2 clerks slowly making there way here and there with papers in thier hands checking people in. I walked to the front of the line and asked a group how long they had been waiting and was told 1 1/2 hour. Are you kidding me? I guess EXPRESS CHECK IN is a concept the management running this place further into the ground has never heard of?

We left and checked in to the Marriot on Convention Center Drive where we did not have a reservation and the entire process of parking, checking in and getting to our room took less than 20 minutes. After reading some of the comments here I'm glad we did. I guess if you like living in the past The Riviera is for you. My advice is to have ALOT of time on your hands, prepare to be treated like a prisoner, have some extra change for the derelicts wandering around and get there soon because THIS PLACE IS ON ITS VERY LAST LEG.....My better advice is DONT......You have been warned.",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,2,2,1,mHsNPT_BO6EzKunZnZf6FQ

The staff was decent didn't have a good not bad experience. The slots did me good, I won $90 within a half an hour on the slots do that's cool with me. It's fairly close to a lot of food joints and little shops and not that far from old town Vegas. The crowd was a mixture of people so that was cool too. The pools were drained that is the only real negative I guess. Anyway, I would drop by if I was ballin' on a budget.",BNo6egtsXrYdmNXLzLZPjQ,10,9,3,Vm2soiG_TpflwSyBm6KWFA

I thought it would be a pile of rubble sometime in the near future and after staying there, as nostalgic as I am sometimes, yeah, I'd say blow it up. It's done.

Ordered a non-smoking room with a king size bed. When I checked in I was told the tower I was in was all smoking but it did have a king size bed. Fine okay, I'll deal. I get to the room. TWO QUEENS!! I call the front desk and after being on HOLD FOR 15 MINUTES I gave up. 

The pool is still the same only the hotel has converted every other floor level room into a cheesy ghetto cabana. Wow, it looked desperate.

My hairdryer in the room didn't work because the outlet was shorted out. The outlet was shorted out because someone had broken off a ground plug in the switch and left a jagged piece of metal sticking out which I cut myself on reaching to turn on the light for the first time.

Would be 1 star if not for the casino
Went here for my girlfriend and friend's 21st birthday vacation
First the pros
1. If you like to gamble for cheap there is a 1$ blackjack table
2. Food from the pub was great had dueling pianos they were great and funny one of the best places in Vegas because it wasn't busy and noisy as a lot of restaurants the food isn't the best selection but that's understandable because it's a pub
3.had extreme problems with valet but it wasn't their fault it was my fault but the person who help me was extremely kind and help ful
4. There is security at the front of the elevators so no one can come in from downstairs.
5. Rooms were quiet 
Now the cons
1. WE found COCKROACHES in the room and called about it to front desk they just transfered me to house keeping and said they would do something about it the following day but they didn't even show up and didnt even apologize and we were in their luxury rooms.
2 . COCKROACHES
3.15 $ resort fee which circus circus charges 10$
4. Pool wasn't the best no Jacuzzi

would I stay here again no cause of the COCKROACHES",dDLAKkLLTLD9wATsXTdPPA,0,0,2,L8JU0rULoO-c9EPhbVHlhA

So, I took a chance and booked mine through the Rivieras web site. Come out to be right around 400.00 for 4 nights ( 2 of which were weekdays).
I can tell you this place was a seedy, ghetto, trashy, dirty, smelly, place. The staff was very rude and unfriendly. When we tried to call the front desk, they would not answer which really put us in a predicament.  The front desk was at least 1/4 mile from the room and the car was twice as far (no kidding!) The walls are paper thin, the carpet is absolutely gross. Water stains and others on walls and ceilings, the beds were (2) doubles which is not much bigger than a single, they were so uncomfortable I felt like I was sleeping at a lumpy angle, my head tilted down towards the head board. I woke up several times to a neck and back ache, the noise, the bright lights from the outside felt like the sun was always out. The casino was just as raunchy. My sister bought a draft beer which cost $7.75.
The bathrooms had no vent at all, it was nasty as everything else. We were too far for the free wi fi it never worked the entire time. I can not think of one positive thing to say about this place.  The tv partially worked but not great.
No freebies, no continental breakfast, the coffee was 2.80 per small cup. etc, etc.

Lines were to long for meals. We ate across the street at McDonald's for breakfast since lines were 30 minutes plus at the casino.

2619183,2014-09-17,0,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"Okay, so update on my Riviera saga. I want to say, everyone on the staff here that I have spoken with has been polite and understanding.

First off, posting this from my smart phone because the Internet does not work. Sometimes I can find the wireless signal and connect to the router but no internet. Others are having the same issue yet operator says everything should be fine and she will have someone look into it. I check into the room, can't wait to shower and get changed into some fresh clothes. I notice as I grab the bath mat that it is noticeably damp, almost wet. That to me was suspect so of course didn't feel like using the towels either. As if to further convince me, I see that the old soap from the previous guest is still sitting in a dried up mess of soap slop on the side of the tub. Classy.

Okay, so all that said, the room was in good overall condition but the sliding closet doors, no doubt left over from the 50's were really ratty and rickety. The A/C, also probably from the 50's was on and was blowing cool air but it wasn't keeping the room cool.

I spoke with a maintenance person who told me they have been through 3 different management companies in a very short time. What that means exactly I'm not sure but is no doubt indicitive of there being issues.

I have reminded myself though to keep this all in perspective, the reason I booked here was the price. Room cost plus resort fee is still really reasonable. Should I expect more? Am I being too picky? Maybe a little but I have stayed at many other properties in Vegas and at similar rates and had a better experience.

Not sure if there is a separate section for their steak restaurant or not but will post my experience here. Again, everyone was great as far as personality and service. Marsha the hostess introduced herself and even shook my hand. Adrian my server checked in with me often and kept up with everything as did Hector. I ordered the Prime Rib. It was the worst piece of meat I have ever had. To be clear, it was cooked the way I asked for it but the quality was so poor. It was really chewy, really tough, not enjoyable at all. The sides, mashed potatoes and green beans were great. Prices, if it had been a nice piece of meat, great.

So on sunday we waited in line for about an hour. We were exhausted from our 4 hour drive from cali. Service was sooo slow. After we checked in, everything was fine but on monday they apparently had a systems failure. The front desk told everyone to come back by 4pm and everything will be fixed. We came back by 4pm, and nothing was done. There was actually a very long line of very angry customers at this point. So everyone in my party just had to cram all their belongings into the one room. We went out, came back exhausted, waited about 40 minutes in line and then finally checked in around 10pm. What a nightmare. 
The following night, my husband and i got back to the room late. Had to be around 2am. He was famished so he called up room service. Room service connected him to the burger joint in the food court. They told him they were closed. So he asked if any of the other restaurant were opened. They forwarded him back to the room service (which im assuming is front desk) and they connected him again to the same people that just told him no. Except this time, they made it sound like someone was opened, until they forwarded him to this other restaurant that never picked up. It kept ringing and the same food coourt people picked up. Seriously?? They are all in the same area.. they couldnt just step out from behind their counter to see who was opened or not? Every time he was reconnected with the food court guy he was given hope that something was available. After about 15 minutes of this fiasco, my husband just hung up. I looked on that little room service pamphlet thing thats next to the phone and it loooked like it all said they were closed by that hour. (I know we should have probably looked at that first but hunger makes you stupid sometimes) why couldnt these customer service reps and food court people just have said that to begin with?
Then it was time to check out of the rooms. I noticed the checkin/checkout kiosk was working so i decided to go with that to beat the long line. It was simple enough, but then when it printed out the receipt it came out blank. I had to get back in line just to make sure everything was in order. Ridiculous!

Pros: decent rooms, decent location, cheap.
Cons: incredibly unorganized, slow front desk service, lack of knowledge regarding room service, terrible food in food court

One more thing! The things included in the resort fee are completely useless unless youre going to utilize the swimming pool (but who wants to pay $15 to play in some chemically filled, dirty old pool? Couldnt even use the wifi.. signal wasnt strong enough..

I wasn't expecting much and that's exactly what I got. The casino floor feels like a library. There are maybe about ten people on the whole floor. 

The room surprised me though. I'm pretty sure the room hasn't been renovated since it was built but they did change two things. The beds are plush and comfortable and there is a flat screen TV. The two things that a man needs to be happy. Plus it didn't stink unlike some other lower quality places on the strip (ahem....Imperial Palace....ahem)

Oh and c) because its one of the few hotels left with mob history that I find so fascinating.
I was a little concerned before checking in due to some of the negative reviews I had been reading. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. I had a great time at this hotel. Everything was fine. Check in was quick. I received a remodeled room at no extra charge, which was quite nice. The staff was helpful. The location was okay. It's a little far from the main part of the strip but for the money it cant be beat. 
Now I am not one to prefer top-notch accommodations. I am more comfortable with a beer and a jukebox than a $20 drink and loud techno/top 40 music. If you prefer the latter you probably will not be happy with this hotel. 
I'd recommend this hotel for people who would rather have money to spend on food and booze than a fancy hotel room that you will probably not spend any time in. 
It's also right beside Peppermills, which is a 24 hour restaurant with a kitschy lounge that screams old tacky Vegas =) And slots-a-fun is right across the street where you cant go wrong with their $1.25 daiquiris and cheap beer specials.

The room was on average 27 dollars a night, which is a steal for summer in Vegas. The ratings weren't too stellar but we gave it the benefit of the doubt. So we arrived and we were given a room with two beds even though we booked a room with a king sized bed.  We literally had to beg them to give us the room that we asked for. They stated that even though we paid for our room ahead of time, they booked all the rooms with a king sized bed because they are booked on a first come, first served basis. They asked us to come back the next day, stand in line and compete for the room that we booked originally. They must be trippin'!

That seemed a  little unethical to me  for the hotel to take our money but give us a room that we did not request. It made me regret booking my hotel accommodations at the Riviera!

The staff was always friendly both at the 3am check in and during the morning rush to check out.  While the building is old,  the rate is fairly reasonable and the rooms are decent.

Like another reviewer said already, the place is just downright SEEDY.

There's trash here and there on the floors in the public areas, the whole place is a relic from the 60s and 70s, complete with photos of Dean Martin and that scene from an era when, gee, people seemed to dress up, even in black tie.  Ha, you're lucky if they wear a shirt now.

The lines are laughable at the front desk.  Any time of day or night too! Wee hours of the morning -- wanna check out? Ha, be prepared for a long wait just to check out (easier to just walk out, never look back).  Arriving at 5pm some evening? Ha, be prepared to spend an hour just waiting to REGISTER in the hotel!  The self-serve registration/checkout kiosk machines are usually BROKEN.  

When I was there, one of the hotel elevators was broken, door open at lobby level, all buttons for all floors lit inside; all day people would stream in, discover the problem, and walk out annoyed.  Did the hotel do anything? Hell no.  Not for the first 12 hours anyway.

The hotel room was OK.  Except for the lights and the noise.  Noise from a) the fricking pool right outside the window (they put me on level 46, meaning 6th floor) and b) the noise from the drunken guests, pretty bad until about midnight-1am.  And the lights from the pool area, and huge floodlights aimed at the tower and right under my window, kept the place nice and bright at night.

Oh man, this place is such a dive. I will never, ever go back there.  I detest Vegas. The whole place oughta be nuked from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.",BW1mypPgrLxzgicL8Dx2ww,3,2,1,zZBGmzQsjZ_cuVaPN7vaYA

Obviously, this place is way past it's prime, but you get what you pay for; so if you're willing to shell out $450-$550 a night, you can stay at the Bellagio or Venetian & be amongst the *happy* reviewers who *just adored* their fancy hotel & therefore, gave it 5 shining stars. But, if you are booking last minute (like we did) or aren't ballin' outta control, you're gonna have to settle for the Riviera & all its shortcomings, including some ghetto clientele & no aesthetically pleasing place to rest your eyes.

my daughter is allergic to my cats so when she comes into town, i put her up at nice hotels.  on her last day in town, she checked out of her hotel, and we spent the day at the breathtaking Valley of Fire, hiking in 100 degree weather.  needless to say, we were exhausted when i drove her back to her car in the hotel's parking lot.  i didn't want her driving at night when she was so tired, and went on the internet to quickly find some place for her to stay at the last minute that wouldn't stretch my already overspent budget for her stay in vegas..

the riviera came up and the price was very cheap.  i made an online reservation and we drove there.

the valet was very nice and when he saw i was on portable oxygen, he said he would park the car close by so i wouldn't have to wait long when i finished checking her in.  that was pretty nice!

we went to the lobby and we were both impressed by the huge chandelier in the lobby.  very pretty.  there was a VERY loooong line to check in, so i thought this place must be great, to be so crowded!  my daughter stood in line with me for a while, but she was so tired, i told her to go sit down on the couch and she did.  i had left my oxygen in the car, thinking i would be right back out.  bad idea.  i was in line for over an hour, exhausted, watching my daughter practically falling asleep on the couch.

after an hour, i finally got up to the desk.  the check in lady was actually very sweet and very personable and helpful.  i asked her to please give my daughter a view of the strip and she said no problem.

we got the room key and made our way to the room.  it seemed like forever to walk down hallway after hallway, get to the elevator, and get up to her floor and into her room.  

i was not very happy with the room.  it looked outdated and i wasn't  too sure about the cleanliness because the lamp was pretty dim, but the bathroom light was bright and it looked clean.  i went to the window and looked out, and the ""strip view"" i requested was a joke.  there were plenty of rooms that would have offered a REAL strip view and i would have gladly paid more for that if given the choice.  but i wasn't about to go downstairs and wait another hour so i was going to call the front desk when my daughter said not to worry about it.

there were excellent drink specials in the bar which was really great.  i mean really really inexpensive, surprising for being on the strip.  however she really wanted to use the pool to relax before going to bed but it was closed.  it was only about  9 pm.  i was really surprised they closed the pool so early.  so much for getting any of the 'resort"" that we paid a ""resort fee"" for.

my daughter said she slept well and the bed was OK.  after hiking all day in 100 degree temps, i think any bed would have felt good!

but as i said, you get what you pay for.  it was one of the cheapest rooms in the city that night, and it kept my daughter from having to drive when she was too tired to drive, so it suited its purpose.  when i got back to the valet stand about an hour and a half later, the valet was true to his word, remembered my first name and his promise, and got my car to me extremely fast.",dq4MLIMiPDzfEuhxJ72U7A,0,0,2,i4t9TKJqj6GKH5V36Lv96w

The Riviera however has to compete with all the other Mega Resorts in Vegas. Well if you really want a huge casino with 1000's of people the The Mirage, Ceasars, and Mandalay Bay are for you, but I really enjoyed the exceptional service throughout the property, and with out the mayhem I experience walking throuh a few of these other places this week.

Last time we did this we ended up at Treasure Island on a weekend night for $60 out the door.  She was up to $75 when it booked us for this 1-star turd.   We had stayed the previous night at a station casino (Aliunte) and that was a modest 2-3 star place.  When we entered the old run down parking garage of the Riviera I knew we were doomed.   

We checked in and no one around us was speaking english, this is when I knew we were in for it.  The lobby was dirty and old.  I understand this hotel is a ""Vegas Classic"" but they could at least update the carpets and paint every 20-30 years just so it doesn't feel as dirty.   

We tried to call Priceline to cancel or at least change the hotel, they were willing but the Riviera refused to cancel our reservation on Priceline's end.  We were stuck and after taxes and fees it was just short of $100 for the night.  What made me even more furious was after getting to our room I started checking on rates and the average online booking was modestly $30-40 on average per night...  

The room was old, smelly, and noisy as all hell.  You could hear cell phones ringing in the rooms around you, TV's blaring, people taking a wiz repeatedly all through the night.  The bed was as hard as a rock.  Between the bed and the noise I got about 15 minutes of sleep total the entire night.

So I felt like I should gamble ONLY because I wanted some of my damn room money back.  HUGE mistake.  The slots were tighter then Zeus's butthole.  I put nearly $200 into a vast array of machines and never even went into the ""black""  I was so disappointed in this place I will forever forsake it and warn all my friends and family to STAY the hell AWAY from the Riviera.  From the overpriced ($20) brunch buffet to the dirty rooms and dirty casino this hotel is only for those who just didn't know any better.  Avoid this disaster at all costs I implore you!

----- Quick Update -----

Got home from our trip and found the Riviera Hotel had charged us $130 as well as the priceline prepaid reservation.

At check in we were never told of any additional fees associated with the room.  We did a ""name your own price"" on priceline.  She told me that every guest no matter how they book is charged a ""resort fee.""  The woman was extremely rude even though I was not, even post - Riviera the treatment and experience is awful.   Now I'm working with the bank to cancel the $130 charge and with priceline to find out who should be paying this so called ""resort fee.""

I had arrived a little after midnight, and unfortunately, there was a line to check-in. I'd waited about 30mins. to check-in, and thankfully I had made reservations because the process only took less than 5 mins and the front desk agent was very pleasant. 

After scoping the room (which was nothing to brag about; I was just happy to have a CLEAN bed to sleep on), I decided to head to the lobby to see what's happenin'.

I recall walking past a bar or two that had obnoxious occupants(which, after a long day, was something I was trying to avoid), so I kept walking. Eventually I landed at the ""main casino bar"". The bartender had spotted me from 20ft away, greeted me with a welcoming smile, and I made my way towards that bar. 

I ordered a simple gin&tonic...and had simple conversation with the bartender. Turns out, he'd been there for over 20 years and could give me the scoop about the place. I'd asked him a few questions, to which he'd knowledgeably responded -- keeping me entertained whilst drinking $2 beverages. Yes. $2. For an 8 oz. Gin&tonic. 

Suffice it to say, I remained at the bar for longer than planned....HOWEVER, my all around experience was decent enough to provoke me to return to that bar in particular. 

I returned to my room, which admittedly leaves a blank after such an experience at the bar...but I do recall having an undisturbed night's sleep.
 Checking out was a bit of a hassle, as there'd been another huge line waiting to check in.....THANKFULLY they had they key drop-off boxes to the right of the reservation desk on the way out.

I should mention, first, that we were warned about booking a room at the hotel. Several people affiliated with the conference warned they, their family members, or friends had gotten bed bugs while staying at the Riviera. Because the conference we were in Vegas to attend was being held there, my colleague and I decided to press our luck and stay there for convenience.

I've decided to write a simple account of my experience in chronological order. 

1) When I went to check in, I attempted to redeem a voucher for a free room upgrade. Surprise! The room was already booked and they had only rooms left with king-sized beds. No offense fo my colleague, but we preferred to have our own beds. Sounded like the Twitter deal was a scam. The real offense? The check-in clerk was incredibly rude. I was astounded. 

2) We got bedbugs. Yep. It happened. I have pictures. When we brought this to the front desk's attention a manager came out, hurried us into a corner, told us security would meet us up at the room to investigate. We protested, he insisted. We went up to the room where a security officer met us. He took pictures of the bites, wrote something down and keyed up his radio, ""Code green, that's a positive."" I rolled my eyes. He took his flashlight and peered under the top cover. ""I don't see any bedbugs."" 

Bedbugs infest the corners of mattresses. They get in the little seams. They crawl on the top of picture frames. Alongside the corners of the carpet. I couldn't believe it. We protested and he called his supervisor. 

This huge guy came into the room and we explained how impossible it was to conclude there were no bedbugs after such a cursory check. We said we didn't want to pay for the room. He said that the management would take care of everything and escorted us back to the manager. 

The manager told us there was nothing he could do except change our rooms. He told us security have their procedures and are trained (to be useless, for sure). We protested. He gave us a card and said loss prevention would contact us in 7-10 days. That was on the 14th of March. Today is March 29th; I've heard nothing. We told him the security guy said management would take care of us. He said there was nothing he could do. As a result of their incompetence, we missed dinner with our colleagues. They did give us, after my roommate got upset, a voucher for dinner. 

3) When we went to check out, we asked right away to speak with a manager. A different manager than the previous night appeared, and when we said we got bedbugs she hurried us away from the other folks checking out. We told her we didn't want to pay for the room. She said there was nothing she could do--loss prevention would contact us. We said she was the manager--she could do anything she wanted. I said, ""I've read many reviews on various travel sites that have claimed loss prevention never contacts them after they get bed bugs."" She got upset and said, ""Why would you go and read those sites!"" I laughed and said, I'm happy to show the folks in line my bites. Then she called security. 

4) Security came and mocked us and threatened us. We said we were here with the teacher's conference, and one guard got angry and said angrily, ""What kind of teachers do you think you are?"" They circled us as my roommate continued talking to the manager. I told them to get out of my personal space and asked folks who were checking out to witness their hostility. They got in my face and I started taking pictures. I have several. I started tweeting everything. That's when they backed off and left. 

Now, you can make your own decision to stay here. My roommate and I have not yet been contacted by the hotel about getting bed bugs. 

The managers at this hotel had total control over our experience as guests, and they chose not to compensate us adequately, the hotel security insulted and threatened us, and there has been no follow up.

When we arrived, the check-in line went around to almost the door and took about 30-45 minutes. They couldn't hire some more people for the sake of providing good customer service? When we finally got to the front, the lady that checked us in had her purse in hand and rushed to get us out so that she could leave. 
Riviera has a ""best rate guarantee"" that states that if you find a better rate anywhere else online, they'll match it and give you a complimentary room upgrade. When we brought this up, she said that we never mentioned this when we made our reservation (even though we did over and over and over again). Finally, I asked to speak to a manager and had to tell them that a friend of mine checked in earlier that day with the same deal and got her room upgrade. Like a previous reviewer said, these people finally gave in and said, ""We don't normally do this, but we'll give it to you."" You don't normally do this? Really? Then why is there an entire special section for it on your website? I hate incompentence. 
In her hurry to get off her shift, she failed to give us room keys. When we pointed that out, she rudely said, ""No, I gave it to you. You must have put it somewhere."" Umm...no we didn't...we've been standing here the whole time and never once reached into our pockets or purse/wallet. In a huff, she gave us ""another"" set of keys but didn't even bother to activate them. This ended up leaving me sitting on the floor by our hotel room while the hubs went downstairs again to get it activated.
We had a room on the Monaco Tower, and it was alright. I guess it matched the pricetag. I mean, nothing was dirty or disgusting, but you could tell that it was older. If this was their ""upgrade"" then I'd hate to see the room that we would've gotten. 

Other things that added to the bad stay:
-A friend of mine who failed to mention the best rate guarantee/room upgrade didn't get a comforter because they ran out. They gave her a gross, uncomfy wool blanket instead. At least we got a comforter I suppose... 
-Riviera's website advertises $50 of free slot play if you book with them and join their Players Club. I did this, and was given the run around (literally). I was sent back and forth between the front desk and the players club 3 times to try to get my free slot play. Nothing. I had lost about 45 minutes doing this, so I just gave up out of frustration.
-The in-a-hurry check-in lady never gave us a sheet of coupons that they're supposed to give everyone at check-in. We found out about this much later on. Turns out we could've actually used a few of the coupons for poker tournament buy-ins and food. Gah too late.
-Another friend of mine couldn't find her ""do not disturb"" sign, and they wouldn't give her another one. End result: being woken up by the cleaning ladies every morning at 10 or 11am...which wouldn't be a huge deal if you didn't go to bed around 7am every night/morning. 

Next time I'm in Vegas, I will never go close to this place- unless maybe if I'm craving Indian food in the middle of the night :P
Sure, you save some money on the hotel room itself, but it comes out to be pretty much the same when you consider the hundreds of dollars in cab and limo fees to get from the Riviera to the center of the strip (where we spent a lot of our time) and back for the days that you're there.",7-bGErnDfMVPe1VYH04yqQ,6,1,2,3ZCSXdJUO6f8zQW-_fpD6w

I don't think anything I will state in this review will be news.  Their check-in process needs major workflow evaluation.  We got there at 7:30pm and it took almost 45 minutes to get to the desk.  That's ridiculous and I can only imagine what it would have been at 4pm.
The front desk clerk immediately informed me that the king bed we requested wasn't available, but we could upgrade to a luxury room. No sorry, no concern, just... an upsell.  I informed her that we would stick with what was given to us, but she quickly informs us that once we get into the room and decide we want to upgrade to a ""luxury"" room, go back down and let her know and she would change our rooms.  As we went to the Mediterranean Tower, we noticed that the hallways were dimly lit, the carpets were stained, and there was a musty smell.  This was indicative of what we found inside as well.  The room was VERY dated, the air conditioning was sputtering, and state of the furnishings were sad.  We immediately picked up the phone to inform the front desk that we would like to upgrade.  The man who picked up flat out denied our request for an upgrade.  Mind you, we said we were willing to pay for the upgrade, we weren't looking for a handout.  The man stated that since we step foot into the room, he would have to have it cleaned and he didn't have the staffing for that.  We explained that the front desk clerk who checked us in offered to have us examine the room first.  He states that she wasn't allowed to do that and he will not upgrade us.  We asked to speak with a manager and he states that he WAS the hotel manager.  If this was indeed the case, this is the worst customer service I've encountered.  What hotel would refuse a customer PAYING for an upgrade?  He then states that he can send a maid up to tidy up the room if we were unhappy... but weren't we just informed that he didn't have the staff for that?  So the maid he was going to send up wouldn't be the same one who can clean the room we had ""soiled"" by just stepping in?  Things didn't add up.
Anyhow, the room was in shambles, as you can see from the pictures I'll post.  Mold in the shower, peeling wallpaper, soiled/ripped linens, the list goes on and on.  We didn't expect a 5 star hotel, but the dilapidated room PLUS the ridiculous management really soured our stay.

It's hard to believe that the Riv was once Dean Martin's home turf - what the hell happened?

This whole end of the Strip is extremely depressing: meth heads lurking about, various other shady characters (think People of Wal-Mart parts 1,2, and 4!) and this was during the day, my friends. 

My friend's grandmother used to stay here all the time; she's been comped rooms here since the 70's, which was probably the last time the ash trays were emptied. I made a quick trip up here, just for nostalgia sake, and beat a path for the door as soon as I got a Bloody Mary in hand.  The bartender was very friendly and the drink strong (reason for the extra star). There's a lingering sadness about the place, one of better days, like taking a trip to Versailles.

2911374,2014-02-27,11,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"I recently spent two days at the Riviera while I was having some work done at the house. Since I work graves, I just wanted a place that was cheap and where I could get some sleep for the nights shift.

I was able to get a room at the Riv for only $24 a night plus a $15 per night resort fee. So for under $40 a night, I figured it might be a good spot for this purpose. 

Okay, first off (spoiler alert ) I am giving it 4 stars. Not necessarily because it is a 4 star property (once again, spoiler alert..it is not), but because of the value you get from the price you pay. For $40 a night, with a clean and renovated room on the strip, you definitely get your moneys worth here! And although it is not the best place on the strip, it also isn't the worst (Quad/IP, Circus Circus, and Hooters can compete for that ""honor"").

A few random notes from my experience here-

-when I booked the reservation, I was told I could check in early at 10am for an additional $10 fee. Not bad I'm thinking...but when I got to the desk to check in I was told it was more like $20 and change. Huh? Luckily, the manager waived the fee and made me happy in the process...but I'm still not 100% sure what the actual fee is..

-I would definitely pay the upgrade fee to stay in the Monacco Tower. I was told it's roughly $20 per day. Those are the most recently renovated room and are actually quite nice and good size for a $40 room. Plus you get a view of the pool...for what that is worth to you..The lady who checked me in was very friendly and engaging. I couldn't see her name badge since her long hair was covering it. I asked about the Monacco Tower rooms and upgrade fee...oh and around this time I tipped her $10 for getting the early check in fee waived for me and , what do ya know?, she was able to upgrade me to a room in that tower for free as well..Awesome!..After explaining why I was there, she got me a very quiet room at the end of the hallway and it worked out great! 

- I decided to play tourist a little bit and do a bit of gambling, not much luck there...Didn't even seem to get much play either. No bueno..oh well..guess I'd better keep that job

-They do have cheap drink specials at the main casino bar...$1 drafts...choice of Miller Lite or PBR

-They have an ABC store on site as well offering ""bend you over, Mr. Tourist"" pricing

-Seems when you sign up at the cage for a players card, you do recieve a free Riviera T-shirt'

- Most employees I encountered were very friendly...although it kind of struck me as odd at how ""robotic"" the lady was who checked me out...but I don't believe she was intentionally rude...

-This place does have some old school charm to it with the brass, chandeliers, and classic signage strewn about the property..I actually liked that..

-location is not the greatest...really only Circus Circus and Wynn/Encore are in reasonable walking distance...

I was very satisfied with my brief stay here, and if the need arises again, I may stay here again in the future..for the right price.

Cons:
1. Horrible Customer Service from front desk and Hotel Manager and house keeping. It's a do not care attitude. Perhaps they will be closing soon and know they are short timer. Once you check-in you can not get ahold of them via telephone. We had a employee tell us they need a dedicated person to just answer hotel guests and for them.
2. 35 minute check in time. 
3. Can't use luggage racks to roll to your room.
4. The room had holes next to the toliet, mold on the shower ceiling, cabinet was broken. Took 4 hours to get toliet paper from house keeping after four calls to house keeping. We had a newer remodeled room that looks like that just put a bandaid on it to seem like they redid it completely. Major painting and updating still needs to be done on the rooms. Sheets don't fit the bed size, so you spend the whole nite trying to keep the sheets on.
5. Hotel did not disclose check in charges or preauthorizations at checkin in dollar amounts - so you never know what they charge your credit card and they seem to think its some big mystery and don't know either. 
6. Food court area smells horrible and the food for most part looks that way also. I would never eat there just due to the smell. 
7. Car elevator made you feel like your in the twlight zone and only one was working on checkout. 
8. Casino floor is laid out very odd and we felt it had no clear layout or direction in mind. Floor is uneven at some places.  Buffet did not look good at all. Checkin area was moved without informing us when we booked the room.
9.  We got a laugh looking at all the strange people - kind like ""these are the people of Walliemart music video/website"". 
10. We went to the V. Williams concert inside a flat convention center. The seats were so horrible to sit in that I still have back pain from them. Not to mention some handicap person in wheelchair higher than the seats  was sitting right in front of us and we could not see the concert very well. Not to mention every minute someone was walking down the aisle way. Then we had gabby people next to us the whole time and getting drinks every 5 minutes. The concert was half full by mid-way and the band mentioned how old the hotel looked to them - which we felt was quite funny. 


Pros:
1. Member Services Management did resolve some issues we had and went above and beyond to help me out.
2. Steak House was pretty good to eat and had a good atmosphere.
4. Mcdonald's is close by.
5. Monorail is in walking distance from the hotel.

The hotel is more Pet tolerant then Pet friendly, very small patch of artificial grass gated area for your dog relieve area! Grass and concrete is very hot, water does not work.

The two other couples who sat next to me all agreed this was not the floor plan we choose seats for. All though we didn't know each other, all six of us went to talk to the box office manager together.   
The response to our concerned but polite inquiry? Too bad.

All 6 of us were shocked how callous the box office staff treated us. No apologies and no offers to move us. They told us floor moves happen all the time and we bought our tickets too far in advance and we should have waited. This made no sense to me at all. I planned this night well in advance and I am suffering the consequences for my careful planning? All of us agreed our NYE was ruined. 
I wrote a nice letter to the Director or Entertainment explaining the situation and I never heard a word back.

Yes, the neon display is the best in Vegas, but that doesn't take away from how far it has fallen.

Sure, part of it has to do with The Great Recession and how it has impacted Las Vegas developers in their quest to replace the Stardust, as well as Fontainebleu Las Vegas's complete failure as a hotel-casino. But what I would have done is focused on renovating the hotel to make it the same sort of stand-alone resort where you don't have to leave the property to enjoy all that Vegas has to offer.

I do like the pinball machines and arcade games in front of the casino.

For one of the non-mega casino umbrella properties (i.e. non-Caesars / MGM / etc.), it is one of Vegas longest surviving casinos. For the last 50 years the Riviera graced the north part of the strip with its over the top scintillating star theme, having been in and out of bankruptcy from the very moment it was erected. Personally, I'm surprised that it even lasted this long.

For serious players, gambling here was more about nostalgia than it was about earning the comp dollar. The casino itself was understandably dated and the cheesy factor was evident throughout the property. For what it's worth, it felt more fun to play here than be surrounded by a whole 'nother crowd in Downtown, but at some point the Riviera was practically a senior citizen home.

The rooms were never fancy, even the higher end suites would be trumped by low grade suites of mid tier properties. But with a lesser association, this means getting comps was no big deal. Even from a retail stance, getting a room here for $50 and under during the week was a relatively frequent reality.

I wish I were around the years when Liberace was a headliner here. To go from him to Crazy Girls (a pseudo ""risque"" nudie show) seems like a desperate transition for attention. Following that was a bunch of D list celebrities filling space and time, adding to the charm of being here I suppose.

The days for properties like this are numbered. When the Stardust imploded several years ago, it was a signal that a new wave of mega properties were to hit the Strip. It was only a matter of time before the Riviera followed suit. As of last month, it finally has.

And there is the occasional show that will rock you.  Oh and maybe people watching which is like an Olympic sport in Las Vegas.  Hmmm, maybe there is something to say for it after all.

But then I offer you the Riviera...  My encounter started with reservations.  I'll call my rep ""Ellen"" (this is a fictitious name and should not be confused with a person real or imagined).  Ellen was closer.  Why yes sir, you can have adjoining rooms for your party.  Sir, we have a lovely pool - it is very large.  Rooms have all of the latest amenities - comfortable beds etc.  Got to hand it to Ellen.  Got my money and she was 0 for 3.  After strike 3, the pool is closed for the season, I thought choice words with the management would be in order.  I'm sorry sir she's not available.  Later ... I'm sure she'll return in a bit.  I'm now thinking Ellen and the manager are one and the same person.

3326188,2009-02-19,6,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"When I think of places to stay in Vegas, I rarely think of The Riviera first. I like to stay closer to the center of The Strip. In fact, when I stay anywhere north of the Venetian, I am always afraid that a giant wrecking ball might reduce my room to rubble in the middle of the night. ""Really? $24 rooms? Great deal, I'd like a room with a vi. . . CRUNCH, SMASH, KA-BOOM!"" Frankly, I am surprised The Riviera is still standing. 

I booked a ""package"" through US Airways, which included a round trip flight from/to SFO and 2 nights at this beautiful hotel for $230, all taxes included. Wrecking ball be damned, it's a deal! Sure, I had to rent a car to drive around, but it was still worth it. 

The Riviera is a living, breathing testament to the all-important saying ""don't judge a book by its cover."" From the outside, it looks like a dilapidated, outdated monstrosity. On the inside, it looks like a good value hotel on The Strip. 

I stayed at the Monaco tower, which is the tall tower behind the main hotel. I was very surprised to see that the rooms were newly remodeled. They seemed more modern than rooms in more luxurious hotels. Each room featured an iHome clock radio with an iPod dock and a 42'' flat screen TV. How about that? I kept thinking, am I at the right place? Last time I stayed at The Riviera was 2.5 years ago. Here's the main difference: in 2006, my main concern was ""Will my toilet overflow and flood the room with you-know-what?"" In 2009, my main concern was ""Should I wake up to the Backstreet Boys' best hits or New Kids on the Block most successful album?"" Quite an improvement. 

Now, for the bad part. This goes out to the people who occupied room 6244 on February 14 and February 15. You see, I had the misfortune of staying in room 6242 which is adjacent to room 6244. In fact, our rooms had a door that, if need be, could combine the two rooms into one awkward 2-room suite. The presence of said door made paper-thin walls even less soundproof. 

So . . . thank you, annoying Filipino family, for talking loudly, for yelling at each other until 4 am AND for bringing a screaming toddler to Vegas with you. What was he doing up at 4 am, what was he doing in Vegas and why wasn't he sedated?

Thank you, two loudmouthed twenty-something couples for yelling and describing your clubbing experiences at 4:30 am the next day. Why were you staying in the same room? Shouldn't you have stayed in separate rooms and ... umm ... spend quality time with one another? Good thing you were too drunk to stay awake and make noise for more than 20 minutes. I was going to steal your ""do not disturb"" sign, so that an anxious housekeeper would wake you up at 9 am, but you forgot to hang it on your doorknob in the first place. I guess the joke's still on you. 

Valet parking at The Riviera is awesome. It fills up fast, but if you're a guest, it doesn't matter. They retrieve your car in a matter of seconds, and I still don't understand how they do it. Cabs are harder to come by, and the lines are usually long. If you stay here, designate a driver and rent a car.",Z7PaVxobw44iejw3hR0UoQ,6,6,3,SgAk_02aLsj_mMj1at_J9w

I was expecting old school cool and I mainly only got the ""old"" part right. For about roughly the price I pay for other places, this place should have stepped up to the plate but it failed miserably.

The parking garage was a complete disaster that should be bulldozed. The elevators were down for days...minor annoyance until the rest of the stay... I asked a simple question at check in about upgrade availability as I checked in through the attempt to completely de-personalize the registration & checkout process. The clerk, and every staff member for that matter, was extremely rude and annoyed. I was answered with a curt, ""that room is already an upgrade."" I called back a few more times throughout my stay regarding this, something else I can't recall, and late checkout. The front desk never answered for the rest of my trip. Horrible, horrible service.

I got to the room and it was your typical standard Vegas room. Nothing really that special about it but it wasn't bad other than not honoring any of the requests I had made when placing the reservation nearly 2 months ago (high floor, away from elevators, king bed, etc.) and the really crappy view of something that looked like the ghetto. I called the front desk after finding stray hairs on one of the bed pillows (gross....) and also about the view since I had paid extra for a better room. I received a rude, ""We're completely booked. Try back tomorrow."" wtf I've never received such bad service in Vegas from the hotel I was staying. 

The bathroom was ok but how cheap does a hotel need to be? There wasn't the standard toiletries even provided like lotion, showercap, conditioner, etc. The only thing was shampoo- thank goodness I brought my own with the exception of the lotion which I had to purchase from the ABC store ($4 for a teeny tiny bottle- like the size you should get in your room). Makes me wonder if ABC and the hotel cut a deal- there's not excuse for cheaping out that badly. The toilet looked like it had leaked pretty badly at some point also. My showerhead rocked my world though- it was awesome but I heard this wasn't the case across the board from other people that were traveling with me. The beds were super comfortable and I actually slept like a rock.

Overall I was just disappointed in the options the hotel provided. The food places were mediocre at best (even the Queen's Pub or whatever sucked and the services was horrible). Everyone who worked here seemed angry at the world and the gambling wasn't even fun. 

There are so many other places to stay on the Strip that blow this place out of the water. Yes, it can be cheap but I paid for a slightly better room which came out to about the cost of another hotel that I normally stay at and receive red carpet treatment. I will never stay here again- even if it's the preference for a work function I'll opt for another hotel.

It does look old and it seems like old Vegas, but hey I kind of like that smell.

To my pleasant surprise, this hotel was way better than most of the reviews that I read.  Please do not get me wrong, this is not like staying at the Wynn or Caesars, but for the price and the bed comfort -- you can't go wrong!

The check-in line was a little insane when we arrived, but we were quickly escorted out of the line to the computerized check-in (seriously what a great idea!!!!).  After I swiped the wrong credit card (make sure you swipe the one you book with...oops), they quickly escorted me to the VIP area and had me checked in, in a flash.

The room was decent.  2 double beds (made for fun with 4 people, including 2 tall guys).  Walls were paper thin, which gave us some good laughs... and some annoyance between the hours of 7am-9am when our neighbors, who apparently were not out late any night....loved to slam the door, have their screaming children in the hall, etc. Not impressed by that, but that is not really the hotel's fault. 

The casino itself was fine.  Drink service was lacking (if you are going to play slots and want good drink service I would HIGHLY recommend the Quad -- the drinks were absolutely flying) and we were lucky if we had a beverage every 30 minutes or so.  The other thing that was disappointing about the gambling was that they closed the Craps tables quite early (around 2am) while there were still people playing.  Kind of strange... 

The good about the casino: $1 Blackjack, 24 hours a day.  You will have to wait in line however, but well worth the wait!  

I have never stayed at this end of the strip and I am not totally sure how I felt about it.  I felt like we had to take a cab if we wanted to go to Bally/Caesars/Flamingo etc.  But Slots A Fun and Circus Circus were fun, cheap and had good drink service.

Most of the bad reviews are from people comparing this to the nicer hotels and casinos on the strip.  Not a fair comparison.  It's a great 3-star hotel off the main part of the strip.

Staff:  The staff here are super friendly, from the woman greeting me at the front desk to the guy who unlocked my room safe.
Room:  Clean, nice, modern.  Nothing fancy.  Ask for the Monaco Tower.  Other rooms are apparently older.
Location: Perfect if you're going to CES since it backs onto the LVCC parking lot.  Literally a 6-minute walk from my room to the conference center.  Others on the main strip had to wait for shuttles, pay for cabs, and fight through traffic.  It's also a $6 cab ride to the Wynn or a relatively safe 20 minute walk.
Casino:  Looks lame but that's not part of my review.  Just talking about a cheap, safe, clean, convenient place to stay.

If you're coming to Vegas for CES or anything at the LVCC, the Riviera is perfect.  If you're coming to lounge around at your hotel then you'll probably want to pay the extra $$$ and stay on the main part of the strip.",GbZAC7vIxQnhS1asvfCY4A,7,4,5,iP5_BjqwcKGPLIZdxh8Ftg

I was booked here for a week. I stayed in the Deluxe room in the Monte Carlo Tower. Per day, it was alot cheaper than the Best Western down the street, that my boss and 3 co-workers ended up abandoning after I quote ""Un-Sanitary and Un-Safe"" conditions. I opted for the smoking room, and to my surprise the room was 95% free of any tobacco odor. There was also a mini fridge hidden in the cabinets which was a HUGE plus. 

The deluxe room in the Monte Carlo tower had a very nice shower, and very clean beds. The room size was amazing as well. Much larger than anticipated. The Wifi is FREE and here is the best part of all, I brought my XBOX with me on my trip. The WiFi connected to my XBOX LIVE account with NO SETUP! I was able to enjoy Netflix and video games all week, and it worked great! VERY IMPORTANT!

Also, it is only 1 block from the convention center for you business people!   

You get complimentary tickets to the Comedy Show (reserve your comps early I missed out on mine)  and there is a large beautiful casino downstairs, and a food court which is not the GREATEST but has a pretty good pizza place. If you are looking for good food, the Circus Circus is right across the street, and has a GREAT buffet. 

My only gripe is the parking can be a bit of a pain if you are not careful. Spots to park are kind of all over the place. If you can find a spot close to the entrance more power to you, but still the walk from the furthest parking lot isn't bad. The rooms only flaw was a dead light bulb every now and then. 

CHECK IN TIPS: Reserve your room in advance. Make sure you are fully aware the deposit which is $100 and resort fee of $15 a night. You NEED to stay on top of your reservation. Call 3-4 times if you have to to make sure they have everything in order. I was booked by my boss, so I had to make sure to fax the credit card application for the resort and deposit like 3 times and called 3 times to make sure it was in the system. It gets VERY busy around 3 or so. The machines will only offer 2 bed rooms and limited tower options. So again, make sure you triple verify your reservation before you get there!

We decided to look for something to eat in the food court. It was not the shortest walk from the parking garage to the food court area. If you are walking in from the street (las vegas blvd) then there are doors right on the sidewalk to enter which puts you right into the food court.

This place was filthy. It looks like a yard sale walking through the casino. Suddenly you see a row of pinball machines, then you see a Coinstar machine among various other odd things. It is like they just randomly cluster things around the place.

I had to stop into the bathroom and the toilet area was actually OK but the sinks are another story. There was paper thrown about, and drink cups everywhere.

When I saw the food court I was excited to see the options. I do know it is a food court and wasn't expecting anything spectacularly amazing, just something that tasted yummy! We noticed a Cheese steak place,  Mediterranean, , Subway, Etc. I had been wanting for sometime to try ""Angelina's Pizza"" and was delighted to see they had what they called a ""Angelina's Pizza Express"". The cashier was very friendly.  They sell pizza by the slice which sits under a heat lamp until ordered. I recommend buying a whole pie if there is more then one of you since leftover pizza rocks. 
We decided on a large pepperoni. It was 18 inches and cost $29.58 for the pizza and 2 fountain drinks. We waited in the food court seating area until the pizza was done baking. The tables and floor were filthy. The cashier brought us our pizza and again was very friendly. The pizza was pure grease. There was barely any sauce on it.

They would not let us check in early most up town hotels do. We parked in the structure so I can't comment on the valet. The walk from the structure to the hotel is short but there is a smell that will hit you like a ton of bricks a mix of fecal mater and rotting food. I guess that is what I get for not using the valet.

Once inside the signs posted made it easy to find the check in desk. The pool and area surrounding was closed but it was 50 degrees outside. But during the afternoon it would have been nice to sit on the lounge chairs and take in the sun. Great for a hangover.

It had a bar which is really nice with a refrigerator a plus. The beds were a bit hard and they promised roll a ways in our room but did not get them until we called twice. The TV's were old but worked and had a clear picture. The jacuzzi tub looked new but the shower looked old and had some mold in the corners YUCK! 

We ate at the Thai restaurant and the food was good and the price was OK. We ate one time at the food court and the food was OK but the people working there were rude especially in the fast food Chinese restaurant. 

The event was great it was close and well run. I only wish that the hotel would have had coupons for seating etc.

Once i got up to the room i noticed the room wasn't clean and the room was outdated. There was candy wrappers on the floor and there was garbage under the bathroom sink. There was gum on the stool in plain sight. The air conditioner didn't have a air diverter on and went directly to the curtains and the bathroom was falling apart with the grout lines around the tiles in the shower was crumbling. So  I  went down at talked to the front desk and spoke to a manager and she told me they would get housekeeping to come to my room immediately, that was a BIG LIE. They didn't come until the next day.  I asked the front desk about receiving a package at the hotel and they told me no problem, So the next day  when i went to pick it up the front desk told me it was at the ups store in the hotel, The rude ups store owner told me that the only way i was going to get my package was to pay him 8.00  and i told him he was crazy because i wasn't going to pay for something that was never authorized to go to his ups store.  Then i went to talk to the front desk and they told me to give them my number and they would have the hotel operation manager terry give me a call and he never did. So i went back to my hotel room and like i normally do i strip the beds every morning and strip the pillow cases off the pillows. I stripped the pillow cases off and found BLOOD Stains on the pillows. So i called the housekeeping department and demanded a housekeeping supervisor to come to my room, they kinda resisted at first but i told them i wasnt going to talk about the problems over the phone. So pearl the house keeping supervisor came and i showed her the major problems and told her these things should of been caught the first time when the housekeeper cleaned my room before i checked in. She didn't act to surprised she acted like it was a normal thing. Before pearl left i asked her when will housekeeping come clean my room. I told her i would like an exact time frame, She asked when do you want them to come clean your room, I told her i would like it done in the morning between 9am and 11am so when i get back to the room i can relax, Pearl said i will put you on the list for first thing at 9am. I said great well it wasn't so great most of the time in the whole week i stayed there they showed up around noon. I had to call housekeeping back once because after they cleanned i found towels that they left had nasty brown stains on them and the housekeeper blamed it on the laundry people when really the house keeper needs to check the towels before she placed them in the room. This hotel was the worst hotel i have ever stayed in my life and it needs a major wake up call and a major renovation. I am very surprised that this hotel was not appeared on hotels impossible.

3563239,2013-04-02,0,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"BED BUGS. Stay Away. We stayed at the Riviera Hotel & Casino for a professional conference and had one of the very worst experiences imaginable: we were bitten all over our legs and arms by bed bugs and we were treated poorly by hotel management and security after reporting the bites. 

First, listen to these online reviews. Mine isn't the only bed bug incident!!! Our biggest mistake was that we ignored all of the many warnings before booking the hotel. We ignored warnings of bed bugs from colleagues who refused to stay there. We ignored Yelp reviews warning customers of bed bugs (read them. There's tons!) and ignored warning about The Riviera on the Bed Bug Registry: http://www.bedbugregistry.com/hotel/NV/Las-Vegas/Riviera-Hotel-%2526amp;-Casino

Instead of making the smart decision, we reasoned that it would be nice to stay at the hotel hosting our conference and that, really, it couldn't be that bad. BAD DECISION. 

We checked in Tuesday. Thursday night we discovered bed bug bites on our feet, legs, and arms. We google-image searched bed bug bites and read about the symptoms. They looked exactly like the pictures and matched the symptoms. When we brought this to the attention of the hotel staff, we received the complete run-around. Management passed us off to security, who took pictures of all our bites on our feet, arms, and legs. Security passed us off to risk management (who, conveniently, were not in at that moment), and then we were passed back to hotel management and passed back to security. No one could give us any answers, but we were given a new room while they investigated our old room. A manager ""comped"" us $50.00 but suggested that this comp does not confirm fault by the hotel (sounds kind of fishy, right?). 

When we checked out we told the management that we would not be paying for the room. Management called security, who surrounded us, threatened us, and harassed us. They told me to wait 8-10 business days before calling risk management. I waited 10 business days and called today. I was informed that the report came back as ""inconclusive"" and that I would be responsible for paying the room. When I questioned their investigation, saying that it was awfully convenient that their investigation found no evidence of bed bugs, they hung up on me. Now the Riviera is making me pay for my bedbug-infested room. What a poor, poor example of customer service. In a town where they're basically giving away hotel rooms to try to get folks to stay and gamble, they wouldn't even comp us a room after infesting our bodies, clothes, and luggage with bed bugs. Now that's poor customer service. 

Seriously, listen to the warnings on Yelp and other review sites. Don't make the mistake of thinking that these are a few random bitter cranks with an axe to grind. This is a serious problem that the hotel apparently has not addressed properly.",F7GPdKwR6QDtxSl-5RBL-g,8,0,1,QS-HhR4Y0oGlfyqq_yOXNg

After a long drive full of excitement and ready to gamble, we arrive at the desk and were told that we had to pay an additional deposit. The deposit wasn't an issue. The issue we had is that we weren't told this when confirming our payment online. 

Confused, we proceeded to ask for a manager to inquire why this is not clearly stated on their website. The manager proceeds to tell us, ""Well the deposit fee is located under the terms and conditions."" WTF??? 

I said, ""Do you mean the really fine print that usually goes with other small jibberish that no one actually reads?"" The manager proceeds to shrug his shoulders. Wow.

I can definitely see that we should have spent 2 hours reading through 10 paragraphs of terms and conditions. Perhaps we also should have hired a lawyer to help us understand their first come first serve bed policy that doesn't really allow you to choose the type of bedding that you're paying for. Why on earth would a double bed and a king bed room be close to the same price is beyond me.

The only saving grace in all of this was the clerk who offered us a suite for our troubles and misunderstanding. I also thought the valet and bellhops did a wonderful job. Oh and a maintenance tech came up to my room because I thought I stopped up the tub but didn't. He went the extra mile to clear the drain just in case so I tipped him.

First off, the rooms DO NOT COME WITH A COFFEE MAKER so you have to go downstairs and pay $3+ for a coffee EVERY MORNING. It is an old hotel, I will give it that. When we checked in, they asked us if we would like to upgrade our room for an extra $20 a night. We said sure. They put us on THE TOP floor (64 I believe), for the first two nights (we were there three nights from Wed-Sat), it was fine. We had an OK view of the strip, whatever. Friday night, however, was when the issue started. The lady who checked us in failed to mention that we would be RIGHT UNDER the penthouse which OFTEN has VERY LOUD private parties, so unless you plan on staying out all night long and not sleeping, expect to hear extremely loud annoying music right above your head. My husband first called the front desk and complained, asking if we could be switched rooms. They told him they can do anything BUT THAT (as if they were booked, which they obviously were not). They agreed to wave the upgrade and resort fees, saving us $120. He said fine. About 15 minutes later after more annoying music and loud thumping, we finally had enough - sleep would have been impossible even with ear plugs. This was about 2AM. He went downstairs to actually talk to the front desk people and finally managed to wrangle us another room for the night, so about 2:30AM we had to pack up everything and move a couple floors down. I'm not sure why they couldn't have done that in the first place but hey, at least we saved $120 in the end, even though that's about how much we ended up paying for coffee (kidding).

I'm just happy that i booked my march 25-30 vegas trip at Riviera. At least this way i get to pay my final respects and take a ton of pictures and all that jazz. I plan to be back in vegas around July. Hard to imagine veing in vegas and seeing the Riviera demolished. Breaks my heart. I'm a 25 year old....6ft 250 lb man and i might shed some tears when they blow up the riviera. So many memories at the riv over the years. 

One of the very first places i ever stayed at in Vegas. Always had a special place i my heart for that. I got to Vegas about 3-4 times a year and not one trip have i done without at least stopping into the Riviera. I love the place. I never had a connection to the sahra or Bills so i didn't really care much when those 2 closed down. Riviera closing down is like a stab in the back. Riviera definitely kinda had it coming though. They should have added a night club and really modernized the casino. The hotel rooms were cool but maybe they could have done more to make those more modern. The pool was kinda old maybe should have been turned into a day club or something. I'm the biggest Riviera fan but they made a big mistake by focusing so much on their past. You walk in the hotel and there are so many black and white photos of when elvis and frank sinatra used to hang out there. That's all great but that kinda stuff doesn't work in today's Vegas tbh. You gotta be hip and trendy and all that other crap! 

I really kinda blame resorts world for moving to slow in opening up!!! If they would have made real progress thwn maybe the Riv could have bought more time. Sadly i don't think the Riviera was ever gonna do any of the ideas i mentioned. They were just hoping to survive off people like me who dig the old vegas vibe. Unfortunately there aren't many people in my age group who dig old vegas like i do. Hate to admit it but it's true. 

I hope all of you who didn't plan to make a trip the first half of the year decide to make a trip over to the riv. Once it's gone....it's gone. Unlike all these fake people who will cry about the riv being imploded when they haven't even been there in years.......i can honestly say i appreciated the riv. Made lots of trips and memories. 

R.I P Riviera. Strip won't be the same without you. Looks like Treasure Island and Ballys will be my new home base casinos from here on out.

Yes, the hotel looks dated and they don't have as much fancy amenities as the other larger casino/hotels in Vegas. However, you have to keep it in perspective: this is a cheaper hotel and you get what you pay for. 
My boyfriend and I checked in at 1 am and the registration staff was very friendly and accommodating. We got a free upgrade to one of the Monaco Tower rooms (yay!). The room itself was not bad. It seemed clean and organized, and we had amenities such as a working safe, fridge and iron and ironing board. The bathroom was also well-kept. 
Why I only gave 3 stars: First, the WIFI sucked. The connection was spotty at best. Secondly, there weren't a lot of channel selections on TV. Thirdly, the parking lot in the back is a dump.",TnlaOafOLBmGIobSYMe3Cg,2,0,3,w9VSUJj9XS-1ZLjaHR728A
3714627,2010-10-26,10,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"Oh stop complaining, you freakin' cheapskate!

I feel like taking 3/4 of all of these people who wrote reviews for the Riviera and screaming ""WHAT, YOU NO LOVE'A SINATRA?!?""  into a megaphone that's placed directly over their ear while I sip my favorite drink at a unicorn-themed slot machine. With the exception of the guy who supposedly lost his money in the room, do the rest of you really not get it?

What do you expect for $27 a night? I have stayed at the worst flea-bitten motels here in SoCal that charge at least $60/night... and this place is actually on the strip, has a couple (albeit sh!tty) bars, an ABC Store, freaky entertainment, a weird food court, a pool, gaming tables, new gadgetry in the rooms, AND it's clean. As far as location, you can jump on the Deuce (if you should so choose to remain cheap) and for only $5 bucks, get a 24/hr pass to go up and down the strip to the younger/hipper joints... or, you can hop in a cab with some friends and split the cost.

The Riviera serves its purpose; it is by no means The Wynn or Caesar's, so let's stop grading it as if it is. It is a piece of true Americana and it makes me sad to see it sit with such a low rating. If you are reviewing it against other places you'd pay $27 bucks to stay at, then hell it deserves 5 stars+ easily. I've stayed here on a couple occasions - it is by no means my first choice on the strip, but every time I have stayed here, I wasn't disappointed when compared to what I had spent to do so... and what's more is that I felt relieved after I got back home that I didn't drop major coin for a turnaround trip where I wasn't even in the room.

I have however stayed in the Frank Sinatra Suite here for a friend's bachelor party and loved every moment of it (of course this was not $27). Sprawling (and furnished) wraparound balconies overlooking the strip and all of Vegas, a giant granite-top step-behind bar, lovely bathrooms with marble floors and tubs, cushy carpets, really ice cold A/C... And when couple of months later, my lady and I needed a place to sleep for just one night (before our rate kicked in at another place up the strip), we opted for the Rivi - again, you just can't beat the price. There are new flat-panel TV's,cool little clock radios with the spot for your iPhones/iPod.... and if you pay $3 to $4 more dollars at check-in, they will usually upgrade you to another tower. The room I received had just been overhauled, and when I got into the room there was a note on the bed saying that the carpets on the entire floor had been shampooed (I hope this wasn't murder-related lol).

So with all due respect, please grade this place on its budget class. Don't put a well-driven, used Lexus up against a brand new Maybach with a champagne bucket and humidor in the back seat (that reclines)... even if the Lexus has a new interior, some fun rims, and TV's in the headrests (yes, the Rivi is kind of ghetto-fabulous). 

If you want 5-stars or 5-diamond, just go up the strip to The Bellagio, The Wynn, Encore, the Venetian, etc... which is where I go when I spend more than one night in Vegas, and when I win! But for one measly night, hey... $27 bucks isn't all that bad when you just need a place to fall over and vomit for a night. I don't however gamble at the Rivi. Mikey said it best in Swingers - ""this is truly olllld school.""

A definite 5-stars for strip access, ease of reservation, the neat little additions to the rooms, being the home of Sinatra when in Vegas, and of course that price...

3717631,2011-07-28,4,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"I am not even sure where to start as I know this review will offend some... For that I apologize in advance. 
I decided to stop for the night while driving through Vegas for a little gaming and fun. I called ahead and booked a ""renovated"" room which was supposed to have ""European comfort mattresses"", a flat screen TV, fridge, hair dryer, and so on. 
Upon arriving at the Riviera after walking through filthy brass and glass doors, I waited in line for a good 20 minutes to check in. Every employee, even management were cloaked in dumpy, dirty uniforms. After getting my room key I was shuffled from the front desk through the poorly organized casino floor to find the elevator to my room, it was kind of like a scavenger hunt. Now, the elevators! Filthy, dirty floors, base boards, more brass and broken mirrors full of hand-prints; at this point I was reconsidering my stay. Up to the room which was NOT renovated in the least bit we were greeted by our maid who had JUST started cleaning! The mattress was discussing and was more like a maxi pad then a ""European comfort mattress"". The carpet was warn and filthy which actually went well with the general motif of the room which was dirty. Flat screen TV??? Nope. Old box TV. No amenities what so ever, not even a cheap $10 hair dryer. 
Now when you go to the Riviera and sign up for their players club card you receive what was near capital punishment... The free buffet. It was as unorganized as the casino itself and the food was so disgusting I didn't stay and eat. Now there were people in there eating who did seem to be enjoying their free buffet but keep in mind they had a couple noticeable teeth missing and babies on their hips; pure white trash tornado bait. Now even these picky consumers were saying ""at least it's free"" in regards to the buffet. Now stop and think for a second, a pile of dog poop is free but would you eat it? The casino itself is owned by a Chinese man which would explain that a large majority of the dealers didn't speak English well enough to understand. They also never smiled, they acted like they were chained to the tables and hated their jobs. This might also explain the awful Chinese food at the buffet, angry cooks! If the white trash patrons isn't enough to make you stay somewhere else, try the countless thug-like gang banger want to be's with fake diamond earrings and gold chains. 
I spoke to a Manager regarding my room situation and she had no time or sympathy for me being placed in an un-renovated room, the quality of the staff or the filthy conditions. She didn't even offer to comp the $79 room! The only thing she did was charge me the un-renovated room rate which should have been done anyway. 
People go to Vegas to enjoy being pampered and taken care of, excellent customer service and attention to detail... none of which the Riviera possess. Walk into any other casino on the strip and you will see staff that great you with a smile, go out of their way to help you. The entrance to every other casino I've been to are constantly being rubbed with Brasso and the glass is spotless. Ah, if you decide to have a cocktail it is faster to leave the casino and go buy one due to the fact that the waitresses rarely come by and three times when I ordered a Diet Coke, they never even came back! 
If it was possible to give the Riviera no stars, I would. Don't waste your money there... at least go somewhere where they smile when they take your money :)",6sNBgwe4H5RUVh0P4ntfxg,2,0,1,aLdUx9G5jaKtqk_fCskhXQ

The bathroom door interferes with the sink when attempting to open the door fully.

There are a couple of things to note on the good side- 
the slots are never crowded and neither are the table games
the crowd here is as unpretentious as you can get 
the history of the resort is hard to match- Dino used to be a part owner and Liberace was the headliner here shortly after the doors opened for the first time. Frank Sinatra had one of the rooms in the Monte Carlo Tower remodeled to meet his tastes during one of his runs. There are a few exhibits of the heyday of the Riviera near the Monaco Tower including a great photo of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis onstage together.

But ya know what? It turned out to be a great decision. The hotel is walking distance (clearly marked) to the convention center, so you don't have to screw around with the monorail on your way to a conference, which was great because it was NAB and the lines for that thing go for miles in the morning.

The whole hotel was pretty dirty, I thought at any moment the garage elevator might break or that one day the doors would open and a hobo would be waiting inside with a knife. Also, when I arrived at 10pm, the valet was closed...umm hello..this is Vegas...nothing closes..WHY ARE YOU CLOSED??!!!???

I also took a nap around 2pm and woke up at 6pm with a swollen eye, I blame it either on dirty pillows or one of the cleaning ladies punched me while I was sleeping because they couldn't clean the room...who knows...

I will give them points for having 76 cent water in the gift shops, comfy beds and fast room service (we asked for extra towels to be brought up.) Also, (being a girl) taking a shower and having the mirror fog up is a pain in the ass since we need to get ready afterwards. I don't know what crazy system they had but the middle of the mirror never fogged up and let it be known that I take hot enough showers to where you can't see your hand in front of your face.

Also if you want to gamble in peace, this is the place, practically dead in the casino any time of the day I came to find out.

Yep, like everyone else, we stayed here on a last-minute package vacation deal cuz it was cheap as hell.  I doubt anyone comes here because they actually choose to.  You think, whatever, I can gamble in another casino, or spend all my time in nicer casinos.  And that's exactly what you do.  Except there's a few things that are kind of annoying about staying in a shitty hotel/casino and spending all your time in nicer places, like having to return to your shitty hotel/casino in the middle of the night.  And having to wake up there and go down to your shitty pool.  And having no convieniently-located dining options except for shitty restaurants.  

The staff was ok.  No one was rude, surprisingly - people were actually pretty friendly and jolly overall, said hi and how are you whenever we walked past.  Except for the security guard who told me to put my flip-flops back on my swollen and blistered feet was I was walking to my room.  Harumph.  They had no problem with me walking barefoot through the Bellagio or the Venetian - one of the managers at the Bellagio laughed when he saw me do it and said ""Good idea!""  Stupid Riviera.

Room was ok.  Clean, average.  Air conditioner was kind of noisy.

Casino sucks, and is depressing.  Cocktail waitresses are scarce, and when they do take your order, take a goddamn eon to deliver it.  And god help you if you don't tip every single time - you'll get a nice dose of baditude and some audible snide comments.  Barely any tables open, even on Saturday night.

Pool is lame.  Deep enough to dive into, but that's about the only good part.  Reminds me of a Best Western or Motel 6 pool.  Not cool.

Restaurants are not only lame, but downright laughable.  With all the amazing dining options in Vegas, they expect people to be stupid enough to eat at a putrid-looking Asian restaurant that serves California rolls in bento boxes along with chow mein and kung pao chicken, or an Italian restaurant so creatively entitled ""Ristorante Italiano"".  Yeah, you gotta be f'n kidding me.

All in all, if you have really, really low expectations, don't mind walking about 20 minutes to get somewhere nice, and this isn't your first Vegas trip (unlike my bf, unfortunately) then go ahead and stay here, and don't eat at any of the restaurants.",oikpDYJBuJn3dowmLayjmA,3,3,2,RB_xMRXpvL_3DJWKrt0kwg

They have recently gone through a series of renovations and their rooms are definitely up to par in comparison to the 4 star hotels on the strip.

For Friday and Saturday night reservations, I paid a total of $130 after tax. I believe I got it for a special rate from i4vegas.com.  They put me in a king sized non-smoking room. The room featured a wide flat screen TV and a plush king sized bed. The decor around the room was very classy with a bit of gold trim in it.  The window view however wasnt anything to brag about since the Riveria is located on Paradise, not Las Vegas Blvd. 

Walking through the lobby you will feel like you are a cast of the 70's show. The businesses are definitely aging and have not changed over the years. The bar next to the casino has very reasonable prices for drinks. You can expect to pay downtown las vegas prices at the bar here. I did not do much gambling or attend a show here, so I can't really comment on that. 

The only downside to the room I had was that it was located next to an elevator shaft. I heard elevators running up and down all night, but I did not mind at the occasion. I was well intoxicated and ready to pass out every time I got back to my room.  The parking was also very limited in the small old structure building which had one functioning elevator.

The hotel interior wasn't the best but I was acceptable. The room was old but alright for the short amount of time I stayed. The part that was the worst was the staff! We waited in line for an hour just to check in and when we're just about at the front of the line the a women redirected us to an automated check in machine. When we got to it was broken so we lost our spot in line. I called the women who redirected us to the machine and she ignored us and left the area. When she came back I called her over again and she just put us in the back of another line!  When I told her we were at the front of the first line she told us we could use the VIP room to check in. To make it short the women who checked us in was very rude and didn't want to help us. Seems to me if your working in a VIP room you should be very helpful and respectful to your customers. After the check in fiasco I went to go my bags from the car. I had a lot of luggage becuse I was recently relocating back to Las Vegas. When I arrived at the front door with my luggage ( about 4 bags) there were three Bell hops that just stood there and watched me struggle to get my bags inside. One even had the nerve to say ""your going in the wrong door."" I was fully prepared to tip anyone of them but they instead decided to watch me struggle instead of do their job.

Her response indicated she had heard what I said.  She said something like  ""oh that will be fun""  and I went on merry way. 

Flash forward a few days and I go to use the credit.  There is no credit balance on the card.  I go to the cashier cage and a different cashier is working.  I asked her what was up andr she tells me that I have until midnight the same day as tournament to use the credits.  I asked how I was supposed to know this and told her that I had even told the other cashier I planned to use them later in the week.  She apologized and told me to take it up with the casino host.  

I was totally unimpressed with the casino host.  She told me that due to gaming commission rules she could do nothing to help me or reissue the  credits I'd won.  I told her that this is very unfair as I had no idea the creditswwould be revoked so quickly.  She said the rules are posted at the tournament.  When I asked specifically where they were posted she didn't know,  but advised that I ask the promo people running the tournament.  

So I went back the next week to look for these rules.  Guess what? No rules posted.  I asked.  An employee hosting the tournament told me they could grab me a copy.  But it confirmed what I thought.  I didn't remember seeing anything about rules. 

What irks me is that we're talking a $50 prize and it's not even cash! It's credit! Awarding me the $50 credit would be nothing to them. I live next door to the Riv and have spent lots of money there.  So you're going to haggle over $50 credit when the rules aren't posted and the cashier never mentioned a time limit when I gave her the perfect opportunity to do so.  

I used to like the Riviera.  The place can go to hell now for all I care.  I would have called the gaming commission on them,  but it's just $50 plus the place will be blown to bits soon enough.  Way to go Riviera.  I'll never return.",-jSTFDuaDXMrLYvU1KbK5Q,2,0,1,Lh3eR5temzIvgjWtW_Exgw

I picked this hotel mainly because it was a cheap. We were driving through Vegas and it seemed like a good choice. This place is not glamourous by any means. We stayed in the newer tower, which turned out to be just an average room. The older towers seemed to be the shitty part of the hotel. The stay was fine, but I was surprised that room service was open late night. It seemed like the whole hotel/casino became deserted after a certain hour. This compared to other hotels where shit is always happening. 

This place is very kitschy, but not in a charming or endearing way. You are constantly bombarded with famous celebrities that have performed there over the years. It became sad when you realize that there haven't been notable acts there in 25-30 years. It seemed like they were trying way too hard to say that they were once very popular. If they want to capitalize on their happening era in the 50s though the 70s they should just go all in with it. Don't use blown-up boring old photos of acts. Use original posters or reproductions of them. Have old music playing in the lobby. I'm not sure if they're trying to hard or not hard enough.",OfhLNIRdShIOVX5n289yvg,3,2,3,HQq1gwaHHjxG-1J0G28_Pg

Such a old school place
Plenty of dogs at the Hotel Riveria
For an extra price
They, be gambeling up at the Hotel Riveria
Bring your credit cards

Mirrors on the closet
2 queen size beds
The beds are soft, but they sure arnt warm
Also in the chambers, 
A safe and a fridge
They turn the air on
You can freeze in there too.

Plenty of hot water at the Hotel Riveria
But, the hair dryer sucks
Lots of white towels at the Hotel Riveria
Lots of thin towels. 
There is no view out the window at the Hotel Riveria. 

Last thing I remember. I was
Running out the door
The elevators, so old
I had, to check out
To head back
To the OC, where I was before

You can check in if you want to
You may not be pleased
Its cheap at the Riveria
Watch out for the resort fee",Z3AYjHqiFJccwaR9qUeOHQ,42,39,3,F54KCFNRVjUMl1W0mTRHVA

Our room was relatively clean if you disregard the weird stains on the curtains.

The room served its Vegas purpose, sleep and shower. Like Rich C said, don't expect the same thrills as you would receive from the newer places on the strip. 

We were upgraded to a mini suite at no additional cost and the room looked and smelled clean. Two cons I did experience was the limited hot water and the sink at the bar in our room made a belching noise in the middle of the night. The duece ran every 15 minutes and drops you off right where you need to go.

4083181,2014-07-11,0,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"The hotel was actually better than I anticipated, especially for an older hotel and casino. We wanted to stay on the strip over 4th of July weekend and knew it would be crazy, but the Riviera averaged out to be in our price range for 4 nights. As the days went on (and got crowded) it was a little difficult being quite so far down the strip, as you have to spend a good 10 minutes walking just to be at the start of it all, but leveraging the monorail to the LVH helped a lot. And - it's not quite as far as the Stratosphere, it's pretty close to a Walgreen's which came in handy, and the first stop on your way up the strip is the Wynn Encore.

I enjoyed the casino and the waitresses were actually the friendliest we came across our entire trip! It has some old school Vegas charm and didn't feel too rowdy or crazy compared with some of the other casinos. The pool seemed nice and our room was better than expected. It was also very easy to get to from the lobby.

The rooms look as if they've been updated recently. The bed was very comfy and the flat screen TV over the bar area was nice. The clamp holding our showerhead was broken, but everything else was fine. There was a hair dryer and an iron/ironing board in the room, which doesn't always come with a 3-star room. We had a lovely view of the parking structure (haha), but seriously, for the price and the fact that we checked in almost at midnight, it was expected.

While it may not be my first choice for a hotel in Vegas, it definitely fit the bill for a late-planned getaway on a tighter budget. I would be willing to stay again.",rV_BtXBqUKLIj4D-AqF9ag,5,1,3,tTcyIPm00AZLwSOnxY6Wyw

The reason the line becomes so backed up is due to the incompetent staff attempting to hustle you into upgrades. That being said, after 45 minutes in line and the staff fumbling around on the computer we finally accepted the penthouse suite. Which she suddenly added $300 onto after we agreed upon the price. At first we were very pleased with the room. However on night 2 of 3 we dropped an empty water bottle off of our balcony later to find 10 security guards in the room. We were shocked when they told us to pack our bags and hit the streets. Upon the expedited check out the front desk staff informed us that we would receive a refund for our final night. Again another lie from their hustling staff. Also, I failed to mention the horrible restaurant service. We didn't even know who our server was, but since we had a party of six gratuity was included, so they didn't need to take care of us.",Fn9jzD0QvLXjUlldTFe5sA,1,0,1,FFNxwNt6gyPqnu1H1m6_xQ

My parents, husband and I went to the Riviera to meet my friend for the Sin City Roller Derby.  So much fun!  We got there about 2 hours before the derby and explored the hotel.  You can tell it's an old hotel but it's been kept up very well.  The pool was packed!  We agreed we're going to come back sometime this summer just to hang out pool side.  There are a couple nice bars throughout the hotel.  Cheap drinks and reasonable priced food.  It's never crossed my mind to stay here but I'd be curious what the rooms look like and what their room rates are.

The roller derby was back in the convention area.  This was my first time going and my friend said it's a seasonal sport.  I'm a huge fan now!  I wasn't sure how the points system works but we're going for their next competition in July!  Really looking forward to going back to the Riviera!

We checked in and asked if there was an upgrade and they showed us pictures of the newly renovated rooms. For the price of the upgrade, it seemed like it was totally worth it! We made it up to the room and opened it... And we were sorely disappointed. The room was a little bigger than the normal, but there were 2 full beds (not even queens), no couches (like in the pictures shown to us) and it looked like the decor from the late 80s/early 90s. In the morning, when we took showers, the shower head was broken on the side so when I got out of the shower, there was water EVERYWHERE. After we came back to the hotel, our beds were made and we got new towels but the housekeeping service was bad. There was donut pieces on the floor left from the day before, they threw our complementary toiletries on the counter and they didn't throw away our trash! I mean, come on! All we did the whole time was complain. Broken drawers, bad sheets, horrible pillows.

TO CHECK IN.

At a hotel.

This is absurd. Patently absurd. We were in a casino. A run-down, past-its-prime casino that gave us a decent deal on Expedia. And they had us wait an hour in line to check in, when we could have been gambling!

The interior of the hotel is okay. It's very old-Vegas. There's some renovation going on, which may be interesting in the future, but we were honestly just so turned off by the place after waiting for an hour that we couldn't appreciate much.

At least they had the courtesy to upgrade us to a ""deluxe room"" though the deluxe room was suspiciously similar to some motel rooms I've stayed in. It was fine, though. The room wasn't as clean as I would have expected.

Overall, I think we would have been better off paying a little extra. The same night we booked at the Riviera, we could have booked for $20 more at Mandalay Bay. Disappointing. The best part of the Riviera is its close proximity to the Wynn and the other good hotels, which is where we took our gambling and food money.

Oh, and internet is $10. Tacky, tacky, tacky.

In short, we'd stay somewhere else next time. We didn't spend a single extra cent at the Riviera. Well, except for the $7 ""resort fee"" they make you pay on check-out. Tacky.

It's not surprising that the place went bankrupt.",7dGIeJcwOnjc2pSpqANYPA,1,1,1,JTqSeGzk3GFActtsjJUJcw

The Bad:  The pool was small and my hair smelled funny after swimming, the floors in the casino are oddly uneven.

They have a super bowl party every year here that is very fun.  All you can eat and drink and watch the game with 100+ fans on the big screens.

I've also been to an MC Hammer concert here, not the best acoustics but MC brought it.

This is an older casino on the north end of the strip so it's only going to cost about $25 / night to stay here.  It's on par with Circus Circus but smaller and a little nicer rooms.  They do have an ""arcade"" that features old games like 'frogger' and old pinball games near the food court.",bWJWcQyDKtFSvsTW2tR3hw,2,0,3,-XqjS3mzRJo374j3IBH_zg

So why was i here? My friend was in a pool tournament, the BCAPL National 8 ball championship.  Their pool room is actually not half bad.  I know nothing about competitive pool but it was interesting to see all them playing head to head and only missing at the most 1-2 shots a match.

My experience: As soon as I drove into the parking lot I knew it was going to be ghetto. I mean, come on, the parking lot was hidden in the back and a guard was checking people. Anyway, I enter and there is a long check in line. I'm not complaining but it did take a while for me to check in. 

I stayed in the ""new"" Monaco tower. Overall my room was very clean and the hotel performed good house keeping services for me. There were no stains on the furniture or walls so that's good (I saw the white stained chairs in some yelp pics and that's why i'm mentioning it LOL). 

Pros:
-CHEAAAPPP!!!!!!!
-clean (Monaco towers at least)

cons:
-its on the strip, but not really (end of north)
-creepers everywhere

4311134,2009-02-01,2,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"I guess you could say I'm somewhat atypical when it comes to Vegas.  I usually look for hotels to stay at when it's just me and the bf.  Quite frankly I'm pretty cheap when it comes to hotels especially in Vegas when you're not staying in there most of the time.  So I've had very few hits with finding decent cheap hotels and very many hits on finding really bad cheap places that look like a scene from Psycho.  

So here's the background of my most recent trip, with the economy being down and hotel rates being so cheap in Vegas I couldn't help, but book this place.  It was on a long weekend and from Friday check in to Sunday check out it was a grand total of $64.88, that's right folks under $70 for two nights stay for a hotel across the street from Circus Circus and on the strip.  That's unheard of already.  By the way, I found the rate on Expedia.com, they're usually my go to spot for finding awesome hotel deals.  I was so blinded by the rate, I didn't do that much research about the rooms and hotel in general, because with that cheap of a rate, who cares?  

So I wasn't caring until we were driving to Vegas and I was trying to recall even seeing a Riviera hotel all the other times I'd come to Vegas and I couldn't....""Which one is it?""  So we finally drove up to it and it looked like shit to be honest on the outside....my stomach dropped and I was so afraid this was going to be the WORST hotel experience ever.  I quickly started apologizing to the bf profusely because we would have to stay here for two whole nights....

To my surprise and luck they had just done a huge remodel of the rooms.  The room we were in was in the Mediterranean Tower and I'm not sure if they remodeled all the rooms in the various towers.  Our room was very modern with dark wood with granite counter tops accented with silver towel holders, handles, etc.  Rooms also came with Ipod docking station, refrigerator, coffee maker, hair blower, flat screen TV (not many channels), and comforter blankets.  The blankets were not the crappy type with a brown fleece like one on top of white sheets.  

So if you can ignore the rest of the decor of this old hotel,  somewhat incompetent staff and need some place to simply just sleep after a night of having fun, I would recommend this place.",m-AqgvPMYqlwgZoISndVxQ,5,2,4,tLQoVlMfWdInx5466lkFpA

4314844,2015-04-12,7,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"We got a deal for TWO from San Francisco to Vegas round trip, car rental and 3 nights at the Riviera for $350 total... So i guess I can't complain much... Sort of along the same lines of, ""its was a great deal, so you can't go wrong""..?? or NOT! How can you not go wrong with something just because its, ""a great deal""?

This whole experience reinforces my original opinion that a nice hotel makes all the difference. You get what you pay for? Maybe... But our airline was Virgin America and I would say the flight was hands down better than United, Southwest or American. And, we had no complaints about our car rental.. A brand new car, excellent gas milage and power windows and AC. So the Hotel was really the worst part of this ""getting what you pay for"". 

Despite all the fuss this place makes about ""class""... the Riviera is probably one of the lowest class hotels of all the ""big names"" on the strip. First, this Hotel is at the far end of the strip, about 2 blocks past the main strip where everyone hangs out. It has the worst entrances you can imagine to get into the parking lot and even worse to get to the valet. The first impression we got when entering the ""main lobby"" (located in the rear of the building) was, wow.... Outdated! The Hotel concierge are all wearing worn looking T-shirts and the lobby is full of black and white photos from once famous people who stayed here in years dating backward of the 1970's. The cellophane balloon decor  leaves a lot to be desired as well.

The hookers that walk into this hotel look more like actual crack whores vs. your typical whore, who does some crack. Majority of guests appear to be either old or a minority group. Check-in on a Wednesday around 8pm took about an hour. They have two of those digital check-in kiosks, but both appeared to be turned completely off/non-functional. 

Besides a large number of obviously lower income guests staying at this hotel, on the day of our visit, there was a guy standing at the elevator entrance who appeared to have been just released from a mental institution or badly needed to go to one. Another guest whispered to her boyfriend, ""did you see that guys eyes, he looked like he was going to kill someone"". 

The room was reminiscent of a motel room, the toilet looked like it was from the 60's and retained the most amount of water I have seen a toilet hold. When you flush it, the water just goes round and around while very slowly draining out. With the extra water from the tank, it almost appears to be overflowing which is a bit unnerving each time you flush. Water pressure in the shower was good with the exception of the crappy shower head which had a small spray pattern. The hot water took a while to get warm and the the shower drain flowed poorly as well. The tub floor was stained in a darker shade as if it doesn't get scrubbed all the time. The restroom, mostly the shower, smells like a combination urine and mold. Our clothing iron in our room didn't work. The refrigerator rumbles through the night and makes a loud pop/clank every time it stops abruptly. We found empty boxes of beer left behind on multiple occasions near the elevators and on our last day a nice chunk of chewing gum strung across the elevator up/down indicator arrow/light.... Just a lot of ""things""... Like the view from our room into the alley on the side of the building and on top of the dirty rooftop which was littered with bottles, cans clothing and a shoe. Rotted equipment and a air duct that was cut open and had cuts resembling ones that a pocket knife would make.

Something you'll see on a lot of the Rivieras signs and brochures around the hotel is the phrase ""Classic"". Actually, they also say, ""Classic Fun, Classic Value, Classic Vegas""... But i think they left out, ""Classic STAINS!"". It was hard to sleep at night, not only because the bed was hard and uncomfortable or the sheets were rough, but the stains on all the furniture in our room was very unsettling. 

Overall, the Riviera hotel is very ghetto and i would not recommend anyone I know stay there, including all of you people reading this now. After all, you came here to see what others opinions were... And this is mine.",gB7_kyOo5JmVAY0BrwyT_A,5,2,1,Evij3SsCuXw9ql3DPae5ug

This is not my favorite hotel on the strip. Is it full of history with old rooms that smell? Yes that is the smell of History. Come on Sinatra has a suite here. I am sure there are things in this hotel we do not want to know anything about, so sometimes it is better to just hold your nose & deal with it.

I have only stayed at this hotel because of work. I would never personally pick this place ever.

When I check-in, I asked for a Humidifier and I was promptly told, ""the Riv does not have any"". I informed the check-in agent that I stay in Vegas 3 times a year & every hotel has humidifiers. She promptly told me I was wrong & she questioned what hotels I stayed at last. I informed her and she said, ""That is hard to believe because one of the hotels I mentioned was a sister property and they do not have humidifiers!"" I looked at her and said, ""I am sorry because they gave me one for a week!""  So frustrating! Why are you arguing with me?

Two days went by and I was about to go to Walgreens to purchase a Humidifier. I decided to call Housekeeping and just ask. The Manager in Housekeeping said, ""I wish you would have called two days ago because I think I am out of them!"" I was so mad that I actually listened to the front desk. I should have just called two days ago. The Manager was so sweet because I asked her to call me back within the hour because if I did not hear from her I would go and buy one. Five minutes later there was a knock at my door and I was handed a humidifier.  That was 5 star service but the front desk not knowing or even making an attempt to get me a humidifier was 0 stars.

My dry cleaning was suppose to be in my room by 7pm the night before. As I was getting ready in the morning I noticed my dry cleaning was not there. I tried several times to call the Bell Hop, to inquiry about my dress shirt but no one ever picked up the phone. So I decided to pick up my shirt myself & went down on my way to work. I informed the Bell Hop my shirt was never delivered. He then looked at me and said, ""Did you look in the closet?"" I honestly wanted to biff myself in the head and say, ""I wish I had a V8!"" I looked at him and said, ""Really?"" He then went to look for my shirt but made sure to tell me that he probably did not have it. Guess what? He had my shirt. Then he had the rudeness to say, ""I am going to need to see your ID!"" I looked at him and said, ""What are the chances that I gave you my last name, my room number, color of shirt and that it wasn't delivered to my room and it isn't my dress shirt???"" He said, ""Well I have to be sure!"" I said, ""Just be sure you are making me late for work and I now have to get dressed in the Lobby bathroom now!"" Honestly what is the deal with these guys! Are people stealing dry cleaning in hotels?

I also had to leave notes around my room to inform the maid not to touch my stuff. Please do not move my toothbrush and various bathroom stuff. Is it really necessary?  The kicker was the day I walked in and my room was not made and it was 7pm at night. I called the manager and he said, ""I see your room has been marked off as cleaned!"" I told him to come on up or I could email him photos. He asked if he could send up the maid now and I said, ""No! I am in my room & I am good!"" Five minutes later there was a knock on my door from the maid who insisted to come in and clean my room. I had to tell her that I was good & did not want my room cleaned. It was more principal. Don't check my room off as clean and then not clean it.

The kicker is this. I decided to go green & check-out from my television. It then asked me to find the keyboard in the room to type in my email to send me out a final bill. I then opened every drawer in my room to find the keyboard. I then called down to the front desk and was informed that none of the rooms have keyboards. Really? Why tell me to check out from the room & I can not get a bill emailed to me. The front desk manger promised me to email me my final bill. It has been 7 days since I have checked out I have not gotten my final bill. I called after 24 hours and had them email me again. No email. I have in fact called 5 times & I have them send out emails to two different email addresses. Guess what? No email. 

I also had food here once too. I had one of the pre-packed salads from the coffee shop. I opened my salad only to find wilting lettuce in the container. So gross! That was the first & last time that I ate at the hotel. If you stay here you are going to be taking cabs down the street or walking to get to any decent restaurants. There is nothing to do at this end of the strip!

I am hating this review right now because I am taking a big deep breath & reliving this lack of customer service at the Riv! This hotel is not a Five Star Hotel.

I frequent Vegas quite a bit and am not too picky on where I stay.  I booked a room here via expedia.com for a spontaneous, much needed trip to Vegas...and I wanted to do it cheap.When we booked the room, the check in time stated noon clearly. We were antsy to leave so we left from San Diego at around 1 am and figured we'd  kill time until check in. During the drive, we were getting drowsy and called a few times to ask for early check in to which we were informed that it would be likely but to just ask and it shoudln't be a problem. 

WRONG!

We arrived at the hotel at around 5 am and went to the front desk immediately to inquire about early check in. The associate stated that we would have to come back at 12 to see about early check in. This confused us as check in was listed at noon on the site...to this she just pointed at a sign that said check in was at 4pm. I admit, we should've seen the sign....but never in my life had I had to check into a hotel at 4pm. The associate then became really rude and stated that all hotels have check in at 4pm. I stated that I never heard of that and maybe we didn't hear about it because we're from California....not in a rude way, more like in a ""that's very interesting"" way. She then  stated that ALL hotels everywhere have check in at 4pm and she would know because she has been to California hotels before....I guess she didn't think I would know seeing as I LIVE in California. We told her how we drove all the way from San Diego, and she didn't seem to care so we were sent on our way. I'd like to say right here that we were not mad WHATSOEVER....I know it's policy and I can't fight her on that but I guess we must have looked haggard or something because the concierge asked us what was wrong and we told him our story. He said we could inquire about early check in at 11. At this point, we were a little scared to ask the front desk associate so we walked to the car to see if we could call the hotel instead and work something out. My first call was transferred over to someone who told me to call the hotel general info line, which did not open until 10am as stated on their message. My second call was to be transferred to the front desk, to which I was transferred to just about every other place BUT front desk. My third call was to front desk, to which I was hung up on. Fourth time: again hung up on. Fifth time: the SAME front desk associate told us to call the hotel line at 11 when they open. It was a little weird to me that the front desk at the actual hotel couldn't accomodate us, but this 1800 number for the hotel could....At this point, my friend was getting irritated by the contradicting information and decided to go inside. The front desk associate didn't even TRY to hide her annoyance (if you are confused...we only talked to her 2 times once on the phone and another in person) Fortunately, we found another deal at a nearby hotel that had earlier check in. We asked the front desk if we could cancel because we were informed that check in would be earlier and that we couldn't afford to waste our one day in Vegas. She abruptly said that we cannot cancel due to expedia's policy and then asked if we even read everything thoroughly.  
We thought maybe we could call expedia and make an exchange as the other hotel was exactly the same price. Expedia was amazing but said that they need to get confirmation from the hotel. We asked to speak to the manager to get an exchange done right away. When we asked the associate to speak with the manager, she glared at us and said ""that's my manager"" and wanted to know why we wanted to speak with her. AWKWARD. She assumed that we were going to cancel again or do check in, and she stated that she already told us we cannot cancel or check in and walked away. When the assistant manager came out, she asked us what was wrong, all while the front desk associate was standing RIGHT next to her shaking her head, rolling her eyes, muttering under her breath, denying everything, etc. After we tried to get a few sentences out, I couldn't stand it anymore and asked the manager if we could speak in private and she said that we could not and that it HAS to be discussed in front of her. I have spent YEARS in customer service and have NEVER heard of a policy like that EVER. Way to make the customer feel incredibly uncomfortable. We tried to explain to the manager that we were trying to be as courteous as possible and just wanted correct information and the manager just stated that she would have to retrain her staff, but kind of gave us like a ""what do you expect me to do about it now"" attitude. She didn't apologize, didn't offer us anything, didn't negotiate a solution, didn't prompt us to explain or anything

I'm local, and I've stayed here more times than I can count. You can get a great deal on weekend rooms here, but make sure it's in the renovated wing of the hotel. The rooms are clean, smoke-free, and include modern technologies and amenities (large flat screen TV, iPod dock, etc.). You won't find a better deal for this anywhere on the strip. 

It's not in the greatest location if you are a tourist on foot- I'll admit that much. But it is next to the best spot to eat in Vegas: The Peppermill. Don't stay at the Riv without eating here. It's also a B-line to downtown and a hop skip and jump onto the freeway. If you are driving, it's in a great area to bypass the strip traffic. 

Granted, there isn't much to do in the Riv. But, if you are lucky, they'll have someone good playing at their historic comedy club. I've actually seen a lot of good acts here. Also, take a moment to visit the Queen Victoria Pub or the friendly bartenders in the lobby bar by the club. 

Yes, it's old, it aint that pretty, and it smells like smoke, but isn't that Vegas?
I revel in the fact that this casino is outdated and untouched by the renovated glitz of the strip. If you are expecting Cosmopolitan grandeur, than skip this one instead of being a cheap ass and giving this casino a bad review.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,14,5,4,vo6nMQHTpGkNx1nS0YEEiA

I love this hotel and here's why:

** It's a strip-located hotel with a downtown price
** They are renovating the rooms to all have pillow top comfy mattresses and flat screen plasmas.
** Low limits on table games
** Extremely empty gaming areas (I was at a $5 table by myself on a Saturday night)
** Good value poker tournament three times per day
** The fastest valet in Vegas
** Non-smoking room means non-smoking room
** Electronic check in and check out.

Basically it's a great location that has cheap, available gaming, with new-ish rooms.  When there's not enough to offer you here, there are about 15 other mega-resorts to curb your appetite.  You might as well sleep in a decent cheap room and save your benjis for slots, smokes, shopping or strippers.

Sidenote:  Some of the dealers are ancient and basically creepy old men who say inappropriate things.  The rest barely speak English and refuse to tell you the correct basic strategy move - they just say ""it's your money"".  Nice.

If you don't want a room that smells of 60 years of cigarette smoke, like some others complained about, then ask for a non-smoking room like I did.  The bed was comfy, the AC & TV worked, and there's a safe for valuables.

The downside to The Riv is that the casino is where your lungs go to die. You can't sit in any of the restaurants, the food court, of the pinball ""museum"" (just a bunch of old pinball machines clustered around an escalator) if you don't want to breathe in a metric gigaliter's worth of second hand smoke.

Everything costs just a little bit less at this hotel, and the walgreens and CVS are not too far away. Beers at the scary Slots a Fun across the street are only 2 bucks as well.

Also only 2 of the 3 stations were working. It pulled up my reservation but wouldn't let us check in. Back to the long line we went.... 

So we get checked in without any further issues, were given a coupon book (which we didn't use anything in it) and got up the the room (we stayed in a non-smoking, king bed room in the Monaco tower). Everything seemed okay, the room was clean. 

We headed down to the steakhouse for dinner with friends. The food was quite tasty and the service was really good given our big party. After dinner we headed upstairs for some TV and bed.

We headed back up to our room and got ready to go out for the day. We were in town for a wedding so we left about 2 PM. We were gone all afternoon and evening.

When we arrived back at 9:30 PM we couldn't get into our room. We headed downstairs and got new keys but they didn't work either. So back down we went.... The guy behind the desk called the bellhop but he wasn't able to get in the room. We were told they'd call maintenance and security. Neither of them could get in and we were told they'd have to call a locksmith. Ugh.... So we were moved rooms but got a double bed. I called and they moved us again to a single king bed room up on the top floor. We asked to be comped somehow for the trouble and we were told they'd take off 1 of the 2 days resort fees. Whoopdie, $15 off. We headed back out to be with our friends. At 11:30 PM we stopped by the front desk to ask if they had gotten access to our room. My husband asked asked about being comped again and they wiped the 2nd night resort fee. They sent up another maintenance guy who could get in. Finally..... So we gathered all our stuff and headed to the new room. This maintenance guy was the most apologetic of everyone - sad that the maintenance guy seemed more sincere than the front desk. 

Check out the next morning was fairly painless. They had 2 of the 3 self check in/out stations working. They rebooted the one I used just before using it and it worked. But the girl beside me was frozen and couldn't check out.

The bathroom was clean, modern and stocked with Bath & Body soap, lotion, etc. All that and I only spent $40 for the room on priceline (and that was for a Friday night)!!!!

My only complaint would be how early they close down the pool area (7pm on a Friday night) but they have a life guard on staff and in Las Vegas's present economic situation, I guess shutting down the pool early isn't unreasonable.

Boy was I wrong! Sure, former American Idols star Jasmine Trias is featured in this show, but the Society of Seven's  Hawaii based group puts on a fantastic show! This show just opened a few weeks ago, and I'm  honestly quite surprised that the Riviera would step up their game and present a show of this caliber. The venue is actually quite nice because it's a rather intimate venue with plenty of great seats. 

Each of the performers is genuinely talented in their own right. Jasmine was quite distracting with her excessive hand movements (her voice is so pure, she really didn't need to do all of the gesturing), but I suppose it's from her background in hula dancing.

4628216,2014-04-13,4,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"Well, I've been to many hotels in Vegas, and I have to say it's not one of my favorites. But it's not too bad considering the price I paid during my recent stay. I mean $89 per night during NAB conference wasn't bad at all since other hotels close to the convention center were charging over $200 per night.  Since it was a 10 min walk to the convention center, it  also saved me $$ in cab fares, so that was good. 

I like their pool, but I was disappointed that they didn't have a jacuzzi, which I was actually really looking forward to. 

The only thing you have to keep in mind is that there are different towers, and the room in the tower I stayed at was newer, nicer and clear - Monaco Tower. The deals you get on the internet may be great and lower, but usually that means you'll get a room in the older towers. Initially I got a room at the South Tower but I changed it upon check-in. 

Oh and they charge $17 ($15 plus tax) in resort fee per day. Seems like they are charging this fee in most hotels in Vegas now. 

They have $1 - $2 cocktails at the bar which is great. Of course if you're gambling at the bar, then you don't have to pay. 

I ate twice at the restaurants - Banana Leaf and Wicked. They were Ok, servers were better and friendly. 

I almost went to watch the magic show... once a day at 7pm. Tickets start at $75 per person, but if you get the coupon book, they have 2 for one deal and maybe get 2 tickets for $100.  

If you like to gamble, you have a better chance going to Circus Circus across the street. My friends and I lost some money on slot machines at Riviera, but recovered them back at Circus Circus. :-)  I guess it depends on what you play too, but again, I'm not here to encourage or promote gambling! What you do with your money is your own business and at your own will. Like me, Do it for entertainment purpose only! 

Oh, and when you check out, do so in person, not electronically or from the room. And review your bill carefully. Two of my friends got charged for something that they never even purchased including in-room movie! 

So, if you're in Vegas for a show at the convention center and  looking for a clean, reasonably priced, convenient place to stay, this would be the one I'd recommend.",n0wgmo63qQvrdwQbQdbcng,12,2,3,fU_eFRKO3ZLeEHz6p9aphw

Yeah the Casino and pool area are a tad dated, but the ABC store open all night was handy when we came in at 1:30 needing a quick snack to take back to the room. We were able to walk from our hotel down the strip (this was Oct. and in the low 80's, so doable).

4685105,2014-01-28,0,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"So, the long and short of the Riviera is that it's inexpensive, the rooms are clean and reasonably well maintained, and it's near the convention center.  Other than that, it's not much to speak of.  I booked my room well in advance, and neglected to check the rates a few days before my trip.  As it turns out, the rate I booked was a bit higher than what was available the day I traveled.  The front desk was not willing to adjust my rate, and the upgrade they proposed was about $60/day.  Not a show-stopper, but it would have been a nice customer service moment.  

The property is right on the strip, but at the moment it's located in somewhat of a dead zone, since there were a few casinos nearby that closed, a few projects on hold, and not much else.  Location-wise, it's great for the convention center access, a 15 minute walk, but the fun doesn't really start until you get to the Wynn, which is a few blocks away.  

The casino is pretty run of the mill, and more something you'd see downtown these days in Vegas.  They have no poker room, which was a big disappointment. Apparently the nearest poker room was either the Wynn (expensive) or the Las Vegas Hilton, just off the strip.  

I only ate in the hotel once, at the food court, and it was pretty lousy.  They do have a steakhouse that is supposed to be very good, however.  The convenience store they have is pretty well stocked, so if you forget something, they probably have it.  They have a pool area outside, but nothing inside; the pool would probably be a nice option in the summer.  This brings me to the resort fee.  $15/day, basically for so-so WiFi access.  They promote ""free"" use of the in-room safe, local calls, and the fitness center.  Again...just like the airlines...stuff we used to get included is now a la carte.  They provide a coupon book with a number of things you can get for half off, BOGO, etc.  I didn't find them particularly useful.  

Overall, the price is good, and it's certainly not scary, but if you're looking to have an elegant time in Vegas, this place probably isn't for you.  It's a relic of the ""old"" Vegas, and unfortunately it just can't keep pace.  If this place were downtown, it'd fit right in, but on the strip I think it's just biding its time before someone makes the right offer and it's torn down and replaced with something a little more modern.",WIdUAxJqXKp2imC_BfcxMg,2,0,2,e1vnfUmVatRmSZvErmNXYQ

After standing in the interminable line, the lady at the desk kindly offered to let me get a non-smoking room for $20/night extra (!). The room is actually decent, but the bureaucracy will just make you want to tear your eyes out, the casino is a dump, and the resort fee doesn't even include wireless (which is an extra $10/24 hours), as is standard in Vegas in general.

The room was fine (SO SMALL and no ""getting ready"" space (we were in the North Mediterranean tower) but it's just kind of a buzzkill. The casino sucks, it's pretty far away from the newer areas of the strip and all the employees we came across were so dense and not as service oriented as I feel they should be. 

The valet guys told the two people standing next to us (and us at one point) they couldn't find our car.

We were going to stay at another hotel in the suburbs, but then decided it was too far from everything. My friend called hotels.com and booked a room at The Riviera sitting in the other hotel lobby. This room was $39 per night, which was about half the price of the suburbia hotel. 

Honestly, it was okay for what we were doing. Our kids really only cared about swimming, which was where a majority of our time was spent. Is it the most luxurious hotel? No, it's not. It actually will probably need to be updated soon. With the Wynn and Encore on the south side, the new SLS Hotel (used to be Sahara, I believe) to the north and across the street a huge Asian inspired resort hotel...it's only within time that The Riviera and Circus Circus will need to up their game. 
 
Anyways, back to the hotel. It's smaller, which I actually like. I hate trekking across what seems forever in those larger hotels. But I also like the nicer amenities in those hotels. Fluffy towels, cloud-like beds and amazing swimming pools. This is NOT what you're going to get from this hotel. But you kinda get what you pay for. 

When we stayed at the hotel, the blind convention was going on as well as the Junior NBA's. So there was a lot of people with dogs and teenagers running around the hotel. I'd say that this isn't the spot to kick it...but if you're looking to sleep, shower and pre-game at a good price, you can do it here. If I'm on a budget, I might come back. But I seriously love staying in nice hotels, so I probably won't be back until they upgrade.

The hallways to the rooms were narrow and low. The hallways can trigger a sense of claustrophobia within you and the ceilings are very low, which is a disaster for tall people. The ceilings were about 7 inches above me and it made me feel like the ceiling was going to lower down on me.

I bought a Groupon for $78 and thought I was getting a fabulous deal! The photo looked like maybe they cleaned the place up a bit and the extras were cool ($20 slot play, 2 free welcome drinks, 2 tickets to the comedy show) so I bought it. 

I got into town on Sunday at 4pm and was originally given a room at the North Tower. Ummm...Wet spot on the carpet (I didn't know if it was a blood stain, piss or just a spill or maybe a pitcher of beer), pubic hair plastered on the back of the bathroom door and the stench. WOW! For it not being a non-smokers room, it sure the hell smelled like a dingy old bar!! When I attempted to take a shower, the shower water didn't go down. Basically I was up to my ankles in Vegas sweat and the black sediment starting coming up from the drain. 

I complained and was told that they would give me a new room. Downstairs I go at 1am to collect a new key. I was then told I would be staying in a totally different tower. OK - Here I go....

15-minutes into my stay in my 2nd room I spot something crawling up the wall. Ummm...yeah, a baby cockroach. I killed it and called the front desk. After a 7-minute hold time I decided to walk myself, my daughter and the dead bug down to speak with management one-on-one. I showed the kid behind the counter my findings and I said ""If there's one, there's more"". His response ""not necessarily"". WHAT? Are you kidding me?! I was then directed to the manager where I told her the problem and she gave me a different room. No apology, no comped drink (s), no breakfast...Nothing. Come on now, at least an apology!! So we were given another room where we slept uneasy. I checked out as early as I could the next day. I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there.

Just don't eat at the asian restaurant - I should've run across the street and had McDonalds - the quality would've been better.  We also bought monorail passes - it's about 2/3 of a mile to the Las Vegas Hilton station if you cut through the parking lot, and that gives you a little bit of walking to help exercise away the calories that you put on eating in this town, plus access to the further away casinos for much cheaper and less trafficky than cabs or the deuce bus.",dKA5pV924YpE3zmAzShLcw,3,1,3,5c1tcgcxy59wFM3b0o5yHw

My girlfriends and I stayed in the Monaco Tower, which I beleive is one of the newer towers there. It was decorated very modern and it had a flat screen TV, but the room was small and so was the bathroom for 3 girls to be sharing. The air conditioner sucked if you left it on for too long. But thank god we went to Vegas on a weekend where it was not to hot and muggy. So we managed. They have no issues with giving you extra towels.

The pool areas is nice, but you better get there early to reserve a chair. Which really stunk cause chair reservation should not be allowed especially when their are more chairs reserved than people in the pool or around the pool. I actually talked to the towel man and asked him if it was allowed to reserved a chair and he said no, so I made myself comfortable in someone elses chair and when they came 2 hours later, they just looked at me and kept moving to look for more seating....lol

The bar by the pool serves really good strawberry margarita, if your looking to have a virgin margarita.

Check in was a hassel since there was a long line and they use these automated check in services, but yet there is no one at the front desk to show those people who are not as computer savy how to use the machines, so those peopel held up the line.

The carpet is old and dated looking, bar servers look like they have been doing their job at least 30-40 years, and even the food court is old and dab.  So why the 3 stars? They have one of the coolest attractions that the fancy and new hotel and casinos don't have; vintage pinball machines and arcade games! 

Yes, I grew up at the arcade with my siblings.  First watching my brother play Galaga and Pac Man, and my sister working her way to becoming a pinball wizard.  Soon, I wished I was a pinball wizard.  The Riviera has about 20-25 pinball machines and it's an annex of the Pinball Hall of Fame located east of Tropicana.  There are change machines to get quarters and games are 50 or 75 cents.  Some offer 3 games/$2.  

They have the vintage machines with no ramps and a few bumpers to the newer games like Batman and Lord of the Rings.  I played a few and liked the ones where I could get to play multiple balls.

They also had Frogger, Donkey Kong, and a few other arcade games.  I spent $3 here, and it lasted me way longer than playing a slot machine and I had more fun.   There are 2 massage chairs too, so if your spouse/partner isn't a pinball fan they can sit back.  But the wifi connection isn't great here and you are likely better off to use the McDonald's network (it's across the street).

5099533,2012-01-19,3,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"This was my first time ever booking a hotel online so I would like to point out some tips for nubcakes like myself: 

1) Even though you're booking a night for the same exact day, online prices will change from week to week. Keep that in mind when looking for a deal. 
2) Booking a hotel from its actual website will only give you access to the highest available price they offer. It's best to scrounge around for some other sites that will allow you to book at other hotels. 
3) Hotels do not reserve your non-smoking or smoking request (either that or Rivieria doesn't do that at all). 
4) There is a hidden facility fee (at least Riviera hid this from me) that they will charge you at the front desk when you check into your room (it costs around $9). 

Now that my online-hotel booking cherry has been popped, let's talk about the Riviera. First off, it's one of the cheapest (if not the cheapest) main hotels on the Las Vegas strip. I paid $128 for a night (not including the hidden facility fee). However, you really get what you pay for. 

The rooms themselves have a relatively effete view of the strip. However, the beds are comfortable enough. The room service is average and I had no idea where to get extra towels. They have a pool but no jacuzzi! 

I had the opportunity to eat at the in-house buffet which gets a two star rating from me. My most memorable moment involved me raising my hand to get the waitress' attention as I was absolutely parched. She looked at me and said, ""Don't you do that."" My cronies and I were in a curious quandary because we could not figure out how I was being rude. Her rude attitude continued for the entire time we were there. Now every time I raise my hand for anything, my friends will promptly look at me and say, ""Don't you do that."" 

The food itself is typical of a veritable plethora of buffets: average. If anything, always forage for a section that includes a chef cooking food right in front of you. Fortunately, this buffet had such a chef. This convivial cooker served us some sumptuous omelets. I responded with a dollar tip for his services.

I spent 3 nights here in December. My buddy's mom works for another hotel (which shall remain nameless) but on short notice she was able to get a ridiculously cheap deal at the Riviera. I was expecting a lot worse based on some of the reviews, honestly.

I only ever came in through the lobby and went straight up to my room - we walked through the casino once (and I was inebriated enough to not care that it was deserted on a Friday night). It was old but clean, and my room was reasonably nice. Sure, the bathroom was obviously from maybe the 80s at the oldest, but Christ people, it's a lot of money to renovate a whole hotel when it all still works.This is not the Hilton or Four Seasons. Anyway, it was clean, the beds were comfy, we had a flat-screen TV and iHome dock, there were towels/soap/shampoo. I was pleased with the place.

The only real downside to me was the neighborhood - in Vegas, you don't want to drive between the traffic and impending inebriation, and this was NOT a nice area to walk through. It was about 2 blocks of ""Oh my God, we're going to get mugged"" before we reached the Wynn and the real strip.

The room we stayed in was in the Monaco Tower which is newly decorated and very nice. The hotel itself is yes, a little run down but that's to be expected from one of the older hotels in Vegas. 

The issue I am having currently is with the Customer Service at the Riviera Hotel & Casino. My Nephew (15 yrs. old) was staying w/ us in the room and he has Juvenile Diabetes. I specifically remember him bringing his supplies (diabetic needles, insulin, etc.) which by the way he keeps in a shoe box..boys..he he...bringing it to our room and setting it on the table Friday night. Saturday Morning he ate breakfast, took a shot, and we left the room to venture out for the day. Later on when we returned to the room we noticed that when it was time to eat dinner that we could not find the ""shoebox"" in the room. We looked everywhere!
It was gone so we took the next step to running around town to find a pharmacy that had the supplies we needed. After 2 hrs of running around Vegas we got the insulin and needles to give him a shot after we ate. I kept the receipts and brought it down the next morning when I went to check out. 

I spoke to the manager at check out and felt really bad but said that I would have to file a report at security. I did as requested and they gave me the Risk Manager's (La Cretia Evans) card and said she would call me on Monday.

5156317,2012-07-06,4,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"First of all let me give you some background. I have been coming to this Hotel ""Motel"" every few years since the mid 80's. The only reason i ever started coming here is that my uncle used to play in pool tournaments at this ""Motel"". Back then it was really a matter of the cheapest room rates we could find and the fact that the pool tournament was held in the Riviera convention center. Even back then this place seemed old and out of date. 

In recent years we have stayed at other Hotels at the other end of the strip so i had not seen the Riv in several years. Needless to say NOTHING has changed for the better. 

1) They have moved the front desk area to a different location that i think is 50% the size of the old location. The lines to check in/out are constantly backed up. When we checked in Sat night at 11pm there was still a line of at least 12 people and only 3 employees working. It seemed as though each of them was on their first days work as it took them forever to check people in.

2) Resort Fee: They now charge a ""Resort"" Fee of $11/day. Our total was $99 for the week. Nowhere in our package deal were we told of this additional fee. So we pay the ""Resort"" Fee and later ask several different employees where the ""Resort"" is because from the looks of things this is NOT a ""Resort"". The employees look at us strange and say Oh! that's for the pool and free wi-fi. OK, there is a pool here but from asking the people who dared enter it, the water was cold. Do they even heat the pool at all? Granted it was 110 this week but straight outta the tap cold water is a bit chilly. Don't forget the pool closes at 8pm.

3) Free Wi-Fi: So supposedly part of your ""Resort"" Fee is the Free Wi-Fi. Sounds good, right? NOT! The Wi-Fi is terribly slow and looses connection frequently. I noticed this the first night while trying to remote in to my home computer. I called the front desk and asked where the best spot was for the Wi-Fi connection. I expected them to say the lobby or the cafe or something on the main floor but instead the woman told me that ""umm well there is no Wi-Fi anywhere but the rooms"". She also said sometimes you can get a connection out at the pool. As i am writing this, my brother was typing up a long reply to a Craigslist Ad and he went to send it and the connection was lost and so was the whole long reply he was typing up.

4) Smelly hallways: As we reached our floor, the first night, we exited the elevator and there was a strong smell of Marijuana in the air. We don't smoke it but do know what it smells like. As we traveled down the hallway we saw a police officer and the maids standing in the hallway with a rooms door open. They must have thrown someone out and were cleaning the room at midnight. They were vacuuming at midnight, we could not believe it.

5) Smelly Entrance: Several times we noticed a horrible odor when leaving the lobby doors to go out to the parking structure. It smelled like a grease trap overflow. For those who have never worked in the restaurant business. The grease trap is where all the solids and grease collects after it goes down the drain. There is bacteria that eats this rotting food but when it can't keep up the trap overflows and you get to smell all the rotting food that has been sitting there churning. That is what it smelled like several times as we walked out of the main doors. 

6) No clean sheets: We have been here for almost a week now and the maids have been in 4 times and made the beds but didn't change the sheets. The first couple times i thought they had but then i noticed the same black mark on my white sheets. It was there every day. They would come in and leave new towels and make the beds but not use clean sheets. Honestly i don't care because i would rather maids not come in my room at all while I'm staying somewhere but for some reason our ""Do Not Disturb"" signs would vanish and we would have ""made beds"" when we returned. Makes me wonder if it is just the maids themselves taking the signs off to gain access to my room or other peoples rooms. 

7) Food amenities: Years ago when i would come here you could either hit up the food court or the regular restaurant until later in the night. Now both of them seem to close very early. I was told by one employee that the restaurant closes at 7pm. Well that is after telling me 6pm then 6:30pm, he finally settled on 7pm. It's bad when the guy inside the restaurant could not even tell us what time the place closed. So we went to the New Asian restaurant and had 2 entrees and 2 sodas and our total was $40. Now when i say entree i mean rice with a chicken dish and rice with a beef dish. Anywhere else i would pay less that $10 each. The other option was a British type bar that sold a few food items that we thought were overpriced bar food. Oh, wait! They do have a $20+ dollar a plate steak house that we never saw anyone enter. They did have a nice dressed Host and Hostess though.

Unfortunately, they will be. I took one look around here, interacted with a few scowling, unfriendly, unhelpful staff members, and decided I'd rather fork out the one night's cancellation and relocate to the Hilton across the street than spend two nights here. Three people who didn't told me how smart I was. You've been warned. It's depressing; filled with people gambling away their social security checks and chain smoking.

At that price we were happy with whatever we got considering it was a weekend trip. The Riviera is definitely a no-frills casino hotel. The rooms were meh- dated and dark but I did like the big silly golden bathtub. The area around it is REALLY sketchy and I got like eye-raped by bums every time I walked out of the casino alone. The food at all the restaurants is bad and walking around that part of the strip at night is so scary that you need to make sure you keep snacks in your room or that you get full elsewhere before you turn in for the night- no waking up for mid-night or 4am snacks!

It's a 'meh' kinda place all the way around but if you can get a room as cheap as we did you should definitely go for it.",8BTBEQ7beYl54Zd6HhRleQ,5,3,2,LUNDeWNr7fYSb7-1tBX2vw

Even the television barely works if you can get the remote to change channels. This toe fungus of a hotel is not suited for business in any form.

Aesthetically the place is a total cornhole, the lobby looks like it's maintained by an 80+ aged crew and the carpet is disgusting. I recommend shoes when walking around this place especially if you're coming from or going to the pool. It attracts a much younger, ghetto and less experienced Vegas crowd due to its lower prices, with this also comes a less quality employee crew however.

I booked my room 3 months in advance thinking ""how bad could this place be for 1 night"", cheap and close to the Convention Center. I get into the line and I'm told I could use the ""express check-in"" by 2 attendants. It didn't work for me so the attendant checked my room which wasn't ready so she changes my room, OK there's a little bit of ""service"" there I thought.

I get to the tower and it already smells like a donkey farm, the elevator seemed like something out of a Final Destination movie. Once I get on the floor there's phone books in front of the doors all along the hallway to my room I'm thinking ""is this the prostitute path or something""? I get to my room which smells like smoking monkeys had been living in it, the ashtrays confirmed it was a smoking room. 

I call the front desk who helps me out with a ""regular"" non smoking room which was better. However feel free to look at my pictures from the room (e.g. the neverending toilet, the ""beautiful"" views and the mystery wet spot).",-swb4erZ_qzDoIF5zO9h6Q,2,0,1,ZVBTGEzb1xqIuPfGwrODJQ

I chose this hotel because it was the cheapest on the strip.  
When I arrived, I was told that all the non-smoking rooms were sold out and I would be put in a smoking room.  I was not happy about this at all.  The person at the front desk told me that the room is the same, should not smell like smoke and the only difference would be ash trays in the room.  It seemed I had to put some sense into that woman and explain to her, ""of course the room would smell like smoke, the smell would be in all the curtains, bed linens and carpet and I have strong allergic reactions."" I requested to speak to a manager, the attendant left for 10mins.  When she returned, she explained that I would be upgraded to a petite suite, non-smoking.  Honestly, I was greatly appreciative and gladly took the upgrade.  The room smelled ""old"", like it has not been used in years.  The room had an extra sink near the bed and the water backed up a few times (but did not overflow) and left a strong sulfur odor in the room.  I did not report it, because I came to Vegas to see the sights not spend time in the room.

The valet service and check in was mediocre, but I could tell that they were super backed up. I think they have a staffing issue at Riviera. Maybe it's time to call a hospitality consulting company? Gotta keep up with all the new hotels on the strip!

I maybe waited 5 minutes to check-in this time. They have moved the check-in desk to the back of the building and it looks A LOT better. They have also moved the cab station and valet to that area as well. The room was ok. The ceiling had a small patch of plaster flaking off and the tub could have been a little cleaner. As usual all of the staff I encountered were great. Always willing to help. Got a great deal on my room. I still suggest getting a players card,at any casino, because that does help with the cost.

Firstly, I read a lot of reviews on here before my trip and I noticed that a lot of people complained about ticky tacky stuff like holes in the lampshades, scuffs on the tables, scratches/scrapes on the walls, etc. If you go to Vegas and are only paying $50 - $70 per night, you shouldn't expect a Bellagio-esque room. My room wasn't perfect, but it's really just a place to sleep so it didn't have to be very good.

I parked my car in the structure, and checked in. Just outside the doors and inside the lobby has a foul smell of dirty diapers, but it is what it is.

Casino only has 12 or so table games, and a lot of slots. But they do have the wildly popular $1 blackjack table. You will likely have to wait to get a spot (up to 2 hours on one occasion for me), but it's nice once you get a seat. As long as you tip the waitress, she'll keep bringing Coronas, Jack-and-Cokes, wine, etc. So you get your moneys worth in drinks.

Waitresses are a little over the hill and a sight for sore eyes. Woof!

Since the place has been around since forever, the clientele reflects that. There's a lot of old geese and plenty of riff raff that comes through the doors.

Overall, I'd probably go back if for nothing else than the $1 blackjack table and the relatively affordable room rates.",bNAuB2AIucQ50bnCoOc9nA,2,0,3,G0A-KIr70CLuCdkvUChetA

Overall:
Pros - Much nicer than I expected from all the grim reviews.
Cons - But, it's still an antiquated down-market hotel that needs help, but not as bad a Circus Circus, which smells really bad.

Room:
Pros - New room that was well-appointed with no smells.
Cons - Lousy TV channel selection, especially no Food Network or Travel Channel.  And, it was pretty noisy at night either listening to the screaming AC unit or loud music.  Plan on using earplugs.

WiFi:
Pros - free!
Cons - spotty connectivity

Parking:
Pros - free
Cons - hard to find any open slots after 10pm  ;-(

Service:
Pros - Helpful and pleasant staff
Cons - Poor follow-up, especially with housekeeping service 

Food:
Pros - large portions
Cons - restaurants in hotel were not so great.  In the Food Court, La Salsa and Indian Masala were pretty good.  But, it's pretty cheesy 80's mall-like ambiance.

Pub:
Pros - nice setting and respectable English beers
Cons - bartenders were totally disorganized and it took a long time to get a drink and/or bill (we visited 4x on this trip and kept hoping they'd get it together... nope!)

Value:
We stayed here because our conference was booked here.  For the $55 group rate /night  it was OK.  But, after a couple of days, we longed to get out and visit other hotels.   (FYI - the Encore is only a 10 minute walk away!)

It's a little far down on the strip but if you aren't lazy it's a 10-15 min walk to just about the middle of the strip or you can walk to LVH which is next door and take the monorail (which is what I normally do) or if you don't mind spending the money take a $10-20 cab ride. 

The place is huge so make sure you follow the signs above you or just ask someone who works there. I never had an issue with the staff I've stayed there 3+ times and will continue going back. 

The wait time to check-in is long if you check-in after 3pm but so is pretty much EVERY hotel on the strip so just expect to wait a little bit.

Two Full Size Beds, desk, small windows, good individual air conditioner (not central) and a tall but useless dresser.

The good: 
Stayed in the slightly larger and renovated room in the Monaco Tower.
No bed bugs!
Beds were very comfortable but very hot, they couldn't keep my body heat down like the beds at the Tropicana.
They allowed me to check in at 2:45 pm and not 4 pm (the standard time)
It's one of the last old school casino's and I loved that (built in 1955).
The check in associate was SOOO nice and attentive, I forget the old man's name but he was awesome and so informative.
The hotel room did not smell at all, muy bueno.
Bathroom, all the basins/mirrors were clean
The check out associate give me the manager's direct extension in case I had any issues (I asked what to do if I didn't feel the room was up to par). I did have to use it and he picked up immediately.

The bad: 
Check in time: 40 minutes.
Bathroom: the corner's on the floor were dusty and the floor looked like it needed a good wash. 
The shower looked very old (and I was in a renovated room).
$8 resort fee and I didn't use ANY amenities
$10 internet fee per DEVICE not room - Spoke to the Manager, he said they are working on dropping the contract with LodgeNet to have their own internet which would be included in the resort fee.
The garage elevator was down right scary, I thought my life was in danger, it was dingy, dirty & rickety.
The Monaco Tower elevator was 10 times better, but still leaves a lot to be desired, it was dirty but would be really charming if clean.
SUPER tiny refrigerator, still better than the Trop which had none.

--Saw the cleaning lady chillen in a room she was ""cleaning"" for about an hour, hey, we all need a break every once in a while!
--People watching here is priceless. A guy in front of me in check-in line was chugging down his 40, NO SHAME...my peoples, haha. I decided to join in on the fun and had a bud light lime while waiting! The crowd here is definitely full of character.

I'm pretty upset I didn't have time to play at the BlackJack tables, I can't stand the $10+ minimum tables (it's even higher in Charles Town, WV and Atlantic City). If I recall correctly, they had $2 BJ tables and 3:2 odds (which are better supposedly).

50 years ago, I imagine the Riv and the Stardust, just down the street, were hot spots. Time has not been kind. Now the Riv features entertainers who impersonate Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond. It is also the home of Crazy Girls, ""Las Vegas' Sexiest Topless Revue,"" which is immortalized in seven brass asses outside the casino entrance. A recent addition to the lineup is American Storm, the male strip troupe which comprises the winners of VH1's ""Strip Search.""

The Riv is also home to the saddest looking cocktail waitresses in town. These girls have been ridden hard and put away wet, after which they seem to have shrunk several sizes. This appearance is accentuated by the oversized black T-shirt they wear, which bears the slogan, ""Rack and Roll."" Referring, in this case, to billiards and craps, not prostitution. The ""Rack"" is cunningly located over the breasts of the few girls that have them. Perhaps they don't want to compete with the Crazy Girls revue.

Two sections of the casino are dedicated to more frugal gamblers: Nickel Heaven and Penny Town. As you might guess, the electronic games in those areas play at those denominations. Actually, in Penny Town, you can wager 1, 2 or 5 cents, for those feeling particularly flush. While Nickel Heaven is just part of the regular casino, there is no escape from Penny Town. You walk down a short hall to access it, and the only way out is back the way you came or out into the street.

the housekeeping lady is absolutely a sweetheart -- so can't complain there. The wifi will not work, even though you call 5 times for them to come and fix it and they promise they will but it won't. i dont care for wifi but since i had my teenager sister with me who can't gamble, you can see why the wifi was important.

the check in lady failed to tell me my card was going to get charged $238! 
i am so angry, i could drive the 300 miles to go and speak to a manager in person and tell them to hire better staff. 
So, i got my room through groupon, i made the mistake of not booking two nights, i get that. i was under the impression that i did book two nights so when i first checked in i asked if this was true, i was told IT WAS-- check in lady: ""you are booked for two rooms THROUGH groupon"" when i checked out, same situation: Check in lady:  ""you will only be charged the $39 hotel fee, but your 2 nights were charged through groupon"" i said-- "" are you sure, only $39 will get charged"" --- check in lady: ""yes of course here is your receipt""

just got off the phone with the manager and of course there is nothing they can do.

Moments, we are driving to a very old section of Las Vegas. I don't mind that classic feel, but when it's no longer maintained and businesses appear to be gone as well, it's quite depressing.

Arrival to the Riviera... .... ....

I've driven over 4 hours to arrive to a line with at least 50 people, so I'm sorta expecting a fun and entertaining counter to get my mood swinging UP! Check-in counter employees do not appear happy or mad, but they are quite depressing to deal with. They seem to be sick of their job. 

I will never reserve a room here again. It is bad. My non-smoking room smelled so bad, I felt healthier breathing in the casino floor and/or hallways! The AC couldn't be adjusted to be comfortable, so it was either blistering cold A/C or hot HEAT. The unit didn't seem to be drawing fresh air either. The standard room's bathroom is small, and I couldn't hang my towels because the hanging mounts were all broken. The toilet barely flushes. The sink water has strong pressure, at least. The 1950's had it very well, but they can no longer compete with casinos on the strip. I would book Circus Circus before giving this place another shot.

I should have snapped a picture of the air filter (they actually have one!!) located inside our room. Last I checked, filters are meant to be replaced, not in continuous service while the white filter media is BLACK!!!!!!!!!

Why did I book this? It was the cheapest rate at the time (still above $120). However, it is off the strip, very depressing, and just not a place to dwell. The casino floors, however, was active and appears OK. They had one (1) Pai Gow table on a Saturday (9th) November, and people playing that night (8PM to 4AM Sunday) all received a FAT 5-ACES bonus for betting on the ENVY. 4 players received $1,000, and the 5-ACES hand landed on the Dragon Hand.

You would not believe the PIT BOSSES faces. They made us feel that we didn't deserve to win. They scrutinized the dealer at the time of win, and came back to ask more questions 3 hours later (after shift rotation)! Unfortunately, they weren't expecting to payout that much on a single Pai Gow table and it was clear that they were hurting that night. 

At the cashier, I was asked ""where did you win all this money""? I mean they were all on high alert since the table payout was $4,000 in bonus payout, and many bonuses throughout the period.

On May 4th, The Riviera will be the newest addition to the list of long-gone Strip classics. Thus leaving the building of the Sahara (now known as SLS), the Tropicana and the Flamingo (which doesn't even really count since not really any of it's original structure is left, but I digress) as the only pre-1960s or ""Rat Pack"" era places left. 

Okay, I'm going to let everyone know this isn't going to be the most conventional review, but here goes:

The Riviera first opened it's doors on April 20th, 1955 (this year will mark it's 60th anniversary, mere weeks before it's closure). It's notable if only for being the first ""high rise"" on the strip (with a mere nine stories) and Liberace's personal favorite place to perform and hang out in Vegas. Architecturally speaking, the original facade and older towers (now known as the Mediterranean and San Remo towers) were once fantastic examples of mid-century modern architecture. The expansions over the years didn't really complement them unfortunately, but it was still really nice to always look at The Riviera and be able to imagine the type of aesthetic that most hotels on The Strip went for in the 50s and the 60s. 

Okay, for the sake of being unbiased, I will admit that yes, the place has indeed seen better days. I stopped by for a visit about a week ago and here are my observations: The decor of the casino is stuck in the 80s. The club, the entertainment options, the food court and the shops are all strange and unusual at best. Some parts of the place (especially the second floor, the vicinity of the historic Versailles Theater and the shopping arcade that leads toward the convention center) feel really desolate and eerie. The pool area feels plain by today's standards, but I feel with a little tweak it could become a retro-style, Palm Springs-ish paradise. Some would say it's beyond repair, but people were saying the same things about the Tropicana, the Plaza, the El Cortez and the Sahara a few years ago. Take a look at those places now. 

What's happening to it? The convention center plans on using the property for an expansion and transit hub. I for one am not holding my breath on that. The people behind the LVCC have been talking about expanding for YEARS and yet they never do. They even had the Landmark imploded only to replace it with a parking lot. Even if they are to be held to their word this time, that still means that for at least a couple of months (if not possibly a year, seeing that they don't plan on finishing this expansion until 2017/2018) that just means another plot of vacant land on the barren wasteland that is the North Strip. And frankly, I'm seriously upset by that. We STILL have yet to see anything built on the former sites of Wet n' Wild or the Frontier. Abandoned construction plots like Echelon and Fontainebleau continue to rot away. 

And it's like, it was really only a matter of time before the north strip was going to see action again. The Sahara reopened as the SLS last year. An amphitheater/events center is being built on the long vacant land across the street for Rock In Rio. The former site of the Holy Cow is currently being developed as a mini-mall. I'm not holding my breath on Resorts World, but that's a different discussion for a different day. My point is, why not let this little bit of light continue to shine as the North Strip steadily rebuilds? To me all it feels like is a sabotage of development, however brief it may be. Do people not seriously think that people look at the north side of the Strip and think ""WTF happened here?"" Because believe me, a lot of us (local and tourist) really do.

The Final Verdict

Pros:
The place is closing either way so does it really matter?

Cons:
See above

Suggestions:
Why not implode the Fontainebleau? Even if the construction project will generate a gain of 6,000 jobs versus a loss of 1,000, there will STILL be job loss. And ideally speaking, it's going to be at least several months before ground is broken. So why not get rid of an actual eyesore that's not doing anyone any favors?
You could also buy the plot of land next to it where Wet n' Wild used to be. With a convention center expansion and transit hub between SLS and the Riviera, there would finally be synergy on the North side of the Strip again!
But oh, that's right, I'm dealing with Vegas developer logic. Tearing down and replacing functioning, older buildings takes priority over building on vacant lots or doing away with something that's actually completely useless like mothballed construction sites. 
I suppose they need to get rid of it either way to appease everyone who's oh so offended by the presence of anything built before the 90s. That's that post-1980s Vegas local/transplant/clueless tourist logic.

5450984,2010-12-15,2,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"So here is my experience while staying at this dump. Me and 3 other friends wanted to go to Las Vegas for a quick 4 day Weekend Vacation. We looked for a flight and hotel deal on expedia and found the Riviera listed as a package deal for $800 a person. We looked around and also saw that the bellagio was listed for $1000 a person. 

We thought it be better if we spend the $200 difference in Las Vegas than on the hotel. The pictures of the riviera looked nice and it was also on the ""strip"" so we thought how bad could it be. Well we arrived in Las Vegas on Thursday morning and got a cab to the Riviera. While riding on the cab we saw that we passed the bellagio, Caesar palace and all the other famous Hotels. We arrived at the riviera and went on to check in, we had to walk through the casino to the front desk. The casino is very smoky and you will cough alot if you don't smoke (which none of us does). We arrived at the front desk and it had about 100 people in line and only two people were working the desk. We waited for about 2 hours to check in which was crazy. We went up to our rooms which looked like rooms at motel 6 and had a very depressing view of some construction site. One of the rooms had a heater that was making a noise, we called maintenance and they came up to fix it. After about half hour of working on it the guy had it fixed. We asked what was wrong with it, his reply was ""Thats what they pay me to know"". What a douche!!! 

We were hungry so looked for a place to eat, we thought about trying the buffet but it looked crappy so we had some sandwiches which by the hardness of the bread where at least 3 days old. Also another thing, the shops in this place are a joke, its like a flee market. They have some guys selling knockoff sun glasses,cheap luggage, fake pearls and other useless stuff. The only good store is the ABC grocery store, which is really great and not that expensive. After we ate we went to walk on the strip, we realized how far this dump is from everything else. 

We spend about 100 bucks on cab fare just the first day because this place was so far away from everything. All the good stuff is happening around caesar palace,bellagio,paris, venetian and so on. Another thing about this hotel is that there are almost no young people there, its all seniors. The restaurants, bars that are inside the hotel are always dead. The food court is just nasty. They have no free wifi and plus they charge you a $8 resort fee for each room. What resort are they talking about???? I think they mean the swimming pool that was closed! We had to rent a car because cab fare was getting expensive. We then found out that valet parking at our hotel was always full at any time. I asked on of the valet how the hell is the valet always full, he told me that they only have 100 valet spots but about 3000 rooms. Which Idiot thought of this great idea???

5468259,2015-03-09,0,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"I should mention first and foremost, the Riviera is going to close soon. It will be demolished and turned into a convention center. Based on my latest experience there, they either deserve it or don't care because of it... My friends and I stayed here last year and had a much better time. That's why we chose to return. Unfortunately, the experience was very different.

My first example of this is no more real perks. They still offer a coupon book and ""rewards"" card, but the coupons don't amount to much and the rewards are a bit of a stretch to attain. The offer no specials for occasions. Which was disappointing since we went over my birthday. At the end of the day you get two uncomfortable (labeled double but actually twin) beds and that's about it.

The second issue I had was with the general staff. From the tables to the bartender to the housekeeping staff, no one really cares or shows any sort of initiative. Granted, I know they're shutting down, but if I worked for an establishment in the area, I wouldn't consider them for a position with that attitude or lack of work ethic. A few examples of this - when we requested a plunger for our bathroom because the toilet, which was running poorly from the start, stopped working - no one arrived. It took us over 3hrs to get service! When we went to the bar for a $1.00 (which turned out to be $1.50/+tax) drink our bill would constantly vary - even if it was the same exact order. The point of complaining or commenting was a waste of time. When dealing the sports booking area or general wait staff you'd receive the same nonchalant apology. Even if it was with management. It was honestly sad.

As for a amenities, you know going into if you're not getting much hospitality-wise. It's one of the cheaper places on the strip and that is known through advertising. The sad part is they have shut down tables that we were expecting play from last year and raised prices on certain products. The general ambiance on the casino is a bit grimy, but doable if you want to save the $10-20 per night for a slightly better casino/hotel.

For positives, I truly don't have much. It's fair priced to be ""on the strip"". In reality though, you still have walk a little more than a few blocks to start seeing what you want to see from The Strips image. The other thing I'll mention is two employees: Lany from the Cashier department & Adrienne who worked in table games. I hope I spelled their names correctly, and they deserve all the credit in the world. Amidst or less than average experience they, they remained pleasant, positive, and upbeat. Even to the fact their business would be closing, they are making the most of it. Good for them, and I sincerely wish them luck in the future.

I would say I don't recommend this place, but if truly doesn't matter. It won't be around much longer, and clearly it shows. I am sorry to those losing work and hope the new center offers new opportunities, but I have been born & raised to make the most of situations. To make a multi-hundred attendance of guests get poor service or feel like you're wasting their time because of external circumstances neither fair nor fun for anyone involved.",IobeHGCvzy4QUQ74oGj7cg,4,0,2,sKhXm35ggQ2ogZNxWPLntg

I had no bed bug problems either in these newer rooms and the cleaning staff was very good. That being said, this hotel does attract an older crowd or families with kids.

What I do have a qualm about is being harassed by little dirt bags trying to sell timeshare. Apparently the Riviera has some sort of partnership with a timeshare investment company called ""TLC"". They station their representatives in a central location by the check-in desk and harass young couples. One of their little cretins ran up to my girlfriend and I and told us that he would give us free tickets to a show. We asked what the catch was, in which he told us there was ""absolutely no catch"". He then proceeded to tell us that we would get comped free show tickets and a food voucher if we sat in on a 1 hour presentation the next day (wait, I thought there was no catch?). 

After we kindly said no and tried walking away, the TLC representative became very aggressive and told us ""Are you guys really that dumb? You guys are going to pass on an opportunity like this?"" I googled this company and they have a lot of consumer complaints and scam alerts. Looks like I'm not the dumb one, sir, you are for pedaling this crap for a living :)

In my previous review, I wrote about the dismal, understaffed piece of crap ""welcome"" one always receives when checking into this relic from the early days of Vegas sitting at the northern end of the Strip. I even received a sincere reply on yelp from the owner! But his words were nothing but empty fluff when, on our recent trip, we were so insulted, offended and disgusted at our treatment that we walked out on their clueless asses and into the amazing, welcoming arms of the Excalibur front desk staff.

On Tuesday July 29th, our flights to Florida to visit my mom all got screwed up due to weather so we decided to hunker down overnight in Vegas and figure out a remedy on the following day. Our ""go to"" place has always been the Riviera, because it's cheap and easy to drive to on Paradise, although there is nothing much to love about it anymore as I said in my previous review.

My wife easily booked us a room at the Riv using the internet on her cell phone, and it appeared there was a lot of availability. We taxied over and walked in around 7:30 pm.

As usual, there was a long, barely moving line and only 2 or 3 people behind the front desk at any given time. Also as usual, the 2 or 3 people were constantly leaving their stations and disappearing behind the door to their rear for long periods of time.

As usual the 3 check-in kiosks (which print room keys) were unused with nobody pointing them out to the exasperated guests.

My wife and I knew about them so we checked in and went up to our room, completely exhausted and spent, and immediately heard what sounded like 6 drunken idiots in the next room, screaming, banging and completely disturbing the peace in our room.

As usual, when we called the front desk nobody picked up after 150 rings. As usual, when we dragged our exhausted carcasses back down, the line had barely moved and there was still almost no sign of anyone doing anything behind the front desk.

So, seeing as how we were starving, we decided to go out and eat at one of our favorite Thai restaurants and then come back and change rooms, on the chance that the line would be shorter.

When we got back, we waited the line out and were eventually helped by a snarky, slimy blonde-guy with an ingratiating smile, who wouldn't know the meaning of hospitality if it shot up his hindquarters on a rocket-propelled popsicle stick. He had to take each one of our concerns behind the aforementioned door, and discuss them with some supervisorial no-sayer, who was unsympathetic to all of them. We were informed that there weren't any rooms they could move us to (my wife immediately proved he was lying by finding tons of them on her cell phone) and that ""noise complaints"" weren't a legitimate reason to change rooms, but that we could call Security as often as we liked (and the slimy asswipe wrote down the # for Security for us) until things quieted down. I told him that wasn't my style and that we needed to talk to his Supervisor.

The Supervisor was a youngish guy in a suit who confirmed that there were no rooms he could move us to, and that noise complaints didn't cut it for a reason to move. We told him we were leaving and to credit our room charges back to our credit card. 

He said no!!! He said that we had checked in a few hours earlier and that it was too late for a refund, but that it was our remarkable luck that he suddenly DID have other rooms available. We told him that we hadn't used the room at all, that we would contest the charges on our credit card and that we were leaving right then.

He looked deep in thought for a moment and then said if we would wait, he would physically walk up to the room and look at it to make sure we hadn't disturbed anything and if that was the case, he'd refund our money after all. So we stood there for another 20 minutes. He said the room looked fine and did refund our credit card.

We taxied over to the Excalibur where it looked like 50 smiling, amazing people were staffing the front desk! We told our guy our story and he immediately upgraded us to an amazing remodeled room with a hot tub and lavished us with good vibes, hospitality, sympathy and friendliness.

Though it is one of the oldest original casino/hotels, you can definitely see the difference in it compared to the newer flashy more expensive hotels. However, it was great and the price was phenomenal! We stayed in the Monaco tower on the 15th floor. There was a bit of a smell outside 8 doors walking down the hall and my guess is they quickly realized it because it was gone by our second evening there. If you want to pay over $75 a night to sleep and say you stayed in the ritzy hotels, more power to you. But for us, this was perfect and we had more to spend on ourselves and enjoying shows. The bed was comfortable and the rooms stayed cool or warm depending on what we set it to. Our only complaint is being hit by every TLC resort employee at every entrance. We took them up on the presentation for free shows however them we were hit several times a day after due to shift changes etc. all in all it was a great hotel & experience!",5A_80MIKvqPugj5Va6SB-Q,0,0,5,5pCNiwURdQBCmqfdc0rHeg

The Riviera gets 4 stars for its friendly blackjack dealers, drink specials, and the epic pinball machine museum in the west lobby! The place seemed kind of empty after New Years, but smelled really classy somehow. No stink of despair and cigar here! Plus the dealers knew how to deal with aggressive gamblers who try to hassle and crowd gambling newbies like myself while I'm trying to make a bet.

Their comedy show was a great way to spend an evening and the fact that our waitress was kind enough to let us know that a pitcher of beer cost the same as 2 single glass beers put me over the top. I could not tip her fast enough.

5718295,2009-04-13,2,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"Not a fan of the Riviera Hotel & Casino! All the magic that might have been here once as has packed up and left for a better place..

For the longest time I tried to look for a reason to not only visit the hotel, but also to stay a night or two.  I had heard a few good reviews in the past and was really looking forward to the day when the stars would align and I would get to play and stay.

Well that day finally came and I can only say my whole experience was one disappointment after another.  Yea, the food was ""okay"" but nothing to detour from some other hotels for.   The alcohols flows, but not with quite the same zeal as other places.   The gaming was, well, present.  But not really all that exciting.  They also had their little mini-shows by the bar/gaming areas and they had the standard passable acts you see other places.  Their headliner show  ""Crazy Girls"" was is a show that is little aged and getting sloppy.  One you should pass on by unless free and also dragged into.  The rooms still need an update to give them an appearance of the 2000's instead of the 1970's.

All of the items above I could have taken with a grain of salt expect for one thing that kept hitting me in the face over and over and that was this.  At every turn in the hotel I kept felling like the hotel was trying to suck the money right out of me without so much as a smile or a thanks.

This attitude showed when I first checked into the Riviera.  The staff all looked like they were stressed and could barely be put off by taking your name and looking up your reservation.   I would have understood the attitude if there had actually been some kind of crowd checking in at the time. But there were many empty locations when I walked up and got the sour puss from the reception desk.  

When I had made my reservations (directly with the hotel)I has requested several details about the room I wanted.  I have a standard list of items I liek that has developed over years of hotel stays.  This list  was given to the hotel two months before check in.  But the person at reception had no idea of the desires given for the room.  Instead I was left negotiating a last minute change to get back to what I had originally requested in the first place.

At every meal in the place I never quite felt like I was getting full value for what I spent.  Sure it was ""acceptable"".  But I always felt the little extras that spell out attention to detail were missing.  The presentation was always unexciting and the garnishes were non-existent.  let's just say you could get the smae at any decent restaurant in Las Vegas.  For certain there is a better experience to be had any any other hotel restaurant.  The Bellagio's establishments easily come to mind. 

I also felt like I was being gouged for other hotel services I took advantage of.  One of them tat comes to mind is the shipping office.  I had a few things I didn't want to drag back on the plane with me.  While I was prepared to pay a little extra because of the shipping taking place at a hotel, I was actually disturbed at the inflated rates the Riviera charges its customers to send or revceive packages.  The plus side to the shipping office was the staff.  They had a great attitude when helping out the customer.  Something I found utterly lacking in the rest of the hotel save for the maids.

A quick note on the room pricing.  The Riviera is no deal at all.  I am not one to be cheap.  I even take a a generous attitude when it comes to tipping everyone, including the maid staff making up my room.  But I did not feel I had gotten the value I have come to expect from a major Las Vegas hotel.  You might get lucky and get the room at a low rate but that is where the value ends.  And in Vegas you never depend on luck when smarts will get you better rewards.

The best thing I can say about the Riviera is they had the same feel of the Dunes Hotel the last time I stay there years ago.  And we all know what happened to that place!  Time for the Riviera to be razed as well!  At this point the only good thing about the Riviera Hotel is the outside facade it presents in lights at night,

I will not be returning to Riviera hotel as any time in the future. if I can help it   I would even look elsewhere first for a room even if conference or trade show I am attending is in the Riviera hotel  And that my friends is saying a lot coming from a person whose falls into bed after all day at a trade show.",yR731OlfuI4585U4_HhHlg,5,1,1,fkEicfRzP8p2ChO25YShqw

This answer should always be no. You know you aren't going to like it, just like staying at Hooters but you do it because its cheap and hey you just need a bed. It's always worse than you think though. Always. The hotel will be getting torn down soon and you can tell everyone has just sort of given up. The tables and staff are still there but it seems like everyone is going through the motions.

 I will just list all of the things that went wrong and that way you can say no to ever booking here for the next few months. The cable and tv didn't work from the beginning. The room smelled like smoke and cigarettes the entire time. You overlook the roof of another building. Housekeeping comes by make every other day. The internet is non existing. It doesn't work. You cant stay connected to it so do go here planning to get work done. They charge a resort fee will providing none of the resort amenities. The beds are uncomfortable everything looks run down. 

The positives. It's cheap. It has taxis to the better hotels on the strip. It provides a bed and air conditioning. You can sleep there and it gives you a place to put your things when you aren't in a club or seeing shows. If you want to hardcore gamble there are ways to do that in this casino. Technically it's on the strip so shuttles and other services will take you there.

You know what you are getting before you even get here. It won't shock you by being better than expected. It's actually way worse but you signed up for it so you gotta deal with it. Do it if you really just need a bed in Vegas.

They looked like they were recently redone as they had flat panel HDTV's in all the rooms, the beds were neat with what looked like new bedding, and the rooms were clean.

The manfolk had received a call from a tour company named Casablanca Express. For $150, we could stay three nights in Vegas and receive some discounted meal/entertainment vouchers. We both own timeshares but thought ""hey, it's $150 and it's Vegas, baby!"". He asked them how they could offer such a low price and they said that The Riviera had gone through a remodel and they were wanting to show off the new accommodations. 

I had checked Trip Advisor and noted the comments from other travelers. I thought that they were probably kind of snobby and ""how bad could it be?"". 

Let me tell you how bad it could be. Our taxi dropped us off and upon entering the registration area, there were at least 30 people waiting in line. There were only four people available to assist the guests. We waited in line for 45 minutes. Note that there is NO where to sit and it would probably be impolite to sit on the ground with your suit case. 

After getting to our room, I noted the two beds. Jokingly I stated that we each get our own bed. Then I noticed the size of the bed. They were full size beds! The only question the attendant had asked was smoking or non-smoking. We are not large people but at my age, I really prefer at least a queen size bed. Other than a few ""special"" times, we slept in separate beds. Very romantic!!

Then we get to the room itself. When we were told that the property had gone through a remodel, I would think that they would put us in one of the newer rooms. No, our room was circa 1975. 

There was a sticker on the mirror in the bathroom that asked that we keep the staff safe and if we had any hypodermic needles to dispose of to ask housekeeping for assistance. Seriously?! There was a Dole banana sticker on the bathroom counter that was there when we arrived and was there when we left, even though housekeeping came in each morning. The cupboards under the sink wouldn't close. 

The room was not clean. The window, that overlooked the pool, had mold/fungus in the windowsill. I wouldn't have noticed this except the drapes were falling off the hooks and I was trying to put them back up. 

On one of our ventures out, I noticed a room service tray outside one of our neighboring rooms. The tray was there for more than 24 hours!

I know that we didn't pay much for this hotel stay. As I told the manfolk, if I make it out alive and without bed bugs, I'll consider it a blessing. 

If you must stay here (why would you?!) ask for an updated room. Otherwise, contact housekeeping if you must dispose of your syringes.

Cannot say enough good things about this Hotel and Casino.
I have stayed there atleast 10 times over the past 13 years.
Even when I have lost money on the table I have still left satisfied with the entertainment and the friendly staff.
It is a real shame it is now on its way out after 60 years of providing some great moments in American Entertainment history!

The Roller Derby Events are here; Andrew Dice Clay is here as well as their comedy club (I've been to it a half dozen times or so and have seen some good acts at the club) I can't speak to the rooms but the staff I've encountered are always very accommodating; their Valet service is convenient and very fast.  

Their food court deserves a solid B rating the food selection is top notch (but could be cleaner as many people trash their tables and walk away) I've eaten at three of the different stores here and was pleased with the quality and price. 

They have a mini Pinball exhibit on loan from the Pinball Hall of Fame that is good for kids and fun for the adults who are tired of playing the slots. My High scores stay on the machines and that makes me very happy.

5882223,2013-12-03,0,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"I recently stayed here on a recent trip to Las Vegas. I have to say that it is a great deal especially for being near the Strip. Although it is the strip, but not at the core, where the other megaresorts are at, however it is still a prime location to be near those resorts and different places to go have fun. The Riviera is in fact the oldest casino and resort on the Strip, which means the facilities are a bit dated. The hotel room was decent, but a bit dated. I guess the hotels need a bit of renovating and freshen up. I understand they may be losing money, but I guess if they can offer some good new rooms with some accommodations to keep prices affordable can be great. I mean $34 a night is not bad on the weekend compared to many places on the Strip that can charge a lot more. 

All I have to say is the price you pay is what you get and pretty much if you are looking for a room without the many amenities of the megaresorts, this is the place to go to. I actually liked this place and would definitely stay here again.",rj4AXTFRsMh6k7Qz-uZaIA,1,1,3,hM7IWPeJ1bSqMxYuawmM6A
5885830,2010-02-03,0,5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,"We came here as part of a conference. The rooms were pretty beat up, my bathroom had no fan, and though the beds were comfortable I couldn't sleep because the space under the dividing door was large allowing entire conversations to disturb me from next door. Also, since so many people smoke, the linens smelled like cigarettes as they had obviously been washed with smokers' linens.
The hotel lobby itself was a mixture of disgusting cigarette smoke (stale) blinking lights and cocktail waitresses and carpeting that looked like they had been there since the 70s. It was horrible and tacky.
The conference rooms themselves were thankfully smoke free, so I mostly ran from the conference room up to my room. Overall the conference area of the hotel was functional and well lit, with clean bathrooms. One problem however was coffee. Apparently we were ""foreigners"" because we wanted espresso. There wasn't a starbucks or decent latte to be found anywhere near the hotel.
Mostly what upsets me about he whole experience, is that we paid three times as much at the ""special conference price"" for a crappy hotel room that was going for a third of the price on the riviera's website. So I paid $99 for a room advertised that night for $27. I think the conference was taken for a ride. Circus Circus across the street as well as the Hilton a little down the way were going for very reduced prices as well: Circus Circus $30, Hilton $49. If you are conference organizer, the conference space was great, but organize better prices at a nicer hotel.",JjtQ1txoSd69pSwUPsWxcA,5,1,2,dxCRBl8PyBfHKRxjSh1q_Q

This place has BED BUGS. I was in room 4826 and there were bed bugs. I got bit and they were in my hair. They moved me to a new hotel room, but did not refund my cost of staying there, and I am STILL trying to get compensated for my dry cleaning, loss of luggage and personal items, plus measures to keep contamination from coming to my house. Then they had the audacity to tell me that they inspected the room and found it not active. 

This was after their security guy took away a few bugs in a jar that I had found, after I took photos of the bites, and filled out a ""report"" which was actually a comment card. I've been getting the  run around from security and risk management since January 22nd. Their staff is rude and basically lied to me about this room being ""non active"". 

Don't stay here! If you get even one bug in your luggage and take it home, it can grow into an infestation that will cost thousands to get rid of! You'll have to heat treat your home, use bug dogs, vapor strips, mattress encasements, it will put you out for their negligence! I lost my luggage, comb, a pair of shoes, etc. and am out costs because this crappy hotel is unwilling to fess up to their dirtiness!

The Riv is one of the oldest surviving casinos in Vegas, built in the 50's, and it shows. It's dirty, dingy, dark, and depressing. One of my co-workers was lucky enough to be upgraded to one of the ""new"" rooms after he complained about the bellman leaving his luggage in their ""holding area"", an oil-covered parking space in the deck. The newer renovated rooms are decent but they don't make up for the rest of the place. 

My room was one of the old style, with a really tiny bathroom (more like a closet), worn out carpet, ancient furniture, pathetically thin threadbare sheets, and filthy curtains with holes in them. 

Those damn curtains didn't block out any of the bright lights flooding in from Circus Circus at night, so I ended up using all the pillows, the chair, the table, and anything I could get my hands on to squash them as tightly together as possible to even be able to sleep. I'm sure housekeeping thought I was crazy, but at least they left it alone for the duration of my stay. 

Wifi is included in the resort fee, but is spotty and slow at best. And why is the safe under the nightstand, where you have to get down on the dirty carpet to use it?? At least the bed was semi-comfortable

First off they would not honor the room upgrade voucher that they sent me a couple days before.  Once we got to the room there was a huge stain on the carpet  right in front of our door.  Once we settled in we decided to hit the casino floor and we got stuck in the elevator for almost an hour and the fire department had to come and get us out.  It was so hot in there and I had to keep my girlfriend calm because she kept fearing the worst.  Once were were out the woman who worked for the hotel rushed us downstairs and had us wait at a table for about a half hour then came out and apologized for the inconvenience and offered us a couple of free buffets.  She was none too friendly and when I told her that being locked in a sweltering elevator merited more than a couple of free buffets she got even ruder.  The next day I asked to speak with the hotel manager and a woman came out to talk to us and said that she was sorry and gave me another number to call (Lacricia I believe)  I called the number and her receptionist said there was nothing she could do and tried to put if off on the elevator company saying that it was not the hotels fault because they did not own the elevators.  I asked to have the hotel manager call me and I never recieved a call from anyone else.  Our room never seemed to get cool and when I mentioned it to the woman at the front desk she brushed it off.  I didn't realize it until we were checking out but the floor in front of the air conditioning unit was all wet where I had my dirty clothes and some of the colors bled together.  Needless to say it was not a great experience.  I am still shocked at the lack of customer service and the fact that not once person called to follow up with any of my concerns.,fD6FZMW1V5l0oRD-fICb3w,1,0,1,xYmNtBu0CfO7cP7ym9-OyQ

I'm not quite sure how the Riviera survives in the cut-throat environment of the Strip. They must get enough bus tours and conferences to keep the dollars flowing.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago for the Teacher Conference.  We has a really good time there. The new rooms were awesome! The wireless internet people company that services your hotel did a awesome job! There were many problems with the wireless, but nothing that wasn't able to be fixed. One issue that couldn't be fixed that was a little disappointing, they could not provide a mini fridge as it was needed to refrigerate medication. I found this insensitive toward people with medical conditions. They offered to switch our rooms but we would not be with our group as it was one of the reason we came to this hotel.

Even though your hotel is at the end of the strip, it wasn't far. We were able to walk from Luxor to the Rivera with no problem.
