He took our order and brought our breadsticks and drinks. We then waited for over an HOUR for our pizza. We watched people who came before and after us getting their food. Our waiter walked by us several times and would make weird awkward eye contact with us but would never check on us to see how we were or to give any explanation as to why it was taking so long for such a simple order. We decided to cut our losses and go to Dominos.

 We went for lunch, and it was packed. Even so, we were seated quickly, and our sodas brought immediately. We ordered two large pizzas and two kids pizzas, and it took about 35 minutes to get them. Our server was quick to bring refills on drinks, extra napkins, etc. 
The large pizzas were a bit pricey at $23-$26 each. However, there were plenty of left overs for anther meal. 
The crust was really good, I loved the snap and bite of it.  My toppings weren't as warm/cooked through as I would have liked, the cheese not quite melty enough. This might have been due to an effort to get all of the pizzas out quickly. 
My kids each ordered the kids cheese pizza, which was surprisingly large for only $5, including a soda. It came in a frying pan which they found hilarious. (The pan was completely cool, no burn hazards here!)",h1ga_hkgz_rLktfL84ZdCQ,0,0,3,zkLDzvg71XKbIKjaKNH9vg

106341,2011-11-27,0,Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg,"We've been going to this location of Metro Pizza for at least 8+ years now (and the Decatur location before that for a couple years), at least once per month and more recently about once per week!!  Metro has some of the BEST pizza I've ever eaten.  For a long time, our favorite was ""The Metro"" which is a super, super thick crust, but a couple years ago, we tried the original thin crust, and I found a new favorite!!
As for service, Metro has some of the BEST service anywhere.  Even before we were regulars, we were treated great by MOST employees... and those employees that weren't the friendliest didn't last long working there.  Those employees that have remained all these years are genuinely friendly & professional!!  For years, Susan was our favorite server... she is now the Manager!  David has become our new favorite server!!  But ALL the servers are great, the hostesses are super nice & helpful, and the busboys are prompt & friendly & willing to help out with whatever as well!
Quality of food is totally awesome about 98% of the time... once in a while the bread is a little undercooked... gummy & doughy inside... and about 1 in 25 times the pizza is a little bit burnt, but not bad enough to make it inedible!  Only once did we ever get a pizza that we couldn't eat, and they offered to remake it immediately!  Overall, the flavors are delicious!!  Two of us get one small pizza and between the free bread and the great filling pizza, it's more than enough for us... and that makes a very reasonably priced dinner for two!

They also make GREAT cannoli as well!  Tastes awesome & I believe they make them themselves!

Every time friends or family come to town, we always take them to Metro at least once, and every dish anyone has ever tried has been great!  They always thank us for taking them there and ask to go back the next time they come to town!

Metro Pizza is by far my favorite pizza restaurant in Las Vegas!!  If you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out on the BEST pizza around!",3ebfZkfUcJC6NaeCeNhgLg,0,0,5,Np9Mof1-vcdeUOOmeVtNyw

173581,2006-05-29,0,Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg,"Metro has great pizza (served piping hot on silver stands) and solidly decent calzones and pasta.

The best part about Metro is the atmosphere: The tables are covered in white butcher paper and each table is given a pile of crayons.  While this may be a ploy to distract customers from the hungry anxiety of waiting for their order (you can't watch steaming pizzas carried through the restaurant - past your table - while you're occupied with tic-tac-toe), the wait hasn't been unbearably long in my experience.

They also have theme nights, like 70's/Woodstock and Hawaiian.  I seem to remember something about dressing up and getting some sort of discount.  This is great place for a lively group outing.  (The Flamingo/Decatur location is slightly more intimate).

In sum: A casual, fun place with good pizza.",EQcsjt_3R2UrdTpQuTkk9g,0,0,4,WlCN0MLb2y1Rc7MCelybjw

In my opinion, this is not Chicago style pizza, but it was quite good. I think what threw me was the sauce on the side. I ordered the South Side which is three types of cheese. There is no sauce on the pizza. It comes separately and you get a choice of meat or tomato sauce. 

I debated giving them five stars because the pizza was good, I guess I just haven't totally embraced the sauce on the side concept. I would recommend you give them a try as it is interesting and most importantly tasty.

532816,2012-01-11,0,Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg,"OK. Let me just put it this way! This is not the best pizza I have ever eaten. but it comes in a close second.

When my wife and I walked in I was impressed right from the start. The restaurant is a nice large size. They have magnum bottles of wine placed throughout the restaurant. And in the menu under the history of Metro Pizza page they pay homage to the first pizzeria in the United States; Lombardi's in New York's Little Italy. Metro has become my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas.

On their back wall they have a map of the United States. It takes up the whole wall. Pinned to it at different locations are small photos with the names of Pizzerias in the different cities that they believe are the best. I have to go back to write them down sometime.

We were seated almost after stepping through the door. We were greeted at our table by a wonderful server who was friendly and outgoing and made us feel like we were the only patrons there. Bread and drinks came to our table very quickly. The bread was still hot from the oven. It had a really nice yeasty flavor to it and the real butter melted into it quickly. If you know someone who does not like pizza, if there is such a person, you could take them just for the bread. It is that good!

They have two sizes of Pizza. A small and a large. We got the large. I thought when ordering it, it would just be a bit to big and we would have a slice or two left over. I was very wrong. We were only able to finish half the pizza. So one large feeds four. We got one half the pizza as Hawaiian and the other half Gotham. Each were wonderful. The toppings were all fresh and crunchy. The pepperoni tasted a bit different from other pepperonis, but still very tasty and not as strong as most. If you want to know what sausage is supposed to taste like, this is the place. It was very flavorful like you would expect it to be. The veggies were tasty and crisp and the ham on the Hawaiian was plentiful and flavorful. One thing very interesting about the bacon bits on the Hawaiian; they were bacon fried up and cut into bits. So they were very moist and full of flavor and most of all they were not hard and overly crunchy. The sauce was tomato-ie like sauce should be. I expected the sauce to have a lot of spices in it overpowering it's flavor. I could not tell any spices in it at all. I'm sure they were there, but they were well incorporated into it.

Pizza is and always has been my favorite food. So I know I will be going back again and again to get this wonderful pizza.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,1,0,5,U6BFEY3MHPvW3WUKc7ORJg

I had the Old New Yorker and it was excellent.  The crust was thin and crisp and the toppings were perfect.  Although this location isn't the closest to us, our experience was so good, that my wife and I decided to drive over to this location about a month later.

The second vist was poor.  From the point where I started noting the time, it took over 30 min. to get our individual size pizzas.  Our waiter was unbelievable.  Some of his friends came in and he chose to sit with them which was really great for him because the conversation took his mind off our hunger.  Eventually the food came.  The crust on my pizza was perfect, however, the toppings were a slimey mess with uncooked green peppers and onions.  When we were done eating, I finally grew weary of waiting and had to go over to where my waiter was seated with his dinner companions and request my bill.

Metro Pizza is FANTASTIC!!!! Disputes are now deemed over!

The service is exceptional every time I go there and the pizzas are no joke. There are daily specials offered everyday for the weirdest things. Good specials too! They give you a great discount if your name is listed on the daily special on each table. How cool is that? After reviewing the list, I found that my name is not there, but that's ok.

If you like garlic and basil on your pizza, there is a specific pizza you must try. Look for it on the menu (the name escapes me!).The garlic and basil is chopped fresh and loaded on the surface of the pizza. The aromas waft through the air and tease your senses as you drool on top of your slice. 

If you have any room left in your stomach, try the Meatball sliders. They are to die for!!!

Finally, if you still have room after the meatball sliders, please, please, please order the Cannolis! The filling is made on the premises everyday (according to the owners) and they are stuffed full. I guarantee you can not eat just one! Very delectable and satisfying.",L5T-zQCGAqUDW8v7z6Gdxg,1,1,5,itZ_lOU2YRLfBcKCP18KdQ

Pepperoni on the whole thing and onion and green pepper on one half and mushroom and anchovies on the other half. They charged me for 5 toppings at 2.00 each even though only on half the pizza. They only had 2 sizes 9 inch or 16 inch. Like I said very pricey but taste was good. Lacking in sauce so it was a little dry. I will not go back too many other options that are just as good for less money.,qYZ6wpXmt-n5solnVNnGhw,0,0,3,0Tlhkb4L1Arw4c-B73Kmqg

She was very patient and accomodating! I even called her the day before the dinner, because we forgot about dessert....and she came through with flying colors. The food was delivered on time, and our delivery guy - Steve was the best. They had forgotten the sauce for our wings, and he returned with it a short time later! The garlic knots and meatballs were sensational! The pizza and italian sausages were delicious as well. A lot of food for a reasonable price.

The first indication that things had changed was the fact that I parked in the front row during the lunch rush. In the past you almost had to settle for the Smart and Final overflow lot from 11:00 to 1:30. Once inside the dazed and confused hostess somehow found the effort to say, ""How many"". These two words were all I got. I believe she is getting paid by the least amount of words she uses during her interactions with guests. I imagine the phrase, ""Hello"", or ""How is your day going"" would be too costly and have been removed from her script. Once at the booth I noticed the familiar table cloths that I remember were on the tables when I last visited some 4 years ago. I was impressed that they only had 7 or 8 deep dirty cuts in them considering their age. The good news is that they did go hand in hand with the chipped up painted floor. But enough of about the atmosphere! I mean I would eat off an old tire if it was good! 
We ordered the salad and the Gothic from the very nice waitress. The salad was good! But the pizza was...not so good, unless you're a fan of soggy tasteless pie. I would have to say that this new Metro Pizza might make the pies the day before and warm them up when ordered. It just seemed like we were eating day old pie that was heated up in a large microwave. 
The sad thing is I would recommend Metro Pizza to ANYONE looking for good local pizza blindly. Because I was going off my past experience. Now...not so much. Sorry guys I know you offered a comment card at the end of the meal but there just wasn't enough room to put my feeling on a 6x3 card. Bottom line is you guys need to step it up!

Now on to Metro.

Most of the pizza is Vegas is bad.  That's just the way it is.  Too many pizza places here trying to sell cheap pizza with bad ingredients.  There are actually a few places in Vegas now that have Chicago-style thin crust pizza.  Metro is the best one.  Metro serves only one kind of Chicago pizza called the ""Triple Play.""  It's a thin-crust pizza with cheese and LOTS of sausage.  I always order mine with only half the normal amount of sausage because they actually put too much on.  This is by far the best Chicago-style thin crust pizza I have had in Vegas and for that it gets 5 stars.  They order the sausage straight from Chicago.  I know because I asked the manager once before because it tastes just like sausage I would get in Chicago which is to say it's damn good.

It is very close to the University so it is a popular place to eat. 

One of my favorite appetizers is the garlic knots, $4.95. I think they are fun because they are garlic knots that are skewered over metal sticks. They are fun to share. It is served with Marinara sauce. 

My favorite salad is the ""Domenica,"" $10.75. It is a chop Italian salad that is comprised of romaine lettuce, salami, ham, provolone, cucumbers, tomatoes and onions. It is tossed in their house dress. It also comes with a garlic knot. One salad can easily be shared with a friend. You can also add chicken or shrimp for $3.00. It is a meal in itself.

Their veggie pizza, ""Green Valley"" is my favorite pizza, $23 (large). It has zucchini, mushroom, onions, black olives and tomatoes. 

If you like an off- the- Strip, New York- Little Italy style pizza, this is a great place to visit.

Location is fairly large, staff were friendly, and our large group was able to reserve a table in advance for the promotion. Tickets were sold at the door at a dollar each, 5 per person, to be redeemed throughout the night for slices as available. Staff manning the slice counter were fast and friendly, and the manager chatted a bit with me about the organization and how they help out the community. I have students who personally benefit from Three Square and I'm always happy to support what they do- discounted pizza is just an added incentive.

As usual, the pies were on point. The Mulberry Street (eggplant ricotta) and Milano (white)  pizzas were probably my favorites, and the giant, pillowy square Sicilian impressed too.

However service not so much they get a ""3"". We always ordered the metro which is the extra thick crust but we also order an appetizer such as the romano fries. Pizza comes 25 minutes later because it usually takes longer due to the crust(no problem) then you realize that the fries still haven't made it and you haven't seen your server since he took the order so even drinks need tending.  I then say ""Never mind don't want the darn fries"". 

This happened on several occasions where they have forgotten the appetizers but i started ordering the appetizer before ordering the pizza. Works better that way.

Otherwise known as individual for $13 or large for $25. And the calzone was laughable small as well and waterlogged and had no flavor.  We ordered the bbq chicken one.  It squirted out water and the crust was soggy. The individual pizza was very tasty and quality, but literally was less than a personal size.  It was a very good thing I had just went to Trader Joe's the day before and was able to pull out lots of apps. To make a nice cheese and app spread.

When a number of them say, ""Metro Pizza"" I hug them and say ""THANK YOU!"" 

Metro Pizza is just 2 minutes down Tropicana (okay 5, because there's always traffic) and when I saw their prices I was so excited and proud of myself for making this discovery that I almost took out a flag, stabbed the ground and declared, ""Ahhh....normalcy.""   

They even DELIVER their yummy food to your hotel too!  702-736-1955.

The owners grandparents immigrated from italy and lived 50 yards from the first pizza place in America where they were some of it's first employees.  If that's not enough to excite you, Metro Pizza takes pride serving the great traditions of America's landmark Pizzerias.

What that means to YOU?  Daily hand-made dough, cooked on stone in hearth ovens and fresh tomato sauces made from the finest picked tomatoes.
 
(I'm getting hungry....)

They have appetizers, speciality pizzas, stuffed pizzas, regular pizzas, east size pizzas, family size dinners and salads, the people next to me ordered this salad that came out in this gigantic bowl that looked so delicious I couldn't stop staring.  It was also had this giant ball of dough on top. I asked Thomas what it was and he said, ""That's a garlic nut.""  I asked for a menu because I was in Vegas and my dirty mind just had to see these words in print.  The menu said, 'Garlic Knot"" and I laughed out loud.  The neighbors also noticed I was staring at their salad and brought me over a plate of their food!  I almost died of embarrassment but graciously took the offer cause I really wanted to try it!  It was their most popular salad called; The Domenica Salad.   Y U M.  

The staff is amazing too.  Our waiter at the East Side Location was a guy named Thomas.  He was very busy on the night I visited, but he answered all my questions, looked me in the eye and consistently made me feel valued as a customer and fulfilled all our tables needs!  

YES!  Finally, I found a place that is just like a restaurant I'd have started (if I had $ and a will to work 24/7) 

The other wonderful employee I met was a girl named Janice or Janet (my kids and I argued what it was so I'm putting in both cause I've been known to be wrong) (did I really say that?).  She had long dark hair and helped me with a child that refused to move from a 15 person booth (didn't I tell you they THRIVE on families - bring in a big group and they will hold you hand and make you happy!)  My son refused to move and it was this girl that not only  tried to coax my just-woke-up-and-hate-the-world five year old back to our table but she'd come over to give me funny updates on how it was going.   My devil-child finally snapped out of it and Janice/Janet filled that table with a family of 12 two minutes later.

Bottom line:  Metro Pizza screams of family, traditions, friends, and great food.  Their menu is filed with family size portions and if it's not listed on the menu and you want it...chances are they can do it for you....with a smile.

In have been eating a lot of Las Vegas pizza over the past few months - kind of on a kick to find my own private pizza Idaho, someplace to call my own that just so happens to serve great pizza.  Just when I found a pizza I somewhat liked in my 'hood - along comes Metro to blow that pizza out of the water (it's always all about the water isn't it?).

My friend had just received some upsetting news and our proposed lunch date venue was far too public to speak frankly - so I decided to order a pizza and salad in. I have worked within two blocks of this Metro Pizza for over two years - and never stepped foot in the door.  As usual - Yelpers saved the day and convinced me to give it a whirl.  I ordered the ultra-thin Margherita pizza and a large dinner salad to split.  Although they were swamped - the pizza was ready on time and the service was terrific when I picked it up.  

Let me tell you - this is BY FAR the best pizza I've found in Las Vegas.  The crust was thin, but toothsome and crunchy at the edges - the sauce was flavorful and fresh.  Perfect pizza. End of story.  These guys really love pizza - they even have offer 3 hour classes are the second and last Tuesday of each month if you want to learn how to make your own!",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,2,1,5,BZZR-AzP7a03irJjcYu0zw

My favorite is the Modesto. Get the metro crust every time on any pizza. It's thick and doughy and is soooo cheesy. If you get a beer get a bigger one because it always seems to run out and I'm left without a drink until the end of my meal. Most times the waiter doesn't come back until it's too late. 

I do not like the other people who come here. Whether it's a bunch of bro dudes, obnoxiously loud laughing people (one time people even had the nerve to talk about us in the very next booth), large parties of children. Many times I just order take out.

The major problem I have with this place is when I try to take advantage of their special offers. Many times it's the reason I'm there. Like one time my husband won on a trivia question on the fb page. But they didn't offer him the prize. We messaged them and they never replied. Not cool. Another time, Black Friday, they offered gift cards at a reduced price. They had run out, but took our info. We never heard. We not only called them a week later, but also sent them a message on fb. No information, no reply. We even saw them advertising that they had gift cards again. RAGE. Finally, weeks later they called us.

The owners are smart and humor runs high in their marketing ploys. Gimmicks like getting a discount on certain day if you're name is Mark are pretty brilliant. 

The service is also pretty on point and upbeat. The place itself is designed to feel homey like a pizza joint should and succeeds. I am especially fond of the mammoth booths. Extraneous seating is always a winner in my book.  

The special on my day is that you got free Nuke fries with your order. The spicy Nuke fries are o.k., but I think I would be upset if I paid for them. Gesture appreciated though. Metro has four Eastside specialties on their menu--so my friend and I went with the Four Corners, which gives you two slices of each Eastsides. 

With exciting toppings like eggplant and ricotta in the mix--I thought the Four Corners was going to be a knockout, but the uppercut never came. I got rabbit punched instead. The idea is good topping-wise on these pizzas, but the ingredients all feel very commercial--like straight out of a can or factory. 

Also, the Large pizza is pretty large--so only order thick crust if you are starving or if you want to take some with you.

The pizza is of high quality, and many varieties are available - different crusts, toppings, etc...  I particularly like the San Gennaro pizza with the thick 'Metro' crust.  I generally favor their thicker crusts here as opposed to the thin crusts, which are more standard in my mind.

Salads are good too - the antipasti salad is excellent, and the chicken pasta salad is also excellent - their dressings are very good - balsamic, honey dijon, house special, etc...

Good lunch specials as well for under $10.

Main issues I have had are minor, generally wait at lunch can be long.  I favor their Tropicana location near UNLV over others, but the Horizon Ridge location is ok too - food is consistent, I have just gone to the Trop location for a longer time.

They also have a good calendar of events (which unfortunately is not updated online enough at their website) - they do many specials - i.e. discounts for your name, wearing UNLV colors, holidays, etc...  I also very much enjoy when they have events for kids to make their own pizza, lessons on making their really good bread, etc...

The pepperoni slices are small,  about the size of a nickel,  and crisps  and forms a little cup when it's baked.  The flavor is so much better.  
Service here of course is excellent as always.",TGYVnlAY0R8WX4IagRiuRw,1,0,5,0YCo-hK7q7Jzt80dOfmNvw

3087689,2017-07-30,0,Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg,"When I first moved to Las Vegas, before gourmet pizza places started popping up everywhere, Metro was the only option. It was consistently voted best of Las Vegas and even though I now prefer Naked City, there are still some occasions where I specifically crave Metro Pizza. The crust is thinner but not ""thin"", their slices are huge, and they have a lot of options for toppings.

The other night I ordered a large 1/2 Modesto with sausage (free to add, why not?) and 1/2 Milano to go. One great thing about Metro is that they DO offer 1/2 and 1/2 toppings because Naked City doesn't. I was told the wait was about an hour and a half (Friday night) but it ended up being more like an hour. The Milano is a white pizza with garlic, mozzarella, and ricotta. This pizza is very garlicky. I don't mind that but my boyfriend wasn't that into it. I liked the ease of eating it, you can actually pick it up with one hand, whereas I'm usually always a knife and fork pizza eater. The Modesto's flavors were more intense and varied but the pizza itself was totally soggy, I think because of the tomatoes. I really enjoyed the strips of basil on this side and I think next time I may add that to the Milano. 

Overall Metro Pizza is consistent and offers a lot of interesting pizzas without them being TOO weird. It's pizza that doesn't make you want to pass out immediately afterwards, which is appreciated sometimes. I'll keep coming here even with the pizza explosion happening around town.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,1,1,4,SRBxB1IghTHfgoghdDmpyg

They are in need of new table clothes as well, they are worn through in some places.  

I had dinner here last night with my wife and kids.  The drink cups had rough edges on top (they are plastic) and are in need of replacement. French fries were under-cooked and chicken fingers were pretty blah.  Chicken Parm sub was decent.

We got everything from the sausage lover, pepperoni, to the crazy spinach one, and MAN, did people scarf up those pizzas like it was their dying meal. 

We did that 6 nights in a row and it never got old. It was so delicious that I'm salivating right now thinking about the pizza all the way from Los Angeles. I will say that the one pizza that didn't impress was the margarita. It was very thin and extremely dry/crisp. All the other pizzas were fabulous, fold over types, like true NY crust.

Walked through the door and the hostess grabbed our menus and guided us to our seats without saying a word.  When I asked how her day was going she turned in surprise that I would speak and said good, as she walked away.  The drinks were next to come, the waitress asked what we would like to drink, but then said four waters and turned to walk away.  She had to be stopped so we could actually order the drinks we wanted.  I almost left on the spot, but I have been here many times with fantastic results and for a moment I thought I was being pranked.

Well I'm glad we waited, our waiter was awesome and saved a possible full blown nuclear meltdown of a review. He answered a few questions, took our orders, got the food out in a hurry and always made sure our glasses were full.  Way to come in and get the save Sir, if it was baseball season your closing skills would be in high demand.  

We went with a couple pizzas,  (Gotham, and meat lovers)salad and some nuke fries.  All were great the typical Metro Pizza pies with great portions and tons of flavor.  The fries had just the right kick and I topped it off with a nice adult beverage.

The initial service will drop this review from were it should be in the four or five star range to a three.  I am hoping it was a one time thing, but thank you again to our actual waiter for being what I have come a custom to at Metro Pizza.",-zq5x_Dxub8k0YOWvqn2Rg,3,2,3,KrPf0zNUFWmxrbduAvbQdQ

This would be a prime location for many Vegas drunkards, but they don't open late unfortunately.

In my opinion, Metro Pizza is home to one of the best pizza deals in town. Monday - Thursday, from 2:30 - 4:30pm all of their pizzas are half off. I'm a sucker for places that hook it up with free bread and the baked pizza dough that arrives before the meal is delicious.

They definitely get points for experimenting and making some very unique pies like the little piggy which features pulled pork, fried onion strings topped off with diced pickles. Their ""small"" pizzas can easily feed two. The crusts are nice and crispy but you can opt to get the metro crust which is a lot thicker and doughy. Its nice to see some premium toppings like grilled chicken, meatballs and even truffle oil available. The stuffed pizzas can probably feed a small country and the expansive menu features much more than just pizza.

They have a monthly calender where each day has a special deal. On certain days you can get 25% off for military members or for just reppin UNLV. The restaurant itself is pretty nice and spacious, the bar has a pretty good selection of draft beer and prices are great. Our server Terry is the definition of excellent service. Shes always on top of refills, her recommendations are always on point and her cheery attitude makes the dining experience all the more enjoyable. This place is a must for anyone looking for some good pizza in Vegas.

Recently, one of the girls in my office recommended the Mac and Cheese. She knows I love me some delicious mac and cheese. Holy Moly it was amazing. Baked, cheesy deliciousness.  

Garlic knots are pretty fantastic too. They came with a side of sauce and it was pretty tasty. Another co worker ordered a garlic knot meatball sandwich thing... it looked amazing.. See photos!!!

It's hot in Vegas so I was licking my chops at this coupon.  So I go to pick up my pizza and so the cashier (her name was Susan) my coupon for 1st time check in.  It seems like she took pleasure out of denying me a free soda with the purchase of a $30.00 pizza.  She stated that its only with a dine in meal.  I then showed her the coupon and it stated nothing about only dine in and her response was ""we'll that's what it's meant for"". 

I could've pushed the issue but I decided I'll just write about experience and let people know about Susan at this location. One thing I forgot to mention when I initially walked up to wait in line a customer was there talking with Susan that had already paid and they spent the next 5 minutes talking about meals on wheels and delivery issues.  I decided to sit down and wait since she was obviously not in a rush to help me out.

I recently met up with a group of friends here to support Three Square by participating in Metro Pizza's Slice Out Hunger $1 pizza slice night. I let them know I would have a party of 18 and they were able to accommodate our large group no problem. Earlier this year I attended the $1 slice night at the Decatur (retro metro) location and while it was tasty, they only offered pepperoni and cheese slices. This time we could choose from like 8 different pizzas! They had all the pizzas set up in the bar area and after paying the suggested $5, I was given 5 tickets redeemable for 5 slices. I have to say this not only supported a great cause, but it allowed us to try several types of pizza at such an affordable price. There was a guy who checked on us from time to time and he was friendly, but getting drink refills was not so easy which could have been due to the amount of people on this particular night.

Metro Pizza offers several types of pizza baked different ways and they do also have pasta, salad and the Garlic Knot Meatball Sliders are a must try. On this last visit I tried a slice each of 5 different pizzas and all were pretty darn tasty. The Pumpkin Spice Pizza smelled wonderful and those that tried it in our group seemed to like it. The 86th Street Square Pie is very good if you like a thicker Sicilian type pizza.

The pizza came quickly and was cooked perfectly with the crust being crispy despite all the toppings and cheese.  A fresh drink was brought to the table without being requested and the service was top notch.  I was only able to eat 2 pieces due to the size of the pizza and took the rest home to be enjoyed later.  I was asked if everything was okay and if I needed any thing several times without being pestered.

I work in a busy restaurant on the strip and got off around Ten,i felt bad for my husband who said he was Hungary so i suggested we go to Metro for the first time,
we arrived and we were not greeted,we waited and someone finally came over,the place was empty with one large party of maybe 8 and a two top,when we sat down i noticed how dirty the  place is,the floor was covered in food droppings and our booth seats were ripped and our table was sticky,i checked the menu and was surprised at their prices,but i hoped it was a good indication that the food was good.....
the Waitress was pleasant,we ordered a Hawaiian , but i explained to her my husband didn't like peppers so one half needed to be without peppers,and then she said ok without peppers but with extra bacon on his side and i said no,just without peppers.
After about 15 mins,i told my husband i was exhausted and that we should just get the pizza to go,i was expecting at this stage the pizza would be almost ready.....wrong,i waved over the waitress and paid for the pizza which was $25.00 a complete rip off,we ended up waiting another 15 mins before we got our pizza....keep in mind we were the only people in the place ordering at this point.
We walked home and i opened the box to discover we had no peppers on any of the pizza and extra bacon on one half.........the pizza was doughy and way to heavy on the toppings also lacked any flavor.  
So in short the service was bad,the pizza was bad, and the price was outrageous,i would never return,if you live in the area, try Cuigino's which has some of the best Italian food i have tasted outside of Italy and the family hail from Naples, also it is a fraction of the price!!!",Uj8sm5SED-0_2006MHmw4A,5,2,1,-xk4ZIOtXit7Jjw3iWpGlQ

Decided on The Stockyard (Meat Lovers)-small pizza and San Genarro (sliced meatballs/fresh garlic)- small pizza.  The San Genarro sounds too simple, right?  No way, this baby was poppin' full of flavor.  Both pizzas were off the chiz-ain (am I allowed to say that?  Who cares, gonna say it anyway).

Metro Pizza occasionally hosts special nights with proceeds going to the fight against hunger, specifically local food bank Three Square. I'd enjoyed a similar $1/slice offer earlier this year at their Decatur location, but the Tropicana location was even more exciting, with up eight of their different pizzas advertised as being available. They weren't quite clear about the limit stating a minimum requested $5 donation per person, while the cashier-of-sorts said we could only get up to $5 worth of tickets. Well, not that I was up for eating five hefty slices anyway...

As promised, they had a very impressive slew of pies. Although some were less readily available than others, and most if not all recipes were more modest in toppings than what other Yelpers' photos suggest is normal, this was still an opportunity to enjoy solid pizza while assisting. The crust was consistently crunchy, while the rest of the dough remained relatively soft.

Cheeses and toppings were enjoyable though, no matter the slice. I had a pepperoni, a sausage, the Sicilian, the Mulberry St (eggplant and ricotta), the Milano (with garlic and ricotta), and the white whale of the night, PSL. This featured butternut squash, sweet caramelized apple, whipped goat cheese, toasted pepitas, and walnut oil drizzle, and it was surprisingly balanced between sweet and savory. If pressed, I'd probably rank Milano and sausage as the two next best, with eggplant being an interesting take that could've used the most help from having a higher coverage of toppings.

I also ended up trying a draft beer for the obvious pairing appeal, settling on the Bonanza Brown by local brewery Tenaya Creek ($6 here). The brown ale definitely was pleasant to sip, not as bitter as some ales and not light in overall flavor.

I should add that the employee who took my beer order was nice enough to run to the register to run my credit card and then find me later at my table to bring me the card and receipt, despite me somehow completely not hearing him and subsequently not remembering that I'd passed along my card. It's standard stuff, but a lot of Yelp friends' reviews highlight poor service, so I wanted to share that anecdote.

Metro Pizza isn't an especially brilliant pizzeria, but they're a solid local chain with at least one unusual, seasonal offering. I enjoyed them enough that if I weren't such a sucker for things like happy hours and build your own pizza joints, I'd probably visit here semi-regularly. I should probably pay more attention to that calendar of specials on their web site, huh? That might close enough of the gap.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,12,9,4,SCXdQoW0W2ty7ideayM7hg

Came hear with my brother and we ordered a pie, half pineapple and mushroom for him, and half sausage and onion for me.  I thought my portion was fresh tasting and had solid ingredients.

The restaurant was having a special fundraising event.  $1 per slice to raise money for 3 Square Food Bank.  Charity and cheap pizza is a hard bargain to pass up.  For $5 I received 5 tickets for 5 slices of pizza which borders on too much for me.  My standard serving is 4 slices.  But my oh my these pizzas were good.  I'm talking about simple cheese and pepperoni (though they were options).  I'm talking eggplant and ricotta.  I'm talking garlic white pizza.  I'm talking ultra thin crust loaded with ground Italian sausage.  Yes, I had a slice of each.  And yes I had a slice of pepperoni too.  I am a pizza classicist.  Of the four, my favorite was the eggplant pizza.  Eggplant and ricotta together are hard to beat.  

After stuffing my face with those first 4 pizzas, I waited a little while before using my 5th and final ticket.  I wanted to try the season pumpkin pizza.  I was highly skeptical at first.  All these pumpkin spice creations are so overrated cliche at this point.  But I saw the pizza in person and knew I had to try it.  I was so surprised and impressed by it I convinced another person to try it.  She enjoyed it to.  The crust was fabulous.  Crunchy, soft, and chewy all at the same time.  On top of the perfect crust was pumpkin puree, squash, apples or pears, pumpkin seeds and a whipped goat cheese.  It sounds sweet but tended more towards the savory.  Mildly spiced with the full flavor of the pumpkin up front.  The tangy goat cheese, though limited in its quantity per slice, was the perfect counter to the squash.  Those couple of bites in which I had goat cheese were damn near perfect.  I don't know who came up with this creation but I would like to shake his/her hand.

The staff tonight were hopping.  Running pizza to the bar for the fundraiser.  Running empty pie pans back to the kitchen for another go around.  Serving the people who were ordering as normal.  They were a little off when it came to drink orders and refills but in the end we all got our waters and even a pitcher of water to go around.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,2,4,ZdpctXB4H250S4xOuMGILw

Literally before I could sit down some one was hovering over me asking me what I wanted to drink.  Before I could look at the menu to see what they had, and they just stand there until you decide.  Being a swell guy and not wanting to feel uncomfortable and leave the kid standing there I just ordered a Coke. 

When the server arrived it was not the same person who took my drink order.  So I took a gander around the place and noticed they have the bus boys bun rushing the guests with drink orders before they sit.  My sister and I decided to try the hot and spicy fries for an appetizer.  When they came it looked like fries with a light sprinkle of pepper.  To be honest the fries had a odd smell and the flavor I was not a fan of at all.

Now the pie.  We went with the family favorite sausage and mushroom.  When it came out I was a bit surprised with the size.  But a good surprise of course.  Metro make a really good pizza.  If I would have just had the pizza itself I would given it a four star.  But the whole experience for me wasn't great hence the 3 star.

I've been coming to this chain since my college years (90's) so the decor has changed from kitchy (think Appleby's and TGIFridays- since renovated) to a classic rustic italian restaurant with numerous tv's playing sporting events. My favorite pizza is the Gotham- sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms.I've had other pizzas here but I no longer choose the road less traveled. My husband introduced the Gotham to some out of town friends- they loved it. I've had the eggplant parmesan sandwich and the calzone- which are excellent. They're both too big for me to finish, so plan on leftovers unless you wanna split it with a large party. The calamari appetizer is very good and worth mentioning. The service is really good. You get fresh warm bread and butter while you wait for your pizza or entrees. I am so glad that this place, even with its popularity and loyal following, still participates in the entertainment book, with numerous coupons. Also worth mentioning the huge pizza (30""?) that you can order to go, as well.

I consider that something of a dubious distinction since Vegas, to my knowledge, is not known for any pizza places. And if CA can barely get pizza right, I had a hard time believing Vegas could do any better. 

For the record, I live and die by NYC pizza. There is nothing on this planet that even compares. Yes, Chicago, that includes you. 

They were having a special deal where all pies were half off, so we got a large topped with pepperoni, sausage, and black olives. The quality just wasn't there for me. The pizza wasn't crispy enough, for one thing. Every time I folded a slice in half the front would start to droop like it was going flaccid. The sausage and pepperoni didn't help things since both were so greasy the pie was getting soggy. I'm cool with pepperoni, but those little blobs of meat called sausage do nothing for me. I should have vetoed that topping suggestion when it came up. Pretty good crust, though. Nothing that saved the dish but it worked all the same.

4300081,2010-07-17,0,Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg,"This location of Metro is the reason I have a love hate relationship with this local mini-chain. My rating then is a composite rating for every two good visits I've had to this location, I have had one bad visit. My most recent visit was on Monday, and it was with a large group from my office. I called ahead a couple hours to let them know we had a large group coming. They asked for the exact  time, and I gave it to them. However, when we showed up, a few minutes before the time I gave them, it was almost as if I never called at all. It was lunch time, but it wasn't all that busy. They asked if we wanted table or booth (there were 12 of us) and I said table, as I had on the phone. Instead of being placed in the back right corner where I've been on at least 6 occasions when with a group of 10 or more, we were placed in the middle of the main dining area, despite the other area only have 2 customers. Normally, I wouldn't be upset at that, but because I've encountered some of the worst customer service I've experienced anywhere at this location, I knew it was par for the course. 
For the most part the group got the lunch special (pizza & salad or pasta and salad). My pizza was fine, and I've never had bad food here, so again that is part of my love hate relationship with Metro. 
Depending on the day your order could take 25 minutes or 45 minutes. With this large group we only waited 30, which I thought was actually pretty good. The server did struggle keeping up with our drink refills, but I am not going to hold that against them.

I will be honest, I only come to this location for work related meals. If it is for personal meals, I go to the Decatur and Flamingo location as its more quaint and never as busy. I wish I could say that Metro is worthy of their Best of Las Vegas, and maybe they are if it was solely based on food, but I think they need to re-think their service strategy if they want to continue their reign.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,1,1,3,1ILQy42jItz5hdGDObVbFQ

He refused to let us sit there so we ended up leaving.  Probably best because with the slowness and incompetence from the hostess and the utter lack of care for making customers welcome and catering to them, I would have hated to have to endure a whole dinner there.

We picked it up with no problem, got it home and sat down to eat. First off, I realize we had to drive it home, but it was luke-warm when we opened the box.

The choice of cheese used and tomato sauce have a lot of bearing on the pie
that's being cooked in the oven. I have to say their toppings, and service here 
were phenomenal. However, I was not at all impressed with their sauce and crust.

We were started off with bread. Idk if I was just hungry, but their bread was pretty good! I ordered a #1 off of the lunch special menu & dubbed the salad for garlic knots. You get 2! So I received the garlic knots first & holy hell. I think they might've been the best garlic knots I've ever had. It was hot, fresh, garlicky, & amazing with marinara. I would come back everyday just for those. Then, my pizza came. I swear on my life I thought the menu said individual pizza... & I thought that meant one slice of pizza... nope. It had 6 slices. I took myself to carb-o-load town & went ham. I couldn't finish the pizza, I tried & could only eat 3 lol. The pizza was good too!

4699331,2018-05-28,11,Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg,"Great pizza option when you want something with a more local flavor. Metro Pizza has been a Las Vegas favorite for quite some time and after the first bite you can see why. The crust is thin and the toppings are fresh. It is the type of pizza best eaten the same day though. I am a fan of next-day-pizza, but I don't think their pizza holds up very well the day after. Plus, there are very few occasions where there is any pizza left to even have for the next day.  My favorite pizza from them is their white pizza which has a white garlic sauce on it and chicken. The Gotham is another popular option, which has bell peppers, olives, sausage, and onions. The pepperoni is a safe option as well. I will advise to order in advance if you have a large order though and/or if you need delivery. Peak times are definitely lunch hours 12-3 pm, Fridays, and weekends. 

For example, if you need 5 large pizzas to be delivered I wound order a week in advance if you know when your event is happening. You will have to talk to their Catering Department, but they are very helpful and will make sure your order is accurate. Karoline and Sara are part of the Catering Department and they are super helpful and friendly. I suggest to order early if you need delivery because their delivery availability fills up fast. So last minute party orders might mean someone will have to go pick it up, but they will do their best to accommodate if they can. Pricing can be a little higher than average, but you get a good portion. Just to note, their large has 8 large slices, but they can cut it to 12 small slices. The medium could feed 3 or 4 people. Worth trying at least once if you haven't and if you have, it's worth having to treat yourself from the usual run of the mill.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,31,20,4,b1OgNCJRw6vIDbQenZNeRg

4974414,2009-03-12,3,Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg,"Pizzas are the staple sharing food of all time.  It's easy to order, most everyone likes it, and there's usually more than enough to go around.  I don't eat much of it outside the home, especially if it's just the two of us.  But since we had our friend with us, sharing a pie was the way to go.

It's my first time at Metro Pizza and the Husband has good things to say about the place.  While the guys decide on their pizza of choice, I'm curious about Our Famous House-Baked Garlic Knots ""Six of our freshly baked and famously soft Garlic Knots."" ($4.95) and the Husband and waiter definitely agrees to my great choice.

The guys decide on a large of The Gotham ""Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Sausage, Green Peppers, Ground Beef, and Onions"" ($22.95).

We also decide to share a bottle of the Volpi, Barbera d'Asti from Piedmonte, Italy ($22).  It wasn't quite what we expected, but that was our fault.

Warm bread and butter are then brought to our table, which I find interesting to receive at a pizza shop.  We already have a lot of bread coming our way, but it's still appreciated.  

The garlic knots arrive with marinara sauce and it's so good - so good because it's doused in garlic butter!  Yum yum!  Your fingers are dripping from the oily goodness and I had more than my fair share.

When the pizza arrives, it looks pretty generous.  We all dive in and my first response is that ""It could be warmer...""  The Husband agrees because from his seat, he saw that the pizza had been sitting on the counter for our waiter to bring to us for awhile.  So it could have arrived piping hot like it should have.  Chunky pieces of sausage are the first thing I notice and the last thing I remember.  It's pretty good stuff, and yes, we had leftovers.

Overall, good pizza, huge restaurant space.  Service could be improved, especially by bringing our pizza over when it's ready.  (It was near empty when we came on a Saturday night.)  Other yelpers mentioned the cost, they do have coupons in the Entertainment Book to help with that concern.

When you are used to a certain quality its hard to change. Its on par with eating fresh pasta every day and then suddenly only being able to eat Spaghetti O's.
On this visit I really enjoyed myself though. I ignored prices (hard to do when they are so high) and went with the Olde New York pie. Really, really, really good. I ended up forcing myself to eat more than I should have because it tasted so good. Not really the NY style that I am used to but it was very good. The server was very nice and the place is clean and well kept.
The only negative is the price. Ok so I let myself go this time and put out the $23 and change for a large pie. Will I do it again? Probably not. If I had money to blow I would eat there all the time, so for you rich kids out there go for it!

They say pizza is one of the most unhealthy things you can eat, but with pizza this good how can you say no. I've been to Metro several times and been to several trendy award winning places and it comes down to consistency and quality and Metro has never failed to deliver. 

This visit we had a great deal on a couple of bottles of wine and created a combo pizza from a the Gotham and the Spring street pizzas. The Gotham has pepperoni , mushrooms, sausage, green peppers, ground beef, and onions. The Spring street is topped with meatballs, ricotta, and roasted peppers, Both pizzas had a crisp tasty crust and the topping were fresh, delicious, and in perfect harmony.

Metro pizza is the first pizza place that made an amazing dairy free pizza for me. Their dough is very good (I got the metro crust) which is pretty thick, but I like thick pizza. We tried their atomic fries that were delicious! Their garlic knotz were alright not the best I have had. The only reason they got 4 stars is because their service wasnt great.

I had to raise my voice to say ""light ice"" cause he was leaving. The place had about 4 customers, not so busy where he can't spend 20 extra seconds to listen. And second, I didn't like the presentation of the pizza. The meat appeared to just been thrown on it. Very cluttered all in the middle. Didn't look too appetizing; however, it did taste fine. We didn't finish the pizza and we decided not to take the leftovers home, because it was too greasy. But I think that's because of the extra meat, so it might be different with another pizza.

Before reading this, please understand, we are a low salt intake family. So when we say it has no salt or seasoning, it means literally none.

It was tasteless. Utterly bereft of seasoning. My calzone, which was supposed to be mushrooms, basil, tomato, and cheese had literally no basil in it. Not fresh, not even dry. No salt, no pepper, no seasoning AT ALL.  They just threw in the stuff and basically steam cooked it.The mushrooms and tomatoes were undercooked. The calzone was about 7 inches tall because they didnt cook it right. (hense the fillings being steamed.)

I would have sent it back, but we realized it wasn't just my meal that was tasteless. My husbands pizza was mediocre at best, with, again, practically flavorless sauce. 

Our childs ""mac n cheese"" was just some bland gross cheese sauce poured over pasta. I am pretty sure the cheese sauce was pre packaged glop. Velveta mac n cheese has more flavor... I would say velveta has too much salt, but seriously, did they put ANY salt, pepper or seasoning of any kind in the cheese sauce? If you want to make mac n cheese the easy way, just give us the pre packaged stuff and admit it.

It was so flavorless that I thought they were feeding us nursing home food. But I think even THAT would have some Italian seasoning. Honestly, does your chef even know how to cook Italian?

The bread was tastey, hard to mess up bread. I ate the bread and the calzone crust with gusto.

 The server was excellent. Friendly and prompt. We did not complain about our meal in the restaurant because we didnt want the server to get any possible backlash. Also because we knew the lack of seasoning must be a chronic issue.",jyUOok1iKM28xtVmDp6EsQ,2,0,1,qwVCY_bwMCzIiSToASx-cQ

The Good:
The sauce is seasoned beautifully and the cheese doesn't overpower it or the toppings.  The sausage was great and there was plenty on our pie. 

They deliver to casino hotels. 

Prices are in line with most pizza.  

It's really yummy!


The Bad: 
The delivery people never delivered to the same area twice! By that I mean we ordered pizza 3 times the week we were there (yup, kids!) once they delivered to the elevator area, once to the lobby and a third time to the concierge.  It was like ""Where the hell is Waldo with our pizza?"" It might have been easier to spot him if he were wearing a striped shirt and stocking hat!

I'm not much of a wing eater but my handsome wing-man is.  He said ""meh"" on the wings but scarfed the pizza pie like he hadn't eaten in a week! No leftovers on that. 

One star off for delivery confusion and meh wings. 

The Ugly:
You'll get home and crave it. 

A final note: 
It's just a dang good pie! Order up but give detailed instructions on where to meet if you're in a casino hotel. Carry your cell when going down to meet them, you'll need it!",0PR8FAwmcx8_CD2_vV617w,0,0,4,Ldsz_uPOYTbvQfF1NcqEXA

Alas, recently, I was in the neighborhood, was hungry, AND had some money to blow. Perfect scenario to try something new, amirite? 

The decor of the place is akin to your stereotypical, 80s/90s family restaurant. With red and white cheesecloth table coverings and everything. It actually made the place feel really comfy to me. I sat at the bar and ordered garlic knots and an ""individual sized"" (more on why I put that in quotes in a minute) Triple Play pizza, which was basically a Chicago-style thin crust pizza. 

In spite of the fact I ordered garlic knots, they STILL brought out bread and butter while I was waiting. So it was already clear how generous they were here. The garlic knots were huge and they were delightful. I'm talkin' drink the sauce and lick your fingers good. A slight gripe is that they could have been baked just a teeny little bit softer, but beyond that they definitely have to be the best garlic knots I've had after the ones at Chicago Brewing Co. 

What they call an individual pizza could easily serve two, three if we're talking light eaters. It had a cracker like crust with plenty of crunch to the bite, and was topped with  a generous helping of well-seasoned patty-style sausage. I made it through slightly less than half of it before I had to take the rest to go. 

My waitress frequently stopped by to ask how everything was and was refilling my drink without me even asking. To top off the already exceptional service, she gave me the tuesday night special (25% off your meal between 5 and 9 pm) in spite of the fact that I came in at four. What I thought would have been at least a $20 bill if not a little more ended up only being $14! I decided to just go on ahead and give her the rest of it as a tip!

It's a shame I didn't discover this place for myself earlier. I really do feel like I've been missing out now. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Home-y, slightly retro ambiance.
Generous portions.
Above and beyond service
One of the best pizzas in Vegas.
Pizza cooks who are competent with Chicago-style pizzas. 

Cons:
Garlic Knots could have been softer. But this is minor.

The description of this moment could go on and on but I will get to the point of this review, Metro Pizza. 

Let me start by saying, "" OOOOOOOHHHH YOU HAVETO GO"" We met some friends there for dinner and they had been there before so they have a good idea what they wanted but when we took a look at the menu it was very very hard to pick, hmmmm Do we want traditional pepperoni or may a BBQ pork and Pickle pizza. We ended up going with a stuffed meat pizza and the BBQ Pork and Pickle pizza. 

Once the pizzas made it to the table I had that eyebrow lifted, mouth partially open look because the pizza looked amazing and when I ordered the stuffed pizza the waiter asked if I wanted Tomato sauce or meat sauce, I found that odd since I had never been asked that before and when the pizza was set down I figured out why. they bring you a bowl of the sauce to put over the pizza instead of having it on the pizza, this was actually very very good.

Our party was seated and waited for forty minutes for the complimentary bread- we had to ask for it four times, while other servers were bringing it to their tables with no problem. Our server was openly hostile and I felt afraid to ask him for anything because he would snap at us. When he was taking our orders after we sat for a half hour, he forgot to take one of my friend's order, like, he just skipped her, and it took is another 20 minutes to flag him down. The place wasn't full at all, yet it took nearly an hour and a half for our food. I ordered the sliders and fries, which were served to me cold. Never once did he check on us. He refused to apply the yelp checkin special of A FREE SODA.  When it came time to pay, he wouldn't split our bill, nor would he charge separate amounts on different credit cards. After some managerial intervention, he finally agreed to charge our separate cards, but he overcharged us $40 total. At this point, we were done with him and just decided to argue the additional charges with the credit card company. If you go to Metro, do NOT be seated in this guy's section (skinny dude in his early 20's, spiky blond hair) unless you want to be served by an openly hostile, incompetent server who will ruin your evening.

Went last night 7-28-15 around 6:30. The Mexican waiter who barely spoke English really added to the ""authentic Italian"" mood in the restaurant.  It took 8 minutes after we were seated to finally be acknowledged and another 7 minutes before anyone took our drink order.  I almost left.

5837427,2011-12-08,5,Gen0ei06dGq13OJ8DRXUjg,"It had been several months since I visited Metro Pizza, and the first time I was prepared to review it.  I hoped it was as good as my previous visits.  In the most important respect--food--it was.  But in other ways the structure and operations need some overhaul.

First off, the front door was broken.  It was easy to know this since two hand-drawn signs on white pasteboard announced this on the broken door.  It would be far better to just fix it and take off the signs!  The restaurant looked nice from a distance all decked out for Christmas, including a lighted tree.  But our table in the auxiliary room was so wobbly that I had to keep my foot on the base to keep all steady--at which point I noticed massive chips of paint missing on the concrete floor that long ago had been painted red.  It is time for another coat!

Complimentary bread and pats of butter were an excellent combination.  The bread looked Italian but tasted like doughy sourdough.  Very nice--although with all the food to come it surely was not needed!   I ordered Minestrone Soup but a dinner salad arrived first.  Our server had warned me that the soup took more time so would come after the salad.  But I didn't quite understand the meaning of this.  I thought serving the soup would be merely dipping in the ladle and pouring it into a waiting bowl.  Not here!

The dinner salad, which comes with some dishes and can be ordered separately with others, was very good, graced by Metro Pizza's house dressing, a homemade spicy tomato-based Italian dressing good enough to be sold in unlabeled plastic containers and bought for a trip home by my Italian-American friends after we finished our dinner.  I almost bought a bottle myself but opted for frozen Dark Chocolate Gelato instead.  The salad itself consisted of fresh and chilled mixed greens, cucumbers, tomato, red onion, and carrot shavings.  Very tasty!

But the surprise hit of the evening for me was the Minestrone Soup that I thought had been forgotten 10 minutes after I had finished my salad and there was still no sign of the soup.  Just as I was about to hail my waiter, he came to our table hoisting a lovely large bowl of steaming soup chockfull of ingredients.  It had cut carrots, cauliflower florets, lima beans, garbanzo beans, kidney beans, Italian green beans, cut Rigatoni, sprinklings of fresh basil, gooey melted Mozzarella Cheese, and a few croutons that quickly dissolved in the spicy tomato-based broth.  The whole conglomeration was very hot, clearly made largely from scratch--not just sitting idle in a pot--and quite delicious.  It was a highlight of the meal, and would have been THE highlight if the pizza and pasta to come had not been so darned good, too

After years of regularly eating complete 15"" pizzas about once a week through my thirties, now to keep cholesterol under some control I limit myself to eat a whole pizza just once every two months.  Seriously, even though pizza has long been one of my favorite foods!  I certainly cheat with a slice here and there in the interim, but not with a whole pie.  In college I once won a fraternity pizza eating contest (1 hot slice consumed in 15 seconds), and even now am quite capable of devouring a whole medium pie in one sitting.  So, you can imagine that I am choosy about where I will eat pizza.  I can't afford to draw a charred clunker when I just have six pizzas a year.  I will try new places but they have to be highly recommended by persons whose judgment in food I trust--like Yelp friends.  For that reason, I will be trying the pizza at the not so secret and not so unknown place at the Cosmopolitan soon.  But in the meantime,  Metro Pizza is on my short list, along with Biaggio's.  And, the large slice of Ham Pizza with extra cheese that I snatched from my wife's pizza (with forewarning) was in fine form:   cheesy, saucy, and with tasty mild ham resting on perfectly cooked dough with a totally uncharred bottom and a nicely browned crust.

When my pasta arrived, it, too, looked lovely with sauteed fresh mushrooms spread over the saucy sauce.  It also looked huge--enough for two or three diners easy.  But, dig as I might with the large spoon provided, the dish was sans meatballs.  I found my server to remedy this significant oversight, and he quickly brought two cooked meatballs to the table that were bathed in Marinara Sauce.  This gave me an opportunity to sample the Marinara Sauce, and it was just as I like it best: hot, saucy, and very mild.  The authentic Italian meatballs, which only come as a pair, were also very good: dense, heat hot, and very tasty.  I flipped one onto my overflowing mound of Spaghetti & Meat Sauce with Mushrooms, and ate as much as I could.  The Spaghetti was nicely cooked, and the Meat Sauce tasted like a fine Bolognese.  For once I was happy to be taking home what felt like 3 pounds of leftovers for I don't know how many successive lunches.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,9,10,4,KhGF21dVMv14MhE-VVqlfg

How do I know all this ? By attending the class- ""Learn The Secrets of Hand-Crafted Pizza""- by  third generation pizza makers-the owners/cousins of Metro Pizza- as they shared the history, traditions and techniques of the pizzaiola. . This was a 3-hour ! class that included  recipes, hands-on instruction, great Italian wine and a delicious meal for about $25!   Yes you can even take home the pizza kit that they sell, but you will never get the crispiness and the crust generated by a blazing furnace with low ceiling that cooks the pizza in minutes, with fire reaching up to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit (the bottom of the oven  is fitted with Biscotto di Sorrento tiles above a layer of Vesuvian soil) and all the tender care of a pizzaiola ! So, skip the home cooked messy and soggy pizza, unless you are gluten sensitive and make your own.

These incredibly dedicated and talented cousins, not to mention award-wining pizza makers, with an enormous patience, have been doing this for quite some time on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month. I attended the class at the East Tropicana location on the 4th Tuesday of the month and it has left an indelible impression in my mind and the palate. This was not a class but a Italian feast. The cousins do this not because they need the money-they are millionaires over-with branches all over the Valley, but they do it for the love of the pizza and the love for the customers who savor a good pizza.


I personally like thin crust with the minimum toppings on it,.and pineapple is not one of them. They have pizza's for all tastes and toppings.  I am not recommending Metro Pizza for any gratitude, but they really have the best pizzas in Vegas. I have tried other locations but I always go back to the East Tropicana pizzeria, since they serve the best pizza''s in that location (may be because they got started in that location?)

This is a pizza that has to be rolled to eat, it doesn't stand on its own.  It is always fresh and delicious.

Not worth it if they make a mistake, because there is clearly no urgency to correct it. I'm not talking $30 bucks here. We were charged $124 TWICE.

Don't order from here. I wish we would have ordered somewhere else, eaten less delicious pizza for less money, and only been charged once.

Lettuce was fresh, they weren't stingy with the chicken and other  toppings and everything tasted great. I really didn't even need dressing to make it a great salad. 

Service was friendly and attentive. This was my first visit to this particular location and it's much nicer, cleaner and newer than other locations in town.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,10,4,hFbrpoeqiAGmi8h8s7_LYA

No way could you pick it up and eat it.",9KUhc-n364ZA5YCqPEfM1w,0,0,2,2VCK52FhHvL8ugmDKjU0Xg

And i was always  told you couldn't make good crust in Vegas because of the water....how wrong people are.  Their Honolulu pizza is the bomb.
