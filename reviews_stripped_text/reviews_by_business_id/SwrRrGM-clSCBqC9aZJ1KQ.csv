98972,2014-11-06,0,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"First time in Las Vegas, so we decided to give this place a try since we're staying at Stratosphere. The calamari was sub-par, the bacon wrapped shrimp was only okay. Neither offered any taste. The ribs looked amazing but it was way too sweet to swallow. The seafood fettuccini was the worst! It was so fishy to the point that it was inedible. When we asked the waiter about it, he said that the dish is normally fishy like that, which would've been nice to know before we ordered it. The shrimp scampi was probably the best dish we ordered. However, it looked like a child's meal with 4 shrimp and barely a handful of rice. The salmon fillets still had bones inside, but other than that, taste was okay. Service was great, but that was about the only positive thing I can say about this restaurant. We should've taken the hint when there were only about 5 tables there when we walked in.",pnUGLqjIaJutAd8FF9LrQQ,0,0,1,tF_-7pBgUsFErM7e5OplHg

822028,2012-12-26,1,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"This place made me sign onto Yelp and write a review again after a long hiatus. Simply put AMAZING. This place is in the conversation as the BEST place in all of Las Vegas. Yes I am serious. It is in fact the best ""hidden gem"" in Las Vegas. Apparently it has only been open for 3 months which explains why there are few reviews, but I promise you this place will blow up. Let 's get started.

    I litteraly wanted to try every appetizer they had however I asked our waiterss (Nicole) if she had choice of trying every single appetizer OR trying 3 of them and a steak which would she do? She replied "" Apps & steak"". I took her advice... and was I glad I did!!


Appetizer(s)

1. Applewood Bacon Jalapeno Prawns, 5 Stars, wonderfull! Flavorfull and delicous a solid choice!

2. Lobster Cake, 4 stars. It was good not exceptional, but very good.

3. PBJ Baggeutte with Bacon & Blue Cheese. Well words cannot describe this item. It is litteraly one of the best things I have ever eaten. So good in fact I ordered 2 of them, I am not ashamed to admit it! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not be discouraged by this item!! If you like blue cheese you will like this item!! I am a meat and potatoes guy, I really don't do much ""exotic"" stuff. trust me when I say, This item is legendary! 5 stars

Entree(s)

1. Fish and chips. 4 stars, very good but I am not a sweet potatoe fry fan, if I were it may get 4.5 stars. The Tartar sauce that came with it is excellent (my mother had this, I only had a couple bites)

2. Twin Lobster tails. 5 stars. It's hard to mess up lobster tails. LOL. These were a decent size and cooked perfectly. ( My sweetie had this, again only a few bites)

3. Ribeye Steak. 5 Stars. The key to this ladies and gents is to get the blue cheese butter!! AGAIN, GET THE BLUE CHEESE BUTTER! This was quite simply delicious!! Amazing steak! And they cook steak medium plus!! ( that's in between medium and medium well for those that don't know)

Sides

Corn on the Cob squares? Not sure on the techical name on these, but basically they are corn on the cob, grilled, sliced down the center and put into quarters. The have it with some spicy peppers so these have a kick!! However they were great! 5 stars

Mashed Potatoe Croquttes. Excellent cooked perfectly! Very tasty! 5 Stars! You only get 3 in an order though.

Desert

Well... I dare not even write about it, this was a ""special item"" that is only served on Christamas day! I don't want to get anyones hopes up only to not be able to try it. It was in my top 3 desserts I have ever had in my life! Yes, in my life!!! They will be having it back next year for Christmas, and, I will be there. I was threatened at gunpoint by my mother if I didn't take her back here. And if you were wondering... I ordered two of these as well :) LOL.


In a nutshell this place was beyond my hopes and dreams! If your a local this is one of the few reasons to travel to the strip! If your not local you have to go here before going back home! Trust me, you won't regret it!!! The prices for a steakhouse on the strip are VERY reasonable! They could charge double for thier items easily.",npaDTu4Kx6ubVKkOrYDPiA,2,0,5,Sxg-8n-LwJ5dBzuokYX0mA

919580,2014-02-18,1,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"I will say this first. Our waiter Joey was amazing. Best thing about this place. 

Now the food . . . Oh, the food. Appetizers did the opposite. Crackling calamari was disgusting. The squid was bland and overly oily. The spicy aioli was pretty much just mayo. The lollipop chicken wings were the best thing taste wise, but the chef needs to learn how to properly prepare these. Requires more than just scraping the top part of the flesh from the bone.

Given we ordered a salad for dinner here, so I wasn't expecting much. The chopped chicken salad was a joke. The ingredients didn't taste fresh, pretty sure the mushrooms and olives were from a can. The chicken was massacred and thrown at the bottom so you could see the poor knife skills. The Caeser Salad was sheer ridiculousness. Frankly if you can count the individual amount of Parmesan cheese in your salad on one hand, there is an issue. The dressing only tasted of mayo. 

Wish we did not come here to eat. I would avoid any of these items if you come here. I say again however, service was great.",wx2G7DcIbD5zPl6ZjyVK4w,3,0,1,hsMMIB0FfY_JpDydvmXGmg

First off the jalapeno bacon fried shrimp is ridiculously good - it's unfair.  Then their whiskey selection was a blast!  Blantons, Four Roses Single Barrel, and some fun apple infused whiskey they do in house kept me smiling.  I came in on the Travelzoo 3-course Prix Fixe and was blown away by the value.  The caesar was nearly perfect - crisp chopped hearts of romaine, not too much dressing, crunchy croutons, could have done with maybe an anchovie and more parm but I'm a caesar fiend, and was overall very pleased with the freshness and portion.  My filet was cooked perfectly as was the buttery petite lobster tail, and the pureed potatoes w green beans was homestyle comfort executed without a hitch and presented beautifully.  It's important that green beans still have a little snap, and they did.  By the time the ice cream and berries came I was well set so even though it was delicious I could only eat half.  All in all, a fantastic restaurant especially for the price.  You could pay 4 times as much for another Grill or Steakhouse on the strip and the cut may or may not be any better, but you'll be fully satisfied and still might have money left over for other things after McCalls.

1209353,2017-01-19,1,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"I haven't had to do one of these in a long long time. I'm just going to be honest: this was worst restaurant experience I've had in years. 

Spoiler alert. I never even got to eat a meal. 

Let's start with getting my table. I saw many tables available, and the hostess said sorry we're full. ""You can sit at the bar."" I saw a second hostess and asked her the same thing. She said there's a table. I waited several minutes at the front. The reason? They couldn't find a menu. (Or were out of menus). I said I don't need a menu after I found out the reason for the holdup. They promptly handed me a take out pamphlet and sat me. 

Here's what happened after I sat down: 

NOTHING. 

I was next to that kitchen and I must've been passed 40 times by staff. 

21 minutes after sitting down, I got my first ""have you been helped"". I said no, and asked to speak to the manager. 

Here's what happened after I asked for the manager:  

NOTHING 

11 minutes later the manager approached , looked at me and then proceeded to take the next tables order!!! 

After the manager took the order for the table of six, he walked by me again, and came back a few minutes later. 

I really think he just hoped I would leave. 

Nope. Sorry. 

38 minutes In: the conversation finally starts with the manager. His name is Christo. I told him everything. He explained that they are understaffed. And that he himself isn't just running this restaurant. He's busy with the hotel buffet and another restaurant. And he apologized. I told him the truth, that this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. And I told him I need to give people a heads up. That I'm going to write my first review in a long time. At this point in the conversation, his attitude changed to be much nicer, more caring. Showed empathy when he didn't before. He offered me a free meal. And extended his hand. I shook it.

We were hungry and did not really want to go far, so we decided to hit this spot up. We saw the Happy Hour sign that said all appetizers were half off and drinks were 2 for 1. Bet. Literally, all but one appetizer was half off during happy hour and they were all full sized appetizers. My cousin and I ordered 4 dishes (wings, crab cake, quesadillas and spinach dip) and we both ordered a drink; our bill came tallied up to just under $32! But, on top of that, the food was actually good. And, I was most impressed with the crab cake. It was a pretty decent sized crab cake with little filler for about $6.50. We left full, in our bellies and in our pockets.

So, fast forward to the next day. After getting back from riding ATVs in the ""desert,"" we were hungry. We had talked the HH special up to our other cousin, so we were pretty hype to go back. I mean, we had big plans. We were going to order like everything on the menu lol and ball the eff out. Well, to our disappointment, a brand new HH special had been implemented that day. The new happy hour menu was about 4 items total and the portions, based on what the bartender said, were smaller. WHAT?! We were so sad lol...but, we were also so hungry, so we settled. I ordered the happy hour wings which was half the size of the wings we shared the day before, and I ordered the crab cake, which was still really good. 

So, I really have nothing else to say because I planned on bigging up their happy hour menu, but sadly, it's no 'mo. All good things come to an end.",KEweJ1qFtkYYrhXeLgRmyg,3,0,3,6k8LX13qAbfAZn3M7PZN8A

The high points: the meat was perfectly cooked, the waitor was outstanding, the bar manager was fantastic! The specialty drinks are outrageous! And the calamari App was fried delicately and fresh with a beautiful dipping sauce that was equally fresh!  The low points; the baked potatoe had been cooked beyond its freshness and it was inedible! The sauce under my steak had ""broke"" and separated which really caused it to taste like an oily version of grocery store gravey. And really to spend a hundred dollars on two dishes, i can think of at least 10 other steak houses in Vegas that are better! In short; You absolutely should come here for apps and their ridiculously awesome specialty drinks, you won't regret it. But for a steak dinner, go elsewhere! I recommend Camelot Steakhouse.

The food: a couple of us had the prime ribeye and it was just ok, not worth the $34 price though. Wine by the glass selection was decent and reasonably priced.

Inside the casino we started looking for food and McCall's drew our attention. It was a late lunch and the food and service were great.

She had a lobster cake sandwich and I had a pork loin sandwich and we both had fries and drinks. Both meals were excellent and I find that it is generally a hit-or-miss thing when these cafes make their own ""homemade"" fries, but the chef here knew how to crisp them up nicely.

We had a TravelZoo voucher for a three course filet and lobster dinner, so that's what my wife and I both had.  Plus an appetizer sampler.  The appetizers were perfectly acceptable, although not spectacular.  And there was nothing on the plate that set off my ""yuck"" reaction.  (I am a #nevercalamari type of guy.)  My soup course was very good.  The filet lacked a whole lot of flavor; the portion I took home actually made a better steak sandwich for the next day's lunch.  The lobster came with garlic butter - what's not to like?  I would eat snails if they were drenched in garlic butter, and in fact I frequently do.  Dessert was ice cream and berries, which is pretty much self-explanatory.  I wasn't screaming ""Eat your heart out, Dairy Queen,"" but it was yummy.

3007132,2015-04-28,6,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"This review is based solely on my experience at the bar, not the restaurant...

I showed up around 10:15 PM on a Thursday night, about 45 minutes before closing so the hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the table for one in the bar area or if I wanted to sit at the bar.  Since I don't drink, I opted to sit at the table.  I looked the menu over and wasn't sure what I wanted.

Elijah, the bartender, noticed I was sitting there and came up to ask if I wanted anything to drink so I asked for a virgin piña colada.  He went to make my drink and came back a few minutes later.  I totally forgot to tell him I dislike whip cream so I asked if he could just scoop it out for me, which he said ""I'll just make you a new one.""  I told him it wasn't necessary, but he did it any way.  He told me that it would be better if I moved to the bar so I did...

I told him I wasn't too hungry so he recommended that I just order an appetizer.  He said the applewood bacon wrap shrimp was a good choice and he was not wrong.  It was very good!

But I like varieties, and who doesn't, so I decided to order the beef tenderloin quesadilla as well; however, this appetizer was a bit of a let down because it was dry and not really what I had in mind taste-wise.  I took a few bites and he noticed that I didn't look too impressed so he asked if he could take it off my bill.  I told him I was fine paying for it since it was my own choice to order it.  He kept insisting on taking it off my bill, but finally after I said ""no"" multiple times, he just paid for my drink.  Which was very sweet of him.

I appreciate great service even when the food doesn't always live up to my expectations.  He asked me to come back on Sunday night because he was off on Friday & Saturday, so he can make it up to me for the quesadilla not living up to my expectations.  I told him it wasn't like he was the chef so he doesn't have to make anything up to me.  Lol

But I did return on Sunday night at around 11 PM, after I had finished having my late night dinner at a nearby Thai restaurant.  He asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him to make me anything that has zero alcohol.  He made me some kind of mixed drink which I asked him what the name was.  He said it didn't have a real name because he just made it for me so we jokingly called it a ""Sivilay"".  Lol

Even though I'm not a drinker nor do I ever frequent a bar, I would come back here just because of the wonderful service...and order a ""Sivilay"" just because I feel so special to have my own drink.  Hahaha

The minus 1 star is based solely on the quesadilla being a let down...nothing personal Elijah!",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,7,6,4,9fGECx6VYcWNXj8AaTvqPA

Staff is lovely. Mostly efficient - one out of 3 not so much). The place was never busy during happy hour. A few people scattered at the bar - but no one in the restaurant at all. The decor is quite nice - dark and moody. I really did enjoy that.

Clientele is everyone from everywhere so you get a great mix of friendly folks, cowboys (convention in town) and not so friendly folk. I tried the black and blue chip stack, the bacon wrapped prawns and the steak potato skins. Super cheap at happy hour! The chip stack is a really interesting idea but terribly brought to life. It's just about inedible. The chips are one solid mass and the beef is just dropped on top with a tiny amount of scallions/tamatoes and some bleu cheese. Every bite is either all chip or all bleu cheese. Same problem you find with nachos but if you do your nachos right, it's no problem. The prawns were probably my favorite. Nice flavor and a good amount of real food. The skins were just okay. Not too much flavor. Everything was somewhat overcooked.

Ambience was quite quiet and pleasant and the four people in our group felt comfortable speaking privately. Our waitress was knowledgeable and clearly a professional at her job. She was also friendly, helpful and a pleasure to have as our host.
We all four chose the 8oz filet mignon and lobster tail three course special and were not disappointed. Both the tomatoe bisque and Caesar salad starters were very tasty. Lobster was delicious and the filet cooked perfectly to order. We appreciated the flexibility on a substitution on the filet for one of our party. Dessert was a delicious collection of fresh berries with ice cream. We paired the meal with several glasses of Pinot Noir and enjoyed an unhurried and enjoyable experience.

I choose this place following my wedding reception. The staff sent away 2 of my guest due to ""not having the table ready.""  Imagine our surprise to see everyone sitting in the bar area at 9:30 for a 845ish reservation.  After we asked what was going on with the seating in the bar. The unprofessional female manager informed our guests (Including a Judge and Medical Doctor) that they did not say that. Think that's all? Not even. Well my mother who set up the invitations was told by text message that 10 meals would be charged. It turns out that the restaurant spokesperson sent the wrong text to my mom. Sooooooo, again we had to eat the bill.  After being seated in the nat filled, hot, unprepared room, we had lack of any service. I had to personally run down waiters 3 times to please turn on the air.  After dining with our okay meals, we were told they were having management send up a refrigerator to store our extra meals. 2 hours later- NO UNIT!  So, at 2am I had to go downstairs to get the hotel manager to send one up. (Not his fault, the restaurant did not even tell him to send one).
Next, to add insult to injury, I went to Heartland Grill where again we were met by the same ugly manager.  I politely asked her to warm the food up and reminded her of the situation.  I informed her that I had called room service from the suite and that they did not have ""a microwave.""  With a smirk she said that they were not to heat food up because of health standards. (I can understand this)  So, I asked for a courtesy dinner or perhaps a remake of the meal.  She said that she was not going to do this.  I asked for her manager.  She informed me that she had ""No Manager."" Additionally, she turned to her bald headed (orange shirt) coworker and said she was glad she ""Fucked my wedding up.""
Finally, I went to the desk again and met with one of your staff.  He stated that he was going to send up a microwave and apologized for the Heartland Grill Managers behavior.  He also informed me that there was a food and beverage director and that he was going to relay this info to him.

Everything was wonderful except for the Heartland Grill.  They really need to be more prepared and professional.  I feel as if they had a little better leadership they could meet more peoples needs.",8fAhfcG88aKArPhgfZgIUg,2,0,1,Kjxwx3gIIJSr0CgYFEWWUA

But the food here is very, very average.  As is the decor and energy of the restaurant.

The complementary bread basket was so sweet.   The butter with it was sweet.  Since when has the preference been sweet over savory???
We ordered the Bacon & Jalapeno Prawns as the starter, sitting in a gigantic puddle of BBQ sauce which at first impressions wasn't very appealing.  However to our surprise it was good, apart from the fact the sauce tasted like McDonald's BBQ sauce.
We shared the St Louis Ribs dish and the Cajun Chicken & Sausage Pasta.
The Ribs although were cooked well, had the worst flavored, sickly sweet sauce that almost reminded me of some kind of teriyaki sauce with a bunch of chillies thrown in there.  It was slightly more edible when you scrapped the excess off with your knife. 
To be honest I would have preferred the McDonald's flavored sauce instead.
It came with nothing but some decoration slithers of potato.  Who serves ribs with no sides?? Rip off.
The pasta was ok.  Nothing Cajun about it but as far as pastas go it was ok.  Perhaps renaming it would be better?   The fresh basil was a nice touch though.

3974456,2013-06-06,2,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"Dinner at McCall's Heartland Grill  was a great start to a fun evening at the Stratosphere.  When I was here in May to see Pin Up, I walked around the casino to see if anything had changed because I hadn't been to the Stratosphere in many years.  As I was walking around, McCall's caught my eye.  I didn't see a menu outside but I checked it out when I got home.  Since I had a ticket to see Frankie Moreno last night, I made a reservation at McCall's to give the place a try.

I started out getting the PBB&J crostini, something I'd read in Yelp reviews.  How could I resist?  It's 4 slices of toasted baguette with peanut butter, bacon, bleu cheese and drizzled with jalapeño jelly on a bed of some shredded lettuce, sliced cucumber, red onion, and some red bell pepper.  It is excellent and what a different start to a meal.  The only thing I'd do differently is to up the jalapeño in the jelly and give it some kick.  The appetizer was delightful!  While eating the crostini, a server brought the bread basket.  Wow!  What a selection!  I had one cheese stick because I had enough bread with the crostini and I didn't want to fill up on bread.

For the main course, I got the coffee rubbed NY Strip steak with bleu cheese butter.  I got a side of their cheese croquettes.  The steak was done perfectly, charred on the outside, blue on the inside.  The cheese croquettes were good but I would have used more cheese or a stronger cheese.  It just didn't have a strong cheese flavor.  Both dishes had very thin slices of leeks that were blanched in hot oil just enough to give them a crisp.  What a tasty and different topping to food rather than a sprig of parsley!

Yes, of course I had room for dessert, and I ordered the triple chocolate flourless cake.  It was very good.  Rich chocolate with whipped cream that was thick and seemed to have some mascarpone whipped in.  

Service was excellent.  Everyone at McCall's had a smile, greeted customers very pleasantly, and were courteous and helpful and it started with the hostess.  My server was VInce and he was top notch.  He checked back with me every course at least once, and he refilled my iced tea without me needing to ask.  The only service fail was my obsession with keeping the table clean.  It wasn't until the end of the meal that a server removed my three empty artificial sugar packets.  That's my gold standard of excellent service all other things being equal.

I'll come back to McCall's.  It really is a nice room, nothing too fancy, but good food at good prices for being on the Las Vegas Strip--even the North Strip.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,5,4,oaQs-_770BGciMWXsGDUjA

Not what I was expecting, seemed kind of bland and was served with a side of homemade picante/salsa? The two didn't seem to go along together well. On the plus side the steak was nice and tender when picked off of the potatoes. Had the bacon beef burger, it was just okay all around. Nothing special. Served with a side of over seasoned fries. The sauce on the burger was some bbq sauce that seemed to stand out in a good way. Husband had the ribeye sandwich, it was huge and nearly impossible to eat without making a huge mess. He didn't seem crazy for it taste wise. Overall the food took WAY too long to come out. We sat here for probably +40 minutes before our main course came. Seriously I lost my appetite completely by the time my burger came, took a bite or two and asked for the check + to go boxes. When asked to refill a soda the guy disappeared for 7 minutes and then a different server finally came by to fill the soda. Wtf? There were a few people here at this time, so I'm unsure why everything took so long. Food is overrated here.

4234805,2017-01-04,5,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"After the long drive from California, the hubby and I were happy to find a place in the Stratosphere that served salmon.  We had been craving it for a couple of days.  As others noted, McCall's is pretty fancy and we didn't realize it until we walked in.  We were definitely underdressed but no worries...we were treated as if we had prepared for the occasion.  Our server (I believe her name was Kim?) was excellent.  She was very personable and knowledgeable about the menu.  Even though we told her that we had been craving salmon all day, she still let us know about the day's specials just in case we decided to change our minds.  We didn't.

The bread basket came out first and was served with a sweet cream butter.  It was perfect to nibble on while we waited for our dinner.  The salmon was served with a rice pilaf that went quite well with it.  We expected a veggie to go along with the meal but the salmon and rice was actually very filling.  The salmon was seasoned pretty well but it was a bit overdone.

I ordered the seafood trio (crab cake, butter poached petite lobster tail, and shrimp scampi). At $42.00, the trio is extremely overpriced considering it isn't served with any accompaniments. I ordered buttermilk mashed potatoes for an additional $6.00. The crab cake was the best of the trio but would have been better if it wasn't served on a bed of overdressed cole slaw. The lobster tail was overdone and underseasoned. The shrimp scampi was overdone but seasoned well. The mashed potatoes were good and tasted homemade.

McCall's is a good place for special occasions if you want to splurge. Perhaps the steaks and poultry dishes are better choices from the menu - most of them are served with chef's accompaniments for the same price as the seafood items.

4475842,2016-02-16,0,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"This place is mediocre at best. We were enticed by the looks of the place, but left severely disappointed.

Positives:
1) the Ambiance is very nice.
2) the hostess was very friendly.
3) the waiter was also very friendly.
4) the assorted bread basket was very good (my wife quipped ""they must get it from somewhere else"")
5) The French Onion soup was descent. Not the best I've had, but certainly not the worst, and had we left it at that, I probably wouldn't be writing this review. 

But alas, then came the rest:

Negatives:
1) the Bloody Mary was nothing more than bland canned tomato juice, vodka, Tabasco, a couple olives and a dash of black pepper. No self-respecting bartender would ever try to pass this bright red concoction off as a Bloody Mary.  I snagged some Worcestershire sauce and raw horseradish from the waiter to attempt a rescue. There was no lime, no celery, no zing to the ""mix"". We've had better on airplanes that use Mr and Mrs T's spicy bloody mary mix. This was an absolute joke for something that should be a no-brainer. 

2) the Makers Mark Manhattan was heavy on the bitters and maraschino. Not so good, but at least not as bad as the bloody.

3) my wife's Crab Cakes tasted so-so flavor wise but they were soggy, mushy and dense. Sadly, the texture turned them more into Crap Cakes than Crab Cakes.

4) now for the biggest joke: I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the Kansas Chopped Salad adding the optional ""tenderloin tips"" and blue cheese dressing.  The menu description says: ""Seasonal greens tossed with smoked cheddar, avocado, other market fresh ingredients and your choice of dressing."" I was thinking that I'd get something approaching the Steak Salad available at your local YardHouse restaurant minus the pickled egg and not as big.  What I actually got was Iceberg lettuce (which I can't stand and definitely is not ""seasonal mixed greens""), smoked cheddar (which was good), a single slice of avocado (that I had to hunt for profusely because I was about to send it back for not having it), blue cheese dressing (which was good). The Tenderloin Tips? Let's just say it was pretty close to the meat you find in a frozen Steak-uum sandwich. It was so sub-par.  Perhaps some of their other dishes are executed better, but this was what I would expect from a McDonalds salad.",IsupLN3R_plsyaBhfwbteQ,1,0,2,ItP8HFIJ83Vuv1rf33pb6A

The surf and turf dinner came with green beans and mashed potatoes. The potatoes though lukewarm had a nice garlicky flavor but the green beans were very bland. 

My favorite part of the meal was dessert. Vanilla ice cream served on top of fresh berries and drizzled with a strawberry sauce. Perfect cap to our dinner. 

Overall I think it was a great deal on Groupon. I think I paid $57 because I had booked it during one of those 25% off deal times.  The atmosphere was nice and romantic and service was top notch. We didn't get to use the coupon for the Radius Rooftop bar because they closed at 9pm but the coupon is good until the end of the year so we got time.",BpJWttiu9h5cgxtVkQZGXw,6,5,3,3GV6DkeIG00Og_Hbl6U6fA

My Steak was overcooked, tough, and no flavor. I sent it back, and it took forever to be brought back out. (The Restaurant was NOT Busy at the time)

My friends had already completed their dinner by the time my steak was returned. The bill did not reflect any discounts for my terrible dinner experience, so I complained to the waiter, and the General Manager. The manager ended up talking to me and apologizing for what happened, stating my dinner was supposed to have been removed from the bill. He ended up giving me his business card and asked me to return on my next visit. 

As a result of my discussion, I will come back and give them another chance.

5225853,2014-01-02,0,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"Located in the Stratosphere, this restaurant exceeds my expectations by far. Walking into the Stratosphere, I didn't necessarily expect anything amazing since the vibe and the quality of the Stratosphere is, to be blunt, not as upscale as the middle of the strip.

When we entered at 6:30PM, we were immediately seated in the bar area (you MUST be 21+ to sit here). Normally, you have to make reservations for the back, non-bar area. Immediately once we were seated, our drink orders were taken. Happy hour ends at 7PM! 

SERVICE:
I'm pretty sure the front area was understaffed. I only saw one cheerful and bubbly waitress the entire hour we were there. Only when I was leaving did I start to see other servers come out to help. We waited 20 mins for our food, but they do serve all your dishes together, and still hot!! What made the service for me was the incredibly friendly waitress. She was quick and prompt, and kept checking up on us. I have no other word to describe her, except bubbly!

They did charge us two cups of coffee...I don't know why but they did. But the hostess was easy to work with and took it off our bill immediately, no questions/arguments asked.

FOOD:
We ordered a few minutes later: raspberry wave (vodka), margarita blended with a salted rim, bloody marry, Calamari, Kansas Chopped Salad with Beef Tenderloin Tips, 1lb Steak, and ribs. They start you off with sweet bread and butter; unexpected but I liked it! It's not crazy sweet, but it's definitely lightly sweetened - heads up!

The raspberry wave is a vodka drink that is super sweet. I loved it! There wasn't any alcoholic taste and it had a little carbonation, which was awesome. The margarita, well, was a margarita. The bloody mary is okay, but I personally do not like tomato juice and any the spicy after taste.

The calamari is good. Fried small rings of calamari with fried green onion on top to give it that nice crunchy texture. There was chili tartar and cilantro pesto sauce that was delicious!

The Kansas Chopped Salad was greens with smoked cheddar, avocado, and your choice of dressing. There are no sour dressings, except balsamic so don't ask for thousand island or anything. The salad was pretty good though! The cheddar was cubed and the smokey taste was a nice change. The put the dressing on the side instead of drenching the salad, props!

The 1 lb. steak actually isn't that big. The steak is actually a T-bone, meaning you get both a filet and rib-eye. It's like a two for one! I asked for medium rare and it was cooked nicely. The meat was tender and still very moist. The sauce was dark and salty. I'm not exactly sure what it was but it wasn't overpowering and kept me dipping my steak back in it! There was a small side of caramelized onions; wish there was more. The steak also comes with either a side of baked potatoes or fries. If you want a loaded baked potato it's $3 more. I thought the loaded was worth it though; it comes with generous portions of sour cream, green onion, cheese, bacon bits, and butter. You can also ask for more for no charge. Impressive. 

Food: 4/5. Service: 4/5.",5aBgQUMlBdan9TsjR4ZZZA,4,1,4,rjOWps8ko0721q9vYT3gKQ

We were greeted by the hostess and when we requested a table (for two), she explained there would be a ten minute wait. At first glance inside the restaurant, there were only two tables being served so we found that to be super odd. But we waited and were eventually seated in the near empty restaurant. Several minutes later, our water glasses were filled but no waiter. Our waiter finally made his way over to our table and took our drink order (and our food since we had waited for about 15 minutes). Service was super slow and it took a while to get everything, despite there only being a few tables. The food was ok. Nothing really stood out. My husband ordered a steak but it was overcooked. I had the ceaser salad, which had way too much dressing. Would have ordered dessert and more drinks but service was way too slow.",TD02uOmfki-d3_ZEWPNyfA,3,1,2,tqY3UTnoP2wa75vZ1vY95A

To start, our concierge recommended this place to us. It was about 10 pm and he said try have a great happy hour with food and drink specials. I don't know how he could work in the same hotel as this place and get it so wrong. We sat down and asked what the happy hour specials were and our waiter said well happy hour is 7-9 pm. 

We ordered the sampler platter, our waiter forgot it, so I don't know if that was any good. He apologized though and offered us a free dessert. I ordered the rib eye sandwich and was less than underwhelmed. To start, it wasn't like any rib eye sandwich I've ever had, it was just a thick piece of meat on soggy/extremely greasy bread. It was tough to chew and was not very tasty. When you order a sandwich like this you expect very thinly sliced, tender beef. The fries were just okay, a little too salty.

5838065,2014-09-10,3,SwrRrGM-clSCBqC9aZJ1KQ,"I just found a gem of a restaurant hidden in plain sight, and it is McCall's Heartland Grill.  Comfortable and appealing to look at in a contemporary dining room, and at the lower end of Strip restaurant prices, the food was well executed and delicious.  A complimentary Bread Basket contained a variety of baked goods, including a cute miniature roll, cheesy cracker-style bread, and a spicy breadstick, along with both regular butter and a tin of wonderful sweet butter.  An ordered appetizer of very good hot Bacon-wrapped Prawns furnished something else tasty to eat.

A very good small ceramic vat of French Onion Soup Gratinee au Gratin featuring well-caramelized onions and an ample topping of well-melted Gruyere Cheese was next up for me, while Diane loved her cup of Potato Soup, the soup du jour.  A service error resulted in presentation of a rather large Chopped Salad to me and one of my table mates, although we had both requested a Garden Salad, which was $4.00 cheaper and I assume less bountiful.  Plus, I had requested Orange Miso Dressing, and just before arrival of our entrees our server apologetically informed me that he was informed that no such dressing was available this night, and neglected to tell me earlier because of waiting on another table.  So, quite belatedly I selected Bleu Cheese Dressing instead.  But now, as a direct result of the delay in alerting me about the need to select a different salad dressing, a Chopped Salad was laid before me only about 2 minutes ahead of the entree, and I had to eat my salad concurrently with a Loaded Baked Potato and an 8 oz. Charred Filet Mignon.  Moreover, because no one in my party had ever eaten here before, we did not know what the restaurant's version of a Garden Salad looked like.

But the more complex Chopped Salad that I was served was impressive, including thin Potato Sticks, wedges of avocado, Black Olive halves, pieces of tomato, mushrooms, mixed greens, and a creamy Bleu Cheese Dressing.  And my Baked Potato with butter, chives, and pieces of actual bacon was well prepared.

As for my Charred Filet, I asked that it be only lightly charred and cooked medium rare, and my wishes were fulfilled on both counts.  With a deep-fried mushroom on top and deep-fried Onion Ring on the bottom, the steak was buttery and excellent in all respects, and further enhanced by an off-menu specially requested drinkable Bearnaise Sauce, Mushroom Sauce, and Red Wine Reduction Sauce.

When the checks came, they each listed a Chopped Salad rather than the less expensive Garden Salad, but the manager changed the charges to reflect what we had actually ordered instead of what we unwittingly ate, which was a nice but probably appropriate gesture.  Service was otherwise sound and attentive.

I will definitely return here--sooner rather than later.  4-1/2 earned stars overall!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,5,4,H_OkTtfSnv6x0ajKluo2qw
