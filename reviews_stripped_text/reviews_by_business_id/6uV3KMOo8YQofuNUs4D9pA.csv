The service at this location is good. I'm always blown away when staff make eye contact and enunciate. I was blown away! Oh and my order wasn't all jacked up either, that indicates that they were actually listening. How nice!",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,2,0,4,xo_ReA85VmNaXzo6yxbO9w

The line when I arrived was around 15 people.  Half the staff was not servicing the line, and a couple others appeared to be just wondering around, not doing anything.  When I finally got to the counter after 15 minutes of waiting,  instead of them making my sandwich, a different employee started arguing with them about how they had screwed up previous orders.  So they argued about this for a while before one of them stoppe makingthe sandwich he was making to remake others, all while the counter was full of people waiting to eat.  

When I finally got my sandwich I had to wait in another large line to pay.  They had one person working the cash register, and he was clearly overwhealmed and confused.  They did not have anyone try to come help him.  I was finally able to pay and get my lunch, in all it took 30 minutes to get a sandwich made.  

I emailed the manager to let him know about the experience, he made some excuses, didn't seem to care about his employees taking a half hour to make a sandwich.  

I think there used to be a different manager there who always worked the register, and things ran smoothly, but the last couple times he has not been there.",8_ZX0bex4OUGI63tuMhjIQ,1,0,1,LseujX319DO5IqY78c0MTA

Contrary to some other Reviews about the portions/meat being large/huge don't be fooled, not here. Besides being disappointed by the Business Name not being associated with the Dining Experience, I encountered Processed Meat on Regular Sandwich Bread that they called ""Rye"". So, if you're longing for an Actual New York Type Deli, this isn't the place for either of us. I did give it ""1-Star"" for two reasons: 1) That's the lowest rating possible by Yelp, and 2) I did get a Smoothie (that's found at every New York Deli in the world :) ) that was actually HUGE and worth the Price.

The chicken, sauce, and cheese were nothing special.  All seemed to have been pre-made, not exactly what you would expect from a ""Brooklyn Deli"".  The bread was the best part, and the portion was a good bang for the buck.

The coleslaw was average, and came in a ketchup takeout ramekin, disproportionate to the sandwich for sure.  Banana peppers were jarred, no surprises there.

I decided to order the cheesesteak sandwich. The lady first cut my huge piece of bread and placed the ingredients in it. To make it hot she microwaved the poor thing for 1 minute on super power. In fact when she took it out of the nuclear machine it burned her hand. Once the radiated thing they call a sandwich was ready to eat the bread had that just microwaved hardness to it. Bottom line this place is not good on you pocket book or your taste buds.

I think the sandwiches here are good, but I think what keeps the crowds coming back are the lunch specials. Half a sandwich, a side and a drink for $5 is tough to beat. Even a whole sandwich at $6.99 is fair. There are all kinds of other combos too, salad and soup, soup and sandwich, it goes on and on. The sandwiches are a good size, even the half would be mistaken for a whole by most people. I've enjoyed the mozzarella and tomato, a few of the turkey options and the BLT with avocado. All tasty but what really impressed me on my last visit was the Italian bread. It was still warm!!! Major points. Their wheat and such is fine, but this was the best way to have a sandwich I think. So glad I blurted out Italian. That's the other thing with this place...cut the small talk in line and start reading because when it's your turn to order you better be ready. It's an assembly line of efficiency and I am almost always caught off guard and stumble through my order.

After today, I will no longer return. Their customer service has diminished terribly, the sandwiches are decent, but for $8 I can go to many other places. 
My favorites are the Cajun Avocado Turkey and the Chicken Salad Sandwich. Today, I drove 15 minutes  (20 with the horrible construction traffic on Sunset) to get a chicken salad sandwich for lunch. I ordered my usual, paid, and drove back to work. Once I got to work I opened my sandwich and saw I had received a plain turkey sandwich. wth! I did not drive all the way over there for a turkey sandwich. I called, the guy on the phone was immediately rude when I told him they had given me the wrong sandwich. He said ""bring it back then!""..  I told him I was at work and I could not drive back over, would not be able to go back that way until Monday. His response ""well bring it back then""..  How the hell am I going to hold on to a sandwich for 3 days just so that I can take it back to them?? I asked for his name and he did not respond, I asked again and he said ""Bob"". Bob, that was the the most ignorant response I've ever heard to help rectify an issue with an order that you guys screwed up! 

I've tried several other sandwiches and soups from here, but none of them are worth a return visit. Aside from the horrible service, it's annoying that they call this a ""Brooklyn Deli"".  This is a very poor representation of a Brooklyn deli!",yBzF3oQa2nJsqoEJb5Q0ag,2,0,1,Ob4nUmdV6UxveUuN3Svq0A

I ordered the corned beef sandwich on marble rye bread and it was pretty decent, 
I must say.  I enjoyed it.  

I DO HAVE TO SAY THOUGH, that my bread was thicker and meatier than the corned beef between it.  I guess they wanted me to have plenty of room to taste the bread by itself without any meat getting in the way.  And I ASSURE YOU, the meat stayed clear the hell out of the way.  Each slice of bread was 1 inch thick, so I was literally eating through 2 inches of bread, seriously (I actually pulled my ruler out of my desk and measured it, I know it sounds anal :( but I'm just saying)).. I'm still hungry, that's what I'm saying.

All in all, the sandwich was good and so far it is the best I have found here in LV, but I am still searching.  Nothing like the corned beef from Lou's Deli in Detroit, MI, but still good and I will return when I am not as hungry as I was today.

They made it fresh right in front of me.  It had a good portion of meats, sauce etc.  My only complaint at all was that I do think the place is a bit pricey for what they are offering.  Although the portions were good, I still spent $11.46 on a sandwich, chips, and a drink.  We know we can get cheaper lesser quality other places, so it really depends on you.

Now based on a Las Vegas market (which when it comes to certain foods, lacking is the word that comes to mind) Delis are few and far between. At this time any deli out in these parts is a novelty. Other options include making a sandwich at home. Now this defeats the purpose of a deli-To have a delicious sandwich on the go with all the sides and trimmings with no prep or clean up.
H.B.D as far as local food of this genre has the competition beat. Of coarse the comp is the likes of Subway, Quiznos, port o' shit, and Jason's deli. All in all these are franchise delis and will never give you the real mom and pop, nitty gritty New York Deli style food much in demand world wide. 
I have eaten four different sandwiches at H.B.D (pastromi, cornedbeef, turkey club, sausage and peppers)all which satisfied my deli sandwich craving to 80%. It is just missing the authenticity. Even though they make one tastey marble rye I miss the old faithful kaiser roll and footlong italian bread which is signiture in NY.
PRICES- fair 7-10$
CHIPS-No selection and they use the small bags with only 8chips ??!!
PORTION-I was left a bit hungry for my buck
SIDES-Not many to choose and again tiny. I found the salads/slaw
bland.
SERVICE-very friendly, yet they botched one of my two sandwiches.

Honestly, Heidi's is pretty awesome. If you're ready through the reviews, you have probably heard that they make their own bread. All sorts of varieties which fills the air with fabulous scents. 

It really has a NY feel to it. The furniture and they layout.. you really feel like you're in the City until you look at the window and see actual trees.

The food:

I have been twice and have ordered the fabulous, well-priced lunch special ($5). I think both times I've gotten the Cajun Turkey with Avocado on wheat. The sandwich is awesome, but super spicy. Great flavor though. I'd recommend it. The macaroni salad is really good as well, but you only get about three bites. If you're hungry, opt for chips.

There's a lady there who consistently starts adding cheese or will scoop a big helping of avocado on your sandwich and then say ""Oh, that's going to be $1.50 extra, is that ok?""

When I went to pay, I told him I had Apple Pay, and he proceeded to give me my total. I asked him where I use Apple Pay at and he stared at me, with an annoying stare, and said ""credit card"" and shrugged his shoulders. I told him this Yelp page said it accepted Apple Pay. He just told me it was a corporate page, not his. Based off his behavior alone, I would question going back. Word of mouth goes a long way- that's unfortunate.

For that meager sum, you get 1/2 a sandwich, drink, cookie, and a choice of chips or side salad.

  The sandwich is generous, and on the plus side they slice the bread right from the loaf as you order. I chose rye because I like it, but for the future,  clearly the correct strategy would be to eyeball which loaf is about half gone so you will get the maximum slice out of the middle. Yes, I am a pig. She got the Hell's Kitchen, which involved egg salad, Swiss cheese, bacon, and hot sauce.  Surprisingly good combo of richness, smokiness, and a little heat. Thumbs up. I tried the chicken salad, and it was just how I like it. Chunks of chicken, a little sweetness, and no hard things to ruin the whole experience. 

For my side, I got the chips since they came in a bag and were a normal serving. Side salads were dished out in those tiny little plastic cups one associates with ketchup or tartar sauce, not cole slaw. WTF? Good thing I observed this in time to order accordingly. I suggest you do the same.

My Cajun Turkey & Avocado Sandwich was a disappointment. The bread to meat ratio was not proportionate. The hoagie roll was much too thick and, honestly, a little dry. The Cajun sauce came through prominently and had a nice kick. I had a difficult time locating the meat because it was overshadowed by mouthfuls of bread. The scant amount of meat I was able to encounter tasted as if it came out of a package. My lunch companion's sandwich was better; his sourdough bread was more fresh than my hoagie roll. Nevertheless, his option was also fairly average. I was really looking forward to a sandwich reminiscent of what I usually experience in NYC: large stacks of  meat on thin, soft, doughy bread.  

The pickle included was not fresh or crunchy; rather, it was limp and sad. NY deli pickles always have a classic crunch.

What also turned me off was the unfriendliness of the staff, specifically by the two older gentlemen that assisted us. They seemed annoyed that we had to ask what types of breads and sides they offered.

Paid nearly $10 for a crappy italian sub that didn't even have cheese on it (I ordered it to go so I didn't realize this until I left). I ate the sandwich anyways and the meat on it was gross. It was worse than the ham bolognese mixture they serve at Subway.


Unfortunately I have to report that I think the lady making my sandwich left the cheese out on purpose...
I say this because while I ordered I asked if it comes with chips and a drink (For $10 IT SHOULD). She told me it only comes with chips. I then asked if I could substitute a drink for the chips and she replied with an irritated answer saying no we can't do that. I briefly tried reasoning with her that a drink would be cheaper to give than a bag of chips.. but still, no was the answer. I could tell she didn't like me even though I really wasn't being rude.. I asked nicely.

4917144,2012-06-23,0,6uV3KMOo8YQofuNUs4D9pA,"I drive by this place all the time but due to its generic exterior, I have not considered trying it until a friend recommended it to me. Overall, the service was lacking, what I purchased was overpriced, but the food was good enough to make up for the two other areas and I will definitely return. 

The flow of how and where they expect you to order is just confusing. You have to walk through a row of tables or walk against the flow of customers ordering to get to the spot where they want you to order. Once you get there, there is an awkward pillar right in front of the main menu. I found myself hovering to each side of the pillar looking at different parts of the menu. On top of all that, the sandwich makers stare you down until you start to order. I felt pressured to decide what I wanted immediately. I had very little time to ponder over my decision. Once you order, the flow of what to do next is uncertain for new customers. I walked across the counter to the register only to find out that the sandwich maker would hand me my sandwich back where I originally ordered. Then, I committed the sin of asking for baked chips and I was forced to walk across the store to pick those up. Oh and FYI they charge 69 cents extra for any chips that aren't original Lays. Once I got to the register the cashier did not offer me a small size drink. She showed me the medium and said, ""this size is okay right?"" I found that to be a little sketchy. Finally she was ready to ring up my order when another employee came up and started talking to the cashier about her schedule. The cashier didn't even say anything to me, stopped helping me, and talked to the other employee for about a minute. Eventually my order was rung up and I was able to sit down and eat.

Before I review the food itself, I want to briefly talk about the value of the food. I paid for both my girlfriend's and my meals. We each got a full sized sandwich, medium drink, and a side. The order totaled around $18. I feel that Heidi's is asking a little too much money for what you get. To be fair, they do offer a $5 special that includes a half sandwich, side, small drink, and a cookie. I wish there were other ways to upgrade to a meal without downgrading my drink, sandwich and being required to have a cookie. So basically if you want to buy into the only real good value in the store, you have to compromise in what you are getting. 

Flow, service, and value aside, the food was amazing. I ordered the Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich on (thick cut) wheat bread. The sandwich included mozzarella, tomato, balsamic vinegar, lettuce, onion, and a mouth watering pesto sauce. The sandwich reminded me of how some people act with crack, I just couldn't get enough. Even after I left the store, I kept wanting to go back and get another one. My girlfriend got the Chicken Salad Sandwich on wheat bread.  Her's was equally delicious. I can't wait to go back and try something new.

I gave Heidi's 4 stars despite the negatives I described in this review. I was really judging them during the ordering process, but once I sat down and bit in to my sandwich I was hooked. I believe if a restaurant has some flaws, the food can sometimes keep you coming back. That is definitely the case with Heidi's.",tnUn628aEL9q3y4acX6U7g,1,0,4,KmOfsdXAGYsLyqT-fgkcmg

       - Quality - One thing I love about Heidi's is their quality. They bake their bread right there and have a wide selection. Their meats are fresh and delicious.
       - Portion - The other thing about Heidi's sandwiches is that they're big. Thick slices of bread, Large helpings of meat.
       - Price - Most sandwiches are around $8. All sandwiches come with a small side. There's also a deal during lunch for half a sandwich, chips, and a drink for $5.
**Favorites**
       - Transplanted New Yorker - Sinfully fatty deli meats with avocado and their signature secret cajun sauce. Every bite is deliciously salty and spicy.
       - Bronx Bomber - Pastrami and egg salad. I usually add their cajun sauce to this to seal the deal. If you like pastrami and egg salad, you have to get this. Be warned however, this is a pretty large sandwich and you are in danger of a food coma after wards.
**Recommendations**
       - I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quality sandwich.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,4,2,4,DP62U34aPa2rW2zcF3h10w

I was looking everywhere to see if they had a lunch special, if I read Paolo D.'s review I would have known about the half sandwich, side, pickle, cookie and drink deal for $5. The moral of the story is that literacy is important and the corn beef is tasty.

I got the fore mentioned meat on pumpernickel with coleslaw, pepperjack, mustard, tomatoes, onions,and mustard.  Heated and toasted is the way to go. The corn beef is moist without an ounce of fat connected to it. Surprised, but delighted. The bread are baked fresh and they definitely taste like it. All sandwiches comes with a side of coleslaw, potato, or macaroni salad and a pickle spear. For $8.09, my sandwich was delicious and filling.

I have never had a complaint about the food, every time the it tastes great. 

The price is higher than Subway or Port-o-subs, but I can get my egg salad for less than $7 and I think it's great! 

The do enjoy eating there because its quiet and relaxing. This place I visit at least once a week!",ip6IbczHeYOT9QVLaJVXkg,1,1,4,6IM6O5tn8Bkqou-9c1Z7hA

I'm almost certain they are here to
Cater to the senior community they are afraid of salt. The sandwich I had tasted nothing like the description. I was trying to be nice but I might want to add my sandwhich was also soggy when it arrived. They did nothing to fix it and offered to correct it the next time why would I order again if they mess up so bad the first time",g7_y6T3DznyBWNXoWCuT7A,0,0,1,o3gEL9ogYRTSq0T-ulYbZw

It's basically an egg salad sandwich and a BLT combined with a hint of cajun mayo  spread. SO GOOD!  if i could make the drive at lunch break I  would go every day. I wish they  had more locations, but when I go it's never that  busy , so maybe they  dont see the need :/",6LO3hkrSt1-mAU1oR8sbhA,0,0,4,yeI814E_4GF_tOjnkTmDTA

I've been here many times on my lunch break and the line is always long after noon, for obvious reasons. Delicious sandwiches, fresh ingredients and fresh cooked bread. All sandwiches come with your choice of  FRESH daily in house cooked bread which includes the following: Ciabatta, Butter-Top White, Light-Rye, Pumpernickel, Marble-Rye, Sour Dough, Whole Wheat, French Hoagie, Italian Hoagie.

They have an awesome lunch special, for $5, you get half a sandwich, a small side with your choice of Coleslaw or Potato Salad, a cookie and a drink. I usually order the Heidi's club on Whole wheat with Turkey & Bacon with Avacado, Sprouts, Lettuce, Mayo & Onions....Always fresh ingredients.  

**Favorite Sandwiches: Egg Salad & Heidi's Club on Whole Wheat with Turkey & Bacon.

**Sides: Coleslaw (And I'm not a fan of coleslaw, but their coleslaw is pretty damn good!). Potato Salad (LOVE IT) 

**Oh yea, Heidi's has great vegetarian options as well, all of their Vegetarian choices have a Green Star in front of them",-bg2NzPGRxVbyftAzaTLiQ,3,3,4,UAqMmISeVcQ3jmY9eAv_Hg

The man taking my order and making my sandwich was rude - yelling at me from across the restaurant - After I left, I called to speak with the manager to let them know about my experience today.  They would not let speak with one and would not provide a name. He said he would not give that out to me over the phone.  I don't expect a lot when I am getting lunch to go - just a pleasant interaction and a good meal.  Too bad I will not be back.",xQiPNuBDoWuhtdROmUp6MQ,0,0,1,0VimVROCcMu-j2xqSR7Edw

They have great tasting vegan wheat bread, smells great when right out of the oven.  Soft and yummy.  You should give it a try.",gONO1sBn6nrrPyWIk9QSJw,0,0,5,KXSBxJJkkWMbqVIktwF48Q

In their defense, they said they don't make their own coleslaw (which is probably why its not that good in the first place), so the metal shaving wasn't their fault necessarily...

Anyways, awesome sandwiches, cool guys that work there, and that $5 lunch special with the delicious home made chocolate chip cookie will keep me coming back for more. Just no more coleslaw...",BioAFnx1elzi8DLq_Zra3w,1,2,4,WRI2KzGfXyJwR1pfunbN6Q
