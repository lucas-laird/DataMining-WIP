We did opt for the souvineer cup knowing we would want to come back for drinks after the show. Our first experience was pleasant enough and left us happy. 

When we came back that evening though, the bartender was spending so much time with a patron across the bar and taking selfies for her, that he flat out ignored others at the bar. When we finally got his attention, he tried to overcharge us for our drinks. We did have to ask him about it, and this is where it draws the line between funny crude joking to flat out being a true dick. The bartender didn't know the difference at that point and was literally being a jerk. We did call him on his attitude knowing we could be misinterpreting it, but he had a totally jerk ass response and validated that he was being rude. We didn't deserve this. We paid, but left without tipping. He went back to flirting.

Ryan, thinks the food made him sick. He threw up a couple hours later. I (Kalila) am convinced that it wasn't the food that made him sick, because we ate the same exact thing, but I did not get sick. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and the Brisket Sandwich. The buffalo chicken was ok and the Brisket sandwich was disappointing.

Ryan ordered a small Blue Moon. It was in a small plastic cup and it turned out to be $7! It was definitely too small to be $7.

If you get the waiter who is named Oscar, just leave before it starts.

We had a party of 4 and the bench table had another party of 4.  It was mildly funny at first with the rude attitude, but things got uncomfortable when -
One of the ladies had her phone out when Oscar was at the table.  He grabbed her phone, stood on the bench seat, took a photo of himself holding his genitals, then told the girl she had a ""disgusting phone"" while rubbing her phone against his genitals - then literally licked her phone.

Things then got more uncomfortable when he wanted a picture with one of the other girls, telling her to grab his moustache as he pretended to grab her breasts (while commenting negatively about their size).

He made not just rude but down right offending remarks to our table (which I choose to omit).  There's a ""rude and fun"" atmosphere and this was just down right offensive and uncomfortable.

The beers my wife and I ordered were brought out and not what we ordered - and when I commented on it he basically told me to shut up.

The food tasted pretty good for what it was.

The last straw was the hat incident, which resulted in my wife walking out immediately upset.  I wanted to ensure the bill was paid, but the waiter couldn't be found  (after walking around for several minutes I told a waitress he needed to come back).

I told Oscar he went way too far and I wanted the bill.  He then asked me what it was that I had ordered.  I had enough of it, and I went off on him telling him to figure it out since he had written it down - and telling him to get the beers he gave us correct on the check.

Which then made things worse as someone at a nearby table got angry at me for waking up their infant in a stroller  (yup, a family of 5 with 3 young children were there) and literally stood up as if he wanted to fight.

My wife and I have a good sense of humor and have no problems with rude and crude, but it went way too far.

The manager spoke to me after the incident and was actually concerned.  She was unhappy to hear about what had happened and she did what she could to set it right.  I am only, hesitantly, giving it a 2nd star because of her.",MzyNt92GZ9CCBMn-b9fMdA,0,1,2,x7QJk-5TifSpCBY5poBDtw

We told the waiter 3 times and still got nothing so we ultimately just canceled the orders. No point in paying for food when everyone else is already finished eating. What got me was that he never apologized, just simply said I took the two orders off the bill. Some of the worst service I have ever experienced. I understand the waiters are supposed to be crude, but when the service is that bad the show is off! Worst part was that gratuity was included so we were stuck giving the guy a $30 tip, when he deserved nothing. 

The food was not very good. Burgers tasted like a premade patty from a grocery store. Chicken strips were rough and over cooked. The daiquiris looked pretty good, but are very pricy. Thank god beer can't be screwed up or I'm sure it would have been at this place.

The group of girls that I was with were given 2 for 1 drink vouchers for Dick's so we thought we would kick off our Vegas vacation by drinking. (of course) 

We sat at the bar and the bartender start insulting you (you're old/dumb/stuck-up etc).
I get it, that's their schtick after awhile it just becomes irritating if you're sober. The bartender just glared at us when we tried to use the vouchers given to us and straight up wouldn't tell me which beers that I could use it with. It was uncomfortable and weird. We should have just left then.

I finally ordered a Newcastle, which was $11(which I guess was one of the acceptable beers on the mystery list) and was told that we couldn't order food without paying for our drinks first. Um ok. Decided not to eat there.

It was dinner time and most of the other patrons there were completely smashed already. It's very loud, people dancing between tables, a drunk lady fell on the floor. There seemed to be a lot of kids running around too.

Our bartender decided to demonstrate ""the shocker"" to the group next to us by dipping his fingers in ketchup and his pinkie in chocolate sauce. We downed our beers and got out. Such a classy place.",KcH2qhgUgJDnXPFIfXdofw,0,1,1,wTWrDhgISKktoFYmGSfUWA

""The blonde is fake, but the slutty is real""
""Cougar looking for fresh meat""
""I swallow""

There were 3 people in our party and they put us at a shared table with 3 others.  It worked out well for us because the other party was so wild that we didn't have to take the brunt of any of the jokes; we just sat back and watched the others take all the abuse.

The food was decent, but expensive.  Though, I guess that tends to be the theme at Vegas restaurants unless you go really high-end.  The drinks were smaller than their prices would suggest.

Overall, it was a pretty fun night, but it's the kind of place that I can say, ""been there, done that"" and I don't really feel the need to go back.",460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,0,0,3,S96m9VOhjwhnOSxLhMtGxg

We were expecting it. We asked for water, we eventually got pitchers but no cups. We asked for cups and they were these little plastic hotel cups that were thrown at us. We asked for napkins and they were also thrown all over the around us.

The waitress did get the job done and took our orders. She made us hats - insulting ones of course. All that was kind of expected. 

We had 2 orders of nachos and I do have to say they were pretty good. But then again I was starving! The beers were cold and it was actually ok.

As a matter of fact, it was very full. We were seated quickly because of the amount of seating available. Believe me when I tell you, there is a lot of seating. The decor is very flashy. Not in a gaudy way, but in a fun have a good time way. There was a man making the most incredible balloon creations I have ever seen. And he made them each so quickly. They were not all animals so I cannot say he was making balloon animals. They were balloon creations. He made a seahorse and a little puppy, but he also made a little mermaid. I was and still am impressed. Dick's is a theme restaurant. The theme is service with an attitude. Our waiter seemed like he was trying to do his part of being rude. But it did not seem rude so much. He did make sure we were taken care of the entire time we were there.

I ordered a Big A__ Burger with cheese and bacon. The burger was a half pounder, was cooked just right and had a lot of flavor. The bacon was the same. Juicy, not to crisp, and flavorful. The bun was very light and flaky making it a perfect burger. I have to be honest and say that the fries were not the best I have ever had. But, the fries were crisped just right and had a very good flavor to them as well. For not the best they were pretty darned good. My wife had the Steak Sammich.

I mean how long can it take to deliver a spite? I guess in this case of a totally inept wait staff, who couldn't get a job at Denny's, the better part of two hours. The terms, ""you're fired"", ""what kind of idiot am I to choose such a place"", and ""don't quit your day job"" come to mind. You're better off going to McDonalds.

Had my fiancé not been in charge of the bill, I would have walked out without paying a cent. Which was frankly MORE than this inept waitress deserved. Positive: The hats were funny.

The waiters grunt at you, point in answer to questions, wander off, and go out of their way not to be rude.  We ordered nachos, which were fine, although they skimped on the toppings so half the chips went uneaten.

What I really didn't like about Dick's was the 'entertainment.'  After making stupid paper hats for some of the customers, the waiters took multiple packs of napkins and tossed them all over the restaurant, the food and into the drinks.  I know the waiter thought my pissed off look was due to him balling up a napkin and hitting me in the eye with it, but he was wrong.  I got that it was all a part of the 'ambiance' of Dicks.  

What pissed me off was to see the wanton waste of trees that must happen countless times a day in this place for the sake of pretending to be jerks.  I even recycle my toilet paper rolls at home.  Just thinking about all my little daily efforts to do what's right by the environment and how in the course of a month Dick's crass wastefulness probably offsets the efforts I make all year really pissed me off.

For starters, I didn't love the anti-smoking policy. There were ashtrays everywhere just like there are everywhere else in Vegas. Apparently those are just decorations, though, and you have to stand outside the door to smoke a cigarette. I don't mind traveling to smoke, but it's beyond dickish to taunt smokers with ashtrays that can't be used.

I also wasn't thrilled with the overall fun level at the Vegas Dick's. I went there on a Friday night and there was hardly anyone there. Our waiter didn't insult us, make fools of us, or even acknowledge us. That would normally be a good thing, but that's part of the fun you usually get to have at Dick's. 

Even though we were robbed of our consumer right to be mistreated, the Vegas Dick's gets brownie points for their awesome drinks. I had a 100 ounce slush chock full of grain alcohol in the coolest container ever.

Dick's Last Resort is a restraunt inside the Excalibur Hotel & Casino that prides itself in it's sense of humor. At Dick's the waitstaff are rude, crude, inappropriate, and HIGHLY unprofessional....... on purpose. And they expect you to do the same. Dick's is a place where social constraints and political correctness are left at the door with your hat and coat.

Our waitress walked up to us, threw our utensils and napkins on the table, tossed us some menus and said ""hurry up and decide what you want!"" I fell in love with this place immediately. The best part was when you have a real question about something (like a menu option) she would switch into real waitress-mode and answer your question.... then mercilessly make fun of you for asking such a dumb question. hahaha.

Our waitress was so great at her job, she actually scared away an older Asian family who sat next to us. I don't think they knew the point of Dick's and didn't appreciate the sarcasm. Our waitress did the same routine with the utensils and menus, but when she returned to take their order, they hadn't decided yet. She asked ""do you all speak English?"" to which a meek ""yes"" must have been uttered, and she followed it up with ""well then liven up a little bit, jeez."" and she walked away. The eldest lady at the table was already halfway out the restraunt by that point! My wife and I were in tears laughing so hard!

The food was amazing too! My wife had the pulled pork plate and I had the BBQ beef brisket with ribs. Perfection on a plate was what was served to me. I loved it all!

The whole point is that everyone here is a dick... at Dick's Last Resort. 

This place is a blast if you realize its all in good fun. My friend picked a fight with the waiter before she knew he was a waiter. As the night went on he gave us all personalized paper hats with obscene comments... my group's hats read as follows: 
""Blah blah blah, just put it in my butt."" (mine, because I didn't say much)
""I haven't seen my penis since fifth grade."" (for my larger bf)
""Ask me about my DSL's"" (my smart ass friend)
""Puberty sucks"" (for my 22 year old asian friend who looks 14)
""I masturbate to Justin Timberlake videos"" (my metrosexual looking friend)
and the ladies next to me had one that was great too... 
""Dr. Phil makes me moist"" and ""Ask for my number, I'm easy.""
You have to wear the hat the whole time or they give you hell. 

The bartender put on a show behind the bar that was both hilarious, poetic, and obscene, including water and opera singing. 

The group behind us had a birthday, and a fat guy with an afro gave the birthday girl a lap dance. He was so over the top. He even had a thong sticking out of his shorts (whale tail on a guy is funny!)

The food was good. There were big portions and it was fairly cheap for food on the strip (about $15 a person plus drinks). They served buckets of beer which I thought was cool.

Las Vegas is full of upscale yuppie restaurants and what not, but Dick's is an awesome divey place. Where Nobu attracts the yuppies up the street, Dick's attracts the normal folk. Inside and outside is very spacious and comfortable. The wait staff is hilarious and entertaining. Above the bar, there are numerous bras hanging up..as my Dad pointed out.. looks like most of them are from Vicky's. Inside the restaurant, you'll find piles of napkins strewn about on the floor or thrown at a Penthouse Playmate sitting nearby. Best part, beers in a bucket! 

If you stumble in here, have a sense of humor. If you don't, you probably belong at Nobu. 

We tried the cheese sticks and they were just okay..they have a healthy menu of food offerings, but it's really for the tasty beverage that brings us to Dick's. 

They have bands who show up randomly each night, but they don't seem to play for very long. 

If you wear a tie, this place isn't for you. They used to cut people's ties when they walked in, but now they may just make fun of you or throw napkins.

list of weirdest restaurants or something like that once. A place
where you get insulted by the staff. What's not to like? There 
used to be a place we used to go called Ed Debevic's that had
really smartass waiters and waitresses that would give you tons
of crap about everything. Then there's Pinnacle Peak Patio where
they grab your tie, cut it off, and hang it on the ceiling. But
that was all back in Arizona. Here in Las Vegas, a friend and I
came by to Excalibur to get a taste of Dick's. No. Not THAT kind 
of dick - you dick! No fella eating shit. I mean a taste of the 
kind of attitude and insults that Dick's is known for. We had just
checked out the Lynyrd Skynyrd bar and they were doing some really
crappy carry-okie. In my drunken state I kept shouting FREEBIRD!
But nobody took me up on it. I then tried to order some blackened
Freebird but they said it wasn't on the menu. About the time some
big bouncer oaf started heading my way we got out of there and headed
for Dick's. If you wanna be a dick, head towards a place where you 
can get away with it. So some chump standing outside the place gave
us 2-for-1 drink cards and we took advantage of them immediately.
There was some band playing a lot of 80's classic rock and hair metal
and it was pretty much a good time. When we first walked in, though, 
I saw all these girls with white hats - looked like a klan meeting
where they forgot to cover their faces. Then I noticed some really
goofy stuff written on the hats. Didn't make sense but I already 
was 3 or 4 mixed drinks to Sunday and not a whole lot was making
sense by that time. The bartender didn't insult us though. I was a
bit disappointed. Maybe that was above her pay grade. Or maybe she
just had the sense of humor of a TV test pattern. I'll never know.
Oh yeah. They sell all sorts of T-shirts that very tastefully and
artfully use the name of the place - the type a short bus ridin' 3rd
grader would take at least a whole minute to come up with.",0d7gFJUi4cV3I7j1dHn9fQ,0,1,3,ptVHrCqLeYvDt24R5PcqVQ

As we walked in, we noticed the sign that said they would be rude to us.  We also got a warning from the hostess as she walked us to our table.  Our waitress was great.  We were both a little stunned when she threw a piece of butcher paper on the table and told us to clear everything off so that we could put it down as a table cloth.  We weren't fast enough and were too busy laughing so she came over and insulted us several times before we got the table covering on.  

She then tried to take our drink orders.  My niece, who is only 19, tried to order a virgini daiquiri but the waitress told her they don't make virgin drinks.  She gave me a hard time for drinking soda instead of alcohol, too.  When she came back with our drinks, she had a virgin daiquiri for my niece.  She slapped it down on the table with a ""here you little four year old.  Here is your baby drink"".  Ha ha!  She was great!

There was a DJ who played music.  Every once in a while he would make us clap, sing, etc.  He was placed up high and could see the whole bar.  When he spotted someone who wasn't participating he would call them out.  He yelled at one girl saying ""Hey girl with too much makeup on.  How do you put that much makeup on to go out and then sit there not clapping?""  Too funny.

The best part was when he made fun of the large group of people who had brought their young children out to the place.  He had us boo them for bringing their kids.  The kids, meanwhile, all had at least 6 helium balloons tied into their hair making it stand on end.  The boys had hats that said ""I have an itchy bum and a stinky finger"" or ""I thought it was a fart"".

My niece got a hat that said ""My mom still thinks I'm a virgin"".  

I'll agree the food wasn't the best.  It's typical fried food.  We had the appetizer sampler that had chicken fingers, wings, mozz sticks, and fried pickles.  It was a lot of food and we didn't finish it.  It was about $21 for the sampler.",Xmiz3QSVq8iaI6R9FAQpsw,0,0,4,bmkqJxx4eyF667GRw_SpYQ

We walked by this restaurant many times before deciding to go, it looked like a load of fun, the food was okay, not the greatest. 

The biggest problem I had with this restaurant was the server, yes I know that you're supposed to get sarcastic service here and he was mouthy, which was great. But aside from being pretty much ignored most the time, even though he pretty much just wandered around most the time. 

Near the end of our meal these two girls came in he sat there at the bar talking to them, he completely ignored us after that and he also had another large table of probably seven people, they had to bug him for their bill. 

The second problem I had with this was the drinks, I bought the large margarita in the souvenir glass and yes I did order the extra shot, it came out so strong I couldn't drink it. My husband did but I did bring it up to the server that it was incredibly strong and bitter, not complaining mind you just to let them know and all he said was well he ordered the extra shot didn't you?

So all in all, this was not a very good meal save yourself some money and go else where. we wish we would have",xjzkao3hw0CWdixw4phL6A,3,0,2,SMjQOxp0tZ9DNXD9sysn6w
1763788,2016-07-07,1,g8oxQ1Ji9mr9PMjhEfaWSg,"Went to Dick's Last Resort over 4th of July weekend. Surprisingly it wasn't too busy. The concept of the restaurant is for the employees to be obnoxious, rude, and cruel. The do a great job bringing the concept to life but in reality I feel like they take it too far. 

If it is your first time they'll explain to you the run down of the restaurant. After that, the gloves are off. When taking our initial order we didn't even get a chance to order our appetizers. When our waitress walked by, i asked to order an appetizer and she didn't even acknowledge me. I also wanted to clarify if free appetizer on yelp would work if i check in. Literally 5 minutes before our food came out a server brought out our food. 

The food overall is ok, nothing special honestly. Typical bar food, decent bbq, french fries weren't any good. They charge you for ""tap"" water. But for the price we paid, the food is definitely not worth it. When we got the bill, our waitress said the redeem a free appetizer on yelp doesn't apply to the appetizer we ordered. WHICH WE WOULDNT HAVE ORDERED IN THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU ACKNOWLEDGED US AND TOLD US IN THE FIRST PLACE. 

Overall I give it 2 out 5 stars. Would I go back, not unless someone I knew really wanted to go. I'd rather go eat at a food court or buffet. Save your money and spend it else where.",PNThNjwwtpPE3ggrCc1kTw,2,1,2,U7NFV1pQSl3PtvEHlfHWBA

The bf had fond memories of this place, and since we were tired and didn't want to walk far from the MGM we ventured over to Dick's. The live band playing on stage was actually pretty good, but the volume was just way too loud for me. The place was pretty packed, so we took a seat at the bar. The bartenders promptly served us and you can tell they enjoy ther jobs, very enthusiastic. So in terms of service effort, they do a good job. The bf got a margarita on the rocks, I opted for a cranberry and vodka. If you know me, you know I love me some Vodka, but I seriously couldn't even drink it, the vodka tasted nasty. But I guess I shouldn't expect top shelf Vodka at this place. We ordered the sampler platter to share. It was edible, but I suspect there were some empty frozen, microwaveable appetizer boxes in the kitchen.

This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  As previous reviews have stated, this restaurant's gimmick is that all the workers act like dicks, hence the name.  However, there is a fine line between sarcasm, which I can deal with, and rudeness/disrespect.  I love sarcasm.  However, unless you know me really well, I can't deal with racial/ethnic humor.

In addition to the rudeness of the workers there, the prices are completely outrageous!  I had a pitcher of beer and was charged $19.  My pasta dish cost $15.  Are you serious?!?  I should've heeded our food server's advice and gone to McDonald's to order off their value menu.

Bottom line...DO NOT eat at this Dick's location unless you like to be overcharged for food/beer and like being treated with disrespect.  Consider yourself warned.",QEHoYKMynY7LaAnzsVXR-w,2,0,1,JAWwVKQ2-ib3ad1Rb4NJxw

My friend and I sat down at the first bar, a bartender flew by, and we asked if this bar was open... She said she didn't know... So we sauntered over to the other main bar. One bartender was flirting with two girls. No big deal... but we are waiting... waiting... another bartender comes by... maybe we would get help. She then starts also flirting with the two girls... Uhhh... hello? Its been 15 - 20 minutes no help. One bartender out of five is actually working... totally ignored... I finally went up to them. Hey... if you all could stop flirting for just one moment and give us a drink. that would be awesome... No apologies, nothing, we just ended up flipping each other off.... and I ended up walking out... we would of dropped a bunch of money on that place, that hotel, etc... but never again will I set foot in the hotel or the bar.....

So here is it the ratings:
Food 3.5 stars -good, better than McDonalds, about like Sizzler. 

Drinks 3 stars -  a little pricey and sometimes a little weak. 

Cleanliness of bathroom 4 stars -  I didn't see anything to grip about but I didn't do a full inspection.  Paper towels and soap dispensers were full and the bathroom was generally clean and did not stink. 

Cleanliness of eating area 4 stars - tables, menus, utensils, salt & pepper shakers, steak sauce bottles and, ect.... Were clean.  

Speed of service 3.5 stars -  

The whole experience left our group of 6 pleased and we all had a great time. The bill for the 6 of us $219 and here is what we ate, well at least what I recall.  

Ribeye steak and shrimp (yummy by the way)
Appetizer sampler platter (feeds 4-6 people) 
Fire racker salmon 
Steak n Shrimp
Chicken tenders meal
Chicken breast sandwich 
Six 14 ounce beers
One 24 ounce bud light
Order of fried cheese sticks
2 or 3 Fireball & Cokes
1 blow job for my wife (it's a drink)  get your mind out of the gutter. 

A decent amount of food combined with a fun loving bunch of curmudgeonly staff members that know how to take a joke and can dish it right back.   This all was ONLY  an average of $36 a person.

So this review is not about the food, but about after hours at Dick's.  It's 1am and our last night in Vegas, we walked back to our hotel after many, many drinks. We're walking by they had the restaurant lights down and the multi-colored lights on with music playing!

We decided to walk in and see what was going on. A nightclub. We walked into a night club. I hadn't been to a Vegas nightclub in a years, and I was iffy about staying, but we did. I think I was mostly sold on the drinks. They were big and less expensive than the casino bars. 

The dance floor was small and cramped, they had left a table or two out, so we had a place to sit next to the dance floor, but having people bump into your chair wasn't fun. The sound system wasn't great and the DJ needed some work on his music selection and song transfer. 

We stayed long enough to finish our drinks and went to the blackjack table instead.

- waiter flipping us off
- napkins being thrown around
- insults come in verbal and hat form
- just plain rudeness all around
- balloon animals with male genitalia, big ones too hahaha

all that makes this one of the most fun places i've eaten at !! so me and my friends stopped by here because we heard about how terrible it was . just looking in from outside you can tell its a good place for a group to have some fun . the experience could actually be called one of a kind cause they make rude service fun . being able to be a jerk back is a plus too ! the worst thing that can happen from insulting your waiter is you get a paper hat with something insulting (but hilarious) on it . the band played some good covers of old school songs . the pulled pork i ordered was done right with a bomb diggity bbq sauce on it . the waiter was even cool enough to deliver a drink for us to some ladies at another table .

there were a few things i didnt like . the food is on the pricey side for how simple most of the item are . empty ketchup bottle and had to check a lot of tables for one . and we also didnt get our slaw for some reason . i think he said they were out, but even then we should have at least gotten some more fries .

overall 4/5 . come in a group for sure . girls get picked on like crazy and some of the waiters will take off their shirts and give them a dance on the table . hit this spot up if youre visiting vegas . if you dont have a sense of humor dont come here ! and also if you dont have a sense of humor find one or get a temporary one with some drinks !",z4grvGlevnjexsA062Ruyw,0,0,4,cGnCj1otdqfhjHbBZrj2Fw

They have some delicious burgers here, but if you're here to get anything more sophisticated than that you best look elsewhere.

This is not the place to go if you're not into drinking, or if you're easily offended, or if you have CHILDREN with you.  For goodness sakes, I'll never understand why people bring their children in this place.  Makes absolutely no sense!

The food is pretty expensive for what you get, but that's to be expected.  $17.99 for 4 chicken fingers and fries.  Standard bar fare, with some BBQ options.  Drinks are expensive, of course.  But, there are lots of ""2 for 1"" coupons all over the place that help make up the difference.

The weekend is definitely the best time to go, as the crowd is usually pretty fun and the music being played is decent.  It's always a treat to see TACO, and how he interacts with ""special"" guests is priceless (brides-to-be, grooms-to-be, birthday girls and boys, etc).  They usually throw in a couple dance or singing parties, too, so that makes it fun.  And, honestly, the more sarcastic/rude you are with your server, the better the experience.  It's fun to just be silly and let loose sometimes.

We know the drill expecting ""rude, sarcastic, and dirty banter"" which we got by the hostess but not really by the waiter. They weren't that busy and it just seemed like the waiters weren't on it. It took almost an hour for us to find out our order had been lost by the kitchen and we would have to reorder our food again.

We were a table 8 so I was pretty impressed that she did have our food out in like 15 minutes. She was very nice and I think felt really bad that we were now gonna be late to our bungy jump at the stratosphere. So she took care of the whole bill, which was very much appreciated!!!  A few things we did notice that have changed since we were here last:

First the menu, they have a ""dinner"" menu which was pretty small with very few options and we were told we couldn't order anything that wasn't on ""dinner menu"" like a chicken sandwich. They only had a burger. The chicken sandwich I guess is on the ""lunch menu""
Second is the paper hats. No one in our party got one even though it was my brothers bday. There were also very few ppl wearing them in the restaurant that night. Almost like they dont bother with them anymore.
Third the prices seems to have gone way up. The drinks were super expensive and the food was ridiculous. Almost $20 for a burger. And it wasn't anything special. 
All that being said the balloon guy was absolutely the highlight of our experience. I think he was trying to make up for the mistakes in the kitchen. He was vulgar, sarcastic, and damn talented!

It was a football Sunday and the sports book was super crowded so we stopped in here to get some food and drinks while watching ten football games at once.

Our server was pretty cool.  He brought paper for the tablecloth and threw napkins in our direction.  Yep they do have attitude here and any customer who can throw had better be ready to get it back.  They also do those paper hats with funny sayings on there.  They no longer have menus but a menu posted on the wall.  Those who are too far have to walk over to the wall to read it...any other place this sort of thing wouldn't do...but here at Dick's...hilarious!

One good redeeming thing about the food is their onion rings.  They were perfectly cooked with the right amount of crispiness.  Whoever did that batch, I bow to your skill.  The brisket sandwich I got was OK and the chicken tenders and fries that my friend got was not so hot.  Did I mention that most of this food was $12 and up?  $14 for chicken strips and fries?  Ridiculous!  AND, the beer selection has magically shrank since I last came here.  They used to have over 15 types of beer on tap here now all they got are the sad macrobrews that the gamblers get served outside plus Blue Moon(ran out that day) and Guinness.  I got a Guinness from them and it set me back $14!  Beer pricing also not shown when I ordered.

I don't think I can describe how disappointed I am with all this Dick's has gone downhill since I was last here.

It's funny, some of our servers jokes bordered on sexual harassment as one of the girls in our party didn't seem to like what he was saying. Again, some people may like it and think it's A-OK, but I wasn't feeling it.

The waitress we had was really nice, but she acts like an asshole because that's her job description. They write these things on a big piece of paper and make you wear it as a hat, but they say dirty things in the paper. 

I have it a four star because I didn't like the food options. The drink we shared was really good and definitely worth getting as you get to keep the cup.

I get that the server is trying to be a ""dick"" but service shouldn't be lacking because of it. With that said, our server at this location, Christine, found the perfect balance! She was a major dick but still tended to our needs like one would expect in a restaurant. 

The menu was very overwhelming to me... Three separate sheets! But she went over it quickly and got us familiar with the items and made a few recommendations. (Here's a tip: don't get the chicken strips! Ha!) 

We were seated instantly on a busy Thursday evening, quickly greeted, drinks seemed to come to our table as soon as we ordered them, and the food quickly followed. One person in my party was a huge dick, while one was super shy. Christine went full force on our party's ""dick"" and kept it a bit calmer for our shy friend. She really wanted to make sure we all had a good time. 

I ordered a burger but I realize I should have followed Christine's advice and gotten something more BBQ themed because my friend's pulled pork was amazing.

Being the sarcastic and funny bunch we are we all agreed and went here around 10:30 Saturday night. At first our waitress was very sarcastic and it was pretty funny. A bit awkward cause we didn't know how to react but still funny.

With the waitress, the only thing that I was offended by from all her sarcasm was when she created my hat. She put ""I've had more Mexicans inside of me than a Home Depot parking lot"" Being that I am Hispanic and a female, I felt that was very rude and I was offended. I took that hat off right away. I didn't that was funny at all. I have a really good sense of humor, but that hat made me feel uncomfortable. 

Food: We got our food which I though was overly priced. I got Fish and Chips which was about 18.00 and my boyfriend got Chicken Tenders for about the same price. We expected something great since the prices were so high. Boy were we wrong. I got my plate and right away started eating the fries and realized how old they were. They were so old they were practically stale. The worst part was how it was warm as if they had just recooked it again cause even the color of the fries looked old - like they didn't change the oil in a while. (i worked in the food industry) So when the waiter came I asked for new fries. The Fish was just as bad. Very very greasy it had no flavor just tasted like grease. Chicken tenders was about the same stale and hard. We right away asked for the check there was no way we were gonna eat this. 

When we asked for our check she looked at out plates and asked why we didn't eat and we let her know the reasons. She told us, ""I bet you are used to Applebees that's why"" and we told her ... ""Well, yeah we would have actually preferred Applebees and enjoyed it better for less of the cost"".  We were very pleased when she removed our plate off the bill. I was actually very surprised.

Went here twice. First time just my wife and I stopped here for a drink one afternoon. When we told the hostess at the entrance we just wanted to sit at the bar she pretended to be offended ""oh gee thanks alot, guess you don't need my help, oh by the way, nice shirt!"" in a sarcastic tone. It was a great laugh to start off our visit to Dick's.

We bought a pitcher of coors light and were given a coors rodeo glass as a souveneir by a girl that said ""I dont really want to give you this but they said I have to because you bought a pitcher of coors light"". The people we encountered behind the bar were great. They all started off being rude and a bit rough with us but eventually warmed up and were alot of fun. Craig was a riot. not necessarily rude, just a goofball with a rough sense of humor. We loved him. Another guy with a shark hat was also fun to goof with. They all took turns sticking their tongues out at us and everyone else that walked by. Rude gestures, comments and smart ass remarks were flying left and right. Just what my wife and I are used to! 

We decided to come back again with some friends, thinking they would have just as much fun as us. Unfortunately there were different people working when we came back and they were not the same kind of ""Dick"". Seemed like the rudeness was not an act this time, they were just plain rude. Maybe I was wrong, maybe I had too many drinks in me at that point, but everyone I was with seemed to get the same vibe. We asked the girl up front if we could get a table and have some drinks since there was not enough room at the bar for our party of 6, and she said it wasnt her problem that there wasnt enough room at the bar for us. Ok. So I asked again, well can we sit at a table? She said the tables are for people that are eating. Ok. So I guess we wont be drinking here. She then says we could sit at a ""picnic table"" but would have to get our own drinks from the bar. Ok no problem. So we sit down at the first picnic table we see and a couple of us go to the bar for drinks. The girl that just told us we could sit at a picnic table yells at us ""Not that picnic table, you have to sit at one of those back there in the corner!"" Ok. We get it, we sat at the wrong picnic table and you're supposed to be rude. 

So we move to the back corner. Waited for a bit at the bar to order a drink, trying to get someone's attention but I guess because we weren't actually sitting at the bar we did not matter, or they were just being rude? They did not appear to be that busy. Finally got a girl to wait on me and tipped her a buck. We used our 2 for 1 drink coupons that a guy outside the bar gave us, then left.

Dick's Last Resort has a 'schtick': the servers are intentionally rude and make fun of patrons here, and the funny hats are apparently part of the gag.  Sounds like it might be fun, so I looked at the menu; typical of most casino restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip everything was way overpriced.  Ya know, I just don't see the point of paying a premium to be insulted.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants around with surly staff where customers can get a more 'authentic' insulting/rude treatment without paying a premium for it!

On the bright side, Dick's features live music by a decent classic rock/pop cover band-- which can be enjoyed at a more tolerable volume (and with cheaper drinks) from the nearby slot machines on the casino floor",5VaOUbsODRiqG3pGjYSnHw,5,1,2,U2twUCGJ-0KlA2xfdxi1xA

Yes, they will make fun of you and say sarcastic stupid comments if you ask a question. If you ask for a straw, they will throw it at you. If your stupid enough to ask for it, they will write witty sexual innuendo's on a piece of paper, fold it into a phallic shape, and place it on your head.

It's called Dicks. You knew the risks.

It's not totally like it's counterpart I remember so fondly in San Diego, but it's close enough. I stopped here with some friends while killing time on our way to the Luxor. The consensus was that we were hung over, and the best way to cure a hang over, keep drinking. 

The beers were cheap. Not a huge selection of drafts, but good enough. Best part, 3 dollar Patron shots during the afternoon. This took me to a much better place.

I was hoping the reviews for this place was wrong, but sadly, they were completely right and I wish I would have listened and spared myself the $60 I spend on half assed burgers and over-priced alcoholic drinks. 

First off when you walk up, it's not a restaurant, its a ghetto picnic table seating area that looks like a food truck with dinning space. Don't have the expectation of sitting at your own table, no, you sitting with random people you don't even know. 

Then they give you a drink menu, with no prices! Worst thing I did was order a drink and not ask, ""How much!"" It ended up being $25 and too over powered with girly sugary crap of alcohol; it actually made me sick because it was too sweet! 

They are rude here just FYI, that's their thing.

I had mayonnaise packets thrown at me, my burger was burnt on purpose when I asked for well done, which I thought was fucked up. The waitress humped my boyfriend for no reason and they make you where stupid paper hats that say stupid shit on them which is whatever; part of the gimmick.

Over all the food was horrible. I'd take a McD burger over that any day which is saying a lot because I am a health nut and would never go to McDonalds. The burger patty was not fresh, the lettuce was the cheap, shredded kind and wilted and the cheese was that gross off brand kind you avoid at the grocery store. 

If you can, don't come here even if you want the ""experience"", because overall the experience is horrible. You're not missing anything here folks. Take your money, go buy a Fat Tuesday and grab a bite at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr, because let's be honest, for $60 that offer is well worth it!",_osSkCDKseYcOfBFgNEpTQ,5,3,1,k2v0ICs6NyRWhnPku7r6Ew

Our waiter was rude and offered no explanations of menu lol but that was ok, asked if we could split the check he said F**K no, we all just said ok.  Our cups and flatware where tossed at us. Insults where flying but feel free to toss some back, due to the nature of things posted on hats & the flying insults I would keep kids under 15 out of here.

I ordered the Its A Wrap and have to say it was very good, turkey with apple smoked bacon and it had some fries. The menu itself is posted in 3 spots in the place and it is limited and mostly sandwiches, burgers, and finger foods.  But everything everyone ordered looked great!

At the end of the meal we tallied up our monies and most was cash and rest on one card. The waiter told us what is the exact about  to be charged on the card, we told him how much cash we had and charge the rest, he was being bitchy and said if you can't tell me I'm  charging the entire meal to the card.

Alright first off, I knew what to expect going to Dick's. I had been here for lunch once before. I remembered the food was okay, and nothing crazy happened. 
But my experience tonight was an interesting one. Despite the 1 star rating, our server was funny and probably the best thing about the whole experience. 
She made us funny paper hats and her sarcasm was fun. 

To start, we ordered two things from the menu, the Spinach/Kale Artichoke Dip, and the Bucket O' Low Country Boil. It took 45 minutes for any food to come out. 
We arrived at 11pm with lots of open tables. Only a few other groups were in the restaurant at the time. If they were very busy, I could understand why the seafood could take so long, but there should be no reason chips and dip take almost an hour to prepare. 
The bucket of seafood was okay, served with one side of melted butter. I wanted some other sauces for dipping, unfortunately nobody had asked us, and no one was around to ask after the food had been dropped off. 

Upon that, I had an empty water cup sitting for a very long time, with no servers coming to check on us. I asked for a refill before getting our food. Which I received a sarcastic ""Nope were out of water.""
We laughed and I naturally thought she was joking. 
But I wasn't sure because I never ended up seeing that refill until after we were completely finished with our meal. 

We take off our paper hats our server had made us, and start to clean up. I leave to the restroom to wash my hands. While I am away, another employee comes up behind my girlfriend. Puts a hat that he made himself on her while touching and massaging her head and hair from behind. She turns around to see who it is and he quickly walks away. 
He comes back shortly after, trying to do it again until she catches him and tells him to stop. And he responds with, ""Oh is that weird?""

I had to ask around to get his name, because he wasn't around when I got out of the restroom. Apparently his name is Doug, caucasian about 5'10, Long curly brown hair. 

Don't know how long he has been working there, but another employee says he's known for being inappropriate towards guests. He shouldn't be touching and groping girls at all. 
Surely it can't be their policy to be unprofessional like this so my advice to the management is to get rid of Doug and any other creeps like him that give this restaurant this terrible reputation.

And yes, the wait staff are dicks (at least most of them) but that is the name of the game. It is just a fun time. 

The price wasn't bad. I estimated about $65 dollars for the meal for two and it ended up being about $70 in total (including a tip) which I figure is average for Vegas, especially when you add in the cost of the huge goblet one that is big enough for two.

All in all, it was an awesome time and I loved it!",4rzniy3SQ8UABdbWlJFDpw,0,0,4,PqwmNBBLgLfnsw6TMxRbkw

I have now experienced Dick's four times here in Las Vegas. The first time we (my wife and I) went I was given a chef's hat that read ""What I Love About This Place Is I Can Have Dick's Sauce On My Chin And That's Okay."" 

The next time we went we took our son who was in his late teens at the time. We were not given any hat's, but our server did give our son what some would call ""a motorboat"". Thus he had yet to eat, yet loved this place already.

The third time we went I was given a hat that read ""I Fondle Myself During Nascar"". By now I was ready, I read the hat, looked at our server and said ""How did you know?"" During our third visit we were with my sister-in-law. The sister-in-law and I ordered the same kind of soda with our meal. What we were served was a small bucket with said soda inside it. With two straws. Now that I think of it, I hope she didn't backwash in that straw.

The fourth time the wide and I went it was just us. The wife and I, not the sister-in-law, not the now early twenty-something son. My wife's hat read ""I still love to blow bubbles."" Mind read ""Hi, I'm Bubbles."" Not a few short minutes later a man was leaving, noticed my hat and said ""Hi Bubbles."" What else could I do? I just looked at him and said ""Hi, how you doing?""

This place is fun. But if you are easily insulted, this place is not fun, go get some fast-food.

By the way, Dick's serves food. We ate all of ours. We were full after we ate it.

We ordered mozzarella sticks to share, I got the cajun chicken pasta and and the boyfriend got the fried catfish. The mozzarella sticks were nasty! When they first came out they were cold so we sent them back and when they came back (at the same time our other plates came out) they were warm so we ended up just throwing them out. My cajun pasta was alright, if the noodles weren't overcooked I could imagine it being a good plate but we had already sent the mozzarella sticks back and I didn't want to send my plate back because the place is called Dicks so I can only imagine what they would like to do if I sent another plate back. The boyfriend's the catfish was the highlight of the meal, it is the best piece of fried fish I have ever had. If I could give stars just for the fish I would it 5 stars - it was perfectly crispy, there wasn't an excess oil like most other fried food has and I really couldn't get enough of it. We ended up just sharing his plate. 

The service was hella funny which we both were enjoying - talking shit back to the waiter, listening to the stupid shit he would say to the other customers (he kept calling an older woman grandma!) and those hats they give out are hilarious. My hat said ""I make white trash look sexy"" and my boyfriends said ""Still waiting for the other ball to drop.""

Then of course the 11 year old wearing the questionable hat with the saying 'I'm living proof the pill is only 99 percent effective!'

What I didn't really care for was the little kid that looked like a 2 year old having her balloon popped next to her ear when she was not expecting it which started her crying.  Then the guy came back and gave her another balloon and said 'don't worry I won't pop this balloon' then less than 30 seconds later he cut the tie on the balloon sending it floating to the ceiling which started her crying again and then guess what?? Yeah the balloon popped.  Anyways the family seemed to be laughing about it even with the kid crying.  I didn't get it.  The kid still had a face full of tears 30 to 45 minutes later when the family all left.  That didn't seem like fun.  But really none of my business.

I pointed to my friends and he said it again more rudely.  I grab them and they show this clown their ID's.  They have to get up after they just sat down.

I thought this place would be a fun experience, mainly because of the 'attitude' of the waiters and the fun hats they give you. Sad to say I was very underwhelmed, mostly because of the awful food and expensive prices. We went here for late lunch. We ordered the big beers, thinking they would come in the fun pilsner souvenir cups, but instead those were served in cheap plastic throw away cups, so the menu is very misleading. They were also $15 a pop. What a waste. I ordered the chicken fried chicken because it sounded like the jalapeño gravy was a nice addition to the meal. There was nothing special about it, and it came with a jalapeño on the side, so I guess that is what they meant by 'jalapeño' gravy.  The mixed vegetables were just like something you'd throw in the microwave at home. My husband got the Buffalo chicken sandwich, which was basically a chicken breast dipped in hot sauce and served with a cup of ranch. For what you pay (easily close to $20 per dish) the food quality is super low. Prices should be about 1/2 of what they are on the menu. I know, I know, you are probably paying for the 'serving entertainment' but that doesn't cut it when the food is crappy and overpriced. I'd say our server was okay, she made a few fun comments and gave us the fun hats, but it could have been better. I saw other servers that were at their tables more often making the snide remarks. We won't be back. Our bill was like $75 including tip and that was absolutely ridiculous for the overall quality of the food and experience. Vegas-goers don't be fooled by the fun atmosphere here, go somewhere else! Or just settle for a drink at the bar instead of wasting money on the food.",usznJIJoszv39M-bQpwfAw,2,0,3,ODCMxAjbldoE56anOJE9cA

Or if your are in a sour mood and appreciate some a-hole behavior and jokes, then come to this place to cheer you up.  After walking for a few hours, we wound up here by chance and it was the best meal of the week.  Not so much for the food but for the great service and laughs we got throughout the meal.  The food offers the standard and traditional fare of sandwiches, burgers, BBQ, and the like.  The BBQ was pretty good and the Mac N Cheese was quite yummy amongst the sides.

The HUMOR THOUGH was priceless.  We weren't in on the joke about Dick's Last Resort but we knew we were in for something special.  After a brusque welcome and a number of sarcastic shout outs, my husband was fired up and joined in the fun.  Since the seating is like being in a picnic, you are thrust into some situations where the diners start ripping into you (a trio to our immediate right) or a couple leaving (a duo striving for a romantic evening) to the trio's right.  As the meal continued, and the waiters get a sense for their customers, hats appear with funny and inflammatory missives.

I really appreciate the attentive (and savage diatribes at times) service.  We felt comfortable in the unpretentious atmosphere.  Dick's Last Resort doesn't try to be something that it is not...what it is, is simply the natural order of things.",JBbRKYm9BckcPPWTP-ph1w,1,1,4,tC3GUUm8mADbfQcVxzjv3A

I went there anticipating to get insulted and offended and all that good stuff but (I can't believe I'm saying this) our server was not insulting enough. What I mean by this is he didn't come by to insult us enough. 

The table next to us and behind us who ordered around the same time as us finished their meals before we even got our food. I understand that may be because we had a fairly big party (there was 8 of us) but that's really not an excuse. We also waited over 10 minutes just to get our drinks (water) -___-.

Dick's is not for the sensitive or easily offended. The staff are dicks! That is the gist of this place. It's quite comical and it's fun to be a dick right back to them. In a nice way of course! I always end up laughing my ass of when I am here. The people watching alone is great. They even have sing alongs and do other goofy things. The last time I was there, they had Grease playing on all of the TV's and were making remarks on different scenes. I never realized how perverted that movie really was (like Frenchy with a banana)!

Standard fried goodies, burgers, steaks and a couple salads.  Borderline rude-obnoxious servers literally throwing silverware and straws on your park bench table you'll most likely share with new friends (for a little while, anyway).  I had the steak and shrimp for $20 and a Coors Light for $5.  Steak was actually very tender and the cocktail sauce for the shrimp had a nice little spicy zip.  One of our group had the porterhouse and someone had the big ass burger.

Issue we had was that three dinners, two small beers, two Maker's Marks and three 50oz. beers came to $185.  After some number crunching, we discovered that the server took the liberty of giving herself an 18% tip and that the 50's were $17.  Course my share of the bill (tax/tip/etc) should have been $30, but the guy in our group with the burger didn't chip in enough, so I got to make up the difference.  Yes, yes...I know.  This specifically doesn't reflect on Dick's but is the main reason why I hate dining with groups.

The ""sing along or we play bad songs"" gimmick was fun, as well as reading each others hats.  Winners include: a gal that just got married (""I'm married, I don't have to give blowjobs anymore"") and one of our guys in our group (""I'm the reason some women become lesbians"").  The rotund gentleman wearing a thong and giving lap dances was disturbing.

First the hostess seated us at the bar, claiming the server for tables was overbooked, not ideal, but fine. The bartender asked, ""What do you want, something stupid?"" to which, with a good sense of humor, we replied just a food menu. He threw the menus at us and immediately asked, ""what the hell do you want to drink?"" Already I could tell this place wasn't for me, but I was willing to roll with it. I said I needed just a minute to decide on a drink when the bartender said, ""well I'm just going to stand here and stare at you until you can stop being such an idiot."" I was annoyed and murmured something to my boyfriend, when the bartender made another comment that if I had something to say I should say it to his face. At this point I was ready to walk out, I get it's an act they're told to put on, but I'm a paying customer, give me a minute to figure out my drink order, alright? The line was crossed for me though when another couple walked in, and after waiting for a few minutes without being acknowledged by anyone (the restaurant was empty) approached the bartender and asked if they should just seat themselves. At this point he said ""Uh no. The sign clearly says wait to be seated,"" then turned to us and said ""that's as polite as I can be when you're being a complete f---ing moron.""

He was sarcastic but would actually help you. It was all in good fun. Really was expecting the server to be meaner.

The cleanliness of the place was a bit gross though. The table wasn't fully wiped down and it's just dirty everywhere. 

The food. You should stick to bar food. Don't go for jumbalaya or anything. Stick to cheeseburgers, chicken wings etc. I got a cheeseburger and it was just fine. Friend got some sort of rice dish and that was not so fine. Getting the server's attention was also a bit of a hassle. 

However, Dick's has it right when it comes to some drink specials. I can't remember how big my beer was but it definitely was enough beer to make the food taste better.

Personally, I don't care for the place too much. We went with people from out of town so it was a hoot for them. I can take it or leave it. It's worth a trip down to experience it. That's about it. It's not my favorite restaurant. The food is okay but is overpriced (you are paying for the asshole service). The other diners there are pretty obnoxious. It's like being at a crappy bar full of people who can't hold their liquor and the bar is permanently serving $2 AMF shots. Everyone just yelling, some guy took his shirt off, one lady even slipped and fell earlier and was filing out an incident report. I love seeing trainwrecks but not while I'm eating and waiting to pay.

We went around 4 in the afternoon with my teenage daughter and 8 yr old.  My kids got a kick out of the place, and the server was age appropriate with his Dick-like ways. He made my little girl a hat that says ""I pee in the pool"" and she thought it was hilarious. 

But holy crap it's expensive. $4.00 for a soda? Pay the .75 for water. Yes, you have to pay for water but the cups are great to refill when you're walking the strip.  I think they had 2 for 1 drinks at the bar but I didn't have any.  The food was ok. Typical bar food that is crazy overpriced. Yikes.

Supposedly but not sure, this place is suppose to resemble an east coast attitude type of restaurant.  The satire is to act like rude waiters and waitresses without giving a sh*t about how the patrons feel about the service.  When you first walk in, the hostess asks you if you have ever been here or know what this place is all about. You could say yes or no while you are being seated. But ultimately you will see a sign that tells you as you kind of and can't help but check the restaurant decoratives around the walls.  Or you'll hear profanity being shouted by the servers... of course in the name of fun.  

Believe it or not,  the food and drinks here are quite good.  We ordered a bacon burger, a local moco, and a rib eye steak along with a hurricane and a strawberry daiquiri slush, an iced tea, and a brownie in a cup topped with whipped cream and jarred cherries. 

The bacon burger was huge. It's prepared with generous proportions of a beef patty and bacon strips with lettuce and tomatoes served with french fries.  It was good.  The local moco was also delicious. The beef patty was also a good size topped with an egg with gravy and some hot sauce with white rice underneath.  It was tasty and I devoured it and wanted to order a second.   The rib eye steak was probably the biggest surprise of our meal.  I really did not expect anything special. I actually tried to persuade my friend to order something else. Oh boy, I was wrong! The rib eye was cooked medium, and the steak was quite big at 14 ounces. It was served with steamed vegetables, but the meat was delicious with flavor.  The iced tea is just iced tea,  but their spiked slushies are awesome.  It's sweet and is fruity... very refreshing but with liquor mixed in it.  However,  the liquor seems more camaflouged in the strawberry daiquiri though... haha.

Fyi, all the food and drinks ordered is for three people. In case you thought I was a big eater, which i am. Haha. 

Dick's is a very fun place to hang out.  Good food and drinks makes a difference. The ambiance is very east coast like indeed along with its attitude.  But you must be able to not get offended easily from what's said, and be cool.  Our waitress was actually really nice even with her wise cracks.

Stick with appetizers and alcohol-or maybe just the alcohol-here, because if you're lookin' for tasty, gourmet Las Vegas food, you're better off elsewhere. It's a dim bar/restaurant with plenty of TVs and tables and benches and chairs. The appeal here is to be treated like dicks by dicks.

I've been here twice during two separate trips to Vegas: once for convenience ( I was with a bachelorette and other girls who wanted to eat dinner here before watching Excalibur's 'Thunder From Down Under' show upstairs) and another time for 'the experience.' 

The employees act like dicks, making sometimes funny and sometimes corny but all the time off the wall jokes to passer bys, potential customers, and actual customers. That's what you come here for! The service is slow-ish. Your waiter/waitress will analyze you and put a paper hat on your head boasting some seemingly personal, blatant, sharpie-written insight. I did like their fortune cookies.

Dick's Last Resort - Dick's, Dick's, Dick's...Here's the thing - if you're easily offended, just don't go. The gimmick here is in the name - the staff act like dicks. They're rude, sarcastic, will flip you off and insult you regardless of age or gender. If you take stuff like that personally, just don't go. If you don't have a sense of humor - don't go. It's funny, irreverent, loaded with innuendo, and just...disrespectful. If you want standard service go somewhere else. If you want to get dickslapped, go to Dick's.
On to the review - the food here is pretty good for strip fare - I've had the pulled pork sandwich and tried the fried catfish and enjoyed both. The pulled pork sandwich was served with fries and was actually pretty daggone good. It's also slightly cheaper than their other sandwiches. The fried catfish here is the shiznaz! I honestly have to say this is about the best fried kittyfishy I've ever had, and I've spent my life in both Texas and Georgia so I've had a LOT of catfish. It's about $15 which is not a bad price for it, the fillets are big, the tartar sauce is good, and it's not greasy at all. The beer is cold and tasty, which is always a good thing. Beer which is warm and tasteless is swill (or being served in England)  and I flat refuse. If you order a tall beer (or have a friend who does anyway) you can keep the glass too (although it's usually made of plastic).
The main draw for me, though, week after week, is karaoke on the patio on Saturday and Sunday from 2 - 6, weather permitting. The queue is short, the selection vast, and the host is very good. Also, draughts and pitchers are 2 for 1, plus $5 shots of Jack or Jaeger during karaoke. If you like to sing, drink, or do both (like me) then go. If you have little ones, they can actually go with you. I actually saw the bartender put one of those paper hats they make on a 12 year old mentioning something about riding the short bus...laughed my ass off.

Facility: it's located inside Excalibur Casino and easy to get to from Valet.  Also learned Valet is best when coming South on Tropicana. It is a fun place that is completely open to the Casino. That part can be awkward with so many walking by watching you be humiliated...at least the Birthday girl was.  LOL!  Tables and chairs for those interested.  Didn't see any booth seating, but there was high seat bar seating. 

Service:  ok, there was some good and some ok, and some not so good.  Good =
Emily, who helped me set up my party. She is always available, and answered every question. She was awesome at getting me exactly what I wanted at my birthday. 
Hostesses at the door, not my favorite. Brook the manager, jumped right in and made me feel very welcomed, he also fixed any issues I had. 
Waitress, she was cool, but not very funny. Oh well, she was still a cool chic. Now, Taco was my fav part.  And not just because he gave me a lap dance. That man hilarious!  But he was just such a fun guy.  Yall better keep him!!!

Food:  this is the reasoning for marking the review down.  We had the bachelorette package, so we had nachos and apps to start and small meals to choose from for a set price.  It also included Jell-O shots and a large frozen drink for the bday girl. :)
Nachos - 3/5 decent. I didn't eat much though...just like 2 bites.  
Appetizer tray - 3/5 nice section of mozzarella sticks, hot wings, chicken strips and fried pickles.  My fav were the fried pickles. I ate a bunch of these. 
Now, of the plate see could chose from, I got the fried shrimp (2.5/5) on the waitresses suggestion, but man do I wish I would have gotten the brisket (4/5).  I tried one bite of my friend's, and it was yum!  This is not brisket for those that like it lean, but those like me who enjoy some fat on it.  Wish I would have chosen that!!!! Oh well. 
The other mark down was the bill. They put it all on one.  What a mess!!!!

Overall: what a fun place to have a get together!  Probably won't do it for a few more years, and won't do it again until I can drink, but I still had a great birthday thanks to Emily!!!

Typical busy bar type scene but I loved the long picnic table type of seating. Our waitress was hilarious!! She was a petite, pretty, firecracker of a gal with a sharpe tongue.  Even though she was rude (at all the right times) our service was fast and we never wanted for anything. I loved the fact that the cups are massive as well. 

We ordered several of the apps because they seemed large enough to share with the whole group. Everything was good. However the BBQ pulled pork nachos were AMAZING! I'm not just being dramatic, no. These things were awesome. To the point that when we got back home we attempted to recreate them ourselves several times; to no avail.

Dick's is a place I've wanted to try for a while, the concept is hilarious, and working as a server and bartender back home it's quite amusing that this place encourages being rude to your customers.

The atmosphere is entertaining, bus boys throwing back dishes when customers try to hand it to them, napkins all over the floor, etc.

The servers pretty much come up and shout ""what the f*** can i get you"" haha. Our table was a little more timid than some of the other tables, I was the only one who got a drink -- everyone else waters, and I think that's why the guy didn't really pay much attention to us throughout the night. The other tables who were talking back and such got a little more of the experience.

The food was just ok, I had the Ribs and Chicken which came with fries for around $18. I can't say much about the food, I mean it was a decent portion but seasoning wise it was nothing special and it kind of just felt like we were eating in some cafeteria.

Needless to say, the food may not be great but its worth it to come here at least once for the experience, come to have fun and talk back to your server, 3 stars since it's worth trying once.",iLkQHRvFnQv2xY0ikG6E2w,1,0,3,wvWjVPTnKqaHLIvWt55oFQ

As we were parched from the August sun, we decided to grab a drink and take advantage of the deal. We should have known that if they are doing these ""deals"" then something was up.

Yes, we knew it was a spoof and that the wait staff made silly hats for people and were rude, but the female bartender we got at the bar was just plain rude. First, we were traveling with two Germans who did not know what they wanted to drink in the split second the bartender wanted us to order. She was speaking too fast for them to follow and she was yelling at them. This was not a joke of any kind. She kept saying come on! come on! I got other customers! There were no other customers because the bar was empty except for us. I asked her to calm down and explained that my friends were German, but she kept yelling. Honestly, I don't know why we stayed excepted we needed a drink. We finally ordered, but the bartender was just b!tchy and rude and left a truly negative impression on us.

No wonder they have to offer buy one get one free. The place was empty and at least from our experience their b!tchy bartender is part of the problem.",Aw8tWbEI5Ypv4mH6cqYmdQ,0,2,1,QP2N6QzYqFTzaPUOJd4tnw

We were staying at this resort and needed to kill some time before doing anything, so we walk up to hostess stand and she asked how many, you know the usuals. She offers us to join a picnic style table with others or if you want the best time while there go to the bar. 

We listened. It was my first time at the bar at any Dicks. SO. GLAD. WE. LISTENED!! Major difference between bar and table is the attention you receive and you don't get one of those fancy paper hats. That sucked as it was something I remember being hilarious.

BUT... our bartender was hands down one of the funniest people I've ever experienced at a Dicks. He was really able to read guests to see how much of an ass/dick he could be and how far he could take the jokes. Some jokes were inappropriate but hello it was funny! Our bartender was KEVIN! 

It is definitely not a place to go if you don't have a silly side, if you don't know how to take a joke and don't handle sarcasm well. There was a lot of cursing and inappropriate humor but it was hilarious and WE had a great time.

We enjoyed ourselves so much we started or vacation here and ended it here. The drinks are good and are a good size for the price. The food is good too! We will definitely be back when we visit Vegas again!!!",zlK9qxbSufhN2pq8YCQaDw,3,2,5,62WMJH4_FtGyhfzHmEuawA

The food is purposefully prepared to be messy and hard to eat. For example, order the Big Ass Burger and expect a flimsy bun that falls apart if you even dare to pick it up. Mighty tasty though!

First off I have to say if you have no sense of humor then don't eat here because at this restaurant the waiters are rude and crude and they make fun of you. They also let you make fun of them which is alot of fun. Then at the end of the meal you get these big paper hats that say funny things on them. Our waitress was so funny. When we first got there she threw our plasticware on the table and walked away. Then she came back and asked us if we decided yet and was telling us to hurry the hell up. She was making funny jokes and really had us laughing the entire time. She actually scared this Asian family out of there. I don't think they knew what the place was about and she was asking them if they spoke English and she told them to lighten up. They got up and walked out. I never laughed so hard in my life. When we had a legitimate question she went into waitress mode and answered it for us. This is the only restaurant where I told a waitress to bring me a damn to go box and it was ok. My husband told her to bring us the fucking check. It was a hoot. As far as the food goes I thought it was really good actually. I got the pulled pork plate and I loved it. My husband got the BBQ beef brisket and the ribs and he loved his also. The prices were good for Vegas. We all know anything in a Vegas casino is going to cost way more than it would anywhere else so I have different price standards for Vegas.

We sat at the bar.We got right in.  Barry the bartender was a real hoot with a top notch personality. You get a tall paper hat that they write some funny saying on. Barry took a bit with mine, but nailed it. My hat read "" The health department closed my legs"" .hahaha. It was my daughters 21st bday. Her hat said "" Its my 21st and all I got was my period"" with ketchup smeared on it. So funny. If you don't know how to take a joke or comfortable with ""being roasted"" this place may not be for you. It is for those that have a sense of humor and want to laugh and not take things seriously. You also will get a balloon hat made for you. Ours was a super cute octopus with big lips.(they actually checked out my daughters tattoo and made the balloon to match it) We hated having to leave it in Vegas as it would not fit in our luggage. =( And finally the food. My daughter and I each ordered and then shared our plates. We got the Ribeye , and steak Caesar salad. We also had a coupon for a free appetizer and got Mozzarella sticks. The food was really really good. The drinks were a bit pricey. But were also very good. I had one drink and my daughter had 2. You get to keep the cups. Our bill came to $100 even.

You may or may not get a paper hat saying, ""You've taken more packages than UPS""..and yes, drink prices are strip drink prices.

We asked the hostess for a table for 4 and she told me to hold on while she danced the rest of the song, ignoring us but sat us after a minute.

But its a fun atmosphere if you come with the right frame of mind. The food isn't too bad, my brisket sandwich was overflowing with BBQ sauce and meat and I wanted a fork, but my waiter said I could stop being a pansy and eat with my fingers. When asked for a glass of water, he said that we're in the middle of the desert and that the water was being saved for Taco's water show. Bottom line though our drinks and food came out pretty fast and there weren't any complaints. At a table next to us, a mom had brought her kids with her. She was wearing a paper hat with 'MILF' written across it by the waiter. She wasn't aware of what it meant.  Our waiter said if we didn't tell her, he wouldn't bring us our drinks. I don't think I'll ever see teenage boys' faces be any redder than they were. We let her know and she was pretty red in the face too. Good times. Parents should have Urban Dictionary saved on their websites to keep up with the times, though cmon...everyone knows what a MILF is.

Ah, Taco. The man that makes this joint run. He'll give bachelorettes a lap dance while he sports a thong hanging out of his pants. Too hot to handle!! He popped in a Grease sing-a-long DVD and made his own commentary that was pretty entertaining, along with making old men dance with the videos for free drinks. But his crowning achievement is his water show. A spin off the Bellagio fountains, I won't give anything away but you'll be laughing your ass off by the time its over.

The atmosphere is a great time and ""Taco"" (their main attraction: an entertaining fellow), will definitely get you chuckling, as he frequently pulls randoms in for lap dances (men and women alike), and sports a red thong.  The main concept is that the people working there are ""dicks"" to you, ie, they will harass and insult you, but it's all in good fun, you can dish it right back.  

I would suggest going with a group for the most fun, but its a good place for drinking with friends and grabbing some food.  The prices for food may not be the most competitive (around $15 for chicken tenders--although delish), you are mostly paying for a fun atmosphere.

Let me continue my story."" say I. -- and knew well what I was getting into. I'm trying not to taint this review with how very out of my normal ""happy place"" a place like Dick's is. I'm a quiet bar, good whiskey, long rambling conversation, sort of girl. Dick's is...conducive to these things.

One of our party kept hitting himself in the nuts with the yard long slushie tube around his neck. So that was how the night was gonna be, and these are my friends. I had chosen to be here. So it is in that context, I review Dick's Last Resort.

The Bachelor in question had a blast. So that was the first and foremost goal. Accomplished. Our ""Dick"" waiter was actually quite funny, and had the tact to realize who could take, and wanted to take the brunt of his ribbing, (Hint. He kept hitting himself in the nuts with a 3 foot slurpee. Surprise.) Or maybe he just went for the low-hanging frozen fruit. Either way, he dished it out pretty evenly with liberte and egalete and fraternite, and then focused like a comedic laser. The show was definitely the best part of the experience, and makes me want to hike the review to four stars.

It's the combination of food/beer, and price point that prevent me from doing so. I had hot wings (a side of hooters quips) which were pretty good, the sauce tasted an awful lot like Franks RedHot, and some mozzerella sticks, which were...okay. Damned tasty after I had my second beer. But woah, that beer was expensive. Even for the strip. The whole bill was somewhere around $60. For 2 beers and 2 appetizers, pre-tip for the entertainment. Yeah.

The food wasn't that much more amazing than a TGIFridays type place; less of a frozen gloppy taste but still not worth $60 for wings and mozzarella sticks. I knew it was gonna be spendy, but at the end of a 'meh' meal, it's pretty hard to swallow plopping down a cool hundred for bud, decent entertainment and food you didn't particularly like. 

You go to Dicks for the show, but be prepared to pay Strip Inflated prices. I think the next time I go I'll eat before I head out there, and then my budget won't hurt so bad.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,3,2,3,hxyYsXcEIC9MZDuAIHQgSQ

My waiter was cool. I knew I was in love with the idea of this place when he walked up and just threw the forks and knives onto the table and walked away.

That was pretty much it. I was here with my best friend and my parents, who are totally cool, but for some reason my mom was NOT having a good time (even though she very well knew what she was getting into) and was in a piss poor mood the entire time and made it awkward. I think the waiter picked up on it, so he wasn't ever around, so I didn't really get the experience.

The only thing was that he walked up right as I had just started looking at the menu and asked if everyone was ready. I kind of looked up and he said, ""Or I can come back, you know. I have other shit to do."" which, of course, tickled my funny bone.

Other than that, like I said, literally no interaction. I did get a hat, but no talkin'-to or anything. If I had come here with just my friend, or even my dad, I'm sure we would have had a hell of a good time.

Ok, here's the deal. The only reason why Dick's has received so many low ratings is for one of the following: 
    Horrible food - understandable, but come on, it's in the MEXcalibur!
    Horrible Service - um, clearly you're illiterate and didn't read the sign out front
    Overpriced - it's VEGAS!! Go to Circus Circus if you want $2 beers all day

Now, for the GREATNESS that is Dicks. As our waitress Nancy simply put it, it's ""service with sarcasm"", and that's what she gets paid to do. Examples - she just threw the napkins, beer cups and forks onto the table, yelled at us for not being ready to order and had little nicknames for some of us.

Do some of the remarks made by the waitstaff border on cruel and degrading, ABSOLUTELY, but that's what makes this place so great. In addition, they make (almost) everyone paper hats with witty remarks on them. Here are some of the best that I remember: 

""If found, please return to the nearest Home Depot parking lot"" (Mexican Guy)
""Just call me 'Summer's Eve', cuz I'm a douche""
""I've given more rides than Seabiscuit"" (blonde sorority girl)
""Handjobs - $1""
""I fart KY jelly"" (Macho frat guy)

All I can say is that you need to come here for the EXPERIENCE, not the SERVICE/FOOD. In fact, by the end of our meal, we were helping our waitress come up with sayings for other people and she even put on the ""Handjobs - $1"" hat and took pictures with us holding up $1 bills.

I have dyed red hair so mines said ""The red is fake. The slut is real"". They are that type of funny. I believe Taco is the owner I love him!

I understand the premise of the place, staff treating you like garbage and you're supposed to laugh it off as part of the charm, but for real, you gotta draw a fuckin line somewhere.

My story: A friend and I came here to grab a drink and we see a bunch of people wearin these weird paper hats with things like ""asshole"" and other insulting shit like that written on them. I won't write what some of 'em say because they were just plain gross (especially for a place that serves food), again, understand where the line is. 

So I start talking to one of the bartender chicks and she tells me the hats are insults that they label individually and, in one of the most twisted compliments (may have been a pass, I really don't fuckin know or care to know for that matter) I've ever had heaved at me in my life. She says to me ""like if I was to make a hat for you it would say 'You're not worth the AIDS I'll get,"" I really couldn't believe she had the gall to say that, but I managed to maintain my cool and dish it right back to her saying ""right on, so if I was gonna make one for you it'd say 'titties in progress' right?"" then just turned around and walked away. 

I'm not HIV positive or have AIDS but can you fucking imagine, if I did, the lawsuit I could file against this place?!?!? Also if I did, that would just not be in the most poorest of tastes to say. Even for a place like this.

Anyways the moral of the story is, know when to draw a line if you're gonna run this type of joint because it's a pretty slippery fuckin slope and shit could get real bad throwing words like that around.",7DHI26h1sNDwot13kXN3_w,8,2,1,Tc9AtxUmS_fb4Jwz9YBh1g

The Vegas location tries too hard to be over the top. The way I describe it to my friends is that San Diego developed their style while Vegas hit the ground running and I don't mean that in a good way for Vegas. Anthony, the bartender in San Diego, knows his audience and tailors his ""rudeness"" accordingly. Vegas is like one size fits all. Guess what, it doesn't. And maybe it's the layout. San Diego is one huge rectangle of an old warehouse. You can read the menu on the wall from almost anyplace you sit and if you can't guess what, there's a menu right in front of you. I even had a waitress write a menu in chalk on the ground in front of me. Here I've had to get up in order to read a menu that you can't read because there is a post or a wall in the way. Oh, yeah.

I've been wanting to check out Dicks for a long time but never had the chance while I was in Vegas.  I'll just go over the major awful points.  There will not be a good point section because there are no good points that go along with the story.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 
Hands down the worst.  The place was pretty full (not 100% full) - I've seen it busier.  I asked the hostess if they had any tables available and was told no but that I can sit at the bar if we like.  I asked her if the experience was still the same - she told me that everyone still gets picked on and gets the funny hat and the experience they pay for.  With her assurance I accepted a seat at the bar for my mother and I.  

Our blonde waitress was also the bar tender.  She was not super friendly at first but she also wasn't horrible.  She got our drinks and took our food orders in a semi-efficient manner and that was that.  We were left in the corner of the bar with another group of patrons to eat our food and watch the entire restaurant have a great time with the staff while we were ignored.  Several other waiters walked by us but didn't even bother saying Hi.  

Towards the end of our dining experience (over an HOUR) into it.  We asked about the hats.  The bar tender/waitress got really mad and told me she ""is very busy and doesn't have time to deal with hats"" and walked away.  WOW.  For the first time in my life I left a big fat $0.00 on the tip line.

FOOD:
Not awesome or unique or even flavorful in anyway.  My mother got the fish and chips which were soggy and a bit cold and I got a burger which tasted like any other burger, in any other restaurant in the country.  My 1st bottled beer was not ice cold.  The 2nd one (draft in a Dicks cup) was better and my mother's Huge margarita was good.  I would not willingly pay for the food again.

ATMOSPHERE: 
Its horribly loud.  I expected it to be loud.  But it was so loud that I had to yell in my mom's ear while sitting right next to her to have any kind of conversation.  If I had a fun waiter and we were getting fun hats and I was tipsy and fun then I would have loved the atmosphere.  But none of those things happened.

VALUE:
Do I even have to talk about this?  In the end we paid $72.00 for a bland burger, soggy fish and chips, two beers and a margarita.  You walk into a place like this and expect to pay big time for what the place has to offer that is unique. We didn't get any of that.  I will never go back and will never recommend this place to anyone else.  It will actually even push me from staying at the Excalibur because I like to eat where I am staying at least one day during my Vegas vacations.  STAY AWAY and spend your money elsewhere.

I told the hostess about the problems we had afterwards.  She didn't apologize and didn't even ask if we wanted to talk to a manager.  Nice.",1zaBvrsRh5txOgsByrmLEQ,1,4,1,FNnGlszLyCBmFUhef-hWbA

Now I'm guessing you are mostly paying for the entertainment... They put the little funny hats on and you laugh a little and so on, but our waitress lacked a sense of humor and was hardly rude as she was suppose to be. Very plain Jane. Anyways the only true positive I have to say about this place is my dos Rita drink! Was actually really good. It was a large glass of margarita with a dos Equis inside.

Then I was interested to see what it was all about. The waitress didn't really do much that was shocking other than cursing so in a funny way I was a little disappointed with their expectations. I ordered the Dick's Meal; a slab of St. Louis' Ribs with BBQ Beans and sweet potato fries. The ribs were not impressive at all, the beans were good, the sweet potatoes were all right. I ordered a tall glass of Shock Top beer which tasted fine and I got a souvenir cup to go with me. I couldn't hear anybody at all in the place because the music was so loud. It was funny to read some of the paper hats that the staff put on the guests, they were not very PG rated which made it funny. After all of that the waitress added her gratuity to our bill so we ended up not leaving any extra tip since their service was nothing to rave about.

5453698,2009-09-11,7,g8oxQ1Ji9mr9PMjhEfaWSg,"When we stumbled into Dick's we did not know that it is their intent to be rude and insulting.  I caught on pretty quick as I looked around and read the hats of fellow patrons some of which said:

""daddy says I'm more flexible than mommy""
"" I swallow on the first date""  
""moses popped my cherry""

We caught on quick when a rude ass server came up and said ""i'm hungover""  and thru down a bunch of napkins and silverware on our table.

I said ""perfect, so are we!""

We all got along just fine!

the servers point uninterested at the menus on the wall and drag their feet while they move from table to table. 

We had a great time listening to the heavy guy on the mic insult folks and do lap dances.  And yes - my daughter got one.

I could not resist when he said ""anyone having a birthday???""  I pointed to my girl.  She shook her head back and forth like she was possessed but I didnt care - i kept on hollering!

The lap dance is a funny mockery of a very not cute guy in a very small red thong that is pulled out high on his waist so you can see it when he removes his shirt (all while dancing) to expose a big old belly.

It was comedic to those of us that did not have big man ass in our faces.  Keep in mind my daughter is probaby 5'7"" and maybe weighs 115 pounds and here is this big ass dude bumping and grinding in her face.  

She was a good sport in the end and laughed with us as we watched the video.

Her best friend got a hat that read ""easier to get into than a community college"" 

The food was actually pretty good for dive grill food and the drinks could use more booze in them but does not matter - we had a blast and left stuffed.

Food quality was mediocre at best. Ordered the half slab of ribs and chicken wings. Was not really impressed at the quality of either. The ribs reminded me of something slow roasted in an oven all day, and aside from the sauce didn't have much of a BBQ taste to them at all. Wings were overcooked, and then heavily sauced.

5520315,2015-04-14,3,g8oxQ1Ji9mr9PMjhEfaWSg,"One Liner: I got charged $5 extra when I don't think I should have been.
Story: I went to Dick's for the first time with my girlfriend. She told me all about it and I was excited for a fun meal. The waitress was rude and insulting, just as I was hoping for.  I played along and pretended to be a dorky academic type just for fun.  I got a funny hat as did my girlfriend.  Everything great so far. 
The food was mediocre at best, about on par with Denny's. (I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and my girlfriend got a Philly cheesesteak.)  We decided to get a drink from the bar to share in souvenir cup: $27.  We had a coupon for free fried pickles that we used - they were quite salty, but still pretty good.
Then I decided to give back some of the insults I was getting, so I wrote on the table with ketchup, ""IF MY WAITRESS SUCKED HARDER I'D ORGASM."" As soon as she saw it she said that she could legally charge me for that, so I simply held out my hand for the bill. Sure enough, she added on $4.99 for ""add chicken"" that I never ordered. Thankfully she took off the charge for the fried pickles, but only after I reminded her to. After she saw the table message, her attitude changed. No insults, no talk back, she became cold and distant and dealt with us very little, only as long as was needed to handle our immediate requests. ""Maybe she was busy with other customers,"" you might say. Yes, she was busy interacting a lot with other customers in the way she is supposed to, but not with us.
Now, I understand that ketchup on the table is mess to clean up, but I wrote it on the DISPOSABLE PAPER table cover - the mess can be simply picked up and thrown away. Even if she claimed that the ketchup would seep through the paper, so would any other grease, oil, accidentally spilled drink, and any other wet thing that got on the table cover during the normal course of a meal, so there is effectively no difference - she'd have to clean it anyway.  If she claimed that I used too much ketchup, what would she say to anyone who simply likes ketchup or some other condiment? Would she actually charge extra money to patrons for using too much mustard, or salt, or pepper? What if I had accidentally dropped and spilled it? Also, a 32 oz. bottle of ketchup from Walmart costs $2.82, and I believe that restaurants buy such things for less because they buy in bulk. Perhaps she was insulted by my comment. Understandable. But, how could she work in a place where the shtick is to insult patrons yet be unable to tolerate insults tossed back at her?
So, like I started with, $5 I didn't need to pay. That was BS. So I took it out of her tip. Your welcome, waitress, for me giving you anything other than a rude gesture for a tip.",GhuvhtNfeDPBeKWgcTiiWQ,1,2,1,QHL_SBQYhjDPjdfv8SYDNQ

5613302,2012-12-22,6,g8oxQ1Ji9mr9PMjhEfaWSg,"I came here with a group of friends on my bachelor party weekend and was not disappointed.  It is probably the most unique restaurant concept I have ever seen - a bold experiment in hospitality, wherein the servers are hired based on their natural capacity to be surly and obnoxious and say absolutely whatever they feel like to their patrons.  

Here is a slice of the conversation that occurred while I was ordering:

Me: ""I will have...hmmm....just give me one sec""
Her: ""Hurry the f%$k up.  I need to take other orders.""
Me: ""OK, sheesh, how's this salad?""
Her: ""Not bad, if you're a p&ssy.  I'll put you down for a steak.""
Me: ""Um, thanks but I don't want the steak.  I want the salad.""
Her: (rolls eyes, goes to the next person) ""And what the f@#k do YOU want?""

I'm not sure how you would like being involved in the above ordering process, but I have to say, I found it refreshing.  Even though I'm a huge fan of great service at restaurants, in life you so rarely encounter someone who is speaking their mind with such utter abandon, that experiencing it is a true novelty.  

Do not come here with someone who is easily offended or insecure.  But if you can appreciate being ragged on the whole time you eat and maybe dish it right back to them too, you will have a huge amount of laughs, and memories, on the other side.",otjeHRAnSAwThMCdelJ8cA,0,1,5,xXUmBojYezZBkBAAJZU6tw

Ok, then.  I'm just giving it what it wants.

Maybe it's that I was taken in by the name... we were starving, every place was closed or with long lines, and, well, it was our last resort (more on that later).  Maybe it's that I can only appreciate rude humor and mediocre food when it's not accompanied by an astronomical bill.  Maybe I'm just a sourpuss. But this place sucks.

Later on in the trip, we would have known, with pictures of dirty overweight hairy shirtless bartenders adorning posters encouraging us to come to Dick's Last Resort for abuse.  But only a few minutes after arriving in Vegas, starving, with most restaurants in Excalibur closed and the buffet line with no end in sight, we decided to sit at the bar and grab a snack.

The bar is right next to Excalibur's 'Party Pit', a phenomenon we only saw that Sunday afternoon, where one underwear clad dancer appeared after another gyrating to mediocre rock.  Yes, this IS the highlight.

The bar was tended by two rejects from the school of obnoxious sidekick characters in bad 80s drinking movies, and one grumpy girl who seemed out of place in a land of innuendo, chauvinism, and party pit girls.

The one guy was the shirtless poster guy, leering at women at the bar, pouring beer on himself, and making the lewd paper hats I would later see middle aged women walking around Vegas in later in the week, proclaiming, 'Dick says my vagina smells bad' to all the world.  The other guy apparently gets his wardrobe from the lewd sidekick thrift shop, complete with fake cowboy hat with loop hanging under chin, Hawaiian shirt, and, of course, modified Van Dyke.

The female bartender wore a sweat shirt, jeans, and a scowl.

We got a shrimp entree to share for $20. It had 5 shrimp and some fries.  My companion also got a weakass Malibu and coke for $15.

We left.

I'll tell you what Dick's Last Resort  did leave us with... some lingering entertainment.  I had a mental block over remembering the name of the place, especially when I would agitatedly try to describe the horridness of the place, leading me to develop increasingly bizarre and inappropriate alternates, usually completely unintentionally.

If you met me in Vegas, the restaurant I am describing may have been called, among others:

- I'm so small, I pee on my balls.
- Happy ending $5
- Deposit here (with a hole for where the mouth is)
- It's razor burn, not herpes.
- When I was a man, my name was Steve.
- I choke my chicken to Little Mermaid.
- I lost my virignity to Moses.

The girl that had the ""Deposit here"" hat, I felt bad for her.  The waiter got ""all the guys"" attention, (Yes, she was an attractive girl.) and pulled the hat down to where the mouth matched the hat's whole.  I felt so bad for her!

The food here, I thought was freaking delicious! I ordered the ""Big Ass Burger"" and it was superb!

Service, sucked for obvious reason.  The fat guy, ran around the tables with butcher paper screaming for us to pick everything off the table so he could throw it on as our tablecloth.  Threw our water cups at us.  We had 5 at our table, he threw way more than that.  The utensils were metal and he dropped it on the table.

It's nestled inside Excalibur, right next to the wee bar/stage thing that dancers occasionally come out and preform on. So while you wait 45minutes to be seated, you have nothing to do but watch them wriggle their butts. 

The food. It's pretty much disgusting. Not worth the price at all. I took one bite of my Buffalo Chicken sandwich and had to force my boyfriend to trade me for his brisket sandwich. I can usually put up with bad food, but this was beyond bad. It was dry, too bready, badly spiced or something, and the only thing I enjoyed were my french fries.

The only redeeming factors revolved around the atmosphere. Now I've been to the Dick's in San Diego, and the employees in Vegas, definitely take advantage of their location. They were raunchier and ruder, and definitely a lot more fun. Our waiter placed a paper hat that said ""douche-bag"", on our most drunk part member, which actually was spot on we discovered as our trip progressed. There was also a balloon-artist who made the most fantastic spider man hat for a little boy sitting at a table next to us.

Food:  So it took us 45 minutes to get our food and there was only 4 people at our table, 3 of them ordered regular food and i ordered french fries (since im vegetarian there was nothing but french fries that i could eat here)  Everything in this place is fried, i'm surprised the drinks weren't fried too.  According to my friends, food was ok.  I don't think it was worth waiting 45 minutes.  My opinion go to the food court upstairs.

I think Dick's throws away more trash then all of vegas because there's constantly napkins on the floor (tons of napkins) and the covers for the tables are paper.  Once you leave, they bunch up the plastic cups and paper covers and throw it away.  This is just stupid.  Whatever happened to washable table covers and cups?

Beer: here' s a tip - don't order beer from the tap. It comes with a ""souvenir"" plastic 'glass' and therefore costs $10 for cheap stuff like Coors Light and $12 for better beer. And that's for the small one. You can instead buy a 24 oz tall-boy in a can of Miller Lite for $5. Also look around for beer specials, we could have bought 2 pitchers of PBR and had a 3rd free. The bartenders don't willingly inform you that their beer's a rip off. 

Food: another tip - don't eat it. It's just awful. We were a big group so I saw what all came out. Completely mediocre bordering on sketch. I got some awful thing with rice, a hamburger patty, eggs on top with gravy. The hamburger party and the gravy were nasty. The patty clearly comes to them shaped and frozen and when sliced into it looks like the most pathetic and low quality beef ever. Blarf.

The male host seated us at a table by the stage where a live band was playing.  The live band was great, and probably the main reason this review is getting one star (if zero were an option).  We were at our table for about 15 minutes and no one approached us... okay, so is that part of them being ""dicks?""  Not sure, so we ordered our first round of drinks at the bar.  $20 for a ""pitcher"" of bud light... it was about half the size of any other pitcher I've ever seen.  $11 for a Jameson and coke.  $13 for a Red Bull and well vodka.  Ummm... is this fucking Tao?  The drink prices were outrageous!  I kinda thought maybe that was part of the ""joke"" here, but holy shit.  Make me a stupid hat that says I'm a whore and I'll laugh, but I find no humor in nightclub-like drink prices at this sort of establishment.  We remained at our table for an hour and a half, and eventually the SAME host who seated us came up and asked very rudely who sat us at the table.  And I don't mean rudely in a Dick's sort of way. I mean just plain rude. At this point we were over being neglected, so we headed out. My friend complained at the front about us getting no service and the host who seated was asking why he seated us where he sat us (you follow?).  The other host told us we shouldn't have been seated at the table we were at because the waiter in charge of that table went home sick.  So have another fucking waiter cover the table!  Every table around us was getting service.  How does that even make sense? And the solution the host offered us for our anger?  ""Come back tomorrow.""

This is one of those places you don't take everyone you know.
Especially if they get offended easily by the things that the servers can say to you,

They make hats with sayings and put them on different people and they don't know what theirs says  and when they look they get pretty embarrassed,

We have had their drinks here as well as food. Of course if you get a few drinks in you then you won't mind being here lol

They have a stage here they have different shows here. I remember years ago they did a Elvis competition. That was really fun. I am not sure if they still do it or not.
This can be a fun time the more people you have with you that you know.

Immediately conveying that I was merely an inconvenience in her busy day was a horrible first impression. The bar & restaurant wasn't even full at the time, a weeknight around 7pm. Not that this would have even been a justification. This person conveyed that they barely cared that I had just entered the business.

She came back and reviewed our ID's, I ordered my one beer, and the mrs said she just wanted to drink water. The beverages were brought back, and I offered money immediately, without asking the cost. I got my change back, and discovered by looking at the receipt that they charge 75 cents for a glass of water. Seriously. I was a bit stunned.

The menu was set with a few appetizers--nachos, fried pickles, cold mozzarella sticks, and cold chicken wings. I liked the nachos. Dinner choices were chicken with rice, brisket, fried shrimp, shrimp cocktail, or chicken strips. Shockingly the brisket was tender, juicy, and flavorful. I didn't order this assuming it would suck. My fried shrimpies were quite amazing but the chicken looked dry and unappetizing. 

Granted, you don't come here for the food, but rather for the experience. My friend's lap dance by taco was one of the highlights along with the balloons they tied to her hair. It was a scene from a Pixar movie....my fave part of the night. 

Good times, good service, but our waitress royally screwed up on the bill and charged us extra gratuity on top of our bill which turns out to have already included the 15% gratuity and birthday booking charge. Kinda messed up. We had no clue at the time but thought the bill was unusually high and couldn't make sense at the time.

It didn't taste like Beef, it didn't look like beef it was the weirdest gray color I have ever seen. When I only had 2 bites my friend decided I was a wuss and went to give it a try... he spit it out. The only thing on our entire table that was worth eating were the wings. That may have only been because I was trying to get the taste of that burger our of my mouth. Overall of the literally 1,000's of places for you to eat in Vegas this is the worst for food quality.

I was wrong. Boy was I wrong.

You were closing. Closing at midnight. Midnight??!!?? We're in Vegas. You are advertising that you stay open late. Late in any town is 2-3 am and late in Vegas should be 5 am but not midnight.

I averaged it out to a 4 star review because it was highly entertaining after we got used to it of course. ;) 


  We had no idea when we came in why all the servers kept walking past us and refusing to sit us. They continued to ignore us. Then someone came by, looked at us ignored us and then sat the folks last in line. Even they were aghast and murmured a quick, ""sorry"" to us. We asked to be given a table adding, ""We have been here a while."" The guy threw the menus at us and said, ""Oh ya have have ya? Give me a break. Sit yourselves."" We were like, "" WTH?""  We were appalled but somehow I recognized something in a fellow actor. Maybe, it was the twinkle in his eye. So before I strangled him and demanded to see his manager, I poked my head into the restaurant to see what was up. Rude caveman sighs, loudly I might add, and begrudgingly walks us to our table. He asked if we had ever heard of the place or been in. When we said, ""no"" this is when all hell broke loose.  The ""stupid"" word was used, He yelled as he walked us to our table "" Coming through with some Moronic Newbies.""  napkins were thrown at us, food passed by with phallic symbols on it, eye rolls of impatience and sympathy from the fellow staffers, etc and so forth. We sat there for about 2 minutes with our jaws on the table before we finally got the fact it was suppose to be this way. Then we rolled on the floor laughing. Of course this just gets the waiter even more annoyed with how silly and dumb we were. lol--- Thank God I am not a prude or embarrassed easily. To be honest I was embarrassed anyway. My friend starts to really get into it and I have to remind her she is a wife, mother, and grandmother so sit the heck down and behave. This is when we noticed the equally offensive slogans, posters hanging around on the walls, the waiter made hats on the fellow customers, and songs being sung for birthday patrons. ""My Dearie Goody Two Shoes Ears!"" YIKESAROONI!

So as you have gathered by now it is a themed restaurant where they purposely treat you nasty/saracastic/rude/raunchy etc. It gets dirty though so please do not bring kids here. There were tons here when we were there and that really bothered me since there is no warning sign out front. Also,do not go if you are offended by that sort of thing.

What was really fun was whenever a new person comes in. People sit here all day to watch their confused faces, like ours, before they get the joke. It is like the customers are the audience and you are the new actors on stage. When the group of four 80 plus year old's came in and sat next to us we could not control our laughter over their confused and outraged faces. My friend and I were laughing so hard that helped them catch on and finally figured it out. It is an interesting human psychology experiment to watch. Human nature at it's best. Go Gramps and Grams because they were getting into it too! After eating We never wanted to leave the place. We were having so much fun.

Oh to review the food, what food? Don't ask us about the food. We honestly have no idea because we do not remember. We do remember the food and restaurant is beach themed if that helps.

We finally got up to leave after an hour and the manager says, So how was everything?"" Before we could answer he says, ""Well it had better have been good. You took long enough. Your friend there was all over my man server. Now get the hell out of my place."" Brawhahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!! We'll be back next week.

I live in Chicago and have been to the one there many, many, MANY times but still when alcohol means money...you better wait on people quick or they'll get to steppin...such as we did.",T4qbZR0VHBPESlB1l7jTZw,6,4,1,_WTqY-So0XiweUelci_E1Q

Had to kill an hour so I stopped in here for a light lunch. Wow, there's nothing light in here. My ""sampla platta"" was huge for one guy. The bartender Kevin was awesome. He immediately was crass and swearing but this is what you get in Dick's. They even have a sign that says 21+ so no kids and for a good reason! They yell at you and swear and are sarcastic. I loved it all. They let me sit and nurse a beer for an hour and eat. My only issue was $11 for a beer! You get a free plastic cup that I didn't want and forgot to take home, but other than that this place rocked.",X0X3hiKv5CigUec1XYi_pg,1,2,4,l904Wu8DJJ3zR5dPzXr5Jw

Our server Carla was funny and entertaining. She was crude and rude in the right way for the theme of this restaurant. However, as good as she was about playing her role, she was slow to take our order and get us our drinks and refills. Eat at this place for the experience because the food isn't anything to rave about.",1IsREJa7MlHiDce33zyOnA,1,0,3,vSokM5Wf4joXmtZZZdPzzg

We came here for a friend's birthday, (well the start of the birthday... I'll write the review of the strip club later). 4 girls, 4 guys, and had an AMAZING TIME. The atmosphere was amazing, granted we showed up completely trashed to begin with, but we had a ton of fun. Got a table right up near the stage and the birthday girl was immediately treated to a lap dance or two from some of the male servers... Our waitress (who's name I dont remember) was FUCKING HILARIOUS. Just yelling at us and throwing shit our way. At one point when I started mouthing off back to her she actually got up in my face and went nose to nose with me!!!! Despite all this she managed to take really good care of us and knew exactly when to be a dick and when to be serious about her job and refill our drinks and what not.  

KEEP IN MIND - this place is not for the easily offended! But if you go in knowing what to expect (i.e - hats proclaiming that you have a tiny dick or that your vagina whistle's in the wind) you will have a GREAT time!",27mHgKDab3yV7ZiaHya2xQ,0,0,4,atNzOrj7qfb7roYvtUQm7A
