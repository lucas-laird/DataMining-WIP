Had their meat lovers pizza, I forget the name of it but it started with a G. Pizza was great though and they have numerous craft beers on draft. If you like a lighter brew try their Horizon ale. It is a great specimen of a light beer. Overall great experience, the bartenders are lively and with the back and forth bar convo there was never a dull moment.

It has a really cool atmosphere, and a great patio with nice outdoor heaters. We chilled outside on the patio all night and our server (I can't remember his name) was on point. I can't say anything about the food, as none of us ordered any. The beers are a little pricey before happy hour, when they become half price.

1087331,2016-07-13,1,zmltWmTpoBt5sCU-5Kzj-Q,"I suppose it's possible that I just came here on a bad night, but I doubt it. The drinks were nothing out of this world, but weren't bad. What made this a one star experience was the service. I met two friends here who were sitting in the dining area when I arrived. There were maybe six other customers in the whole place, and it took roughly ten minutes after I ordered for the ""waitress"" or whatever her title is to bring me my drink. We then relocated to the bar area which apparently caused some huge issue with the check. Two other friends then met up with us and were served fairly quickly, I'll give them that. Once they were served, the bartender sat with another employee who was not yet on the clock shooting the breeze while I sat and waited for at least 15 minutes to order another drink. The bartender then proceeded to put all of our checks together for some odd reason, and when we asked her to split them, she split the whole check in half instead of splitting them per individual. Is it not common sense to ask each person if they want to start a tab? Why would you assume that a party of five people who all walked in separately would want to be on the same check?... Not to mention that one of the people in our group had already paid for his drinks before he left, but we were charged for those drinks AGAIN on this five person check. The whole experience here was weird/unprofessional and unlike any bar I've ever been to. I almost felt as if the bartenders thought that WE were the ones inconveniencing THEM. I definitely won't be returning here and I doubt that my friends will either.

The only good thing I have to say about this bar is that they have USB ports built into the sides of the bar that can be used to charge your phone. What a concept.

Also, props to the bartender Ryan who took over after the two girls had left and actually decided to take care of us. You the real MVP, Ryan.",pXNZYh9NOKEk_3AlssNS2g,0,1,1,IMTyGmYjK9jy2R3dz_NVeg

Good lively gang of people at the bar and in the restaurant. Let me start by praising the attentive staff, they are easy on the eyes and friendly. I ordered the Calamari and the Boulder Stout. Calamari is my personal favorite. The Boulder Stout was surprisingly tasty, I don't normally drink heavy beers, but this will be a favorite of mine. As I sat in the restaurant, I tried to think of another restaurant to compare it to. However, it's hard, it's cool like my favorite buffalo wild wings without the high school drop out crowd. PT'S Brewing is a place to come in with friends, yet, not on your own unless you sit at the bar. Most tables sit four and I felt awkward sitting by myself. It is located across the Mountain View medical building. Incidentally, your crafted beer is delivered by a man sporting a cool beard, the barkeeps are attractive, the wait staff charming and even the young guy who brought my dish looked smart. Yes, I left and quickly made north towards my pub. I can't wait to visit PT's Brewing again...I hope someday PT's can carry the beers made here.",O9pMFJSPg80YVzpMfNikxw,0,0,5,Rt_jAs5CGz8IeJrXvK7aGw

I don't know what PTs has done, but this chef knows his way around the kitchen. The food is always good. You must try the shrimp and grits, by far one of the best things on the menu.

This time around...PTB is is full operation.  Parked and walked in during happy hour and found a mellow vibe.  Lot's of different peoples just chilling, eating, gaming, drinking, watching TV, and doing a little of all the previous mentioned.  

Sat down towards the rear and took a gander at the happening in the brewery while I waited for friends.  The service was attentive and advised me I was in the happy hour.  The service kept me abreast of how long I had to enjoy the happy hour with every round....Cool.

I ordered up a Chicken Caesar Salad with steak.  When it arrived it was healthy serving, but not in the traditional meaning of healthy.  By that I mean, it was filling and left me not wanting anything more than I could sip from a glass.

Beer!  They got it.  You want some local brew...you got it.  You want some beer from someplace else..you got it.

Not a manic PT's by any stretch.  Looking for a place to chill?  This is it.  Wi-Fi is free and while putting in for tags for Utah after the group arrived, the Wi-Fi was seamless.

Menu was very different from PT's. Prices were a little extreme $15 for a grilled cheese? Hamburger was only $10 I'm not sure why the prices were so crazy.

The drinks of course never fails me which it always a plus.

There seems to be a weird vibe here. Maybe because it's a bar and people are drunk. But it's crazy mellow. Last night, there was a wasted couple that we're having a heart to heart. The guy started crying. It was super awkward. And of course, they drove home. 

The food here is not that great. We've had:

 The fingerling potatoes - super weird. It's boiled potatoes with a sour cream dip. 
The Brew House burger. The bun was good, but the meat did not taste like Kobe. It was well done when I asked for medium. 
Shrimp curry - the curry was good. But they use minute made rice, which completely fucks up the whole dish. You have to serve basmati or jasmine rice with curry. Seriously. It makes the dish what it is. That or serve it with no rice. But they pile the curry on top of the pre cooked horrible rice. 

Overall, I'm not impressed. PT's brews aren't that great. You're better off sticking with different brews or liquor.

The renovation does look great. And again, the bartenders are really awesome. Very nice, tentative and make it a better place. Just hoped for a better outcome of everything.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,20,18,3,FoXWimlyMWWphf79ve5DsA

Then we had Susan who was every bit as friendly as Joey and even more personable. Now she is gone  There has been questionable food production over the last couple visits as well.
Now we have Jeremy. I want to give him a chance but in my humble dollar driven opinion, he has stumbled out of the gate.
My wife and I went in last night as it has become on of our regular spots. 
This is when we find out the changes. Ok we can work with this. Sure he is personable and quick to get our beverage and food order.
We play a couple 20's each.... I get two Miller Lite's (yeah I know we are at a brewery) my wife gets a couple Jamison and Gingers. We order a sandwich with fries to split all is good.
Well until I wanted ketchup.....no follow up until we are 90% finished and who cares about condiments at this point.  
Now we ask for the bill and get the bill. 
What, not even a comped bottle if Miller Lite?
Really?  
Now don't get me wrong. I will happily pay. We usually get one drink comped for every 20 we bet. 
Looks like Ace's and Ales and Big Dog's move up in the batting order and PT's is gonna get benched for a while. This is ok as the beer selection has been missing the mark lately anyhow.

 We ordered calimari, which again, was neither good nor bad, but I did think considering the venue food should be priced about 15-20% less.

Had his Dave's Double IPA, it's a very good double.   Also, his west coast IPA is still on the mark.   Wifey had the Sean Patrick Irish which was also really good.   It's a pretty chill place and the staff there is very friendly.",5wRCMyU9dEdkja_mO0qfeQ,1,0,5,SjqbuJyTTbTkHE5nhOoCPQ

The bar was pretty tame and the bartender was friendly. I had looked at the draft choices online so I'd be prepared. I requested the brew with mango and guava, as listed for this location. He offered me the Sahara Pale Ale, which as it turns out wasn't the one with mango and guava (Festival Pale Ale). I did ask for the Festival after consulting the draft board. They had quite the variety going for draft beer here, a good reason to return! 

The decor is more polished, with some neat-o beer related art and a more modern feel to the place than it used to have. The bar area (with video poker) is nice and there are plenty of tables near the bar and in the adjacent dining room. Half price pizza at happy hour is popular, and they have other deals for football games also. A patio area is available, and I would likely take advantage of that next time!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,3,0,4,OBmI1aUQ4J1N6v0xj9p-cw

Ordered a flight of all their Brews. The 2 ales were awesome, very crisp and light for ales. The wheat....um....um...bubble gum flavor was the best way to describe it...redo..
Red and stouts were bang on.. The IPA was close to being great..balance off a bit from the citrus accent...but I'm glad they made it... a little more work and look out ballast point!

Of course the Gilroy pizza is one of the best in town..happy hour $10!!!

Improved the inside of Tenaya Creek, big screens everywhere with something to watch for everyone.
Good job PT'S !!",zBdfduwvbKUy8tnDLAM9Xg,4,3,4,DkiJRXbelwdfVvNO6jjK1w
