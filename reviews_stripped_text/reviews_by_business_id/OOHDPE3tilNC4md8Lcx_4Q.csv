Nestled in a rundown looking strip mall off of Nellis and Harris, it's the United Nations of businesses.  Many nationalities with a touch of racial hate in the form of an WS bar at the end.

Have a good laugh when you see it then have the Crab Rangoon.  You get a plate full of crispy then creamy goodness.  They serve you fried plantains when you sit. The the curries are amazing and the heat scale is on point so if you normally get a 7 you'll want to come down to a 3.

577981,2015-02-04,1,OOHDPE3tilNC4md8Lcx_4Q,"We love Thai foods and it is not easy to find a decent home style cooking when you eat out plus for a reasonable price.  We actually love the buffet so you can try a little of everything and we love it.  One of our favorite is the curry flavor soup with the rice noodle that you can create yourself.  Some people who complained probably are used to the Americanized restaurant style of cooking with lots of over seasoned (salty or sugary) for the taste buds. If you are interested in enjoying a ""like mom's cooking"" this is the place.  We had waited years for a place like this since Tips (another Thai buffet) closed down.  

We truly believe Pan Ocha has much better foods even though the selections is small yet quality and satisfying than a large buffet with mediocre foods.  What make us believe we know good Thai foods?  My husband traveled to Thailand many many times because he worked for an airline and Thailand is his favorite getaways.  For me my ex-mother-in-law is Thai and a wonderful cook so I'm totally spoiled with her home cooking plus I've also been to Thailand.    

Another wonderful thing we love about this place is the services.  We feel like we are  family members because all employees treat us like family since the fist time (we only been there twice so far).  What bothers us when we dine out is when the servers walks away when we barely finish give them our orders.  That is totally rude and unacceptable in our opinion.  Another reason why we love this place and we feel the chef deserve her recognition.  If you don't give this a try you would never know Pan Ocha may be one of your favorite place to eat.

These were all still in my soup so it was awkward pulling them all out each time I took a bite. Also, the mushrooms used in the soup were long, slender, white mushrooms still clumped together.

I love me some Thai food, favorite cuisine of all time. The first time I heard that there was a Thai restaurant in town that had a lunch buffet was Lotus (which has since been discontinued). Also, I heard that the Lotus buffet was just a knockoff of Panda Express. Even more, it was as if a high school cafeteria tried to make Panda Express food. Yea, just like that. But fortunately, Pan Ocha was nothing like that.

I can't remember where I saw the lunch buffet, but it was probably from one of my Yelp buddies. After checking out some of the other reviews, it looked legit, so, I checked it out, and I was impressed.

Even though Pan Ocha is located on the other side of town from me, I am still a big fan of this place. Walking in, they have a similar setup as many of the Indian buffets in town, but it's all Thai food. Pad Thai, chicken wings, noodles, rice, curry, soup, the whole nine yards. I've never had bad Thai food in my life, and Pan Ocha is pretty decent, and the value is incredible.

For the same price as a Indian lunch buffet, you can get Thai food instead. And I would rather drive here than go to an Indian buffet. The only Thai buffet lunch in town, and the food is pretty legit. Big fan!",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,24,21,4,5Dx_ytyqLlIAwgIBY2PT_Q

Homestyle Thai, available as a lunch buffet Mon-Sat from 11AM-3PM, $10/adult, is a bomb deal. The selection isn't huge, but everything is so well done. If you aren't into spicy food, you can rest easy because everything is made pretty mild with additional sauces available on the side. All the dishes are fresh and continually refilled. The larb and beef salad were favorites, and my guy really liked their chicken wings. I do wish the chicken curry were a bit thicker, but the flavors were so well developed that it was only a minor issue. 

This family owned and operated spot is run primarily by an older couple providing the service- they're constantly coming by to check on you, clear tables, and refill drinks.

But my absolute favorite was the penang chicken curry sauce served on the drained rice noodles... Add some bean spouts + shredded cabbage on the rice noodle then top it with this curry sauce; it was simply out-of-bound delicious!!

Ordered a small thai tea ($2) for the road; it came in a 20 oz styrofoam cup which is a good size for me, or you can opt for the large if you are in the mood for $4 which looks at least double in size. I had a hard time finishing it though as I found their Thai tea too sweet.

They also serve a chicken soup, with rice noodles (sen lek) with these awesomely tender chicken meatballs. It is Thai home cooking at its best.

Be sure to try the Kanom Jeen Nam Ya (minced chicken curry sauce served over rice vermicelli noodles). I don't often find it in the US.

At $9.99/ person, it is a great deal...and worth a drive to the East side.

The lunch buffet has a consistent set of dishes, including several starters, soups, and main courses.  The food is always hot and fresh and there's an assortment of Thai spices and seasonings sitting at the end of the buffet so that you can modify the various flavors (and heat) based on your preferences. 

The staff is always very friendly, keeps your drink filled and takes away any plate or bowl that sits too long on the table.  Don't worry though, as it should be with a buffet, there's always a stack of clean plates waiting for your second (or third?) pass through the food.

Note, the older man who works there is very kind and if given the chance will thank you repeatedly for dining there.  Even so, he can be forgetful.  If he's working the register, don't pay until you're ready to go, then don't delay leaving.  He's so kind, but can confuse you with other guests, forget which table you sat at or if you've already paid.  Most recently, as we were leaving, he thought we had just arrived and tried to have someone seat us.  It's okay though, his friendliness somehow adds to the charm and makes you feel like you've joined him in his home rather than sitting at a restaurant.  Be sure to say hello to him.  You'll get to see the warmest of smiles as you enjoy your food.

The storefront is not usually busy and there's never a problem with parking.  Depending on the time of day, the restaurant may be busy, but I've never had a problem getting a seat.  The staff is willing to move tables around if necessary, to ensure you can get in and enjoy lunch.

-The very little amount of rice they gave. It was the amount for like a side dish when rice is the biggest portion of asian dishes lmao. I was running out of rice before the last dish came.
-The mixed veggies in oyster sauce was mostly cabbage and beansprouts. I envisioned plump mushrooms and more babycorn.  
-Som tam laos flavor was okay. My mom felt it had too much crab juice. Id still order it :)
- My mom also ordered beef lahb. I dont eat meat but I tasted it to see if her thoughts were mine. (She said it was too salty, I liked it. I love salty tho and she has gotten picky over the years lol)
My son ordered Pad Thai. Taste good to us. My mom didnt like it. She said it was too sweet #kanyeshrug

But...the owners were so nice. They gave us complimentary fried bananas and refilled our Thai iced coffee. But don't go using that as it is a normal thing lol. It was just something nice they did. Now i feel bad because I'm about to give them 3 stars. I am going to change it to 4 lol. Please give more rice!",nbhr-alrwRnj8hovMuFyEQ,1,0,4,Tyxj4ZqyOkvd5yn4tJaQ5A

Today started off well. They brought some complimentary fried bananas and some other root veggie. I thought they were really good. Reminded me of being a kid.

Tonight we tried a medium yellow chicken curry with white rice, beef pad se ewe, Issan sausage, and their combination rice bowl.

Aside from the free fried bananas the only thing I actually liked was the curry. The only complaint was the onions and carrots weren't cooked enough. The carrots were in huge chunks so they weren't soft. The flavor was really good and I would come back for this. Super flavorful! 

The noodles I thought didn't have much flavor and the beef was kind of tough/chewy. 

The worst part of dinner were the sausages. They had way too much rice in them. There was barely any actually discernible meat. I was really disappointed.

After the first visit and the eh service both times I don't know if I'd ever rush to go back. I only did because my friend said the curry and Tom kha gai was still good.

We ordered Egg Drop Soup, an order of Crab Rangoons, and one order of Pineapple Fried Rice.

It took about an hour to get here which is pretty standard whenever we get food delivered to the dealership, but as the time ticked by I got more and more worried about ordering a hot soup. I thought for sure my soup was going to be ice cold upon delivery.

Not only was my soup piping hot, but the amount of soup they brought for one order was borderline ridiculous, (again, in a good way)! It was more like ten servings of Egg Drop Soup! For the price it was definitely worth it! I could probably feed half the dealership with this one cup of soup and these boys can eat so that's saying something!

The Crab Rangoons were nice and plump! There is nothing worse than a half-assed Rangoon! These were packed full and made with love! Very very tatsy I would defnitely recommend!

My coworker said that the Pineapple Fried Rice was delicious as well so all in all we had a great meal!

4720993,2017-06-30,0,OOHDPE3tilNC4md8Lcx_4Q,"This is the best Thai Food I have had in the Vegas area, hand's down. I am originally from Southern California and the quality of Thai restaurants there is, for the most part, better than Southern Nevada. My wife and I tried well over a dozen Thai places before finding this hidden gem, and now we hardly eat Thai food anywhere else.

This place is pretty authentic. When you first walk in, this place is going to smell a little funky. But don't worry! Those smells are a good sign, as they're coming from the amazing Thai ingredients being cooked in the kitchen. The dining area also looks a little run down, but the lack of esthetics is more than made up for by there amazingly authentic and delicious food.

All their appetizers are great. All their curries are great. All their salads are great. All their soups are great. All there noodle dishes are great.  We've had close to 75% of their menu and loved almost everything. About the only thing we have had here we didn't think was that good is a few Chinese style dishes they offer, but we come here for the Thai food anyway.

Our favorites are the Curries, the Pad Se Ewe (flat rice noodles stir fried with meat and Chinese broccoli), the Lad Nah (flat rice noodles in gravy), Pad Prik King (meat stir fried with green beans and chili paste), and pretty much anything with Thai Basil in the menu. The Basil Chicken, Basil Noodles and Basil Fried Rice are all fantastic. The Thai steak salad is phenomenal, and they have amazing appetizers like Thai sausage and Thai jerky, all of which they make here.

This is a place we always struggle with ordering at, because they have so many good things that we can't decide. We usually end up ordering four or five items just for the two of us and then taking the leftovers home, as we cant let food this good go to waste. Their prices are pretty reasonable to, with almost every dish between $8 and $10.

If you really want to sample their food and want a lot to eat, come here for their lunch buffet. For $10 dollars you get as much of their high quality food as you want, and unlike some places the quality of their buffet food is just as good as if you ordered an entrée off the menu. They have a very good selection on the buffet to chose from everyday, and always have two different curries (they change daily).

We aren't the only people who love this place. We've talked to people who are Thai who have told us this is one of the best and most authentic Thai places in town. Everyone we have ever brought here has loved the food here, including my mother who usually isn't big into ""ethnic"" food.

A warning about their spiciness: this place will make food hot if you want it! Most Thai places I have been don't really make their food that hot, and even ordering spicy level 10 isn't that hot. If you don't like spicy order heat level 0 here, as I love hot food and don't go over 5. At heat level 3 they start putting fresh jalapenos in the dishes, and at 5 Thai chilis. I once ordered a heat level of 8 on a curry here and it was almost hot enough to be a food challenge.

The staff is always super friendly. The chef always comes out to say high every time we are here and everyone here always has a smile on their face.

If you like Thai food, are even just love food in general, you really need to come here and try Pon Ochoa.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,1,3,5,Vh3F4Sz1lhJEl9vSeY-htg

After reading a couple good reviews recently, we decided to try Pon Ocha Soup.  Upon arriving, the decor is almost the same as when it was previously Lao Thai.  The buffet station is still there, and the same elephant tablecloths are still there. 

The menu looks a bit smaller and different, but they were actually able to make the dishes on the menu. (Lao Thai had a bigger menu, but they weren't always able to make certain dishes.)

We had the sausages (appetizer page; I don't know the name), the pork skin with Chinese broccoli, the tom yum noodle soup and the raw shrimp salad (on the a la cart page of the menu).  

The plate of sausages were plenty of food for the two of us.  They were actually better and juicier than before. The pork skin w/ Chinese broccoli was not salty and the pork skin was perfect.  The noodle in the noodle soup was a bit soggy, but it was still very good.  Last but not least, the raw shrimp salad!  Oh my gawd, I could not believe it when the fiance pointed it out on the menu.  Not long after we ordered, I heard the food processor in the kitchen and I knew the wonderful ladies in the kitchen were making the deliciously spicy green sauce for my raw shrimp salad.

It was the last dish to arrive, and it was everything I could hope for!  After eating my fair share of raw shrimp salad in Bangkok (Thailand, that is), I know what it is supposed to taste like, and this is no joke!  Aside from the freshness and the deliciousness of the shrimps and the sauce, they gave us at least a dozen shrimps in that one order!

The service was wonderful albeit the server who seems to have problem with hearing us.  We are definitely going to come back regularly to Pon Ocha Soup and we are happy to have probably the best Thai restaurant in town so close to our home!

One last last thing is their lack of a liquor license, but that's not their fault.  The chef tells us they are waiting for its approval.  Five stars!",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,3,1,5,0PX6aoGXrxPk_QOvYsfgyg

I am a very patient person so we waited another 10 minutes, but he brought our complimentary fried bananas which were delicious. At this point he still hasn't taken our order let alone ask us if we would like something to drink. I go up to the counter to take matters into my own hands and ask the man if I could have a menu and he pointed to where they were at. Once again, I wasn't even upset because I know he was super busy with the regular waiter out delivering food. When we were ready to order I went up the counter once more and he apologized relentlessly about the waiting time because the group of people that came in after us were not patient at all and left, so the man thanks us for staying, he is really such a sweet old man. My boyfriend and I ordered egg rolls, pad see ew, fried rice, Mongolian beef, and their spicy seafood salad. All the food was AMAZING! So worth the wait!! It reminded me of my mom's homemade dishes. We ordered a spice level five on a scale of 1-10 for everything except for the fried rice of course. And boy it tasted around a 9! So be careful if you don't like too much spice in your food. The old man kept coming over and thanking us for staying and that alone made up for the wait!",Zkz-0TzD7JtiD5Te2Ipi_g,2,0,3,gCd3U3U05nW_ZsudJTX6ZQ

Dont let the name fool you however, been to this restaurant three times during lunch and its absolutely great selection for buffet lunch. Have to take the price down a dollar though because their competition in buffet asia have the same price and bigger selection.

But having said that, for thai food in this part of town, its the only place to go. Great service too!

Tip: They have a bomb diggity pad prik khing for those that can handle major chili hotness.",gm20Rasn38z5xdnd7_iM4g,1,0,5,JaJ63waThR0AqNnmv-PSvg

This is a pretty good Thai restaurant located a few miles from Nellis AFB. The service is great and the servings are enough for two meals. I got the yellow curry, and it was the perfect amount of spice! The appetizers are pretty good, and the soups are delicious! The hours are very convenient for those working weekends/late. Lastly, the fortune cookies here are by far the funniest I have seen!",nPok1xbHXYMlGBQbuhN8Xw,2,1,3,kwlZF5KOixpnCNI_eK5TDw
5444045,2018-05-03,0,OOHDPE3tilNC4md8Lcx_4Q,I used to live in Vegas but moved up north to Reno. I used to come to this spot at least once every other week. Now every time I'm in town I always make it a point to stop in for their buffet at least once. I've had Chicken Panang from many different Thai places from all over but this place has the best Panang by far. Plus you can't beat the buffet they offer with many different Thai dishes only for around $10 on the weekdays. It's a hole in the wall place on the sketchy side of town but the food is freaking amazing:),kEnOCl4rVUU2ZdHs1L2NWg,0,0,5,994tcNZUbF_tpJBsno2qAw

I've lived on this side of town for years, and have skipped this place. But, I finally got around to trying this place out, and I very surprised on how good the food is. I ordered take away for an on the go type meal for my husband and I. It was a fast preparation time from our online order. I got the yellow curry and deep fried chicken wings. The curry was creamy, delicious, and had plenty of chicken and veggies, which sometimes at other places I do not get enough of. It came with rice, and some deep fried bananas at no additonal charge. The wings were hot, and tasty which surprised the pants right of me. In total, I spent $17 bucks on a meal that lasted to the next day for dinner, which is not awful at all. It was ALOT of food.
As for the location, if you blinked you could miss this place. It is next to another restaurant and a biker bar with plenty of space to park. The inside is dated, and a bit worn in, but appears clean enough. The staff was friendly and quick to provide service. 
So, if you are on your way to Nellis AFB or simply got lost in this part of town give it try, they may surprise you.",15EfkL69gvmLmrvYGODDqw,5,10,4,bWzCEUQ9q_MEjbEOmH5okA

I believe the elderly woman there was one of the owners, once we sat down she gave us fried bananas and gave us such a huge smile. This place has a homely atmosphere and is so hospitable. 

The food was really good too. We got the level 3 papaya salad and level 3 pad thai, it was so spicy!Although I'm not completely familiar with Thai food, but I'd say this place is still a good place to come back to when you need a fix.",fNN7ouSMYZ4-AQU6Ho-MxA,0,0,5,BPfCwH4wkT0Uto4h-CdAtQ

They have all the Thai staples but of course my go to here is the fried chicken wings and the chili sour chicken wings, you just can not go wrong.  We love the Larb and the mint chicken also the Pad Thai along with several cold dishes and the normal staples, eggrolls, soup.

Forget what I ordered, but it's the round egg noodles, covered with sauce, and came out steaming, stacked high on a plate. Is full of veggies and all sorts of tasty creations! Plus a good among of chicken!
