288438,2017-06-11,0,AwBCgvegeFogpb3lpmpCuw,"This is hands down the best local pizza I've ever had. I'm not trying to say it will beat places like Settebello or Grimaldi's, because I wouldn't really consider those a ""local pizza shop."" Those places are specialty type places, and the prices match that luxury. Joey's has an XL 1-topping pizza for like 12 bucks. Get a pepperoni cooked well done and you will be so happy, you won't know what to do with yourself. Their wings are also fan-freaking-tastic. I would recommend getting them dry with the sauce on the side, but I would always recommend that for to-go wings; it really cuts down on the soggy factor, which I think gives many places an unfair shake. Their ranch is exquisite, and I never get the pizza without it. The mushrooms on the pizza are fresh, and really taste like mushrooms. Ordering almost anything to-go takes them 15 minutes, and I've never had to wait more than a few minutes if they had a rush. Seriously, anyone who doesn't like their pizza doesn't like NY style pizza, caught them on a bad day (which has never happened to me after ordering at least 20 times), expects things from a PIZZA place that you shouldn't (chicken fingers? Go to KFC for that), or should really just stick to places like California Pizza Kitchen. For those of us who like folding their pizza, having excellent quality cheese with excellent quality grease, you can't go wrong with Joey's.

P.S. Look at the pictures; even when people didn't like the pizza, it looks amazing. And it tastes just as good as it looks. Best crust in town, maybe. Seriously.",SeFFcB6yjrcrUDg-EZK9ow,1,0,5,CSBni-kUpAOo8k3NjGd7rQ

About 3 weeks ago,I ordered delivery for the Joey's special pizza, wings and antipasto salad, 50 minutes later, pizza was very soft, soggy and not cooked all the way. Wings and salad were ok.  Decided to give them a 2nd chance and WENT to Joey's, ordered the same thing, thinking that maybe the delivery driver had a lot of deliveries and thus the reason for the soggy pizza last time. Took order straight home (2 minutes) and pizza was even worse than the first time. Wasn't even cooked thoroughly. Waste of money.

1999505,2015-11-22,3,AwBCgvegeFogpb3lpmpCuw,"I was in the area for work and stopped in for a salad- the space is literally a walkup counter with a couple of benches, definitely a takeout-only kind of space. There aren't any pics posted of the menu, and there wasn't one available for me to take, so for a basic overview, they have pizza, calzones, burgers, sandwiches, gyros, chicken fingers/wings, and a ton of apps (fries, fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, etc). 

Oh, and salads- three kinds. I opted for the grilled chicken, and there was ample protein and the portion was large. Priced at $9, the produce was super fresh, and there was a choice of three dressings. The house blue cheese tasted like a low-priced bulk-jar generic, but it was certainly one of the larger, fresher salads I've had at a run-down pizza joint.

Service was friendly and fast. Space doesn't have much ambiance. They have a 75-cent credit card charge. Prices are fairly low and portions across the board seem to be large, based on other orders I saw being picked up.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,7,3,raSsdkmBzWqiYKlDmsIc3w

Well, now the prices for all pizza has gone up to match their prices and they started delivering! So as a consequence, we as a household order from them probably every few weeks, they probably know our dogs by now.  I haven't explored too much on their menu; we generally stick to an XL with pepperoni and black olive with some ranch (we're Las Vegas natives, we rock that ranch and pizza combo :P) and gotta say, whatever supplier they use for their ranch is a good choice. But even the basic sauce is really tasty and garlic-y and they make the toppings worth the price. 
Pros 
 Super tasty and a great size, XL is good to feed about 3-4 adults depending on appetite 
 Fast delivery generally 
 Friendly 
 Consistent and reheats in an oven well 

Cons 
 Antipasta salad is pretty much just lunch meat on a bed of lettuce; it's good lunch meat just not what I was expecting

Almost $30 later we had a Pepperoni Pizza, order of fries and an order of chicken fingers. The fries were a joke! The portion of fries was small for what they said ""could feed a family of four"" and they lacked potato filling it was like eating flat, hard fries. The chicken fingers were nothing more than the same frozen chicken fingers you'd get in a fast food kids meal and they weren't even warm when I opened the box to grab one. The pizza was a huge disappointment with pepperoni unevenly placed on the top, having one side so-so and the other side with very few pepperoni on it. Maybe it all slid to one side during baking I have no idea. The sauce was lacking flavor and the amount of grease this pizza had was just disgusting. The pizza box was filled with grease soaked through as well my plate that had pizza on it. The pizza was so soggy and flopped right away when picking up a slice.

I on the other hand got a cheeseburger actually quite tasty would order it again if I felt lazy and didn't want to cook dinner. Either you like this place or you don't I have had good experiences though . I probably wouldn't order a pizza from the looks of the other reviews though....,TRFWHI2vJzVC9LNIvXHJiA,0,0,4,AQhofVNZk_OsyfY89Lzs1w

They have excellent service too! Everyone who we've ordered from is really cool and the owner seems really sweet. It's not a dine in type of place but it's totally worth it!!!

4415497,2011-08-27,0,AwBCgvegeFogpb3lpmpCuw,"Joey's pizza is thin, hot delicious stuff that always makes my mouth water at the sight of it. It's consistent, fresh, and flavorful. 

Not the best pizza I've ever had - but good enough to make me and my husband pick some up every time we're in the area. The point at which price meets flavor hits the spot - easy on my wallet and yummy in my tummy. 

They have great wings, averagely delicious chicken fingers, and I can honestly say it's the only place my stingy husband will actually purchase ranch dressing on the side.

My family and I are fans of Joey's Pizza.",UcR01xQcUpF0ZqkAvwO2Nw,0,1,4,AJZdeF9vfKJfCqhpmWvEHQ

You get the feeling it's a business that's on it's last legs and desperate to nickel and dime you with inconsistent and unmarked changes to prices and added fees.

4451947,2014-05-12,1,AwBCgvegeFogpb3lpmpCuw,"I was expecting to be giving Joey's Pizza more stars, but based on my husband and I going out of our way to ""try something different"" - that different did not turn out so great.

I've had this place bookmarked because of the good reviews and proximity to my home. There's not a lot on the East Side worth going out of your way for, but some things are really diamonds in the rough. Joey's is not.

Ordered three medium pizzas for $21.99 for take-out. The girl on the phone took my order and repeated it back to me.

1 Pizza with hamburger topping
1 Pizza with ham and mushrooms
1 Pizza with pepperoni and jalepenos

We got two pizzas correct and the other came as a HAWAIIAN pizza. They put pineapples and ham instead of ham and mushrooms. Okay, it's an honest mistake, but I've ordered this type of pizza from Marco's, Domino's, Metro, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasers, and never have any of them eff;d it up. 

Maybe I could over look the wrong pizza, but then when it comes down to it, the pizzas were just ""meh"". The cheese was boring, no diversity, just straight out mozzarella, and gooey-gross messy. The first time around it was okay, heated up the next day it was particularly yucky.

Also - I got a bad stomach problem that night and woke up *ahem* having to go to the restroom. I spent the rest of the night in and out. I decided it must have been the pizza, but my husband did not get sick. Then I decided to experiment and took all the pepperoni and jalapenos off the pizza I ate and had it sans-toppings. I did not get tummy trouble after that.

Who knows - the sickness may have been something else I ate, but considering the meh quality, the wrong pizza, and my late-night bathroom ventures, I will not be ordering from Joey's Pizza again.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,2,AoXudmIigYOwPL6gXvwiDA

My order was one extra-large cheese pie and one extra-large pepperoni pie.  The pies were basically large, not extra-large.  I'm fairly sure they use MSG, plenty of garlic powder and/or other chemical food enhancers.  I know it's cheaper this way but those of us who can tell the difference between real and fake are not being fooled!  Plus the instant headache that sets in five-ten minutes after eating is a dead giveaway!  It's too bad because this is on my way home from work and I would have liked to return but there's no way I'll be back.",gIcpEY34kKVvbHlQJcooQA,3,1,2,e7FculSd-6fnGCS-pPAVkA
