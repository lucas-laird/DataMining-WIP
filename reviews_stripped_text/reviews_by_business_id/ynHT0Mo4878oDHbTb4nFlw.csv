The employee tried to serve me cheese (I corrected her as soon as I saw her heating it up) and argued with me, saying that's what I ordered (I never order cheese) instead of pepperoni.  She did change it but it wasn't very good.  After eating it I wished I hadn't.  Costco pizza is far better.  Skip the pizza here unless it's for a little kid who isn't picky.  Go to Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan if you want amazing pizza.  It's worth the walk.
Next time I'd use my credit for bottled juice or water.  You can't really mess that up.",SGsNdg-Jo3gDLQ7eTxHcTg,0,0,2,86X5RfNdaOQzEQvA1GN2Iw

We went here at 3am for pizza and around 11am for breakfast. Stop by if you're looking for something fast and cheap.",Rc06Six6CF96-EfjgX7rTA,1,1,5,aXiq_Aq6EeV1bSTPg-bGyA

I wanted to see if they can brew fresh decaf and when I asked the guy did it!
Wow! That is very nice service!
And their coffee is not too bad!",8Sdo9NL9imYlVrMx4bh8MA,0,0,5,33ODMzQmpuB3TCuhjrIQlw

I can't say the service was great because everyone looked ready to clock out and go home, they weren't much of the service with a smile type. The cheese pizza I got was terrible, I wish i would've gotten maybe a muffin instead.",FyG557YtTSU9N1LpdREwNw,0,0,1,TYcsI93FuFQu432ow8laKQ

They have a beautiful wood burning oven in the back with a lot of different breakfast selections. They had delicious breakfast pizzas with eggs, sausage, and cheese, muffins, fruits, juices.
 
Also, right across from this eatery are tables and chairs for people to sit and enjoy their delicious breakfast. Right outside of the window there is a nature walk with Flamingos, pelicans, and other wild life animals.",dIHHaoF-yyIvBFEOyEQ8Pw,1,1,4,_gYcA1urc8LMHnz5-1KH4Q
