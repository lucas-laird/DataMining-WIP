We ordered shrimp tostadas and fish tacos,  beans tasted funky though.  The micheladas were ok,  we finished full.  But once we paid and we're about to leave my husband noticed a cockroach roaming through the place.  We were both disgusted!!! We let them know and they acted like it was a ant.

Service is good, food is good but pricey for Mexican, portions are no very big, should include more items for that price.

The ceviche tostadas are excellent, it's provably the only items that is worth the price, portion wise.

1254944,2017-07-20,0,9f68hfHK6gNyHWmt9guiJw,"First time at Mariscos Vallarta, and I'll definitely be back!
Friendly service, and very high quality food.

I don't think that there's a better deal on oysters in town. A dozen for $16 - and they're large and very fresh! They were beautifully briny - like fresh sea water - but not overly salty. Personally, I missed having these East Coast style - with Tabasco and horseradish - but fresh limes made them irresistible

The Fish Tacos were simple, but done well. I would have liked a crispy batter on the fish, but it's a fine line between crisp and overcooked. The chef here errs on the quick side - which does make for a tastier fish overall. 

Here's the thing. For one order of oysters and two orders of fish tacos (with sodas and 1 beer) the bill was $50.  I'm not saying that this was unreasonable for what we got, but it ain't cheap. 

Looking forward to trying the Ceviche.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,1,0,4,ep_vUOMNv7Prm2Fk3T1YRA

1427469,2018-04-09,0,9f68hfHK6gNyHWmt9guiJw,"The food was good. Let me say that. We got a dozen oysters on the half shell done up with the shrimp and fish on it. We got the deep fried fish pieces. We got the shrimp cocktail. But here is where we had problems...
We ordered the oysters with no onions, they came with onions. We did not send them back as we felt bad sending an expensive item back even though one of us cannot eat onions. 
The shrimp cocktail. I ordered a small, even pointed to it on the menu, she brought the large. Only 4 ounces bigger so I thought maybe it was a small? I mean, how do you really know how many ounces it is. I was unsure. Just ate it. Well lo and behold, on the check was a large. So I asked her about that and she said it was a large. So she basically upcharged us there. Y
The only other food item we got was the fried fish pieces. Luckily I remembered that it was $4.50 as I got it a la carte. She charged $5.50. I called her over for that as well and she says, ""oh yea. I will go change it."" So make SURE to watch the bill, people. Maybe it was a new server, not sure. But we went Saturday about 3""30pm. And got more than we asked for on one item and charged too much for a second item and the 3rd item made wrong. So be careful.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,0,0,3,X4HN6CbbBbN_k55rXjScgQ

Yummy, what-taste-authentic Mexican food! 
Husband and I have had :
Carne Asada Plate - grilled, marinated, whole steak - served with grilled onions & pepper, rice, refried beans, side salad and corn tortillas (lotta carbs for one protein LOL) 
Fish Tacos - deep fried white fish, topped with slaw and white sauce
French Fries - ordered with fish tacos, because why not ; crispy on the outside, squishy on the inside - how I like my fried potatoes!
Half Dozen Oyster Vallarta - fresh oysters topped generously with a sort of ceviche, green chile mix and shrimp.

Staff are very friendly, fast, and tentative! Although the couple times we've dined-in I felt like all of them spoke very very little English and I knew very very little Spanish so there was a language barrier trying to order something specific.

The setting can create some hesitancy at first but once you relax and more importantly become enamoured by the deliciousness in front of you, it soon melt away. Maybe it was growing up and traveling down south, but I find some sort of comfort in the plastic utensils, and casual simplicity at times. 
I knew I had made a good choice when all the people eating there were all obvious regulars/family and the steady flow of customers all knew each other. You don't get an ambiance like that from producing sub-par dishes.

My boyfriend is from Hawaii and knows how hard it is to find a seafood place in the middle of the desert that serves FRESH seafood. There is a little girl who greeted and seated us immediately and I thought it was a cute touch to the whole experience. Very good preparadas and cocktails. I ordered the fish tacos which in my opinion were really delicious. Each taco had four pieces of fresh fish battered and fried to perfection. The spicy sauce they bring was really good. The servers and staff are very friendly and prompt to take your order and bring your food out to you. This is his 3rd time being here and my first time. He has tried a handful of items from the menu and says everything is delicious. Good Choice for Fridays during lent.

We also ordered four fish tostadas (I think it was about $12 but it came with a lot) and those were so yummy too, especially with the house sauce and salsa.  But our very favorite thing about the place was the fresh oysters.  They were AMAZING!  AMAZING!!!  We ordered one dozen of the Vallarta oysters ($20) and they were yummy (too spicy for my kids but I really enjoyed it), along with one dozen of the plain fresh oysters ($14 served with lots of fresh lime and the house salsa) and that was the winner!!!  I was surprised that even my five year old couldn't get enough.  We kept ordering an additional dozen and ended up ordering a total of SIX DOZEN oysters.
