Instead of build-your-own, you choose from a menu of different subs offered. I'm sure you could add/subtract items from the sandwiches if you wanted, but I haven't found any need. Everything I have tried is delicious. 
They have a bunch of hot sauces & one of the new soda machines where you can add flavors to everything. (My personal fav are the flavored waters)
Usually they give my son a little plastic fireman's hat, which he gets a kick out of. Definitely check them out :)",LTA6P5uEbK7s0cTcNIPy-w,0,0,5,8DRUKk8F6fKiNdqGmqbOcA

1364374,2012-06-12,3,Fy5D1YcWiGUl7ZelcOiLdQ,"Like real fire stations this chain of sandwich shops are popping up all over Las Vegas, so this afternoon after picking up a ""friend"" from a long working night and driving by one of them we decided to give it a try. It was lunch time so the place was really packed, so packed I'm not sure they were following the maximum capacity imposed by the real firehouse, but this place was really on fire! 
 The outside looked really plain, but when you walk inside it's really cool it looks like a real fire station lots of red, diamond steel, firemen memorabilia all over the walls and Dalmatian color tables which creates a fun atmosphere while you enjoy your sandwich. 
 Sandwiches were good, nothing special that sets them apart from all the other sandwich places except that you can pick your level of fire since they carry more than fifty kinds of hot sauces, chances are they have your favorite (sorry no Del Scorcho).
 My friend was so impressed with the theme, she told me that she should get together a group of her colleagues and start a sandwich chain Just like the group of doctors that opened that other healthy sandwich shops and now this group of firemen opening this chain. I had to tell her and burst her bubble at the same time that maybe it wasn't a good idea  to use her type of profession as a theme for a sandwich shop, I mean.. what are you girls going to call it? Hooker's corner subs?
  All in all firehouse is a good place to take your family and have a good time and good food. The new dial a soda machine is real cool! I just wish people would stop playing with it, Is not a toy! Is a soda machine and that's what all the people behind you want....a soda!
Will I be back? Sure! I kinda like their sandwiches ..unless my friend opens her own place, then I would probably be eating hers.....but for now, any sandwich shop close to my friend's corner is good enough for me.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,2,2,4,R-nxY15nbXRH4FW6fcX3PA

As per this location- amazing. I always go this location as it is convenient and the staff is very friendly. I am always greeted with a smile and ""welcome to firehouse!"" when I walk in. The sandwich is delivered to my table and I am asked every time if I would like anything else and to enjoy my meal. The place is also kept pretty clean including the bathrooms as well. There always seems to be enough staff to keep the line short and the service efficient.

The only negative I would say is that it is a bit pricey. Nearly $7 for basically equivalent size of a 6 inch at subway and that's only the sandwich.

I will definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone.",-038R5cSkXqsYl_bVdT3XQ,0,0,4,IED9ahl7Mi77kb4Dyqa-bA

The staff was friendly and made my sandwich my way. I tried the Hook & Ladder on wheat bread, no mayo.  Price was pretty good, too, 8"" sub for $6. They told me that's their most popular sandwich. Maybe I'll order a different sandwich next time. Generously portioned, I enjoyed it with a dab of their hot sauce. I did appreciate their rack of hot sauces they provided there, numbering each different bottle 1-10 on their level of hot spiciness. Different, don't really find that at sub sandwich places. But the taste of the sandwich still didn't wow me. It was just decent.

2324581,2012-04-27,1,Fy5D1YcWiGUl7ZelcOiLdQ,"GOODBYE SUBWAY! Hello firehouse subs (: 

Came here the other day, based on a friends suggestion. Boy, was she right!

Coming here I didnt have many expectations except that she said they're delicious hot subs, but are  a bit pricey.

I will admit, stepping into the sub shop I was impressed with the firehouse deco. it was very modern, catchy and cute. My year old was impressed and wanted to run around. Um, i dont think so little one! There was fireman gear on the wall and floor. Huge murals on the wall that caught your eye instantly.

It took us a while to decide what we wanted. I was caught between the Turkey, Bacon Ranch sub and the Firehouse Hero sub. Both looked hearty in the picture and i was hoping I wasnt going to be disappointed. Like subway in their commercials theres tons of meat but in person you get only a slice or two. My husband knew he was going to get the beef brisket and cheese sub. Smoothered in bbq, it looked mouth watering. I didn't get it because I knew i could sneak in a bite from my hubs sandwich, hehe. 

Finally at ten minutes I decided to get the turkey bacon ranch. Just the sandwich for 5.79 and added the chili which was another 2.89. Kind of expensive but i had to try the chili if I was going to write a review for YELP, right? 

My daughter got a kids meal which was the grilled cheese, apples and oreo bites. (included drink) I thought that was kind of expensive but when it came I was surprise how big of a portion it was. Enough for an adult in all seriousness. Worth the money. She couldn't even eat it all. It was 5 something if I remember correctly. 

Took a little long to get the food (10 mins) but i waited patiently..

When our food arrived, I was in awe. Worth the wait! The small sandwich was 8 inch. Not like. subway where its 6 inches and I'm left hungry. After eating my TBR, I was left satisfied and full.  There was an enormous amount of turkey on it. I don't know how they do it with food costs but i was impressed. I hate that subway gives you two slices and its wimpy. YUM! Chili was hearty. Lots of beans, onions, celery, tomatos and ground beef. Perfecto. I would def come back for the chili as well. Took a bite of my husbands bbq sandwich and it was very good as well. Not overwhelming bbq sauce and very cheesy. Another great amount of beef. He said he would def get it again. 

We were a little bummed that the 120+ drink machine was out. (the carbone motor broke) But the manager was very nice and said we could have all the bottled soda we wanted. Next time I will absolutely try the machine. Having all those different flavors and options makes you feel like a kid in a candy store

2797484,2012-07-14,2,Fy5D1YcWiGUl7ZelcOiLdQ,"Ok so I finally decided to do this review after going here for the second time. Based on the 4 and 5 star reviews, I was thinking it should be good. NOT! I was thinking since it had some good reviews, my first experience must of been a fluke. After verifying it wasnt, im sorry to report that I am not impressed.

My first visit I ordered the philly cheesesteak. Should be good right? They didnt mess up. Its just the taste. The meat was dry. The peppers and onions were scarce. If it was not for the spicy barbeque sauce I drenched it with, I would have seriously asked for my money back. I thought maybe I was just having a bad day and that my taste buds were not working properly. 

So comes my second visit. It was dinner time about 7 pm. I tried the smokehouse cheddar beef brisket. I had high hopes until I took my first bite. Again the meat was bland and I had to wash it down with their spicy barbeque sauce. I was beginning to wonder why their meat was so dry. When I went up to the counter for more spicy barbeque sauce, I think I found out why their meat was so moistureless. I noticed they store their cooked meat in warmers. Ok now that explains a lot. I figure first thing in the morning the meat should be fresh and flavorful. Thats when I realized my first visit was at lunch time around 11:30. 

Service is good. I love their newer style soda machine. Its just the main product does not tickle my fancy even after giving them another chance. Maybe its just this location. Now if I just happen to try another location and its better, then I will definitely do an update. For now I will look into stocking up on their spicy barbeque sauce.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,3,3,2,dXLZYVw1SSyK4zapk1sSoA

I decided to opt for the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket combo which comes with a soda, choice bag of chips, and a sliced dill pickle.

First off, I absolutely adore the Coca-Cola machine in which you fill your cup. It is one of those electronic touch-screen ones you can find at places like Five Guys Burgers and Fries and Wing Stop, in which you can fully customize your soda with added flavors such as vanilla, orange, cherry, and much more.

With the sandwich, you are given the choice of white or wheat bread which is topped with deliciously moist and tender beef brisket which has been smoked for over 16 hours. Add cheddar cheese, mayo, and savory Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and you have a sandwich fit for the gods. Be sure to eat it quick before you decide to take a look at the nutrition facts!

I got the Turkey Bacon Ranch.  It has smoked turkey breast, bacon, and sharp cheddar cheese with peppercorn ranch to finish it off.  The bread was fresh, the turkey was moist and tender, and the bacon crisp.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  

Service is not bad, they make it when you order, serve it when it's ready, and you self serve your own drink, the place is clean and is more spread out than my first experience, so I didn't feel I was sitting someone else's lap.  With this experience, I will be glad to go back.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,1,4,eILows9PBJR_cx1mnj_gBA
5436962,2012-01-23,0,Fy5D1YcWiGUl7ZelcOiLdQ,Popped in to grab a few subs. I had the Hero and I can't remember the turkey sandwich the wifey had but both were excellent. Friendly service and good food but they could stand to speed up the time it takes to make the sandwiches. About 10 minutes to make 2 sandwiches so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry.,0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,0,0,4,x2JniJwXYJQlXRhfPvYfzA

They are a little more than Subway, but you can taste the difference in the quality of the produce. Their bread is much better, very tasty and you can actually TASTE the tomato. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was a great compliment. All for around 7$, plus a pickle slice! Yay pickles! I want to come back and try some other things now, and get my boyfriend to have one!",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,4,5,4,Ae0FmPR1POc6KuoDUpX0QA

I did enjoy the pastrami sandwich I had and the homemade bread for the bun.  I would definitely return to try the other choices available. The service was friendly and quick but not at the expense of quality. The customer service was a plus in helping with the enjoyment of my experience, bringing our food and friendly conversation

They have an interesting firefighter theme going on. I remember seeing a fire hose, firemen gear, and various pictures in the restaurant. The employees were very friendly and seemed to enjoy working there.

The menu consists mainly of hot subs and maybe 2 choices for cold subs. I decided to go with the medium Club on a Sub: smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, bacon, and Monterey Jack Cheese. They asked if I wanted it ""fully involved"" which was mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pickle on the side. I just asked for mustard and lettuce. Decided to make it a combo with chips and a drink as well. I paid $8.63, which is pretty expensive for a sub meal. 

However, it was a very tasty meal and I enjoyed it! The ingredients that they used were very fresh and my sandwich was still nice and hot when I got home to eat. 

Not that this is an issue to me, but unlike some of the other sandwich chains, you cannot see the employees making your food. You place your order with the cashier and wait until they call out your name. I waited about 5 minutes, although I did go in about 30 minutes after they opened. 

Good sandwiches, but I won't be back very often because of the price. I went to their website and signed up for their newsletters and promos by email, so hopefully they will send out some good coupons!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,0,4,JSFAVrmvcMArglNGxORwjg
