It is almost close to a very good dining experience in China. Do not agree with some reviews in terms of food portion. The chilly whole fish is  actually in very decent size with three free sides. It's completely shareable for two adults. The service is friendly. We had our dinner on Christmas Day there and it became my daughters' favorite meal in Las Vegas, better than other well reviewed Sichuan restaurants we tried. It is only open after 5pm, no lunch.

1352497,2018-05-23,1,yhgOJXJd_XAU-8jIvcfq0g,"Cool bar is located on the Northeast corner of Spring Mountain and Arville, located way in the back, next to a massage parlor. We had decided to come here for dinner after watching a movie nearby at Palms as this was a place that offered skewers. 

Upon arrival, parking was a nightmare. The local bike club in the same plaza had an event which had took a lot of spots. Adjacent places had reserved spots for their business only which restricted the parking even more. We almost opt'ed to park across the street at Macy's/Pt's before we found a spot by American Shooters, but not after waiting for this Asian lady to do a 50 point turn out of her spot going the other direction, backing up parking lot traffic in both directions. 

After finding parking, we had arrived at the restaurant. It had seemed they'd have renovated the place from what it was before with the weird cubicles and definitely not space efficient design. They had converted a good amount of the right side into two private rooms, probably private karaoke rooms, expanded the bar a larger, and changed the seating to normal chairs and tables. 

Their menu is a nightmare! Nothing physically printed, all iPad based pictures, but labeled in Chinese. Pictures were not in any sort of order nor did it seem like the waitresses spoke much English. Luckily, two of us spoke fluent mando, mine is listening only, and the other wasn't even paying attention. LOL.... 

We had ordered a pig ear cold appetizer, chicken gizzard skewers, bbq shrimp skewers, lamb skewers, sausage skewers, corn skewer, duck tongue skewer, chicken heart skewers, and a plate of grilled squid. 

The pig ear cold appetizer was nicely done. Nice and light on flavoring with a mild amount of Sichuan peppercorn numbness. 

Chicken gizzard and lamb skewers were seasoned in a 'Sichuan style' (that's what im calling it) w/ a chili powder and grounded Sichuan peppercorn powder. The numbing effect was definitely STRONG with these skewers, hence why im calling it a Sichuan style vs like a xinjiang style who uses chili powder and cumin. 

Duck tongue was nice. Just beware there is a ""bone"" you can't eat. lol 

Grilled shrimp skewer was seasoned well too but a different seasoning from the other skewers. 

The grilled squid was super soft and tender. Little bit underseasoned but was still good. 

The sausage skewer was pretty decent. It reminded me of longanisa, the Filipino sausage. Plump, juicy, and sweet. It probably is longanisa on a skewer. Lol This sausage is like something you wanna eat with rice. XD 

I mean the food was pretty decent. The punch of numbness from the skewers was unexpected but not something I'd dock rating for. But their menu, omg, PLEASE FIX IT ! ITS DIGITAL ! ORGANIZE IT ! ADD ENGLISH ! Don't know English? use google translate ! D: literally what pissed me off during the meal. ordering should not be this hard D: even if they had a normal menu with items listed all in Chinese only, I wouldn't be this mad. Grr. Lol 

On the bright side, they brought us a full container of ice water w/ lemon every time ours was empty pretty promptly.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,3,rLZlMA3OAoi6Ex-qWNXDNA
1389066,2016-08-29,0,yhgOJXJd_XAU-8jIvcfq0g,"Came here later at night to catch up with a friend. The place is well lit and clean.  Asian karaoke playing in the background

we had such a hard time reading the menu off the iPad.  It's not categorized, they're simply pic stitches of items available as the pictures that other yelpers shared.  Personally, since it's on an iPad, I would suggest to categorize their options for example: folder named Skewers... containing skewer options and folder named appetizer containing other smaller items. Also the menu was not consistent with language. Some photos have English and some don't. I speak Chinese but don't really read Chinese so we almost ordered a garlic flavored fish thinking it's just a mild version of the spicy one (based from the photo shown). Luckily waiters were very friendly and helpful!

Now the food.. The fish we ordered was average. we also ordered the chicken skeleton, duck neck, and squid. Which all had the same flavor, strong in cumin.  I love cumin, but I didn't want everything I ordered to taste the same.

The private karaoke rooms that occupies the half of the restaurant is very well sound proofed! Didn't bother me at all so well done!

In conclusion, not a bad experience. Clean, friendly, average food. I originally wanted to give 3 stars because I truly think they're just average, but decided on 4 because I will return for probably just the chicken skeleton Togo and pick on it while I watch tv at home or something.",dEiKPMxq8wCiGe-fgU0_OQ,0,0,4,Tt7O-9MBqQkx3i-O5DIWGg

The food? Even cooler. 
Was that lame to say? Eh, you get the point. 

Came with some friends after we realized the line at Ichiza was too long. It's tucked away in a small strip of businesses with a large sign you can't miss! 

Once inside you're greeted by a large fish tank and a tall bar (the cool bar, I assume) and an open floor with what looked to be like 2 large private rooms that were taken up by some groups that I think had karaoke inside as well. 

The menu is presented to you on an iPad and you kind of just scroll through and pick out your dishes. It's a little hard with most of them being in Chinese, but the pictures work fine.

We ordered: Chicken Skeleton, Sliced Lamb, and Chicken neck? (I forgot the actual name of the dish) 

Let me tell you, these were some tasty fried snacks for sure! 

The chicken Skeleton is exactly what it sounds like. They deep fry chicken carcasses and dust them in a spicy, flavorful powder that's almost like Old Bay. You gnaw on the bones and it's messy and delicious. 

The sliced lamb was stir fried and had a nice mild lamb taste, not too gamy. It was stir fried with a lot of green onions and the lamb was tender. 

The chicken neck dish was also just tasty little bits to gnaw on. The meat was flavorful and it was fun to pick at the little bones and eat the meat off of them. 

Overall Cool bar is a great place to hang out and socialize and have a great dinner. The service was a little spotty, but the food made up for it.",MzIzsHa1kssFkviGufm-dw,3,7,4,NDMOagfmjZN6aJW7yITMlQ

It was very straightforward and the staff was friendly. The food is fresh and flavorful with the exact amount of spiciness. We tried their skewered dishes and each one that we have ordered are grilled to perfection. 
The only difficulty that I encountered on our Mother's Day visit here is the language barrier that we had with our hostess. Naturally, as first timers, we had plenty of questions but I spent the beginning of my ordering process confused. She was trying to give recommendations and explain the ordering process but we had a difficult time understanding one another. Eventually, despite being still a bit confused, we finalized our order and the rest was history.

Service was good and food quality was good. Menu is ok too. Just a bit too expensive. Also, there are some questionable reviews on this page. There are some accounts with only one review. Consider this when you choose to come here.

2167103,2018-05-03,0,yhgOJXJd_XAU-8jIvcfq0g,"Yum! This bar offers a variety of Chinese food that I have never tried before. We asked them what region the food is from (we thought Szechuan), and it is from a region I had never heard of/can't pronounce to save my life. The food is great. Very spicy and flavorful!!! Definitely order the BBQ Fish. We got the flounder with the spicy sauce. It was immersed in red chili oil and tons of chopped up chilis. You also get to choose three noodle/meat/veggie add ins. We went for the lotus root, Chinese cabbage and enoki mushrooms. To top it off, the entire dish is served in a chafing dish with coals beneath it. Cool bar definitely serves cool food!

The restaurant is very clean and modern. The bathrooms were very nice, which is not typically something I expect from an open-past-midnight restaurant in Chinatown. The menu is on an iPad, letting you scroll through a picture menu since the names are all written in Chinese. There are TV's all around. At this late night dinner, we got to watch a couple reruns of Modern Family. They also have two private rooms with TV's for karaoke. If I lived in town, I would definitely consider hosting a birthday dinner here! Service was fast and friendly. Our waitress gave us great recommendations and kept up with us as we kept ordering more food throughout our meal. 

The grilled squid was just okay. I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. We really loved the skewers, my favorite being the chicken heart!!! It is very tender, juicy and full of flavor.

3129287,2017-02-08,2,yhgOJXJd_XAU-8jIvcfq0g,"For starters, this place needs to invest in English speaking wait staff and also in English translations on their I-pad photo order system.  The menu was particularly clunky, as it has a one by one scroll with both photos of finished dishes and ingredients mixed in with no apparent reason.  The photos were mostly captioned in Chinese, with maybe 5% or so having English translations.  When I asked about individual dishes, the only reply I got was ""beef"" or ""pork"", nothing else.  The waiter tried, he just had no ability to converse with us.  I motioned a waitress over, and she also spoke only bits of English.  The funniest episode was when I asked about a dish photo labeled skewers, he flipped to another photo, pointed and said ""one"" then another photo, ""two"" and then another photo ""three"".  When I said I didn't understand, he repeated the photos and the 1, 2, 3 routine another time.

On to the meal.  My wife was not adventurous at all and ordered wings, as did my son.  The waiter had difficulty understanding ""two orders"" and repeated ""wings"" three times after I said 2 orders, held up two fingers and said one for her and one for him, referring to the other 2 at the table.  15 min later, we got the one order that I semi expected.  There was no sauce provided, and my son wants dips, always.  I asked the lady waitress for some sweet chili sauce, which should be in every Chinese kitchen, and she returned with a bowl of ketchup, no less.  Rice does not come with meals, it is 99 cents extra, a bit of a surprise, since the entree prices seemed to fall on the high end of the scale.

Ok, now on to me.  I thought I saw a photo of short ribs, and another photo of what I thought was oxtail, both in a brown sauce.  I asked the waiter what each was and got only beef, then pork in reply.  Clearly I was on my own.  I thought I selected the ""short ribs""---which turned out to be pork belly.  I also thought I only picked the one entree, yet here comes the other one (oxrail, I thought), which turned out to be sautéed pigs feet,  I didn't make a fuss, as I have never tried that particular item, also because I expected my son to try some, and also I had a Groupon.  The pork belly dish was fine.  They sautéed the pork rather than braised it, which left much of the fat in the pork and it left the skin mushy rather than crisped.  The pigs feet were about 75% bone and not at all pleasant tasting.  I took 2 tastes, ate the baby boy choy and called it a night.

This falls in the never again category.",NBhDx8iEnVmxO27oMHt5kg,4,5,1,2owsxgym2a06MsgloNv1MQ

4632026,2016-07-29,1,yhgOJXJd_XAU-8jIvcfq0g,"Went there this afternoon. The owner definitely put lots of efforts redone this restaurant. It looks completely different that the one before. High quality furnitures & decors, private party rooms, big LED TV screens in general area & private rooms, e-menu, etc.
We ordered mixed seafood pot, cucumber cold dish, dumplings, lamb skewers, bbq steam bread slices, fried sweet potatoes & fried chicken wings. Liked everything we ordered, especially the lamb skewers - very delicious 
The service was really tentative. She noticed our dumplings were little over cooked (some were broken) & shorted 2, and brought us a new dish, even though we didn't even notice the issue.

Definitely come back more often :)",1GMwr7IYO7jY_JOS3cKF7g,3,1,5,kY_tDxovE7sPYVPG3xVh6Q
4843178,2016-09-03,13,yhgOJXJd_XAU-8jIvcfq0g,"Located on the seedy side of Spring Mountain, I didn't have high hopes when my boss suggested Cool Bar for a business dinner. (For out of towners, the north side of Spring Mountain between Wynn and Arville is like the black sheep of the family. You got Play It Again Sam, vacant lot that offers car wash and a body shop that insists on leaving that hideous crashed up mini van as marketing material right out front.) 

Situated in the very back of the shopping center as you entered from Spring Mountain, you will be too astonished with the condition of this shopping center and yet the variety of eateries available here before you realized Cool Bar is literally right in front of you. You really can't miss it; the sign is relatively huge. 

From the outside, the windows are all blacked out and you wonder which one is the entrance. Hint: It's the one with the door handle... 

They have a bar to the left and then this big space with about eight to ten tables. The garlic smell is unavoidable and you know you're going to reek of garlic-y Chinese food smell later but you don't care because you know it's going to be worth it! (Note: they serve northwestern Chinese dishes here that use tons of garlic, red peppers and cumins. If that's not your thing, stop reading now.) Then they also have two private rooms to the right. 

We dined in one of the rooms and it was like we were back in China, in a good but strange sort of way. One thing being the room is huge; it was easily  a 200 sq ft room. Second, they use fluorescent lightbulbs just like they love to in China. Third, there were two gigantic TV mounted on the wall with Chinese karaoke playing in the background. There was also a table that can easily seat eight on one side of the room and a seating area on the other side of the room.  

Everything we had was absolutely amazing and I must preface that some of these dishes were specially  ordered and aren't on the menu because my boss knows the owner (but really, it's Vegas. Someone always knows someone. I digress.)  Here goes. 
Cold dishes: 
Pickled cucumber
Marinated beef tendons (not on menu?) 
Marinated sliced beef
Pickled wood ear (Google it; it's basically fungi) 

Hot dishes: 
Chicken skewers
Lamb skewers
Shrimp skewers
Bun skewers - my favorite item of the evening!! It's basically steam bun grilled with a garlic jam... Heaven. 
Peppers beef steak cubes - notably good
Grilled salmon hot pot (special request for the salmon; they usually use some sort of cod, I was told.) A huge pot of salmon on top of a bed of glass noodles, tofu, tofu skin and lots of dried red peppers, all while continually cooked with charcoal on the bottom of the pot.  The flavors were appetizing and the noodle counterbalance the strong taste. Fish was done just right but that's because my boss is wise and asked to remove the charcoal pan soon after it arrived so the salmon doesn't overcooked, which is very easy to do. 

I know I missed a couple dishes but these should be enough to entice you to try Cool Bar. The service was also great. The servers are cute young Asian women who chewed gum when they thought no one was looking, but that shouldn't deter you from going. In fact, quite the opposite, I'd imagine.  So yeah, Cool Bar is cool!",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,28,19,5,TiKbqY2CaKxnuNRmmBhRaA

I am speechless with their great food and an excellent service. This is not your typical Chinese restaurant because it has a ""cooler"" vibe. Very nice ambiance. You would literally spend hours in this place. Thank you so much to the staff! My hubby and I really enjoyed our dinner here tonight.

  We already tell you we don't know!And we always come here when we get together. That's the way you treat customers?  So You wanna some compensation?You need check your facilities rather than blame customers.",X639TmkVB_vzg5ZhiUdhMw,0,0,1,Qo5BL_gql1mjzEyhBIMqSw

Had an amazing spicy BBQ fish dish, amazing chicken wings to die for, and some of the best spicy steamed clam dish, and also mini fried Steamed Bread with dipping concentrated milk.  

Also to cap the night we had the use of a huge karaoke room.  They did a great job with the Karaoke System offering complimentary Karaoke when reserving the private dining room.
