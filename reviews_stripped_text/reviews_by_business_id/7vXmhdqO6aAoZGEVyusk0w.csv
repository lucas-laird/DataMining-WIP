222457,2017-07-13,0,7vXmhdqO6aAoZGEVyusk0w,"This place is a great hole in the wall away from the strip that serves great food. It's a spacious, clean and nicely situated locale. The food servings are large and for decent prices. Their chips are not free but worth paying for. They're freshly made so they are brought warm to the table and seasoned deliciously with chili powder. You order at the register and the food gets brought to the table. The salsa bar is also delicious and spicy. Very authentic Mexican food that is worth leaving the strip for if you're looking for something delicious, casual and at great prices.",xJJ2_oLlJmR7jWzLmDr9DQ,0,0,5,HyorKq-BESFLqO4YXd89rQ

1637644,2015-08-13,0,7vXmhdqO6aAoZGEVyusk0w,"I had the carne asada and carnitas tacos. They were both very good. Typical street tacos. The salsa bar is great with 3 or 4 salsas, guacamole, pico, grilled peppers, limes, radishes, etc. It was quick and easy to order a couple tacos to go. The breakfast menu also looked really good. My only complaint would be the price. Tacos were $2.75 each and pretty small. If they were $2.00, 5 stars for sure. I probably will still go back.",2ENYnoAK-OUshFsilqHKoA,1,0,4,NIeN2pw-joKcwEH2SJgOIw

2047203,2015-12-16,7,7vXmhdqO6aAoZGEVyusk0w,"Decent lunch spot in DTLV. 

Restaurant itself is always clean and the cashier and cook are always very friendly and courteous. 

So far, I've tried the chicken, steak, carnitas, and barbacoa tacos, they're all equally delicious, but beware, barbacoa tends to make the tortillas soggy so if you order an assortment of different meats like I do, eat the barbacoa first.

I always go with the taco special they have, which is a great deal. 4 tacos with beans, rice, and a drink for $8.99, service is always fast so I never have to wait long to receive my food, which is always a plus considering I only have a one hour lunch break. So if you're in the hood, definitely give Taco Rico a chance.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,16,13,4,PUAhwCqYZCfdKVdfPUEbaw

It is in a very hidden area but don't let that scare you away. I had their taco combo wish includes four tacos,beans,rice, and a drink; all for $8.99! That's a deal.

My wife and I fell in love with the taco special definitely bang for your buck. I tried the Tostada, and it was huge! definitely finished it with some regret (couldn't walk after) . The rice was great and the beans especially were cooked right, felt like mom made them at home. the staff is very friendly and made you feel at home. Gotta say this place gave me something to look forward to for my next trip to Vegas. keep it up and good luck.",bxXuZGddSnKGyyBVbOWZNg,0,0,5,gaR8VZjEueysjzr-U0JwwA
4147085,2016-07-15,2,7vXmhdqO6aAoZGEVyusk0w,"I am so torn on giving Taco Rico a 3 star rating. The are so many strong reasons I should rate it higher. As others have said, this place is very clean. That is refreshing to see from a little taco shop like this. The service was friendly. I was updated when my order was taking a long time to fill. I was given a free sample of an agua frescas with cucumber and spinach. I was offered a refill on my soda. All points to the positive. 

More points to the positive is the quality of the food. They make everything fresh. My tacos were alright. The meat was hot and perfectly cooked. The refried beans were on point. The rice was about the best I've had. It was full of flavor and fluffy. Even the various salsas were quite good. The one I had, roasted I think, was not too hot but gave a nice flavor boost to my tacos. Salsa was not 100% necessary but a welcome edition for sure.

So why am I giving only a 3 star review when everything is so good? Well, there is more to the story. I was picking up lunch for my office. I ordered a total of 6 combo number 1s. That combo comes with 4 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. Yeah, I had my hands full with this one. Anyhow, we all wanted a variety of tacos. Carne asada, pollo, al pastor, carnitas. We wanted it all. Nobody ended up getting al pastor. Taco Rico didn't have any made. So I made the decision to switch to the carnitas. I got all of the first 5 orders placed and was ready to place my own. I was going to try asada, pollo, carnitas and barbacoa. I ended up with two each asada and barbacoa because I was told they would not give me all different meats. They claimed it was too much work to make so many different tacos with different meats. That was disappointing. So was the fact that their credit card terminal was not working so I had to bum some cash off a co-worker. This was supposed to be her birthday lunch. She was not supposed to pay. 

To further my disappointment, it took nearly 50 minutes to get my full order. 50 minutes! Apparently 11:00 AM is too early for lunch because I had to wait for much of it to be cooked. That includes the rice. Meanwhile my co-workers were back at the office getting more and more hungry. All but the one co-worker that is.

My assistant in this lunch venture, whom I am happy went with me, was a great help in translating everything. The cashier spoke English but I think it was easier for her to speak Spanish. It bothered me a little bit when she started ignoring me and speaking directly to my companion. Whatever. I got the message. It may have been second hand but I felt well informed. 

In the end, the service was friendly, the food was fresh but average, the tacos are small, and the beans and rice I could have used more of. The delays and frustrations of limitations are just too much for me to overlook. That is why this is a 3 star review today.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,5,4,3,Y_fEGcq_fuxRDGTDTkeNAQ

Sometimes Tacos el Gordo is just too freakin' much. It's also clean. The smells coming from the kitchen are delicious. There is a small salsa bar with everything you need. No frills, no gimmicks.

A kind young man came out from the kitchen to take my order- a breakfast burrito with asada. They didn't have potatoes so we subbed for French fries- Cali burrito style. Fast and fresh.
