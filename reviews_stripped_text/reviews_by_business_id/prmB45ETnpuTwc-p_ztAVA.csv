198505,2017-08-24,0,prmB45ETnpuTwc-p_ztAVA,Probably the best sandwich shop I've ever been too. Prices are very reasonable. Every single sandwich I have ordered has flavorful meats and fresh vegetables.,3_LSeDbO9-3-3eYx-RMrAQ,0,0,5,6Cj1z1WQLL0TV_s9HS773Q

I ordered the oven gold turkey sub (hoagie/hero), with a whole pickle and potato salad, and I have to say, the sub was fresh and tasty. The seasoning they use is delicious. And, they use Boars Head cold cuts, which in my humble opinion, are the best. The potato salad is fantastic, it reminds me of what I used to get when I lived in New York, very flavorful. And being able to get a whole dill pickle is just a bonus. 
There are many places where you can get a sub/hoagie/hero, but Woods Family Sandwiches is a legitimate ""NY style"" sub shop on the Eastside! 
Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.",6VU0rNcA03q5ef2s_sLKXg,2,1,5,-TSaZJ9CODbEXHTHttmrAA
1083961,2018-04-14,0,prmB45ETnpuTwc-p_ztAVA,"When I got there was quickly greeted and confirmed I was there for a pick up. Got the 9"" classic Italian with a house made potato salad, salt & vinegar chips, kosher pickle and I said what the hell I'll try the Italian ice thingy they have for dessert. All together was $19 and some change which wasn't too bad because I shared it with my girl. 
Such a simple yet well put together sandwich. I love sandwiches and this one seems to be packed with flavor. I guess it's because they only use Boars Head high quality meats & cheese, but either way this place has become a favorite of mine.",E7yc9-Z7ewSgtogwie4z6w,0,0,5,gPODPd8YEuyLMpjE8FwDCw

1711466,2018-03-27,0,prmB45ETnpuTwc-p_ztAVA,"Yum! Turkey sandwich was delicious! Loved the pickle, too. Potato salad was just average in my opinion. A little pricey overall, but the sandwich was worth it. The turkey was cut just perfectly and tasted awesome! We first tried to visit on Saturday at 2:30pm... Yelp had their hours listed as being open until 5pm on Saturdays... the door at the restaurant said they were open until 3pm, but it was all locked up at 2:30pm when we got there. Not sure why, but just wanted to note that in case it helps others. We ended up going back on Monday and like I said the sandwich was great so I'm glad we did. Will definitely be back when we're back in town.",nI8RBIfeplRlIqlCqCAZIg,0,0,4,TuyyMG9kusAXMuV5cNhRGw

The meat is excellent! I had the hot pastrami with everything on it. It's the best pastrami I've ever had. The xheese has a little bit of a spice but not too much. The meat it top quality. I could only eat half of the 9"". The left over is dinner I guess lol typically not a fan of hot sandwiches but this one was bomb. The bread after toasting was crunchy on the outside and still soft on the inside. Bought a 9"" turkey for my kids and they split it. My 4 year old said it was the best sandwich he has ever had, but then again he's only 4 hahaha. Got a 9"" Italian for my husband, no tomato no onion. He would have preferred to have more of the oil vinegar stuff on it but other wise he liked it. He also didn't think the jalapeño chips were spicy at all but my mouth was burning lol we will be coming back for my FIL to try the French dip.",uusdsS9tvdu8z8VkJn5h-g,0,0,4,8rzRS7ycgehWxYQGOaeJtw
1976662,2017-08-23,9,prmB45ETnpuTwc-p_ztAVA,"Woods Family Sandwiches has done so well for themselves in Henderson that they've now opened a new location on the East side! Specializing in Boar's Head meats, cheeses, and spreads, the sandwiches come on fresh French rolls in 6 and 9-inch lengths or your choice of a wrap. Salads, soups, and sides round out the menu.

Bread is nicely soft, protein is generously portioned and high quality per the brand's reputation, and the combination of flavors on the Blazing Buffalo Crunchy Sub (buffalo turkey, crispy fried onions, lettuce, and bleu cheese spread) worked well together. Definitely spring for the larger size, as a buck more gets you 50% more sandwich ($6.99 vs $7.99). 

Breakfast, combos and daily specials are available. There is no shortage of sandwich options in this area, but the value and service (family-owned and friendly) make this spot stand out.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,15,4,cFCZrdh32IdeOX_V0wY14Q

French Dip
Grilled Cheese x2
Turkey Pesto + chips, drink combo

I was really concerned that the grilled cheese sandwiches would arrive hot, but the kiddos insisted so I took a chance.  To my pleasant surprise, all of our food arrived piping hot!  The grilled cheese was yummy (cheddar cheese and high quality at that).  I had the turkey pesto and I would order it again and again given the chance!  My only regret was not ordering a pickle with it because that would've been so delicious with it!  My sister in law enjoyed her french dip as well.  Overall, very happy with the food and I can't wait to order from them again!",Jdx_u3PxmXLCOyP_Pkn7Sg,2,0,5,yEPsftnzg1omz8J2mdAQBw

We waited a while for a cashier to attend us . Ordered the turkey pesto sandwich (only comes in white bread if you order the 9"") ordered that to split,  a salad and a tomato Bisque soup to add warmth on this rainy day . The meal came to $21 ...the sandwich was really good there was a lot of turkey meat in it and pesto sauce . The Tomato Bisque was really watery I tossed it . The place itself was small and there were product boxes on the hallway . Next time I would just order to go and skip the soups .",Bim-SoK8wItqFC5NqnN_Sw,5,4,3,FPnRp3ESzrvV_2wo1QzuCw

Second, don't show up at 4pm on a Saturday, while 38 weeks pregnant and craving anItalian hoagie and a giant pickle, because if you do, you'll be disappointed when you realize their yelp page and website says they're open until 5pm on Saturdays but when you get there, they're closed and the door says they close at 3pm on Saturdays

3849636,2017-09-17,5,prmB45ETnpuTwc-p_ztAVA,"This new location was more convenient as I was on my way back to my hotel room at Westgate after a round of golf in Henderson.

Obviously, they wouldn't be opening a second store if they did not have success and a loyal following at the first one.

Because the reviews were so good, I ordered two sandwiches: One for lunch and one for later since it is always cheaper to bring food back to The Strip than order it there.

The Italian wrap was excellent. Just the right amount of everything in there. And each half of it is a meal in itself. The Italian seasonings and dressing were perfect.

As an openly self-professed chicken salad apologist, I had to try Woods' version. There was nothing wrong with it at all, it just was not anything really special in terms of the taste and texture. I even added bacon to the chicken salad sandwich hoping to be awed, but it just didn't happen.

Perhaps that Italian wrap set the bar too high?

The ingredients were clearly fresh and even their cole slaw proves that on the very first bite.

Pricing seems very fair across the board and employees were clearly enjoying their jobs while making me feel very welcome on this initial visit. 

Let's try a couple more things from Woods Family Sandwiches on my next trip to Vegas.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,7,6,4,GDYstv3r0QKaT3xzEzZE8w

Also, their staff is friendly/informative and the above mentioned chicken salad is AMAZING.

Their prices are proportionate to the quality, which I'm absolutely ok with.

I arrived late at 430pm because closing time is 5pm so I was bummed their soups were not available. I still ordered the pastrami sandwich with a hoagie and a classic Italian sandwich adding turkey, beef, sprouts and mayo on both. My favorite potato salad is a must to complement the sandwiches. $27 out the door.
