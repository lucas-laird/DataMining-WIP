We get different cashier at the window and they are all good and professional. As far as the location, yes there are homeless but so what? Theyre not the one making your burgers!",muh8JTHbJXnr0pu-4FVQ3A,1,0,4,KrCMtUg0CMnpR3CPofxKxw
1811974,2014-10-03,0,wNI7ys7fe58Xn1TnM9mFyQ,"This is the worst Burger King I have ever experienced. The vagrants camp out inside and out all day and hours of the night. They beg for money outside and sit around inside with carts and bags full of filthy dirty stuff, piling it on the tables and seats inside. They camp out near the doors outside and it's impossible to get in or out without them right in your face. The cashiers are always nice but there is not much they can do since they are working inside. Management/Ownership needs to step up and help with this issue that's causing a nuisance in the surrounding residential neighborhood.",DTGmE0ldFDrkXZM_UPfFRg,1,0,1,zCmM9Wz5eDh3H_9169B-RA

I come to this Burger King very very often but now I'm going to find somewhere else to eat because when I was inside the resteraunt ordering food today, the manager was extremely rude shouting across the store (making all the customers uncomfortable) at a homeless man for filling up a cup he brought in himself saying she would call metro and even turned off the soda machine so all the CUSTOMERS had to ask in order to get a drink. Then about 10 minutes later another homeless man that she seemed to know came in and she turned on the fountain for him and let him fill his own cup. Not only did I see horrible worth ethic but but almost every single table was dirty and the place just looked trashed on the inside. Now that I know the morals of the people who work here I won't even be going through the drive again.",YsS9rEcXH8eZz5hAiWK5yA,1,0,1,uAtFcn6-HStXiV6LAGDAgw
2689648,2018-06-30,0,wNI7ys7fe58Xn1TnM9mFyQ,"This location is terrible. It is the first and only time I will come here. I decided to dine in. Mistake. The girl who took my order was CLUELESS. I wanted an original chicken sandwich and a drink. In the window is a large promo poster offering Frozen Coke or Fanta for 1.00. I get to the register and order one and she says, they are actually 2.00"". No explanation as to why. I order my sandwich and tell her I want a 16 oz drink(1.29). She rings my order in and gives me a high total. I question it. She rang in the wrong type of drink. We finally agree on the more reasonable total of 5.56. I give her 6.00 cash and she looks at me and says, ""do you want your pennies?"" WTH? I say yes and I am pondering this as she puts change in my hand. It was supposed to be .44 cents and she gives me .08. Over it. 
   ***Update before I leave. Another lady came in and ordered/got the 1.00 Frozen Fanta. I walked up to the counter and explained my poor customer service experience to another employee. She gave me a comp drink to make up for the hassle. They are quite yummy.*******",LZpiU5tTxGrnbRor_rPDRQ,0,0,1,BUbUbpBdtbNxHGAVewRojw
3236140,2016-12-13,1,wNI7ys7fe58Xn1TnM9mFyQ,"This place is right down the street from me. It shares a parking lot with a 99 cent store and there's a grocery store across the street and a Mexican restaurant a couple buildings down.

The dining area is clean and yes, there are many homeless people that come and frequent here and hang out...That doesn't really bother me like it would others, to me they're still people and I've never seen them pan handle or harass me for money. If anything, I've offered to buy food in the past for others.

The workers are not very engaging and lack wearing a smile.They look like drones who are there too ""do time"" and serve food.

The rest rooms are locked and offered to ""customers only"", but if you ever get to use it - the staff don't bother to keep it clean. It's locked and kept dirty other than the opposite where it should be clean, why even bother locking it in the first place - it's redundant.

I still enjoy my burgers, I've never had a bad experience where my order was wrong...the drones get it right for me every time.

It's amazing this place is still operating knowing that it lacks customer service and employees who are not passionate. If you just want to eat and leave....this is the place to go...if you want good customer experience...shop at Zappos or go to another burger place that you like...

Service dogs are allowed everywhere!!
The manager seemed not to care either way!

Thought it will be quick to order and get the food.
All I can say it's HELL NO so wrong.
Took me 20 min to get my food from the time I ordered. The lady didn't looks like she enjoyed her work or maybe she just tired?
