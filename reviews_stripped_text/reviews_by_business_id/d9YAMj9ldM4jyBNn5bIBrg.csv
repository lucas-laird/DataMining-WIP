548253,2015-09-27,0,d9YAMj9ldM4jyBNn5bIBrg,The prices are about average for Las Vegas but would be considered expensive elsewhere. My wrap tasted burnt. A friend ordered a salad but his vegetables were wilted. Even Subway has better sandwiches for less than half the price.,L7EzQe0CVRjiAuClL1mOqg,0,1,2,iabgE8T0Z83kArkzTcS-og
1320012,2014-07-07,0,d9YAMj9ldM4jyBNn5bIBrg,"I feel disheartened to give "" LA Subs "" a mediocre review due to the 5 Stars they have gotten below. Myself and my friend decided to try their food out last night. I ordered the chicken mozzarella with pesto sauce no tomatoes panini. My friend ordered a bacon Sandwich with no cheese. Both meals made both of our stomachs feel not the best afterwards and now this morning I'm still feeling ill. I didn't eat the other half of my sandwich either. The taste was meh. Nothing I couldn't do better and if I can top it then that's scary. Hoping we just had a bad experience and if we try it again it'll be more satisfying with zero tummy ache.",_pWsCLARNeUTObsBGTmvVA,0,0,3,d414IV9lMHRQcwda1AD9KQ

My sandwich was big enough for 2 people and was tasty. Will try a different one next trip.",jAmjEhz_DINx8M3LlTjTjw,0,0,4,tc3UyORSoTHIU3lShQ1Lcw
1519729,2013-06-16,2,d9YAMj9ldM4jyBNn5bIBrg,"Healthy alternative to the regular fast food offered at your normal food court. Located within the Luxor Hotel and Casino...right by Starbucks and across from McDonald's. 

Friendly and quick staff. Lovely service! The menu selections include freshly made sub sandwiches, wraps, grilled paninis, and fresh fresh tasty salads. With each order, you can decide if you want a side of fries or small salad for an additional cost. Also offered is the premium deli meats and cheeses sliced right in-front of you!

Wish this establishment exists in Hawaii as their food tastes amazing.",XlQB8G8MeeKJ3Z0FHntzDw,7,2,5,-FFu5nVKqzJPxctgXgmA3Q

I found it odd it was toasted, but it was fine and didn't make it too greasy or heavy; it actually added a nice crispy texture to the outside. Definitely a good healthier option than pizza, McDonald's, etc. in the food court.",YORBk-9pWIz7xPVWRUizIw,0,0,4,nknrJU13TI5Xy1skO9PUcQ

4877752,2018-04-21,0,d9YAMj9ldM4jyBNn5bIBrg,"Was wandering around the nooks and crannies of Luxor and hadn't been by the utility Food Court in awhile (the McD actually closed! Replaced by a chicken strip specialty place - not a Chick-fil-a, a local copy.) 

Saw this one expecting another Subway franchise, but behold, it's a decent hoagie/grinder/sub/salad alternative. Strictly speaking, the closest thing to LA would probably be its proximity to the city, as you won't find micro-greens or beet hummus on this menu. 

But I did find fresh French puffy and crunchy rolls (white and wheat), sliced to order meats, and they can panini grill anything (even if it's not a panini)
Skin-on fries are also made to order. 

Looks like MB mgt. addressed any service issues mentioned a few years ago, as this is one city where the competition is so fierce, they have no reason to keep problematic vendors in place. Service was courteous and thoughtful, and would be a great catering choice for a sports party, or any grab and go occasion.

Up on the 2nd floor floating level tucked behind the museum exhibition, LASubs works for a daytime alternative to the otherwise pretty heavy fare found in all the other nearby venues, including the Shoppes at the MB.

During the week, you may find lots of school age kids here at the food court, as the museum is a popular field trip destination. But that's life growing up in Las Vegas - going to casinos for Sunday brunches, or to view worldly exhibitions is a unique part of being a kid here (technically in Paradise, NV - you learn that in State history class here.)",drWfMOm_UDEMAzAuYqDE1Q,0,1,4,sknOAb2tghSkzeMcmIVe2w

5667153,2015-11-03,0,d9YAMj9ldM4jyBNn5bIBrg,"This place is honestly gross. We were just hungry walking by, and an Italian Sub seemed like a safe order... Literally worst one I've ever had. You can tell the meat quality is cheap, and the bread had no flavor. People working here were nice, but the eating area seemed dirty, even saw a random fruit fly on the table. To be fair, I suppose that could have came from one of the other restaurants nearby. Don't go here, trust me. I live in L.A., and I've never seen one of these place back home!
