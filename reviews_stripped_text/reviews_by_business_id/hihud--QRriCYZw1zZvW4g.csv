18712,2015-12-11,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Updated review:  We celebrated my sister-in-law's birthday here last night.  None of us have tried this place.  We were really impressed with the food.  We loved the side dishes, especially the squid. Right behind our booth, someone else was celebrating their birthday and the staff sang a  birthday song and gave him/her a complimentary dessert.  So we had to tell them it was my sister-in-law's birthday also.  Our waiter assured us she would get a dessert too.  On the corner of our booth, I was excited to see that they give a free dessert if you rate them on Yelp  at the time of the visit.  It was a limited time offer so I wanted to take advantage of that. I showed the pictures to my 4 year old nephew and as soon as he saw the colorful macaron ice cream, which he called ""ice cream burger"", he asked for it right away.  I had to coax him to finish his food first  before we  get him the free ice cream.  He agreed and waited so patiently for it.  While everyone's eating, I downloaded the Yelp app so I could rate the restaurant and get the macaron ice cream for my nephew.  I followed the instructions and gave them a really good rating based on the food itself which was a 5 star for everyone.  I got up to use the restroom and asked my husband to show the review to them (as required). However, when I returned, my sister-in-law's complimentary dessert  was already there.   They didn't sing her a song either. It, unfortunately,  wasn't what my nephew had been waiting for. Our server told us that they would only honor one.  I'm not upset about not getting the free dessert cause we could have bought him one right there instead.  For one, it was already late. I just  didn't want to see my nephew disappointed.  We'll just buy him one in the morning from somewhere else.",ruhfDNFukUyiO-HmOW6p0Q,0,0,4,9oFOB3lMEwIJ6RrQxST--w

25920,2016-02-12,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"I was very puzzled at how this place can get a 4.5 stars until I saw on the ad on the dining table that you get free desserts if you review on Yelp. That explained the rating well for me.

I would have given it a 2 star if it was located in LA. But I believe different city should have different standards especially with Asian food. 

The food itself wasn't that bad , it was random. The brisket definitely was the worst I ever had in any k bbq place. It was thick and watery.  Steam egg = 1/10.  Fried yakisoba = 2/10 - the noodle was edible , but the beef was not.  However to be fair, the other meat plates were good, especially the prime rib - one of the best I ever had in kbbq. 

Now the service. There was no service. Never refilled our soda, never attempted to change our grill plate despite it being totally unusable, and I saw they saw how dirty it was, but they just passed by! If it was back in LA, the plate would have at least been changed 3-4 times. 
 
So all in all, will never go back , and won't recommend to anyone who truly enjoys kbbq.",isUmAoLoZu_A6yDF6W2wcQ,0,0,3,rBf2XOjkBR6u93_LtQQ43w

45124,2017-07-10,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Very disappointed with our experience at Gangnam last night.  We were a party of seven and before our six and seven were seated the waitstaff were already trying to take our order.  We were then persuaded by the waitstaff to order the 'Meat Lovers' combo for six which they informed us comes with three servings of each meat.  Two servings of meat later our grills were turned off and the dessert menu placed in our hand.  We informed the waitstaff that we were expecting another serving of meat but we were quickly shrugged off and informed that we received our three servings and that they were split among the trays on either side of our table.  Problem is they never brought the second tray with our third serving of meat.

Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere that does all you can eat with better pricing and doesn't try to swindle their customers.",1f1i8zB2XKjERlKQGT_ukg,0,0,1,xXweDzZxJITBKiG3NwRiDg
46565,2016-07-12,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Intrigued by all these yelp reviews, I decided to come forward and see what the hype was all about. I love korean bbq, I love japenese bbq, but I've never tried both at the same time. Where to start?

Staff was nice, only took about 7 1/2 minutes in between to refill my water from when it was empty and full. Ordered that $70 combo meal with a side of pork belly.

Sauces came out and dropped off with no description, but thank god for having taste buds I were able to figure out what each sauce was.

Meats came out before all the appetizers, and I guess raw oysters were to serve as my dessert? Lol.. The filet mignon did not go well with my raw oysters, as well as my super sweet and sauced up bibimbap. Teriyaki sauce galore I guess.

Meat quality was probably close to tofu hut which would of been nice if they had a $10 AYCE.


House salad was meh, soup was meh meh, everything meh. Granite the staff was nice and lagged on getting stuff for us, like water, dropped chopsticks, and napkins and all that. No biggie I'm asian, I'm use to eating with my hands.

I normally don't like to bash on businesses but I feel like this place has gotten way more love than they should. All the 4 or 5 star ratings might have come from drunks or people with no taste buds.

I'd recommend beef tongue, which they serve with a lemony sauce which was my favorite among the meat dishes. All the must try juicy cuts are also very good if you're just getting into Korean barbecue. Also don't forget to order the Sanchu lettuce wrap because it's a must with Korean barbecue. 

At first I thought they were too busy to help us but they're nice and if you ask them for anything, they'll tend to you. It would be a nicer experience if you know at least a bit about Korean barbecue and how to eat it because the waiters and waitresses are a bit busy.

It is not for the faint of heart, but if you love spicy food like I do, you will love the combination of crunch, spice and a bit of sweet. It was really tasty.

240672,2015-12-20,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"My bestfriend and I came to this BBQ place after we've gone to a Korean Spa. We thought it would be good bec. of how good the reviews seem to be... however, just like most Yelp Reviews... it was all hype. (I'm starting to think that the reviews are mostly fake). 

First off, the host told us that we had about 35-45 min. of wait. So, my bestfriend and I decided we could wait for it. An hour passed, after checking in with the host, he now tells us that reservations come in first, before we get to sit. Since we've already waited for so long... my bestfriend didn't want to leave. So we waited another hour, for a total of TWO HOURS! 

When we were finally sat on our table, we thought, Finally!!! Guess what? We had to wait an extra 30 min for a waiter/waitress to take our order and we weren't even in a hidden area!!! The person who were in line  five people after us even got their food first!!! 

So I finally asked the host for help and he took our order and checked up on us. I don't know who our designated waiter/waitress was but there was this girl waitress who was giving us an attitude, slamming the lettuce order we've ordered on the table. We were just too hungry and to even bother paying attention to her. 

The food was just like any other BBQ place. You cook your own food. As usual, they didn't marinate the shrimp and squid long enough for the flavor to cling when barbequed. The food wasn't worth the inconveniece. 

I understand the long wait in line to be seated. I also would have understood if it would take a few minutes for food to get ready. However, it is absolutely not understandable when the waiter/waitress would ignore you completely; taking 30 minutes to take your order... when you were sat first. Then, needing to flag someone to take your order.

I actually felt bad for the host because he took our orders and was acting like our waiter... when that's really not his job to do. So we decided to give him the tip. (HOWEVER, upon giving him the tip he said he was actually the manager). Thus, I felt irritated all the way home.

As the manager it was his responsibility to ensure that guests are all attended to. I will never go back to this place again and I will advise other family members, group of friends, other government co-workers to completely skip this one. It's not worth the wait. Not worth the trouble. Food places are meant to be fun, relaxing, not troublesome.",HdR-lOoagkl4pQC-xvBlyQ,1,0,1,Dlw7qlaCkeOsEytk_H4mfw

297401,2017-08-02,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"We were in Vegas for our annual family vacation and almost at the end of our stay so everyone is pretty much Buffeted-out.  We turn to Yelp for suggestions and Gangnam Asian Bbq came up. Now mind you.. I'm not much of a fan of having to cook my food when I go out to eat but I'm game. I like to just stuff my face with dinner I ordered and the only effort I want to put in is to slice and lift-to-mouth but again, I'll go with the flow.

The place is in a small strip mall so parking was good. We get there and there was already a line. Personally, it seems small.. I look at the ""Maximum Occupancy"" and it states 75. Remember, I'm still hung-over from the buffets where you see hundreds of people so I had to remind myself that 75 is a good size restaurant. There's a bar in the back of the restaurant where I saw a couple seat themselves because they didn't want to wait the 30mins for a table. While waiting, there's a constant stream of people coming in. This place must be good then.. but we have to wait for our table to see.

We get seated after about 30mins as stated and get a table where the grill looks totally brand new (or got one heck of a cleaning).  Around it are the condiments where we got 2 of each.. kimchi, pickled bean sprouts, baby cucumbers, radish, squid??, fish cake.. you have to pardon me but I don't know what they were called so I listed them as I saw them. We ordered pork belly (lots of it), Beef Toro, and Korean Prime Kalbi. The kids (they're actually adults now but they will always be my kids)  proceed to grill with earnest and the meats cooked fairly quick. Each one of us were given dipping sauces (3) to dip the meats and they turned out very tasty. Again, I'm not a fan of having to cook my food before eating it, but since I wasn't cooking.. it turned out well. Perhaps if my pockets were deeper, we would have swung for the Kobe beef also or more marinated meats, but what we quite full and satisfied from what we ordered.

Overall experience was great.. but why 4 stars and not 5? The service was good but not great. We had to ask to refill our waters and had to flag them down for other requests. It wasn't too much of an effort and the restaurant was very busy but the servers didn't come around often enough to check. The food was good but I had to cook it and season it myself so I can't say great.  The final bill came out and for a party of 6.. it was very good! A lot of food for the price and everyone seems very satisfied. And for the experience of non-buffet.. this was a win.",6eYHnRWS75M0i5WGQ5s0Hw,0,0,4,WYun_zdZSgIaEPXgrN2uqg

But I would have ordered the Tuna Poki and Cream Cheese Rangoon even knowing that we had too much food. They were both amazing!!!  It was out first time there and with Korean BBQ and we didn't really know what we were doing. The waitress we had disappeared for a while and didn't explain very well what was going on. If you are familiar with self-grilled Korean BBQ I'm sure you'd love it. A heads up if you've never had Soju, it tasted like vodka to me, not Sake. Sake is much easy to sip, I had to drink the Soju like a shot.",UDQu5FgFizJvbV9wfLBoSw,0,0,4,Q14_dCzBMO1oq80eKPWKDw

Due to having such an awesome time we came back for lunch on Wednesday. 
That was a big mistake. Horrible service! One waitress actually smiles and the other one acted like we Are there to eat without paying.
We had to ask for refill / new drinks. The server wasn't attentive at all. Throughout the stay, she came by maybe 4 times and that's just to drop off food. We constantly have to ask for her to bring us stuff (drinks, napkins, bill, and change). 
 I work at a restaurant so I know how gratuity work. 
Restaurants usually charge gratuity for table of 6 or more. And I'm pretty sure my group isn't a table of 6. 
I usually don't care if you add gratuity to my check because that save me the time of calculating. But with this service, our waitress clearly did not deserves $25 tip considering how horrible of a service it was.

Dining experience - 5/5 I mean it's KBBQ/Yakiniku style so you cook everything yourself which is always fun and awesome because you can control how you want your beef/steak done 

Taste- 5/5 they have a variety of meats/seafood/vegetables you could throw on the grill including Kobe style beef which just melts in your mouth

Cost-4/5 not bad the only pricey item was the Kobe style beef which is ok, could be a little cheaper (comes with 5-6 slices=$21.95) they also catch you on the little things you'd expect to be included with your meal (sauces, rice, etc. they do come with complimentary small side dishes like kimchi, mac salad, etc.)

We had never been to a Korean bbq before so we had a little trouble with figuring out how to grill the meat. The chef came out to help us multiple times and told us when to flip the meat and how to arrange the meat on the grill. He also came and cut the meat for us when he realized we were struggling a little bit with eating it. All the staff were extremely friendly and the service is very speedy.  The waiter came and checked on us multiple times and refilled our water constantly 

We started our meal with the edamame which is a great way to offset the oiliness of the meat. The meat was so juicy and tender. I wanted to splurge a bit and get the kobe which was pretty expensive but it was definitely worth it. We ordered almost every one of the bbq beef options and they were all delicious in their own way. My favorite was the pork belly and the Kobe.

I was appalled by the meal I was served this evening. It was a graceless, ill-seasoned, flavorless mess. It was as if someone had decided to prepare a ""Korean meal"" at home, threw  ""Asian sauces"" on a few vegetables, made a salad, put chunks of cheap raw meat on a board, and served it up with a big hopeful smile.  

I was able to eat the oysters, and there was some tofu thing that wasn't awful, but the rest of it was either offensively nondescript or downright repulsive. Has this place never heard of doenjang?

The surprise hard boiled egg hidden in the salad gave me sufficient energy to get back to my hotel. Otherwise, that was a rather expensive non-meal.

To be clear: this isn't Korean food. This is crudités and cheap raw meat. You could do it at home for $5.",ItewxumLs9vcr7Lu1SJHfw,0,0,1,StTHzZ9RgkNADWCxUKFLqA

My hotel is half a mile away, I almost didn't make it... Before I even exited the plaza I needed to number two baaaaaaaaad.  I'm so glad I was being lazy and drove l rather than walked.

Luckily we stopped in right about 10:00pm on a Tuesday night which meant we were able to take advantage of happy hour. Beef toro was $4 and I think we got 4 orders of this. Honestly, everything was great. The spicy chicken, the creamed corn, the jalapeño poppers, you name it. But that beef toro? Fantastic. Highly recommend it.

What is horrible is the service and attitude of the servers.  We came for lunch and weren't given lunch special menus.  When I asked for the menu, the attitude started.  We didn't end up ordering the lunch special, but not one smile or happy service for the entire meal.  Each request was met with a grumpy grunt.  They don't refill side dishes without being asked like good korean restaurant experiences.  They don't see a utensil falling to the ground in front of their face and move to address it.

890369,2016-09-12,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Don't let the 4000+ reviews fool you; the only reason Gangnam has this many reviews is because they hand out free desserts when customers show them completed yelp reviews, and they are undoubtedly skewed high as no dogs bite the hands that feed them.  This restaurant lags far behind other Korean BBQ joints in New York and Los Angeles particularly in terms of service, and while the food was solid it was by no means outstanding.

Food:
We ordered the steamed egg which was way overcooked.  The BBQ dishes were decent however and the portions are all solid given the price.  The japchae was also on point.  

Service:
Nothing against the waiters as service was prompt, but the level of service was just not up to par for a Korean BBQ restaurant.  At the other restaurants I've been to servers cook the food for the customers, not to mention that beef and pork dishes are cooked on different specialized grill tops.  Once the meats are cooked the servers will slice them into bite-sized morsels.  Gangnam leaves the customers to do all of this on their own, and throughout dinner there was only one grill top which no one bothered to switch out even after the top was charred black.  The fan above the grill was also either off or not very strong so smoke was everywhere.",haR0avSV_neX7TCR0aJAYA,0,0,3,BFv3WJtvc6DnjGLMoQpzpg

979283,2015-12-22,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"As soon as I found this restaurant I wanted to try it but don't be fooled by all these reviews and stars on Yelp. The restaurant was freezing cold, the service was awful, the food wasn't very good, and to top it off the server gave us some other person's credit card and ran away before we could tell her it wasn't ours! In no way is that ok. I will never go back to this restaurant again. 

When we got there we were greeted with the most unfriendliest server I have ever seen. She made us feel very unwelcome and as if we did something wrong by coming into the restaurant. 

After we were seated we were ignored for a bit. She never asked us if we had been there before or explained anything to us. After we ordered she gave us some kind of sauce and some side dishes. There was no explanation as to what any of it was. We tried 5 of the 7 side dishes and only one of them tasted like anything and that was cucumber. They were not good and the 2 we didn't try looked really unappetizing. 

When the meat came out again no explanation about how to handle and cook the raw meat so that there is no cross contamination or cooking times to make sure the meat is cooked properly so that we don get food poisoning. Ever other restaurant that has you cook your own meat that I have been to tells you these things. The meat was alright. It was nothing special. For the amount of stars and reviews this restaurant has I expected something better than mediocre.  

When we were finished we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get the check. We noticed that the server kept looking at us but was trying to ignore us. The table next to us who sat down while we were eating got their check before we did. We finally got the check and gave them our card. The sever then brought back the card and basically threw it on the corner of the table and ran away. She had actually  given us the wrong credit card. She ran away so fast we couldn't give it back. Luckily a tall skinny male server came an took it and brought our card.",m4gekAduH2p0WvYSokTEuA,3,1,1,0_m1odSXBJBGi-5oyTXA-g

We ordered veggie bibimbap, scallops, calamari, shrimp, mushrooms, onions, dynamite shrimp appetizer, asparagus, and king oyster mushroom. Also, hirami steak for me. Mainly seafood & veg bc my husband doesn't eat meat. The dynamite shrimp didnt come out until halfway through our meal. It was supposed to be appetizer. I think the server forgot to put it in bc he didnt write our order down. I think he got offended that I asked if he was going to write anything down. Oh well. Food was ok. I prefer gyu kaku. Faster service & better taste imo. We ordered the honey toast & it took fooorreever. Literally 20 min. The girl asked us twice what flavor icecream and she still gave us the wrong ones. If you've had honey toast in Hawaii, you know that the bread inside is usually hollowed out, cut into cubes & toasted with butter & drizzled with honey. This place did neither of those things. They left the bread inside whole & scooped icream on top. It was so hard to eat. We tried cutting it but it became a disaster & was so messy. We took a few bites & left it. The lazy male server was busy talking to another female server and left another female to clean off 2 of his tables & ours. He just kept yapping & didnt lift one finger to help clean off his own table. Unbelievable. The tip should go to the girls who helped us & kept checking on us but im sure they share tips.

Good place to sample decent Korea BBQs. Think of it like Korean food served in Japanese portions. 

Con:
It's a popular place and that means you wait...and wait...

Honestly, If you're looking for more authentic Korean taste and variety, there are other Korean restaurants near by.  The menu price seems a bit lower than other Korean restaurant price, but when you get your typical fill of meat, you do end up paying about the same.",bYKIUiScapxBkj7FZLVgew,0,0,4,brGsbM1UALKpoIDR1SSAKg

We ordered the ""Gangnam"" BBQ package for two for $65.00, which came w/ five different cuts of marinated beef (i.e., filet mignon, Kobe, etc.) with the following accompaniment:  

two bowls of white rice, one big bowl of spring-mixed salad w/ light vinaigrette dressing, four pieces of quartered sweet corn (raw; to be cooked on the Korean table-top grill), mushroom medley, fresh slivers of garlic, and jalapeño slices, SIX Korean side dishes (i.e., Kimchi, spicy pickled cucumber, macaroni salad, spicy pickled bean sprouts, etc.), and two bowls of miso soup.

We got prime Kalbi, both marinated and not marinated. The not marinated one was the best thing I had this meal. The beef tongue was aight. If it was sliced a bit thinner or a bit thicker it would've been great. Pork belly was typical pork belly. We cooked it to crispy. The filet mignon was meh. Would skip. We also got the king oyster mushroom. It was aight. 

Get the prime kalbi. So good. So fat. So worth. 

Also get the sesame oil with sea salt. It's well worth the one dollar. Adds a lot of flavor to the meats.

But the price is kind of expensive for the amount of meat given. The servers don't really check up on your table so you have to go chasing for the servers to get what you want. Also, when I ordered the fried calamari, you can't really taste or feel the calamari inside. It's more of batter than the squid itself. Lastly, I'm more on the shorter side, so the chairs were kind of too far so I kept having to move forward to reach the table. Since the service we received was not good, we did not leave a tip so while we were waiting for our uber, one of the servers, came outside and asked if service was bad, and we responded by saying ""it was alright"" and he was like ""I was just asking because you guys didn't leave a tip"".

Now keep in mind they do not have AYCE, which is good because you don't have meat just lying out until it is all gone; quality control is what I would say about their meat!

Now for beginners or people who never been to a Asian BBQ style restaurant like this, I would suggest ordering al la carte first.  I know they offer combo meal but it's a lot of food and you may be gambling with what you ""may"" like or not like.  You can always order as you cook.  Service is excellent and they check up on you in timely manners.  That was a big plus for me...we all know that server at that restaurant where the server just keeps coming back and interrupting...well that is not the case here.  

As for location, it is situated in a shopping center that offers multiple eatery places, sushi, mexican, etc.  The only thing I would be caution on is that it is located across the street from Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  I can only imagine just how busy they may be during the weekend.  If you don't want to wait or be in a crowded situation, I would suggest going during the week days.

Alternatively, I had the beef toro to myself; it was very fatty, in fact tasted like the fat on a grilled steak which I love but husband doesn't eat fat on purpose...(!) Get the bulgogi bibimbap instead of white rice; it's a more interesting rice dish with beef in it. Only had 1 piece of the broccoli cheese fondue, was just so much food something had to give!

We were craving something really good in Vegas that was off the strip, so we saw that this was one of the highest rated restaurants in the area. It was surprisingly pretty empty when we arrived (around 1pm). My boyfriend and I were super impressed because they had a great lunch menu and a huge variety. 

We ended up getting a lot of items a la carte because there were some specific items that we knew we wanted to try. The menu ranged from a lot of items that we didn't normally see on a KBBQ menu, so we were pretty excited to try a lot of them. The side dishes were pretty great, but the waiters didn't offer complimentary refills, which is usually the norm in Dallas. 

We ordered enoki with bacon, scallop with bacon, pork belly, Korean prime kalbi, steamed egg, beef toro, and fatty ribs. The enoki and scallop were probably one of the favorites. The meats were all well-seasoned and very fresh. The kalbi was excellent and had good marbling. Overall, very good quality and price for the amount of food that we ordered. 

Also, you get a free ice cream macaroon when you check in. It's the same ones that they used to have from Boiling Point, so we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was a great quality one!",aJdAaTG8QgMEwSttjQqkOA,3,2,4,iFNqtTatvzkp32SL-08j4A

The wait: none, we were seated immediately

I'm going to try and remember everything we ordered:

Appetizers:
-2 steamed eggs: so fluffy!
-1 Kobe beef carpaccio: yum!
-1 Tuna poki: this was alright
-1 shishito peepers: just like anywhere else
-1 house salad: nothing special 

For the grill:
-1 Harami Miso: thinner than expected 
-1 Pork Belly: inconsistent meat to fat ratio where some were almost all fat whereas some didn't have enough fat. 
-2 Prime Kalbi: this was the best out of all the meats. So freakin tender and buttery. It was beautifully marbleized. 
-2 Beef Toro: just good
-1 Korean Prime Rib: had a good marinate to it
-1 scallop with bacon: it has bacon- nuff said
-1 enoki with bacon: love these little mushrooms
-2 kabocha squash: it was cut too thin, just a tad bit thicker would've made it more enjoyable 
-1 Japanese peppers: no kick to it 

Just because:
-1 mushroom medley: already cooked, meh
-1 bibimbap: I didn't try but everyone that did liked it
-1 spicy ramen: the broth was flavorful but needed a kick to it, it is called ""spicy"" ramen after all.

My friends and I came in late on a Friday night after a long drive to Vegas. We were stoked to find a KBBQ so close to the strip! Got there around 11pm as they close around 1am. The restaurant was pretty empty. We were seated quickly and told it was happy hour! Score! Here's what we ordered: 

- fried calamari, 2/5
- chicken karaage, 4/5
- beef toro, 3/5
- pork belly, 3/5
- beef bulgogi, 3/5

Everything was mediocre. Nothing out of the ordinary and pricey for the size of the portions. We ended up ordering 3 orders of the beef toro! What really gave this place low stars was the service. They were nice and all but seriously nowhere to be found whenever we needed anything. Our orders took forever to come out and after the long drive, we just wanted to eat! Also, our grill was literally on fire until someone casually came out and changed it. Our server also made weird, awkward, borderline inappropriate jokes and just gave the whole experience a weird vibe.

It's off the strip btw so you'll need to drive or take taxi/uber/lyft. We got there around 7:30pm and we put our names down. We waited roughly 45 minutes to hour. It didn't seem that packed when we got there but I guess people put their names and came back to walk around. I was getting super hungry and the smell of the food made even hungrier. We got seated in the back room and it was some-what quiet which was nice but the one thing that kind of sucked was that it was hard to get the waiters attention since not many come by so I had to get up and find someone. Anyways, this place is NOT an AYCE but they have set menus that you can pick from and we ordered the Gangam set. For two people, it is a lot of food so it is almost like an AYCE to me. There was tons of meat (kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly, toro and veggies). All meats were very juicy and marinated well so you don't really need to use the sauces that they provide. The sauces all tasted a bit salty to me so I don't recommend the sauces to be honest. Other than, the food was amazing, service wasn't bad and pricing wasn't too bad ($60 for two people).

1352495,2014-03-20,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Great deal for Happy Hour ! Discounted prices for appetizers and meats. Its like $3 for an order of pork belly or beef toro (brisket). 

Came here for ""dinner"" before an event i had to go to, with a friend. She had been here before and was on the way, so had me order (before it hit the end of Happy Hour time). She liked the Pork Belly and Pork Toro. 

Service by this young korean waitress was superb. Very friendly and funny. 

We had ordered 3 pork belly, 1 pork toro, 2 toro beef, and 1 prime kalbi. 

The pork toro (pork cheek) isn't discounted. - $5.95 - As the ""toro"" name suggests, it is highly marbleized with some thick areas of fat on the edges. This isn't the first time i've had pork cheek (similar to pork neck meat as well). When cooked properly, and a good quality meat, it should have a super tender texture, and ""crispy"". Not like a hard crispy but like crisp to bite through. I cooked it in a way where it seared the fat giving it a nice crisp in the fat. The pork toro is NOT marinated or seasoned in any way. Quality, to me, seems not up to what i had imagined. Overall still not bad, but could be better. But pork cheek/neck meat is quite expensive. somewhere along $10-15/lb, wholesale. X_x 

Prime kalbi - $8.45 - quality wise, wasnt that good either. For them to put the ""prime"" name, id expect a high quality cut of meat, flavorful and tender. Not to the point of aged meats, but you know what i mean. The prime kalbi is seasoned with some slight marinade topped with some finely minced garlic? Pieces are a fair thickness. Cooks nicely. Not as tender as i hoped, nor was it as marbleized as i have had this cut in other places. 

Toro Beef - $3.45 - otherwise quoted as ""Beef Brisket"". By no means it is the Toro i was thinking of. It is straight up brisket, similar to that of what you get any where else. Misleading name, but i guess it was my fault for believing it may be more towards to the Toro name vs the quoted brisket name. Thin slices of meat. Cooks fast. Simple as that. 

Pork belly - $2.95 - surprisingly, this was probably the best of the 4 items we had ordered. Even compared to the pork toro or prime kalbi. sad but surprising. Lol. Simple pork belly cuts. 

Overall, not bad experience. Priced fair during happy hour. Pretty sure i wouldn't be ordering the meats not during happy hour though. Nice place to try if you are in the area.

I wanted to try their best cuts and you actually save some money by going with the preset meal rather then ordering them individually; trust me I did the calculations.  They also said that the portions were the same whether you order through the set meal for the individual dishes. I don't think any place has authentic Kobe beef in America but this place has the Kobe style beef which was really really good here. If you haven't tried that type of beef you should definitely try it once in your lifetime.  All four of the different meats that came with the meal were all really good so I would recommend you try the filet mignon first otherwise if you eat that last you will be disappointed. The tuna pokey was also really good and so was the beef carpaccio. The meal also came with different dipping sauces to go with the meat and all of them were very good. My wife also said that the salad was really good, I ate a little and I would agree. Even the asparagus came out really well, not overcooked. They put it in foil and cook it in butter and you can taste it. The side dishes are just OK. The bibimbap wasn't that great, the rice wasn't that crispy.

We ordered the Gangnam combo with another order of pork belly and a couple of drinks. Every meat in the Gangnam combo was marinated, high quality and made it a sexual foodgasm experience to the max. I wasn't blown away by the pork belly, it was meh.

We decided on the Meat Lovers but substituted spicy garlic edamame for the seaweed salad that was standard. Our sides arrived quickly.  I noticed that we were the minority and the clientele was primarily Asian so I took that as a good sign.  

Having never had Korean BBQ before it would have been nice to get some instruction on what to do with everything. As an example, we cooked our meat on the sides instead of in the middle and it kept sticking to the grill. When there was just a little meat left on one plate, the server placed it on the grill for us and that's when we realized our placement error. 
Another thing that might be helpful is some type of labeling on all of the different items so we would know what we were eating.  
Everything we had was delicious.  I think the standout for me with regards to main dishes was the marinated pork.  All the appetizers were amazing.  The miso soup was so rich and flavorful.  The dressing on the salad was delicious and just the right amount of sweet.  The chili dumplings had a really tasty sauce and I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy garlic edamame.

I was SO looking forward to this meal and it was the first stop after leaving the airport to kick off the weekend in Vegas. We arrived at 3pm, so the restaurant was really empty (it can get packed!). The service and the timing for the food was perfect due to the slower time of day we dined. I believe that dining at 3pm def allowed us to have a better experience. 

Each table is set up with it's own grill and has a hood vent. Although the hood helps, be prepared to still smell like grill when you leave the establishment. We settled on one of the pre-selected bundles 'meat lover' 
 at $56 for 2 people-which had 6 proteins and an array of salad, soup, and apps. Of course the bonchon side dishes were complimentary and delicious. The best meats in the meat lover set were the beef toro and the flat iron garlic. Both were melt in your mouth delicious. 

I think the sets are a good way to try more of the menu if you're new to the establishment but when I go back I'll be likely to just order cuts that I love.",EMMKdK1cGrLSo08wgSYHJQ,3,2,5,pk0DMFMZV6hqr1uTO0SlyA

I actually think the meal went from great to good. Their appetizers( the little small dishes that korean places serve were great and we got soup, bibimbap(which I thought was really good and flavorful).

x SUN DU BU ($9.95 with rice) The best I've ever had and I've had a lot. The calamari was so soft too although there ended up being too much calamari to soup ratio.
x STEAMED EGG ($4.95) this was not very good as it was over-steamed and not silky as it usually is at other restaurants. 
x HARAMI MISO ($8.95) This was really succulent and tasty. Must order!
x KOREAN PRIME KALBI ($8.95) This was tasty although a bit too fatty for my liking. 

The lettuce is $2 but it is so fresh and crispy, it is a must for complimenting the bbq meat.

The food here is delicious. This is what we ordered: 
-spicy tuna kimbap
-spicy soft tofu
-Harami miso
-Korean prime kalbi
-Beef toro 
-Salmon 
-Korean chicken with cheese fondue 
-bibimbap

The beef is very tender and soft. It just melts in your mouth! The beef toro wasn't as tender as if anticipated. The   Korean prime kalbi was delicious but I would have to say that the Harami Miso was my favorite. The spicy tuna kimbap is good but it's very heavy. It'd be wise to take it slow with that!
The chicken was very soft and tender surprisingly, but the cheese part really wasn't for me. The spicy tofu soup was very flavorful and delicious. It definitely helps settle all the bbq that you just ate. 

Overall, quality and and atmosphere are on point here. I would definitely come back here in the future.

When the food arrived he put it on the table and started to walk away. I asked him what we do with the food and he pointed out the beef and pork dishes and the only instruction was ""cook the pork well done"" and he walked away.

We each started taking a piece of meat and cooking it and eating it which took a long time. After watching some other tables it was clear we should have cooked lots of food at one time.

Our favorites: beef bulgogi, spicy pork, enoki bacon.
The flat iron garlic was good, meat was very tender but lack in flavor. They do give you 3 dipping sauces for your meats. 
We also got the Korean marinated short rib. Flavor is similar to the beef bulgogi, meat was tender. 
For the price difference I would just stick with beef bulgogi at $3.95 instead of the other two mentioned above that cost $8.95. 
Sides included: cucumber, Kim chi, sweet onion/daikon, weird spicy noodle dish (not our fave), Mac and cheese salad.
Husband ordered the steamed egg, it looks really big but not as fluffy and airy like the one from Tofu Hut. 
I ordered the house salad. I liked the variety of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes, Lao came with an egg cut in half. The dressing sauce had a hint of orange citrus flavor, yummy.

So was my bimbimbap. I didn't notice any tofu and it didn't have an egg either but still flavourful without any obvious protein. Not only was my meal filling. It was cheap.

Also, this place is literally a rip off of Gyukaku. This part is kind of funny...

1708646,2013-05-12,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"So, we came here on a whim, having resolved to try all the various places in the area.  We walked in at 6:30 PM on a Saturday, and the place was a ghost town.  One other couple at a table.  The cheerful staff seated us promptly, and equipped us with menus.  

The usual suspects on the beer list, plus a few oddballs which made for nice variety, and also a choice of sakes and other asian alcoholic beverages.

For those of you unfamiliar with the asian BBQ style of dining (as I was) each table has a small gas grill set in its center (and exhaust hoods with fire extinguisers set above them).  Each place setting comes equipped with a pair of tongs.  You order off the menus small (4 oz) batches of raw meat, and then grill them at the table.  It is not quite like Benihana, in that 1) there is not a chef doing entertainment-cooking in front of you, and 2) you are not in a mixed party.  Our waitress did come by from time to time to flip the meat , and to cut it with scissors so that it could be eaten with chopsticks.

The service was quite prompt and pleasant.  The interior of the restaurant was nicely finished, although the 2-person bench seats on each side of the table are so heavy that it makes it difficult to manhandle them into a comfortable position.  

The grilled dumplings were tasty; but oddly my girlfriend's less expensive beef tasted markedly superior to my pricer order.  

One thing that was irksome were the televisions.  They were showing women's college softball on ESPN 8 or something, and it was just annoying and distracting, cheapening the feel of what was otherwise a refined restaurant.  Why anyone installs TV's in restaurants other than sports bars is beyond me.  

The food was ok without being great.  Nothing that made me say ""we HAVE to come here again!""  Prices seemed fair ($50 for the 2 of us, including tip, and we ate pretty well).  I admit I am terrible at using chopsticks, and so getting food into my mouth without making a mess is a challenge.  I didn't ask if they had forks, knives, spoons, but I was thinking about it.

When we left, we were the only patrons.  I wonder if Gangnam BBQ will be able to dial up their food to match the good service and beautiful interior.  I will be rooting for them, but don't know how soon I will be rushing back.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,1,0,3,8J2BHoMJQ2rw-pxplRVYYQ

We ordered Bibimbap ($12) and spicy Sukiyaki Noodles ($9), our server tossed the dishes for us on their sizzling hot plates, brought us hot tea and let us eat our enormous portions in quiet recovery (this IS Vegas after all, who isn't having breakfast at early dinner time, and nursing some form of hang over?). 

As the restaurant got busier, our solo server got some help as a new guy started his shift, and we weren't forgotten in the hustle.

The interior of the restaurant is soothing, Asian minimalism, a nice balance between Japanese and Korean stylings, as is the food. I love trying restaurants off the strip in Vegas, as they are SO much better quality and pricing than anything near the touristy parts. 

Gangnam was so much more appetizing than anything we could have hoped for on a post-EDC weekend  ;D

1773250,2017-03-13,2,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"I didn't know there was a Korean BBQ this close to UNLV until I found this place on Yelp ! 

Their menu is very similar to Gyu-Kaku. Meats are a la carte. They have combination sets , lunch specials (before 3 pm) , and happy hour (3 pm - 6 pm & 10 pm - closing). 

We settled with their lunch special which is a really good value since it comes w/ banchan , rice , house salad (or miso soup) , one or two meats and an appetizer. I ordered the bulgogi & the meats we grilled were well marinated and tender. I tend to skip bulgogi at AYCE places because they're usually not marinated that good but here you can really taste the quality. Prime kalbi is not included in lunch specials but ordered it anyways since we were dining here already and I wanted to see how it compared to other places. Their kalbi was excellent and had good marbling. Servings aren't necessarily huge , but it's an ample amount of meat. You would get pretty full off eating just one or two.

Love that they offer a lot on their dessert menu ! They have the Brick macaron ice creams (same ones they have at Gen KBBQ and No. 1 Boba Tea) , honey toast , ice cream mochi , banana tempura , etc. If you spend over 15$ and check-in on Yelp , you get a free macaron ice cream of your choice.

Interior is very sleek and modern. Ventilation is good , the restaurant didn't smell smokey at all. The tables are kinda too wide , there is quite a distance between customers sitting across from each other. Music isn't super loud though so it wasn't a problem having a conversation. They have a nice playlist going on too.

This place is a nice alternative to AYCE KBBQ. Staff is very attentive and friendly ! Most definitely a 5 star place :)",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,7,4,5,Gw8ImP48aRCwy7bL8wNF9g

We arrived around midnight and the place was still packed with people. We had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated at a table. The place was clean, dimly lit and had the ambience of a club. There was music and music videos playing on the big screen. On to the food -- my husband really wanted to try the Kobe style beef since he's been craving it ever since he got back from his trip to Japan. We ordered a plate of the Kobe style beef, a plate of the flat iron garlic beef and a plate of the pork belly. The pork belly and garlic beef were good but nothing that we can't get back home. The Kobe style beef was a huge disappointment! They cut the slices extra thick which is not how Kobe should be served. The texture was really rough and hard to chew. Normally I would be craving more after only one plate of beef but their Kobe beef made me not want to eat meat ever again. Needless to say, we ended up only eating 2 pieces and leaving the rest to be thrown away... there goes $20 into the garbage. I ended up just eating the side dishes for the rest of my meal. Other than the food, the service was good. The guy who checked us out was friendly and accommodating. For dessert we tried the mango macron which ended up being the best part of the meal. The macron was super crunchy and soft and melted in your mouth and the ice cream was easy to bite into and didn't melt in your hands.

She was frantic to find a place that served Asian food, was affordable, but great enough for the dozen of us to enjoy--in  a couple of short hours from her call!  Of course, I turned to Yelpers and the fact that Gangnam had over 2,500 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars convinced me this was a safe place to recommend. My friend immediately booked their private room for 7pm.

While the restaurant appeared small from the storefront, it was surprisingly well laid out for groups, couples, and we saw singles dining, too. So don't hesitate to stop in if you're dining solo.  We were seated in a private room toward the back, large enough, yet cozy for 12.

As soon as most of the group were seated, the ban chan was brought in. Large variety of appetizer were laid out, including the requisite kimchi mixes, sprouts, taegu, and more. Our friendly server guided us to the combination selections.  It was unanimous that the Gangnam combo would be the way to go as the more people you have, the better the price per person. The ban chan had the requisite various kimchi, sprouts, and much more.

Onion miso soup, large salad to share, fresh oysters on the  half shell, grilled shishito peppers, mushroom medley, choice of steamed rice or bulgogi bibimbap rice, and beef ... lots and lots of beef ... kalbi, bulgogi,  etc. Food seemed to just keep coming until we were overwhelmed and finally tapped out!

I've eaten at several Asian BBQ types of places in the Los Angeles area, and we're glad that this wasn't our first experience because we never would've eaten at this style restaurant again. We chose this restaurant (driving through the state from LA to Utah) because of all the positive Yelp! comments, and we were just so surprised at how flavorless the food was. In addition, one member of our party ordered the beef gyoza appetizer that comes with the lunch menu,  and it was ice cold. We had to ask the server if it should've been served hot, which it was. We waited quite a bit for the appetizer to be prepared properly. 

There are six mini appetizers that come with your lunch menu and after the gyoza experience, we weren't sure which of the items should've been hot or cold, and they were mostly unappetizing.

Service was also slow, could have been far more attentive, and the restaurant was not busy. It took an hour and a half for our lunch.

-We came at lunch and it was easy to find.  It's located in a shopping plaza next to a tattoo parlor.
-They have a nice selection of combos and tapas.  We went w/ the Gangnam combo which in the end was too much food (and I hate wasting food, but didnt want to walk around with a backpack smelling of KBBQ).  I think the bill came out to around $75 including the tip.

And guess what?
it was hella good.

Not that you really had to guess since my four star rating clearly indicates I liked it.
Oh Dan B, your redundancies grow more and more with each passing day.
Anyways.

First of all, what looks to be a fairly standard strip mall restaurant from the outside takes on a very unexpected turn once you step inside and behold a very sleek, modern, and spacious layout.  What really got my attention was the absence of the billowing smoke wafting around tables when people are grilling - it's something I both fondly and annoyingly associate with most Asian BBQ places.

The staff was super attentive from the get go and really helpful when it came to best deciphering which combination of set menus and a la cart items would yield the best sampling of what Gangnam had to offer.

And I have to tell you the selection, quality, and flavor of the meats we grilled were impressive: tender, well seasoned, and fresh.  The servings aren't necessarily huge, but it needn't be when it's that good and so reasonably priced that ordering extra isn't too exorbitant.

Overall, Gangnam has to be one of the best BBQ experiences I've had in awhile: great food and drink, stylish decor, and somewhere my little one would enjoy going. It's also helps reminds me how nice / necessary it is to take a break from buffets every once in awhile.",vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ,37,29,4,nMpCqv9kBohPM12_6BzqnA

The must have appetizer is Uni and pork belly. It's low carb, fatty and creamy. All kinds of yummy goodness. Seriously. One order has two wraps so order accordingly. 
The meat is such good quality. Trimmed and perfectly marbled. You can choose marinated or natural. I recommend natural since the quality of meat was excellent it doesn't need much. This is how you know the place is good when you grill the meat simply and dip it in a bit of sesame oil, salt and pepper. 
This is now my new must go to place when I come to Vegas. One of the best Korean restaurants in Nevada and I highly recommend it.",r0E8c6_4AOP1NW6eSXT_ig,0,1,5,ys-yaWBBTw3cYn9QJoge3g

This place sucks balls. I'm not comparing it to LA at all. They charge for sesame oil and salt and salad? $4.75 for a steamed egg? You got to be kidding me. Plus they're portions are so small and expensive, I couldn't even get full! Oh and rice was $2 for a small bowl...

So literally each place of meat only has 6 small pieces for $9. So we pretty much ordered everything in the meat section and some bacon wrapped scallops snd salmon. Those were honestly okay. 

We decided to try something new by getting cheese fondue with broccoli. BIG MISTAKE. It was literally Kraft single cheese with oil? It didn't even melt right over the fire and wouldn't even stick on the broccoli. 

SERVICE? Okay they were attentive when it came to ordering... But when we tried to refill our bachan they never came of course . We tried refilling twice on radish and bean sprouts! They said yes and then never return with it! 

Plus when we received our bill they didn't put our drinks on HH and we had to tell them. *eye rolls*

For the price, which is quite reasonable, the portions are a good size. We had three meat plates (beef toro, pork belly, prime kalbi) and a few sides (oysters, dumplings, calamari, seaweed salad) , shared between three people. I was stuffed! We also ended up getting banana tempura for dessert. All in all, it was a good meal. My least favorite item probably wouldve been the calamari. But there are so many other items to order, it's not a big deal. It wasn't bad, I just have a high expectation for my calamari. 

As far as service, they were on top of their stuff. Never had to ask for water. They checked on us just enough to not be annoying. 

We went around 530, and we were the only people there, which worried me a bit. But by the time we left, about hour and a half later, the place was packed. So if you don't want to wait, be sure to go early.

We had the premium meal for two. The food comes real fast and before you know it, you're done. But with plenty of leftovers. Wagyu was nicely fresh and marbled, but tough.  The salad was awesome and fresh.  Shrimp was so so, kimchis were also so so.  Very Americanized meal.

Seating in the booths was very uncomfortable. So if there is an other option, I suggest you choose a table. Booths have very hard wooden seats with semi soft backing that was also WAY too far away from the table. Awkward seating situation that made us squirm through the meal.

They promote that you get a free dessert if you rate them on Yelp, which I think, contributes to the ratings here. They don't require a high rating, but would you eat a dessert after you show them that you just gave them a bad review? Nope.",QgyuhXFyrjBNdLytSbhqUQ,1,0,3,7P7WzeTCbvZIl6y-GVX6pA

FOOD

You can order a la carte or go for the set menu, and they came in a couple of different tiers. My friend and I went for the most expensive one and it did not disappoint.

Good quality meat, good selections and it is very generous portioning for the price. Definitely felt that my money was well spent and was getting what I paid for.

SERVICE

The food came at a reasonable time and definitely appreciate when they let us have the experience, cook at our pace and enjoy each meat nicely without feeling rushed. 

The waiter was very nice and had a nice small talk with him while he offered to cook for us.

I live in OC and close to Ktown so I guess you can say I'm spoiled but when you ask for Korean radish and they have no idea what you're taking about and everything is in Japanese something is a miss. In looking around it was brilliant as there are many sushi restaurants in LV and 2 in the same shopping center as Gangnam (btw really I should have known better) so the owner thought hey we can serve Korean and then bribe yelpers with free dessert for the 2k worth of reviews.

When we got there she told us we were next to get a table so it would probably be 30 minutes or less. We had a party of 11 and we told them that we wouldn't mind splitting our table but they said to just wait for the table in the back. It's understandable that you can't control how long a customer takes but 2 hours later, we're still waiting and are watching for the table the reserved for us. By the time the family that had finished at that table, only one waiter came in to go clean it.. And he didn't even finish cleaning.. It wasn't until another 15 mins later the others realized they needed to finish cleaning it, lol. 

The food came out quickly so it wasn't that bad, but we didn't get our appetizers until after all our food came out.. And the waiter didn't seem really happy and looked mad the whole time, when we asked for somethings he would miss it until we reminded him a couple times. It doesn't kill to fake a smile at the least... They didn't really check on us as much either, we needed a new grill and had to wait until nearly the end as we were finishing our food for it to be replaced.

That toasted the grill up with some flavor before adding filet, duck, scallops, and bacon wrapped Udon mushrooms. Everything caramelized and cooked perfectly. All we added was some garlic butter which toasted nicely on the grill in very thin slices. Topped the night off with a macaroon to share. Strawberry was very good.

I'm spoiled by the generous portions from the other KBBQ places I've been to. The vegetables included in the combo were random and awkward too. The combo does not come with your traditional banchan (Korean side dishes). No kimchi, no lettuce, none of the usual Korean sauces for your meat. We did get three sauces-ponzu, glazed sauce, and a somewhat spicy sauce. It wasn't terrible but without my banchan, there was something lacking for sure. Yes, I realize it's not a traditional KBBQ restaurant-some Korean/Japanese BBQ fusion. The service was good though.

EDIT:** I now know why this place has 2800 reviews, if you tell them you are reviewing them on Yelp they will offer you free dessert. **

Right away, you notice this small restaurant has limited tables due to the nature of the way you prepare the food.  What an awesome time.  Come here with a group, sit around a table and order one of the packages.  They come with a feast!! Appetizers, kimchis, salads, rice and tons of meat.

Everything we tried was great...the bulgogi and the pork were my absolute favorite meats.  I also loved the seaweed salad and the different Kimchi.

The music, was an interesting choice to say the least...not sure it fits the atmosphere.  We came on a Sunday night and it was gangster rap...it made us literally laugh out loud because of how out of place it was in a place like this.


The price was also not bad at all.  It ended up after tax and tip being about $40 a person for the 3rd package option..I don't remember the name.  You can get it down to as low as $20 per person on the package if you wanted to leave a few things out.

Although the strip mall it is located in seemed busy, the restaurant itself was pretty vacant for a Sunday night at 6:30PM.  

They gave us a menu with ""happy hour"" pricing on most of the food packages, which I'm not sure if that is given at all times or not.

Anyway, 4 stars.  The decor is really nice, the service is very attentive, the food was great.  They bring all the food to you. The Miso Soup was delicious. The meats were brought to our table, and they ask if you want assistance in cooking them at your table; however, we declined and cooked them ourselves.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  

Minus one star for one reason only.  I thought the prices were a bit high with the ""happy hour"" pricing.  If the prices are truly higher during peak hours, I would definitely not come back.

Fortunately, my co-worker knew what to order, and she made some recommendations that were just fantastic. I had bulgogi (pork) with a mushroom medley that was absolutely delicious. The portions were very generous, too. It was fun cooking the food on the little bbqs.
Service was a bit slow, but the poor waitress was having problems with their cash register; she apologized and explained what the issue was, so we were forgiving of the situation.
The lunch special was very reasonable, considering the amount of food we received and the quality of it. We were extremely happy campers when we left and went back to the conference. I told myself that next time I go to Vegas, I will *definitely* be back to eat here.

My first reaction upon seeing the menu was to be a bit taken aback by the printed discount signs on the menu. Made me think of ""regular price 9.95 but just for you it's 7,50--- maybe because the food is old or no one wants to go there.""

I worried too much. The food was reasonably good. Tasty Korean BBQ at an affordable price. Service was pretty indifferent. ""Yes we have a smaller table but it isn't set up: why don't you sit at the bar.""  And I had to wait for a fair amount of time before getting any attention to place my order. The indifferent service might account for my bulgogi being a bit on the cold side. But the food did taste good and was a good value for the money.

We ordered 6 different cuts of meat (spicy chicken, spicy pork, harami miso, kalbi, bulgogi, and regular pork). It was deliciously marinated and juicy and easy to cook yourself. I didn't even need the side sauces. The kimchi was perfectly spicy and the cucumber side dish was nicely sweet. The miso soup had the perfect temperature and flavor. Rice was perfectly cooked as well and service was extremely friendly and very attentive. Best part of it was all that came out to a price that was very affordable and reasonable for lunch (because you're off the strip). Highly highly recommend!!

Edit 3/1/17: came here again by myself and sat at the bar. I ordered several cuts of meat and the rock shrimp. When you sit at the bar you don't get to cook the meat yourself which I didn't realize. Honestly I was kind of happy about that because it takes so long to cook everything that sometimes it's just nice to sit back and relax and eat instead lol. They brought everything out quickly and it was just as tasty as before, as far as the flavors go. The cuts of meat were a little on the chewier side compared to last time (although ever so slightly it wasn't a big deal) but maybe also thicker and bigger from what I remember? ... maybe lunch vs dinner portion? Not sure. But still a great meal overall and this time I tried the side sauces which were really nice. Wait staff was on point again as well. Funny enough, they saw me on yelp adding this edit and my mochi ended up being on the house.

I've had this place bookmarked for a long time now, but never actually got to going because of the mixed reviews I was getting. Four and a half stars on yelp and a visiting friend from New York finally got me to pay this spot a visit. We ordered the gangnam combo for a party of three which was more than enough food. This combo is meant to feed two people for $66. The combo came with five kinds of meats, fresh oysters, quartered sweet corn on the cob, bibimbap or side of white rice, miso soup, and mushroom medley. All cuts were subpar in my opinion. Bulgogi was too sweet and chunks were not cut up. The filet mignon was my least favorite. The chunks were rather large. Putting in work for something tasty was worthwhile, but for meats that did not taste at all fresh, that's just asking for too much. The bibimbap was simply sweet rice and beef. Not much veggies and hot sauce mixed in like the typical bibimbap dish. My favorite part of he meal was probably the soon tofu we ordered in addition to the gangnam combo. Soup was tasty and the seafood bits aroused surprise with each bite. This place also does not cook your meat for you. So roll up your sleeves, tie back you hair, and get cooking!

Would I come again? Definitely not. Not worth the money. You might as well go elsewhere that will cook your meat for you for cheaper with better quality meat.

Get one of those and a la carte the few selections you really enjoyed and you're bill will be about 100$ total for 6 people! Not bad, right?

The miso soup was by far the best miso soup either my husband or I had ever had. The meat selections were good, but we were left craving some other cuts we've had at other places.

We cruised over on a sunny Sunday for happy hour. My party of 3 was famished so we went to town on the happy hour menu; available everyday 3pm-6pm and again at 10pm-12:45am) - the HH menu isn't huge, but it had a good variety so we stuck to it. 

They only offer complimentary side dishes (banchan) with a minimum of 2 BBQ dishes per person, but we had no problem meeting that quota. All of the sides offered were fresh and flavorful - we also enjoyed extra rounds. Also, they offered 3 dipping sauces light, medium, and a dark one. They were all tasty but my favorite was definitely the darkest one - it was salty, sweet and a bit spicy. 

HH items we tried:
Cream cheese wontons - 4/5
Sweet corn - 5/5 (very sweet and buttery but tiny)
Mushroom medley with butter - 4/5
Garlic in butter - 5/5
Jalapeno poppers - 5/5 (delicious)
Korean chicken cheese fondue - 3/5
Spicy pork - 4/5
Pork belly - 5/5 (we loved this the most!)
Bulgogi - 3/5

When dining outside of happy hour, the regular menu is massive so I'm sure you will be able to find something, even for the the pickiest of eaters. Also, pricing seemed fairly competitive with Gyu-Kaku (their direct competitor.) The grill tops and ventilation setup at each table worked very well; they conveniently changed out our charred grill per our request and the restaurant wasn't smokey or smelly.

After the feast you know we all needed a cup of caffeine to snap us out of the food coma.

We walked in and kind of stood by the door waiting for someone to come greet us. It seems like the entire staff was on their break or something. Perhaps I am not with the Vegas lifestyle, and people don't come in to eat at 1:00 PM? Maybe we missed the lunch rush? Was no one working? It took a bit for someone to seat us. After we sat down, it was like they forgot we were there. We had to get up and find someone to explain the menu, take our order, change our grill, and re-fill our water.

My family and I are from Hawaii and we were dying for some Korean food. We came around 8 pm and the waited around 30 minutes. The wait was supposed to be longer but lots of people left because they were waiting longer than is. Hence why we got to sit down pretty fast. The ambiance is nice, modern and up to date (as far as furniture and music). Booths against the wall can easily sit up to 6 people, tables in the middle 4, and they also have one private room/section that can fit a big party. 

The guy who sat us was very nice and welcoming. But I feel like the servers, I wouldn't say rude but the tone in their voice and the way they talked to us didn't seemed nice. For example: I asked ""what kind of sauce is this?"" While oiling the grill, our waiter quickly cut me off at the end of my question and said ""yeah hold on, let me do this first and I'll explain it."" In a sort of rude tone. Even when my dad asked about the yelp offer the waiter cuts him off mid sentence, ""oh yeah the yelp thing, we'll do that later"" in that same rude tone.

The place was 50% full when we went there round 8pm. However, I think this place draws a late crowd as it is open until 2 am. Attractive staff and modern style furnished the space. 

Be aware when sitting down. Check for water from the exhaust hood above. As Korean BBQ gets hot and the ac runs cold to keep it cool, condensation builds and can drip on to the table or seat. The underside of my shorts got wet when I slid into the bench style seat. (-1 star).

This place is good for 2-4, and larger tables of 8 are in the back. Super fast service! Don't be shy to flag the servers down. 3 people ran the front of the house. All 3 were at out table at some point.

We ordered a set combination of things and every bit was great. They prepared bibimbap table side and opened our mushroom foil pouch too. The grill didn't get too hot but would try this place in the winter time.

After being promptly seated and minor hemming and hawing over the menu, we decided to order the meat lover's combo for 2, a hot sake, and beer for sake bombs to start our weekend. Between 3 people, we opted for the combo for 2 because we figured we could always order more and didn't want to get too gluttonous by ordering the combo for 4. 

First came the booze, then the side dishes, then all of the meat. The grill heats up very quickly, however it is only hot in the middle and burns the meat rather quickly. Also, don't bother with the onions and assorted sliced veggies; they will burn too. Those aside, my favorite was the spicy pork. Everything else was decent, but not standout. The side dishes are standard and decent too, but the waiters did not come to refill them until we flagged them down.

Their sound system is not very good. They alternated between old school hip hop/R&B and Kpop, which are both my jam but the low sound quality actually irked me a bit.

Highly recommend this place.  For the excellent service and phenomenal food.  The only reason for not 5 stars is I want to come back for a second visit soon and make sure today wasn't just a fluke. Once I do that I can hopefully upgrade my rating.",hWOY38BPw2uUKHU3l-4NUg,1,0,4,FCIik3aQ4tmd-nfsxkVVLA

2722644,2016-06-17,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"I came here for happy hour (3-6pm, 10pm- close) based on all the great reviews. We called ahead to try to make a reservation, and were told that they don't take same day reservations but they weren't busy at the time so we came in anyways. 

We ordered beef toro, bulgogi, pork belly, and mushroom medley. We also had the chicken wings, fried calamari, and jalapeño poppers for apps. Each dish was $4 with the exception of the mushrooms ($2). The meats were really good quality, and my favorite was the bulgogi which was really tender and had a great marinade. The chicken wings were average, crispy but pretty bland. The poppers were filled with cream cheese and salmon with a tempura batter. The calamari were okay as well, but the breading was disappointingly flavorless, much like the chicken wings. The dipping sauce that came with it added some much needed flavor to the dish.

The service was relatively spotty. We were seated immediately and our waiter took our order quickly. Afterwards however it was kind of difficult to get anyone's attention as the restaurant became more busy, so we had to flag down someone each time we needed something. Our appetizers also came out way after the meats, so we were pretty much done with our food by the time our last appetizer came out.

Also keep in mind rice is not included when you order dishes a la cartel for happy hour. It's $2 for a bowl and 1 bowl is enough for 2 to share.

I must admit though that I think the reviews for this place are somewhat inflated because they give you a free desert if you write and show them a posted Yelp review. To avoid the inevitable awkwardness associated with showing your server an low or average review and the fact that you are getting a free desert, I feel like people naturally give this place a higher review than they normally would. Definitely wouldn't expect this place to be averaging 4.5 stars.

I'm from OC where Korean/Japanese BBQ is abundant.  I decided to come in for a late dinner on a Thursday night with one other person.  I had tried to called earlier that day to make reservations but they didn't take any.  There was no wait when we arrived thankfully.  Once seated, we decided to go with the Gangnam Dinner ($60) out of the six options.  It included a house salad, fried dumplings, oysters, seaweed salad, miso, bibimbap, kalbi, bulgogi, choice cut, pork belly, toro, and veggies.  We also ordered extra toro and beef belly.  The best meat surprisingly was the pork belly, although it was the only one not flavored.  I also enjoyed the bulgogi.  The other cuts were average.  The bibimbap was really nothing special.  The sides were all pretty good.  The 4 oysters were gross and didn't taste that fresh.  The veggies they provided was mushrooms and bell peppers.  We also got free macaron ice creams for checking in.  

We left stuffed.  You get a lot for what you pay for.  The menu and look of the place reminds me a hell lot of Gyu Kaku.  It's very very similar.  As for service, the guy waiting on us wasn't really friendly.  It was our first time and he didn't really go over the menu with us.  We also didn't get our waters refilled and kept having to ask.

On weekends their lot can get pretty busy but, the hunt for a parking spot is worth it once you start grilling. My favorite item is the spicy pork. Leave it on the grill to get it extra crispy. Those charred edges give it a wonderfully crunchy texture to go with a moderately spicy profile. The prime kalbi was my second favorite. I loved the sweetness of the marinade that paired nicely with the natural savoriness of the marbled meat. Other items tried included tender chunks of filet, four decent sized garlic shrimp, and assorted vegetables (corn, mushrooms, peppers, onions, zucchini, and more). Portions run a little small, so it's best to order two or three items per person.

With a clean, intimate, dark interior it's great for casual date nights or just hanging out with friends or family. Tables are spaced rather far apart giving all plenty of privacy.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,4,4,WPMku3arhRKrpIzDT6aoPQ

Saw all the extraordinary yelp reviews made me super hype. What a big let down.

We had a party of 5. Arrived 7pm. Place was pack. We got on the waiting list. 2 other partys ahead. Got seated 30 mins later. 

Went ahead and order the Gangnam package for 4. $120. Spicy tofu soup $9.95. The server took our drink orders. 3 waters and 2 thai tea. Waters came out first. Thai tea came out late. When the thai tea came out with was in the smallest cup I ever seen served thai tea and it was just okay. Anyways the raw meats, sides and such came all different times. The server just drop off the mear to us and didn't help us throw the meat on the grill. All self service I guess. 

Service was bad. I clearly needed water refill badly. Empty cup on the edge of table. Servers walking past me over and over. I had to flagged one down to get a refill. Also we ask for extra rice and received it at the end. Everything seem rush. We ask for to go boxes and the server even forgot about that. 

We never got refills on the complimentary side dishes like other koream bbq spots. Their side dishes were good tho. As well as the meats we ordered. But the service totally killed it. Never again I'll go to this spot

We ordered the 2 person kbbq set, which came with 5 cuts of meat, oysters, corn, grilled mushrooms, unlimited banchan, and bulgolgi bibimbap. 

The service here is really friendly and welcoming. They help you to cut your meat and cook it if you want.  I prefer my meat to barely touch the grill so i prefer cooking my meat myself. 

The cuts were on the smaller side, so if you have a huge appetite or are super hungry you should probabaly order more.  I really liked the side salad they had, the dressing was really refreshing and light.  The bulgolgi bibimbap was too sweet for me, and i dont think i would order it again .

Food is a decent price for the variety and quality of meats, appetizers and sides. No all you can eat. But I definitely left full and satisfied with what I paid for. I feel like you can't go wrong with anything you choose. But something def worth mentioning are the desserts. The green tea cheesecake is fire. I would also suggest getting the yuzu sorbet to accompany it.

I'm an out of towner from Dallas, Tx and we have our fair share of Korean barbecue places. But this place has a meat selection very different from the ones back home. They have Kobe meat (super soft and melts in your mouth), scallops, and even duck breast. The meat here is so much more succulent, flavorful, and different from the regular short ribs and brisket.  

My boyfriend and I got the premium meats and it was really worth it! It comes with appetizers like the tuna poke, oysters, miso soup, and beef carpaccio. The oysters were good but left a weird aftertaste. The beef carpaccio was a little on the sour side and the tuna poke was super fresh. This deal also comes with the  best cut meats in the restaurant. The table will be full of your regular Korean BBQ sides like kimchi, bean sprouts, and fish cake. When they bring the meats, it may seem like a small portion but it's actually really filling for 2 people. I really appreciate that their presentation of the meats are sliced and placed carefully on decorated plates as opposed to the meats back home are slapped onto a dingy plate and cut in front of you with scissors. 

The only thing I don't like is that they don't give you advice on how to cook the meats like the Kobe beef. Service here is quick and polite. We were seated within 2 minutes and food came out in 10 minutes.",lOVu-In8ypGCZzIKYEZU7Q,6,2,4,ImCW4-4m2l23N12IAVfKQw

We ordered and tried all the dishes on the happy hour. The beef Toro and pork belly were one of our favourite.  The fondue cheese was interesting to dip the meat in. 

I liked how we each had our own individual sauces, 3 different type.  One was like a pretty ponzu, one was like a teriyaki, and another a spicy teriyaki. 

We tried the premium prime Kalbi and it was really tender.  We had to order another plate so we could each get another bite. 

The waiters are friendly and always around to take orders.

Mainly due to we don't like to have seaweed salad, dumpling and house salad. That's $10 savings there that can go toward the premium meat. We forgot to check in to get the free ice cream.

We were drawn to this restaurant because of all of the positive reviews on Yelp.  I was surprised by the volume of reviews for such a small restaurant.  Because of this, I had high expectations for my meal and was extremely  disappointed.  The food was terrible and low quality.  Luckily, the food was so bad we only ate a small portion of the meal.  Yes, we were lucky because we returned home to stomach pains.
So how does the restaurant get so many good reviews? Each table has a sign that says you will get a free desert if you show your Yelp review to a server.  No, I did not get a free desert for writing this.  If the quality of their desserts matches the quality of the meal, I have no interest in trying anything else from the menu.

This restaurant is very very efficient. We were asked if we wanted to be seated at the bar. We said yes and all of the sides and food were being handed to us at the speed of light. The only thing they didn't do is feed us so that we could get out sooner. I appreciate fast and efficient service!

I loved their spicy chicken and regular chicken!! The chicken was delicious and perfectly cooked. My friends worked on eating the beef. The restaurant gave us freshly made miso which was light and refreshing. I am so used to eating the crappy instant miso. This use of real miso paste was a welcome touch.

Gangnam is Korean with some Japanese flavors. Located next to ""get nailed"" nail salon. Open til 1am! Bring all your friends. Food was average, kind of lacking in flavor.

Not expensive but a little annoying. The drinks here were all really good and SO REFRESHING. I swear, they've made the best lychee martinis I've ever had and I wish I had their recipe. It was that good!

Down to the food - nearly all of it was nothing short of amazing. We ordered the Meat Lover's BBQ for 4 which was $99. Not a bad price for all you get. The meats were all flavorful and marinaded well. The pork belly was the only thing that could have been better - it was not as thick as some of the other places I've been. I also ordered the seafood soft tofu soup which was good but not the greatest. I still enjoyed it.

3175009,2017-12-20,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Lets start with the NOT SO GREAT.  Our server was terrible.  We came around 1pm for a late lunch, and the restaurant was full, so he asked us to have a seat in the waiting area.  It was a short wait, and about 2 minutes go by.  We hear someone yelling from across the restaurant to us, telling us to please be seated.  It was the original person that told us to have a seat in the waiting area......and he motioned his arm, with his palm up, towards the open table that had just been cleaned and set for 2.  I thought this was really rude that he couldn't even walk over (about 7 steps) and actually bring us over to our table.  We order, and my eyes are always bigger than my stomach, and he starts to tell me I have quite a bit of food, and that I can always order more if needed.  Nice of him to do that, since I don't know how big the portions are.  Our side dishes come out, then the uncooked meat comes out.  We start grilling, but he doesn't bring us anything else -- no rice, no salad, no appetizers.  Finally someone else brings the salad and our order of Jap Chae but no rice.  I'm a a Chinese dude that needs my rice, so to sit there with cooked meat that is getting cold is starting to add to my frustration with their lack of service (or common sense).  We get our rice, and then we have to remind them that they still have not brought our iced water.  So someone runs back there and gets our water and and appetizer and puts it down on the table.  We finally have everything we are supposed to get, and can now eat, but now, I'm really annoyed at how terrible the service has been.  In addition, the table next to me had to constantly ask the wait staff for stuff, as if they were brand new waiters or something.   I mean simple stuff like refill waters, bring extra napkins if the existing ones are completely dirty, etc.  Its not rocket science.  But about 5-6 times during lunch the next table had to ask for this simple stuff.  

Food:  Everything we ordered was really good.  In fact if service was half decent I would have even said the food was fantastic, but its really hard to enjoy a meal if you are pissed off at how shitty the service was.  One mistake is ok.....2 is forgivable, but it was like they were PURPOSELY trying to do a shitty job.  

We ordered the lunch special which came with white rice and either 1 or  2 Proteins -- we chose the Spicy Pork and Bulgogi.  Both were good.
I did the Jap Chae and 2 ""a la carte"" proteins -- Kobe Style and Korean Prime Kalbi (marinated).  Kobe was SUPER tender and just a great piece of meat.  Prime Kalbi was also a hit.  Sides were great, especially the pickled cucumbers and fish cake.   

After we finished our lunch, we realized that NO ONE had even checked up on us once during the entire meal.  Yes, they came to drop off new plates and take away empty ones, but not once did anyone say ""How is everything going?"" or ""Do you need anything else?""  In fact, the only thing that was ever said to me was ""Are you all done grilling?  If yes, I can turn off the grill.""  I actually wanted to say ""Everything was great, thanks for asking"" just to be a smart ass, but I decided against it.  And then the next question was ""Are you ready for your tab?""  I mean the waiter seriously didn't even offer us dessert, or anything else for that matter.  It brought me right back to being annoyed again, and I even debated not tipping them anything, but being a former restaurant worker, I always leave money because I know that a big portion of their pay comes from tips.  But geez man, it felt like you were intentionally working really hard to be this shitty, and it sure didnt feel like you deserved a tip, but you got one anyway.

In the end , the food is great, but just come with the expectation that your service will be somewhere between TERRIBLE and NON-EXISTENT and you will enjoy yourselves.  5 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service, so that's a total of 7.  Divide by 2 and you get 3.5.  I rounded up to 4.  You have been warned.....",NJdhxlyqtB6RuNDsZQRFhA,0,1,4,nfJnHUp5bHJye1pZi2n7Wg

**2016 Yelp 100 Challenge #9**

The place was empty & we were seated right away.  They have a PRIVATE dining area as well.  The place looked clean but I was a bit EH because I looked up & the filtration grills looked absolutely DISGUSTINGLY dusty & oily.  To the point I was scared that the dust might fall into my food....  I used to work at a  ASIAN BBQ joint so it literally looked like they haven't cleaned it for a month.  =[ 

The service was quick & fast but definitely would say they could work on smiling a bit?  Ahahahah our server was AWSOME though cuz we also knew her from the sushi resteraunt that we love so much in north Vegas!  (The second time we went the service was definitely slower even though there was no one in the place...  Like asking for water and side dishes multiple time from different people before receiving.  So maybe need a little work on the employees). 

The quality of the meat was SURPRISINGLY good! They are a Korean joint but they have the concept kind of like Japanese BBQ in style of serving.  You get a whole bunch of side dishes like any Korean resteraunt & the side dishes aren't bad at all.  They were a good amount & good quality for the amount of money you pay I would say.  I can't really say the other dishes were that great as for the NORMAL palate....  I would have to say it is a bit on the SALTIER side...  But I LOVED IT.

PRIME GALBI $8.95 - just straight up melts in your damn mouth! 

HARAMI MISO $8.95 - this is out skirt steak & loved the extra miso flavor. 

GARLIC SHRIMP W/ HEAD $5.95 - what a steal. On the price I personally think for jumbo shrimp at only $6 bux & it is lightly seasoned w/ garlic. 

ENOKI W/BACON $4.95 - no difference but you do get a lot of enoki mushrooms which is great & you get 4 pieces. 

ASPARAGUS W/ BACON $4.95
KABOCHA SQUASH $2.95 

BROCCOLI $3.95 - this comes inside a foil already steamed for you to finish off on the grill to give a little char. 

PORK TORO $5.95 - ummmmm my FAVORITE part of the pork & you get it at pretty much a $1 a slice!  Where as most places I have been to it is $2 a slice 

SPICY TUNA KIMBAP $6.95 - this is literally see weed wrapped rice & then tempura battered.  It has the PERFECT chewy texture like mochi & then stopped off w/ spicy Mayo tuna! 

CHILI SPICY WINGS $6.95 - this is what typical Korean wings taste like & I love it. 

SPICY SOFT TOFU SOUP $9.95 - I absolutely CRAVE this damn soup....  I'm sure there is some crack in it...  & doesn't really taste like your typical Korean spicy soft tofu soup but I loved it!",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,11,7,4,L9jj7Zq-93fyIx0EJIQ6Wg

I've been to Sura BBQ and Tofu hut, but they don't even compare to Gangnam. Sura is too pricey and I am a little taken back by how they place the raw meat outside.

Anywhoo, Gangnam was a nice alternate to that, since they serve you your food like Tofu Hut. However the quality of the meat is far tastier. Everything that I had was delicious! 

We ordered the beef belly, BACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS, spicy garlic edamame, fried chicken karrage and the banana tempura with ice cream. This is definitely one of the rare occasions where i can honestly say i loved every bite. The service was phenomenal and we came during happy hour. They also have a Robata special after 10pm, must try!

The proportions were excellent and presentation was beautiful. (Especially the beef belly and banana tempura)

Atmosphere is that of a high end restaurant. Dimly lit, fancy decorations, expensive looking grills, professional looking servers, & popularly hip music. What caught my attention the most was a projector showing music videos of not only well known recent English music, but they also have popular Korean groups also. I find myself dancing & singing along.

The servers are very helpful in recommending what to order. They're able to describe each dish or drink well enough to make a decision. They also give honest opinions on whether one thing is better than another thing.

The meats were served looking really fresh & presented really well on a plate. Of all the Korean barbecue places not one where I've seen the meat served already seasoned.

Not many Korean barbecue places I know have a Happy Hour or lunch special. This place has pretty good deals on their appetizers & meat. For the money you spend at all you can eat places, you'll have a better experience here compared to any other Korean barbecue place in Vegas. Drinks, meats, food, desserts - you can definitely taste the difference in quality & you can even make others jealous with a picture of a nice presentation too!",-FC7GYjN6R8fPsWqx00H8A,4,1,5,4XmRQ3YonUB1D6fu4Hy0Yw

TIP: In case you want 1 free dessert during your visit, you have to show a posted Yelp review to your server! Just SHOW it!

Location (4/5): The restaurant locates in a corner of a big plaza. Watch out for the big Gangnam sign! From the outside, the restaurant looks pretty dark but it becomes divey when you walk inside.

Services (5/5): We came at 7pm in a party of 7 and quickly get situated! Our server was very friendly. She was also quick at prepping for our BBQ and bringing out side dishes! Since we came in a large group, they also helped us to calculate 18% gratitude fee in the bill. 

Food (4/5): You have the choices of ordering individual dishes or order a set such as Las Vegas, Meat Lover, Gangnam (#1 bestseller) and Premium (best cuts). All sets come available for 2, 4 or 6 people with different prices. We ordered Meat Lover for 4 people for a party of 6 adults and 1 child. The portions were huge! It also came with complimentary side dishes, miso soups, rice bowls, salads and dumplings. It was more than enough for us! We also ordered the Kobe Beef Carpaccio ($9.95) and Salmon Carpaccio ($7.95). The Kobe beef was literally melting in my mouth! Soooooo sofffttt! The salmon, on the other hand, added a hint of freshness in a jungle of grilled meat! For dessert, we shared a vanilla macaron ice cream from Brick's! They have the macaron ice cream fridge right at the door, so give it a try if you need a togo dessert!

My buddy and I ordered pork off the lunch set menu (looked like pork shoulder), and it was really chewy for me at first (even though it was fully cooked).

We also tried the chicken wings, steamed dumplings, and the spicy tuna kimbap. The chicken wings were tasty and flavorful.

The servers here seem to be pretty nice and the customer service is pretty good. I didn't have any issues with ordering food or having things come out too late. 

The meat quality is alright. I ordered the Korean Prime Kalbi, Prime Kalbi, and Harami Miso which looked amazing, but it was the ultimate blue ball. They were well marbled which I loved, but it was surprisingly tough... what a disappointment. The beef looked to be on par with that of Magal Korean BBQ, but when you bite into it, you can tell that there is a huge difference in quality. The banchan here was surprisingly good, but the bibim nangmyun was not quite where I wanted it to be. They need to put less chilled broth in it because it was almost indistinguishable from mul nangmyun. 

The only redeeming quality of this place is the price. I ordered 3 plates of beef and an order of Bibim Nangmyun and it came out to roughly $50 with tax and tip. If I were to order the same stuff at Magal, it would be roughly $80 to $90.

All in all, this is a so-so korean bbq spot that made me reminiscent of home, but it was nothing spectacular. The service is good, but the beef quality is forgettable. After my experience here, I was wondering how so many people could think this place is so damn amazing, but then I saw a little sign on our table. They offer free macaron ice cream for every review that is written. They pretty much bribe people into writing good reviews for a free dessert. 

If you come here looking for Korean BBQ nirvana, keep on looking. If you want a moderately priced and decent quality BBQ joint, this may be for you. Just don't expect amazing things from here.",swqSj4zuamI_HFfPTj63Hg,2,0,3,9WuU3ryfn473KrwrYL0Tqw

Went in for the first time . Saw a posted sign at the register advertising a three peice tender combo meal for $5 bucks . 
I clearly pointed to the sign and told the cashier I would have the $5 combo special.  She rang up my order and charged me $7.46 . I took the food to my table and looked at the receipt thinking the combo special probably didn't include the soda . But why would soda be an extra $2. 46 ?   
I told the cashier I thought the combo was $5 dollars ? She said "" oh that special starts at 7 pm . I asked her to tell me the time since I didn't wear a watch . It was 6:48 pm . I asked her if she could reimburse the difference . I had assumed it was already 7 pm (my fault ) . 
She went to get someone else . The manager ? Shift supervisor ? Obviously someone who was in charge .  I explained that it was my fault for not knowing the proper time . But since I had clearly pointed to the sign when placing the order , I should've been told that it was 12 minutes too early to receive that special .
In a not so friendly manner told me he was unable to refund the difference.
I asked him if I didn't like the taste of the food or if the food was too cold would he refund the entire price ? He said yes . So I then told him the food was cold and he gave me a very slow and drawn out refund for the entire amount . Plus then he took the plate of food which I had already handled and put it neatly back on the kitchen where I'm assuming he planned on re selling it . ( health code violation) .
So for the difference of $2 dollars and 12 minutes in time ... He would rather refund the Entire price of the meal , and also lose a customer forever ? No problem . This is Las Vegas and we have many different  choices on each block to choose from.  The reason I give ONE Star and will never come back is the poor customer service combined with him not throwing away the food I had already handled .",ats8qvpIrTawAhgXmDUg8w,1,0,1,iXM5XAVwmUbAYb7m32V8Ug

It has a nice, dark, and clean ambiance. I'm not too sure on the dynamics of this establishment. We were the ones manning the grill, which I had no problem with. I've had places where an angry looking Korean lady snatches the tongs away and takes over. It wasn't the usual AYCE but I'll still pho'ks with it. 

The dishes we sampled was the carpaccio, pork belly, brisket, filet mignon, and prime kalbi.

I saw on Yelp that this place had beef carpaccio. Ever since Woonam Jung stopped serving carpaccio, I've been looking for another joint to replace that empty spot in my heart. Gangnam's carpaccio wasn't as extravagant as Woonam's, but just as good. Served on an oily sauce and some greens on top. Simple and delicious. This was my favorite during the feeding.

The pork belly and brisket. What can you say? It's always good. There is nothing special about these other than the pork belly being thick. Dip them things in the sesame -salt & pepper concoction and you got a happy customer. 

ALRIGHTY THEN!  Now to the beef. The filet mignon was good and tender. We cooked it quickly to a nice medium rare. It was perfect! Again, I'm glad we were manning the grill. These could have easily been over cooked and ruined. We actually got another order of the filet mignon. The server finally brings in the prime kalbi. He says that this is their signature dish. It was very tender and sweet, but it didn't leave an everlasting impression with my palate. Would I still pho'ks with it?  Sure. The first four orders is a definate though. So in the end, the crack that will have me on the come back is the carpaccio and the filet mignon. WINNER!

The wait time for a table was quoted at ~35 minutes, so we bellied up to the bar for some pre-meal drinks and appetizers - the chili dumplings, shishito peppers, and (one of my personal favorite appetizers) the dynamite shrimp.  The three dishes were perfect amount to share among the three of us, and we all enjoyed each one - the dynamite shrimp was especially a hit as neither of my friends had ever had it before.

We were seated almost immediately after on round of appetizers were polished off. I didn't check the time, but it had to be pretty close to the quoted wait time - an impressive feat, given that Korean BBQ is more prone to people lingering at tables given its interactive and social nature.

The menu features options for pre-built combos (containing a mix of starters, meats, and sides), however we opted for ordering a la carte so that we could each try specific items (and we had already had a round of appetizers).  I ordered the spicy pork and the Korean Prime Kalbi, as well as a bowl of sukiyaki noodles (beef).  The Kalbi was flavorful, tender, and easy to cook.  The spicy pork had excellent flavor and a nice kick, but I'm a bit paranoid about cooking pork so I probably over-did it a bit.  The sukiyaki noodle bowl was a perfect way to fill out the meal - much needed after a long day of walking around the strip.

The atmosphere was upbeat and we had a great time. All three of us left stuffed to the gills and all-in (with 3 appetizers, 2 beers each, our various BBQ selections, and my noodles) our bill came to just over $100 - a pretty fantastic deal for a great social meal.  

I highly recommend Gangnam to cap your long Vegas day.",6--wberg4DYU3uHtgUuvYw,2,0,5,0nk7LEyxFxKzBXmSQokf6w

Took a taxi here from the Strip.

PARKING
=======
Packed strip mall.

AMBIANCE
=========
Videos of hip hop and K-pop.
Dark and limited booth seating.
Staff was friendly enough.

FOOD
=====
LUNCH FOR 2 - GANGNAM COMBO - $65
Yes, that's a lot of food and pricey for 2 people at lunch
(in East LV, more or less).

MEATS
Favorite was the prime kalbi - everything else was tough.
RATING: 3/5

Favorite was their BEEF CARPACCIO. 
RATING: 4/5

BANCHAN
Not super fresh (I'm spoiled in LA)
and underwhelming, except for the tofu and salad.
RATING: 3/5

RICE AND MEATS
Decent and delicious with fatty bits.
RATING: 4/5

BEVERAGE
=========
HOUSE SAKE (COLD)
OK, at best. Not smooth.
RATING: 3/5

SERVICE
=======
Felt somewhat rushed at times.
Never refilled any of our banchan.
The guy kept coming back and forth after we told him 
that we were hanging out for a bit and pacing ourselves.
There was no line, no people waiting, I didn't understand the rush.
RATING: 3/5

Does not hold a candle to LA's KBBQ joints. #sorrynotsorry
CANNOT BELIEVE how many people gave this place 5 stars. 

NOT RECOMMEND, if you're that drunk, eat pho instead.

The good: The seafood tofu soup had great flavor but it was seriously the smallest portion I've ever seen in any Korean restaurant.  The original bibimbap was yummy (nothing extraordinary but solid and at least normal portion size).  The chocolate lava cake was delicious.  Warm and gooey. 

The not so good: side dishes were icky.  So sad because half the fun of Korean food are the yummy side dishes.  The seafood pancake was tiny and for $9.50, so not worth it.   We are normally huge fans of seafood pancake but just so tiny here (two small silver dollar pancake size ones and at most places you get one the size of a dinner plate).   The pork belly app was so so.  

Our waitress was really nice though it took a while to get seated and for someone to come and take our order.

We were in the area and decided to give this spot with over 4,000 reviews a try. We had big expectations! Perhaps this spot is a hit with tourists but we weren't impressed. First of all,  it irritates me as a culinary professional when restaurants use culinary terminology so loosely. I ordered Sukiyaki Noodle with Beef. If you know Japanese cuisine you know Sukiyaki. I was expecting noodles along with something that resembles Sukiyaki. After all that's what it's called, right? What I got was stir fried noodles with chunks of beef and sliced red peppers served in a stone pot. What is so Sukiyaki about this? Nothing in this dish is anything you would find in Sukiyaki. In Sukiyaki, the beef is thinly sliced rib eye and there is no red bell peppers in it but rather, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, onions, green onions, tofu, bamboo and yam noodles. More appropriately this should be called Yaki Noodle with Beef which simply is stir fried noodles. It looked nothing like the photo on the menu and the portion was very small. My mom had the bean paste soup and it was nothing special. The pickles were bland and lacking any flavor. We ate our lunch but knew we would not come back again. The service? My tea cup sat empty without any question if we would like more hot water.  I finally asked for more hot water since I was never offered it. For $2.50 for each hot tea?

We ordered the gangnam for 2 for a family of 3 with leftovers to box. Since we came out of town, we asked for a side of kimchi to take back to the hotel and they were more than welcome to do so. They gave us a tub of kimchi and extra utensils to use after. The meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful. They even had brown rice for our little one. But I would say the kimchi was the best part. It's sooooo hard to find authentic fermented kimchi that pairs well with meat. It was fermented to perfection and would've love to have a huge tub to buy to use at home for stews and other Korean recipes.

SERVICE - Very friendly and accommodating staff. We were able to substitute items in the pre-set menu and even customize my cocktail to the way I like it :)

AMBIENCE - Casual and cozy (especially sitting at a booth), very relaxed, great for couples or families

FOOD - We ordered the [PREMIUM SET - $89.95] for 2 which was a lot of food and variety with both Japanese & Korean BBQ. Even the appetizers were all amazing. Definitely get what you pay for. It was the perfect indulgence while visiting Vegas :) 

[KOBE SSAM] - Uni on top of a piece of kobe beef with fresh wasabi. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. SO GOOD.

3630596,2015-07-12,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Nice place for a first date as the seats are fairly far apart in the booths to allow room for the bbq pit in the middle of the table. A good way to keeps hands busy as well throughout the meal (not a chance of awkward hand holding) but dimly lit enough to make it feel intimate. 

Being overly prepared we called in advance and made a reservation for two along with a toddler requiring a booster seat. Upon arrival right before the dinner rush around 2:45 pm Saturday we were promptly seated and greeted and drinks came out immediately afterwards. Seemed to be the best time to come because it was empty when we first got in and filled right up starting at 3:15. The ice tea was delicious, we had refills. I noticed that the booths basically were benches and were kind of uncomfortable, with a very utilitarian feel that assured me that men probably love flocking here for happy hour with their buddies. I was not wrong once I saw the happy hour menu as it was mostly geared towards beers. We dove right into the menu and ordered pork belly and marinated Kalbi strips to bbq with rice on the side ($1.95) and I ordered the Korean soft tofu soup with seafood. 

Our server was attentive, not overtly friendly but helpful. Since it was just us two girls and we don't eat much we didn't get any appetizers or dessert. The first thing to come out first were the sides, which you get complimentary if you order at least two bbq dishes. There was a variety of them, what I noticed was the pickled vegetables were good, the kimchi was great and the bean sprouts were bland, but that was fine with me. Throwing them in the marinade they provide for dipping might help. Then our meats and my soup arrived. Oh my, delicious. We threw the meats on and I dug into my stew and it was instant love. Although the stone pot it comes in may seem small, the portion was perfect for me. The chef made it perfectly spicy, with a kick of kimchi taste and an egg cracked right in. There was a respectable amount of seafood in there which I appreciated, and the meats, once seared with a nice crust, were super yummy. I only needed half of the large helping of rice that came with my soup before I was full. 

I then turned to the sangria which I order partway through my meal just to try. It was delicious, but made with a dry red wine I didn't love, with blueberries and raspberries floating within. Perfect sweetness though so no complaints, I'm just more of a non-dry white wine person. If you enjoy red, get the sangria. If not, the plum wine might be a better choice as I love Asian plum wines, plus it's cheaper. As a side note, the women's restrooms are well-kept and clean but no place to change your baby so not too friendly for families with babies. 

Overall, thoroughly satisfied with the experience we had there is go back again. The only reason for the one star deduction was that it was a great experience but didn't knock my socks off with value for the price. I would go back though.

We have a neighborhood in Santa Clara on El Camino filled with great Korean restaurants on both sides of the street. 

There were 4 of us, so we doubled up on the Gangnam dinner and we ordered the steamed egg. They delivered the meats promptly and it was plenty of food. I just didn't think the meat was well seasoned and high quality. It was just okay. We were almost done with cooking and eating the meat and the steamed egg still haven't arrived. We asked our server and a few minutes later, it came out. Unfortunately, the egg was completely overlooked. It was already deflated. The other ones we saw on the other tables seem way better than ours. Seems someone forgot to take it out.

We ordered a combination that allowed us to try just about everything they had on the menu.  The only items that I would have given more than two stars were the bulgogi and some fried chicken bites in a spicy sauce.  The scallops we ordered were not cooked properly (almost raw) and had a bit of funky fishy taste to them (in an old scallop way).  The service was very poor and quite slow.  When we brought the quality of the scallops to our server's attention, he commented ""well, that just how they are here.""

Mixxed veggies are a good choice for sides, kimchee, japanese pepper, mushroom, and asparagus. The stuff with the cheese sides aren't really worth it. I wasn't too fond of the whole cheese dipping thing, and didn't end up using it. 

For the combos, the first time we came, we ordered the Paradise combo. It says it's good for two people, but we split this with a family of four. We don't eat a lot, but it was still enough to fill us up! Well, we also ordered calamari (which was also good! especially their sauce!) and their fried dumplings (beware. it's really spicy).

This place is pretty hip, they also have a nice private room for a big party. They feature this big projector screen that plays a mixture of popular music videos from here and Korea. The Korean music videos are so fun to watch even if I don't understand the language. It's a good way to help the time pass. 

It's a fun hip place to go to, but every time I go it's barely full. Maybe one or two areas are taken.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,3,2,4,EsoO19sFGARaoDxvFgWGIw

3700493,2016-05-16,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Okay yelpers here's my review. We ordered the following:

1. Harami miso
2. Korean prime Kalbi 
3. Prime Kalbi
4. Kobe Ssam (Uni dish)
5. Uni Bibimbap
6. Spicy soft tofu soup
7. Side of white rice 

Total bill came out to $78.52 for 2 of us before tax  so $90ish after 15% tip. 

I would say the food was 3/4 Korean and 1/4 Japanese style bbq. Korean sides are free and unlimited and if u ""volunteer"" writing a yelp review u get a free dessert  not the reason I am writing one but hey free is free...

Overall value & price I would say 4.5 out of 5 but with the good customer service it bumps to a 5! Would come back here next time I'm in town! :)


2 days later:

I love the uni bibimbap so much I had to come back here again & get it to go for the road home lol. I had some left over from the 1st time here and  it was still delicious cold. The service person on the phone was pleasant  and helpful. He recommended the bulgolgi bibimbop for the hubby! Will keep u posted on how the food tastes in the car

So here we are in Vegas again May 2016 :)

We're about to drive back home but had to stop for my favorite uni bibimbap!! This dish is served in a stone hot pot so the rice has a nice toasty taste with good amount of uni. 

The quality of meat is pretty good for AYCE place but we usually order a la carte so we don't overeat before we get on the road lol. 

We refer all our families and friends who are in town visiting to eat here! ;)

When we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately by the host/server. He was very polite and, thank goodness, spoke really good English! 
We already looked at some of the stuff on their menu before we got there so we had a pretty good idea of what to order. 
We ordered a few choice of meats: Bulgogi, flat iron garlic, beef toro, Korean prime rib kalbi, and the Harami Miso. The last two I mentioned were definitely a must have and it's also in the top two of their best sellers. The meat was really great quality and flavor was perfect. 
They also had three different meat sauces that they provide which is perfect for the other meats that may not already be seasoned. 
I love the little booths that they had as well. Only thing I probably would improve from this place is to have refillable hot tea and to have the sesame oil with salt side as something already provided for. I've never been to an Asian BBQ place that doesn't already do that so I guess that's why I mentioned that.

Instead, they offered me black or green tea ... which was brought out as a cup of hot water with a tea bag in it.  Very disappointing.  Should have left right then and there.  Asian place that serves tea like that can't be good. 

We ordered three beef sides for our bbq.  Banchan included macaroni salad (?!?) and old, soft kimchi. The meats were tender and had good flavor, but the portion sizes were so small!  These were the smallest portion sizes I have ever had in a Korean bbq place. We also ordered lettuce and miso paste side ($2.50) to make bbq wraps, but what we got was celery sticks and romaine lettuce.  How do you wrap romaine lettuce?  In total, we spent ~$50 and left filled with mostly rice... 

Service: although served relatively fast, the waiter never stopped by to ask if we need a refill (water, sides) on anything.

The prices are pretty reasonable, although I know most of you will whine that they aren't AYCE. They have slightly lower prices on certain meats during lunch and happy hour. I started off with the typical pork belly, beef brisket and seaweed salad. I must say the quality of meats is a step above the other AYCE places on Spring Mtn. hence you get what you pay for. Both meats were very delicious and I was still a tad bit hungry so my server recommended to me pork toro. The meat was just okay and I actually prefer the pork belly instead of this, plus it's cheaper too. The service was good for the most part, but since the place was empty, at one point the server and host both disappeared on me, which delayed me from ordering my second round of meat. It wasn't too big a deal because someone eventually appeared again in the dinning room. I live really close to this place and I will probably be coming more often. This is a perfect option if you want Korean BBQ, but your waistline can't afford to do AYCE. Also a nice place for lunch, because if I would of stuck to the beef brisket, pork belly and rice my bill would of been around $10.

Ordered cream cheese wonton, mushroom medly, jalapeño poppers, calamari, pork belly, beef toro, spicy pork and Korean chicken cheese fondue.

Cream cheese wonton: All it was is wonton wrapper with literally only cream cheese inside, fried and served with sweet sauce. Pretty bland and disappointing. 1/5

Mushroom medly: Just different types of mushrooms that was mixed with melted butter. 2/5

Jalapeño poppers: Pop of deliciousness! Jalapeño sliced in half stuffed with cream cheese and crab and deep friend drizzle with sweet dressing. 5/5

Calamari: Crispy calamari with the spicy mayo dip sauce, average. 3/5

Pork belly: So good, you can never go wrong with pork belly. Slapped this on the grill and once crispy on both sides... With rice it's amazing. 5/5

Beef toro: Basically brisket... My friend enjoyed this very much. 4/5

Spicy pork: Meh 2/5

Chicken cheese fondue: Grilled the chicken and cheese however once dipped into cheese it was way chunky and not good. Aye the chicken alone. 1/5

Overall the food was ok, but I prefer Korean BBQ at tofu hut. The dipping sauces don't really stand out to me, one was sweet and one  is spicy... But I still love my sesame dipping sauce at tofu hut. The quality of meat is better but as far as the taste, tofu hut is way better. I didn't know during happy hour they don't give you rice? I had to ask for rice for both of us, but my server only came back with one bowl of rice... So we split the rice. 

Overall, this place is good... My first time trying Japanese BBQ.",17f-n5Rouu89FSKuc4c7xw,6,3,3,1T1qqpNDsppIw4ptCkBoPA

What makes this place good is that the service is attentive and the prices are affordable, especially during their happy hours that run from 3-6pm and 10pm-close. The HH is worth going to if you plan on eating a lot and drink alcohol. I don't drink that much alcohol anymore so when I'm in LV you can catch me here beyond HH.

The variety of the food items is pretty stellar also. I'll admit the value isn't as great as some AYCE Korean places like Gen but the quality is good and taste better than what I've had in LV before going here. The atmosphere is pretty cozy also. I like the hugeness of the booths and the quality of the grill that cooks my food. I highly recommend this place if you are looking to eat off the strip or away from Chinatown.

Plus, they give you a free dessert if you write a review of the place. No, I'm not being bought off my rating with a dessert it really is what I think of the place.  It doesn't hurt that they offer this for new reviews of the restaurant though...nice!

This restaurant popped up and had almost 3,000 reviews?! You have got to be kidding me.. that is a lot of reviews, so of course.. we HAD to try it and let me tell you, it was not a disappointment. 

We got there around 7:10pm and there was a little wait.. maybe 20 or so minutes. Not too bad because they were filled. 

We ordered the Gangnam special but added spicy garlic fatty meat, japche, and bulgogi fried rice. We ordered calamari and fried dumplings for appetizers too. The food is absolutely delicious, but my only itty bitty complaint is the calamari was kind of bland... but everything else was soooo good!! All of the meats were flavorful and extremely tender. Everything was just on point and the service was great too. On yelp, there was also an option to get a free macaron ice cream with checking in and we were able to get 3 of them.

They liked the fact that we prepared our own food. They even had forks for these poor souls.

The outcome was that everyone had a great time and wanted to come back again when we return to Las Vegas for next year's convention.

It's off of Paradise and Harmon, just across the way from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (in the same area as the CVS).  We had to call because we didn't see a sign  in the advertisement section, but it's there!  

When we arrived it was happy hour.  Their happy hour beer was INSANE!  We paid $8.50 for a pitcher of beer!  $8.50!!!  Our server was so awesome!  Since this was our first time here she helped us figure out what we wanted on the menu AND also helped with putting the meat on the grill and letting us know when it was ready.  This was probably one of the most reasonably priced and filling meals we had in Vegas!  They're meal for two combos are huge!  Don't be afraid to ask for their help (cooking or picking something to eat), everyone is really nice!  The ambiance is really good too! When we were on our way out there was a bit of a line, so I definitely recommend calling ahead and making some sort of reservation.

The only caution would be the meat portions are VERY small. For example, the prime galbi only comes out to be like 4 or 5 tiny pieces....bulgogi portion was also very small...I killed it in literally two bites.....if you want to get more meat, stick with samgyupsal because it looked like they give you more portion for pork meats.

Before that came out you also get lucky  #7 banchans and the kimchi was perfectly fermented, stir fried fish cakes, cucumber kimchi, ojingeo muchim, spicy beans sprouts, pickled radish w/jalapeños and the famous pasta salad (or potato salad at other Korean places).

We had 5 meats.  All of them were good.  The Bulgogi was a little too salty, but still decent.  The only downside was that they didn't change our grill.

Overall though, considering the cost, the quality of meat, and the amount of food you get, this is a solid recommendation if you are looking for korean bbq in Vegas.",dtgl2P30tNcF3_1HQp5JJg,0,0,5,etviybuZx8nomeJtPM6Jxw

Great appetizers, tons of meats to try, REVERSE HAPPY HOUR 10pm to close. Even if you got something you didn't like (or just messed up cooking it), the prices are great.

Spicy Tuna Kimbap:  awesome as an appetizer to start. The serving is HUGE. You won't feel shorted when you order. You may get scalp sweats, but that's a good thing. 

Chili Garlic Wings: These were fine, not the best wings you've ever had but pack plenty of meat and flavor.

Bulgogi: People seem to love this. It's not great. It's the meat I liked the least. Consistency is gummy. It's a sticky meat. Has a bit of a jerky taste to it. Impossible to really cook on the grill. It's a pass for me. 

Pork Belly: It was good. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought but it melts in your mouth. They do give you plenty of strips so it works out that way. Plenty of trays to dunk it in too.

Filet Mignon: How could you say no to this? Of course, the cuts are tender and succulent. Probably the thing that works against it is that they are THICK cuts. Eating it usually involves putting the WHOLE chunk in your mouth. But it's filet mignon, it is delicious.

Flat Iron Garlic: Great garlic flavor, thinner cuts make cooking and eating this a tad bit easier that the Filet. Plenty of meat to dip too.

But really everything we had was good. Even the Bulgogi wasn't that bad. Seems like you can't go wrong here. That's a sign of a great place to eat.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,1,2,5,Wlw03yFbK6lD3xEamjVCzA

Oh, wait! that's PSY's line. Actually, Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining is Tapa Style and not all you can eat Korean BBQ, (keep in mind, AYCE KBBQ it's not big in Vegas than it is in Cali). 

We happened to come here during their Happy Hour menu offerings. So we paid for some of the meat choices at a really good price. For that we ended up doubling are orders of the: Toro Beef, Basil Chicken, Bulgogi Beef, Spicy Pork and Pork Belly. The portions we got were good for a party of three. 

- Toro Beef: Its marbleized beef brisket and very flavorful. Not as fatty as the ones that you""ll find at cheaper Korean BBQ places. It was my favorite out of our five choices. 

- Pork Belly: Standard cut pork. Not bad at all, they were seasoned. The quality of the pork was good, and had tastiness to it. 

- Spicy Pork: Tender cut pork. Smothered in spicy sweet marinade sauce makes this super delicious. 

- Chicken Tender Basil: Tender white pieces of chicken. With touch of lemon and basil. They were simple but delicious and it accommodated well with my white rice. 

- Bulgogi Beef: Beef was really tender and marinaded with a lot of flavor, very good! 
nuff said. 

The sauces that came with these were: Spicy Soy Sauce, Sweet Soy Sauce and Ponzu Sauce. The Spicy and the Sweet Soy were good. I even combined the sauces and it even adds for more taste to the tip of your tongue. The Ponzu, was the one I enjoyed dipping my meats in. It had that vinegar, sweet flavor to it.

Overall meat quality here, Excellent! The five choices we got didn't disappoint. Every meat was tender and easy too eat. Again, they were less fatty. We enjoyed every bite that came out of the mini-grill. 

We got friendly service here. Our server was very personable, and she turned out to be a cool chick. We even got some Kimchi's on the house. Atmosphere here is modern. There is a big screen TV in one side that would play random upbeat music videos. Also there appears to be space to lounge or dance for the late night vibes. 

Even though they don't offer all you can eat. They do combinations, but anything extra outside of that, can get pricey. That's why when they offered the Happy Hour menu, we chose meats with deeper discounts and for a party of three the portions were just right, for a tab around $35.

Pleasantly surprised by the customer service. Not alot of employee but somehow very attentive with every table. Since there was a wide variety of choices on the menu, the waiter was really informative of the sauces and questions we had about the menu.

Along with good service, the food quality was pretty good. The side dishes included fish cake, macaroni salad, red sauced squid, kimchi, bean sprouts, and pickled cucumber. Pretty standard. 

For a party of 5, we ordered:
-chicken salad: random but good, comes with a honey mustard dressing
-tempura udon: standard
-house salad: 
-kimchi chigae

-Korean prime kalbi

Even if something dissapoints you, I guarantee there is another little plate that could make you happy. Which is why you should come here with a small group.

As for the yook gae jang and soon tofu, it tasted like salt with no other flavor, and totally was ruined in my opinion. The side dishes however were good.

4321170,2015-05-26,1,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"I come from Boston, where there are only a handful of Korean restaurants. Even in Boston, they do not charge extra for 'ssam/ lettuce wrap' for the meats and for the salt/ sesame oil dip. This place charges an extra $2 for the lettuce, another $1 for the sesame oil sauce, and about $1.5 each for a bowl of rice. My husband dines like a true Korean, so he had to order those sides for a complete Korean BBQ meal. I found these surcharges to be very unappealing for a Korean restaurant and won't be coming back to this restaurant for this reason. It comes off as cheap and not allowing patrons to get the full Korean BBQ dining experience. 

Quality of the meat is good, but portions are ridiculously small. The samgyupsal (pork belly) pieces are sliced very thin and contains much more fat than meat (not in an appealing way that typical pork belly fat to meat ratio contains). 

Due to their current promotion of getting a free dessert for writing a review, I believe that the ratings here are highly skewed. The waitress reads your review on the spot then gives you a dessert. I highly doubt these reviewers here are writing an honest and thoughtful review of this place.",pefC2xJ3CU22xbqHseOczw,2,1,3,ODIKQ_qJXysRnZfxVAFEqw

The service was prompt and pleasant. Unlike hobak and goong you have to grill your own meat. I rather liked grilling myself so you can pace the speed you eat.

The service was stellar, and i'm sure most readers understand the premise of the place. You get a lot of pre-marinated meats/veggies/etc brought out to you and you cook it yourself on the mini-grill. It's so easy a 7 year old could do it (or my older brother who hardly gets credit for cracking an egg).

I recommend you get one of the pre-designed samplers. We opted for The paradise A  and we got more than enough food for two.  The Harami Miso, prime kalbi, and calimari were all yummy.

I would recommend this to anyone who is staying in Las Vegas. It is located right across the street from the Hard Rock Casino, but worth the cab ride if you are staying on the strip and to lazy to walk.",rdjHsxoU-WImrSAzetq_ww,2,2,5,-xAccnkVFrC8q9wPhU2iAg

We ordered prime rib Kalbi and another Kalbi and pork belly. Holy crap.... Pork belly isn't worth .70cents a piece. Kalbi was okay. Meat was tough but marinade was good.

I am actually writing this review as we sit at this table and await our server to come by to ask if we need anything for once. Sat here for about 30 min without a single visit..... LOUSY SERVICE.

The main entree consisted of Kalbi, Bulgogi, Pork belly, Spicy pork, and the only meat i was really craving on the menu, Filet mignon! Unfortunately it was also the only meat that turned out bad with whatever marinade they used. On the another note, we had reached our belly limits. The meal filled us all perfectly with a little desert room to spare.

4525504,2018-01-09,3,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"I had high expectations due to yelp reviews, but wasn't impressed, as I've had better in Duluth, GA. We came in during a slow Friday afternoon and ordered individual items of assorted marinated meats of pork belly and galbi, and the bacon wrapped enoki (a new found love for enoki mushrooms). In my opinion, the meat portions were too small for the price you pay. I believe they were ranging $8-10 per plate with about 4-6 pieces of meats. The flavors were pretty decent, but the meat quality just wasn't there. The meat did not taste fresh, but rather like it's been a good few days (3-5) since it was fresh. The bacon wrapped enoki was delicious but was very hard to cook without everything falling apart because you have to rotate it to cook the bacon. We did end up getting rice, which is charged for (~$2 per bowl), unlike other kbbq places that provide them at no charge when requested. The banchan was meh, as I thought the options didn't complement the meal well. For desserts, my SO and I checked in on yelp for a free macaroon ice cream. We had green tea and mango. Both were decent, but we liked the mango better. In general, the macaroon seemed stale, but it was free so we can't complain.

We were treated to dinner here by a colleague during a recent convention...and wow...

Before we had gotten there, they had already ordered...some type of premium platter that feeds ~6 people...it could have fed 6 villages...

I am not sure if this is all in the platter, but this is what we had...

Salads that were, despite us not wanting to waste any stomach space on salad, we're surprisingly light, well dressed and well balanced--a very nice starter.

8 different kinds of Pan Chan...sprouts, fish cake, delicious cabbage Kim chee, perfectly crunchy cucumber Kim chee, and more..

Hawaiian Poke style ahi tuna--this was good, but there was too much other great stuff

Half shell oysters...probably the only imperfect part of the meal...not much flavor from the oysters or the toppings..

Beer

Kobe beef Carpaccio was a great way to open the main portion of the meal and was probably one of my favorites of all great things we ate

Kobe Style Beef that melts in your mouth like butter...to die for...the best part of the meal

Kal Bi perfectly marinated and as tasty as any Korean BBQ I have had

Beer

Filet mignon cubes...so tender!

Flank steak thinly sliced and delicious..

Beer

Scallops and Shrimp freshly prepared

Ice cream macaroons for dessert...strawberry, coffee, green tea, mango, maybe a few more, but by then, I was so far into food coma heaven, it didn't really matter.

There may have been some other things, but at this point, you either get what I am saying or not...one or two more dishes isn't going to make a difference :-P

Even living in the Bay Area with all the great Korean food, I would be hard-pressed to find a place to top this one...

Thankfully through Yelp I was able to find Gangnam Asian BBQ which wasn't too far from our hotel by cab ride.  The place is located in a mall looking area next to a 24 hr nail salon.  I remember this because I was amazed that they had such thing as a 24 hr nail salon.

We came around 11 at night, a pretty late dinner for us.  But we're in Vegas so thankfully there are lots of late night places to eat.  The good thing about arriving here late is that we made it to the late night happy hour.  I definitely recommend ordering from the happy hour menu!  We literally almost ordered everything from it plus a tofu soup that wasn't on their happy hour menu.  I thought it wasn't going to be enough food but boy was I wrong.  It was too much food! Although my bf can eat a lot, we still had leftovers.  All the meats were good!  Also recommend the cheese wontons. We got 2 orders of those cause my bf liked it so much.  The tofu soup had big chunks of tofu sticking out from the soup and was filled with lots of kimchee and meat inside.  They also give a variety of ban chan.  All so yummy!  I was pleasantly surprised by this place and was even happier with the price.  I would compare this place to being like Gyu-kaku but better!  Service was good, fast and food was great.

I got the feeling that all the waiters were simply very fast paced and if they thought you didn't need them, they simply scurried about their business. 

We went to Happy Hour right when it started at 3p on a Sunday. The menu is overly large and exciting which made us very indecisive. So we started off ordering only a few things with the plan to order more from there. Here's all of what we ordered and what I thought. 

Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus - pretty simple and hard to mess up. But with all the other exciting options, I'd pass on it next time. 

Sweet Cheese Corn - one of my favorites! It was sweet, but not too sweet. And adding cheese never hurts. I would definitely order this again!

Fried Wontons - This is obviously of staple of just about every Asian menu. They were yummy as always, but not noticeably different from any other place. 

Filet Mignon - Again, very simple. But so enjoyable. Be responsible and don't over-cook it! The meat quality was great and is very tender and delicious when you keep it medium rare. I would order this again. 

Bulgogi - Very easy to over-cook due to the thin slices. But if you watch it, it comes out very tender and the marinade was everything I wanted! I would definitely order this again!

Cream Cheese Wontons - The wonton wrapper was super thin and delicate. It had the perfect light Crunch before breaking through to the cream Cheese. The sweet sauce it came with was great! I would order these again!

Chicken Karrage - I had never had this anywhere. So I was surprised to see that the pieces of fried chicken were cut in all different shapes and sizes. In fact, at first I thought the waiter had brought us the wrong thing. I thought it was fried calamari! The chicken itself didn't have much flavor. But the spicy dipping sauce it came with was great! Not sure I'd bother ordering it again, though....

Korean Chicken Cheese Fondue - I enjoyed this chicken even more than I expected! I loved the Crunch that developed from grilling! While the insides remained tender. The cheese came in a little foil bowl. It was shredded and cold and immediately put of the grill. It tasted like an American cheese. I would get this chicken again. 

Vanilla Ice Cream Macaron Sandwich - the Macaron was purple and I'm not sure what flavor it was meant to be - it simply tasted sweet to me. Even after being frozen, it still had that perfect Macaron chew. And the vanilla ice cream was so creamy and smooth!

We had a great time at this place and will definitely be back to try more!",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,11,6,4,ZO_D-w4iuynhO3ZZUcIv_A

My friend took me here - she's been a few times, and thought I'd enjoy it because of the type of diet I am on for a while.
I think this restaurant is in my top 5 of all time.
Basically, you select your meats and seafoods and they bring them to your table - portions are similar to what you'd get at a Tapas place.  You grill the foods at your table.  Some of the dishes are cooked in the kitchen, but pretty much the meats are all grilled by you, at your table.
This food was absolutely some of the most delicious food I've ever eaten!  Anywhere!

I have never heard of this restaurant since they opened and oh my god... I am so glad now that I have! First of all, as a student, I think the location is great! It is literally across the street from UNLV. On my first visit here (also my first time in an asian bbq style restaurant), I was quite confused with their menu, but my server, a lovely Filipino young lady, was very helpful. She took her time explaining the different combos that they offered. I ended up getting the Meat Lover combo, which came out looking very fresh. What I loved most is that it came with miso soup, a salad, a bowl of sticky rice, and 3 different sauces for my meat. On my second visit, I had the same Filipino server. It was also during their happy hour, so select dishes were up to 50% off. I had the Meat Lover again (I can't help it--I love my meat!).

The meat came at least 15 minutes ahead of my broccoli fondu, then the fondue was overheated so half of the cheese was stuck to the container. Then they never brought our steamed rice either! After we asked about the rice, they asked us if we wanted to cancel the rice instead of taking it to go like we asked, because they were trying so hard to shove us out of the booth so they could give it to the next customer. To top off this poor dining experience, the waiter briskly dropped the check at the table without refilling my empty drink, or asking if we wanted dessert.

4694464,2015-12-23,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"We were looking for a korean restaurant for my MIL's bday.  We didn't want to overpay for crappy food at Ginseng.  So I yelped around and found this gem.  I had no idea what to expect and trusted yelp (like I do most of the time).  I called and made a reservation for 13 on a Saturday night.  The dinner turned out great and I would definitely return. For Vegas standards, this is a good KBBQ place.
Restaurant/Ambiance:  Its located right off the strip (convenient) but towards the back of the lot.  Kinda hard to see.  Restaurant is not a hole-in-the-wall type of place.  Kind of dark with all tables having a BBQ grill top.  We were fortunate enough to be given the private room in the back.  I think it can comfortably seat 15 or so with 2 grills.  It worked out well since we had a couple of small kids.  My only knock was that the table height was kinda high for the chairs.  They had tons of pillows to supplement, but made it just a tad awkward.  The place was initially empty around 5:30pm, but quickly filled up and there was a wait by the time we left around 7pm.  
Service:  Service was ok.  Not up to LA standards but decent.  I thought we would get a dedicated server for our group, but through the evening, the servers would rotate to help us out.  Grills were switched out when asked.  Here they do not cater to you and cook your meat for you (like most of the LA BBQ places).  Food came out quite rapidly.  They didn't clear out our plates, but we had a table on the side that we just set all of the empty dishes.  The banchan was never refilled (we never asked).  Water was refilled when requested.  They had a really nice birthday comp (4-5 ice cream macaroons with candle).  All in all, service was decent.
Food:  In a large group, you have to go with the preset menu.  We opted for the Gangnam BBQ package for 6 (next to highest package).  This came with a lot of appetizers and side dishes and 5 cuts of meat.  The appetizers included: oysters (good size ones and pretty fresh in quality), shishito peppers (really good per one of the guests), fried calamari (crunchy and meaty.  Nice spicy mayo dipping sauce too), miso soup, salad, and bulgogi bibimpap.  I really liked the bulgogi pap.  Basically meat and rice.  The cuts of meat included: bulgogi, kalbi, unmarinated steak, marinated/unmarinated prime steak.  I wished they would have included chadol as one of the selections.  YOu couldn't really substitute anything.  The meat quality was pretty good.  Good amount.  They also included 3 different dipping sauces. 
Value:  If it wasn't for the combo package, I think it could have gotten a tad pricey.  You have to pay for the banchan.  I requested sahm and sahm jang, and they charged me for that.  We did the 6 person combo with 10 adults.  But we ordered a lot of other things on top (udon, 2 different soups, and more rice).

All in all, a great korean BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas.  I would def make reservations ahead of time.",pJUzdorsC5BpC3q5ECi4Lg,0,0,4,3W9y7kHYAdfXPgE3lsl25g

Ok, so I am super picky when it comes to my Korean BBQ.  Which is why it took me so long to try one out until today.

Being new to Las Vegas with so many choices, I did not want to be disappointed and traumatized not wanting to try anywhere else if my first experience is bad.  However, thanks to my fellow yelpers, I uncovered the AMAZING Gangnam Asian BBQ.

Quality: 5/5
Omg! Five STARS hands down.  Everything we ordered were top quality and the marinating was perfection!  Probably one of the better Korean BBQ I've ever had.

Cleanliness: 5/5
Very clean and organize.

Price: 4/5
The price was actually good, the reason why I gave it a four and not five stars is because they charge you items that I don't feel should be charge for.  For example, you get charge for steam rice. Pretty much anything you order, you get charge, but steam rice? I am not sure about water, but I hope not. Anyhow, it's really not the fact that we get charge, just that it feels like you get that nickel and dime to death feeling. Especially when the food is so AMAZING, it's the principal. Steam rice is so darn cheap anyway.

I must say that I was expecting a charge on my refills, lemons, lime juice and sauces, but I wasn't, so it was a good surprise. The steam rice one really shocked me, I can see fried or even brown rice.  But again, it's not that big of a deal, just peculiar to me.

Customer Service: 4/5
The service was great initially and when you are about to leave.  However, during the time we were there, it was ok. The girls were not as attentive like we would like them to be. For instance, we have to flag them down regularly for refills, more sauce, new grill, etc. 

We're use to being checked on at Korean BBQ'S. Maybe that's how they role here in Las Vegas cause I remember reading a bunch of reviews at other places that has the same feedbacks.  We just have to suck it up I guess.

Tips:
Clearly, this is not an all you can eat type of Korean BBQ.  There were two of us and our bill came out to $60 with taxes, two drinks, a brown and steam rice.  But we don't eat that much, so if you are a big eater, expect to pay more.  For us, it was perfect!  

They have the BEST macaron ice cream and it's free if you check in on yelp.  We will definitely be back, the yummy food overrides the other hiccups.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,5,2,4,_CN9x022dNBuTgGfqhCXkA

The Premium Cut package features a lot of great dishes such as fresh shucked oysters, beef carpaccio in ponzu sauce, oven baked asparagus, and my personal favorite was the grilled shrimp fried rice in the clay pot (forgot the Korean name). The rice was so good that we ordered another one to share. 

The Kobe beef was pricey but well worth it - it practically melted in your mouth when cooked to a medium rare. 

The three dipping sauces they give you are nice (one was chili based, another had sesame oil and one was ponzu?) and complemented all the beef cuts really well. Overall it was an amazing BBQ from start to finish. Service was friendly and I will come here again when I'm in town.

PS: The reason why they have so many reviews is because you get a free dessert when you show them your Yelp review - however, I found the dessert to be below average (they are ice cream macarons and looked better than they taste) but that doesn't change how I feel about the awesome BBQ.

I immediately noticed the banchan (Korean side dishes placed around our table's 2 grills). They had all my favorites ranging from fish cakes, kimchi, cucumbers, macaroni salad...we ended up requesting another round :) 

My group was starving from our drive into Vegas so naturally our eyes were bigger than our stomachs when we sat down to order. Our plan was to order their prix fix menu enough to feed 10 (2 orders of Gangnam [1 order can serve 2 people for $67]; 3 orders of Meat Lover [1 order can serve 2 for $56/order]). These packages comes with a variety of starter dishes like oysters (by far, my favorite starter), salad, various cuts of meat/BBQ dishes. Our waiter, however, recommended 2 orders of each instead as it is A LOT of food. Good thing we listed because you will NOT leave hungry here. 

Oysters: I'm usually hesitant about oysters at BBQ dining establishments but surprisingly these were sweet, fresh, not too big/not too small, with green onions, ponzu sauce?, and sriracha I believe. 

Cuts of meat: they vary from Kalbi, prime rib, filet, pork belly etc. Some were heavily marinated and a bit salty but the flavor profile was on point. Due to long grilling, some cuts came out particularly dry, however, so be careful not to overcook. 

Overall - I'd definitely come back when I'm back in Vegas. Great for big groups; come hungry and leave happy :)",yjOOyV7mmegV8QeMRwi3gA,3,1,4,X2AeSUZUJ2TNRd-OIBZLxQ

We ordered 2 Meat Lovers and 2 Las Vegas to share amongst all of us. I honestly thought there would be more of the specialty meats, but there was just enough for all of us to have a little of everything. The meats were not very flavorful so I didn't actually get the names of them except for the Bulgogi which was excellent.

That was weird. Are you not able to make reservations for under 8 people or what??  Any who I got there at 10pm and there was a 30 minute wait. We were able to sit down around 1040ish and by that time the restaurant was half empty.  

TIP:  make sure you talk to a competent hostess who is able to make reservations because I've read the reviews and you're able to.  Or else go after 11pm so there's no wait.

I would give this place a 5 star, if their banchan selection was more extensive.  However, for the location, the food and the service, I will definitely be coming to this place, again and again...

A.  Location - Harmon, Swenson, Paradise.  There is a small strip mall there that has plenty of food choices and this location is perfect for so many.  Right across from Hard Rock....

B.  The Service - extremely efficient and pleasant. I came here for lunch and while it was not terribly busy, the server was just right in being very efficient, always there when you wanted her, very nice and top notch.

C.  The Menu - Loved the menu.  The cuts here are smaller in size and also more reasonable in portion and pricing. You can order a huge variety of different meats, seafood and veggies all ranging in prices form 3.00 to 12.00 per plate.  I loved the mix and match. IF I brought my glasses and had more time, I would have done this.  Instead, I turned over the menu to the combo page and pre-ordered one of the combos to make it easier for me.

D.  The Food- 

a.  Miso Soup - OK, so we are in a Korean restaurant and they serve Miso soup. I find that odd, and at same time I really cannot complain since it was tasty.  However, when I am eating BBQ, I like the real basic soup that is plain and simple.

b.  The meats - 

Chicken Tender Cheese Fondue -   OK, I am not a huge non traditional foodie, but man, this was really cool and tasty.

Bulgogi - Wow was that really fast and the sauce was PERFECT.

Filet Mignon - So tender and juicy...

Shrimp Garlic - Would have preferred Shrimp PRAWN, but these tiny morsels were okay.

Harami Miso - Man was this steak just right. Never had it before and I really enjoyed it.

Assorted Veggies - Cool. Normal stuff. but those corn on the cob were awesome.

c.The appetizers - Again, miso soup, rice, salad and some kind of cream cheese wonton thing.  Different, okay. I prefer banchan.

E.  Come back factor - This is one cool place, the food is good, the portions are manageable so you can try different things for sure.  For business lunch, hanging out, this is a really nice restaurant and I do plan to come back.  If I am focused only on the bbq, I may try Tofu Hut or other places DJK, but I really enjoyed this Gangnam BBQ.

Overall the food was good, but didn't wow me. Perhaps Korean BBQ just isn't my thing, or perhaps I need to try more of it.

Our party ordered items a la carte which came out less expensive than the preselected combo platters and allowed for ordering exactly what we wanted.

We tried three beef and two chicken meat dishes, a few vegetables and some chicken fried rice. Everything was fairly tasty. I didn't love most of the side dishes that came complimentary, but was still grateful to be able to sample a bunch of different Korean tastes. 

One of my favorite things was the ice cream macaroon at the end of the meal. 

The servers were nice but it would have helped to have been given some direction as to what we should do and what sauces and sides would be well paired together since it was the first experience doing Korean BBQ for our entire party.",a6tBYL5nqGe6CMXSjN_eDQ,0,0,3,_jyebFFSu7SdY4pTO_n-0g

My friend and I got the most basic Las Vegas package since we're hungry but obviously not capable of eating a feast by ourselves. It was $45/person and the amount of food cannot be more fulfilling. You get the tradition side dishes + a house salad, along with rice, sauces and miso soup to go along with your proteins that includes beef, spicy chicken, garlic shrimp and pork.

You are however required to cook things yourself comparing to places like Honey Pig when a server would occasionally stop by and manage your food. The place wasn't busy at the time we were dining so the servers volunteered to rotate our proteins for us as we were engaged in a deep conversation catching up on life- What a nice touch. 

The ambiance of this place is on the smaller size but comfortable at the least. The service was friendly and attentive and most importantly, the food was amazing for the price that you're paying. I wasn't sure if it was Happy Hour when we dined but when we received our tab, it only came out to be $55.

However quality is not the best. You pay for what you get. You can get full without busting your wallet... If you're a girl with a normal appetite. 

Next time I went here for lunch.  We called ahead and the person on the phone said there is lunch special available. When we came our waiter said no there isn't and said that person probably didn't know cause he was knew. I was a little annoyed but whatever. I ordered the tofu soup for 10 bucks which is a pretty reasonable deal. However when they brought it out... It was the smallest bowl of soup I've ever seen. I would call this a mug of tofu soup.. It's like the size of a side tofu soup they give you during korean bbq. So disappointed. Flavor wish it's fine.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,8,1,2,a8nP5PZq0k3NncnWtGTkeA

We've had dinner here twice, and ordered the Meat Lover's with an order of Japchae and Kabocha Tempura.  The cuts of the meat is superb, and we liked that all the meat was seasoned perfectly and quite tasty.  Japchae was solid as was the tempura.  Although it's not AYCE, we left super stuffed and satisfied.  Service was good, they worked as a team, so our glasses and banchan requests we're always attended to.  Wait times vary as our first time, we went on a Thursday at about 7:30pm and waited 30-minutes, and the last time was on a Saturday at 9pm with no wait.  I just wish they had better seating, than the wooden benches they have which are uncomfortable, then again, it's probably on purpose so people wouldn't linger.

5104147,2015-11-22,2,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"First of all - we were inspired to come to Korean BBQ after setting an ad for another place on a billboard. After Yelping some nearby options, the 1300 reviews and a 4.5 star rating, drew us in. 

At 7pm on a Saturday, we just weren't sure we could get in so we called ahead and a friendly young man answered. While they don't have a call ahead or reservation list we were able to walk right in.. Though apparently it's not uncommon to have a wait. 

After being immediately seated, we were promptly asked for our drink order. And moments after asked if we were ready to order -- through out our meal the service has been efficient,  immediate, and impeccable! 

Let's talk about the meal! 
We selected the meat lovers meal for 2, though you can order piecemeal - this included 6 meats, 7 sides, and 3 appetisers for $60 after tax. So if you aren't familiar with Korean BBQ, the premises is that they provide the food and you cook it at a grill on your table.

Breaking it down: 
APPETISERS
Miso Soup
Green Salad
Steamed Chili Dumplings
Spicy Garlic Edamame 

MEAT
Spicy pork
Bulgogi
Beef Toro
Flat Iron Garlic
Pork Belly
Filet Minion

SIDES - I am guesstimating what each of these items are, we did not get a rundown. 
Bean Sprouts - Good, nice crunch to them, and not particularly strong in flavor.
Kimchi - very flavorful without being off putting (assuming you don't dislike kimchi in general)
Fish Cakes
Jalapeños, Onion, and Ginger - they were in a mild marinade of some sort, really good when we grilled them too!
Macaroni Salad - noodles were a little soft for my taste and too mayonnaisey but my friend liked it. 
Spicy Squid (I think!) - really delicious (and I don't like seafood, at all), the dressing/marinade was flavorful, almost like the kimchi, and the texture was just right, not too chewy but hardy 
Spicy Baby Cucumbers - may have been pickled, but overall nice crunchy texture with a 
Rice - sticky and white.. Just a vehicle for everything else!
(Forgive me for the constant 'flavorful marinade' comments but I have no idea what it is... Just good! Ha!)

DESSERT
Banana Tempura
Lava Cake

SAUCES - provided in a little side dish per person! 
Spicy soy sauce
Sweet soy sauce
? Mild soy sauce-type

Now, you'll notice the extensive reviews for this restaurant... Because they offer a free dessert per Yelp review. They definitely follow through and not based on the score or content! They only check that you post it!

We stopped by while working out way down the Strip due to the high praise from fellow Yelpers. On Christmas Eve, they weren't offering their usual (less expensive lunch menu) but hats off to the hardworking crew for working over the holidays. It's a mile or so east of Planet Hollywood so plan to drive or Lyft over unless you need the exercise.

The restaurant was basically full at 2:30 in the afternoon, which we took as a good omen. The banchan (free appetizers) came out even before we ordered and included a macaroni salad alongside the more typical kim chi, pickled spiced cucumbers, bean sprout salad, pickled radish and fish cake. The bean sprouts could have used a touch more seasoning but were otherwise fine.

The meats were well seasoned, so much so that we didn't much miss the traditional dipping sauces. We ordered a bibimbop that came in the traditional stone bowl but was not hot enough rice to crisp the rice. The bulgogi that came with the bibimbop was excellent but the only other sides were hints of red peppers and onions: order only as a side to accompany your BBQ and not as a meal.

The grill and exhaust hood were carefully maintained: gleaming metal shiny clean. Bathrooms were clean as well.

Service is typical for Asian restaurants: workmanlike but not particularly friendly. A bit slow but chalk that up to the steady stream of diners.

The kids gave it a 4 so we will round up from 3 or 3.5.

Our order came with side dishes at no additional cost (kim chi, pickled cucumber, fish cake, etc...). One thing we didn't order that I wish we did, was the glass noodles (japchae). 

You grill all the meat/veggies yourself. Be sure to ask them to change the grill tray (they didn't offer for us). The Yelp check-in deal gave us a free macaron ice cream sandwich (from Brick) - I chose the green tea flavor and it was delicious!

The hubster and I just had a BIG dinner with a large bottle of sake to boot and our bill was only $25.91! Can't be at that!
We got there at 5:30pm, so it was HAPPY HOUR. We got corn, broccoli, dumplings, wontons, bulgogi, rice, spicy garlic edamame and all the kimchi sides.
It was all good. Was it the best I've ever had? No. But we really enjoyed it anyways.
The wontons are all cream cheese and the sweet and sour sauce is watery. That's my only complaint about the food.
The service was friendly and quick.
Next time we will try a dessert, for sure!

Edited to add: we still love coming here for happy hour, but I was disappointed by the portions tonight. Our macaroni salad was dry and very small. We ordered and paid for two orders of bulgogi and only got one. When we mentioned it, the server said, ""our bulgogi portions are small. Hmmm... we have been here at least ten times over the past three years and never got that little. It left a bad taste in my mouth.",WwoM6hQbgPnzcX3taqK-xQ,1,1,3,BrxdwLQC-igVwQfrJK7ymw

We had 5 ppl in our party and ordered a meal for 4 which was more than enough food for everyone. I didn't eat any rice and was completely full by the end of the meal. Also for reference I eat A LOT. The service was also very satisfactory with them changing out our bbq plate every few minutes and also serving us as quickly as possible. We also ordered a (Kimchi soup) which was more than tasty. The order included filet mignon, bulgogi, samgyupsal and other types of meat. It also came with dumplings Miso soup and salad. All of them were nice.

5291359,2017-09-26,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"A refreshing spin on Las Vegas Korean BBQ.

Environment: The restaurant is located near UNLV and the area itself is in that less-than-impressive area behind the strip but the business of the area does help to detract from the somewhat uninviting surroundings. The inside of the restaurant however is pleasantly hip and reminds me of a cross between Gen and Hobak in that there are some neon lights as well as wooden benches giving the restaurant a trendy yet homey feel. 

Food: As per usual for non-all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ spots, it's typically best to go with one of the pre-made sets, which offer a variety of meats as well as a selection of side-dishes. The one we went with seemed to be the most popular choice, and it was a little out of the ordinary compared to other restaurants. It did come with a variety of meats, along with an interesting salad, the standard Korean side dishes, and my favorites, yuzu shishito peppers and 4 oysters on half shell. Additionally, there was a bibimbap which was surprisingly delicious as well. The meats themselves were mostly marinated which was good, because the sauces we were given were underwhelming and blended into each other or did not have enough impact. They also did have a happy hour when we went in which was nice because it was a Friday night and half off any soju and beer is always a great thing.

Service: Service was appropriate and was prompt. Additionally, one of our servers was especially helpful and was helpful in changing the grill anytime we required it.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this restaurant after hearing a lot about it and not really knowing what exactly to expect, and I will most likely be coming back again soon!",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,4,0,5,CXM5p945nP8QqOxDUYo_mQ

The food is good. We got their number one seller Gangnam combo. Which would've been perfect but we never got our sides that came out with it. It says you get complimentary sides, and they just never came. We also ordered an extra side of rice, again never came. Basically when ever we ordered things, it either came out super late or not at all. Service is also slow and not attentive at all. I guess we made it inbetween shifts because near the end, we didn't see our waitress at all and a new server took the rest of our order.

But I was SO wrong. The quality of the meat blows Tofu Hut, Sura, and all those other KBBQ joints out of the water. Yeah, it's a bit pricier, but the quality definitely makes it worth it. 

The soup was delicious. It came with rice on the side, which I used to eat my meat with. THAT SALMON CARPACCIO THOUGH!! That was probably my favorite thing we ordered that night. I highly recommend giving it a try. Even the cream cheese wontons were really good!

The layout and decor of the restaurant has a modern feel to it. They have big booths along the side walls and tables in the middle. They also play American and Korean music videos on the wall.

when we finally sat down we were STARVING; luckily our free sides were already at the table waiting for us and the plates of food started flowing immediately. we ordered the Meat Lover's package for 4 people and it was so much deliciousness that we had to tap out before we could crush it all. 

highlights for me were the bulgogi, the spicy BBQ pork, the macaroni salad, the spicy cucumber, and the chili-garlic dumplings. we also checked in on Yelp for the free macaron ice-cream sandwich. (i got the coffee flavor and it was RIDIC.) 

service was great; very attentive but barely noticeable throughout the meal. (ie: whenever we wanted a refill of something it was brought very quickly, our empty plates were quietly whisked away, when we asked for a fresh grill-top it was brought over immediately, etc.) considering it was a *very* busy Christmas Day service i'd say the staff ran like a well-oiled machine. 

our total bill for the Meat Lover's package for 4 (with extra sides of asparagus & zucchini), plus chicken wings/dumplings/edamame at the bar, plus 1 beer, 2 bottles of soju, and 2 glasses of wine all came to $175 which is a pretty sweet deal imo. ($43/person + tip for a fully loaded Xmas dinner + enough booze that some of us had to Uber home? lol yes plz.) 

my family had never been to a KBBQ before so i was very excited to introduce them to a new experience and Gangnam definitely delivered! everyone left fat and happy. :)",wmtixWKF6Ou87YXtjuYv-w,2,0,5,dHYeJIq7KMQDGFvVDiOh_A

5400173,2015-07-07,1,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"This place is mediocre and extremely overhyped, and I strongly suspect that a large number of the glowing reviews were written just to get free dessert. I gotta admit I nearly did this myself--it would be awkward to show the server a two-star review when asking for a free dessert, wouldn't it? That's how they getcha.

We ordered the Meat Lover's BBQ for two, which at ~$56 for a single serving of meat, was obscenely overpriced. In cities with good Korean restaurants and more competition, you can get all-you-can-eat BBQ for $20/person. To top it off, the $56 doesn't even get you lettuce wraps, ssamjang, or sesame oil--you have to pay extra for each. Are you kidding me?

The meat itself was good. I mean, it's hard to mess up raw meat. However, the grill was electric! That was a first for me, and yet another disappointment with this restaurant. The meat obviously came out with no grill flavor whatsoever, and I could have cooked it better at home.

Our waitress was nice, and she was very good at topping up our water. However, not once did she offer to refill any of the banchan, so we ended up paying $56 for a single serving of meat AND sides. Lastly, she dropped off the check before we were even done, and I had to make several attempts to flag her down so that we could order dessert. She didn't clear the table for dessert, and we had to awkwardly share it among a bunch of empty dishes and leftover food, hunched over the giant table.",3MRNHa9sYyufDkikRE1ceA,0,0,2,acDbU9m_p3mMkXQQIWUs7g

It's pretty much salmon sashimi with ponzu sauce. We also liked the japchae...very flavorful and full of assorted veggies. 

The filet mignon was tough and chewy so we didn't' enjoy it as much. The spicy tuna kimbap was okay...there was too much rice for me. I didn't realize it's just spicy tuna over deep fried rice. We also ordered the yuzu soju, but it tasted watered down. I was kind of skeptical because the menu shows that its yellow...but the one we got was clear (like the lemon soju)

I would definitely come again if I was in Vegas. Our hotel was on the strip, so the cab ride was only about 15 minutes...I think it cost around $13-16.",8Bh5itfbiR_TR1aK03HSfw,2,3,5,9d05NXA0lOj2orZjYIIsJA

5431646,2014-03-28,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Whenever I'm in a big enough city, I start craving Korean food.  The GF had heard from some other folks that we should go to Sura, which we had gone to a few weeks earlier.  Sura was fine, but not good/great.

I had flown into Vegas, and per a mutual agreement, had not made any special Valentine's Day plans.  We ended up here for dinner, and there were probably 3 or 4 open tables.  We were quickly seated in the modern looking space.

The menu was interesting - they had the standard combo items, where you get a mix of meat and sides, but apparently when we were there it was happy hour, and they had items that were priced in the $3 to $8 so that you'd order a serving of beef toro, spicy pork, sides, etc  - almost felt like a tapas place, though obviously meat heavy.

Quality of the meat seemed a little better than Sura.  We were a little surprised that the kalbi/short-ribs had the bones removed, but that was fine.  All the meat and sides we had were good, and the gas grill worked fine.  I was also glad to see that they had spicy cucumber as a side, which is one of my favorite forms of kimchi.

The small plate style of ordering probably kept us from over-eating as much as an AYCE joint, but I was feeling nearly as full.

The one miss we had was that we had ordered white rice, but it didn't come out till we were almost done (which had included a second round of ordering).  I had asked about it earlier to one of the staff, and they nodded, and wandered away like they were on it, but didn't bring out any rice.  My guess is that they had gotten slammed at some point, and ran out of rice, so they had to make more, but that's only a guess.  No one said anything, and when they did bring out the rice near the end of the meal.

Overall, our damage with tip was an even $50, which was considerably less than the $72 we had spent at Sura, and I left feeling more satisfied with my meal.",fpiirm8MU_hSJBjHpbtIUA,1,0,4,cg5XAjdvHdlnUSJU-VBrhQ

I use to love this place I loved it so much that Friday I decided to take my cousin and her bf who have never been to Loren BBQ before for their first experience and it ended in something I'd never imagined ! Our dinner was great as we were getting our check the waiter asked if we wanted dessert and of corse my son says yes as he saw the macaroon ice creams in the front by the door  waiter says if you have a yelp just check in and it's free . So of corse I do and down hill goes our night . A couple minutes later as we're eating desert another waiter comes over and says o have a phone call and I look at him confused as to why because he barely knows my name and no I know would know I'm there or have a urgent reason as to why the wouldn't call my phone so I get the phone as the waiter insist it's a emergency (here I'm thinking it's some joke or I won something ) then I answer and it's some random person claiming to be the manager and says that I have Been complained about for showing my tits in public mind you in with my family and have never been the type of person to such a thing I look around to see if someone joking and then the man on the phone proceeds to be disrespectful as I'm looking for the waiter to give him back the phone ask for the manager wich both the man on the phone and waiter claim they are my bf gets on the phone and goes at it with the guy asking him to show his face they e change words and all the while I'm waiting for my debit card and my bf to calm down . We finally walk out my cousin grabs the phone and *69 the phone and looks through the recent call list then the ""manger/waiter"" who gave me the phone takes it and tries telling her they called from another phone . Well we leave and realize that the call was made from inside thAt place . Idk what kind of sick fuck thought it was funny to ruin our dinner or play some disrespectful joke that way but it wasn't funny I hope they ready this and know that I did involve the police and they will be further involved being as how the next morning I woke up to fraud on my account and many transactions that were never made by me ! I have tried to call them and confront them but I have either been placed on hold or hung up on ! I hope you all read this and know these people are sick and I'd never agian recommend this place as a go too in my life !",ZhFAXDUMgy5M7KB1Zd69FQ,1,0,1,0XC5uzivI0Q3mmuepaP5jw

5517459,2015-11-11,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"Everything about this place lived up to my expectations. My husband and I came for our wedding anniversary. I have been counting the days down until I can indulge into some gangnam style....pause. 

We ordered pork belly, filet mignon, salmon wrapped in bacon, tempura kabocha, oysters, the spicy chicken wings, spicy garlic edamame, and the famous spicy tuna kimbap! First of all, spicy tuna kimbap is mmmmbop good! It's a roll of seaweed with rice in it fried into a tempura with spicy tuna atop. It was deeelish if you are a fan of raw fish, especially the spicy tuna flavor. It is a MUST GET when you come. You failed if you didn't order it to give it a shot. Don't expect the sizes of the meat to be on steroids. The meat are sliced so when you grill it yourself it doesn't take forever to cook. I think the portioning were perfect enough so you could indulge and enjoy whatever other items you ordered; therefore, you weren't meat overload. Unless, you came in with your carnivorous spirit on green.

All the side dishes (banchans) come free with the meal were delicious as well. I don't know if these side dishes are on a daily rotation, but we received 6 different servings of side dishes. These were bean sprouts, kimchi, kimchi like cucumber, Mac salad, radish (daikon) in a pool of some sweet sauce, and cuttlefish. The cuttlefish was so tender. It was my fave out of the banchans. I mean honestly, I don't think I was breathing as I was scarfing my food down. 

We came in on a Tuesday evening. The ambiance was perfect. If you've been following my reviews you'd probably know by now that I come from a family of 6. I'm raising 4 boys and a husband. Lol. So this quiet time, is so much needed! It wasn't overly busy when we walked in. But as the night progressed so did the patrons. On a Tuesday night to have such business tells you something. The servers were great. Checked on us as often enough to not make me start secretly grumbling as a waiter approached. They were very good at clearing your table off of empty dishes so that was great as I dislike clutter. They did seem a little overly eager on certain parts such as the grill being used or not, but hey...I get it. Don't wanna char the grill or waste propane. That'd be equivalent to me telling my kids to turn the light off if no one is in the room. Except, we still had pieces on the grill that still needed grilling. My husband and I did give each other a look after awhile. But no biggy. 

I'd come back over and over until they give me reasons not to. The facility is clean. The colors are very zen like and I love that they have a projector screen of music videos playing. They played a mixture of rap and kpop. 

Good vibe, enjoyable food...definitely recommend! They do have high chairs, but expect it to be busy so I'd keep the stroller in the trunk, though there's space for it.

I thought the salad was a little bit of an afterthought as it was mostly lettuce but we still ate it.
Our favorite was the bulgogi bibambap.

The service felt a little off as they had a difficult time understanding and we were very conscious that they were watching us the whole time.

The set up of the restaurant is very much the same as gyukaku BBQ. The way to order food, grill, dishes, and similar atmospheres. The server we had was wonderful and accommodating as we arrived for a late dinner 9:30ish. At that time, the restaurant is very packed for a late evening on a week day. I would call in for a reservation to be safe. Happy hour starts at 10pm, therefore we ask the server for the happy hour menu ahead of the time. We then placed items that was not on the happy hour to get started and later order happy hour when 10pm roll around. They there generous with the side dishes, food portions are decent, and most of all we were surprised at the final bill that came up to approx $176 including tips.

5626707,2017-08-26,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"I have to explain first hand why this place gets a one star.  It's not like this place deserves a low rating and that you better stay away at all costs but having relied on yelp ratings for my first two Korean BBQ meals here in Vegas for Magal and Hobak (both with 4.5 stars with hundreds of reviews) I thought for sure this place must be just as good with 4.5 stars with thousands of reviews.  So with the bar being set from my experience at Magal and Hobak, these are the the things that fall short here.

Service - It's not like it was bad.  It was attentive enough but here you have to do all the grilling yourself.  This was the major disappointment for me when I found out I had to do my own cooking.  Heck I would have stayed home if I had to do my own cooking.

Price - I was able to feed my family of four for $100 at Hobak.  Here it started at $120.  Here the steamed egg side dish was extra and so was dessert.  Both of these were included at the other two.  If you checked in Yelp here you were offered a free macaron ice cream sandwich.  We shared this one macaron amongst the four of us each taking a small bite LOL.

Food - Maybe I overcooked the food or something but the food just didn't seem to taste as good and the beef cuts were just not as premium as the other places.  I think you can order more premium cuts but you had to pay more for it which I guess would fall into price and value just not as good as the others.  I really didn't care for the mushroom medley or the jalapeño peppers that were provided as part of the Gangnam combo.

So with the bar being set with the other two who are at 4.5 stars, Gangnam just doesn't come close so that's why for me it's at the other end of the spectrum.  Maybe I had high expectations going in but we came away very disappointed.",5Ytb9-HP5dgT_R5Jvntiqw,0,0,1,MpOEunHorpnmZWyjQxLNbQ

Their happy hour starts at 10pm. One of our drinks came without a straw. (not a big deal...but just careless). Had to ask twice for a refill for water when our cups were completely empty...not even any ice left. 

We ordered the garlic shrimp (two orders). This item was really delicious! Probably the best thing we tried. The steamed egg is a HUGE portion. It was good but a little bit salty. The spicy lemon chicken was good...didn't taste like lemon at all. In the picture it looked like the lemon sauce was going to come on the side...which we did not get. Seaweed salad was about average. Pork belly was good. Asparagus was really yummy. I would recommend that.

Nonetheless, hands-down best BBQ as well as other foods!  You can truly expect top quality meats, sauces,  foods as well as exceptional service by best looking staff!  

We went there after 2 weeks long road trip with toddlers.  As soon as we walked in my sons were acting up from being cooped in the car all day.  The staff promptly sat us in a private room so we were able to dine without worrying about interrupting other guests. Huge kudos to them since it was Friday night and place was packed.  

Then one of my sons threw up all over me!  and again the staff immediately came with napkins and made sure we were ok.  Super attentive and kind folks!

During our meal I think staff rotated and quietly checked up on us dozen times.  Just making sure we had everything but without interrupting our meal.  

The night started out rough, chaotic with kids and vomit but we all left the restaurant stuffed and extremely satisfied.  I would give them more than 5 stars if there was an option!

Since I was alone, they asked me if I would like to sit at the bar and like a fool I said Yes, not realizing that it meant not getting to grill my own meat. Oh Well... You live, you learn.(I wish they had told me that though).

They started me off with a plethora of side dishes and accompaniments which all eventually went really well with the meats and a bowl of white rice; everything except a random macaroni salad that is which I didn't quite understand being there. 
I ordered the Kobe Beef which was the main reason I went here and the Garlic Calamari which they recommended. They serve 6 pieces of beef and some sea salt which you absolutely must sprinkle on. It enhances the flavor exponentially. This was my first time eating Kobe Beef and I now understand what all the hype is about. It was just juicy, so flavorful, so amazingly tender. Without a shadow of a  doubt the best quality beef I've ever had.  They did overcook it a tad and it was medium-well which is maybe how they do it, but for such a cut I would most certainly have preferred a mid-rare. Very highly recommended, even though it's ridiculously pricey.
The Garlic Calamari was a huge fail. They were cooked well and tender but had no flavor at all and I had to douse them in hot sauce and soy to finish them.

Overall this was an awesome meal. I would definitely love to go back here and try some more cuts and also grill them myself this time by getting a table instead of sitting at the bar.

After submitting my review we were ignored for a good half hour. Our waiter was too busy being FED by a friend across the restaurant. Really? I get if you're friends come in to eat and you want to say hi or chit chat for a few minutes, but to completely abandon your table? That's rediculous. Actually nobody checked on us during that time, we had to flag a waitress down who really didn't seem to care. Finally a second waitress stopped by and asked how we were doing. They were having a promotion if you wrote a Yelp review your got a free dessert, so we showed our reviews and then waited and waited and waited for dessert. The waitress was very apologetic and even gave us macaroon ice cream for free, on top of our 2 free desserts.

FOOD:
MEAT: We ordered two types of meats: tenderloin and the galbi. You cook it yourself over the grill korean bbq style. The meat is honestly the best I've ever had. Quality was amazing, so juicy and tender. I'll be dreaming about this places meat forever. Definitely recommend ordering meat. The price was great for the amount given and quality. My brother (who was fairly hungry) was about to finish and feel perfectly satisfied.

SOUPS: my mom ordered the spicy tofu soup. ($9.50 I think). She said it was salty (it kind of was) but the flavor was SO GOOD. Had tons of seafood and a nice smokyish flavor. They give you white rice to eat it with to help with the saltiness. I 

I ordered the Yuke Jang ($9.50) which is a spicy beef soup with clear noodles. It was okay. It was not salty but spicy. I kind of wish there was a more depth in flavor. I would skip this dish. 

RICE: my dad ordered the original bibimbap ($12.50). I didn't get to try this one but this bowl is huge and my dad finished it all and said was good.

SERVICE: so fast and attentive. Usually I have a problem with places not being attentive and being slow to bring the checks and stuff. This was not the case here.

There aren't many of you, but if you're like, who really can't eat all that much in one sitting, it's excellent. Come during happy hour (1130am-5pm and then again after 10pm) and it'll be better bang for your buck.

We didn't eat much and was still really content and full (for me, at least). We only got short ribs, which they do remove the bones for you so it's just all meat. Then, we got beef brisket, which is pretty typical, as well as 2 orders of pork belly. I'm sad no tripe but I'll live. There are a lot of other things on the menu but I'm not a fan of marinated meat at KBBQs.

During my second visit, I got pork cheek, which was my first time eating it so I'm not sure how I feel about it yet... I wouldn't say everything is awesome-tasting but it's not too bad.

They've got a small selection of desserts but we only got ice cream ($1.95). Flavors: vanilla, green tea, and strawberry. It's a good portion size.

5741097,2016-12-19,1,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"I recently went here for a birthday dinner. We arrived around 5PM and the restaurant was only maybe 1/3 full.

We decided to order the Gangnam special for 4 people. The meal included salad, raw oysters, shishito peppers, corn, mushrooms, miso soup, several kinds of meat, and bulgogi bibimbop. There was also the standard kimchi and other appetizers you get at almost every Korean restaurant. We were there for Happy Hour so we also got a pitcher of beer for half-off.

Overall, everything tasted fairly standard to me. Nothing really stood out as amazing. I felt the salad lacked much flavor at all and the miso was just standard miso. The bibimbap had no chili paste or veggies and was pre-made when it arrived. It was more like just straight Korea style fried rice with some bulgogi inside.

I guess having been to Korea, nothing ever is quite the same; however, I have had other places that are much better than Gangnam. 

My biggest issue with the place was the speed in which they serve you. It was way too fast! Within minutes of ordering you have everything you ordered on the table. We didn't have time to finish a single appetizer before the next thing came out. At one point our table was so full there was literally zero room for anything else. I really felt like they were just trying to rush us out.

Beef Tongue-served with a lemon dipping sauce that really completes the dish 
King Oyster Mushroom-I love mushrooms, so this was a must for me

Would order again:
Marinated Kalbi-seasoned very well, beef is tender (I like the unmarinaded better just because you can the taste of their high quality beef isn't masked by the marinade)
Pork Belly-fairly standard K BBQ pork belly

Would skip:
Filet mignon: meat quality was just not that great

This isn't too far from the strip. It's located in a plaza and there's plenty of parking. We came around 10:40 pm and got seated in less than 10 minutes. We also got our food pretty quick after ordering. It took them 5-10 mins to get the main dishes and a total of  less than 30 mins for everything else. My only complaint is that the booth that we got (located on the right side) was very awkward to sit on for me. I'm a short Asian person. Anyone who's probably 6' and muscular/big build would sit comfortably in this booth. The seat is too far from the table. Other than this, everything is perfect. 

We ordered the Gangnam Combo and substituted the Green Salad and Koshitsu Pepper Yuzu for the Broccoli Cheese Fondue and Squash Tempura. The Broccoli is okay, not really mouthwatering. My favorites are the beef toro, Korean prime kalbi, 4 out of 8 of the banchans, Mushroom Medley, and the Oysters!!! The Oysters are definitely one of the best ones I've had.

Be warned that there will almost be a pretty long wait, I feel like its always understaffed and there's this one younger guy who works his butt off. When we were there he answered phones, rang up customers, grabbed foods, bussed tables, changed out grills, he pretty much did everything. I felt bad for him because he really was working super hard. Anyways, the food here is AMAAZINGGG. I love their Hirami Miso, you must try it. Also their steamed eggs is out of control, like MASSIVE in size, it's an overflowing fluff when they bring it out. And it's not all fluffly and airy like most steamed eggs. This thing is dense and could be shared with 2-3 people even.

I have heard so many good things about Gangnam Asian BBQ and finally gave it a try tonight. The ambiance of the interior was really intimate and it was very clean. It really sets the mood for dates or whenever you're in the mood for binge eating KBBQ with your friends, which is what I did. 

The food was delicious! The meats were served fresh and presented nicely. What came to my surprise was that they served Thai Tea, which made my visit even more satisfying. We ordered the miso soup, pork belly, prime kalbi, bugolgi, the bacon wrapped enoki just to name a few and Yuuum! Belly was satisfied! What adds variety of flavor to your meat is the three different sauces they present you with. There is a vinegar like sauce, a sweet sauce, and a spicy sauce, which really gives you multiple choice on flavorings for your food.Of course trying their desserts was a must so I went for the banana tempura. This was so goood. The banana tempura was served hot off the frying pan and what helped balanced that out was the vanilla ice cream. It was a great ending to my meal. The prices overall are perfect for what they serve you.

All in all I have to say my visit was great! The owner even came out and checked on us. He was so friendly and he looked happy to see his customers. I will be coming back for more!",a9bYTRxQ31rLR6GfRE1ysQ,2,1,5,-rI5-CWVqElO3BOKNlfnJA

Okay yelpers here's my review. We ordered the following:

1. Harami miso
2. Korean prime Kalbi 
3. Prime Kalbi
4. Kobe Ssam (Uni dish)
5. Uni Bibimbap
6. Spicy soft tofu soup
7. Side of white rice 

Total bill came out to $78.52 for 2 of us before tax  so $90ish after 15% tip. 

I would say the food was 3/4 Korean and 1/4 Japanese style bbq. Korean sides are free and unlimited and if u ""volunteer"" writing a yelp review u get a free dessert  not the reason I am writing one but hey free is free...

Overall value & price I would say 4.5 out of 5 but with the good customer service it bumps to a 5! Would come back here next time I'm in town! :)

I looooove going here, especially for lunch. They have really good deals! I'm one of those girls who can't really eat A LOT so this is the place to go. It's pretty cheap for a la carte especially since I don't eat that much. Their meat is really good quality. Comparing it to other AYCE bbq places is definitely not even close. 

The week that I found out about this place, I went like 4 times again after that. I wanted to bring everyone to it and show them how good it is! I feel like it's definitely hidden, but it's right next to UNLV so it's convenient when I don't know what to eat, I usually suggest here for a quick lunch.

Meat I always order: Bulgolgi, Beef toro, Brisket, and Bacon wrapped Salmon.
I always get their steamed egg too. BEST steamed egg I've ever had in my life!

Their three different sauces are to die for and they're great! They also give you lemon for your beef tongue! Really tasty!

The lunch special comes with rice, miso soup, and salad. The salad is huge! And it's reasonably priced at lunch, so do try to come in for lunch!

Their desserts are SO good too! We've had the green tea and vanilla ice cream. Their sundae's come with little pocky sticks too! MM What a great idea!!!

I definitely recommend this place if you're trying to find some prime meat!

5918547,2013-10-04,3,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"So Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining has been opened for awhile, but I only just noticed it very recently.  It is a Japanese and Korean DIY BBQ restaurant, where you can order items a la carte or from one of their many preset combinations.  It is a similar concept to Yagu (on the West side) and many other J or KBBQ restaurants in California.

Based on reading the past reviews (very helpful in convincing me to drive to this side of town for just a meal and go then back) and the photos posted for this business and comparing it to my first hand experience here, I can deduced that the restaurant has experimented with various promotions before settling on their current all day Happy Hour promotion.  Gone are their lunch special menu or previous versions of their HH menu.  Now you get 1/2 off selected beverage items and discounted menu items.

The food I was served was good and tasted even better when cooked properly and to the exact doneness that I want.  And since it was not AYCE, I did not felt subconsciously compelled to overindulge during the meal with the final destination dangerously close to meat coma station.  Price was reasonable, not cheap when you add everything up, but you get good quality for the price.

The server was very friendly and helpful, as was the owner or the restaurant manager/model (yeah, she definitely exudes the essence of Gangnam style). The restaurant itself looks very nice (posh with well executed design and decoration).

Suggested party size for dining here is up to 4 per table, as you have to share the grill built into the table.  Don't wear anything that you don't want smelling like it was generously sprayed with the delicious smell of sweet BBQ smoke after you leave or have a change of cloth for going back to work. Best time to come is after work so you can take advantage of their HH drink specials without having to feel like an alcoholic for the 2nd part of your work day.

Bulgogi, Korean Prime Short Rib and the Kurobuta (Japanese Pork) Sausage was what I ordered to be grilled and is what I would recommend to others trying out this restaurant.  No free banchan here, but you can order their Kimchee and Pickles (both are $0.00) to compliment your meal.

The food was reasonably priced. We got the gangnam special for $65 for two people. Well worth the money if you're going to eat everything. I do mean everything. Otherwise I would have ordered a la carte. All the meat was seasoned and marinated very well that you didn't really need the additional bbq sauce that they offered. We also ordered the steamed chili dumplings..... Don't get those. It's a big dose of spicy sauce with otherwise bland flavors. 

We'd definitely come back only if we felt like splurging. After dessert, drinks and taxes, $90+ is a bit more than we'd like for a quick casual meal.",WyMuUvqsJN1-s6LsNIeAlQ,2,1,4,iBpmizs0jQ77f_OUkZdA9Q

5928772,2017-03-21,0,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,"We came in around 7pm on a Friday night and was told the wait would be 40 minutes or so. It's too late to go to another place anyways so we decided to wait. They have a nice waiting area with big screen playing music videos so it's not too bad. 
After 40 minutes or maybe a little longer we were seated and offered menu. However it took them a really long time to come back to take our order. People who were seated after us got their orders taken way before ours. That was strike #1. 
Finally the server came take our order and we opted for the Gangnam set thinking it probably has the most popular items. Since we had more than two people we ordered a chicken fried rice thinking it should be enough food. It took the server a long time to bring us the banchan and water. Nothing special about the banchan and it was a little disappointing from a non-ayce place.

Chicken fried rice arrived first before any other starter items. Which was okay because I was really hungry so any food that came to the table was welcomed. Fried rice was hot with huge chunks of chicken and nice separated grains.

The starters all tasted quite decent. Oyster was fresh and sweet. HOWEVER! Now that I went back to look at menu writing this review I realized they didn't give us the fried calamari! (I was going to give this place 2 stars but now it's down to 1) 

We chose bulgogi bibimbap instead of white rice and Korean prime kalbi instead of the kalbi. The bibimbap was nice and hot. We started to grill our first item which was the filet mignon. Right when I was about to dip that into the sauce I found out the server didn't give us any sauce. At first I thought this place doesn't offer sauce but then it's kind of impossible because all kbbq places I've been to have some kind of sauce or at least salt? Then we looked around and saw sauce plates on every single table but ours. Then we had to track down the busy waiter before we could proceed to eat our meal. Strike #2. 

Halfway through the meal the server came to take away some empty meat plates and my sister's bowl that she was eating her fried rice and bibimbap with. I looked at the server in disbelief because she was still eating her meal. Not only was the service slow the entire night but when they chose to be attentive they did it the wrong way. Since the server's too hard to track down now my sister had to eat her meal with no bowl. Strike #3. 

The nice thing about this place is that we can do yelp check-in and get free macaroon ice cream sandwich for dessert. We got coffee, strawberry, and mango and they just tasted like any macaroon ice cream sandwich at most ayce kbbq places.
The quality of the meat here is not better than other ayce places and that's a big disappointment from the great reviews they have. 

I think this place is really lacking in service here. I felt that the kitchen was working very hard and able to provide nice fried rice in a timely manner so they're doing their job right. If they can better train their server I believe they can reduce the wait time significantly.",iGtInQDTZ89mKnkhFWdlfA,1,0,1,PUb7K9qnCuAx-bTUImWohg

We, a party of six, arrived before the restaurant opened at 11:30 a.m. and waited outside for the doors to open. As we stepped in, someone started to set our table with all the side dishes; as soon as we were seated, we started nibbling. These were high-quality side dishes, from the fishcake slices to the kimchi. There was also macaroni salad, pickled cucumbers, etc. All of these items are ""refillable"" upon request.

While the menu includes weekday lunch specials and meal sets (four different options for parties of 2 or 6), we opted to order a la carte so we could get each item we wanted:
-Kobe beef carpaccio ($9.95): So good! Thin slices of meat heaven, really. There was enough for each of us to have 2-3 pieces, too, so definitely a generous serving.
-Spicy tuna kimbap ($6.95): Kind of like a spicy tuna with crispy rice roll that you'd find at some Izakayas, but the rice is rolled up in seaweed, and the tuna is poke-style. You get the soft fish and the crunchy rice with a light sriracha mayo flavor--comes together very nicely. It's four rolls, but we managed to share between six of us. 
-Tteokbokki ($4.95): Consisting of soft rice cake, fishcake (same as the side dish), and hot sauce, this dish took me by surprise. It looks like a simple bowl of rice cakes, but is full of flavor, not awfully spicy. Make sure that you get a fishcake slice with the rice roll to get all the flavors together. A good, cheaper option for something that's a bit more filling.
-Spicy ramen egg ($6.95): I was skeptical, but boy was I proved wrong! This was one of the most enjoyable bowls of ramen I've had, even though it really was just ramen, egg, some greens, and spice. Like the tteokbokki, it's simple, but so good for the soul and for the tummy. You can opt for the Japanese sausage/ seafood options for additional cost.
-Bibim nangmyun ($11.95): Spicy cold thin noodles. This was my least preferred of all the dishes, but even then, I'd give it a 4/5. Nothing bad about it, just that it's not as savory as it looks, though you can add whatever sauces you want. I'd recommend mixing in some of the spicy fishcake side dish for additional flavor. 
-Original bibimbap ($12.95): Our server helped us mix everything together and even dished it out to each of us. Best bibimbap I've had, hands down. Flavorful, filling, and ""healthy"" (because of all the veggies in it, of course).
-Beef toro ( 2x$4.95), beef tongue (2x$8.95), flat iron garlic ($8.95), Korean prime kalbi ($8.95): I couldn't really tell the difference between any of them, but it doesn't matter, because they were all so delicious. For the meats that aren't already marinated, definitely use the three sauces provided to you--in fact, I recommend dipping the same piece of meat into all three sauces to get a slightly sweet/ tangy, and definitely spicy kick to your otherwise unflavored meat. 

All of this cost only $125--including tax and gratuity! All six of us were extremely stuffed and very happy. Oh, AND with Yelp check-in, we each got a free macaron for dessert...

We got:
-2 orders of Beef Toro $4x2
-Pork Belly: $4
-Cream Cheese Wonton: $3
-Sweet Corn: $2
-Chicken Karaage: $4
-Jalapeno Poppers: $4
-Prime Kalbi: $8.95
-Strawberry Macaron Ice cream sandwich: Free with Yelp Check in

The entire feast for two was only ~$40 and it was very good.

If I were to go again, I would skip the Chicken Karaage and the Cream Cheese Wonton and it would still be plenty of food for us. The set-up is more Korean than Japanese but the sauces were more yakiniku style. If you're looking for authenticity, this is not the place.

The meats are amazing and the vegetables are tasty too. It doesn't take a lot of money to get filled up so don't worry that's its not a all you can eat restaurant. My favorite is mixing the white rice with the egg custard and putting a little kimchi on top before I add my meat on yop. Also don't forget to check in so you get your free ice cream. The best flavor is vanilla. Trust me,5Fh6cbIoftPE7LISJBlPGg,0,0,5,2BLLfWeYz0Utpc6rLGbkiA

When I pulled up it wasn't quite open for lunch but the people waiting outside said it was well worth the few minute wait for the doors to open.  
Once inside, the decor was traditional for Asian cuisine. There was also a projection screen playing a combination of Asian and American pop videos which was pretty amusing.  
There was a variety of menus options which was typical for Korean BBQ.  So if you've ever been to one of these places, the food is as good as you cook it.  I was surprised by the edamame...a buttery garlic delight. The green tea cheese cake was much better than expected. 
The bottom line is that this place is pretty good and I would definitely come here again when in the mood for #cookedbyme cuisine.",z7gzEbVRgRwwtzkW48scDA,0,0,4,SEb78NzDKCuVOVh3Vktiaw

I highly recommend the Korean Kalbi - for $9 you get a generous portion of high quality, thickly sliced and deliciously seasoned meat. It was so good my girlfriend and I immediately ordered a second plate once we were done. The shishito peppers and mushroom medley were also amazing. Hell, everything we ordered was fresh and delicious and tasted amazing off the grill. Heck even the rice was really good and I'm
Picky about rice so that's saying something.

We also ordered a bottle of soju to share (Jinro Chamisul) and it was the perfect drink to go with the meal.

My only complaint is that they do charge you for the sesame oil which is usually free in most korean BBQ places. But for the amazing prize, potions and quality of food who is complaining?

I would fly back to Vegas just to eat here ;) this place definitely was a huge highlight of my Vegas trip.",40yLxxoCJo-Sci83gvGGvQ,2,1,5,vTw1I5ccuTzQ7oRsQDvcMg

The Las Vegas has chicken if you're not so much into meat. And the Gangnam has fresh oysters, although our friends opted to exchange the oysters for something else. Either option you choose, you get a lot of food. It's super fun to cook and eat while chatting. Everyone was full and happy at the end. The macaroon ice cream is delicious! I recommend it. It's the perfect size dessert after stuffing your face lol If they still have it, check in  and you get one free! (the macaroon).",S9wKc6osMZ0IcaG_mdUm3g,1,0,5,8YJSidmbmmJZ21XzRu34Zw

The meats are really good. We got the Gangnam set and you are able to substitute dishes that you don't want so that's a plus. For the amount of food we got, $65 isn't much. If we ordered them al carte, then it probably would've been even cheaper but we were really lazy and hungry. 

The service was attentive. 5/5

The reason why I'm deducting a star is because the seats is far from the table making it uncomfortable while eating. Also it's super hot! Been to maybe Korean bbq spots were it was cool and refreshing to eat. Also maybe the music. I like the music but not what you really want to listen to while eating.
