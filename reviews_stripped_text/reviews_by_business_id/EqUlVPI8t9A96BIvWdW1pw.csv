The interior of the restaurant was designed with a lodge cabin theme and was cute and comfortable. The food was typical pub food and fairly priced. I ordered a burger with fries which turned out ok, but the bun was way over buttered and greasy. I would recommend asking for any kind of sandwich bread to be lightly buttered. I'm giving this review an extra star than what I think it deserves due to our server Misty - she did a great job!",D6Svy1ujwTRwjYRBWWOyow,1,0,4,bqyJ3d7CKMhI31jxGdUjvw

Place was practically empty, and the bartender still took forever to come take our order.   He flat out ignored us for awhile, even.  

We ordered white wine.  Cheapest, most disgusting garbage ever.  I haven't had wine that bad since I was 18 on a military base in England getting drunk with a bunch of broke airmen...myself being equally broke and boozing on a budget.

We went in on a weekday late afternoon during happy hour.  My first thought was wow it's hidden, but I really like the atmosphere inside. We got a bbq chicken pizza and it  was great. Our only complaint is that the bartender all but ignored us. He seemed like a nice enough guy by his interactions with the 4 other patrons who were obviously regulars. But, I was only able to get 2 refills and my husband only got 1 while we were there. We would have stayed longer if we had gotten better service, we might have even become regulars.

863269,2015-09-13,0,EqUlVPI8t9A96BIvWdW1pw,"Went to the ""jam"" last night. Pretty bad. Not so much the musicians but the general overall presentation of the show. Really, really bad sound quality. Really bad acoustics in the room. Really bad mix. Really bad lighting. It is a shame because the idea has merit. It is just that the execution was terrible. It didn't seem that most of the players were performing for the audience. They were there to feed their egos. Why is it that these decent players don't understand stage presence or actually listen to their end product with a critical ear? When you throw a bunch of good players together in a lousy setting, it equals lousy. There was one good act that sounded great (not the house band - their set was boring and sounded horrible). Unfortunately after they played a couple songs they got quickly ushered from the stage in favor of a really bad amateur act that looked and sounded like they just rolled out of bed.
We went there expecting a showcase and found a garage band rehearsal. Had to leave because it went downhill quickly. 
I heard that it used to be better when there was a different host. I don't know about that but I know I won't be back under current conditions. Seems like yet another case of management that doesn't care about quality entertainment as long as they are selling drinks. Very sad.",z21uBsK7layUkXZsHWF4rQ,2,0,1,i9-n3RWMKTcXAszThEUHOw
1014208,2017-10-04,0,EqUlVPI8t9A96BIvWdW1pw,"I'm a little disappointed with the bartender tonight. This is my neighborhood bar and I come about once a month.  I usually gamble $20-$100 when I'm there. Tonight I came in to meet some friends. I sit at the bar and put $20 in. I lost $10 within 2 minutes, but won it back a few minutes later. I was up and down all night. Getting as low as $1.25 and as high as $25. I was up and down for more than an hour. I got 2 beers comped. When he asked if I wanted a 3rd beer and I said yes assuming it was going to be comped. He said that I was going to be charged because I was not playing enough and not at max bet. The thing is, I was playing max bet and continuously playing with stopping for a minute occasionally to talk to my friends. I guessed that I bet close to $80 when all was said and done. What upset me was that I told him that I was playing continuously and betting the max yet he tried saying I wasn't. I'm not mad that he wanted to charge me for the beer, I mad that he was basically calling me a liar.

He also did not mention to my buddy that it was buy one get one during happy hour when he ordered a beer from the bar. The waitress told him that it was happy hour. So when he tried to get his free beer the bartender said he couldn't because it was past happy hour. My buddy said that he ordered his first beer before happy hour, but the bartender said why didn't you tell me you knew about the happy hour, not knowing that he didn't know about when he ordered. The bartender should have told him about and and not blamed him.",nPI0_4vdBbCfWl35RDR5RA,0,0,2,5fbnbecdydSKJtOXy7z-5Q

2002558,2011-09-10,1,EqUlVPI8t9A96BIvWdW1pw,"Joey's, back when it used to be Timbers, used to be my favorite bar in town.  I could walk over the 95 to the restaurant, enjoy a bowl of super delicious chili along with a couple of delicious drinks, and have a great conversation with one of my favorite bartenders, Meredith.  

Times change, however.  Joey bought it and eventually stopped serving food late night since the poor choice of allowing bartenders to blast rap and hip/hop music to a crowd that wasn't really fond of it drove a lot of their regulars away, resulting in a loss of funds late night.  So individuals like myself who usually only hang out and drink after eating a meal or during were left disappointed. 

Meredith went to day shift, where it's near impossible for me to get with my schedule, but it was frustrating to have someone with such a tremendous personality and a regular customer following to just vanish on her regular crowd.  

Their food has some great dishes.  The breakfasts have touches such as onion/pepper/potato mixes in lieu of hash browns and they are seasoned well and a lot of their food is excellent bar food.  As I mentioned before, the chili is really up there.  The portions for soup and salad are on the larger side.

The decor looks like Gaston from Beauty and the Beast had go at the place with antlers all over.  I LOVE the comfy wing chairs.  Super comfortable, although service can be a pinch slow there vs. in the booths.  

If you want fast service, sit at the bar or at the side booths, as my general recommendation for this place. 

They also offer free wi-fi and have karaoke on Friday nights, which is supposedly hilarious to witness.  Pool tables available as well.

I would give four stars if they offered food late night and if the offered breakfast all day buuuut no go.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,3,2,3,W_4HkpvnX7uOW-5vqAZvLw
2077460,2017-01-05,2,EqUlVPI8t9A96BIvWdW1pw,"Joey's is a bar/grill tucked away in the back of a shopping plaza on Craig and 95. It's not visible from the street but it's behind Tommy's and next to Dennys. We had a restaurants.com coupon for $25 off $50 which is why we chose to eat here. The menu is quite small. It appears at one time there were more items to choose from, but they were blacked out on the menu. The menu consists of soup/salad, burgers/sandwiches, breakfast, and appetizers. 

I started with a blue moon. It was on special because it was during a football game. On game days they have food and drink specials so be sure to ask if you go during those times. We decided to order a couple appetizers; chili cheese fries with grilled onions and tomatoes added, and hot wings. I thought the chili cheese fries were just okay. The chili wasn't particularly flavorful and the onions weren't as grilled as I would have preferred. The portion was hearty and more than enough for 2 people. The wings were hot wings nothing special about them. I did like their ranch it was definitely house made. 

For our mains we both got burgers. I got the parmesan burger and he got the bbq bacon burger. The BBQ bacon burger was SMOTHERED in bbq sauce and not in a good way. There was so much sauce my bf had to scrape the majority of it off. It was probably a good burger but the sauce really overpowered the other flavors. My burger was good, it was similar to a patty melt except it had mushrooms as well as grilled onions and thousand island sauce. I liked the parmesan bread it came on. After that we still weren't quite at $50 so we checked out the desserts. They only have 3 - brownie, an apple pie and ice cream. Nothing sounded good so we ended up getting a cheesesteak to go and my bf ate it for lunch the next day. 

Finally our total was over $50. Even though we had the coupon we paid close to $40 with tax and tip. I don't think I would come back here to eat because of the limited menu selections and the food was just A-OK, but I would stop by again for a drink during games.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,7,5,3,UgKRl2CaOd7JO9qi9MbhGg

My friends were an hour delayed in meeting me, and some super nice bartenders kept me company. They offered to change the channels on the TV - a simple thing to ask, but something bartenders never offer. They made stiff drinks and refilled quickly.

I thought the food was great. I ordered a chicken southwest salad (can't remember the name on the menu), and it was gigantic. Super fresh. Only thing I would've liked was if the iceberg lettuce was mixed with something a bit more hearty and green (spinach, mixed greens, etc.).

They have a jam band that plays every Saturday that took the stage around 9ish. I loved the vibe. They take requests, they play hits, and anyone can take the stage with an instrument or a voice as long as you sign in first. They were super fun and audience engaged.

For two gigantic liquor drinks and a HUGE salad, my total was only $20. I consider that a deal!

Tip for the antisocial:
The singer/MC does come out into the audience and converse with you on the microphone, so if you hate audience interaction, don't sit up in the stage area.

Frankly, I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews. I got great and friendly service from the bar staff, the food came out super quick, and it had a nice and relaxed vibe about it.

And yes, this place used to be a Timbers, but I got better service and better quality than I ever got at any of the local Timbers.

This is a big joint, and on this night it was almost empty at the large gaming bar,  and totally empty in the dining room at 9:00 p.m.  Getting a table was a piece of cake, but we were here for dinner, not dessert.

The dining room was dreary:  brown benches against starkly empty lighter brown walls without a hint of decoration, surrounding brown tables and chairs in the center.  It was depressing, made more so by the absence of other customers.  I wanted to pick up a paintbrush and go Jackson Pollack on those walls.  But then I took a walk to survey the rest of the place.  

The far opposite end had a few pool tables and some pub tables, and some decoration that made it a 180 from its cohort on the other side.  But the central bar area had some comfy booths with color, the flashing lights from the TVs, and the view of booze bottles.  We switched, and it made an instant difference.

The menu was disappointing, since a third of the items were inked out, which made it hard to find something to order.  And if we wanted to use that certificate we had to spend $50 bucks!  Ah, the life of a couponing diner is tough.  Finally, we settled on a chicken quesadilla appetizer, a bowl of tortilla soup and a side salad for Herb, fish and chips for his entree, and grilled tilapia for me.

The quesadilla was terrific, full of tender and meaty chicken, bacon, cheese and avocado.  The tortilla soup was a huge bowlful.  It had a lot of chicken and canned chopped tomatoes, but was lacking spice, avocado, and substance.  It was very watery, and had no relation to the beloved tortilla soup of my Mexico past life. The tortilla strips were served on the side. Salad was ordinary iceberg with two kinds of cheese and some chopped tomatoes.  Nothing special, and it was missing the croutons I think the menu had specified, but the tortilla strips did double duty.

For the entrees, the fish of the ""Fish and Chips"" was good, though the chips weren't well done, as asked for.  My tilapia dish had two pieces of the fish, a lot of rice, and a veggie mix.  When I see those crinkle-cut carrots, I know they came out of a freezer bag.  Unfortunately, half of that portion apparently didn't make it into the pot, because it was still frozen.  I was already full from my quarter of the quesadilla and the pint of Angry Orchard I was chugging down, so I didn't make a big deal out it, knowing those veggies would live to be reheated - or heated - another day.  The fish was perfectly cooked, though, and well-seasoned, even if that, too, came out of a freezer.

Our waiter/bartender, Joey, gave us excellent service.  There's a good chance we'll return.  Though they'll probably have to let me decorate the main dining room in order to do that.  I work for food. :)",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,13,8,3,pMDVN_m5cmKsixUflWuFhA

When the Golden Knights are away we go places to watch the games. Someone recently recommended Joey' s Tavern. We got lucky and came during happy hour. Great prices! Huge screen to watch the game on. There was lots going on. Darts, pool, jukebox just to name a few. Definitely will put this on my list of places to come back to. Friendly staff. Great food! Recommend for games or just hanging out.

In a city where even the smallest of neighborhood bars can afford to be dickheads and serve the like, Joey's stands out as a comfortable place to sit down and relax after a long day and just talk or play pool or drink. The food is your typical American Continental Bar flair, but not horrible. If you like a bar where everyone knows your name or at least asks it upon entry with a hearty handshake, go here. Because it isn't right next to a major street (about a football field from the 95) outdoor seating would be a great addition!",XBxmubKfzh3pkDHry6kskw,0,0,3,rnsMLrCkMRcvsj2S7rXvKw

When we walked in, it's like everyone knew we've never been there but we decided to try it since we had a Restaurant.com coupon.  The place wasn't busy with 3 other people dining at the bar.  It took over 30 minutes for the waitress to even come around to get our drink orders and when we wanted a few more minutes, that took even longer! The food took long as heck to be delivered and it was okay. It wasn't good but it wasn't the worst food.  I believe the waitress was being fake towards us because it was like she was trying to be nice but you could tell she wasn't happy we were there with our coupon...and she over charged us but my husband just wanted to leave.

5793024,2015-02-02,3,EqUlVPI8t9A96BIvWdW1pw,"So the Hubby and I went there to watch the superbowl. It is normally a niner bar and the husband is a niner fan. and they were supposed to be doing give aways and a special food menu. 
When we arrived it was busy but not crazy it was about 2:40 and the game was to start at 3PM. we sat with some friends and when the server came over she completely ignored us. she took orders from everyone else.. now being in the business I understand when your swamped and I give leeway but then when she came back a few times and still acted like we were invisible I was getting pissed. how about an acknowledgement?
finally my husband asked her if we could order something to which she replied ""yeah, I'll be right back"" well she came back two more times and never took our order. we went to the bar where we stood and waited I even had money in my hand to give the sign I was in need of a drink yet the bartender took orders from everyone around us again like we were not there. so we went back to the table and still no drink. it was almost the end of the first quarter when our friend waved her down and she finally asked what we wanted I decided to not order as I felt that there was no point in trying to order one round if we may never see her again to get anything else, but my husband did order a Kahlua and cream. I got up left and went to Denny's next door to order a soda and brought it back. when I arrived it was the second quarter and my husband still didn't have his drink. when he asked about it for the second time her answer was ""I am waiting on the bar"", not sorry, or I will go check, nope she just brushed him off.  finally he got his drink she walked over and just put it in front of him and walked of without a single word, and I had to laugh because the drink wasn't even full. 
Now one of our table mates placed an order for a Capt. and coke when it finally arrived she literally leaned over knocking in to my leg reached her arm across my face and flipped her hair in to my face, put the drink down and walked off. I WAS PISSED! 
By this time it was half time so I got up and went to Albertsons to get a snack cause I was not ordering shit from this place. Now before I left I made a post about the bad service on their Facebook page and apparently the server had so much time on her hands since she was not waiting on tables to read this post and came to the table looking for me, when I got back she came up and said "" listen if you want beers and shots I am here"" to which I told her ""you ignore us this whole time but now all of a sudden you have time""? don't think so. 
so the whole game I spent running back and forth to Denny's for refills so we could have drinks, and I got to watch the server and the owner basically trip over themselves to wait on the 10 Seahawk fans that were at a table right behind us I guess my money wasn't green enough. 
what a joke this place is I have never been in a bar where you could not get a drink. trust me there are plenty of bars in Vegas so I will never have to set foot in this rat hole again.",TmniT8S5d1rPL_6w7U7-Sg,0,0,1,bU8DWnNBLkMfIelQ9JXxNA

The pizza was ok -- It came with raw onions and I am not a big fan of those on pizza's if they where caramelized onions it would have tasted better, because of the sauce and onion just left a raw taste in mouth. I like the idea of a breaded chicken part for the bbq chicken that was a good idea. 

ok on fries they where steak fries -- I am not a fan of these at all, they tend to get cold fast and then become soggy witch happened. Maybe change up to shoe string fries or seasoned fries 

Thankfully with my name is joey lol I would like to at least give this place a second try and see what they can do. They are cheap on prices witch is nice but sometimes there is a off set in price vs food.",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,1,1,3,rspGhN5U40pXj4ylA4cRUw
