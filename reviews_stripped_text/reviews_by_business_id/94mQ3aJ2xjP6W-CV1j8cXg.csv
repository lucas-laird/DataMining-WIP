Then they threw on the toppings like it was a game of ultimate frisbee. Then they cut the sandwich on the wrapping tearing it prior to throwing it in a bag. By the time we arrived at our destination we had to try and piece together our sandwich so we could eat it. Just a lot of cost cutting that sacrificed the quality of the product. This area already has a severe lack of food options, I am sad that I cannot frequent this place in the future.",_oSVwceBYvkp_EsHuNJaIA,0,1,2,_s4_7dctY_gMB0-LNdE5lw

As soon as we walk into the restaurant they know our order because we go in there much!!!! I am definitely going to keep going to this port of subs!,2aYd0uVjZPL83lMFoOOwWg,2,0,5,sJdLV_jZViulk6lh00u34g

This store calls me 45 minutes after placing the order to tell me they aren't going to deliver to me.  You guys should really check out Desert Inn and McCloud location.  They delivered to us and it was way better then the sandwiches that we had ever received at the Charleston location.  This franchise location leaves a bad taste in the mouth for other Port of Sub locations.  Corporate has been made aware of the issues I have with this location.",33Jz09jA9L3ycpMG4mVsdw,0,0,1,g1CRymp776ZMpIWbMcxqeQ

The management is friendly and the girls behind the counter get your stuff done fast and with a smile. 

The can cater your office party at the last minute as well.",wwAfMjITOu4jL6XnhTBmIQ,0,0,4,VAoYxDozBALr8vzGXfsmaQ
1953133,2015-04-23,0,94mQ3aJ2xjP6W-CV1j8cXg,Can you say no sense or urgency and Chinese fire drill? This place is a hot mess. It literally took 10min to make my two sandwiches with 4 workers and on top of that 3 people jumped in to make both sandwiches -.- there's no assembly line going on and there was 4 people in line as well. Somehow they all a mange to finish everyone's sandwiches first then then rang everyone up at the end. Like wtf management doesn't know how to handle or delegate the staff when it's busy I should know since I do management on the strip :-/ I should just stick to my Port of subs location in Green valley. Gave them two stars because the one girl behind the counter was friendly and had a smile on her face. :).,6bMAntpuT9Z-XgewMVy2kw,0,0,2,whLjNE9vGjY-zuG_hDA_pA

After being an hour late manager called and asked if we still wanted our order. Seriously? Yes, we want it people are waiting.

Owner said she was ""sorry"" when she dropped it off and it ""was a learning curve, won't happen again."" Really? That's the explanation? She should have done something to fix it or make the situation better. 

Pathetic attempt at customer service and good business practices/logistics. We will NOT be using them again. 

Feel free to contact us.",wn08XODkoJkg1JUjMOD2eA,0,0,1,lovKut7pAsuoo56FfO97jA
2206968,2012-02-08,0,94mQ3aJ2xjP6W-CV1j8cXg,"I think the secret ingredient in Port-of-Subs sandwiches is crack. Seriously. I crave it every day but I've forced myself to go only once a week.

I don't understand the two star rating. This PoS is in a bad neighborhood, but is very clean and anytime I come in, the crowd is uniformed services workers (cops, firemen, mailmen, etc...) and the atmosphere is chill.

When I go (which is usually lunch, I work Downtown) there is a fabulous server who is always in a great mood, but not so over the top that it's annoying. Everyone I've encountered who works here is in a pleasant mood and works very quickly.

The best part about Port-of-Subs: unlike subway, their bread doesn't get stale while you're eating it. And you can get your sandwich grilled in a panini press, which I think is way better than toasting.",ST74s3O3TGREMDHQWMFNQg,1,2,5,JapppA-1CjHfCPVwF0U_BQ
2546583,2016-02-23,0,94mQ3aJ2xjP6W-CV1j8cXg,"I have seen a few of these sub shops around so I decided to stop and check this one out.  The food it's self was nothing special.  Fresh cut meats and cheeses, fresh veggies except the avocado it had some brown spots on it.  They did not cut them off... That was not the issue here at all though. The service was far from great. There were 6 associates working at the time I came in granted it was right at lunch time, there were 3 people in front of me and they seemed to be working on a online order. I understand, but I stood there for about 10 min as the line behind me continued to get longer and longer. There were two associates just standing there looking around one actually grabbed the tip jar and started counting their tips.  I'm sorry but I will not be back because the speed in this place was NOT THERE! And in a sub shop like this the wait should not be that long.",KTS9mV7NL4KvIIEUhtdogA,1,0,2,q1eaJaiOiJwgt_-2LTd3JA
2666385,2015-05-10,0,94mQ3aJ2xjP6W-CV1j8cXg,I didn't know what to expect since this port of subs is in a dingy shopping center but it was very clean and modern and the food tasted very fresh. I love that they slice your meats at that moment. They have wraps unlike at subway. The only thing I didn't like was how slow the service was and that the lady drowned my sandwhich in mayo even though I said light mayo ;-; but I think she was new so I guess its ok. Also it is a bit pricier than subway.,NT_1h3SJxqjzLeNVvMQQOw,0,0,4,Y8kFKrVqYAZbLvuVn2Njbw

3362996,2018-04-23,0,94mQ3aJ2xjP6W-CV1j8cXg,Extremely upset with this Port Of Subs. The manager intentionally lied to me when I called about getting my husband a Sub. He lead me to believe they where at the Las Vegas airport where my husband is. I went to the portofsubs.com and paid for my order on line only to find out I had  been lied to and mislead. My husband went to get his sub and was told they didn't have an order. I talked to the manager of the Port of Sub at the Airport #39 they told me they do not except on line orders. I called this manager back and he even told me he was the owner. He full well knew that the airport Port Of subs do not except on line orders. Then proceeds to lie to me more. Port of subs #15 you really need to quit lying and robbing people of there money. Your manager needs to be fired for saying he was the owner! You should have given me my money back. Now I will take this even further. I will find out who the owner is get my money. $14.00. ! #15 port of subs you need a new manager. Hope you enjoy my money you are a thief sir.,vKtEHJQvAccaULVdcvgx3w,0,0,1,dTxCZHtbvoFk4Zj4O4743w
3541391,2017-10-31,0,94mQ3aJ2xjP6W-CV1j8cXg,Port of Subs is my go-to sandwich place and this is the best location I've been to! It's always clean and the ingredients are always fresh. The owner and the staff are always really nice. They'll know your order and I've heard them remember quite a few frequent customers' orders as well. This location is close to my work and they're quick even if there's a line.,UOTY05n5PmV7aARc7_UHIw,1,0,4,ItD7Loo4rwE7cMbzc2eX4A
4142796,2015-01-28,8,94mQ3aJ2xjP6W-CV1j8cXg,"So, I am a Vegas girl.  I lived there for 25 years and love all things Vegas.  I recently moved to Texas due to my hubby's job.  Sadly, there aren't any Port of Subs in this state.  So sad... 

I was recently back in Vegas visiting family, so I had to get my Port of Subs fix one day while I was there.  This was actually a new location for me, but it was great none the less!  Here's the scoop:

This is a nice Port of Subs location.  When we lived in Vegas, we ate at them regularly all over town, due to our addiction to the mayo/mustard sauce.  Some locations are yucky, some fantastic.  I think this location was pretty good, in my opinion.  The staff was nice and friendly.  They seemed actually happy, not just pretending.  They were really busy when I was there since it was the lunch rush, but they handled it great.  Yay for happy staff!

Now, for the food!

I am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, pickles, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings (salt, pepper, oregano, oil, vingear).  It is oh so tasty!  

My hubby always get the #2, which is the turkey, ham, and cheese.  He loves it and is always a happy camper afterwards.  I guess we just know what we like!

My kiddo always gets the kid's grilled cheese.  It's a tasty grilled cheese too, since they make it on a panini press.  

I like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at some other sandwich chains.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well with about 10 chip types, cookies, and brownies.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.

Overall if you want a sandwich quick, this is a great location to grab one and go.  Now I need to go crawl into a ball and cry because I'm 1200 miles from the closest Port of Subs.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,8,10,4,hMIazCo2lAu11TQlvY9LnQ
5201909,2017-03-29,0,94mQ3aJ2xjP6W-CV1j8cXg,"Port of Subs is my favorite sandwich place.  I love the delicious bread that melts in my mouth and the freshly sliced meat and cheeses.  Usually on weekdays I opt for the Classic Sub #11: Ham & American Cheese.  I like meeting friends for lunch at Port of Subs because there are both healthy options and splurge options to please everyone. 

I frequent several locations around town, but this is by far my FAVORITE location!  Everyone is super friendly.  They are also attentive and have memorized what I like to order!  They are also super efficient, which is important because it seems that a lot of the lunch crowd are on short lunch breaks and need something quick. Even when there is a huge lunch rush, they seem to get through the line pretty quickly.  All of the current employees are great sandwich masters.  My sandwiches are not only delicious, but are neatly prepared!  

The location is also very clean and nicely decorated.",FEeVoZ4BonDyBCaRkg9kQg,1,0,5,aVZK_Qd27nJXIvWoStg7Fg
