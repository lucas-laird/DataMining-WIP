It went far beyond my expectations. It was everything I had expected and more. It was a very friendly, comfortable atmosphere. Everything felt exceptionally friendly and comfortable inside of the restaurant. I had the smokehouse, and the sausage was phenomenal and full of flavor. The pancakes were also very good and fluffy, just the way I like them. Our waitress was very friendly and constantly checking up on us, catering to our every need. I'll admit, it was a bit on the pricey side.... okay, it was VERY PRICEY (each breakfast costs more than $10 a piece), but I think it was worth it. I wouldn't come here every day at such high prices, but I think it would be fine as an occasional stop (celebrations, random lazy mornings.) If you are ever visiting here, like I am, or if you live here and are looking for a quick bite to eat, full of flavor, I would definitely suggest eating here.

Are you kidding me...this young punk ass kid soliciting a tip from my dad, who is 83!!!  FUCK YOU!!  First of all it's none of his damn business if a tip is left!  2nd who the hell is he to solicit a tip!  I should have asked for the manager immediately but just wanted to leave because the longer I stayed the better chance I would have beat his ass!!

The last time i went there though i had a delicious meal that i couldn't stop thinking about. I guess there's a 1st time for everything!

The dish was scrambled egg ontop of a tortilla, that had enchilada sauce ontop with green onions and sour cream. It was amazing. so flavorful. i ate until i felt like throwing up. you could choose different options.

you could have it with;

-bacon, sausage, pancakes & hash browns
or
-bacon, pancakes and hash browns
or
-sausage, pancakes and hash browns.

i exchanged my hash browns for french fries :)

in the end i couldn't even eat everything. my pancakes were left untouched. every thing else was eaten..

2639423,2010-10-18,2,PpHnxQaRP2JNjJODQDX9GA,"Sometimes we have late night cravings.... and my neighborhood IHOP is just a few minutes away... Yippy Hooray!

We ( my date and I ) used to be regulars here, since it's the nearest 24hr. place to eat when he gets off work late and he doesn't have much of an appetite to eat alone unless I accompany him, so usually around 4a.m., we eat together for early breakfast/late night dinner 3x a week... yes the pounds did catch on, but luckily we don't have our ritual of weekly IHOP anymore or we would be in big trouble.

Our server Monica usually takes care of us... She's upbeat, great sense of humor, cheerful, and loves to sing out loud... which I actually admire. It really puts us in a extra happy go feeling to witness it. One of the reasons why we always go back there :)

This visit... Monica remembered us after being MIA for the whole summer, which was really nice to hear her say ""how you guys been?!?"" Love her warm welcome and remembering our fruit drinks order every time. I asked her how the new Pumpkin Pancakes are and she was so animated and held her hands to her chest and told me it's to die for. So by that remark... I ordered the Pumpkin Pancake Combo - which comes with eggs, hash browns, and either sausage or bacon. I ordered mine with egg whites only and sprinkled with cheddar cheese, since she asked if I would like some, but was charged an extra $1 for that cheese, which wasn't worth it, since it was just a few sprinkles. 

The Pumpkin Pancakes were not huge in size, but almost the same size as a hamburger patty if not a bit bigger. I drizzled some Pecan Syrup and didn't really need butter, since it's the salty kind, not rich and creamy. It was flavorful and the notes of cinnamon and allspice danced in my palette. My egg whites were fluffy and good. My sausages and hash browns were all quite tasty and yummy. 

The second dish we ordered was the Build Your Own Omelet consisting of: Provolone Cheese, Ham, Green Peppers, Onions, and Over-Roasted Tomatoes. I believe it was very hearty and delicious since he didn't offer to share a bite... usually that means too yummy to share. 

We always seem to enjoy our time here with the service and food. If you're ever craving late night food or just Pumpkin Pancakes that's only being served for a limited time... please take advantage of this before it's off the menu. I don't usually like pancakes, but this one was tasty and fulfilling. We left as happy campers as always....",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,5,4,5,6k4fljWG_wstp-gmA8PDmA

Came in today to enjoy my free birthday pancakes. Sign up at their website for their mailing list. Retail $8.99. Your choice of World Famous pancakes, top with Peach, Cinnamon Apple or Glazed strawberry.


Juan was our waiter, he's very friendly.  Our drinks have not hit empty. I had the Cinnamon Apple compote it was very good. A bit on the sweet side but very good! Next time I rather get the Strawberries. 

Food was hot but NOT great.. it was edible that's for sure.  Juan was a fantastic waiter we tip him 26% since he did pay close attention to his tables. 

You can eat here for under $10 a person it's a nice cheap place.

3225990,2013-03-04,0,PpHnxQaRP2JNjJODQDX9GA,"IHOP definitely fills the need for breakfast food in a jiffy. But to say that it's good breakfast food is a hit or miss. 

This location is busy on Sunday mornings. I'm sure it's busy at all IHOPs on Sunday mornings, but it was especially cramped here. Not too bad of a wait - about 5 minutes. We were seated at a small two-seater booth an arm's length away from a table of eight. One of the members at this table was a screaming baby and his screaming kid older sister. The mum of the screaming tyrannical kids was completely ignorant while she chowed down on her food. Cue the migraine headache. 

Can't ding IHOP for the screaming kids. But I can ding them on their food and their service. My mom and I both ordered whole wheat pancakes with blueberries that came with scrambled egg white substitute and turkey bacon. She says that was decent. I ordered the Split Decision plate. Two buttermilk pancakes, 2 French toast triangles, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon and 2 sausages for about $10. Simple, right? Can't mess this up too much here. Except they did. My breakfast plate came with a tub of butter right on top of my pancakes and french toast (or should I say my butter came with a side of breakfast?). I tried scooping the butter off to the side of my plate, except it melted onto my eggs and my bacon. Mmm. Bacon and butter - the ultimate greasy delight...not. 

Service was a joke. Our two-seater booth was very small. No biggie if there isn't anything else on our table. We didn't order coffee, but the coffee pot and the dish of creamer stayed on the table. I thought a server would be mindful enough to take that stuff away. Nope. It stayed until I flagged someone down to take those away so my mom and I could have some arm room to eat. 

I've been to this location a few times during late nights. Breakfast at 10 PM here is much better than breakfast at 10 AM. No questions asked.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,0,0,2,cBLQSayN5rhrMmbr27LAEQ

Cons: I often have trouble paying at the register. It frequently takes several minutes for someone to come assist me at the register. What really sucked was on Thanksgiving. I chose IHOP for breakfast because I had a local coupon from the back of my grocery receipt. When I went to pay, after waiting 10 minutes for the cashier at IHOP to put the register drawer together and then wait on other customers, she told me my coupon wasn't valid on holidays. She talked to me as if I knew that and was trying to pull one over on her. She was not personable, and I was confused. After taking the coupon back, I saw ""not valid on holidays"" in very fine print. I felt embarassed and as if I had been taken advantage of.

4363113,2018-07-01,0,PpHnxQaRP2JNjJODQDX9GA,"We all have those nights. You know the ones, when you're out late, maybe the nightclub lets out at 4am, or the bar lets out at 2am and you have some trouble corralling all your friends again to the car in one piece. You just missed closing time of your favorite late night taqueria, or maybe you're just not in the mood for Mexican food, or that certain someone needs to eat, chill out and sober up so they can eventually get home safely, that's usually when I end up at this 24 hour IHOP. That, and 24 hour food joints in Las Vegas close to home are hard to come by.

There's a select few waiters and waitresses that are very hard working (often the only ones on duty) and friendly (smiles and salutations) who always ask if we need water or juice to begin with (they see some of our party is still clearly inebriated and/or dehydrated) and promptly ask us to order. Usually we aren't prepared as soon as they think and we ask them to come back in a few. On more than one occasion that ""few"" has turned into 10, 15, even 20 minute separations. Yes, I understand that there's not going to be 8 waiters on duty at that hour, but sometimes there's only 2-3 tables dining in the restaurant at that time, so how could we be forgotten that easily?

Once ordered, the food usually comes out quicker than the wait between our waiter's first than our eventual second visit where they took our order. Orders are accurate, food is warm enough, and eating the food is usually the quickest stage of the restaurant experience. Waiting for the bill is more often than not another lengthy process, but if you're assertive, just go walk up to the front counter; you're more likely to be noticed there.

Thanks IHOP for making those nights just a little more manageable.",6NK3jFV7T0oOIt2lRaSBUA,0,0,3,KFylFhoMrlJRKnIDhf6ueA
4407173,2016-01-03,2,PpHnxQaRP2JNjJODQDX9GA,"I had to meet some friends from LA earlier today....and I suggested we all go eat. My friend's boyfriend apparently was demanding IHOP.. And I couldn't have been more annoyed and confused. But... I didn't want to be difficult so I just went with it.. Sure enough, the old people's home, dusty, dirty and dingy vibe hit you at the door. Shockingly, it was very crowded but we were seated right away in probably one of their biggest booths. So that was a plus. I'm not even going to get started on the number of unappetizing things I saw before I even ordered... I can't complain about that when I'm at an IHOP, or can I? 

Anyways...I start looking at the menu, after seeing grilled tilapia, some salads and chicken fried steak dishes ... I started thinking of the complete jerks that actually go to IHOP and order tilapia. It reminded me of one of those times I was always told, ""you don't go to a hotdog stand and order sushi"". I knew then and there to stop looking at their 30 page menu and stick to PANCAKES!! I ordered a stack of pancakes with raspberries and white chocolate chips w/ cream cheese frosting, and two pieces of crispy bacon... Definitely one of their 'specialty stacks'. 
My girlfriend ordered a 2X2X2... And her boyfriend, (the IHOP sympathizer) ordered eggs/ bacon and two pancakes.. 

I was very glad I ordered what I did when all the meals came... Their eggs literally looked like hard and shiny plastic, mustard yellow, scrambled kids' kitchen-toy-food. Holy schmokes those 'eggs' could literally be on Fear Factor... These IHOP eggs are really eggs', the way McDonald's chicken Nuggets, are really 'chicken'. 

My food was good... I'm going to demote that to OK as I reflect on them while writing this. They weren't terrible by any means.. But they weren't evenly cooked.. They were very cold and now that I think about it... I am pissed I didn't say something or ask for them to be heated. I literally thought nothing of eating cold pancakes.. And to be honest.. I probably wouldn't have considered handing back an open plate with my food on it, at IHOP only because how many germs must be floating around at any given time. They squeeze so many people, at one time into that dining area... That it literally feels like a cafeteria packed full of every portly senior citizen, west of the strip. Back to my cold pancakes, even for white chocolate chip raspberry pancakes...and considering I was at the international house of pancakes they were subpar. 

I feel with all the wonderful mom and pop shops.. Going to one of these places should be a cardinal sin, and I am now prepared to lose friends the next time one suggests we go to IHOP, for a delicious Saturday breakfast. Come to think of it, if any of my friends frequent IHOP.. We're not that close. I don't say this to be stuck up... At all.....I LOVE a good hole in the wall, if their food is superb and the place is authentic/ is ran with passion. 

But, IHOP is where food goes to die and where geriatrics go to find dates and/ or friends.  The atmosphere and energy of this restaurant, honestly remind me of eating in a smoky dining hall, inside a hospice care center, in the middle of Nebraska. Did I mention the atmosphere was terrible?!?!  But again, what did I expect?? I keep bringing this review back to the fact that my expectations seem to have been set unrealistically high for a trip to IHOP. But shouldn't my expectations always be high when I eat out?? I mean, who do I keep giving IHOP any slack.. Hell they're been around so long, NONE of these mistakes should ever be happening!!

If I was rating on service alone, this place would get 4/5 or 5/5. Only reason a possible 4/5 was the hostess, who was very nice- didn't look clean or bathed. Her hair was pulled back messily and very greasy, w/ noticeable dandruff everywhere.. and her clothes were filthy.. Stains everywhere. And they were black... Not sure if this should help or hurt these facts...Regardless, these aren't good things to see when you're trying to build an appetite. And... I'm never one to go around trying to judge if someone has showered, but in a restaurant- a hostess MUST look clean and presentsentable. 

In summation: Bacon, which I ordered crispy was a 2/10. White chocolate pancakes with raspberries and cream cheese frosting... 4/10. Atmosphere 0/10. Service 9/10. 

The only thing I've learned after eating here against my will, was to ALWAYS speak up and veto a trip to IHOP.

On top of all this, the place was like a sauna!!! Are they cutting back on energy costs by not running the AC? It was uncomfortably hot in here.
