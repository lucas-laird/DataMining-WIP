They do not give out water or ranch with the order which was the first let down. So i spent 2 dollars for water and 89 cents for ranch (bummer) it's not the money... it's the point of good service if you order hot wings they should include sauce with the order and charge more not make me add it on .... The girl at the front was rude and kept answering my questions with attitude all the while my Togo took 30 minutes (another bummer). The sauces are good but the manager and food chain needs to have a talk with the people who work at this location (one girl impaticular) As well as including ranch in my order.   

On a side note only 1 girl was rude but 2 others made up for it at the end. The wings were also really good which is why I'm changing from 2 stars to 3. Drink machine was also a plus",Fc_MRj7Ryyjk8MnxsI2uGg,0,0,3,Yjad6mQ5jOY2Hjk97v48vA

And I was warned but I didn't listen ... and ordered 'boneless wings' which are basically breaded chunks of chicken breast. They were to greasy and breading was soggy by the time we got back to the house. Fries were not that great either. 
This kind of food should probably be eaten right at the establishment otherwise it will turn into greasy soggy mess. 
So 3* for now but I might stop by again sometime and try their 'real' chicken wings to see if they live up to promise.",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,2,0,3,H9ie0C1KvXqLWvltKj00eA
330183,2008-03-21,0,6u_6RV0qDaTQyYqZTzl3XA,"I've been to a few of the various Wing Stop locations around Vegas and Henderson, and this is definitely my favorite one so far.  

--This one isn't located right next to a donut shop, so there's no temptation for dessert afterwards!
--The tables and restaurant are always pretty clean.
--The usual guy, Steve, is a total hoot.  He's a great dynamic guy and encourages his team to be friendly, fun, personable folks instead of fast food zombies.
--THE WINGS!  They are so are SO good.  They make your wings fresh to  order, so you have to wait but it's completely worth it!
--They have the best fast food french fries in the world.  No seriously.  No really.  YES!
--Most of their business is take-out, so the small place can always easily accommodate it's dine in customers.
--Customers have the option to order their wings online or over the phone for pick up.

A few tips:
Unless you like soggy chicken, I wouldn't recommend the boneless wings or boneless strips.  They are great chunks of chicken breast, but the sauces really sogg up the breading and just sort of cause them to bleh out.
Atomic should come with a surgeon general's warning.  I love hot spicy foods, but these are ridiculous.",ScAkGG5VXHNpnMYsGtaadg,3,2,4,aLfGmzVC1CISrpYRdfSxeQ

620989,2016-02-07,0,6u_6RV0qDaTQyYqZTzl3XA,"Location: I have become more of a fan for this particular Wing Stop since they expanded essentially doubling their dining room size.  It became a lot more roomy with well, more TVs, Tables/chairs and a second soda machine (which is place facing the expanded space so it doesn't get overcrowded). The space makes the place more inviting to sit down, enjoy your meal, chat and leave at your own pace. For the most part, it is kept very clean, maybe a tray here and there left on the table but the staff is good on cleaning up soon after someone leaves. 

Staff: The cashiers that have taken my orders or gave my to go orders in the past have all been smiles, friendly and easy to talk to when talking about the food. Even when there's a crowd they have maintained a positive vibe and don't rush you. Don't believe I have ever had a complaint with the staff. 

The food/drinks: wings were nice and hot and sauces are great. I have stuck mainly with traditional wings with veggies and ranch dressing but it has never disappointed me yet. I think the prices are fair for the quality of the wings. The soda machines are the coca-cola freestyle machines that you can choose a lot of soda options with flavorings. Those machines are awesome. 

Overall, great place to get wings if you want a clean environment and good quality wings without the dim lit and craziness you might find at a Buffalo Wild Wings or some other dive.

The place was really clean, alot of space, and the atmosphere was very welcoming.  The only drawback is when speaking to the young lady at the counter you really can't hear her because of the tvs that are on and the noise from the meals being prepped. I think maybe they need to shut that part off to eliminate some of that extra noise when speaking to someone at that counter.  

I didn't get any combo meals because I didn't want my fries to be sitting there although they had my wings ready when I arrive but the fries probably wouldn't be cold.  I ordered the 20 piece boneless wings alone and ordered 10 hot and 10 of the Louisiana cajun rub.  The wings were a pretty descent size but nothing as big as Buffalo Wild Wings but they weren't too little.  The hot wings were pretty good and the since it was my first time trying to Louisiana rub it was pretty good too.  However one of them seemed to have too much salt on them and it probably was the Louisiana rub.  My tolerance for salt has significantly been reduced because of my high blood pressure so I'm not a big salt fan anymore.  So I'm not sure if it actually was too salty or it was just my taste buds.

SInce this is the closest one to my house I probably be returning on service alone which goes a long way with me.  I usually prefer the other wing place (Buffalo Wild Wings) because their wings are alot bigger and meatier.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,1,0,3,FvrwCiJ12-sn9WEvBBTnxA

Their chicken wings and strips are currently available in 11 different flavors. The menu board has them listed in order of spiciness, which is very helpful. My favorite is the teriyaki bone-in wings. They have lots of flavor and a dipping sauce is not necessary. They are finger-licking good on their own. I'm not into spicy at all, but if you are into the obnoxious kind of spicy, my friends have recommended the atomic wings. They are at the top of the spiciness scale, so have something handy to cool your mouth down with. I also love the fries here. They are soft and perfect for dipping if you get them plain. You can also get them loaded with a nacho cheese sauce and jalapeños.

He was very loud and rude and I dare say if it was a more experienced staff that there would be grounds for termination. Management is supposed to be a good example. He led by fear. I'm one to speak my mind so I left and called the owner. I felt like I was on a WWYD segment. Anyway. I personally have not been back, but my family loves this place for wings. Last time we went we were shorted around 1/3 of the order. We were told they couldn't give a refund that night but it would be in the office next time we came.

The boneless wings are my favorite by far. There are so many awesome flavors to choose from and the food is always fresh and made to order. The fries are addicting-do they seriously put a salt/sugar mix on them? Never in my life have I had better fries. No joke. And the ranch is amazing. Amazing. 

The manager at this location is a really cool dude who's always friendly and personable and makes you feel like a friend, not just a customer.

The tables are small and they aren't cleaned off in a timely manner once the customers leave. 

There is only one soda machine and that makes you have to occasionally wait in a short line. The bathrooms are kept locked and you have to ask the cashiers to unlock it, but when they are busy with taking orders you will either have to wait in a long line or just tuff it out :P. 

I didn't eat here because I felt the place didn't deserve my money, I would only recommend this place on their slow days.

This particular location is smaller then what I have previously been too, but still a great operation.  The staff is super friendly and welcoming.  There is a small seating area and some TVs to watch during lunch.  It is a nice place to grab a fast lunch and be out quickly.

The boneless chicken wings are delightful, especially the Louisiana Rub flavored ones.  YUMMY!  I have tried pretty much all of the flavors and I don't think you can go wrong with any of them.  The lemon pepper flavor is quite interesting though.  I usually get a few of those to go in the mix just because it is such a unique flavor.  I actually had a dream about the boneless wings from Wingstop.  You know it's good when you dream about the food!  I like the fries too.  They have a sweet & salty seasoning on them that make them tasty.

4451574,2011-10-18,0,6u_6RV0qDaTQyYqZTzl3XA,"My go-to when I have any kind of chicken wing is typically a boneless wing with mild hot sauce. Suffice to say, Wing Stop can provide me with that when I feel like it. However, I think BWW beats Wing Stop in the boneless category. If you're going to go to Wing Stop definitely get the bone-in. They are massive with lots 'o meat! Very different from most chicken wings.

On my last trip here I went out of the box and got half of my wings mild and the other half the lemon-pepper (it's a rub) and I did it based off of Melia S.'s review. Well, luckily I wasn't disappointed. I really did enjoy the lemon-pepper, but unfortunately my mild wings barely had any sauce on them! Most of the sauce was pooled in the bottom of the container. Kind of disappointing.

I have had their yummy french fries in the past, but the last time I got fries from this location they were kinda soggy and not so good. I guess you just gotta get them at the right time or something. 

Also, and the last thing - their ranch here is very thin, not goopy, and I mean goopy in a good way, like when I have a chicken wing I want the ranch to STICK to it, not roll off!

The service was ok I mean they gave me enough time to see what I wanted and when I was ready I still was waiting for a couple minutes. Nothing too bad to complain about but that's what happened.

I ordered the 3 chicken strip meal, parmesan and garlic, usually i'd go for hot and mild sometimes.

The atmosphere was cool and filled with airplane parts and had a couple of tv's which wasn't too shabby.

The flavor was alright although you can taste the parmesan and garlic, it wasn't too strong, the texture was semi crunchy if not dry although there were small bits that were a little soggy, The fries just seemed kinda greasy and soft but did have that salt and sweet taste, The ranch was really rich and creamy though. They did have a multi drinks mixer but I just had water...maybe next time i'll try the lemonade.

It's convenient for me to call it in and then it's on my way home so I just stop and pick it up.  This location is on lamb and stewart, in the Smith's shopping center.  It's a pretty sketchy area but it's always crowded in there.  

$13.14 got me 8 bone-in wings (half mild and half garlic parmesean), fries, two warm buttered rolls, a drink, veggie sticks, and ranch dressing.  

Wing stop has my favorite wings because they are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The worst thing in the world to me is some gummy, fatty, wings.  

On my latest visit I was treated to an old homeless man with no legs staring at me while I waited for my wings.  He puttered outside in his rascal and sat right outside the front door begging everyone who walked in/out of the restaurant.  I'm human and compassionate and all that shit but I don't like to be harassed while I'm tryin' to score some wings.  

My order has never been wrong here.  And the employees are efficient and friendly.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,6,4,4,zK7ngI5Kv1bD7YR3sWeaUQ

The mango habanero was the only bare able one taste wise. You guys need to update the flavors on your menu, not to mention it was a bit over priced. I might update if they ever decide to update their current menu.",3EUpmimFxx1enxaF0BqffQ,0,0,2,NVn60yN97dOnMF7g58YUCA
