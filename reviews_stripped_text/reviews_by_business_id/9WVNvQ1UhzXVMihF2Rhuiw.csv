402114,2013-11-25,0,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,This place is great.  Three carne asada tacos with some chips and beans and a drink for 3.99.  Prices are very inexpensive and the food is great.  The decor inside is just booths.  Nothing fancy.  Great place for authentic Mexican food.,19zFUC-cuunVaDGJWJscdA,1,0,5,LgVLH7rwB5OkzhV8JgxhhQ

852085,2010-01-12,0,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,"Scott D. has this place pretty much spot on.  We usually order the Gringo dinner (I think that is what its called) which is burger and fries with 3 tacos.  It's around $6 and its all pretty decent.  Its cheap and quick, basically.  Similar to Tacos Mexico (which is just down the street), if you live in the area its a good place to go but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.  We would usually hit it up on our way back from the Palms.

Don't expect much more than typical mexican food with some american stuff thrown in and you'll be happy you came.",kodN4VHOHqvq8Zu2LSbxLg,1,0,3,isTyEDPzde9E6ooQF2oWIQ
926883,2015-09-18,0,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,Love this place. Super Nachos and the chicano meal is enough for 4 people $25.00 is a great price just need to add more drinks. The lady who takes the order is always nice and I have never had a bad experience with food or service. Would have added a picture however I didnt have Yelp before I ate it! Go and enjoy.

On top of the mediocre food they wouldn't take the restaurant.com coupon which was the reason to try eating here in the first place. Bottom line is I wouldn't go back.",u1QAn4o9YdFPbymgQSDe-w,1,0,1,6slWu0MtifkhhQszwpDNPw
1166957,2017-04-18,0,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,"Rigos is ummm ok i guess.  The service is great, and quick.  However the food is lacking flavor.  It's not bad, but i feel like they have the potential to be great.  I've been there several times, and each time I've left feeling a little bit  unsatisfied. 

The carne asada is simply just cooked meat.  Nothing stands out about it.   They do give generous food portions tho.",yI27yodFNujaCHlNDr_rVw,0,0,3,ZoYvdUnKuStTCZzllV4l8A
1355742,2016-02-20,0,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,"Their Carne Asada Fries are amazing! They use these nice thick fries & are very courteous with their portions.  I always add extra carne & it's so worth it.  Their chili beans are homemade & you can't find anything like it anywhere else. They have some salsa selections, wish they had something spicier, but the grilled onions in the bar are delicious! Only other dislike is the extra charge for using debit cards.",ifJj3wrGeb0p9wxF9rX10A,0,0,5,xZTR05ZyN1qcuIAcEUVY-w

We always get the lunch special which consists of three perfectly portioned tacos and chips with refried beans. My office is located very close to their restaurant and my entire office staff  all visit on a weekly basis.,ZuKzmMY-oUDAu8-AcJ62_A,0,0,5,r-W_99p_AsgVfD0PSBwLNQ
1987414,2016-02-11,0,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,"Their burritos de lengua are the best in the city! I've tried them everywhere but none compare to Rigo's burritos. Also their Horchata water and red salsa. It's my favorite place to grab and go. The staff is attentive and always friendly. I've been a customer since 2010 and no other place in Las Vegas makes their burritos so big and so delicious. It's close to the strip by the way, don't hesitate and try their burritos",1IAuZhwpbGl8jwN2DTkh-w,0,1,4,kfSSRahoCKH4xbPHoD-FAg
1997164,2016-03-18,0,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,"A good place to stop for quick cheap lunch if you're in the area. They have specials (although they've been increasing in price over the years) such as 3 taco plate and burger w fries. It's not unlike other taco shops. Order at the counter & they prep your food & you pick it up at the counter. You can also call in your order and pick it up. 

They offer traditional taco shop fare such as carne asada, chicken, lengua etc. Menu Items include burritos, tacos, tortas, rolled tacos, carne asada fries and oddly enough cheeseburgers.  I really like their pickled carrots & red salsa & the food is better than a nearby taco shops on Sahara. 

Due to location, the clientele include mostly blue collar guys. It's okay to visit during the day, but I avoid the neighborhood at night.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,0,1,5,0cavLq7cPEhbP_-InR_9_A
2103913,2015-11-18,1,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,"It's hard to believe that I come here for the cheeseburgers, but I do. They aren't the best burgers in the world, but they are reasonably priced and taste good. The patties are pretty thin, so I usually get a double. They take a sesame bun, grill it, and slather their version of thousand island on both sides. Then they add fresh shredded lettuce, sliced tomato and onions. I don't know why the burger is so delicious, but it keeps me coming back. I sometimes get their burger special, which comes with fries and a fountain drink for around $5. I think it's extra to make the burger a double, but it is still a good deal.

Not into burgers? They have other food as well. Tacos, burritos, taquitos and nachos are the mains. The nachos come with your choice of meat, beans and liquid cheese, but I don't like liquid cheese on my nachos. I do like to get the cheese on the side to dip my fries into though. Speaking of fries, they come very well seasoned and it is a bit overpowering, so I order my fries sans salt. Many of the dishes come with tortilla chips, so load up on some fresh made salsas at the salsa bar. They also have a hot bar with pinto beans and grilled jalapenos. Oh and they have a music box to play tunes while you eat!",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,3,4,4,6OoR7kJbXJw-EUV-iUlFjw
2273607,2017-10-13,0,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,"I love love love their Chicken Salad.  Chicken is grilled and cut into small pieces and laid on a bed of lettuce with carrot shavings, shredded cheese, white onion and tomatoes... PLUS they add orange wedges and a side of Thousand Island type dressing (I'm sure they make in-house) and it's so delicious! Price is a bit high at $8 or $9 but the entire take out tray is full and super pack and it barely closes

I highly recommend you try it and share the salad with a person.  Trust me, you won't finish it yourself",sq8k-bdQwKFu6wwWoVGmxg,0,1,5,zcaH5ZNtKbmFR6h8sD_3_Q
2710279,2016-05-17,0,9WVNvQ1UhzXVMihF2Rhuiw,"ive been coming here for years! Used to be awesome until they decided that people that begs for food deserves better device than their usual customers who normally spend about $50 dlls every time they come. They decided it was best to give away tacos to a lady bothering her customers and allow her to eat and keep bothering people that just spent money on their business. Sorry but if I go somewhere to eat I expect to eat peacefully and comfortable. She kept harassing the people I was with and ""Lupe"" did nothing to keep her customers most of our food was thrown away the lady was allowed to have FREE food and bother people. When I asked to speak with the manager according to them ""Lupe""another one she was defensive her story was differentno asked for my money back since my good was thrown away and she gave a whole other story the managers name and number was declined also the owners number. This is a business that has been out there for a while u all know better than that! Alex has always been nice and help his customers but the shit that just happen really took me by surprise I understand the act of kindness by giving someone food however Lupe hanging up on me when o asked for a manager and that other Lupe claiming to know it all and be the person in charge and call us a liar. Whoever is the owner ""Rigoberto Melendez"" needs to take care of his people and be available for his usual clients.

Consistent. Always the same thing. Burgers & Fries are REALLY good. Tacos are good, NOT very spicy though, red & green sauce are a little mild. They do not grill the tortillas. Which is good if you don't like the mess BUT if you like them flavorful you WANT grilled tortillas
A MEDIOCRE MEXICAN TACO STAND A real nice lunch spot. If you only have 30 minutes and you just wanna get full this is good for you. YOU need to special order here and tell them to add chileS to everything to spice it up but the MEATS are very tender & good NOT that OTHER stuff.

It's the simplest thing to make and because of that I won't go back here. Sorry but not sorry. Put more effort in the food instead of trying to make it so fast.
