Not an izakaya, but you sure have your choice of appetizer items.  I just sat at the bar and ordered about 3 appetizers for myself and I was stuffed.  There is one cook at the counter who grills, cooks, and prepares the sushi platters.  Shishamo (don't see this often on menus), Agedashi tofu (not used to this style but it was tasty), and Wakame Salad (too large for one person) were the items I ordered.

My friends dragged me here, and my friend that worked here insisted that I come by sometime, so this killed 2 birds with one stone.

I sat down, and was really surprised by the variety of ramen they had.  I eventually settled on the miso ramen, nice and simple.  Also ordered a small beef bowl as well, as I'm a sucker for good beef bowl.

The soup came, and it was pretty good.  Wasn't as amazing as I heard, but again, I have some sort of weird high standard for ramen that has stuck with me ever since coming back Stateside.  The beef bowl was really good, and I can see myself coming back for that very easily.  The meat was flavorful and the rice wasn't too hard and grainy nor too soft and soggy.

I REALLY like this place!  I went twice last week, and had the uni ikura bowl (yummy!), takoyaki (yummy!), kim chee fried rice (not enough seasoning), chirashi (yummy! a great value and very filling!), kinako mochi (yummy!), and bluefin tuna sushi (a little gristly).  If any of my friends want to have lunch in that area, I will always suggest we go to Yokohama Kaigenro.  They also sell a few Japanese snacks, candy, seasoning, rice, produce, and refrigerated items, which is nice to know, since I haven't found a decent Japanese market in LV yet (other than the International Market).  This will be a great place to take my visiting friends before dropping them off at the airport!

Update 2/14/07:
Had the Tsukemen (can you say YUM?!), shishyamo (good), and the grilled hamachi collar (YUMMY!). I am really starting to like this place alot because they are open all day, family friendly, and I can get some Pocky sticks and other snacks on my way out!  Check out the pics I posted!

Update 3/16/07:
There is a Yokohama Kaigenro in Los Angeles!  They have the same exact menu!  It's located in the Mitsuwa Marketplace (formerly Yaohan Plaza), right by the entrance of Mitsuwa!

Update 4/9/07:
Oh Man!  They increased the price of their Chirashi by $2.00!  But now it comes with soup and salad, so I guess that's ok.  BTW, the ika geso (deep fried squid legs) are yummy!

Update: 6/24/08

The ramen noodles will be in a stock created from pork and chicken bone, and then the kicker zing is when the stock is seasoned with soy sauce.  by far my most favorite ramen to order is the Tsukemen.  i love this b/c it's not your typical big bowl o' ramen.  it's actually a two separate items...a plate full of cold ramen egg noodles, and a hot bowl of ramen stock filled with a hard boiled egg, some salty pieces of charshu (pork), and garnished with some cabbage, green onions, and seaweed.  you basically take some noodles into your soup spoon and dip it into the broth.   i always order this at this restaurant.  no other restaurant in vegas (so far i have found) has this dish.  They also have a similar dish with crispy salty fried chicken instead of pork.  I also love the uni-ikura bowl...chunks of chilled creamy orange uni (sea urchin)  topped with a plethora of the salty orange ikura (salmon roe) on top of sushi rice garnished with sesame seed and nori strips.  there are many things on the menu.  they have many more types of ramen, but i just can't stray from my favorite.  so, if you're looking for a hot bowl of ramen on a cold evening in vegas, i really suggest this place.  the bad-ass thing about this place is that it opens at 11:30am and closes at 2am!!  it even has a small grocery store inside, so you can find weird japanese snacks, candies and drinks.  also, many of the customers of this place are japanese.

Yelped ""ramen"" and this place was one of the top choices, plus it closes at 1 am and is not far from Embassy Suites Convention Center.  The location is in a small L shapped strip mall kitty corner from CVS Pharmacy.

Service was friendly and reasonably fast.  We ordered two pork stock ramen (king size), tempora odon, and agidashi tofu (fried tofu).  The kids split one of the ramen, but turned out they like the odon more.  King size is suppose to be regular sized and queen is small, according to the wait staff.  Wrong!  King size turned out to be huge.  I was stuffed by the pork ramen.  

Over all, I'm impressed and would have given this place a 4 star for open till late and a solid authentic ramen.  The miss was the location of the booth with was too close to the bar where a few late night patrons and the bar tender and wait staff were rather too loud.  And there were no kimchi on the table, which I thought was a standard for ramen shop.  But i think this place is not technically a ramen shop.  I wanted an order of uni sushi and was told they didn't have it.  Too bad... I love uni.

Oh the agidashi tofu i thought was execellent.

The planets aligned this week: I was in town, in need of a ramen fix and waiting to pick up a friend at McCarran airport. It would be risking some major bachi to not eat here-- I basically had no choice.

I ordered the kimchee ramen and half order of fried rice. My ramen was cooked the way I like it-- boiling hot, noodles just slightly firm (chewy) and the noodle to kimchee ratio was perfect. I have to admit that I was expecting more than just noodles and kimchee (my fault, I should have read the menu) next time, I'll add bean sprouts, charsiu and maybe corn. The fried rice was unremarkable and next time, I'll order something else. 

I must admit that I usually gravitate to places that only serve ramen when I am on a noodle binge. The menu here has me wondering why, as I'm thinking chirashi would go quite well with a bowl of ramen. Or hamachi collar, or just about everything else on the menu.

Friendly staff and has free wi-fi as well (good for the busy student or business worker). This is a favorite restaurant to go to after a late night of studying at the Lied Library at UNLV. This restaurant opens pretty late.

They have a little store at the entrance for like various japanese candies and snacks. Seating for restaurant is in another room next to it. 

Menu has a variety of rice bowls, ramen, appetizers, as well as sushi. Have never tried the sushi though. 

Each table is served with a plate of edamame before order. 

Their ramen is pretty big sized with a variety of soups/toppings like mabo tofu, curry, etc. Not too much of a fan of their ramen. Reason is because they like to make their ramen soups thick. I guess is a way to coat the noodles with the soup for flavor. Its still pretty good nonetheless. 

They also have a wide variety of rice bowls like gyudon (beef bowl), oyakodon (chicken and egg bowl), chiraishi (sashimi bowl), etc. Beef bowl was pretty good. Decent amount of beef with a little side of red ginger. Oyakodon was pretty good as well. Marinated chicken and eggs steamed together over rice. Their chiraishi is one of the bigger ones in town (though is more expensive as well) but it definately has its quality as well. Good amount of toppings. Fresh fish as well. 

They have a decent lunch special as well with like a full order of ramen and a 1/2 order of a rice bowl to the size with salad or something too.

This shop in a run down strip mall next to Hard Rock has a Japanese chef and staff. The restaurant has 3 booths and tables to seat about 56, with sushi bar counter seating another 7. The menu has many Japanese fare including Ramen and Sushi. There were 4 other groups when I entered. 3 of the 4 groups were Japanese.

Today, I tried the Ramen since I have not found a good Ramen place in Vegas yet. I tried the Char Siu Men, Queen size. I liked the Queen size as it was just the right size for me. Some people may think this is 1/2 size ramen ;-) The Men (noodle) is medium thick, with good consistency. The soy based soup is nothing spectacular, but not bad. Other than Char Siu, this Ramen came with sliced grilled garlic, bok choy, memma (bamboo shoots), green onions, and 1/2 boiled egg.
Definitely better than Togoshi, but still leaves a bit to be desired.

I also tried one pair of sushi. I ordered hamachi. @ $5.50 it is a bit pricey, but the quality of the fish was excellent with sufficient fattyness, and did not have the ""frozen many times"" consistency I found at Sushi Twister. The size is good, the rice firm and not mushy with the appropriate vinegar seasoning, and wasabi was included between the rice and fish.

Based on this, I would have to come back here for their sushi lunch special again, as I think this so far may be the best sushi I have had in Vegas.",-GKr2BY_1smem1y3D1l2Eg,0,0,4,9ab2vGtHB8CRADAmuTn43A

I also didn't mind that it is attached to a take out place with a small Japanese snack section. What did worry me was when we sat down and I opened the menu to find a huge selection with a bunch of Chinese food thrown in. ""Oh man"" I thought, ""not an 'Asian' cuisine restaurant."" One of those places that tries to do everything and ends up excelling at nothing. I was also put off by the high prices for the sushi. (I have since learned that sushi prices in Las Vegas are generally high.)

Then, I began to notice something. All the other patrons in the restaurant were speaking Japanese. I looked around and saw they had framed autographed napkins on the wall. The autographs were all in Japanese so I had no idea who they were from, but you figure they must have been people of some importance. So I figure all these Japanese people and Yelp couldn't be wrong and took another look at the menu. I still have no idea why a Japanese restaurant that attracts so many Japanese patrons would include so many Chinese dishes on their menu. They are across the street from the Hard Rock, but I doubt they attract much of the Hard Rock crowd.

I eventually was drawn to the cold soba. Such a simple dish, yet few Japanese restaurants offer it. I decided to have that, agedashi tofu, and one of their specialty rolls. My friend got a ramen dish, a specialty roll, and a grilled squid.,, or at least he tried. He said squid, but pointed to the wrong item in the menu. We got some weird squid dish in what I think was a fermented bean paste instead. I have no idea what we were supposed to do with it. It was way too salty to be eaten alone I think. Was it some sort of condiment? 

Anyway, I ended up enjoying my meal a lot. I ordered simple dishes and they really hit the spot. I'm looking forward to trying this place again the next time I am in town. I might even try one of their Chinese dishes.",DgrkaxfNoMP1nGGrDcpkOw,0,0,4,mE0-ecYwOKhA9E9MWeE4dQ

We came here after all the positive reviews by Yelpers for their ramen.

Their tonkotsu ramen totally lacks pork flavour and would be more suitably called shio/salt broth ramen instead. The pieces of pork are not marinated and are tough. The egg noodles were overcooked and lacked elasticity that comes with house-made noodles.The bean sprouts were sad looking in the bowl. A bowl of ramen here cost $9.95 which is rather expensive seeing how other places give you more for less.

Also tried their Japanese-styled meatloaf which was subpar. Too much filler (ie, bread crumbs), not enough meat. The sauce overtop was too strong (it had a distinct Worchestershire sauce flavour that was overpowering). It came with miso soup, bowl of rice, some shredded cabbage, slices of tomato and cucumber. Overall, edible but not much else to recommend it.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,2,2,8yFLqdeGeYzMdLsxpbS4Fw

2294309,2009-03-18,1,gGeuQKUBP7zAz2YTqpHHCw,"The strip mall Yokohama Kaigenro is located in has seen better days. Walking up the street I was momentarily torn by the signs advertising vietnamese food and other eats in the same location. Turning the corner into the parking lot, though, my options were clear: only Yokohama Kaigenro remains open.

Seven of us piled into the restaurant, stopping momentarily to gawk at the mini-grocery store of Japanese items near the front before being ushered into the back dining room. We arrived at the early dining time of 5pm, but there were still a handful of diners enjoying their meals. 

Yokohama Kaigenro is decorated similar to other family-run Japanese restaurants I've been to. Nothing flashy, with signs on the walls and tables indicating dishes not on the menu or specials. 

The menu was extensive - three folds! - and started to call into question my quest for ramen. Compromising, I ordered a few pieces of sushi and the tonkotsu ramen. The rest of my group ordered ramen and zaru soba. 

The regular ramen was a good portion - nothing unfinishable and for once I almost managed to slurp up all the soup in my bowl. Pieces of bamboo and the random cabbage leaf floated amongst the usual suspects of egg, noodle, and pork. I was disappointed at the paltry portion of pork - one large piece that was slightly gristly and not very flavorful. I would have regretted ordering extra char siu. The tonkotsu broth was enjoyable - not too sweet or salty but still lacking the oily depth of flavor that I miss from my bowls of ramen in Tokyo. I'd still be happy to have Yokohama Kaigenro as a ramen option in my neighborhood, though!

I had saba and tamago sushi on the side. The tamago was spot-on with the slight sweetness, and the saba was a decent cut. The sushi rice was warm, lightly flavored.

For dessert I caved and had the mochi ice cream - vanilla and chocolate on the recommendation of our waitress despite the other exotic options of matcha and mango. I almost couldn't finish the ice cream, stuffed as I was from the ramen and sushi! 

Our service was quite attentive and accommodating from start to finish - the waitress even agreed to provide us with seven different checks! 

Yokohama Kaigenro's staying power certainly has something to do with the food and humble quality of the restaurant. It's no secret, either. I had to laugh when two Japanese women stopped by our table on their way out and asked, ""how do you know what to order?"" eying our bowls of ramen and zaru soba. I was unsure about what we were eating that made us so ""in the know"" but we smiled. A friend motioned to myself and another friend, offering: ""uh, well, they're both part-Japanese..."" They smiled back and nodded, admitting they had to drive all the way from Utah to find food as good as here.  I have to agree.",6seReeoedEmYzGr-3Z5_Ig,3,3,4,oAIIURjtDyGNRBlKLlvi4w

I ordered the Pork Broth ramen, my wife the Miso ramen, and an order of pot stickers, shumai, and seaweed salad.

The Taste:
My pork ramen was okay.  I liked the rich porky flavor, the smell was okay as well.  The broth was in my opinion too salty.  Ramen is supposed to be salty but this was extreme.  I ended up finishing two glasses of iced green tea just getting through the noodles.  The fried garlic in the soup was burnt and VERY bitter.  The ramen noodles were alright, they could have been chewier.

The Miso ramen was very strange tasting, borderline nasty.  My wife took a small bite of the noodles and toppings, became shaken at the flavors but then gave it one more shot before putting down her chopsticks for the night.  I thought likewise of the bowl.

The shumai and pot stickers were tasty.  But I wasn't floored by them.

The Price:
Here is where I thought this place could do a lot better.  10$ for a bowl of ramen is a little high but okay.  But the shumai was $5 for 5 pieces and the Gyoza was $5 for 5 pieces.  That seems a bit out of line for what they were.

The wait staff did not come back for some time that night and they took too long to bring our check.  We ended up leaving there around 8:30 for a 1-1/2 Hour stay.  Too long... and went off to find something to eat for my wife.

This stuff is one of the better bowls of soup that I've had around Vegas. It's a shame that only offer one size of ramen, whereas before, they offered a small and a large. The bowl they serve now is just a large bowl, with $2 noodle refills. Just one noodle bowl seems to do the job for me though. I used to order the small size when they had it. Now I have no choice but to slurp up a huge bowl of ramen and drown myself in savory sodium.

Whenever I drop by, I find myself ordering the basic Japanese entrees that they have. Most dishes range from your typical chicken teriyaki meals, pork cutlet based dishes, sushi, and a variety of bowls. They have many other items, but I haven't gotten around to trying them (The udon and fried rice omelet items are on my 'to eat' list). The food is very simple. Nothing fancy, nothing surprising. With menu items called ""pork cutlet with gravy"" you get exactly what you order. It's simple, good Japanese food.

-pork base ramen*
-Japanese meatloaf*
-fried tofu with ginger sauce* (good app)

One or two other groups are usually spread out within the dining area. English isn't something I hear regularly over here. I usually just sit there quietly like the clueless American native that I am and eat whatever is put in front of me.  Around the bar, they usually have two small TVs up on the ceiling playing random stuff. I found myself peeping an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation while I munched silently on some tofu. The place is somewhat small, yet cozy. It's a comfortable place to be. I can see myself dropping by every once in a while for a quick Japanese fix.

Enter from the market side where you can buy from a very small variety of fresh Japanese vegetables, like daikon. They also have a little packaged snack area where they sell Japanese confections like Yan Yan. Oh, God, so good ... 

Our waitress was a little Japanese girl in a pink kimono. She was scarce after she took our order. Then it was pretty much the curt little man helping us out. 

I looked over the menu and wanted everything. But I just settled for the Kaigen ramen (seafood and veggies) and yellowtail collar. For $12, my ramen was only alright, but really big, as ramen should be. I barely made a dent in it and took it home for leftovers. For $11, the yellowtail collar was really, really good. It was nice and moist. I love the little bits of dark meat. My bf and I shared (fought over) that bad boy. 

For dessert we had kinako mochi. I didn't see it on the menu, but we were there with a couple of regulars who were on a mission. They knew exactly what they wanted. The mochi was $5 for four little pieces. But really good. I think they added brown sugar in with the kinako.

I know I can eat prime rib and crab legs at the casino buffets, but for some reason this place really has a place in my heart...and stomach.

Last year I went there with 2 other people and we ordered about 9 things!  It was sooo delicious!  We saw someone order this fried rice covered with an omelete looking thing and gravy all over!  Yummy!  We ordered it as well, and we went crazy over it.

This past weekend I went there again, and we ordered the tempura, nigiri Salmon sushi, cold noodle, and the rice omelete thing.  It was excellent!  The omelete could have been a little more salty, but it was fantastic none the less.

Next time I want to try this cold green tea looking drink.

You walk into the store and through the doorway on the left is the restaurant. I used to find lots of places like this in Taipei where there is the front of the house and then there is a small club, bar, or restaurant hidden through some door in the back. Although this place has a that legitimate business feeling. Still very cool. The tonkatsu was very good, nice broth and generous portions of meat. The tempura was not soggy and the bento boxes are good and filling. Good prices for a good amount of food.

The menu was large. Like in pretty damn big. We got some appetizers like soft shelled crabs, agedashi tofu, a few different types of sushi to try. I noticed they had tako-wasa, one of my favorite things to eat with beer, so we got that too. It wasn't bad. Actually none of the above items were bad.

After grazing on appetizers we were debating whether to eat ramen here or move elsewhere. Hubby searched the reviews via cell and said that people liked the ramen. This is when we decided to order the pork bone ramen with extra chashu.

When the bowl arrived, the steam indicated it was piping hot. I was excited. I took a sip of the broth, then another. I then moved the bowl over to hubby and asked him to taste the broth since he's pretty accepting of food -- much more than I.

He took a sip, then looked at me. Took another, then said ""it's watery"". My sentiments exactly. It was watery, flavorless and really subpar. But we didn't want to waste it, so I ate a few bites and my hubby bless his heart, ate the rest.

For a pork bone soup base, it failed miserably. There was no depth at all. Unlike some people, I thought the ramen at Ichiza was 100x better, unfortunately, Ichiza runs out of their broth really quickly so if you go later in the day they won't have any ramen left. I was so disappointed because I was craving ramen and didn't get to satiate that craving in the end. Even so, I'm glad I came to try it because now I can cross it off my list to try in Vegas and concentrate on going elsewhere next time.",nzsv-p1O8gCfP3XijfQrIw,5,3,2,LTNO-2vvYEiPcCyKLB9Bsw

I had a chance to revisit earlier this month and noted that the Uni and Ikura Bowl was over $20!  I definitely think that's a hunk of change to be charging for that.  Instead, I ordered the Spicy Tuna Rice Bowl.  As I looked behind the sushi bar, I noticed the oh-so familiar bottle of Sriracha sauce.  I quickly inquired to see if they used that hot sauce to make my tuna spicy, and they confirmed they did.  (I absolutely hate when spicy tuna becomes spicy with this sauce. Bleh!)  So, I quickly changed my order before they could even start.  

I chose the Salmon and Ikura Rice Bowl ($13-$14).  It came out nice with a heaping amount of ikura eggs on top and some nice pieces of raw salmon around.  But it wasn't until I stirred it a bit did I see all the cooked salmon in there too.  The dish was tasty, but I could really do without the cooked fish and more raw stuff please!

The BF enjoys their ramen selections and went for a fried chicken ramen bowl.  They separate the broth so you can dip your noodles and meat into it separately.

Overall, I changed their rating from a four to a three because the prices went up so much now and I guess I'm not so wowed anymore by them.

Granted our party was difficult since the first two arrived first and then the rest of 6 us arrived at a later time but it seems like they pretty much forgot about us.  The decor was so so, nothing really special.  They were moderately busy with a couple of parties of 6 and a few couples scattered around.  It looked like there was only one or two waiters available.  It took well into the meal to get waters for the rest of our party.

My friends ordered ahead for a few of us since we needed to get a move on so the food seems to have come relatively fast.  

* Miso ramen + beef donburi set: I didn't get to try the ramen (big unsmiley face) but the beef donburi was good!  The beef was tasty and they put enough sauce on the rice to make you want to finish every last grain in that bowl.
* Tempura + california roll + tonkatsu set: also came with a good portion of salad.  The tonkatsu was dry and tough and the tempura was pretty bland.  I put a ton of sauce on both to make up for it.
* Salmon + california roll + ....I don't remember (I was slightly hungover): Persons eating said the salmon was pretty good but the rest of it was unremarkable to say the least. 
* Takoyaki: not the best I've had.  The balls were smaller than I'm used to (laugh it up) and the octopus pieces were smaller as well.  I have missed takyoaki though so it was enough to get me past my cravings.

The sets were about $15 I believe and the ramen combos were about $10.  My other friends had the pork ramen (she loved!) and the spicy ramen (that looked like lava had been poured into it instead of broth).  

The food was so so, the service was lackluster.  Since we had to go, we left some money with the rest of our party and headed out.

Place is stuck in the middle of an empty strip mall and even when we parked right in front of the place, wouldn't have know it was even open.

Wife and kids were sick of eating hotel and fast food. Kids missed mom's cooking. We got to Kaigenro weekday mid afternoon and the place was empty. Might have turned around if the waitress didn't see us first. Sat down and checked out the menu. It was pretty extensive and made up of a lot of basic Japanese staple dishes. Wife and I got the miso ramen combo and kids got hayashi rice. Service was quick and the waitress even brought out special kids bowls/utensils. Ramen was just like you find it in Japan and the kids never said a word about their food, other than their plates being empty. The size of the dishes were more than enough and I even managed to help my wife finish hers.

There's a neat little market right when you walk in, and I suggest taking a look around. The Japanese have this miracle concoction that comes in a little tiny packet that is the closest thing to a cure for a hangover I've found.

When we saw the prices, we were a little worried. We were looking for cheap eats. But what do you expect from a Japanese restaurant?

Much to our surprise, the ramen bowls were gigantic and enough for two people with a normal appetite to share. Though I don't know why you would want to share this goodness. Honestly, this is some of the best ramen I've had other than in Japan.

I had the tonkatsu (pork bone stock) ramen. Of all the ramen, everyone liked mine the best. I tried my friend's mabo tofu ramen and the kimchi ramen. They are all so good in their own right. Another friend ordered the chanpon (seafood) ramen, but ended up adding a ton of soy sauce to it because he said it was too bland. I didn't get to try it. Sad face.

Some of us ordered non-ramen, and it seemed like the only dish that was good was this beef donburi thing. I can't remember what it was called. My friends also ordered sushi and a fried rice that they didn't seem to like much.

Yokohoma Kaigenro is a yummy semi-hole in the wall restaurant off the LV strip. Found it one hungover Sunday in Vegas after a weekend of debauchery and decided to check it out based on the good reviews on Yelp. Their food is super good and their service friendly and quick. Totally worth the 5 minute taxi ride off the strip. 

The spicy pork ramen was a total hangover cure! Good depth of flavor, just enough fat but not a thick layer of oil on top, chewy dense noodles, tender slices of flavorful pork and just enough spiciness! It was soo soo good.

Salmon Ikura Bowl was salmon sashimi chunks, cooked salmon pieces and ikura (fish eggs) over sushi rice. It was delicious! I would totally recommend mixing in the Spicy Cod Roe (order it as an appetizer for 3.50), which really brings together the salmon bowl. The spicy salty roe and the salty ikura were balanced by the mild salmon and simple but good sushi rice.  Best way to eat it is to mix it all together so that each bit has a little bit of all the flavors. 

Dragon Roll- pretty good, simple, though you can't go wrong with a dragon roll. 

Service was friendly and fast. i think this place is family owned.

I neglected to take notes, but remember seeing a number of dishes not found at your standard cookie cutter Japanese restaurant.

The Atmosphere is very plain. There's an eight stool sushi bar, and about fifteen four-person tables. The restaurant is kept clean; medium soft music plays in the background. When I went for lunch, the clientele was largely Japanese speaking.

Lunch, served on a lacquered tray, consisted of miso soup and an uni-ikura bowl. The miso was very good: full of crunchy scallion, some tofu and seaweed. I give it extra points for not being too salty.

The uni-ikura bowl was impressive. On top of a layer of rice was a generous amount of sea urchin, and the largest amount of salmon roe I've ever had at one time. The uni was firm and fresh. The ikura was also very fresh: bright, firm, bursting with briny flavor. I recommend this dish to everyone.

Based on a single lunch time visit, I was impressed. This seems like the kind of place to get good Japanese food that goes beyond the usual, at prices that won't leave you gasping.

5918830,2010-08-18,0,gGeuQKUBP7zAz2YTqpHHCw,"Came here again for ramen.  First time was awhile back with a roommate during the winter, and she looked it up on Yelp and Google and we drove here after reading the positive reviews.  I can't recall what I had (it was before my active Yelp days), but I do recall it was not the awesome or really good ramen experience I had hoped it would be.
Fast forward about 1.5 years.  Had tried several ramen places around Vegas, most recently Monta and had written a good review on it, and was suggested to come give Yokohama Kaigenro another try.  So I went yesterday with a Yelp friend for lunch.  I guess there is no difference on pricing for ramen for lunch or dinner at YK. And they do have more selections of ramen then most other ramen places I have tried here in Vegas.

For me to decide on the quality of the ramen, I always use Pork Flavor aka Tonkotsu Ramen for comparison.  HK's version comes in a large bowl, maybe serves more ramen than Monta (but probably not much more) and had more broth.  They serve more pork pieces, which are also thicker than Monta, but it was just okay to blah, I have had better in California. The broth was not as salty as Monta, which is a plus, but also lacks the full body Tonkotsu flavor I am used to and prefers elsewhere.  Overall, I thought it was just okay at best, and it was still not as good as other ramen places around Vegas, and no need to even compare it to my favorite ramen-yas in California.

Would I come back, I might if I am in the area, because although my Yelp friend didn't like the Spicy Pork ramen that she ordered as much, which was ramen covered with this thick Mabo Tofu without the tofu like topping, I think I might actually enjoy it. Personally I think that tofu-less Mabo Tofu sauce would be awesome on just rice.

Anyway. Service was okay. Our waitress was nice and refilled the water and tea as frequently as needed, even after we had already paid our bill and deciding where to go next for sweets.  She spoke Japanese, although she looks more Korean to me, so it is nice if you are Japanese and prefers to order it in Japanese and have a more authentic Japanese dining experience.  Food was just okay. Edible, but not very memorable nor exciting.  Location - corner of Harmon on Paradise, across from Hofbräuhaus (Bavarian restaurant that used to have a Certified Master Chef running the kitchen), in a strip mall plaza that has seen better days - there are hardly any tenants here now. So kudos for YK still hanging in there after years of operations.

So overall I think it is a 2.5 star restaurant, but will round it up to 3 stars.

P.S.  They also have a tiny convenience store near the entrence, selling Japanese snacks, sauces, etc.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,1,1,3,DbHCjSvXypaM7rQrwW3o3Q

I yelped sushi near my ""current location"" and saw that Yokohama Kaigenro had a four star review AND it was right across the street the Hard Rock where I was staying.  

I literally walked across the street to get to the restaurant.  The exterior was a bit rough, but when it comes to looks, you know the old adage.  Upon entering, I was greeted by a friendly hostess/waitress and seated immediately.  I asked for a big glass of water which was brought to my table right away.  I originally had the intent of eating sushi, but upon looking at the menu, I realized that a big bowl of udon with tempura was really what was going to hit the spot.  

After ordering, I took a look at the wares they were offering in the front.  Japanese crackers, candy and other assorted snacks were for sale along with a chilled cabinet filled with refrigerated imports.  I immediately spotted a can of cold black coffee, which I promptly ordered and slugged.  I haven't seen one of those since the vending machines I frequented in Japan.

My udon came steaming hot in a fantastic broth.  The tempura had three perfectly sized shrimp along with a variety of perfectly fried vegetables.  To my surprise, my meal came with two inari which tasted amazing.  Solid, solid meal all around for about $13.  

I wanted to come back to the restaurant later that night for sushi, but the idea was nixed by my fellow Vegas companions.  I 100% will make a second trip (possibly a third) the next time I stay at the Hard Rock Hotel.",F6dP-QmA4SUj0U3XLJtuKA,0,0,4,b91BwPU03WT-ZStkmQCxog
