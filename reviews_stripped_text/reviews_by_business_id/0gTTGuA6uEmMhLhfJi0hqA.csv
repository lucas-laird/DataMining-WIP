Ordered a couple of beers a piece, nice and cold with optional cold pint glass.  Limited selection, we had Peroni and Newcastle.  Food selections:  chicken lettuce wraps- on-point, my favorite item on the tapas menu;  kobe beef hummus- seems weird, and was a little, but tastey, and the flatbread they serve with it is good; lobster bisque- I did not try it but when asked how it was, described as ""lobster bisque.""  So, seems like ""so-so"" to me.

Overall, good experience.  Good service.  We were watching the chefs and prep in the kitchen and they were tediously measuring out EVERYTHING- to the ounce.  So, you're going to get consistency here.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,3,0,3,bd8X2e6Zouj5J95trjWusw

I have been to the location on Sahara and the location at Rainbow and 215 and have never had bad service before.

When we first walked in, no one greeted us. It was a Thursday afternoon. About 5 tables inside and no one was on the patio because it was windy. We weren't sure if we should seat ourselves so we stood waiting. I looked at a few servers who passed us by but no one said anything to us. Finally a server told us we seat ourselves. So we asked to wait for a booth they had, it just needed to be clear of cups and trash. The busser literally took 10 minutes to come out. He was very kind, but slow. By now, I was ready to walk out because I work in the service industry. My family member told us we should just wait and see if it gets better so I agreed. We sit and wait yet again. The server didn't come until about another 5 minutes later. She asked if we needed menus. We said yes. So she left, then came back a few minutes later and handed us our menus. The manager was on the phone the whole time while this was going on by the way and looked at us, but did nothing. Our server didn't warmly greet us at all, but said a few words. She just stared at us, waiting for us to order. So I ordered our drinks. She came back with drinks, said nothing. Then asked if we're ready by saying ""Ready?"" So we decided to order right away after waiting 30 minutes with nothing yet accomplished. The weird thing is that when other people came in after us, the other servers were warm and friendly and actually seated them to the booths. My food came out semi-warm but I ate it anyway because we were starved. Not to metion we ordered my niece her food off the kids menu and asked if we could have her milk after she ate because then she won't eat. The waitress said it doesn't come with a drink and I lifted up the kid's menu to show her. She just stared at us, so I said nevermind. It was really weird. I've ordered take-out a few weeks ago and the hostess treated me better than our server. I always look out for good service because I am a server myself. I would have told the manager at this location about our experience but he was nowhere to be found.

Was very disappointed. Place seemed very unorganized, staff-wise.",eeBbizRxLSTKTXOaMkfPaw,2,0,2,RaR-y-31glpZqQ2LxpcPAA

475819,2014-01-22,0,0gTTGuA6uEmMhLhfJi0hqA,"At first glance, Sammy's Woodfired Pizza looks like any other dining establishment in Las Vegas that's not located on The Strip. But don't let the name or the exterior fool you, this upscale pizza eatery offers an array of culinary delights that tantalize and provoke your taste buds to want more. 

I've eaten at Sammy's on several occasions and continue to go back to try various items on the menus that range from tapas to custom, hand-made pizzas to pastas, salads and to-die-for desserts.  This is definitely a good place to go with friends and split multiple dishes. For starters, try the Mini Duck Tacos, which are garnished with feta, fresh diced tomatoes shredded cabbage and a thick sauce flavored with cilantro. The sauce is pretty creamy, so if you're not a fan of rich things, you should probably shoot for the Pork Dumplings, which are meaty, but light with a thin ponzu chili dipping sauce. 

Another good starter are the Parmesan Crusted Artichokes, which are artichokes lightly dusted with Parmesan cheese to form a thin crust then sprinkled with goat cheese and accompanied by an herb dressing. For an entrée, I'd suggest splitting pizza and a salad with a friend. As far as pizza flavors go, Sammy's offers something to please everyone's palette.

For meat lovers the LaDou's Barbeque Chicken is quite delicious especially if you're a cilantro lover. The Goat Cheese pizza is great for those who are trying to lighten their fare. There's also the Artisan Thin Crust pizzas that includes the Yummy Honey Cheese, my absolute favorite, which is a very thin and flaky pastry with savory oregano melded with crumbled sheep's milk cheese and honey.

All woodfired pizzas can be made with gluten-free or whole wheat crust as well as nonfat mozzarella or vegan cheese for an extra cost. 

As far as salad's go, the Caesar is always a great go to and it's not drenched in dressing, which is a plus especially after all of the decadence you've already consumed. But the Original Chopped Chicken salad is also delicious with tart red wine vinaigrette.

If pizza's not your style, and you're looking for a healthier option get the Oak Roasted Chicken Breast, that comes with fingerling potatoes, asparagus and pine nuts - it's a clean, refreshing entrée that will fill your belly while keeping your waistline cinched. A not-so-healthy entrée option is the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine that has large chunks of bell peppers and red onions, all tossed in a cream sauce made of tequila and lime. 

If you're flying solo, simply pull up a stool at the bar, as the staff is more than appreciative and willing to assist you as well as strike up conversation. Plus, you get a great view of the chefs in the kitchen working the magic of your meal.

Sammy's also caters to large groups by combining tables although the patio is a great option in the spring or fall when the weather is perfect enough to enjoy a glass of wine in the sunshine. With a great selection of wines and a few beers, this pizza joint is anything but average and bring s a bit of class to the usual restaurant.",o4DTgtdKpi_qpoHw4NsP5Q,0,0,4,OWZUxogkoYbSni2HK2bzsQ

What I am in shock over is the lack of trained staff.  All sweet people but very slow.  They need a very experienced district manager or owner to provide a class on speed.  They often neglect the food that sits under heat lamps for a long time.  It doesn't seem to be an issue with the chefs but the lack of awareness and speed with wait staff. I have sat at the bar, table and to go orders.  I see a lot when at the bar.  I really hope they look into a class or better direction.

I had a craving for traditional Italian pizza. Since this place is just down the road, we decided to give it a try. My hubbie and I had the coconut shrimp skewers, which were deep fried beyond recognition and came with a side of citrus-flavored high fructose corn syrup. We then shared a pizza which had a small spoonful of sauce in the center of an oddly sweet flat bread type thing, which in no way resembled pizza base, and it came slathered in oil, ick!  

The service was average, if you consider inattentive to be average. The waiter seemed to be on another planet, and couldn't distinguish lunch from dinner.  Not recommended.",wTVl4owjHa278i-fxmYcCw,1,0,1,X9V8GTe-oQDtUCZG3bzqOw
780907,2015-02-19,0,0gTTGuA6uEmMhLhfJi0hqA,"I want to update my last review.  After the terrible experience at the Flamingo/215 location and writing this review, I also sent a complaint to Sammy's corporate.All i wanted from them was  to make sure that the message got to the employees so they wouldn't do that to any future customers. Here's how they got me back as a customer...
I got a quick email reply regarding my complaint (which I took to be just a form email sent to every complainant).  A couple days later I received a phone call from the GM of that location.  I missed his call & forgot to call back and the next week he called again.  For about 5 minutes he apologized and asked if we would give the store a chance to make it up to us.  So, I gave him my address and within about a week I received a gift certificate for $25.  Yesterday my husband and I went in again to the previously dreaded location, not identifying ourselves.  We figured even it was bad again, at least it wouldn't cost much due to the gift certificate.  But EVERYTHING was different!! We were immediately greeted at the door and seated quickly. Our server was very attentive.  The first thing she told us upon seating was that we were in Happy Hour and she explained about the 1/2 price tapas.  And I guess they have a new system where if you want water the server brings you glasses of ice and a carafe of water, which I loved because we were never thirsty.  The food was delicious as before, and the service was flawless.  I felt like they had coached the employees specifically on the issues I mentioned, after receiving my email complaint.  
At the end we asked to speak with the GM and I introduced myself.  He apologized for the previous bad experience AGAIN and explained how he truly appreciated the second chance and that they take feedback to heart and the staff had been coached on the poor service from before (as I had suspected).  
Anyway, long story short, I am now a true fan of Sammy's.  In this day and age it's really hard to find a restaurant that cares THIS much about earning back an unhappy customer, and I think that is almost more of a selling point for this place than the food itself!  If you've never been, please give this location a shot.  They have food for anybody's taste or dietary restrictions. =)",z30l6lrUl5htn6Br4Cmd4g,0,0,5,FVh9S_qWqfubZXheh79zgA

1115952,2010-12-08,0,0gTTGuA6uEmMhLhfJi0hqA,"Sammy's pizza is harmonious. What I mean, is that the prices are reasonably balanced with the flavors and quality of the food. For about $12 you can order a pizza that serves two people, with many fresh ingredients. I've also had the salads and appetizers here. 

The coconut shrimp skewers are a little too sweet for me. Since coconut has a lot of natural sugar, it is overkill to serve something coated in it with an even sweeter sauce. I think offering something spicy, maybe with Sriraucha in it would help. 

We usually vary our order, so I've tried just about everything on the menu. I prefer the plain Jane cheese pizza over all the others. This is concerning, since clearly Sammy's isn't specializing in just cheese pizza. 

If I'm feeling too lazy to cook I'll""ll carry out from Sammy's since its close, affordable, and not too greasy.

The service was subpar, to be honest. However, I'm not sure that was the fault of any of the employees. They were short staffed for the amount of people who were dining. Our waiter had at least 6 or 7 tables by himself and a couple of those tables were outside. It took almost 20 minutes to get our salad. 

We also noticed that tables were not cleaned and tips were not picked up. I would only suggest that management staffs the restaurant a little better to give their customers faster service and so that their staff doesn't seem so stressed out.

Ok, in all seriousness, my lunch was damn good today. I realize that my Yelp reviews are starting to sound like Kanye West hacked my account.

Popped in for lunch and had the pleasure of joining an ""Old School"" (kickball reference) with Arlene B. and Katie K....all recent Yelperazzis.

The good:

--Goat Cheese Pizza was perfect! The cheese was the right amount and didn't take over my palate.
--Edamame--Sprinkled with sesame seeds. Nice touch
--The crispy flatbread is delicious and has a nice little spicy kick to it. Ask for it when you get seated.
--The salads look amazing.
--The iced tea is bomb. For realsies.
--Although it was busy for the lunch rush, staff was very attentive.
--Solid menu. Lots of stuff for even the pickiest eater.

The bad:

--I wanted to brag about the pizza and thank Sammy's. I went to their Facebook page. And the wall was private. WTF! So much for taking customer opinions, feedback and such. FB is a good spot to do that. 
--Air conditioning. Although it was somewhat ok inside, I would've liked it to be a bit cooler. It's 110 outside. But then again, that's just me. And I'm not complaining....I'm just saying.

The ugly:

My fat belly. It was happy from my delicious and awesome lunch.

I'm coming back. Many times. And I'd be interested in eating my way through the whole menu.

The Happy Hour looks awesome too!!

We did enjoy the sliders, earning the 1 star. We watched as our server bussed a table, dropping glass on the floor. We were appalled that none of his coworkers came by to help, especially considering the hazard it posed.

The Skinny: came in for power lunch special  but the food was disappointing (2) service: our waitress was pretty good and made sure our water glasses were filled (4) value: in the end,  it is all about the food. There are better joints that serve $10 sit down lunch. (2).

We haven't been back at Sammy's for a while. I think since they eliminated the pomegranate fattouche salad off the menu,  I really haven't felt the urge to come back. 

But we saw an ad for the $10 power lunch which consists of 2 items off a lunch specials menu (soup,  salad,  pizza).  Intrigued we decided to give it a go. 

We selected the tomato basil soup,  arugula and fig salad, the 8 inch spicy Italian pizza and the pepperoni pizza. 

The tomato basil soup was pretty bad.  It was tasted pretty much like tomatoes from the can. Cannot recommend. 

The pizzas were not what we expected. Based on the descriptions,  the pepperoni pizza should have red peppers while the Italian sausage pizza should have oregano and caramelized onions. No such luck.  The pizzas we received were single topping pepperoni and sausage pizzas. In addition to the soggy crust,  the slices were dripping with grease. 

The arugula salad was okay except the figs.  The reconstituted dried figs were kinda weird and too sweet. I think cranberries would have worked way better. 

Our server was pretty good at making sure we had everything we needed. Interestingly enough we were served our pizzas before our soup/salad due to issues kitchen.  Nevertheless,  our food was hot and our glasses were always filled. 

Long story short,  I realized why we have not been back in a while.... Once one of our favorite menu items was gone,  we felt no rush to return. After the food we had here,  I can see why. 2 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,0,2,32qKO51ZTvJ22RHpCfPCsw

Service was inconsistent from beginning to end.

We arrived about 9pm and we were aware Sammy's closes at 9:30.  We stepped in and I counted 5 parties and 3 of which looked to be finishing up.  There was no host present as we entered.  We stood around expecting someone.  I made eye contact with some of the staff but no response.  Of the maybe 9 employees there, we were not attended to for 5 minutes until someone manager looking comes from the back to seat us.

We quickly order some drinks and soon after order an appetizer and the main entrees.  At no time were we given any warning that time would be of any concern.  The appetizer comes in a reasonable time.  We finished off the appetizer in about 10 minutes.  We sat around talking for another 10 minutes and wonder about our entrees (pizza and salmon dish).  At this time there are only 3 other parties in the shop.  One of which was employees eating their dinner.  We finally get an update from our server saying the entrees will be another 2 minutes.  We wait another 5 minutes and I notice finally the manager like guy ask about the order.  Probably because I kept staring at him eating his dinner.  We get another update from our server saying it will be 3 minutes.  The server finally says at this point that the oven was ""off"" and had to heat up .  At this point we had already considering leaving.  We hesitantly agreed.  We get the food finally 5 minutes later and as I said was fine.  

Come bill time I would have expected another apology for the delay or even a comped item/discount.  But got nada.

I am just a little frustrated about it since we could have gotten a heads up after we finished our appetizer but we were left there trying to guess for ourselves what was going on.  I understand it was near to closing time but we were given no warning.  We would have likely not ordered a pizza.  Which I don't understand why the oven would have been let to cool off since this is a woodfire pizza place and was not yet closed when we came in.  

What would you have done bill time?  Of course we considered to leave no tip but that is not right.  I left a little but not what I would have normally tipped if the service was ok.  Am I out of line?",DxvTniLnaKp7rWquZCXiGA,1,0,2,KVuh8xKQfkspl88KUOxm2Q

Good but not good enough considering how much we paid for something we had to eat with a spoon. I swear, the lobster Mac n cheese has hardly any lobster.

The good: whatever pita/ flatbread they serve with hummus is delicious and burrata pesto pizza meets expectations (I also liked the crust).

The not so good: judging by the amount of paprika on top of the hummus, the container broke while that were ""sprinkling"" it on top.... there was a lot! Also, it certainly is not worth $10 for pita and hummus. The BBQ pizza leaves a weird texture in your mouth, similar to how an after taste makes you feel. I would not order the BBQ pizza again.

Sammy's offers some great menu items that all look tempting both in description and on the plate.  We've yet to see a bad looking plate come from the kitchen and always see new items to try just by watching other people's orders come out.

So far, my wife and I have been here twice and have ordered a Pizza and a Salad which works out perfectly for 2 people.  With pizza in the name, we figured you can't go wrong with that order, but the salads here are just as good if not better!

For pizza, we've done the BBQ Chicken and the Thai Chicken Pizza (TCP).  I'll say that I find the BBQ to be a better tasting pizza.  There was a funny taste to the TCP that I just couldn't put my finger on.  It had spice, but it wasn't a traditional tasting TCP.   However, the BBQ Chicken was right on target.  With both pizzas, the one thing that is constant is great tasting crust.  Light, flavorful and a great compliment to the fresh ingredients.

As for the salad, we've tried the Chinese Chicken and the Thai Chicken.  Both of these hit the spot.  Unlike the pizza, the Thai Chicken Salad was perfect.  Great taste, traditional flavor and just all around good.  The Chinese Chicken was just as good.  Both of these were refreshing, filling and instant favorites.

Me and the sister spent 2 hours at Chuckie Cheese and wanted pizza but not the chuckie cheese pizza..or whatever it is they serve over there, haha. We were promptly seated, our waitress was very nice and saved us some money when we were contemplating ordering by telling us how large the portions are and that we could split the pizza and salad between the 4 of us (me, sister 2 kids)

We started out with a bread basket. It had some sourdough and some crispy cracker like wafers which had a spicy kick to them, yummy!!!   Muy Bueno!

We decided to keep it simple for the kids and get the pepperoni and the chopped chicken salad (sub. ranch dressing over the red wine vinaigrette)   the pizza was great, very crispy crust and the tomato sauce was yummyyyyyy. The pepperoni's were large and tasted fresh. The salad was honestly the star of the show - i love a salad that is chopped and has enough dressing to cover everything, no dry spots in here!!!!!!!

Earlier while ordering we told the waitress we were trying to save room for some frozen yogurt next door and she was nice enough to bring us out a free ""messy"" sundae.

I loved the menu!  Many options for gluten-free and veg.  They had just rolled out a new Mediterranean menu for the summer that day.  I wanted to try everything!  Nice wine selection with my favorite....Ste Michelle Riesling!  Hard to find here.

We arrived at Happy Hour (3-6).  All Tapas were half off and our wine was $2.00 off a glass.   We ordered the duck tacos and chicken satay.  Our waiter brought out a bread basket and served us sourdough and a flatbread (you have to request the bread we found out).  The sourdough was AMAZING!  I usually skip the bread but wow!  So soft and moist in the middle with a crispy crust.  The flatbread had a great flavor with garlic and caraway seeds. very good.  

Tapas:

Duck Tacos- FABULOUS!  The duck was cooked to perfection, the shell was so crispy and light.  The toppings w/sour cream and goat cheese were perfect with it.  My boyfriend has never tried duck before...now this is his favorite :)
Chicken Satay-  Very good, nice spice and amount of peanuts in sauce.

Meal:

Chinese Chicken Salad- Exactly how it's supposed to be made!  i haven't had one this good in many years.  So many ingredients in it, I can't even list them.  Nice and spicy too.

New York Style Pizza-  high quality pepperoni and salami, the sauce was my favorite.  Great flavor and tasted homemade.  The crust had a great taste but was a bit 'wilted'.  It might have been our toppings.  I will try another next time.

Aside from the great food which we really enjoyed....our waiter Steve was the absolute best !  He genuinely wanted us to have a great experience. He was warm, friendly and attentive.  And because it was our first time...brought us the Messy Sundae for free!  nice touch!

I immediately left and got there just as they were about to be removed from the oven.

During the payment time, Beto, the man at the counter, asked how In was going to enjoy the pizza at home--with a beer?  When I said no, I would be having iced tea, he went to the counter and got me a take out container of their passion fruit iced tea to try compliments of Sammy's.  Nice touch.

The pizzas were good.  There's nothing special about them as far as gourmet topping but I wasn't looking for that.

The hummus, babaganoush and garlic cheesy bread are HEAVY on the garlic.  I like it very much but it may not be for everyone!

WARNING: The Parmesan crusted artichokes are stuffed with goat cheese; this is not on the menu and serves a nasty surprise for those who do not like goat cheese!

The chicken meatballs come with a delightful side of spicy pickled cucumbers.  yum.  They are a winner.  The fried tofu comes with a tasy miso sauce.  Also very good.

I came here yesterday, 4/14/16 and picked up a salad for lunch. Kudos to Sammy's for providing gluten free and vegan options on their menu! And thanks to vegan Yelpers for the tip! I called in and ordered the vegan Red Quinoa salad sans tomatoes. You have a choice of the individual size ($8.75) or the large size ($13.50). I called in to order so I asked the girl on the phone the difference between the individual and large and she said the individual is 4 cups and the large is 8 cups. I decided on the large since it was double the size for less than double the price and I could just save my leftovers for later in the day. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I got to the restaurant in 10 minutes and it was ready. Thumbs up for the fast, friendly service!

The salad was yummy! I'm not a beet fan but the Citrus Chili Vinaigrette dressing was delicious and has a little heat to it which pairs well with the mild-flavored beets and the arugula which I always describe as the spicy green. Additionally, the salad had red onions, avocados, scallions, almonds, parsley, supposedly mint (though I did not taste any in my salad), and of course, red quinoa.

I've had one other salad here, the Original Chopped Chicken, a few months ago before my vegan adventure began. I thought it was good but not exceptional, which is why I haven't been dying to come back. However, my concern is the size of the salads. When I ordered the chopped salad, I ordered the individual size which I swear was similar in size to the large I received in the quinoa salad yesterday. I wish I had a picture of the chopped salad to compare the two.The quinoa salad was a big portion so I don't know what I was expecting, family sized maybe? It's possible I just received extra in the chopped salad. Maybe it's different when you dine in but the sizing should be consistent because I spent $13.50 instead of $8.75 and I was little bummed by this.

All in all, I'd say this place is a decent lunch bite and I'm very happy to see healthy, vegan options on the menu. I'm sure I'll be back for their Red Quinoa salad!",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,1,1,3,IL2Df1DtIXbmHLTZZF7VMw

First, the good. I enjoyed the lobster bisque. It had nice chunks of lobster in it, was served at a nice just-barely-too-hot temperature (i.e. room to cool down), and it was creamy and delicious.

That was really the only enjoyable part of the meal. We also ordered a garlic shrimp pizza and a balsamic chicken salad. I couldn't really taste much garlic in the pizza. Actually, the pizza overall was just blah. While it wasn't terrible, it certainly didn't match up with pizza I've had previously at other Sammy's. Perhaps the fact that I was at Grimaldi's just a few days ago didn't help things. Grimaldi's owns Sammy's any day of the week.

As for the chicken salad, it was a huge portion, but it just seemed like it was drenched in that vinaigrette. I couldn't eat much of it before I had to stop. Although we had a lot of salad left over, neither of us wanted to take any of it to go. Strangely enough, the server didn't even ask if we wanted it to go. (Not complaining!)

Speaking of the wait staff, our server was nice enough, but upon entering, it took a while before there was anyone to greet us. We weren't sure if we should just seat ourselves. That's just a minor thing, but when the overall dining experience is sub-par, things like that just stick out.

Walking into Sammy's, I hadn't eaten all day and was starving. Walking out, I was no longer hungry, but I wasn't satisfied either. It's a shame because I remember enjoying the food at the CMYE a few months ago.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,6,3,2,SDrpQ0EYjXy8LqnmxATwew

4807285,2013-06-01,1,0gTTGuA6uEmMhLhfJi0hqA,"I am torn on how to review this Sammy's... Why? Not because my dinner wasn't terrific. It was. Sammy's Pizza & Grill is consistently impressing my tummy and the service is always GREAT! I normally visit the Sahara location and I love it so my expectations are set high.
 
So WHY am I torn on how to review it? I had an extremely+friendly+terrific server that seemed a little over-eager to wait on my boyfriend and I. I feel bad saying that, because he really was such a good waiter. Why was he over-eager? When he was taking our drink order, he looked at my iphone and sawI had checked in on Yelp. 

It made me slightly uncomfortable that he looked at my phone; what if I had was doing something private that I wasn't happy to share with my waiter?? He then mentioned his name so I could Yelp about him... And commented on making sure he gave us the best of everything 3/4 times... Shouldn't everyone get the best of everything everyday?? 

FOOD: 5 Stars! I love that you can get all of the wraps with lettuce instead of bread for a healthier option. My boyfriend had the wheat bbq chicken pizza and it was WONDERFUL! Our appetizer of the Satay chicken skewers were also very tasty. 
CLEANLINESS: 5 Stars. The decor in this location is nicer and the tables don't feel overly smushed together despite it being smaller than the other location. 
SERVICE: 4ish Stars: John was a great waiter. He is very outgoing, he brought out fresh ice for our water refills and he definitely isn't against going the extra mile for the guests. BUT he removed my boyfriends fork, said he would bring him another one and never came back... Kinda annoying because he wanted to eat. Also, it really ticked me off that he looked at my cell phone. He made a big deal about Yelp users, which was thoughtful... But I personally like using Yelp because it allows users to review the food/service on an everyday basis... Not on your best behavior.
THEY GO THE EXTRA MILE HERE: Because John saw me check in on my phone, he brought us a HUGE free Ice Cream sundae. Very thoughtful, but my boyfriend couldn't eat it because of his Blood Sugar level, hopefully they fed it to someone so it didn't go to waste. 
PRICE: $35 + $6 Tip=$41 for our pizza, wrap and appetizer. Worth it to us because the food is great and the service is consistently good. It is a step above Applebees price wise, but totally worth it. If you like Firefly, you will love this place! 

I am giving this place 5 stars based on the food and their friendly staff... But honestly I would suggest that the wait staff not make a habit of reading customers' phones. If they are eager for Yelpers to check-in maybe they could offer a check-in deal here for a half priced app or something? I certainly wouldn't be against another chicken Satay :)",qRYwodYPMMkl7QKnpmc39Q,3,2,5,rqgQsHff5E-fw4giPClJRA

We decided to eat at Sammy's Woodfired Pizza since my step dad loves vegetarian pizza and anything vegetables.  We thought that only Asian restaurants were open but luckily they were.

Hosts greeted us with smiles and politeness.  Being Christmas Eve, you'd think they would be miserable working.  After we sat down, we ordered our drinks.  Bread and butter is served as requested since they were conserving - per the menu.  So, we ordered it anyway just because.  

As for dinner our order were as follows:
1.)  Vegetarian Pizza - Trilled eggplant, onions, zucchini, bell peppers, red onions, tomatoes, fontina, with roasted garlic sauce.  
This was surprisingly tasty and delicious.  I can't be more satisfied with how this turned out.  

2.)  Chilled Roast Vegetable Salad - Spinach, fresh mozzarella pearls, Edamame, artichoke, yellow tomato, red bell pepper, onion, basil, lemon, balsamic, extra virgin olive oil.
This was an awesome salad.  For all the vegetarians out there, I'd recommend ordering this as well as the Vegetarian Pizza.  I loved the combination of the vegetables with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  

3.)  Mini Kobe Beef Hamburgers - Kobe Beef with Chipotle aioli.
It was definitely delicious and the bf definitely felt full after the two out of three mini burgers were devoured.  His eyes were definitely bigger than his stomach and couldn't finish it.

We were completely stuffed we couldn't fit any dessert in our tummy.  Normally I don't like the pizza's this restaurant has to offer but I will make an exception to the Vegetarian menu.  :D",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,2,2,4,ztO5bpKNMMH0NeoP8nfyTg

Finally made it out to this place on a Wednesday night. We were seated promptly and there were only a handful of people in the restaurant.  The restaurant is filled with a whole bunch of 4 seater tables without wall separations and booths that line the walls so yes, I imagine you would overhear a lot of conversations if the place is packed. 

Both of us shared the lobster mac & cheese starter, Balsamic Grilled Chicken salad and LaDou's Barbecue Chicken pizza - total bill ~$35, decent priced dinner for 2 in my opinion.

- mac & cheese came in an oval dish the size of my hand (see pic) and was bomb-dig as mac & cheese should be. 
- salad was plentiful - pretty sure I'd be full if that was my meal. There was adequate chicken to salad ratio and the gorgonzola cheese provided to right kick.  
- bbq pizza was tasty, no complaints

Every dish we ate was so freaking delicious - the food did not disappoint!! We didn't try dessert but I can only imagine it is just as awesome.  The service was average; not poor, but not exceptional.

For starters, their mini duck tacos were outstanding!  Whoa, a small biteful that gives your mouth a bang with their feta cheese, tomatoes, cabbage and a creamy tomato-cilantro sauce!  THE KIDS ATE IT!  That's enough for me to say!  Wished I could have eaten more of it...

To give you an idea of what's on the menu for appetizers, there's hummus w/ground kobe beef, Mediterranean or coconut shrimp skewers, baba ghanoush, and Thai chicken satay to name a few.

My husband and I chose their Artisan thin crust pizzas.  His was the Dorothea and Oven Roasted Tomato, made with this aged goat cheese that was to die for!!!  AAHHH!  Delicious!  I had the Brie Cheese with Truffle Oil pizza with sauteed wild mushrooms.  It was tasty, although nothing compared to the Dorothea goat cheese!  Mmmm!  All I can say about mine was that I wished it had more mushrooms on it, and possibly, more of my husband's goat cheese on it!  Hah!  Their woodfired pizza also offer different crusts from whole wheat, to even gluten-free.  The rest of the menu hosts a variety for every diet needs, from vegan to dairy-free selections to the most newest and finer ingredients that outshine most comparable restaurants of this style.

The service was excellent!  Our server was so friendly and polite with us.  She had even offered to bring out their ""Messy Sundae"" for our 5-year old daughter - it was her birthday dinner here!  We didn't even mention it to our server, but it was kind of her to suggest it!  Of course, it was birthday discounted, so that made it much more nicer of our server!

Although this place looks bar-sy, it's hard to believe that soo many families dine here!  We love it!  This is definitely our new family restaurant!

We walked in around noon and could count all of the people in the restaurant on one hand and since the weather was awesome today ""mid 70's and a slight breeze"" we opted to sit outside and enjoy our lunch and the weather alike. The server sat us and was kind enough to let us know that if we decided to order pizza's it would be a little longer then normal because they just opened and the oven was not up to temp yet. That is totally understandable and i appreciate the warning. So we sat outside and decided on our order, closed the menus, finished our waters, and continued to sit.

We ordered a prosciutto asparagus pizza a kids BBQ Chicken pizza and I ordered a Grilled chicken breast and hummus sandwich. after another 15 to 20 minute wait we received our food. The sandwich I ordered was amazing and so were the other items we ordered but the lack of service and the constant empty drinks unfortunately were to much to overlook.

Our server was very kind and provided some helpful guidance in terms of which pizza to order. I must admit I am not too adventurous when it comes to my pizza. I prefer it basic with pepperoni, but I was in the mood to try something new. Not only do they offer pizza here but there are also some creative salads and pasta dishes as well.

We selected the Burrata/Pesto pizza(our servers favorite) the Brie cheese with truffle oil and the Sicilian. In addition, we ordered the chicken salad. The chicken salad was really tasty with a delicious vinaigrette dressing. The tomatoes were fresh and juicy and on this hot day overall the salad was refreshing. The pizza was interesting. I enjoyed the added taste from the pesto but didn't really care for the burrata. It didn't enhance the overall flavor of the pizza for me. The Sicilian was loaded with Italian sausage, bell peppers, onions, red peppers and it was yummy. The Brie cheese pizza with truffle oil was probably the least liked pizza of all. Not a whole lot of flavor here. Of course we had to leave room for the Messy Sundae which we all shared and it never fails to please.

Our server was excellent , super friendly but she was one of only 2 servers working the shift. She said ' management' let the other servers go home. I guess they're running things as lean as possible. I would question the wisdom of this policy. With slightly brisker service we would have ordered more drinks etc, multiply a few drinks by a few tables and you surely make more profit than you would save by sending home a couple of servers an hour early. The manager here is clearly not seeing the bigger picture. 

Anyway the food; We started with Kobe Skewers and Edamame , both excellent . Kids had quesadilla and noodles with grilled chicken. Both veery good indeed. I had chicken pizza on Artisan Crust , very light and tasty. I would recommend but I don't know how they charge $2 extra for the crust . There are many gluten free options on the menu which should suit the followers of Americas latest dietary ""trend"". 

Overall a good restaurant , not cheap but good food , ambiance , staff , convenient . Worth a look!",hRzmJCPmV1_ggM5jSxq2bA,0,0,4,wtSANZOifm3Cc_mZq6uERw

Though they have the same decor and the same fabulous fabric lights that I love, somehow there is a coldness to this location that I don't feel at the others.  The big advantage to this one is that it's right next door to my favorite froyo - Yogurtland.  

We ordered the same as always:  the Thai chicken salad with the dressing on the side, and a goat cheese pizza.  Considering that the restaurant was nearly empty, it took a very long time to get the food.  And when it finally arrived, the salad had the dressing on it.  That was okay with my husband, who dived right in, but not with me.  So I waited, and waited some more.  By the time the replacement came, my husband was nearly finished and was ready for his pizza.

Both salads seemed larger than we remembered; we always order the small.  Sure enough, when we got the bill, we were charged for a large salad.  What a dippy waitress - couldn't get anything right!

The manager was so nice and accommodating that I bumped it back up to four stars.  And the pizza was delicious!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,0,4,Aw7ZmkPi585PoGWqqLfbMA

They put together a combination of fresh ingredients with super tasty homemade dressings , my favorite is the Spicy Asian. Lia the manager who is super spectacular, friendly and professional. She's taken my ridiculously difficult order the last two times I came in with at least 6 different mods and got it perfect both times. Thanks again Lia I'm coming back soon!",1ns7EMcD1ipGi2F3ldgSOA,2,0,5,0GXHRNI60ej3D2b2P3lBXQ
5983729,2013-02-23,0,0gTTGuA6uEmMhLhfJi0hqA,"There are two things I crave whenever I go to Sammy's: the arugula & pear pizza and the salted caramel pudding.  I enjoy date nights here and the two of us usually share those two items and are perfectly content for the evening.  They are sooooo delicious and just perfectly satisfying.

This location has one large room with a small bar, tables, and booths.  The restaurant is dimly light and you can feel a draft throughout the restaurant whenever the door opens since it's just one large room.  When you walk in, there is no ""Please wait to be seated"" sign and there's usually no host/hostess, so we end up waiting around a bit awkwardly until someone notices us and leads us to a table.  Coincidently, we've ended up at the exact same time the last 3 times we were here.

Service has usually been prompt whenever we come here for dinner (around 6-8pm).  Unfortunately, all the tables and booths are pretty close together, so you end up overhearing a lot of conversations, even if you're not trying to. 

Foodwise, I feel like the menu offers a delicious and appealing variety.  As previously stated, the arugula & pear pizza is absolutely delicious, as is the salted caramel pudding.  If you only order two things, make it those!

I gave it 4 stars because of the environment.  Each time we've come here, we've had odd neighbors and overhead many conversations we didn't need to and ended up people watching since most our neighbors were odd people.  I would just try asking for a more private table, if that's possible in a large open room.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,0,0,4,5uq_kHlH4VCEe8dzjg_3mw
