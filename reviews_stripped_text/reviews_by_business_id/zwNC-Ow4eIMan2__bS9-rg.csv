The meat was so tender and tasty, the pico de gallo and beans were fresh and flavorful. Today was their 6 month mark so tonight I went back with the kids for $1 tacos. We had chorizo, carnitas, and asada. All were very good but our favorite was the chorizo. Corn on the cob with mayo, cheese and chile is the only way to it and for $2 each we had two. Out of all the Mexican places we've ate at around town this one has the best salsa bar. There were at least 7 to choose from and there were grilled peppers and onions both hot and cold. Limes and carrots are pretty much standard but cucumbers, whole and cut radishes were a bonus. Love this place and will be back for more soon.",sNqnKBO0r7VlwOr9A-vdaQ,0,0,5,6EU1IizrXUd6XoRtGtPF6A

They offer authentic Mexican ""street"" food that's delicious and one of the best salsa bars in Vegas. I highly recommend the al pastor tacos, the vampiros, and the horchata!

Unfortunately they're making the common mistake of raising their prices too quickly while also seemingly reducing their portion sizes. That may boost profits temporarily but it will backfire in the end, especially among regular customers. There are way too many other good Mexican places in the valley, and if I'm going to spend $45+ on lunch for two it probably won't be at Taco y Taco.

Also, their ordering system is overly complicated and some of their employees are easily confused. Be sure to double-check your bill as I've had ""mystery charges"" show up on my bill twice.",H4Btu-Vx5Crk_d5f3vkN8w,0,0,3,EAkAOnQZAFGVB3fvZuecjw

I spent bank on nice restaurants in Vegas and hit Taco y Taco on the way out of town, entirely by accident. OMG! Their food is off the charts, delicious, excellent, just can't say enough good. I am from Houston who boasts a strong Latino population and my wife is Latina. But WOW....seriously....Taco y Taco makes every other cook or chef that makes this cuisine look like they don't know what they're doing. I came to the conclusion, after eating, that their ordering and menu system is designed for regulars because a place that great likely never sees newcomers, just a stream of loyal regulars. Makes consider moving to Vegas.

Folks, their prices are good, their service is good, and if  you ask for help from the cashier about their ordering process then you're in for a treat. The best of the best and by quite a bit.",O-rs858t22cO2XHMgz4_XQ,1,0,5,Bp5hNrhTA4uE7alaQpO7yg

206905,2015-11-13,0,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"When my husband I got married we celebrated with a small party at our home, which was catered by Taco y Taco. We placed the order a few weeks in advance, paid for it, and received a confirmation email from them. The food was to be delivered at 5:00 (which is also the time the party started, since I didn't want to serve my guests cold food). At 5:00 my husband calls just to make sure they were on their way or close to it. When he calls, they tell him that they forgot the order all together and that it would be a little late. There was no apology or effort to make up for the fact that we had a house full of guests waiting for food which they forgot to make. We had no choice but to wait for them as the food had already been paid for and it was too late for alternative arrangements. They managed to get the food to us around 5:45, and it all tasted just fine. In their rush to get the order filled, they didn't bring the right amount of tortillas and they left out a salsa. The day after the party I called to speak with someone about what had happened. I felt like more of an effort should have been made to apologize and make up for their mistake. They offered us 1 free meal. This requires us to visit their establishment and to pay for a second meal. In my opinion this did not make up for the fact that they completely forgot about our order. We asked to speak to the manager and they refused. We asked to speak to the owner, and the woman I spoke to said the owner wouldn't be in for a few days and that he would say the same thing anyway. I continued to call over the next few days to try to get a hold of a manager or owner. They continued to give me the run around. They were rude and unprofessional. I have waited a few weeks to write this review to give them an opportunity to make it right, but I'm tired of calling them. It's unfortunate that they don't care about customer service. We used to eat there all the time, but will no longer be visiting their establishment, along with all of the guests at are party who witnessed firsthand their unprofessionalism.

231044,2013-08-13,0,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"Ughh why are all the amazing taco places so far from my house? Why must I live on the West side???

This place is further from my place than even Tacos el Gordo, but it's more spacious and less crowded - though that doesn't mean the food sucks. No my dear children - the meat is wonderful. You know how some Mexican taco joints--actually, ALMOST ALL OF THEM-- use cilantro and onion (salsa sometimes too) to mask the flavor of an otherwise unremarkably cooked meat by piling that stuff on? And that when they do that, you're basically eating a cilantro and onion taco with meat filler? Not here. I mean, yes, they have those toppings but for once, you can actually taste tender rich meat. 

I'm always looking for a place that has great lengua. I'm not sure how lots of places seem to fuck it up, but they do - barely cooked, tough, absolutely lacking flavor, barely any meatiness, or all of the above. Tacos el Gordo has amazing lengua, and so does this place. Their suadero and al pastor is also top notch. And don't worry vegetarians, they got you covered - finally a place that serves soyrizo!! My boyfriend is a (cheating) vegan and loves their soyrizo. 

Their salsa bar is a welcome sight for so many of us who are rather tired of choosing between just roja vs verde. It's a salsa lover's dream. Their limes are also good quality - again, sometimes taco places just throw out crappy limes out there to sit on ice all day, or barely even any at all. Haven't tried their jamaica drink yet but their horchata is well-spiced and not watered down.

I'd also urge any future visitors to this place to READ THE SIGNS ON THE TRASH BINS. There's two that specifically state they're not for garbage but for glass bottles, and I've seen people dump their trash in there anyway. 

It might be a good thing this place is so far or else I'd be blowing my money here every few days if I could.",dAVGTSsykWzKZHTp3yU_xA,0,0,5,no02gpGOURQ-daeRDGWXiw

Since I'm trying to find a good burrito that reminds me of what I've had in LA for years, I'm trying many locations. I went here for a simple asada burrito.

While it was good, it was also pretty generic. It reminded me of what I was able to get inside a Chipotle but for more expensive. I paid almost $9 for a small burrito and all the toppings & taste were the same. This is not bad but for what you pay, you expect something to knock you out of the park. That did not happen here.

I'm sure other food might taste better but my review is based only on the one burrito I had. It was very clean inside and had a somewhat easy way to place an order.",OjSxPkFaBuuFvZrRd2b31Q,0,0,3,dmFkc_pFkotkEK181RjefA

:::::Soy chorizo burritos in Las Vegas:::::

Ok, so maybe you don't find this news as exciting as I do but you cannot believe the excitement I have for Taco Taco and their love of vegetarians like me.

Until recently, trying to find veg-friendly, authentic, good Mexican food in this town was like going on a quest to find the Fountain of Youth.  It just didn't exist.  Sure, there were places that list ""vegetarian"" items on their menus, only to tell you that it's full of lard and chicken broth.  Then there are the tex-mex chain restaurants that are veg-friendly but about as authentic as this Italian-Hungarian girl making a burrito.  Taco Taco is The Fountain of Youth.

You have your choice of burritos, tacos, bowls, and salads.  Soy chorizo is available, but for more health-conscious vegetarians you can just stick with beans and veggies.  Speaking of beans, they aren't cooked in lard or pork!  Woot!

The burritos are large and can be stuffed with tons of ingredients.  The tacos have house-made tortillas that are cooked up the second you order them.  Now here comes a dilemma: do you get the burrito that fits tons of extras like rice and beans or do you go for the tacos with their delicious tortillas?  Life can be so cruel.

They also have some special items like soy chorizo tacos that have been grilled (crunchy like a taquito) and topped with spicy salsa and cheese.  Or there are breakfast burritos with potatoes.  Then there's the horchata and Jarritos among the many beverage options.  And did I mention they offer a salsa bar with radishes, pickled veggies, beans, and eight types of salsa??  

Don't you worry, meat-eaters, there are plenty of options for you and I'm sure they are just as good as my soy chorizo.

Just a heads-up, if you follow them on social media you can stay up to date with specials they will throw from time to time, like 2-for-1 tacos on a random Saturday afternoon or a free corn for checking in.

The owners and all the employees are super friendly and helpful.  Despite being on the opposite side of town, I've managed to make the trip out here far too many times.  Rumor has it they are looking for a second location which can be bad news for me if it's near my all my downtown drinking establishments.  Expect me to be 50 pounds heavier if that's the case.

Check this place out! And if you're vegetarian, make sure to tell them thanks for thinking about us!",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,21,17,5,HrZFi0J2Qeczigc_mWwIwg
351174,2017-06-12,0,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"So, um...WOW! Okay, they have a limited amount of vegan options, but there is a lot of ways you can order one thing. The gran taco, for example, can have different things on it. I had two gran tacos with soyrizo, black beans, onion, cilantro, pico de gallo and guacamole. 

Listen! This sh*t is finger-licking good. Eat with your hands! They have a little sauce bar by the self-serve fountain drinks - go get you some lime slices and some of them sautéed jalapeños! 

My mouth is watering as I type this. I gave this place four stars only because they don't have many options for vegans, but the options they do have are BOMB AF! 

Anyway, the vegan menu at the top over hanging the shorter end of they bar. Just ask where the vegan menu is just in case they change the place around :) they are nice there, and YES they speak both Spanish and English.

The Good:
Friendly staff, very clean and fast service. I had a carne asada burrito and decided to try the al pastor tacos. It is the best al pastor I've had so far here in Vegas. I love Pepe's Tacos and Los Tacos Companita which have excellent al pastor. Taco Y Taco's al pastor blows them out of the water! The salsa bar is clean and a great variety of salsas. The tables were clean and the staff is constantly cleaning up after messy people that leave there trays on the table. Unlike Roberto's or Pepe's where its usually messy and the tables are filthy and the salsa bars are usually disgusting! I was very impressed how well they keep the dinning area. Taco Y Taco has fresh ingredigents and ordering at the windows is easy. Everything is made in front of you and the protions are good sized. 


The Bad:
I would give it 5 stars but for a total experience they lose 2 stars for the fact that they have a huge swap cooler in the dining area. Its loud and if you're not sitting where the air is blowing on you it's very hot inside. I hate sweating while I'm trying to eat. Next time I'll get it to go and eat in the car with the AC on.

Homeless and shady people hanging around the doors begging for money and cigarettes. I really hate this. The manager needs to run these shady folks away, call Metro or whatever get rid of them. My biggest peeve of any place I go is vagrants begging. 

Overall, great food, fast and friendly service. The food is 5 stars, the experience and no AC would put my total experience at 3.5- 4 stars.",9uF65w3eet38A7VKQ9xwUw,1,0,3,GNMIMGIt5GQB5U4UhUQW3A

I showed up around 8p with my friend Adam M. to check this place out after having a sampling of Taco Taco at the Yelp 89XXXhibition Block Party last month. I went in already knowing what I wanted to get - one taco each of asada, lengua, cabeza, and al pastor (hey now, don't judge - they are TINY tacos!). Seeing that asada requests were in one station, lengua and cabeza in the next, and al pastor in the last, I started by waiting in the first line for asada. A senora swooped in next to me, but I figured she was getting items from the other stations, so I didn't think too much of it. Then she started to talk - ohhh boy. 

""QUIERO TRES TACOS DE LENGUA, CUATRO DE CABEZA, TRES DE ASADA, CUATRO DE AL PASTOR - NO, SABES QUE? CUATRO DE ASADA. Y QUE DIJE, TRES DE LENGUA? NECESITO SEIS."" Okay, for those of you who are asking yourselves, WTF is going on, essentially she was ordering for the entire Chivas soccer team as well as half of the Latin Grammy Awards production staff, except for some reason I only saw 4 people at her table, herself included. But what the heck! I'M waiting for asada, why is there no respect for the station and its signage!? 

So ordering is a little hectic. But once you can get beyond that, the service is super friendly, and the food is fantastic!  The al pastor is decorated with pineapple bits on top of the hefty chunks of pork, while the asada, lengua, and cabeza tacos are all very well seasoned, and when ordered ""con todo,"" (""with everything"") there is onion, cilantro, and salsas sprinkled on to enhance - not overpower - the meats. All of the tacos have very generous helpings of meats that, after being well salsa-ed, sit on the strongest little corn tortillas I have ever seen. Speaking of salsas, they have an awesome salsa bar as well - everything ranging from mild to habanero HOT, with chunky and smooth options too. 

They offer a free corn on the cob with any type of social media check-in (e.g. Facebook, Four Square, etc.) but they were out the night I went :( But they did offer me a free taco instead. I'm not an idiot to say no to a free taco, so OK! I'd definitely recommend bringing cash - it seems like their credit card machine is touch and go, so save yourself the hassle of having to go out to the Bank of America just to get more dinero.",v6oGFvXjuJ5DMT3pUqMXnw,5,5,4,TALey20qYqQtFNfax3WnAg

ORGANIZATION: The best thing about Taco Taco is the organization and service. Unlike so many taco spots in town where you may wait around in confusing ""lines"" shouting out jumbled orders, there are large signs directing hungry customers.You simply look up and find the item you want to order and head to that (well marked) line. Easy.

SERVICE: Better even than the signage is the service. Every employee is helpful and warm. I've been back a few times and each time the employees have greeted me with a smile and a warm disposition. It's funny how a smile goes a long a way. From the folks making the tacos to the cashiers, there is a professionalism about this place that I enjoy and respect. You don't have to break into side conversations or endure any annoyance from put upon employees here. Someone has done some training here; the attention to service gives this place an advantage over many others in town.

FOOD: The food is solid. The taco meat is well seasoned.  I had some minor quibbles with texture and depth of flavor, but the food offerings that I tried (tacos and vampiros) were good.

Good vegetarian options!

The soy chorizo is tasty if you're looking for a meat substitute. 

Personally, I think that the burrito with napoles is a more interesting choice. They Aren't out of a jar, like so many places. It's a slightly lighter and less oily option.

Of course, I then pack on the guacamole and cheese - but you could make it more healthy if you like.

At the condiments bar, I grab some pickled jalapeños,  limes, and a couple of different salsas.  

A side of cerveza, and I'm a happy guy.

Anyway... making our orders vegan we got a bowl and a burrito... and added avo. I got mine On top of my bowl and my someone got hers ""on the side"" as she didn't want it inside her burrito. Now, this very easy request to leave one ingredient off the veggie burrito on the side... this jacked the price up to 2.75 or something completely out of line. My added portion of avo however was only like 1.35 or something... still overpriced. We were in a rush and scarfed down the food, it was good. Like a better quality chipotle if you will. I digress... I just spent how much on some mashed avo!? So apparently because you've inconvenienced them to put the avo on the side it's triple the price. Or no no wait... it's cause the styrofoam foam waste product you put the avo in cost that much? You seriously could have slapped that spoon of avo on the side of the plate NEXT to the burrito and called it good. Nope. None of the reasons. It's a, ""just cause"" scenario and that will be the answer, and it will be given with a smile. I don't know if I would go again simply cause it's rice and beans and Panchos is across the street. So in short... food isn't that special, I could make it.. and therefore I'm not impressed.  But it's worth a try and it might just be the best thing at that moment. Just don't get anything on the side as there seems to be a hefty tax... which would have at least been their tip. Oh well.

I had the Al Pastor nachos with an Elote.
The meat was tender, toppings (guacamole, sour cream, pinto beans, cheese) were fresh and homemade, and the nachos were crisp!
Meat to toppings to chips ratio was good!

I know it's just corn but their Elote was sooooo good !!! I don't know how such a simple thing can pack so much flavor!!

The Go Tos - Al Pastor - rotating on a spit..well marinated. Every visit so far the slices I got have always been juicy and meat was never tough.
 
Lengua - My personal favorite! Meat is so tender and seasoned right!

Elote/Corn - Mexican street style is THE way to go! They roll it in creamy buttery mayo and sprinkle it with seasonings. So good!
 
Salsa Bar - the creamy looking green sauce is my favorite and apparently pretty popular because it's the one that always needs to be refilled. It's a mild salsa. (I cant handle too much heat)
 
All the meats sizzling on their grill, I was told by their employees come straight from the meat market Los Compadres, because the owners (Taco y Taco's) dad own that grocery store.
 
The Drill - Self Serve for dining or to go orders -  Walk up to each of the designated stations and they'll take and custom make your order, pay and order your drinks with the cashier at the end.  Salsa bar located in the dining room area.

Then it gets confusing: first you must magically know that it's a segment of stations that you stop and order from and not just one counter. So if you come in from the entrance overlooking pecos, you will be in the Section that servers the fish, and shrimp tacos, burritos, and Al Pastor Fries only. 

Second: unless you one just one thing, your food will get cold. You then have to go down the line with your fries getting cold, as you wait to order your next round of carnitas tacos or carne Asada tacos, and in the end you get the Al Pastor area, plus the line for drinks, cashier. 

Third: being different sometimes only works when it make sense: I know this is a popular way to have tacos in different places but I don't think it holds well here and makes the ordering process slow, clumsy and slow. 

Our first food order was literally cold by the time we got down the line to the Pastor section since we had a pileup on the carnitas Section, that comment is for a freeway not a taco shop!

There was a strong smell of meat inside which at first made me a little queasy, but I asked the cashier where I go to order vegan options and she told me line 4. So I went over there and told the lady I'm vegan and asked her for some suggestions. I got one cactus taco and one mushroom taco. The lady making my tacos told me she was vegan, too, &  we talked about that a little bit while she made my tacos. 
I got a tamarind drink as well, my total bill was about seven dollars. Not bad at all for two tacos and a drink. 
I sat down at a table and ate my food. Both tacos were delicious! But I think I like the mushroom one a little bit better. 
Also, the guacamole here is delicious.

Came here on rec of a fellow Yelper (and an Elite at that) and she was 100% right- this place is like crack! You're greeted when you open the door by a line of cooks preparing their own fresh tortillas, and the sizzle of flat top grills charring veggies and meats for your taco, burrito or nachos. Their menu is small- doing a few things but doing them all right- tacos,  burritos, nachos, bowls and Mexican corn. However,  their diverse selection of meats and salsas is what makes this place amazing. 

I ordered the good old stand by- gran chicken taco- and picked up a real Mexican coke- yum! The fresh salsa bar had 6 types of salsas plus the standard carrots, cucumbers and green onions. I spied another customer's nachos in line to pay and decided instantly what I will order on my return visit. This place is what real taco lovers want in authentic tacos and the like- as opposed to the Americanized versions with drive thrus...

We decided to share an al pastor burrito, and it had a pretty generous amount of meat. It came with a choice of type of rice and type of beans.

Salsa bar was in the seating area and had lots of choices. They even put out the two types of beans there so I guess you could really fill up on beans if you wanted to. And there were several kinds of onions too, grilled, raw, pickled, etc.

I don't know about you, but when I go to order a burrito I know it's not great for me. I just want to indulge in the moment of my deliciousness and feel bad about it after.

Owned by the same people as Tacos El Gordo with a fraction of the crowds. 
Similar premise, though the lay out is a bit different. 
Grab a tray and head to the station that has your preferred fillings, be it cabeza, tripa, lenqua, barbacoa, etc. Tell the guy behind the counter how many of what you want (1 carnitas y 1 lengua taco por ejemplo), he'll chop it and plate it. Take your goods to the register, grab a drink, and then prepare to load up on salsas!

Seriously. Their salsa bar is STACKED! Dayumn guuurl. 
So much win.
The roasted jalapeños are especially awesome. 

Why not a 5-star rating? My carnitas were just ai'ight. Carnitas are my holy grail of porcine taco/burrito filling and they need to strike the right balance between crispy on the outside and juicy tender insides...these carnitas were a bit on the waterlogged side when I tried them.

When you first walk in you are at a cafeteria style counter where they make your food and put it on a tray for you to bring to the register. You have to go to different spots at the counter to order different things. This is probably my least favorite set-up for ordering in any restaurant I have been to, tacos or otherwise. Having never been there myself, if I hadn't had a regular customer of theirs with me, I could see myself being very confused. 

After you get past the counter, the atmosphere is decent with large open windows and ample seating. Their horchata is to die for; I will give them that! It was probably the best I have tasted anywhere. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, a gran taco, and Mexican street style corn. For nearly seven dollars I expected the quesadilla to come loaded, but it only had meat and cheese. The taco was good, and corn was bomb.com. This is just a preference thing, but the tortillas were not greasy at all, and I want greasy tortilla when I eat Mexican deliciousness. 

My final verdict is that if I were on this side of town already, I would stop by for a horchata and Mexican street corn snack but I wouldn't drive down here to eat like some people I know. My boyfriend says this place has the best lengua in town, and he will make a special trip for it. So I am sure I'll be back.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,3,2,3,r1nWcPUjFfnaRkWkDhgtnQ

I am MAD. haha.  So I knew there were 2 new taco spots in the area and I wanted to try both of them. 

When I first pulled up I thought, oh cool a nice little corner shop.  After I parked and walked over to the corner shop I saw the other half of the business and thought, YES! It has a big dining area and multiple stations but when I came in on a Thursday night there was no customers except me and another customer it might be a sign. Anyways I just tried them because it looked nice enough and I was already here. As with every business I first venture to I must explore the menu before ordering, trying to remember things I can include in the review, I must've looked a little curious because one of the girl workers, I think she was a hostess, approached me and we started having a friendly conversation.  I don't remember what we talked about but it eventually ended up with me getting a plate of meat samples, SCORE, and ordering some lengua tacos, I'm sure I must have said ""How's the tongue?"" and ""I would like some tongue"" in our conversation, not ""I want some beef tongue tacos.""

I went with two tacos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-taco-mexican-eatery-las-vegas?select=YjOw4JLUEZ36X9O5BYS6hw#G6-xTt9g3-Q3DAQ_84_c7w  The al pastor and lengua tacos, both were delicious. The al pastor meat was layers upon layers of awesome tasting pork meat cooking in it's own juice with other spices on a spit.  Request for the meat in the middle or lower section of the spit, a lot more juicier and not as dried up as the top.  The top section is still good too it's crispy and pineapple tasting.  Once in the tortilla it was topped with onion, cilantro, pieces of pineapple, and a green sauce.  The lengua meat was tender and topped with onion, cilantro, and a green salsa.  

I'm a sauce guy and I love that there's various sauces and complimentary ingredients you can add to even enhance my food. Hook it up with some of that habanero sauce please. Their condiments bar have everything from grilled, or was it fried, green onions and peppers, various sauces/salsas, limes, radish, and carrots. I might be forgetting a few other items. This might be my favorite place because they variety on their menu.  I mean you can select from tacos, burritos, bowls, nachos, fries, etc.  There's like 12 different meats you can put.  If you're vegetarian, they have something for you.  I wonder if they sell alcohol, if they do I'M NEVER GONNA LEAVE. I'd hang out here cause they also have a TV and those various Vegas Weekly and Seven magazines, which I always pick up and look through.

The customer service here was awesome.  Very friendly and their ordering system is easy to follow.  You're not going to get overwhelmed here or seem hurried.  They have a bell hanging on the wall that I think you're suppose to ring if you liked it, GO crazy and ring the damn bell if you like it.

They're located in the North East corner of Pecos and Tropicana, where there's a Bank of America.  It shares the same building as BOA but on the North, opposite end, of the building.  There's a few nice shops between BOA and TT, just make up an excuse that you have to stop at the bank then come here before or after. Also at night the area is well light outside and it's not in a bad area.  They have a website that you can order from, nice flyers, and a nice interior so it seems like some money has been put into the business.

Oh yea it's just a bus ride out from UNLV or if your in the Tropicana or Pecos route.

And they now serve beer!!!

I Thought the days of enjoying taco shops with my hubby were over, but this place brought me back to taco heaven. On our trips to Vegas my fiancé loves visiting tacos el Gordo, but they aren't veggie friendly so I decided to do some Yelp research on taco shops in the Vegas area and came accross this one. As soon as I seen that they offered vegetarian options and the regular meat tacos both looked bomb I knew I had to try it. Yea the ordering process is a little confusing but we got lucky because nobody else was in line so we just walked right up and the cooks were super helpful, and really funny- cracking jokes with us while we were ordering. My fiancé ordered the lengua, pastor, asada and loved them all. He said they were comparable or even better than that other place I mentioned. I ordered 3 of the soyrizo tacos and they were AMAZING. They don't skimp on the ""meat"" and they were topped with Guac, it really doesn't get any better than that for a vegetarian. They filled me up for sure. Their salsa bar is also ON POINT, I got the creamy green looking one and poured it all over my tacos and they tasted even better. As far as cleanliness of the place, it looked fine to me. I was enjoying my tacos so much everything else didn't even matter to me. As far as the lady at the register, she was fine, I didn't get any bad vibes from her. This is definitely my go-to for tacos whenever I come back to Vegas. Not too far from the strip and just all around worth it. The veggie lover and the meat eater were both 100% satisfied.

But the second time (which was on the same week) just failed. The lady at the burrito area was talking crap in spanish calling us stupid and mentally slow. Now this is all due to a warmed up tortilla that she had to throw away. We ordered two burritos, when she was done making the first i politely asked to change the order to carne asada fries. Thats when she started talking crap and didn't realize i understood her. So everyone was laughing at us and then i ordered two tacos, one seso and one cabeza.

We had the large Lengua Taco (the tongue was cooked perfectly, BUT it was bland, and it came with beans and equally bland guacamole so the whole thing was bland), the Nachos with Chorizo (this was good, BUT the guacamole was bland and the nachos itself were fried/very greasy) and finally, the Al Pastor Vampiros (this was VERY good but the meat was a little dry. Still, this was almost perfect, try it with another meat).  I regret not ordering the corn!  We were too full by the time I remembered. Sniff.  Will we go back?  Maybe for the corn and vampiros.

2797456,2013-11-01,9,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"Ok , I had to make a second trip here before I decided to do this review because the first time around I had a Carne Asada bowl. Since they are aptly named Taco Y Taco, this time around I made sure to try their tacos.

So this second time around, me and the wifey decided to try different stuff aside from tacos.  We ordered  2 tacos. 1 Al Pastor and 1 Carnitas. We also got  a Carne Asada Quesadilla and a couple of Elotes.

The Al Pastor Taco was ok. Flavorwise, I have had better. The plus was that they had a little more meat than others. The Carnitas Taco was even better than the pastor. The meat was tender and had good flavor to it. Both tacos were ok. I wasn't really blown away by it. What stood out for me about them was the price. It was 3.50 for just 1 taco while most places sell it for only 2 bucks a pop. I guess that's why they're called Taco Y Taco because it's almost twice as much as other places? :P

The Carne Asada Quesadilla was really good! Besides the good meat and cheese, they put a little bit of guacamole and pico de gallo in there. I asked for sour cream on the side for no extra charge. Now this was worthy of the 5 dollar pricetag they had for it. 

Last but not least, the 2 Elotes we got were pretty good. For 2.25 each, you can get it normal or ""Street Style"" meaning they throw butter and spices on it. If you have ever seen Nacho Libre, those very same Elotes you see in that movie are what you can get here.

Service is decent. You order what you want, grab a tray, and slide on down the counter where they put the finished product on your tray. Since they have employees at different stations, you get your food faster because they can concentrate on those things they are assigned to make.

The place itself is very spacious and can accommodate large groups at a time. Good job on keeping a place this size pretty clean.

Before I go, let me mention the salsa bar they have set up. You have a total of 8 different sauces ranging from pico de gallo, to salsa verde, to extra spicy habanero! Besides that, they have the basic pickled veggies and sauteed peppers/onions that you would find in a fajita. So to me this is another plus because of all the unlimited variety of topping choices you can add to your meal.

So in closing, I would  come back here from time to time, especially for the Elotes because not every Mexican place has them. I just wished they didn't charge so much for 1 little taco. This is what subtracts the 1 star. Still, they get a solid 4 stars from me.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,15,9,4,1d4mcGlJp5-j7V95qotCBw

Thanks to Jamie W advice, Taco Taco was a major bookmark for the week, and it's only a hop, skip,  jump from Henderson.    Well, not a that short of a trip, but it's closer than driving to Charleston for a few real tacos.

Located at the northeast corner of Tropicana and Peco at the north end of the strip center, Taco Taco stands out pretty good because of the very bright lighting inside.   Also, the place look huge from the outside, but it's kind of narrow when you walk in.   Seeing the set up of the ordering area, I could see some problem in the future when they start getting busy.   Thankfully, I got there late on Sunday night, and in the dining room  was kind of packed, but everyone was already eating.  

The place is set up like El Gordo, and you make your order at set stations for your order.   Unlike El Gordo, this places has more selection on the menu board, which was nice to see.     I ended up ordering two Asada, two Al Pastor, and a Mexican corn on a cob.

As I was placing my order, one of the cooks were making corn tortillas from scratch.   I was very please to see this, because when bite into my first bite I could tell a total difference between Taco Taco and other places like like them.    My toritilla wasn't soaked in oil, like another place famous for this, and I was very pleased with the taste of  the meat.   I would put them on par with El Gordo, but they put way more meat than them, and had the killer salsa bar.    I was stunned to see the multiple  selection, and they even had pinto and black beans as a selection inside of the bar.

I almost feel like giving this place a five star, and I should but.....I'm going to visit them a few times before giving them that award.    BTW, that Mexican corn was KILLER!",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,3,3,4,WmfOS4ZiD4Cn5DEGMhRmuA

I've tried the elote once before but didn't get it again because I was too full to eat my tacos afterwards and just because im not really a fan of elote in general. Lol good flavor, and really sweet corn. Next, the only drink I get is horchata! Not too sweet or grainy, it's perfect!
In my opinion, this place is better than Tacos El Gordo, Pepe's, Roberto's, Fauto's, Las Gorditas, Jalisco Cantina, Imperial Tacos & Beer, and Taco Tijuana. I'm no expert on tacos or anything lol I just reaaaally like them. I could live off tacos haha. They are fresher, bigger portions, bigger flavor, better sauces, more seating (especially their location on Eastern) and faster.

They also offer nachos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls (definitely need to try this ), vampiros, tostadas. Their salsa bar is also pretty expansive.

Best elotes in town, hands down!
This place is super far from me or i'd go all the time. It's worth the drive though

We entered through the back of the restaurant but there is no way of telling that from the outside. There weren't specific instructions on where or how to order, just a bunch of taco stations. Each station offered something different. I am still not sure if you order at the station, or at the person up front explaining things. 
What I do know is this was some of the best taco meat I've had, ever, in life. 
I went with 2 al pastors and one carne. They were all exceptional, but the al pastor took the cake. I could eat 5 of these, and will FOR SURE opt for the grande size taco on my next visit. 
The salsa bar had 6 salsas, carrots, onions, radishes, jalapeños, cucumbers and limes. Did I mention besides all the awesome selections it was extremely clean?!!

I've been here twice, first I went vegetarian simply because I don't trust the meat at a lot of places, I got a rice bowl, with beans, some weird mushroom mixture, rice, salsa and lettuce. It was flavorless and stomach churning. Got chips and guacamole, again flavorless.  I decided, it's just another shitty mexican joint that I will drive past and ignore, like most. 

A couple months go by, I hear they are opening multiple locations, I decided I must have missed something, so I went back for lunch this last weekend.  My wife and I got 2 Street corn on the cobs with ""butter"", chili powder and lime. Butter has quotes around it cause what they use, that shit is not butter. I got a pastor burrito and my wife got a rice bowl. We also got chips and guacamole and I got a coke. 

First, the corn was forgettable, makes you appreciate the dude selling it on the street. My burrito was God awful, the pork tastes like it's seasoned with kool-aid packets, I took 2 bite and lost 100% of my appetite. One of the worst meals I had ever had. Chips were stale and guacamole taste like it was left over from last time I was there. No salsa bar. My wife's bowl was nothing more than OK. My coke was spectacular. 

As I said, my food was terrible, but also, their ordering system is terrible, welcome to America, learn our procedures. With a normal ordering system you might be able to cut down on the 3 extra employees standing around checking their Facebook. 

Did I mention the temperature, oh ya, it was unbelievable hot in the dining area, my wife actually stood up and lowered the thermostat, it didn't help. We both left dripping with sweat and our clothes stretched out, my wife considered taking her pants off for the ride home to air out. It was disgusting.

You're hungry
You're on the way to a BBQ
Host of said BBQ is going to be 20 min late...
What do you do? What. Do. You. Do?

You say screw the BBQ and pick up a burrito at Taco Taco! Done deal. I had heard about this place during a late night Yelp menu reading session (it's a problem) and when I saw I was in the area, there was no turning back. 

Upon walking in you're greeted with the biggest taco shop dining room you've ever seen. Soccer playing on the TV, salsa bar to the right. Perfect. Problem? It was at least 100 degrees in the place. With griddles fired up in the open kitchen, you need that AC popping! I was forced to take this meal to-go. 

The menu is fairly simple. Burrito, taco, bowl, gran taco (taco with extra toppings). Fill with toppings and meats. Done. I rocked a burrito filled with al pastor (which you can see marinating in the corner), cheese, guac, pico, black beans, lettuce, hot salsa and a bit of rice. $7. Size? Perfect. A single meal wrapped up. Not a small baby or an app. Taste. WOW. Easily the best burrito I've ever had. The tender, moist spiced meat mixed with all the ingredients well and there was no 'filler bites' of rice or toppings. There was so much flavor, I barely used the salsa I took with me. Typically, I wouldn't give a place 5 stars based on one menu item, but considering the while menu is what I ate wrapped in different shells, I think it's OK. Skip the BBQ. Grab the burrito.

First off - I'll say that the place is very very clean.  In addition to it being clean - it's an open kitchen so you can see the food being cooked and prepared in front of you.  Right in front of where you place your order - there is a hand washing station.  Guests can use it as well as employees if they are out on the floor.  Their refrigerator unit is behind the cashier and it's glass so you can clearly see inside of it.

I ordered a small carne asada fries which was $4.95.  It was packed with meat, cheese, pico, guac and your choice of black or refried beans.  I opted for the black beans.Quite honestly -I can't imagine what the full size order for $9.25 is because this small order would more than suffice.

In addition - I ordered carne asada tacos - these, too were amazing but I asked them to hold the guac and it turns out they put it on there anyway.  That's the only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars.

Taco Y Taco will not get another cent of my hard earned money. In fact, if someone offered to treat me to tacos at their restaurant, i would decline the offer.
Consistently poor service is the reason for my denying them my future patronage.
From the cashier to the taco cooks, there are no smiles at all. The sign does not say, but I suspect smiles would happen if I placed a tip in the jar. Hello, it doesn't work that way... you have to treat me nice first! 
My recent and last visit was an interaction with the taco cook that was rude to say the least. I ordered the happy hour street tacos and he looked over my shoulder at the clock (it was 6:15 pm) and he gazed at said clock for what seemed like a solid minute. Then, he doesn't make the tacos. I wait and order a quesadilla from the quesadilla area (again, no smile there either). I go back to the taco area (where there are now 2 other customers ordering tacos. Still no tacos. I stare at the taco guy and he looks back at me and I say, tacos??? He looks at me and says tacos. I said remember, I ordered street tacos. He gives the other customers a look and then looks back at me. I should have walked out but did not.
Flash forward to the cashier and she rings up my $13 order and I ask to add one drink. Total comes to $23+. I say that is too much and read off what I have on my tray. She said no, that is the total. She reads off to me what I have on my tray and I ask how that adds up to $23+??? She tells me it does and I am done with the back and forth so I pay and ask for the receipt. The receipt shows nachos and I tell her that I do not have nachos. She points to my container and says nachos and I tell her that is chips and guacamole (also on the receipt) and she tells me she thought it was both chips/guacamole and nachos. All in one container???

It's basically two hard tortillas sandwiching whatever meat and fillings would normally come in a taco. It's a little more difficult to eat, but it's crunchy and super filling. Other than that, the tacos are better than other shops in that the meat isn't super fatty and the quality of the fillings is great (guacamole!).

I'm intrigued by Taco Taco because:

MUSIC: It's really loud and goes from Red Hot Chili Peppers to some hardcore Mexicana shit that brought back memories of a booze cruise in Cabo wih ten professional surfers, jungle juice bong and wrestling masks. GOOD TIMES.(Donkey were not present on the booze cruise.)

CASHIER: She is a darker version of Shakira, dresses really stylish and either wears a jewel or has a flippin piercing in her forehead. Whatever the case I think she looks like a gypsy and it's awesome!

SALSA BAR: Yes, this salsa bar wins and then wins again when the other salsa bars are checking their smart phones for tips on how to win. The salsa bar has over eight different salsas, carrot/onion mix, peppers, limes and other shit I know is there, but didn't reach for. It's always clean and well stocked.

FOOD: It's all about the tacos. I've only done the carne asada and it's pretty bomb. They don't destroy it by slopping on a fist full of guac. either like another taco shop on E. Charleston across from the old Macayo Vegas. Tacos are $2 a pop and full of meat. It's a deal. The burrito? Not so much. I swear it was $6 for the carne asada burrito and it had more rice and beans nonsense than meat. Stick with the tacos, add chips for $1.25 and head on over to the buffet of salsa. 

Overall Taco Taco is a solid taco option for people near this area. The staff is friendly and fast and the restaurant is clean and has plenty of seating and the tacos are the best in the neighborhood.

This place has a very similar setup like Tacos El Gordo, but has a little more variety on the menu, a nice salsa station, and is much more spacious. 

I like the fact that you can order rice bowls, burritos, and grandes tacos from their menu. I tried their rice bowl with the al pastor. I was hoping to get the al pastor straight from the roasting spit, but it was taken from a container from that station. The rice bowl was okay, but I know it could've tasted better if the al pastor was freshly cut off of that beautiful stack of heavenly marinated pork. The al pastor burrito was alright also. It had pinto beans and I think rice. I can't say that I was a fan. My all time favorites are still the regular $2 al pastor tacos topped with pineapple. While waiting for my order, I'm checking out the tripas just chillen in the next station. The homie cuts me a few samples. MMMMMM grimey. I ended up ordering a couple of tripas tacos also. Soon after getting your order, you will find yourself at the salsa station. There is quite a variety of sauces to choose from. Their pico de gallo combo'ed with their other hot sauces is the winner. Don't forget to get some onions and peppers at the salsa station. I was hoping to see an Orange Bang on tap in the establishment. They didn't have my favorite drank whenever I'm eating tacos. They did however carry the Mexican bottled Coca Cola. Sugar sweatened Coca Cola tastes just like how it used to taste like when I was a kid. 

All in all, I really enjoyed stuffing my face at Taco Taco. Another great brick and mortar taco shop to spend my money at. SATISFIED!!!",mIEuWv7fqPzCqzPe3JkC6Q,2,1,4,0SYCmA-yrXKzOCXF9zbYAw

3366465,2014-08-27,0,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"I would give it 5, but the quality/style changes depending on who works.  

I like to get either a rice bowl or a burrito.
The meats we choose are Carnitas, Al Pastor, Lengua.
They also have a delicious vegetarian mushroom type option I get if I am not feeling up to anything at all greasy.

I love the steamed corn.  They have a Mexican version I haven't tried with mayonnaise and cheese, but  I just don't want to know if I like anything that adds the calories up even more.

Good and Bad:    The tortilla is good quality, large, and the burrito is plentiful.
I have to ask for it the way I like.  Cheese melted on it first then the other ingredients.  if you don't ask it may come a different way each time.

Issues:  I have gotten Lengua 3 times.  Once was lean and perfect.  Two other times it seemed almost like the skin was left on or it was way overcooked with chewy tough edges and was inedible.  I had to pull the meat out.  So, I just don't order this anymore.  Not worth the chance of receiving the bad version.  I guess you could ask to taste it before they add it.

The carnitas is different depending on who works too.  Sometimes it is GREAT meaty bits with a delicious flavor and other times it includes large globs of FAT with NO MEAT attached.  I mean come on.  Totally gross and puts you off the food.  Now I try to ask for lean.  Didn't seem to make a difference last time.  Had to pull the fat out of a burrito.  So now I have been ordering it as a rice bowl more often to make it easier.  Very very sad that I have to even think about this.

The Al pastor has been good each time.  It is best when they cut it up into smaller pieces.  

All the other items are good quality.  I never see any old looking items or even avocado that has turned colors even.  Nice job.  Let's work on the meat consistency and trim the fat off please.

Best tacos ever? Yeah I have to say so. They have every type of meat and style that I can think of. 

Ok, so the store is laid out in stations for different types of tacos/food. Start near the entrance furthest from the dining area and start loading up your tray with anything that looks good.

I recommend to get the mexican style street corn, a vampiro if you've never had one, and definitely the al pastor (pork on rotating spit) tacos. One of the guys there even gave me a slice of beef tongue (lengua) to try and it was awesome. I would probably get this on a taco or even a vampiro next time I go.

Came here last night around 7pm to grab some shrimp tacos (3 to be exact) and 1 shrimp burrito. The guy who took my order didn't speak a word of English, which is to be expected but not understanding the sentence ""3 shrimp tacos on corn tortilla"" isn't acceptable. 
So he starts the shrimp on the grill grabs one tortilla and says ""what it"". I remind him it's 3 tacos. He looks confused and had to ask someone what I was saying. He says ok gets three tortillas. He had to remake the first one 3 times because he kept putting the wrong thing on them. The shrimp is done and he puts exactly two shrimp pieces on each taco. When I've been here in the past there was always at least 6-7 pieces. When I try to ask him about this he shrugged. I decided to try and talk to someone else. He then proceeds to mess up the buritto as well by putting guac on it which I said no to. I get to the cashier and it got worse...
I walk up and attempt to explain my situation to her, I even show her the amount of shrimp on my tacos. She laughs, snatches my debit card out of my hand and charges me right away. It was $20. She charged me for the tacos he messed up and the guac on the buritto. Now the money is not the issue here, it's the fact she laughed and literally took my debit card from me without my permission. I did not sign the receipt so I will be filling a statement with my bank.

3409181,2015-08-24,0,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"The Good: 
Taco Y Taco is like a Mexican Subway. You tell them what you want on your burrito and they make it in front of you. My absolute favorite aspect of this place is that they offer vegetarian (soy based) chorizo. The food is bomb with huge portions and is relatively inexpensive.

The bad: 
At the time we went, AFTER they made our food and we went to the cashier station, they said they don't accept credit/debit cards -_- We actually had to leave our food to get cold and go find a bank so that I could take out cash. It was a huge inconvenience and it really pissed me off that they couldn't warn the customers with a sign on the door or something. Or at least have the customers pay before they make the damn food. I will say, the cashier was very nice and apologetic about it, and I appreciated that. 

The Ugly:
The way the restaurant is set up, aesthetically makes no sense at all. It's a really weird, slightly uncomfortable environment. The 'decor', if you want to call it that, is an atrocity and again, makes no sense. They seem to be pretty busy and are doing well for themselves, why not spend a little money updating the look of the place to make it palatable. I understand it's supposed to be authentic Mexican, which usually doesn't look too nice inside. But this is Las Vegas, we get tons of tourists from all over the world, and a place that looks like that would not keep tourist coming back to this establishment.

Just my brutally honest opinion. The food is very good but it's hard to get over everything else. Next time I will definitely order for pick up instead of eating there.",IBfXie3My8uh8aYmynC3Sw,0,0,3,KRAfE6BHo_jf1iuCGeaXtA

A friend of mine, who is Hispanic, told me that this place was better than Tacos El Gordo. SWEET, I'm always down to trying places especially if people say it's better than some other place. Well sorry to disappoint it was mediocre at best. 

So we'll start off with food. I got the Carne Asada Fries and Al Pastor tacos. The tacos were pretty decent and I'd say would be on par with Tacos El Gordo, if it was a little spicier. That was a little disappointment to me. The carne asada fries were completely disappointing. The meat was pre-cooked and put in storage containers on the side for the Fries station. So the meat wasn't even hot at all. It was luke warm, maybe. Maybe the fries were not enough to make it luke warm. I'm not to sure. The overall taste of it was very disappointing!! 

I was too hungry to remember to take pictures =[ oops. I'll definitely come back to try the other tacos, but definitely skipping the fries. 

Oh, it was pretty dirty. Which is really a big no no for me, hopefully they clean up. The fans looked like there were years of dust on it....yes I said years. Maybe it was a few months, but it looked pretty bad and gross to me. 

I did like the condiment bar, lots to choose from which was nice! 

The soda.....skip it, most of it was flat or tasted weird =\ ugh I hate flat soda! But the horchata was really good!

You can customize most of the food on the menu. Begin by choosing an item that you want to order and then choose your meat and fillings. Some of the meat options include  are alpastor, carne asada, lengua, and cabeza. If you don't eat meat, no worries. There's a soyrizo option. I have yet to try this, but I've heard positive things from friends who did. 

On this visit, I got the bowl and chose alpastor as my meaty filling along with pinto beans, lettuce, shredded cheese, and pico de gallo. Guacamole is $1 more, but I'd suggest getting a side of chips an guac for a few bucks because you will receive a generous amount of guacamole that might be enough for both chips and your entree. Back to my order, I thought the meat was good and surprisingly not salty. I say that because most Mexican restaurants I've been to in Vegas add too much salt to their food -- or not enough. Kick your food up a notch by hitting up the salsa bar. The extra hot habanero sauce is a good choice; made me perspire a bit.

I didn't get anything from the salsa bar so I can't comment on if it was good or not. I can however comment on the following:

Cheese Quesadilla - This was priced at $2.25 and very good! It was filled with the perfect amount of cheese and wasn't really greasy. I would order this again.

Al Pastor - Priced at $2.00 each these didn't blow my socks off. It was missing the pineapple I love so much and just lacked the flavor I have had at other places. This is usually my favorite thing to order but not so much here. I will probably give it another try on a different day to see if something is different but if not I wouldn't order it again.

Asada Tacos - These were amazing. Such good flavor! I wish I had gotten more of these than the al pastor but I will know for next time. 

Asada Burrito - I didn't like this. Hubby gave me some to try and it just didn't have the same flavor as the asada in the tacos. They did pull the asada meat for the burrito from a different place then the asada that was on the grill for the tacos so I don't know if they make them different but I will personally stick to the asada tacos instead of the burrito.

They offer rice bowls and have vegetarian options. I can't say I will make the effort to drive across town just to eat at Taco Taco but when I am in the area I will stop in for sure since it is a cheap and good.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,25,21,4,zBqkVxMG7TJcpnUK_LzSmQ

3538960,2014-08-06,0,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"Kept on hearing I had to try this place!  Many kept on comparing to another taco place that is very popular  in Vegas.  Yes , yes , "" Tacos el Fatty"" !  Where to start ? I walked in and never as busy as the comparison  and the staff was to busy talking to each other instead of helping the few customers they did have.  I almost left, but another customer walked over and asked if it was my first time. (Probably my confused look) I Said yes and he explained how it all works.  Your typical taco place where you go order what you want from where you want it.   Tortillas smelled good and they taste home made.  The tacos were good, but nothing out of this world.  I would not compare as they hold their own, but  will admit the way they are prepared is very untraditional !  I've seen the local and the traditional  taquero who prepare a taco with passion and ensures it's delicious. These were more of Taco Bell style where they know they need to add this and that because somebody told them that is what it should have .  Making a good tacos is an art... Believe it or not!   The tacos de Asada were good and will admit better than tacos el fatty.  However then we come to al pastor !! I stand that Tacos El gordo has the best al pastor. The meat , the seasoning , and that green sauce makes the taco Amazing and Taco y Taco was good as the pineapple in top adds flavor  but the meat was a little cold and lacked flavor compared to others.   In closing if you are hungry and want tacos Al pastor and can't wait or don't feel like driving then yes this is your place.  However if you want a great tacos al pastor this would not be the place .  Also the place was not as clean as it could have been.  In my opinion  with the amount of employees present floors should have been spotless , fountain drink area should have been clean and salsa bar should have been up kept.  Oh not all was that bad .. The corn on the Cobb with all the fixing was amazing and I would go back just for that!!",3cBVCNsm273EJ_GM4FVvJg,0,0,2,OmDnQRznxplzxXPphlGqRw

3565325,2015-08-14,0,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"I can honestly say this is hands down the best chicken taco I have had outside of Mexico. The set up when you walk into this place is a little confusing but holy shit is it worth it!!!! For 2$ and some change you get the most packed with meat taco on a fresh made corn tortilla. The lady was literally pressing out and cooking fresh off the grill tortillas for all the people in line. Makes a huge difference in the taste compared to pre made shitty corn tortillas. I got the regular taco which is just your choice of meat, salsa, onions, and cilantro. Simple yet delicious!! Personally I like them more simple (street taco style) If you want the beans and guac and sour cream and all the other shit ,you should probably just get a burrito. If you are one to like a little more flavor they also offer a salsa bar with a large variety of salsas to add. Another perk of this place is the street corn or elotes. Not a lot of taco spots in town offer it. It's not the best I've had here but it's pretty good. The best I've had was out of the back of a van in a parking Lott. Sketchy and delicious. So in conclusion If you are in the mood for some tacos that taste like they came out of a taco shack in Mexico this is your place. If your looking for some fancy Tex mex or Americanized taco fusion or whatever else is out there you probably won't be happy with the simple deliciousness of this place. Either way try it. You probably won't be disappointed.",ZdMh7MllvWVY4TEMawGTEQ,0,1,5,MEXgWJ3Arv9gcytrhU-aug

Yes, they have a wide variety of things, yes, its clean and spacious, and their condiment bar is pretty cool, etc. but when we arrived here on a Friday night, I was expecting tables to be packed since there are many highly rated reviews. We had an empty dining room with only one other table.

We entered through the back and the ladies were pretty nice and helpful, and we ordered an Elote(Corn on the cob) from her. The order system is similar to Gordo's
so its not difficult navigating your way down the line. While the ladies were nice, no service with a smile from the guys, and we kept repeating our order at lest 3-4 times because the music was too loud and they had a hard time remembering what we ordered. We ordered some Nopales(Cactus) and three tacos-Al Pastor, Tripa, and Cabeza.

We liked the corn and the cactus was pretty good with the beans, but the tacos were okay. The Cabeza was pretty bland, I always request Tripa extra crispy, but this was still chewy on the inside. The best of the three was the Al Pastor. Good flavor, but pretty skimpy on the meat. Glad I tried this place though. Its okay, But you have a much better option just up a few blocks from here....ALOHA!!!

3620875,2018-03-22,3,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"I love trying new taco places but this restaurant was literally the worst taco restaurant i've been too! First off we got 9 tacos (al pastor, carne asada, & cactus) a horchata and a soda. To each their own preference but this place has terrible service and food. Their instagram pictures looks NOTHING like their actual food as well. I recommend checking out real reviews and pictures on yelp first before going anywhere new. They also didn't honor the tuesday tacos like advertised as well. ($2 tacos) 

Their lines to get the tacos are pretty cool, you grab a tray and get in line for the workers to make your tacos in front of you. But for my opinion, i highly dislike this because you have to wait 3-4 different lines to get your order which really takes more time and it gets confusing. I wish it was a simple ordering system, order and pay. It's nice they have a good option of taco meat and vegetarian options as well. (Cactus and Soyrizo) The workers here weren't the nicest but they weren't bad so nothing to really complain. When we finished ordering it came out to like almost $30 for 9 tacos and 2 drinks which isn't really cheap. I feel like for that price i could've ordered from another place and had a more enjoyable experience and tacos. But that's the beauty of trying new restaurants. I REALLY wanted to try this taco restaurant because of their beautiful instagram pictures but to be honest that's probably just at the other location not tropicana because their tacos looks NOTHING like their pictures. :( 

This location is huge, not many decor but they do have the classic bar with condiments. (Almost empty though)

My tacos were mediocre but it's soooo OILY. My Al Pastor was dripping in oil and my tortilla was soaking wet. It made my stomach so upset after finishing only 2 of those tacos. We also had the Carne Asada tacos which was flavorful but def wasn't the best and those cactus taco is a NO GO. I think cactus is more of a acquired taste and it was so crunchy and slimy and flavorless.. i don't know how i feel about this. I think i just hated it because my taste buds probably expected meat not flavorless plants lol. But it's still nice they have veggie options for people! Lastly i wanted to talk about horchata because i LOVE it but the horchata here is SUPER SWEET like i barely could taste the drink and it was like drinking warm sugar.. it was also so unsanitary because i watched her scoop my drink with a ladle from a white dirty bucket.. yeah i'm not sure if this is a place i'd like to come back to. 

I don't like writing bad reviews because i feel all restaurant have their good and bad days but this place wasn't clean, and the food wasn't good quality whatsoever. The service was passable but i'm not
coming back. I drove 30 mins to here and i won't come back there's sooo many other amazing taco trucks and places out there to go to. 

Be safe about what you put into your stomach, some
places can cause food poisoning this place was just waaay too unsanitary and food quality was super low. Check some other taco places out on yelp!",sI8d5Usaa_2OzUj6cpvPUQ,7,3,2,4tiQirPvyn5kh58QqDUtfw

I usually order their carne asada tacos & elote - both of which are DIVINE - but occasionally, I'll mix it up & order a few carne asada vampiros instead. Paired with a glass bottle of Coke & some flan, you can't go wrong.

I mean, I took 5 years of Spanish living in San Diego, so I can kinda get by, but this is a place where all the workers speak Espanol to each other and I couldn't keep up!  And when I ordered in English, I felt very much like a Gringo!  Damn, I wish I had practiced that Spanish more after high school!

Anyway, let's get to the food.  They have burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and bowls, but I went for the little street tacos!  I got one asada, one carnitas, and one al pastor.

Asada: Meat was very flavorful and juicy.  Sometimes when you get asada at other places, it can by dry and tough.  This stuff was delicioso.

Carnitas: They were ok, not my favorite of the three.

Al Pastor: WINNER WINNER WINNER!!!!!  This meat was INSANE.  Such good flavor, and the sauce they put on top of it was great!  Only thing I didn't like was the chunk of pineapple they put on top (I really hate pineapple), but it was ok cuz I just gave it to my husband.

Tortillas: I have a big problem with corn tortillas because they always split in the middle when you try to pick up the taco and all your innards get everywhere, but NOT HERE.  These tortillas held it together and were nicely toasted.

Salsa Bar: 1 salsa? 2 salsas?  No. SIX salsas!!!  And there was a smoky spicy one that's the kind that's so spicy, but you can't stop eating it because if you stop your lips will burn so you just have to keep eating it!!  A good burn.  Also, there were carrots and even beans at the salsa bar.

Ambiance: The restaurant is very large, very clean, and they even had live entertainment singing.

Tacos were okay. Don't get al pastor/adobada. Don't waste your time. It's nasty. A good side was that there carnitas is on point. Try it on a mula (quesadilla like with extra goodies inside and your choice of meat!) $4 but pretty tasty. 

Okay.. Biggest disappointment.. The vampiro. It was supposed to be the deal breaker from the recommendations I got. Yeah, no. Totally burnt tasting. Why? Cause they burnt it! 

Ryan and I were thinking.. Maybe it was an off day..? But then we thought, tacos el Gordo doesn't have off days. So we decided it was their fault, in which it rightly is. 

Oh, the salsa bar is pretty sweet. One problem. No labels. Thanks for the mystery taste adventure, but if someone is allergic to one of those sauces .. It won't look good later...

I was sorely disappointed.  The front staff were not helpful when I asked about Vegan options So I proceeded to order the veggie burritto.  She made a comment under her breath about not having many vegetables, but I had no idea, they had been around some time!!   Instead of telling me the veggies were not fresh , she put them in my burritto.   The onions were chewy and completely dried out and the burrito was slightly warm when it was served.  I was treating my niece for lunch and hers was also just OK and slightly warm.  Since these were not edible as is, we took them home and  proceeded to add a few more fresh ingredients and pulled out the dried veggies and threw it to broil.  After a bit of doctoring it was much better.  
I totally wasted $20 bucks for lunch...I hate to waste food, but  on second thought I really should not have eaten it and made my own lunch from scratch.

Not sure what this place used to be. Very nice, clean atmosphere. You seat yourself. They have a self service soda station and salsa bar. 
Some of the things we ordered were the Carne asada Vampiro and tacos. I was not a fan of the Carne asada. That is my only complaint with this place. The meat had a very smokey flavor to it. I know some people enjoy that, I'm not one of them. Especially with Mexican food. Smoked meat flavors are for BBQ. 
My favorite was the Al Pastor! OMG that's a MUST! I've gotta say probably the best Al Pastor I've ever had. I wish I would have gotten that in my Vampiro instead of the Carne asada. They have all of the regular Mexican dishes. Nachos, burritos, tacos, etc. I've never seen the Vampiro before. It was two mini tortillas with cheese,your choice of meat and cilantro. Think of a mini tostada sandwich. I uploaded a pic too.
Ordered a chicken quesadilla. Nothing special. They put guacamole, sour cream and cilantro in it with the chicken & cheese. 
The CORN. Oh my yum, the CORN! 
On a stick, mayo, Parmesan and paprika. Don't knock it till you try it if you've never had it. 
Chips and guacamole were ok. I like fresh guacamole. Theirs is pre-made and portioned in the fridge, ready to go. 
I liked all of the different salsas they have.had to get an order of chips to try them all.

4040093,2013-03-18,0,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"By nature we usually compare new things we try to our favorites. 

I think my comparison for Taco Taco is definitely Gordo's! 

Upon seeing the lay out it does scream copycat, but looks are deceiving because I think their offerings are better than Gordo's the only point ill give to Gordo's is their adobada. Taco Taco wins in everything else.

I love Gordo's, but its always so busy! I know dumb reason to knock them, but I am happy to have discovered Taco Taco from friends.

I'd also say it's like a chipotle mixed with a Gordo's. There's a large seating area. It's always clean. The salsa bar is legit! It really is an awesome thing to have for your customers especially when you're not dining in. A label for each sauce would be good.

My first visit was during a lunch break.

I was the only person ordering and it took awhile for my food to get to me. Considering the large staff I just didn't see how it was possible. 

I can't knock them for my making my food fresh, but Gordo's is quick.

Whenever I try a new place I always go crazy ordering new things so I can get a real taste for their food. 

This is my final conclusion on their food.

I had their al pastor gran tacos which were yummy. I think the flavor is too salty, but still good. They are like a ""supreme"" taco of sorts. It's larger than their regular tacos and are packed with meat. I've also had their carne asada tacos which are good. Their fries come in full and half sizes and they also carry nachos in both sizes. You can get any meat on either. I had a bowl today that was also really good. You get a lot of choices on what you can have on the tacos. 

One disappointment was when I had a language taco their was no sauce on it. Since the salsa bar has so many salsas this shouldn't be a problem, but maybe a suggestion for which sauce pairs best with each meat? 

Overall it's a hit for me.

My only gripe with the place is that I don't like their ordering system. The staff is nice in that they don't send you to a different area they'll just tell the order to the ""correct"" person. If they found a good ordering system and a way to translate it to their customers it would make it easier for them to take orders, easier for them to serve customers, and they'd make more money in return. 

They have shrimp on the weekends, but they have run out the three times I've been. I can't wait to try them though.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,5,1,5,2HtX1xeWCN-MehQ0OEwA6g

All the meat, beans, and tortillas are made fresh and all are good.
They have a very wide selection of meats from your standard carne asada/carnitas/shrimp to the more exotic cabeza/lengua/3 things I never even heard of! On top of all those meats they even have soyrizo for you veggie types and I overheard somebody say the beans are prepared vegetarian as well.
The ingredients all seem really fresh, and I liked the setup of different stations for the different meats (although nobody seemed to be following directions the day we were there). 
One complaint: while delicious, the 'gran taco' is definitely overpriced at ~$4.50 for fish or shrimp.
It's not super close to my house, but when I'm feeling a taco, I would definitely go out of my way for taco taco.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,0,0,4,6XoETqjpVzwfbyiFJG_bHg
4051466,2013-05-01,3,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"I don't about this place.. My Al Pastor tasted like deli meat.  I had three or four order of it and i still couldn't get over the idea why it reminded me of a cold cut.  I've even tried to experiment with the salsa bar and even that didn't work.  I just couldn't mask that idea out of my head.  

At least the chorizo was fantastic.  Not greasy like your average sausage.  Just the right amount of crumble, chunks, and mMmmm.  

Service was great, and staff were friendly.  Spacious and clean.

After my encounter with the Al Pastor here it is highly unlikely i'll ever return unless they offer some type of bread, then maybe.  Even the salsa bar did nothing for me.  It was just underwhelming

It's actually not all that hard to find after you turn from Tropicana on to Pecos, If it's your first time, enter from the street side to start at the front of the line and read the overhead signs to see what you can order. Go around the corner for the taco stations and try to line up roughly near a sign with something that you want, and just try to get in your full order.

Shelling out $2 per taco isn't terribly expensive for the morsels of goodness that I managed to obtain, and being able to use my credit card was a pleasant surprise. I went for the al pastor, having heard so much about it, as well as the lengua (tongue) and cabeza (head meat) because those just sound good.

One meat beats all other: Al Pastor. I can order four of those bad boys and still eat more. Their asada meat is also okay, but rather dry. I can spend $8 here and be so full I would not eat lunch the next day. If you're in a group (because this is the only way to avoid single person gluttony), get the fries with al pastor meat. Comes with cheese, lots of guac, and other fixings. I would recommend only ordering the half size because that was enough to feed four people and then some.

Everyone is really nice -- even when they heard my order wrong, they still fixed it and delivered it to our table. The salsa bar is immaculate, with six different types of sauces. The space is always very clean and they play a variety of songs. I enjoy watching Telemundo variety shows, though. 

Their customer service is also amazing -- we came in one day after EDC and they were running a special. Proof of attendance = 1 chorizo taco.

Walking in, you start off with a choice of food (tacos, burritos, bowls, etc.), along with the individual ingredients like meat, beans, and salsa that go into your order. The great thing about this place is their extensive selection of meats, ranging from the familiar carne asada,  to even some vegetarian options like soyrizo.

For my first visit, I went with an al pastor bowl. Everything was fresh and tasty. Their approach to food is a lot less greasy than the typical taquerias around town, which made it so I didn't waddle out of the restaurant with deep sighs of caloric regret. This is something I really appreciate, especially when I keep an eye out for a regular lunch spot.

Eating here reminds me of when I got out of school and all of us broke kids would pull our money together and buy as many tacos as we could afford. And although I've come a long way from that, I do still know where I came from. 

The menu is super simple. It's divided up into stations depending on what you want to order. You just tell them what you want and they make it right in front of you. Hot and fresh!!!! Like I said, get pineapples with the al pastor tacos. Mind f***ing blowing!! Meat is tender and melt in your mouth. And when you add the pineapple, salt and sweet together, boom!!!! You just can't eat at Roberto's anymore. The most I could eat right now is 4, but I'm sure when my appetite is back to where it was, I can scarf down 10 with no problems. 

Their condiment station is ridiculous. All the extras (cucumbers, radishes, carrots, etc) are always fresh and don't look like they've been sitting out for hours. There are multiple sauces to meet everyone's taste preferences! So good I came back the next day for seconds just to double check if it was really that good. And it was :)

Now here's my reason for the 4 stars and not 5. I ordered the Mexican corn (elote) and it was just eh. I'm used to the the guy honking the horn with his cart, walking the neighborhood streets in LA. That's my comparison and it didn't meet it. Even after the mayo, Parmesan cheese and chili powder, it was still bland. Guess I need to take a trip back to Inglewood just for the elote guy. Second, the line to pay can be a pain. You're standing there waiting and your food is getting cold. Boo!!! And the horchata is way to sweet. Had to add water to drink it. 

But that's enough of the negatives. That's not enough to make me stop coming here. Now I don't have to drive to the other side of town for good eats. Now get your butt up and get some! Did you not see my pictures?!?! GO!",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,4,2,4,yTRtT2dpQSbBW653aOFckg

The set up of the restaurant is a little confusing.  The doors facing the shopping center is actually the back door where you'll find the tables and salsa bar.  Instead, enter from the entrance nearest Pecos and it will bring you to the ordering stations.  

There are two ordering stations.  The one you see when you first enter is where you can order bowls, burritos, nachos, fries, and elotes.  The station with numbers on the side is where you order your tacos 

I love how friendly the staff here are.  They've always started a conversation with me while I'm ordering and helpd me change up my order. Did I mention the portions here are huge!!  So far everything I've tried, I couldn't finish.

Taco Taco has become a weekly tradition for me. I come after work on Fridays as a gift to myself for all my good behavior of not dining out and not buying food during my work week I end my Friday by hitting up Taco Taco. 

I have come to love their burritos and although I am a fan of tacos I have always been more of a fan of burritos. Upon first coming here I ordered tacos, because well, the name. But after returning a few times I branched out. Believe me, everything here is good, not just the tacos.

Many have compared this place to kind-of-sort-of Chipotle. I sort of agree. The burritos here are made in the same fashion - pick your meat, pick your other ingredients. I LOVE their pollo here. It has such an amazing flavor and the rice has a rich flavor as well. Beans are on spot and the tortillas are perfect - not too thin, not too thick.

The girl making the tortillas had no idea what was being said but glad to say she got some AMAZING tacos with no tomatoes of any kind on them.

There is nothing on the menu I can say is bad here however some of the items were very salty.  One person in the group go a Chorizo taco and was way too salty for her.

The owners were here again on this visit which I mentioned in my last review...They were busy but I need to address something here. 

They are young, beautiful, successful women who have a place that makes amazing food and has a great atmosphere.  I did get a response to my last review where I mentioned the owners did not seem real friendly to the customers, they basically ignored everyone instead of saying hi and see how things were going.  The response was that they used to do this but some people took offense to this and thought they were flitting with people when they came to your table.

First off, they can flirt with me anytime...Second, this is their business and it shows a lot of Pride and Satisfaction in an owner who walks around, welcomes you and thanks you for coming into their business.  If anyone takes offense to this, then go eat somewhere else.  NEVER NEVER NEVER put an owner of an establishment down or say they are flirting with you or someone you are with when all they are doing is QUALITY CHECKING the Satisfaction of the Customer.

Randal R. and I went as first timers today for lunch.  We walked in through the seating area and found our way to the other side to look at the menu.  I ordered a grilled shrimp taco and 2 lengua tacos to start.  Randal R. ordered 5 different ones (carne asada, al pastor, lengua, buche, and the May special chicharron with pickled onions).  He got Mexican Pepsi, I got Mexican coke.

We were given a freshly roasted plate of green onions and jalapeno, but were chased by a cook with a steaming plate of grilled onions which were amazing with a squeeze of lime.  The salsa bar was stocked with radishes, limes, cucumbers, steaming hot beans, and 8 salsas.  I started off by grabbing the 3 green salsas.  I love green anything (except celery) so this was great, a trifecta!

I had the shrimp first - stuffed with grilled shrimp, avocado, lettuce - sooo tasty.  Then, the lengua - it had tomatillo salsa on it along with cilantro and diced onion.  I added a squeeze of lime and some of the fresh bright green salsa too.  Perfection.  Juicy, tender, zingy...thank goodness I had 2!

Then we decided we needed to do a salsa tasting - I got an order of chips and guac on the cheap and then got all 8 salsas lined up.  My fave was definitely the bright deep green one.

This eatery is located within a shopping center which is fairly large so parking should not be a problem.


Our group came into the eatery about fifteen minutes before they were closing, but still staff stated they'd stay open later for our group of about twelve people. 


Their ordering process is cafeteria style where you stand in line based on the type of meat you want for your tacos. 


Once you know the meat you want, the staffer in that area of your meat or meats will cut up your meat and make your tacos. 


After your tacos are made, you go into another area to meet with the cashier to pay.


The eatery offers tacos of carne Asada, Adobada, el pastor, chicken, cabeza and much more. Tacos come with onions, tomato, cilantro and guacamole.


The presentation of the tacos looked great, the smell was good too according to another groupie. 


The eatery also offers a wide selection of salsa's to serve onto your tacos with limes and onions or tomatoes on the side salsa bar if desired. 


The meat was tender in each bite, flavorful al pastor, chicken and carne Asada. I highly recommend their tacos and a visit for tasty, tender meat and good customer service.
Their salsa selection is also flavorful especially the Orange one.


Tacos are priced at $2.25 each. Note that they also make mullitas, burritos and carne Asada fries or nachos for your pleasure.",KbJRuyiZyGwqhdZN2yjauA,1,0,5,lD3cmXV-8VNARo8ub1XUkg

4721009,2017-07-04,0,zwNC-Ow4eIMan2__bS9-rg,"Taco Y Taco is one of the best taco shops I've tried in Vegas. I like them better than the always crowded and overrated Tacos El Gordo.

My two favorite meats for tacos are carne asada and al pastor, and they do both very well here. The asada is grilled over fire and then chopped, which gives it that great charred flavor. The pastor is shaved off of a rotisserie, and it is always juicy and perfectly seasoned. They have a huge selection of other meats to, and though I haven't tried them all, I do know they have excellent chicken and barbocoa. They also have vegan tacos, though I haven't tried them.

In addition to tacos you can get tostadas and other mexican dishes. One of my favorites is the vampiro, which is like two crispy quesadillas with meat in the middle like a sandwich. If you like crispy, meaty and cheesy you should try one.

The salsa bar could be a bit better and they could have some hotter offerings. The salsas are decent though and the addition of pinto beans at the bar more than makes up for it. I have rarely seen bean dip at a salsa bar but Taco Y Taco is the only place I have ever seen with whole beans at their bar. A very good accompaniment for your tacos.

The prices are about typical for a taco shop, with tacos at $2.50. Their taco size is also typical, so if you have a big appetite your going to spend a little money to get full.

I also got for my friend an asada taco, an asada vampiro and some Mexican corn. 

This place is a little hard to find, I literally drove by it twice and finally had to get directions from Siri. I walk in and the place is pretty clean, am greeted by a few employees working the stations and make my way to the nacho one. Being my first time here I was a little confused but the guy behind the counter explained he would take care of a few of the items and to go to the other window for the asada stuff. This place is very well organized which I can appreciate. So after he's done making my food he goes to the other person I ordered from gets the rest of my order an walks it up front. Talk about good service. Everyone was smiling and I was in and outta there in less then 5 minutes. 

So the food:
I may or may not have accidentally (okay no accident at all) ate my friends asada taco on the way home. I mean, they did still have the vampiro and I immediately wante to go back and get like, 5 more (though i figured id save that for another trip).They were amazing just the right amount of flavor.

The nachos didnt impress me look wise, they kinda seemed pretty bland but as soon as I bit into them I quickly changed my mind. They were awesome. Not the best chicken I've ever had but not the worst and the guacamole could use some more flavor but overall you get more then your money's worth.

The corn is standard Mexican corn. It was okay though I don't recommend getting it to go...it loses most of its flavor in the foil they wrap it in and u just end up with mayo corn.

The vampiro...if u haven't tried it, do. I had a bite of my friends and also amazing. Meat was cooked just right, had a great flavor and only around $3. 

So would I recommend this place? Definitely. Under $15 for all that stuff means the price is right and the food is more then worth it. Some other places have worse nachos for the same price as this whole meal for 2. Ill be back next week if it can wait that long since fortunately/unfortunately this place is just down the street from me. I wouldn't mind trying their asada fries or quesadillas but I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be disappointed with anything you order.",AInVFtRp4P-y5ZHMbD8yhw,0,0,5,9DT68GVf1oVV7h6W1UOltw

b.  Types of Food

- Buritto and large tacos (gran taco

- All that in a  bowl if you don't want the tortilla

- Small Tacos - Yes!  Simply elegant.

- The meats asada, pollo, tripas, barbacoa, al pastor (right off the rotisserie), suadero, trompa, canitas, buche, lengua, chorizo, cabeza, cesos, chicharron.  Man, if you like types of meat that are not normal, this is the place. I had the lengua (tongue), Cesos (brain) and tripas (tripe).  It was all so tasty, tender and subtle in flavor.  Amazing and delicate at same time.

c.  Vegetarians - Yep, they serve vegetarians here and have some very nice alternatives for you.  I did not try any of them as I was devouring the odd / weird meat tacos.

d.  Location - Easy to find in an oblong store on Trop and Pecos.  Decent space for seating.

e.  Extras - Nice salsa bar, although I had a hard time to ID what was spicy.  Soda Fountain and plenty of seating.

f.  Get ready for lines, and know that if you want buritto or a large taco, to stand at the main line.  However, if you wan other small tacos, they have three other lines where depending on you meat, there is a specific line for you.  So, there are actually 4 lines, but it is not easy to know this...

The first time, I had 2 gran tacos and a side of street corn.  The gran tacos are BIG, $3.50 each and fully loaded with cheese, meat, fresh pico, and avocado.  They are fantastic.  You pay $1.00 upcharge for seafood, which I did because I tried the shrimp.  They are loaded, in fact a couple of shrimp fell out and I still had shrimp in every bite.  The shrimp and carne asada are heavily seasoned, but not overly so.  The wife had shrimp and chicken, and I tried a bit of the chicken.  This may be the best flavored chicken I've ever had at a taco joint.  It had spice, but didn't turn my wife off, as she doesn't like heat as much as I do.  The street corn was fantastic, but messy.  So, I would recommend eating this while sitting down or next to a roll of paper towels.  

The salsa bar is maybe the best I've seen at a taco place.  8 different sauces, pickled veggies, and a pepper onion mix that they could sell for $3.00 and it would be a bargain.  You can really dress them how you like.  

I then tried a chorizo breakfast burrito (the next morning).  Probably the best breakfast burrito I've had in Las Vegas, which puts it in the running for best breakfast burrito I've ever had.  Only $3.99 and huge.  Packed with eggs, cheese, potatoes, meat and flavor.  The entire burrito was wrapped in foil which kept it piping hot.  I tried the bacon one on the next trip, but didn't like it as much.  Don't get me wrong, it was excellent, but the chorizo is where it's at breakfast wise.

And their elotes are ohhhh so good, it takes me back to afternoons in LA when we munch on those suckers after we pick up our son from school. Food is a solid 3 (although one time I mistakenly ordered the chicharon taco thinking it was going to be a crunch fest and all I got was fatty soggy pork skin, I was mortified but the gentleman who helped me put the crunchy chicharon I was expecting on top to make up for it) plus 1 star for the awesome and friendly people that work here.

I really like their salsa bar here...8 different salsas, beans, veggies, etc! Way more expansive than any other I have ran into so far, and it keeps it fun and interesting!

The tortillas are made fresh in house, and each meat comes with a different selection of toppings and salsa. If you want to avoid carbs, they do bowls as well, and if you want a bigger bite, burritos are available. The variety is incredible. 

I am a sucker for pastor with pineapple, so as soon as I saw that beauty spinning with a hunk of pineapple on top, I said, ""Give me two!""

Tripas, Pibil, Carne Asada Tacos
Al Pastor Vampiro

Now with two local locations, the first on East Tropicana with a larger and more upscale space in Henderson on South Eastern, Taco Y Taco is said by many to offer some of the best Mexican street food in all of Las Vegas, a Saturday lunch showing the original to offer a fairly good bargain as well.

Located in one of streets various retail centers, an elevated space with backdoor and dining room accessed by the parking lot while the counter at which one orders is best approached by foot from the street, Taco Y Taco is not the sort of place to splurge on décor or creature comforts, the focus squarely on the food and matter-of-fact customer service, an argument taking place on arrival as customer argued with the cook about why he could not add eggs to an item.

Featuring various ""Lines,"" though none really seemed to matter too much provided the order was straightforward and ready to go, it was with Chicharrons not yet available that a three Taco late, plus one ""Vampiro"" was assembled - the affirmative answer to ""with everything?"" adding cilantro, onions and housemade salsa with additional options for customization available at a tiny salsa bar.

Playing traditional music loudly overhead, soccer on the TV with the view out the windows facing a Plasma Donation Center, a look at the food shows a lot of time spent in preparing various meats from which the Pibil was tender, though slightly underflavored while the Carne Asada featured a robust bit of char to the tender beef with a slightly spicy linger.

Serving Beef Tripe from a small steamer basket, but happy to toss it back on the griddle when requested crispy, the Taco Tripa was undeniably unctuous with a good mix of crunch and creaminess playing well off the toppings while the crispy Tortilla griddled around melted Cheese and Pork Al Pastor was every bit deserving of the praise heaped upon it - the marinated meat almost sweet in beneath the exterior layer of caramelization and good enough that a second trip to the counter was justified for one more.

THREEE AND A HALF STARS:  Certainly no expert on Tacos or Street Food, but knowledgeable enough to know well made food and a deal, Taco Y Taco is a worthwhile stop for their signatures, though the under-seasoned Pibil and lack of a menu item at 11:00 show room for improvement.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,4,3,vd2J1IHn_EuiPr3zcDiiMQ

I found myself on the East side recently and stopped into this taqueria. Once I walked in I was shocked at how large and clean this place is. Usually taco shops in Vegas are dimly lot and kind of dirty. 

There are several different stations, all with different kinds of meats. TyT offered burritos, tacos, nachos, bowls, fries, and Mexican corn. The menu is much more limited than most taco shops around town, but I don't mind. Why do 50 things okay when you can do everything on the menu superbly? 

The Mexican street corn is a must! Fresh corn on the cob, lightly brushed with mayo, coated with cheese, and some spices. (It is not hot, just seasoning perfection!)

Next I ordered an al pastor taco and a lengua taco. Both were melt in your mouth goodness. The meat was perfectly seasoned and succulent. Tender and juicy. Topped with opinions and cilantro. 

Another stand out is the salsa bar. There are 8 salsas. All of which are tasty and fresh. Usually when I am at a Roberto's or the like, the salsa is just gross. Either red and fiery or green and watery and flavorless. There is a green creamy salsa here that is off the charts. No only are there the premium salsas, there are black beans and pinto beans, cucumbers, limes, the spicy carrots and onions, and grilled jalapeños and onions.

My sister and I dined here for under $12 combined. This place is cheap! Too cheap in my opinion, but I can't complain.

I mention this because there is a posted sign by where you order a burrito, in which any social media check-in gives a free elote.

The younger cashier understood the clearly marked sign and offered to deliver 2 rightfully earned elotes to our table.  I guess the cashier forgot, so we asked her about our corn, which she said she would bring right out after apologizing to us.  We overheard the kitchen staff loudly asking her in Spanish why two elotes were being given to us...

Pros:
1. Mexican street corn with cotija/mayo/chili powder is amazing here (not offered at Gordo)  
2. Vampiros, which is essentially a tostada sandwich and delicious and packed with meat. (2 of these will make you full)
3. Good selection at the salsa bar and extra veggies available.

Cons: 
1.  Tacos al pastor was way too salty
2.  Seemed pricier than tacos el gordo...either that or the cashier overcharged us

But I'm going to make an exception for Taco Taco, because this place is LEGIT.

The standard by which I judge all other tacos in Las Vegas is Tacos El Gordo, and specifically the adobada that they roast all day long on a spit.

Well, taco fans, I can tell you that the pastor here ranks right up there. It's a little bit less spicy and a little more cumin flavor than the pork at El Gordo. I can't say it's better than the best but it's right up there. And like El Gordo, they make their own tortillas fresh right behind the counter.

The pollo taco (an option absent from the TEG menu, incidentally) was flavorful as well, and the asada was savory and tender but the real standout was the soyrizo taco.

You heard me. Soyrizo.

Vegetarian options at Mexican restaurants typically make me feel like I'm missing something. But not with this. The flavorful, spicy fauxsage comes out topped with black beans - the perfect complement.

Best of all? You can pimp out your meal with your choice of eight salsas and two kinds of beans, plus jalapenos and cebollitas.

On the whole I'd describe Taco Taco as a hybrid of the authenticity of TEG and the attention to ingredients and health consciousness that you find at places like Zabas or Chipotle.

I don't often find myself on the east side these days but it's good to know an awesome taco spot is there when I do make it over.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,8,3,5,VcXNUHEOTTr0AkbASkqFuw

As for the food, I don't think you can go wrong. Ordering fresh chips (under 2$) to share with your table is never a bad idea! They're thick, crunchy, and help you taste test the entire salsa bar!

She steamed my chips with the cheese on it and the cheese became melty goodness. The guacamole was actual fresh guacamole. None of that nasty store bought guac.

 After a disappointing taco experience a week ago, I wanted to erase that memory with someplace better.  Taco y Taco definitely fit the bill.  Making last minute plans with the b/f and BFF, the three of us met up for dinner around 7:00pm on a Thursday night. 

MENU SUMMARY:
 Tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, elote (corn on the cob), fries, nachos, mulas, and vampiros.  I don't know what a mula is, but we found out that a vampiro is made up of two crispy tortillas with cheese and your choice of meat in the middle.
 The meats: al pastor, asada, pollo, tripas, carnitas, cesos, cabeza, lengua, trompa, suadero, buche, and chorizo.  Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese).  

 We were offered a sample of their al pastor when we first approached the counter; this is what it's supposed to taste like!  Whatever I had last week did not compare to this flavorful meat.  I ultimately opted for two asada tacos and the elote, Mexican street style.  Those choices cost less than $7.  There is a salsa bar available so you can jazz things up if you want, as well.  I had my tacos made simply, with onions, cilantro, and salsa and they were both delicious.  The mere fact that they offer elote alone will keep me coming back:  I love that stuff.  For $2, I got a very large ear of corn on a stick with everything, which means mayo (yes, mayo), cheese, and chili powder:  fabuloso!  
 The place is spacious and clean and the staff is very personable.  We stayed for over 2.5 hours, enjoying their food and our conversation.  Definitely look forward to another visit soon;  barato y delicioso!",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,6,8,4,kzWU4s-YxLrZxLEkv4K6-g

There are 3 different ordering stations, a cash register, and a condiment bar. At the ordering stations, meat is carved and prepared in whatever fashion you prefer (tacos, tostadas, fries, etc.). You can then head over to the cash register and possibly order an elotes (Mexican corn). The condiment bar features 6-8 sauces of varying spice levels, fresh radish, grilled onion, pickled onion and peppers, and white or black beans. That's pretty rad.

I usually get the tacos, elotes, and horchata. To be frank, I don't find any of their food all that amazing. It's pretty good but there's just something missing in terms of flavor. The tortillas aren't my favorite, the tripas is never crispy, among other things. However, the marriage between the al pastor and pineapple chunks is pretty on point. The horchata is sometimes too sweet/thick as well. The elotes looks bomb but is actually pretty bland.

A friend went there and said it was OK, but other places were better, so it wasn't on the priority list. Our favorite taco shop was closed last night, so we figured Taco y Taco was worth giving a try.

They were fairly busy when we walked in, as the fancily dressed manager lady was helping to maintain the dining area's appearance. 

We were greeted with smiles as we ordered our food. When I saw how they heated up the burrito tortillas, I knew I was going to have issues. I am not, and never have been, a fan of warming up tortillas in steam. This makes them sticky and gooey. 

Anyway, I made my burrito, and the wife had her burrito bowl made up before us. Looking at the menu, she wanted chips and guac.
Side of chips: 1.05
Side of Guac: 1.25
Chips & Guac: 2.95

WTF? So, she ordered a side of guac and I ordered a side of chips. Making our way down the line of taco options, we opted to just give one dish a try for the evening. When we were giving details of our order to the cashier, the wife said what her bowl was, and a side of guac. I gave info on my burrito plus a side of chips. The cashier gave us a smirk and said she was going to ring them up separate, since it is cheaper that way. We replied by informing her that's why we ordered it as we did.

The soda machine, for the one flavor the wife wanted, was broke, they were kind enough to just give her a bottled soda.

Sitting down to eat, the burrito was the length of a plastic fork (see photos) and had less circumference than a can of soda. 

Picking up my chicken burrito, it was already cold (partially due to the pile of sour cream I had included, I am sure). Oh well, I wasn't shied away by that fact. The stickiness of the tortilla was tough to get over. I prefer a crispy burrito to a soggy, sticky one.

Flavor-wise, it was good. Nothing to write home about, but it was good. 

Their chips were great. I don't know what they do different to them, but they were very tasty, nice crunch and fresh.

If the standard places we prefer to go are closed, or we just don't feel like driving that far, Taco y Taco may get a second chance. Otherwise, we'll stick with Baja Bar & Grill, Chipotle or Zabas.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,3,q3QAPOtKylviB6jhQW_ptg

They have separate lines for each thing that you want.  My husband and I split up and I get the tacos and he stands in a line for the rest of the items.

The guy making the al pastor tacos for me shaved off some meat from the spit, threw it on the grill for a bit, sprinkled a bit of juicy meat fats on it, then warmed up the fresh tortillas on the grill.  He shoveled all that porky goodness into the warm tortillas and topped it with cilantro (ewww), onions, a couple different sauces, and pineapple.  The pineapple is what takes it from yum to OMG.

If you're in a super-big hurry maybe go to TacoBell or something - this place is always busy, always fully-staffed...and usually a little slower than fast food. It's worth waiting for.

Hubby would walk a mile for the carnitas.
The Al Pastor and Asada are great, too.

Even more than Tacos El Gordo, which is a controversial opinion among my friends and colleagues. Taco y Taco tacos use higher quality meat, and their tacos are way less greasy than Tacos El Gordo, which is delicious but I feel the regret with every bite. Their al pastor tacos are to die for, and I could probably eat 10 of them in one sitting. Mexican street corn is also delicious and they cover it in a generous amount of cheese. Another big win for Taco y Taco is its large salsa bar, which includes a few different options to make sure your tacos are topped exactly how you want them. Service has always been friendly and prompt and I've appreciated the short waits I've had every time I've gone to eat here. The space on Tropicana is also very large, so finding a table is never a problem. They also have a really large selection of drinks including beer, horchata and soda.

Since Tacos el Gordo (one of the most popular) was a disappointment for me, I had given up half a year ago. IT's been a while, yeah. 

I think this place has hands down the BEST Al Pastor Tacos. OH MY GOSH. I don't even really like Al pastor tacos, and prefer carne asada, but it was a smashing hit for me here, surpassing the other tacos available. 

Al pastor tacos- 7/5 stars. 
Carne asada tacos- 4/5 stars. 
Shrimp tacos- 5/5 stars. 
Mexican hot cocoa- 2/5 stars. It was chunky, had strange bits in it, and it tasted almost like they used lard or a different type of fat instead of milk.

So I wanted to give this place a two because I read the reviews and was excited to try the place. I drive past it daily on my commute to and from work, so it was inevitable that I would try this place.

What anyone failed to me is that is a Mexican version of chipotle. So I am telling you. Yes, they have a salsa bar, yes they have more meat options. 

I tried the al pastor bowl and it was decent. I was slightly disappointed because it had mozzarella cheese instead of authentic Mexican cheese. 

We also tried a chicken burrito and it was good, solid eats. But nothing to rave about.

If you are in the mood for Mexican, then definitely try this place out. You just might love it. I just expected something else.

I probably would have been better off if I stuck with the tacos. I would go back just to try that but not sure anything else.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,4,3,3,qPgBlPOi4ZlmpeVujS5-cg

The restaurant was poppin!  How poppin was it?  We accidentally came in from the dining room area, saw the balloons at each table and the mariachi band performing before noticing this was the back end of the restaurant.  So we walked towards the line of people patiently waiting their turn to just order trying to find the end, and literally had to walk out the front door to wait behind a few customers that were out there at the official end of the line. That poppin!  By the time we got to the lines to order the tacos, it was almost 50 minutes later.  But the tacos were great, they didn't skimp or make it smaller, just So crazy packed and wildly successful!

I have to say that due to the massive crowd of customers that came out for $1 beer and tacos, if you were not already a pro at ordering different tacos at different stations, the ordering system can and was definitely confusing and frustrating for me.  A slip of paper to mark down what you want to order, so you can get exactly what you want without having to go wait in the back of the long line again to complete your order would have been helpful, especially on days of their super promotions.

But the tacos were tasty. Fair amount of protein on each one. I initially wanted 12 tacos, but only ended up order 7 and a Horchata, and I was full.  And the staff worked their butt off trying to make the fresh tortillas, cooking and grilling the meat fresh, and expertly assembling each tacos to order. Everyone in line can see how hard they worked and not a single person complained about the wait. 

The Al Pastor (Spicy Pork) is noticeably spicier than the other places, but so good. Maybe I was closer to feeling famished after an hour of waiting in line, or their grilled chicken tacos was just that good, but 3 of them quickly disappeared after I squeezed some fresh lime juice on it. 

Good food, good prices (even without their anniversary or National Taco Day promotion) and I know I will be making another trip to the other side of Las Vegas soon for some more great street tacos.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,11,9,4,OdvXlljNFgxABmdlDJvR2w

The setup is pretty straightforward, there's the taco lines, depending in what meat you want, and then there's the side where you order grande tacos, burritos and quesadillas. Ive never been tempted to try the burritos here, but I have gone thru the entire meat spectrum  their strong points are suadero and al pastor, and I felt their cabeza was a bit lacking. Their carnitas was a very welcome surprise due to the fact that there are a lot of places that don't do it right.   The dining room is pretty spacious if you're choosing to eat in, they have a TV. It's nothing special but it's great if you have a nice group of friends and you guys are just hanging out.

I was expecting a small hole in the wall of a restaurant, but it is a very nice building in a strip mall.  Very nice and clean place.

Now on to the food.  It's great.  I had the carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas taco and they were great.  My friend tried the tripas, chicharron, and not sure what the third taco was.  The chicharron taco was good, but very spicy, so spicy he was sweating.  The horchata is some of the best I have ever had, nice and creamy and not too sweet.  Good selections on salsas and beers on tap.  

After reading some other reviews, there is no way I'd rather eat at Chipotle than Taco y Taco.  A note on the lines.  There are 3 lines in the back and they are clearly marked as to what meats you can order in each line.  I have been to other taquerias that have the same set up, and I have never found it confusing but that's just me.  Just look at the monitors above the counters and see what meat is served in that line and move from line to line if you want different items.
