I always get a veggie patty sandwich, just like a previous reviewer, and when I went to this Subway on 4/7/12 they also did not have the veggie patty.
Get with it, Subway manager!!!!
Order more damn veggie patties and put them in the freezer!

I also don't understand why they charge extra to put avocado on my completely vegetable-based sandwich. I'm already skipping the meat AND the cheese...don't you think you could throw me a bit of avo? Hrrrrmmmmmph.

Other than that, food was fresh, made quickly. Sufficient to ward off starvation.",zWYQZxCQ_DTBSanR_GAk2g,0,0,2,-_PsgI_ElYg6NMRCdlCMIg

They always have a steady flow of customers so the food is fresh and hasnt been sitting out for long periods of time. At the hotel when u check-in they give u coupons that always have a 15% off Subway, plus u can use your BConnected points.",JZAcsMtcALSYw3YVVJ272w,5,4,4,MWNRCIqZqnz37DhN9KWVDQ

(However, the hotel gives out coupons these are the only coupons that they will take) Also has $5 foot longs un like other casinos in vegas. Free refills on soda (Pepsi). Open from 7am to 2am everyday. Breakfast only served from 7am to 11am. The most expansive sandwich was $9.25 for a footlong. There is no in room delivery. But they do have party trays. The subway is located in the food court located in the casino/hotel.",bTPSIPYTE05Y8TN_K9Wgaw,1,0,5,PFIdnarXGvT2AaCkdj7JJQ
3358823,2018-03-17,0,jV-p3USnEP9WwOGDgzkYTA,Went here around 10:15 am and as soon as we approached the counter we were greeted warmly. However as we went down the line of order more and more people started to form a long line. Poor employee was all by herself. She was definitely hustling and was very efficient even though she was under a lot of stress and pressure. The manager definitely needs to have more employees scheduled especially considering it's a holiday weekend. She was awesome!,G2nTzP5qoNUg880cE62oTA,0,0,5,CFb7pAtQwDktDbK5bFOX8Q
5985230,2011-08-24,0,jV-p3USnEP9WwOGDgzkYTA,Normal subway inside of the Orleans Casino. Standard breakfast sandwiches. Employees seemed a bit confused about the breakfast menu but overall I got what I wanted. No fresh made breakfast omelets like the Subway on the strip.,eectGb7-g_Xx7ftGqxr5bg,0,0,3,sm-6sdk8DUWCOMldD1GVsA
