WRONG. Then we decided to pick it up instead shortly after we placed the order and that's when I realized what had happened. When I called to see if the $70 order could possibly be cancelled, she laughed and said ""the other location is going to take care of it, but we already started the order."" (???) so she wanted me to go get the order from the Craig location AND pay for an order we would never get from the rainbow location.

It was only $1.50. So I could not care less. I believe my time is more important, but after reading the invoice I noticed that they charge you 8.25% tax, not 8.1% like our State mandates. Of course, tip is prompted in their site so I left $3 before I realized this mess!!

Guy: are u serious? U can't eat this!? It's perfectly fine!

My wife was craving a pastrami sandwich so I went to the restaurant and proceeded to order the pastrami with cheese, along with their Brother's sub and an order of garlic mozzarella bread.  We first tried the garlic bread and it was so bad that we ended up throwing most of it away....the cheese was cold and barely melted, and it was of poor quality and very cheap tasting.  The marinara sauce that accompanied the bread was flavorless.   The pastrami sandwich came with some fries but was bone dry and they did not give us any condiments like mustard or ketchup.  Honestly speaking, the footlong pastrami at Subway blows this sandwich away by a mile AND it's cheaper!!! 

I had the Brother's sub, which supposedly had chicken fingers, bacon, ranch, and something else.....but like the pastrami, it was dry as dry can be and very bland!! It was pretty skimpy for a sub and it was also overdone because parts of the sub roll were badly burnt!  The box that it came in was overfilled with fries as to give the impression that the sandwich had more weight to it....a trick easily spotted by savvy foodies!!! 

Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!! If I could give it negative stars, I would do so!

I ask her i've been there before isnt there some kind of special ?  she starts stating specials with wings, pizza and soda.   I told her all i am looking for is pizza.  she says that's all i have.  I walk in the place and there is a 1 item carryout for 7.99 on the door for a 16 inch which is a medium.  versus 18 inch large for 18 and change.  she never mentioned it and i told her when I got there and she still acts ignorant.  I hope you are the owner miss because that is the last time you got my business.   hope that $10 for extra 2 inches of the pizza was worth it.  she knew i wanted a 1 item pizza.  why not at least inform me about the 7.99 carryout?",o1fXOzXXj6zkbnCzJfwB6A,0,0,1,f97249V9vjany0E9UmES0Q

So I call and try to order. I wanted some sun dried tomatoes, as advertised on their menu, but I guess they ran out/lied/didn't feel like it. Whatevs, it's cool bro, just put mushrooms instead. Then he asks for method of payment- card. Ok, well there's a charge for this (I hate places that do that shit). So he then asks for my card number- wtf, why do you need this if I'm picking it up myself? I tell him, ""I'll just pay when I get there,"" and I guess at that point he just walked away from the phone for a minute.. then he comes back and demands ""Card number??!"" So I'm like, okay.. I'll play your game, silly man.. don't expect a tip, though. He says it'll be ready in an hour and I'm thinking, okay, this better be good 'cause we're freaking hungry and dying over here.

Upon arrival, I got to see who I was dealing with, but some other dude rang us up. Neither were particularly friendly. The guy said ""We have your card number in our system, but it wasn't rang up."" Da fuuuh? Seemed shady to me. 

Finally, onto the food itself. The calzone (family size) was enough to feed 3-4 people, so I'll give them that. But it was pretty void of cheese, thus wasn't worth the wait, drive or money. That, and it didn't make me feel too good. We also had an order of garlic fries, which were bland. We learned our lesson: check Yelp reviews first.

I placed an order through Grub Hub with the expected deliver time between 6:10 - 6:20 and my food arrived at 6:17. The prompt time and friendly delivery guy is the only reason that I did not two star Brothers Italian Bistro.

I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs that came with garlic bread and a salad. The spaghetti and meatballs had to be my order's only saving grace. 

Everything was very generic but what else was I expecting, Katie Mantalini's circa 1994? The salad was generic- lettuce, black olives, red onion and a few other things for color. The garlic bread reminded me of what was served in high school passing off as garlic bread. It was pretty harsh as I ended up cutting it instead of tearing it with my teeth. 

The spaghetti was ok, it was decent with a lot of cheese. The serving was large and it could feed two people for one meal or one person for two meals.

I have to say, I was impressed with the zucchini.  Seemed like the real deal, vs. the typical frozen mass produced products typically included with pizza delivery.

The wings were pretty par for the course.  Not burned...standard hot sauce & butter recipe.  Can't complain.

The wings came with fries, which we ended up throwing out.  Just thick and a little soggy.  Not a good delivery item.

Then he comes back and says that the only kind of shrimp they have is breaded shrimp and wanted to know if I wanted that on my pasta. I clearly did not want breaded shrimp alfredo and told him so. He then informed me that they did, in fact, have chicken after all. A whole case, in fact. So, I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo. 

We ordered mozzarella cheese sticks for an appetizer and waited about 30 minutes for them to arrive. After presenting us with our sticks, the owner comes over and gives us a plate of garlic knots 'on the house'. We soon found out that we got the 'on the house' knots because they had obviously wrongly made them for another order about 2 hours previously and didn't have anything else to do with them, so they gave them to us. Besides being cold and hard, the garlic knots were absolutely awful. The garlic was so powerful that it was spicy hot and overpowered everything else. 

On to the main dishes....eventually. It took over an hour for us to receive our main dishes. My mother-in-law got veal parmesan and the meat was overdone and completely awful. My husband got cheese tortellini and a side of italian sausage. The sausage was severely undercooked. My chicken alfredo was some of the most awful pasta I've had in my life. The noodles were super chewy and the chicken was dry as hell. 

No one ever asked us how our food was. Probably because they knew our answer would not be 'great, thank you.'. And if they didn't know, they didn't care. So, we paid our bill and went on our way. 

Post- dining experience... 
My whole family hung out in the bathroom (separately, of course) for quite a while after our trip to Brother's. If you don't want to suffer the same fate, pass on the Brother's dining experience.....",fb_nXRS-sPEM2Eg_yvPS0w,1,0,1,0qyQL2tYrcY6I2VOIu-qXQ
2250582,2010-08-19,14,h5qBxa_L-pIdNSOBQxTNGQ,"I swear I'm not on some demented mission to try every New York-style pizzeria in town then whine about the crust being, well, New York-style. This review shall be different! (Pinky swear.)

I live near Brothers, which until recently was Bella Lynda, which before that was Bella Lynda under different management, and before that it was Bella Sara. Although the names, decor, and menu have frequently changed over the past five years, one thing has not: the food.

But first, let's talk about the decor - what's with all of the maps of France juxtaposed with mob movie posters and a menu from a German Japanese restaurant? No, wait, don't answer, I don't want to use up my one phone-a-designer question on that. What I'd really like to know is what's with the pile of blankets overflowing near the back tables? Don't make me register ""Bistro or Yard Sale?"" dot com.

Snark aside, compliments first. The bald managerial guy? Extremely nice and clearly oriented to customer satisfaction. Guys behind the counter who gave us free garlic knots while we waited? Very hospitable and busy.

Delivery dude who kept aimlessly wandering around the front? A little odd.

Now let's talk about the red-headed woman, also seemingly a manager. The one sitting at the back table, leisurely reading what looked like credit card slips, surrounded by piles of small bills.

When we came in, she got up and gave us a brochure menu so we wouldn't have to squint at the tiny type on the back wall. Appreciated.

After about 20 seconds of us looking at the (multi-page) menu, she said she was going to sit back down. No problem. Mike was wary of the thin-crust pizza, but I spotted the ""Sicilian"" option of a thicker crust, so I decided to stick with pizza while he went down the block for Chinese. 

The woman hopped back up when he left - it had only been another 30 seconds - as I continued to study the menu. 

""What's your phone number?"" ""Um, why?""

She rolled her eyes. (Yes, she did.) ""So we can look you up next time you come in and give you discounts if you're a frequent customer."" All of this like I'm in 1st grade.

I gave her the number I use for these occasions and spelled out my first name. (Which she still spelled wrong as I saw later.) Of course, this prevented me from getting back to the crowded menu. So, imagine my annoyance when she finished typing and said, ""So, what do you want?"" 

I laughed lightly and told her I was still narrowing it down. ""Okay, what do you think you're narrowing it down to?"" 

I looked up, really surprised now by her impatience. I know some restaurant owners enjoy discussing the menu and being helpful, but she clearly just wanted me to hurry up. a curious attitude for a woman in any empty ""bistro.""

(More like a place that has nice tables to sit at while you wait for your takeaway box. If they want it to be more, maybe they should move those blankets.)

I said I'd like an extra-large mushroom pizza with a Sicilian crust and an order of garlic knots.

She started to punch it into the computer, repeating the order incorrectly. I corrected her. She spent a long time looking for the ""extra-large"" button on the screen. I noticed her photo in a frame on the counter. Okay, clearly an owner or manager, right? Goodness.

""Anything else?"" ""Garlic knots?"" I reminded her. She laboriously punched it in. ""You want the marinara sauce, right?"" ""What are my choices?"" ""The computer says ranch or marinara.""

Maybe I misjudged her role despite the cash table, the photo, and her motorcycle watch indicating she might have something to do with the few biker knickknacks, but ""the computer says"" says it all.

She let me know that there was an extra charge for the Sicilian crust because ""it's like they add a second dough to the crust."" I only mention this because of what happened when the order was ready.

One of the behind-the-counter guys came out with two pizzas and the garlic knots. ""Um, I only ordered one pizza,"" I smiled. (I always smile. Keeps me underestimated.) The guy said, ""No, you got a mushroom and a Sicilian."" ""Oh,"" I said, and... chose not to fight the battle. Besides, having corrected me, he was already walking away. Oh.

On the one hand, they just lost money and I wasn't getting a thick-crust mushroom pizza, but I also just wanted to leave.

Back home I opened the box to an XL mushroom with crust so thin you could see through it, and a large, fluffy cheese pizza. My husband helped me transfer the mushrooms over. 

How was it? Eh. The Sicilian's bottom crust was kind of hard, but the middle seemed only partially cooked. The quality of the cheese and mushrooms was fine, nothing special. The sauce was unremarkable but also inoffensive. The knots were smaller and harder than what we got while waiting and as greasy as the previous Bellas.

If you like your pizza ""thin and soppy,"" are getting carryout, and the redhead isn't on duty, you could do worse than trying Brothers. For me, the quest continues.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,9,5,2,l18cCZIas-30pzVNBZZJ9A

They never got our order from the app. So we tell them the order, address, name, go back & forth for awhile on the phone, they checked the emails on their end & still no good.

SO my boyfriend & his mom decided they wanted to go in person.  We know most of the late night staff there so I knew once they saw who it was that placed the order they would exactly who it was. Long story short, they walked in and were greeted with smiles and good spirits. They tried to hand my boyfriend & his mom the pizza for FREE!  That was nice, but it's a business they have to make money. She wouldn't have it,  she insisted she paid for it.  She can always fight the charges to the card, no biggie.

So they sat and re-ordered the food face to face this time.  They ordered Garlic knots while they waited, fountain drinks... HECK even the older gentlemen behind the counter that usually delivers, HE took his PERSONAL mobile phone out and handed it to my boyfriend's Mother talk to the manager. She was the card holder so she had the reason to speak with him. That really shows the trust relationship we have with them here.  Great customer service every time we step in the door we're greeted with smiles.  They felt really bad that it happened to us but it was not their fault.

They're great folks that work here, they're never rude to us, even on the phone they tried their best to help us out as best they could.  We're always polite and respectful customers. They show us the same respect.

Sicilian pizza takes longer because it's hand made. They had to bake the crust, and then load the toppings then cook it.  It came out MmMm good.  Light sauce, Black olives, Pepperoni, & BACON! Here's the picture of what was left I was so full off one slice!  Worth the wait. The portions here are large and you can't beat the prices.

I said no way, I expected at the very least to have those items credited in full for my next order.  At that point he asked me if I could hold so he could go talk to his boss again and said that he (boss) doesn't speak good English so he was going to be the go-between.  Ron came back and said that the $5 was all they were willing to do.  I told him not to bother and that was the last time I would give them a penny of my money.

3248258,2011-08-30,2,h5qBxa_L-pIdNSOBQxTNGQ,"As of a month or so ago this place has YET ANOTHER set of new owners. Over the years this place has been called Bella Sarah, Bella Lynda, Brothers Italian Bistro and has had at least five different sets of owners.

Being always keen for decent pizza I dropped in on the way home to pick up a pizza with pepperoni. The ""bistro"" is as unremarkable in appearance as it ever was, but the staff seemed fine and the pizza was ready reasonably promptly.

When I arrived home I opened my door and my hopes for my pizza sank before I had even opened the box. There, jammed into the door of my apartment complex which specifically prohibits trespass for the purposes of solicitation, was a menu from Brothers Italian Bistro - In my experience, the sorts of places who ignore the rules for free advertising NEVER provide quality food as they tend to be as ""cheap"" as the thought process that arrives at the conclusion that rules don't matter as long as they can personally or financially benefit.

Sure enough, my pizza was burnt on the outside, sloppy and wet in the middle, unevenly topped and generally tasteless. In fact, it was pretty much exactly like food has always tasted from this establishment. I'm starting to wonder if the ""new management"" thing is all a ruse to score some business from hopefuls who think the food might not suck anymore.

The following day I went down to the apartment office and gave them the menu and watched the manager phone brothers and read them the riot act about trespassing (as they do with anyone who spams us). A week or so later, there in my door again was the same menu. On my way to get the mail I ran into the maintenance staff to whom I complained bitterly about Brothers lack of respect for our complex and discovered that one of the maintenance guys had ""nearly gotten into a fight"" with their spammer who had claimed to be ""authorized to be there"" before being kicked out. The guys and I had a bit of a laugh and one of them hit the nail on the head ""Those guys have had so many owners over the years but the food has always been terrible"".

If you receive a menu from Brothers or any other pizza restaurant in your doorjamb, remember the lessons of this review and save yourself a lot of grief. Don't reward people too cheap to buy proper advertising who litter your home with their trash and don't trust in the integrity of their food.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,7,1,1,M5LV1pGVlF72Oq9sbsLnRA

It's because I rate places on what I expect them to be not what I wish they where.
So I find their cheesy menu flyer sitting on my door step. Hmmm so much for secured entry.
So I sit back and peruse the menu. First thought. Oh god, this place is a mess. They have over 100 menu items (no S#$T). You should get your food permit revoked for having a menu like that. These guys obviously skipped restaurant 101.
So I sit back and try to envision what this joint looks like. I'm thinking 2 triple door freezers, 2 deep fryers, Sysco orders coming in on pallets blah, blah, blah.
So being new to town and not knowing my way around yet and feeling lazy, I decide to order some wings (boneless & real).
What I expected to get was something reminiscent of those wings you see sitting in the hot case at the grocery store deli right before close. You know the ones that have been there for hours right next to the crusty mac n cheese. 

Well guess what...They nailed it! That's exactly what I got. So I give them the A-OK, three stars.

Yeah, this food is crap. I have no idea (yet) where this place is but, I can tell you this...I would have never made the effort to go into this place to eat and expected something good to come from it. Because I would have been in my car which would have afforded me other options (I'm assuming). Look at the menu for christ's sake. Use your head. You can't expect a (so called) restaurant to offer 100 things and expect them to do any of them well.

So I give my fellow yelpers that ate there and where disappointed 2 stars for using poor judgement. Come on...YOUR better than that!

We discovered Brothers Italian because of a flyer we had received on our doorstep and saw it was 24/7!! Score!! Italian food whatever time of the day?!? Yes please!

I have a cheat day once a week and for those of you who have the cheat days, we all know how magical this day is;) The menu stated linguine pasta with homemade white sauce, shrimp, clams and crab meat. When I got my food and opened it up, I was a bit shock to discover the IMITATION CRAB STICKS cut up. They couldn't cut those things up pretty enough to fool a great seafood lover. How on earth can they advertise crab meat and then turn around and throw imitation crab in the food?? The clams were not fresh and tasted like they opened up a can drained the juice and threw it in there. Seafood pasta?? Lets call it shrimp and Can Clam linguine...and call it a day.

4971116,2015-02-28,5,h5qBxa_L-pIdNSOBQxTNGQ,"I was staying at a hotel that apparently had very little security.  Every day when I returned to my room to retire for the evening, at least two pizza places had slide menus under my door, raising questions about the hotel's security and about marketing strategies in Vegas.  
This time it worked.  Drunk and hungry, I grabbed for the first menu that was under my door that day.  It happened to be ""Brothers Italian Bistro on Rainbow Rd.  

Good enough I says.

I don't have a microwave in my room, but I do have a very small mini fridge.  This comes into play in a moment.  

I saw the 30"" pizza and in my drunk state I was thinking that it must have been a type.  I don't know how much I had been drinking, but I decided to get a 30"" pepperoni pizza.  Also, the Combo Platter appetizer, and a 2 liter of diet Coke.
About 30 minutes later I get a call to my room that the order was downstairs.  The pizza box was enormous.  I guess they really do make 30"" pizza's!  Carefully balancing everything back to my room, nearly needing to tilt the pizza box sideways to get it through my door, I opened up the box of pizza.  I must confess, I was disappointed that it was cut into squares instead of the traditional method of slices.  It was only then did I realize my tactical error.  I knew that there was going to be a lot of leftovers.  I also knew that I had very limited space in my fridge.  I had not even managed to get to the combo platter and I knew I was in trouble.
I had about 5 slices of pizza and that was pieces in about a 3""x""3"" square.  Crap, there was a ton of pizza left!
I decided to let the pizza cool off, get some more beer, and then tackle what I could again later with the beer.
The next day I woke up hung over and saw this massive pizza box.  Opening it up, only 6 slices had been eaten, and now became the logistical nightmare of preserving the remaining pie.  I ended up folding it over a few times and cutting some of the slices up, and got most of it into the tiny fridge.  I never even got around to the combo platter the night before.
Long story short, I don't remember what the pizza taste like, I assume it was good.  I ended up not eating anything from the combo platter, that got tossed away.  I decided to eat one or two more cold pieces of pizza, and then decided to see how long it would take for all that pizza to spoil, so I unplugged the fridge and let nature take it's course on the rest of that pie.  
The last day I was in Vegas, four weeks later, I was cleaning up and packing up my belongings when it hit me that the pizza was still in the fridge.  
It still looked edible, but I didn't dare try a piece.

In conclusion, your marketing strategy worked once, but never again on me.  Also, you pizza rivals McDonald's french fries regarding longevity.",C_GBRfVHsZ1yYUeBRDanbw,1,1,3,8qA9vtcOKKMibaZ8IJnp2g

Medium spicy bbq Chicken wings I give a 2 of 5 stars the bbq sauce was a bit bland and was there wasn't anything about it that was spicy. The garlic parmesan wings were also 2 of 5 stars as well. Hardly any parmesan and garlic seasoning. Garlic fries was the same it seems all the seasoned fries were the only ones in the middle. As if they prepared the seasoning separately and just dumped it in the middle of their fries. Pretty much the only things I appreciate about this place was their website which was built well, their quick delivery service and that they are available late. So if you just want something to just fill you up they got some plain fries and wings that can do it. Unfortunately it's everything but their food that holds the weight of the stars.

Better the dominos but not Ny real pizza

Delivery charge was suppose to be 1.50 but they charged me 3.50 and did not tell me.  

Driver was nice , but the cost of the pie with delivery is not worth it.

Not only is the price good, but they didn't forget anything. Not even the forks, extra bread, nothing. It takes about an hour to deliver, but that's standard for delivery. I got the spaghetti lunch special. It came perfect. Needed a little extra sauce but no big deal. I also got the ceasar salad lunch special. Came perfect. And the chicken fingers lunch special, it's supposed to come with 3 strips. It's actually came with more than 3 so I'm super happy. They all came with drinks too so I think it's a steal. I called as well to see where my order was, the lady on the phone was super nice and the delivery guy was nice as well.",WiQHSpdBZksrc6jCvU6yXw,0,0,5,i64w4KQ-fEsmpkXId3Ndrw

I was getting tired of Pizza Hut and was trying new places for the wings. I decided to give them a shot for pickup because a couple of the Yelp posts said they were good. They exceeded my expectations:

7.99 carryout special - pretty good
20 wings - really crispy and great sauce
Garlic knots - too full to eat them

I went again tonight and got the big 26"" pizza. Boy, the kids freaked out and I'll say it was really good! It's like the bigger the pizza the better! I seriously plan to get the 30"" for the next birthday party.

I will certainly go here now instead of Pizza Hut. It's kind of pointless to get delivery because it's so close, but the people there were way nicer than what I expected. Maybe the people who got bad customer service are a little sensitive around guys or something. Who knows.",0XdkkaUeijk6UQ1wW2vO8g,0,0,5,lGSTzDnt7THq8YjYgua8YA

I was excited to try them out until I read the reviews and saw it was formerly Bella Lynda, which we ordered from once before and thought was pretty terrible. But, tired of ordering from the only other 3-4 places that deliver to Mountains Edge we took a chance. We had chicken wings, curly fries, I had spaghetti and meatballs and my hubby had veal parmesan. I have to say we were very pleased with everything. The meatballs were surprisingly very juicy and seasoned well. Veal was good. Portions extremely generous.

The delivery driver (young man) is great, friendly, social, makes us want to order from there again, however there is a tall 30-40 year old man that delivers for them as well. He is always talking on his cell phone, or listening to his ear plugs when he comes to our door. He does not say anything, he just shoves the food in the door and walks away. He delivered to us today and peeked his head in our side window 5 seconds after ringing the doorbell as we were heading toward the door. He again, did not say anything. We will NEVER order from here again. That is unacceptable behavior. Not to mention, the Philly Steak Sandwich had a burnt bun which ruined the sandwich. We ignored the low ratings for awhile since we experienced some good things from this company but after the behavior today, that is not going to happen.

Every time I call to place an order there is a new counter girl answering the phone and having a hard time understanding the order and getting it right. The last two times all
In the last week they've messed up major twice. The first time I ordered two chicken parm suns picked it up drove home to find two chicken philly subs nothing like what I ordered. Drove back explained their mistake though he says the ticket stated philly and I said well on the phone I ordered Parms and your counter girl entered philly. Regardless hard time and had to wait for correct order. The correct order was actually good and tasted great so I'll give them hat. 

Next order I ordered a philly cheese steak with steak and cheese only I pick it up it's loaded mayo veggies etc. return it state plain steak and cheese got a steak sub plain NO cheese ! So damn dry it was hard to choke it down. Again there is some barrier that's preventing them from getting the orders right. 

On a good note their white pizza is very good. It's always hot or miss here",grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,2,SeSC0DOmxTemoM_xGtPlBw

As I walked into the parlor I was impressed, the smell of the location eased my mind, I knew right then that I was going to have a great dinner. The first bite into a cheese pizza made my day. The cheese was great, sauce yummy and the crust was perfect, although it could have been a little crispier. 

I am so happy I was able to introduce my family to Brothers. It really reminds me of the pizza pies I would get in New Jersey. This will be a location that we frequent as we love pizza a ton!

Not cool with me, and it did startle me. to be fair though I did shake his hand to make up for slamming the door in his face when I didn't know who it was. I did say I was sorry.  He did stand.

5944985,2014-07-08,0,h5qBxa_L-pIdNSOBQxTNGQ,"Confusion in flavors I think for this place. 

I ordered meatball jalapeno pizza chicken wings italian soda and 2 desserts ( 1 apple and one brownie. ) 

The Pizza was done perfectly to my taste, you can tell the dough is home made or house made. The tear or texture in the crust you can just tell.I liked the sauce and everything maybe could use a dash of salt and pepper somewhere, just lacking a little of it. 

The chicken wings -- good cooked threw good taste. 

Know this is where the confusion sets in .. I think the dessert's might be store bought ? or partly store bought. 

The apple pie was frozen - leads me to think it was in a box. 

The brownie was hard to eat or not cooked at all -- the choc chips in the brownie where rock hard and or not cooked/ melted. 

The Italian Sodas -- either ice melted into the drink or something lacking flavor in it. Traditional Italian Sodas I have had either have sugar in it or something that has a kick to it. These where Really Really bland like when you have a 2 liter of coke cola that looses its carbonation flavor to it. 

I would recommend cutting your dessert menu in half and making items in house. choose 5 of your best sellers don't always over load a dessert menu. Choose taste of quanity",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,2,0,3,rEnzKI0khhnltVn54AxsoA
