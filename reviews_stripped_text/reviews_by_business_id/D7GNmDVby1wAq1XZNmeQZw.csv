Upon entering, we were greeted by the sweetest cashier. She was very welcoming and made some suggestions on what to order. They had a greek menu as well as burgers. I ended up getting a chicken kebob plate, with 6 huge chunks of chicken, a massive serving of rice, a cucumber/tomato/onion salad & a large piece of pita bread. Everything was perfectly seasoned. Only complaint is that there was no Siracha:( but they did have Louisiana hot. I also was able to try the fries - omgggggg amazing. They were crispy but soft on the inside! Served with ranch dressing. I can't wait to return!",bvzwsK8u5i0Kvvyfy7aT1Q,0,1,5,OWzipzpkXtboFozpaIMNqg

The burger was beefy and was topped with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, cheese, sauce (ketchup & mayo mixed i think), all on a sesame seed bun. The burger was good and I was starting to get full after eating it. The fries were decent and came in a big portion. The staff was friendly and received good customer service. I would have given a 5 star rating but I thought the burger was missing some flavor to it despite how beefy it was.",sbIScYNeTRLpgUr-We5fjg,1,0,4,inK4ZJQO9rQ2HONPo1eumw

The fries were cooked perfect and I had a chicken wrap that was delicious. We also had the chicken plate that came out good as well. Definitely going back.,PS8j7C-9Spi4J9ZHuZF60A,0,0,5,NmAu0F_B4FuBYz6jllKSCA

It's located in one of those stripped plazas that people normally don't pay attention to while driving on Fort Apache from Tropicana to Flamingo--so I can imagine most of their business comes from Yelpers. So each plate comes with salad, 2 kabobs with your meat of choice, a pita bread, grilled tomato & jalape単o, and your side of rice or fries, and a bottled drink (soda, Gatorade, sweet tea). I ordered the Lula Kabob Plate with fries. Man were there an abundant amount of fries! Was not able to finish the whole serving by myself, wish I could've split between half rice and half fries because a full portion of either of them is definitely way too filling by themselves! My pita was more on the burnt side and so was the grilled jalape単o, but I didn't miss that at all. Boy if you bite into that jalape単o thinking it's mildly spicy only like a stuffed jalape単o popper, you are most definitely wrong. I've learned that the hard way.",ooTnyvza14szGKWm3zKbAA,0,0,4,pIN6WkZ4exvtSVWjSDRBnA

If you are looking for good food at a reasonable price this is the place for you. See you next time!",wrHnU1k8f3fj5PNy3MgmhA,1,0,5,qNX_s33ojvoU7V1a_SOc0g
5993842,2018-05-03,0,D7GNmDVby1wAq1XZNmeQZw,This Mediterranean style grill just popped up in the neighborhood and I quickly heard about it from everyone as a place to go for good food. I had the lula kabob plate which was top notch but I really loved the salad. It was super tasty. I also bought and took some Tabuleh to go. I'm pretty sure I spelled that wrong. Go check it out. The owners are nice people and the food is delish so I'll be back.,OLd25x0N_CgF5053Iqs8xA,3,0,5,Vuq02j1EXe3VCbuIAafsvA
