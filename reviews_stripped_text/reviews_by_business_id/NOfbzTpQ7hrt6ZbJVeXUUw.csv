70805,2016-03-25,0,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"This place.. Let me just tell you about Loco Cantina. My group of friends were greeted by Danielle. She was Super sweet and sat us on the patio immediately at 630 PM. The atmosphere is beyond amazing. A great place to get together with friends. Our waitress Denise was constantly making sure everything was on point. The manager Shannon made her rounds as well, and I will have to say that the playlist she has made fire this place is pretty on point.

We got a few things: bean and cheese nachos w/ homemade guacamole, a shredded chicken burrito, a chorizo burrito, steak fajitas, and the churros. The nachos come in a cast iron skillet, loaded with poco and jalape√±os. The burritos were large, like straight from Mexico. They were stuffed full. The fajitas came with beans, rice, and 3 tortillas. More than enough. Lastly, the churros! They were warm, cream filled, drizzled with caramel, and came with a cup of vanilla ice cream.

There are a few negative comments on here about being charged for chips. You have to look at the fact that this place isn't even 3 weeks old yet. They can't just start handing out free stuff right off, they have to build a customer base. Pay the $3 for unlimited chips and salsa. They are even willing to give you some togo. Also saw something on here about small portions, and you must've been at the wrong place, because I was given so much food I thought I was going die.",xkr8r2LdfxvlgIB-IvDxdQ,0,0,5,k_BLmKcz77yQrILvbfAKWA

Service was slow.  Actual menu options were extremely limited.  Portions were very small, especially for the prices charged.  We ordered Guacamole and chips which didn't come until our food was served.  Food didn't taste bad, but, it wasn't great either and after a long wait, bad drinks and no real vibe at the place, we were done....hopefully they work on the concept and improve the drinks and menu or they will be gone.

137568,2016-05-06,1,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,Terrible service. Tried this place twice and doesn't seem like it will be getting better. I work here at town square and thought I would try this place for lunch but very rare do they ever answer the phone and when they do they place u on hold for about 10 minutes. I walked over to order in person and it's dead so don't know why I was on hold for so long. And when I came the other night with some friends we were ordering food and drinks and after every drink and food order the waitress kept bringing the check and kept trying to get us to leave! I mean there was about 6 of us we wanted to spend money! Oh well their loss. I don't recommend this place and at this rate I expect them to go out of business soon.,ZZFRqP1t11aFrPM5_ilyyQ,3,0,1,UGSNwRLznCLCBdFA6qPIwA

My party of 4 decided to try a new place and made a reservation knowing it was going to be busy due to it being cinco de mayo. So starters our outside patio reservation wasn't available, but since we did got there 20 mins before our reservation we sat inside and were told we would be moved to the patio once one becomes avail (at 7pm our reservation time). We sit down and start looking at our menus and 20 mins go by and still no waitress has come to us to greet us, so we flag down 1 waitress to ask who will be our server and she rudly replies ""it's not me, ask the hostess"" and runs to another table. The place was busy not not overly crowded with lots of tables were still avail..Irritated we sat there and finally 10 mins later we get a waitress to order our food/drinks and tells us that there's a 20 min wait for drinks at the bar (after 30 mins of sitting we now have to wait another 20 mins for drinks!!). We order our food and 20 mins later we get our chips & guacamole, burrito and I had nachos which was all actually really good, but we didn't get any napkins and trying to find someone to get some was a nightmare, finally we see a bus boy and he give us 3 napkins (for a party of 4)

 We sat at our table patiently waiting for our drinks knowing it was cinco de mayo and kept trying to give this place a 2nd chance to change our minds to just leave. So another 10 mins past and still no drinks and the place started to empty out a little and we only see 1 bartender behind the bar (on cinco de mayo).. . by now we are all irritated that it's been 1 hr into our night out and no drinks yet.  At this point we decide to cancel our drinks and get our check but trying to get someones attention was impossible!  Finally our waitress comes to our table with 2 pinkish drinks (we ordered 4) and apologized then tells us ""there is some confusion at the bar and we don't know which drink is which"" ..I ordered strawberry and my friend had peach, thankfully we didn't get charged for the drinks since they were wrong and missing half. We get our checks (we split them) and left elsewhere to enjoy the rest of our cinco de mayo. Then to top it off they charged the wrong check on the wrong card, it was only $14 but still frustrating!
 
Overall the food is good,but due to the horrible/slow service I won't back . We go to town square often to busier/more crowded locations and have never waited 1 hr for a drink!",DhMvxB9apRacIrBrqMfc9Q,0,0,1,_6-BROfRBEnIv7fpOx7d6w

285900,2016-05-06,0,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"We came in around 11 pm with four people in total. We were seated promptly and we ordered quickly as well: tacos and drinks. We received our tacos way before our drinks ever came. 

When our server Jessica finally brought our drinks, one of my friends drinks was forgotten and took about two reminders and 20 minutes later for the drink to finally arrive. We decided to order another round at some point and waited even longer. We watched her serve everyone around us their drinks, including people that had gotten there after us. 

Eventually we wanted to switch our drinks since ours had never arrived and she told us they were poured, and yet they were nowhere to be found. 

15-20 minutes later there were still no new drinks so we told her we wanted to cut the drinks since they were taking too long. About 10 minutes later she came back and asked us what drinks we had wanted. At that point we just asked for the check to which she said okay. Another 10 minutes later she brings us all the drinks we had ordered previously despite us asking for the check. Frustrated to where we considered walking out, we refused the round, no longer wanting to be here. We once again asked for the bill. 

She brought us the check and then took forever to come pick it back up; one of my friends takes our order up to the cashier to pay for it there. Food was great, but service was so abysmal we're leaving a 1 star review.

We understood it was Cinco de Mayo, but we think the lack of competence went beyond a bad night and was down to poor communication and training. On top of that - the music has no reason to be that loud where you're expecting people to talk.",He4xIPRXu8FEb0Luy57cbQ,0,0,1,Hj9gPLUPNmTpDpIdyxKvbg

One of the wait staff or managers came to our table with a child on her hip because she ""heard we were unhappy."" Uhhhh. What?! Who does that?? It started with the beverages.  Never a good sign. Took our server 20 min to bring drinks to the table - after we went looking for her and asked for them. Once we placed our order, food didn't start coming out until after we had been there for at least 45 minutes. Once the food started coming out - it came out two dishes at time about every 7-10 minutes. The server said the kitchen was backed up with only one cook in the kitchen. (Management later blamed the rookie server). When the food DID come out, half of it was cold. With a handful of dishes still missing, we spoke with the manager and decided to leave. At least the kids were able to eat and have a good time. It's a shame it went so badly. They have great potential. Great live music and a balcony with games for the whole family.

We ended up having to go the bar for the margaritas and were told the wine is being poured and will be brought out. 30 minutes later the waitress comes back to the table and asks where we got the drinks from and was annoyed that we got our own.

We ordered a carnitas torta (beautiful presentation) and a Pastor Taco. Here's the deal with tacos...they are STREET tacos...not CHIPOTLE tacos. lol So, yes, they are smaller! But they are supposed to be! They are delicious! I only ordered one but, after beer, chips and guac, and the loaded street taco I was totally full. If you know street tacos are too small for you-order something else. Their fajitas looked delicious- we want to order those next time! 

Lastly, we saw a chef walk through the bar and decided to compliment him on the food. Saul, the executive chef was so grateful, kind, and introduced himself. He took over the restaurant 2 weeks ago and is an absolute pleasure. He is from Tampico, Mexico. He knows what he is doing, was very professional and offered us a taste of the Tequila they infuse in house with pineapple, vanilla and cinnamon. SO unique and SO incredibly delicious. He told us he wants to bring Latin night to Loco Cantina. How fun!",KY-21X1lH2ixIHih8K7RmA,0,0,5,zUyhJ0PZHzpwc2dx18n2Lw

I eat out on a regular basis all around Las Vegas and this is by far, without a doubt, the WORST service I've ever had. Absolutely terrible. It took 10 minutes to be greeted by a server, another 10 minutes to put in appetizers, following that we ordered food and before we could order drinks our server walked away. 15 minutes after ordering appetizers, a server drops off of the appetizer, forgets the chips and salsa, and NEVER takes the drink order. Upon flagging another waitress down, we ask for a drink order and she says ""sorry there's only 2 serves and I don't have anything to write down your order with."" The food itself wasn't terrible but nothing exceptional and not worth returning. Drinks are WEAK! Servers are so rude and unprofessional. We never had a server return to the table after we got our food, not even once. The total dining experience took nearly 3 hours. We ended up just leaving cash on the table without ever getting our check and leaving. HORRIBLE!!!!! AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!",Ej2E_m_mX7InU7-6u7Y9Ag,1,0,1,ANnn72YKPYtaJ9_Fy9A30g

Service was slow. Our first waitress disappeared.bour new waitress was caring. Really showed interest.

The mixed drinks wee not tasty. Very disappointed.

Felt abandoned by the absence of staff but they were all new so it's totally cool and the environment kept me entertained!

Food came slow and portions were really small - at first. Main courses were filling!

That's really all.

Atmosphere was quiet tonight but it's also a Monday so take that into account. It's really critical to be understanding of a new  venue as which I am so I WILL come back and give them another spin.

952391,2017-01-27,0,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"Thanks to Groupon, my wife and I were able to take a lunch date to grab something to eat. The waitress assigned to our table only came twice. To asked us for our order and to leave the bill. Throughout our whole time there, she never came back to our table to ask if we need more refill or how was the food. Nothing. I had to get up once to ask for water to be brought to our table. When that didn't happen, I got up again and she saw me coming and tried to hurry up and get the water. She said she was just about to come to my table. Yeah, right. I had to wait five more minutes to get up again. When the bill came there was a tax charge on it. If any regular Groupon user such as myself knows, there are no tax fees. There is a contractual agreement between the business and Groupon. I told the waitress I refused to pay. She left the table to speak to the manager. When she came back she said I had to pay the fee. I asked for the manager to come to my table. The manager never showed up. I can see from the distance the waitress and the manager talking while looking my way. Once again, I got up from my table and before I uttered a word the manager said don't worry about the tax charge. I then explained to the manager that you are not supposed to charge any fees. The only thing you charge is the balance left over that the Groupon don't cover. They never offered any apologies for the experience.

The host and server were very accommodating, especially with the 2 kids. Kudos on the mini Etch-a-sketch to keep the kids busy. 

Quick tips: if you get the torta, skip the chips and salsa cuz you get that with the sandwich anyway. Also, if you have kids, the tables at this place are mostly bar height tables. We snagged the only regular height table in the place.",iMYz7rdyhma74hK6SyYQVg,0,0,4,ug5YD4Y8e-g_lNxIg6_z6g

The manager has to walk back over and take my order for her. After about a 10 minute wait (which was not a bad wait time) the manager walks my food out. Again, the bartender doesn't find me important enough to do her job. The manager handed me my food and I said sir I haven't paid yet. So he hands my card to the bartender. She continues to make a drink for the other person who was at the place. Mind you, it was me and two other people in the entire restaurant. I thought, okay finish making the drink that is fine. So she walks the drink over and then continues to take their order. When she finally comes back over to finally cash me out, she puts my card on the bar (doesn't hand me my card back) and gives me my receipt and says thank you smugly. I normally give a tip on bar service, but not today. IF YOU DONT LIKE YOUR JOB, GET A NEW ONE! The manager here really should reconsider who he has working for him.

1259588,2016-12-12,0,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"A group of five of us wandered in here on Sunday evening and the place was empty. We were worried but also up for a new food experience at Town Square.

The waitress was the only person we interacted while there, again because it was empty. She was wonderful, although she did not know the brand of their house wine and another minor inquiry. She was still helpful, attentive and pleasant. When we first sat down, she said, ""Should I get you some chips and salsa while you look over the menu?"" To me, at a Mexican restaurant, one might assume that they are free, but take note: Their chips and salsa are not. While they are bottomless once you order them, they are still $3. That was one of those eye rolling moments, but again, she was pleasant and helpful. Side note: Since we were mainly the only ones in there, they had some Sunday NFL games on (that we weren't watching) and the volume was very loud, with a speaker right near us. She kindly turned it down for us at a more enjoyable level.

The place was mostly clean and things seemed brand new. There is definitely a good drink selection and it seems as if their Happy Hour would have some good deals, although we had just missed that time frame. My wine pour was solid and how can you be mad about that?? (See photo!) Fountain drinks are also approx. $3.

Price range was bearable for what you were getting. The servings weren't daunting but most were hefty and certainly filling. There was a mix of foods at our table: Salad, Burger, quesadilla, Mexican fries (highly recommend), street tacos (3) platter choice and tamales. Pretty good representation of what they can do, I would imagine. Also, checking into Yelp (at the time of our visit) earned us dessert churros - definitely try!!!!!!

Additional food notes: 1) My tempura avocado street taco had ONE tempura avocado piece. A little disappointing, but it IS a small little street taco. Still, I was like, ""really?"" :D 2) I am a whimp when it comes to spice, but the salsa that you get in the ""chips and salsa"" has quite a kick, even for the average spicy enthusiast. 3) The chips are those flaky, buttery chips that you want to eat all in one sitting. 

All the food was tasty, warm and came out in a timely manner. I hope this place gets a sufficient chance, as Town Square restaurants near the movie courtyard seem to struggle.",74sdrfg2SFhH3kAslZjjrg,1,0,4,iMISEAVNns2ug4ElEHit-g

The dining room is very large with a huge center bar.  My fellow foodie and I always bring big appetites so we were ready.  

We started with the queso and chips.  It wasn't listed on their menu but the waitress suggested it.  The first few bites were good.  As the queso cooled it tasted more and more like velveeta.  It wouldn't be my choice of queso cheese but it did the job.  

For the entree I chose a Chicken Taco Salad.  The grilled chicken has a great seasoning.  The salad was pretty loaded with rice, black beans, monterrey, avocado and tortilla strips all in a fried tortilla bowl.  It was good but standard.  

L.C. used the Yelp check in offer for a free churro dessert.  That was probably the highlight for me.  Warm sticks covered in cinnamon & sugar and served with vanilla ice cream.  The caramel drizzle was also a nice compliment to the churro.

Not to my surprise, they were closed. The setting at Loco Cantina is that of a bar bistro, lots of chrome, brushed steel and wood. Very rustic. 

1-5 rairings:

ambiance - 5 I was allowed to pick my own seat and chose a booth close to the window. large leather seats that sit at a bar height. lights were low and the music was up just enough that you could still converse without yelling.

wait staff - 5 I was greeted at the door and conversed with my waitress about some of the menu itena, and a movie I was to see after dinner. I forget my waitresses name, but she was great and I really felt at home.

price of food - 4 $3.50 for a street taco is a bit high, perhaps a happy hour food menu would help

taste of food - 5 food was amazing. I had the ceviche and two tacos. this is a place I could spend $100 on myself just trying one of everything.

overall I highly recommend Loco Cantina if you're at town square.",VhFpC73FTGBCGW6SPg2RrQ,0,0,5,Qsyeogbf2Q8LbpkvolmHXw

I'm kinda a street corn snob and not easily pleased but I might of just found my new local go to! The guacamole was huge- overflowing and fresh! We split a tortilla soup but it was good enough I could of had a bowl to myself! Spicy and full of beans and meat. Very pretty presentation. The street tacos are sold per taco- nice so you can get a full belly and not have to just have one flavor. Finished off with churro and vanilla ice cream with caramel.

The atmosphere looked great, plenty of outdoor seating looking over Town Square, so we decided to check it out. 
We walked in and were seated for an early dinner. Only two other tables were filled. 
We asked our waitress about a few of the menu selections. We ordered a margarita and sangria. If you like canned pineapple, then definitely get the sangria. There were a few thin lime slices and chunk pineapple Very surprised it was not fresh. 
 We ordered guacamole as an appetizer. Not sure if it was canned, but definitely a mix, not homemade. It had that whipped appearance and feeling. 
 We also ordered chips & salsa but never got them. I did like their chips, they were also served warm. 
Next was the nachos.  If you like ballpark canned cheese, I recommend getting the nachos, Chips topped with some black beans, a little bit of diced tomato, smothered in canned cheese, some sour cream and a dollop of guac. It's best to eat them with a fork, which we also had to ask for silverware too. 
The tacos we ordered were good. 
As for the ceviche - two or three boiled shrimp, chopped up with some avocado, cucumber, tomato and lime juice. It appeared to be thrown together quickly and served luke warm instead of chilled in the same type bowl as the guacamole. Did not look like the pictures posted on Yelp. 
I was really looking forward to trying this place out and liking it. With a great atmosphere, its just not enough to make me want to go back.",Zb2T6JhcBGzgc6RWmldbDg,3,1,2,437O8HWxcSgYRwQ0BGTQaA

Planned on staying for a bite but the server never returned. Decided to leave and actually just left enough cash for the drinks and a tip on the table.

I came here after the AFAN Aids Walk in hopes to avoid traffic and fix that rumble in my tummy, so why not try a new place? Loco Cantina is the new spot located in the ""The Real Housewives of Las Vegas"" holy land, that is Town Square. To be fair the food isn't bad, but don't come here looking for an authentic Mexican food meal. 

My fianc√© and I went with the Queso Fundido, two tacos, and the steak fajitas. The Queso Fundido was actually really good, but what's not to love about, chorizo, peppers, pickled onions and what seemed like a vat of three melted cheeses. Seriously, I think the dish, the cheese came in, was about two inches deep and three inches wide. We never saw the bottom of the bowl. 

The Pastor and Barbacoa tacos were street style size and came on store bought tortillas, which is a huge bummer for me, but the Pastor meat was seasoned nicely and was very tender.  The Barbacoa was ok, it needed some spice and maybe salt, it was pretty much like eating plain meat with pickled veggies. Tortillas for any Mexican style restaurant should always be handmade or at the least locally made and sent over. The Steak Fajitas, like the Barbacoa, just needed more seasoning and salt, not much really going on here. 

The service was great and it was nice to sit in the patio and people watch, but these two factors are not enough for me come back.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,21,15,3,LBVfc4ZbmYaqfhmY1SgtwA

1. Time of serving. We went over there at 11.10. Made main orders and appetizers, and .... we were waiting for more than 20 minutes to get our chips... Seriously ?    20 minutes ? That's more than enough time to go to a Wholefoods buy chips there, come back to that ""restaurant"" and serve it to myself. The main dishes came at 11.50, 40 minutes after we went inside. 

When we were done eating our food, we were waiting for more than 10 minutes to get our receipts, than they forgot to take cards from some people, and we were waiting extra 15 minutes.

I don't know about the owner perception of time, but for me and other people  - time is  more than important, and i don't like spending  it on waiting for something because of the BAD SERVICE.

2. Food. The menu doesn't describe food very well, just a general information, and it's pretty hard to know what you are ordering.
Taste of food in general just ok, nothing special, except size of tacos, that ""restaurant"" invented a new type of tacos -  babe tacos, the smallest tacos what i tried in my life.

3. Prices. Babe tacos for 3.5. Well those numbers speak for itself. If you want to waste your money, better do some charity and don't encourage those "" businessman"" to open more places like ""Loco Cantina""",TYRs85eKiMAVr0Bd7fAzrQ,5,1,1,8zWN3NF9NKUge7xu0iSbmw

3656404,2016-02-16,0,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"Was craving some mexican food and heard this new place had opened about a week ago in town square. Went with a group of seven on a Monday night.

Atmosphere:
It was a nice night and they had kind of an indoor/outdoor setting. I loved it! I thought the music was up beat and fit well to the ambiance they were trying to create. Also had karoke which I enjoyed. 

Food:
I thought the overall quality and taste of the food was great but was a little dissapointed with the price in comparison to the portion. This restaurant strikes me as a place that would do well serving drinks and appetizers before or after a night out. Shrimp fajitas were $16 and I got 3 flour tortillas to eat about 10 shrimp. Would think that more of an $8-$10 entree. Highly recommended the fiesta lemonade and senorita for drinks.

Service:
5 star service, our server was very personable and you could tell she was a true people person. Also very accomodating when one member of our group was not satisfied with their drink. Service was prompt and the manager came to speak to us a few times which was a nice touch. 

Overall: 
Happy with the service, drinks, taste of food and the atmosphere. Prices could be lower for portion sizes but I will definitely be coming back for a late night drink and appetizer.",wgNVYGx-TfNIohLrLMoPxQ,1,0,4,x9XkgJuw1efxBaF8KbP58A

So my bf and I got some waters because it was hot out.. took a bit to get though. I ordered a carne asada Taco and he ordered a chicken burrito, we also got chips and salsa. So my $3.50 taco was literally a small, one piece of dry tortilla with a little bit of meat and a tiny pinch of cilantro maybe a piece of chopped onion or two. It was so small and flat and not even good looking. When the waitress brought it to me I looked at it and with my apparently shocked reaction looked at her and I feel like she felt bad for even handing me that poor put together taco. I added a picture of it on the plate which is a very small almost like appetizer size plate. So we got another round of chips and salsa.. which the salsa isn't anything special either, tastes like they scooped it out of a can from the store. And a little later finally out came that burrito.. it took soo long for my bf to get his burrito, maybe 20-25 mins. So his chicken burrito.. At least it had some chicken but the only taste that was very obvious was avocado and sour cream, not sure if there was even anything else in there besides few pieces of chicken. While he ate his burrito there were two older women that walked in and sat down. They were there for a while and got mad and left because no one paid them any attention (we can hear them as they were at the table behind us). I should mention there were only 2 waitresses, but at the same time it was quiet and again only like 4-5 ppl in there. Oh and the whole time since we walked in there was a guy sitting by the bar (guessing he worked there) since he was sitting by the entrance we kept seeing the waitresses come out from but he just sat there the entire time we were there. Which seemed to be a while since it all took so long. At the bar there was one bartender who seemed extremely bored and was on her phone, that's it not doing anything else.

4219844,2017-04-02,3,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"Not gonna lie, Loco Cantina was one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've had in a very long time. While the food runner was lovely, helpful woman, everything else, from our waitress to the food to the drinks, was awful. 

1. The waitress didn't know anything about Mexican food. When asked whether the barbacoa was authentic, she replied with, ""I don't even know what that means. Compared to what?""

2. Drinks. We ordered the happy hour margaritas, and the first round was very weak and tasted like soda water. We sent the drinks back, and the second round was VERY different - stronger, but too sweet and sour. I got a stomach ache from the strong mixer. 

3. The food. Three of us ordered the taco combination plates, while one of us ordered the shrimp fajitas. The shrimp fajitas were burn, with the onion and pepper almost inedible. The tacos were also disappointing - the shrimp tacos, for example, only came with ONE shrimp. The waitress said this is typical, but it seems outrageous for a taco to have one shrimp? Then, insult to injury, the rice and beans were severely under seasoned. 

All in all, I wouldn't recommend this spot to my arch nemesis, much less bring a friend over. Move along, there's so much great food in Vegas, don't waste your time at Loco Cantina.",7SwaA1_rt4OkMlMxYpRYGA,4,2,1,f0GGveq5rzxG15pWbQ_TTA

The restaurant is fairly large inside, located on the second floor at Town Square and just down the hall from Blue Martini. For a weekday lunch the restaurant was nearly empty.

We started with Queso and Chips. The chips were not the traditional chips, but I liked them. The queso was pretty good too. 

My main entree was the Taco Trio and a side of Mexican Street Corn. I liked that there were several options for tacos choices. All of the tacos I chose were delicious. The rice and beans on the side were okay. I loved the flavor of the sweet and juicy corn. The only thing that would have made it better was if it had been served off the cob. 

For dessert we shared the Yelp check in offer of Churros. There were three crispy churros with a lovely caramel drizzle and ice cream on the side. I enjoyed this sweet ending to the meal. 

The service wasn't horrible, but it wasn't overly attentive either. The restaurant was pretty empty, but it seemed like service was a bit on the slow side. I was enjoying my company and chatting, but if I had been with my husband he would have been getting impatient. 

Overall, not a bad choice for some Mexican food if shopping at Town Square, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,0,3,A1fI2Jq1dAbmFolX4QarvA

4384959,2016-05-06,1,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"Absolutely worst experience ever. 

My girlfriend, her co-worker, and I went during lunch on Cinco De Mayo--it was not busy at all. Our server, Jessica, said she started 5 days ago. We ordered waters and chips and salsa. Jessica brings out our chips and salsa and forgets our water. She apologizes and leaves but never comes back with the waters. The salsa was incredibly spicy and my mouth was burning but I didn't have any water to wash it down. About 10-15 minutes goes by and still no waters so we go up to the bartender and ask for them to which we see our server giving other people water. She walks over to us and hands us 4 waters when there are 3 of us.

I get the chicken burrito and it had shredded chicken (tasted awful) and was below average at best. It was literally drenched in a spicy butter and it kept leaking down the side of my hand and it created a puddle of oil on my plate. 

My girlfriend's coworker orders a vegetarian taco on FLOUR tortilla but she receives some roasted bell peppers on a CORN tortilla w/ some salsa on it. Flustered, she said she came here a few days ago and ordered the same thing and it had other stuff on it. She went to the bartender to ask if they can re-make it for her and they got it correct the second time. 

We wanted more chips and salsa but she forgot it TWICE. Between getting the waters, the food, the refill on chips/salsa, napkins, utensils etc. it probably took about 10 minutes or more in between each request. Also, with three of us being there.. she brought us 4 waters & 5 sets of utensils. Jessica must have apologized to us 15 times and almost every time she came back with something she would just apologize constantly.

The music was incredibly loud and it was hard to hear each other talking when we were sitting pretty close to each other. It was a really windy day and the server set down the first order of chips and salsa and it immediately started to take flight. We needed a copy of our receipt to redeem reward points and we had to wait another 10 minutes for the manager to print it out to us. He explained that he couldn't print it out for us because it is too complicated on their system but he Xerox copied it for us on an 8.5x11 piece of copier paper. Furthermore, after we explained everything to the manager, he did not mention anything about Jessica's performance rather he gave us an excuse as to why it is annoying printing out a copy of our receipt and the only other thing he said was ""sorry, next time, I'll make your food for you so there isn't any issues....""

All in all, between Jessica forgetting our waters, not refilling, forgetting our utensils, having us ask multiple times for some chips and salsa, waiting way too long for our food, waiting way too long between requests, waiting about 15 minutes to receive our check after we asked, and another 10 minutes to get our 15% off from the coupon we had, and our food tasting horribly, I would not recommend this place to anyone; just go to Robertos.",L81XheMK8cTbA5fa6KuGTQ,3,1,1,Fk0drf1f65K9k7WzVm8Hsw
4425034,2017-09-04,0,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"I came here on Taco Tuesday and was very pleased with the service as well as the food. Taco Tuesday means all tacos are $2 only. I lost control and ordered 6 tacos all for myself. I got 3 shrimp tacos, 2 tempura avocado tacos and 1 pastor taco. My favorite out of the three is the shrimp taco. There's a light batter on the shrimp, it is then topped with a slaw and jalape√±o. The pastor was very good as well. It was topped with some diced pineapples and sweet pickled onions. The tortilla had a nice crisp on the outside. The chips were warm and fresh. Probably one of the tastiest chips and salsa I've ever had. 

A 16oz Modelo was only $5. There is a lack of beer options at this restaurant. I wish they had more IPAs and perhaps other local beers on draft. 

Our server Kelsey was very sweet and accommodating. We were on a business trip and needed separate checks and she took care of that. She was very efficient and had a great sense of humor.

4433776,2017-04-17,0,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"Yesterday afternoon(Easter Sunday), a friend and I happen to be at Town Square Las Vegas. We  went to see a movie at AMC Movie Theater and later did some shopping at a few of the retail stores there. Around 6pm in the evening her and I were starting to get a little hungry. We were debating on Italian or Mexican food, when we came across a sign that said ""Loco Cantina."" Neither she nor I had ever been to this restaurant before, so we took the escalator right on up to ""Loco Cantina."" As soon as we enter the establishment, we were greeted by a young lady by the name of Mariah, who happened to be the bartender too. She welcomed us to LC with a warm friendly greeting & smile and said that we could choose any table seating that we wished. We chose a table on the patio with a great view of the mall scenery. I might add that the music and atmosphere of ""Loco Cantina"" was very relaxed and enjoyable too!!!

Immediately after we sat down, another young lady introduced herself as our Food Server and her name was Tiana. She was also very friendly as she brought our menus to the table along with the Happy Hour menu. I believe Happy Hour was from 3pm to 7pm. She asked if we wanted to start off with some drinks and appetizers. Her demeanor was very relaxed and genuine while remaining very professional throughout our dining experience(never rushed). We ordered our beverages and Chicken Taquitos(they came with 3 tasty deep fried taquito rolls on a bed of dark green shredded lettuce with white cheese on top & were on the happy hour special $5). My friend said she was dying for some of the Queso Fundido which went quite well with chips and salsa that was brought by a very friendly Food Runner by the name of Oscar. I must admit that our dining experience was only enhanced by the fact the food runner was not only engaging, but very knowledgeable about the entire menu, as was Tiana, our food server. They both gave us a few of their favorites suggestions for us to choose for our main courses. We noticed that Oscar and Tiana did check backs on our table and each table around us often, to make sure we were all satisfied. Tiana did an amazing job at keeping our glasses filled. They never went low because she was on top of things, but never too intrusive, which we loved!!! 

I must mention that the Queso Fundido had a nice spicy kick to it, but not that strong that it would be overwhelming to your taste buds. It was just right!!! For our main courses, we ordered the Taco Combination Platter. The platter comes with 3 tacos of your choice, along with Mexican red rice and black beans. The rice was delicious and it was not over cooked nor under cooked! Just the way I like my rice(perfection)!!! We ordered 2 carne asada steak tacos and took Oscar's suggestion on the Barbacoa Taco. The reviews are in and my friend and I both loved the Barbacoa Taco the best out of the 3 tacos. When we come back for tacos on the Taco Tuesday Special of each for $2 we both will order our favorite ""YEAH BARBACOA!""  We also ordered 1 Steak  Burrito that was filled with plenty of meat, cheese, rice & black beans and pico de gallo. We truly were stuffed. We could not finish the other half of the burrito so we ask for a ""To Go"" container, because we had to try dessert since this was our first time at this restaurant. Tiana suggested her favorite dessert there, which was the UNFRIED ICE CREAM. When I tell you this dessert was incredibly delicious it truly was!!!! Tiana used very descriptive words when she described this dessert. It has a nice tasty cornflake outter crust that covers the entire circumference of the ice cream that is topped off with a very generous amount of caramel all over. Had we not like any of the food mentioned above, the dessert alone would make us come back for it. We will most definitely be back again very soon for either a cocktail,an appetizer, Happy Hour, main course selections, the Unfried Ice Cream, great customer service, The Night Club/Hookah Lounge that we were also told they have on different nights until about  3am/4am in the mornings! 

Thank you Loco Cantina's back of the house staff too, including cooks and chef for making our meals very pleasing to the eyes and tasty for our taste buds! :) Management thank you for doing such a great job at finding/training such great staff like Tiana, Oscar and Mariah!!! Restrooms were also very clean too! Again, we will be back very soon and we will spread the word to our family and friends about this great place we found called Loco Cantina on Easter Sunday 4/16/2017!!!",9tdhgPzTOPhGnB9oa09YFg,0,1,5,FJ4JGBqxaXgPspjYWYzaGA

The place had maybe 20 people inside and it was not busy. We were seated immediately and asked for the patio. Greeted by a server and told us she would be right back. 10 mins later she's asked us for our drink order. We both order a signature drink each which take another 10 mins. The drinks were very weak. I tried to order food but the server walked away immediately after leaving our drinks. Then we sat on the patio for 20 mins waiting for anyone to come by for our order.

The biggest issue is service, the place is always empty so it makes no sense why service is so terrible. Couple times I've joined friends already there and the server doesn't even notice new people at the table. After waiting a good 10min, server finally comes but only asks one person if they need anything instead of going around the table or even looking up to see if anyone else needs anything and then walks off. Only for me to shout or chase them down saying I want to order. Server never comes back to see if food or anything is alright. With the place so empty and slow you can see the server just standing around, doing nothing.lol When it comes to getting the check, your best to ask for it once you order the food, otherwise they will never bring it or even come by asking. It's always a hassle trying to get the check and when the check comes, there's always some kind of issue, overcharge for an item or something on it I never ordered. Place has potential, but right now it's a complete joke until they can change their service. I'd rather go to Tacos and Beers on Paradise for taco Tuesdays where the atmosphere is amazing, has great beats (and can still hear ppl), and great service! Tacos are $3, but I'll pay the extra dollar for all of that! Plus you get chips and salsa.lol score!haha",ppOaWkPJ4a8SZPGxOHALUw,0,0,1,OWQ2GMrpsIc0NeZ24YKtZw

The staff have all been warm and friendly not to mention Jasmine remembered us and acknowledge this.  I highly recommend this place no matter if you come during Happy Hour, on Taco Tuesday or just anytime.

They have several tv's around the place and the decor is very cool. Most people never look up when they go to a place or if they do they really don't notice the unique decor places have.

After seating myself, a nice waitress handed me regular menus... I said ""isn't it happy hour?""... She said ""yeah"" and then went to grab me hh menus... Another waitress came about 10mins later and i had to ask for chips and salsa... About 15mins later that same waitress came to take our order... My friend said ""I'll order chips and salsa""... That's when the waitress realized she never brought ours to the table... We ordered a shrimp taco, cheese nachos from the extremely limited hh menu, loco rita hh drink and Mexican corn. Chips and salsa finally came, chips were good, green salsa was slimy and bland, the red tasted like tomato paste... Terrible. The happy hour drink ""loco rita""  was so watered down, it was offensive... The nachos weren't too bad but the chip to cheese ratio was so off... I had 75% chips left with no cheese... Disappointing. The Mexican corn which was way over priced and tasted like canned corn and the chipotle mayo they used was terrible... Zero seasoning, no lime, the mayo was overpowering. I'm Black and I can make better Mexican corn. This place is not even close to authentic. Another waitress started waiting on us at this point.

I usually get upset at having to pay for those but this set up really is to eat tacos and drink so it makes sense ... our family has issues with chunky salsa so we really liked it ..

I can't wait to come back and try the guacamole.. I was so full by the time our food came I only had room for my shrimp taco which was pretty good but my favorite was the carnitas torta it was delicious ..

Our service only improved after another table that our waitress was servicing complained to the manager about their equally poor service.  After that, service was better, but our server still messed up a drink order.  

Food was pretty good overall.  We got a couple orders of the queso fundido and guacamole.  The first order of queso was really good and horded my certain members of our group.  The second order came out really bad - a half inch layer of grease on the top.  The manager was very kind to return this one and replace it with another order.  The guacamole was also pretty good, but basic.  Entree wise, I think their menu is very limited, and they should really advertise that their tacos are street taco size.  I ordered a chicken taco, fried shrimp taco, and a side of rice and beans.  The flavor of both tacos was pretty good, although there was gristle in my chicken taco, and there was like only 1 shrimp in my shrimp taco.  The rice and beans I would pass up on next time - no flavor at all.  My husband and one of our friends had also gotten chicken tacos - and found bones in their tacos.  

Lastly, because it was for a birthday, the manager did provide banana lumpia for dessert.  This was pretty good - caramel flavor, crisp shell, and a side of ice cream.  This too was horded by certain members of our party.

This place is for tasty small portion meals and a whole lot of booze!  It looks like it would be a perfect place to have a birthday party or get together - plenty of open space!

5422245,2016-02-15,2,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"This place probably won't last very long if they don't fix their issues. I'll start off with the bad:

1. Chips and salsa are 3 bucks. Also, the salsa was in a tube. They don't give you a bowl to dip it in or anything. Not sure if they expect you to put it on every chip one by one or what but it's probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Also, it doesn't say if refills are free so we didn't wanna chance it with getting more chips. 

2. The tacos are TINY. Probably the worst size taco I've ever seen and they're $3.50. Taste was whatever and they were somewhat cold. I can't believe they charge $3.50 for those things. 

3. The fajitas are also tiny. They're $14 and they give you for 4 corn tortillas to eat them all. They charge and extra $2.75 for rice and another $2.75 if you want beans. Crazy. 

The good:

1. Service was good. We got everything fast and our server was super nice. 

2. The chorizo fries tasted good but they were more like chili cheese fries.

Overall:

I just can't get over the prices and the portions. Their food isn't good enough to charge what they charge. And the fact that they don't give free chips or serve salsa in a bowl is unacceptable for a Mexican restaurant.",ZpVkd0ZI5iEq3C9ndawuZw,2,1,2,GP7v9y0JpMnS6Z7SPp38uA

However, biggest issue is service. Beyond slow and constantly having to flag someone down to bring forgotten items. Just trying to get your check so you can leave took forever.

The place is really slow so I don't understand the slow service. It has to be a management issue. Music is also way too loud. I like to talk to the people I'm dining with.

5535810,2017-05-21,0,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"Last meal in Las Vegas, after a week long vacation could not have been at a worst place. We were drawn in by the nice upstairs patio. The place has a good location with nice wrap around upstairs patio. We were a little surprised by how empty it was on a saturday night, but by the time we left it had become obvious why this place was basically dead. There were about 10 tables, all outside, with about 40-50 guest total. I counted no less than 5 servers... a bartender... and atleast one manager maybe two. Our server who lacked any kind of outgoing friendly charm, took our orders, a nacho(best thing ordered), a veggie burrito(ok kind of bland), chicken flauts(extremely dry meat), a ""loco"" salad(which came without any salad dressing which seemed to be par for the course as the four top beside us all got salads... that all came out without dressing) and some tacos(ranging from bland to ok... the short rib barbacoa was my favorite) and a chips & salsa(not complementary, but an order... that came out the same time as our food, so we just sent it back). We all got various drinks everyone liked.

So the food was ok at best and drink were good...

The service was easly the worst I've had in a long time. We were all pretty hungry, we ordered the chips & salsa to snack on... to bad they came out with the rest of our order(by which point all our waters were empty and drinks mostly gone). Our server could have fixed that had she ever came back to the table after taking our orders. I went inside to ask if our server could come by the table... 5 minutes later i had to go back inside and talk to her directly that none of us had anything to drink and a salad with no dressing... which they finally brought out about 7-10 minutes after the salad hit the table. Maybe they only have one kind of dressing? If so fine... if not who would know, they just brought one out without asking for a preference. It was sweet and tasted like Italian and didn't really complent the salad very well. 

After we had enough. We sat there another 10 mintues hoping this server would come back... she did not. I had to go back inside to pay the bill. I asked her if we could pay... ""I'll be out there in a minute"" she says with a trey full of drinks in her hands... i handed her my card.

She apologized repeatedly. She set down the drinks, went in the BoH and found her manager, who came out to comp several items on our bill but then quickly went back to the rock he had been hiding under. She again apologized emphatically and suggested that she had a ""huge"" party, again this place was dead. They had enough staff. 

In the end, the poor service was a product of a manager who couldn't give less of a fuck, setting a nonexistent example for a staff of neophyte girls with little to none experience of quality service. If your comping food off a bill but don't give a fuck about why or your guest experience enough to come by the table to offer any knid of incentive to come back... you don't belong in the SERVICE industry. Your restaurant is dead and your service sucks, and your only solution is comping food... GOOD LUCK.",EfcN79hBsczoo5ucFjvMAg,0,0,1,SA24tlvpTYp68IQc3tti4Q

5558051,2016-03-23,0,NOfbzTpQ7hrt6ZbJVeXUUw,"Being from California originally, I have been desperate for good Mexican food in Vegas that is not over $15 a plate.  The menu here is fairly simple with street tacos, tortas, fajitas, tostadas and a handful of starters.  The tacos are street tacos, so smaller tortilla, but are over filled with meat. We had the chicken tacos, which were quite good and the barbacoa (beef short rib). The barbacoa was fairly spicy and had decent flavor, but was also rather greasy, may be because it was made of  short rib. The chicken taquitos were the best thing on the menu we had the other night. Nicely crisp, not greasy, and great flavor. Happy hour specials only include drinks, since tacos are only about $3.50 each not much room for a discount. Chips and salsa are not complementary, but still not overly expensive (we passed on it this trip).  Sodas are fairly priced on he menu, unlike other restaurants at Town Square at $4+. A few minor bugs in service, being a new place it was nothing horrible, so we will be back when we want good Mexican street tacos or taquitos and to not spend a fortune.",kFFbseYgzd_1iGVoTw7hPg,0,0,4,MLuTFcs7KIOdFWL8cD5tjQ

Was met at the podium after a minute or two by a gentleman who was sitting some distance away when we walked in who I assume to be a manager by the confused look on his face that after a few minutes his hostess wasn't back to seat us. 


We chose to sat on the patio due to the weather and the view which is fantastic of Town Square. We were met again a few minutes later by our server, while not an inordinate amount of time was alittle longer then anticipated. She was quick to take our drink though seemed disappointed we ordered water while looking for a stronger drink to order, she again asked if we'd prefer a Margarita or cocktail before leaving as we had yet to make a selection. 

After 5 or so minutes our water arrived though still no napkins and silverware eventually had to ask for these. Ordered a drink which was a shocking 10 dollars for a margarita that was smaller then my water glass and not very strong at all. We also ordered an appetizer of Queso Fundido. This took a long while to arrive and was basically a mass of melted cheese in a bowl with some chili on top. No sauce to and no seasoning. After some more time we finally ordered our main course of a chicken taco apiece and some soup.

The chicken tortilla soup was fantastic, the chorizo chili not so much basically a bowl of oil and meat. Chicken tacos while looking delicious left some to be desired as also lacking seasoning and dry.

Bottom line: while the food was priced very well and my soup wasn't bad though overall the food was eh. Drinks were weak and very over priced and the service was definately not on par as even getting the bill was 15 minute wait mind you on a Sunday afternoon with only 20 people in the place. Our waitress never checked in on how our food was only to see if we would order more drinks even though I declined twice I assume to drive the bill up for her tip.
