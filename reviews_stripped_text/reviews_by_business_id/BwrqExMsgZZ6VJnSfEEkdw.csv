This version here is a bit oily, and lacks the robust flavor ""punch"" it's supposed to have and is a bit low on the spicy scale, especially since i ordered it more spicy.  the goi cuon rolls were the same as usual and I also tried the soda chanh: lime juice with sugar and club soda which was fizzled out, (not much bubbles).  I have yet to try the actual Pho here and they do have lunch specials for $5.99 w/ soda or tea.... so we shall see...

banzaiiiiiii.....

We should have known better when stepping into this place during lunch time and we were the only ones there. Another sign was that they were out of the pork rolls and Hainan chicken. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered pho, porridge, Luc Lac Beef and egg noodles. 
All the entrees were served and we had to wait another 20 minutes for the porridge and Luc Lac beef. Pho had a sour tinge to it and the egg noodles were doused in oyster sauce to mask its blandness. Our plate of brown bean sprouts were literally on its brink of death. How do you serve this to your customers?! 
The worst meal we've had in Vegas, probably the worst Vietnamese meal we've had anywhere, we will never come back here!!",SAvPGRKf6J1IsmCaI0jn0Q,0,0,1,eRe3UqzTCZdSetnNtWxXFw

It is located in the Westwind Centre strip mall on Spring Mountain Road, next to Marnee Thai restaurant and across the street from two $20/hour reflexology/foot spa locations.

In spite of the chilly weather, I was the only customer there the entire time I ate my extra large order of Pho Dac Biet ($9) at an extra leisurely pace.  I thought it was good, and not excessively salty. They have a large menu of items (from traditional Vietnamese pho restaurant offerings to Chinese), some of them even have photos on the wall to help those not familiar with Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine in narrowing down their potential menu selection.

The staff was efficient and my order came our after just two or three minutes.  The place is also clean, including the restaurant's restroom. Which is always nice.

There are a lot of Vietnamese pho restaurants in the area, but I will come back and explore their menu further.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,5,4,ld9BeadNkTWmxJHR9dYN4Q
