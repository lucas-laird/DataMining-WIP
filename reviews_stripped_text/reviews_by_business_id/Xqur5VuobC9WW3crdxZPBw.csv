I had the hot and sour soup with some lettuce wraps.  The first thing I'll say is that if you are alone, this is probably not the best dinner spot unless you are content to order off of the appetizer menu as I did.  I found it to be quite expensive.  For instance, my dinner which consisted of about 16 oz of soup, a takeout container of lettuce and a takeout container of chicken and rice with hoisin sauce was nearly $20.  Their lunch menu seems to be far more reasonable in price.  Even though I am on an expense account, I still look for good value.
The hot and sour soup was ok.  I have certainly had better.  The lettuce wraps, however were out of this world.  I might go back for those alone or have them as a lunchtime meal.
To sum up, points off for price-value but points added for quality of the entree.  It is certainly worth your time to check out.",LbMmdmpwpS00Vz2QL9XyFw,0,0,3,XknhujTWX4hrS5f3i0OyFg

Relatively quiet. Good for reading and lunch meetings.

I came here for lunch on a weekday. It was fairly empty, but the one waitress working was apologizing to every table for the wait. There is something wrong with that. 

My order was taken after someone else seated after me. My hot tea was forgotten until half way through my long wait for my meal. The meat was really fatty (but to be fair, I do not normally order meat so for all I know it was supposed to be fatty).

I will not come here again.",ge1VIGEGXNnH7bPTEBEpMQ,0,0,1,52qZbD43rGtJ4Q92ZwBEnQ

The restaurant is furnished with the traditional Chinese dcor; tapestries, statues, and pretty tablecloths. The only difference is that the food is amazing. The chicken is fresh and juicy, not the usual chewy stuff. The soups are all prepared fresh as well, and the fish dishes are prepared with care. The restaurant is never full, and around lunch time, it is a quick pick for a midday break . If you are in the area and looking for good Chinese, AmLee is the best option around

You get 5 star quality side table service. 

The Mai Tai was so good. Didn't realize how much alcohol they put it in until it crept up on me later. 

Food was fresh and really tasty. 

Shrimp Won Tons- most places serve these with imitation crab and you normally can't find a place to serve good quality won tons anymore. These were crunchy and delicious. Not greasy like in most places.

Chicken Salad with peanuts - this was good but out of the whole meal would be last on my list to reorder. Peanuts were all I could taste. 

Chicken Lettuce wraps- not overpowered by the sauce and crunchy but again would probably put this item second to last. 

The Strawberry chicken brought back good memories. Just as I remember from childhood. It was still crisp outside with it even smothered in strawberry sauce. My fork going through didn't make it turn to mush so good job balancing the crisp outside while you still have plenty of sauce. 

All time favorite is Am Lee Beef!!! Can't describe in words how good. 

My first time eating Generals Chicken and I wasn't disappointed. 

Ambiance is more of the old school feeling. Doesn't seem to have been modernized but at least you get that nostalgia feeling of old times when you go in. It's not falling apart just has that old vibe to it.",ijRuBwdvHWjXyLZnh4Y9Qw,1,0,5,qrisLGHE8CBh0T-1nVlFng

1641791,2017-08-03,1,Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Recommended. Food is high-quality, venue has some ambiance, prices a bit off-putting.

I hit this venue late-shift on a weekday; it's open until 10pm. I had been meaning to try this place out since I first noticed it when I was patronizing the smoke shop next door.

This is not (what I call) a 'wok-u-up,' take-out joint, it's a bone-fide sit-down restaurant. The space is nicely appointed. Not breath-taking upscale, but quite nice and entirely date-worthy. Wax white butcher paper over white tablecloth. (My thinking is that if a Chinese restaurant has white tablecloths and it doesn't want to change them up every meal, then it should go with clear plexiglass on top. That's easy to clean up and the tablecloth is still on display). You can check the pictures others have posted here to verify the attractiveness of the venue, if you wish.

As mentioned by other Yelpers, my greeter/server had a natural knack for enhancing my experience, in her soft-spoken kindness and thoughtfulness. 

The space was almost entirely empty during my visit. My guess is that, even though the quality of my meal was very high, these prices are interfering with dinner traffic. Sweet & sour pork with steamed rice as dinner entrée, $16.95. Upgrade to fried rice, $6. Egg rolls $6.95. Soups are $4 to $6. With a starter, drink, tip, you are in for about $35 per-person here. So therein is the one-star ding.

But the beef in my meal was extraordinarily tender ... and both my entrée and my soup were seasoned to be quite tasty indeed. And so the quality certainly bears out much of the pricing. Service was higher-end; my entrée was rolled out on a cart and the server placed my initial portion on my plate for me. Don't see THAT in many Chinese restaurants any more!

The place is certainly quiet enough to afford dinner conversation over your table & meal. I was quite surprised, but have no complaint in that, the soft, ambient music ... is well described as ""Top disco hits of 1978.""

Haven't had it yet, but it looks as though lunch is the best bet here, $8 to $10 (add a buck for seafood options) and that includes soup, egg roll, fried rice. 

CONCLUSIONS: So, again, recommended. Good food, fawning service, attractive venue. Lunch ... or dinner with a lovely lady companion ... appear to be the best fit for dining here. I am sure to return.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,1,1,4,BlgfoiRvzFJEtqb6MXy5hA

1661581,2011-06-20,0,Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw,"Affordable prices tend to be associated with Chinese food; however, this is not the case at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. If it weren't for their ridiculously expensive prices, I would definitely come here more often because I find it quite challenging to find delicious Chinese food in the Las Vegas area.

They put a twist in some of their dishes. Some of their menu items go beyond the traditional Chinese food items. For instance, their duck isn't prepared roasted or peking style; it's breaded. The sauce that comes with the duck is so so good; sweet and tangy and NOT hoisen sauce which made it a great compliment for this dish. I kind of feel that their food leans toward a more Americanized palate rather than OG Chinese, which, don't get me wrong, isn't bad. I'm not sure what their specialties leaned more toward since I'm not very knowledgeable on the difference between cantonese/mandarin dishes, but their quality is superb. 

Everytime I've had the opportunity to dine in, it hasn't been busy. I don't want this place to go out of business because it's one of the few Chinese places in the valley I would dine at. Maybe it's their location and prices that deter people from coming but I hope that the service and food, at least their food, will outweigh their prices.

Great place to dine in and at least this isn't the most expensive Chinese food joint, with similar quality and flair that I've had the pleasure of dining it.",j0vDYYFE2eNvjm5NXHFmbA,1,0,4,uZHpRhMFNgF_7RZ6RFToig

I figured maybe I was having a bad day, the workers were having a bad day, and it wasn't fair to judge them solely on one bad experience.  That, and I was inspired by someone's posting of a picture of Amlee's general chicken which looked absolutely delicious.

So I decided to order a lunch special to go (disguising my voice over the phone, so I wouldn't be recognized as the asshole who didn't tip last time, thereby prompting them to spit in my food).  When I arrived to pick it up, the Asian owner was there.  She was much nicer to me, all smiles, and she even offered me extra rice without me asking (!!!).  Which makes me think maybe she saw my earlier review...  In which case, I'm sorry I called you a bitch.

We ordered the Mongolian beef, chow mein and some rice. This was pleeeeenty for two people. One thing I actually didn't enjoy much was the champagne that I had ordered. It was violet champagne and honestly, I'm a big fan of wine and champagnes, but this one just didn't cut it for me. Don't know why, but the taste wasn't very appealing. Almost tasted like grape medicine or something (Sorry Amlee!)

After sitting down another family entered the business. This family had a giant service dog. They got served first, however, it made no sense why. Maybe they wanted the dog out so the family got served faster. Maybe I should try that in the future (just kidding).

Additionally, my friend was served a drink, but the waiter did not serve me. It's like she got distracted after serving one person at the table and just walked away.

I ordered the strawberry chicken, and it was decent. The breading was detached from the chicken breast after the staff cut it into pieces. My English friend who order the Amlee chicken really seemed to like it. We were both in a weird state where we liked each others food better than what we ordered. However, we did not think to switch dinner plates.

My meal did not stand out well enough for me to recommend anything. It was average, especially after a re-opening.

2934532,2011-08-27,2,Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw,"Unfortunately for most Chinese restaurants around the US, Amlee is the gold standard for me. I was raised on their menu back when this place was first known as Chin-Chin's when it opened in 1975, in what I believe was an old Arby's storefront, by Tola Chin and his brother. This restaurant eventually outgrew this space and moved into a brand-new location, I believe on Flamingo Road near Eastern, becoming Chin's. At one point they had three different locations. Once Tola and his brother retired, Amlee, who had worked with Tola for years, took over and continued the tradition, pretty much keeping the same menu. The quality is still of the same high standard it's been from the start of this gem.

Amlee and Chin's had such an impact on me (and in this review I treat them as one), 1) because it wasn't like all the other Chinese restaurants my parents would take me to when I was young. I hated Chinese food before trying their food. Their food tasted good, and 2) they cared about presentation. These qualities are true today.
 
They keep their dishes simple. Here are a few highlights.

Their Shrimp Puffs are the best I've ever had, because they make their wonton very thin and crispy. It's so thin you can see a hint of the creamy shrimp concoction inside. The creamy filling isn't greasy, and it has a nice consistency.

Their Cashew Chicken has a nice mix of vegetables and isn't drenched in sauce like it is at most Chinese restaurants. And like with all of their dishes which include vegetables, the vegetables are fresh and not over cooked.

Their unique Tossed Shredded Chicken Salad, which is a simple salad of lettuce, shredded chicken and cellophane noodles tossed lightly in sesame oil.

Prices are on the higher side, but I can live with it because the food is unique, tastes great and the quality is high. Whenever I'm visiting Las Vegas, I ALWAYS go to Amlee at least once.",dJq-SlIUo0PGKQTVctFB0A,6,1,5,wfBLYdmXLm6PsuPmZSl08w

I decided to have the Singapore noodles because it seemed different.  It was very flavorful and portion was good.  I was able to have a portion for another meal and took it home. The server Denise was fantastic. Check the picture out she presented the dish on a cart and served it! The environment and decor is old but the hospitality is fantastic!

No, it's NOT cheap, and I think that people are really spoiled by cheap food in town; this restaurant is great and it's family run -- which means these people are trying to make a living from their hard work.  The prices are NOT exorbitant for a good, non-chain dinner house.

3052357,2009-07-29,0,Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw,"Amlee is a beautiful and clean Chinese food restaurant.  As soon as you walk in, you can tell that's its in a different league altogether from those hole-in-the-wall places.  The service is attentive and efficient, and also quite polite.  The food was prepared quickly.  The restaurant has a lot of white and on the whole seemed airy and open, with nice table cloths and red cloth napkins.  It had the makings of a fine-dining restaurant.  

The food, on the other hand, was just okay.  It was not particularly amazing, and you could tell that they did not eschew the use of MSG to pump up the flavor of their dishes.  The chicken was soft and tender, and not dry and chewy like other restaurants, and the shrimp was plumb and fresh.  It was just a little bland, that's all.  A bit of soy sauce would help this, as would some salt and pepper, but you have to specifically ask for it, because they not placed on the table (takes away from the atmosphere, I'd guess).  

Last word will be on the prices.  You're paying a lot more here than you would at most Chinese places.  Chow mein for $12?  At lunch time, even?  It's a little steep.  The beef was also good and soft, but didn't jump out at me as being the best.

Service was great! No doubt. We were greeted and seated quickly, waters poured immediately, and we were checked on constantly. The restaurant's layout is spacious-- a cross between fine-dining table arrangements, but trapped within an 80's throwback style. (You'll see what I mean when you see the red neon.) It's kinda nostalgic though. Think: A Christmas Story.

Then there's the food. Simply put, it was underwhelming. Dinner might be a totally different story, but their lunch specials were mediocre. The egg flower soup was served piping hot, but it was bland. First time I had to use salt and pepper on a soup. Next, I chose the shrimp chow mein as my entree. The shrimps were sizable, but overall, dish was still tasteless. The side of generic fried rice it comes with had more flavor and that's being kind.

Lunch prices are unjustified at about a couple dollars more compared to other similar Chinese restaurants with better lunch specials. Maybe I just chose the wrong thing?",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,3,2,2,wRk4naBXAP4ooH0gtexikg

I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!

Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared ""family style"" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. 

Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. 

Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.

Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.

Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.

Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.

They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside.

3947826,2016-08-22,0,Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw,"After my second time ordering my here, I've decided never again. And here's why:

Despite their overinflated prices for poor proportions of food compared to places more affordable and still edible like ChinaTango (my previous go-to), I liked to come here because their rice was less greasy even if I got half the serving for a dollar more.

Me and my pops spent $50 here, even included a small tip because I felt bad not tipping even though it's for pick-up. And they STILL managed to inconvenience me when I go to get it after waiting 20 minutes at home, they tell me it'll be another 15 that turned out be almost 20.

But- it's Sunday and they're busy, whatever. I don't like to cuck about nothing because I'm in customer service and being anal about everything is the most unattractive trait for service workers to deal with. So I say nothing and take my order home.

When I open the box of wontons, I'm surprised to find just flat pieces of deep fried ""cracker"" (I know that's not what it is but it might as well have been) without much else in them. I try one and I'm shocked that I paid $6 for a morsel of meat inside a deep fried piece of toast. In talking about a crumb-size piece of chicken as if it barely existed. I'm annoyed enough at their prices to go back and ask for a refund after being directed by Eat24 to do so.

I show up and the manager/owner guy who handled it when the hostess couldn't was the rudest jerkoff about the whole thing I've ever encountered. I wasn't even going off except letting them know how I felt about paying $6 for a box of crackers when he decided to argue with me. There was NOTHING in them and I took the box with me to show for it and he insists angrily that he's been making them for 20 years, I should have called (for what?), and that I should have ""ordered them with more meat"".

Idk how people have been eating those overcooking pieces of crisp for 20 years and not said anything to him but okay. How was I supposed to know they barely fill their wontons? I just know that ChinaTango makes them full of meat and these things were just as bland as their fried rice is now that I think about it from that terrible after taste their service gave me. They refunded me but not without a fight and giving me a hard time which is #1 in service is the emotional labor of letting people b|tch at you to get their money back. #2 is making your food how it's advertised: WITH MEAT. 

tl;dr: never again.",aRpg4ufrMYne9e9wYLjJcg,2,1,2,x9HRg4sUlFydiiHVPpHH3Q

I wanted to find a good local Chinese restaurant to satisfy a craving for Chinese Chicken Salad. Persuaded by the favorable YELP reviews, we decided to try out Amlee Chinese Cuisine for dinner. We loved it!  The moment we entered the door we knew we were in for a treat. The soft lighting in the restaurant gives the room a feeling of intimate dining. The place is clean and the tables are well spaced. The atmosphere there is just perfect for dining & conversation. 

Service & staff...THE BEST!

Maria & (I didn't get the other server's name) are absolutely exceptional. We were served promptly and both ladies treated us with such a courteous, warm and friendly manner, that it made us feel not only welcomed, we didn't want to leave. Actually, we were the last customers to leave the restaurant. Upon, leaving the restaurant, the impressive Wall of Fame caught our attention and the maître d graciously shared a bit of history about the restaurant and the owner.  

Dinning: We ordered Amlee's Appetizer Plate, Shredded Chicken Salad, and Eggplant with Shrimp because it was one of the specials for the day.

Was there a favorite dish? Was there a least favorite dish? NOPE, because everything is was great! We thoroughly enjoyed everything. Simply stated the food is good because there is a subtle balance of flavors and everything was prepared with perfection. Serving size are well portioned for sharing a meal (we took home leftovers) and the pricing good, too. 

To all the YELP reviewers, thank you for posting your feedback, because Amlee is definitely my new favorite local Chinese Restaurant!",tYJwx3RxFsbI_6fWX0ocPw,0,0,5,UOy4NLdVlZgrSW163jImWQ

  Money talks. When I  spend money I talk about it on Yelp. In the next few paragraphs I will talk about my lunch in Amlee Chinese Cuisine. 

 In recent times I have been trying out the different Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. After visiting Amy's Hallmark, I decided to try Amlee Chinese Cuisine near my house. 

 Amlee Chinese Cuisine is located in a small strip mall at the southeast corner of Sunset and Sandhill Roads. From what I read, Amlee Chinese Cuisine has been standing in this exact spot for thirty years. It has been thirty years of family ownership. When a restaurant is in business for thirty years, they rise above it all. In 2003, Amlee Chinese Cuisine rised above it all when the Best of Las Vegas voted it the best Chinese Restaurant in 2003 (www.usmenuguide.com/amleegourmet.htm).

   When I walked inside Amlee Chinese Cuisine at lunchtime, I saw a bar to my right and a spacious dining room to the left. The tables were large and nearly empty at this visit. 

  The personable waitress led me to a table in this comfortable dining room. Soon, she poured the water into a clean glass. Nonetheless I ordered a Coke with my lunch. This is the first Chinese Restaurant that has ever served me Coke from Mexico. So, it was a cosmopolitan lunch with Mexican Coke and Chinese food. 

  The luncheon special attracted me to Amlee Chinese Cuisine. As my fellow Yelpers have stated, the prices here are higher. I can't support the argument that you get what you pay for when I had food of equivalent taste and quality for the same price recently at dinner in China Bistro, NY Chinese Restaurant, and China Tango Bistro. The lunch specials range between $7.95 and $10.95. They include an entre, soup of the day that is expectedly the omnipresent egg drop soup, egg roll, and choice of fried or white rice. For $1.50 extra, they will substitute the soup of the day with wonton soup. With a Coke from Mexico, wonton soup, and tip my lunch special added up to around $17.50.

  I ordered the shrimp chow mein. The personable waitress stated that this is one of her favorites. In my opinion, the wonton soup was my favorite. I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life and not get tired of it. Maybe that's because wonton soup is in my Top 25 Favorite Foods List. The fried rice was a lighter color than I was used to. However, it was delicious. The noodle based shrimp chow mein was also delicious. I appreciated all the vegetables that tasted like onion and cabage mixed in. On the other hand I would of appreciated more than four shrimp. Come to think of it, I would of appreciated it if the meal included crunchy noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard. 

  I have done enough talking about Amlee Chinese Cuisine. In my opinion that is based on experiences dining in Chinese Restaurants, Amlee is a good Chinese Restaurant that I anticipate serving the Las Vegas community in the decades ahead.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,9,3,dPmRcBDTKxHk9-dDcBTYFg

This restaurant had fair reviews so we thought we would try it for lunch. Lunch includes rice, an egg roll and soup. You must pay an extra $1.50 if you want the hot and sour soup. Lunch price ranges from $7.95 to $10.95. We asked to see the dinner menu and the ala crate items seemed to be a little more expensive than standard prices. The soup was OK but the hot and sour seemed very heavy in corn starch. When our food arrived it was Cold, not warm, but actually cold. We had them take the dishes back and they returned after being microwaved. A great restaurant would have cooked them fresh to make the customers got their very best. Even being nuked they were still good. My wife had Cashew Chicken and I had Chow Mien. My wife liked the Cashew Chicken and felt it was ""good."" My Chow Mien was also good, not ""OMG THIS IS GREAT!"" I would give it four stars if the food hadn't arrived cold. There also seemed to be plenty of staff but the attentiveness was mediocre. We will probably eat here again to see if some other items are better and if the food arrives hot. The place is worth a try.",pgfEIQ0w9LUwQGjI7D-fLw,0,0,3,z14JTnnpFMiNNaF_mSCp1Q

4911395,2014-12-31,0,Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw,"I'll be honest, after reading the reviews for this place, I really, really wanted to love them. The restaurant itself is very clean, inviting, and the staff really sweet. The menu had everything I was looking for on it. I was making a quick stop for lunch before meeting up with someone, figured I had plenty of time.

I placed my order, got some water with lemon in it, and then glanced at my phone - woops - I had miscalculated and was going to be late, especially if I took my time eating! It was totally not their fault, they were on it with the service, it was all on me.

Glad that I hadn't ordered anything more exciting than water, I grabbed my purse and went up to the front counter. I apologized and asked if I could change my order to to-go. She was cool about it. A few minutes later, I had my bagged up lunch and was out the door. I made my appointment in time, and, luckily, it was casual enough that they didn't mind if I whipped out my chopsticks and started munching away.

I had ordered the orange peel chicken. It sounded really good on paper. It tasted like...salt. Honestly, I found nothing really good about it. Nothing really bad, either, just kind of meh, like grocery store Chinese. I had ordered it spicy, and it wasn't. It was just so-so.

Just for the record, when I order ""spicy"" - babes, that means melt my face, curl my hair, steam out my ears spicy. Not just extra salt. Perhaps there was a communication problem?

I gave them three stars (rounded up from 2-1/2, which isn't an option) for service and because I'm willing to come back with the hubby to try other things. Based on the other reviews, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try again. They've been here a long time and I haven't.

4934679,2013-11-06,3,Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw,"When I am at a place where the owner of Lee's Liquor is dining and having a business meeting, I am thinking, I am in the right place. Gourmet Chinese Cuisine at it's finest.  

Here is the deal.....

a.  Do you like sweet and sour pork?
b.  Do you like spicy chicken?
c.  Do you like hot and sour soup?
d.  Do you like egg rolls?
e.  Do you like to have a soda with your Chinese Food?
f.  Do you like ice cream for your dessert at a Chinese Restaurant?
g. Do you consider Fortune Cookies to be Chinese or Asian?


If you answer yes to any of the above, you are gonna love this place and so it will be a good place for you. 

The ambiance is nice, plenty of tables, good spacing and room.
This is great for general lunches, business lunches, power lunches.
They have a full bar so for those special meetings, plenty of drinks are available.
The food, westernized asian cuisine, is very palatable and perfect for the casual diner, a romantic date, a business occasion.

For all the above reasons, i would say that If PF Change was a 5 star on a scale of 1-5, then Amlee would be a 4.5 star!

For me, I give this place 3 stars because:

a. The food was not in accordance with my preferred style of Chinese Food.
b.  When I am in a Chinese restaurant and green peppers or celery or carrots are the main basis of the vegetable, I know that I am in a non authentic restaurant.
c.  I ordered the Wor Won Ton and it was cooked in a water based soup and not a broth based soup.  The best and real Chinese soups are broth based. The soup was, well, hot water. You can tell when it is broth based The color, richness, the bits of meat are still there.
d.  The chicken used for the meat was frozen chicken breast and not chicken on the bone.
e.  They serve all the dishes on plates and give you chopsticks.  Remember, Chopsticks are for bowls and fork and spoon are for plates.
f.  Gourmet Chinese in either Mainland China, Hong Kong, or other places consists of things like Shark Fin Soup, Steamed Fish, Abalone, Jelly Fish, Other Seafood, Tea made from tea leaves and not a tea bag, and many other details.  This food was not gourmet, it was simply adequate.
g.  No Fish Tank visible to the patrons = no live fresh seafood.


The service is great and friendly, the crowd and the people are very nice, lots of regulars. I would say if you like this style of food, then this is a great place.  This review is for anyone seeking truly authentic Chinese food. If so, this is not the place and you would or may be better off dining at the Panda Express across the street for half the price.

4960358,2010-04-08,1,Xqur5VuobC9WW3crdxZPBw,"Great atmosphere, fine food, TERRIBLE PRICES.

I went to this restaurant at the insistence of my girlfriend, who loves Chinese food. Yes, I'm a pushover and I take her pretty much anywhere she wants to go.

I figured, ""why not?"" I'll give it a whirl. Upon walking in, the atmosphere is incredible. It has a higher class appearance than other dining establishments of its kind. They really went the extra mile to make a nice-looking restaurant, with no annoyances or distractions. Like most other Chinese restaurants around town, this one does have delivery and take-out options.

The menu has a ton of options, and nearly everything I have had a chance to try here has been very good. Not the best Chinese in the Vegas Valley, but it's definitely good stuff. If you're a fan of Chinese food, you'll most likely enjoy what you get. 

This brings me to my two complaints. First and foremost, the menu does not have pictures of the items or descriptions of them. Casual diners won't know what a good deal of this stuff means. I shouldn't have to ask the waitress what something is - the menu should tell me that. 

And then comes the BIG complaint - these prices are SKY HIGH. This is the most expensive Chinese restaurant I have ever visited. The food and atmosphere are excellent, but they do not justify said prices. There have been times when I have been able to feed a family of 3 or 4 at Outback (down the street) on less money than it costs 2 to eat here. 

If you've got the money, Amlee has fine food and a great atmosphere. But with these harsh economic times and a shortage of cash in my pocket, I'll be keeping my distance.

The service is excellent. Your food is brought to your table, and individual plates are prepared from the variety of foods ordered. This is a pretty cool thing.

We ordered the steamed orange roughy and prawns in lobster sauce. While both were well prepared, as is typical for chinese food and my taste buds, there wasn't a whole lot of interesting flavors and textures. The veggies were all soft and lacked crunch. 

Prices were a bit higher than I was expecting, both entrees ran around $19 each, and the entire menu is a bit pricey. I had a $9 mai tai that was delicious, but again, pricey. 

Overall, a nice, classy Chinese food place with decent food at a little above normal prices.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,3,3,am1x6xzm8lmxMr3iZ3MTcg

The service was outstanding, they couldn't have been nicer or more concerned that we were enjoying our meal. My only complaint is that we had to come 300 miles to eat there. I sure wish we had an Am Lee in Salt Lake City.",BH3vXToSpTH1o9AdNdO9rg,0,0,5,_RzJozxf04ziFpHsVmAGcQ

Disregarding the 3.5 rating, I decided to visit it myself to see how it is. The portions were more than decent. The ""vegetarian delight"" lunch special I ordered was only $9.99, and it included the meal, a side of fried rice, and a bowl of egg drop soup. With lunch specials, you have the choice between steamed white rice, fried rice w/egg, or egg rolls. Along with that, you have the choice of egg drop soup, or paying an additional $1-2 to have wonton or sweet and sour soup. Overall loved the place, and it's perfect for having a group of friends come with.",56I9CNu-HyqpCxsOXroJXQ,0,0,5,MOFES_9C85th51HwnEDRbw
