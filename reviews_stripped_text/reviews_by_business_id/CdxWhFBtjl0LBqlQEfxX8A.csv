1169797,2018-02-15,0,CdxWhFBtjl0LBqlQEfxX8A,"I made it my mission to make it to Pronto on the day of the Grand Opening. To be honest, I didn't have the highest expectations. Celebrity Chef restaurants can be overrated now. Pronto blew my expectations out of the water. 

The design of the restaurant is beautiful. It's comfortable but still classy. There are three sections: quick service cafe, wine bar, and more of a retail store. The retail store was sectioned off for the grand opening, but that's okay. I came for the food. 

I had scoured the internet for a menu beforehand, but there wasn't one to be found. I read about the restaurant offering a grilled cheese, so I sought to try that. When I arrived, I was disappointed to see that the grilled cheese had lemon pesto. I am not a fan of lemon, so I passed. I wish it was just pesto. This city is sorely lacking a great chicken pesto sandwich.

All the sandwiches are pre-made, so don't expect to try to subtract any ingredients. I tried. The kind cashier offered to scrape avocado off a sandwich, but I spared her. I ordered the caprese panini. 

The panini was the biggest letdown for me here. They add parmesan to the outside of the sandwiches before pressing (which I usually love), but here it seems to only add crunchiness instead of flavor. I would rather they leave this off. I was also surprised to find that the sandwich had arugula instead of basil. I love basil, so this was a big disappointment. The panini also does not have balsamic (which is totally fine with me - I am not a balsamic fan), but this strays from the traditional caprese. 

Aside from the panini, I ordered a slew of the baked goods to take home with me. Here are my assessments:

Rosemary pancetta scone - This is a must order. I should have made this my lunch. It's the perfect balance of savory with a slight sweetness. 

Chocolate chip cookies - Really solid. They're a touch grainy, but I definitely would still eat them.

Black & White cookies - Pass. These have very little flavor. They're even lacking vanilla. 

Blueberry muffin - Easily one of the softest muffins I have ever had. It was like eating a cloud. The blueberry flavor could be a bit stronger, but I still recommend it. 

Chocolate Mascarpone Cake - This is a super solid, moist cake packed with chocolate flavor. For me, it was just missing chocolate chips for a bit of texture change. 

The prices on the baked goods are more than fair. The sandwich pricing, however, needs a bit of work. They're not worth the high price tag.

Check this place out. The baked goods are definitely worth it. Skip on the sandwiches.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,2,1,4,2EoExlqTFbEN780kja6A9g

Pronto it was as we were able to walk down from the Augustus Tower at Caesars, order, get our meals and be back in the room without missing any of the game during the break between the 2nd and 3rd period.  

Wife had the frittata and I had the mixed grill with steak, grilled vegetables and caprese.  We were both pleasantly surprised with the quality and generous portions.  My sliced flank steak was quite flavorful and the mixed veggies (asparagus, onion, red and yellow peppers portabella mushroom exceeded my expectations.  Might have just been my lucky day but the cherry tomato halves in the caprese may have been the sweetest I have had in many years.  The steak had great flavor and was relatively tender and given that it was reheated wasn't much past medium rare.  Contrary to other reviews we found the counter staff to be exceptionally pleasant and efficient.  We've eaten several times at Giada's at the Cromwell and actually feel that Pronto offers a better value.

I ordered a ham, gruyere and apple panini with a side grilled vegetables. The staff was nice and prepared the food no less than five minutes. There were lots of tables up for grabs so my friends and I quickly picked one and began munching. 

I really enjoyed the apple and ham combination. The gruyere was present but didn't stand out as much as other ingredients. It's also worth noting the panini has a delicious mustard sauce that also works well with the ham and apples. The grilled veggies had a nice charred flavor and tasted fresh. So fresh that the onion brings tears when eating them. Throw those bad boys back on the grill! LOL...I wouldn't recommend eating the onions alone unless you enjoy the strong flavor and burn but cutting small pieces to eat with the rest of the veggies works just fine. 

If you're looking for a hefty meal then I recommend looking elsewhere but if you're looking for a small decent lunch in Caesars, Pronto is the spot.

PROS:
-Good location in Caesars Palace
-Breakfast and light snack options (something Vegas is certainly lacking in)
-The women behind the counter were friendly and accommodating 

CONS:
-Overpriced, crowded, the tables were not clean when I was there
-The oatmeal was so salty I couldn't eat it, by the time I sat down to eat, the line was so long that I just threw it out instead of trying to return it.
-Chocolate croissant (which they warmed, appreciate that) was so melted and sopping wet that it tasted more like a hersheys bar melted onto a piece of limp bread.

Well to start I am not going to hold back. The service sucked I was informed by the sandwich maker that due to my order being keyed into the register wrong I had to eat the sandwich and not the fratta we ordered. I informed him we want we ordered and replied take it up with cashier. After waiting 20 minutes to clear up the mess out comes the fratta. 
I order a lobster roll which was to have chunks of lobster meat. Well again disappointed the lobster meat was shredded and was a tiny portion as you can see in the photo. The lobster roll was $15 way over priced even for Las Vegas standards. The photo indicates that the plastic knife was larger than the $15 shredded lobster disaster Giada is serving.
We couldn't find a fork and when I asked for one I was told when they get a chance someone would fill the empty fork bins. I was told are their spoons and if so use those for now. The restaurant was not busy and now I can see why.

So next day I returned to her restaurant for a breakfast sandwich. I ordered the Antipasti breakfast sandwich and her kale smoothie. The minute I took a bite of her sandwich, I instantly became her fan. I never in my life had such a fluffy egg!! Everything about the sandwich was PERFECT! Every bite I took, I got more and more lost in the fluffiness of the egg and it had the perfect portion of the meat as well!

By checking in on yelp you get a free lemon pastry and that was great with my coffee. 

I also had the soup of the day, it had a good flavor and was satisfying. That same day I made a stop at night time for some coconut gelato. That was my favorite thing from this place oh and the yogurt parfait, it was perfect.",jfAcHy2qUHWx2Eqj-LLHWw,0,0,4,f0j3Dar-saCZ3tseNirInA

If you have a sweet tooth, there are many types of gelato and ice creams to choose from, as well as pastries and those lemon basil cookies that are free with a Yelp check-in and purchase.

I got the $15 Lobster Roll that's already prepped in their refrigerated section. And it's literally one of the most delicious lobster rolls I've had. I seriously couldn't believe how fresh the flavors were.

They have hot and cold sandwiches and salads made to order. Also displayed is a great selection of pastries.

Folks also stop in here for a more Giada-styled coffees and lattes.

5432197,2018-05-21,1,CdxWhFBtjl0LBqlQEfxX8A,"Came here for lunch while at a work conference.  Note:  this is not Giada's full-service restaurant - it's the fast food spot.  I'm pretty sure that place will be a much different experience than mine in terms of food.  

Summary:  For the money, you can have a better meal.  My guess is Giada would tell you to try the full-service restaurant.

Ambience:  pretty cool - modern and bright with a splash of color - it's a nice departure from the rest of the Caesar's aesthetic.  Having the wine bar next door is a nice touch.

Service:  it's more fast-foody (go through a line), but the food looks pretty great.  The service was friendly but fast-foody, nothing bad, but nothing to really write home about.  

I had the steak with roasted vegetables.  Here's what threw me off:
-They heat up the meat in fancy microwaves, and it came out well-done.  If that was a possibility, I wish I had a chance to specify medium rare.  The roasted veggies were cold...but they're roasted, shouldn't they be hot?  And the food was served in plastic containers (even though it wasn't to-go).  None of this is a problem if I'm spending $10-15...but this was a $45 meal.

For dessert, I had the cheesecake cannoli (they have a gelato cannoli option).  This was well executed for my taste - not too cream-cheesy, the shell was not too thick...nicely balanced.  I also bought some cookies for later...which weren't bad either (the cannoli is the better buy).

This is a restaurant where you walk away feeling like you spent more money than you should have.  Your head will appreciate that it's fresh ingredients, but your taste buds may walk away confused.  It may be just my dish - try the salmon or chicken.  I'd probably save the steak meat for actual steak joints.",Y6VDOKFcApdF4xq9Tqcuag,1,0,3,maD22kEXLFw38i-Kzc6vKQ

Similar to a pizza joint at the mall, everything is pre-made so it just sits there and get stale.

The cashier was not pleasant at all.  No hello, thank you or instruction on where to grab my food even after I tipped him. 

The place is cute and ambience is nice.  Same feel as Giada's other place in be Cromwell, looks good but underperforms on the food.  I wouldn't come back.",fCnqBXgEcG3NjGeGpAMxTw,0,0,3,s8mbek_gWXYKbAT2daZUlA

Whilst I know its new the process from ordering to food delivery is awful resulting in missed orders, inaccurate orders, missing items and angry customer after angry customer. I ordered 4 times from here over 3 days and EVERY time they got the orders wrong or missed items. Whilst waiting (too long) I also witnessed dozens of other customers getting the wrong orders or their orders being completely forgotten. 

The process needs to change completely....

- They need more people making Paninis 
- The order station needs to be closer to the start (so the non english speaking chinese can point to what they want)
- They need someone collating orders (as if you order salad it comes from a different section than sandwiches). 
- The same person should be collating and checking orders (at least temporarily until they sort themselves out)

The issue is everyone has their station, but NO ONE is pulling it all together.
