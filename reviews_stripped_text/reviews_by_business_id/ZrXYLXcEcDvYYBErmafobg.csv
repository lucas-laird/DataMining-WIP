It comes with about 6 jumbo grilled shrimp and the polenta croutons are amazing! I have tried the recipe out of their cookbook for this, and even though the dressing tastes just like it, the croutons cannot be replicated. Also, i love the chimichurri sauce that comes with the steak, so i always order a side of it and eat it with the salad instead of the dressing.

They serve a variety of gourmet salads, sandwiches, pastas, pizzas and pastries. The prices are on the pricier side, but I feel the quality and taste of the food are worth it. I always end up with the chicken tomato alfredo with penne pasta. But my absolute favorite is the Roma tomato basil soup. I think I like it the best because it comes with this unbelievable parmesean crostini. *Ask for an extra and they are happy to oblige.

When I ordered a dessert from the server, the receipt had no area to leave a tip. So I had to embarrassingly ask if I could leave him a tip with my credit card.

Every time I go to a Nordstrom Cafe, I completely forget how it works and end up babbling like a neanderthal.  So, there's a paper version of the menu at the beginning of the counter (it's kind of hidden), but most people that eat here are loyal Nordstrom Cafe frequenters, so they already know they're going to get the Tomato Basil Soup (which is rumored to have crack in it).  You place your order, receive a glass for your beverage, and are provided with a sign with a number on it.  You pay at the cashier, then sit down at any table and place the sign on your table.  A friendly server will provide you with silverware and eventually bring your food over.

The service here is surprisingly impeccable considering its fast-casual concept.  After realizing I didn't have silverware, I felt like an idiot who missed something, but my server arrived immediately to provide me with some and said, ""I read your mind"" with a smile. The servers are very attentive and check on you frequently.

I am addicted to the California Grill sandwich.  It features roast turkey, tomato, bacon, swiss cheese, avocado, and garlic aioli all between two pieces of grilled sourdough bread.  It's an amazing combination of flavors and textures!  Of course, the Tomato Basil Soup with the crostini is perfect on a cold day, or any day for that matter.

Tried it. Bought it. Loved it. Bought it again. Resisted licking the plate.

Best salad I have ever had in my life!! Seriously, who needs a boyfriend when you can have this salad?!!! The croutons give your taste buds a warm welcome. They are fresh, warm, and delicately seasoned. The spinach is lightly drizzled in dressing (which I think they should rename Heaven). The grilled sweet corn and cherry tomatoes give the salad a little euphoric touch putting all the other salads to shame. Finally, the star of the show: the Succulent, juicy, seasoned to perfection grilled shrimp...Oh.My.Gosh. Have you ever been in love?

When you're tired of mall food courts and pricey Strip restaurants, Marketplace Cafe on the 3rd floor of Nordstrom is the perfect place to go.

Upon entering the cafe, you see the sample dishes in the refrigerator case and out on the counter. The visuals provided by these sample dishes are incredibly helpful when you're hangry or indecisive. I usually go for one of their sandwiches as they are always consistent with portion and taste.The chicken club with maple glazed bacon is my go to sandwich because of the thicker cut bacon and peppercorn aïoli. All sandwiches include chips..which for $11.50 in Las Vegas, is not a bad deal.

After just a cup of the soup, I longed for more, it was so creamy and flavorful - have them add some fresh basil to the top - this is by far the best tomato basil soup I've ever had.  

The panini was very good, with the perfect combination of flavors.  The cheese was at a perfect melting point and the pesto was dead on.  The only downside was the significant lack of chicken on the panini.  I'm sure at least half of my bites had no chicken in them, but the flavor mix of the other ingredients made it a great cheese sandwich!  

I thought it was reasonable priced for Nordstrom - just over $40 for 2 cups of soup, one pasta, two paninis and two drinks.

Because of previous reviews I got the tomato soup. There's a reason they sell it in to-go bottles people...its creamy and smooth and well seasoned. In short, deelish.

I also ordered a beef dip sandwich. All the things that can go wrong with that sandwich went really really right! Bread was crunchy without being hard to bite into, dipping au jus in a proper bowl (I hate when the bowl is too small to dip). Kettle chips on the side. 

Couldn't pass up the brownie for dessert. Huge square of chewy chocolatey goodness.

I decided to try the Nordstrom Cafe at the suggestion of my co-workers and was excited to have a Sunday morning brunch there with my fiance.  I should have read the other reviews a bit more closely because when we arrived, we were surprised to find that the cafe is cafeteria style.  We were frantically panning the items behind the glass and spotted a menu at the last minute when we got to the counter.  Since there was a long line behind us, my FI decided on the pesto panini and cup of tomato soup and I ordered what my co-workers suggested- a bowl of tomato soup and the mixed berry chicken salad, with a fresh squeezed lemonade.  For dessert we got a chocolate chip, macadamia cookie.

Wandering into the busy dining room with our trays we found a little booth and were pleasantly surprised when a server arrived with silverware and to take our trays away.  The food was delicious!  The salad could not have been better and the soup... oh the soup.  I showed some self control and saved the cookie for later and even my FI enjoyed splitting that, and he does not really like sweets (crazy, I know).  

Now I am worried that every time I go back to the Nordrstrom Cafe, I will continue to order the same thing because I loved it so much!",Jdx_u3PxmXLCOyP_Pkn7Sg,2,1,5,dJYAm4aP8WSFqWqGuDEn8w

Lunch here has always taken a surprisingly long time given that it is cafeteria style.  Actually the whole cafeteria style design is kind of stupid because the only thing you can really get right away is the soup.  Everything, salads included, gets made back in the kitchen and the food takes about 10-15 minutes in my experience.

The tomato basil soup was really good when I had it.  I realized recently that they always have it, even if it isn't posted on the soup of the day board.  So get it.  The cajun salmon Caesar salad was also pretty good.

It's located on the 3rd floor of the Fashion Show Mall, which means depending on the time of year, it can be overrun with tourists. But if you go during the week and avoid peak lunch time, you're in for a treat! 

I've never been disappointed with the food at Marketplace Cafe! My favorite dish is the Classic French Dip. I'm not exaggerating when I say that THIS IS THE BEST FRENCH DIP YOU'LL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE! The warm roast beef paired with the sharp white cheddar on a Parmesan baguette is my idea of heaven. I could eat this sandwich every day of the week. 

The service can be inconsistent every once in a while; it really just depends on the time of year and how busy they are. If you have the place to yourself, you shouldn't have any problems--and this is usually the case. But if they are busy, be prepared to wait a little longer than you might expect for your food, and the servers to take awhile to check on you. 

Overall, if you want to experience the BEST French Dip in Las Vegas, or any other assortment of really hearty, wholesome dishes, Marketplace Cafe is a hidden gem that's definitely worth the effort of making your way through Fashion Show Mall!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,1,2,4,uass8Vc8GFuBE-YXK1VyQA

I never really liked salad.  To me, it's too boring.  Boy was I wrong when I gobbled down the Mixed Berry Salad with chicken.  Now I have the love for this salad.  The combination of the different berries (strawberries, blackberries and raspberries), candied walnuts, crumbled blue cheese, mixed with lovely fresh greens and blackberry champagne vinaigrette over it is amazingly refreshing.  People who loves berries must try this.  oh so GOOD.

I've tried the tuscan chicken entree and the chicken I had was juicy and nice.  It comes with grilled veggies (potatoes, carrots, zucchinis and red bell pepper).  My bf ordered another time, and he said his chicken was dry though.  That sucks for him, but I enjoyed my food, please see below.

I had the.....drum roll please...GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH w/TOMATO BASIL SOUP!!!!!
yep yep, from the kid's menu, but i don't care.  It's super yummy to me.  I had the sourdough bread, in which you have the option of them making it using wheat bread.  The kid's meal comes with a drink (i chose oj) and a bowl of fresh fruit.  Guess how much does my favorite meal cost at this awesome cafe?  under $5 bucks!  

Their cookies are very big and good as well.  They are soft and chewy.  I had their triple chocolate brownie, it was decent, not something that i would order again though.  I have also tried their lemon bar.  It was refreshing.  My bf ate it and said it taste like a soap bar, but again, lemon isn't his flavor, why did I even bother to shove a piece down his throat...BECAUSE i want him to taste the yummy stuff that I taste.  O well, i will not waste anymore yummy stuff on someone who doesn't know how to savor lemony stuff.  Which means...MORE FOR ME!!!

The end of the meal, they give you chocolate mint sticks, which are fabulous, icing on the cake for me.

1. The Tomato Basil Soup, otherwise known as Crack Soup. Just scroll through all of the reviews if you don't want to take my word for it and see how many other Yelpers will rave on and on and about this stuff. The hype is real!

2. The Pesto Chicken Panini. Ahhhh, even typing it makes me happy and kind of hungry. This panini is perfection to me.

The Nordstrom Cafe is located at the Fashion Show Mall inside of Nordstrom on the third floor. Walking in, just head to the right and grab a tray for yourself and a refreshment on your way to the line. Tell the nice ladies what you would like to order and then proceed to the cash register. Nordstrom Cafe believes in physical menus and everything look amazing. If you think it looks good, just order it.

After you pay, go to an open table and your server will remove the tray and bring out your food order. You get fun, little chocolate mint sticks at the end of your meal.

I usually order the pepperoni and mushroom pizza (think I might have ordered the Chinese chicken salad before, not sure) but this time I decided to step outside of my comfort zone and order a panini for the first time. Got the pesto chicken since I love pesto and I definitely enjoyed it! I was skeptical of the cheese included...but all the ingredients work out for the best and compliment each other. My only criticism is that the pesto could have been richer in taste, but then again I doubt its made in house otherwise it would take longer for the panini to come out.

You order it cafeteria style, forming a line and grabbing your drinks and Chips along the way.  You then pay for your food and they'll either call your number or find you at your table.

The place will get packed around lunchtime, so it's best if you divide and conquer.  Have a couple of friends find an open table and snag it while you order and pay for the food.  That's the most efficient way to dine here.

I grabbed some sparking white wine and ordered a Beef Dip, a cookie and 2 pizzas. 
Slid my way down to the cash register where Medardo rang me up and was nice enough to take my tray for me to my booth. 

He also opened and poured my wine for me and brought me a glass of ice water with a lemon wedge ( which I love ! ) 

When my Beef dip was ready, he delivered it to my booth. It was the best I have ever eaten ! It had a generous amount of really good quality, perfectly cooked beef. Not the fatty hard to chew type I have had before. 

The bun was toasted to perfection - not too hard and not at all soggy. If came with a side of potato chips and eau juice. 

The pizza arrived shortly after. If too was very tasty and I got whatever was left to go. 

The cookie was really yummy. It was baked in store and had big chocolate chips, macadamia nuts and coconut.

He was immediately nice when he saw that I was a customer with a question. The workers looked uncomfortable around him, and I even asked one of the workers if she liked working with him. She just politely shook her head. I found out his name was Scott by the end. He's not there anymore, luckily, and I asked a lot of employees about it and they all seem extremely happy.

The tomato basil soup is another favorite and this comes with a kids grilled cheese sandwich meal that my son always orders.  All of the other menu items are very good too (pizza, panini, pasta).  My mother in law had the salmon salad and she said it was very good. 

We had excellent service.  We asked for extra Parmesan crisps to be brought out (which are served with the soup) and they brought out extra.  I also had a glass of wine with my salad and beer is served here also. Waitress comes by to refill ice-tea. Chocolate mints are a nice treat that you get with your ""check"" at the end of your meal in case you ordered anything extra.  Leave a tip.

The Cafe is ""Cafeteria style"".  Very simple concept: 

Grab a tray
Stand in line
Place your order-(as you walk thru the line at the various stations)
Order number is placed on your tray
Grab dessert
Order wine/beer
Pay for your food

Fill up your own drinks (unless you order bottled tea)
Find a seat!

During the holidays this is a great place to pick up a nice foodie gift. 

You can buy their signature salad dressings in a package of three (I have some and they are wonderful) or even take home some of the Tomato Basil Soup in a jar (which I have done) but have to admit it tastes better at the Cafe.

The main reason I love coming here is to order the mixed berry chicken salad. Mixed Berry Salad with Chicken has strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, candied walnuts, blue cheese & mixed greens tossed in a raspberry vinaigrette with chicken. I love it. The Nordstrom Cafe at home in Hawaii but it does not carry this salad. The vinaigrette dressing is a bit tart so I like to get it on the side since you never know if the person making the salad has a heavy hand or not. 

Other than that, this place has all my usual Nordstrom Cafe favs like the tomato basil soup. ^_^*~",HuWEj615KvxRmjJq8JY7Ng,3,1,4,itpPoQREUXjaLpj01nDvEw
4271908,2015-01-08,0,ZrXYLXcEcDvYYBErmafobg,"This is by far, my favorite place to eat in the entire mall. It's conveniently located on the top floor of Nordstrom next to the home department. It's reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food you receive and of course, it's delicious. You order your food, walk over to the cashier to pay for it, they give you a number and the server brings your food to the table. Easy concept. 

Back in the day, I worked at Nordstrom so I've had the pleasure of trying everything on the menu. To this day, I still enjoy certain items. Of course, there is the famous tomato basil soup that everyone raves about. It's thick, creamy and flavorful. Paired with the parmesan crostini, it's excellent. I also enjoy their salads. My favorites are the salmon Niçoise, blackened salmon Cesar and the shrimp and arugula salad. All the produce is so fresh and they give you a decent amount of seafood. Their dressings are light and refreshing, not too heavy. And the portions are huge. I've also enjoyed their pizzas. They bake it fresh to order. So it arrives at your table hot and fresh. They have a kids menu which includes items like grilled cheese or small cheese pizza. They also offer small desserts like cookies, lemon or raspberry bars and creme brûlée. All of it, sweet and amazing. 

So whether you need to energize before your shopping trip or refuel after you've finished, this is a perfect spot to come.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,2,1,4,05u6-ACsc4vsrZEeDNtesA

Coming inside at lunch on a Friday, it was a pretty packed.  Although the line eventually got moving, the line would halt for a bit until the manager gave the okay to let more people in because there was no room for seating.  Perhaps a take-out line separate would help a bit here in case people were in a rush.  

The menu selection is not bad - from soups to sandwiches to some entrees and salads, there were definitely options and stations for each of them.  I got the tomato bisque soup (small) and the Chinese chicken salad which came out to be about $15.  The tables were a little messy as they were still trying to get around the busy environment.  The food itself was okay.  The soup wasn't bad although it's not the best tomato bisque and the salad was just okay too - not very flavorful in the dressing and the ingredients not much different from other Chinese Chicken Salads.  There were a lot of drink options including some alcoholic beverages unsurprisingly.

They have $5 grilled cheese sandwiches and some other things that come with soup. The $5 lunch special is actually a kid's special but it is portioned perfectly for an adult-sized lunch, in my opinion. If you wanted something more, they have great salads, pastas, and full-sized portions that are a little more expensive but a good size.

The service is great too! Everyone is nice and even though this isn't a full-fledged restaurant, it feels like a sit-down restaurant because they have bussers who offer to refill your drink and clear your table.

Grilled Shrimp & Arugula Salad w/ Sweet Corn ($12.95): Organic arugula, wild shrimp, petite tomatoes, grilled corn, warm polenta croutons, parmesan cheese crisp, and creamy garlic vinaigrette. Oh my word. What a wonderful salad! The shrimp were plump, delicious, and cooked perfectly. I loved the combination of the ingredients, all tied together with that great vinaigrette. Also? The polenta croutons were such a pleasant surprise - yum! Easily one of the best salads I've had and I'm absolutely coming back for it!

Grilled Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich/Panini ($10.50): Blackened chicken, Jack cheese, roasted red peppers, caramelized onion, avocado, chili pepper aioli, crisp country bread. The sandwich was packed and the flavors were nice. There's even a little kick from the chili pepper aioli. The bread had a nice crust, too. This was served with housemade/kettle chips.

Blueberry Almond Tart ($4.25): Beautiful tart with light flavors and a nice crust. I didn't expect to see pastries and it was a nice treat at the end of my meal.

I am here in the Fashion Show Mall often, so now I have a solid choice for casual dining :)

They had some great Panini sandwiches that were calling my name.   They were surprisingly good actually!  Lots of flavor in the pesto and olive oil...yum!

We finished with the Creme Brulee.  Good rendition here, with a nice crispy layer of goodness hiding the rich custard inside.

Delicious Sandwiches (recommend california with turkey, bacon, avocado and melted cheese)

My friend and I came here to eat lunch (12-27-2014) and this place was packed.... lines out the entrance. After we paid and walked over to find a table, there were several tables that opened up but still had plates. The manager (I am assuming he is a manager because he was one of the two wearing dress shirts) came over, cleaned off the plates and wiped down the table top as well as the seat. Gayle was our server and was very attentive, refilling our coffee, remembering each of our orders and desserts. Also at the end of our lunch, we wanted to pick up our dessert later so we asked her to keep it in the front. 

Returning after shopping to pick up our dessert, I asked the cashier for our cake and was very prompt even though it was busy inside. I saw the manager again bringing food out. My friend and I are restaurant owners and naturally we are very observant when it comes to front and back house/customer service. We were thoroughly impressed how the manager wasn't just delegating to get the task done, but he was jumping in to get things done. You don't see that in Las Vegas corporate restaurants much... at all!!!

I asked the cashier who the gentleman was, and he stated his name is Scott and was the general manager.

When you walk in you see sample displays of the food and place your order at the register and pay. They hand you a number to display at your table and a server will bring you your food. During your meal the servers will refill your drinks and bring any additional condiments that you may want.  Also if you want to order desert or additional food the server can take care of that, no need to fall in line. 

Personally I really enjoy the salads and sandwiches. On many occasions my husband and I will split one of each. Go to sandwiches at the club and the Santa Fe chicken sandwich, for salad I enjoy the cilantro line chicken.  The sandwiches also come with a side of chips.
Meal is concluded with complimentary mint chocolate candies brought by the server.

Skirt Steak:
Comes with asparagus, carrots, potatoes and chimichurri. Get it medium rare or rare since this is a thin piece of meat, otherwise, you'll be gnawing on beef jerky. For $15, you get a pretty nice meal. 5/5

Parmesan-crusted Chicken Salad:
Not the healthiest salad on their menu and it's not the best one either. 3/5

Nicoise Salad with Salmon:
Greens, onions, green beans, hard boiled egg slices, potaoes and salmon. This is what I normally get from here but I never learn my lesson of asking not to put onions, olives and egg yolks. I actually spend time removing these things rom my salad. 4.5/5

Roasted Salmon:
Comes with zucchini, carrots, potatoes and corn. I got extra carrots instead of zucchini. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The veggies were roasted and seasoned. The corn was a bit salty though so, I didn't eat the whole thing. Saved me from having corn stuck in between my teeth. 4/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,6,4,CcXzUwO12Mk7LAB2eIUbIw

The menu selection is above & beyond anything I would have ever expected to come out of a mall. 

The Tomato Basil Soup with the Parmesan Crostini is so delicious. Definitely the best Tomato Basil I've ever had! 

Mixed Berry Salad with Chicken is my favorite salad. It has strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, candied walnuts, blue cheese & mixed greens tossed in a raspberry vinaigrette with chilled chicken. So good. I'm normally not too huge on blue cheese in my salads, because its such a dominant flavor- but with the berries, it neutralizes the sweetness. 

OKAY, & the best part of all...they have Creme Brulee! Very, very good Creme Brulee. Definitely the cherry on top of a great meal! 

Now that I have my own mouth watering, I will stop talking about food & let you know that the service is wonderful! Its kind of self service in the sense that you pay for your food, get your drink & pick a seat. From there- a server will bring your food out to you & refill your drink. I have never met anyone less than pleasant at Nordstrom Cafe- fine dining service in a casual dining environment. 

So next time you find yourself starving while shopping at the Fashion Show- ditch the food court & head over to the 3rd floor of Nordstroms where the cafe is nestled behind the teen clothing section.",4qPsVoJvyu_8cVnrXXxkJQ,3,0,5,0QXzCM9gMM9BiO9mpvFurw

There's a fairly wide variety of things to choose from, from 8-10 salads, 3 pizza options, to 3 pasta options, and 5-6 sandwich items, as well as a variety of desserts to chose from. 

For bargain deals, get the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo (its listed as for kids but they don't care if adults order it :P) The tomato soup is DELICIOUS. It's just so yummy and a perfect pair for the grilled cheese. 

For salads, I personally love the mixed berry and chicken as well as the blue cheese and pear salad. Everything is made to order. 

I don't particularly care for the pizzas, but the wild mushroom pasta is delicious, with a hefty portion!

5503763,2017-07-18,1,ZrXYLXcEcDvYYBErmafobg,"I have a thing for all of Nordy's cafes. How are they so good?! The fries alone are enough to bring me back repeatedly, but then they give you those teeny chocolate mint sticks at the end...and every location carries some different dishes, so I feel like I need to check each one out to see what they have that's special. I see what you're doing, Nordstrom!

They primarily offer soups, sandwiches, and salads, but also pizzas, pastas, and more standard entrées.  Beautiful desserts too! Most of the food feels pretty healthy, and I appreciate that they list calories on the menu. If you experience difficulty determining what to eat go with a salad because I've tried almost all, and they are always fresh and delicious.

When I dined here most recently I just needed a little snack as I was going to dinner in a few hours. I had their (apparently famous) tomato soup. It comes with a garlicky crostini, and the soup is just slightly creamy. I don't like tomato soup on it's own generally, but this was divine. Really. I get why it's famous. I just had a cup, and it was enough to tide me over, but I sure would have enjoyed devouring an entire bowl. My friend had the Shrimp and Arugula Salad. I don't know if this is available exclusively in Vegas, but they don't offer it at my regular Nordstrom (sad face). It comes with magical crispy polenta croutons and a really nice sort of creamy herby dressing. 

Their prices are average, and customer service is decent (not amazing, as you might expect at Nordstrom, but never bad). At this location you get your tray, make your selection, and pay for your meal at once, and then they give you a number and bring your food to you. You can always order additional items from the server, and they will still bring you a check at the end of your meal even if you didn't add anything, so I try to have a little cash with me to use as a tip. They are going for an upscale look at this location, but it's a little dated looking. For dining in Vegas you can't beat the quality or the price.",a4IgqHdva08RBnEV73Qk3g,1,1,5,V-vq1HkyZoyH27IyA2mCSQ

I finished with a giant chocolate dipped macaroon, which was excellent.  Moist and not overly sweet.  I could barely get through half of it.
