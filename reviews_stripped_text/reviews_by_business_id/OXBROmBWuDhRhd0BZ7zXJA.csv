At this point, it has nothing to do with a shot of soju. Am I asking too much? A mere apology for the fact that she knocked over our bottle and spilled ""a shot"" of soju? 

I brought this up to her and all I got from her was, okay I will pay for your loss out of my pocket!

So kind and attentive. They are the type of Kbbq where they come to the table and help you cook. They actually ask if you like things a little more overcook instead of just assuming you'll eat it however they cook it. Also the kimchi is delicious. I always hated kimchi but their kimchi made me into a believer. The meat selection was great and always gracious/kind when we would ask for more sesame oil or seaweed salad. Definitely would come back again to try dinner time and again and again.",XtHLD11D1qvqPmUTDGclhA,1,0,5,P1ma17Hw3l4kkSQS8AIY7A

1346390,2017-02-20,1,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"Terrible experience! My family and I visited the Honey Pig location on Spring Mountain once and weren't impressed. I was craving Korean bbq one night and didn't wanna drive far. So, I thought I'd give this location a shot. Never again!

There were 5 in our party- 4 adults and 1 child. All other Korean bbq places I've been to serve enough food for the table. We initially put in an order of brisket and short ribs for the table to start. They literally brought us ONE serving of brisket... one serving. Barely enough to to feed the child. Unlike other Korean bbq, the server cooks the food, not the guests. They put the 10 thinly sliced pieces of brisket on the burner, left the tongs out of our reach, and took forever to come back. Our food started to burn, so we stood up to grab the tongs and cook it ourselves. We each had 1-2 pieces of brisket. We sat staring and waiting in hunger waiting for more. The short Ribs came. It was 2 4-5 inch long pieces. We realized we had to order by servings at this point. So, we ordered 5 more servings of brisket, more short ribs, 5 servings of shrimp, and other stuff. The server looked at us surprised saying, ""5 serving of brisket?! Like a lot?"" Us- ""yes. A lot. 5 of the plates you brought earlier."" Again, the 2 short ribs cooking and about to burn, so we cooked em ourselves. Took at least 15min for them to bring another platter of brisket. Literally 20 pieces. While waiting, we watched them bring heaps of food, including brisket, to customers that came after us. After finishing off the little food they brought so far, we reminded them that we were still waiting for our 5 orders of shrimp, and we tried to order more brisket. We repeated this last request 5 more times, because they never brought the shrimp or brisket. Fially, the shrimp came. Exactly 5 small barely 2 inch pieces of shrimp. After being there nearly 2hrs, (between the 5 of us to share) we were served 3 servings of brisket, 2 maybe 5 inch pieces of short rib, 2 slices of pork belly, and 5 shrimp. 

Although it is all you can eat, they tallied our orders on the receipt, which showed that that gave us 7 order of shrimp, 10 orders of brisket, 2 orders each of short rib and pork belly. 

The restaurant was less than half full. Others who came after us were served first and seemed to have quicker service and more food. 
I will continue to avoid Honey Pig. Much more worth it to drive to a place that does it right.",-PdUf-V-GyKC--A8hT---w,1,0,1,yyfSNEKTZFB61QUcheOE2A

1664640,2017-04-28,0,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"Went there for my first time and not impress with the food. AYCE (All You Can Eat) during lunch time (17$ 11am-3pm) is kind of whack (limit time AYCE LUNCH  is 1 hour, pretty reasonable I guess), you have very limited options in meat choices compared to Gen KBBQ at the Galleria mall on Sunset Rd (NO SHRIMP OPTION FOR AYCE LUNCH HERE if you want that). And also for the sides (kimchi, rice, and the other etc.) it is nothing like other KBBQ sides, most places have it set and ready for you. Here, you have to order your sides, and its hard to choose because its not much to choose from. This place is kind of quaint unlike other KBBQ Places. However it is convenient for those who live near or close to Eastern Ave. Henderson side who is looking for a KBBQ place to eat. Soda drinks is 2$ and a few change per can (yes, per can). So no free refills! Didn't bother with asking about water because Tea is their complimentary drink and they serve it by the pitcher, honestly its not the best at least for me. The cup for the Tea is small  btw... Oh! Make sure, to request for more extra tiny plates or bowls to put your meats into after cooking it to your liking cause we only had the plate/ bowl looking dish that your tea cup is on when you are assigned to your Table for our meats after we cooked it. If you love your kimchi cold PLEASE advise your server that. I didn't realize till she already dumped it onto our grill that it was the kimchi. My husband just scooped it off litterallly minutes after her putting it on the grill, back into the bowl so it wasn't cooked or heated. All in all, it didn't hurt to try another KBBQ place near us just to see and say we tried  it. But Gen KBBQ is so far our favorite still and worth driving too. To each their own! This was our experience. Service though was okay! Poor server  lady was alone, so for her I give her huge kudos.",v2gDt7_5rhd8e-7BnPw3oQ,0,0,2,avlQsY7Uj15bC2GDpV7GPg

The place was empty on a Saturday night at 7:00pm. Now I see why. They cook the fried rice at the end of the meal which makes no sense at all. Rice DURING the meal is how most eat their meats. Not at the end when everyone is full. If you want rice during, its extra charge. Also, the service is just ok. But then attitudes sort of change when God forbid you ask for more than a couple things..... Like more water filled in the container, or maybe a cup to put the water in, etc. Very disappointed. Will never go back. We love Gen which the food is way better, the service is way better and it's still close, at Galleria Mall. Honey Pig is a waste of money since they took their AYCE away.

1881711,2017-10-09,2,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"We dined in once for a bbq combo rather than AYCE for dinner. However, this review is mostly for the to-go service.
 
For the most part, I occasionally order to-go through UBEReats from here. BIGGEST PET PEEVE is when ordering two entrees, they only give one order of rice, as in rice enough for only one of the entrees. Does that even make sense? It's happened on plenty of occasions to the point I have to make sure I back up rice at home. 

Last night I ordered the bibimbap and beef short rib soup and again, just one rice. It says on the menu that each come with their own rice. Are they that stingy on RICE? Other requests I have such as extra hot pepper sauce or no green onions are easily fulfilled but something that is supposed to be included is incomplete. I'm honestly scared to order more than two items thinking I won't have enough rice for three or four dishes.

On another note the beef short rib soup is heavenly. Tender pieces of meat falling off the bone in a simple but rich beef broth flavored with daikon, mushrooms, green onions, and onions. It came with noodles once but last night's didn't have it..

Bibimbap had mushrooms, lettuce, kosari, zucchini, bean sprouts, carrots and meat plus fried egg. Comes with the hot pepper paste and sesame oil on the side. All toppings come warm or cold. It also came with a side of miso soup which is Korean-style and spicy! There's jalapeno, tofu, zucchini, and onions which was reminiscent of korean soy bean paste soup.

Kalbi and whole chicken in ginseng soup are both okay. Soondubu has been watery and bland at times.

Consistency just isn't there.",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,4,1,3,c5tNfzMLzqkt74v90Fs3Ag

I honestly wasn't too excited because I've had Honey Pig in the past and didn't like it too much but that was at the Spring Mountain location many years ago. We took our seats and started looking over the menu. Everyone was obviously doing the All You Can Eat, we was hungry. The 1st couple of rounds of meats were brought out and cooked for us. And of course we ate them. Everything was good and delicious. Nothing too crazy but already better than my past experiences at Honey Pig. And then the beef rib eyes came out. I was like wow those are some nice looking quality of meats. I was expecting some tiny or decent quality ones but nope and they're AYCE not just order one and that's it. As soon as I ate it and loved it and had to order more. I don't even remember how many I ordered but I just kept ordering and eating. There was one point were everyone said they were done but I wasn't and ordered more. After it was brought out and cooked one of the guys started reaching for some. In my mind I was like ""Yo you'll said you were done. What you doing? This is all mine."" I let them eat their last few and called it quits eventually. 

Anyways I liked everything about this location. Its clean and nice looking. The workers were friendly and quick. They'll cook the food for you if they aren't busy. I love how the cooking surface seems like it doesn't need to be replaced. That's one of my biggest complaints at other KBBQ places I've been to.

We were greeted and seated right away. Since we were the only customers that walked in that night. 
Our host and servers were nice. and they always check on us. 
It was $24.95 for ayce dinner,and even if I really like the service, it still couldn't make up for the food service . The food was a little disappointment, the lack of flavors also they don't have a lot of options for ayce. Just like 5 different things, and the best one would be the short ribs but they limited it only once as a person.  like why? I pay $25 bucks for ayce and yet I can't choose or eat anything freely. Others stuffs are just so plain, (except the marinated roast beef) and such small portion.
They don't have a lot of drinks options either, just fountain drinks or rice tea. 
Also, we felt a little uncomfortable at the end because our server kept staring and waiting for us to be done. Ok we get it you need to close but if you don't allow us to bring any drinks out and we just paid $12 bucks for it then u gonna have to wait for us to finish with it. 
It was a disappointment for us because we were expecting more out of it. It was just one extra star for the service. The place isn't all that, and u can drive a few extra miles for better taste.

The main thing I don't like is that your waiter cooks your meat. I'm used to being in charge of the tongs and cooking my meat according to my liking. We'd grab the tongs and start placing the meat on the grill. Then the waitress would come over and take the tongs back and start moving the meat around. Lol. Only after we asked her, ""Are we not allowed to cook the meat ourselves?"" did she give us the tongs back. Lastly, the fried rice is cooked at the very end after all your meat is grilled. I personally like to enjoy my meat and rice together in a meal, not after I'm already done with the main course. We ended up making our own fried rice off to the side while the meat was cooking and that turned out just the same. If I'm desperately craving KBBQ and I'm in the Henderson area, I'll come here.

The first time the food was excellent and the services was rocky. We attributed this to being a new location and everyone was just getting up to speed. 

The second visit was about three weeks later with the same quality of food but slower service. No big deal still within a few months of opening! Enjoyable but still the service was a big distraction.

Fast forward to today... My wife and father attempted to eat here, but were not even acknowledged by three different servers! (all walked past us to print checks for various departing tables). When we entered there were about 5 un-bussed tables, some with meat still burning on the cooktops. About twenty minutes passed with us waiting to be acknowledged as customers before we simply walked across the street to Hot n' Juicy Crawfish. 

Honey Pig was short staffed and didn't attempt to hide it. A simple greeting from a host of some type would have at least let us know they were interested in getting us a freshly bussed table!

We first asked for the fried rice which they serve at the end of the meal and cook it on the surface where all your delicious meats and kimche cooked on and left little morsels behind giving it an unbelievable infusion of flavor into the fried rice so definitely save room for that little gem of flavor at the end of your meal.

Not much variety in the banchan. You also only get one order of kalbi and jumulluk per person which is kind of disappointing.

So we finally get our water and order our food, we had AYCE and the food was good.

3893978,2018-04-18,0,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"Early and often during the first year of our relationship, my girlfriend and I would frequent Honey Pig. She had never tried Korean BBQ, so ""Honey Pig!"" became our battlecry after long weeks or major life events to celebrate. As time passed (but the restaurant continued to celebrate its ""Grand Opening""), the quality of service became schizophrenic and unpredictable. Asking for food became a chore and the cooking of food by staff felt unnecessary and burdensome. Staff routinely overcooked some items by not tending to the heat properly, and I began fighting for the tongs between rounds.

Our disappointment with Honey Pig climaxed around the holidays. With family in town, my girlfriend and I called ahead to reserve a table for a large group. The staff accepted our reservation and we showed up promptly for service. There was no table and the staff attempted to sit six full-grown adults at a table for four. It was obvious that the staff had just seated a group of six at a table intended for us. I objected to the four person table and we proceeded to wait thirty minutes for a second table. Despite the reservation and frequent visits (we're confident they recognized us), I was furious and that was the last time we ate at Honey Pig.

My biggest concern? I'm not entirely sure who is in charge here. Not once after nearly a dozen trips to Honey Pig has an owner or manager ever greeted us. That's unacceptable and such absent-ness is beginning to show. No one has ever asked about our meal. No one has ever asked for feedback. The staff is careless and unobservant (other than one or two persons) and I was so upset after that debacle around the holidays. I was so embarrassed for my family.

They try to cook for you but then leave for a while then we tried to cook our meat because it started to get burnt then that's when the lady would come to the table.

Uhh, if you don't want your meat tasting like lemon ask for a whole new grill!! After she ""cleaned"" off the char with lemon she continued cooking our meat. We couldn't finish the rest..the taste was off and not appetizing. Other than that, the place was decent. I'd go back but next time I'm saying NO to lemon lol.

4108280,2016-10-16,4,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants used to be confined to Spring Mountain, so it's nice to have one of them open up a place close to Henderson.

I actually live closer to our local location of Gen, but Honey Pig was more impressive when I tried their first Las Vegas location. I was excited to hear that they were coming to the fun part of Eastern Ave with so many other restaurants, and I went with friends to try it after work on Friday night. It's on the south side of the huge plaza, just across an alleyway from Big 5 Sporting Goods.

We were seated quickly, but despite the relative lack of customers, the server took a lot of time to start our grill and take our order. So yeah, there might still be kinks with the training or staffing level; fortunately, we weren't in a hurry. We wanted to do the all you can eat dinner ($24.95) after all, which means spending enough time to stuff yourself.

The cooking was about as attentive as I experienced before, with the meats started but not necessarily finished (so pull the meats yourself before they get overcooked). Still, it's better than some places which just bring the meats out and leave all the cooking to you. The meats were about as impressive as I recall at the original location, with pork belly being a standout and pork neck also impressive. The beef brisket was fine and the kalbi (beef short rib) was tender and delicious, but bulgogi (listed as marinated roast meat) wasn't special in the slightest. Also wasn't a fan of the spicy chicken ""boneless rib"" or the shrimp (which as we saw is prone to overcooking), but the spicy squid was nice for its texture.

As for the other actual food, the side salad was fresh and rather addictive, the kimchi was a little on the sweet side (alright for me, but not palatable at all to my tablemates), the bean sprouts were fine (and interestingly textured when overdone to a crisp), and the banchan were very different from the Spring Mountain location but still great. The eggplant was my favorite, the pickled daikon was also delicious, and the spicy beans and the tofu were good too. And servers were quite attentive with refilling the iced barley tea. I should note that only the salted sesame oil and the sweet dipping sauce were available (the original location had a paste that I don't recall using that often).

Despite not having as varied a menu as its competitors, this new location of Honey Pig is a delicious spot to stuff your stomach with meat. I'd probably go back for lunch if I could ($17.95 with only shrimp and beef short rib excluded as meats), but dinner would work as well. Oh, and it's certainly more nicely decorated and lit than the other Honey Pig.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,10,4,dd7biUmglAfM5jfCPthg_w

I had to request AYCE menu, kind of like they were hiding it because the girl up front gave me the standard large menu. Price for AYCE $26.98. 

- ordered large steamed eggs al la carte, around $10 - SKIP. Taste gross. Not even sure it was properly steamed. 

- ran out of Japjay (spell check...clear stir fried noodles). 

- restaurant offers warming kimchee on bbq grill, I wasn't a fan. Cold taste way better. 

- bean sprouts didn't taste good. 

- salad was okay.

The employees were all very helpful and it was great that when they passed by, the servers would stop and help flip the meat and veggies that were currently on our grill.

Setting: situated in the busy parking lot with BJs, hot n juicy, brew tea bar, and taco y taco there are a lot of places to dine. Inside is decently spaced and well ventilated.

Service: props to the manager(Jihye)  for busting her ass while some of the other servers were just taking it easy.  Do yourself a huge favor and cut the weak links because it's destroying your flow.

Food: the quality of meats here are pretty bad. I think you can go to the Asian market and pick up better pork belly than the ones here. The grills don't filter out the fats and juices that well so it just cooks with the meat making it look steamed than caramelized. Also I've never seen carrots inside of bean paste soup and that's just not how it's prepared. Got the soon dae guk which tasted store bought.

4934764,2017-01-07,3,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"Love having an authentic Korean BBQ place in Henderson.  Here is what I like and don't like about Honey Pig...

What I like:
1. They do have an AYCE eat menu with about 10 different most popular meats you can order. There is a limit to the Kalbi, Bulgogi, so that is a bit of a shame.

2.  The quality of meat is good, not overly marinated so all of you that are used to really flavored and marinated cuts of meat please be aware.

3.  Cooking - The attendants will come by frequently to make sure that you have everything well cooked and pushed to side when it is cooked.

4.  The Kim Chi - Love that they lop all this in huge heaps right on the actual cooktop.  I never had heated Kim Chi before and it is good.

5.  Staff and Service - Very nice and friendly overall.  Place is busy, we went on a Tuesday night and it was packed and mostly with what seemed to be Korean families, so they must know where to go...

6.  Private rooms - They have two tables in a semi private area that can seat about 10 on each table, or about 20 altogether.  Not bad for a small party.

7.  Bang for the buck - AYCE is 24.95.  I think it is overall a good deal. Just order properly so that the food comes out at the right time.

What I think can improve:
1. For the AYCE, a limit of one order of the Kalbi and Bulgogi is a bit unfortunate and it is actually, one strip for each.  Normally, an order is larger than one strip.

2.  Busy - Whey they are busy, the service is slow and the meat during the AYCE comes out fairly slow.  They also ""forget"" to bring out some of the meats like the Kalbi.  Slow service at an AYCE place is sort of like buying a Ferrari and driving at 15 mph.  Let's face it, you are gonna get full and order less.

3.  Service - Asking for things when they are busy is tough. They won't look at you or look your way, so you have to be quite intentional and speak up, interrupt, be noticeable or chase them down to get what you want. 

It is hard to compare this to somewhere like Gen at the mall.  Gen is a systemized franchise place that is similar but marketed and designed for the suburban tastes in decor and service.  Most people will prefer Gen, its service, menu, choices.  I am not even sure if there is a limit.  Honey Pig is also a franchise but it seems to market itself as mom and pop.  The decor is much more Korean in style and it portrays to be a small business.

For authentic Korean BBQ, I do like Honey Pig, but I am not totally sold on the bang for the buck over Gen.  I will be coming back to test it out. 

Good enough for 3.5 stars.  I will be back to try their normal food as that does look pretty good.  Not sure if I am ready to bring friends here on a regular basis.

Environment: When I used to live on the other side of town I used to go to the location of Honey Pig at Spring Mountain all the time. That location is open 24 hours and was perfect for a late-night craving of Korean BBQ. However, now that I live in Henderson, I rarely get around to that side of town much anymore, which makes it perfect that there is a new location of Honey Pig located on Eastern in Henderson now as well. The interior is obviously nicer and newer than the other location and offers a variety of seating from booths to tables to more private areas

Food: I rarely ever get All you can eat at Honey Pig and I usually opt for a set. The set comes with meat, fried rice, salad, soup, etc. and I am usually too full to finish everything which brings the cost to lower than that of all you can eat but I always still leave satisfied. Additionally, the set comes with a drink which is perfect since I always get beer and soju here anyway. There a variety of sets to choose from which have various meats and are designed to serve various numbers of customers, so they would be perfect to split between 2 people or for bigger groups around 5 to 6.

Service: Service is consistent here as well. The workers are sure to check up on you as well as get you any additional sides that you may need. Another point that I like about this restaurant is that the servers all make sure to help you cook and cut the meat, ever if they are not necessarily assigned to your section in the restaurant which I think is nice because sometimes you may be busy talking with your friends or drinking to even notice that it is the appropriate time to flip the meat or that it is ready to eat.

Disappointing,zsJLk34mTDMyuVS_EaBLxw,0,0,3,GXHvbAyEjQQ6rIk5aSAxHA

5338407,2016-12-08,2,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"I was extremely disappointed. I am from LA. I'm very spoiled by K-Town. But we always give all KBBQ places a chance. The service was fantastic. They work so hard. I hope they get paid fair wages and keep their tips. We didn't like the meat selection and it's quality. The ban chan selection was poor. They didn't have rice paper or radish or lettuce leaves. A place like this would be $7.99 for lunch with what they offer. So the prices are too high for what you get. I never like chains and I know Honey Pig is one, but if you're going to go to a chain, go to @Gen KBBQ",RKcvUwivI0x3BG6DdyXPVw,3,0,2,lgNm82jVCFKAJuBIXqz61g
5434710,2018-06-20,3,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"I usually come here with my buddies for AYCE. We always have left full, satisfied, and in our wake, a restaurant booking numbers in the red.

The AYCE menu is short, but sweet with some meats that we'll order multiple times during a visit. Our favorites are the ribeye (we'll each order a steak), brisket, and the short rib. We've never questioned the quality and the open kitchen allows us to see our meat being sliced. Don't forgot to place your meat in a lettuce wrap and add some jalapeno and garlic to give that crunch and extra boost of flavor. Yes, they do cook the kimchi and the bean sprouts on the grill, but the beautiful thing a about Korean BBQ is that if that's not your preference, you're free to pull it off the grill anytime you want.

The grills are large and ceramic which means that you can fit more food on your grill and that it does not need to be changed frequently. The down side is the grill does not reach the high temperatures of a metal grill and you won't get that hard sear on the meat. The ventilation is also not the best and all my wife has to do is get a whiff when I get home and there won't be any questions of where I've been.

Even though we work them over, the servers have always taken care of us. They'll cook for us when they're not busy and will always keep up with our orders to make sure we can eat continuously and don't have an empty bottle of Soju or Cass in front of us. Props to them for telling us not to order certain items such as the special kimchi which we may not find appetizing, and also always offering to finish our meal with rice on the grill.

When I'm with the family and not hogging out, their dinner sets will do the trick and provide plenty of variety and food. Although a different atmosphere and less selection, I'd put Honey Pig on the same rung as the other Korean BBQ in Henderson and gives us a viable option depending on what we're in the mood for.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,3,3,4,xjlT2kOQclifQi0iP543yg

After eating all the meat and side dishes, they make fried rice and brought us soybean paste soup and steamed eggs! Now that was a surprise! It was so delicious!

5515790,2017-08-21,18,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"We got there before the dinner rush, so service was pretty swift and we got our food onto the grill really fast. Our server Nikki was friendly and on top of things for the most part. 

Instead of the combo sets, the 3 of us decided to go with the $26.99 AYCE since there was a lot of protein items we wanted to try. 14 items total, including spicy shrimp and spicy squid!

Orig we wanted to go with the $50 beef combo (galbi, brisket and bulgogi for 2-3 people) plus an aka carte order of pork belly ($26), but decided that the AYCE option was way better because we could try out more meats for the same price.

We pigged out on marinated galbi, beef brisket, pork belly and spicy squid. 
Everything was delicious and seasoned really well. We were especially pleasantly surprised that the spicy squid was actually a whole giant squid, tentacles and all! So tender and meaty, if I wasn't so full I'd another a second serving of squid...

They offered to cook fried rice on your grill after your meal, using your leftover meats and kimchi. It's included with the price of your meal, but we declined since we were stuffed. 

My friend got a couple of green tea ice cream macaroons for dessert ($3.50 each). He ate both, lol.

Overall a tasty experience. A great new addition to Henderson!",lsSiIjAKVl-QRxKjRErBeg,25,21,4,EVO7SEcYEVLmaeEmWN4mVw

2. . Not impressed with the service. Servers tryna help you cook lol personally I don't like it. It's like invading privacy and they don't even ask permission and also it makes it AWKWARD for customers while the servers are in front of you cooking and then they just leave and then come back again~cook and then leave. 

3. Servers asks you for drinks, right? So we ordered soda and water but it didn't came unless you ask for it. 

4. We ordered soup but it didn't came as well LOL unless you ask for it AGAIN. 

Location is okay. A bit pricey. Food is okay, I rather drive 10 more miles than to eat here. Haha! We just tried it cos we live like few blocks from this restau. 

Again, for servers. Please try to be more friendly. You guys are the frontrow, you carry the restaurant :)",tWdxJY3Yn4tEK8gv1-beGA,0,0,1,-yCC0MSRiPs8ae2_ua8g0Q

Used to love to come here with local friends for the AYCE option. Quality was about average compared to other AYCE, but very convenient being in Silverado Ranch area. 

Was very disappointed to find out that they pulled their AYCE menu. Combo options have the same quality food at about 2-3x the price. A la carte options are good, but not worth the price. 

I'll head to Doh on Rainbow/Windmill for my fix now - way better food and well worth the extra drive.",MQ7BoAs7XWXeuJPmiMa0aw,2,0,1,65P2fuy6SG83PjwiEGysBQ
5720907,2017-07-24,1,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,Can I just please say so much yum!! Give me more of this stuff!!! I love where I live. So close to so many good food places... Eastern is a prime location for food. First time goes to Honey Pig Bbq. Korean BBQ has to be one of my most favorite styles of cooking/food to eat.  We walked in and got greeted promptly. There was 3 of us and a toddler. They sat us in the corner which was a good spot when you have a gremlin with you. We got situated and they brought over a high chair. Scanned the menu and I am a firm believer of stick to what you know... I'm not the adventurous eater type unless it's free! I mean that makes sense right?? So back to menu browsing.. bulgogi and short ribs are my go to! Short ribs ran for about $34.99 and bulgogi ran for $29.99 a little bit on the pricier side BUT wow was their quality of meat so delicious!! I am not regretful what so ever. We also ordered a bottle of Pinot noir with our meal. They brought all the normal sides including kimchi my favorite and a big bowl of salad for the table. So great they provided this for us. Everything tasted so great and I think I found my new Korean BBQ spot especially since it's literally a 3 mins drive away !,_yEXH2SP25G12gVjni5IJg,2,2,5,P7hQiI_ul8PGn94BV4Prag

5765260,2017-10-15,1,OXBROmBWuDhRhd0BZ7zXJA,"This is their new location, looks clean overall compare to the one in Chinatown. Their style may be different than most of Korean bbq places you've been. Server will come cook and cut meat for you and at the end they will bring rice to make fried rice when you're already stuffed with all the meat so if you want your rice to eat with meat in the beginning, you'll have to ask them to bring it first. 

The bulgogi is really sweet for my taste, the spicy chicken - said my Brazilians  ""its really spicy!"". Well I'm Thai and Koran spicy is like our dessert lol. My fav is the brisket, dip in bean paste and grilled garlic+jalapeño!

3 star because their price and the quality of meat for a la cart.",a3yOeL5b0lzbo1ORHF2yHg,1,1,3,xlJv4me4wUYRUxSRa3xfuA

Wasn't too busy, only 3 other tables occupied. Very nicely decorated place, with several tables all with cooking grills and ventilation. 

Perusing the menu, prices were a bit high for my liking. The AYCE options for lunch were a bit confusing. I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to get. I decided to instead go with a lunch box Kalbi, for $14.99, which ended up being plenty of food.

Everything was tasty and cooked right. No complaints for the food and quality. Service was quick and attentive. I did watch her help out some KBBQ rookies and all seemed good there.

Just recently a family member and I went to eat at Honey Pig and I was informed that they got rid of their all you can eat menu.  Initially, I was irritated but decided to stay. I am so glad I did. For a 2-3 ppl Beef Combo (which includes brisket, sirloin, marinated meet, and fried rice along with the side dishes) it only cost $30. You are allowed to take your leftovers home too. 

The all you can eat was about $25 per person and you can't take home your leftovers.
