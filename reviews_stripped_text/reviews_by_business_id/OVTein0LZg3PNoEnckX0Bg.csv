I usually order my FAV iced coffee,  the ""Iced Carmel Latte"" with almond milk and at times I extra shot it. It's a must to get 24 or 32 oz. Because if your going to treat yourself you should always go big or well you know. Today Mimi (one awesome girl) handed me a new iced coffee to try along with my order. I had to jump on here and give a shout out and review this sweet tropical tasting little treat of paradise. If your a coffee fanatic as I this coffee drink gives you that summer iced tropical coconut burst with the sweet dipped taste of the Carmel drizzle. It's refreshing with that light back taste of coffee, if you want more of that coffee taste with that tropical indulgence ask for that extra shot.

1827652,2018-06-29,0,OVTein0LZg3PNoEnckX0Bg,"I have one word for you. PEET'S COFFEE IS THE BEST COFFEE IN TOWN. End of story. Somehow a 24 oz cup at this coffee bean was smaller than a 20 oz cup from Peet's. Huh? The staff are friendly and service is quick, which is why the 2 stars. But after getting iced drinks at Peet's I realized what a jack this CB is. All the iced drinks are 3/4 ice and 1/4 coffee drink. It's cold but a $6 latte should last longer than 4 small sips. At Peet's they put just enough ice in to cool it but still give you your $$ worth. And the quality of coffee is so much better at Peet's it's ridic. I tried a croissant at CB once and it tasted like it was 3 days old and possibly used as a soccer ball during slow times of day. By comparison a chocolate croissant at Peet's was flaky, warm, delish, tasting like it came from a gourmet French bakery. CB charges gourmet prices for ghetto products. The only place CB may be better than is Dunkin Donuts, which is a pretty low bar. And somebody needs to inform CB corporate that the up-sell at the drive through is super obnoxious. When I say I just want a drink and that's all, stop asking if I also wouldn't like a sandwich or banana or salad with my coffee. I don't leave my house not knowing what I want at all, somehow end up at a CB dt and then figure it out with their help. Annoying the crap out of the customers isn't good service, it's completely disingenuous and not authentic. It makes me want to throw my coffee at the person handing it to me at the window. Good riddance to crappy coffee and excessive customer service. At Peet's they're genuinely friendly, the coffee is bomb, and they give me what I ask for, no more and no less. I wish they would demolish this location and build a Peet's. Did I mention Peet's is the best?;-)",_kQkkZUKOmJBD6t0CA-eHQ,0,0,2,QHzGrk1eLTpzfFs30YuDgA

I'd say that a Coffee bean staff make better coffee nowadays than many popular coffee shops. The place has its owning parking that you can use if you plan to stay for more than 20 mins. It also has great table on which to study, which I always do. One little remark however that it gets too cold inside sometimes, even if the weather is 80 degrees outside. Hence, my recommendation is: ""grab a jacket or a hoodie, when you go there and plan to study"". Would go there again.",P2NKGT1bKC9b5rs_HcvQOg,1,0,5,svkdUAuKAOhzNWFivkIXpw

A brand NEW, EXTRA SPACIOUS Coffee Bean with great service; inviting seating areas inside and outside! 
- If you like Coffee Bean, you'll love this particular one!

YELPIER DETAILS:
- One afternoon, I was actually heading for Starbucks on Sahara and Fort Apachi, but the way to Starbucks was blocked and I was forced to make a left turn in the parking lot, and was totally surprised to spot a brand new Coffee Bean, with people sitting in its huge, attractive, covered patio with high ceilings and ceiling fans! I ventured in and was cheerfully greeted by the barista! I really loved this place with its bright, spacious, comfortable setup! The lounge has huge pic windows looking out into its gorgeous patio and streets!

More importantly, its staff here was exceptionally friendly and cheerful! One of the staff even offered to carry the order of an elderly customer to his table! Good training! The young lady manager was also busily helping out and greeting customers around her, making customers feel welcome! I like that in a boss! The drinks and food items were up to normal standards, as expected! 
- The main door to the restrooms was tastefully ""hidden"" behind a wall paper! The men's room was large, equipped with no touch forcet, and kept super clean!

I really love this place and will start coming here more often! Give it a try, you'll like it!

 I came because there's good seating here and it gives me room to do work. But I didn't care for my drink.  
I love cappuccinos and I love the red velvet hot chocolate but I don't know what happened back there during this ""rush"" but it wasn't good.  I've worked in a coffee shop before and it didn't seem like something you could mess up, but it is what it is.  At least I had coffee before work today.

I felt like an having an iced tea.
They must have had fifteen kinds of tea:
Black teas, herbal teas, tropical blend, etc.
I asked the girl behind the counter, to choose one for me.
However, I chose my doughnut, myself. 
Very good and not very expensive.
The only problem is, that if your inside, the constant use of the blender can be quite annoying.
There's a small patio outside, which isn't as loud, but when it's 100+ degrees out, then I'm not too keen about sitting outside.

The reason we come here is for the wonderful pastries (they're the only coffee bean that carries some of the same ones we used to get in California) and of course the coffee and tea is MUCH better than the ""other"" franchise.

The wifi is awful and the place is overrun with parents and kids. The parents are fine, but the kids are usually small and loud. It's Summerlin and I'm used to it, but I don't like it.

The wifi was both slow and not capable of working with my chrome browser. That's unacceptable and I won't return any time soon...which is a shame.

The outdoor seating and club chairs inside are very comfortable. Rather than deal with kids and non-working wifi I'll take my coffee work time elsewhere. There are coffee joints every 10 seconds you drive around here.",R_uxlSD2MMkNwA8ers0DhQ,2,0,2,HPRLYWsn0WVhSU994970Dg
