1132645,2016-12-07,1,UhyDVz7npxKUl9BfMpfmBw,Who would have thought I'd find Rosarita Beach street tacos in a legacy Las Vegas shopping mall? The carne has that crisp edge but tender inside. The cilantro and flavoring is the right balance and you can adjust the heat with your pick of salsa. The traditional corn double tortilla that wraps it adds a bit of sweet to combine with the other distinct tastes. They choose quality ingredients to create this masterpiece. It takes a while. It's not exactly fast food but it is worth checking your email for a bit until they finish your meal just for you. I haven't tried their other dishes but I'm considering going back to the mall just to eat.,mwYVPvK93YcOzE2H6i-uNw,3,1,5,EzIkuyC4mg41jA_7l7m30g

Their aquas are fresh and actually made in house. They're not the powder types that you find at most places. Definitely will be checking out their other locations! Fresh food in the middle of the mall is like a miracle, and they're it. Their prices are good for the portions you get.

The only thing that kinda disappointed me was their sauce . The green sauce tastes almost like nothing, the red one Is kinda spicy  . I think they should work more on their sauces as well. For me , tacos are not that good if the sauce is not as well . La salsa le da ese toque . But overall great lengua burritos and affable service .",uqONX59JXCRwly9rzcYGBA,0,0,3,V4BsRJQ9ajdU4QQQn6UfYQ

This is the 2nd time this place has messed up an order for our office and trust me there will not be a third time. The first time we ordered a burrito and simply requested no sour cream, beans, or avocado. They literally have us a shell just full of meat nothing else. And this time i was over charged for 2 burritos. We only ordered 2 single burritos and a burrito meal. 3 in total. I guess my fault for not checking the receipt because i was charged for 5 and clearly the ticket that prints for them to make the food only had 3 on it. I tried to call to tell them they over charged and no one answers. I called for almost a whole hour. There is no purpose for them to have a number listed. We also ordered 2 lemonades that were gross. We get them all the time and today was terrible. And a coworker ordered carne asada fries that literally have about 5 pieces of meat. A total waste of money on lunch.

4014400,2017-04-03,2,UhyDVz7npxKUl9BfMpfmBw,"I'm a HUGE fan of Carne Asada Nachos and I've more than had my share.  So of course I had to try the new Frijoles in the Meadows Mall food court.  Seemed like a better choice than Taco Bell!

Was a quick lunch with the wifey during a weekday work break.  Good thing about Frijoles is that the line went fast, orders were coming out just as fast too.  I like the fact that I can order the type of meat I want with my nachos - and they do have some nice choices:

*Carne Asada
*Pollo
*Carnitas
*Al Pastor
*Camaron (extra charge)
*Pescado
*Lengua (love me some tongue!)
*Cabeza (get you some head!)
*Vegetarian (most likely bell peppers & onions)

I went with my favorite type of nachos - CARNE ASADA.  Gots to go with the steak!  Order took less than 12 minutes to come out ready to go.  We were eating there so thankfully my Carne Asada Nachos weren't soggy when I opened the box.

Overall these nachos were just OK.  The box isn't as hefty as I'm used to when going to other Mexican fast food joints.  Seemed a bit light in fact!  I opened up the container and it looked great - layer of chips, serving of grilled carne asada, cheese, beans, guacamole, sour cream & pico de gallo.  I also asked for jalapenos on the side along with some of their red and green salsas.  I didn't really like that at Frijoles they were heavy handed with the beans.  I want MEAT, easy on the filler!  The carne asada portion of my nachos were on the smaller side, it was grilled nice & was tasty.  It was light on the cheese too.  Just not enough of it to go around!  I want meat & cheese on every chip!  The guac was fresh though & so was the pico de gallo.  Frijoles red and green salsas were yummy too.  

I'd come back to Frijoles again especially given the choices at the Meadows Mall food court.  Price for the nachos weren't bad, around $8 and change.  I just was hoping for more meat & cheese on them.  Nachos should be messy goodness!!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,3,3,6wjoKvagVFHOoUyCDMp9dA

The food court in the Meadows Mall is continuously evolving. I  stumbled across this yummy spot while waiting in line at another restaurant. I was sold at Mexican Street Corn and at $2.25 a piece I doubled up! The wait was short and the corn was excellent. I love the fresh off the grill taste and I'll definitely be back for another double dose of Street corn!

My watermelon Aqua Fresca was mainly just sugar and over all for over $10 I wasn't satisfied and didn't finish the taco it was greasy and had weird peppers and over all I just was left wanting for the cost .

The photos look good but I was not a fan . I'm giving two stars because it tasted fresh even if not yummy",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,4,2,2,oFG4LmXrVGddECLQ-y9IFg

I think this is a local business; it looks like there are only two locations, both in Vegas.

It may become my new favorite.  I simply had the mini vegetarian street taco and it was so good. I want to go back for the corn and to try something else.  For it being in the mall I was very surprised and can't wait to go to the one by my house.

I never ate here, but I decided to try it out.
This is the second this happens to me.
On my first visit, I got a burrito de carne asada at 4811 S Rainbow Blvd. location. 
I only ate half of the burrito and then I had the runs, but no stomachache.
Today, second time giving this a try, I'm having the same issue, but worse! Stomachaches. 
The cashier was not so friendly, but she is just a kid! What does she know about customer service if she never learns.
I called to complain. The manager Jazmin was nice and understanding. The issue was not fixed.
Anyways, thank you for the food. It was delicious for my tastebuds but my stomach never wants to come back again.",Vy8nLrx3DU8KV2j0E37F6g,0,0,1,rMxaVSG5hLDWty3ZYJtd7g
