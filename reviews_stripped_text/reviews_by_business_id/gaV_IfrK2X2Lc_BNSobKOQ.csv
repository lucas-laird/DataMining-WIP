This has happened twice in a row, and I don't know how much longer I would have been waiting because I ended up driving off before my order was even taken. It's these two guy workers in particular that make this subway horrible. As someone who cane weekly and never had a single complaint. I will never come to this subway again!",fdXwtijj7Qt2Kfs5MhRgDQ,0,0,1,mIrS1iRLUQOsfpXGzSbT_w

Loved how the place was spotless and everything was stocked and ready to start the day fresh. Amazing customer service who helped me pick out a good sandwich, to try decided to get the oven roasted wrap with cucumbers and spinach. Went and checked out the restrooms they were clean and well maintained.",ymfXldDYJ5NZmCBqr-oWSg,0,0,5,vX9T4v7ldnyNGlKOlg0MSA

Small Subway, hella ghetto workers, but what can you do? My son and I love spinach and turkey subs so this is where we went after LVAC. We were starving and of course they had their 5$ footlongs. The place is in a funky location right across from Starbucks. The parking hella sucks, but they do have a drive through and spinach! We went in around 8ish and there was like 4 pieces of bread left.... the one I got was flat and limp.... kinda like others things Ive had : (

The girls working were like cholas and looked high, whatever just give me a yummy sandwich! I had a simple one, she made it, and we left. The place was clean and they used gloves.

Ill def come back for a turkey with spinach on normal bread this time!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,1,0,3,sQnVok8AD8uu1qWV7FlXOQ

There is a drive-thru so that's a plus!
One more request, please offer ORGANIC juice boxes and milk boxes please. Dump the Minute Maid brand, I am going to Starbucks across the street for organic drinks and the drive-thru.",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,0,0,3,WZp5hohb-6siXgWtg_NcEQ

Now the taste wasn't great, the avocado doesn't taste fresh. The Bacon doesn't have any taste. All in all, one of the reasons I stopped going to Subway.",9HZSqrJhVZkjJxKVaOICbg,1,0,2,Z46xLK1UewZ1WOofzTsqqw
