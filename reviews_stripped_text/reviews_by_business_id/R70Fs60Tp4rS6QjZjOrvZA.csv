I waited five minutes for the bartender to take my drink order, another 10 minutes to get a menu, and I left when after another 15 minutes my order still hadn't been taken. The bartender was too busy talking to someone at the end of the bar that appeared to be a co worker or the manager to notice anything else. She didn't even notice when I left. I didn't tip and I won't go back.",xt7pw_E5u6L4BV-_wDor4Q,0,0,1,U7-PCrsdGnlU0LakEna26w

The brisket was fatty and disappointing. 6 small strips for $18 and the flavor of liquid smoke is all I could taste. 

Very disappointing.",fHg6TfYRQ2X00jyOMH08fA,0,0,2,P8HqPb6ZixLTItj2A0J4Rw

It would be a fine place for a group of dudes to stop in to pound a few drinks before hitting the Strip but other than that no thanks.",eODR-dX3pIFAI6Ui3DL7nQ,0,0,2,4WEQHYb2zxjiIAjHQyQRSg

That's Vegas..  The pizzas and the salads were wonderful.",-gi3QTLxpER5LqqPXYEsMw,0,0,4,8DZ7sAB50PE-HSwK0LU7TA

I was completely wrong.  We walked in to nobody in the main dining area and 3 people in the bar. We decided to join those in the bar and i have to say, it was a pleasant surprise the bar tender came over and made us some awesome drinks. We then ordered The BBQ Chicken Pizza since well.... You can't mess up pizza. Not only was this pizza not messed up, it was Amazing... When the bill came from the very nice waitress we paid it and then asked the bartender if we could square up with him as well and he said the drinks are on the house.. Now i dont know about you but anytime i go to a Bar and the last words I hear before I leave are, "" ITS ON THE HOUSE"". I think I found a winner.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,2,2,4,u3gEy9XLRgzlR5zJeByaDQ
