Why would a company stop selling one of the best sandwiches ever made?  I was so disappointed this morning when I had to eat the buffet because I was too hungry to go somewhere else, considering I was in Baker, CA.  The food was disgusting.  I hate Bob's BB.  They need to bring back that sandwich or just close the place.",hpCzVAHcProjoL_QieDRwg,0,0,1,gh_nD6VCqBOfhQKqvrQq4Q

I've got to say this has got to be one of the best food places to cure any kind of hangover. Seriously, you need to order the potato pancakes...Their servings are just right to fill you up!",ldZNTSlq85UGg4n11mfDiA,2,0,4,Vlq8gNtAwV8vhPZjfheDeQ

The fries..eh....so so. How do you really f*ck up fries. It wasn't bad. I was just so so ....Arrrrgghhh. This isn't Bob's Big Boy! 
This is a consipiracy. Bob is being held captive by terrorists! Please GIVE BOB BACK....All we are saying is Give Bob a CHANCE!

I'm bummed I didn't get to try the Big Boy in time...but then again it's hard to argue with convenient donuts in the 'hood.,WpLDTv1dx5419PDHI1VpeQ,2,1,1,zkCKy3rnkjNSCD6eaS_ywQ
