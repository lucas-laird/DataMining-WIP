Not sure if she was amused at my response or she was being polite.  So i told the Asian lady ""was that you that took my order?"" She said ""yes"" i replied ""oh next time you should say something because i wasnt sure you heard me and it just went silent."" She said ""oh, sorry.""  rolling her eyes.

2036375,2015-05-06,1,4pxK5njPxYHFp7IMEch1Bw,"Wendy's is a fine enough fast food chain. I like that they have salads and baked potatoes, so if I'm not feeling like a burger and fries, I can still eat here on the run. And when it comes to burgers, their's aren't too terrible. In fact, I'd say they're better than other nationwide fast food chains. The fries are alright too. Hint: Get the ranch dipping sauce - it makes the fries even better. And, of course, there are the frosties. Special tip: Get a mini chocolate frosty and a mini vanilla frosty and mix them together. They also now offer ghost pepper fries. While tasty, they are basically just cheese fries with chopped jalapenos on top. If there were any ghost peppers involved, I didn't taste them. The fries were not spicy at all.

This particular location is...well...somewhat of a mess. Whether it's drive-thru or the counter inside, there's lots of miscommunication, incorrect charges, and inexplicable wait times.

I pull up and wait. During my fifteen minute wait for a chicken sandwich five cars have since pulled through gotten their food instantly and gone about their nights.
