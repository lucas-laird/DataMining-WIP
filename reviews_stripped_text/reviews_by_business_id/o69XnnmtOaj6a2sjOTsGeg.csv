It had about 10 customers when i walked in to which the establishment looked to accommodate 30 people. The menu has a variety of offerings. I ordered the shortest capastrami sandwich with a bottle soda. The combination of ingredients were outstanding. Great balance of the amount of meat, veggie and dressing. I left still feeling hungry so you might want to grab a bag of chips or longer sandwich to fill you up. Nice location and easy to find. The pace of service is average which i thought can be improved.",x1EGW33ATKhiSVyQBzhPgw,0,0,4,E8JfpH7ZpK89kb4C3b0qOg

Tonight I considered ordering food from Capriotti's using post mates until I saw a $17 delivery fee. So I called in and pre ordered because my whole family is getting over a stomach bug and I just wanted to get in and out as quickly as possible. I ordered a cold turkey sandwich (as per the label on post mates), A bobbie with no cranberry, a child turkey and cheese and chicken noodle soup. I got home and I had a Cole Turkey (my fault) and a medium Bobbie with cranberry. Not knowing about the cole turkey I called and very nicely explained that the majority of my order was wrong. The blonde that works annoyingly schooled me on what the cole turkey was and that it would be no problem if I got back into the store by eight to remake my sandwiches. I get it its close to closing time but she felt the need to point the sandwiches I order out on the board call me babe (if you work in customer service you know babe is not something you say) and I got barely any turkey on both remakes and no mayo on the Bobbie (I checked to make sure that it comes with that.) What upset me the most was her calling me babe thats weird.",gpH-fNMP43JNh4iczmEPPg,0,0,3,hrOrmlAHMdmpTVB7r1XIYg

I've never ever in my life eaten a sandwich without condiments.. lol. not joking.. even bbq pork sandwiches I put mayo & mustard on.. lol. I can't stand dry food.

The only difference in visiting one location than another is the seating area.   Service is always fast and staff comes off as genuinely kind and welcoming.  It's no surprise they make best of Vegas every year.  Always a weekly stop for lunch and will always be a suggested to somebody that crazily enough may not have eaten here before.,o6XUlFGs0mM0sIB9BMewlA,1,0,4,IIpQCLsr6x7tXUFvSyRtgA

The bread is amazing and holds up well.  Even the way the sandwich is constructed is smart and really kept the sandwiches from being overly soggy.  I can't wait to try the turkey, dressing, and cranberries.  Also the pickled peppers are freaking amazing.  Makes me want to try it on a cheese steak.  Only reason I didn't give it a five is due to two facts:

1.  Over 2 hours for delivery.  (I can understand due to the fact that they are probably really busy due to the product we got.)

2.  The coleslaw was a little dry and lacked flavor.  (Could have used a little sugar, salt, and pepper.)",T3_Maz72KRLYWY9a1qWYQg,0,0,4,xnjv5cQaf_AdexCWrQaBiw

If VOLUME is your thing, you should drop what you're doing and go there because their specialty seems to be massive sandwiches packed with meat. The small was bigger than I prefer!

One time, the line was really long and my order got lost within some other much larger orders. So, they made me a medium instead of a small sandwich, apologized profusely, and gave me my whole lunch for free.

When he eagerly responded with just the words ""THE BOBBIE"" I knew I'd be sinking my teeth into one of these famous sandwiches very shortly, and in fact it was just the next morning. 

He got the Bobbie, which really does taste like thanksgiving on a bun. Homemade roll, freshly cooked shredded turkey breast, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. I only had a bite but instantly understood why there are so many yelps talking about it. I got the Slaw Bi Jo, same fresh bread, fresh roast beef that was shredded instead of sliced, crispy cool cole slaw and provolone. The whole thing was delicious, I struggled to appear ladylike and bite it, when all I really wanted to do was mash it all the way into my mouth! The ladylike appearance only became harder to maintain, when the last person in our group received their cooked to order ""cheeseburger sub"" YES cheeseburger Sub! I realize the words sound funny together but believe me the sandwich is awesome! The cheeseburger is restaurant quality, and they will top it the way you want it, you can even ask for grilled onions. 

The whole experience was so good we decided to grab one for the road on our way out of Vegas, this time I tried the yelp infamous ""capistrami"" It was good, its served hot with the aforementioned crispy cool cole slaw, and melted swiss. I love pastrami, and enjoyed it, but in the end I wished I had gone with the slaw bijo, that roast beef was just so different and so tasty! 

The sandwiches come in three sizes 9 inches, 12 inches, and 20 inches, the prices are more than reasonable, your meal should run you around 10 bucks. 

Last note they had mini ""nothing bundt cakes"" cakes for sale, I've heard so much about them, and seen them in so many magazines I had to try one. Just like Capriottis, there reputation is well deserved. The mini chocolate cake was moist and rich and I was immediately smitten with it. 9 inches of pastrami and 1 mini bundt cake might have been to much, maybe even made me a little sick, but I didn't regret it at all!",CKHRhKZobmNBfUvlzxNqgg,6,8,5,d8nF352xmFwU9hIhph7Phg

From the look of the reviews, the place has not changed much. But, take that into consideration. I used to get all over LV., and this was my all time favorite place to have lunch. It is likely the best sandwich place on the planet!!! 

My first exposure to them was at a couple different work locations. They do sandwich trays for catering. They just kept poppin up everywhere I went (new work/training location every 4 weeks). The great thing about catered sandwich trays is 1. then are free to me, and 2. you can try a few different types of sandwiches. Over time I tried several. But, my favorite was their Bobby. It was a turkey, cranberry and stuffing sandwich on a soft roll with mayonnaise. It makes my mouth water. I was never a stuffing fan as a kid (those nasty gizzards in there turned me off!). But, this was like a nice bread or cornbread stuffing without the extra fluff. Damn, what a great combination. It was just to die for. And with several of these places around town, I could get them just about anywhere I was. I cant say I ate them all that often, but I used to run from the plaza where this one is and dinner was an easy stop off here. 

Whether you are from Vegas or just visiting, get by a Capriottis. All of their sandwiches are great but the Bobby is SOOOOO GOOOD, you just have to try it out. And, if you are catering your work lunch, think about them too so all your staff can enjoy.

Now that I live quite far away from the closest Cap's, I find myself craving them more than ever.  Luckily I get to get back to Vegas regularly, so I can stuff my face. Why do I love Cap's? Here's why:

1. The sandwiches are super, duper, amazingly tasty. Everything I have tried is amazing, but I usually go for the classic Bobbie (with extra mayo, of course) or a Cheesesteak with mushrooms (and more mayo.). They are yummy, filling, and mouth watering.

FYI, for anyone who doesn't know what the Bobbie is, it is Thanksgiving in a roll.  Roasted turkey, cornbread dressing, home made cranberry sauce, and some mayo on a flaky roll.  It also goes by ""Heaven on a Bun"" in many circles.

2. You usually get great customer service.  It seems you have to be rad to work at a Cap's. Happy people + Good customer service = Lotsa repeat customers. 

3. Did I mention my love for the Bobbie with extra mayo????

Capriotti's is just a fantastic sandwich shop with great food.  If you haven't tried them yet, go to one ASAP!

As for my 4 star rating, it is because of the physical location.  This parking lot is a hot mess at all times of the day.  This is probably because of the LVAC gym located in the same area, but it is still a pain to get in and out easily.

I show up and I pay but for some unknown reason my sandwich that I just paid for it grew legs and walked out of the restaurant!! Two people working there. A young lady started looking at the guy she writes with and said where's the sandwich? I know I made it. Then she says maybe the delivery driver took it. The young man responded and said the driver has been gone for 45 minutes. She frantically started to make me a sandwich immediately even though I called ahead of time. She could have said let me upgrade you to a bigger sandwich or the next one is on us or something! Point is go somewhere else. It just seems it's a mistake upon mistake upon mistake.

That being said i feel obligated to. I was there yesterday for lunch. The tough guy in charge was not a gentleman at all. He was condiscening towards the other employee's. 
I immediately thought the other guy there had mesed something up. It made perfect sense for that to be the explanation.
I felt the employee was acting suspicious, very slow, maybe tired. 
I gave the tough guy the benefit of the doubt for the moment. That was until i had grown inpatient waiting for my sandwhich. I asked if it was finnished. The tough guy poked in and said its been waiting. (Ive been waiting) being nice i just said ""oh i didnt hear"" i was only trying to hint that they need to anounce the order. I didnt feel i was being passive agressive. After my reply, he responded ""cant see?"" Under his breath as he was walking away. 
That behaviour is unacceptable. Im probabaly younger then him, and even i dont respond to my customers like that.

I also ended up putting some Jalapeno Chips into the sandwich to give it a nice crunch and zest. Also did not let me down.

My wife and I were recently in Vegas and visiting the Pinball Hall of Fame.   After a little while of playing we realized we were hungry and needed to eat.   We knew that later in the evening we would be having a big meal, so we thought a sandwich would be good.   We remembered that Capriotti's had received good reviews so we figured, what the heck.   Fellow Yelpers, you didn't let us down.   

It took a few minutes to find this place since it is tucked in the corner of a shopping mall, but it's worth the time to find it.   When we got in, we were greeted by a super friendly staff.   We decided to split a large sandwich.   After placing our order, the staff started to prepare it right away.   In a few minutes we picked up our sandwich and started to eat.   WOW!   It was good.  They don't skimp on the meat or cheese   I believe we had an Italian Sub.   The bread was this awesome soft roll.   Man, it was good.   The sandwich and a couple of drinks was something like $10.   That was a heck of a bargain especially when you consider the taste, quality and quantity of food we received.   

Will we be back?  You bet we will.   It's only 5 minutes from the Pinball Hall of Fame and it's a great place to eat!   Thanks Yelp!",5wRCMyU9dEdkja_mO0qfeQ,2,1,5,c8ViX0HMYV-VDMWhf12pkA

It's somewhat similar to Tat's deli, in Seattle, not quite as much flavor but these guys have a better cut of meat, much better.

My preferred, and only, sandwich that have ordered, is the Capastrqmi, which I generally get the medium 12 inch with one extra packet of meat. Each packet, from what have been told, is 2.5 ounces. I also ask them to make it light on coleslaw. It adds something but don't like a lot. Wish the roll had more flavor, was a little crusty or something different, but will always be a fan of the Capastrami

This location is pretty standard and the people really do seem to care. Whenever am in someplace new, with a Capriotti's, I always go there. Lucky for me, Las Vegas is packed with them!",_IcrRgXW1gtVNruseNHAJQ,0,0,5,yqPq3BiQ6y0tnpslaK_amA
