I know the chips and cheese are on the value menu  but I think I five chips and less then half a cup of cheese was less then value and more a sample.,k8gIuQHuUYdfy4iUWGw7Eg,0,0,2,uZ_mlnQRHjzVE4_Sp5qkIQ

They do things really fast and neat. I never open a taco from here with things falling out of its shell ever. They wrap it nicely. Food is really consistent and hardly any mistakes with long complicated orders, if anything they remake the entire order for you with a smile. I am extremely satisfy with their service",pIekRRbcZvQbwYobu7f6sA,1,0,5,hlJQ7fAqmp4pni2Nv77Saw

3170646,2015-11-22,6,bEJzJq-aeuXYDThZnF0Mgw,"First off if I could give this location negative stars I most certainly would! I truly hate giving bad reviews, but I have given this location numerous chances over the years. I'm usually annoyed with them on how they continually forget one of my food items or a straw for my drink or when I purchased one of the Playstation food boxes and the code was already used (which they told me to go online to find free codes)...I continually just brush it off...what happened tonight though crossed the line. 
      After a long day at work, my wife called me and asked for me to pick up taco bell for dinner. I ordered a boss wrap, cheesy gordita box and 2 freezes...of course they forgot my straws again, but today I was smart enough to check the bag before driving off. Once I got home, we started eating and half way through our meal. My wife spit out her food. She said there was a worm in her taco and that the tomatoes were moldy. I looked and laughed at first thinking it was a grain of rice. She kept saying no! It's a worm...I'm never eating the again! I took a picture so II could see it more up close. In the picture you could clearly see it was a maggot...we could even see the lines through the little body. I was going to go there and show them, but realized it's not worth our time. The most they'd probably do it give me another infested taco. 
     On a side note about channel 13 squacking about personal reviewers possibly getting in trouble for posting their reviews I think is complete bull! There is a thing called freedom of speech (for now until it's taken away from us), also in situations like this where moldy food and insects are in our food...I think everyone has the right to know what goes on at these places.....the end...",0LzxzSM6oqOilJ_Tx8AXzg,13,8,1,21zv_H819CFm_Isp_oo3QA

4240758,2015-11-14,0,bEJzJq-aeuXYDThZnF0Mgw,"I used to go to this taco bell all the time because we lived near it. Unfortunately we don't anymore, so I haven't been in ages.

Our order was rarely wrong at this taco bell. We always check our item bag before leaving and pretty infrequently was it missing anything.

The quality of food seemed to vary wildly. Sometimes I'd get such great foods that it reminded me why Taco Bell is one of my favorite fast food restaurants, and other times I severely regretted not going to Jack in the Box across the street instead when I needed a quick fix.

I don't know why, but Taco Bells are really lacking in 24-hours open around here. I only know of one taco bell in Las Vegas open 24 hours, but it's pretty far. This is only a minor complaint, though.

Finally, there was the mobile app. My partner and I really liked using the mobile app so we wouldn't be rushed at the order window and could also claim additional little discounts through the app. Taco bell coupons are like nonexistent after all, for some reason. Anyways, at some point, the store no longer was available to us on the mobile app. It said ""Mobile ordering unavailable at this location."" Kinda made us sad.",CVwtKiHDYZwIG1_SiUiWxQ,0,0,3,NgZ-oPWDMhmGFEuQjkoQvA
4427677,2015-07-02,0,bEJzJq-aeuXYDThZnF0Mgw,Excellent customer service at this location every time I come. This pparticular time the boy at the window suggested if I would like no sour cream on the extra two grillers that I got and I didn't even know they came with sour cream but he noticed that I didn't want sour cream on my other item so he kind of reminded me to not get sour cream so I thought that was pretty cool and thanks for that because my husband totally wouldn't have ate it if it had sour cream :),1TmIDS1GOIel7DVsRKgr7w,0,0,5,RaqzoJU8e3SpA0UVS421rw
4859877,2015-05-09,0,bEJzJq-aeuXYDThZnF0Mgw,"I always come to this Taco Bell and have had great service in the past. My order looked right on the screen. The girl on the intercom seemed nice. But it wasn't until I received my food is where I really felt like it was a waste of time and money. I really should have gone to jack in the box across the street. Like I get that it's fast food but common.
I ordered two cheesy bean and rice burritos and it seems like they didn't get the rice part cause it was all beans. And I love your guys rice. Next time I'll be sure to ask for only cheese and rice. The nachos bell grande were horrible. The cheesy potatoes weren't the same, it didn't taste like they usually do. Like they were sitting out all day and they just topped it with cheese and sour cream. And what made me upset was after eating all of that with my brother I opened my Doritos locos taco supreme to find out it wasn't even supreme?!?!?! It's gonna be a long time before I come back to this Taco Bell. If that's the case I'll go to another one 15 minutes away. And finally your diablo sauce taste like ramen. It was just all bad. Service seemed fine until I opened up my food.
Giving 2 stars today, service was nice but the food just wasn't up to par.",G19JJVKk-R2HHjKp9AkoVQ,0,0,2,5K6VFQxfy4094yzeme7XoA

My orders are complicated because I basically customize everything I order.  99.9% of the time it's perfect.  I get extra cheese and easy beef which I guess can be different from person to person.
