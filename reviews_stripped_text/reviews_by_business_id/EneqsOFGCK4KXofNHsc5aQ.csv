We noticed that In-N-Out was close by so decided to give it a try.  My wife spoke highly about eating at different In-N -Out Burger joints in the past. 

They have a very simple menu with only a few options.  It was very busy but they definitely live up to their name.  The food arrived quickly and was what I expected.  I had the Double Cheeseburger with Fries.  It was a good burger, but if you are expecting something special, you might go somewhere else.  The Fries were kind of disappointing to me.  It was like they weren't deep fried or something.  They were just dry and not as good as other fast food options in my opinion.  

Overall it was a good, reasonably priced, quick place to grab some food after a night of drinking.

I really appreciated that. However, the line up for pick up was just ridiculous. It was chaotic: people who just ordered stood in front of the counter even though there was already a line formed. There was absolutely no order here and I literally had to push my way through to get my food. 

I enjoyed my double double. The two beef patties tasted great. The amount of the sauce was just right, it didn't make the bun all soggy and a mess to eat. It was definitely better than McDonalds. Other than that, it was nothing special. In-N-Out Burger is a great and cheap option if you are looking for a quick fix.

They have a ketchup and hot pepper station which I loved because those are two of my favorite things to add to my burger! Now the fries also came animal style.

I'm definitely going to try it again if I have the opportunity. But if you're visiting and don't have these around your home try it. It's cheap, decent burgers and filling.

And regardless of what people on Yelp say or don't say, In N Out will always be packed. In n Out should just be given 5 stars on Yelp permanently. Anyone who gives it less than 5 stars should not be allowed to review restaurants. 

But now that they are on the Strip in Las Vegas, it behooves me to add yet another 5 star review in the hopes of helping fellow tourists find the best casual food option on the Strip.

In N Out is the gold standard by which all other fast food restaurants should be measured. They value their customers and not just in a lip service type of way. Their restaurants are clean, bright, and shiny. They have a staff of smiling, hustling, efficient workers who can move long lines that would have caused a catastrophic meltdown at other restaurants. They will not compromise on the quality or freshness of their product. They only have a couple items on the menu so that they can do their thing (burgers and fries) and do it exceedingly well. Their burgers are everything that people hype them up to be and more. And ""fairly priced"" doesn't even do justice to their prices because they could DOUBLE their prices and I would still go there the same amount without batting an eye. 

Unsurprisingly, I found this location is the same as all of the other In N Outs I have been to in terms of the above qualities. Go. You will not be disappointed.",IjNOwI028HYJ9deeeFkXqQ,3,1,5,qWqoDtb2Wn85hN1WGJM7wA

My friend and I came here around 5:00pm.  The lines weren't too long and go by quickly, the place was packed with people waiting for their food and seats and tables were filled.

I ordered the Cheeseburger Combo (protein style), which came with fries and a medium drink.  I ordered my fries ""Animal Style,"" which is fries topped with melted cheese, sautéed chopped onions and Thousand Island Dressing.  The burger was delicious; the protein/bunless version makes it feel light and the Thousand Island Dressing adds some sweetness but complements the burger really well.  The ""Animal Style"" fries was just okay for me.  I would order the fries as is.  It's quite messy, so my friend and I asked for utensils.

Customer service was friendly and quick, despite the busyness.  I'll come back here if I'm ever craving for a burger. I have yet to try their milkshakes!

Some tips and notes: 
- They do protein/bunless burgers; it's not on the menu, you just have to ask
- ""Animal Style"" fries is on their secret menu, as my friend has told me; mention it to the cashier and they'll know what you're talking about

I was looking for more of a snack today, so the only thing I got was a hamburger, animal style. I love that they marinate it in extra sauce when you ask for that and they also add chopped onions on top. The hamburger was delicious and I wish we had this chain closer to me.

This location does lose one star for me because it didn't have any bathrooms, as far as I could tell. I had to backtrack to the Linq and find a bathroom to use after my meal, instead.

Of course with any other location finding a seat is a challenge. I would have more luck winning money at the slots than actually finding a seat the first time. Eventually we realized that this wasn't anti social Vancouver and that most people given the seating circumstance would be happy to share a seat with us. We found a seat with this lovely couple. Again seat sharing isn't a thing in Vancouver so we were shocked as someone actually welcomed us to their seat. I didn't do animal style this time. I just got two basic burgers and fries to share. I am happy to report that the taste is just like the location in LA. I ate that burger slowly with my eyes closed. I didn't even talk to my best friend. I just wanted the moment to myself.

2131427,2017-06-01,1,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,"I had heard a lot about In-N-Out Burger so I was quite eager to try it while we were in Vegas.  To be honest I was a bit skeptical as I've eaten at a lot of burger places in my life and I hear all the time about how great some shops like In-N-Out Burger are but they rarely live up to the hype.  A good burger is a pretty rare thing, a truly fantastic burger is almost unheard of in my opinion.  So one night after a night of fun in Vegas the wife and I decided to try In-N-Out Burger finally.  We arrived late in the night, after many a drinks, and stood in a pretty long line.  Thankfully the line moved very quickly so it wasn't long before it was our turn to order.  I ordered the animal style burger and some fries and the wife got the same.  After waiting about five minutes or so our order came out.  There was a lot of people in the restaurant but we were able to find a spot.  

I was pretty impressed with just how truly tasty the burger looked in it's little container and the fries were very tasty looking as well.  It didn't take long before I ate a few of those and wow, they were really good!  Very crispy and not too oily. Very much like the king of fries: McDonalds.  I am not a ""fry guy"" so for me to like fries is almost unheard of.  Nearly everywhere aside from McDonalds I never get fries (Burger King=onion rings, Wendy's=chili, etc).  But finally it was time to actually taste the burger and I was blown away by the explosion of flavor.  The animal sauce wasn't quite like 1,000 Island or Big Mac Sauce or anything like I thought it'd taste.  It is really difficult to describe, but I will say it was delicious and I loved it.  Will definitely have to get that on the fries next time.  

So to say I love In-N-Out Burger is an understatement.  The wife loved it as well.  We honestly were tempted to go back again the next night and came very close to doing so but ultimately our desire to try some new places won out.  I sort of hope they never get these in Ohio or I may end up gaining about 10 pounds a month from pigging out on their food.  A must try, I am definitely coming back here for a burger next time I'm in Vegas or any other place that has In-N-Out Burger!",MqvuybIfFPZpKbwLcaeutg,1,2,5,8orm8VXMoCCV4AG4fAUQoQ

2150767,2018-02-15,1,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,"I am a HUGE fan of In-N-Out, but before coming to this location, I had only dined at the L.A. locations.  So when I was planning my very first trip to Las Vegas, this In-N-Out on the Strip was added to my to-do list.  And the hubs and I weren't going to eat there just once... we planned to go twice.  And we did!  Both times, everything was just as delicious as I remembered from L.A.

Our first visit was around 11:30 am on a Wednesday, and while the restaurant was busy, the line wasn't long yet.  Every table was occupied, but after ordering and paying, the hubs and I only had to stand around for a few minutes until a table opened up.  Most customers know not to linger after finishing their food since In-N-Outs, in general, tend to get busy and full.  As indicated by the restaurant's name, it is not the place to just sit and hang out.  If you are dining in, you don't have to ""rush,"" but please be considerate of those who are waiting for a table.

During our second visit, we got into a long line around 2 pm on a Saturday.  However, the line moved pretty quickly.  While my husband ordered and paid, I went to the dining room and waited patiently by a table that looked like they were finishing up soon.  I was delighted when the two ladies at the table asked if I'd like to use their table when they were done.  Score!

What I've had at this location:

* Cheeseburger ($3.25) - If you're not super hungry, the single patty cheeseburger is a good amount of food.  I always get my burgers with NO onions.  This simple, classic cheeseburger is seasoned perfectly with the right amount of ""spread"" (basically Thousand Island-style sauce) along with lettuce and tomato.  Every ingredient tasted fresh and delicious.
* Double-Double ($4.50) - Pretty much ditto what I said about the regular (single patty) cheeseburger, but add an extra patty and an extra slice of cheese for more food and flavor!
* Fries ($2.10) - The flavor of their not-so-greasy fries actually reminds me of potato chips!  They're somewhat light and even though they're not the best fast food fries (in my humble opinion), I still think they're tasty and pair perfectly with the amazing burgers!

I don't bother with animal-style (""secret menu"" item... ask them), protein-style (lettuce instead of buns), or any of the milkshakes.  I've always enjoyed the simple, classic items as they have consistently been good.

Overall, this In-N-Out Burger on the Las Vegas strip gets 5 stars!  Thanks to the friendly and efficient employees, convenient location on the Strip (The LINQ Promenade), and of course - the BEST fast food burgers, the hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed both of our visits to this location.

My west coast friends would constantly rave to me about the juicy cheeseburgers and amazing animal style fries that I had to try. As such, those were the things I ordered. Here's what I found...

Pros
- Lines were long but orders came flying out 
- Service: Although a fast food chain, workers smiled and someone even came to clean up our plates 
- Price: The best part. Two ""cheeseburgers"" (animal style is free) and animal fries (not free - surcharge of $2) for $11. Not a bad deal to get you full 

Cons
- Fries were soggy. Even the ones at the bottom not soaked in cheese were soggy :( 
- Burger was good but not great. Lettuce and tomatoes were fresh but the patty was very thin. Bun was the saving grace. Maybe getting a 2x2 or 3x3 would've helped. 


Overall: The food was definitely better than McDonalds but I'd prefer five guys or even shake shack. Five guys because their fries are much crispier and burgers can be customized with many more toppings. Shake shake while more expensive, has a better beef patty and much better tasting fries.

Ok - we actually managed to find seating inside! Mainly to avoid the pigeons. Just kidding! It's hot in Vegas and air conditioning is good.

I hate have to bite into a burger and all the ingredients are falling out because it was overstuffed and everything becomes a mess. With this burger it was no problem. The milkshake was thick and creamy. The animal fries were fantastic!!!

I went about 5 times during my 3 day stay because it was the only fairly priced meal on the strip that was worth what you pay! Only problem I had was the attack of pigeons in the outside seating area that never left your side lol. But I demolished my food quickly so it wasn't a bother.

Docking a star for ordering and food wait time. Not really unique to this location, but it was packed and we were lucky to snag a table (which was dirty).

Employees wear these oversized hats, straight out of Pizza Planet from Toy Story. Speed is a priority, but always have my order right. Food comes in little red lunch trays. Burgers are served with the wrapper support, facing upward. Food presentation checks every box. 

This location is newer, and probably the largest In N' Out that I've seen. They're running through people here. Ticket numbers cycle 1-100 throughout the day. I was order #17. By the time I finished my meal, they were on order #94. Talk about speedy gonzalez! Mind..blown ! 

ANIMAL style is my favorite aspect of In N' Out, which is the Golden Goose of the franchise. Although not featured on the menu, Animal orders smear a blend of sautéed onions and thousand island sauce, to my knowledge. Anything you order can be served animal style. 

Milkshakes are mediocre average, but they also don't claim them as a focal point. --PASS--

We arrived in Vegas just 2-3 days after the new In-n-Out opened in the LINQ Promenade, so we didn't have to drive out to bumblefuck in order to get it. The line at about 9:30pm was relatively short and we got our burger relatively quickly. We took them back to our rooms since half of us wanted In-n-Out and the other half wanted Shake Shack (In-n-Out's vegetarian option is...to be it frankly, sad). 

The fries, first of all, were just disappointing. They're regular fries - but overly salted fries. I dare to say that even McDonald's fries are better! The burger itself wasn't anything spectacular. I got mine Animal Style and it kind of just tasted like a ""real"" Big Mac. I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I didn't hate it either. My friend from San Francisco has already disowned me. 

To be fair, we did eat it after it's been slightly cold. BUT even cold Shake Shack burgers are bomb. Again, I might be biased. Either way, I'd have In-n-Out if it's in the area, but I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to have it again.",szUqQBw8Xl5RExjRqTQsoQ,1,1,3,SaszmAn8VxiYMLvuSyQdpA

3075225,2017-06-06,0,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,You can't go wrong with IN-n-Out. After hearing about this place open up recently I was wary of trying it. I assumed oh well it's on the strip it's going to be overpriced and slammed in there. Sure enough I was right about one thing. They are slammed. Surprisingly it's the same price as any other In-N-out. My boyfriend came on a Tuesday around 2 o clock this place was busy. No seats to sit inside or out but we got our food fast. Service was really great and efficient. The decor in here I love. There is a clean red and white theme with the little palm trees all over the wall and the outside is bright and neon like any good place is in Las Vegas. We got our usual two doubles with animal fries and a chocolate shake. The food was hot and fresh! My fries were nice and crispy with lots of spread.

They have a rope at the front door with two door man making sure that the place didn't get over run with customers. We were let in right away.

The turnover is huge. The cleaner was friendly, outgoing and a joy to converse with. It make the experience pleasant. The food is a bit pricey but everyone seems to love it.

The menu compared to other fast foods is pretty limited, and even their combos are just an easier way to order (as in, there's no discount to ordering a combo vs. ordering parts individually.)

The place was packed, which is why I am not a huge fan of this location. I'm going to guess that it's hard to find cheap eats on the Strip, so that's why the situation. There was just a huge line to order, a while to wait, a number system that didn't seem to be in any order so you really had to pay attention, and no where to sit. I will give them credit, that they did a pretty good job keeping things moving, all things considered. I just personally don't like being in big crowds and then eating standing up because that's my only option.

The burger was nice and juicy and lettuce and tomato provided the perfect contrast. The fries were great, described by my boyfriend as ""too salty"" but I say there's no such thing.

AND...... whenever we go to Vegas, our first stop off the plane is to....you guessed it. They are quite packed in Vegas so we always have a Plan B and Plan C location to fall back on. Imagine my amazement when I found out that this burger haven now has a location right off the Vegas Strip. It is officially listed as at The Linq, but is right around the corner from The Flamingo Hotel in the alleyway leading to the Giant Ferris Wheel. Now we were able to walk there after checking into our hotel. As with other locations, the crowd was plentiful but the young staff was quite efficient in filling the orders and getting the food in your hands in a reasonable time. My wife in the meantime secured a nice table outside. So, that's where the good review ends with the pleasant and efficient staff. They get the one star that I have awarded. As for the food......my love of all In-N-Outs has come crashing down to earth. I ordered my usual Double-Double and Fries. The burger which is usually juicy, was cooked beyond recognition. It was horribly overdone and I actually threw it out after eating half of it. My wife's was the same. Now, they can't also screw up the freshly made Fries, can they? Yes they can and they did! These Fries were so overdone, charred and dried out that they were like those dry straws you buy in a bag or can. How can they mess up what every other location has brilliantly delivered? I hope I'm not scarred for life, but for sure will never visit this location again. Hopefully it was an off day, but I won't be around to find out.

I just ordered my usual two cheeseburgers Animal style without lettuce and tomatoes (http://bit.ly/2w4yKZl).  Just the way I like it and totally hit the spot for me.  I didn't order any fries only because I was craving the burgers at the time.

This location is pretty similar to the San Francisco location at Fisherman's Wharf.  There's no drive-thru, but a ton of tables both inside and outside.  Plus the prices are inflated since it's literally on the Strip, but still cheaper than Shake Shack, and even White Castle.

Burger was good, but definitely more salty than I'm used to - I think it must have been a fluke because surely their burgers aren't always this salty. I was hoping for leaf lettuce, but it was more like chunks of iceberg - just personal preference. The tomato was fresh and I liked the sauce, which is basically thousand island dressing. I ordered cheese fries but that was a mistake as I was expecting a cheese sauce but they a steam a slice of American cheese on top of the fries...had I known that I would  not have ordered cheese fries, haha, but again that's just personal preference.

Anyways, the burgers aren't bad. I mean what do you expect from a fast food restaurant? To find something as cheap and good as this on the strip is definitely a win-win. Single burgers are a little under 4$, while doubles are a little under 5$.

There is also a secret option that is not so secret anymore. I heard a lot of people mention ""animal style"" which is some special sauce with fried onions and cheese.

I finally made my way back out to Vegas and tried it out with high hopes. Took me about 5-6 hours to realize that it was so average/below average that I couldn't even believe it. The patties are thin, they have no flavor, and the animal sauce is nowhere near as special as Mac Sauce. I'm shocked that people think this place is good, almost to the point where I think I must be wrong. I'll try it again tmrw but I am sure that this place is missing many of the fundamentals of a good burger; needless to say their fries are also garbage.

This was news months ago and the predication was that this location is going to be the busiest In-N-Out ever.  I don't know about that.  The Barstow CA and Tropicana NV location is pretty crazy.  

The girlfriend alerted me that this In-N-Out grand opened today and I couldn't resist. I've been to every In-N-Out in Las Vegas/Henderson and wasn't missing a chance at this one, especially since it was the middle of the week. I'm assuming that the lines during the weekends will be cray cray.  There was a line when I arrived, but it's In-N-Out and goes by so quick.  I found one seat open and took it.  I don't know if it's temporary due to grand opening week, but my meal was served to me.  I prefer a Double Double, spread only, extra toast, and well done fries.  But on this visit, I kept it Keto style with two Flying Dutchman's (Two Patties/Two Cheese x 2). Of course I had spread added (awesome sauce!!).  Both Flying Dutchman's were too salty for my liking.  In-N-Out is known for throwing a lot of salt on their patties, but mine was a little too much.  I'll give them a pass since they're new.  

This is not your typical In-N-Out.  For one, there's obviously no drive thru.  And two, the prices are bumped up a bit.  For example, a Double Double is normally $3.60.  Here it's $4.35.  Two Flying Dutchman's usually cost me $4.76.  With a drink, I spent close to $9.00.  A Double Double Meal aka a Number 1 is about $1.50 more.  You get the point. The upcharge is due to location and rent must be exceptionally high.  I get it, I just don't agree with it.  This location is not going to be crazy, it's going to be Karazy.  I'm sure they'll make enough to cover expenses.  In my opinion, locals should get a discount. 

Overall, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  I just don't see myself going out of the way to eat here.  But if I am at the LINQ and in need of a good burger, then you know where to find me. 

TIP #1:  Don't forget about the secret menu.  Animal Style!!
TIP #2:  This location has a Company Store. It's small but good to know.  
TIP#3: Expect tons of tourist here.  It was cool to watch excited customers walking in and out.  I even witnessed a few hi-fives and cheering.  Poor things...we are so privileged out on the west.

It opened somewhat recently (less than 1 month ago). People are always comparing In-N-Out (West Coast) with Shake Shack (East Coast) and now that In-N-Out is located on the Strip, people can enjoy both while strolling on the Strip.

This In-N-Out is located in the Linq Promenade area.

When I went in, I was immediately greeted by people behind the cash register. I wasn't sure what I wanted yet so I didn't line up. After I quickly looked at the items advertised above the cash register and decided to get a double burger combo. The prices seemed higher than ""normal"" but I would assume that it is because it is on the Strip. I asked for the animal style fries (which isn't shown on the menu on the top of the cash register). I was handed a cup so went to the soft drink dispenser to get my drink. I opted for Dr. Pepper since they didn't have the soft drink that I normally prefer which is Coke Zero. After a few minutes, they called out my number and I went to get my tray.

Even though there wasn't much of a line-up to order, the sit-in area was almost completely filled. I managed to get a seat when someone left. Cellphone reception was somewhat spotty inside the restaurant (I'm with T-Mobile) but the restaurant did have free wireless so I was able to update my status of Facebook as well as include pictures of my meal on social media.

When I finished my meal, I went to refill my drink and asked where the washroom/toilette was in the place and one of the employees informed me that there wasn't one inside the restaurant and I had to either go inside the casino or go to the public washroom within the Linq Promenade. Not knowing where the public washroom is within the Linq Promenade was located, I opted to walk to the casino to use the washroom and wash my hands since my burger was messy (but delicious).

Them not having a washroom inside the restaurant and their prices being higher than ""normal"" are the reasons why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,8,4,4,Xl2pIMrWMVRM6BWGXPNNig

Two years later the First In N Out opened in 1948. Fast forward 71 years after the first Strip mega resort & 69 years after the first In N Out there was finally a link connecting the two icons. This link is spelled Linq. A couple of weeks ago, the Linq made headlines when this location opened as the very first In N Out on the Las Vegas Strip. 

  The first In N Out on the Strip is drawing in the crowds. And the demand is exceeding supply. The famous red, white, & yellow colors adorn a an average size eatery. During peak times there are insufficient  booths and patio tables. This was the case last time when I left disappointed. In hindsight I could of ordered to go then walked nearby to the Wildlife Habitat to have an In N Out picnic in the company of flamingos, ducks, and exotic birds. 

  The next week it was a different situation. On a rainy day we experienced the sunshine of In N Out when startlingly there were vacant booths. In N Out is fast food sunshine on a cloudy day & anyday. I have yet to see a gloomy employee in their restaurants. During the grand opening era, employees opened and closed the door for me. Now if I needed to use a restroom they would open and close the door for me because there are no restrooms leaving me  to use the public  one in the Linq. Across from the door in the open kitchen there were at least 29 employees greeting customers and creating the food. 

  Comparable to all In N Outs ordering is done with ease. The menu features 3 burger items that include lettuce, tomato, onions, & a thousand island style sauce. They are also offered as combos that include a medium Coke beverage and fries. The prices are higher than the other locations yet a bargain for the Strip. My cheeseburger combo came to less than $10 around the price of a beer on the Strip. It was $ well spent. Contrary to its namesake the food is never ""In N Out"" of a microwave or fryer. It was freshly made from the time of order causing a good few minutes of anticipation. The In N Out sunshine that permeated the delicious burger & fries was worth it. 

   In conclusion I anticipate a perpetual extraordinary busy In N Out. I foresee patronizing the local In N Out and leaving the a booth for the out of towner that craves In N Out. Now if there are a few available tables, there will be one for this local when he is craving In N Out.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,15,4,P6roEHOf1UAXmMvI4LfUVg

Of course their food was wonderful as usual. A Double Double with fries and a vanilla shake. Why order anything else?? There is the usual seating and some outdoor seating as well. It is a bit limited during peak times but there are plenty of bench style seats just outside within the LINQ area. 

During each of my visits, I was approached by an employee asking me how ""everything was"" as least once.

The Good:
This is a popular place, but the line moved swiftly. The employee who took our order was very nice and happy!! It's a pleasant change from the sterotypical down-trodden fast food worker.

In order to get the real In-N-Out experience, you must google the secret menu. I ordered the Flying Dutchman with lettuce and tomato (a double cheeseburger minus the buns), Joe had a double double animal style (a double cheese burger with their sauce, onions, pickles), and an order of cheese fries lite well (fries cooked just a little longer so they are crisper with 2 slices of American cheese on top).

Oh my gosh, the food was so fresh and so delicious!!! Our meal costs $12.02. That is a STEAL for a meal for 2 in Vegas that isn't McDonald's!


Could improve: 
Knowing you have to look up the secret menu for the full experience.... or else you are getting just a plain hamburger/cheeseburger.

Cleanliness in the dining area. It's not that the resturant was totally unclean, it's just that this resturant was hoppin' and there was a lot of foot traffic, and some people don't clean up after themselves. There were several employees running around and cleaning up, so they were definitley trying!

Also, some chili on those fries would have been tasty ;)


The bad:
Nothing!!!


Overall:
In-N-Out lived up to the hype for me, however I have learned to keep my expectations low when anything is hyped up.  I will most likely be getting food there again before I return to my In-N-Outless state if Wisconsin.",NpZ6hMBncbIvAo4btwrvZQ,4,3,4,YJcm3von7EjfH_AcyeJT8g

We went in around 1115 on a weekday thinking 1. people wouldn't be awake yet, or 2. it was too early for lunch. Boy were we wrong on both accounts. It was packed, but the line moved quickly. Soon it became a ""who is quicker"" competition for trying to find a table. For the amount of customers they get, they sure need more seating when the weather isn't that nice outside. Luckily we found a table quickly and our food arrived shortly after (maybe 10 minutes or less).

The burgers were delicious with the grilled onions and special sauce. The fries were a bit cold and stale so I think we would have rather gotten bigger burgers and passed on the fries. The milkshake was super thick to drink through a straw. Walking around with it, the consistency thinned out and we were able to enjoy them. 

NOTE: There are no bathrooms at this location.

(When walking by later at night it wasn't super crowded, might be better for a cheap dinner if you don't want to wait.)",Yj1wKYRmEGXhm_bwqSd8tw,1,0,4,E1V2HmXXJPIKScm70-BE1w

Let me say we went on a good time where that outside temperature was 98 degrees and this restaurant had a/c and room to dine inside!

We ordered 1 cheeseburger and 1 double with fries and drinks.

Food
Pro: This place rocks. Burgers were well cooked. with fresh lettuces and tomatoes.
Con: I expect more on the fries. Sort of disappointed.

I live in the south and always eating McDonald and Burger king and coming to Vegas able to hit the IN-N-OUT was one of my bucket-list.

I do have to say that their fries, even animal style, lack a lot of texture and flavor - stick to the burgers.",3nFaqQGUO-7EEg_chrS37Q,0,0,4,cGSBIkWdjFwgc64AK1IaBw

P.S.- When you go ask for animal style for a extra umph to your burger!",CjEryc5PiN6SM4oQrpMp7A,0,1,4,Tp0UHxZMU-IwjqPdj5GI1w
5860629,2017-07-14,0,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,"What an over hyped chain. Let's start at the basics, the fries, nothing special, got them animal style and regular, go with the animal style. It's a basic burger which many west coasters over hype for no reason. There is no flavor in the meat, small patty that' over cooked. Stick with Gordon Ramsey BURGR in Vegas, so much better. Don't understand the hype behind this chain. Wouldn't go back again.",3E6FPeo05zowUxkT-yLAaQ,0,0,3,4bTS2CAjBF0LtJAGRb1JPA

I am slightly disappointed at the fact that this California based family chain is spreading out, which might eventually result in their quality going down.",J5CmFN4TULKvry4NzfAoNA,0,0,4,YdlU_QfBdBVI7_q3iI7yCQ
5927847,2018-05-20,0,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,"This is the best fast food burger I've ever had. The burger was a nice size and juicy. I also loved the taste of the animal sauce and the crispness and freshness of the veggies. Totally worth it. The double double combo is less than $9...impressive to find food of this quality for this cheap in a town with so many overpriced establishments. The chocolate shake was also very good. My only complaint is that the fries, while tasty, were a tad undercooked, hence the one star deduction. Highly recommended.",UB4EyEynaCx3JICk4LLWkA,0,0,4,eP01JZE-sKtiioIlJz9aNg
5928034,2017-10-09,0,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,"Sooooo this was my first time eating here and I must say it was chaotic. When we walked in we were first in line, we both got the double burger, 1 regular fry, 1 animal fry. We got our number, turned around, and there were probably a crowd of 60/70 ppl waiting for their food. Figuring it'll take a while, we looked for seats. There is a tiny sitting area outside and half of the restaurant has seating, a lot of ppl opt in to sit on the fountain outside. As you can imagine, it's tough finding a seat. Luckily for me, I have no shame in preying on tables and quickly found a seat where a couple was just finishing up. It was about a 10-12 minute wait and then deliciousness. The burger was great, they put their signature animal sauce on it and it was very satisfying. The animal fries were A LOT, there was cheese, caramelized onions and topped with a ton of animal sauce. I've never heard of onions on fries before, but I was feeling adventurous and I'm glad I was. While I enjoyed them, they are definitely not something I would get every time, because like I said, it's a lot. I could not eat all of my fries, I was stuffed after that burger. AND it was the cheapest meal I had in Vegas, only about $21 for 2 ppl. This is a franchise I will definitely be supporting again.",dft0gUT-LuH6dH2u82c08g,0,0,4,_V4Ta7Ikyu_UeJjWIzUXaA
5930547,2018-05-23,0,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,"When you live somewhere that In-N-Out doesn't exist, you have to jump on the opportunity to grab some when you can. We were in Vegas for the weekend and knew this would for sure be one of our stops. 

This particular In-N-Out is situated just slightly off the strip. We were there on a Monday afternoon, around 2:00pm. It was PACKED. Like, crazy busy. They were pretty efficient in handing guests, though, so it wasn't a big deal. There were zero tables to sit at inside or outside, so we opted for the the fountain. It was a warm day and the mist from the fountain felt nice anyway. But, be aware, seating can be difficult! 

As far as the food goes - it was wonderful! Between the three of us, we had two double-doubles - one of them animal style, one single cheese burger, three orders of fries - two of them animal style. We were not able to even come close to finishing everything. Portions are very generous! I recommend sharing fries if you're not all that hungry! 

And if you're not familiar with animal style, just try it! You won't be disappointed.",wNLZnNNLV8rOGiPjqMPVdQ,0,0,4,kQSUiXSov2_UgL4wx8l-bg
5934498,2018-04-15,0,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,So so happy that there's a location in Vegas!!! It's located slightly off strip but right in front of the LINQ high roller! It was a fantastic experience for being such a busy location! The staff were extremely organized and efficient in terms of taking orders and calling out the order numbers! I ordered the animal style burger and fries combo and due to sheer high volume everything tasted fresh and delicious!! Loved my experience there!!!!,1RQaXb0xSLsUzwJ0u4uZ-w,0,0,5,2HCOKT-l7u5c6x1zOylMvw
5952771,2017-02-17,0,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,I recently ate at in-n-out on the Vegas strip. The burger and fries were good. Shake was just ok. Shake Shack has better shakes in my opinion. The restaurant was busy with a lot of people working but also seemed disorganized compared to my experience at similar in-n-out's in California. Double/Double animals style was tasty. My friend got his fries extra crispy which made them like potato chips.,s11HvmQXqDVBygf0SF49Xw,0,0,4,K7qdUYVUyyA_SJAe1VPBaA
5990087,2017-04-07,0,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,I went to a concert at the Brooklyn Bowl and of course needed a bite after all that alcohol. Thank goodness for In-N-Out being right there. Don't be deterred by the long line. The staff there are very efficient. Got my order spot on and way faster than I had thought it would be. I almost didn't go in bc of the long line but glad I did. Very satisfied with this location.,e2rUTql6lISqqir-uyS8_g,0,0,5,Q1bWnx3XhpX1Y3YHg9wing

Not only was the food spot on - delicious tasting and traditionally priced - but this location was also great for people watching. If you catch my drift. 

Animal style all the way, my friends.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,8,6,4,zMMrtW-m57y_XplFDQ94Og
