Earl's was supposed to be open @ 10:00am. Was told by an employee that they ""would be opening late today...closer to 10:30am"". It appeared as if they were missing staff/employees, or staff/employees had not showed up early enough to open on time.

Over time, the staff quality has improved.  The seating is never much of an issue and sitting outside is pleasant when it isn't summer.

The staff, especially the manager, has been friendly and talkative with the customers.  Downtown Summerlin has really blossomed into a gem, I admit I was somewhat a skeptic, but not anymore.",oDHgXsmvQcmtS_xJKCT1xg,6,0,4,CF-ChatJECuk9gYMo9sRkw

Keep in mind that this is a new location and with the staff in training it still has been a positive experience. 

I had the  Holliday Turkey sandwich  which by far has been my favorite. Something about a great turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry & mayonnaise sandwich. Makes me want one just writing about it. I recommend you check this sandwich out.  

My daughter had the Earl's  Club  (turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomatoes and  special sauce). My daughter does not like tomatoes, and ordered it without. Her order came exactly as she requested.  Had a bite of her sandwich and it was very delicious.

I have also  tried the  Chipotle Chicken Avocado & the Full  Montagu both sandwiches were also delicious. I have not had a bad sandwich and I am sure that I will be back to try the rest of the menu. 

I would recommend this place great sandwiches and the staff has been great as well.  Welcome to Summerlin Earl of Sandwich.",72MvP0CsQvUr0aWnlVAxoA,2,0,5,WWI3FvZJ2E4ou79HcJ_S3g
595699,2015-05-20,4,3fT1kcQ-MVEImGHa3hll5w,"Sandwiches are great.

Customer Services and everything else was extremely poor. I stood in front of an ordering register for nearly five minutes while the girl taking orders was learning from another employee. I understand this location is new, however a simple greeting, like hello, would have been far better customer services than being completely ignored. 

What seemed like the mangers/owners in suit seemed to be very rude to staff. The two men looked over everyone while leaning against counters. They barked orders at staff, ""All these orders are coming through without names."" I know I would not be excited to work here. Customers pay attention to these things. Poor employee training reflects this terrible training method.

There are flyers all over the counters with 'free sandwich email list promos'. I work nearby so I set up this email subscription and received the coupon for a free sandwich. I was told by a manager this coupon did not apply at this location. I did not question this and paid for my order. I do not understand why there would be promos in the store that did not apply at the store?! I only had the idea to sign up for the promo after seeing this offer IN THE STORE. 

Sandwich took far longer than expected and most of the employees looked very lost and ill trained. This is to be expected with a new business attempting to work out the kinks.

I will be taking my business else ware.",CucdZCHL9wyOx64UJbfavQ,4,1,1,-kWB0i_bYnGIUMBvIvL81Q

724470,2015-06-23,0,3fT1kcQ-MVEImGHa3hll5w,"So stoked that this spot finally opened up! I've been waiting FOREVER! 

Keep in mind, folks, that Downtown Summerlin is still in the works of being developed and yes, as some of the reviews have stated, there is no huge seating area. Which brings me to my next point: You're getting a sandwich! Not a gourmet 5-course meal. Out shopping and want a quick bite? This place is perfect. Someone made a comment about eating at the bar-like section and not being able to face the person you're hanging out with...uhhh, I don't know about you, but the last thing I want is someone watching me eating. They also put up umbrellas outside where the tables are for the peeps who actually wanna sit outside in this Vegas heat. See where I'm going here? Seating isn't that big of a deal. 
Recent complaints about how ""upscale"" Summerlin is have left me annoyed. This is the Suburbs, not the Strip. Ya'll don't need to have everything to have a good meal. Put some love and effort into the food you make and it tastes amazing. 

Furthermore, I've been ordering the Caribbean Jerk my past few visits and it's so delicious. In fact, I just ordered it right now and got some mac n' cheese with bacon as well. Yes, it does take a little bit of time to assemble the food. This is not McDonald's. They don't have sandwiches lined up sitting underneath a heater lamp ready to go. Wait patiently and your yummy food will come to you. Promise. 

The staff is friendly and they remember me when I go in also and the owner is really approachable and down to earth. Very humble person! I've even seen him sweeping outside himself. You don't see people who care about their establishments too much nowadays and still manage to stay grounded. I can tell there's a lot of hard work that's been put into this place already. 

Overall, I give this place 5 stars for the food being so gosh darn delicious and a great staff. Keep doing your thing, Earl of Sandwich and forget the haters. You're doing great so far!",cuwKel6tIxMHxErMw7AHcQ,0,0,5,3rhtem-6LvyPwh4SWSKCNA

1416514,2017-09-09,0,3fT1kcQ-MVEImGHa3hll5w,"Finally my favorite sandwich place opened up around the corner from our Vegas home. If you haven't discovered what an Earl of Sandwich is, this is the place to convince you not to eat another tasteless Subway sandwich. This location is conveniently located by the Dave & Buster's and the movie theatre in the heart of beautiful Downtown Summerlin.

For years, we had to go to the Strip to grab one of these sandwiches and if you know anything about Vegas, getting to the Strip when you craved one of these was a bit of a challenge. If you want a quick lunch in Summerlin this is a good and reliable sandwich shop. There is only one sandwich I order here and it's the Italian with a side of potato salad. The sandwich is served hot on white bread (yes I did say white bread) and with that juicy special vinaigrette tasting sauce that's on the sandwich. The beauty of this sandwich is that it's never soggy and never cold, not scorching hot but always just right. As far as the potato salad, it's not the best potato salad but it helps balance out a quick and good lunch meal.

Now if you come during the busy lunch hour, be forewarned sitting inside is a challenge as there's limited seating and you always feel cramped with the people forming a line behind you as you try to eat your lunch. The staff and owners are always personable and I've never gotten bad service here as they were always consistent.

If you've got the time this is a great outdoor dining location when it's not in the heat of the summer months, as it's got a outdoor patio with umbrellas so you're able to enjoy people watching while you're eating.",hazFjLv3rVO_9V9wSQ55Gw,0,0,4,yOYfiqG9q10DPH6Ch0KIhw

After we got our food, it was raining and there are only 4-5 seats inside Earl's so we had no where to eat our food! We ended up walking down to Regal and asking them if we bought sodas if we could eat inside and they said whatever. The food was pretty good, I never have ordered soup from earl's in the past when I've dined at the disneyland or palms hotel locations so I assumed the chicken tortilla soup had to be good but it just wasn't. The sandwich was good though, filling! So overall, I'll return but not when it's raining unless they get table covers.",cFGAElozHTdQDfHimOiSBQ,5,2,4,wXmqBLmTLxWOVrXVQ-v2iQ
1461741,2016-01-31,0,3fT1kcQ-MVEImGHa3hll5w,"Today was the first day of eating Earl of Sandwich. I've seen these places all over Vegas and I was yet to stop there and eat. Usually for my subs I eat at Capriottis or Jimmy Johns. This place looked interesting and figured it can't be that bad with as many locations as it has. 

I got the turkey, bacon, cheese, mayo. My friend got the chipotle chicken with avocado. We both enjoyed our meal a lot and it was great. It would be interesting to compare there holiday turkey sandwich to Capriotti's ""Bobbie"" as they are both turkey based with cranberry sauce and the bobbie is considered one of their best sandwiches. The sandwiches were lightly toasted and I have no complaints. 

The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. They have a place for drinks and sell other little things like gatorades. The prices are reasonable as well, I believe my sandwich was around $7-8.

It was pretty neat that they hand out beepers letting you know when your order is ready so you can explore, the store is pretty small. The service was great, no complaints but my issue really was the food itself. 

I love Thai chicken anything, so when when the ingredients include the traditional peanut sauce, I'm happy. The sauce wasn't the right consistency and VERY sweet.

Earl of Sandwich opened in Downtown Summerlin today! 

Let me just preface my review... I am a bit biased because ever since going to various Disney resorts (Downtown Disney in Orlando, Disneyland in Anaheim)  Earl of Sandwich has always offered a reasonably priced good tasting toasted sandwich in a touristy area. When they first came to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile,  they offered the same value whenever we were looking for a quick bite to eat. 

Now it is here in Downtown Summerlin and I couldn't  be happier! I really like their toasted sandwiches on their whole wheat bread. I usually get the Full Montague which is beef, turkey , swiss and cheddar with freshly cut roma tomatoes and a whole leaf green lettuce.  The cheese just oozes out of the Sammy and I am in love. The hubs always gets the original which  is beef, cheddar and horseradish. The Earl's club is pretty tasty too with turkey,  bacon, lettuce and tomatoes. Eat it asap because you want the gooey awesomeness of the melted cheese. 

Tried their tomato soup for the first time and I would say skip it... It tastes like Campbells. I have also not yet tried their salads either. 

A few things about this location. It has limited indoor seating (7 seats in total)  and unfortunately the day we went  there were thunderstorms and wet weather. So we had to get it to go. They also only have a few outdoor tables set out. I didn't notice a breakfast menu (unlike other locations) at this time but hopefully they will offer this soon as well. 

For their fast food with good quality and value,  4 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,2,4,be5jCBuNTigy4zCqqkL0Sg

At 1000 on May 18, 2015, the World's Greatest Hot Sandwiches made its long-awaited debut in Downtown Summerlin. 

Food: Terrific. Ordered the Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich. Even though I had to drive home to eat it, it was still hot and delicious. The ratio of avocado to chicken is perfect, and the chipotle sauce is fantastic. Other sandwich chains would do well to seek the balance of spice in EOS's chipotle sauce. This sandwich is what I have been waiting for for a very long time.

Service: As expected, the staff was very friendly and courteous. The manager greeted me, shook hands and took a picture with me as the first customer. Everyone seemed really pumped and excited to be there, which is a great way to start selling sandwiches in the already food-crowded Downtown Summerlin.

Decor: Inside was very clean and simple. The layout is a bit different than the ones at Planet Hollywood and Palms. A few seats inside and outside for dining space under the pavilion make for a wonderful sandwich eating experience.

I have been waiting for this location to open since Downtown Summerlin opened.

I look forward to dining here again soon.",Ozmf732ox-TNhfKrjWBXpg,3,1,5,edFVhcTbYY_XjJz-52pTQA

(Located across from Macy's, B&BW & Victoria's Secret) It's pretty small with only a handful of seats inside but ample outdoor seating. We ordered the Club & Montagu, a chocolate chip cookie & a brownie. The sandwiches were ready in about 5 minutes & we were on our way. Initially, we each had gotten our own sandwich but we weren't that hungry yet so we split the Montagu & cookie. We hadn't gotten the memo that these are hot sandwiches! But, no worries!, it was tasty, juicy, the perfect size & held together without anything dripping or smooshing out. We agreed we'd definitely get the Montagu again. I'm not one who normally encourages getting cookies or brownies at a sandwich shop, but these cookies & brownies actually looked amazing. The cookie was warm with melty chocolate chips & tasted legit homemade. Here's where we went wrong with the sandwiches- we popped the Club in the fridge to split for dinner or tomorrow. Because of the bread used, the bacon & that it's a hot sandwich, that was not the greatest idea. The bread had lost its umph, the bacon was soggy & it lost the juicy squish the Montagu had by eating it right away. We did find the bacon super overly salty though, regardless. Before ruling it out, we want to try it again & eat it when it's freshly prepared. The brownie- like the cookie- did not disappoint! It had the elements of a dense, fudgey brownie... but was actually very light & airy! It was a bit magical. All in all, my 1st EOS experience was all I'd hoped it would be.

This location is nestled in Downtown Summerlin, right in front of Rice Republic and across the street from Macy's; it's also petite, with only bar seating and outdoor patio seating. The menu is standard across all locations, so let's get straight to the food!

* Chipotle Chicken Avocado - Favorite! Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. This sandwich is very straightforward, but the combination of flavors are awesome! The chicken is moist, avocado is buttery, the chipotle flavor is mild, the bacon adds a nice pop of salt - it all works very well together! Rated: 5/5

* Caprese - Simple, yet packed with flavor and freshness! It's your classic caprese on a toasted sandwich. They add a fair amount of thick juicy slices of mozzarella and basil. They also top it with a dreamy balsamic glaze. It's definitely a love at first bite situation. This sandwich also paired very well with the creamy tomato soup. Rated: 4/5

* The Original 1762 - The bare basic. Moist roasted beef, melted cheddar, and some horseradish sauce. The roast beef was tender and flavorful. I didn't detect much cheddar and the horseradish sauce flavor was very mild. It's easy on the stomach, especially if you knocked one too many down and need some help sobering up. Rated: 3/5

* Hawaiian BBQ - Not my favorite. A large piece of chicken breast, BBQ sauce and 2 slices of canned pineapple rings. The construction of the sandwich made it messy; the insides moved around and made it awkward when I bit the sandwich. It was also overwhelmed by BBQ sauce and canned pineapple flavor, nothing exciting. Interesting concept, but poorly executed and not memorable. Rated: 1/5

* Holiday Turkey - Turkey, stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise. The overall flavor fell flat. I didn't taste the holiday flavors that were advertised. Nothing really stood out, so it all just became a bland mush. Rated: 3/5

* Creamy tomato soup - Yum! Very creamy and comforting. It has a bold tomato cream flavor and I really love the freshly fried croutons, they added amazing texture and flavor to the soup. It's my favorite soup here and always pairs well with all of the sandwiches. Rated: 5/5

* Broccoli Cheddar - Tastes just like Subway's version. Not too creamy or flavorful, more on the bland and watery side. Rated: 3/5

* Brownie - $2.29 A classic brownie that's moist, fluffy and tasty. I took two bites and saved the rest for later. It's huge! Rated: 4/5",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,82,74,4,GHQEB3ABd2_VKNX8bWiqlg

When it's cold in winter or very hot in the summer, I'm not sure the patio is much of an option.  It is a small shop as others have noted with limited seating along the front window inside.  I suppose you could do take out but that sort of negates the idea of getting a warm sandwich.

I didn't ask so I don't know what he was but I do know he left a great impression of kindness. My kids wanted the kid pizzas. He told me if I ordered the regular priced one I would save money. Most people would take advantage and not say anything, so I really appreciate his thoughtfulness. Because of that I will continue going there as it was our first time visiting! 

We sat outside in the patio area. It was a beautiful day. The same person cashiering even went outside to check on everyone when he got a moment to. I ordered an avocado turkey wrap.

But the other day, I was shopping in Downtown Summerlin and a miracle happened - I saw an Earl's!  Of course I had to stop by to get myself a sandwich.  I was greeted by a very friendly cashier.  The food also was prepared quickly, so A+ for service.  Even though it was cold, I sat outside since there are heaters outside, which was awesome since it was a very sunny and pretty day.  

Now, on to the food.  My favorite is the chipotle chicken avocado.  I got a bag of kettle chips and some earl grey lemonade on the side.  Holy moly was it delicious.  The bread was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  There was the perfect amount of chicken and avocado and the chipotle spread was on point.  The chips were nothing too out of this world, but they were very tasty and complimented the sandwich well.  The earl grey lemonade is especially tasty - not overly sweet at all!

Wrong!  There are no tables inside, just in the outdoor patio.  But it was freezing out, not a night to dine alfresco.  And since I am a princess at heart, I can take only so much of fast food ambience and I don't like to sit at a counter that faces the street.  How would I monitor the health department violations taking place behind me? :)  And the chairs are too low for little me. Our plan was to take the sandwiches, do a few errands, then eat at home.  But when they arrived hot, we didn't really have a choice.

But the food is the star, and the food is okay.  I had The Original 1762 - roast beef, cheddar & horseradish sauce - which was good but seemed a little skimpy.  Hubby had the Full Montagu - roast beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce.  His had considerably more filling, which I would expect with all those ingredients, but they were the same price, which shouldn't be.

The owner was very friendly and checked on us several times, which was appreciated.  But though good, the sandwich wasn't all that satisfying and neither was the venue.  Perhaps when the weather gets nicer, I'll go back.  Until then...",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,6,3,YIMgBRcAwEbCXevKyxM3Wg

We both ordered the Montague sandwich... Usually the sandwiches here are great especially when Rae's wife is there at night. We usually talk a little and I always tell her how great the sandwiches are, however this was not the case last Thursday night.  The Roast Beef was so rare there was blood on the bread which made the bread wet, plus there were strings in the Roast Beef.  As you took a bite and started to chew you had this stringy thing in your mouth that you couldn't swallow and had to spit out, not once but a number of times.  The tomatoes tasted like vinegar and were very thickly sliced, the turkey was OK but the whole sandwich was sloppily made and we didn't enjoy it at all.  I called the owner Rae the next day to tell him about our experience and he said ""We had a mystery shopper come in to our store and she scored us very well""???? What do I care about the mystery shopper? Had she eaten there last Thursday night she would have not given you great marks had she ordered the Montague sandwich.  Rae told me everything is prepared DAILY, and he said when he slices the Roast Beef he SEES THE STRINGS IN THE MEAT, so why doesn't he remove them,  instead of leaving them there and serving stringy roast beef to his customers?  Also he said sometimes the Roast Beef comes in medium, well done, pink and sometimes very rare, so I guess we had the very rare one which soaked the bread and turned it pink and leaving the stringy parts in really made for a horrible sandwich.  The fact that the owner knows there are strings in the meat and doesn't remove them before putting the meat in a sandwich is not right.  Anyway we both had tummy aches and kept repeating the sandwich all night, we took a tummy pill and finally got some relief.  Terrible sandwich.... do not get the Montague unless you like stringy raw roast beef and wet bread soaked in the blood of the roast beef.

I usually love Earl's but today, I felt like there was BBQ sauce instead of chipotle sauce on my sandwich. Maybe it was my taste buds but it wasn't what I am used to or they changed the sauce? However, for a quick stop for food, they are very kind, the food quality was great, and I was very satisfied with my meal.

4750952,2016-04-07,1,3fT1kcQ-MVEImGHa3hll5w,"I have gone here for quite a few times but I've only sporadically started to check into places. I first came to this place when the mall opened. There wasn't too many places to eat. The better half loves sandwiches and I am about half and half. Let's just say I ate a lot of sandwiches for school in my day and it's not something I look forward to eating that often. Man, I remember eating Webber and PBJ more than I care to when I was an undergrad.

So, when the placed opened, we sat outside because it is limited seating inside. Then again, the mall is beautiful and if the weather is nice, it really is nice sitting outside, chatting, munching, and people watching. It also gives me quite an amusement to see the other Chinese restaurant carting their Dim Sum around. That's just me though.

Anyway, the owner met us inside and explained to me their sandwiches. Nice guy. I believe his name was Ray? It's been a while, sorry ""Ray"" if that's not your name. Anyway, we got our sandwiches relatively quickly, maybe 5 min? It wasn't very busy or anything. As we headed outside, Ray came and wiped down the table we were sitting some more. So we chatted a bit too. Turns out he worked for the owner who owned the chain. Since he liked him, he let him open one at Downtown Summerlin. I always like seeing hard working guys get ahead. But you didn't come to a session of Dr Phil. Or that idiot with the megaphone that masquerades as a carpenter (yes, I saw him when he was a pip squeak working in Trading Places with Paige. TLC was smart enough not to give him a megaphone BTW...but I digress). He of ""I'll build you a house because you are needy but before I block it with my big bus, Imma gonna make you cry like you've never cried before, before I let you have the keys"" fame...Tye Pennington. I thought it was the last I'd see that guy after ABC came to their senses and canned him but he's squirmed into Food Network. Now he's gone after poor going under restaurants and making them ball their eyes out before giving them a pretty lame makeover (Restaurant Impossible still has the upper hand in design bub) and making the owners pretend shock and surprise before handing over the keys. I sure Earl's doesn't fall into that sad state...not of bankruptcy but letting that buffoon into their place. Heh.

So the sandwich...I got the Full Montague turkey and roast beef. I was pleasantly surprised at how best the sandwich was made and folded in its paper/foil wrapper. The bread had a nice crust to it but not so crusty that it serrates your cheeks when you bite into it (that's one of the reasons I don't care for sandwiches that often, many ppl over toast those buns like we are going to use them as weapons in a Viking food fight or something). The meat is tasty and lean.

So all in all, a pretty good place to get a sandwich if you are moseying around the mall but can't think of what to eat. It's certainly healthier than grabbing a burger. Quite frankly, tastier too. Anyway, I think you will find his place chill and great place to stop by and take a load off your feet. We came here for Halloween too and watched all the costumes waltz by along with the car show they had at the same time. So, yeah, we occasionally come grab a bite here or at Pieology.

As an added bonus, some guy may be singing in the plaza in front of Earls and you get to hear some live music too. Yeah it's nothing fancy and you won't get crappy service like Kona Grill. There's no hostesses ignoring you and busy holding up walls around here either. No one cares what you are dressed in. So if you are into that kind of thing, this may be too Plebeian for you. :)",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,3,2,4,o6swXuom-tdpP0Y5LZjQyQ

From what I've read from negative reviews, this a different concept than the others, with the Summerlin location being more of an ""express"" restaurant. 

We were cheerfully greeted by Rey, the cashier. Noting it was our first time, he described the popular sandwiches. I asked him to describe the tuna melt sandwich, to which he listed the ingredients and concluded with ""most people like their tuna cold, but some like it hot."" This made me ""lol"" in my head and think, ""but I wanted to know HOW it tasted. Tangy? Creamy? Peppery?"" I said I would try the Chipotle Chicken Avocado instead. Husband had the Original 1762. Mac & Cheese on the side.

Before we sat down, Rey kindly wiped and dried the counter. I later watched him observe the sun and rotate some umbrellas to better shade the tables. Good guy, that guy!

I thought the sandwiches were a perfect size. I could have stopped at half, but didn't, and ended up feeling quite full after finishing. Sometimes restaurants confuse chipotle with bbq, but this isn't the case at Earl. The chipotle is a smoky flavor that tastes a little ""hot"" without the actual spiciness, if that makes sense. Husband enjoyed the horseradish kick and found the meat to be tender, not too fatty, and cooked perfectly.

The Earl's version had chicken, bacon, cukes, tomatoes and dried cranberries with a great mix of spring greens. They don't have blue cheese dressing (yikes!) so I asked for vinaigrette instead of the ranch they serve it with. I did miss the egg and avocado that a Cobb should have and especially the blue cheese! This one did have some cheddar cheese instead. 
Maybe this is a healthier version of the Cobb. 

Anyways, it was a great salad and the chicken was tasty, it had lemon pepper or something seasoning. Lots of bacon also and they aren't stingy with any of the ingredients. One of the best quality salads I've had in a while and better than the sandwiches I've had here.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,0,4,FgOndF_QALbO9B1p6823dg

I was surprised to see so many gluten free options, and they were all excellent! Friendly staff, clean store and great food!",Ri3exmOUQLb1_RFvnmto6w,0,0,5,lAShLfDnZSY82U1-I6mU8g

The sandwiches are delicious and you receive great service. Each sandwich is between $5.99-$6.99. The manager is very kind and welcomes you at your table or helps out at the cash register. Tasty sandwiches and short waiting. My total favorite is the Chipotle Chicken Avocado with Wheat Bread. You can really taste the freshness in any kind of sandwiches. I can just say enjoy!,NbhMH4XcHylnROs4oUlfSw,0,0,5,Khi7qAf6E5BFGpIhxPMO1g

We had a coupon so a coworker and I wandered over to take advantage of the BOGO option before it expired. The shop is smaller than others I have visited and they were slower than others as well. There weren't many people waiting for food yet it took a bit for our sandwiches to be ready. Probably because they offer online ordering and delivery so I can't fault them for that. 

I ordered the original, which is what I typically order, but it was not good. The sandwich was soggy and the meat was a chewy and gristly. It was very unappetizing. 

I don't see myself making any special effort to return.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,5,2,TzUVyaSNnh5RzqlgGGVl2A
