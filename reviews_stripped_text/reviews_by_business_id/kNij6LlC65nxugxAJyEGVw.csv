First time It took over an hour and a half & when we opened the boxes all of the toppings had slid over to one side. Tonight, our 2nd time, delivery took even longer & they brought the wrong pizza.

I could have walked there and back several times over and gotten the food myself.

Needless to say, our order was barely warm and can't really vouch for the flavor. Sorry PJ's, we're sticking with Dominoes.",GN9hYtWEPIGvwmJK4bTDIg,1,0,1,wshqZK8E1pNK3m8wyT0u4g

Saying you called the number listed with no response and I have no missed calls... Negative one for lying and an additional negative for not having my topping and or replacing it with something else.

I like the $10,3 topping, pan special.  I get ranch sauce with chicken, onion, and pineapple.  Never fails, ALWAYS AWESOME!!  Maybe because I get the ranch they're fresher?  Maybe the others are ready sitting around?  

I was so impressed I got 2 more this month and then got each of my 2 daughters (FL) and one of my sisters (FL as well) $25 gift e-cards.  And EACH gift card came with a FREE 1-topping large for ME!!  Since I had pigged out twice already this month I gave the free ones to friends.

Delivery MAY be a tad slow, but I live so close I'm going to do carryout from now on.  That way if I ever do get a bad pizza I can turn it down right there.  It also avoids the STUPID $3.35 delivery fee....which they say is NOT a tip!!  I live a block away....Johnny WTF!?!",jmoLqAUvM4tkf2uknRx16g,2,0,4,_O3TF4T16fUettPMgjq5xw

1095871,2014-12-23,0,kNij6LlC65nxugxAJyEGVw,I am and will always be a papa johns hater. I'm writing this review because I happened to see one of their lovely delivery drives lack work ethic. I was hanging out at a local vape shop and they had ordered pizza. Delivery dude literally hung out for like 30 mins asking about different mods and looked at juice. I noticed he had another pizza in his bag thing. I would hate to be the receiver of that other pizza. Well if that customer even got it.  If some younger again kid with long light brown hair delivers your pizza good luck to you friend.,jbeyWyl-5_YMbpcppdTZ9w,0,0,1,9OWEcVvieox5pcMEPk5yzw

The cookie was too sweet, too small, too thin. Never get this. A waste of money completely.

We gave directions but his phone died or he cut us off. We called back at 1:15 and then re-ordered at 1:28pm. At 2:30pm we called back and was told they hadn't even made our pizza as they were waiting for another driver. This is totally unacceptable.

I literally live not even 3 minutes from the store location.  I called at an hour to find out where the pizza was and was told it was on the way.  At 1 hour and 20 minutes I called the store location again and spoke with a manager named Trinity.  She stated that the pizza was on the way as well.  The pizza arrived approximately 2 minutes after the call to the manager Trinity.  I spoke with the driver and asked why it took so long and he stated that they only had 3 drivers and the approximate wait time was 1 hour and 20 minute.  I paid the driver and when I got the pizza inside it was not even warm anymore.,_XcsG3krzuXLXaLDncBITQ,2,1,1,bffiKNqdHrEIYJhPqLheZQ

An hour passes and still no pizza. (fyi it's Wednesday night and I live one mile away) I give them a call and ask about my order. The guy puts me on hold and comes back after a minute or two saying that his driver is leaving now.. I should have canceled my order because when the pizza arrived it was COLD and cardboard box hard. Ahh I'm so irritated. I had to put it in the microwave to make it consumable :(  3 bites and I'm done. Wasted my money and time.

Today I wanted to write a great review for each of the delivery drivers I got to meet since I've been a customer.

I ordered online which was simple, I watched an animated process (in between news) and it was delivered very timely, exactly as ordered. The driver was a nice clean cut young man who handed off a delicious pizza and brownies...and root beer of course. I have ordered Domino's since I bought a place here, and I'm switching to Papa John's.

I did not experience the negative doo-doo the other reviewer's have...I own my own business which causes me to have to order out occasionally, and this was perfect for me. I recommend this store.",IAvvFaXLbsQekE8KRNEsAg,1,0,5,bGNjY0R2iyGaXiDoQqXPNA

I went inside once to pick it up and the staff was less than cordial. They weren't rude, just unpleasant. 
The drivers are decent, just the entire operation is slow. When I was zoned to receive delivery from the one on sunset and pecos, which is about  6 miles away, I always received it in about 40 minutes or less.
My other issue is in the quality. It doesn't taste the same as other John's around town. They also are scrimpy with their sauce, even if you ask for extra.
