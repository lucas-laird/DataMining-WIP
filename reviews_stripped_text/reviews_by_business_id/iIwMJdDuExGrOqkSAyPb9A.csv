I watched him as he takes orders of other customers and is in a speed race again. Does not even hand the cup to the customer, customer asked for it and pointed to it.

Not only teriyaki bowls also have yakisoda bowls and even go with brown rice instead of white rice (not all places offer brown rice for substitute).. They even sell boba style drinks or thai tea.

The interior design another thing that love from the asian mural artwork along one whole wall. the asian lanterns hanging above for lighting, and enjoy the vibe of it. 

The food I ordered the yakudosha chicken and steak combo! Both the chicken and steak was cooked perfectly moist, hot, and enjoy the spicy seasoning on top (I recommend if like spicy food) the beef. The portion size for the protein is good size and the amount of vegetables love fact they not skimpy. It nice assortment of vegetables then typical more chain teriyaki joints. I had broccoli, cabbage, carrots, zucchini, and even cauliflower. All the vegetables was cooked perfect. The yakisoda noodles was again cooked perfection not over cooked noodles but just right. Every bite get great balance of all three. The egg roll that comes with the combo enjoy the fact it was not your typical deep fried egg roll. Instead they grill the egg roll. It taste lot better.

The food: I have ordered almost everything from their menu at one point, but my favorite is just a steak bowl. The meat is always great tasting and I love the vegetables they add in the food. JUST A TIP, order the small portion. It's cheaper and has the same amount of food. The larger size is just in a bigger container. Besides this, the food is always satisfying. 

The drinks: they do sell boba and milk tea here, and it's very mediocre. I am a boba and milk tea snob, so I judge very critically about this. It is good here, but I rarely get my milk tea or boba from here. 

The service: I have never had to wait more than 5 min for food here. The workers are always polite and fast. I have been here with 10 people in the store and also while it's empty, both times it was relatively fast.

Stopped in to get a bowl cause I remembered back in the day this place use to be pretty good. Anyway, I ordered the spicy steak and broccoli bowl with white rice to go.  As I'm driving home I start to take a few bites.  By the third bite I noticed that there was a hair in my food.  By this time I'm grossed out and I call the restaurant to let them know what happened.  

The manager tells me that they would replace the bowl and all I would need to do was give up my name when I came back.

Speed it up to today, I'm in the area and I decided to stop in.  I look at the sign and I'm like cool I still got 20 minutes.  I'm waiting at the counter for someone to come to the front.  I say excuse me a couple of times but still no acknowledgement.

After about seven minutes the cashier finally comes to take my order.  I explain that I should have a credit due to the hair in my food incident.  She looks in the computer and tells me that she can't find a credit. Slides me a pen and receipt paper to write down my name and number and proceeds to say the manager would call me when she finds the credit! WTF!!!

You can find your typical teriyaki bowl here. Good amount of veggies. Not too overbearing on the rice. Toppings include beef, shrimp, salmon and chicken. The nice thing about this place is that you can pick dark meat or light meat chicken. Their teriyaki sauce isn't too overbearing or sweet. It's quite light and flavorful enough that you can taste the other ingredients in the bowl. 

Yakisoba bowls are also an option here. If you're a noodle person, this is for you! Yakisoba is a dish that can get easily salty when the sauce is reduced down while cooking. The yakisoba here isn't too salty or greasy. It's quite alright. You can add the toppings mentioned above in your yakisoba bowl. 

What I really appreciate about this place is the choice of white steamed rice or brown rice. This Samurai Sam's is located right across the street from LVAC and I'm sure health nuts will appreciate this.

The regular bowls are decent sized. Enough for a healthy meal after a work out. If you're hungry and need something more than that, they do offer ""sumo"" sized bowls. These are HUGE. I've gotten the sumo bowl before and I wasn't able to finish it in one sitting. 

Samurai Sam's always has Groupon deals going on. For what it is, I feel as though they Samurai Sam's is a little overpriced. But their Groupon deals makes this place way affordable (it's usually $6 for $12 worth). So keep an eye out for that!

We ordered 30 minutes prior to leaving due to the previous days delay and upon arriving, we pay, sit, and wait. Then about 5 other customer comes and one by one, each got their food and of course, me and my co workers are standing around waiting for Jesus's resurrection. Which, spoiler alert, hasn't happened.

So after about 20 minutes and we were still empty handed, I politely came up and asked where my friggety fraggetty food was. I was first told our good was given to someone else, so they whipped up a bowl i literally 30 sec. 1, ONE, O N E bowl. So I was like ""wait a minute, Wheres the rest of it..."" so they scramble some more, then out of nowhere, a bag with my order appear...cold and it turns out I almost took SOMEONE ELSE's order.

There's not much to say.. It's a tad better than your standard chicken teriyaki place.. I say this because they not only have rice bowls but they also have yakisoba noodles and salads. They also offer steak, shrimp, salmon, white meat chicken and dark meat chicken. So definitely more options than Yoshinoya..  If you're trying to be healthier opt for the brown rice instead of white or just get the rice-less bowl like I did.. with white meat chicken and lots of steamed veggies.

Service was friendly, but took a bit longer than I expected...especially since I was the only person there.",bKhfZoTppbT2cnnP38wiUw,1,0,3,ZQWGbaof9vV81J_9stnFbA
5167176,2011-11-06,0,iIwMJdDuExGrOqkSAyPb9A,"I ordered a Yakisoba with chicken here yesterday with my friend.  The noodles were perfectly cooked, not soggy and seasoned well.  The chicken tasted awesome.  The barbecue taste was just unbelievably unforgettable.  As for the vegetables, they were also cooked perfectly, not overly done, nor undercooked.  Overall, the food here is the best Samurai Sam's I've ever had.  

Their quality of food can't be beat against other Samurai Sam's Teriyaki Grill Restaurant.  I don't think I'll get food from any other Samurai Sam's.  Oh, and service is always the best.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,1,1,4,qTQe2VWW18sNsawqsb4Mig

I was standing at the front and she helped someone  behind me first, weird but whatever. So i ordered 2 goliath bowls, one regular one with a request of no rice, the other with extra chicken which I was charged for . Simple right? wrong, we left as we had already waited for a to go order 30 min. Got home and it was wrong, called them and said nicely that our order was wrong, she said ... yeah. I said well can we get it fixed, she said call back tomorrow and talk to a manager. Needless to say wont be back to this location.",5mvzNyd4t4XTissmJOGMhQ,1,0,1,Cee6CLnH6bzut0l0GCYW6A
5379665,2018-02-14,0,iIwMJdDuExGrOqkSAyPb9A,"My boyfriend and I have tried Samurai Sam's twice. Both times, he picked it up and brought it home to me, so I haven't been inside and not in a position to comment on the customer service experience, anything I've witnessed in food preparation, or the cleanliness or atmosphere of the restaurant. Both times, my boyfriend bought me the shrimp bowl with brown rice and veggies. Both times it was very tasty. We recently moved from Southern California and enjoy Waba Grill, but couldn't find any Wabas in Vegas, so Samurai Sam's was the next best thing. I thought it was going to turn out to be even better than Waba Grill, but now I'm honestly reluctant to eat here again after reading the recent reviews reporting food poisoning, hair in the food, and the cook scraping the knife on the edge of the trash can then still using the same knife to prepare the food. I'll leave four stars for now because I personally have not had a bad experience here so far, but I may be updating my review in the future... if I feel like taking that risk. If we ever get food from Samurai Sam's again, I'll be sure to tell my boyfriend to observe the food preparation very carefully, or I'll observe it myself if I ever go inside.",8tJmL7I8btak84XAzI1ZaQ,0,0,4,Mm9Pin_bC8f26bUUj7WQrQ

5918754,2011-07-24,1,iIwMJdDuExGrOqkSAyPb9A,"Redeemed my Groupon here today.  The restaurant wasn't busy when I arrived around 8pm, and they waited patiently for me to review their menu (first time visitor) and finally placed my order.  With the Groupon $12 credit, I only paid another $3 for a large Chicken Bowl Combo and a Chicken Wrap (all upgraded with Brown Rice and the rice bowl topped with their Spicy Sauce).  But there were a steady flow of customers that came and went during my meal, mostly ordering take-outs.

The portions served here are decent, especially the wrap/burrito.  And it was pretty good, except I thought it could be ""enhanced"" with more teriyaki sauce (packed with a lot of brown rice which makes the whole mouthful of chicken wrap tastes dry).  The Chicken Bowl is pretty much the same thing, except obviously served in a bowl and I liked the spicy upgraded version of the sauce.

Price-wise, it seems like a lot.  But with the healthy portion size that will leave you satisfied, I think it was A-OK.

The restaurant is decorated with Samurai Sam motif wall paper, with Kanji characters, origami instructions, etc. decorating one side of the wall.  I thought it was pretty neat.  It is furnished with small tables and chairs that are typical of these fast-casual chain restaurants, which are comfortable to use during your meal, but not comfy enough to spend a lazy afternoon chilling or reading your book.

The service is surprisingly fast.  My order was complete just a minute or two after I filled my cup with sodas and started to read a library book I had brought with me.

They also have a promotion of 10% off for LVAV members with a current ID, which at least one lady (she was cute and besides myself, might just be the best looking person to drop by the entire time I was there :p ) took advantaged of.  

Overall, it is a nice little take-out or dine-in fast casual restaurant serving teriyaki themed menu.  If I am in the area and in the mood for teriyaki chicken or steak, I would drop by.  Heard their teriyake salmon is good, so maybe I will try that in the future.

Ambiance:  3.5/5

Cleanliness: 4.5/5

Food:  3/5  Not gourmet, but hits the spot when you crave some teriyaki.

Service:  3.5/5  Fast service!

Price:  3/5  You get what you pay for.

Location:  SW part of town, and not close to the Strip, so definitely for locals working, residing in the area.

Parking:  4/5  Plenty of parking 90% of the time.

5948108,2018-06-30,0,iIwMJdDuExGrOqkSAyPb9A,"Nice little dine-in... service was mediocre for the most part but the cashier was very friendly & customer service is what Vegas lacks come the up & coming younger generation these days. There was a line & the cashier was trying to work fast but of course you can only do what you can do. Although, another young lady just sat next to her on her cell phone & watched the line sit with not even the slightest intent to offer assistance to the customers or her coworker. I stood at the counter patiently for about 5mins after I received my order just for a cup of ice & YES all while the girl on her phone glanced at me but turned away with no regards! SMDH! Word of advice to avoid unnecessary situations that seem more or less unprofessional... personal cell phones should be used on ""personal"" time & not be in use while on the clock unless your paying employees to sit around on their phone. Otherwise if not on the clock do not be behind the counter seeming as if though you have absolutely no professionalism. Just a thought ehhh... on a different note, food tasted great- prices a little high for the portions but were alright size (could use larger veggie portions) but good place none the less.",ghW-kD3SR52-Nn8kkcew8A,0,0,3,gyl6AZDatdYR-wY3mlGgCA

The location is nice enough and the employees are friendly. I ordered the chicken yakisoba bowl and my fella ordered the sweet and spicy chicken bowl. We also shared an order of gyoza.

My noodles were slightly dry and not particularly plentiful for the price. My fella enjoyed his, but I thought it was just too sweet and not enough spice. The gyoza was nothing memorable.

Overall, the place is just ok and if not for the Groupon I think I would've felt a little cheated on the price. I probably won't be a regular here, but I can see it being a good go-to place for an after the gym dinner.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,1,2,2,5CUdvzMucZDcbpvyUqig2Q
