955087,2017-03-30,0,VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw,"Update!!!! Okay, so I'll start with this: Please, please, please! BELIEVE the negative reviews of this business, and I use the word ""business"" loosely. Those reviewer's who have commented that the people working at this establishment are unprofessional, lacking in the customer service arena, and are just down right nasty, are spot on in their assessment.

 I've ordered from them in the past, about 5 times, to be exact, and I've always spent close to $80 on each occasion. Up until my last order, (which I did not write a review of) I've been relatively satisfied. My last order was about 7 months ago. The food was not as good as I remembered. Pizza was super salty, fries were old and cold. The wings were just okay, the garlic balls were nothing to brag about and the chicken strips were hard and overcooked. The anti-pasta salad I ordered was alright. But, I let it be, didn't review, just figured they may have had an off night. Whatever, but it did make me hesitant to order from them in the future. Anyways, I never forgot that I once loved their food, though. Their pizza, I thought was the best in town. The wings were delicious too. So, yesterday, March 29, 2017 I had a craving for pizza, and decided to order an 18"" pepperoni and sausage,  wings, and two double bacon cheeseburgers, all of which are available at Napoli's. So, I called in to place an order for delivery. Whoever the woman is who usually answers the phone just doesn't seem customer friendly. When you call in they always just immediately put you on hold. Sure, they quickly say ""Napoli's, can you please hold,"" yet they never ever wait for the customer to respond. And then, you never know how long they're going to keep you on hold. I was on hold for a while before I hung up and called back(keep in mind that this has been the case each time I've called to place an order). Same thing that time around too. So I wait, and wait, then finally a man gets on the line and asks what I want. I begin telling him my order only to be rudely told, ""I cannot hear you,"" or "" I cannot understand you."" Then all of a sudden my call is disconnected. He seemed impatient and I felt rushed. I never called back and I never will again. 

See, this isn't the first time I've felt that they're just not conducting business in a way that treats customers with respect...at all. And, I know I've previously ordered from them, but I did notice then, as well, that they're just rude for no apparent reason. From my perspective, they do not care the least bit about customers, orders, quality of their food. It's like for them, if it's good it's good, if it's bad well, oh well. If you aren't satisfied with your long delivery wait, hey, oh well, even though you, the customer, were told an earlier deliver time that actually exceeds even 40 min.  I've seen in no way how they compensate for any mistakes they make, rather it's as all on the customer, even if the issue lies on the business owners and employees. That's simply not good business. The goal should be to build a good reputation within the community, by being fair, treating people (especially the one's supporting your business) with respect, and correcting any mistakes that may have been made on the business end. It's not hard. To me, it seems like they do not want paying, and possibly longtime loyal customers. And, I just don't understand it. 

Anyways, though I once loved their food, specifically their pizza, fries, and wings, I can no longer support Napoli's. I can't bring myself to give any more of my money to a restaurant that I feel doesn't value it's customers, and who doesn't take customer concerns seriously. I mean, seriously? I do not recommend to anyone. Support establishments that are consistent and who make customers and the service they deliver to them, a top priority.",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,2,0,1,Cr30J-MC2-bUI5gzPcBNVg

I was ordering an 18inch with 20 wings & some fries. The girl who answered offered me a special for the pizza with one topping & the wings. I asked her about 6 to 7 what would be the difference in adding two more toppings to the pizza. She kept cutting me off & asking anything else after I kept asking what's the difference....

When I got my delivery, they forgot my large ranch, no biggie it happens right, so I just called them and asked to bring it back out. The manager came in the phone and wanted to give me credit for it and not bring it back out, which didn't work for me because everything I ordered is an item we use ranch on so I declined that offer and asked him to please send it out. Then he became really petty and said ""well I did not charge you for the extra tzaziki sauce you asked for, so I will send the driver out with your large ranch but you will need to pay him $1.00 for the sauce I didn't charge you for."" VERY PETTY. First off I didn't ask you not to charge me for a sauce but whatever, send the ranch, so I can enjoy the 53.41 worth of food that I have sitting here in front of me. 
Meanwhile My daughter ate her 10"" cheese pizza, and with the small cup of ranch that I did have I had my cheese sticks and 2 of 10 chicken fingers I ordered. Then I wait, and I wait some more. 45 minutes have passed since I called back for my ranch. The food is all cold. I put it back in the bag and headed out to bring it back. As I was pulling into to restaurant, which is only about 6 minutes away from my home, the delivery driver called that he is at my house with the ranch, and I told him I was back at the store to return the cold food.
I told the manager (who I think is the owner maybe) at the store I was returning everything except the small cheese pizza and the mozzarella sticks. He gave my a hard time that I was returning almost the whole order over ranch, and I tried to explain that it's now being returned because it's cold. We tried to start eating and wait for the delivery, shouldn't have been a problem, you don't have to cook ranch and we are 6 minutes away, but because it took you 45 minutes to bring me the ranch that I ordered and paid for previously (which is longer than it took for you to deliver the original food order....... and which I am certain he did out of spite because he was angry for whatever reason that I wanted the ranch delivered and not put on my account as a credit) the food is all now cold.... it was not my intention to return it, we just wanted to eat.
He finally agreed that he was going to give me a refund minus those two items that I told him we consumed. THE REAL KICKER AND WHAT REALLY PROMPTED ME TO WRITE MY First EVER YELP REVIEW, is that then he actually went through and opened each box and started counting pieces of food, and he a actually PRORATED the refund cost of the chicken fingers, since I did eat 2 of 10..... I would rather have had my ranch and eaten more. So I am awaiting a partial refund, for which I wasn't given a receipt and am not even sure if I will get or not. 
It was a very insulting experience, and unfortunately will be my last order with Napoli. Kinda sucks for me because I like the food, but will kinda suck for them too because when I order there for work every week it's an order for 20-30 people, and usually is $250-$300+ ,  it I will definitely order elsewhere after being treated that way.",6pmGIjbfT9KspfxtJYdYLw,0,0,1,jo6X_bwj_a19dQB_BtsA5A

Probably won't order from there again.",crF6DH2JyIdNRvM16y65rw,2,0,2,8GlAunWWylRkaPtD0wLuDQ

This time we ordered Boston Clam Chowder & Cream of Broccoli soup- both were good and came with saltines.
Next: Hot Subs -
Philly Steak and Sausage & Peppers Parmesan  Both served with Fries. Again, very good! Marinara served on the side so no soggy sandwhich upon arrival! Yaaaay!
Dessert: Brownie and Carrot Cake. Sorry but these were just-Meh...a little dry but not horrible.
All in all it was A LOT of food. We couldnt eat it all so leftovers tomorrow.
I added an extra star because the delivery time was greatly improved! I was quoted about 1 hour 10 min, but our food arrived in about 35-40 minutes. Much better! Keep that delivery time reasonable and you will get more of our business. 
Thanks Napoli Pizza !",sjYGkjQ1he0FMzMw-vnIWQ,3,0,4,ggQ8kLhdG2D-GnTqccq4og
5351555,2011-07-08,0,VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw,The pizza is good long as the delivery driver makes sure it doesnt shift. And when you get it the cheese slid to one side. But that only happened once. The cheesesteaks and fries are delicious. And I recommend trying a italian soda. The Zeppolis arent on par with Villa Pizza but are still delicious. And their delivery times. They quote you a time and show up quicker which is awesome when youve been drinking and are hungry. Plus they remember you by phone number so you dont need to give your addy each and every time.

5540665,2015-05-26,0,VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw,"For new York/New Jersey style pizza this is the place to go. Similar to nj the slices are huge and the interior Italian like. The staff is friendly, service is fast and the pizza is fresh. Really fresh.even slices come from whole pizzas that area freshly cooked in the back.No leftover old pizza being served here. 

As for the pizza itself it's huge, with puffy crusts and tons of cheese. If you get a topping they are also generous with those. The lunch special is two huge slices and a drink for 5.95 plus tax, you can't really beat that. The slices alone are the size of a small pizza. 

Every time I come here the staff Remembers me and are very personal.I've enjoyed finding this place and getting to know the staff and trying their different pizzas, as I've never been disappointed. I come back here as often as I can because I love it!",BIcfTJw4-76b9NuZUgpKIA,1,0,5,DRd35O0k2zNFj_uGpIDdig

So I called and placed an order for their special, which is a 16"" pie with one topping for pick up only for $8.99. I also ordered 10 spicy honey bbq wings and an order of cinnamon zepolis. My total was $24 and change. Now we are from the East coast. From NY so we know some good pizza. I must say this is some good pizza. The wings were also really good!! Zeppelins were over rated.

Pizza and salad were average.  I'll never order from here again.  Two hours is too long to wait for a pizza.

5871275,2015-08-22,0,VfxlkvZQkLr9tu_w1SU_iw,"My husband accidentally took my car keys with him to work, and we hadn't gone grocery shopping yet. So for lunch, I decided to order delivery. I've been wanting to try Napoli's for a while so decided on that. I ordered their chicken strips and fries, an extra ranch, and a 2-liter of coke.

I placed my order about 12:10pm. I didn't get my food until 1:40pm, possibly closer to 2pm. Seems a little ridiculous on a middle of the week day but whatever.

GOOD:
My order was 100% correct which surprised me. Usually deliveries always result in them forgetting something.

My food was hot, ranch was homemade, and the Coke was cold.

BAD:
The delivery man seemed very upset and eager to leave me. If I hadn't already tipped online, I'm not sure I would have tipped him as well as I had.

The chicken and fries were definitely not made by them. I've tasted this exact brand of chicken tender and french fry before. What's sad is, they weren't even good. The fries  tasted like reheated leftovers from the night before. The chicken was over cooked and hard to chew.

I ended up throwing away my meal. Wouldn't order from here again. Only gave two stars instead of one because my order was correct and the appropriate temperature.",OCz9lJa59X2YXkQy9u2-0Q,2,0,2,04JQW2YRolDlFA9ZkBwr1Q
