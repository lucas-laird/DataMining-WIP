I'm very surprised that there are not better reviews. I really liked this place! Being an Interior Designer there was so much to see in the decor, so many cool finishes. But on to the food...

I went there a couple times this/last year when I was in Vegas for NYE, and I was a happy customer! What I keep craving and sad to know that I don't be eating there were the potatoes! OH MY! They were crispy on the outside and soft and full of flavor on the inside. There was no need to add ketchup, salt, pepper nor hot sauce! Actually...I did try it with Tabasco and they were yummy like that as well. Even their fruit salad was amazing. One of the fruits was passion fruit! MY FAV!! The coffee was also very good (I think that's when I became a coffee addict) and their juices were yummy as well, I liked the OJ and watermelon!

I am also a sucker for presentation and good service, which they had. The girls in the from seemed snobby and like they did not want to be working there (hence the 4 stars) But every waiter we got was super nice! And of course the food was presented so pretty!

Ohh...and big plus on the rest rooms! Loved them! They are for both Men and Women because each bathroom has its sink inside with nice big doors.


Really a bummer it's not there anymore!",UdLuJq3xnUMxvmMuyfg5hw,0,0,4,pMkMQQmGsET5xKbjS42Ajg
784602,2010-08-06,0,LH-DYCy9v3kM4JRtpcquxw,"My husband and I are just returning from a week in Vegas staying at the Bellagio. On this and previous vacations here we have enjoyed eating our breakfast al fresco at the pool cafe. However, with the addition of the City Center complex and thanks to a line at the pool cafe we have found a new favorite for breakfast at Silk Road in Vdara. It is simply one of our very favorite places for breakfast EVER!!!  

We just ate there the past three mornings-phenomenal!  I can't say enough good things about it and the waitstaff- a different one each day and they were all The French press coffee is smooth and perfectly brewed.  We had omelettes the first day with pastries and the tropical fruit. The omelttes were solidly good and the tropical fruit excellent with beautiful presentation and a decadent side of sweet tahini yogurt. There was even a half of a fresh lilikoi (passion fruit)!  

The second morning we again shared a continental breakfast with pastries, juice, and coffee along with the tropical fruit.  I chose the morning sliders-two small tenderloin sandwiches and a third sandwich as a take on bacon, egg, and cheese all on brioches. Wow!!!  My husband had the turkey hash which was also fabulous!  It is a hash of turkey and potatoes but with an alluring blend of Turkish spices and topped with two eggs.  Soooo tasty! 

This morning we had the same as yesterday except I tried the signature Eggs Eggs Eggs dish and my husband opted for egg whites scrambled on top of his hash. The Eggs Eggs Eggs dish is a trio of takes on classic egg dishes-a poached egg atop the turkey hash topped lightly with hollandaise, a fried quail atop a tasty fried (but not greasy) potato cake, and scrambled egg served in a shell upon steamed spinach all topped with a light salt foam.  Oh boy!!!  

Overall everything was get-it-again worthy. Can't wait to eat breakfast here again on future trips!",HjmDe3_vg8c6QB13mUUSZw,1,0,5,47zKCkDS6RDrgxVreN8heQ
875903,2010-04-01,0,LH-DYCy9v3kM4JRtpcquxw,"We ate breakfast here. Their speciality is the Eggs, eggs, eggs. It is eggs cooked three ways: scrambled, fried and poached. The dish looked really nice. It's a small portion, which we actually liked (breakfast tends to be too large in terms of portions). The taste was OK. Nothing spectacular. We also sampled the ricotta pancakes. Nothing special here either. The accompaniments were good, but I would rather spend the calories at Jean-Philippe next door at the Aria. Tea was very good (about $6.50). Total for the meal was a bit high, just under $45 for the two breakfast items and the tea. One comment: could the female server be dressed in a bit more modest uniform. It just seemed more light nightclub hostess attire and was not appropriate for a breakfast place. The service was quite good.",QNSL8oCbpiukOFIiX4cwmQ,1,0,3,fyq5CX1fpkuVPSk3N7LPyw
1165236,2010-10-30,0,LH-DYCy9v3kM4JRtpcquxw,"Somewhat disappointed with the food at Silk Road. I ordered the lunch special (4 separate plates) which I thought might represent the Silk Road concept. What I was served was rather uninspired: bagel club sandwich, field greens w/ a bit beet, chicken ""curry"" heavy with lemongrass, and a batter-dipped divers scallop served w/hand cut fries. Making matters worse: the scallop was ammoniated and leached liquid onto the bed of fries.  The staff was apologetic and offered an alternate dish: calamari w/chili jam. The reason I am posting 3 stars instead of 2 is due to the calamari plate; it was FRESH, nicely plated and the chili jam complemented the sweetness of the seafood.",CEQsj9pdpmCZ8xY81o60xQ,0,0,3,vQtPnN9qRTEtri4fV9OwIw

the service was actually attentive and decent,  but the food took FOREVER!!!
the 4 of us took 2 hours to eat a simple lunch and the place had 5 tables in it including ours. the menu is small and not very borad for lunch,  i had a beet salad, that was tiny and flavorless, and some mussels in a saffron broth that had no flavor either,  the fries were the best thing of the meal. the others had a tomato soup, and mini burgers (so-so), tuna tartare bites, were really good, but the truffle gnocchi was really bad,  they were too soft and had no body to them at all. and the last had the kobe hangar steak,  over cooked and boring.

I was trying to make sure I didn't feel bloated for the pool so decided not to go with the ricotta and blueberry pancakes that I really wanted. Instead I opted for a bowl of oatmeal. Oatmeal you say? Yes oatmeal and it was great. There was some banana compote and hard sugar streusel that just melted right into the oatmeal. My bf had the cream of wheat with a side of bacon. We also ordered a side of the ham and cheese beignets. Everything was quite tasty, only wish I could have explored the menu a little more.",AlIztJXcT-abBG9YS2cvog,0,0,4,RmkMv4SXxnbuu6NrtI1x7g

The coconut chicken soup was the highlight of the meal: tons of cubed white meat in a fragrant creamy broth with so many layers of flavor.  Impressive.  Not so much: the sliders and the pork potstickers, which were both COLD.  

I would give this place another go.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,1,1,2,x9ibvqFheSFZnenMaaXOew

I started with the crispy French toast, accompanied with an amazing compote topping and a flavorful glaze with citrus zest (instead of syrup). Bacon was fine. We switched plates and I finished with the blueberry ricotta pancakes that I ordered again upon our return two days later. Hostess was still surly!

2234987,2010-08-16,1,LH-DYCy9v3kM4JRtpcquxw,"This review pertains to their brunch menu.

The Skinny: blueberry ricotta pancakes alone would garner a 4 however the deficits of other menu items leave this one a (3), service - must have been an off day because it was a (2), value - brunch is normally a rip off but this place is not that bad considering the amount of food you receive. However I would avoid any beverages in the place(3).

We made a reservation on a lazy Sunday morning looking to try their brunch. At first we didn't really understand how the brunch menu worked as we didn't see the obligatory chafing dish set up anywhere. Finally, we got a hold of our server who explained that the brunch menu is like a prix fixe menu (served tableside) for $39.

We ordered the brunch prix fixe menu (it also came with an ""eye opener"" drink which included a choice of mimosas, bellinis, etc) and the blueberry ricotta pancakes.

The brunch prix fixe menu had a beautiful presentation and was served almost like a small afternoon tea. It started with a basket of pastries (cheese danish, 2 pain au chocolat), greek yogurt with granola and berries, a mini fruit plate, and a mini bagel with lox.

The pastries were okay - the flavours were correct but lack enough flakiness to make them truly decadent. The bagel with lox lacked smoked salmon and had too much onion and capers. The greek yogurt parfait was good but needed a little more granola to sweeten it.

The second course was the pastrami sliders, mini quiches, a sausage hash and plate of eggs any style with bacon and asparagus. The pastrami sliders were delicious, juicy and the brioche bun was in a perfect ratio to the filling. The mini quiches were a little on the bland side with an mediocre crust. The sausage hash was okay but nothing special. The eggs lacked seasoning although the accompanying bacon, hash browns and asparagus were well prepared (nice textures and crispness to all of them).

The final course consisted of the apple french toast with compote and the nutella/banana crepes. The crepes themselves were lovely however they could have used more banana inside. The apple french toast had an unusual ?cornflake crust on top which did add to the crispness of the outside. The inside lacked some of the luscious egg custard flavours of a great french toast though. The apple compote was wonderful and the combination of flavours in this dish were nice.

Finally, the order of blueberry ricotta pancakes ($14). These were by far the best thing we had that morning. The fluffiness of the pancake with the light crisp outer shell made these ones hard to beat. Accompanied with some honeycomb butter, whipped cream and an amazing orange blossom syrup, this is the dish to come back for.

Our service overall was rather lacking for a high end restaurant. First of all, our server did not take the time to explain the menu (ie, how the brunch menu worked) and only seemed to be interested in whether we would be ordering any beverages (which are a rip off here - $10 for coffee, $7 for juice... 'nuff said). Secondly, our water glasses remained rather low (actually empty for the most part) for the duration of the meal which is rather unacceptable in a place of this caliber. Third, our server did not place the food in the correct manner according to who ordered them (ie, I had some of my husband's dishes, even though I didn't order them). 

So overall, I would say this place is a 3 star establishment in light of the poor service and some items on the brunch menu. I would highlight that if one were to go, do try the heavenly blueberry ricotta pancakes or their pastrami sliders but don't go for the brunch menu.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,3,3,Kq9ygxADu0-dE5dt6P2h_g
2625255,2010-06-25,0,LH-DYCy9v3kM4JRtpcquxw,"This review is for breakfast. Coffee was great! Illy French press. Most of the ""sweet"" breakfast items were not as sweet as usual, which was nice for a change. The decor is crazy retro-70's. Cute in its gaudiness.

Blueberry-ricotta pancakes: Nice and fluffy yet dense. Not as many blueberries as I'd like. The orange blossom syrup didn't really taste like much. And I know orange blossoms!

Eggs, eggs, eggs: Makes me think of a Lady gaga song. Good! Spinach didn't hve enough flavor. Otherwise quite enjoyable. 

Eggs Benedict: Great! Lots of lemon and not too much Hollandaise.",8dPm8D3MbUY1_6baNb56CA,0,0,4,_yVq668QKmhsRxnnIoafAw

The first thing I heard when I went to the desk to ask to be seated was ""You will have to take off your hat to walk through the restaurant"".  This created an expectation in me that I would be getting comparable food to the snootiness right off the bat.  The hamburgers we purchased for over $20 could be had at a million better places all over Las Vegas for half the cost.  They gave us some hard French bread rolls that almost broke my teeth before the meal.  The service was poor as well.

3168588,2011-04-03,1,LH-DYCy9v3kM4JRtpcquxw,"THE SILK ROAD HAS CLOSED, PERMANENTLY.

This was completely unclear from the little sign out front, that read ""Silk Road is closed, please visit the Market Cafe"".

When we walked by and saw the sign, I figured they were only open for dinner.

Later that night we walked by again, and I thought maybe they're closed on Wednesdays??

The following evening the space was open, being used for a private event.

It wasn't until the third day that I realized the restaurant isn't just closed, it's CLOSED.

This is a bummer, because it now means there is no proper restaurant in Vdara, if you want a meal, you'll have to leave the hotel.

My buddies ordered breakfast, but I ordered the Silk Road burger (black angus beef with fries). Oh so good with your choice of condiments (tomatoes, pickles, onions, lettuce, fried egg, beets, swiss cheese, jack cheese, cheddar, and bacon).

The burger was tasty and the shoestring fries were a definite treat. Everything was certainly fresh and beautifully presented. The service was prompt and the waiter came back repeatedly to ensure everything was okay.

3552336,2010-03-01,0,LH-DYCy9v3kM4JRtpcquxw,"My husband and I stumbled onto this place while we were walking around City Center on the first night of our most recent trip, checking everything out. We're big fans of Sensi, and when we saw that Martin Heierling was the executive chef here, we made it a point to eat here during our stay. 

The next day, we had a wonderful late morning breakfast. In fact I think it was the best breakfast I ever had (and on this trip to Vegas we also had breakfast at Bouchon so that's really saying something). The decor is lovely and modern, and the view wonderful. From our seat, we could see the huge canoe sculpture right out the window, one of City Center's most arresting pieces of outdoor art. 

The service here was fantastic, too. We arrived at the late side of breakfast, and there were only one or two other tables full. But our waitress was excellent, and after we had finished, the manager came and spoke to us for a while about the restaurant, Vdara, and Vegas in general. Business was a bit slow, but not because the food or service was lacking! I hope that things pick up for them; it's a wonderful place and I'd like to go back when we return this summer. 

But on to the food, which was amazing: I had the blueberry and ricotta pancakes with honeycomb butter, candied rose petals, and orange blossom syrup. I know that getting the pancakes doesn't sound very adventurous, but these were no ordinary pancakes. They were THE. BEST. PANCAKES. EVER. They were at once rich and light, the flavors blended perfectly, and the portion size was right on. Not too much, just enough. I also had the Bellini, one of my favorite breakfast drinks. That too was excellent. 

My husband had the free range turkey hash with Turkish eggs, a spiced butter and a Greek yogurt relish. The flavors here were rich and exotic, and it was a beautiful dish. I've had hash before, but never anything like this. 

I wish I could have this breakfast tomorrow, and I will definitely come back here. What we had was so good that I might get the exact same things even though I'm tempted to try out the rest of the great looking menu. We loved every minute of it!",MubgCQYH8-5fb_z1FuVdDg,1,0,5,dC8f9Pb1ZXpbqlf5iDjSjw

The biggest problem we had was that not all the ingredients is listed on the menu.  My friend ordered a turkey panini wrap, and it came with bacon and avocado.  And she doesn't eat pork. And since it was a wrap, she didn't know until she bit into it.

And our waiter didn't do anything to compensate for their mistake, or the fact that it took so long to get it fixed. Which I don't understand why the service was slow and not very helpful at a nice hotel, that wasn't very busy...?",-nMmZZjSujEdO-YGAQoa5w,0,0,2,OBhJxVquPepqR7JW58b6lA
