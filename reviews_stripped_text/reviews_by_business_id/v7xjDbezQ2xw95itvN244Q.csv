First off no hostess to acknowledge you at the door, my friends and I stood there for a good 15 minutes before even getting a hello, Finally we were seated in a corner booth with a huge table blocking our exit.

I came with a group of people on a Friday. We had done some drinking the night before. I ordered a michelada. It was a bit temperature hot so i had to order a cup of ice to put some in. They had salsa and tostadas as starters. The salsa was very good especially if you add lemon. 

For my entree i ordered "" El ceviche de camaron casero"" which is basically ceviche de agua chiles. This was so good and the plate was really big. I shared it with everyone. 

I also had some of my bf's regular shrimp ceviche. This was also really good. 

A person we were with shared one of his shrimp empenada. this was really good and the sauce it came with was really spicy but delicious. 

The service here was also really great. The waitress was really nice and attentive. She kept coming around to ask if we were doing ok. She did a really great job considering our party consisted of about 15 people. 

The decor is very nice too. Its full of really comfortable chairs made in Mexico named EQUIPALES.

1647590,2013-11-20,1,v7xjDbezQ2xw95itvN244Q,"I had been to this place one time before my recent and LAST visit to this place. The first time around everything went smooth, the food was great, the service was great, no complaints. The second time around, it was a completely different experience. Let me start by saying ABSOLUTELY WORST SERVICE EVER. We walked in and the place was busy. When my boyfriend and I walked in we made eye contact with a waitress, who rather than sitting us down went about her business as if we were not there. Rude much? We get seated and we ordered our food. I ordered a small order or ceviche and my boyfriend order two empanadas and a tostada mixta. The ceviche was good, but it was missing avocado. Every other restaurant that I have gone to and ordered ceviche serves avocado with it. So I asked the waitress if I could please have some avocado. A HALF HOUR LATER I get my avocado, a whole avocado, by this time I am practically done with the ceviche!! The empanadas were fairly good, not the best. My boyfriend's tostada, wow I do not even know where to start! To begin with there was ONE shrimp on it placed neatly on the top of a mountain of haiva which is crab imitation. We dig through the pile of haiva only to find two pieces of octopus which did not look appetizing AT ALL. On the bottom of it all is what seems to be a tomato sauce. When I tell my waitress that I did not order a tostada de haiva and that I ordered a tostada mixta she simply told me that she was sorry but that it was not her fault that she did not cook that. She does not even offer to take it up to her supervisor or to return the food, NOTHING! At any other restaurant the least they do is ask if we want the food returned or replaced. Then I look for a waiter and tell him about the issue, and just like the waitress, he does nothing but explain that it is the way they make them there. Absolutely ridiculous, anyone can google a tostada mixta and you will see that nothing looks like a mountain of haiva. WORSTE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!",hkkttAYpZnvujHewnYSsgQ,2,1,1,uXg8RCjTwbJWC47rIzGeTA

1729648,2014-08-10,3,v7xjDbezQ2xw95itvN244Q,"I wish I could give them 0 stars. Worst service I have ever had. I'm so glad I didn't give this dump any of my money. Where to begin:

My girlfriend and I wanted Mexican food so we go on yelp and decide on this place. There are no hours of operation on yelp for this restaurant so I call the phone number to ask when they close. The phone rings 10 times, no one answers, I hang up. I call again about a minute later, the phone rings 4 times and a woman picks up and speaks Spanish. I ask her ""what time do you guys close?"" She speaks Spanish back to me. Now I understand this is a Mexican restaurant but the woman answering the phone should be bi-lingual and be able to speak English. BUT, my girlfriend speaks Spanish so I hand the phone to her and she asks in Spanish what time do they close. The woman apparently couldn't hear my girlfriend (over the blaring music in the restaurant) so my girlfriend asks 3 more times...every time the waitress didn't understand her so the waitress hangs up. My girlfriend calls back and asks again and finally the waitress understands.

We head to the restaurant and the music is blaring we can hear it outside. Now I have been to Mexican restaurants before with live-bands and I enjoy it very much but this was a bit ridiculous. They had not only a live band playing but they had three huge loud speakers that the live music was blaring out of. I am not one to exaggerate and when I say I couldn't hear myself talk, I literally mean I could not hear myself talk. I couldn't understand my girlfriend and she was two feet away from me. We walk up to the front counter and there is a girl behind the counter typing away at the computer. Doesn't acknowledge us, doesn't look up, doesn't say hi. Just keeps typing away at the computer. We wait there for about 45 seconds and another waitress walks up to us and points to a table in the back.

She doesn't walk us to the table just stays behind the counter and points to the table. We walk through the restaurant to the back and notice that every single empty table is messy (food scraps, plates, glasses) no empty table is clean. We get to the table she pointed out for us and sure enough it has food scraps and chip crumbs on it. We sit down and I take a napkin and wipe away the food crumbs. The waitress comes over to us, does not say hello. Just hands us two menus, cleans up the food crumbs and walks away. Didn't smile, no hello how are you. She didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink. Just walked away. My girlfriend and I sat there for about two more minutes and decided we were going to get the hell out of there and we did. We got up and walked out.

I'm Mexican and know how to cook and how cocktail taste like.  how can they not know what to add on the food while cooking it. hey some garlic or onion or perhaps salt. No flavor to it all. Also all food that is deep fried looks brown as hell like they don't change their oil.

1925934,2016-03-20,0,v7xjDbezQ2xw95itvN244Q,"Went based on a recommendation my husband and I got saying that it was good. Out usual spot is Las Isletas, but we were down to try something closer to our place. The food was decent and we both tried something different than what we are used to with our other usual spot. Hubby got the SEAFOOD TOSTADA and the SEAFOOD ENCHILADA while I got the PINA MIXTA. Overall, the food was decent and the TOSTADA was pretty tasty with the various seafood (ceviche, octopus, and imitation crab) all on one tostada. What I ordered was pretty decent. I felt overwhelmed with more pineapples than the SEAFOOD as they delivered it in a half carved out pineapple. The grilled spears was a nice touch and the rest of the pineapple were mixed in with the nice sweet and savoury sauce alongside some shrimp and mini crab legs. The ENCHILADA wasn't my thing as the texture of the shrimp (kind of like ground up shrimp) was off putting. I would much rather have it not too finely chopped, but just some decent chunks of the shrimp. In addition, I'm used to the wet enchilada and it looked and tasted like it was pretty dried up not having too much sauce. Hey, I'll admit I'm used to the non traditional Mexican foods while my Mexican hubby was quick to coach me that this is how it really should be. Anyhoo, we went on a weekday an hour before 12 and of course, we didn't anticipate that it would be busy. Was disappointed that the service was lacking despite that. We were only tended to when the food came in and when I desperately needed some refill on my drink after a spicy taste of something, I was dismayed to see the girls just chatting for a good while. I swear there was a water cooler nearby with the length of their convo and I might as well have fetched my own drink. 

Will I go back? Maybe with a twist of my arm I will, just to not drive too far to my other spot across town. I'm down to give them one more shot and make sure to have them deliver 2 drinks at a time and hopefully amend this review with another star.",EDomjStHED1E59zv3haruA,0,0,3,vjlvZOtkSkEGUMjqgOX4cA

The ONLY reason their rating was not a 5 star is because in the middle of our experience the mariachi got going playing table to table, and then you had a banda literally in the middle of the restaurant (which is not that big) going full blast playing their seperate music. To top it ALL off the restaurant still had their pandora playing over their speakers.  Yeah got a little hectic. Don't know if this is the new norm but personally it was too much for me.

My friend and I were actually waiting at Las Islitas, but because it was a fight weekend AND Mexican Independance Day we couldn't hold our appetite any longer.  Someone had mentioned El Diamante to us so we figured we would try this place out.  We called to see if they were busy, which they said they were but said they would set up a table for two.  This place was not as busy as Las Islitas, but that was good for us.  They have mariachi bands as well.  Now if you are not used to mariachi bands playing while you eat, you might want to bring earplugs.  Not saying that they are bad, but it is REALLY loud.  Not a place to have intimate conversations, this setting is to eat and drink and enjoy the mariachi band(s).  

Food wise, we had the appetizer oyster topped with ceviche, omg that was so tasty.  Their seafood dishes, you cannot go wrong.  I actually had a beef dish to mix it up a little as my main dish, but I can't recall what exactly it was called.  Its a really long name that started with a Z...haha I hope that helps but that was yum.  They serve it with 4 tortillas.  2 with Cheese the other with beans.  It was delicious and spicy and I emphasize SPICY.  I highly recommend.  

My friend spoke fluent in Spanish and that did help a lot.  Makes the conversation with the staff easier.  

Their food is yummy and I will definitely return for more.  I just would feel comfortable bringing a Spanish speaking person with me, LOL",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,1,0,3,2dk7YewfNOwC2DNtynOtKA

They usually have a live band playing every time I come here.  Their guacamole is different from others because they add cotija cheese.  

The only complaint I have about this place is their horrible service.  They take forever to get your order and they never follow up with how the food is.  You're basically on your own from once you order until you ask them for the check.",eo775Ge7MXWqqHpOBDI5IQ,2,1,3,FaRQmlCLZ3LeFAq0YMIEjg

The portions are really big but this is some of the most expensive Mexican food I've ever had. Instead of typical tortilla chips served with salsa they give you big tortilla rounds like for tostadas. I didn't like the beans at all but the rest of the food was amazing. Most of the menu is in Spanish but there are brief translations after some of the items. We received great service and I don't have any complaints except the prices were insane. I'm pretty sure nothing was under $10 and I could find Mexican food anywhere else for a better price. I'm not from Vegas so I don't know that for 100% but everywhere else I've ever traveled I could find better prices.",P6bXFw793Yz2jY3ILF0cDw,0,1,3,z3WswRuHvwVJe6qqnu-X9A

El Diamante has been at this location since I was kid. Before el Diamante it was a McDonald's, I was 9 when it changed. It's located on Charleston and boulder for god sakes. I'd rather see a local business before a corporation. If you're looking for an elevated experience. Kick rocks and head to the strip. This place isn't for the faint of heart. If you hipsters are looking for service, gtfoh. This is a family owned restaurant that has been a staple in this neighborhood. I'm Filipino and I've always have waiters that speak little to no English. I stepped into their world for an experience and they have never let me down. El Diamante keep up it up!! Every time I'm in your neighborhood I pick up a dozen of Camaron empanadas and some aguachilles to go! If you appreciate any sort of live music for the beauty of it, they have live banda on the weekends. Also check out their second location on eastern and trop. Just recently opened the last few years.",4AgyuR7BuL20OxFH_4Q_Og,0,0,5,5wBjIEouo1VVyjizWTBpZg

5599600,2013-04-30,0,v7xjDbezQ2xw95itvN244Q,"This joint is close to work HQ and surprised I didn't come here sooner.  It's a great authentic Mexican restaurant known for their mariscos.  Still, I find it awkward to elaborate about places that are from different cultures.  I find it hard to refrain from rolling my eyes and SMH when heads provide their rendition of their review of other cultures without knowing the real deal, so if I become a hypocrite in this review, feel free to call me out on it...lol.
  
After a long trek through the Broad Acres Swap Meet in North Las Vegas, we figured we may as well keep it real and conclude the adventure with some good Mexican grub.  Our menu consisted of white fish ceviche de oescado, carne zarandeade, pulpitos a la mantequilla, botana mixta, cerveza preparada and horchata, all of which made me excited and added to the suspense.  

I was told that there is a live mariachi band, but none in sight when we arrived.  It can get pretty sporty and didn't know how I felt about not hearing myself chew today, so okay with the blasting Mexican music.  But I spoke too soon, in came the band and jammed at a table till we departed.  Soon afterward a dude came by suited and booted selling chocolate bars followed by a guy slangin rosaries.

The place is pretty authentic in my book.  Sometimes I feel that the great finds not always have the highest Yelp review, but less in this case and is a diamond in the rough.  The michiladas were on point and splashed with fish juice even, now if that ain't authentic, I dint know what is.  

I have to give the overall experience a 4 since its just what the doctor ordered...a great day at the Mexican swap meet followed by some good Mexican food.  I hope that my follow up visits will be just as entertaining.  Next time, I plan to have the pescado zarandeade and will provide you all with the scoops on that.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,0,1,4,PnmGp_vyhiFUNVNIr8Cevw

Took about 10 minutes to get acknowledged by the waitress, then about another 10 minutes to get the drinks. Finally she took our order and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time. 

We ordered the shrimp cocktail & the aguachiles. The aguachiles was good, however this place is pretty expensive. I'm not sure what the market prices are for shrimp, but this place is no bargain. 

I will say their preparadas (beer with a combination of some shrimp juice) were 5 stars. Really tasty. 

Perhaps I'll return, but if I don't it won't be the end of the world.",uY9Q_Vw7YAJtJQA0FQJR7g,3,0,2,jYNWhIHR_Mio01fANsiASw

It was my first time coming in here and I must say that I loved the atmosphere. The decorations and the vibrant colors this place has to offer are just energetic. The music is just about right noise wise; we were all able to talk without having to yell at each other. & most importantly, the place was full. By the time we left there was a line forming.
