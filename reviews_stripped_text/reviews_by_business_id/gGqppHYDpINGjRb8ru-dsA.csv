Gregg's advice, however, is spot on.  Pay the extra for the VIP package! You will receive a fresh flower lei, muuuuch better seating,  and priority at the buffet.  Yes, it is a hot venue, but then so is all of Las Vegas in the summer!  (This show only runs during the summer months.)  No, the food wasn't outstanding.  It was, however, on par with anything we've eaten at large-venue-schmaltzy luaus in Hawaii.  If you're in Vegas and craving a dose of Artificial Polynesia, I say go for it.  It's a fun evening under the stars that you're bound to enjoy.",Tug1jjmms1F0z7pEeDdu7g,3,1,4,8-nY10OweFZHcrBxv46q_w

Ugh. It's all over. The Luau Buffet is no longer held poolside with fire dancers and other entertainment. Now the Luau Buffet is a very sorry standard buffet at heightened prices. There are free ""mai tai"" drinks provided, but even those can't put back the party atmosphere I experienced at the poolside Luau two years ago. If anyone suggests it, you're better off finding something less expensive (it was $25/per on a Saturday) as putting a sweet sauce on chicken breasts does not a luau make. Sorry, Imperial Palace, we know the economy is bad, but this was once of the worst cuts we've seen over the past year.

Not the best buffet I've ever been to, but the combination of the food and the show made for a wonderful evening. The Luau Buffet and Show only runs through the summer months, so if you're thinking about going, be sure to make plans early. Also, spend the extra $$ and get the VIP package - special give-aways, better table service, better view. Don't plan to get too loose on the ""free-flowing"" mai-tais and pina coladas advertised as endless. We needed to drink quite a few before we finally found one with some alcohol. But, fun none the less. Reminiscent of what I envision as a ""typical"" Las Vegas dinner show from bygone days.",PpSuSHh-_sN-9VPYyQMWAA,2,0,1,s37ToxEUjDRnsKbcvvUssw

re: ""Pay the extra for the VIP package!""
I see...  so you're saying that I should have paid MORE money and that would have made all the difference in the world in the show?  You're saying it would have made the food taste a little less like cardboard, the drinks stiffer and kept them from being served in dixie cups, brought in a breeze into the ridiculously hot venue, provided comfortable non-fold out plastic chair seats, and transported the performance to a classier hotel that wasn't considered the eyesore of Las Vegas?

OH HELL NO.

Who are you kidding?  With no wind & unrelenting heat, the venue is like walking into the Amazon.  And outside of the performers, this is nothing like a decent luau.  The booze is watered down.  The mac salad is atrocious.  The meats taste dry and unholy, like they were left out all day.  Oh sure - if you want to compare it to those bullsh-t fresh-off-the-ATA plane luaus they package 'complimentary' with your stay at the  Hilton Hawaiian along with the free t-shirt at Hilo Hatties, alright... I guess it was ""on par"".  Uh... way to set those standards as low as frickin' possible, by the way.

BOTTOM LINE:  
This remains, out of the 80 some odd reviews I've done of Las Vegas, possibly the absolute worst shows/meals in the city.  I'd even go to [gulp] the dreaded ""Tony & Tina's Wedding"" for dinner & a show before I went back to this Sin City nightmare.

THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH $50 OTHER THAN ATTEND THE IMPERIAL HAWAIIAN LUAU:
1) Bobby Slayton:  Cheap tix at the Trop for a journeyman comic that's got a faster wit than most pros on the circuit at Caesar's..
2) Anthony Cools: The best hypnotist act in Vegas. Admittedly, filthy as all hell but if you're not a prude, neither is he.  Party on at the Paris.
3) Defending the Caveman:  A fantastic 'date' show featuring Kevin Burke.  An off broadway hit that's gone on for over a decade.
4) Disney's The Lion King: Mandalay Bay actually has $50 tickets for this show.  There's really no bad seats.
5) Excalibur's Tournament of Kings:  The food's actually pretty good and for all the cheesy clashes at least the arena is very well air conditioned.",hU46otnbSfdU5oI0zhJGoA,17,10,1,2IYJVZlRiaKrN_N7ZvfgPw
4025774,2010-02-13,2,gGqppHYDpINGjRb8ru-dsA,I want to start off by saying I didn't attend the Luau. I stayed at the IP during a very big convention and couldn't find rooms anywhere else.  I had the privilege of seeing people get ripped off from my rooms balcony.  The show was the same thing you can see at the Hawaiian Market place across the street from the City Center for FREE. For the money that those idiots paid they could have eaten at the best buffet or restaurant.,LO5JP962voPjoB6Wp-zXbg,6,0,1,Cys51858WT-CDUonlSYfFw
