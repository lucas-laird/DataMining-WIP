The Food? Absolutely terrible. My husband had the fish tacos which looked and tasted as if they were made with chopped up frozen fish sticks. Not freshly fried fish fillets as the menu described. I had a chicken chimichanga that was just as horrid. It was a chopped up flavorless grilled chicken breast inside a tortilla that appeared to be fried in oil that was no hotter than 100 degrees. It was super greasy, had absolutely no heat and was one of the most unpalatable things I have ever tried to eat. We had also shared a tamale that was just as bad. Their signs throughout Sam's showed a flame coming up from the plate which I assumed was meant to represent their foods spiciness . It definitely was not spicy nor were the plates very hot temperature- wise either. You would think that when the waiter came back and saw that hardly any of our food had been touched he would have asked if there was something wrong with the food. Not this imbecile, he was more interested in hearing himself talk. He was sarcastic and seemed to find himself extremely amusing. He was not.  Don't quit your day job dude.  It took so long that my sister went up to the cashier to see if she would take our ticket and was told that our server had to take it. Great. He goes to the table next to where we were seated while I'm holding the payment folder in my hand looking right at him, he caught my eye and then just walked off. It took twenty minutes from the time we received our bill until the time I left (everyone else got so impatient and the four year old was tired so I said I would take care of it). I assure you this is NOT and exaggeration. I was so angry I was about ready to walk out. I would never ever go back there again.

321484,2010-08-10,0,kfo1hXvNtGGThfrZGaWtVw,"We checked out this place because we heard about their bottomless margaritas, and my wife was in the mood to get her margarita on.  We were very optimistic, but were ultimately disappointed in our visit.

Drinks:  The margaritas were fine, but the refills on them were VERY slow to come.  This was a Sunday night, and not very busy, so I was disappointed at this.  


Food:  We ordered a queso fundido for an appetizer. It was fine, but not as ""dip-py"" as I was expecting -- I was hoping for more of a cheese dip, not just melted cheese, which quickly congealed, and was hard to get on the chips after five minutes.  I ordered fajitas, and they were pretty tasty, standard, no complaints.  My wife ordered a chimichanga, one of her Mexican favorites, and was very disappointed to find it not at all crunchy/crispy, but more soggy.  Very disappointing.

Overall Service: Aside from the margarita slow down, the rest of the service was also very slow -- timing of courses lagged, and for a slow night, the food came out very slow.  Most Mexican places we've been to are MUCH faster.  The water lady was VERY prompt, and came by many times, and that was great.  My wife drinks VERY fast, and we rarely had an empty water glass. It's too bad that lady wasn't in charge of refilling margaritas.

We would give the food 2.5 stars, and the service 2 stars.  The price isn't that great for a Mexican place off-strip in Vegas, and there are a lot more authentic places with reasonable prices and better service.",o0EB72yhhmmWWytZsyKnUg,0,0,2,tnmvvoo7kE_vAkqAlVsQsQ

532824,2012-01-30,0,kfo1hXvNtGGThfrZGaWtVw,"I am surprised at the range of reviews of this place. It seems like everyone either loves it or hates it. Well, I am taking the middle of the road on Willy & Jose's. It is OK. Sometimes worse or better than others. They have moved locations inside Sam's Town, and neither of them are that impressive. The new location is cute and does have an outside patio which is in Sam's Town giant covered courtyard. This way you can sit outside even in the rain.

The food is pretty good. It is also very large. If you like large portions this is a good place to eat, but you can easily share if you want. The chips and salsa are pretty good and plentiful. It is possible to fill yourself up on the chips, so be careful. I have had many of the dishes here and they're pretty good. But, if you are expecting authentic Mexican, go elsewhere. The tacos, burritos and re-fried beans are good enough, but the Spanish Rice seems to always miss it. It looks the part, but never has any real spice to it.

The service is hit or miss. I have been there when the server is around whenever you need them and when you can never find one. Don't look for great service here. I think you will be disappointed. I have also never gotten a worth wild margarita at Willy & Jose's. I know they have a bottomless margarita, if you ever get asked if you want another, but seriously, why bother. They really aren't worth the price of one.

The last issue I have is the price of all items. The prices are a l bit high for just ok food. Bring up the quality to match the price.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,1,0,3,oBahjkBGvaQkKjv98xg2hg

618740,2013-06-05,0,kfo1hXvNtGGThfrZGaWtVw,"Back in the day (20ish years ago) Willy & Jose's was my absolute favorite for Mexican food!  We would drive across town to go.  This is not the same Willy & Jose's (although it was ok).

Went for dinner with family in town because they are staying at Sam's Town.  The location is different, being off the atrium (which did not exist ""back in the day"").  The ambiance is not the same.  It's pretty diner-ish now, other than the pseudo-outdoor patio to the atrium which makes ""outdoor"" dining possible in 107 degree weather.  We opted for the inside though so not to compete with the noise of the waterfall which is right next to the patio.

The food was so-so.  I'd say on the average side of average.  I see other people here complaining about the chips and salsa.  I thought the chips were fine.  The salsa was hot enough, although it was a little runny for my taste.  I didn't have many.  I'm not a big bean dip eater, although they looked pretty good and my guy seemed to like them just fine.

None of us did cocktails and after reading reviews I'm glad.  I don't care for syrupy margaritas and that's what I would have chosen.

The service was very good.  I'd actually rate service 5 stars.  The bus boy was super attentive: drinks refilled before becoming empty (love that), plates cleared promptly and not intrusive at all.  Funny thing is, after we leave and part with the family we had met up with, my guy tells me the server was his ex-gf from 10 years ago or so, which was probably awkward for her!  He was sure she recognized him.  She was very professional.

All in all, this is not the same Willy & Jose's.  I won't be going out of my way to eat there again and I'd probably pick a different restaurant if we're in the vicinity (and not because of the ex, lol).",bjsZPthav8K7sRKGqvX6ug,0,0,3,cInyy0tT7pVZfgfB1VLrDw

The chips were stale, the salsa bland and bean dip tasted canned. For an appetizer we had the potato skins.

The coolest feature is ""outdoor"" seating area.  This is a great spot to dine at.  The sounds of the waterfall along with the lush greenery makes for a pretty cool setting.

The service was just fine.  From a friendly exchange with the dude that asked for our drink order to the polite waitress who took our order.  My only grip was there was no follow up after the food arrived.  I could have done with either some more salsa or a bottle of hot sauce.

The drinks, a strawberry margarita for the GF and some fruity cocktail for me were a tad sweet.  The taste was consistent to that of which tourists get on the strip.  You know, the kind where you then wear a ridiculous obnoxiously long plastic container around your neck.

The food, starting with the chips and salsa which is also served with a side of beans was not very tasty.  The salsa and chips ramekins are to small for the chips.  It was like the whole square peg in a round hole type situation.

I guess I still can't wrap my head around all the fake b.s. that makes up this weird town. Yeah, no outdoors to be had. So I walk in and head for the bar.

Margaritas - boring and watered down. Nothing exciting and really I can't believe that a casino would make something so ridiculously weak. They were fairly cheap though so that was ok.

Chips and Salsa - Boring again. The bean dip and salsa had no flavor. The chips were kinda stale. I kept wishing there was flavor. None to be had.

Fajitas - Seriously, even Casa Bonita does a better job. God were they ho hum. I mean at least TRY to put a little flavor in there. 

Service - The guy was nice enough but it seemed like he was tired and burned out. He was trying to be nice but you can tell he's been in Las Vegas too long.

Atmosphere - It would have been ok but then some horrible music started up. Apparently, yet another cheesy, mouth breather ""light show."" The blaring sound of ""Cotton Eyed Joe"" had me practically running out the door. 

No, I won't be back. This is the first time I've been in Sam's Town and see NO REASON AT ALL to ever make it a second time. Place was just sad.

Here is what I did like......

The available seating in the courtyard of Sam's Town is pretty cool- it felt like I was on vacation. Within minutes, chips and a mild salsa were brought to our table. I enjoyed the salsa, but didn't care much for the bean dip that came along with it. Ok-that's all the positive things I can say about this place.

For dinner, I selected the green burrito. The menu described it as chile verde (slow roasted pork) with beans inside of a large flour tortilla topped with melted cheese and green sauce. Here is the problem, the chile verde was lacking any flavor at all. Most versions of this dish have onions, peppers, and spices infused throughout. All I could taste here was meat, cheese, and a soggy tortilla. Perhaps the soaking wet lettuce and over ripe tomatoes that accompanied my dish had something to do with this watered down entree. I am so sick of Mexican restaurants trying to pass this off as some delicious salad. All this does is create a puddle in the middle of my plate and turn the cheese into a curdled mess. The rice and beans were atrocious. The rice tasted like that boxed crap from rice a roni, and the beans were boring and chalky.

The service at this restaurant was OK. Three different people brought things out, so I couldn't really tell who our server was. I did ask one of the employees if they made their own tortillas and her response was "" I don't know"". Hah? 

Our bill came out to a little more than $ 30.00 for two entrees and two sodas. Overpriced for mediocre food! I'd rather have my dog pass gas in my face than eat at this place again.....",fOut10lknIp64tm3z6UTNg,3,0,2,jYWIGx6D6qumaI0QcjczUw

This second visit 6 tears later confirms it. What an awful place.
They served us the usual tortilla chips, salsa and bean dip.  The chips were old and hard. Bean dip .... Nothing to crow about. Salsa tasted canned.  The wife ordered a strawberry margarita. More strawberry syrup and not enough booze. $ 8.00 for a $ 2.00 drink.
Wife ordered chicken enchiladas with mole. She enjoyed it.
I ordered a 3 item combo. Pork tamale tasted fine but it was covered with a poor canned tasting enchilada sauce; the chili relleno was filled with cheese reminiscent of Velveeta or Cheese Whiz..the relleno was a little bit over fried.. And the flauta was not crispy at all. Soft like a enchilada. 
Service was okay but it could not makeup for the dismal food. 
I'm definitely not a fan. Won""t go back. Roberto's greasy Mexican food is heads above the garbage served at Willy & Jose's.",WJiU8e_OHwDnBRE_FCSymw,0,0,1,tErgeE1d2kOlAvVK_G09WA

Two of us ordered a trio of proteins--shrimp, chicken, and beef.  My friend doesn't eat shrimp, so it was put in a bowl on the side with extra sauce and I had double shrimp.  Her husband had beef tacos, and my wife had a chicken dish--the name escapes me.

We all enjoyed our entrees.  Very tasty sauces, good portions without being huge, and just the right amount of seasonings.

For dessert, each couple shared an order of chocolate tacos.  The taco shell was a bit rubbery and was filled with vanilla ice cream.  We made the mistake of not picking it up and eating it like an ice cream sandwich when it was cold and still somewhat frozen.  We were given small spoons when we needed a knife to slice through the bottom of the taco.  Still, it was tasty if a bit challenging to eat.

The Spanish rice and refried beans were also okay. There was a pile of shredded lettuce with chopped tomato on the plate.

It seems that their location change to where the old cafe used to be has affected it.  That is not to say that the food was bad.  The chips, salsa and bean dip were all pretty good.  I ordered two item combo with a chicken tamale and beef flauta.  The tamale, while tasting good, was small with little meat and a thin layer of masa.  The flauta was filled with delicious beef and was quite good.  It was odd to me that it came out covered in enchilada sauce.  I am used to getting a flauta dry with a scoop of sour cream and guacamole on the side.  The rice and beans on the plate were both OK though not my favorite version.  The rice was more spiced and more heavily seasoned than I like.  And I typically prefer black beans to refried most anywhere I go.  As for the rest of the parties meals, my grandma did not care for her chile relleno stating that is was ""different.""  This is not in any way a mark against Willy and Jose's.  My grandma is just very particular in what she likes and if it is not what she gets at home it is not good.  My dad, on the other hand, said the relleno was good but perhaps on the spicy side for the more sensitive eater.  I would not know.  I don't eat rellenos.  I did, however, take home the left overs from my aunt's meals.  The chicken quesadilla was loaded and quite filling.  The steak boracho from my other aunt was tough and lacked significant seasoning though I could smell the whiskey it was marinated/cooked in.  I just simply could not taste it.  Finally, the margaritas ordered by my aunts were sent back for not having enough tequila.  They consider themselves margarita connoisseurs and should know a bad drink from a good.  The waitress seemed to agree that the bar tender had not used enough tequila and was happy to add a bit for them.

They have $1.00 off all cocktails at the bar in addition to various daily specials where you can potentially get a cocktail and a meal for less than $10.

The food here is okay, but nothing special.  I ordered a 2 item combination (which was a happy hour special) with a chicken taco and a beef chimichanga.  I liked both, but I didn't like the rice that came with my plate.  It was terrible, and by far the worst thing about my meal.  I liked the beans, and also that they had served us complimentary beans with our chips prior to my entr√©e.

FOOD- was horrible. The chips were ok. Salsa was ok, beans were bland.  I ordered a combo plate, a pork tamale, and a chille rellano. The pork tamale had next to no meat.. I scraped most of it out and it was one bite. The chile rellano was slimy and salty. The beans and rice were bland.  I didn't eat much of it. 

My fiance ordered a shrimp burrito. It was not as described to us when we asked and it smelled. Like rotten fish. Not only that but it was full of ""scallops"". Which turned out to be bat ray wing, not even real scallops, those were chewy. He sent the whole thing back because of the smell and the tortilla was soggy/mushy it had the consistency of mashed potatoes.  15 bucks for THAT? C'mon now. 

Our friends had a burrito and combo plate, they were not impressed either. 

SERVICE- We had to wait 20 minutes for a table when over half the restaurant was empty. We ended up with a crappy table.  

 The bus boy should have been our waiter. He was pleasant and came back promptly and frequently to ask if we needed anything and to refill our drinks.  Our waitress wasn't awful, but she was short, and acted like we were a huge inconvenience the second she walked up.  She did however look worn out and made an attempt to be pleasant about the burrito we sent back. It took a while to have our order taken, which would have been fine had they been even slightly busy. 

I tried to get a group of employees attention to take the check, I held it up and they just looked at me and went back to talking. 

Our friends and I were leaving when my fiance was stopped by the manager and asked how everything was. He told her he felt it was over priced for the quality, and some issues with the food. Like his mushy, smelly, burrito,  and my tamale having no meat. She got snotty and said ""you're wrong , I watched them make the tamales"". She then said ""well if you had a problem you should have said something before"" ( um hello, genius, we sent food back and told our waitress!)  This is what angered us the most. Don't ask people what they thought and be rude if you don't like the answer! Very unprofessional. We still paid our full bill so it's not like we don't have a right to complain when asked.

BAR: I live really close to this casino maybe 7-10 minutes. the 1st time I came here the bar was kind of hidden behind the Roxy. But we really enjoyed it. Especially the gentleman bartender I want to say his name is Robert or Raul. Well since the renovation we came bk and sat at the bar which opens out to an awesome view of the mystic falls scenery and different colored christmas lights. 

My last visit here was not too long ago, shortly after my bday inwhich my bf gave me a VERY EXPENSIVE NEW PURSE. We'd seen it while shopping almost a year ago and he remembered and went bk to get it. Sweet right? well I put my very new expensive purse in the empty chair nxt to me. . Ladies understand this. . 

the guy kept grabbing my purse and the chair closer to him. so i pulled it back since this made me very VERY nervous. Then he yells at me saying how do you know someone's not sitting there? I said b/c there's nobody sitting there and no food there. so he slides a drink in front of it. after taking a huge sip? wth? really? I ignored him, an hr later and to make a long story short he gets the manager and she sides w/ him and instead of being mad at the fact that he grabbed my purse out of my hands and threw it across the bar - she gets a chair to put my purse nxt to the chair it was already in. 

Luckily the guy and his imaginary friend finished cussing me out and left. I will never go bk. The bartender the male and female were both nice to me but neithe rof them stuck for me to tell the manager that no, there was never anybody sitting there and this guy was being a jerk to a local patron. 

The custoemr that sat there after him was so nice and bought my bf and I a round of drinks, so nice. he was visiting from CA and was great.  Sad how you can have both ends of the spectrum within minutes. I cant blame the bar/cantina for the behaviour of this guy but I can blame them for the handling of the situation. Looking back I should have just left when he started harrassing me but hindsight is 20/20.

We did our research & read the reviews of several restaurants in our price range before our trip to Vegas. We were staying at Sam's Town for 5 nights.  Were not impressed by their restaurants & did not want to eat there.  On the third day after some really bad meals, high priced drinks & awful service, we were tired after a very busy day & decided to try Willy & Jose's rather than drive to another restaurant. We were not expecting a good meal.  At first when we looked at the menu we thought the prices were a little high, but then we thought about what we spent at a good Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix & was not that high.  They first brought out warm chips, salsa & bean dip. The salsa tasted homemade & was impressed with the warm bean dip & warm chips. Our waiter was great & made sure our water & ice tea was never empty.  My husband ordered fish tacos & I ordered the pork & guacamole  burrito.  We could not believe how huge they were when they arrived, but being cautious thought big does not mean better tasting.  OMG, they were delicious.  The pork was so tender & had a great flavor also liked the rice & beans. The lettuce & tomato was fresh & crisp.  I felt so bad because I was not very hungry & could only eat half the burrito.  It was so good that I kept thinking about it the next day.  We liked the food so much that we went back again the night before leaving.  I did not eat all day so that I could eat a great tasting meal.  I ordered the pork & guac burrito again because I knew it was so good.  My husband ordered the seafood enchilada & was so impressed.  It was filled with large shrimp & scallops, not cocktail shrimp like other restaurants.  I ordered a large beer.  Most of the places we went to in Vegas, a large was equal to a bottle of beer.  I could not believe how huge it was. I think I worked out my arms by just trying to lift it.  I hope that I can figure out how to post the pics here.  Our Server Crystal was amazing.  She went above & beyond the norm for service.  She asked if we would like to try a spicier salsa & brought us a green sauce & a red hotter sauce for our chips. We told her that we could not take our left over food because we could not refrigerate it in room, but asked if we could take some of our leftover chips & salsa for later.  Crystal actually brought us fresh chips & our favorite salsa to take to room.  She also realized that I could not finish the beer that I was drinking without sitting in restaurant for a long time & poured the remaining beer into a glass that I could take onto casino floor & to our room.

5513391,2013-02-11,3,kfo1hXvNtGGThfrZGaWtVw,"Last night (Feb. 11th, 2013) I went out to dinner with my folks.  We agreed on getting Mexican food.  But, we settled for Willy & Jose's.  As I have stated in a previous review, I allow myself one night per week to eat out.  So, my folks wanted to hitchhike on my night.  I like my folks so that was no problem... well small problem, they eat a lot earlier than I would like.  But, whatever...

We get to Sam's Town around 5 pm, park, and take a small escalator ride to Willy & Jose's.  As we walked up, I noticed that the outside seating was full.  Crazy!!!  Anyhow, we check in and were immediately seated, inside.  Our seats were near the Kitchen, so there was a lot of foot traffic around us.

Our drink orders were taken immediately.  Our complimentary chips, salsa, and beans showed up on the table.  After eating a couple of chips I was done.  They were too stale for me.  So, I refrained.  As we looked at our menu, I had to help my Aunt figure out how to order Chicken and Rice.  That's all she likes when we go out.

* Side note:  Over the past few years I tried to get my Aunt to try new things - new places.  But, no matter where we went, Mexican, Japanese, Thai etc... she found a way to just order Chicken and Rice.  I gave up and just accepted it.

Back to my review...

So, our waiter, Ramero (sp?), was great.  He is the reason I give 3 stars.  He was friendly and witty, as well as efficient.  He made sure our drinks were always full and checked in on us from time to time, to make sure we were alright.

We order and within 15 minutes or so, our meals came out.  My aunt's chicken and rice was covered with cheese, green sauce and peppers.  She forgot to ask for her meal without all of the mess.  So, for the next couple of minutes, she scraped all of it off and put it on a smaller plate.  The chicken was too spicy for her but she survived.  My folks both ordered the Fajita special... which came out sizzling... so that's a plus.  They raved over it.  Maybe that should have been the move I needed to make.  But, I'm not a big fan of onions and peppers.  So, I would have felt foolish ordering it that way.  So, I decided to get the shredded beef burrito.  Again, it came out covered with cheese and green sauce.  All of our meals came with the same sides. - Beans w/ cheese, rice, lettuce w/ sour cream and tomatoes.  Bland is the word that describes the sides.  The burrito I had was so-so, but edible.

We were finished with dinner in about 15 - 20 minutes.  I am one that always wants to take part of my meal home, so I can eat it later.  I have always been like that... so don't judge!!!  

*On another side note: It was nice that they had the bathrooms in the restaurant.  So, I didn't have to walk into the casino to find one.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,1,1,3,u1ICjVhMruiM8bBQ7BVfSA

However, ever since they moved into their current location (what used to be an Italian place originally), everything has gone downhill. I remember coming to visit year after year and having the same bartender, the same host and the same servers. Of course, all of them are long gone now - what a shame. 

The last 3 times I have visited, the hostess has been extremely rude or non existent. Tonight, we stood there for 10 minutes and kept being told ""be right back"". Finally, someone comes and tells us that their wait list has disappeared. Before I could even ask how long the wait was, she ran off. In between all this, she slammed into us with a stack of menus and just said ""be right back"". Eventually they locate their very modern piece of paper with names scribbled on and without even saying a time, ask for my name and start to write it down. After they finish, they say about 30 minutes. Where was that 15 minutes ago when we started? Oh, that rude hostess? She was wearing a shirt that indicated she works at the buffet. Either they are short handed or she was ""too busy"" to change. I'll go with the latter, since I've seen her there before. 

On the times where the rude staff weren't enough to conquer my hunger, the food is average at best. The value is decent, however avoid the bar. The drinks are extremely overpriced for the quality you get. Servers don't listen when you order. A perfect example is ordering a margarita without salt. Of course, he brings it with salt and like any reasonable customer would, I refused it. He walked back to the bar, took another glass and dumped the same margarita in another glass and brings it back to the table with a hefty amount of salt at the bottom.

Her name was Bethany, her attitude for my daughter and I was like we were a burden. We weren't loud, we weren't obnoxious, for some reason as soon as she got to our table her whole attitude changed. She was chipper and friendly with all of her other tables and visited them frequently.

 My food was DISGUSTING (I ordered fish tacos, they were soggy, rice was hard and beans were crusty) but Bethany never came around to ask us how our food was or to ask if we needed anything. My daughter wasted her food because we couldn't get Bethany to bring us some ketchup because she made it a point to keep her distance from our table. We didn't get refills until AFTER we decided we were done with our food and SURPRISE it was the bus boy who asked because he could see the look of frustration on my face.

I do remember  having a good time and enjoying myself and sitting in a nice garden ( even if the birds and animals were all animatronic) The salsa wasnt bad, and the service was good.

The food just does not stand out, there is no popular dish there or anything exotic. Its your typical beans and rice on the side type place.
The atmosphere and waterfalls make it tropical, and jungle-esque.",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,0,0,3,NAvEcxKyswXtttYXgYdkXw

We had a party of 8 for my dads 70th birthday party and I made reservations for 6, my party was late so the hostess informed me that they only hold the table for fifteen minutes... understandable but she was just rude about it. I also brought a birthday cake with me and the actually charge an additional $10 to bring your own, crazy!

The food was alright, I had the beef enchiladas and it was good, the rice and beans were kind if bland. 
Meal was $13
Gratuity for party of 8 %18

The part that makes the whole place worth while is the location, right beside the magical forest and there is balcony seating the is out on the patio. The ambiance is nice.",m7nAGNXl3eqMRE5R4vzu2Q,1,0,3,DUfGqLNiuGe7v2HyMR7Krw
