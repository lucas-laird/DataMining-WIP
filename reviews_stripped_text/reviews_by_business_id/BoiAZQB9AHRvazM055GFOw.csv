The dahl is very flavorful, all of the dishes are excellent. Come over and try it out you won't be sorry! The prices are reasonable, service is great.",LT836QnQtq3FhntKQ71J2w,3,2,5,fwl2LjV1ITese4eMvBLGNg
2456924,2018-06-12,0,BoiAZQB9AHRvazM055GFOw,"First, my stars are for the food. It was excellent. Very flavorful! 
HOWEVER, this place is not going to last. On a Friday night, no one was in the restaurant. Even the former Bachi burger joint couldn't survive in that location. Paradise India should have a smaller place with more people traffic. 
Doubt I will be back, just because I saw the Chef leave and duck into the fitness gym after I left.",hclaCaAijyBB_8oJQrulxQ,1,0,4,qYkcsrDVFs_Re5R9jxAMxQ
2560324,2018-06-24,0,BoiAZQB9AHRvazM055GFOw,Excellent experience here. Friendly staff and nice location.  I love Indian food and I brought my parents here for their first Indian food experience. We got several different things to try a lot of the menu. It was all delicious. We are all happy with the food and experience. The owner/cook even came out to check on what we thought. He was very kind and we appreciated him coming to say hello.  I would come here again soon if I weren't just here on vacation.  I would recommend this place for sure!!,Lfcfi07ymAdaHZlph_QRNg,1,1,5,qDrNQrVcR_1y-rm0uk5zeA
3188921,2018-06-27,0,BoiAZQB9AHRvazM055GFOw,"We have been lost without William since his W Sahara location shut down.  Had to pay him a visit at his lovely new store.  I had the lunch special of Chicken korma AND chicken tikka masala, served with rice and the coolest lookin naan bread ever.  I asked for a 7 spice level and he delivered, so authentic tasting.  Johan had a chicken curry and a 10 spice level, William made it by scratch for him and I have to tell you Johan loved it, every mouthful saying, yeah that's it.
Will have to make this a weekly visit now.  If you want traditional Indian food made with love then you will not be disappointed.",WstpcZuGllb1aeonbhQ3CQ,1,1,5,g5bgFnZeUJVS_-81w-V2Qg

3463666,2018-05-29,0,BoiAZQB9AHRvazM055GFOw,This is without a doubt the best Indian food restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is amazing here. I have gone to other Indian restaurants in Vegas and it does not compare to the rest of the Indian restaurants in Vegas. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,NeL4Pc1LbxsFYgvnelw3YA,0,0,5,lOXwHnz6_bttm9S_QpF4HQ
4081118,2018-06-28,0,BoiAZQB9AHRvazM055GFOw,"This is a fantastic spot for Indian food because everything is fresh prepared.

So if I want to remove some spices from my food, like cumin seeds (which are junk because they irritate the digestive tract), then it's no big deal. Almost all the other Indian places in town premix things several days in advance which means the food at these other places isn't truly fresh.

I also like the variety of choices on the menu and it's also rare to find Indian spots with dosa.

Service is very attentive and friendly.

Keep up the good work!",6gSIqISrFmTeBpEmYjf3Ag,1,1,5,aMqvEYQmnkmMqjaEC4K9kQ

I had the lunch special.  a  Chicken/Korma, Chicken/Curry combination with the best Naan Bread I ever had ! The sauces were rich and so flavorful ! I am so glad I went there and can't to go back !!",9NXhh39zgPuz_8GEt3i3UQ,1,1,5,JF8mIvYVeQvig925f8WfaA
4467054,2018-05-24,0,BoiAZQB9AHRvazM055GFOw,"Drove out here because the hours listed that it was open at 3:20 pm. Was extremely frustrated to find that despite the hours listed on Yelp, and their own door, the restaurant had a paper sign up reading closed 3-5pm. Extremely frustrated as I drove out of my way to try this restaurant out.",I-KJH-Zpc6DB4BEMC-WDPA,1,0,1,unYTpAGanP_9mnjy89DtAQ

4555090,2018-06-01,0,BoiAZQB9AHRvazM055GFOw,The wife and I tried this place a couple months ago and are hooked - we've been back 3 times.  Everything is made to order so expect a little wait - but it's worth it.  The food bursts with flavor and is obviously crafted from fresh ingredients.  The only suggestion we have is to please add a sample platter to the menu so that people can try several dishes at once.  We suggested one sample platter with poultry and the other vegetable.  If you already know what you like you're in for a treat.,gA28fpJ1QBdGGYtETI9ajg,1,0,5,yvAXsjzlATPtz48Bt1P-fQ
4622482,2018-05-16,1,BoiAZQB9AHRvazM055GFOw,The review is from a Mothers day lunch at the restaurant. Selected the restaurant based on other glowing reviews. The experience was quite the opposite. The food choices were limited and the quality was bad. Our group left most of the food after tasting it. Will not be visiting again. Very disappointed.,D1q2udKikeOvcry36WegHQ,0,0,1,Z7T0bt1pJnsalyudnj5tMw

4910568,2018-06-13,0,BoiAZQB9AHRvazM055GFOw,"So happy that there is a great Indian restaurant  that recently opened up in the neighborhood.  I love Indian food and this place more than satisfies the craving.  This is my third time there and the vegetable pakora, shrimp biryani, lamb curry, chicken tandoori, and pistachio desert was delicious.  The atmosphere is clean and classy.  Excellent service.  I hope more people find this place because it's awesome",6npV9UVmWD7stZg9W_Igww,1,1,5,E-5KriM68nTibD7F3GFmeQ

The best for me was the Chana Saag, chickpeas and spinach in a delicious sauce. Also the naan bread was amazing! Oh and please try the mango lasse. Best I have ever had. Enjoy!!",_O6Q4ScLO4-FVieEzCibXA,1,1,5,y5i1bnvKW8PutGq_Q5n3Nw
