What time did they actually close? It said 1:00am. So we actually had 30mins before closing.

1687808,2013-11-26,6,dqtWVr1WlaQcmPPCrmZH3w,"I am a fan of all things Delta Tango.  It is my menu for life if ever stuck on a deserted island and I could the proverbial ""one"" or multiple things.  This particular location is surrounded in a moat like fashion by the drive-thru.  If your going into dine, you have to walk through it.  I arrived on cold and windy day, looking for chow for me and some to take home to the boy.  The line seemed short (one vehicle) but little did I know, that one vehicle had ordered..it seemed everything on the menu.  I waited....waited...more vehicle behind me...and then we all waited.  In other fast food establishments, this sort of customer is told to park and the food will be brought out to them.  NOT HERE, but maybe they should take a look into this policy.  After waiting almost ten minutes, the thought of rolling through the drive-thru and seeking chow elsewhere danced in my head.  I took multiple breathes and had it not been for the pleasant demeanor of the Anna Kendrick doppelg√§nger, I would have done just that.  Despite the slow service, the chow is as Del Taco does.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,8,6,3,jie9Xr9PSBPAKiqylU2BBg

There was no line at the drive thru but the cashier taking our order was so out of line. She gave us so much attitude, and when my brother told her the attitude wasn't necessary she said "" you can leave then, i'm not going to serve you, bye"". I was so shocked no one does anything about the customer service here, it's always TERRIBLE! We left the drive thru & went to eat at the one in centennial instead, with a better attitude & fresher food.

2847502,2014-01-30,0,dqtWVr1WlaQcmPPCrmZH3w,"I like Del Taco for the most part.  But this location is crossed off my list of places to eat.  They switch out their shift managers like underwear.  So the service isn't consist ant.  I went to the drive thru and ordered about 12.00 bucks worth of food.  I checked the bag for ketchup and notice the fries were all burned.  I parked and walked into the dinning room and asked for fries that weren't burned (dark orange and super crispy).  The manager said they're all like that.  And sure enough, I looked and they had a whole thing of where they put the fries sitting there burned just like mine.  

I'm not picky but Del Taco fries are always salty and a little crispy but not crunchy like chips.  I complained to their corporate office, even giving my contact info along with completing a survey.  I have heard nothing.  I sent a follow up email to their corporate office complaining about the visit how they didn't even offer to cook new fries.  I got my money back for just the fries and ate the rest of the food without FRIES.  I should have refunded the whole order but I wasn't thinking.  Oh well, let somebody else pull that crap and I will.  But I don't go to that one location anymore.",H0Wbq_EIAieHbHR8Fi2R2A,1,0,1,HdmXThsXLD0gc3SE97MTmQ

3495669,2015-09-27,1,dqtWVr1WlaQcmPPCrmZH3w,"I understand that when you go to a ghetto fast food place like del taco you shouldn't expect much in terms of customer service. But these guys have given the term ""horrible customer service"" a whole new meaning. Here's been few of my recent experiences:
-I go to the drive-thru and order 2 sausage breakfast tacos and emphasize twice that I want them with sausage. The cashier gives me my total and Instructs me to pull to the window to pay. I get to the window and I double check my order and the cashier with attitude, Richard, tells me I ordered a regular breakfast taco without sausage. I go to tell him that's not correct and he cuts me off and says ""I was going to ask you what kind but you drove off."" Drove off?! He specifically asked me to pull to the window telling me that he's got my order!! After that Richard was full off attitude and essentially threw my order in the car. No thank you no nothing! 
-Today I go to the drive-thru order breakfast with hash browns. I come home and there's a SINGLE hash brown stick in the bag. Really?! That's like ordering French fries and getting a single fry in the bag! I go back and they replace the order.
Called del tacos customer service line and of course no one bothers to pick up!!

3949240,2017-10-19,0,dqtWVr1WlaQcmPPCrmZH3w,"I honestly rarely go to Del Taco, but my son wanted something to eat and needed to use the restroom.  I remembered that they have great crinkle fries so I stopped here on the way to our next errand.  We go inside and no one is at the register, but there is one man working the drive-thru window and another man, along with a women making food.  All three of these people made eye contact with me.  Two of them walked right by me.  Did any of them acknowledge us? No.  None of them said a word to us.  So we wait and wait and wait.  A good five minutes go by.  The man working the drive-thru walks by again, yet never says one word to me.  So I said something.  I mean I've never had such rude service in my life.  I understand when they are busy and cannot stop to take an order, but to not acknowledge a customer who is clearly standing there to make an order is just inconsiderate and bad customer service overall.  By that point I didn't even want their food and I told them that.  Maybe I was the wrong shade of brown for them, who knows. I'll never go back to find out.",49K6GNShDqaodhkYR8E0gQ,0,0,1,2v9F-zp4fySp1bxmH_0giQ

I'm sure I would have a better meal in a North Korean prison, and they hardly feed their people. Not looking forward to pissing out of my ass from the internal distress this is most likely going to cause me.
