The box men sweat the dice and the rollers who happen to have a good run of luck.  The young ladies dealing are certainly friendly, but the box staff make up for that in a negative way.  My advice is go play at another casino mere steps away, where they actually are happy to see your action.",c3hdByZRnnMBEQyUyYr2Ag,0,0,1,MhJlqosLYNn3pKfb2g6-6g

Am Eingang bekommt man üblicherweise einen Couponflyer zugesteckt. Diesen sollte man bei seinem Erstbesuch unbedingt mitnehmen.
Der Flyer enthält Gutscheine für  ein Gratis-Foto mit einer Million Dollar, für ein gratis Spiel an Slot-Promotion-Automaten (mit der sehr geringer Chance ein paar Tausend Dollar zu gewinnen), für einen Las Vegas-Kofferanhänger und für ein 2-für-1 Burger-Angebot usw.. So hat man auf jeden Fall schon mal 2 Gratis Souvenirs (Kofferanhänger & Foto).
Es lohnt sich dem Playersclub vom Binions beizutreten. Denn man kann dort täglich seine Clubkarte ""swipen"" und Comps abräumen (Freeplay (Slots oder Tischspiele), 2-für-1-Gutscheine, 10$- oder 15$-Gutscheine fürs Binions-Cafe oder täglich wechselnde Geschenke).
Das Slot-Angebot ist bunt gemischt, von einfachen alten Geräten bis zu den neuesten mit vielen Features ausgestatteten Geräten. Die Bedienung mit Getränken geht flott, auch wenn man eher am Rand des Casinos sitzt. 
Für die Toilette muss man einmal quer durchs Casino. Sie ist immer sauber und gepflegt gewesen.
Die Leute vom Playersclub sind sehr nett. Wenn man mal einen Coupon für ein Gratis-Geschenk ""geswipt"" hat, kann man normalerweise zwischen den verfügbaren Geschenken wählen. Wenn man Table-Freeplay ""geswipt"" hat, bekommt man das in 5$-Promo-Chips ausgezahlt und kann das Freeplay dann auch 5$-weise setzen (und nicht unbedingt alles auf einmal).
Das Binions gehört auf jeden Fall zum Casino-Pflichtprogramm in Downtown.",nhASzYdqRwYiUgASyMVKUw,0,0,4,9Gtcz_RaF3uGFgPvV9ng-A

Now when you do get in to play depending on who is working the tables the dealers act like they not only don't want to be there, they don't give a crap if you win or lose, and they just don't look happy at all. Seriously I've never seen such upset looking dealers at a busy table, most places cheer with the shooter to win cause it makes a good environment but also when people win, and feel good they tend to tip! It's the first time I barely tipped. And give someone a chance to make bets on the middle!! Stop getting the dice back and trying to move them as fast as you can to the shooter. I know more rolls means more money but don't bark us for not betting fast enough when you don't even let us throw in bets!! The overall feel of the crowded table that was hot was great but the dealers who could care less and looked like they wanted everyone to lose was shame full.

And the Dunkin' Donuts is even worse... the dirtbag behind the counter charged me MORE for a small coffee than a medium coffee would have been in a combo, even though I got the combo.  His response to me asking why he overcharged me?  ""You ordered a small coffee. I don't make the prices.""  You know what else you don't make, jackass?  A tip, or any repeat business.

And on Sunday, 1/21/18, about 11am I went up to the bar that is at the entrance to the sportsbook. I had 2 drink tickets in my hand and ordered 2 bloody Mary's. The white male bartender with black hair asked me if I wanted Tito's, or ___ or ___ (I forget the other 2 varieties of vodka). Neither of them was ""house"". So I assumed that they were my option for free (with the drink tickets). I chose Tito's, and he made the 2 bloody Mary's and told me that it was $15. I told him that I had the 2 drink tickets which I was sure that he had seen. He said in a very rude voice, ""you are gonna give me $15!"" At this point I felt like he was trying to intimidate me into giving him money that wasn't his to get. He was trying to be super loud and rude. I told him no, that I had drink tickets and what is he talking about. He told me that I was going to give him $15. I told him I wasn't and he poured the drinks out. He NEVER told me that they would be extra, he never offered house as an option.
Even though I am a local, my friends are not. I stayed the weekend at the 4 Queens, and they stayed at the Golden Nugget. I got them to go to Binions for gambling, but after that we all went to the 4 Queens. They lost a lot of business as we lost a lot of money on the slots. LOL
I look at it as one of three things happened....
1) the bartenders get a compensation from management if they upsale, or 2) he was trying to be a bully and bully me into giving him the money for his pocket, or 3) just a complete and total jerk that would rather pour the drinks out and waste the money for the drinks rather than telling me upfront that those certain alcohols were extra above and beyond the drink tickets.
I will not be back, and would love to talk to a food and beverage manager at Binions.

When you take the picture, they give you a coupon for $10 in matched table play, which you have to wait in line for and register to get a players card. Not a huge deal, and the free picture was appreciated, but they certainly got me for a bit more than I was planning on playing. Good thing they've got plenty of $5 tables!

It seems like whenever I take a cab from the strip to Fremont Street they drop us off outside of Binions.

To the driver (in case you missed my finger, but read Yelp reviews), fuck you!  You have no idea who you honked at.  After that incident, I made a quick pedestrian right turn into Binions to regroup, cool my heels and RELOAD my middle finger. 

Binions is a dive casino.  Nothing much is new.  It is decorated in everything dated and dark.  And, there are cocktail waitresses (with classic beehive hair) who you just know wear GRANNY PANTIES.  Disclaimer: no personal knowledge here, just an educated undergarment guess.  God bless these gals for being dedicated to their trade.  

The drinks are cheap and there are lots of drinkers (and animated tipsy serious gamblers hitting the tables).

You'd be right next to the Fremont Experience, with all the noise and sounds from the light show and from the concerts that go on during the night.  Plus, the rooms have not been refurbished like the ones at El Cortez or California Hotel so you end up feeling kinda dirty when you sleep there.  Did I mention the parking?  Yeah, the parking situation is pretty retarded, you gotta park across the street and then you can only get your ticket validated at the front desk every time you park.

Yup it's true. Binion's that hard scrabble gambling hall downtown, is maybe the most romantic spot in Vegas. At least for me. 

I asked my wife to marry me at the Bellagio Fountains, we got married at Caesars, but Binion's is the spot that does it for me. 

We were sitting at the Binion's Snack Bar. Which we love almost as much as we love the Coffee Shop downstairs.  Anyways, we were sitting there enjoying a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, when a very elderly lady asked me if she could sit down at the counter next to me. 

""Of course,"" I said, and moved my food over a little. Then she turned and helped her even more elderly husband to the chair.  Everyone knew the couple, they all asked how he was doing. He obviously was not doing too well. But he said something to the effect of, ""I'd complain, but who would listen!""

The couple sat down and ordered two bowls of the snack bar's famous Hobo Stew. Here is a link to a pdf of the menu of the snackbar. 
http://www.binions.com/dining/snackbarmenu.pdf

They talked to the cooks about their kids, about the cooks' kids, about life in general.  After they were finished, the lady helped him to his scooter and one of the cooks called out, ""See ya next week."" The gentleman responded, ""I'm not making any guarantees but I sure hope so."" 

Well turns out this couple had been coming to binions, every week for over 40 years. Sitting at this same counter, ordering that same hobo stew.  As we watched them go away, my wife said, ""Think that will be us someday?""

AMAZING!

My fiance and I had stayed across the street at the GN, but was disappointed with the $10 minimums at each table they had.  We really wanted to play table games, but didn't want to fork out that much on the front end (at first).  We decided to walk across the street to Binion's and check out this old beast.

The lurking smell of cigars and cigarettes, along with whiskey filled breaths made this casino feel like the real deal; the whole reason I chose to stay on the old strip.  A little bit of trash, with a little bit (or hardly any) class.

Before setting foot at the tables, I really needed to pass the fluids accumulating from hours worth of binge drinking.  When asking a random employee where the restroom was located, I was pointed in the general direction, PLUS they walked me to the location!  WOW!  This was not the only time that a staff member did this.  Another time we were trying to find the elevator to the steakhouse (which we did not eat at in the long run) and the employee walked us all the way through the casino to the elevator.  I was thoroughly surprised at this random act of kindness and help.

Tables here are cheap.  Flat out.  I played $5 blackjack, roulette, and let it ride.  Being fairly new to let it ride, the dealer proceeded to assist with my first few hands, advising me on my next moves (which in this case made sense since I was playing the house and NOT the dealer).  I was up on let it ride.  Went and sat at a blackjack table and was UP AGAIN.  Decided it was time to move to roulette.  Was UP AGAIN!  I stayed in this casino for nearly 4 hours spending my hard earned money on pure debauchery.  Drink service was prompt at the roulette table, but not so much at blackjack and let it ride.

These crawfish were not kept cold enough and had a rubbery taste as they were sitting on hard unfresh ice that had melted into itself. Maybe the ice was scared of the big mean cook staring me down with a sour look on his face as he stood behind the frozen station. The clam chowder soup was like milk and the whole time I was there, the bread and cracker baskets were not refilled once!

For the most part, the casino workers seemed over worked and grumpy.  I sat at a table playing blackjack with several friends and the pit boss (Terry) was very unhelpful and impatient.  It took over 30 minutes to get a player's card. The dealers didn't seem to care whether she helped me or not.
The real trouble here was after I bet $100 on a hand of blackjack I asked to be paid in 1 black $100 chip, and the dealer said he couldn't do that.  I told him it was my money, and I can request how to be paid and he said no and paid in green. When I got my pay, I told him I would like to 'color up' for a black and it took at least 5 minutes for the pit boss to come and approve a black chip, holding up the entire table.  I decided that was it and then colored the rest of my $300, which I'm sure they would have gotten back in tips and play if they hadn't been so rude.",UxFSkytSAsleG2hBXiordA,7,0,2,mhDq4EFsoLEdqKJCSpI8-g

My husband and I are HUGE fans of Vegas lore.  We cried bitter tears the day the Sands was torn down, and our heart aches a little whenever one of the ""original' casinos are torn down to make way for the new mega-resort plexes.

For those of you who aren't Vegas-obsessed, Binion's was once the shiznit of gambling in Vegas (it was known as the ""Horseshoe"" back then).  Unlike other casinos in the 50's, it didn't focus on shows or acts, and they didn't have a high-roller section...it was truly a casino that focused on the gambler.  It had the first ""$1M"" display on the floor, and it hosted the World Series of Poker back in the day.  The stories behind Binion's - the drama, the legends, and the tragedies can fill an entire book (and have).

So of course, we had to make a pilgrimage to Binion's. 

And like I said, it was like visiting your grandmother in the nursing home.  It was run-down and depressing, yet there were moments and glimmers of what she must have been like, back in the day.

2446331,2011-09-12,1,Zzl4ffV9kFY3yOSSgyRUBQ,"This review is ONLY for the Rooftop pool!!  I want to be CLEAR that I have no issues with the casino floor or hotel portion!  

On Saturday Sept 3rd, a group of us went to check out the rooftop pool and bar after the Howard Jones concert.  We all had VIP passes and the rooftop pool/bar put out an invite on Facebook that everyone with a VIP pass would receive their first drink free-so of course the group went to check it out!  

First of all, it's a nightmare to figure out the best way to get UP to the rooftop..we had to take 2 different elevators and only one friggin elevator was working to begin with!!  Now this isn't that big of a deal, but when you dangle the promise of a free drink in front of a crap-ton of people, maybe more elevators should be in working order?  

We finally made it up there-all of us in a great mood with smiles on our faces and ready to party!  I walked up to the bar, which had 2 men behind it.  I attempted to verify with the closest one (who appears to be a manager based off the difference in uniforms) that they are in fact offering a free drink if you show your VIP pass (cause I wouldn't want to assume!)  He shrugs and says he's pretty sure, but that the bartender will help us out.  He wasn't RUDE, but he wasn't inviting/warm/hospitable.  

So I asked the bartender the same question (even though he heard me ask the other guy and could have FAKED some customer service by ANSWERING with a simple YES or NO) and he says ""Yes"" in an extremely irritated tone of voice.  I then proceeded to order my drink (a vodka redbull).  He made sure to correct me that it isn't Redbull, but Monster energy drink that they have, to which I verbally stated ""That's fine, I'll take that"", but he just kind of stands there.  I stare at him, confused..he then tells me to ""Order here"" and points to a spot that is right in front of him and 2 feet to my left.  I stepped to the left, and wait patiently for the drink I thought I had already ordered to be made.  He looks at my group like we're a bunch of idiots and loudly asks ""Okay?!  Well?  What do you guys want?""  I did a double take while my best friend orders a beer, figuring that would be an easy thing to get started on since apparently this is the most difficult task the bartender has ever encountered.  

Best friend gets her beer (without being charged mind you), so then I ask (again) for a vodka redbull.  Obviously that's my bad since he had already corrected me that it's MONSTER, not Red Bull.  I chuckled (still trying to salvage this entire experience) and say ""Oh sorry, ok yes.  I will take a Vodka Monster.""  He sighs and makes the drink.  Puts it down to the right of me (where I moved FROM when he originally asked me to move in front of him), so I pick it up and move out of the way.  He points at the drink and says ""That will be $8.50.""  I stare at him, thoroughly confused and ask why I'm being charged for what was supposed to be a free drink given I have the VIP pass that I ASKED HIM ABOUT NOT 5 MINUTES EARLIER.  He shakes his head irritatedly as if this is the first time I'm dropping this info on him and says ""Well fine, it's $3.50 then for the Monster.""  Without missing a beat I say, ""Okay, then I'll take a vodka cranberry instead.""  He shakes his head and says he already poured the drink and that it must be paid for.  I calmly inform him that he should have informed me that extra charge prior to making the drink since he knew we all had VIP passes and that was HOW we were procuring our drinks.  He still insisted that it must be paid for.  We went back and forth another 2 times-neither of us giving up any headway.  Meanwhile, the manager looking fellow is just watching.  Not stepping in, not mediating, nothing..

Luckily for everyone involved, another patron not with my group jumps in and says that he'll pay for the drink since it's what he wanted anyhow and the bartender actually shook his head NO!!  At that point I exclaimed loudly ""Oh PERFECT!  Here you go sir"", and I handed the drink to him and he pulled his cash out and proceeded to get rung up by the manager guy.  I then turned back to the bartender and asked for a vodka cranberry and the bartender begrudgingly made it.  The rest of my group ordered their drinks..and put AWAY the cash we had taken out for tip.  

The manager then pulled out a hole punch and reached for my VIP pass-luckily I pulled it out of his reach or something that *I* consider to be memorabilia would have been ruined.  I told him not to worry, that we were taking our business elsewhere so he didn't need to deface our property.  He nodded dismissively and we all walked away. 

I apologize for how long this review is, but I felt it was important to highlight how the bartender passed up multiple opportunities to provide good service (not even excellent or great service..just good service).",01HQG1i5zBwmi0nRD4o1Ng,5,0,1,eyske1_rQIzuMZO_5FPYtQ

This review isn't about that. Moving on. 

The parking garage is tiny. NO FREE PARKING. The validation is a joke. The staff is rude. Period. They must all be miserable. Asked someone to validate our parking pass because we actually did gamble real money. We were told to find a slot attendant. We passed by someone and I politely said, ""Excuse me?""

Many hotels give you free money to play, or the first $20 loss is on them. At this place, you have to spend $50 and then you get $10 in free play-- Just seemed like an unlucky place, to me--

I make it a goal to stop here every trip and have never been disappointed. I can see how others may dislike it but this is my home when I visit Vegas.

I hadn't been to Vegas since 2009, and wondered how this place would do without the hotel.

However, I was THRILLED to see the casino still hopping, and that they were planning to reopen the hotel.  Binion's seems to be headed back in the direction it deserves to, and I can't wait, if the rumors are true, to rebook at that hotel.

Games were good variety of old and new, dealers, cashiers and servers were all friendly and helpful.  I was thrilled to be back, feel welcomed, and am really rooting for Binion's to make the comeback it richly deserves!",3icARk4_OM5kIvSnzgSbyw,1,0,4,xPeMr7HXzafHHTfHK_tBVg

I went inside to order my second beer(third beer of the night-just so you know that I wasn't intoxicated). The first bartender, Santo, was very polite and nice. When I went back to get another Lagunitas, the other bartender was extremely rude to me. I sat patiently and waited for about 15-20 minutes while I casually sipped the remnants of the previous cup. Finally, the bushy mustached barkeep told another guy to take my order. I asked for a Lagunitas and then waited another 15-20 minutes, patiently....very, very patiently. I wasn't in a hurry as my husband was playing blackjack behind me. Well, eventually the big bushy mustached bartender came back near my side of the bar where I was sitting and I said that I ordered a Lagunitas about 15-20 minutes ago. I wasn't rude about it, just stated a fact. He rudely yelled me, ""And it might be another 15-20 minutes before you get it!"" Well, I was done and walked away. I was now in hot pursuit of a manager. There was no reason for him to not serve me. I wasn't drunk. I am not sure if it was because I wasn't gambling, or what, but it was completely uncalled for. I was buying beer with hard cold cash. Seems like that would be acceptable. I mean, it is a bar too right? He certainly wasn't busy, unless by busy you mean chatting up the 5 hookers sitting in the other side of the bar. They had to be working girls because the two guys that they were talking to certainly couldn't have hooked up with chicks that hot on their own. Anyhow, after asking about 4 different employees, I was directed to Jackie who I shared my story with. I told her that I used to be in the bar business and am fully aware of the ""customer always being wrong policy"", but felt that I did nothing to warrant his rude behavior. She informed me that she just had a complaint about the same big bushy mustached barkeep the night before and that she was going to tell his boss. She wasn't the manager of the bar, but I do hope she tells the bar manager. I hope his rude self gets fired! He does not belong in the customer service industry if that is how he treats his customers. Sorry that I wasn't dressed like a working girl.

3005201,2014-06-30,0,Zzl4ffV9kFY3yOSSgyRUBQ,"My wife and I are staying at the Golden Nugget across from Binion's Horseshoe Hotel & Casino Las Vegas.  We read it has a great steak house and was famous for poker play.

Today we went over to check out both.  We planned on playing and eating there that night.  On the way through the casino floor we saw a game that both of us enjoyed playing the last time we were in Vegas called Ribbit.

We knew the logic behind the game was to get one or two frogs around a pass in order to win free spins. My wife had put $57 in the machine, she had both frogs on the step (Lily pad) before the finish line, she had one frog with 22 spins the other frog with about 50 spins, and three extra spends that would go to either one.

We also knew that when you cross the finish line the more you play the more you win. My wife decided to change her bedding from $.50 to a dollar. When she did that, it wiped the game out completely, and reset everything to the start of the game.

We called over a technician who opened again and replayed what had happened, he also verified how much money we had put into the machine to play that game.

We had two managers come over to the machine they could see my wife had put $57 into the machine, they could also see that the game had errorred under normal play, and they told us the policy was they could only give us $5 back.

I said, you can see how much we put in the game right there on the screen, why can't we have back what we put into the game? All we got back from the managers was the response that is not our policy, we can only give you $5. The senior manager then offered us dinner at their café.  For those of you that can remember the show Mel's Diner, you can think of the café at Binion's as that diner, but much much dirtier.

Because we were already headed to the steakhouse, my wife asked why can't we eat at the steakhouse?   Again the response was, because that is against our policy, I can only give you a free meal at our café.

Highly agitated we took the offer and as we walked away I said to the technicians standing there you better make sure you turn that game off. We went to the cage (cashier) to cash the ticket of the remaining money we had on the machine, and as we were walking out we saw all the technicians and the managers had left the machine on ready for the next sucker play.   

We lost 40 bucks at the casino, compared to the $400 to $600 we would have lost on a nice steak dinner and a night of poker play.  So why am I still so mad?  Because I came to Vegas to eat steaks and play poker, and the very poor management at Binion's ruined that for us for the night, and probably other nights also. We will not step foot back into that casino.",J1OP-9rT9MM5ITwGEHwfLg,0,0,1,To1PdL4bF8r4sKNR7yzy0g

My fiance and I decided to check out downtown Vegas. I had never been to old Vegas and I am a geek for history and dorky useless facts like seeing the first hotel in Vegas that had carpet installed which is Binions Horseshoe which is now called Binions. 

We came inside and it is what one expects. It is a gritty old casino that had seen better days. All the dealers are female and all wear cheesy cowboys hats with tight tank tops, little shorts, and cowboy boots. Imagine if Hooters went western. 

I couldn't believe my eyes when I caught a single deck 5 dollar blackjack table. My fiance and I sat down and played for roughly and hour and a half and had a ball. The dealers were all actually good looking ladies with great personalities. We had a great table with this nice guy in his fifties sitting next to me. He said that he makes the trip to Vegas every year and although he stays on the strip he only gambles in downtown Vegas. Drinks were free while gambling so we basically were entertained by a funny dealer, had free whiskeys, and talked it up with interesting people at the table. 

Gambling on the strip is a nightmare. 20 dollar minimum bets guarantees you a very short night of gambling unless you have a major budget. Black jack on the strip is also usually you against multiple decks. Not very fun. 

I rate this a four because not because it is a posh place but because it delivers on what it promises. Affordable and fun gambling with fun people and free drinks. Sounds like a nice combo to me.",Z2OTxORNQWGrYJGfuPVA1w,2,2,4,TtaoCm2Yykv4KBp8ScXOdA

I may be a bit biased since this place is where the Big Game use to be played and is the birth place of the World Series of Poker.  If you're into poker go back and check out the Poker Hall of Fame and the wall with the pictures of all the WSOP winners.  And take note, that douche Jaimie Gold doesn't have his picture up, because he's a disgrace to the game of Poker.  

They've got a real nice poker room, the low limit No Limit Hold'Em game is a min/max buy-in of $100 with $1/$2 blinds.  A bit high for me, so I was a little intimidated playing with $100 on the line....
  Until I caught QUAD QUEENS on only my second hand!!!!! (That's four of a kind, and *very* rare for you slot players keeping score at home.)   I played the hand like a retard because I was playing scared, but I got lucky to win my fifty bucks.  The rake is really low, even in the small stakes games, and they give prizes for high hands.  I got a little plastic lighter with a Binion's Horseshoe logo for my 4-o-Kind.  I figure you get t-shirts and jackets when you get straight flushes.  

The place had a really classy, yet welcoming feel to it.  It's not like the MGM Grand where you feel like if you've only got $100 in your pocket you're out of place.  The place reminded me of a bar I use to go to.  The decor was nice and stylish.  I'll have to see if any of my pictures turned out.

The downtown has a whole different feel from the strip. 
It is unique and mostly - a lot of fun.
Binion's is right in the middle of the action.

Binions is a ""fun"" place to gamble. The dealers are experienced vegas people and the craps table workers are excellent.
The bars always have one or two beers that can be had for $2.00.

I have always been given a nice room, not huge - but very nice ...
especially for the price.
My room always seems to overlook the big  screen and  is usually located right above one of the two stages for free music on the street.

I would give Binion's a four star rating, except for the fact that the self parking seems like a ""mile"" away friom the casino.
It is not easy to get to the casino and hotel from the parking lot.

The other reason for only three stars is there is very little food selection here.
Binion's once had a great little burger shop, but the sale of the property  a few years ago elimninated that fun little old style burger spot.

Binion's, just because of it's place in Vegas history, is a must stop for you on a visit to Las Vegas.

I go to the FREE PULL machine at the Fremont Street entrance (knowing that it's a gimmick), pull for fun, and ultimately get the coupons for:

1. Free $20 play at the special machines in the middle of the casino.  After you finish, you'll get a coupon for a free photo with the $1 million (or, if you get lucky, you can win something better).  The photo takes a while to develop (about 30 minutes) and it's placed in a nice folder, so just come back later for it; or join the Players Club (if you haven't already) and use another coupon that can double your bet on certain table games.

2. Free Luggage Tag - take the coupon to the 80% off Apparel vendor, located by the World Series of Poker tables. They have some $5 tote bags and some cool shirts and jackets.

3. Food coupons - right now, it's $1 off at the dessert shop.

We usually just pass through this casino on our way to the Fremont Hotel or the Beef Jerkey Store. Binion's is an older establishment with dark interior and a more crowded feeling.  It seems more smokey, and old school or ""vintage"".  You might be lucky and earn enough points on your Players Card to redeem for a deck of cards or a t-shirt like I did!

It was a great place to learn how to play craps, especially when they had $0.50 craps - with the ugly brown chips and crusty old local dudes that were always so grumpy and serious, as they were pissing away their social security checks down here.   Ahh, the old days...

Much of the old charm of Binion's has been replaced by the ""corporate"" culture of Harrah's.  If I had to spend time downtown, I'd either play at Golden Nugget (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/BIBWGO_r_1znnlmLbp4Nxg ), which feels more like the upscale action on the Strip, or Main Street Station (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/if59L5DHM4pPMrCx9HuD8A ), which I believe has the BEST ambiance because of old cowboy western theme.  Unfortunately, Binion's has lost it's charm and appeal in it's later days.   

Pros:
+ convenient parking
+ free parking validation by the cage
+ low ceilings

Cons:
- can be extremely smokey

I needed to waste some time between shows last night, so I stopped at Binion's for a little video poker.  It was a successful effort as I didn't lose my shirt nor anything else.

While the place could certainly use some upgrading, I find that Binion's is more than just an OK place.  Cocktail service has always been fast.  I also have learned where to play so that I have a ringside seat to watch the sexy cowgirls--the dealers that Lily D talks about in her review.  The dealers wear skimpy cowgirl uniforms that give some serious views.
Sometimes it's hard to concentrate on VP when you're eyeing the dealers going by.  They are attractive thangs!

This is my first visit to this casino so decided to explore a little. I was surprised that in Binion's name is not hotel but a gambling hall. That was more interesting too. I absolutely love the hidden history of old Las Vegas, so decided to find a small cafe or something and eat a bite to consult Google about such history. The Binion's Cafe is what I came across which served really feel good food with that small town feel where there is probably still a Main Street, and only one post office with horse tie ups out side of it. 

The casino gambling machines seemed to be upgraded in the last couple of years, I asked my server about this and he informed me they are still in the process of upgrading to provide the best guest service and stays. I tried my chances after eating at the cafe, but no luck this time it was a bust. 

The brick adds a great feature to the old time feel I believe that Binion's is still trying to convey to their guests. It feels good in this hotel too, with great positive vibes. All of the staff that I did interact with was very helpful and pleasant. The customers that are gambling are very nice and while I was gambling struck up a conversation with me about the awful Vegas heat. The cool blowing air conditioning inside of Binion's keeps us all cool. One of the best things about this hotel that I did not notice was the casino spray that is used to help mask the cigarette smell.

Wider ranges mean you have a better chance to win. I think at one time this was home to a super high table limit that got it some publicity. I don't know if that still is the case but still, this place gets respect for that.

4613692,2006-03-28,18,Zzl4ffV9kFY3yOSSgyRUBQ,"5 stars strictly for the $5 craps all night long.  I've never lost money on a craps table at binions.  in fact, i've made pretty good money.  IN FACT, i think of the craps tables at binion's as my second job.  i don't go in asking myself if i am going to win or lose money, i ask myself, ""how much money are you going to win tonight, laura?""  because that is the attitude of someone who WINS at craps.  and in life.  except for that second part, everything i said above is true.  sorry, True.

my advice: get your spot at a table and hold on to it for dear life even if some drunken frat boys are yelling things like, ""hey red!  you better move your ass or i'll move it for you!""  don't deal with these schmos...you're not here to flirt, you're here to win so block them out and get into the craps ZONE.  either that or have one of the dealers call security.  seems like everytime i'm here, there is either a lewd comment made in my general direction or a body part is groped by one of these charmers.  don't worry, the dealers are more than happy to kick their drunk asses out so don't hesitate to yell, ""hey, Ernie!  can you get these yahoos outta here...i'm here to gamble, not to babysit!  i know you know!""  once the fray boys are gone...it's time to play CRAPS!

more advice: don't go to the craps table (even the $5 all night crap table) with less than $100.  this is a game you have to go into big (um $100 is big to me i work in non profit so LAY OFF!!!) to win even bigger.  don't worry, it will all pay off.  half of this is a mental game...you are an athlete (albeit a drunk, fat one), picture the win.  make it real.  always bet at least $6 on the 6 & 8 and don't forget to back up your bet on the pass line with at least $5 ($6 if the mark is a 5 or 9!)  Listen...craps is the most fun and best odds of any vegas game (i think tied with black jack which requires some skill so fuck that!) and it's not that hard...it just can look intimidating.  grab your spot at the table, trade a couple of quips with the awesome dealers, ALWAYS tip (you watch their backs, they'll watch yours, capiche?) and don't go heavy on the free drinks.  remember, you're here to win.  not to have a good time.  oh...and if a table is cold, just leave.  walk away.  the number one mistake of a new gambler is not leaving a cold table.  ooh ooh...when you get to a table, ask the dealers, ""is this table hot, boys?""  THEY LOVE THAT!  um, this helps if you are a young woman and flashing a bit of clevage.  actually, maybe it's the clevage they like. i would not recommend doing this if you are a dude.  this is vegas, they will not hesitate to take you out back and kill you.  actually, i don't know if that's true but i like to think that it is.   

i have made over $1,000 playing craps at binions. i don't want to be the only one.  i am sharing this information with you so that you may go forward and win.  and to you i say: big money, no whammy!  mama needs a new pair of shoes!  winner winner (faux) chicken dinner!

But all expectations should come with a strict warning - I ended up being disappointed.  They took out the black jack table that allowed you to place an additional bet and play your had as a poker hand.  I guess it was too much fun and they needed to cut down on that.
So, I ended up playing their 6 pm poker tournament in the poker area behind the table games.  They took away the historic poker room on the other side of the casino - where all the greats played back in the day.  This tournament started out as a single table with 20 minute blinds.  There were 3 guys celebrating a birthday for one of them. They were more interested in Capt. Morgans and Coke than they were in poker.  Because they were so distracted and loud and drunk, we only had one round per blind level (at best) - but the clock never stopped.  That made for a VERY frustrating poker experience. When I talked to Scott (the Floor guy) he said he understood but it was the guy's birthday so they didn't want to do anything about it. The dealers, Diane, Keith and Klaus, were also frustrated but didn't even try to control their table. They pretty much just sat there waiting for someone to act.  After about an hour, an 11th player wanted to join in so they split us up into two tables.  That lasted for 3 hands then they put us back together.  It was completely disruptive and only added to my frustration.  At almost 10 pm we were down to 5 players.  I went out in 4th. I asked for food comps, which Scott was quick to get for me.
The dealers and Scott were all very nice but for anyone looking for a more professional ""real"" poker experience, I highly recommend going somewhere else.
The rest of the casino is OK - nothing great. There were very few newer machines and they're all pretty tight.  The cafe is average at best.

It was a good experience being able to see one of the vintage Las Vegas locations. Plenty of history in this building and it still feels like the older Vegas before the new strip went up. These are the building that people see in the movies and sure enough they don't disappoint. In comparison to other locations on the strip and close by it, the max bids are much lower here and there are TRUE penny machines here as well. On the negative side, this place is filled with the smell of cigarette smoke, and for the saintly it may not be the best place for children. This particular casino appeals to the older more mature crowd. Some of the employees have an off putting manner about them. Particularly at the tables, many of the dealers may not interact with guest in the most cheerful manner.

It takes about thirty minutes for the printout. 
Once you join up with their gamblers club, they give you one free spin on the computer slots, or something. They have a lot of other offers where if you're a consistent gambler, you get lots of perks and comps. 
They offered Jacks or Better poker with good paying odds on cheaper machines.

We called building maintenance and the older gentleman that came by to so-called repair the damage was quite acusatory.

5181857,2010-01-26,1,Zzl4ffV9kFY3yOSSgyRUBQ,"Definitely the worst hotel experience I've ever had. My bf and I planned to stay here 3 nights the week before we moved to Vegas in Sept 2009, to look at apartments and such. We booked Binion's because we like Downtown and it was only $17/night. I'm a fan of the vintage look, so going down the hotel hallways was a blast from the past, but the beds are basically cots. I'm not picky about mattresses but you could feel EVERY spring in these cots, it was difficult to fall asleep. So after having fallen asleep the first night, we hear the fire alarm go off around 8 am the next morning. We were extremely distraught. The fire alarm has an individual speaker in every room and it is VERY loud, it's deafening. We were told over the speaker that it was a false alarm. So alright, whatever, we go back to sleep. About 45 minutes later it happens again, only to continue for the rest of our stay...

Our second day there the alarm goes off almost nonstop. It goes off every now and then in the early afternoon, and a few hours later it is literally going off at LEAST every 10-20 minutes. My bf couldn't take a phone call for a few minutes without the alarm interrupting. We learn that the fire department is there trying to fix the alarm, which in turn just makes it go off constantly. We tried to stay away from our room as much as possible. We sleep there a second night and the alarm goes off here and there throughout the evening and night.

The next day my boyfriend can't take it anymore and we decide to leave a day early. The alarm goes on and on and on as we pack up our crap as quickly as possible. He tries to get a refund when we check out, or some kind of acknowledgment of care for their guests, but they refused to do anything but try to comp us a meal (but staying in the building was too unbearable; you could hear the alarm going off while on the casino floor, walking on Fremont St, or even while driving by Binion's). Getting a refund wouldn't have been about the money, it was extremely cheap to stay there. It's just our entire stay was so HORRIBLE he wanted some kind of compensation and got nothing.

The cherry on top was when I had a tasty burger at their cafe place but ended up getting sick on it (and I RARELY get sick on food). This is another reason we did not take the offer for a comped meal, I did not want to get sick on Binion's food again.

We then were told to buy a drink, or food, or find someone walking around who works in the slot area. We went to a restaurant and the waitress was completely rude and would not stamp the ticket.

5466062,2011-08-06,1,Zzl4ffV9kFY3yOSSgyRUBQ,"I REALLY wanted to hold off on writing this review.  I actually do like this place, but its current state, however much I actually do like and frequent this casino....  Someone needs to give this place some TLC.

The interior is kind of fun, it's like you're going into one of those Old West saloons where the piano guy and sarsaparilla should be slung around, though I doubt the Old West had the aforementioned ""sexy cowgirls"" dealing out cards like that.  But I seriously doubt that they're going for historical accuracy here.  The staff as a whole, however, has always been very nice and helpful.

""It doesn't sound bad so far"", you say, so what gives?

With the downturn in economy, they've shut down a LOT of areas in the casino.  For the longest time, it was all of the rooms (which were small, but not bad, and a comfortable bed).  

What hasn't come back, however, is their excellent Coffee Shop that shut down in 2009, where the food was consistently excellent with a familiar and top-notch staff, and even the casino's gift shop is gone.  They had a generic T-shirt shop over by the Coffee House that always looked like it was going out of business for years, but now it's taken over the other side of the casino, replacing the gift shop and the original check-in area.  It looks like they've turned a casino cashier cage into the new check-in place, and it just looks ghetto.

And there lies the problem with Binion's.  It doesn't look run down.  It's just that when you move past the main gambling floor that it starts looking closed down.  I understand self-preservation to stay open at all, but the place is always looking busy with gambling.  Certainly some of that revenue can help to restore some of that shine on the old girl.

I really hope things get better for this casino.  It's got old-style charm, a great location, and a lot of history going for it.  It deserves better.  It deserves to be restored.  If they can work on fixing up the Plaza, then it's time that Binion's owners take a note and do the same.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,1,0,3,mUvh36vd1Ix3WyRz1DwMhQ

I've stayed at the Hotel here before and it was 2.5 or 3 stars at best. The property is now owned by the same owners as the 4 Queens where I love to stay which is where I just stayed for 3 nights. Binions hotel portion has been closed for over a year for renovation, but the casino has remained opened. They have Zero Rake at their $2/4 Limit Hold'em poker tables 9am to noon. Not sure if that includes weekends. I wanted to play at Binions just cause it's sorta a tradition for me... playing where all the legends of poker used to play. I've had the pleasure to meet many of them... Doyle, Hellmuth, Ferguson, Chan and more... 

So on my last day of my Vegas trip, sat down at the $2/4 Limit cash game (the only game going at the time) and after a few minutes of play, I win a pot with quad fives... JACKPOT! Yup... I won over $1,500 for the high hand jackpot... Luv you more Binions!

No smoking allowed in the poker room. Free drinks while playing poker. A decent mix of regulars and tourists provide a lively game.

The hotel is being renovated so it should open sometime in 2013... In the meantime, if you like to find a low limit cash game or a $1/2 NL Texas Hold'em cash game... this is not a bad place to spend your time.

If you are looking to party, spend a lot of bucks on bottle service, VIP treatment and party with the beautiful people... look elsewhere... but if you are looking for an inexpensive casino to play some poker... I highly recommend you go to Binions at least once. 

I like to stay at the 4 Queens and play poker here at Binions and at the Golden Nugget if you want to know. They are all within a block of each other, as opposed to staying on the strip where it is a loooong walk just going to a casino next door to the one you are leaving...",KMfLcj021gd55naYESzSkA,3,0,5,yCfnno6VzjDH_0hHHFl3vg

They have single deck blackjack with $5 minimums at non peak times. Get there before noon weekdays and after 1am.

When we're playing tables up front, the cocktail servers are attentive and very nice. This past Tuesday mid afternoon, the 2 ladies serving cocktails were absolutely great! So funny and attentive. Great service. We were telling the guys at our table how awesome Binions is to play at and the service is very nice. 

The only downside is the smokiness. The ceilings are low and ventilation is not good.  4 guys at a nearby table were all smoking fat cigars and I just about died.

I had a photo shoot this past weekend and needed to spend the night in Vegas so I looked at what was available. I often stay at The Artisan off Sahara (I'll post a review) and it was the same price as Binion's but I had never stayed at Binion's before, it was on my list of places to try and I wanted to meet up with all my friends to go drinking so it was the right location. The casino itself is pretty cool-and definitely worth checking out. The staff were lavishly dressed in tshirts for a Halloween event and all were really friendly and helpful. Parking is a bit of a walk away if you have bags though so bear this in mind before you start the hike. There's a burger/hotdog lunch counter off the casino floor that is pretty rad-reminds me of the old K-mart lunch counters.

OK so that's about where the coolness ends. I know there's a lot of people that love this place and overlook the rooms-and yeah, when you're in vegas you're not going to be in the room a lot unless you're entertaining the local ladies of leisure so there's not much reason to complain about the rooms BUT. This may have been the dingiest, worn out, and uncomfortable room I've stayed in since college. The bed was like a sheet of plywood, the carpet looked worse than the carpet on the casino floor, the wallpaper was from the 80's and there was the ubiquitous iron burn in the floor which I found ironic because there's NO iron in the room....maybe one begot the other. 

All in all unless you're staying there during an event (I did) the rooms are ridiculous cheap. Even when there's something special going on the rooms are really cheap....but the only way the room is worth it is if you're almost not paying for it.....

Everyone there was pretty friendly, the people working at the Club Binions anyway. Everyone else working there was pretty ""bleh"". I understand, they get the same questions from different people on a daily basis. Oh well... Their sports book room was considerably less crowded, but there weren't much seating, and this was opening weekend for betting on NFL, so it was standing room only or find a semi-clean seat on the floor. There were some seats at the video craps table where you can sort of see the three tv's. 
What I found entertaining, as I left my boyfriend and his friend to watch football, was if you signed up for Club Binions, you get an automatic ace card with a $10 minimum bet, and a $10 match play on the slots. I mean, why not try your luck right? You can also get a 2 for 1 meal at their cafe, can't use your comp dollars there though for that. Must pay with regular money! Sadly, we did not dine there, maybe next time.

Binions is located downtown. It is a old casino. Showing its age,
There are a few restaurants at this casino we have gone to over the years,

We always seem to park here when we go to Fremont. They have a parking garage and you  can stay here and gamble and get your ticket validated when you go in to say you were here.

We play for awhile then we may go take a walk out and watch the Fremont Light Show but because we park at Binions we try to play and eat here when we go here,

I am surprised at how packed some of the tables games get, It is a busy old casino.
Talking some old history here!!!
Elevators to the garage are small and stuffy they do the job but there is a few times I thought we may get stuck! They have to be the original ones.. They open front and back,

If you like old Vegas stop into Binions and walk around.

It's old, outdated, and not terribly exciting in terms of gambling. It smells funky when you go in, and I honestly wondered if they were even open, as the lobby looks empty, and almost like they were having some sort of garage sale inside with clearance items from the casino. It was very odd when we went in. 

The employees were rude. That was my one big complaint. I could overlook the old, outdated, smelly building to enjoy some Vegas history, had the bartenders/waitresses/attendants/whatever the hell they're called weren't so rude. I had just sat down at a machine, and asked one for a drink as she was passing. Hadn't had a chance to put money in the machine yet. Just saw her passing, and knew service in these places was a little slow, so I might as well order a drink while she was nearby. In a very hostile tone, she told me I had to be gambling to get a drink. She seriously watched me walk up to the machine and sit down, and was in the middle of opening my wallet to get money out. Very clear that I had all intentions of being a paying customer. But she elected to be rude anyway. 

I wasn't terribly impressed with anything about this place. I can't really see myself returning in the future. I came, I saw, and I got bored fairly quickly. Sadly, it was before my drink arrived too.
