He ordered the Mini Burgers (Kobe Beef) with fries which had 3 mini burgers. It was delicious! I ordered their pizza, it was good but just really oily. But the best thing of all is their mini duck tacos, they are so small and cute and oh so fantabulous! Totally recommend it. It comes with 6 mini tacos for only $9.95! 

Over all I've been here about 6 times and always try something new...
I recommend:
Mini duck tacos
Pastas are delicious (they are pretty big so you can actually share with someone) Shrimp with angel hair is my fav which is $14.95.
Lebni with flat bread is oh so mouth watering! Only $8.95 it's a great starter!
Kobe burger $10.95

I've tried more but wasn't a big fan like the mahi mahi tacos, not the best I've had! Lobster bisque is okay not the best I had!

Anyway, this place is really small but the staff is friendly and lots of parking!",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,4,1,4,00DfEImpYpY7XK5VWGggJA

The pizza really reminds of CPK.  Same small pizza and similar flavors.  We had the Margharita and Pepperoni pizza.  The dough had a good taste which is important to me.

The salads were ok- like I said probably better in the restaurant.  The hummus was delicious, but the flatbread was a little dry.

I ordered the donuts and they looked fantastic, but I did not get to try them.

The restaurant is cute, the servers were nice.",VmIxnHKDYisxy5V9L40CMw,2,1,4,g-wBUR4w28nW2H__re9fdw

621615,2008-05-23,3,K5Ex8diP6rIh8P16D8KHVA,"Nice place for what a pizza place has to offer.

$8.95 for a Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad (that can feed 2 if your ordering pizza etc.) You can get the $14.95 plate. Maybe that feeds 4?

$9.95 for the Margherita: Roma Tomatoes, Garlic, Fresh Basil.
Tasty good. Asked for extra garlic didn't seem to make it on this order. Or it could be the Garlic Cheese Bread ($5.95) was head & shoulders more ""garlicy"" so the pizza paled in comparison?

Before, I have tasted some left over Thai Chicken pizza that was in the fridge at home, it was very tasty. Will try it fresh out the oven eventually.

 The Messy Sundae ($8.50)
My visit was for a B-Day. (FREE they said on B-Day) 
This is a Very Tall (stands what looked like 1-1/2 ft.) sundae glass cascading with chocolate over a couple of scoops of icecream.
It was fine finish to the stay!

Mixed bag as far as customers go, the retired, the first date, the small family, even a table of kids babysitting themselves. 

Kids Menu available.

Wait staff is on it. 
Lets call this a Pizza Restaurant with polished details and an upscale menu. Check it out. 3 other Las Vegas location with another opening soon S.Rainbow. And 10 more in SoCal.

Only thing I noticed, at least for this time of year, the Sun crashes through the windows from off to the left. So be aware. They have blinds but I noticed that those annoying little streaks still get through for some time.

I'll check it out again and get better layout details. for ya'all.

781949,2012-08-18,1,K5Ex8diP6rIh8P16D8KHVA,"What happened to the Daiya Cheese?  I didn't see it as a substitution option in the pizza section on the menu so I asked our server.  The menu was redone a few weeks ago so now there are only 3 options for vegans.  Not even the fried tofu with ginger miso is a vegan option - really, vegans are usually the only people that will consider ordering tofu from a non-asian restaurant and Sammy's isn't going to make that an option for us?

Well, one order of hummus for me and a vegetarian pizza for my husband and here's the review.  (BTW, he asked to omit the eggplant from the vegetarian pizza but was told that the toppings were already mixed together.  What?  Are the pizzas  pre-assembled now?  Well, our order was up in less than 5 minutes which solidified my theory - total chain restaurant.  I know there are a lot of Sammy's locations but I honestly thought that freshly prepared food was still the norm.  

The hummus was smeared on the plate with a sloppy dowsing of paprika and served with 8 wedges of flat bread.  I seriously wonder if the flat bread was vegan friendly because it tasted like butter was spread on it rather then olive oil.  I had to generously season the hummus with red pepper flakes for some taste.  

The vegetarian pizza had no flavor.  Husband had to season with both salt & red pepper flakes.  We also deconstructed the pizza looking for any sauce which we could not find.  It did appear that the cherry tomatoes on top were fresh.  

We ordered one glass of wine and one beer and that was all we had.  After consuming all of the red pepper flakes water would have  been welcomed but for some reason we were not offered it.  The other 4 occupied tables in our area all had water, including the other table our server was waiting on.  On the way out the door we made it a point to take water inventory on the rest of the occupied tables and confirmed that we were the only ones without.  

After this experience the all too familiar conversation that we have in the car on the way home is titled:  This is why we never go out to eat.",G4pBy0nzqqkKgJEHrDNcWQ,2,1,2,Rt6AbrBKPUw7nm_ESFh66A

I am a fan of their Balsamic grilled chicken salad.  Chicken is marinated and it tastes great, love the cheese and the walnuts as well.  I can taste the basil in the salad and I like the flavor it brings.  I would strongly suggest asking for dressing on the side.   Couple of times I forgot to ask for dressing on the side and my salad was drenched in dressing...

SHE heaped the apologies and freebies on us and was extraordinarily nice.  so then i called corporate and told them the whole story.  after that, jay had called back and basically said well we dont really know who did what (not taking any blame), but we will send a gift certificate to you for your troubles.  i am not exaggerating when i say we have probably spent several thousand at this place in the last year, and we had told corporate that.  and the order that was wrong was about a $100 order.  a few weeks later i get a $20 gift certificate in the mail.  we havent been back to that location since.  and now he cant even remember (this was only a few months ago) and wants to make things right??  i guess if i'd have replied to his message, maybe i'd have gotten another $20 off.  no thanks, i'll drive to sahara.  his reply just makes me irritated all over again.  if you go there, dont ask for jay...he has memory issues.",RA1JBOU0pFiOzbMEeZ4zhA,0,0,2,3ildigYdyLVGvse-BPd0DA

I stumbled into the restaurant I typically go to during the lunch hour to get a gluten free pizza, and this particular occasion, I forgot to say Gluten Free.

I get the pizza, and an overwhelming sense of embarrassment washed over me as I asked sheepishly ""I forgot to say gluten free, didn't I?""

I apologized and ordered a gluten free pizza after and explained I would just pay for the pizza so my roommate can have it and it doesn't go to waste and my server doesn't have to take the hit.

She took it off the bill, boxed it up, fed me lots of water to nurse my hangover, and made me feel less of an idiot for forgetting how to order my own food.

I left her a tip in the amount that the pizza normally costs after tax and tip. She did serve it to me, she did box it up for me, and if I could have eaten it, it would have been perfect.

She went above and beyond for me tonight, and I can't thank her enough.

I believe her name was Taylor, as well. Like I said, I cannot brain today. I has the dumb. And a hangover.",9oepw8KxX8BBXDLFE-u77w,1,1,5,Tc70mUHTfg2RDO2OB0X2oQ

Upon walking in, I almost felt as if my girlfriend and I were a bit underdressed. The decorations here are top notch and you immediately feel warm and welcome once you're inside. The host was extremely nice and asked us our seating preference before bringing us to our table. He also reassured us that were dressed appropriately as they aim to bring an ""upscale casual"" dining experience.

Our waiter came by shortly after we were seated and took our drink orders of water and Blue Moons. We were partial to the tapas because they all looked awesome. He let us know that they were definitely worth a try but told us we need to come by again during happy hour where Tapas are half off and beers are $2 off. We were disappointed that we missed it by no more than an hour but ordered them anyway.

While heading for the bathroom, I saw that there was a basketball game on at the bar. It's NBA finals so I couldn't miss it. When I saw the waiter come by I asked him if he minded us catching the end of the game at the bar instead and he agreed and moved our stuff from the table to the bar.

Sitting by the bar was actually an excellent choice because we were able to watch the kitchen as they worked on our food. We ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, Pork Dumplings, Crispy Tofu, Crab & Shrimp Dip, and Mini Duck Tacos.

ALL OF THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT. The mac and cheese was packed with flavor and each bite of crab was fantastic. The pork dumplings came with a great sauce that added just the right amount of punch to it, but the dumplings actually held their own without sauce. The crispy tofu was only lightly breaded, and was a large portion than imagined (Would cost only $4 on happy hour), the crab & shrimp dip was to die for and came with well seasoned Pita bread. There was actually so much dip that we ran out of bread and weren't even halfway through, so we shared the bowl...delicious. Then the mini duck tacos were piled with massive amounts of feta cheese and packed with a good amount of meat. Our only complain with them is that we dusted them off pretty quickly and would've of loved to have more.

The staff managed to hang out with us, rant and rave about the basketball game, and still maintain fantastic service. It was effortless, almost like we were all just hanging out. I loved every second of it. We got the bill, it was a little under $75 for 5 tapas and 4 (bottled) Blue Moons. We would've been around $40 had we come during happy hour. (5 tapas is also A LOT of food for a couple).

Ask Jamie the bartender for recommendations based upon your health issues or palate preferences, and he'll be happy to help you out.

I ordered the Oak roasted salmon filet. It was cooked perfectly which I give them credit for however it was sitting a top an ""Asian edemame salad"" which was swimming in a pool of ponzu sauce. The Ponzu flavor just completely overpowered the dish. They should call it Ponzu soup with some edemame. Ruined the dish for me.

Atmoshpere was great and the Customer Service was ok... cannot say much about the Pizza as I just couldn't bring myself to paying $12 for a personal sized pizza.. My impression is that they are trying to cover the cost of the decor by charging rediculous prices for dough, sauce and toppings...

We decided to go to Sammy's and I was pleasantly suprised at the outside seating area. Unfortunately, I get cold easily so I stayed inside. However, there is a nice little fire going with booths and tables surrounding it. 

I opted for the Tuscan pizza while my bf chose the New York. I secretly liked his better and was jealous that I didn't chose that one. But we share so I did get a piece of the pie. 

I choose Tuscan because of the arugula and prosciutto. I know prosciutto is salty but it didn't seem to fare well on my pizza. Plus, I didn't know that it was fresh arugula on my pizza... It was a suprise. But I ate the pizza with no complaints...

However my friends.... the NEW YORK pizza was delicious.  MEAT! MEAT! MEAT! Could have had more salami but I guess all good things in moderation.

I wanted pizza and was happy they offered GF crust and Vegan cheese. The waitress was very helpful in making sure I was making choices to fit my allergies. Once the order was placed the manager came over to let me know they already had some ""specialty"" pizzas in the oven and my food would come out before the rest of the tables as to not cross contaminate with the gluten food. I was so pleased that they were tentative to my allergies and did all they could to handle my food with care. 

The food was delicious and didn't taste any less than what a normal pizza tastes like. I had a fresh salad and had them hold the mozzarella. The dressing was balsamic so no worries in the GF department. 

The rest of the table (who has no allergies) had normal items from the menu and raved about how good they were. The 5 cheese pizza was a hit and so was the BBQ Pizza. Everyone was very pleased with the service and the quality of food. 

For my Vegan/GF/Vegetarian friends- you will be pleased with the menu options and the taste behind them all. After eating here I did not experience any reactions so it is safe. As always please let them know so they will handle your food with care.

It was explained to the waiter that I have a reaction to jalapenos and they should be left out.  My son ordered the same item, with jalapenos. While washing my hands, the orders arrived at our table, delivered by a female runner. She specifically stated that my plate had no jalapenos. After tasting the item. it tasted spicy. My son stated the runner said my order had no jalapenos. So I began eating the food. I was not able to finish even 1/2 of it. They had mixed up the orders in the kitchen. After leaving the restaurant, I became extremely ill in a grocery store. My family drove me home. After being in bed for 2 days, I went to the ER. There they discovered the jalapeno peppers caused an effect called Severe Colitis brought on by the jalapeno peppers. They also discovered I had IBD, which I was unaware of at the time. 
To sum things up, Sammy's corporate office did nothing after I asked to be compensated for their error. The regional chef admitted that it was an error in the kitchen and an error in the recipe. Still, they did not even offer to compensate me for our bill, much less my ER and additional expenses. I was sent 3-$25 gift certificates as compensation and an apology. If someone with a more extensive form of the illness had eaten this item, they could have died. 
Please use care when ordering any menu items and reconsider ordering anything with an ingredient that does not agree with you or that you are definitely allergic. They do not show any concern. You will be on your own.  I myself will not be eating at any Sammy's again. Plus, they use paper napkins. The prices are not economical. For $20 per person, plus tip, you should at least receive a cloth napkin.
Update:
The legal department handled my complaint. They ended up paying for the ER and doctor bills. Would not reimburse me for the MRI.",JlgmY4LWRVJMwmFnd-O_CA,0,0,1,sRgzKe1au6n1jyrvJysleQ

I have been going to Sammy's for years now and I am always pleased after each meal.  I really like this particular location.  It usually isn't super packed and I have never had to wait for a table.  The service is always really good and friendly.  

And the pizzas, oh the pizzas!  I am absolutely in love with the 5 cheese pizza.  I have an ongoing love affair with cheese, so I of course had to try this pizza the very first time I went to a Sammy's location all those years ago.  It has been about 5 years now and I am still ordering the amazingly delicious 5 funky cheese pizza.  I mean it has smoked gouda, raclette, romano, mozzarella, and gorgonzola...what isn't to like?  My second favorite is the Goat Cheese Pizza with it's lovely spinach and sautéed mushrooms, it is simply a thing of beauty.   If funky pizzas aren't your thing, they also have the ""normal"" pizzas like pepperoni that are also delightful.  Yum.

On top of the pizzas, they also have a huge menu of salads, pastas, wraps, and steak.  I am also rather found of their tapas and appetizers like duck tacos, hummus, dumplings, satays, and lobster mac n' cheese.  Everything I have tried has been awesome.  It is so fun to be able to get a little bit of Asian, Mediterranean, Italian, and American comfort foods all in one setting.  This is the beauty of America, our great melting pot of wonderful food!  This is also why I am not a size 2, I love food wayyyyyyy to much.

And the perfect way to end a meal is Sammy's Messy Sundae.  It truly is a hot mess, but oh so good!  It will make anyone happy with the chocolate, caramel, whipped cream, and ice cream.  Oh la la!  It does come with nuts though, so if you are anti-nut, order it without the nuts.  I actually think it is better sans nuts myself.

The occasion tonight was for a ""milestone"" birthday party for a friend, and we were able to order whatever we wanted. 

There were about 16 of us, and we were seated at two adjacent tables.  If that was the restaurant's decision, I applaud it, since it broke up that awful big-party long table that has some people invariably stuck, with no way to exit.  We had just one server who worked her butt off, but never once lost her cool or made us wait for anything.  I wish I knew her name, but never did get it.  

Since this dinner party was called for 5:00 pm, which for us is really a late lunch (!), we weren't all that hungry.  Besides, we had an Oscar party to go to later, and expected to be able to nosh there, too.  So hubby and I shared the Mini Duck Taco appetizer, which is fantastic, and our mainstay Thai Chicken Salad.  The salad seemed bigger than usual, and was its customary delicious combination of romaine, shredded zucchini, chopped tomatoes, peanuts, and other goodies, complemented by a slightly spicy dressing that we get on the side.  We had enough left over to share as a side salad the next night.  My one complaint was that the chicken was overcooked and way too dry, but overall, this is a winning dish that we order over and over again.

All in all, this Sammy's is not unlike all the other Sammy's, and the terrific service made for a very pleasant experience.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,3,4,agnV2t3Q7ofNVXADXvw1IQ

     This used to be a place where me and my girlfriend would go 3-4 times a week but in the past several weeks they've mutilated it (I meant renovated). The vintage Thomas Edison fixture is outdated and the booths were once smooth and comfortable. Now they're fabric which is a huge business mistake since kids will destroy them in months to come. Where are the bar stools? How do I watch football!? What a waste of money. Put the funding into marketing rather than taking the restaurant backwards into the 70's. Come on Sammy! Why ruin a good thing? You have 25 other locations. I know you're a smart guy but whoever hired your interior designer needs a reality check. You should've hired Gordon Ramsay or Jon Taffer, not David Bromstad from HGTV. The color scheme is dull and boring. Might as well change the name to ""Sammy's Woodfired Funhouse."" I didn't know this would be the new set for the upcoming Smurfs movie. How does this bring in revenue? How does this put people in the booths (well, you took the one out where we used to sit so it doesn't matter. We'll sit on the newly built countertop instead; bad business decision). Fix the water spot in the ceiling above the thermostat first, then worry about the ridiculous phony flower boxes with LED lighting that serve no purpose. And the new TV's? They were installed a bit slanted. But that's not important because who watches TV, right?

Other than the food and the staff, we won't be going back. The employees always make us feel special. They're attentive, hardworking, fun, and professional. We've never had a horrible meal. The duck tacos are the best.  I've been in Vegas since 1990, and the Sahara location was my place for business meetings and this location was for the family. But seeing where Sammy is going with it, I'm going somewhere else. Check please!

- A relaxing place for happy hour (4-6)! 
- Drinks, $2 OFF; Tapas, Half Price; Excellent Service.

OUR HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE:
- My wife and I had an enjoyable happy hour experience at Sammy's yesterday evening (Monday) over delicious food and drinks! 

- For drinks, we had Cab ($5/glass), which was pretty good. For Tapas, we had: (1) Mini Duck Tacos ($5.25), flavorful and great presentation; (2) Garlic Cheese Flat Bread ($3.50), tasty, good texture; (3) Lettuce Cups ($5), deliciously flavored finely diced chicken meat filling (though a bit too salty), with butter lettuce leaves for wraps!  They all tasted heavenly! 

- The service was outstanding! Our young lady waitress, Samantha, was extremely friendly and efficient! By the way, we got in the restaurant just 10min before the the happy hour was over. Samantha made sure that our drink and food orders went in promptly, and assured us that our second drinks would be at happy hour price, too. She was attentive, always keeping an eye on tables she served. - A great waitress, indeed! In fact, some guests came in a few min AFTER 6, and Samantha was still able to get them the HH prices! This is a good restaurant practice, also. Customers would appreciate that!

We will definitely go back to Sammy's, and try out other dishes on the menu! 

THE RESTAURANT DECOR & AMBIENCE:
- This Sammy's is in the large Grand Montecito Plaza; at the corner of the circular court yard. At the entrance is the bar area with an inviting bar counter and several bar tables. Both wings of the bar are 2 nice dining rooms. It also has an attractive medium size patio seating area by the court yard. One can enjoy HH anywhere in the restaurant. The windows along the entire front wall privides a pleasant view of the court yard. This restaurant has a relaxing ambience.

It's perfect, a little spicy and so tasty! And we love their homemade pickles. We have tried to make them ourselves but gave up when we couldn't figure it out. The prices are really reasonable too. In the summer we can arrive early enough to get half price tapas and in the winter I wait until I get their 20% off coupon. For what we order, it works out about the same.

One note I wanted to put is that I had the Lebni cheese tonight. I like their flatbread and I like soft cheeses and Mediterranean spices... they put a spice mix on the cheese and all over the bread. I shook the bread and a lot of spices fell off so I would maybe recommend to just get spices on the cheese and tell them to skip the bread since apparently it is the norm to throw on that much spice mix. They replaced it with a new one right away. 

Got some duck tacos which are always good. Braised asparagus with Romano shavings, balsamic and prosciutto- perfectly cooked veggie. I eat a lot of ""real"" Italian food and this is something we definitely would have at dinner since it's clean fresh, simply done flavors.

The menu items were more expensive than I'd anticipated ($6 for fries). The hubs and I both ordered pizzas at $11.75 each. I was happy to learn that the pizzas were more than enough for 1 person. Neither of us finished our pizzas and we each took home two slices for leftovers. The pesto pizza I ordered was loaded with cheese and tasted great. The pizzas were oily but I didn't mind one bit. 

Service was okay. We used a coupon from the Entertainment Book for Las Vegas and scored $9 off, so for two people the bill came to around $20. I would come back to Sammy's- I hear their happy hour is pretty epic.",U-nR7ND8CDN2x8ia73CH2Q,0,0,4,y8fpl5pVZ0ybM5TfC5eEMg

I've ventured here with the family on more than one occasion and have never been disappointed. The last time I visited we had a rather large group and aside from some timing issues on delivering the entrees and the appetizers we all enjoyed it. They have a huge selection of appetizers ranging from duck tacos to coconut shrimp. It's all delicious! My personal favorite is the garlic cheese bread, which is simply a cut up cheese pizza without sauce. It is cheesy yummy goodness! The brie cheese pizza was tasty but spicy! I let my Mom try it and it burned her mouth. The waitress said that it's the oil that they coat the dough with prior to putting on the topping. I have tasted several other of the pizzas and all were delicious. The beet salad is also a fave. My girls like to eat the huge ice cream sundae. Not only is it huge, it is an undertaking fitting of 3 or more appetites. I'm not a huge dessert eater but the Sunday is a chocolate gooey masterpiece of indulgence that I just can't pass up!

5505191,2013-04-27,0,K5Ex8diP6rIh8P16D8KHVA,"UPDATE! Since I've written this review (2010 incidentally...just recently dug it up and posted it, I'm sure a lot has changed since) Sammy's has changed the Fish Tacos to a tempting Grilled Hawaiian Ono served with a Chipotle Aioli Sauce. I'm sure any negative elements of my experience have long since been addressed. 

Here's my previous review. I'll update it as soon as I return! Thanks to General Manager Jay Hartwig for his quick insights!

The Review: So it was Mother's Day and due to some illness with the kids, we decided to order out for some fancy foodstuffs. We finally decided that maybe we'd give Sammy's another shot after writing them off several years ago due to not being too impressed with our experience.

After perusing the website (the kind of website with annoying music that doesn't give you an option to turn it off) we were excited to discover that Sammy's had FISH TACOS! Specifically Mahi Mahi tacos. Described as follows: Crispy Mahi Mahi Tacos with creamy tomato cilantro dressing, lime, guacamole and salsa with your choice of flour or corn tortillas.

Well I couldn't pass up this opportunity to further my explorations of the plane of existence that only fish tacos are privileged to permanently inhabit. But I digress. Let me tell you about my experience...

So after getting a busy signal a few times, I was finally lucky enough to get through only to wait about fifteen rings while worrying that they might be closed on Sunday following in the footsteps of their fellow local eateries. Upon eventually answering the phone, I was quick to order 2 orders of the Mahi tacos to go. My mind reeled momentarily when they asked if I wanted flour or corn, as this was a to-go order and I am no stranger to the short life span of a corn tortilla, when combined with fish and other assorted edibles. Yet I had to see....I had to know... so 2 corn and 2 flour, if you please. I was then asked if I wanted coleslaw or french fries with those. I know, right? Not exactly what I expected to hear, and honestly sent a sliver of dread up my spine for fear of my making a huge mistake. I then continued with ordering a couple more things off of the menu irrelevant to my literary endeavor, was told it would be ready in twenty minutes and bid adieu.

Twenty minutes later, I find myself looking for a place to park. Fast forward to standing in the bustling lobby, anxiously awaiting my wife's beet and arugula salad while my fish tacos (2 on corn tortillas) threaten to decompose by the minute in the huge clear plastic container that they mock me from. Salad's here! See ya....time to haul my ass home!

Aside from the environmentally catastrophic presentation, these things looked pretty good. It was also obvious that these were, for the most part, of the ""Do It Yourself"" variety. Fair enough. If they put salsa and guacamole in there and no chips to speak of, then apparently the condiments are intended for the tacos themselves. I felt inclined to oblige. I did notice something was missing though. The advertised ""creamy tomato cilantro dressing"". Bummer. I was somewhat looking forward to what they might have had to offer in that category. Needless to say, this posed a situation for the fish. Because now there was no hiding under some fancy sauce.

I started with the corn tortilla taco first, due to the fact that the disintegration had already begun and because I didn't want to be forced to use a fork (For a taco? Bastards. Never.)

Every bite of this particular taco was delicious yet awkward. The corn tortilla barely made it. I found it hard to focus on the particulars of this one due to all my thought processes going to keeping that thing together. On to the flour tortilla taco...

Guacamole, pico de gallo, red cabbage, a squeeze of a juicy lime, a crunchy perfectly cooked piece of Mahi Mahi and a not too crispy, not too soggy flour tortilla equaled easy to handle deliciousness in every bite.

Well done Sammy's, well done.

Although how can I rate this first experience with this establishment's fish tacos when an apparent crucial ingredient, that was so proudly included in it's description, was neglected to be added to these tacos at all? I believe I have to review these again, which I don't think I'd mind. Although with being so impressed with the sauce-less tacos, how will I enjoy them when they do decide to add sauce? Will the sauce ruin them? Or will they just take those things to the next level? I'm not sure I like being in this position. Either way, part 2 of Sammy's will most likely be shorter.

I would definitely recommend these for the people who like a fish taco with breaded fish. The corn tortillas would be sublime for dine-in, but for take-out I would recommended the flour. Actually, I don't think I'll ever order corn tortillas again for my fish tacos if I'm ordering to-go from anywhere. 

3 thumbs up for the sauce less version...",viUALw9twPV-z-oinumyJQ,1,1,3,NfMNoLHwMPyG0TMA2NZHug
