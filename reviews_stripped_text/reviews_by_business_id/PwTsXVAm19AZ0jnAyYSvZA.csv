And I am from New England. But as we do, we always give restaurnts 2 trys to make sure that it wasn't an off service. We visited this weekend and it was worse that we expected. Lunch time and no one in the restaurant. The fried scallops were cold and fried in oil that needed filtering. The boiled shrimp were very small and fishy smelling. Both of these apps. were served on chopped pieces of wilted lettuce. But with a lovely novelity cut lemon wedge. They would be much better served spending time preparing good food and less time making carved lemon wedges. We had lobster salad rolls.Chewy pieces of lobster and an odd taste. We both got through about 1/2 a roll and could go no further. We got about 20 mins away from the restaurant  we both began to get ill. We both stayed ill for a day. It has been years since I have had food poisioning but once you have had it, you do not want it again I can assure you. We naturally will not be returning but we are so shocked by the positve reviews. Where did these people eat?",XGcFom5Iaioe3Z_hMEFv4g,0,0,1,K1rpmXCaScq_gPVKS6FT5w

You don't have to pay exorbitant amounts of money to enjoy some seafood, lobster in particular. The tables are covered with red and white checkered picnic table cloths and they serve drinks in Styrofoam cups. That was okay with me, because I wasn't looking for anything fancy. I just wanted some good food.

The food was not good. It was amazing! I had the lobster mac n cheese, and my bf had the chicken parm. This mac n cheese was probably the best restaurant mac n cheese I've ever had. I usually think restaurant mac n cheese is sub par to homemade. It tends to be dry and flavorless. No, this mac n cheese was made with Gouda and other types of cheese making it incredibly creamy and flavorful. I could not get enough of it. They did not skimp on the lobster either. My dish was filled with a large amount of delicious chunks of sweet, tender lobster. My bf also liked his chicken parm. It was flavorful and was a huge portion. The prices were also very good. I think we each paid about $15. They have super cheap sandwiches for about $5 if seafood isn't your thing.

The service was wonderful too. Our waiter was friendly and constantly made sure we had enough soda to wash down our food with. We were impressed and will be returning.",6J19mNkzWwdXZiL74tmhfA,0,0,5,0nXklpE7Eh5ePkYd0VNxKQ

Crinkle cut fries reminded me of, uh, yeah, crinkle cut fries that I had as a child.  Har! har!  Actually, the fries were better because as a child, the crinkle fries were always soggy.  These fries were crisp outside and fluffy in the middle.

Sad to say the U Conn roll I ate was was OK.  The bun was toasted right but the lobster was overcooked.  There was a fair amount of lobster meat but it was tough and dry.  All that needed to be done was to cook the lobster correctly.  

Unfortunately, I left still craving lobster but that was satisfied another day during my stay in Vegas.  Which will be in another review.

Noticed the mixed reviews but the gf was Hankering for a lobster roll and my go to spot is  closed-on Sunday.

We got :

Lobster bisque - $4.99
Lobster roll - $16
Lobster salad roll - $8
Lobster Mac and cheese - $16

The good -  service was good ( contrary to what I've read ) - pleasant server, timely , food was hot . The lobster roll was decent but why in a tortilla and it might be a little pricey for the amount of meat.

The average - bisque had decent flavor, a little on the thick side .  Mac n cheese - started out very average but it's actually much better later when the sauce hardens a little and the flavors meld.

The bad - not necessarily bad , let's say below avg - the lobster salad roll - not much lobster flavor going on here 

They have various seafood options that might be worth a try - will I come back ? Yeah - I'll give it another shot

1944669,2011-07-18,0,PwTsXVAm19AZ0jnAyYSvZA,"So, we went  to Monstah Lobstah for lunch last week.  We had been there before and the food is pretty ok, although the service isn't anything to write home about.  When we walked in the door, we noticed a sign saying that they were no longer accepting Restaurant.com coupons.  They claimed that they had asked the site to remove them from their list, and therefore it was ""fraud.""  I told the manager that the only reason we even kept coming back was because we had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com and that we would no way pay full price for their food.

So, on to the food.  The Lobster dinner is a pretty good deal at $20.  However, the lobster tends to be a little rubbery, and the baked potato has been consistently undercooked.  The seafood stew is pretty good, but trying to find the chunks of seafood can be hit and miss.  We tried the uconn roll, and while it is pretty good, I pretty sure that it doesn't contain the 1/4 lb. of meat that it promises.

The service at Monstah Lobstah is pretty bad.  The wait staff doesn't seem to know the menu very well and when asked for suggestions, the waiter couldn't give us one.  The decor is severely lacking as well.  We were sat near a window that had the hot sun blazing on us, and were told that there was nothing they could do about it.  

Overall, this place is pretty mediocre.  The only reason we kept going back was because we had a coupon from Restaurant.com.  Now that they are no longer accepting the coupons, we probably won't return.",wl6-U579cy32ZrJbOEaPcw,2,0,2,hTV71qFRfPOt1jTa5ZQ9ZA

Come here on Mondays. 2 for 1 lobstah salad roll w/ fries and a soda are only $10 and some change.  Compared to their 1 lobstah salad roll w/ fries for about $8 this is a deal. 

Call ahead worth it especially if what you're ordering something that suppose to be cold or warm, or if you already know what you want or if you're in a hurry. If you're not in a hurry I probably wouldn't worry about calling ahead.  Calling ahead is always basic if your trying to dine in a hurry.

Doing these things made my overall experience much better.  Calling ahead was actually suggested by the lady who worked there, possibly owner!?

So most recently we came there with a party of 7, when we got there they were almost ready for us.  They brought out the tray full of 12 lobstah salad roll and 7 fries.  The other 2 came out later but everything was excellent. Left full with lobstah salad rolls and fries. Good times.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,4,0,4,t9d6awoJl_eltbkIsUXtTQ

I have never had a lobster so large, but it was perfectly cooked and delicious. The kids fish stick was actually a large piece of sliced fish, which was great. No yucky minced up crap. Was a bit dissapointed that they didnt have any of their chocolate cake for the dessert, but they did have complimentary champagne, which was sweet. 

They pushed the tables together for our group, and having the kids in a relaxed atmosphere was relieving.  I hope they can get some more staff quickly for holidays. And make sure your wait staff knows what is out of stock for the day in advance. But the staff is so sweet and genuine, one can hardly be upset at them.

3323164,2011-06-06,0,PwTsXVAm19AZ0jnAyYSvZA,"I'm giving this place 3.5 stars.  This was my third visit.  The first two were NOT good, but I bought a Groupon to try it once more and was pleasantly surprised on try number three.  I had the Lobstah Mac and Cheese.  The mac and cheese on it's own was nice and creamy with a lovely light panko bread crumb crust on the top.  There was just enough decent size lobster chunks to go around, nothing crazy, but not stingy either.  

I am still bothered by the lack of clientele during my three visits even though they were all at peak lunch or dinner times.  When I arrived the counter guy was helping someone who was picking up an order and I stood there for several minutes before he acknowledged me and told me to sit anywhere (in the empty restaurant) and pointed to where the menus were and said I should grab one.  Another party of three people arrived while I was seated and the counter guy was STILL helping the pick-up person and did not acknowledge them either.  They finally seated themselves.  Service is not attentive for the fact that practically NO ONE was in there on all three of my visits.  

I would like to go back for the Lobstah Mac and Cheese again and possibly to try the fried whole belly clams, but am hesitant for the service and the fact that my fiance had generic frozen fried shrimp on our last visit.  ""shrug""  They REALLY need to step it up to compete in this town.

3324111,2011-03-16,1,PwTsXVAm19AZ0jnAyYSvZA,"Horrible!! Six of us went out for dinner, we got soup, salad, 3 lobster dinnahs, the samplah, mozzerella sticks for the kiddos and mac & cheese.  

Of course the soups, salads and the girls' food came out first.  I liked how they put little blueberries on the salads and the mozzerella sticks were pretty generic.  The soup came out cold so it had to be sent back to be reheated.  Our friends' daughter didn't like the mac & cheese so we went to send it back.  The waitress came over and said ""Well, it's homemade.""  Aside from it being a very rude comment, who cares if it's homemade if she doesn't like it?!  

All 3 of the lobster dinnahs were cold so they had to send it back as well to be reheated.  They must cook a bunch of lobster all at once and then reheat them, which doesn't do anything for the taste or the tenderness of the meat.  It didn't taste very good in the first place and it was even worse when it came back out - I couldn't eat it at all. 

No wonder this place was dead when we walked in - blatantly rude staff, cold, tasteless food...  I will NEVER make the mistake of coming here again!

I ordered the crab dinnah. The crab legs were cooked very well and seasoned with Old Bay. Perfect-o! I would def reccomend and get again. My boyfriend got the lobster bisque served in a bread bowl. Bisque was easily a 4 out of 5 and the bread was super yummy. Total for food would be a 4-5 out of 5.

The service... sucked! The waiter at the other table seemed to be very friendly and talked with his tables. Our had less personality than a brick. After he brought our food, it took less than a minute for him to ask how our food was. Uh let us get a taste before you ask. After that, we didn't see him again until he came to get a plate. My drink we empty and didn't get refilled, which I drink a ton. Luckily, I always have back up in my purse. Even after walking passed our table with more dirty plates, clearly not being eaten off of, and seeing me drink out of a reusable water bottle, he didn't take any other plates or offer refills. At this point, a man had walked in and helped him self to drink and went back an forth from the kitchen to the counter. After 10 minutes of waiting and looking for someone to flag down since our waiter was MIA, I went to this new person who walked in assuming they worked there and asked for our waiter to bring our check. When our waiter appeared, no apology and didnt ask if we needed anything else. Just grabbed plates and left our check on the table. If it wasn't for the service, we would definitely be back and I would give this place a better rating. Too bad we didn't get the friendly waiter...

OK, I actually ate there a day or two prior, but it was close enough. This outpost of Monstah Lobstah is located inside Doc Holliday's and as you would expect there's plenty of Boston memoribilia around the room, along with red/white checkered tablecloths, wooden seats and booths that give it that New England feel.

I went with their UConn roll ($17.99, although their web site says it's $16.99), which was filled with a 1 1/4 lb lobster-worth of meat in a toasted hot dog-like bun with lettuce. It was lightly dressed with butter but was a little dry. It could have benefitted from having a side of clarified butter that I could apply as needed (quite the opposite experience of my roll at Rocco's).

For those looking for a roll where the lobster is in a mayo-based mix with celery, green onions, etc. they have a lobster salad roll for $7.99.

My UConn roll was pretty good, but not as amazing as I had hoped. Not a big fan of the crinkle cut fries either. The value is decent for the amount of meat you get, but I'm not sure I'd get it again.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,1,3,GXGNOqOmAjzgOkJiaRubOw

There are two locations in town: one in Anthem and one on Eastern and Serene. We had some trouble finding the one on Serene because it is inside Doc Holliday's and there isn't a lot of light. It is a lot bigger than it appears from the outside. 

I started with a cup of seafood chowder. It had potential because it was flavorful but it was served lukewarm and it wasn't as thick as I'd like. I ordered the U Conn Roll which was full of succulent lobster inside a warm roll. It came with a side of fries. My husband ordered the lobster mac and cheese and it was disappointing.

We walked into the restaurant on a Sunday evening and because it shares an entrance with Doc Hollidays (separated by another door), you will get attack with the cigarette smoke smell.  Once inside, it looks quite cheesy, with red and white checkered table cloths.  This place was empty!  Bad sign.

So after we got seated, the person who attended to us was quite a good seller.  However, we stuck with the basics.  Two lobster of 2.5 lb each, 1lb of clams, and I ordered the U-Conn Roll because I've read good reviews for it, even from reviewers that had given it one star.

Steamed clams - I have to peel off this outer layer of the end piece so that I won't be eating dirt.  It comes with a small bowl of clam juice/broth, but it didn't add much flavor for me.  I put some salt and pepper on a small dish, squeeze some lemon in it, and that was the accompanying sauce for the clams.  That brought out some flavor, and I enjoyed it.

The U conn roll was ok.  I liked the fat fries that were next to the roll, absorbing some of that buttah and they were GOOD.  How can anything w/butter be bad?!?  The lobster roll on the other hand was alright.  But, it was probably just me...I am not a fan of lobster.

The lobsters that the guys order were ok.  They had mentioned that those lobsters tasted as if though they have been boiled the life out of them.  Would have tasted better if they were steamed.

I had the 7.99 lobster salad wrap, and the Lobstah Bisque. If you're looking for a less messy meal definitely do the wrap. The roll isn't really a roll but more of like a a big bruschetta concept with ONE piece of toast and then the salad on top. Which kind of turned me off since I think they were going for an appealling look rather than better eating ingenuity. I think the roll would be awesome with TWO pieces of toast for the sandwich. Definitely a light and soft taste of the salad, but very filling due to the lobster chunks and mayo. My favorite is the bisque. Tangy with an awesome kick to the taste with a lot of big lobster chunks! Yes! 5 stars for the bisque for me.

The service was good, not great. He did fail to add in our utensils into the bag, and silly me to check it after we left. So we had no spoon, napkins, or ketchup in our to go bag which I though was like was second nature for them to do. The guy was funny and witty, and definitely passionate about the food there seeming slightly offended by the partial yelp reviews he's read. lol But, I will say he let me keep the ketchup bottle since I asked for ketchup to go which I thought was nice and funny since he didn't want me waiting. So he makes up for the service with the ketchup bottle.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,1,0,4,okjGUeUG60QA4dnruBgKtw

Everything was very tasty and cook about right except for the Steamers my cousin got seemed a little too raw for my liking so I ditched them to avoid any chance of stomach problems. Service was a little slow since it was a Monday and there was only like 2 employees which I could see was forgivable.

The lobster was cooked perfect and tasted awesome! 

I followed it up with a cup of lobster bisque creamy and hot loved it!

Stole a hush puppy from my friend and it was awesome too, also got to try the lobster quesadilla, everything we tried was great.

I would recommend this place anytime 
and to those who say the sandwich didn't have a pound and fourth of lobster should know lobster is sold and weighed IN THE SHELL so that adds to it just FYI",2Ntz89vaNAt_8fbJCeb3fg,0,0,4,XsetdG9Wb18iEHU_j5K2LA

Despite what other reviews said we decided to give this place a shot.

The food was good. We have the chowder and bisque, both we piping hot, and yummy. Chowder was thinner that I prefer though.

I had the U-Conn Roll, which was LOADED with big chunks of lobster. It really curbed the craving that I have been having. My fiance had the lobster pasta. He said it was delicious, and would definitely order it again.

I ready some awful things about the service, and I seriously have nothing to complain about. Out waitress was really nice and quite attentive. The restaraunt was slow, so there was no fighting to get her attention. 

Next time I have a hankering for a lobster roll, I will definitely head to Monstah Lobstah.",yHej125HqvQGHNvKnjiekg,2,0,3,LsghbAquPk7F2lpVbo_63A

5121094,2011-08-31,1,PwTsXVAm19AZ0jnAyYSvZA,"Ok Ok Ok... I'm reading the rest of these reviews and everyone needs to calm down. I grew up in Marblehead, Massachusetts...I worked on lobster boats and have been to countless lobster shacks on the East Coast. I think some of the reviews are a tad picky. Here's the good bad & ugly from my point of view. 

The Good - 
We are in the middle of the Nevada desert and I was sitting in a restaurant eating fresh steamers and a lobster roll with all authentic ingredients. That alone is amazing. The waitress told me they fly in the rolls, the fries, the clams...I would normally say that the prices were a tad steep but it's got to be expensive and a gigantic pain in the ass to coordinate all that importing. My family had steamers that were FRESH. I had the uConn roll which was very filling. The roll tasted like home, the fries reminded me of my elementary school cafeteria (good thing) and the lobster was spilling out of this thing...delicious. I will say that the lobster was just a smidge dry but hey, still great. My mom had fried clams that melted in your mouth and my wife had the Lobster Grilled Cheese... to say she loved it is an understatement...I actually heard moaning. 

You have to appreciate the effort and authenticity of this joint. The lobsters are in a tank so you know it's not canned or some frozen dead stuff before it arrived on your plate. Most East Coast places (not the tourist crap) are shacks by the water with no frills...Monstah Lobstah is a fair representation. 

I also saw some comments regarding service. The server we had was super nice and answered all of my obnoxious questions...then again, we were the only group in the place. 

The Bad - 
Lobster bisque was a little on the dull side... sorry but it was. I was a little put off by all the Styrofoam as well...get some glasses! 

The Ugly - 
It's attached to a Doc Holiday's...smoke filled nasty bar with that faint (people are getting lung cancer nearby) smell. Not pleasant when you are eating. I also gotta say that the lack of signage and location are big problems...you better be doing some serious marketing to counteract the bad location and nonexistent visibility. 

All in all... I'm a fan and will be back. I can't get anything close to this in Vegas and I'm excited that I found my new lobstah haven.",7rngkJ2lES5OthbMb4qe1Q,7,0,4,qmldZ7alwOmzQRrBDnPUqQ

5506898,2011-06-17,0,PwTsXVAm19AZ0jnAyYSvZA,"I had a very different experience here.  First of all, it is rare to find a place that serves a whole Maine lobster - and at a reasonable price.  Secondly, when you do find one, they tend to overcook the lobster, making it tough and rubbery.  Not here!  I had a 2 lb lobster, perfectly cooked and delicious.  I am tough to please so I'm not going to say that the entire experience was marvelous.  The place was packed when we went so there was a wait - no complaint here - it is what it is.  But the service was slow, wait staff didn't seem to understand that when you order coffee, you might want occasional refills.  The ambience is not great but who cares when you can get this much good food for so little?!",9s-lHcMIHo_Oodz33LE6gw,0,0,4,7J1SI5mc_SAP4aa9ujL2VA
5550048,2011-08-31,1,PwTsXVAm19AZ0jnAyYSvZA,"Having been to the Anthem location, I came here with the husband for lunch to try the closer restaurant to the 215 freeway.  The food is wonderful at this location, like Anthem.  We had the following:

Lobster Tacos - for only 10 bucks you get three really huge REAL lobster meat tacos in flour tortillas, with just a little salsa and fresh romaine lettuce.  I couldn't finish all of this, because oddly, it came with a huge helping of fries too.  I thought it was weird until I tasted the fries - holy crap they were really good.

Chicken Parm - yes my husband ordered chicken parm in a seafood joint.   He does not eat seafood.  But what is so surprising was how really well cooked and juicy the dish was.  He claimed that the chicken parm was better here than any of the Italian restaurants in town we have been to.

As others have said, the downside is that it is attached to a really smoke filled tavern - Doc Holiday's.  As opposed to the Anthem location, they do not do a good job in ventilating the place.  This is the only reason why I am docking them a star, and I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.

The service was good - no complaints but I do prefer the Anthem location overall, and would go there before here.  However my husband enjoys the pizza, and this is the only location between the two that serves pizza.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,3,4,G0eqAXWr2-s11J75mL-PWA
5586803,2012-04-11,0,PwTsXVAm19AZ0jnAyYSvZA,"I don't know what happened, but AYCE Tuesdays are a bust for our crab-hungry group of friends. This makes me more than sad as it was a whole experience: food, drinks, environment, service... it all made for good times and a great meal. Tuesdays were our thing (as you can see from my last review). 

Sadly, I haven't had a great meal here in a very long time.

I have done my ""Feeling Crabby Tuesday"" maybe... twice?... in the past couple of months: the crab is coming out with soft shells, it's over-salted, and it's just not as tasty as it once was. Sure, once in a while it would happen in the past, we would note it and point it out, and then all was well. Unfortunately it has become more the rule than the exception. 

I said a while ago that I was done but then a couple weeks ago I had a yen for it. I convinced a girlfriend to go with me and.... no. Just... no. The crab was salty and soft-shelled (not the good kind) and just didn't live up to the previous amazingness that was the Tuesday siren-song for our seafood loving mates.

The bisque has also made me sad. The general flavor profile is still mostly good and, depending on your server, loaded with real lobster. But I have been able to see and taste the cornstarch (or other white powdery food thickener) in the soup the last two times I had it (in a bisque?!). Add to that the problem with the consistency being inconsistent? Ugh. One of my previous favorites, now off the list. 

I tried changing to the clam chowder on a few occasions but it's just OK. Not bad, but not great. I wouldn't go there if I was specifically looking for CC.

One of the servers doesn't have a TAM card. While he is personable and genuinely interested in making your stay with them a good one, it is inconvenient to have to leave your table to get drinks for you and your friends from the attached Doc Holliday's Saloon. At that point, you are becoming your own server. Not why I go to a sit-down place.

Some highlights do exist... I am not trying to burn an effigy. The two stars come from some really good points - just that they are unfortunately weighed down by the rest. :(

Service is usually fast, friendly, and they are pretty good about communicating with you when the kitchen is processing a lot (think AYCE on Tuesday, if they are busy and have 15+ orders at a time). Sometimes you have to wait a minute, but speed isn't usually a problem. 

The coleslaw is decent, as is the corn on the cob, the lobster salad, and the lobster escargot (buttery garlicy goodness!). The mac n' cheeses are rich and yummy (not my thing, but everyone I know who has tried them loves them). Everyone who eats them loves the fries, too!

I have had some of the Lobstah Dinnah and found the lobster to be sweet and tasty, if a little on the small side and just a tad salty but not overly so. It was definitely hot and fresh (we watched the little guy be picked from tank!).

----

Only once did I have an issue with the overall evening to the point I asked for a concession. It was the food, yes, but also the attitude of the server that put us over the top. In the interest of honesty and fairness: they split the bill with us and we promised to come back. We did! A few times. This is written after many dissatisfied visits. 

Sadly, I don't think there will be another one.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,4,1,2,ySaUDWpvFUMIxkwdM-pt-A

Our waitress Shawn brought out baked potatoes that were as brown inside as they were outside, the corn was old, the lobster was cold & rubery. My companion ordered the surf & turf, $24.99.

I thought the restaurant itself was ok - their blasting ac was a nice escape from the summer heat. Seats were really padded and super comfy. I thought it was cute that they had their condiment bottles in old 6pack carriers. 

I got the lobster salad roll for $7.99 I didn't expect too much for the price and it wasn't the best, but wasn't bad. The bread was good - perfectly buttered and toasted, he said they just started shipping the rolls in from I think maine? So like I said, they do care and they are trying. 

I love that they had crinkle fries, I'm sick of this whole shoestring fries thing so many places have going on. Crinkle fries remind me of elementary school lunch - the star of every craptastic meal. Also had the fried scallop appetizer $7 or $8 I can't remember. They were pretty good - a decent portion, hand breaded w panko. They may need to change their oil because it had a weird after-taste like old oil. 

I'm honestly not sure that I'll be back. They've been open long enough to work out the kinks, but the reviews are mostly the same - ok but not great when this is a place specializing in lobster.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,3,-O7wbrjsc7aQ725ZNRFYSw
