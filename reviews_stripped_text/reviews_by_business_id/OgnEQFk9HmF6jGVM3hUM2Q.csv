He's a f!@#$ing creep which is why I gave this place 2 stars. I'd gone here a number of times with my husband and have seen the creepy man, but he was always normal when my husband was with me. Well this particular day, I was alone. I just was ordering a big order for my family and I and the creepy tio took my order and rung me up. The WHOLE time, he gives me this creepy, pervy smile, no blinking, no words to me except thank you, and he was looking me up and down like I was a piece of meat. He just stood there at the register while I pretended to not notice his weird behavior. I sat down at the tables far away from him as possible and was pretending to look at my phone the whole time 'cause I just wanted my mf food.  Look, I'm just a fat chick  who was wearing MC Hammer pants and a loose t-shirt with some greasy ass hair. I just wanted some damn burritos. Could you fire this guy or tell him to grow up or something ya'll???

I drive to the Roberto's on Lake Mead where the cops always are instead now. I'd rather go to the ghetto Roberto's than see the old creepy old perv ever again.",O-qCegMPqzFL6BqWJBga0g,0,0,2,t_DC4YZUCEVdvtHpkhoafw

2494667,2017-06-23,0,OgnEQFk9HmF6jGVM3hUM2Q,"So this review is super late, but I couldn't just not give this place the love it deserves.  I went here last week Saturday during my weekend trip to Las Vegas. I was kind of nervous, because the location I went to is located inside a gas station, but my dad said it was really one of the best places to eat in Las Vegas. And boy, he was right!  I was pretty hungover from my previous night on the strip, so I ordered menudo. I was surprised by the huge size & the price ($6.95). It also came with flour or corn tortillas, cilantro & onion. I've never had menudo from a fast food restaurant, and I'm very impressed with how delicious it was. It was very meaty & had a good amount of hominy as well. It definitely helped with my massive hangover! LOL! 
The next morning, my sister & I went in again for breakfast burritos. We ordered the chorizo with egg, and added potatoes. They also came with red & green chile, which was pretty delicious as well. These burritos were MASSIVE, and we could've probably just split one between us. I could only finish about half of mine...They were seriously the size of Chipotle burritos! And delicious! I also loved that they had a drive-thru. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!",Ek6aM3cwbBiAHjsBWsKcZg,2,1,5,QYyEU9vRi4FoyXBZkZ6Few

There is a sign up right by their register to ask for a receipt upon receiving your food. When I did, she told me that their store doesn't give out receipts but gave me one that came from the cooks. I've worked with food last year and customer service is a priority.

She continued to say wait hold on. Then she finally says it's going to be about 5-7 minutes before she could take our order. So we waited about 20 more minutes and then drove to the window. We continued to wait at the window for about 5 more minutes while the lady at the register was counting change. A different lady the opened the drive thru window and let us know that their system went down. When she asked us if we would like to wait the lady that was  counting changes then jumps in and says ""you need to change your face it's the systems fault""",BQqq8kTl9AbKNI5OOhRr2g,0,0,1,7MyCv9PUaN36fz6XEJe42g

Biggest tip: There is a small cart on the back wall with many side items that you can place into provided baggies. I *highly* recommend the spicy carrots. No extra charge!",_pYiYJ77zw3AWCU5YsbaIw,0,0,4,1jyfCQw3BVaQt1tSLTbBOA

Most of the stuff is fried so not the healthiest place to eat, but it's a nice treat on occasion.  Most of the staff speaks little English, and they aren't overly friendly, but they aren't mean.  You do wind up paying extra for extra condiments, and there are signs to not take more from the relish bar than you will eat, I don't know why they do that.

5504356,2017-06-30,0,OgnEQFk9HmF6jGVM3hUM2Q,"First time to this location and will probably go more often. We love Roberto's tacos, and the food is pretty consistent throughout all the locations, so far...Actually this was the first time that I ordered a beef burrito. And the reviews do not lie, this thing was HUGE. I was only able to eat half as I was also eating some rolled tacos that hubby had ordered. I love the crunch of the corn torillas. 

Back to the burrito. I think it was a little salty for my taste although it had good flavor and the beef was shredded and really tender.  since it was my first time, I'm not sure if this is how it usually is, but it was good with the side of guacamole, sour cream and salsa. We had to pay extra for the side of guacamole and sour cream, but for the portion they give you its worth it. I've paid for these same sides elsewhere and gotten only a third of what you get here. 

Love the pickled carrots, onions and jalapeno's. The salsas at this location were not spicy at all. 

The workers here are friendly with smiles on their faces! The restaurant was pretty clean as well. 

We visited this location at around 2p and so it was pretty empty, but there was a steady flow of customers coming in, mostly takeout.",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,1,1,4,eN8g-zAoy88mYLn6RwVLRQ
