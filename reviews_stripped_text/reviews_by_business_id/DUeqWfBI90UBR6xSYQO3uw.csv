This place is seriously awesome! It has fantastic food, affordable, ambiance is amazing...and GREAT service! 

I am from Chicago visiting a couple of my best friends who lives in Vegas. Came with a good friend of ours from Cali, that was intrigued of this place that sells Filipino street foods. To my surprise...I had a BLAST! I was impressed and would highly recommend this place. Service of Ate Aleth was great! She is such a sweetheart! If not for her, we probably will not be as comfortable. She entertained us and she is so much fun. Also Brian, DJ/bartender, was so nice! Both of them, made us stay longer and enjoy the night!

But aside from great people, the food was very good! Kwekkwek, isaw, tapsilog, bangus sisig are just some of the food I recommend! It was good that I was not even hungry and ended up eating so much!  

Overall, it's the place to be!

Kudos to Bar Kada and Thanks for an amazing night!",kbiNWy7WSEhdR4cJlhaC4A,0,0,5,7O9T-UI83ZspKcwZYZjwOQ

1107055,2014-07-30,1,DUeqWfBI90UBR6xSYQO3uw,"Very disappointed. There was only two tables including ours, our food took FOREVER.
And after our female server took the orders 30mins later, she came back and told us they didnt have kalderetang kambing. Really!! After 30mins taking our orders. So she gave us the isaw and chicken bbq at the same time. When she was supposed to bring everything AT THE SAME TIME. Or at least ask us if we want a certain food item first than the rest. Then when the kare-kare was brought to our table, first bite, it was already too salty. And there wasnt any tripes in their kare-kare. 
We also ordered fish balls, and the fish balls took longer than the rest of the food. Hah! More than an hour wait for the fish balls. This place is nothing but a joke!
Dj's were lame. And also, they charged us 20% gratuity. Why? 
Service suck! And the food quality was bad, not worth paying, not worth spending.
Working in a steakhouse, party of 6 or more is normally 18% gratuity automatically. And barkada is nothing compare to a steakhouse so why would they be charging 20% gratuity? So I did complained on that til they correct it to 18% the way it should be. We were all very disappointed. And would never go back there.

We were promised a bunch of items and the night before our party they were not able to fulfill the order. They were understaffed, didn't provide a lechon (pig) and then dessert was not prepared. The main owner promised us some drink tickets for beverages and again they did not come through and charged us extra.    After all this our guest host opened a gifted bottle of alcohol and they wanted to charge us a cork fee. Couldn't believe it! We were taking one celebratory drink and they weren't going to budge after all the other things fell through. I can't say how disappointed I am and we are. That's 80+ people they lost business to over trivial issues and a lack of preparedness. The saddest part is the food is good, the facility is great, but the management was very poor. 2 stars is being nice and mostly due to facilities.",RgkE4axKKeLW__unMFEB6Q,1,0,2,Jbp0_NipojNIMa5bHffu_Q

1279983,2014-09-12,0,DUeqWfBI90UBR6xSYQO3uw,"Ate here couple times with family and have brought couple put of town friends as well.  Place is clean and have a good combination of different age group of people coming here not just young pinoys. You'll also find good mixture of different nationality here which is cool I think.

We have tried couple foods from the menu:

1) Fishballs - love this! Although it's quite expensive if you happen to be here before or after their Happy Hours and on the days they don't have the Happy Hours (Fridays & Saturdays) which I think was disappointing.  The fishballs is yummy... the closest to Philippines kind of fishballs. 

2) Tokwa at Baboy - another fave here! The pork is cooked to perfection and matches very well with the crispy tokwa along with the yummy vinegar sauce they put in it.

3) Kare Kare - not all that for us. It lacks flavor. 

4) Tocilog - love this one as well! The tocino is good although not the same as the Philippines style but the flavor was great with the garlic fried rice and eggs (just wished they put a little salt on the egg like how it's done in Philippines) & the vinegar dipping sauce made it taste even better.

5) Chicharon Bulaklak - my hubby and friends loved this one. Didn't try it as I'm not a big fan to begin with but the boys loved the crispiness with the vinegar dipping sauce.

6) Pork Sisig - our friends loved this dish as well. They said it's well seasoned and it was delicious. 

7) Crispy Pata - this is another delish dish although I prefer DT's crispy pata better.

8) Happy Hour foods - Isaw was disappointing as it wasn't the same as the ones you get in PI. The consistency was veey different.  Pork belly liempo was very good...melts in your mouth and can eat a lot of this for sure. The bbq beef was disappointing as it was not cooked well when it was served. The inside of the meat was cold and tasted uncooked. Server tried to still charge us for the uneaten meat. So during the happy hour, we really only get the fishballs and the liempo.  I'll probably try the other food next time.

9) Drinks - I loved the Baguio & Tagaytay!! I also loved their guava and guyabano drinks.

Ambience:

I have to agree with other yelpers that said it can be very loud in here.  Kinda hard to have conversations over dinner specially if there's not a lot of people yet.

Service:

The service is hit or miss.  Sometimes they are very quick, friendly and prompt in getting drinks and orders.  Other times, they are not attentive to their customers where you have to constantly flag them to get drink refills.

Overall,  it is not a bad place to hang out. Will definitely be back to try other foods in their menu.",kjNbCZ0Le3IDGk7RMZZ93g,1,0,4,MZUyVfugmDqYBrwTFx3WVQ

So when I heard dinner was @ this venue, I was excited! I recently took a 3 week holiday vacation in the Philippines and I gobbled up all the authentic Filipino food I can eat! Too bad Pinas has no Yelp :(
Anyway, I was prepared not to expect too much at Bar Kada Ave since I just came from motherland. I was glad I didn't have high expectations because the food was just OK. 
I ordered the chicken skin which I thought needed more garlicky flavor. They served breakfast all day which is a plus for me. I had breakfast (Tapsilog) for dinner. The two food I ordered were both barely served warm. The tapa was super tender but needs more flavoring. The garlic fried rice was not the best I've had. And last, service definitely needs improvement.

my wifey invited me and a couple of ladies out for some girl time and we decided on bar kada avenue to start out our evening because of their advertised happy hour deals.
upon our arrival, we learned that they don't offer the happy hour specials when they have live entertainment, which they had that evening, so that was a bummer and should be noted on their advertising but i digress.
it was a saturday night and they had a dj as well as a live band.
both were decent and played many songs that we all knew and enjoyed.

our server was very sweet and accommodating.
the drinks were good and the food was tasty although not gourmet, definitely fitting for a bar scene.

Bisteksilog (beef)
Bangsilog (fried milkfish)

After seating us, I immediately ordered the bangsilog (I was starving!) and he ordered tapsilog. We loved it. Large portion of garlic fried rice with crispy garlic chips on top. Milkfish (bangus) satisFRIED (yes, I said satisfried) my craving for fish. As a first timer, the food was enough to keep me wanting more...sadly, the service was lacking because I had to wave the girl down for water...and it wasn't busy.

We waited 15 minutes to be noticed/seated; and it wasn't even by the hostess --- the bartender seated us. Turns out they were slammed with a family party that had 20 extra people in the rsvp. You know us, Filipinos, travel with the village! The bartender was nice enough to bring out a makeshift/party table onto the dancefloor for us. He kept apologizing, as well, for the lack of immediate service....He kept saying that they were understaffed. We said it was ""ok"" cause, in reality, ish happens...that's a part of restaurant life.
We ordered family style sisig fries, sisig nachos, chicken wings, bangsilog (for me), bisteksilog, eggplant torta, and tapsilog.
Sisig wasn't even close to being as good as Café Moda's sisig..not crunchy. The nachos, obvi, had cheese on it and it was a weird thought but, didn't taste too bad. 
My friend loved his eggplant torta, more so, after dipping it in his banana ketchup.
Chicken wings were whatever. 
Overall, everyone was satisfied with this visit. BUT, we were charged 20% auto gratuity for our large group. 

Third time's a charm and a friend had her husband's 30th bday festivities there. We came on a Friday and got reserved tables on the dancefloor. Ordered whole bunch of apps (pancit, veggie lumpia, shanghai lumpia) that were blah. 
The veggie lumpia was all lumpia wrapper and had no veggies in them. 
Shanghai lumpia was burnt. Pancit is a no brainer and can't go wrong.
Steller stand out was when my roomie ordered chicken skin and fried rice. UGH. That chicken skin dipped in vinegar is drooooooooooooooool **mouth watering**
Friday was $5 Patron and AMF. Needless to say, we were entertained all night with people karaoke-ing, rapping, and dancing. It's as entertaining as a normal Filipino party =)


After these 3 visits:
- Service is lacking; only because they're understaffed. Bartender was great!
- Food isn't a real standout, other than the SILOGS! I mean, really..... =)
- I need to practice my karaoke skills cuz one day I will have more than enough AMF to really get up there and sing in front of complete strangers.",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,10,5,3,QkRlXzs9_iS_cphR5PEDHw

I've tried the Sigsig, fried adobo rice, bagoong fried rice, garlic rice, karekare, pancit canton, street food. I made sure I ordered my favorite types of filipino dishes haha, and a friend recommended the sigsig and sure enough it's amazing and a dish that I've always ordered every visit. So if you go here I defiantly recommend the sigsig and adobo rice or on a lighter side garlic rice... Sooooo satisfying. I like intestines, so the Isaw and pig ears for street food on a stick dipped in their sauces, vinegar and onion... Amazeballs!",17f-n5Rouu89FSKuc4c7xw,2,1,5,LmIzgxm63u1P0iR_ptwGnw

Upon entering, you'll be welcome with the fun filled ambience yet we got a 3-5 minute wait upon the hostess greetings and for us to be checked in, though regardless she greeted with a warm smile. 

Upon seating, and ready for ordering... It was a fast check in. (I hope it's not bcos it's a weekday though... But well see. Next time yea? Lol) So, food came and it's a wooooow... Portion wise, it's good for two or three. (Good job on that.) How was the food? My say, it's mouthful.   not bcos I eat these kinda but it is indeed mouthful.  #thumbsupforthat 

They also offer a dance floor for those people who have a happy feet; Sound Check wise:  Great selections to begin with. Not those oldies kind of songs. Up to date. #niceselectionsofsongs and in case you feel like you wanna sing your hearts out, they offer that too. IF you have the guts or you just wanna have fun, microphone is free for grabs. 

The only thing that I would say I would minus my stars, was when our server missed one item. (I guess our female server didn't hear us bcos of the sounds. Let's just say or yet let's blame it on the sounds. Haha) but again, regardless our servers was up to their game. Table touching, was just a 5 stars. 
They also offer their bar... Awesome. (Good job on the ""No under 21 allowed"" 

So above all, our experience is a 4 Stars. Maybe next time, I'll for sure add that 1 more star. Oh wait before I forgot, they also offer a $15 off on 50 and up. So, a must try. A way to end a Manic Monday. 

Till next time.

Oh, wait before I forget; one more thing that bothers me was the ""headset"" (and it was our female server, she's using it on the floor which for me is a no-no.)... Errr, to think the sounds was at it's blast, how on earth will she possibly hear us? Oh, well again... There's another day. I'm still giving a four stars.

I ordered I think, Hotsilog? (Philippine hotdogs, eggs, with fried rice) and oh my goodness they have balut! (something DT's doesn't have). It definitely made me miss the Philippines. For the first time in 12 years, I tried balut again and well, I wasn't really a big fan of it knowing there's a dead bird inside. My parents told me I used to eat them a lot before but I was young then. I only ate the yellow part though. I also ordered fish balls during happy hour, now THAT was the real deal. I couldn't stop eating it!

The only other place I've seen and tasted sisig tacos were off of the White Rabbit food truck in California. Then there are the sisig fries; they are the bomb. Combined with the friendly and accommodating waiters and bar staff, atmosphere, drink specials, and DJs (decent sound system by the way), Bar Kada is easily a place to get hooked to. As long as they continue to build their brand with their uniqueness, they can easily build a cult following. I also heard that this is the go-to place topsilog.

5050276,2014-02-27,1,DUeqWfBI90UBR6xSYQO3uw,"Came out for a intimate gathering of friends night out and decided to come to this new spot for drinks and bar food. 

I split chicarron bulaklak and sisig with a few people. The chicarron was decent, but I prefer smaller cuts so you get better crisp to the fatty center ratio. The sisig is fairly decent. I think maybe we should have ordered a bit differently only because it was greasy pork bits overload, specially since I was just at a taco crawl event earlier. 

They had live entertainment, a band and a DJ during their intermissions. There is a stage if you want to dance. My biggest complaint was the volume. We left after a bit because we could not hold any conversation. I tried and ended up a bit hoarse and gave up. There is a happy medium as I've been to bar hangouts where a seat in the back meant you can have both. Most of the people really into it anyways will be dancing, right in front of the band so you don't need it to blare. 

Just a note that they offer happy hour specials daily of 50% off appetizers and $5 drink specials (7-10pm) but do not while there is live entertainment. You may want to call and ask if you're coming there for happy hour on a weekend. 

It's not a bad Filipino bar though. It's typical vibe of the bar-staurants in Philippines.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,2,3,l5V-cWThNOs02rqr_mRiBw

The cocktails are on the sweeter side. I should have expected it, almost everything I ate or drank in the Philippines is sweet. 

The chicharone and sisig was decent. They are greasy and artery clogging, but that is half the enjoyment. The fried pig skin was light and crispy.

The laser lights sparkling up the room made it feel cheesy.
The music was constant and too loud. It was a Saturday and they had a live band and a DJ. I really wasn't into either of them. Some older women took to the dance floor and had a good time which is nice to see. It wasn't very busy .
