I had :

 (1) 2 hotdog combo with Sauerkraut , Lg Crinkle Cut French Fries and 1 Heineken beer          $17.24

i picked up the hotdog and the bun totally disintegrated , incredibly small hotdog compared to the price, the fries were cold and over cooked.

The beer was cold",hhKLgpwT19Onl2M_TduGUQ,0,0,1,6QzXQsczNNIBfPPk6Zoo1w

Whenever i get chicken strips from a fast food joint, i expect them to be ground up chicken meat with some sandy breading.  These though, they were hot, actual chicken, with breading that was seemed to be somewhat real. The special sauce provided was a typical special sauce, but still delicious. The fries also tasted really fresh, and real. It was an overall new experience.  It was a good, quick, cheapish bite to eat while staying at the monte carlo.",O9uxbf6uADlls0qKcVMDwA,1,0,5,HBdG0vmGFA2OB-o8OEyjrQ

In a city where everything seems ridiculously overpriced I found this little piece of heaven at the Monte Carlo.  The chicken is battered and fried as you wait, the fries are homecut  and also made to order.  It takes about 8 minutes to get your order so they give you a little buzzer which goes off when the food is ready.  Everything was crispy and fresh and oh so delicious...the best part was since I was staying in the hotel I could just run up to my room and scarf it all down in the comfort and privacy of my suite.  You have to try it...just do it!!",q4uuANLSSA3tDUnKDgSBEQ,0,1,5,hCoB2ztMHbBoaF3leL-FJw
