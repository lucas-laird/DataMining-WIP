1709169,2015-02-16,1,ayT30_GPYHqnrDhBe3IySQ,double check your plates they serve you. Its been more than once that my plate has been covered in old food from the previous dish. Foul. The food is good i'll tell you that. But the prices are ridiculous...,pQ3rIg6cHDHCtLxK3e9X4g,1,2,2,zr6_6okzVydjaM6Q8IKxdg

One time I had to wait 30 minutes for a egg sandwich I was planning on eating while my daughter was in swim class. I had to tell them after 20 min I was still waiting for my food and I needed to go back and get my daughter. 5 min later still food wasn't here. Then about 5 min left, I told one guy to pack it to go because it took too long. Guess what, they brought it out on a plate and I'm telling them my daughter is done with class. I basically went to go pick up my daughter and then came back for the food because I couldn't wait for them any longer.  Each swim class is 30min. I ordered right after I dropped her off before her class. I hate having to order here but there is nowhere else to go.... 

Sorry I love lifetime but please improve the staff or the food prep time for an egg sandwich.  

This actually happened back in April but just seeing the line today made me post.",r6bTtMJ26w3Vy46CxYJu0w,0,0,3,0bYFLy5CvZiVjR7ZWh9CFg
2016046,2018-06-21,5,ayT30_GPYHqnrDhBe3IySQ,"Ok so I swore I'd never come back here again after my horrible experience with the wilted pre-made salad they insisted on giving me rather than making me a new one when I asked. However, I had just gotten done with a 2 hour cardio workout and I was famished so I decided to let bygones be bygones. And I'm really glad I did. My first test was to have a look at the salads they had out and they looked considerably fresher than when I wrote my first review. That made me feel confident enough to place an order. I ended up getting the Caprese Panini (pictured) which was really good. Service was accommodating. Overall, I was impressed so I've decided to end my long grudge against this place, after all, it's HEALTHY to do so and they earned my respect back. Just wanted to clear the air about Life Cafe.",ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ,10,12,4,Dv1RFxFCxyZH6ofBQrNWoQ
2295581,2015-02-13,1,ayT30_GPYHqnrDhBe3IySQ,"Located inside Lifetime Fitness in Summerlin, Life Cafe is a decent spot to grab a quick bite while you're at the gym. They have a pretty large menu for a gym cafe that consists mostly of salads, sandwiches/wraps, and smoothies. You can order off the menu or just purchase from their grab and go fridge where they have drinks and premade salads and sandwiches.

The curry chicken wrap I had was pretty good and surprisingly had a great curry flavor. However, the rice was way undercooked and was kind of hard...looks to me like they probably don't have a rice cooker on site. The wrap came with a ""seasonal side"" which turned out to be a small side salad covered in quinoa. The salad was tasty and made me feel healthy after a good work out.

The pricing is pretty reasonable considering that they're located inside a gym. The curry wrap I had was around 8 or 9 bucks. I would return if I was hungry while at the gym again in the future but it probably wouldn't be worth a separate trip down",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,2,3,xGjI2KqPvgD3_qVJl29GiA

I have had better salads from Wendy's. I will not be going back.",YFbxhrQCbCWiMjLwDI7Pgw,0,0,2,UZoDFR3Em9arBJcVjv0kJg
3389961,2014-07-29,2,ayT30_GPYHqnrDhBe3IySQ,"Love coming to this place after a work out. I eat here roughly 3-4 times a week and I'm never disappointed. I've tried several sandwiches, wraps and salads and have liked all of them. Especially the salmon salad. I also really like how they put the dressings for the salads on the side. 

Everyone that works here is also very pleasant. I could do without the kids that usually fill up the place but that's about the only bad thing I could say.",z8wN6EQuw_JF-zTjcNgsLw,3,4,5,5MtpVoHU1Tqoz-1T9Qj_6A
4938958,2017-02-01,0,ayT30_GPYHqnrDhBe3IySQ,Some of the food here is a hit or miss but most of the time I order it's pretty good. Sometimes the wait is a bit long but there's not that many people working back there and each dish is made as soon as it's ordered. The Chipotle Southwest Quesadilla is amazing! It's not on the menu but it's a special and the cilantro sauce that it comes with is very good! The blueberry muffins are amazing as well!,O9v1HPoV8YGhc3kNDmEPqA,0,0,4,gpf7_QiFsY3yqKe9Q1MQjA
