The second complaint was the waitress. Nice lady but she was struggling to stay on top of it. Our soup was luke warm and she forgot to bring out the salad. I eventually asked the chef while he was cooking our rice (which was dry as hell) and she finally brought it out. Towards the end of the meal the chef had to refill our glasses  himself  because she had not come back out to do so. 

I have been to many Benihana's but I was not pleased with the overall experience here. The waitress even said she felt bad for giving us the bill ($120) because it was a lousy night. We arrived at 9:15 so it was not a full house at the time.

Let's talk about the service. The server came not to long after we sat. She smiled, tell us her name, welcomed us and give us some recommendations for drinks. Her name is vinni. The drinks come pretty fast. We order some food after. I ordered fillet with shrimp. One of my buddies got 12 oz steak and the other one order shrimp and scallop. Vinnie told us that they dont have combination shrimp and scallop only. It has calamari too. But she said she can replace the calamari with extra shrimp instead if it OK with us. The price will be cheaper than a la carte. Will do then. We also order 1 appetizer that she recommended  it's crispy tuna. Very delicious!! Don't missed the fried rice. It's so good! 

We got our soup and salad, finish with our 2 rounds drinks also finish our appetizers. Where is the chef? Vinnie told us that the chef will be out soon but he didn't come. She knew that we were waiting. She offered us to order another drink while waiting and we did. Thanks to her that she didn't leave and let us wait with nothing. Excellent service!! A+

Here is the chef finally here. His name is tony. Friendly and nice guy. He started the shows and talked. We waited and waited for the food to be to be done. We were so hungry. Both of my buddies couldnt wait, they went outside and come back 30 minutes later and the food still not ready. Wow!! I wonder how long this dinner will be? He forgot couple things, not professional! Over all,we've waited for more than 1.5 hours to get all our food done to cooked. 
The food taste good but the timing is awful. The chef just need to stop talking and cook faster. We had to leave before he finished clean the grill.

Come back? Maybe if I have plenty of time to eat because it will take at least 2 hours for the dinner.",sQa2aNpv8mMam4Ye722gkQ,0,0,4,4pMxgZqLiccvPUZHQkj5dA

I got up to go the bathroom and glass was in my shoe. I mentioned it to the manager on site and he brushed it off as it was no big deal.

1001444,2017-12-14,0,ARohEoxqg8TzA5gQfdGAZw,"Ordered something and got something else (???)

We knew Benihana when it was located at the Hilton and it was always a treat to dine there. We also have one close by in Scottsdale and go there all the time.

The meal at Benihana on the strip was to be the highlight of our culinary disappointment expedition in Las Vegas. We thought to have reached rock bottom with Maggiano's and wanted to leave on a good impression. Benihana has always been good to us. Until today.

Before he started cooking, our cook explained that he personally prepared the food in the kitchen before coming to the table.

I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki. My chicken came with no Teriyaki. Big chunky pieces of unappetizing chicken. Gross!!! I told our cook and he said oops, I forgot. He called the waiter who brought me a little container of cold runny teriyaki sauce from the kitchen. It is not the same as when it is cooked with it!

My husband ordered the Benihana excellence with beef julienne (which he loves) and shrimp. When he was served with a piece of steak that came with a huge piece of fat (that the cook jokingly called Las Vegas bacon) my husband said this is not what he ordered. He knows what beef julienne looks like as he had ordered it many times before.
We called the waiter to ask him what happened. He said this is the splash and meadow. So, not what we ordered!!  He cut us off saying, well this is meat and shrimp, this is the same thing, so what.

Before leaving, we talked to the manager (Mr Ralph Treszi) who basically did not care. He offered to make me another chicken teriyaki. What? when we are ready to leave? not interested. All he did was give me his card and tell me to call him before we go to Scottsdale next time and he'll ask the Scottsdale location ""to do something for us"". I do not care. I wanted is that he assumes the mistakes of his staff not make me act like a beggar and have another location assume his shortcoming. This is so pathetic!

Our cook made is obvious he loves to have tables of people cheering and clapping at his antics. Although we enjoy having fun, we are not cheering, screaming and clapping people and felt we were treated like 3rd world customers. Behind us there was a large table of people celebrating a birthday and he paid them more attention than our table. 

This location is just plain greedy and unfriendly. We had the worse experience and I am going to contact headquarters about it.",CgEEUplLonTI6iwiC9yyBw,1,0,1,4RKSRVXqbT_Q5xEtkivTRA

At times I had to move my chair for them to get by.The two chefs, the one at our table an the table next to us, were pretty much butt to butt. They need to expand the place a bit if possible. The food was not bad. I have a gripe about them giving us rice in the beginning and then it getting very cold by the time everything is cooked. It's not just this Benihana's, but I noticed they do this at other teppenyaki places. Why can't they just wait until everything is cooked and then just bring the rice? Rice cools off so fast, and white rice is just not enjoyable to eat by itself. Anwyay, it wasn't bad and our server was nice. The meat was tender, and the chef at our table told us how to cook it so it's tender.

If Benihana at the Fashion Show is your only option, I guess I'd recommend it, but if you can venture elsewhere, you should try Ohjah, Osaka, or one of the Valley's other options--unless you have PLENTY of time to eat!

I met a friend for lunch on a slow Wednesday during Restaurant Week. Can't beat $20 for soup, edamame, grilled shrimp, fried rice and veggies, and green tea ice cream! But it's a good thing I took the afternoon off, because my leisurely lunch turned into a two-and-a-half hour meal. (It didn't help that it took us 20 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation.)

The food was fine, and our chef was fun and personable. But I wish our hostess had been more attentive, or at least had explained why the wait was so long with so many empty tables in full view.

I probably won't return to this location, especially with so many other options closer to home.

We arrived on time and still had to wait for awhile which was ok with us. Tried to order a mai tai from bar but bartender was too busy making drinks for servers. Why not have a 2nd bartender management?? After waiting 15 minutes for service a manager helped me and made the worst tasting drink that was NOT a mai tai as he stated!! We finally got seated and one of my guest had to leave, she was not feeling well. We all were seated when some single female stranger came to sit with our group which was awkward. I had to tell her it was kind of weird for her to join our private group when she had other options to sit at other tables with smaller groups. The male manager told me that was too bad she was told to sit with us, I told him it was awkward and felt like walking out with our group but we were all hungry. The lady moved to another table after that. Manager was young and very rude and unprofessional. Place was pretty new and the service reflected that. We had a female cook and an African American male cook which was a first for me at any Benihana. No complaints just thought that was cool! We could tell they were both brand new in training because their skills were bad and service was slow and totally unorganized. We dealt with it and stuck to beers as all the mix drinks were messed up. Because this place was new I am willing to try it out again.

Our waiter kept disappearing and we had to ask him multiple times for everything. Everyone at the table complained about him, even the chef. There was a point in time where he didn't come around for at least 20 minutes. 

In addition to the horrible service, the food quality wasn't up to the normal Benihana standard and taste. We spent $200 on dinner and it wasn't even worth half that. The rice had a weird taste and the steak seemed like very low quality compared to what they normally serve. On top of that, I'm wondering if this location has an issue with ventilation because you leave smelling like the restaurant and it's so strong! It was so bad this time that my eyes were burning while they were cooking. This has never happened to me at any other Benihana location.  

During my visit the time before, my friend and I had to send our meals back to have them replaced because the rice had that weird taste and the steak and shrimp looked old. The manager came out and agreed that something wasn't right. The new meals looked ""normal.""

2157938,2017-06-18,0,ARohEoxqg8TzA5gQfdGAZw,"So although I used to live in a condo just a few hundred yards away from fashion show mall, I never even realized Benihana was inside.

I stumbled across it on memorial day weekend when I stayed at the Encore across the street. I ate there for lunch at the semi-outdoor bar seating and then decided to go back a week later and sit inside at a grill. So I have to write this review for both. 

As you may notice in many of my reviews, I often look for 'cleaner' food options. Benihana is a great place to get a macro nutrient friendly, nutrient dense meal. They provide the macro nutrients their website and even the total calorie count for each dish on the menu. These are huge bonuses for me.

When I went for lunch, I had steak and chicken, brown rice and steamed veggies. I asked that they hold any extra oil. Oddly enough, my dish took about an extra three or four minutes to come out from the kitchen because of that request. So my cousins who were with me got their meals ahead of me. That was no big deal though. The meal was delicious, and something clean just like I would prepare at home except I got to be out enjoying with family. 

Following week, I went with my wife and her coworkers. We got a grill seat and the chef did a really good job. I grew up going to Hibachi style restaurants because my parents were big fans of them. Although I was skeptical based on the readings, this was the best one I have ever been to. (Based on 5 or so different hibachi style businesses visited) 

The service was excellent. The food was fresh and very very tasty. The environment at these type of restaurant is always really cool and it's conducive to socializing with friends and family over a meal. 

One negative I would say was the sushi roll I got for the appetizer. Six pieces at that price were absolutely not worth it. And the sushi was really average. 

But other than that I highly recommend you give this place a shot!",zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,1,2,5,FhWG6TW4si86Ejv0Q0wkjw

This is a great strip happy hour.  They have tons of drink specials from a $3 sake to a $16 fishbowl.  All their HH food specials are under $7.  We ordered a couple rolls, Gyoza and Karaage Chicken along with a Blue Ocean Punch Bowl, White Peach Sake Sangria and Lychee Blossom.  Food and drinks were delicious.  Service was great although I do wish our bartender would have let us know she was leaving at shift change.  She disappeared and we didn't know she was gone for the day.  I would have liked to close our tab before she left.  

The main downfall of this happy hour for me is they will only let you order the fishbowl for 2.  That's pretty lame, especially in Vegas.  You can get fishbowls up and down the strip so not sure why they are so uptight about it.  It is not particularly strong either.  The bartender said it was and told stories about people drinking half and disappearing into the bathroom they were so wasted.  Maybe if you are a rookie or weigh 80lbs.  I drank the whole thing and got buzzed but wasn't wasted by a long shot.  The bartender did end up letting me order the fishbowl and my friend order another cocktail but it took some persuading and the promise of acting like we were sharing if a manager came by.",XXKjsdglgwSs9kWtK6ZWUQ,3,4,4,cAIK2NKQoPhRKvGBdU3Dgg

Truly an extra bonus to the perfectly cooked steak, veggies, seafood, rice & atmosphere.

We had a reservation for 7pm and were sat around 7:10pm. Everything was ordered and delivered promptly. Tony took roughly an hour and 15 minutes with our table. It was nice to not feel rushed.

Then I ordered the Benihana Delight (chicken and shrimp) for my gf and the server asked how I would like it cooked...lol what?
   Our chef came out and started preparing our food with so many slip ups and mistakes that it was hard to ignore. I've had a hibachi chef before who was barely 18 and he made less mistakes. As I looked around the room I noticed the other chefs were much more skilled so clearly we just got the short end of the stick. 
   The food was definitely the saving grace, everything was delicious, from the chicken fried rice to the scallops. However, my filet mignon was a little undercooked and bland.

It's always an amazing place to meet new people.
Everyone had a glass of hot green tea, onion soup with mushrooms and little onion as well is a fresh salad with ginger dressing. 

My main course, I had grilled shrimp, with fried chicken rice full of garlic butter and when I say full I mean hoooooked up with garlic butter, I also enjoyed teriyaki chicken with a plate full of vegetables. So much food, well seasoned and flavorful, I love Benihana and enjoy the show with every meal. Since it was my birthday, they sang happy birthday and gave me a ice cream Sunday (green tea flavor).

He barely did a show too... he slipped the cooking utensils at the beginning and at the end he did the onion volcano but that was it... pretty pathetic show if you ask me and the fact that he paid absolutely no attention to my boyfriend and I and the other family across from us is why I am giving it 2 stars.

The manager was totally disrespectful to me and my guest. The server said they had NO HOT WATER for tea. I asked them to boil water on the stove to bring hot water for the tea, they said they didn't have a pot to make it. What Japanese restaurant doesn't serve hot tea?!!
**after reading numerous reviews (Candice T and Nan80) stated that they've also been told the hot water machine was broken, R E A L L Y?  This machine has not been replaced with even a Mr. Coffee machine that can make hot water?
Don't you think a manager could have done something to get a new machine, coffee carafe or T-Fal to boil hot water meanwhile the hot water machine was being built in China and sent by pony express to his restaurant? Maybe he could have called Sparkletts to order a hot water dispenser unit with the 5 gallon hot water bottle on top. Being a manager he can't even manage water!
This must be a scam this restaurant is pulling just so they won't have to provide free hot tea. They would prefer that you PAY for a drink.

The server brought some lemon wedges that  I requested. They were heaped on top of a soggy paper bar napkin- instead of using a small bowl. The lemons looked slimy and bent/used. The server delivered them from her hand without a plate under the lemons. I didn't use any of the lemons because I knew I would be sick. My guest asked the server to get a plate for the lemons. She said, ""we don't have plates."" 
The family who was seated at our table were extremely loud. After bringing these issues to the manager's attention, he said I was ""harassing him!"" Rather than deal with and fix the small problems, he immediately threatened to kick me out. I told him he didn't know what the word ""harass"" meant and that he should look it up in the dictionary. He called the mall security officers to remove us from the restaurant. This manager doesn't have any public relations skills nor is he respectful with guests. 
The manager went to the table where we were seated and stood in front of this family yelling out loud to this family and others in the restaurant that I said they were loud. Everybody stopped talking to hear what he had to say. He intended to and did embarrass us. We were shamed as we left the restaurant with every guest staring at us as the security officers escorted us out. My guest never spoke to the manager to have any reason to be thrown out!
The security officer told me that this manager has kicked out many guests in the past and also said he is not a nice person. 
There are better restaurants in Las Vegas where you can get respectable service and the hot water you need. Neither my guest nor I consume alcohol to be accused of being kicked out for that reason.

I do NOT ever plan on dining at Benihana's again, you lost my business and that of my family and friends as I have already told them what happened.

Benihana doesn't care if a guest is publicly shamed or kicked out for doing nothing wrong. This manager is on a power trip. I suspect he threatened his employees not to say what happened when and if corporate investigates. They don't want to lose their jobs but they know that this manager bullies the guests by kicking them out by force. If you want to take a chance of being kicked out come to the Fashion Show Benihana, otherwise, enjoy a more peaceful restaurant.",jE21mypAQC2m7_IdCzGH0w,1,0,1,eVf-4PDXWzEwDWqMOfGAMw

So everything started out well, we received our table in the time we reserved. Our server started us out with water as we placed our drinks/sushi/and food orders. Our sushi came late, like after our soup. And only one of the two rolls came. We had to inquire about the 2nd roll. The second roll came after our chef had began serving the rice and stuff. (We rejected the second roll, it was already time to eat the main meal). There were times we had to ask for our waitress to find out where our regular steam rice was, or for refills, or for another fork. Seemed once the chef came it was a total disregard for the table. 

So as we were talking about our service and another table enlightened us to the fact that the chefs don't get none of the tips at the end of the night that you give to the server. You have to tip the chef independently in order for them to receive any tips. In my opinion I think that's total crap, the chefs are the personalities that everybody gets to meet in deal with not the server. That policy should be reversed where all tips go to the chef, if you want to tip the waitress then do so.

Aaron was a great chef and a good personality! We def be back to see HIM",h-qBrdFSx9K54AG_WaNEog,4,0,3,swk-busE8cEadElQWlAFwA

Mom and brother got the hibachi chicken. It was a little dry for my, but I'm not much of a grilled chicken girl either. My mom and my brother enjoyed it very much.

My salad was good, nothing special. Just iceberg lettuce and some carrots. The dressing was your usual ginger miso.

Soup, i would go with that next time. It had an amazing mushroom broth with just a slice or mushroom and tempura onions! It was delish. Def an UMAMI dish

It's the new establishment of the Benihana chain, but of course, they added more flair by modernizing it, opening up, and just adding nothing but red on red on red. For some reason, red seems to be the thing. Like if it's super red inside, some spontaneous thing happens that wouldn't expect to happen in an establishment, or that maybe there's a secret door that leads to some secret room that holds the answers to all of our worldly questions. 

Anyways! We hit up Benihana's for a friend's birthday, because it's her favorite spot (let's call her Tami). Tami's husband, spoke to the waitress and asked for the funniest guy in the restaurant. You're welcome. I've cracked the ultimate teppanyaki code. Usually, in experiences like these you pray that the chef you get is the funniest person in the establishment. It makes or breaks your experience. The whole thing is like playing roulette, but with your chef. So I've cracked the code. We got the funniest guy in that place. His name is Tony. Tony the tiger (That's right! You heard me!). I believe he's off on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. So if you're there, and you want the funny guy. No need to slip a $5. Just ask for Tony. ;)

He'll make you spongebob. He'll make you a minion. He'll even write your name on the grill with egg whites. You are a charmer ,Tony! Yes. You. Are. I know. Total spoiler alert, but you'll thank me later when you're coordinating your party, and you want to validate that your chef is funny to ensure your party is happy.

You know the usual fixings here if you're a regular, but I would highly recommend getting that housemade diabolo sauce. It is literal fire. Your mouth will be feeling ten different shades of hotness, but it is addicting. 

Also, ask for extra garlic butter. Why? Because your are an adventurer! You live life on the edge! No cholesterol, high blood pressure, or food coma is going to stop you from getting exactly what you want!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,4,1,4,X_kUEck9NS8-EpI3uou65A

Okay so here starts the saga of our Christmas day dinner at Benihana on the Las Vegas Strip. We arrive mid afternoon and upon entering the restaurant, a distinct smell of thick grease and old fish wafts through the air. It's as if they had no ventilation fans pulling out the air from all of the cooking at the Teppan tables. We are seated within a few minutes and then the saga began.

Our drink orders and meal orders are first taken by the kind waitress; and then the soup and salad comes out. The soup was luke-warm in temperature; and the salad dressing tasted off this time around (overly garlicky and bitter), and not the typical amazing taste.

Out comes our 20 something Benihana chef, a very kind gentleman. As he prepares the food, most of his tricks fail during the show. I asked if they are still professionally trained; to which he stated that old retired Benihana corporate chefs came in and gave the new hires a couple of lessons. Really! These guys used to be master chefs trained by Benihana in Japan. Now we get young millennials with a couple of chop chop lessons; scared of the knives flying into your children's faces!

He further stated that they were going to be super busy that night, and that they were already running out of food. When I asked why he said that they only get their deliveries on Mondays; and since it was Christmas that they didn't get their delivery.

I then asked when the meats he was preparing for us came in; to which he replied that Sysco came last Monday. I then asked what they were going to do about the shortages that night; to which he replied that managers and employees were being sent around to Albertsons grocery stores to buy up their meats. Are you kidding me I responded! We're paying over $300. bucks for Christmas and our meals are coming from Albertsons. He laughed and shrugged it off and kept cooking. BTW they were already out of Lobster by 2:30pm as the table behind us was being told during their introduction.

So now on to the food... The fried rice was soggy and mushy, the filet mignon was all lacking flavor; and even though prepared medium - was not tender at all! (Albertsons grade LOL). The shrimp all lacked flavor and was way overcooked, the hibachi veggies consisted solely of a mass of grilled onions. Made me think like I needed a hot dog to go along with them. The chicken was just weird and rubbery, and basically the entire holiday meal was a complete and utter joke - not to mention a waste of time. To top it all off, they forgot the 2 kids steaks; so when everyone was already eating, the kids just sat and waited like 15 more minutes to go find more steak. They probably had to get it out of the front seat of the employees car that had just gotten back from Albertsons.

To the management of Benihana; it is a sad day when I have to write such a horrific review of such a shitty holiday experience. Shame on you for not being prepared for your most important customers in Christmas day. Get your act together, and corporate best get theirs together as well; otherwise your rent will sooner rather then later far exceed your profits!

Thanks for a ruined Christmas dinner and robbing us of $300 bucks! I want to seriously forget about this shitty experience.

3770071,2017-08-12,0,ARohEoxqg8TzA5gQfdGAZw,"Service was excellent. It was a good time. And using my birthday certificate even cut the bill in half. The chef was fun and nice. The food was pretty good. And you get plenty! The wait time was a half hour but it ended up being even shorter. Overall, this is an excellent restaurant with a great location.

I am deducting one star for 3 small reasons:
1) In the past 6 months I have been to 4 other similar restaurants. The chef has performance at Benihana was the worst in comparison. This is probably due to the fact that we couldn't hear our chef over all the noise from the many other tables.
2) In comparison to other restaurants, the food is the same. It isn't anything special.
3) When we exited Benihana at about 9 pm, the Fashion Show Mall was closed. We had parked beneath and planned to shop after our meal. We are locals and even the mall near us is open past 9 so we figured the mall on the Strip would be too. For locals, it really isn't worth making a trip to that part of the Strip for dinner.

We were fortunate enough to reserve a private room that really made the experience much more intimate and special. Our server and hibachi cook were really on-point with service, being attentive making sure drinks were refilled and plates cleared out of the way as well as our hibachi chef's showmanship--always love the onion fire volcano. Not only were we entertained with the  food preparation but it was also delicious. My Hubby ordered potstickers while I enjoyed the Chili Ponzue YellowTail appetizer. Thereafter we were served soup & salad prior to our main entrees: steak & chicken for my Hubby and lobster, scallops and shrimp (Ocean Treasure) for me along with chicken fried rice. The food was excellent!! 

Our server, who had a wonderful bubbly personality, also took our picture to commemorate the evening.

First off, people were not waiting to be seated and were just taking tables, so we had to wait a bit longer. No big deal. A hostess then tells us which table to sit at and points us to it. My mom and I sit down and order two sushi rolls, two spicy chicken fried rice, and asked for two yum yum sauces. We should of been in and out within 20-30 mins but nope, we were there for over an hour. Our waitress brought us empty soy sauce, then didnt bring us yum yum sauce as we were eating one sushi roll so it ruined our experience since we wanted it for the sushi. Then after 15 minutes of asking for another soy sauce and yum yum sauce we finally get the soy sauce but only one yum yum when we needed two, but now where is our rice and other roll? The place wasn't even busy and we felt ignored. We get our rice, finally another sauce, eat it, but still waiting for the second sushi roll. This is now over 45 minutes of ordering. Our waitress also did not bring us plates or silverware and we had to ask someone else for it. As we were also waiting for the last roll to come she took one of our plates away for no reason. We need that to eat clearly so again we had to ask someone else. We talked to a manager who was great and super kind. He gave us 50% off our bill and we appreciated that a lot, but then our waitreas comes over and tries to argue with us about our order, and accused us of not waiting for a table when we did wait. She was trying to fight with us, so we told her we were done with her and went back to find a manager again. Her communication skills were awful and she does not know how to treat guests or work in a restaurant environment. I won't go back to this location because of her. The food tasted good but she is a horrible server and she is representing a brand. I do not want to eat somewhere with employees like her because she stressed me out.

Got here at 8pm on a Tuesday night and couldn't be seated until 8:30. Fine...A few drinks later, we were at our table, but a chef didn't show up until an hour later! Sitting in front of an empty grill for that long while you hear everyone else's onion choo-choo trains and birthday tambourines around you in that fragrant environment is just torture.

Our chef Dominic got everything going in short order, but seemed a little nervous as the other big party at our table had a ton of obnoxious requests for extras and particulars. Poor guy. We did ask him to skip most of the tricks so we could eat, but he did make us some twerking booty cheeks with the huge mound of rice, which was quite possibly the awesomest thing I've ever seen at a Benihana.

Got there a few minuets early and had to wait and that's fine. Got seated in the back corner and that's fine. Usually either the server and or chef ask about special occasions. The chef asked a group of ladies and it was one of their birthday. When it came to us it was , where you from ? Start to answer him and he just rudely moves onto the next group. He was also kinda short with them , then going back to the girls. The overall show was meh , didn't care for the fact that food was flying from the grill onto the table. My wife got the Chateaubriand and said she wanted it rare. The guy almost over cooked it. My wife was not happy. Then at the end they ask again about special occasions , only made sure that the girls were celebrating a birthday and the server says well you get a free ice cream , my wife says it should say it's our anniversary. I'll make sure to get a ice cream also. A group of employees sang a ""celebration song"" , gave us our bills and collected them. All the years been going to the one near home , people celebrating an occasion, they always take a photo of you to commentate it. Did that happen ?? NOPE !!! That was the nail in the coffin for us going back again. 
I guess my wife and I are spoiled with the level of service we get at the one near home. 2 stars for the food at least tasting good , what we ate of it. We never  take a to go container and my wife I did this time.",lscdjdqKU6Gp4vzX0gs9kQ,0,0,2,Gy0zLrSpN6vQzQcT0YlFcw

It may seem rather expensive, but for everything you get and for the freshness of having everything prepared right in front of you, I say it's a rather good deal. The portions are nice and generous and the atmosphere is festive. 

Thurston is AMAZING. We love how he seasons everything and we love his humor and personality. He did an amazing job at making sure our night was a memorable one. 

The one drawback to the location is that it isn't very well built for noise, and there's nothing on the walls to absorb some of the sound. It's not necessarily a ruckus, but it's just difficult to hear much farther than the person next to you from all the cooking and conversation. It's just this hum of commotion. We didn't necessarily mind it though. 

Good food seasoned and cooked perfectly. Wonderful dessert. The prices are comparable to most other restaurants like it in town. For locals, the drive is a bit of a pain, but it's worth it.

4263094,2018-01-10,2,ARohEoxqg8TzA5gQfdGAZw,"This review is mainly about service. 

We've been to this Benihana's quite a few times since they've opened about a year ago or so. We went the other day, and there was only about 3 tables in the main dining room. When we got to the hostess podium, we told  the hostess that we had a reservation for 12:30pm on Tuesday, 1/9/18. We arrived at 12:35pm, and the hostess seemed like she didn't know what to do. She had to ask her co-worker on how to work the GuestBridge system. Maybe she was still new. When she escorted us to the table, she was going to seat us to a table with no settings. I asked her, ""Are you sure this table?"" And she she said ""yes."" I said, ""There are no settings though."" Hostess seemed hesitant and then there was a server who was standing nearby, and motioned her to direct us over to the table WITH settings. 

We got seated and she gave us the menus and returned back to the hostess podium. Our server name was Sally (or so it says on our check). She seemed friendly but I think needs more training. I came to lunch with my parents and we all ordered 3 hot teas. When she came back, she handed my hot tea with her hands on top of the rim (where your mouth would touch). There IS a handle that's attached to the cup. I don't understand why she didn't use the handle, but to put her hands on top of the cup. Then when our salads came, she handed to us in a woobley motion and said ""Here you go."" She didn't use a tray (which she should have) but it looked so sloppy. She held all three salads in both hands. Awkward. 

Our food came out pretty good. No complaints about the Teppan-Yaki Chef. He just needs to smile. 

Sally came over to the table and she asked if it was going to be on one check. We barely got our food and she asked us if it's going to be on one check. Umm ok? Sally did come a couple of times to check if we needed any more hot water, etc. 

I understand that it was such a slow day! Only 3 tables total. A party of 3  ladies (behind us) was already done and there was a single lady who was nearly done as well. 
There was a couple who came in about 20-25 minutes after us, and sat across from us. I understand it was super slow. Sally was just chilling in the back by the sushi bar guys. The manager doesn't seem to care too much either. He was having some cheddar fries or hot fries (in guests view) and just chilling.  Shouldn't the manager not eat on the floor, anyway? It just looked so unprofessional. 

There was a vendor person working on something that needed all the employees's attention. Which I guess is fine. 

When we finally were ready to pay, we needed change. The bill was $51, and we gave Sally $100. Sally then says ""I need to find $9 for you."" She gave us back $40 only. She was supposed to give us $49. Who does that--give you half change back? My dad didn't wanna wait any longer, so he just said to keep the $9. She probably didn't think we were going to tip her good. Oh well that's probably the best tip she was going to get all day anyhow. 

I don't usually come here as often as much as I used to. I think the staff needs new training on how to serve drinks and utilize the trays. Managers should definitely send people home if it's super dead. It's called Labor control. Or have the staff fold napkins or do something that doesn't require personal conversations. It just doesn't look professional. Guess they just don't give a shit. Hostess needs to be trained or retrained on table numbers and the GuestBridge system.

I wanted to say something to the manager, but I don't think he would care. He was too busy eating his cheddar fries.",LcR2WZoFzgrKNi4w1xenQQ,2,1,2,GybL-KLvCG0T9khN5N_qlQ

When going out for a meal at a reputable company such as Benihana to have a dog sit at the table is poor management.  I have provided a picture of the dog so people can see what it looked like at the restaurant.  Animals should be kept at home if they want to have the pet at the table.

We had a relatively inexperienced chef cooking for us, and even though the food turned out O.K., for the price it was disappointing. She managed to drop a lobster on the floor before cooking it, so had to ask someone to bring her another one. You really pay for the show here, and even though our chef was smiling and cheerful, she didn't quite have the knife work and ""flash"" down pat to perform as well as a few of the other chefs at surrounding tables. They recognized our special occasion, and tried really hard, but unless you have never been to this type of restaurant before, save some money and have either a good Japanese, Chinese or Thai meal elsewhere, where it is all about the food, and not dependent on the skills, experience, or temperament of your chef to make your experience special (or not).",PmWZwDOp1gthUgH9Epav3g,0,0,3,329I3XCQ0ueqFCaW8xR_TQ

They will not offer you anything else to substitute for it either even though is on their menu and it says included with your meal. They want you to pay for the drink.  My daughter went to eat there with her friends last month and no one got tea either they had to pay for the drinks.  I ordered the seafood diablo and asked if I can get the yakisoba noodles instead of the udon noodles but the server said NO they can't do that.  What's so hard about cooking with different noodles?  I should of just walk out but I didn't so it was my fault. The seafood diablo didn't taste good with the udon noodles so I didn't eat it and wasted my money.

As a local I stay clear away from the strip unless we have guests in town and well based on my yelp reviews, MY HOME IS ALWAYS FILLED WITH VISITORS. So as the hostess with the mostest I decided to try Benihana again and ditch Giesha House or Ohjah (my normal go-to's) I must admit I forgot what to expect because from here because I've avoided going to the run down original location at Westgate (last time I went it was called the Hilton).

Our chef was Hans and well the food tasted great. The quality of food was delicious and onion soup was amazing! I must note the lobster was cooked to perfection and not rubbery like I've had at our places. As for our chef, he definitely lacked the entertainment of your normal hibachi dinner don't get me wrong the fried rice heart beat was beating and the volcano was there but the personality and humor was cooked right out of our chef tonight. So we lived vicariously through our neighbors table who's laughs echoed throughout restaurant.

My family and I walked off our calories across the bridge to the mini wannabe Bellagio fountain at the Wynn and listened to some old school Frank Sinatra!

We had a reservation at 7:30 and were seated before that. We were placed with the best people to sit with because everyone at our table was SO welcoming, polite and friendly. It wasn't awkward at all and really made our experience that much more fun. 

I can't remember the name of the chef cooking our food but he was outstanding! He was funny, charming and made GREAT food. They made sure to recognize my boyfriend's birthday and treated him to his choice of ice cream to end the night. 

When we return to Vegas we will be sure to come by here again!",0YO7trF9G-4dOi_uDI19xA,0,0,5,8zO68rna54s0keEgtgKdWg

Once we were seated, everything went downhill, the teppanyaki chef was obviously new which is no problem... however he cracked the egg and got shells all in the rice and continued to serve it to our group. He mistakenly gave my friends selection to another patron as well. Lastly, this location evidently decreased the portion sizes but still continue to charge 30+ for a meal which is ridiculous.... oh you also have to pay for extra sauces aside from soy.....which I've never heard of.

We came for lunch on a Friday, for the $16 Lunch duo. Your choice of two items, which comes with soup and vegetable fried rice. I totally recommend the yakisoba and calamari!

On a Friday @ 12 pm it was very slow so we had the whole table for our party of four. Very clean and modern located in Fashion Show mall on the strip side, easy access to the restaurant. The closest parking is at Fashion Show, right underneath the mall.

We had reservations and so when we arrived we were seated quickly.  The waitress was very nice and hospitable. The chef was also funny nice and good at what she was doing. The two stars I am giving however are because the restaurants restrooms were out of order and we were told we had to go inside the mall or plaza to use them. I saw the waitress speaking to the manager about it he made eye contact with me but never apologize for the inconvenience.  So after walking my son to the restroom by the time we got back our food was cold. Also the food (at least ) the beef was somewhat chewy and didn't taste good. My daughters then had to go use the restroom and again the inconvenience. So I will go back to Benihana's but not to the one in Las Vegas.  I'll try once again closer to home hopefully that goes well and I can recommend Benihana's again.,zCx8aABnoiNmHdgdLOhZHw,0,0,2,xYQqermLSFvdditRfuMvBw

I've never left any so disappointed though. The service was fine although our waiter could've been more present and the place was nicely decorated and clean, even down to the bathrooms. However, the food left much to be desired. The soup and salad were good. My shrimp was good as well. The rice, however, was hard and not seasoned well. It was also cooked first and immediately put on our plates, which meant that it was cold by the time our meat was cooked. Every other Hibachi restaurant that I've been to has allowed the rice to continue to cook while preparing the meat so as to keep it hot. Duh, right! Well, that didn't happen here. Also, the two sauces they provided were very odd. They looked to be the same as what is provided at every other Hibachi restaurant but were ultimately gross. The deep fried sushi that we ordered was also cold and not very good. This location was also hard to find (it took us more than 10 minutes of walking in circles due to their lack of a large sign.)

We start off with cocktails and it taste blahhhhh for a $12 drink!!! I've got the pineapple coconut and rum drink and it's just like drinking pineapple slash on water and rum. I had to ask them to add lime for me so I can taste some flavor

$24 for spicy chicken hibachi set. The mushroom soup that comes with, again just water + MSG

For $50 I was presented with a full 8-piece roll of moist and excellent Spicy Tuna; a huge heap of perfectly salted Edamame; Benihana Onion Soup; Benihana Salad; Hibachi Shrimp appetizer; Hibachi White Onions, Mushrooms, and Zucchini; Hibachi Chicken Fried Rice; a Samurai Treat of medium-rare Filet Mignon and Colossal Shrimp; Seafood and Meat Dipping Sauces; endless hot Japanese Green Tea, and Chocolate Ice Cream.  

The Onion Soup with Mushrooms and Green Onions was very good, as was the salad with Cherry Tomatoes, Iceberg Lettuce, carrot slivers, and Ginger Dressing.  Requested low-sodium Soy Sauce was unexpectedly presented in a white ceramic spouted dish.  A touch of class!  And extra ginger for the sushi was quickly supplied.  

The Benihana Signature Chicken Fried Rice was nicely soy flavored, and the grilled vegetables, tender Filet, and meaty shrimp perfectly seasoned.  Seating at a hibachi grill was comfortable in the sleekly modern dining room accented in red-cushioned chairs.  We sat with 6 sociable men from Germany who were staying in a penthouse suite at the Mirage.  And service by Unique was outstanding.   

Great cooking of top quality ingredients by our grill master yielded a superior teppanyaki meal.  Only too many dropped knives and missed shrimp catches prevented this from being a 5-star experience.  4-1/2 sparkling stars overall!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,4,4,JRLYgW1xm5IfS1y9325VbQ
