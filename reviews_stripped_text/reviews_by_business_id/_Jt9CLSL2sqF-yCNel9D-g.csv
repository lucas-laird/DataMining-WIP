My husband had the enchiladas and raves about them. Last but not least the fried ice cream was perfect. The service was great. I guess they have only been open a short time but I believe they will last. This is a super find.",a722YiBZUFNUCACCKsNsDg,0,0,5,spw1wXXq6bPFey4FF_bOMw

1968552,2018-06-14,0,_Jt9CLSL2sqF-yCNel9D-g,"Mexican food in general In vegas is weak. This place rocks! The portions are big and they offer more chips or tortillas. I hate being charged extra for rice in most restaurants or other trivial items. The fajitas were awesome,  best I've had in vegas. The service is on par with everything In this place from food to decor. I'll be back",1cIqftrJqI1i8yb-w26TLw,1,0,5,iKzts70irih4ZRW1KyfXXA
1968912,2018-06-03,0,_Jt9CLSL2sqF-yCNel9D-g,"Awesome food. Great atmosphere. Fantastic drinks. We sat at the bar which had a brand new shiny granite countertop which is a rarity in Las Vegas, soon to be torn up and replaced with video poker terminals unfortunately, but for now we get a front seat view to witness bartender Tara and her Tequila girls whip up all sorts of magical potions. Her award winning signature Guava margarita with jalapeño is unbelievably delicious and spicy. The watermelon margarita is truly a knockout refreshing drink. We then had several rounds of shots courtesy of the Tequila girls who raised the party atmosphere in this newly minted family sit down Mexican restaurant. The food is well prepared and delicious although a bit pricey but definitely worth it. Anyway, it's a great place with a great location on Flamingo and Jones. Don't miss out on it.",STET7OUsv-ednt-dIi0LSA,0,0,5,qlDIqBkgV8rwkMGnbHDyqA
2197504,2018-06-18,0,_Jt9CLSL2sqF-yCNel9D-g,"Yes, this place is great. We started off with chips and salsa. The taste of the different salsas and beans, were delicious. Honestly I could have just ate chips and salsa. I had the steak and lobster special for Father's Day. Both great. Tony had the carnitas and he was very happy with them also. All in all everything was top notch, come and check out this new restaurant.",oIMTRsKz-fcCbjRInZXB2Q,0,0,5,ojhkOveu84DSn_7i7S6CJw

4881832,2018-05-21,0,_Jt9CLSL2sqF-yCNel9D-g,"Amazing! Absolutely amazing food and staff! I was so impressed with everything you never would have know Casa Robles had just had their soft-opening just this week! Wednesday in fact! 

Service: The front of the house was tight, and attentive to our large party. They have a wonderful system in place and its works. I have been to many different restaurants in their soft opening week and they fail to overcome the challenges of opening a new restaurant. Casa Robles succeeded and I wish them nothing but SUCCESS! 

Food:  Since we were a large party  we were able to try almost all their appetizer offering. Oh my god, delicious  we had the Nachos (fully loaded and beautiful), Queso  Fundido (drool worthy), the Cerviche (tasty!!!) fresh guacamole dip (converted an anti avocado  person!!! I am not kidding!) my family had the carnitas plate, ribeye  (I know Mexican joint and steak...just shhhh and enjoy the perfection) and tacos ....ALL were amazing.  Everyone in our party that we spoke with all decleared hands down that this is our spot to eat from now on while in Vegas (my family traveled over 200 miles others traveled further to here for this party.) 

Adult beverages: strong and inventive...so just DRINK  20/10 you will order more than one they are that yummy! I highly recommend the Guava margarita with fresh jalapeños and for a bigger kick order with extra salted rim! The blueberry mezcal margarita (just drink and enjoy the ride!!!)

Overall worth the drive (for those visiting Vegas) and the authentic modern Mexican cuisine is utterly delicious! 

Seriously this is go to restaurant with an excellent future ahead! It is a mom and pop so support your local businesses (not the food chains) Congratulations again and we can't wait for another day when we are back to Las Vegas to eat some more yummy  foods.",cJ6Nhg6GMd7iOQKepMw-Fg,5,0,5,fGHAlncq2H2KckFChTqOIg

Today at lunch I saw the open sign and decided to give them a try. 

After entering we were immediately greeted by the hostesses, who were very upbeat and friendly. 
The menu has a lot of options and some lunch specials. I tried the carnitas lunch special. 
The portion was huge, enough that I took home the leftovers and had dinner. 
The carnitas were a 10/10, flavorful and tender, but with a nice crisp on the outside. It came with rice, beans, and some guacamole. The flour tortillas were excellent. 

Service was excellent as well 
I look forward to my next visit.",kzd8RMZKbDoZF133UjNRVA,4,0,5,gQzpWkjnKZRIE_gG5N4AKA
