35696,2017-02-16,0,1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ,We stumbled upon Pasta Idea quite by accident and am so glad we did. The staff was inviting and friendly. We ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce with some trepidation as meat sauce can often be a hit or a miss. It was a big hit and absolutely delicious. You could tell upon first bite the pasta was fresh and homemade. I ordered a single order but the portion was large enough for two people. The fresh Bruschetta was very flavorful and was the perfect compliment to the pasta. We  will be returning here often.,4jbyHLjJWRkPWwtgfDr6WA,0,0,5,QNi3RpY1pqoNKU_tCDAeaA

The first visit was great back to 3/2017 was great, I'm a big meat ball pasta fan, so I ordered their meat ball pasta with meat sauce. The pasta was great with nice flavor. 

I went back two more times after the first visit. That's when things start to go downward. I didn't get the meatballs with my order, and the portion was very small for the price. I called the manager and he promised he would make things right. 

I've decided to give it one more try, I placed my order on eat24 and noted ""please include the meat balls this time"". They did include it this time, but the meat balls were under cooked, plus I got an extra metal string as a souvenir. The 5-inch metal string looked like either from a wine bottle or a can. I almost swallowed it....

I regret to give them too many chances to fix the issue. Their kitchen needs some serious management. I give them 2 stars for the sake of the first good experience.",Xi636vyLhPJb5fRNJ9Wq7A,4,0,2,7xF3JzgYbaDFZGhkbjx60Q

Ordered through grub hub, an hour later got the food with extra bread for some reason. Opened up the food to find that their was a missing ingredient that costs us 4$ on an order that ended up being about 50$. Called them up and this woman had The audacity to admit that they forgot the extra shrimp which costs 4$ so threw in an extra bread. 1. How retarded are you to admit that right to us and just show how lazy and inconsiderate you were that you knew our order was missing something but still sent it out. Your job is literally to complete orders. And you send it out... Knowing you're missing something. Secondly, you can't replace f*ucking bread for shrimp, like seriously? And thirdly, the women offered no way to reconcile the problem we had to repeatedly ask her what she could do for us which was basically nothing since her manager wasn't there. I wonder if the manager had been there would you have actually completed the order to begin with instead of send it out half assed, get a brain. And maybe some better decision making skills.

   As some have stated, the place is very small (though it's next to a currently vacant space, so maybe we'll get lucky and they'll expand?). The atmosphere is nice. A little cozy due to the small space, but quite fresh/modern in appearance. Reminded me a lot of the pasta pomodoro near good ol' SCU. 

   Food was wonderful, although the lunch special could use a bit of work business strategy-wise. It would have been nice for our gluten-free member of they had included it as an option, even if it came at a dollar or so up-charge. It would have been nice if they included some more of the sauces at an up charge as well. 

   Price-wise it was a little on the expensive side, since we all ordered non-lunch special items. However, the quality and portions of food, along with the bruschetta was totally worth the price.

961626,2017-07-15,0,1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ,"This place is definitely one of the best restaurants you will find when in search of fresh pasta and fresh ingredients while still remaining true to authentic Italian flavor.

Being a Las Vegas native, born and raised, I figured this place was going to be just like every other Italian place. Needless to say, my husband and I were pleasantly surprised. 

We were greeted almost immediately and seated with drinks served shortly after. Our two year old child was accompanying us, and he was offered crayons and a coloring paper to keep him occupied. 

Fresh bruschetta was served immediately following. The bread itself was fresh out of the oven with a crisp golden color on the outside, and the soft, warm texture in the middle of a perfectly baked bread. The bread itself had been delicately brushed over the top with a mixture of olive oil, fresh Italian herbs, and a hint of parmesan. The herbs were so fresh that you could tell they came immediately off of the plant as they lacked that crispy, dried texture of herbs that are obtained from the store or bottled herbs. The tomato mixture of the bruschetta was served in a small separate bowl instead of on top of the bread like other restaurants serve it which prevented the bread from getting soggy. The tomato bruschetta mixture contained the same fresh herbs. The tomatoes themselves were fresh, crisp, and slightly sweet in taste. The combination of both complimented each other perfectly.


I ordered the chicken parmigiana. The chicken itself was of a high quality, tender cut with absolutely no fat or grisly pieces, evenly coated, topped with a baked mozzarella cheese blend over the top, slightly golden brown. When you cut into it, the melted cheese mixed with the perfect amount of crispy batter over the chicken was enough to keep your mouth watering. The combination of the marinara sauce set this dish over the top of any competitor. My grandfather is from Sicily, and this was the only sauce I have ever tasted in comparison to his. In Italy, the people will ONLY pick and use what is in season. It has to be perfect, and this chef chose the perfect seasonal tomato to make a fresh, sweet, marinara sauce that you can only find here. Every Italian recipe for sauce is different, but I found this one to be most like my grandfather's which will always be my favorite. Since he is no longer around, this is definitely my new Italian go to spot for pasta!

The taste of authentic Italian food differs greatly from the Americanized marinara sauces you'll find at Olive Garden chain type Italian restaurants which is why some may not like the taste, but this is authentic Italian food. For those of you who are Italian, that is hard to come by now days.

If this isn't enough to get you to visit, my husband is a fine dining chef who has worked at both the Wynn and the Paris. He has also worked in the presence of Chef Gordon Ramsay. At times I get irritated because my husband is one of the most critical, pickiest, worst people to take to restaurants because he's such a foodie snob. Even he liked the food. His only complaint was that he thought the shrimp was slightly undercooked, but enjoyed his meal (fettuccine with shrimp alfredo sauce) very much which is a huge compliment coming from him!

SIDE NOTE - THEY HAVE TO REMOVE THAT PastaIdea Radio. Or implement a function to turn it off. It turns back up on max volume when you change pages. UGH

ANYWAYS... this place is known for its homemade fresh noodles and sauces made in-house daily. There used to be a place on the SW side by Flamingo and Grand Canyon that had a similar feature but they disappeared only after 2 visits. 

PastaIdea has a ""Lunch Special"" which allows a selection from a starred (*) noodle and matched with a starred (*) sauce for $9.95 including a fountain drink and garlic bread (Available for dine in AND take out !) 

I had originally came here prior to meeting my accountant to do some taxes. I dont come to this side of town too often which was why it took me so long to visit this place. PastaIdea opens at 11am and i had came here shortly after. Located on the NW corner of Lake Mead and Buffalo, its in a small shopping center between Bucca di Beppo and McDonalds. It kind of ""hides"" in the middle of the center facing away from the parking lot but its there. 

Its a small little restaurant with maybe 5 tables seating 20 people total. Since the restaurant was empty and im not one to like to dine alone, i opt'ed to take it out to eat next to the lake at Desert Shores... xD 

Picking fettuccine noodles matched with arrabbiata sauce, they were both starred items which worked with the lunch special. As mentioned before, the noodles are fresh made as well as the sauces. The arrabbiata sauce is made with a spicy marinara and olives. The marinara is fresh and bright. The spice was a small kick but not as spicy as i had preferred. But for a nice warm day with a small breeze, it was nice. The fettuccine noodles were nice and al dente. The olives was a mix of green and black pitted olives and there was quite the generous amount. Having bursts of flavor from the olives with the generous amount of noodles and marinara, it was a good amount of food, especially for lunch. 

As mentioned before, it comes with garlic toast and a side of tomatoes mixed with chopped basil, which gives it a very refreshing, bright taste when you put it on top of the toast and eaten together. 

Second time i had came here, i had picked something not included in the lunch special (as i dont know when the next time i'd get the chance to come here, so i ""went all out in a way""). I picked the fresh cavatelli pasta this time, which are like small long pasta shells, similar to mini hot dog buns. LOL I paired the pasta with a creamy white sauce, the Veneto, with asparagus, grape tomatoes, proscuitto crudo, and mushrooms. Proscuitto crudo is essentially the typical proscuitto you are probably familiar with. Crudo means raw whereas cotto means cooked. The sauce was SUPER heavy and creamy but worked well. Grape tomatoes cut in half punched through the heaviness fairly well. Proscuitto gave it a nice ""natural"" saltiness to the bite with the earthy taste of mushrooms. My only real complaint is the asparagus was tough to eat. Had some very tough pieces so they needed a trimming. The cavatelli pasta was AMAZING. VERY al dente with its elasticity and incomparable bite. 

With the choices of 16 different noodles paired with 40 sauces, the combinations are almost endless. I would love to return to try other sauces. It does get a little pricey because of the sauce costs in ingredients they use probably, but once in a while, i think its pretty worth it.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,0,4,y1DJOqP4TQsuCJxHkDvTWw

It's for money only. When you walk in you'll stand at the cash register for quite a bit of time and the staff will walk by you without saying anything. It's pretty bad customer service I wouldn't say that they're rude but they don't try to make you feel comfortable and they don't seem to enjoy their job and there definitely isn't an Italian warm feel to the place. I got pesto spaghetti and it came out to $17 which I was a bit surprised by especially since the food is mediocre. The pesto sauce was watery and bitter like an amateur made it and although it wasn't disgusting I have to say it was by far the worst pesto sauce I've ever had. I'll be surprised if this place lasts. I read some of the other reviews and I was also put off by the fact that the owner will respond to other peoples yelp reviews in a very rude and defense of tone rather than having a genuine interest in improving the place and catering to the customers.

The restaurant is very small, has little eye appeal and even less atmosphere. Doesn't really look or feel like an Italian restaurant but looks more like a space that would be used for a coffee bar or frozen yogurt shop. The food was very good - well prepared and flavorful. But the woman that served us, although quite pleasant and helpful, was behind the counter preparing a take-out order for someone and kept putting her fingers in her mouth to moisten them to open the plastic bags to put the to-go containers in. Should a food server be putting their fingers in their mouth and then touching plates to serve to customers? It's disgusting and probably a health code violation besides.

Over time, the quality started to drop - especially the quality of the proteins (meat, chicken) - so we stopped for a while. We tried it again after a long break and found that quality had dropped even more!
The carbonara sauce we had for example, had mystery pancetta in it. All the pieces of pancetta were some strange mangled sinew and fat that once in your mouth, you have no choice but to spit it out (how gross) or gag on it! I never even knew it was possible for Pancetta to have sinew and chewy parts like that. It was Disgusting!
The Veneto sauce also seems to have suffered from cutting corners on quality of the speck in it. It also was very skimpy on the asparagus, and half the cherry tomatoes were still green!
I believe this was the last chance we're going to give them. Instead of maintaining quality or improving, they seem to be slipping into a very nasty place with questionable ingredients and no quality control.

1645762,2015-11-06,6,1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ,"I'll be the first to say it: when I drove by, pulled up the rave reviews, and visited their website, I kind of scoffed at their claims of fresh-made pasta and sauces. Noodles & Co has been doing this for years, and we already have Mac Shack as a local version- same concept for all.

But my dinner here was really pretty great- I dig the modern kitchen decor, and the service is charming with a prominent Italian accent and genuine warmth. You pick from a variety of pastas and sauces, and add on apps, salads, soups, and/or desserts if you so desire. Note that pastas and sauces/toppings are priced separately, so this can add up- it's no bottomless Olive Garden bargain. 

The mushroom ravioli ($5) was a generous portion of large, lightly-stuffed pillows. I opted for the pesto gorgonzola ($9), which was creamier than expected and quite rich. I would love to see them add a regular, robust pesto to the menu rather than just the cheesed version.

Was a bit disappointed with the caprese salad ($11)- the tomatoes were underripe and flavorless, which didn't rise to the level of the the fresh mozzarella, basil, and other vegetables. I realize they're new, but until they can get a supplier who can provide fresh, ripe tomatoes, perhaps this should be sidelined or only featured as a special.

Split the pasta and salad for a large dinner, gave the rest to my guy- along with the complimentary bruschetta that comes with each order. Giant amount of food, total was just under $30, with tip. 

NOTE: The lunch ""specials"" offer very limited, basic selection. Hopefully they will expand what is covered in this category. I currently cannot recommend it as a lunch spot, despite working nearby.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,7,4,fTE8j4HsHe828-p1-QAsVQ

I don't know if this is new ownership, but they didn't seem to know the menu well.  I'm vegetarian, so I usually get something a bit more customized, like a certain sauce, but without the meat.  In the past, they have been super accommodating and suggested which things might pair the best.  We ordered two dishes and wanted them spicy.  Took our food to go.  All four of us were truly disappointed.  It wasn't spicy at all, and it was just totally bland, with the exception of garlic.  I seriously doubt we will go back.  Another thing I really didn't like is that they had a child in the dining area watching the Disney channel on TV.  That's great that you have a family business, family restaurant, but if we were dining in, that's a big turn-off in terms of ambiance.  Granted, it was just 5:00 p.m., and no one else was dining, so maybe they turn it off when they have patrons dining in.

My order was a to go order, for the price you pay the servings are gigantic, I only ate less than half of my pasta and I'm eating the cheesecake as I write this review, seriously though, if the pasta had sucked (which it did NOT) I would still come back just for this heavenly cheesecake

There have been recipe changes and significant portion size decreases over the past several months. Specifically, sauces for dishes have turned 180 degrees in the wrong direction.  I used to look forward to their bruschetta with every order. Today they sent toasted bread with sides of marinara. Why has this place gone to crap? If you have a successful recipe (and they had many), why would you change it and affect the quality of the product?  My only guess is that the owner or manager may not have responsibly handled food costs.  But at the same time, if I'm spending $15-$18 for a simple pasta dish, at least give a decent portion.

I really like the idea of create your own pasta where you choose your pasta , sauce , and toppings like meat and mushrooms , etc. Each single one is individually priced. Maybe if I ordered the more ""dinner-type"" menu items & went all out w/ my pasta I would have appreciated the food here more but we settled with their lunch specials since we thought it would be a good deal since comes w/ drink + bruschetta for about 10$.

Lunch menu options were limited and basic in terms of pasta choices and sauces. Hopefully they will expand this category. It also does not come with any meat options (have to pay additional).

I ordered the tri color tortellini + pink vodka sauce (which is mix of their marinara sauce + alfredo sauce + dash of vodka I believe). Tortellini I liked but pink vodka sauce tasted kinda canned. I know it's really not canned but tasted similar. My bf tried the ravioli + alfredo & it was just alright to me. It also looked like I had larger portion size than his.

We ordered a kids mac and cheese, a chicken parm, and lasagna.

Lasagna: cooked perfectly. Great taste with lots of layers. My only complaint was that it was a tad bit dry... and i mean just a tad. 4.5/5

Chicken parm: it was my wife's meal and it was a big meal if i must say. Lots of great flavor and chicken cooked just right. 4/5

Mac and cheese: was absolutely delicious! I was hoping my kids didnt finish it and i was lucky enough to eat a couple bites and had the opportunity to finish it for left overs! The cheese on that though..... yummmmmm!!!

Oh! And their garlic bread with tomato dip! Wow. Yumm

Love this place. The venue is small, but cozy. Service was friendly and fast. My only complaint is the overall price. $15 -$20 for each of the adult meals and i think about $10 for the mac and cheese. 

But, I'd definitely go again!!

Keep in the mind the menu prices, its pick a pasta which costs a few dollars, then pick a sauce that costs a few more dollars.  So you add up the two prices to get your total, unlike most Restaurants with a single price.  

The Restaurant only has a few tables inside, so come early, whether for lunch or dinner.  Overall, the Pasta cooked is perfect, and they do the sauces well. The food quality is tops here, just the menu is a bit confusing.  A good place to go if you're willing to head out to Summerlin area.",eWU-UeImPPQrMDCgI7LT2w,1,0,4,ABuREe64zh1AuWomv1Fcdw

After being forced to come here by my parents, I couldn't believe how good it was. I had the butternut squash filled ravioli and it was amazing. I was shocked when I found out that the owners were from Italy and made their own pasta. It really shows in their cooking. This is the only Italian food I actually enjoy eating out.

My first visit, I had gnocchi with the creamy basil pesto. I love gnocchi so much, I've made it myself at home, and this was good gnocchi (good pesto, too). The portion was generous, and you don't just get garlic bread with the dish--it's also brought out to the table prior to your entree. The garlic bread isn't anything special or out of this world, but it's a nice addition.

My second visit, I had spaghetti with caprese ""sauce."" (It was much more photogenic than the green gnocchi, but both dishes were absolutely delicious). Again, the portion was very generous, and they boxed up leftovers for me. I had leftovers both times.

It's small on the inside, not a ton of seating, but the service is friendly and fast, and the food is fresh and yummy. I hope they do well--I know I'll be back to support them!",Ol3tOr623ZeLJYf6y5Yciw,11,2,5,dmQGVZlUywzerayiX9ibRQ

The place is quaint, clean and pleasant.  I was greeted by the owner's son who patiently explained their concept snd even offered tge lunch special pricing to me even though it was past the posted time frame.
I ordered rigatoni with arrabiatta sauce and went home.
Man was I surprised!! Take out pasta which was still warm after a 15 minute drive home. The pasta was cooked perfectly and tge sauce was the best I have tasted since keaving NJ 21 years ago. The garlic bread was soft,and warm and delivious when topped with fresh bruschetta. Don't pass on this gem of a restaurant.

So many five star things that love about this place! First foremost love seeing small business/family own restaurants succeed in Vegas. Pasta Idea is truly one of those spots in life. 

Shout out yelp family for telling me about this great hidden gem in Vegas. As in hidden if your not looking for it probably going pass by it. It depends on the direction coming from on Lake Mead Blvd. I just about passed it myself. Pasta Idea located in tiny shopping mall tucked in the corner next to Cafe Rio. In the same area with bunch of office buildings.

They have daily special board right outside. I came for lunch with another yelper Suzy H. So best things about dining with yelpers get to try lot of food!! It was my first time Suzy H second time got the low down on the menu. The thing Pasta Idea is know for is all there pasta are fresh. FRESH!!!! Sold!! The difference between dry pasta and fresh pasta are worlds apart. Outside of the strip I have not found many italian restaurants that serve lot of fresh pasta. Am sure few do serve some but all the pasta on the menu? The thing is not just your typical common spaghetti, fettuccine, etc. Bigoli, Cavatelli, bunch of different ravioli,and even gluten free fresh pasta. Truly pasta shape for everyone. Sauces. They have bunch that can choose from mix and match with your choice of pasta. Endless possibilities of pasta heaven! They do have lot of set pasta dishes on the menu. Full menu. The appetizers ordered the Prosciutto crude and fresh mozzarella appetizer. Talk about da bomb. The prosciutto was sliced perfect nice thin slices. Really could have order pound of that just go cold cut and be content in life. The mozzarella also amazing. The freshness was on point add drizzle of olive oil and seasoning. It was the perfect starter. I ordered the Bigoli with meat sauce. It was amazing. The Bigoli was cooked to perfection combine with full hearty meat sauce. The portion size is ridiculous. Unlike chain restaurants not only full portion but packed with flavor. I was surprise finish the whole plate but it was that addicting. The price. Steal of deal. Lot of the dishes are under $20 dollars. If looking for something more affordable then going out the strip for great pasta Pasta Idea. The garlic bread with the tomato bruschetta on the side. Easily the best garlic bread had in long time. Not only is the bread hot, seasoning perfect balance not garlic garlic but clearly taste other seasonings, and bread nice toasted crust when pull piece apart yay! 

Pasta Idea is tiny restaurant. Couple tables outside. I do love the art work on the walls. I love the vibe small family run business. No doubt plan on coming back because pasta combinations are endless. Delicious!!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,14,9,5,m7AxvzpgeJrEnEK5VacpGA

My wife and I went last night and sat at the little counter by the bathroom.  Not the most appetizing spot but we were ok with it.  They literally had 6 tables with us (1 big combined table) and 3 waitresses.  No one talked or looked at us for 15 minutes.  No menu, nothing.  Young kid came over and said it was his first Saturday shift and apologized.  No problem!  He took our order immediately, still no menus, but we knew what we wanted.  Brought us drinks and free garlic bread.  Fast forward one hour later still no food.  Remember 6 tables and 3 servers.  2 tables had come in after us and were DONE eating.  I finally said something and server said it will be right out.  5 minutes later another server comes out and told me they had no more gnocchi left, do I want to order something else.  I was furious told them no and wanted to talk to the manager.  They said the owner is out in the kitchen and he will be right out to explain.  Waited 3 minutes staring at owner and he never came out.  Left and will never go back.  Just read post about new owner and that explains everything.  That sucks cause this was my favorite pasta.

picked up this young man and took him and his friend downtown last night.  
we got to chatting and i asked him what he does....and he was so very proud to tell me about pasta idea, which is a place i have on my list but not yet visited.  
this young man is all about customer service on and off the clock.  i praised him for that.  

he could not stop complimenting the chef and the skills the chef has and how much the chef enjoys cooking for his customers.  this young man had me wanting to turn around to come to your restaurant at that moment....i will be there in the coming weeks for sure....

want you to know that i personally feel that you are so very blessed to have such an energetic young man on your team.  he is golden for you and your team.  

i think that we all know it is so rare these days to find someone to hire that meets ones expectation, much less exceeds them as this young man obviously does.  i did not catch his name, but he is a taller thin young man.  you and your store are very very blessed to have him inside and outside of your doors.  i look forward to my first meal at pasta idea",gw6FV2Z07axlDjWhIrczyA,1,3,5,Xkjnk42DFg1JdKppp0w6Dg

Come on now! Driving 22mls to your restaurant twice to hopefully enjoy the pasta I was craving and you messing it up twice! 
WARNING for patrons:
Make sure to visually check your pick up order before leaving, therefore you'll avoid disappointment when you get home
Update:
After expressing the issue with Carrie she immediately offer a full refund on the item that was missing and I said no need for refund but she offers an invite to make up if I'm willing to come back which I did along with my family. This time no disappointment and she was very accommodating to us and we had the pasta that I had been craving. I was solved!
Important note: this is still my go to place for pasta fix, incredibly good spaghetti, fresh taste and very reasonably priced.

The food was so tasteless; I couldn't even finish it. I ordered pasta with meat sauce because the cashier told me it was her favorite. So I thought to myself, 'Huh, meat sauce is a good place to start. It's tomatoes, meat, and seasoning, so it can't taste bad.' 

Wrong. So wrong. 

The meat sauce had no flavorful herbs; it BARELY tasted like salt and a passing breeze of one pungent herb that is simply indescribable. The sauce had almost no meat, and was so watered down that I couldn't even taste the tomatoes. 

The noodles were fresh, yes, but again, there was no flavor to help them along in the meal. 

My bread was burnt on one side, tasted mostly like butter (a twinge of garlic flavor). The best thing about the entire meal were the tomatoes in the bruschetta. The topping itself tasted sour, but the sweetness of the tomatoes saved it. 

I would've rather spent my $12 at Olive Garden.

They brought out some garlic bread to start, but I barely had time to sample it (it was good) before my pasta came out.

As they described when I ordered it, it has a strong seafood taste, which, since I like seafood, added to the dish.

I arrived Monday evening and approached the counter to order to-go. There was only 1 other couple dining in so I was approached quickly by the staff. I felt a little rushed to order as it was my first time but they were really friendly. I ended up choosing the cheese tortellini with pink sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, grape tomatoes and chicken then a nutella cheesecake for dessert. 

The wait was short and i was on my way home with fresh, hot food in about 20 minutes. 

When i finally opened the bag up i found the sauce leaked out of the paper container the pasta was in and I was missing my cheesecake! It was frustrating to clean up the meal prior to eating and I live too far away to bother returning for my cheesecake. 

The food i did eat was great - flavorful and large amount that i'll be eating throughout the week.

1) Get it to go! The restaurant is small and every time I've been there it's had a weird smell, almost like a sewer problem.
2) Skip dessert - their chocolate cake looks tempting, but when I tried it I was disappointed that it was pretty dry and had that refrigerator taste to it. Oh well, that just means you have more room for pasta!

Now this is a pasta place so dont come in here if your looking for chicken parm or veal but the pasta speaks for itself. Everything comes with a slice of garlic bread which is nice because bread always pairs well with pasta. I tried four different types of pastas and found a seafood one to be my favorite.

She came back with the waters and one drink and had to go back for the other. While we were waiting for our food we watched what was going on. The waitress messed up the order on the table next to us, and the other person working there came over to our table with someone else's order. This happened a few more times with others orders. It was like they could not remember who got what. Got our food finally, wife got the  Bigoli noodles with meat sauce which she said noodles were a little chewy and sauce not tasty. I got the regular noodles with meat sauce and meat balls, noodles a little chewy and sauce seemed ok but different then the meat sauce my wife got. Meatballs were small and not very tasty. Food was not very hot when served to us.
So we tried it and will not got back because of service, taste and price. All items are al carte which adds up. 
We will stick going to Mezzo Bistro which is about same price or cheaper and the meatballs are the size of a baseball and has good service and larger tables.",WSJJF_FyRz0osgBQgndlDg,0,0,2,W3q2Fq51mxtYNwvod80HKA

My family and I decided to come eat here and see what my mother was raving about. The place is very small with very limited table seating.
Lucky for us when we arrived there was a table available. 

You start off with your choice of pasta then pick your sauce. Or you can get one of their specialties pastas. 
First they bring out this amazing garlic butter toast bread with a pesto sauce of some sort to dip in. 
I had two entrees because I couldn't choose between the mushroom Ravioli and Spaghetti with Red Diablo sauce. Also because I'm a fat ass.
Anyways, both pastas were delicious but the spaghetti with Diablo sauce was the winner.
Sauce was spicy, savory and delicious. 
My Mother had the Chicken Parmesan. 
Niece loved the Shrimp fettuccini Alfredo. 
And my Father had the #38, Shrimp and Scallops Fra Diavolo. 

The owner and young lady working were both  super sweet. Very attentive on making sure we didn't need anything. My parents loved it so much they're already talking about going back.

I and and a family member have been waiting 15 years to find spaghetti bolognese (with meat sauce) this fabulous.  I didn't dine in, but had leftovers the minute they came in the door. It was nothing like the 'pasta soup' I so often receive, but just as pasta should be.  The sauce stuck to the pasta, with plenty of meat in the dish.  It was not your usual bowl of tomato paste or sauce, but meat sauce and pasta ""married"" so to speak.  It was ordered, ""dry, not watery"" but I don't know if it was prepared any differently because of that.

They strictly serve pasta here. No fried foods/appetizers so ya'll gonna have to get your calamari fix elsewhere. The four of us shared a cioppino, the pink diablo, lasagne, and a chicken alfredo, all with spaghetti pasta. They don't have linguine, but their spaghetti is similar to linguine. Portions are pretty generous. The pink diablo sauce was definitely the highlight with its smokey and spicy flavors. I would ask for less pepperoncini next time though, because it kind of overpowered the flavor of the pasta. Cioppino was pretty good along with the chicken alfredo. All the pasta was a little chewier than I would have liked, and the lasagne was ok, not the best that I've had. However, because they offer so many options, I am willing to give them another try.

They offer many varieties of fresh made pasta and let you pick the sauce you want. There are about 40 sauces to pick from. They can even customize. For example, I wanted the Amatriciana but on the menu it said that it was spicy but they are able to make it mild. The table next to us ask for no cream in one of the sauces and they were able to accommodate that as well. 

The baked butternut squash ravioli was recommended to us and it was amazing. The filling was smooth and creamy with just a hint of sweetness. I would go back just for that!

Chicken parmigiana was good too. The spaghetti that came with it was delicious!

We didn't know how big the portions are so ended up ordering a 3rd dish for the 2 of us. Bigoli with Amatriciana sauce. You can probably guess we weren't able to finish and had tons of left overs which they were really kind to pack up for us as well.

Pastas are made fresh every morning and the flavors and execution are better than what can be found at most sit down establishments off the Strip. There hasn't been much buzz about this spot, but it's a restaurant worth checking out. While small, it's good for families and a quick bite.

Check the board for daily specials, like the fettuccine diablo ($14) full of bold flavored sausages, pepperoni, pepper and sundries tomatoes lightly covered in a pink vodka sauce. Their menu has a list of specialty pastas, as well. One is baked butternut squash ravioli ($14.95), with equal amounts of sweetness and savoriness and covered in a layer of blistered cheese. 

You can build your own pasta dishes, but their pricing structure is a little awkward. You choose your pasta (there are over a dozen options priced between $4 and $10 each), then choose your sauce (over 3 dozen types from $4 to $12). I loved the pesto gorgonzola, but the gnocchi I paired it with was rather thick and dense.

The place is very small, only 6 tables. The owner (I think) greeted us right when we walked in, and the place was busy with guests dining in and picking up for takeout.  The decor is nice and clean, you can tell attention to detail is important to the owner. They have a server come to your table rather than order at the counter and sit down. Hunter was our server, very attentive and knowledgeable (thanks!)

Let's get to the food, everything is fresh here. The pasta & sauces are made in house, and delicious! Portions are filling, there's enough to take some home.  The rigatoni with pesto & gorgonzola was flavorful. The cioppino over fettuccine was my favorite, a seafood medley of deliciousness! My only gripe: the snow crab comes with shell, so be ready to get a little dirty :)

Fast forward a month later... we finally made it in. Tuesday October 3  at about  4p.m.
Walked in and wasn't greeted . But the young girl who was behind the counter let us know that they do not make their own pasta fresh! We asked her where does it come from? She said she didn't know just some company.?  I hope the owner realizes that we left because of what she said. And she really didn't seemed concerned at all. She just said bye!.
I can buy pasta at smith's down the street. I was really disappointed because I was looking forward to what the first guy told me a month prior that they make their own pasta in the a.m

There are too many choices, because every single one sounds delicious, but somehow we honed in on our pasta/sauce combos pretty quick. The waiter was friendly and helpful, answering questions and providing tips when requested (he eats the food there). 
The toast with fresh bruschetta was delicious (breads not fancy, but the bruschetta made up for it!)

The pasta came out pretty quickly, was hot and exquisite. Daughter got tricolor cheese tortellini with creamy basil pesto. Husband got bigoli (awesome thick spaghetti, that reminded me a bit of German spaetsle in texture) with carbonara, and I got butternut squash ravioli with the Veneto.

Why three stars and not higher?  Because it's pricey in my opinion for not being a sit down type of place.  Ya pick your pasta for one variable price and then your sauce for another variable price.  Again, eating goodness but I actually went, ""damn!"" On the price.

4147023,2015-12-12,1,1WBVqmo7tgF0z0eGf4fPhQ,"I came here with a friend the other night to give this new hot spot a try. Homemade sauces and homemade pasta sounded good  to me.

Here at Pasta Idea, your possibilities for dinner seem almost endless. You have the ability to make your dinner what you want it to be. Start by selecting one of the many homemade pastas (around 10 I think). Next, chose your sauce. There are red sauces, pink sauces, white sauces, creamy white sauces. Its maddening when you're hungry and everything looks good. 

I settled on papardelle pasta with arrabiatta sauce. The pasta, wider than fetuccini but not as wide as lasagna, was very much al dente and maybe could have used a minute more in the water. My opinion of course. Still, it was delicious. The arrabiatta sauce was amazing. A fresh and spicy marinara loaded with olives. There was just enough spice to get my sinuses working overtime. The olives were rather strong tasting. Very briney. I would have preferred them to be chopped and tossed in the sauce more. Again, just my opinion. The people who run this place are from Italy and probably know what they are doing.

I also had a couple of pieces of garlic toast. One piece I had before my meal came out. It was served with a tomato dressing. Chopped tomato and garlic. Like a bruscheta I guess. That was good. The second piece of bread was served with my pasta amd was perfect to sop up the sauce.

Pasta Idea has a lot going for it with the whole fresh pasta and sauce technique. A freshness that you can most certainly taste. What is working against them is location. They are in a tiny corner suite of a strip mall and they cannot be seen from the street. In fact, I could not even see them from the parking lot. I had to get out and walk around to find them. But if you are in the NW and looking for good Italian food, do yourself a favor and find Pasta Idea.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,2,4,4lfqHtHDayjmtYdOtUK97A

I had their GF fettuccine. It was carelessly cooked (noodles stuck together like if you don't stir them), and a little more al dente than I'd have liked. Flavor was subpar, consistency was a little odd....it was somehow both undercooked and falling apart. Barilla does it better. 

Also, they served a breadstick with my GF pasta. *eye roll* If I were more severely averse to wheat I'd have sent it back.

She insisted on making another one but we said no, it's fine we don't want it. She replies you can't do that. She then takes the food to the back. When we were finished with our meal, she hands us our receipt and said we had to pay for the pasta we didn't eat. I refused to pay for something we didn't eat but she kept insisting we pay.

I mean seriously not good. The reviews are extremely misleading. Which leads me to the conclusion they are all from family members and friends. 

We ordered four different dishes and didn't like any of them. Their signature chicken parmigiana had very little taste. The kids Mac and cheese tasted like warm milk and the sauce was about as thin. My son wouldn't touch it. The best dish we had was the pesto pasta with Gorgonzola, it had some good basil flavor but lacked seasoning. We had a little bit of each and then fed the rest to our dog. :( $50 down the drain. 

After finding the food to be so lack luster and the reviews not a good representation of said food, I feel taken advantage of, never how you want to feel after eating out. Fool me once, Pasta Idea.",3CMrY1qnGDoTbclTEp7v9A,6,0,2,EoDvIOD_-yID6fhTn4Yr8A

Most of the sauces come with meats and/or veggies in it. The menu makes it simple to pick what you want by dividing the sauces up by the base. Everything tastes pretty fresh. They give you garlic bread with a tomato spread that I could eat foreverrr but had to stop myself so I had room for my main dish. I tried the pappardelle pasta with imported porcini mushrooms and prosciutto crudo. The sauce itself was a little bland but the prosciutto provided the saltyness it needed. Definitely add black pepper. I also tried spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce was really tasty. Meatballs were juicy and so tender on the inside. The sauce also comes with meat chunks in it as well.,cLFOKo3WRtsK4oB6yAPw8A,1,1,4,wUqI3JjiwRfkYrP2f79SDQ

This was my second time here. I got one of the specialty menu dishes - the butternut squash ravioli with speck and mushrooms in a 5 cheese sauce. SO GOOD. I definitely recommend this dish! I mean, it was the dish that I ordered the first time that made me come back today. :) Also, they give you a plate of bread, with tomato in a bowl if you wish to add that on top. YUM! Writing this review is making my mouth water. Haha! Okay, back to the review...

Service here is amazing. The waitress and waiter are always stopping by to see how we're doing and if we need anything. It's a pretty small space for a restaurant - about 4 tables that fit 4 people (5 if they add a chair to the end) with a couple 2-seaters, if I remember correctly. Then there's also outside seating too. If you have a big group, definitely recommend calling ahead so they can put the tables together and reserve them for you. That being said, once the kitchen starts cooking a bunch of dishes, it gets a little hot inside the restaurant.

If there was, it was undetectable. After three bites, I just gave up. Sadly, the chicken was undercooked. I would understand if they had just recently opened, but that wasn't the case. To add insult to injury, with tax and tip it was almost forty dollars. As the food was to go, I couldn't even return it so that they could recook it.

They make the noodles in house and I'm a sucker for fresh pasta! Then there is a large amount of sauce choices. They also have a chaulkboard outside with specials and they do a lunch menu too.

I have a few favorites; I enjoy their pink sauce quite a bit and tend to lean more often than not to order something with it. It's definitely my favorite pink sauce out there. My two favorite combinations is fettucine with the Pink Diablo sauce (pepperoni,sausage, pepperoncini,sundried tomatoes) or pappardelle with the mushoom proscruitto cream sauce. I generally have liked everything I've ordered though! The only thing I was neutral about is the fra diavolo seafood pasta and meatballs. Their portions are hefty here so you will either get the itis eating it all or have enough for another meal. I admit to having had breakfast spaghetti a few times. 

The gals here are super sweet to boot. I have come here only once on a weekend and found it crazy packed since theres only like 5 tables so I tend to eat here weekday nights. 

If you love a hearty satisfying pasta meal, this is a great bet for quality, portion and friendliness!

The service was amazing, he got me bread with in a minute that I was there. I didn't think I was going to have an amazing experience due to the place being small. I honestly think they should come up to centennial hills where it much needed. Quick and fast homemade pasta. 

I have the lobster ravioli with Alfredo sauce which it was only $18 pretty cheap, my girl had the chicken. Garlic sauce. 
With a noodle I never heard before. Bugoli, it's pretty thick noodle. Their claim, they're the only ones in town with it. Might be true cause I never seen it.

The best thing is the portions! They are quite large for the price. I was especially impressed with the seafood dish, it had crab legs and clams I believe. Lots of seafood and pasta for about $20 bucks! The pasta is delicious. My chicken Alfredo had lots of chicken too. I'm used to having to ration it out to have enough sauce and noodles.

Whenever I'm in the area or whenever I'm craving pasta (which is pretty much all the time) I love to go to Pasta Idea, especially for their lunch special. It's $9.95 for a create your own pasta (only the ones with a * next to it are eligible) plus a drink and garlic bread with a side of tomatoes and chopped basil. Keep in mind that if you aren't dining here for lunch, the pastas can be a bit pricey BUT the portions are so huge so you can definitely share with another person! They also have delivery through Eat24 and BiteSquad if you just want to eat in but still get your pasta fix! 

For lunch I recommend their pink vodka sauce with spaghetti noodles or their caprese with their cheese ravioli! We usually get those two and always end up super full at the end of our meal. 

The space is pretty small so not ideal for huge groups but I'm sure they can be accommodating since I saw a huge group of 10 today when I picked up my order. Their customer service has always been great (I really miss those two sisters that worked here, haven't seen them anymore though :/) but today it was even more awesome since the guy was able to expedite my order because he knew I was in a rush despite how busy they were! 

Love how their pasta and sauces are handmade and always fresh with authentic Italian chefs behind the kitchen! It's definitely a nice difference from the typical ""Olive Garden"" or other chain restaurants.

We just had to finish it all as it was so good and for only $10.95. WOW!  Our server brought us some fresh bread with bruschetta which was a nice touch.  We were getting full already. We each ordered a pasta dish which we soon discovered was to much as week took half of it home for Monday's lunch.  I had the pappardelle puttanesca.  I have not had fresh pappardelle since chef Marc's Parma was open and he only made it special. This is on the menu every day! The puttanesca sauce was fantastic with black tangy olives, nice large capers and small salty slices of anchovy in a fantastic tomato sauce.  The other guys both choose spaghetti with garlic lovers sauce and flavored chicken alfredo sauce.  We all shared each others dish and were more than happy with the flavors.  Even though this is a 30 minute drive for us it is well worth it to drive for a fresh meal like this.  The sauce and pasta combinations are just limitless with this concept.  It is a very small mom and pop place but it is bright and cheerful and the owners take good care of you.  The 3 of us ate for $60.02 including the tax and before the top.

Enjoyed and looking forward to returning to try other pastas.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,1,0,4,kzP6V_76qfuLRutI2FWB-w
