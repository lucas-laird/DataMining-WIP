Flavor was ok, not great. But too watery that felt more like an stew , instead of an stir fry.
Portion size for that $5.99 lunch special didn't satisfy me . I wish they had charge me $1 or $2 more and give me a decent portion.

Service was pleasant and friendly.The place looked clean. I will probably be back to try something else, but I dont think I will be getting their Mongolian Beef again.",HQ3aAq6SWVm0jOxbRnqUEg,0,0,3,sXLqBpjsO0Ri8jGCaauCdA

992058,2018-01-19,0,caKRXynM5bY922pGtQhvfQ,Food is amazing. Yes their portions are on the smaller side but I would rather sacrifice size for substance any day. It's better to have a small bowl of high quality authentic Thai food than a giant portion of crap that you will probably throw away after it's been in the fridge for a few days. I personally like the smaller portions because it allows me to buy a few dishes and sample all of them. It's really difficult to find an authentic Thai place (I'm from Thailand) and I'm glad one opened up on this side of town.,rhbNL_ajHGU4HmF29-qUMA,0,0,5,oPGy_ZWqow0tosFzRwTMZA

1145322,2017-08-21,0,caKRXynM5bY922pGtQhvfQ,"One of the best thai place in North Las Vegas. We were browsing yelp and saw that they just opened up. Went to order a bunch of food from yelp 24 and our food was ready in 20 mins. Upon arrival to the restaurant, we noticed that we forgot to order some dessert so we added two boba tea. They were so nice to give it to us for free since we ordered a lot. 
Servings are pretty huge. Come here hungry or just come and have a lot of leftovers for the next few days. 
My personal favorite is the duck curry - Authentic taste and very delicious. 
The staff are very friendly and they make you feel comfortable like you are in your home eating your mom's cooking. They asked us where we're from, where we live and we told them that we live on base which basically is across the street. They said that they will deliver up to the gate (since they can't come in on base) and that makes it easier and faster to get food. Just call them and tell them to deliver your food in front of the gate and they'll be more than happy to deliver it to you warm and fresh. 
This will definitely be our hang out / late night craving, getting sober spot.!

The side entrance makes it hard to spot from Craig Rd. Inside you'll find a total of 5 tables for dining in. So how's the food? Good. I had the Pad See Ew which was yummy although I asked for it to be medium spicy and it wasn't spicy at all. My friend had the lunch special BBQ pork which was also good. We started with the pot stickers (over fried and hard) and the scallion pancakes which wasn't a pancake at all. It was big puffy pastry triangles that were tasteless. Skip both of these appetizers. Overall the food was good with the exception of the appetizers. The service was fast and friendly.

I didn't quite feel like crying after having the food like one other reviewr mentioned, but I could definitely understand where that sentiment comes from. This place is authentic and you can tell they use the proper and best ingredients. 

I think people have started to hear about the great food because by the time we got there, the tables they had were already filled. It's a small, hole-in-the-wall type of place with about four tables inside. They market themselves as a take-out place, likely because they can't house many people inside. We came in with another group ahead of us who took the last table, but we were happy to take our food to-go. The girls who took our order mentioned that it make take a bit of time to get our order out, which was appreciated. The food took about 20 minutes to get to us, which is a wait but it was worth it.

Honestly, I would wait however long it would the chef to make the meal. If they told me it would take 30 minutes, I wouldn't complain. It's that good. It's also very well priced. Perhaps too well priced. They could easily get me to pay more for the meal. Tip this restaurant!!

2716939,2017-08-31,0,caKRXynM5bY922pGtQhvfQ,"What a pleasant surprise to see this cool little Thai eatery appear on Craig Road, just a short distance west of Nellis AFB.

The staff appears to be the same few people each time.  They're so kind and seem genuinely happy to greet every customer as they come in.

Narong's is not a big place and has somewhat limited seating, but there's enough for several groups of two or four, and they're very willing to move tables together to accommodate a larger party.

The lunch specials are tasty and diverse enough that you'll find something you like, and the larger menu is definitely full of Thai favorites.  You're not limited to the specials at lunch, so wade in and find what you like.  The couple dishes I've had so far tell me I'm going to like the entire menu.

My first visit I had the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) and a Thai Tea.  My next visit I had the Pad See-Ew (and a soda).  Both dishes were delicious, nothing was very served very spicy, and there are the typical racks of sauces and peppers on the tables to share.  I'm sure if you don't see what you want, they'll bring it to you if they have it.

The price and portions are definitely right on target:  you get enough to feel satisfied without emptying your wallet.  You can also order food to go, and it appears they participate with Uber Eats.  (They had the bags behind the counter.)

Parking is somewhat limited and a little awkward since there's an old self-serve car wash right in the middle of the lot.  People seem to park in there though, as well as along the wall to the south side of the lot.  Don't miss that there are also several spots right in front of the restaurant alongside the wall of the carwash.

My boyfriend told me about this place when he came here with a couple friends. We came here for dinner with our cousin and his baby. I'm surprised with the size of this place. They only having a seating capacity of 16, so you can imagine how small it is. They are well decorated inside and out. They put a lot of details and thoughts to not only the interiors, but also the food. We ordered fried garlic rice, a side of cucumber salad, chicken satay, pad see ew, steamed chicken with ginger rice, and garlic chicken rice plate. 

I can literally eat pots and pots of their fried garlic rice. It is soooooo amazing yet super simple. It packs so much flavor. Even the baby loved the rice. The cucumber salad was delicious and well dressed. Just everything was well seasoned and scrumptious. I definitely ate sooo much that I had no choice but to take food home. And the best part was that all that food only cost us $35. We ordered three entrees, three apps and two hot teas. What a steal!!!

Couple things I noticed were missing from the dish that would've made it better was peanuts as a garnish. Also they didn't ask if I cared for a specific spice level. Most Thai places I've been to normally asks but I made due with the spices and jalapeños on the table.

It's not located in the safest area of Craig Road, but it's right across from the military housing if that makes you feel better lol. Parking is small but you can park in front of the restaurant closer to the car wash. When you walk in the place is surprisingly clean and cozy with modern decor.

We ordered
-combo pad see eu 
-chicken pad Thai
-thai tea
-garlic rice
-beef jerky
-chicken satay

Everything was delicious! The Thai tea was the best, made nicely and not too sweet for my taste. For apps we had the garlic rice, beef jerky, and chicken satay. I would come here just to order the garlic rice, it's my favorite thing ever and I could eat a whole bowl of it (no raaaagrets). Also doesn't hurt that it's just as good as Nittaya's garlic rice except for half of the price ($3.95 for a bowl at Narong's). I enjoyed the beef jerky it was chewy (not in a bad way) and flavorful. I didn't have a lot of the chicken satay but my friends said it was good. They use a chunky dipping sauce for it here, and the cucumber salad it comes with is refreshing. For entrees we shared the pad thai and pad see eu. They were both good! I usually never order pad see eu because it is too sweet of an entree for me, but theirs was not that sweet. I liked the way the cooked their noodles too. The pad thai was good I got a level 4/10 and it had a good kick to it. We were too full for dessert but next time I'll make sure to have room.

Narong's has some great reviews and it was around the corner from our hotel so we decided to give it a try. It's definitely a hole in the wall from the front, but cute and quaint with friendly service when you walk through the door. This place was AMAZING! We live in LA where there is some great Thai food back home, but Narong's blows them all out of the water. Not something I expected out in North Las Vegas, but definitely a highlight of our trip. 

We had potstickers, which were flavorful and perfectly sauced. The combination drunken noodles were fantastic and perfectly seasoned. And the chicken yellow curry was outstanding. I could have drank the sauce straight out of the container. I got a check-in for a free Thai iced tea but it was forgotten, so I can't give my opinion on the tea. However I am willing to overlook this small oversight because the food was impeccable and the service fast and friendly. Maybe next time I'm in the area I can give my opinion, because If I'm ever in the area, I will definitely be back. 

There's a military discount available if you pay cash, so be sure to ask if you are military. Discount or not, the prices are good. There were some reviews saying the portions were small, but I didn't find that to be the case. We have leftovers of everything but the rice. If there's anything that was a small portion, it was the rice, so maybe order extra if you get a curry.

 My boyfriend got the massaman curry and it was also perfectly executed! Spice level 5, chicken and shrimp. Fuego! So delicious! The coconut helped tame some of the sweet heat, but again it wasn't overpowering and I was grateful he let me have a bite before inhaling it.

Tofu Tom Kha soup is flavorful and delicious.
Chinese broccoli with crispy pork also very good.
I'm a small person so did not have room for dessert, will try it next time.
Servers very attentive and did not disappoint. Packed up my leftover instead of just bringing out boxes and letting me do it myself like so many other asian restaurants.

When I walked in I was a bit weary of this place. It's small, casual looking and located in a not so fancy area.  But the food and service made me quickly decided I will be back again.

5228698,2017-09-18,0,caKRXynM5bY922pGtQhvfQ,"I'm super torn about this review.  Ridiculously torn.

We had seen Narong's was open a few weeks ago, but hadn't thought to stop in until Friday after work.  I was driving home, and my husband said ""Why don't you stop in and see how their prices are, and then we'll have dinner?""

So I popped in.  
The location is tiny tiny, but even being small, its very open, and very clean.  

Service was top notch.  Very friendly and helpful when I asked questions.  

The menu has a lot of variety, but wasn't overwhelming, and we ordered 2 entrees, 2 Thai teas with boba and a soup for $28.    

The food was delicious. 
We ordered: 
Shrimp pad thai
Masaman curry
duck noodle soup

The pad thai was textbook delicious.  Perfect textures, shrimp was cooked well, and it was so flavorful.  

the curry almost made me cry it was that good, especially compared to my last curry experience.  They made it to order, not super spicy, which made me happy. 

The duck noodle soup was so rich and delicious.  I wasn't crazy about the texture of the skin, but the duck breast meat was SO good.  

The Thai tea was great too:  fresh and perfect boba, sweet, rich tea...I'd stop in there just for a tea.  

The problem I have is with the portion sizes.  
Usually, other places that we've ordered from, 2 entrees will feed two of us a couple of meals.  
The curry container was half full.  We only had a small scoop of rice for 2 people...we actually had to make more rice when I got the food home.  The pad thai had 6 shrimp, and where we normally can get 4 meals out of the pad thai from other places, we only had 1 serving each of this one.  

So...as I said, I'm super torn on the number of stars to give this place. The quality and flavors were there, but its disheartening to pay the same amount as another spot and get half the food.  

We will still come back, the quality was definitely better than we've had in a long time.  And to be honest, I'd rather pay for quality food...but seeing a half full container of curry was disheartening...maybe if they got smaller containers it wouldn't be so disappointing.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,9,3,3,xwbO-YEbQHsqYcujGMIhrA

The exterior is more than sketchy due to the location next to an abandoned car wash. The plus side is we had covered parking inside the car wash stall :). The interior is actually very clean and quaint, a stark contrast to the exterior. The menu is super affordable given the highest priced item is $9.95.  The lunch specials are super cheap and come with entree, egg roll, rice and soup if you dine in.   I opted for a chef's special, fried pork belly with fried rice.  This was heart burn worthy and delicious.  The pork belly was tender and crispy on the outside.  The Thai dipping sauce paired extremely well with the pork belly and the fried rice was flavorful. Limited seating and I hear the wait can be a little long for orders.  We called in our order to save some time. Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get a free Thai ice tea.

5517417,2018-05-14,1,caKRXynM5bY922pGtQhvfQ,"You know what, I give this place 5 stars! Why?
This has to be one of the best Thai restaurant this side of town offers. They are inexpensive, BUT consistently delicious! For the price you pay, you cant ask for more. Saves me and the family travel time for sure! It's literally a hole-in-the-wall joint next to a tattoo shop. But they're good. With all that in mind...yeah, 5 stars. Customer service isnt PHENOMENAL, folks, but it's consistently perfect! How are you? Refills? Do you need anything? Etc...all with a smile. Boom. I did, however, experience a phenomenal moment. 

One day, their system wasnt processing correctly. Before we drove off, I checked our acct because I was worried as much swipes our card had been swiped in those minutes before realizing their system was an issue...I just had to be sure. That was a $45 trip, yall. There ended up being 2 pending charges on my acct. So I went back in. One of the owners said it shouldn't actual post. In the event it does, please contact them. I checked out acct a couple days later.to find, indeed, it posted twice. So we returned. I showed a screen shot of the charge and the same owner was soooo apologetic and so helpful. He gave me his phone number, his email, and assured me he will get it handled. Longer story shorter...he got it handled and I got my money back. He even sent me a screenshot on their end of their bank processing it. Never in my life have I experienced such prompt service such as that. I felt as if he was EAGER to give me my money back and valued me as a customer. 

That alone sealed the deal and why we enjoy eating there. Supporting small.local businesses. Sure it isnt in the most aesthetically looking neighborhood, parking can be grim especially during lunch hour...but their food has never failed us. The interior is cutely decorated with obvious Ikea products, bathroom isnt filthy, and though it isnt verrrry spacious in there...it's ""spacious"" enough for the 6 of us... and honestly been here more times than I've actually checked-in. 

If you are rolling deeper than 6...I suggest giving them a call to check what the seating situation is like. Also, free thai tea with yelp check-in? Spiffy!! Just make sure to show them your yelp check in offer as they tend to do all the clicking of redemption, etc...

Lunch specials are a steal. Note, if you take your lunch special to-go the soup does not come with it. 

Speaking of space, it actually is pretty stroller friendly. Also, they do have high chairs! Highly recommend!!

Enjoy!

Advice: never review a business based on food you had delivered to you. There's a travel period, folks. The food will not be the same as it is when seated then served. Just saying.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,8,5,5,Q6mBo-mGy6nB3NZO2ao__g
5593568,2018-05-11,1,caKRXynM5bY922pGtQhvfQ,"I don't remember who introduced us to this nearly legitimate hole-in-the-wall (as it's adjacent to an.. autobody shop? a car wash? I don't even know...) but I need to find them and thank them profusely. This place is the best and most authentic Thai food in North Las Vegas or away from The Strip that I have found so far. We had Thai visitors with us and took them here, and if they called it authentic, I'll take their word for it. 

Now on to the food. I'm going to skip past the Pad Thai, Fried Rice, and Thai Iced Tea, because 1) we all know it's delicious and 2) they do it just as delicious. Some of my personal favorites: 

Fried Pork Belly & Rice: Simple dish, exactly as it sounds, with a few dipping options but honestly it's pretty damn good 'au naturel!' The pork belly is a really balanced mix of meat with the richness of the fat of that area, so don't think of bacon or pulled pork - this is unique in itself and SO good. It has a perfect combination of thick crunch, chew (both meaty and fatty), and the melty-in-your-mouth richness that animal fat does. Couple that with rice as your level base, and you've got a pretty darn good meal right there.

Mango Sticky Rice: Anyone that hasn't tried this yet needs to go find some, NOW. This is a uniquely Asian dish (to my knowledge), using short grain rice, soaked overnight (the actual process escapes me), steamed, sweetened with coconut milk or something.. and then you add ripe mango with that and sweet milk (condensed milk? coconut milk? sorry guys, culinary fail today) but regardless, the tangy sweetness of the fruit with the bulk and chew and more subtle and level sweetness of the rice - it's really divine. Oh, and the rice really is quite sticky; don't try to cut through this with cheap plastic cutlery - it's not going to work.

Give these guys a try. The staff, food, and service are authentic to Thai values, and I'm just beyond glad they are within such a close proximity to work.",NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg,1,1,5,TgLcQyq3IhGedZ-XouhIbA

The parking lot was full (it is VERY small) so we had to park across the street. The service was decent for a small hole in the wall place. The guy running the front brought our drinks and took our orders pretty quickly. Since I have a love for Pad Thai I decided to order the chicken pad Thai from the menu. It was good, not spectacular, but good. It did feel a little bland at parts in the dish especially since I had to mix in the bean sprouts and peanuts myself, but maybe that is because a lot of people don't actually like those. The main reason for my 4 Stars was the dryness of the chicken in the dish, I wish it had more sauce to take the dry edge off. Other than the place definitely feeling hole in the wall out of date it was good. I may be back if I am in the area again. Especially given the reasonable price. My Pad Thai dish was under $10.
