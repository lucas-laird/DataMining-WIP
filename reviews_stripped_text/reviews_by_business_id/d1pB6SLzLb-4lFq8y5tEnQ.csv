Also when we told them that it was really burnt and we can't even put that in our mouths, they said that it was normal!!! And when we told them to give us another plate, they took it back and didn't even grill another one for us. They flipped it over and served it to us again.

The food is OK for Soon Tofu Jigae joint. I had the Pork version and was not too disappointed. The soup itself was hot, but a little under seasoned. The egg is added to the soup in the kitchen and not in front of the guest. The rice was a little on the over cooked side, but what I didn't like was the crispy rice congee that's usually given at the end of the meal.  The banchan was ok, but a little on the small side. 

Overall, the value of this place was ok, not too bad. Service was pretty attentive and was always ready to serve. The reason for the 3*'s and not 4 was just the little details of the food. But overall I would check it out again.Maybe next time I'd try the some of the bibimbop dish.

So when I came to Vegas, we decided on Kroean food for dinner, but I wanted some warm goodness in my tummy.  So we were on the hunt for good soon du bu, and wah-lah!  We found Mr. Tofu on Yelp!

We arrived early (just before dinner) so they weren't busy at all. We each had a bowl of soon do bu and one side of Kalbi (two pieces).  The soon du bu was delicious and definitely made my tummy happy.  It came boiling hot.  They already cracked the egg in there for you before they brought it out.  I'm used to cracking my own egg inside for the fun of it.  The combination came with beef, pork, and seafood (shrimp, mussel, and I forget).  The kalbi was good too.  Just average meat, average taste.  I came more for the soon du bu.  

We had 5 dishes of ban chan.  Kim chee, spicy squid, choi sum, zucchini, and turnip.  All good, especially since they didn't have beansprouts (which I really don't ltke!).  Wait staff was very friendly and asked if we wanted more ban chan.  They refilled our ban chan twice, some 3x!  They also kept refilling our water.  

Great service, delicious food, and easy on the wallet too.

You can choose your own spiciness. If you like something hot and spicy, Please try this place and ask for Extreme Hot. It is the best. 
Price is very low. maybe cheapest in vegas. They give you clean side dishes, tea, rice, and stew for 8 something dollars. 

Service, not the most friendliest but they do what they have to do.

I always go here with new/old friends, family, or with my date for comfortable meal. 

Eventhough it is not the most elegant restaurant, I go here because it is Always Clean, you get your private space between tables. not a long wait. Food and dishes are very clean. The owner is very friendly.

Mr. Tofu is my absolute favorite, and I've been to quite a few tofu soup places like Tofu Hut, Mashisoyo, or Cho Dang in Irvine, California. This place is so awesome because the broth is so flavorful. Even if you take out the spicy seasoning, it still tastes awesome! 

I went there the other night and their prices had gone up since the last time I was there. Sad, right? But it was still delicious! The pork soon tofu and the beef soon tofu was $8.95 while the combinations were $9.95. 

I hadn't been here in a long time, and I haven't had good tofu soup in a while, so I was super excited!!!!!  The hot is too spicy for me, and the medium is not spicy enough, so I always order in between. And it's the perfect level of spice level. The spicy level bothers me because it doesn't taste right without the spice level. 

I ordered my pork tofu soup, and it came out piping hot. I actually burned my tongue. They crack the egg in the soup for you, so you don't have to. I thought they didn't put very many pork pieces in there, but they were all at the bottom of the soup. 

Just a minor complaint, the pork pieces contained all the fat still on it. They didn't cut off the fatty pieces which isn't very appetizing, but this is still my favorite tofu soup restaurant!",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,1,4,ZdDhTgRIEtQt9e4HE6kVxg

Mr. Tofu used to be a 2-4 times month staple before it changed owners over a year ago. Then it went downhill. But decided to give them another try before writing them off completely.

We almost backed out when we looked through the window and saw that there was not a single person dining inside. That was a little unnerving, especially during prime dinner hours. But we were here already, so why not...

Not sure if it was because the craving was so high, but I was pleasantly surprised how tasty it was! Got mine with kimchi and beef and ordered it was medium, which was plenty of spice. Unfortunately the soups are about $1-2 more, and so is the rest of their menu, but makes it on par with other Korean restaurants in the area, I suppose.

Only four banchans were given - bean sprouts, spinach, radish kimchi, and mushrooms.

The cold barley tea was really refreshing and a great complement to the spicy meal.

 Banchan (side dishes) were very basic of four or five dishes and we didnt finish any of them.  

For a restaurant that features  soondoobu, it was unremarkable.  They put in the egg for you instead of giving you the option at the table.

The galbi was minimally seasoned and extremely fatty.  We left half of it unfinished.  There is no excuse for a Korean restaurant to mess up a galbi. Its one of the most basic of Korean dishes.

If i had written this review the last 329432 times i came here, i'd probably give the place a 4/5. Normally there's only one person catering to all the tables... so it can be slow.. but whatever. Fine with me- as long as i'm getting my food in decent time & good service.. 

Now TODAY was a different story. Terrible experience. We asked for the side dishes before the soup came (i had done this before with no problem) as we were a bit hungry. The server said no. Okay. So when the soup finally comes out, he brings over the side dishes.. which are tiny portions. Again, that's okay considering we usually just ask for refills.. For some reason though, this guy seemed annoyed that we even asked for a refill!  We asked for a refill one more time after that (3X total-- at this point i'm feeling like a fat@$$ but just look at the portion sizes...), and he wanted to say something, but stopped himself....probably because he didn't want to come off as rude to us (the customers)...so then he reluctantly went to get more, came back with the side dishes and told us ""...This is the last time.""

We were here sometime after 8:30 pm and we were the only table there (when we got there, there was another table there just leaving). We were seated by a young guy who works behind the register. The menus are already on the table and my husband and I both decided to order 2 dolsot bibimbop (this is in a stone pot, the one w/o a stone pot is just called ""bibimbop"" in case you do not know, and it's $1 cheaper) for $9.95 each (before tax) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mr-tofu-las-vegas#dGjFpBiiSXC4hhlhRXikkg). 

The dolsot bibimbop was delicious and the rice was really nice and crunchy (benefit of ordering bibimbop in a stone pot, but be careful because my husband burned his arm twice on it). Love the vegetables and egg and meat in this dish as it really complements each other and is quite a filling warm dish on a cold night. 

The appetizers we received was delicious as well. 

Service was good. Also liked that when we first came in, we were both given 2 cups of hot tea (honestly, a perfect touch because it really was cold last week). 

The food came out pretty quickly as well.

Pricing for this place is very affordable and I can see why the overall rating for this place is pretty high (at the time of this review). Will be back here again.

the soontofu itself was not bad. both the combination and the seafood soups were...not that impressive. not particularly notable depth of flavor. About the amount of complexity you can get from a soontofu packet.

the seafood handmade noodles was a JOKE. hands down the worst kalgooksu/hand made noodles I've ever had. Complete absence of flavor in the stew--might as well have been in water. Tasted like just straight anchovi/dashi water. nothing else. The seafood in it was pitiful and flavorless. I have not been this disappointed in kalgooksu in a long time. This is really not kalgooksu.

spicy pork bulgogi. Also completely wrong flavor profile. waaay unspicy. Again, I feel someone who's never tried real spicy port bulgogi is making this.

Ask any one of my friends. They will laugh and tell you about my obsession with this place. I LOVE the tofu soup here, idno what they do to it but I've never had better, spicier, more flavorful tofu at any other Korean restaurant. Even in ktown!! 

The soup is always boiling and flavorful. When I ask for spicy, it is actually spicy unlike many other restaurants in California. The side dishes are amazing and the service is always on point. One time I went with the guys and we ordered 10 tofu soups to go, they were super accommodating and even gave us side dishes to go!

The only downside is that the location is off the strip meaning you have to take somewhat of a long cab ride from any hotels on the strip... Which isn't fun when you're hungover and feel like death.

We went with a group of friends in town for EDC and all tried different soups, all with different heat intensities. I had the kimchi tofu soup combination and it was flavorful and served bubbling, as it ought to be. the banchan were delicious. Great kimchi, great veggies, especially the broccoli. Yum, yum, yumm.

3 years later, it is THE WORST tofu stew I have EVER tasted in my life. And I'm from Orange County where there are a myriad of tofu stew restaurants competing to be the best of the best.

CONS:
-tofu stew taste was very bland
-it was LITERALLY not BOILING. It was just...moot, no boiling no steaming no piping hot stew. 
-it was literally tasted like soup powder and water with tofu thrown in. 

All in all, I was ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED. Especially because I was the one raving about how this place was the best and I introduced it to my mom. Sad day. I'm not sure if I'd ever come back. 

I definitely think the ownership changed because the taste is definitely not the same.

not

close.

where i come from soondubu is amazing and inexpensive.
i get that this is vegas so i shouldn't expect too much but i, at the very least, expect not to be disappointed.

broth was decent and that's pretty much it.
the tofu wasn't even soondubu tofu.
it most definitely didn't come out of a tube and was closer to medium hard than silken.

the banchan - we received 4 tiny plates which didn't include any of the standard dishes that most korean restaurants or soondubu places serve.  it was not good.  plain steamed broccoli was one of them.  no bean sprouts.  no cucumbers.  no chapchae.

my friend and i were so upset about it that we headed over to greenland that same afternoon to pick up ingredients to make our own soondubu at home with homemade banchan.

I was on the strip, thirsty as could be, yet, I had bookmarked this place a while back and realized, I'm not in Utah anymore, I'm getting myself some Korean food. And of course, it's extremely logical to want boiling hot soft tofu soup in this weather, and to drag myself away from the Strip as a new 21 year old for food.  After trying the soup here, my previous statement won't seem as counter intuitive, I promise you.  

I ordered the ""HOT"" combination tofu soup, and the waiter gave me this ""you don't know what you're getting into"" look, which I called him out for, and found that it did have much more of a kick than I'm used to when it comes to ordering Korean, but it was still delicious and I downed the entire bowl because it was that good.  And keep in mind, the weather outside.  My boyfriend, who is somewhat new (and slightly apprehensive) to Korean food, stuck with the beef bulgogi, and seriously looked like he was having a foodgasm from the very first bite.  Also a winner here, the rice.  Perfectly cooked, and perfectly great to accompany both of our meals. 

The service was okay, it wasn't great, but it was good.  I always had a full water glass (even though I was more interested in eating my soup than drinking water), and the panchan kept on coming out.  

So, my boyfriend and I took a taxi here, and a taxi back, and paid a total of $38.00 on taxi rides, and $30 on food.  Now, normally I get really angry when I spend more on transportation than the food, but it was completely worth it.",ZxVXd5Hy74g3bOJlyzWJEg,2,1,5,j0hnZk7eVDwhdswtIWWKuA

I drink a lot when I eat. I had the first can of soda almost gone before the food came. She never came back to ask If I needed more to drink. If you read my reviews I hate it when my glass is empty. After she brought the food to the table she never came back. Keep in mind we arrived there about 12:30 and we were the ony customers there. No reason for the slow and bad service. Then as I'm puting my 7 month old in her car seat she came out to my car to ask for a tip. Really sums it up. I work for tips in Las Vegas and I'm a very good tipper but if you don't deserve a tip you don't get one. The service has to be really bad for me not to tip. The beef noodle soup didn't have much taste but the bibimbap in a hot pot was good. Also had beef soon tofu that was ok. The banchan was ok but better at other places. One last thing - I think it bad when a places comes and takes something from your table when you are eating because they need it for another table.

I didn't like the fact that my rice didn't come in the stone pots. It just came in a metal bowl. I like the crunchy rice at the end!

As for the tofu soup itself, it was decent. However by the end of the meal, I was still feeling hungry (and usually I'm never hungry after eating at a tofu place). For a tofu soup, there wasn't that much tofu in it at all! I found myself spoon/searching for tofu!

The place was bright and clean. The menu was simple and easy to navigate. Also, the service was quick and friendly. The ban chan was not too sweet or too salty, they were all for the most part lightly pickled and lightly sour. They were all refreshing. 

I chose the beef soon tofu $8 and my boyfriend ordered the daegi bulgogi (spicy marinated pork) $14.95.

I ordered my soon tofu soup spicy and they brought it out bubbling with the egg already cracked inside the soup. The soup stayed scalding hot for a while, so don't even try to rush and eat it. It was a nice big filling portion. It had large chunks of soft and silky tofu, mushrooms, and spices. They don't hesitate on the spice levels here. It was a dry spice so it's the type of heat that hits you in the back of your throat. It wasn't over salted or sweet like some other places. Most of the flavor I tasted was the spice, so it was pretty bland. Overall, it's not the best I've personally had, but I was able to make it taste better by throwing all of the kimchi and kimchi juices into my soup. By doing that it added salt, sweetness, and much needed flavor. 

The spicy pork was great. It seems pricey, but they do give a large sharing sized portion. We asked for it spicy and they delivered. The pork was moist, sweet, spicy and salty. Rather addicting, I might add. It stayed crazy hot on the stone platter it comes sizzling out on, so be careful not to burn you're tongue.

White people, be not afraid. I am as white as the day is long and I have felt slightly intimidated when walking into an unfamiliar restaurant that serves unfamiliar cuisine. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that I'm the only one to feel a little bit silly trying to pronounce Korean dishes or figuring out the ""right"" way to eat something I've never even seen before. 
Our waiter was Song Sun Kyu and he was super! He has the sweetest personality and he was so kind about helping us choose our meals and schooling us on how to eat our food in true Korean style. He made us feel really welcome and very comfortable, right from the moment we sat down.
He started us off with the ban chan - five little dishes of cold appetizers. Seaweed salad (slightly sweet), cooked zucchini with carrot strips, radish chunks soaked in red pepper sauce, a green veggie (kind of a mix between bok choy and broccoli) with bean paste and sesame oil, and kim chee. He brought us two rounds of ban chan over the course of the meal.
We shared a bottle of soju - a very smooth, slightly sweet clear alcohol drunk in shot glasses. It's kind of like weak vodka but much tastier than vodka, in my opinion. It's 20% alcohol, so one 12 oz. bottle between two people is just about perfect for a lunchtime drink.
I had the dolsot bibimbap. It's pretty awesome: A big sizzling stone bowl filled with rice on the bottom, about four kind of julienned veggies, beef/chicken/tofu pieces and it arrives at the table with an egg on top. Song Sun Kyu graciously showed me how to take the long spoon that comes with it and stir it all together so that the ingredients all ""fry"" together in the hot bowl. The rice obtains a delicious crunch as it crisps in the stone bowl and the food stays piping hot. I also added a red pepper paste to the mix.
We had some beef BBQ. It was slightly sweet and so greasy, but ""good"" greasy. Like bacon. Probably not the healthiest thing I could eat but just so indulgent and tasty. 
My husband had the tofu soup; I didn't try it but he seemed to really enjoy it. 
Just a side note: It was our tenth anniversary and I went out on a limb and gave this place a try for our special anniversary lunch. We got lucky and ended up picking a big winner. We'll always remember our fantastic tenth anniversary lunch. They even gave us a couple of Diet Cokes to go, on the house, as a little anniversary gift. So sweet! :-)

That being said, I think Philly is blessed to have one of the best soondubu (soft tofu) houses on the east coast. I'm a little spoiled when it comes to soondubu restaurants. So this place was okay in comparison.

The location: It was close by the strip so when my friends and I were craving some filling, soupy, Asian food, this was easily one of the closest, most affordable places that came up.

The price: Affordable. It might even be cheaper than my beloved Jong Ka Jib back home in Philly. Also there is a $10 limit on credit cards, so if you're looking to pay for just one soondubu, bring some cash.

The service: There seemed to be ONE server for the entire place - for filling water, for bringing food, for hosting, for cashier, for taking orders. Just one guy. It was hard to get his attention, and I'm impressed that this place could be open with just one employee for the front of the house. But still, there were times where he would idle by in the back area of the place and I would be pining for some water or more banchan. He did indeed bring more spinach when asked for it; I was nervous to ask for the other side dishes after reading some reviews here.

The food: The side dishes are tiny, but decent. The soondubu itself is good. I ordered the pork one. Not as much tofu as I am used to, but a lot more chunks of pork. It wasn't pork belly, like how I am used to in my pork soondubu, but I think pork shoulder or butt? I am not sure. But I wish I could give this place 4 stars based on how much meat they gave me. I was a little upset that they cracked in the egg already for me - I am very picky with my egg. I was one of the lucky ones at my table that managed to have a soft, runny yolk. But other than that, the food was filling, yummy, and filled with meat.


I really wish I could give this place 4 stars, but the place itself was a little shoddy, the side dishes were not memorable, and the service was meager at best. The menu is also a little limited. If you don't mind all that is wrong, then come for some soondubu that is comparable to mom's (but not really, since mom's is best).",iYXQCx7IWJslr_WTLjn6lw,0,0,3,A1RsYW5FM8lONpsDY_g6gg

Sundubu is like chicken soup for the Korean soul...the perfect comfort food  to warm you up on a cold day and guaranteed to get your sinuses flowing if you're feeling congested.  I wonder if sundubu is onomatopoetic for the baby sounds of pleasure one makes when they are savoring every delectable spoonful of hot magma goodness.  

I ordered the combination seafood sundubu (clams, mussels, shrimp, and octopus) accompanied with rice, barley tea, and their banchan of the day.  Probably one of my favorite aspects of this place is in its simplicity.  The place is unpretentious, clean, the servers are attentive and courteous,  and they don't have an extensive menu but what they do offer, they execute very well.  My fellow yelpers are correct in their assessment that the banchan is up there amongst the best in town since they are all clean on the palate and are well balanced in seasoning.  

Moving on towards the main event, I would have to give 5 stars for the broth since most places I have frequented it tends to be more soupy and watered down, whereas here, it not only looks nontransparent, but has rich depth in flavor and almost has a creamy texture even though no dairy is involved.  The best part of eating sundubu is taking that ridiculously long spoon and choosing a form of attack (I prefer #3):

1) Eating a spoonful of soup and then eating rice
2) Reverse of #1
3) Taking spoonful of rice and dunking into soup
4) Spooning some soup into bowl of rice

Whatever keeps you from burning your tongue or strikes the perfect note between spice and temperature, although I'm not a fan of the throw all the rice into the pot technique and you should probably try out for Jackass if you are even thinking of attempting the reverse.  

Some purists prefer cracking the raw egg into the soup themselves, but I think the soup is served promptly enough where it is not critical.  The tofu itself gets 4 stars since there was nothing negative or mind-blowing about it, but I would give 3.5 stars for the seafood itself since the shrimp and clam were tender, but the mussels and octopus were overcooked but part of me is wondering if that was because I did not get to them early enough and they were left to continue cooking throughout my meal.  The other possibility was that they were necessary casualties contributing all their flavors into the stew itself....I may fetch them out with the big spoon upon arrival next time to determine the verdict.    Don't know where their sundubu stands amongst the major Koreatowns in North America, but definitely one of the most outstanding renditions I have had in quite some time.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,6,2,4,8FFIhyL7srjzgqyggXRI0g

Be careful not to burn your tongue. They also have the popular bibimbap (mixed rice) plain or dolsot (hot pot), kalbi (Korean short ribs), handmade noodle soups, along with other traditional Korean dishes. 

I ordered the combo sundubu which came with a bowl of rice and a variety of banchan. The banchan was the best that I've had at a Vegas Korean restaurant. Fresh, simple, and healthy! I enjoyed the potatoes marinated in a light sweet soy sauce, and the spinach seasoned lightly with sesame oil and salt (I ordered refills). The sundubu was delicious.

Mr. Tofu specializes in their soondubu (soft tofu stew). The stews really have a different feel and taste according to whats mixed in with it - pork, beef or seafood. I personally love the seafood soondubu. It has a couple pieces of shrimp, clams, mussel and a cracked egg. You can pick the level of spice from non-spicy to spicy. I get the medium, which I think it's spicy. So if you're not accustomed to the heat, I would suggest you go down on the spicy scale. The seafood soondubu is $9. 

I've had their dolsot bibimbap (rice and veggies in a hot stone pot). This is okay, I've had better. Some carrots, spinach, zucchini, mushrooms on top of rice. You mix in the spicy sauce yourself to your liking. Leave some of the rice on the bottom of the hot stone pot to get it real crunchy. This is the best part of a dolsot bibimbap!

They also have Korean BBQ. Kalbi, bulgogi and daeji bulgogi (spicy marinated pork). Their daeji bulgogi is pretty good for $15! Not too spicy and no extra fat in the dish making too greasy. I can tell whoever cooks this dish takes their time to prepare it right. 

Of course, nothing beats mom's Korean cooking at home. But when mom isn't able to cook, this place is pretty good for some fast cheap(-er) Korean food.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,2,0,4,q-enZ6XCf43a9ZXG3-23Yg

The first time we came here everything was A-OK. No problems. I'm thinking, I'll come back again and review this place when i have multiple visits. Unfortunately, the second visit was the last visit for me. Our waiter took it upon himself to give himself a 18% tip automatically. We were just a party of 4 with a baby. I saw him do the same thing to a Korean couple with three kids. I cant believe he had balls to do that to a fellow Korean.  Some Korean restaurants I go to take care of other Koreans preferentially. C'mon, you know it's true!  At least, our waiter that day was an equal opportunistic,egotistical, person with an endeavor for shady business practices on all people. He took 18%...above average tip (typical for 6 or more in a party) for some lack luster service. He didn't even refill our glasses with water once.  Maybe I wouldn't be so pissed if he just took a 15% tip or if there was something stating gratuity was automatically added to the bill...guess he thought highly of his level of service though.   Hell, if he just refilled our water I would have given him a 20% tip. I was in the F&B industry, I know how it goes. Immaculate service earns 30% from me...easy. Maybe he thought he was the bombdiggity of a server or was just tired of foreigners visiting Vegas and stiffing him. Heck, I sympathize. Europeans and some Asians from abroad don't tip diddly.

In addition to the tipping escapade, my sister asked our waiter for a bowl behind the counter.  He was unnerved and said he would bring it to our table. 5-7 minutes later the bowl arrived.  He was too busy calculating and counting his tips.  No kidding! The bowl was right behind him. He could have just turned around, grabbed the bowl behind him and handed it to my sister. Unbelievable! I guessed that earned him his auto-tip, in his mind.  Could be a new thing in Vegas too when 5 or more are gratuity included now. Would be nice to know If that's the case.Nothing about gratuity is stated anywhere and he failed to mentioned he added the tip already.  Our bill just had the total. Almost double tipped him.  Good thing we fought over who would pay.  Wouldn't have noticed otherwise.

Anyways the soondubu (tofu soup) here is pretty good despite only receiving a handful of banchan items.  If you do come here though check your bill first.  Or don't check it...maybe you'll receive average service and the auto-tip is OK with you.  I highly doubt it though. That guy just does the basics and delivers your food.

My family loves Korean food. Even when we go on vacay, Korean food has to be on the menu. I was entrusted with the task of selecting a Korean restaurant for dinner.  Mr. Tofu was the first restaurant that popped up with great reviews. Upon walking in, we noticed only but a few parties eating at peak dinner time on a weekend. That should've been the first red flag. 

Their menu is very simple. They offer soondubu, handmade noodles, bbq, and other various rice dishes. 

Banchan -- I guess I'm super spoiled. They were super chintzy on the banchan here. They only gave 5 different dishes, which we had to continuously ask for refills on. It was like pulling teeth. The spicy cucumbers and chilled tofu were tasty and on par with something I'd get in Ktown LA.

Beef handmade noodles -- Rather tasty noodles that appear to look plain and bland. Think of duk bokki but cut up into strips. Super doughy noodles served in a clear broth with only but a couple pieces of meat. I had to add some of the thick kimchi suace just to give it some flavor. 

Kalbi -- AKA galbi. The meat was super fatty and very tender. This is when all of our mouths dropped. We ordered a few side orders of the kalbi which costs you $7.00. Imagine our shock when we saw a sizzling plate with a few pieces of kalbi. It was literally a strip of kalbi cut up into pieces. We were expecting two strips at least! When we asked how this was a side order, he responded, ""This is how we do it in Vegas."" What a rip off!

Before the soup came, he brought me 5 banchan dishes.  I especially enjoyed the kimchi and the pickled radish.

When the soup came, he warned me that it was very hot (bowl and contents) and to take care.  The soup was excellent.  Good slices of beef, wonderfully soft tofu, and a hearty broth that was full of flavor.

Located in that one hellish strip mall on Spring Mountain between Valley View and whatever the next street over is, Mr. Tofu is pretty accessible from the highway. Parking may be a little iffy depending on the time of day and how busy its neighbors are, and the lot is just so narrow compared to everything else. Still, it's worth the trip.

It was pretty obvious to everyone that we should order the Soon tofu, aka soondubu/sundubu (spelling variations). I went for the combination (still $8.00) with a mild spicy level. Everybody else went with medium.

It didn't take very long for them to bring out our literally boiling hot soups in stone bowls. Based on the colors, it's pretty clear that mine was actually milder than everybody else's, but I'd still say it's a solid 2.5 or 3 on a scale of 10. I was sweating the whole time due to the combination of hot temperature and capsaicin!

The flavor, heat aside, was pretty good throughout the soup, and I enjoyed the tofu as much as I did the beef, pork, shrimp, mussel, and egg. (By the way, the egg at other places comes intact for you to crack open, but they've already cracked it into your bowl here.) I particularly enjoyed the flavor and texture of the mussel that I got. Combination is definitely the way to go, unless you wanna pony up that extra Washington for the purely seafood option.

I'm not much of a banchan person, but I didn't see anything wrong with the veggies or kimchee or whatnot. I enjoyed the sweet mushrooms quite a bit though. Wouldn't have minded a second helping of that.

I've only had soondubu once before, and this experience is much more memorable. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a hot bowl that's not ramen or pho.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,2,4,BpVMlJ4-tDO3hphF3Ah_yA

However, on a subsequent visit, I realized that this place had some shady business practices.  Our party was not even a large party yet an 18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill.  I always tip generously especially at restaurants where the prices are reasonable as long as the service is decent.  But I want it to be my choice.

The server should earn the gratuity by providing service and not just tack it on just because they think you are a tourist.  It's a terrible business practice that I have seen play out in touristy towns.  It should not be condoned.  

I completely understand charging large parties an automatic gratuity.  So, if your menu says that parties of 6 or more receive an automatic 18% gratuity, then so be it.  But a party of four????  

Seriously, that is just plain wrong.  This place needs to review their business practices, train their staff, and provide the appropriate level of customer service.  If I could give zero stars, I would.",4eqLl6-l6ju4gBfVnMSzlw,9,8,1,2IzIFWIx1ZMhITcx1D7N6Q

I get it with a raw egg on top because I love to drown the raw egg into the soup so it cooks it and later on finding it.

Seafood Combo: 4/5 My boyfriend got this and it was delicious a lot more seafood than Tofu huts.

Sides: 4/5 Their sides vary every time you go, but my favorite combinations of their 5 are seaweed salad, kimchi radish, kimchi , fish cakes, this cold clear noodle. Very Delicious. Also they're refillable bottom less you can say!

Banchan was all pretty tasty too.

Service was awesome, our server constantly refilled our iced water and banchan.

I may not be a Korean, but I absolutely love eating banchan, especially kimchi :p

I really enjoyed the food here and this is why they get the 4 star.  The only thing that could have pushed them to a 5 would have been better service but this is a fantastic Korean restaurant....Never having had this food until as an adult, I can tell you in beginning I was not impressed and only ate the Korean BBQ,  but about 28 years ago, I was working in Korea and fell in love with the food!

There are three simply reasons to come here and if the three are speaking to you, move on to another restaurant...

Soondobu - If you like the nice spicy soft tofu soup, this is the place to go!  When yelpers Lisa S. say this is like their mothers pork soondobu or Christopher S give it a good review, I gotta try it.  You can pick the spice level.  And, like Lisa says, this is something like you expect home made from your mom or grand ma. and Like Christopher S says, you have to do the soup, rice mouth, or the rice soup mouth routine to eat this properly!

Samgyetong - Korean Ginseng Chicken - I have spent many a winters in the early days in Korea doing work and it is freezing cold to the bone.  This soup is so delicious, warming and darn right simple that it always harkens in my memory the best of Korean dining family or peasant style.  This is a simple soup.  If you like complex thick soups that are overpowering, this will taste more like hot dishwater to your tastebuds.  However, if you have a delicate palate and very delicate tastebuds, you will know that this dishwater of soups is absolutely more rich and flavorful and refreshing!  The chicken itself is bland as well, it is boiled in water with minimal herbs, but it is so underwhelmingly just right.  It is hard to describe.  Simple yet satisfying. I guess it is like have a grilled cheese sandwich.  Simple yet satisfying....

Ban Chan - I love all types of the small dishes of Korean pickled or spiced vegetables and here the selection is the best.  They had gobo, celery, cabbage, white radish, bean sprouts, cubed radish, and watercress.  Yummy.

So, if any of these are speaking to you, gotta get over here. If not, well, you will probably not care too much for this place.....

I am giving you 5-stars because you deserve them, but also because I think the other Yelpers have been doing you an injustice. When someone searches for Korean food, specifically sundubu, in Las Vegas they should not see only 3-stars next to your name!

Whenever I am craving sundubu, you are the first place I want to visit. You are not open very late, which can make it challenging to maintain my faithfulness to your spicy, yummy tofu creations, but I try. I also love your panchan; they are so fresh and tasty, and I know they are made with love because every now and again the Korean chef runs out from the back. She seems very nice.

You have very nice servers-- tall, attractive guys, and it makes me giggle to see them wearing the red Williams Sonoma apron. They also have great suggestions for other good places to eat when I am not craving sundubu. Thanks to your servers we discovered Hot 'n' Juicy Crawfish. Having servers with good taste is a good sign.

Thank you, Mr. Tofu for your efforts to provide quality tofu to Las Vegas. I hope that more people will come and visit you because you deserve it.

Dolsot Bibimbap:
Rice topped with egg, veggies and meat. Bibimbap isn't supposed to be loaded with meat so, if you're a big carnivore, you should not get this. Add lots of spicy red paste depending on your spicy tolerance. 4/5

Soondubu:
You have to get at least medium spicy otherwise, you're wasting your time. There's lots of tofu and meat. The broth is great and perfect if you have a cold. Yummm...5/5

I'm not too sure if it was because there was no one in there yet, but the male waiter was extremely nice and polite to me when I walked in. The place was clean and much smaller than most Korean restaurants in town. The menu selection was also minimal, with about 4 sections and like 5-8 choices in each...
I ordered the tofu combination soup that has a combo of beef, pork and seafood. It was brought out boiling and smelled similar to the kimchi flavored ramen you buy in the bowls at Asian stores or sometimes seen at Sam's Club. I have to say it was very good.. the soup was flavored well..not too salty, unlike the other places Ive tried.  If you're someone that likes heavy spices and strong flavors then the broth might just be a little too bland for you, especially with rice.
I on the other hand thought it was the perfect balance because for once, I didn't have to drink as much water after I was done eating. In the soup, they actually use the jumbo shrimps for their seafood. They also automatically place an egg in there for you too, so if you don't like the soup with egg, make sure you tell them in advance. One thing you should consider is the spice level. It was not that spicy. I ordered hot and in my opinion it was more like mild. I'm not someone that can eat super spicy food, but to me there really was no spice in the soup at all. The only complaint I would have is that their side dishes were not all that great... compared to places like Tofu Hut... it had too much kimchi and cabbage plates which ultimately all tasted the same after a while.

They say that three is the magic number and I find it hard to disagree after my party failed to find a spot for dinner. One place closed down, another didn't open until 6pm, and then it dawned on me that Mr. Tofu was an option. 

Although it is not in the main Chinatown complex, this plaza holds it's own in culinary delights and Mr. Tofu only adds to it's credibility. Mr. Tofu does not offer a large menu, instead focusing all their efforts onto a single sided page. This reminded me of the specialty restaurants in Korea. Instead of offering a bevy of sub par items, they focus on a few signature dishes. 

The ambiance is simplistic and clean. The restaurant is minimalistic, open, brightly light, and the walls are adorn with a large menu and pictures of what they offer. 

The staff was friendly and quick with the refills on banchan. Not once did we have to request for more. Instead the gentleman swept in with replacements as soon as we devoured. Good thing there was only one other party, because I feel sympathy for anyone who has to serve Katrina M. and I when we feast. The poor guy made four rounds. The broccoli, kimchi, and two radish dishes did not stand a chance. The pickled celery was not in high demand. 

Bringing along a newbie to Korean food, we ordered and dined family style. I got the kongguksu; a cold, milky soybean noodle soup garnished with cucumber. The noodles are chewy without being rubbery. The soup is a thicker soy milk with pine nuts floating throughout. This dish is not for everyone because it will seem bland, but they offer salt on the side. On a hot day, this refreshing dish is a savior. At ten dollars, it is a filling meal. The soup alone is like drinking three cups of milk. We also ordered a combination soondubu; filled with beautiful pieces of pork, beef, mussels, shrimp, soft tofu, and egg. Adding the galbi plate is a steal. The two items came to fifteen dollars and could easily feed two, but we are fatties and ordered a second pork soondubu combo.

I had to grab a pot of Sundubu Jjigae at Mr Tofu last Sunday :) I love coming here not only because of the taste of the Soft Tofu Stew but also their Banchans are very fresh and good!  The Korean style soy pickled jalapeño is my favorite banchan of all time.  I think every Korean family has their own version of this side dish whether it be more sugar or more vinegar.  At Mr Tofu, the pickles are not too salty and just right amount of sweetness(in tangy sweet soy & vinegar sauce).
To me, there is something just so perfectly lush about Sundubu Jjigae- all that smooth extra silken tofu, veges, molten egg,  and bubbling hot chili broth,,, it is a heaven! 
I usually dine at Mr Tofu to try different style of Sundubu Jjigae.  One of my favorite is their  Seafood Soft Tofu Stew.  I love having all the shrimps, clams, squid, & mussels in the pot.  Other times, I usually get the thinly sliced beef rib eyes soft tofu stew.  A classic Korean tofu dishes are come with countless variations and I enjoy eating all different flavor of stews.  I think their broth is very consistent each time I had their soft tofu soup.  And they have an unlimited free barley tea if you ask for it.  
Once the pot is brought to the table, you will see a single raw egg already been cracked into the bubbling red broth with the silken soft tofu, yum!  Then, I gently stir my tofu stew and taste the spicy broth slowly(usually order mine as a medium hot).  Their broth is rich in flavor yet light in body :P  So Delicious! 
It's all about quietly waiting for my yummy hot tofu pot to come to my table- a bubbling and fiery red garlic broth of pot.  I finally smile when the waiter speedily brings a vigorous boiling pot.  
Other than the Tofu stew, I recommend their bibimbap in a hot stone pot. 
I own many small clay pots at home and certainly invested in proper Korean pots. I have tried cooking other Korean Stew but for me, making a real good Korean Style stew is a bit challenging especially creating a great stew like,"" Sundubu Jjigae"" using a meat stock and a fresh fish sauce. 
At this point, I am going to eat at Mr Tofu whenever I am craving for a warm Tofu soup. 
I remember my family used to tell me that Sundubu Jjigae is a perfect antidote to the flu.

The seafood soup was delicious but rather small in size compared to what I normally get at other places. The flavor was yummy and spice was just right.

The bibimbap was decent according to the BF, he says he prob won't come back just for this.

The Haemul Pajeon was very heavy in the green onions and barely any seafood.

Overall experience I would return for the soondubu but prob not for the other items on the menu.",KPd62L9KA35TB56SJWUHtw,0,0,3,ZU5ecD8ASQ5SvpjiyshBAA

For the uninitiated, uninformed ones like myself:
  soondubu jjigae, aka sundubu, aka Soon tofu: soft tofu stew served in a clay pot (ddukbaegi) which can be heated directly on the stovetop. The silky tofu is served with your choice of beef, pork, or the seafood combination plus vegetables at your desired level of spiciness and then a raw egg is added right before the pot is brought to the table, bubbling hot.  Wow!  My friends know I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food, so I ordered the mild beef soondubu.  We were served banchan (Korean side dishes) and white rice first, followed by the soondubu--who needs Vicks?  It was just the right level of spiciness for me, but because it's so hot, my sinuses cleared up right away, even though they didn't need to be.  Make sure you have a napkin or tissue handy to wipe your nose.  We had ordered galbi, too, but it was just okay.  The main attraction is the soondubu and now I've been schooled.  It was delicious and I'm happy to say that I'm no longer one of the uninitiated.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,6,6,4,v_k9SbopFILyJ6lbzC7HSg

I love that the menu is simple as well. 

I wanted to try the noodles in chilled broth but they didn't have it the one day I decided to order it so I stuck with my usual pork soon dubu. 

I don't know if it's just my own preference but I liked that the waiter doesn't come to our table every 2 minutes. I find that very refreshing in a restaurant.

I've had soon dubu from so many different places that I'm always pleasantly surprised when I eat here. It's delicious and cheaper than most of its Las Vegas counterparts.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,1,1,5,JpnZ7W4Z2mYVaxtgc6sSHA

I've never gotten anything other than soondubu from here but you'll get the choice of spicy levels as well as having no spice (plain white). I'm a pansy so I usually get no spice at all. It's too much for me to handle (I'm weak) and I rather not have a runny nose :b. Always try their combo tofu if it's your first time. You get a mix of everything. I personally am a beef fan.

Service is pretty decent. If they're busy, just signal for them over and they're there!

We ordered:
1)  Beef Noodle Soup - spice it up with that delicious hot sauce that he provides
2)  Combo Seafood and Meat Tofu Soup with a bowl of rice, medium spice - OOOOhhhhhh!  I love this dish.  The soup comes bubbling and piping hot with load of seafood and meat.  Next time, I would just order the meat as the squid got cooked way too fast - but I won't drop any stars for Mr Tofu.
3)  Dolsot Bibimbap - Wonderful blend of fried egg, vege and meat and rice and red bean sauce in that hot stone bowl.
4)  Bulgogi on a hot plate with rice - delicious beef so tender.  A must eat at Mr Tofu!

I never eat tofu soup anywhere else..mr.tofu is just the best. The servers are genuinely nice and the food quality is consistent. I come here every week and every week the food is just on point. I've tried most on their menu I would recommend the Soondubu(obviously), Kal-guksu, and ra-bokki! You really won't regret it..so good! And for those spicy lovers out there if you've tried this place and felt like the soup was not spicy enough even at hot, try extra extra hot! It's super spicy and in my opinion the soup has a lot more flavor when I get extra extra spicy.. It was a bit bland when I just got the hot (the spiciest option on the menu) if you're having second thoughts DONT! JUST GO!",2Ei4y0mPCs_Bm1n2hRc9uQ,0,0,5,-UgPeZ-7lnK5QX1mIj27JA

My family and I have eaten there hundreds of times, but this is the first time that a worker actually PICKED A FIGHT WITH US. 

Because they don't serve boba drinks, we buy them from a neighboring store and bring it in, which previously was never a problem. The food was good and they USED TO have nice people. But today, their policy changed and outside food is no longer allowed... okay. that's fine. No complaints.

But I didn't want to waste my $5 drink. My solution was to just wrap it in a plastic bag and when I really needed a drink, I would go outside and sip some and then quietly and discretely go back in. No other customer looked annoyed or even cared; they were just chilling out and eating their meal. 

But the third time I went back inside and sat down, THE WAITOR CALLED MY MOTHER STUPID under his breath. We both looked at him like we couldn't believe it. and then he goes off in a tangent saying how we were the ones who called him stupid, and how he doesn't care if we were VIPS or not. Quote on quote he said, ""I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE VIPS. I DON'T CARE IF YOU COME BACK. I DON'T CARE.""

My mother and I never said anything, and so obviously the WAITOR WAS COMPLETELY LYING. PICKING A FIGHT WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS, ESPECIALLY AN OLDER WOMAN??? Obviously this place KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT customer service. I wasn't acting like a VIP at all; it was out of my inconvenience to save the $5 drink I worked for!

But that's not all... they get their orders wrong and try to cover up without apologies. My mother order no octopus in her soup because she's allergic , but a whole octopus was in there! His defense? THAT'S NOT AN OCTOPUS. IT'S JUST A TYPE OF OCTOPUS THAT'S SMALLER. 

I think it's still an octopus... And he's the one calling us stupid.",7rYtmb16_YyJjpFsKfYyGw,0,0,1,Ge0fUypPLHjWtogp3iZnKA

There are so many Korean restaurants in Las Vegas where you can get your sundubu on, most of the ones I have tried all are decent or better.  But thanks to Yelpers deciding to visit their favorite sundubu spot after an event, I finally made it to Mr. Tofu, and their version is above average.

For those that enjoy ordering off the menu, they do have mushroom sundubu for your enjoyment.  But I usually just stick to the beef, mixed or seafood sundubu with medium level spiciness (plenty of heat to unclogged stuffed up noses), which are great especially on cold and windy nights.  It is served to your table scolding hot, so be patient or blow on it to cool it down, before you burn your tongue and can't taste anything for a few days.  Their bibimbap is also pretty good, but sundubu is the main reason for coming here.

Their ban chan is good, and if you like a particular one and finishes it, you can always ask for more.
