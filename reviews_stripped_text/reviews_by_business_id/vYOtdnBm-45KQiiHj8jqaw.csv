A perfect way to wind down after a day of shopping and recovering from the night before, when you're feeling a bit peckish but don't want to stuff yourself because you have a late dinner reservation.  Views are stunning (even better in the bar at night), though that empty lot next to Planet Hollywood is a bit of an eyesore, but I can't blame it on the tea, or the Mandarin Oriental.  I can't believe no one's thought of high tea on the Strip before.",B-FRk0KUWu42H2g-NkhVfw,0,0,5,a1YeNtGbycJ4_DwnAfipoQ

179720,2011-07-10,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"I love afternoon tea and I had high hopes for this experience at the Mandarin Oriental. Perhaps my expectations were too high as my experience was very average. Yet being one of few places that offers this tea service in Las Vegas, maybe there simply is not enough competition for them to step up their game.  I know now that I am not a huge fan of afternoon tea in a modern style setting and that marred my experience....

We made reservations specifically for a window seat.  When we arrived, we were told none were available. However we could have been told instead that if we waited a few minutes the seating will be available. Just something about the way we were handled was just not right.   I am particular because this is the Mandarin Oriental afterall and I expected super service.

We waited and waited...and finally were seated at a window.  The view...I am so sorry to say - is not exactly spectacular. We were looking at the Strip...and when does it ever look great except at night when the lights are on.  Our view looked onto a building in the midst of construction...I would say the view is interesting for about 5 minutes but after that...nothing more to soothe the soul and uplift the spirits.  Based on the other reviews...I expected...more.  Maybe some vegetation...something other than the concrete jungle that is the Strip.

The food was adequate. The best item was the flourless chocolate cake (1 small bite - just heavenly).  The server did not know everything that we were being served.  Hello...???

One good thing was that we had originally booked 3 for tea and dropped it to 2 for tea and 1 for just a drink and that didn't seem to be a bother to them.  At other venues I have been to they might want all parties to order the full tea service during tea time.

I want to give a higher rating - I truly do, however my rating is just 3 stars...an A-OK experience.  I have no plans of returning however I am glad that I had this experience.  Next time I visit Vegas, I will try tea at the Bellagio - Petrossian Bar or Four Seasons/Mandalay Bay - Verandah.",uN-tjdXAkZZSP7x_sEF8Dw,0,0,3,P82idqrEgJ17L4bbkHAnsw

Three of us partook of the Classic English Afternoon Tea and there was a wonderful selection of goodies including delicate sandwiches, scones and tea pastries.

The items we ordered were delicious.  I got the scones, which came with two pots of preserves and one of cream.  My friend got their gluten free option (macarons?).  

It was a very nice and relaxing afternoon, and I'd do it again.  I will say that I was underwhelmed by the service.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as I would have expected at the MO.  Maybe the server was just having an off day?  I also wasn't a fan of the decor and thought the seating could have been more comfortable.

448792,2010-08-04,1,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"I just came back from this wonderful tea lounge and I can't wait to share my great experience with Yelp :)

I called a few days ago and made a reservation. The concierge was very nice and polite. She confirmed the date, time, number of people and phone # with me. Two days before I flew to Vegas, I received a reminder call from them and then I called them back because I had to change the number of people attending the tea lounge. ""No problem Ms. XXX and we can't wait to see you on Saturday"" is the first sentence I heard from them. At that point I am already in love of this place!

We arrived on time on Saturday, and one lady quickly approached us and asked us if we had a reservation. I am glad I did because the lounge was almost full. Then the lady took us to an empty table with ""Reserved"" sign on it. Then another lady quickly approached our group and pulled the chairs for us to sit down. What a service! As we have already reviewed the menu on their site, we pretty much knew what we were going to order. Before the server took our order, she courteously reminded us to see if anyone had any food allergy so they could adjust the food accordingly. The view of the tea lounge is gorgeous as it is located on the 23rd floor of Mandarin Oriental, but you really don't need to sit next to the window to enjoy the view. As of the gorgeous decor in the tea lounge, I will let other Yelpers' photos to speak for itself :)

We ordered English Afternoon Tea and two cupcake bentos plus tea of course. Calling them yummy is simply an understatement. Not only do they look pretty (especially those cupcakes!), they taste so great and so fresh! I can almost guarantee you they just made those sandwiches, scones and sweets for us after we placed our order. Also, I was fairly surprised when our server asked us if we want to have more food (and more tea), so we asked for more scones to go with their delicious marmalade, devonshire cream and jams. Once again, the service is just top notch. Our always smiling server stopped by a couple of times to make sure we are happy, and sure we love being pampered! We had a wonderful time and I can't wait to come back with my family and friends!",3wAG34DtH2-n16jz5gN6jQ,3,0,5,PETbzdzkpqz7FQO8rkCjSg
525400,2017-01-08,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Poor experience last night. The first tea pot they brought was tepid. It was barely over room temperature and so the Darjeeling couldn't steep.
They replaced it.
The food was brought out and looked fantastic. However, one of the scones was not baked thoroughly. The middle was still dough. The waitress apologized and took the plate away, however since I was distracted by the unbaked scone, I didn't notice that also on that plate were two halves of my wife's scones which were fine. (they serve two peoples' scones and sandwiches on the same set of plates.) 
The manager came over, offered her apologies and offered to bring more scones. She came back from the kitchen to inform us the rest of the scones had been thrown away, as we were at the last tea time of the day. 
Not wanting to cause a scene with the family present, I graciously accepted her offer of a few extra  macaroons to make up for the scones.

They still somehow felt it was a good idea to include gratuity on the bill.

I'm giving it 2 Stars because the other three in my party had no problems and the sandwiches were tasty.",Lfif5mlaBTCUoJ8wbepXqQ,1,0,2,Z0Pg8NaapgeXak1cZejH4w

A nice comfy lounge overlooking the strip where you can just chill out with some pals. My hubby brought my here knowing I love to try new things, even though this type of thing (hot beverage in the desert?) isn't really his cup of tea. We ordered the earl gray jasmine, which was highly praised by past guests and our server. Also added a fruit plate. I highly recommend both.  The tea came steeped in a large ceramic pot and since it is a black tea I asked for milk. Did not need it. The flavor is mild and refreshing. Only $12/ pot we ordered the matcha green tea too. This is a strong tea so get it with milk/ sugar if you're not used to it.

The lounge area is pretty small and they place the tables really, really close together so expect to easily hear the conversation of your neighbor. Another con is that the seats are really low so it feels like you're reaching up to everything and the waitresses are adequate, but seem busy and don't give you any special attention for the price you're paying. The view from the hotel is nice though and again, it's something different to do on the strip.

Located just off the 23rd floor lobby, this was a relaxing and peaceful setting to enjoy a mid-afternoon glass of pinot grigio paired with some cupcakes. Wine was fantastic - cupcakes would've tasted better if they didn't cost $22 for 4 minis! Would love to come back to do the whole afternoon tea set but will have to do so with girlfriends - the hubby's Y chromosome causes him to run for cover at the mention of tea cups and scones. We just dropped in and managed to get seated on the last available couch so I would definitely recommend doing reservations as well.

We did this as our dinner for the night. We had splurged and ordered a bottle of champagne with our afternoon tea and it was totally worth it. We would do it again. The view itself was amazing. We had the 4pm reservation which was perfect for watching the sunset. Get a reservation well in advance.  The food was really good but not great, a couple items were not our favorite but still delicious. There was so much we could not finish. If it weren't for the outstanding service I would've given it 4 stars. We did go on a Friday night and the check-in desk adjacent was PACKED, so as other reviewers stated this was apparent but we were not bothered much. Too distracted watching the sunset. We did have to wait awhile because a spot was not open despite the reservation but we went over to the lounge and waited which did not bother us. A few tables had opened at once and the waitress was going to place us in the middle but because of our wait she asked if we were willing to be re-seated next to the window! :D Definitely request a window seat if you can. I wish I could remember our servers name because she was amazing. We even accidentally dropped some food and she replaced it so fast without us even requesting. Our tea and champagne was ALWAYS full.

Our first time walking into Mandarin Oriental and this place is nothing short of spectacular. The entrance is through a cozy elevator ride in connection to MO's valet. 

We walked in there nervous, out of place, and without a reservation. Certain that the host was going to turn us away, I wouldn't leave coming here to enjoy Afternoon Tea to chance. Thankfully,  for us it payed off in a big way. We were granted one of the tables with floor-to-ceiling window views as long as we had it available at 3:45 for their next reservation. (That translated to more than an hour stay for us.) 

We each enjoyed Classic English Afternoon Tea. We loved each of our tea choices, most of the sandwiches, only two of the desserts and couldn't get enough of the scones!   The atmosphere is relaxing, the service amazing and the wide-sweeping views of the Las Vegas are worth enjoying because they are definitely not gratuitous. 

*It's also worth noting that Afternoon Tea is best enjoyed when a well-balanced meal has been had! We're glad we strolled in here after a meal.

Hits:
-The view is stellar.  I called ahead to reserve a table by the window for the best view.  When we arrived, we were not disappointed.  This was a treat for my sister's birthday.  And she loved it.

-The food.  Some reviewers say that the food is average. I thought it was above average.  I loved the ham sandwich, and the curried chicken sandwich, the scones were warm and buttery, the jam and marmalade were heavenly.  The sweet potato tart was good.  The chocolate bon bon and cake was just okay.  There is room for improvement, but it was better than average.

-The design.  I loved the rug, the chairs, the tables, the drift wood chandelier.  Gorgeous pieces here.  Classy and refined, not too girly.

Minuses
-The tea.  My Earl Grey wasn't as robust as I usually like.  And although it was brewed at the right temperature, it cooled too fast upon pouring.

-My server was the worst.  I looked around at all the other tables and noticed everyone else's server was great.  But mine was just checked out.  She didn't take our order for like 8 minutes.  And she never came back to check on us.  We had to flag down the other servers for help.  I was shocked.

The space itself is very tiny--immediately adjacent the check-in desk, with only a slatted decorative piece separating the two spaces. As a result, the din of the check-in lobby easily floats into the tea lounge. Though the noise might not be jarring, it does become distracting when large waves of groups start checking in... Not the most gentile environment for a serene cup of tea. 
 
The lounge ambiance, apart from the odd placement, was very pleasant. The service was charmingly hospitable. The culinary presentation, top notch. The tea, decent. The sandwiches, sparse and bland. The scones, still in the oven when the rest of our fare had arrived :-/ but well worth the extra wait. 

All in all, go for the ambiance, service and experience. But foodies, don't get your hopes up.

When placing my order, I informed our server that I am a vegetarian and clarified that I don't eat fish, to which she responded that she would give me the vegetarian options. However, the server did not tell me that the garnish on the egg salad was made of squid ink; I found out after the fact. I'm not too strict about that, but this could've been a huge deal for those with stricter diets or allergies.

Their Afternoon Tea times start at 11:45 am-4:15 pm. It's best to make a reservation in advanced because they fill up quick. We picked a 2 pm slot time so we could have the best lighting, of course. Unfortunately, we did not get the window view, but we still sat in the middle to enjoy some scenery. Price was reasonable at $45 per person, which includes one brewed loose leaf tea of your choice (unlimited only with the selection you chose) and a beautifully decorated 3-tiered assortment of small pastries and sandwiches. Everything tasted delicious! My favorite were the scones...add with a bit of butter or jam, heaven. The Mango Orange Blend tea had a nice orangey-vanilla taste, if you are looking for a hint of fruit aroma. For one person, it's more than enough to consume; you could even share for the price of one. 

Mandarin Tea Lounge is the perfect setting to have a girls outing on the strip, celebrate any birthdays or anniversaries. Very charming.

First of all it's not really a ""lounge"" in that it is just a little area off of the registration desks in the hotel lobby. The relaxing atmosphere that one would expect from a lounge quickly gives way to rolling luggage and loud parties of tourists.
  While there is a beautiful view of the strip, there are only 3 tables that afford you that view. The  majority of the tables are very low and very uncomfortable to sit at with no space for your legs. When we left, both my grandmother and I had aches and pains from being 'squished' into the low uncomfortable chairs. She may be an older lady but I am only 32!
I made a reservation weeks in advance and I was still seated at a table with no view inches from a couple of loud women on their laptops who were waiting to check in.
 On a positive note- the food, while small is very delicious and filling. The scones are fantastic to say the least and the Devonshire cream is perfection. The tea was lovely and beautifully presented, however, we still aren't sure if you only get one serving or refills because the server came and took our pot away never to return.

Don't get me wrong, my sister and I had a great time!

The food was great (unique spins on tiny finger foods) and surprisingly filling. I will say that: Come on an empty stomach! The tea selection was great and I loved what blend I chose. Also, service was good. 

You can imagine the view was spectacular. The only problem is, not everyone gets to experience it in its entirety. It is a small space next to the registration desk for the hotel, so that majorly takes away from the ambiance. I would rather have it much louder, or much quieter. There was a weird in-the-middle when people were checking in. The space almost feels like it was an afterthought, or it was the lounge by the registration that they thought, ""Hey, let's put tea service here."" I know that's unlikely because other Mandarin Oriental locations around the world do high tea, but I still feel that way!

Another thing: The way the seats are situated is a little uncomfortable. My sister and I were at a table, I was in a chair and she was opposite me on a little couch. But then the table right next to us had the same set up, so really my sister was sharing a couch with another woman. It was just a weird feel. I could hear their conversation if I wanted to and vice versa. The way the set up is, I couldn't simultaneously enjoy the view while enjoying the meal, although I saw a couple other tables where both chairs were pointed to the view, which looked nice. *sigh*

There was another tea service option in Las Vegas last year, which was great, relaxed and a perfect thing to do with friends. For having to make a reservation weeks out, I was hoping for a better experience at Mandarin Oriental.

Will I go back? Yes, probably, for a special occasion. Why, you ask? They are the only ones in town. *wide eyed emoji*",74sdrfg2SFhH3kAslZjjrg,3,1,3,0AyK111rRCTnmZ6unFXhhQ

Anyhow, the hostess found my reservation for the following day. Instead of turning us away, they allowed us to sit in the next room. No one was there but we were still able to have tea and our server was great about checking in.

So, I love High Tea. Period. I have been fortunate to experience high tea at Laduree's at Harrod's of London, Maurice's in Paris, various locations in the UK and Los Angeles. Plus the Mecca of high tea experiences, The Ritz in London. Now I have to say, Tea at the Mandarin was exceptional. It was a very different experience from other High Tea places I have been too. The difference was, the Asian twist. The fusion of East meets West. When you have high tea at other establishments, it traditionally is British or has a Euro twist. I have never been to a place that offered an Asian infusion.

One of the persons in our groyp was not a tea drinker. They offered  coffee, which was very nice. She was uncomfortable in asking as he didn't want to offend their tea, but our server was so sweet about the coffee option.

I love new experiences. So thank you Mandarin for giving me a new High Tea experience. I am looking forward to having Tea with you again, hopefully in your main tea room. I promise to double check the dates. ;)",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,4,3,5,Ln71zvmR6qFNqmE2SfDPjw

It takes a lot to make it to a place like this on a Sunday morning in Vegas, especially after hitting up the club with pocket loads of gambling and a stomach full of alcohol.  In the end, it's definitely worth it!  Here's why.  

You receive a nice buzz and sensational relief when enjoying one of their teas.  No it's not your usual tea in a packet.  This actually holds up to the definition of essence in tea.  Pretty refreshing.

It's not for feasting on a huge fried meal.  You get individual bite sized items to pair with your tea so don't expect a great time with a stomach aching for heavy food while suffering from a hangover.  Then you're in the wrong place and mind.

Views are pretty awesome too.  You get a nice view of the strip looking north past many of the hotels.  This includes also the ambiance in the area.  Average noise level, which translates to quiet ambiance in Vegas terms.

It's something very different to do on the strip.  It's not the usual thing to do, therefore, it's a fun, calming, and unique experience.  I hope on my next trip I get to experience this tea lounge again.

Though we didn't have a reservation, we were seated quickly around 3pm.  At first a table by the window wasn't open, but right after we sat down the couple by the window left, so we asked to move to the better location and were graciously accommodated!

The Hubs and I shared the Mandarin Oriental tea and scones (since we just wanted a light bite).  The tea was light and delicious, as were the scones.  The scones were served warm and were so buttery.  Loved the ginger jam it came with along with the cream.  The view is the real treat for sure.  I could sit on that 23rd floor all day having tea.  It was a very nice afternoon retreat.  I hope to go back soon for the full afternoon tea experience!",b3DYIU3TFc4gy9H_50_hUA,0,1,4,eRINhahtsh7hZ8vY61q63A

The scones were SO good!  Moist and crumbly at the same time!  That was the best part of the beautiful display we got.  Finger sandwiches were good.  The desserts were a little too sweet for my taste (and I LOVE sweets) but would have been balanced out by the tea which I ran out of because my teapot was half filled when I got it and our bored waitress became absent after delivering our food.  

I know everyone raves about the views from this place, if you like to look at other hotels sure it's a great view...but in my opinion, I'd rather look at something pretty (like the Fountains at the Bellagio) while I'm eating something pretty, that cost a pretty penny.

Our group agreed the best part of the whole experience was the ride up in the elevator...there was even a reenactment of the Pretty Woman scene...""well color me happy there's a sofa in here for two..."" but I digress.

The Tea Room is an open area between the bar and the front desk. The ""tables"" are about the same height as an end table, so I feel like I am sitting at a kids table. They should have the tea served in the bar using real adult sized tables.

The tea is not steeped at the table, they just bring it out (one pot)  already made. 

How can you have a high tea without cucumber sandwiches?

After the tea was served the waitress never came back.

The food was very good but the portion size was tiny, we ate here as a late lunch and were still very hungry when we left. 

There is an automatic gratuity added to the bill, cannot remember how much it was. What incentive do they have to provide decent service when they know up front they are getting a good tip?

The menu was definitely going for a fusion of Asian and Western tea, and in my opinion it didn't really work. I tried three separate teas and to me they all tasted, well, literally fishy. The Jasmine and White tea blend a friend got was very good, however, and the only one ordered at our table that I could stand. This is pretty rare, as I generally love any and all tea!

As far as the food itself, the sandwiches were definitely tasty and the scones weren't bad, though it didn't even come close to teas I've had in other places. I can't really speak to the pastries, they looked beautiful but I was too full to eat them until much later. I would have been happy to pay a mid-range fee for this tea, but it was exorbitantly expensive for what you get. Forty dollars (fifty with tax) was nowhere near worthwhile for this tea.

I admit that anywhere you go on the Vegas strip you're expecting to pay more for moderate quality. Still, I would say this tea isn't really worth it. Wait until you can go to a higher quality place for less elsewhere.",-IauZiP5bnYcticusXHDnw,1,1,2,-Gqk_pUrjsVegSuhw670JA

Angela De Cosmo is an amazing event co-coordinator.  The couple had been conversing with Angela over the past  7 months regarding their wedding and when we decided to have a tea party I just emailed Angela and she organized it.  Since we were having so many, she arranged for us to use the Bar room on the 23rd floor for our event which just happened to be where the wedding reception the next evenig was being held. It's almost as gorgeous during the day as it is at night.  The views are staggering. We opted for scones with Devon cream and jam and a variety of pastries with our tea (hot and cold). They were all a big hit and plenty was provided.  At the last minute (same day), I found out two guests only ate glueten-free foods and once again Angela came through.  I only have two issues: the two gluten-free guests were provided with their own plate of only 3 pastries each.  I think there should have been little more and if other guests chose to try one, all the better.  Secondly, I expected the tea to be served in tea pots but instead a variety of tea packets were provided and hot water and guests served themselves. Perhaps this was only because of our numbers but I expected a little more service for the price. All in all, the guests were thrilled with the event and all wished we had dressed up with gloves and hats.  It was a great getting to know you event especially since many were from cities mostly from all over North America but a couple from Europe.  I would recommend afternoon tea at the MO to any brides bringing  a number women together for the first time.

Well, I wouldn't consider myself a ""high tea"" kind of guy, but I am always up for an adventure. 

I believe that reservations are highly recommended, but there may be options to call last minute and see if there are spots available. I suggest planning ahead, as I always say, it's better to have a reservation and not need one than to show up and not have a reservation when you need one. The wife called and reserved, but I'm pretty sure that they request a credit card to hold the reservation.

Anyway, on to the tea, the food and the experience. The view is phenomenal from the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental, first and foremost. We were three total guests, so we had a sofa and a couple of chairs as options for seating. After looking at the menu, we each decided on a tea from at least a dozen options and the wife had set up the food options prior with everybody's food restriction. We each received what seemed to be a half gallon of tea in huge teapots and each a tower of food from scones, little sandwiches and desserts/pastries.

There are only a small amount of tables for tea service...probably about 8 or so.  The area is open and is shared with the reception desks.  Our seating area was two couches and a table which was a bit higher than a coffee table.  The seating was not the most comfortable arrangement and the table was small for the amount of pots, plates and cups.

For $36 a person (not including tax and gratuity), we had three tiers of delightful scones, tea sandwiches and desserts.  The scones were my favorite because they were light, buttery and served with homemade jams and the best Devonshire cream.  The desserts were small bite sized chocolates, cakes/tarts, macarons which were beautiful.  The finger sandwiches were ok but the presentation was very pretty.  I ordered the Monkey Picked Oolong tea because it sounded interesting.  Supposedly monkeys were trained to pick the choicest leaves from wild tea trees, which were enjoyed exclusively by the Imperial Court.

The service was great.  All the staff are very informative on the different types of teas and can suggest one to your liking.

I stirred in some sugar and honey, and the honey, which is brought out in small jars, is thick and rich! It was a great addition to my tea.

We enjoyed the afternoon tea, so we were served fresh, warm scones with toppings, sandwiches, and desserts. The scones are absolutely out of this world! They taste even better with the strawberry topping. Each food item is so different but still adds to the fun of afternoon tea.

The decor in the lounge is beautiful, and you have a great view of the strip through the windows. I really like how there are only a maximum of maybe 10 groups in the tea lounge because it's much quieter than it could be, and it makes the experience that much better.

Our waitress was very sweet and informative. She recommended different teas and shared her personal favorites. The hostesses were also very kind and made us feel welcome!

My only complaint is that because the foods are all so different from each other, as well as each foods' texture, they may shock your palate a bit.

It offers a five star level of service with a style that seamlessly blends oriental and modern style into a sophisticated yet relaxed environment.j  Red and gold flairs throughout a minimalist scheme.

As a fan of afternoon high tea (tea, dessert, and light sandwiches?  Sure, why not?), my curiosity was piqued to check out a different style than what I have had in Vegas.  This follows my disturbingly disappointing experience at Bellagio, the dreamy experience of Four Seasons, (and many others prior to that outside of Vegas such as Grand Floridian in Walt Disney World, three other Four Seasons, Alice's Tea Cup in NYC, Savannah Tea Room, etc, etc...) 

First thing's first: The view is dynamic.  You must MUST have reservations as there are three different tables next to the window to offer the best view.  The rest of the tables aren't far but don't offer what these three do.

Second: The service was excellent.  I only had to nod at a server to have them glide over with a smile and check on the state of our meal.  The young ladies were charming - deceptively.  They were on the ball, making sure everyone was taken care of while making the whole practice seem effortless.  They knew plenty about the Mandarin Oriental, the teas they were offering, as well as their competition.  The Conversation was friendly and not to mention they offered complimentary refills on pastries and other sandwiches.  SCORE.

Now, the food: The only reason I didn't reward a 5th star was because while this tea was excellent the food was very good but not EXCELLENT.  The sandwiches were delicious but the pastries didn't quite hit a home run for me.  A little too sweet and didn't contrast well with the tea I was drinking - I wish I was drinking something a little more muted and less sweet.  Next time I'm going to drink a heavier, more traditional tea to compliment the sweet factor of my meal.

The afternoon high tea option that's priced per person is not bad at all and is highly recommended especially if it's your first time.

Tea time opens up at lunch and the classic English tea $38/person has generous amount of food to make the meal last over a couple of hours.  Love love the bright seating area, and love love the menu of tea choices.  Flavorful jasmine earl grey white tea mix, the organic lychee green tea is not so good.  

Service is a bit slow and I saw a waitress wiping her nose on the sleeve while walking away.  Definitely need a bit more tidy up and training.  The food look very presentable and pretty, but the taste is just average.  The savory items taste better than the desserts but overall I would say that's what dragged down the rating.  The scones are better when warm, but I wish they come more soft.

I really enjoyed the scones, cream and jam. 
I think if I were to come back, it would be solely for that. 

The tea was also quite good, I had their signature mandarin tea. 
It was aromatic, but still very black and bold. 

The snacks and pastries were all very well presented, they came looking absolutely beautiful. 
Only thing is, they didn't taste as good as they looked. 

The customer service was great, I really appreciated all the help and the suggestions. 
They were also very friendly and not pretentious, which was a bit of a surprise. (And very welcome!)

The view from the teahouse is breathtaking. 10/10.
I do wish they had non-orange lights though!

But actually, you know what would've been great though?  This doesn't factor into my review, but although I love the view of the south end of the strip, I wish the Mandarin Oriental had built its tea lounge to face the west instead of the north.  That way, during afternoon tea, people could watch the sunset.  Just my fantasy :D oh well.

Mandarin Oriental, as you should know, is renowned for their Asian-inspired service.  When I visited, it was nothing short of what I expected.  In fact, it was nothing short of what I expect EVERY time I've been there.

Let me tell you, Tea Station, one of the biggest chains of Asian tea, is right up the street.  A drink there costs around $3-6.  At MO, a pot is $12.  A pot is meant to be shared.  Trust me, MO is not known to skip out on quality.  Walk into their bathroom nearby, and you'll see; it's the best bathrooms on the strip.

Anyways, the tea was great.  Except for the matcha- I have now established that I hate pure matcha green tea.  They also have condiments upon request, like sugar (cubed or powdered), honey (in tiny jars), milk, and other stuff.  We ordered a bunch of scones and pastries one time, and they were all great.

One evening actually, one of the workers told us that the sandwiches were replaced every hour, so if they're not eaten or ordered, they're just going to be thrown away, only to be replaced by a freshly made batch.  Luckily, we came in during the last 30 minutes of the lounge.  We got A LOT of sandwiches and other goodies.. for free.

It helps when you're nice to people.  And when you don't act like a stuck-up tourist thinking that you'd be treated like kings.

I mean, yes, you will be, but it makes all the difference between receiving amazing service that goes over the top, or a confused waitress who doesn't know what she's doing.

Oh and by the way, someone earlier complained about it being too quiet.  That place is GREAT for business meetings and for people to just relax.  Omfg, it's TEA.  You want a lively atmosphere with drinks?  We got plenty- go to Diablos, the Freakin' Frog on the east side, or better yet, Hooters.",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,6,5,5,keLE1ty0ltp5I3oMnnwbUA

It is almost like an adventure because you never know whether you'll taste something tangy, sweet, or savory. Afternoon Tea service for two with all the sandwhiches, scones, and desserts will add up to $95.66 and that includes the $13 gratuity. We didn't get to sit next to the window because it was always on reserve for someone. I recommend making a reservation for a window table because there are only three. Next time I bring a friend I plan on making a reservation for one of those seats. Each person will get to choose a tea of their own. One pot of tea actually is really reasonable though. We had two tea pots and could not finish them both. We just had to choose two teas because we purchased two sets of the afternoon tea bundle.It really is a nice place, very relaxed. I tried the Lychee green tea and the dragonwell green tea. Both were so smooth and tasted amazing! I almost wanted to ask if they could put it in a to-go cup for me. There are also champagne packages for large parties. I don't remember exactly the price but they are over 100. I thought the tea lounge would be in a room, but it actually is in an open space at the top of the mandarin hotel. It is right next to the front check-in. They call it a sky lobby because the actual check-in lobby is at the 23rd floor. A little hard to find with all the different buildings in city center, but if you ask anyone of the workers they can point you in the right direction. Great first time experience.

Please let everybody know about that. 
Today we came at 10 a.m. because website says that tea may be served and desserts in accordance with menu, but no, we were said nothing is ready, only at 12 p.m., so what for you open at 10 a.m.? Another time we booked a table for 5 p.m. and it turned out only bar is working. What is wrong with serving tea and desserts all day long?
Launge is really small, just few tables next to registration, so no intimate atmosphere.

Mandarin Orange Blend - This is one of their signature blends. It's a black tea and will get rather bitter if you leave the tea leaves in. It lacked a bit of fragrance and taste for me but nonetheless, it was a good tea. I think I'll have to opt for a Jasmine Pearl or a Lychee next time. The tea also comes with very delicious biscotti. 

What I really like about this place is the knowledge they impart to you about the tea. I learned that the water should be a boiling 212F and the tea leaves should be steeped for 3 minutes. I also like that they check on you every so often and they come by to pour your tea if you cup is empty. Again, impeccable service.",BE4fE4R3TaVn8xy4sYYjbg,3,3,5,wGGm4bfsD1IIBKCcxPUY-A

They only have afternoon tea at 12, 2, and 4 pm so plan accordingly. The lounge is pretty small and has smaller tables with couches, so we split our group of 12 into 2 tables.

We ordered the afternoon tea set for each person, and the amount of food was surprisingly filling.  The scones were good and were delicious with the homemade blueberry and blackberry jam, topped with Devonshire cream. 

The second time I went, the menu changed slightly. We had raspberry and peach jams, as well as different sandwiches and desserts. 

The restaurant is located high up in the Mandarin Oriental hotel, so you get a good view of the strip while enjoying your selection of tea. Each person can select their own tea of choice, included in the afternoon tea meal. We all ordered different ones and were able to try different varieties.  Valet parking is available at the hotel and was complimentary with validation.

It was serendipity at the time to have found this because we would not have known it was there except for the valet telling us not to miss it and directing us to the 23rd floor. Nice guy to have clued us in because my hubby and I both considered it one of the highlights of that trip. (Another - the Chihuly Exhibit at City Center. Another, tapas at Firefly. Still another, a day at Red Rocks Canyon National Rec Center.) 

The serenity started the moment we walked into the Tea Lounge. The aroma of tea wafted through the lovely room and we were escorted by a beautiful young woman, one of the servers, dressed in the black skirt and white blouse of the staff, to a table by the window for a view of the hustle and bustle below. 

At roughly noon on a weekday there were probably only about six people in the lounge. For about $12 we shared a pot of perfectly brewed tea, with two complementary biscotti, and marveled at the number of people scurrying on the streets below us. Enveloped in the peace of the tea room I asked my hubby, ""Do you suppose this is what God sees?"" 

High tea service starts about 2:30 I think and goes to 5:00. Even at $40 / head for the high tea, it seems like entertainment and sustenance all in one that is a lot bigger bang for the buck than some other LV experiences I can think of. 

The tea lounge is beautiful from any seat, but a window seat makes all the difference for seeing the view.  Looks like the secret is out about this peaceful oasis from LV chaos and tea reservations might be needed if want a window seat.",3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g,2,3,5,xbTbSx6zH2wyB12NrYkHUA
2148469,2015-08-14,1,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"This review specifically concerns the vegan afternoon tea offering.  I had noticed that the Mandarin offered a vegan tea but couldn't find much info on it online. I called in advance to ask what would be on offer, and a very helpful person read off four different vegan sandwich flavored and mentioned assorted pastries. I wanted to make sure I understood correctly about the pastries, so I clarified, ""vegan pastries as well?"" and was told yes. She said she couldn't confirm the exact type since they vary, but there would be options.

That sounded good to me, so I made the reservation. I was excited to have a high tea (it's been a while), so I barely ate breakfast. What I actually got was only two flavors of sandwich, a plate of fruit, three mochi (sticky Japanese rice sweets) and one chocolate dipped strawberry. There were no tea pastries at all. It wasn't enough to serve as the brunch I had hoped for, so I had to go home and have a snack!

In summary, it is a very underwhelming offering. The tea room and service are lovely and it's nice to know they have the option for someone who comes along with a group or similar. But I definitely don't recommend the tea for any vegans who are actually looking for something resembling a traditional high tea.

2149382,2016-01-02,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Worst tea experience ever, and a waste of $200 that I would have rather spent elsewhere. Made reservations for 6 with my friend and our children. This isn't the first time that I've taken my kids to a tea lounge (we've  been to tea at the Four Seasons and other lounges in San Diego).  Our server, Jingle (yep, that's her name), was not rude in any way, but she wasn't exactly helpful.  When we ordered 2 children's teas, and wanted to order an EXTRA juice for one of the other kids. She told me that if i ordered 2 children's teas, I could only get 2 drinks. I repeated that I would pay extra for another juice and she said ok. But she never brought it out.  We were seated at a couch and the tea setting was placed on a coffee table.  It wasn't exactly the best setting to sit and enjoy tea and food, without potentially knocking something over on the cluttered table.  The food itself was not memorable -- I was really surprised to see that in the cheese and turkey wrap, that they used KRAFT cheese. That's not real cheese and I've lived on that processed orange stuff most of my childhood, so I know it was Kraft Singles -- not what I expected for a $30 kids tea.  

Also, the ambiance of the place -- it's so freaking quiet, you can hear a pin drop. NOT the kind of place I would take my kids as we were so afraid our kids' every movement and raised voices would disturb others.

When it was time to leave, we waited for Jingle to come back so we can ask for the bill. Jingle walked by a few times and helped out other tables and made no eye contact with us.  I walked away and found another server who gave me the bill and packed up our food.  Overall I was really disappointed in the service, the setup (I made reservations months in advance and mentioned we would have kids and requested seating in an area in the room that was least disrupted - they obviously ignored that or didn't care to contact me back and tell me this place that was kids friendly).  I would say this was the worst memory of our Las Vegas vacation.

We were actually staying at the Four Seasons and we made a special trip to Aria for High Tea here at the Mandarin Lounge. I regretted my decision as soon as we were seated and wish we stayed and had High Tea at the Four Seasons.",i99bjunvKhc-O9_n460jBw,5,0,1,KNboZ6bGSw66ZFgjLzoJhg

The Skinny: Although a beautiful view, the uncomfortable seating, misses with the food and tea made this place a (3) Service: a little on the slow side, the service was only so-so (3), Value: now only 1 refill of the petit fours, scones and sammys... boo! (3)

After a lazy Sunday morning, I decided to treat the hubby to a relaxing afternoon tea at 3 pm. When you're making reservations for 2 people, it's relatively a breeze with Opentable.com compared to my large group experience.

There are very few places that serve afternoon tea on the Strip. The Mandarin Oriental gets bonus points because it may be the only one on the Strip that offers spectacular views, operates every day of the week AND won't leave you smelling like you've been cavorting around the casino all day (ie, not smokey!).

For our little tete-a-tete, we both ordered the classic afternoon tea set ($40 per person, choice of loose leaf tea, 1 refill each of scones, sandwiches, and petit fours). 

After being spoiled by the Pennisula in Chicago, their tea service is okay in my books. Pet peeve - I didn't like the fact that their loose leaf tea was served without tea leaves in the teapot. And while my jasmine white pearl tea was quite nice, the matcha tea was overly mild and lacked flavour.

There were some issues with the food. The sandwiches had quite nice fillings especially the curried chicken sandwiches (admittedly the ham sammys were a little on the unoriginal side). Unfortunately, the bread was a little too dry which detracted from the overall experience. 

Scones, served appropriately warm, were a little too mushy on the inside while the devonshire cream lacked that buttery, custardy aroma. The homemade preserves of blueberry and mixed berry were ho-hum and didn't offer something exciting (the fig jam at the previous event was much more intriguing and delicious!).

Finally, the petit fours tray. The only dessert I wouldn't have minded a second taste was the almond/marzipan macaroon. Slightly chewy, the almond paste really knocked that cookie out of the park for me. The opera cake chocolate ganache tart and matcha financier were texturally a little dry. The chocolate/caramel tart was overly sweet.

The service, considering how much you are paying for an afternoon tea here, was okay but not spectacular. Our server took a long time to bring out our tea and didn't refill our glasses of water. She also forgot to bring out refills of our condiments.

This ultra modern, sleek design mixed use area is home to the Mandarin Oriental hotel.  Upon entering the MO, guests travel up to the twenty-third floor to the Sky Lobby a refreshingly unique concept.  However the Tea Lounge is just sort of there by the check-in desk.  It has all the charm of a Starbucks kiosk in any lobby in any hotel in any major city in the country.

Once seated guests are treated to an amazing view of the city.  The couches are extremely comfortable for lounging, not necessarily ideal for eating.  The tea selections are seemingly endless with different herbal/floral combinations.  The food offerings are meager to put it nicely.  This is after all a high tea experience not a true meal.  One would be advised to skip the full tea spread and opt for scone which are, by far, the best thing on the menu.  The tea sandwiches began life as unimaginative snacks, then they dried out and lost any appeal or zest.  The dessert offerings seemed like a frozen sampler that might be put out in the lobby of a retirement community.  The scones were different, they arrived warm and buttery and were a delightful accompaniment to the many selections of teas on the table.   The mixologist at the MO is also quite creative and one should sample one or more of the unique drink selections on the menu.    

There is a feeling of refined class in the City Center complex and the Mandarin Oriental is no exception.  The fixtures and displays are beautiful.  The choices in furnishings and surfaces throughout reek of class and sophistication; however, the servers have soaked in a bit too much class.  During one tea service, there were at least four different servers that touched our table, and I cannot remember one giving our table a genuine smile.  I believe the meter has tipped over to the level of snooty.

This experience is one that would be nice for a couple or small group staying in the City Center, as a break from the typical Las Vegas itinerary.  However, it was not particularly memorable.

First of all, the location of the tea lounge is in the Mandarin's lobby. So it feels more like playing pretend than an intimate high class tea experience. Also, they didn't have the AC properly working, so it was rather hot and humid for an otherwise pleasant day.

Chairs/couches were not made for people over 5 foot. It's very uncomfortable and impractical to sit in low chairs crouched over a small table. 

The tea is fine, it's tea.

The snacks were not fresh. They serve a little cone with curry and poached Asian pear and the cone was soft, not crispy. Also, Black Forest ham is supposed to be a raw smoked ham (originally from the Black Forest in Germany). The ""black forest ham"" sandwiches were just ham sandwiches. Just boiled ham, not smoked.

Beautiful skyline view of the strip. We has the Jasmine early gray tea-sooo good, with the tea sanwiches and pastries. Everything was fresh and properly presented. The mini sweet brioche with brie & salmon lox was spectacular. The persimmon with curry in a cone was by far one of the unique flavors that hit my food pallet while visiting Las Vegas. The sweet brioche with tuna topped with a piece of peach was delicious. 

You must have afternoon tea here. I don't recommend coming with young children-the atmosphere is a calm/relaxing one allowing you to take in/enjoy the tradition of having tea.",hr49JsojCF37IQDuNQKW7w,0,0,5,4c0GInmUdesC0J6D4AgtDg

The rum cake was absolutely awful in smell taste and texture.  Only 3 items were decent, the scone, deviled egg and the hazelnut tart.  I like the pineapple jam and clotted cream. 

It was a good thing we only ordered one set for the both of us.  We would have ordered another pot of tea but we were so turned of by the food items.  I've had better afternoon tea elsewhere for cheaper even.",jUZW1alRK8QvdZ-pH1OquQ,9,4,2,q4TSJCUvKUp5XnaPa-rpqw

First off, the staff is phenomenal. Extremely friendly and they answered all of our questions. 

There were 4 of us and we shared 2 tea sets. Although complicated to share some of the delicate items, it all worked out in the end, and was a perfect amount of food (none of us were starving). Some of our favorites were the scones (with the cream and raspberry jam, that I somehow managed to smother on every single bite because damnit, I'm on vacation), and the blueberry and pineapple coconut desserts. Really, I would invest an additional $12 for 2 more scones.

The teas we selected were the jasmine pearl and an oolong (monkey picked? er, monkey something). Both were delicious, although it was interesting that the tea leaves were not in the pot (they must brew it separately). I think next time I'll be more adventurous and try some others; they had a great selection.

Perhaps the best part of this experience is how lovely and cozy it is, drinking tea perched on a huge oriental rug, overlooking an amazing view of the Vegas strip. Will definitely be back.",f2c0zHEZf64GPxAcjP6pzw,4,3,5,VyN6tSEn49hLv9ioFbELLQ
2408810,2013-07-11,22,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"With the exception of a check-in snafu caused by the very ""green"" & inexperieced hostess, I'd have to say I had a pretty good experience at the tea lounge at the Mandarin Oriental.  I just have one point of advice, check your reservation with the hostess at least three times. By then, it may sink in for her.

Ok, let's carry on shall we?

Located adjacent to registration above the 23rd floor, you'd think the Tea Lounge was part of the lobby. But make no mistake, these premium seats come at a lofty price tag and a reservation to boot.  

Luckily, we were seated by the panoramic window as I requested and service, albeit a bit slow, was paced nicely and lent to the whole relaxing afternoon tea experience.  With that in mind, the tea selection was fairly limited but adequate for my needs. There were a host of green teas and herbal teas to accommodate most individual preferences and tastes IMO. Since I just arrived from a massage session, I went with the introspective herbal relaxation tea. The tea service runs from 2-5 pm daily and reservations are highly recommended as there are only a few tables in the lounge.  The views can be quite spectacular if you're seated by the window. We had a perfect view of the strip and City Center and the natural lighting was equally relaxing and calming.  

The food selections included a selection of finger sandwiches inspired by English afternoon ""high tea"" traditions, but where was the cucumber cream cheese?
In any case, the selections included a savory smoked salmon cucumber and watercress spread sandwich (my favorite of the bunch) egg salad & chives on brioche, curried chicken salad, and black forest ham. The tea service also included the best scones I've ever had in my life! These were buttery, light, flaky and irresistibly good. They came out nice and warm, served with some fresh berry jam, marmalade and an imported Devonshire clotted cream (extremely smooth and very addictive.) So addictive, in fact,  I found myself wanting to spread it on practically everything!  
Lastly, our afternoon tea service was completed with a selection of small bite sized desserts and pastries, which included macarons, tarts and chocolates.

By the end of the meal, I felt nicely sated and totally relaxed. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas but im going to have to put that hostess on check!

2417230,2017-08-02,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Tea Lounge is located in the sky lounge (top floor) of the mandarin oriental. While the main reason why people come here is for the gorgeous view - myself included, what truly makes this afternoon tea special is the service & surprisingly good food. Tip: If your on a budget, share the afternoon tea for one.  My girlfriend and I got one set and it was enough to fill us up. If your hungry afterward, there are millions of places to grab a small bite. Tip 2: Tip is included under service charge (18%). Tip 3: You usually won't have to make a reservation but if you want a window seat, make one! 

Service: What'd you expect from a 5 star hotel. Waitress was very polite and explained the menu in its entirety. Once the food came out, she explained every item as well as the order to eat them in. (5/5)

Tea: Offers a wide variety of loose teas  & tea cocktails. We got the organic green lychee tea which when mixed with small drops of honey, offered an amazing depth of flavor. Tea by itself is $12 and tea cocktails are $18. (5/5)

Food: After reading some reviews about how some of the desserts were overly sweet, I was pleasantly surprised. All of food tasted fresh and was uniquely plated. The scones were the highlight especially when mixed with the mango, raspberry, and clotted creme. Overall the food was very satisfying. (4.5/5) 

Ambience: While not the highest place to dine in Vegas, the views are still spectacular. The tea place itself is also well decorated. The only downside is the fact that the main lobby and tea lounge are not subdivided. As such, you can occasionally hear the main lobby people speaking. (4.5/5)

Value: The price of afternoon tea was $40 and all in with tax and tip, $50. My belief is that one set will definitely fill you up and if you and a friend are not that hungry, one set will be adequate enough to keep you full until dinner. For such a great location with good views, the prices are reasonable. (4/5) 

To summarize, afternoon tea here is a great experience for a casual yet relaxing time. Definitely check it out if you have the time.",UeDcq7FJjwMUgZzL4aAmmQ,6,1,5,Gx8ky-akgSSQORCaTwfNbA

2483367,2016-02-08,5,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Prelims: I have conflicting emotions about this place; on the one hand, when a place announces that they have English afternoon tea and it ends up costing as much as a nice sit-down dinner, you expect something that will be worth the cost of a sit-down dinner. However, when a place is called ""Mandarin Oriental"" I feel like I need to lower expectations re: what they actually know about teas. So....not sure whether it's my fault or the fault of the Mandarin but I was thoroughly disappointed with what I received here. The service was ok, as they came multiple times to check up on us, but I'm not sure that they would have been much help. Décor is ok, going along with the theme, but the location is very weird - it's situated right next to the customer service desk so it gets quite loud and people are staring at you while you're sitting - kind of creepy. The view is spectacular, nevertheless, although the chairs you'll be in to enjoy the view won't help much. 

I ordered the matcha tea - again, from a place called the Mandarin Oriental one wonders whether they know what they are doing or whether they have absolutely no idea how to brew a cup of tea. For most black teas, brewing is simple - get the water to near boiling temp, stick in tea, brew for 5 minutes, and take out the leaves. Matcha is much more complicated - to get optimum flavor, water should be no hotter than 135 F, the powder should be whisked into the water until frothy, and then drank. While a powder, matcha is pure green tea, so it needs to be treated as such. The servers boiled the water, let it steep, and then gave it to me. It was hot, acidic, and bitter - not the smooth nutty flavor I was expecting. Then again, maybe I was expecting too much? My wife ordered the Assam, but I wish they brewed the tea for longer than 3 minutes - it was unexpectedly light. I'm a tea snob, un-apologetically so. And if I'm going to a ""TEA LOUNGE"", and pay what could be 15 ounces of premium tea that I could purchase elsewhere and make a delicious brew myself, I expect the tea to be brewed up to par. Instead, it was improperly steeped and improperly made - not pleased at all. 

The food was quite simple (for a whopping $95, you get 2 teas and 2 of the following): a ham wrap, a mini salmon sandwich, a small crab cake, and bite-sized curry chicken on a cone, 2 butter scones (with clotted cream and 2 jams), and assorted pastries. All in all, very disappointing for what you pay for - yes it's a lounge but don't charge like a restaurant and then serve a ham wrap that looks like it's from Costco...I enjoyed the scones, very buttery and warm and served with 2 jams and clotted cream (aka Devonshire Crème), with the cream made in-house. I've had clotted cream in the UK and this was very close to the beautifully creamy spread that I had over in the UK. Very well made and very delicious as was the other 2 jams. I did like the curry chicken, but overall, I do not think that this should have cost what it did, despite the view. Presentation was definitely pretty - but as I said in another review, I would rather have delicious food served poorly than bad food served prettily.

TL; DR Don't know what I was expecting, but was sorely disappointed.",gfTNiFPbokSYj55410GPpA,15,4,2,aRO7ednKIwBBKCuUP-MFmw

I went to the tea lounge many moons ago when it first opened (in my pre-Yelp days) and always planned on coming back. My love brought me here on January 1st with our best friends to celebrate the New Year in style...I can't believe I waited this long to come back! The setting from the 23rd floor is like nothing else. There are a few better views of the strip, but none that contain the same class and style as the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental. 

A nice variety of loose-leaf teas are available from several of the major tea-producing areas of the world. Accompanying the tea is a beautiful three-tiered presentation of finger sandwiches, elegant snacks, and a small array of pastries such as English scones, cupcakes and macarons. We also opted to celebrate with a bottle of champagne. You can also choose to enjoy coffee, juices, cocktails and the like. The items we ate were different than what other Yelpers recently reported. That could have solely been due to the Holiday Menu. I don't know how often they change the menu, but I'd like to return often enough to know.

Oolong tea is one of my favorites, so I choose a Monkey-Picked Oolong on this visit, but a quick glance of the menu reveals some quality tea offerings, so don't hesitate to go with what you enjoy.

As we walked towards the Mandarin Oriental, went inside and sat in the elevator rising up towards the Tea Lounge, my heart skipped 10 beats due to excitement. I was definitely an excited girl that day!

We were seated by the window overlooking the strip (that day they had part of the strip closed off for a while because the Nascar were doing a pre-show... Randomly we got to see the Nascar drift and all that jazz! Lol). Mary Anne was our server, and she actually recognized my friend since he comes here so much, Lol. He is definitely popular! Hahaha! She was such a sweetheart and explained the new temporary additions to the menu for winter. We ended up getting the Classic English Afternoon Tea set up, which came with several wonderful snacks and the choice of any tea in the menu.

I chose the Lychee Organic Green Tea, and my friend chose the Peach Tea, which were both very calm and soothing! Mary Anne brought us honey and milk for our tea, along with our small little treats!

About the treats, they were all really amazing, but I never knew how much the scones at starbucks and any other coffee shop were INCOMPARABLE to their scones here! They were fresh out of the over, and tasted absolutely WONDERFUL with the jellies they brought out!! I NEED MORE SCONES!!

TREATS:
Smoked salmon & cucumber with watercress spread- YES!
Creamy deviled egg in a shell with Paleta Iberico & lavash
Tartlet of mango with foie gras mousse & spice bread crisp- YES!
Black forest ham sandwich- YES!
Signature scones with imported Devonshire clotted cream and Chef Philippe's house made marmalades and jams- YES!
Random assortment of Tea pastries- YES!

I felt like royalty as I approached the radius of their property with Moises in front of Mandarin Oriental extending me help with my luggage. 

The Tea Lounge is located on the 23rd Floor of the Mandarin Oriental and there is a limited amount of seating. Usually it is recommended that you make a reservation 24 hours in advanced. The decoration is traditional Chinese-inspired with a sophisticated modern touch. The view of the strip from this angle was absolutely stunning and at moments entertaining since the ads kept changing.

I opted for the Traditional Afternoon Tea ($45/person). 

Each Tea set includes a pot of tea. I fancy myself to be a tea connoisseur so I really appreciated the tea selection here. Their tea leaves are a premium quality that has been meticulously selected, sampled and underwent testing process through European, Japanese, and US processes. Their selection is also impressive. It took me a while to narrow down my options, but Anisa was very helpful and I ended up choosing the Organic Lychee Green Tea. The green tea was strong with just a subtle and perfect amount of lychee. I highly recommend the Organic Lychee Green Tea with just a smidge of their organic local honey. 

Sandwiches: 
- Chicken Curry with Trumpet Mushroom and Asian Pear on Sesame Cone
- Pumpernickel bread and Dill Cream Cheese wrapped by Cucumber, and topped with Smoked Salmon Tartar
- Egg Salad and Chives on Croissant Bread
- Black Forest Ham Sandwich

Scones:
- Original Buttermilk
- Chocolate Chip
Accompanied with a devonshire clotted cream, lemon curd and a house made jam and marmalade, which on the day of my visit was a Mango-Peach

Desserts:
- Cherry Macaron with a Vanilla filling
- Passionfruit Teardrop 
- Lemon Tart Meringue
- Choux au Chocolat 

Service was amazing. Anisa and Stephanie checked on me occasionally to clear my plates and to see if I needed any additional orders but i was already full after just the Sandwiches. I just enjoyed the tea so much that I kept drinking more tea and the bread probably expanded. This is most definitely one of my most enjoyable Afternoon Tea experiences and the price was surprisingly reasonable for such a lovely establishment.

1) Comedian Louie Anderson was having high tea there. If it's good enough for him, surely it's good enough for you.
2) I ordered a lychee green tea, which was light & refreshing but my companion's ""Nutcracker"" tea (black with hazelnut & vanilla flavors) was so bold, sweet & delicious--I highly recommend it if you like sweet instead of floral.
3) Everything was delicious. It wasn't just about presentation here (unlike other high tea joints); the tiny bites were exceptional.",kZJWAY828P8QZTqVYzhTCg,19,15,5,5hV2PTQQKmUGRqHdnzlYFA
2800997,2013-05-13,1,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"My husband and I experienced tea service for mothers day. We enjoy tea service and have been to many different tea rooms. We were so excited to try The Mandarin Oriental Tea Room assuming that it was going to be outstanding. I am sorry to let you know that this experience was extremely disappointing. 

It started when I called to make a reservation and asked about the Mothers Day menu because it was more expensive than the everyday menu. The woman on the phone informed me that they would be having something special for mother's day but she couldn't confirm exactly what it was yet. Satisfied with her answer, we went ahead and made a reservation. When we arrived at the tea room we asked the waitress the difference between the regular menu and the mother's day menu, she responded by saying that the menu was exactly the same but they just up-charge for the holiday. Nice...That's why I called ahead in the first place. Her response made me feel completely ripped off. 

For a tea room, the tea selection was quite small and even worse was that the staff was virtually unable to answer any of our questions about each of the tea choices. They didn't know anything about the menu and seemed annoyed that we were asking questions at all. As a tea room, we had assumed that the staff would have some knowledge about different kind of tea's, herbs etc. All of the other tea rooms that we have been to, the staff is very knowledgeable about tea and are happy to explain the benefits of each etc. Not at the Mandarin... I found this surprising! 

While the food was tasty the portion sizes were a joke. 4 tiny ( and I mean TINY) sandwiches, teeny, tiny scones and tiny desserts. Having been to many tea services we were not expecting a full meal, but these portion sizes were so much smaller than anything else we have ever seen that we were literally laughing and left hungry. I had a question about one of the sandwiches and yet again, the server could not answer my question.

When the bill arrived were were again surprised by the fact that gratuity had already been added. Really? for 2 people? I was less than thrilled to leave so much gratuity for a staff that was uninformed, unhelpful and clearly annoyed with us. Our bill was $113. We are not cheap and willing to pay premium prices for these kinds of things but this experience was so sub-par that I left feeling gauged. 

We live here in Las Vegas and had hoped that we were going to find one of our new favorite spots at the Mandarin but I guess next time we'll try The Four Seasons for tea service.",F8BA-7lh6LICh4rKIm6llQ,7,0,1,me7qxMX5Qwsi0yqyC8NSdA

Came here for my girl's bachelorette party.  Cute idea if you're looking for something to do in the afternoon with a bunch of your gal pals.  Otherwise, why would anyone have a tea party in Vegas? haha

Classic English Afternoon tea for around $40 bucks.   This includes a pot of tea, a plate of mini sandwiches, scones, and desserts.  Each girl could choose her own tea and I believe you can choose a second tea after?  I can't remember so make sure you ask.  Also you can get seconds of everything, but nothing more (of course I asked!).  I liked the Jasmine pearl and lychee tea.  Sandwiches were good but the desserts and scones were eh tasting.   Our service was nice but they seemed kind of slow sometimes and non existent when we needed someone.

They also have a Vegan menu you can ask about ahead of time.

The ambiance isn't that typical cutesy tea party room with doilies and hats, but very modern with a clean, calming atmosphere.  There's a great panoramic view of the strip, most of the tables were near the windows so that was nice.  

I don't know if this was worth 40 bucks to me, especially since I""ve been to tea lounges in SD and London for less with tastier treats.  But it is Vegas, the view is fabulous, atmosphere is nice and it's cool they have this offered if you feel like having some tea and snacks.

Little did I know, but when I asked the wonderful server about gluten free options she said, ""I will bring you special dishes. You will enjoy.""

I had the full Classic English Tea for only $36, and it was worth every penny. I also splurged and got a Teatini, which was delicious - just a little sweetness but a slight bitterness like tea itself. Crazy...just like tea!

Gluten free bread? Check. Creamy deviled egg whipped and served in an egg balancing on a stone egg topped with micro-greens and Iberico ham. Next, a smoked salmon and watercress sandwich, a black forest ham sandwich, a delicious fruit plate Add on several gluten free pastries, including a macaroon that was to die for, and you can call me MO biggest fan.

I tried several teas since all of my friends tried different ones, and each one was beautiful, and you could tell by the taste that these were high quality teas. The server knew which tea my friend would love when she told her what she felt like drinking that day. There are decaffeinated, caffeinated, herbal and medicinal teas, each one appealing in its own way. Absolutely lovely,  

The Sky Lounge is stunning and has one of the best views of Vegas, and everything about Mandarin Oriental screams sophistication, beauty, and elegance with a contemporary flare, For goodness sakes, there's a couch in the elevator that I may or may not have laid down on while going to the wrong floor twice.

Very nice tea menu, many flavors to choose from, some cocktails too, tea martini or teatini looked good to me. Ordered lychee green tea and teatini. Huge pot of green tea, I love green tea with honey not sugar, it was a little bitter and very strong. Teatini was very sweet cause it was made with agave, the flavors of the cocktail and green tea were perfectly balanced. Loved it! 

Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, as all the staffs at Mandarin Oriental, they just provide the best services on earth! After my teatini, we got really hungry and headed out to our brunch. It was a short but pleassant tea time, I liked it a lot.

I love the clotted cream as well. I always ask for extra but really would like to order a whole bowlful if they'd let me, it's that good and goes perfectly with their warm scones. 

On the food plate that is part of their Classic Tea is the chicken curry. It's really tasty and comes in a small come with fruit on top. The mango with crab is excellent as is the lox....something or other. The only thing I thought was mediocre was the turkey roll. You can make that at home and I wish they'd switch that out for something better. 

You will need a reservation and there is a time limit of 2 hours but that is plenty. Also, when you first see the 3 platters of food you may think it's not much, but it is quite filling. Also, you can get specific items to go. I believe it costs about $12 for 4 items. 

I recommend this place. It would also be a cute place for any type of baby or bridal shower but that would require an advanced reservation since it is very popular.",9RWszjXJWkR4u7nCDTfCVw,4,1,5,FKZjWNQv9st8dfjyZZSF1g

The mini desserts were good, but not memorable. The tea service is very filling and definitely serves as a full lunch.

Came here on our last day in Vegas since the BF had always wanted to come here and it was a great way to relax and kill some time before our flight.

My BF chose the Jasmine Earl Grey while I had Monkey Picked Oolong. The teapots are enormous! I felt just like a little kid again pouring tea into the cups. Everything looked beautiful and tasted delicious. The BF had a fun time playing with the creamy deviled eggs holder and spoon since they're magnetic. We had a late lunch and was still full so we weren't able to finish all the desserts. Service was prompt and not over bearing. Great relaxing environment.

The tea sandwiches consisted of smoked salmon tartar on pumpernickel bread, chicken curry with trumpet mushroom on sesame cone, 
some puree and truffle-flavored chip on croissant, and a
black forest ham sandwich. 

The smoked salmon cut with the pumpernickel had an optimal amount of salmon without tasting too salty. The caper garnish helped as well. 

The chicken curry seemed under-fragrant compared to chana masala but works well as a tea house hors d'oeuvre. 

The croissant tasted like, well, a croissant. The truffle chip thing made for an interesting addition.

The black forest ham sandwich seemed underwhelming. The bread had a gritty, hard texture that made the sandwich unappealing.

The tea scones, as suggested in the menu, came straight from the oven. The fluffiness, for all intents and purposes, becomes the metric by which other scones receive comparisons. It came with equally laudable marmalade and lemon curd.

As I do not normally ingest dessert, I refrain from reviewing the tea desserts. Moreover, as one accustomed to traditional Chinese tea, I refrain from reviewing the tea in detail as it does not match my preferences.

$45 may seem like a steep price to pay for some small bites and tea. However, as with any lounge, Mandarin Oriental's Tea Lounge justifies its price with not only its consumables but also its atmosphere. Its attention to interior decor and corresponding comfortably luxurious milieu, in addition to its friendly wait staff, make for a pleasant and relaxing experience.

The food was the best part of the whole experience. All beautiful plated and created. My favorite part of was the savory course with the creamy egg mousse in a egg shell. I also loved the scones. The texture was perfect and the jam was a delicious compliment to it.  

My only complaint would be that the service could have been better. There seemed to be only one person working for all the tables. There was probably about five groups there with varying number of people. We always had to flag down the person when she came around.

This was the Mandarin Oriental, so of course it wasn't cheap -- it was $36/person for high tea. There were six of us, so we decided to get three high teas and split between us. Of course, since the food you receive is actually meant for one person, it wasn't really enough, so we ended up ordering a couple more plates of sandwiches and scones. 

The food was absolutely beautiful in presentation. I liked all the savory foods, but the desserts were hit or miss. I wish I could remember everything that was served but I do remember the rum cake was a bit of a dud. It was a bit bland to me and had an extremely chewy/rubbery texture. I also did not care for the chocolate ball on a stick with orange-flavored filling. 

The scones were by far the best part. They were fantastic served with the raspberry preserves and clotted cream. It reminded me of my days in England.

The teas were also fantastic. We got the organic lychee green tea, the English breakfast tea and the third one eludes me but I didn't get to try it, anyway.

We called and made reservations for two with no hassle at all a day in advance. They even asked if we were celebrating anything special during the call and I told them that we were celebrating my husband's birthday. 
We arrived a bit earlier than our reservation, but they sat us quickly with no problem. If at all possible try and get reservations by the windows. We didn't specify during our reservation, but we were lucky enough to get the middle window seating with an amazing view of the strip. 
The tea quite delicious as we expected. The fresh out of the oven scones by far were the best from the three courses. The sandwiches could have been better, but were still quite good. 
They even brought out a birthday cupcake with a lit candle for my husband during our tea service! 
We were blown away by the great service and attention to detail. I definitely recommend visiting the Tea Lounge for afternoon tea!",f1Le9omxEHXbM2jQx6DelQ,0,0,5,n0PUCAjrQ75a09GmAnFIOw

With today's weather being around the 50-60 range the view was foggy of the strip and cozy. Love the harp music while sipping tea which came with a three plated course of finger food.

Cons: Cost of $38 a person before any add- ons or tax or tip for just a pot of tea and a few bites of food, you are better off going to a buffet and getting your desserts and tea there...it's the same quality honestly. Nothing special. I am a foodie so I am not afraid to spend a lot of money on food. However, I am also big on getting what I pay for, and this disappointing experience I would not repeat again. Please note that it's not necessarily the cost or portions that turned me off, it's the lack of quality. My friend and I left feeling feeling completely unsatisfied and underwhelmed.

Unfortunately, we had just arrived and eaten at another restaurant, so we did not sample any of the food, just had tea and a fruit platter.  I had made reservations beforehand, and had requested a window seat, but there wasn't available when we had arrived.  Afternoon tea is served from 1-5 PM daily.  

We ended up ordering a fruit platter ($12) and a pot of Jasmine Earl Grey tea ($12).  I love Jasmine tea and Earl Grey tea, so it was a nice mixture of both teas.  The teapot is pretty huge, and it was enough for four people to share.  The fruit platter was good-it was a mix of berries, melon, and pineapple.  

In the elevator, they have a bench inside the elevator.  I thought that was weird.  Also, there is only like 3 buttons, one that takes you to the main floor, another to the tea lounge (on the 23rd floor), and I forgot what the third button was.  I am guessing there is a separate elevator for the main hotel?

Overall, I thought it was an okay experience for high tea.  Service was okay-it was a bit slow, and often the waitress would disappear and we would have to flag another waitress down.  Gratuity is automatically added to your bill.  I was disappointed that we were seated way in the back of the lounge.  I may come back, but maybe not when I'm so full from lunch, so I can fully enjoy the tea and treats.",3xFZGM7ViBzM0VWoU5n2wQ,1,2,3,EbJIdWDKXsV3mEOoE0wRCQ

PROS:
-beautiful view
- delicious teas
- very fancy, elegant
- waitresses are very asian inspired dress and high etiquette
- quite and elegant hotel

CONS:
As a person who doesn't normally have fancy tea time ever
- waitress could have explained options better or asked if it was our first time
- pricey

I thought i was ordering a cup of tea but it was actually a kettle. I wish I would have known as there are no prices on the menu. We ordered a kettle each, so there was no way we could drink soo much tea. I would have rather ordered one tea and had more food, I didn't know we could share the food since it looked like a coursed snack or something per person. I was obviously confused i just wish that the waitress would have asked the simple and generic question ""have you been here before"", would have made my time more enjoyable.

Not to mention the waitress failed to check up on us and we were sitting there for awhile waiting for her to come by for the check. Theres not that many people at all..

Aside from that,
Order one tea for 2 or 3 people and then the little snack dessert thing to share and you shall be happy and give this place 4 or 5 stars.",xsu2wneu1udl8qazMalJGQ,3,0,3,LUvkc4s-MNbDV5QA-SnR7g

3294140,2010-08-02,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"The Tea Lounge is really more an area set to the side of the lobby and in front of the Mandarin Bar.  For some reason, I was expecting to have a more secluded area.  The lobby does not seem to get too noisy as it is small, so I suppose it is not really an issue unless you have a disgruntled hotel employee.

Another interesting logistical note is that they do not really advertise their valet parking, so you might drive right by it.  I am not sure how far you would walk if you decided to self park.  Since this is Vegas, valet charge is only a tip anyways, so unless you don't want someone driving your Bentley, then you should be okay.

Due to the recession or that it's location is pretty secluded, this place does not seem like it is too busy.  But enough people seem to know about this place, so you probably should get a reservation, especially if you want to sit by the window.  There are only two small (for two) tables and one medium (for four) tables right by the window.  However, you should get a decent view from the rest of the lounge.

Basically, you can either just get a tea for $12 that comes with a couple of biscottis a person or you can go crazy and get the $35-40 sets that have several fancy bites.  Unlike the SLS in LA, everything comes out all at once.  I did not order the set, so I cannot comment on the taste, but I am sure it is just fine.

The teas are of good quality, though I actually thought that the bottom of the kettle got a bit coarse for both the Puh Er and the Jasmine.  I guess I should have swirled it before I poured.  Tsk, tsk.

Service is top notch and very delicate.  The staff were all very lovely and well trained.  I was caught off guard since I haven't had decent service anyway in a while.  I had forgotten what it was like to be treated well.

Also, note that though it says high tea is served at 2:30, if you are not getting the special sets, you can just order tea or whatever if it just after lunch or you are early as I was.

In sum, if you love tea, have good company or would like some quiet time to chill and indulge yourself (I did see a solo tea drinker and she seemed to be having a nice relaxing time chilling out by herself), then this is your place.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,0,1,4,hE8zU0F1i5FTyEynHVPb9w

Mind you, this was the first time for the both of us, and I was pretty excited to try something different in Vegas!
As we walked in, it was quite smaller than what I had imagined... Which, I loved! ( I felt like it was more intimate) after ordering, they brought out teas, which were out of this world! Then came the food. Tea sandwiches were good, and the different flavors definitely played with your taste buds in such a way, I can't even begin to explain. So...

The dishes were yummy...except the salmon caper sandwich bite thing. If you don't like capers, stay away. I actually had to spit it out because I hated the taste. The capers were very overpowering.

Located in the lounge of the hotel lobby, which requires you to take an elevator to the 23rd floor. Gorgeous view of the Strip! Filled with lounge chairs and a few tables. It's a weird location and I would have liked something a little less out in the open. It seems like they just had all this empty space and didn't exactly know what to do with it, so they put something else together.

Jingle helped us out and she was polite but not as attentive as I would have expected. For the price we paid (including an automatic 18% gratuity) we expected the experience to include her checking up on us, pouring us more tea, etc. But all the service we got was removing trays that we had finished and asking if we needed anything.

That being said, most of the food was good. The scones were delightful, and the jams that accompanied them were excellent! The clotted cream was smooth and my mouth waters just thinking of it. The sandwiches were outstanding, especially the smoked salmon on brioche bun. I didn't expect them to be filling, but they were. My one gripe is related to the dessert. They were kinda dry, and a little too sweet. I tried a bite of each of them and was just not impressed.

The tea was fine, but I was expecting something life-changing, which I didn't get. I ordered the Jasmine Earl Grey, which was a little too heavy for my taste. (I wanted something subtle.) I don't remember what my partner ordered, which was a sign it was forgettable.

I had high expectations for tea at the Mandarin Oriental ($36/person), and expected it to blow my other tea experiences in SF out of the water. We made reservations a month ahead of time for 2:30pm on a Saturday for a party of 4. We actually wanted to change our reservations and go earlier, but they didn't have availability the day of. Although we arrived right on time for our reservation time, our table wasn't ready yet, and it took them close to 15 minutes before we were seated. That was a sign of how things would be for the remainder of the tea service:

The clotted cream was wonderful as was the jam, but the marmalade was too tart/bitter and no one used that. 
-Top Plate: Chef's Selection of Assorted Tea Pastries, Second Plate: Signature Scones, Bottom Plate: Smoked Salmon & Cucumber w/Watercress Spread, Creamy Devilled Egg in a Shell w/Paleta Iberico & Lavash, Tartlet of Apricot, Black Forest Ham Sandwich [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandarin-oriental-tea-lounge-las-vegas?select=eqbZNp0Xw6oZKAcPD2_kaw#VtEnjWbcAc2dnDvGfWghKw): The scones were pretty good, but everything else was pretty gross. The items all looked wonderful, but the taste wasn't there. The smoked salmon and cucumber was bland and watery, the deviled egg was too salty and had too much mustard, the tartlet was sour and the crust too hard, and the black forest ham sandwich was boring. The only item I would willingly eat again is the scone.
-Chef's Selection of Assorted Tea Pastries (Green Tea Cream Puffs, Chocolate + Hazelnut Buddha, Raspberry Mochi, Lemon Custard Tart, Red Fortune Cookie, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandarin-oriental-tea-lounge-las-vegas?select=eqbZNp0Xw6oZKAcPD2_kaw#CNaLwOyNY6EoB6L7_91lkw): Yuck- the only semi-edible thing on here were the green tea cream puffs, which were just ok. The chocolate and hazelnut buddha had a super thick chocolate shell, and did not taste good. The raspberry mochi was too sweet and gooey, the lemon custard tart was too tart, and the red fortune cookie just fell apart and had no taste. 
-Complimentary Birthday Cupcakes (For the 2 Birthday Girls, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandarin-oriental-tea-lounge-las-vegas?select=eqbZNp0Xw6oZKAcPD2_kaw#7kSv1GmMscaNBVqYC3FYeQ): Yuck! If these weren't complimentary, we would've sent them back since these cupcakes were dry and the frosting was hard. 

I can't remember any of the teas we tried since none were very memorable, which was also disappointing. I was surprised that the china they used for the tea service didn't feel that luxe or sophisticated. 

Service was just ok- our server was really nice, but she would disappear for long periods of time, and it took a while for our tea and food to come out. It also took her forever to check up on us and we had to flag her down to get the bill. Based on this horrible experience, I will definitely NOT be back for tea here, ever, and would recommend you do not waste your money here either.

I came here for the Classic English Afternoon Tea with my cousin on a Tuesday. This service is offered from 2PM-5PM daily, and it's $36.00 per person. With this option, you receive a pot of freshly brewed tea of your choice and a tower of assorted, dainty bites. For our two pots of tea, we ordered the Monkey Picked Oolong and the Organic Lychee Green Tea; afterwards, we ordered the Osmanthus Oolong based on the recommendation of our server. 

When it comes to teas I like to drink them as is, so each of the teas I tried were without sugar and cream. The Monkey Picked Oolong had a mild flavor. Compared to the other teas, its flavor was ordinary. My cousin sprinkled some sugar into her cup of oolong and noted how it tasted better sweetened. The Osmanthus and the Lychee were our favorites. I enjoyed the aroma and flavor of the Lychee. The Osmanthus is supposed to taste similar to champagne, but I wasn't able to detect a hint of that; however, it has a pleasing floral aroma. 

The assorted bites were delicious. For the savory snacks, I enjoyed the Curried Chicken Salad Sandwich and the Black Forest Ham Sandwich. The Smoke Salmon & Cucumber was also palatable, but it was my least favorite because of the cucumber. As for the Egg Salad & Chives on Brioche, it was mundane, but I could easily overlook this because of the rest of my experience at the lounge. 

The scones were accompanied by clotted cream and two kinds of marmalade that are made in-house. I actually prefer the scones and marmalades over the savory plate of bites.

Lastly, the pastries. I was pleased with each the assortment. I don't recall the names of each one we tried, but they were all delectable. 

The service at the lounge -- actually, the Mandarin in general -- is simply one of the best in Las Vegas. The stellar service begins almost immediately after making a reservation, which I highly recommend doing even if you plan on visiting during a weekday. A day before our arrival, the lounge called to remind me of my reservation for the following day. At the lounge, our servers were helpful with answering our questions, and they attended to our table regularly. 

The Classic English Afternoon Tea is a bit of a splurge for $36.00 per person, but it's worth it. Definitely did I relax and unwind during my two hours spent up above on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,11,6,5,v9H89V85eX7jZzaalQ8PRQ

The lounge is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but it works. More intimate and quiet that way, I suppose. The space automatically limits the capacity to approximately 10 parties total that can enjoy tea at one time.

We had a window seat, which was fantastic- I did not ask for this but the staff were aware that it was my husband's birthday and I wonder if they put us there to make things extra-special! There was one weird incident when we were asked if another guest could share our table... we declined; it was awkward, but we still enjoyed the rest of our afternoon.

The afternoon tea is a bit pricey at around $45/person but you get a lot of tasty treats and my pot was refilled (on request) at no additional charge. (At $12 a pot, if you skip the full afternoon tea spread, this could be a pretty economical way to enjoy a great view in a classy setting on the strip, sans alcohol.)

They have a decent selection of basic teas; my husband went for a jasmine green and I had the Mandarin blend, which was black tea flavored subtly with (you guessed it) mandarin orange. The scones were delicious and so was the Devonshire cream and jam that accompanied them. We also had curry chicken, egg salad, black forest ham and smoked salmon sandwiches, as well as some very cute mini desserts (including my favorite, the sparkly purple macaron).

3582343,2018-03-12,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Afternoon Tea experience at the Mandarin Oriental is a truly unique experience on the fast paced tourist Vegas Strip. The setting is special - the lobby bar on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel. Seating is well spread out, and fairly intimate which makes it a great place for conversation. The window seats are definitely the premium spots with breathtaking views of the Strip.

Every Afternoon Tea experience begins with the selection of loose leaf tea, and the Mandarin Oriental doesn't disappoint. With a nice selection of uniquely crafted teas for the Hotel, you will find something special for everyone. We went with the Mandarin Oriental blend and the Lychee infused green tea, both were fabulously served steaming hot in large tea pots resembling your grandmothers tea set. Beautiful. 

The menu was what you would expect for the tradition tea culture - carefully prepared finger sandwiches including salmon, egg salad, ham and a fourth concoction we didn't quite recognize but tasted great. Unlike classic preparations, the Mandarin kitchen prepares these with a haute cuisine twist - truffles with the egg, TarTar for the salmon etc. all beautifully presented.

Next come the traditional scones and they did not disappoint. A plain and chocolate chip option are provided with the traditional clotted cream, lemon curd and raspberry jam. The scones are served on a hot plate and are served warm throughout the experience. 

Finally, the dessert plate was truly fantastic. A combination of chocolate, raspberry, orange, and Pistacchio cakes are beautifully presented in the form of bite size cakes. This is especially good given how full you are at the end of the whole experience.

Normally this would justify a 5 star rating but there is room for improvement. First, it took way too long to seat us for our 2pm reservation. We stood for 15 minutes as staff fumbled around preparing tables for several groups in a very confused fashion. Regardless the wait time and handling of waiting customers is just unacceptable for the Mandarin Oriental. Second, the service really isn't extraordinary. Once everything was served and poorly explained, we were checked on twice throughout the service and left alone. Our server just lacked proper training to adequately represent a 5 star establishment and its clients. Finally, our Chinese chairs were very uncomfortable and did not fit the table style - the legs get in the way of sitting comfortably and are just a mismatch. 

With all the opportunities for improvement, we will still plan to return to the Mandarin Oriental for the occasional Afternoon Tea experience. It's a ideal for a date for two or a small group gathering of no more than 5. Remember to reserve well in advance!",6YmRpoIuiq8I19Q8dHKTHw,2,0,4,JbqyhaX5XMrsy987J9YiVw

Deciding on what to wear for a little upscale afternoon tea was tough, but I would say don't overdress, just go for a bit more than your usual ""casual"" attire.

Anyways, going into the whole experience:
Service was great, we were seated almost promptly (per our reservation), and the server came to our table right away.
We got seated right next to the window, so the view was amazing.
We each picked our own tea. My friends and I were actually worried that we would probably leave the place hungry, but the sandwiches and other pastries that came with our tea actually made us pretty full. Scones were the best. They were warm and soft, side condiments, including jam and butter, complimented the scones perfectly, especially the berry (I think) one!
If you have any dietary restrictions, you can let your server know before you place your order.
All in all, this was a great experience and will definitely come back.

Best scone I ever had (better than blackcurrant scones at  four seasons hotel in Vegas). Mandarin orange tea, earl grey, and lychee green tea all go well with pastries.

The food is ok, the desserts were not on par for the price. The sandwiches were really tasty although the ham sandwich was a little heavy. The egg salad was the best one. For all, the bread was a little hard and slightly dry. 

The best things here are the scones! They are extremely buttery and delicious!! The strawberry jam was the best of the three. Usually I prefer my Devonshire cream a little lighter, this one was more buttery.

Remember to ask for seconds (you get seconds of everything if you want). Especially of the scones!

Tea-wise: the tea was OK, the white tea (jasmine pearl) was the best- it is a flowery white tea, delicate in flavor, but rich in aroma. The green teas were decent, the lychee tea was the best of the three.

Enjoy an upscale tea party with pastries and finger sandwiches. You'll get to sip your tea and munch on  treats on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin. Relax, unwind and soak in sweeping views of the fabulous Las Vegas strip. 

Reservations?
Yes. Go ahead and make reservations and request a window seat for your party. I didn't and wish I would've asked for this when I placed my reservations. 

Worth it? 
Yes. Come here to chill out, sip some tea and enjoy treats while overlooking the strip with their floor to ceiling windows. My guests and I arrived a bit early and were able to be seated immediately. Their tea selection is ample and we all truly enjoyed ourselves. I would recommend this for those seeking solitude from the Vegas chaos. It would also be nice for a group of friends looking for a unique and relaxing environment to catch up. 

Where:
Make your way to the elevator and head up to the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. 

Service: 
This was the only misstep of our visit. I would expect more for the venue. Overall, it was a bit slow and we had to flag down our waitress for various items on multiple occasions. She was friendly and pleasant during our interactions. They automatically bill gratuity and I felt they didn't have enough servers for the room. I would rate service 3 out of 5 stars. 

Overall:
This was my first time experiencing an afternoon tea and it was treat to enjoy it here. The lounge itself was smaller than I anticipated but we still enjoyed ourselves. My 2 guests and I enjoyed the ""Classic English Afternoon Tea"" for $38 per person (note- gratuity that will be automatically added on). The view and atmosphere alone will justify your visit. This ""Classic English Afternoon Tea"" option included our choice of tea with finger food sandwiches, pastries and scones.

We ordered 1 tea service and 1 ala carte tea (we just wanted a light snack as we already hand lunch). The ambiance is quite nice and mostly peaceful (until this large group arrived toward the latter part of our tea-this group was staying at the hotel and just using the lobby lounge for drinks but they did not use their library voice-this is one of the reasons I can't give it a 5 star). The scones were delicious, the sandwiches were o.k., and the sweet treats were yummy. I liked the casius bubblegum macaron and the fig cake the best.

The first thing I noticed when I first stepped into the Mandarin Oriental is that it is definitely a sanctuary of peace and calm in the midst of a bustling tourist city full of lights and noise. Definitely a great place just to relax and enjoy the company of your friends, tea, and good food.

Two of us went here on a Sunday afternoon and made a reservation, which I'm glad about because it was pretty much to full capacity by the time we got there at 2pm. We both got the classic afternoon tea, mine with lychee green tea and his with oolong. The thing I liked about the tea was that it was served at the right temperature, and that they didn't leave the leaves in the pot. The flavor was also unique; it definitely had that hint of sweetness from the lychee.

As for the food, it was very nice. The afternoon tea comes with three plates of food: sandwiches, scones, and desserts. The scones are AMAZING! Probably not the healthiest for you, but they were mouthwatering, melt-in-your-mouth awesome. They came with different types of jams and Devonshire cream which were a great complement to the warm, flakiness of the scones. I also really liked the little sandwich platter, which comes with a variety of fillings like egg salad and curry chicken. The dessert plate was also quite good; my favorite from that were the macaroons, chocolate balls, and the nut nougat. I wasn't a huge fan of one of the desserts because it was chalky though.

In terms of the service, it was a bit slow at first; I think it took a while just to get our tea out (probably around 15 minutes) and probably another 15 minutes after that to get our food. I wasn't in a hurry, though, and I suppose this lends to the very relaxed atmosphere of the tea lounge. Our servers were nice though and attentive.One thing to note: they do include gratuity regardless of party size, which I thought was a bit odd, but whatever.

3805368,2017-04-30,1,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"I've been going to tea houses and lounges my whole life, so I'm a bit picky when it comes to afternoon tea.  Tea Lounge at Mandarin Oriental does a decent job in some areas but falls flat in others.  

THE GOOD
* The view of the strip from the lounge is AMAZING.  I requested to sit by the window a week or two in advance and they honored my request even when I had pushed back our tea time 4 TIMES! Mind you, it was a Monday afternoon so the lounge was more than half empty, but I still appreciated them honoring my request AND being so patient with me with the changes in reservation.  The customer service gets an A.  I was going to give it a B since I had told them ahead of time it was my birthday yet when our meal was done and the check came out I did not receive a birthday dessert.  I had to ask the waitress, ""So, do you guys not do anything to celebrate birthdays?"" to which she became very embarrassed and apologetic.  She told me there must have been a miscommunication since she was not informed it was my birthday and then hurried to package a birthday dessert to go.  She seemed so sincere in her apology that I gave her a good tip and I've decided to keep their customer service an A rating.
* The apricot scones were the best part of the meal.  The Devonshire's cream with the fruit jelly paired really well with them.  It was my boyfriend's first time having afternoon tea and it was horrifying yet equally hilarious to watch him eat the scones like a burger! XD *smh*

THE MEH
* The tea was a bit disappointing... it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  I got Peace Through Water, and despite it being one of their most popular brews it just didn't do much for me.  I almost switched it out for a Jasmine tea but once the food came out I felt like the tea did pair well with the scones and such, so I decided to keep it.
* The desserts were also a bit meh... They were certainly pretty but the taste was weird.  Again, not bad but not good either.  The only one I enjoyed was the lemon creme with the ginger cookie. 
* The atmosphere of the lounge was peaceful and I liked the glass tables but I was surprised by how tiny the place was.  The pictures online make it seem much bigger and grander.  Nope, not the case.  It was more like a giant living room next to a giant window.  I will say their bathrooms were really elegant BUT there is no gap or ventilation on the bathroom stall doors so if the person who previously used it was super stinky their smell lingers on in the toilet.  I, unfortunately, know this from the sad experience of opening one of the stall doors and having a giant gush of ""Oh my gosh what the heck did you eat??"" stinkiness hit my face.  Not fun. -_-;

THE BAD
* The sandwiches were gross.  I requested their vegetarian fare, so we were served these cucumber sandwiches with vegan mayo and, ugh, they were SO SOGGY.  It was gross picking them up, being they were just wet and mushy.  I eventually just used my fork but then actually eating the sandwich was not fun either.  The taste was really bland.  They also served us the pickled who-knows-what in a mini waffle cone.  The presentation was nice but the smell, and more so the taste, was disgusting.  I took one bite and couldn't finish the rest.  Probably the worst tea sandwiches I've ever had.  Hopefully, they were just having an off day but I don't really want to try them again to find out...

Overall, it was an ok experience but it definitely was not worth $40 per person.  I'd value it $30 tops.  If you haven't been here before I'd probably recommend trying it out once and doing so later in the afternoon so you can enjoy the gorgeous view during sunset hours.  However, if you do decide to try this place out, I'd recommend just coming for tea and scones (and laughs, if you try eating the scones like a McMuffin XD)",znABVsEg8_ZOujgNRf_H_g,2,0,3,UymEU78HmFEEblEJ5_MTZA

Tea is a big part of our life, so having this in Vegas is fantastic. We came around 3pm for afternoon tea, and choose ""Classic English Afternoon Tea"" Just for 1 because I know the food served with it would be enough for both of us. Then ordered another pot of tea. We both choice ""Monkey Picked Oolong"" because it my absolute favorite. Our sever was young, and very nice at explaining everything to us on how the afternoon tea works. The other customers were business professionals, and older wealthy looking women. So it is defiantly an upscale event. The tea was brewed perfectly, and the pot of tea they give you last a good 4-5 cups. The snacks with it is presented 5 star, and the tastes are unique. My boyfriend was very surprised and was very pleased with the whole experience.

I've been to plenty of tea spots all over LA and the OC, but this is by far the most awesome tea experience I've had to date. The tea  room itself is pretty small, so definitely make a reservation. I had a reservation for 7 girls as part of a bachelorette weekend. The bride and I always enjoy high tea, so I thought this would be a great afternoon activity.

We sat at a table that had couches and chairs. The seating was seriously so comfortable, we all could have easily taken naps. Service was impeccable- someone was always there refilling our tea cups or bringing us a newly brewed pot of tea.

Now, the food! Not everything tasted the best, but they definitely get an A+ for presentation alone. Everything was so perfectly sized and perfectly prepared. Their deviled egg was super creamy and served inside an egg shell! There was a tart with goat cheese, we all kind of agreed it tasted good separate but not altogether. The sandwiches were very light and tasty, the salmon one was the best. We also all agreed that the chocolate and peanut butter dessert was the best! I really adored their scones though- so warm and delicious. For $35/person, we all thought this place was excellent. It's ruined all other afternoon tea places for me!

Set in the Sky Lobby on the 23rd floor of Mandarin Orietal, my girlfriend and I had already been impressed with the panoramic view even before we started our high tea experience.

Our server was very nice and knowledgeable. My girlfriend and I trusted her so much that we let her select every course from drinks to pastries for us. That was absolutely the right and brilliant idea! She had such an ideal selection for us. 

Our high tea experience was launched with matcha green tea and cappucino (I'm a coffee addict and cannot live without coffee.) Our server recommended we have the tea with soy milk, which tasted just PERFECT! The cappucino was rich in flavor as well. 

Then, an assortment of mini signature pastries and sandwiches started to come out.  All the pastries and sandwiches were dainty. Yet, the ones that truly indulged my appetite for snacks and sweets were brioche, black forest sandwich, scone served with cream, raspberry jam as well as cranberry jam (which was my favorite one), and velvet cupcake.

Moreover, the joint was quiet, so it would definitely make a nice and chilling getaway for people who seek for 'peace' or a 'moment to themselves' on the Strip. Totally recommended.",sN8cZ86HU9KV_aXe7IxV_Q,0,1,5,SmOxL2j79b8GKqqr7Bxvhg

Perfectly cut and how aesthetically appealing to the eye, it really pleases my OCD :) I have been to High Tea at Petrossian as well as Four Seasons, and had been looking forward to trying MO version, since only passing by the area, the view alone was worth a trip back. 

Served daily from 1p-5p, we had made a reservation not knowing how busy they get, upon arriving, there were a few open tables, but ours was right up against the window and offered amazing views from the 23rd floor. 

Looking over the tea menu, I chose the Organic Lychee Green and my friend chose the Mandarin Orange Blend. Neither one of these teas were anything special, I've had better tea at Starbucks, and I think Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe has a WAY better tea selection. The tower of food followed, and after a brief explanation from our waitress, we dove in. 

Starting with the creamy deviled egg (in a shell) with Paleta Iberico & lavash. This was the best deviled egg I've ever had, and I love how it as served in the shell. Up next was the smoked salmon & cucumber with watercress spread. This was my second favorite. Black Forest ham sandwich and the goat cheese tartlet with apricot jelly rounded out our savory portion, but the last two didn't impress me. 

The dessert plate was made of a selection of the assorted pastries, and the only one I really liked was the Yuzu shortbread. The others were way too sweet, a lemon chocolate cake pop, a rum cake cannelle  a blueberry creme puff.

The scones were probably one of the best I've had, but I love clotted cream, so smother any kind of biscuit with clotted cream and jam and you can't go wrong. 

For $90 for two people (they do auto-grat), I just can't recommend this. It was okay, but nothing spectacular.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,13,7,3,V6A5C2p2Hq1TVfB8_OG7ZA
3872171,2018-01-17,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"I'm glad they removed the mandatory 18% gratuity cost that everyone complains about in the reviews below. When the boyfriend and I decided to go, we took the recommendation of a few reviews that said it was a lot of food - plus, spending $100 for two people on tea just seemed ridiculous - so we did one tea set for 2 people. We both disagreed with this however, and feel like it is NOT a lot of food and it would have been fine for each of us to get our own tea order. 

I appreciate the fact that they did the vegetarian version no problem. I noticed other people had different desserts than us...though, I can't imagine the desserts weren't vegetarian, so I was confused on why we were the only ones with the dessert that we got. I'm thinking it's randomized on who gets what but not sure. We had a health tea I can't remember but it was lavender and chamomile. It was very very good! They had a slimey olive thing on a plastic spoon and were calling those the vegetarian ""sandwiches"" - what? 

We paid $48 for the tea with tax and tipped appropriately. No problem with the actual servers like some of the other reviewers mentioned. But I can't get over the price point on this one, especially when it IS in the lobby and just doesn't seem as fancy as high tea should be. Just my opinion. For what you pay I do NOT think it's worth it, but I read lots of reviews on here where people said it was. I took stars off for location of where they decided to put this tea, lack of value for your money, and less fancy than I thought it would be (we were only ones dressed up). We asked for a window seat but did not get one. We didn't want to go to the window to take a look because there's other people sitting right in front so I felt it would be rude to stand in front of them. I felt like I couldn't get the best experience because of this. One thing that just pisses me off and definitely deserves a star off is the fact there's no self parking at Mandarin Oriental. You have to valet for $20 (plus tip obv) and you only get your parking validated if you spend $100. We parked at Aria/ Crystal Shops for $12 and walked. Still a hassle, and for what you pay here you shouldn't have to go through all this trouble to get to the place and be forced to valet!

I was told how awesome the views were, but actually the views from any guestroom are just as nice.  You can't see all the way down the Strip, just a couple hotels.  

The atmosphere is nice in the lobby for tea service, and it's an eclectic mix of folks, but at the same time it's a bit too quiet for Vegas.  Yes it's high tea, but it's not a library.  

I was most disappointed by the cupcake flight!  The cupcakes were really small (like I couldn't even cut it in half to share) and they were dry and barely edible.  The tea was probably the best part; I got the green tea and it was some of the best tea I've ever had.

Nestled inside the Mandarin Oriental on the Las Vegas Strip you will find the luxurious tea lounge.  It's a few floors above street level and easily reached by elevator within the hotel.  

Take a peek at the champagne vending machine on the right as you exit the elevator, and you'll realize this is no Holiday Inn.

Reservations are recommended as the Tea Lounge is popular and does not have a ton of seating.

Traditional afternoon tea runs $45 per person which includes your choice of tea and an assortment of sandwiches, scones, and desserts.  We opted for the bottomless mimosas as well for about $25 extra per person.  You can choose from a selection of juices for these in addition to the standard orange juice.

The server was gracious and exactly what you'd expect in a five star establishment.  She was very knowledgeable about the various teas and flavors.

The entire experience was excellent.  The tea (tried the Mandarin Orange blend) was top notch, smooth, and delicately flavored.  The sandwiches were delicate and mild.  The chicken curry was a favorite here.  Lastly, the desserts were fantabulous.  They were small works of art and a perfect ending to the meal.

My friends and I made afternoon reservations weeks in advance. We were promptly seated upon arrival and given menus to peruse. We opted to split one tea service and added an extra pot of tea. The service is definitely pricey-- $40. We paid 17.50 GBP while in London, but I guess it speaks to the Mandarin's ambiance and clientele. 

Overall, the spread was beautiful and the lounge was peaceful! I enjoyed relaxing with my friends and not hearing the constant beeping of slot machines or yelling over the casino noise.

I can see why--Tea Lounge has great ambiance, wonderful tea, spectacular view, and exceptional service. This is a great place for a pregame in the late afternoon before an expensive/romantic dinner, a break from one shopping spree to the next, or a chillaxation from the perpetually frantic Vegas.  

Naturally, tea lounge has a variety of different teas you may choose from. I liked the Jasmine tea. It was stronger than what I am used to but after a few cups, I began to think that is the way Jasmine tea should be. My girlfriend got the Matcha tea. Just like my Jasmine tea, the Matcha taste was very potent. Note that you don't actually get any tea leaves in the pot. Also, you get free refills. 

The view is fantastic. I think tea lounge is on the top floor or close to the top of Mandarin Oriental. You get a pretty good view of the strip if you sit by the window. My reservation was at 11:45 am but I showed up at around 11:30 am and got a window seat easily. 

The service is undoubtedly a five-star experience. The server is knowledgeable about everything that is on the menu and will give you quite a few suggestions if you know nothing about tea. They moved gracefully and talked gently. They were attentive but never in a hurry. I mean, do you expect anything less from a Mandarin Oriental tea lounge?

The only thing I am not crazy about is the food/snack/dessert. I honestly thought the dessert from Wynn buffet is much better. I was expecting some unique items but all I got were generic desserts, tiny sandwich, and two scones. Maybe my expectation was too high but I just felt the word generic should not be used to describe any part of the Tea Lounge experience. 

Overall, the generic food items don't put the whole Tea Lounge experience in jeopardy. It is still a fantastic place to experience a luxurious tea drinking experience. I would love to come back to try something new. You should too.",96GpOsmTQa0UJSo_9JEOog,0,0,4,JmZFQV-nm9iehLypDTjz5A

The tea lounge was elegantly appointed (no Vegas garishness here), and was situated in a section adjoining the lobby of the 23rd floor. It's not in its own room and sits outside the Mandarin Bar.

It was a perfect afternoon break with the gals during a frenetic Vegas trip.

I got the afternoon tea set and the sandwiches were very good, as were the petit fours. A bit disappointed by the scone as it was quite light and soft, but it was plain and without flavor. On the other hand, some people may prefer that traditional version. The devonshire cream and jams served with the tea set were delicious and fresh tasting.

So as you can tell, there were many pros! The tea was also quite good and elegantly presented in glass teapots on votive warmers.

You just simply proceed to the 23rd floor sky lobby and the tea room is right next to the check in counter.  The views by the window are simply breathtaking, although lack of wow factor.  The service are on the level of a true 5 stars experience - friendly, knowledgeable about their products yet professional, which is rare in Vegas hospitality industries.  I was pleased to see this level of service in Vegas.  

I give 4 stars because the service is 5 stars, however the food is 3 stars, thus 4 stars rating on average.

The high tea comes with choice extensive choices of tea and 3 trays of tea pastries (top layer of tea pastries, middle layer scones, and bottom layer with tea sandwiches).   The bottom try sandwich came with Salmon cucumber, Chicken curry, black forest ham, egg salad sandwich.  I was quite underwhelmed with the taste of the sandwhich.  The breads were dry and it taste is either too salty or no taste at all.   Black forest ham was the best of all but still not remarkable. 

The scones in the middle are the best along with their strawberry ruhburb jam.  

Their desserts were disappointing, too.  The macaroon looks nice but the taste (Vanilla & Strawberry) did not impress me at all.  It was just pure sweet, their chocolates were quite average too. Lemon lavender cake was really sweet, I guess that can go with the tea well.  My favorite was the pistacho mousse with strawberry jam, but still that was very sweet at all.  For the name of the MO high tea, they still have quite some way to go.  There is no comparison to their sister property, MO Bangkok High tea.

4215396,2017-12-08,9,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Came here on the afternoon of the Solar Eclipse. (Aug 2017)

Mandarin Oriental is a bit tricky to find since you'll have to go through an underground pathway before reaching the Aria/Crystals Veer roundabout. Once you're there though, they only parking options you have is valet. Walk through the dark and masculine walls of bellman lobby, step into the elevator and you get to sit on a plush seat inside while it takes you to the top. Oooh, comfort. Doors a jar. To your right you'll see a vending machine for mini Moet bottles at $25 a pop, but you'll have to ask a front desk agent for a token to access it first.

Makeshift yourself to the center and you'll see the open space of the front desk. Floor to ceiling windows that aren't glared by rays of sunshine-- you'll know that the lighting for your snapchat will be decent. Saunter to the left of the front desk is a decorated hallway with white strings long ribbons swaying back and forth, if the room was dimly lit near blackness it would actually give a more haunting effect. This hallway leads to the public bathroom which is a whole world of its own.

Walk back to the front desk, and the Tea Lounge will be at your right, completely open in view. Beyond that though is a door that leads to the Mandarin Lounge that takes pride in its high-rise views and intimate bar setting.

The atmosphere was very ""Asianesque"" at most. You've got the autumn equinox colors of red, yellow, orange and smidgens of purple that it feels like royalty in the Bling Dynasty. My friends and I were seated at a table alongside the front desk area. Although I did request to be seated near the window area for a view, most spots were already filled by the time we got there. A request does not mean a guarantee, so it didn't bother me. The seats were plush and comfortable -- I sat on the couch with my friend -- however, it does have a tendency to make you sink into it. What with me being the shortest of the group made me feel a lot smaller than I already am! 

We had 2 orders of the afternoon tea lunch since our waitress suggested its enough for 3 people (this is by the assumption that we aren't extremely hungry and just wanted to enjoy the tidbits of high tea). Comprised of pastries, three flavors of jelly, a dainty selection of aesthetic desserts, and a few bites of savory items. As for tea, we opted for Jasmine Earl Grey (of course!) and Life Through Water as a Health & Wellness tea (because yerba mate). I personally favored both and really liked that they gave us cream and cute mini jars of honey for the Earl Grey tea. The yerba mate used in the Life Through Water tea wasn't bitter at all, and the lemongrass wasn't overpowering either. The desserts weren't ridiculously sweet but it was somewhat of a challenge trying to splice them for 3 people (I ended up having my friends mostly do it since their knife slicing precision was on point haha). 

On the whole, I would definitely like to come back here again with my girl friends for a girls day out though, I'm sure they'll enjoy and indulge on the orient aesthetics  and confectionary selections.",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,12,10,5,OeN94c5BJggLEppKVmAS_g

The tea is delectable and the desserts and pastries mostly very good.  It's a little strange how open the space is, but it works and you do feel like you are tucked away in your own little oasis in the clouds, away from the noise and lights of the casinos.

Afternoon tea is an experience to be savored, so don't expect to be in and out, but service was well-timed and the dishes came and went in a natural rhythm.

We came to our reservation a bit early and luckily being the first ones there, we got the best seat in the house, on a couch right in front of the windows! The lounge is not very big and it's right next to the check in desk lobby, so it's not a ideal place to come with a big group. 

Three of us got the Classic English Afternoon tea set at $36.00. 
Tea service is daily 2-5pm. 

You get a choice of tea, 4 tea sandwiches (smoked salmon, egg salad, curried chicken salad sandwich, and black forest ham), 2 small scones served with a very thick cream cheese like Devonshire Cream, pineapple marmalade and strawberry jam, and a selection of petit desserts.

Presentation was superb. Although everything was petit, i thought it was very filling. The sandwiches were yummy. (They are flexible with the sandwiches if you have food restrictions). I didn't love the salmon one, as it had a strong herby flavor. 

The teas were my least favorite. From the last 4-5 afternoon tea experiences, I have loved my tropical black tea choices. When i saw mandarin orange black tea, i was excited. However, when i drank it, it has a strong chinese herbal flavor to it, which i wasn't expecting and kind of clashed with the sweet desserts and sandwiches in my taste... We tried the monkey picked oolong and white tea, and none of them really had us craving to have more. 

Despite not loving the tea flavors, the experience was great and we enjoyed the view. The lounge itself is pretty gorgeous with all the colors. Check it:

4272143,2017-04-11,4,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Having been to the tea lounge in the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore and Tokyo, the Las Vegas location had big shoes to fill. The quality and service you receive in Asia just doesn't compare to what you get in the states. The Tea Lounge was great for Vegas standards, but compared to the Asian counterparts, sucked. 
$20 to valet park (don't listen to previous Yelp reviews, it's no longer free) at the Mandarin Oriental, or park at the casinos next door for free (make sure you check which ones are still free!) From the Cosmopolitan it was a short 5 minute walk. 
Take the elevators to the hotel lobby on the 23rd floor. The Tea Lounge is in the lobby, don't expect a closed off restaurant, it's literally couches in the lobby. The couches, tables, chairs looked and felt pretty old. Compared to the feeling of the rest of the hotel, it was pretty outdated. 
Monkey picked oolong: Not too strong of a scent, but the tea was good. You can ask for a refill on your pot!
Scones: With the jams and Devonshire cream were pretty good and worth the price. Plain scone was better than the apricot
Chive egg sandwich, curry sesame cone, ham sandwich: Both were really good and gave me high hopes for the rest of the plates
Desserts: This was what dropped my review. Too much time was spent on how these desserts looked and not enough time on the taste. We both took a bite out of each dessert and left the rest. They were HORRIBLE. So much sugar and everything tasted so artificial. The desserts were such a disappointment, I don't think I would recommend Tea Lounge to friends, because of that. 
The Tea Lounge is an experience you can't get anywhere else in Vegas. I know it's a popular spot for bachelorettes (there were two groups while we were there), however not sure if it's worth it.

Mandarin Oriental in LV is such a lovely hotel, indeed. Great service all around from the moment you step out of the cab to the doors opening into the lobby and riding up the clean elevator (with comfy seating couch). The hostess at the tea lounge was sweet, pretty and helpful. Led us to our table by the huge windows. Perfect setting and views of the strip/Aria next door.

We each ordered the $36 Classic Afternoon Tea Set, had the Jasmine Peal, White Tip Darjeeling, Organic Lychee Green and Imperial Spring Dragonwell. All the tea smelled really good! The presentation was awesome, colorful, decedant. 

So why the 3stars only? Aside from the Smoked Salmon Cucumber Watercress sandwich and the cute egg shell holding the yummy Devilled Eggs...nothing else appealled to me, either bland or too sweet. The scone with the buttery spread was the best from the numerous pastries and dessert selections. Everything looked really good but tastewise...hmmm. Maybe I just didn't have a sweet tooth that day cuz it was just ridiculously sweet, too over the top. The tea help washed everything down...so that was good.

The Mandarin Oriental's Tea Lounge is calling my name and for good reason. The sandwiches, scones, desserts, and tea are exceptional. They truly curate an unforgettable experience.

The tea lounge is a great place to relax and take it easy in the company of friends and loved ones, and view from the 23rd floor is breathtaking. The lounge itself is right next to the check in desk for the hotel, but the tea are itself isn't loud and the sound from the lobby doesn't carry over that much. 

We ordered the tea service which comes with 3 tiers of finger foods, biscuits, and desserts as well as your choice of tea. I got the jasmine tea, and it was perfectly brewed. It was light, refreshing, and clean as you would expect a jasmine tea would be.

My favorite of all the sandwiches/desserts/etc was the curry chicken salad in a cone with black sesame. You can really taste all the flavors and love they put into making the chicken salad. The black sesame also gives it a nice nuttiness while the curry gives it a little surprise from your regular chicken salad.

One of the more memorable items were the scones. There was a cranberry buttermilk scone and a regular buttermilk scone served with clotted cream, apricot preserves, and raspberry preserves. All I can say is that I basically hoarded all the clotted cream to myself and kept putting a generous pat of it on almost every bite. 

Overall, this is an amazing experience that I haven't been able to get out of my head. You can bet that I'll be coming here to see what new finger foods they come up with next!",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,4,3,5,fd1TQ_B8SbbE_57dlc-n9g

Situated on the 23rd floor, the Tea Lounge boasts amazing views of the middle of the strip with enough seating for about 8-10 parties, keeping the affair intimate and relaxed. 
The lady and I decided to go with Afternoon Tea service, which consists of two tea selections from a variety of choices, along with an assortment of eats including finger sandwiches, freshly baked scones and a platter of desserts. Luck would have it that the two types of tea we were looking for were not available so we opted for our second choice consisting of the Osmanthus and Mandarin Orange. 
Both were light, warm and refreshing with notes of fruit and floral essence. Our waitress, dressed in traditional Asian garb, provided us with a jar of honey which went great with my tea. 
We started our meal with fresh from the oven scones which were soft and delectable, especially with the Devonshire cream and tart, sweet cranberry jam. We then moved onto the savory portion of our meal, with the highlight being the deviled eggs and the smoked salmon wrapped in cucumber. The former was creamy, rich and flavorful while the cucumber wrap was refreshing and light. Lastly, we had a tray of desserts with a particular chocolate shaped like a bag.

Because it is in the Mandarin Oriental, I was expecting it to be a little more upscale. However, the view was spectacular and I guess you are paying for the view and not the tea.

My husband is a tea aficionado. He actually loves tea and knows more about tea than anything else in this world- I'd say he could be a tea sommelier if there is a such thing. He also had the same 3-star A-OK experience as I did.

We both did the English afternoon tea and with the tax and 18% gratuity (included on the bill automatically), it came out to be $96 for the both of us. This is more than what I would have paid for this quality of service and tea. My tea was light and I had wished that when they took my order, they would ask me if I like my tea on the stronger side. My husband's matcha was brewed at a temperature too high for optimal matcha taste so his tea was not as good as he would have liked (sorry if we sound like tea snobs but we paid basically $100 for afternoon tea and should get the best quality that money can buy). The tea snacks included a ham wrap, a mini salmon sandwich, a small crab cake, and bite-sized curry chicken on a cone, 2 butter scones (with clotted cream and 2 jams), and assorted pastries.

The aforementioned food was good for the most part however, the teas really didn't do this place justice.

We also didn't really like that it was in the lobby of the hotel so people could look over and watch you eat while they wait to get checked-in and out. This was a little distracting and weird to me. Also, the service wasn't really as up-to-par as expected. Maybe I was expecting too much; this is a lounge after all...

I don't think we will be coming back but we encourage people to come and see for themselves what afternoon tea is like at the Mandarin Oriental!

Note: The clotted cream (aka Devonshire cream) was absolutely amazing. If I could rate that cream on its own, it would be 5-stars all the way!

The hostess assured us upon arrival that it was perfectly fine that we were late as long as we put in our order before 5pm. The waitress, however, rushed our order and was obviously displeased that we came in late. Regardless, we ordered before 5.

Food was pretty good. The scones are absolutely delicious and the sandwiches were pretty tasty. The desserts were pretty meh; most were heavy and over sweet. The desserts tasted like the cheap kind you can get at Safeway. Tea was fine, I would have preferred a stronger flavor.

I was most displeased when I got the check. First, the waitress and the menu made no indication that certain tea flavors cost more when chosen as part of high tea. Second, they included a 18% service charge. There was only two of us and the rude waitress did not make me want to tip so much.

If that doesn't indicate how much I love this place, then I don't know what to tell you. Tea Lounge at the Mandarin Oriental is by far the best high tea experience I've had. I know there are other locations in the Vegas area that offers high tea which I have looked into but none seem to be on par with how elegant Tea Lounge is as well as the view of Vegas. 

Tea Lounge is by reservation only so plan accordingly and book your spot in advance. Each reservation is given a 2 hour window so that you are able to enjoy your experience. The lounge is located on the same floor as registration and it's in an open space outside of their bar. Considering it being in an open space, it's still really intimate and has a very tranquil vibe to it. The staff have always been amazing and accommodating each and every time I've been there. From assisting with tea selections and explaining the items on the display. They do your first pour of each tea which is a nice touch. 

The best way to enjoy high tea with your friends would be to each order a different tea and try each others. That way you're able to taste everything. As for the display, it doesn't seem like it would be enough food but it is actually quite filling. Especially with the amount of tea you consume with your display, you will be satiated. It's about $45-$50 per person for the Afternoon Tea which includes a pot of tea and the tiered display. If you would like champagne with your high tea, they do offer that option for a little bit more. For the overall experience, I'd say it's worth the price. I've paid it multiple times and I'm a broke college student. So I'm willing to go a week without groceries to have fancy tea then you know it's legit (haha). With all jokes aside, this place is worth every penny for any occasion. Enjoy!",0vcevXgdQ5qOZyBI9uyHNQ,3,4,5,Uu30xwgpPc4H_T3bcJasWg
4547670,2014-08-14,9,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"After a weekend of drinking, shooting guns, and occasionally hitting a strip club while trying to stave off heatstroke, we thought it would be a fitting contrast to take in the Mandarin Oriental's high tea. 

Put in a reservation for a Monday afternoon seating and were given the best table by the window. The view here is what differentiates them from other places one might have afternoon tea. It's all about getting a window seat here. 

Lee A. and I opted for the Classic English Afternoon Tea ($36 per person), while Brandon D. just got a pot of blooming peach tea ($16). Since Bran didn't participate in the tiered platter goodness, our server mentioned that to share with him would incur a fee. 

The Classic English gets each participating person a pot of their choice, a couple scones with clotted cream and spreads (pineapple instead of the usual lemon curd), a plate of small bite sandwiches, a hollowed-out egg shell with deviled yolk inside, and a few small pastries, some topped with gold leaf. The honey they brought came in a small jar, reading that it was from France. The food was all quite good. 

I got the Imperial Spring Dragonwell and Lee had Jasmine Earl Grey. He had his pot sent back for being over-steeped and said the second pot was also such. I found the Dragonwell extremely light, almost like simply drinking hot water. Our teas were served in clear pots, ""Teavana"" written on the bottoms. 

Since we worried there might be a dress code, we dressed up a bit. We were the first to arrive for the seating, and watched as others came in without reservations (not all that necessary on a Monday), they were donning their street clothes, several people with their luggage beside them as the check-in desk is right there after all. There's no dress code, and if there is it's not enforced, so don't concern yourself with throwing on a suit for a pot of Oolong.",-0IiMAZI2SsQ7VmyzJjokQ,12,10,3,pU_vnFcjbsZ49h4ZsodFug
4568064,2017-12-18,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Being a huge fan of afternoon teas, I was quite disappointed with my experience at the Tea Lounge.  The only thing saving this review is the service we had and the view. 

The afternoon tea was served in what seemed like their lobby. Just a few seats available and a holiday decor separating the room from the concierge.  What really surprised me was the price. If you look at their menu online it says that it should be only $40 per person. But during the holidays they offer the nutcracker tea set for a little more and some of the proceeds get donated to the nutcracker show. If you look at the previous price for this it says $45...not bad from the traditional tea price of $40. This year, it is $55! And it was not worth the money. Portions were very small considering what you had paid for. Thankfully they allowed us to share because if you got the afternoon tea by yourself you'd end up paying close to $70 depending how large your party was AND 18% gratuity is automatically included into your bill. 

All in all probably would not go back unless the price is a bit cheaper than $55. The only parking option they had is valet and that is $20 per car. So you have to make the walk from aria and pay about $7-12.  If you're looking for a bigger portion and cheaper afternoon tea, you can try Petrossian bar at the Bellagio though you won't get the view you do at the Mandarin.",-KJ49QVnNHPhzu8wVIS_lQ,0,0,3,4UhqASkzCVFfU3mS2JHYaw

Mandarin Bar was to my right, and Twist restaurant to my left...where is the lounge?  The hostess from Twist graciously walked us to the area next to the lobby check-in.  It is unmarked and just has couches and chairs.

The view is great - the expanse of City Center is to the left and forward and on the right is a view of Planet Hollywood and Paris.  My group of 6 sat down and got barraged by servers (there is not a shortage of employees here).  We received both cocktail and tea menus.  The cocktail menus were steep (but what do we expect from a high end place?) - from $18-$22 for signature cocktails, plus ""spoons"" from the bar for $6 each - a la tuna tartare, etc.

We opted for tea (post-Raku dinner schmoozing).  A pot is $12 and has about 3 cups worth.  I ordered matcha, and my friends ordered Mandarin Oriental's black mandarin tea, and other friends got white jasmine tea.  Mine came in an opaque pot, while theirs was served in a clear pot where you can see the tea strainer in the middle, atop a clear base with a tea candle underneath.  It came with sugar, cream, and small biscotti.

The waitstaff was very attentive, the tea hot, and the biscotti replenished.  The pastries were out for the day (coming from the 3rd floor patisserie that was closed), but they have a cupcake bento that I will try next time!  This is a nice place to go with friends to unwind.

Like I said, your on the 23rd floor so you have a great view of the Strip looking North and Northeast. I was there in the afternoon, but I would imagine a night view would be more appealing once the Strip is lit up.

For $95 (18% gratuity included) I received two pots of tea, scones, some finger foods, and some pastries. The tea was excellent. We ordered the the Jasmine Pearl and the Mandarin Orange Blossom. They serve honey on the table, but we requested agave syrup and the server brought it to the table. Our server Stephanie was very nice.

I would recommend calling and making a reservation. We weren't smart enough to do so, and had to wait around 30 minutes Sunday afternoon.

They had two options for afternoon tea with tasting: the classic ($38) and a special holiday edition ($45 with proceeds benefiting the Nevada Ballet Theater). Both include a pot of tea. We went with the classic: I had the Mandarin Orange blend (the house special) and the BF had the Monkey Picked Oolong. Both were really good. We are avid tea drinkers (especially of the Chinese variety) and really impressed by the quality of the tea. You can also request milk, sugar, and honey to go with it.

The food was very good too. The tea comes with 10 bite-sized snacks: 4 appetizers, 2 scones, and 4 desserts. My favorites were the curry chicken with Asian pear and the scones. The desserts were almost too cute to eat!

A couple I met the night before raved about the tea place here so I had to check it out. It was a lovely experience shared with good company so I enjoyed it.

You may think $36 cost a lot and that you deserve more than 3 tiny plates of food, but trust me, it's plenty of food.  They are also generous on the tea; it's free re-fill.  I had the jasmine pearl, and that was good.  My mom had the matcha latte, and I LOVED it.  She liked mine more, so it was the perfect switch! 

We weren't seated by the window, but that was ok.  Maybe I will request to be seated by the window next time if I feel like it.

This place definitely fulfilled the desire....wasn't up to par with the English ones, but then again we're not in England.  Not sure how many ppl are willing to drop a couple hundred bucks for a snack that's in between lunch and dinner, but it is quite an experience.  Something about sitting in a lounge with a beautiful view, drinking tea, and snacking on scones, desserts, and sandwiches that are nicely presented on a 3 tier plate display just screams ""living the good life"".",omvZKSBvL1Wnf_hDIutRsQ,0,0,5,m905_YgzoX-s17ETaSh6EA
4880244,2014-07-29,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"There are worse ways to spend an afternoon in Vegas than tea at the Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge. I mean, who doesn't love eating fancy little sandwiches and treats off a tiered tray? 

The Lounge is on the top floor of the Mandarin Oriental. The view is great from up there but if you don't get one of the prime tables by the window, you're basically sitting in the lobby. It's somewhat partitioned off from check-in, but still. Request one of the window tables when you make your reservation. 

As for the food, I liked the scones with clotted cream and jam but the sandwiches were pretty average. We had deviled egg salad, curry chicken salad, smoked salmon and cucumber, and ham. Just ham. Okay, ""Black Forest ham"" but still. I want something better than ham and mayo on wheat when I'm shelling out $36! I can make ham sandwiches at home.

The desserts were better than the sandwiches, featuring macarons, brownies, truffles, cookies, and little one-bite cakes. 

As for the tea itself, the lychee green tea was excellent but they took away my pot by accident before I was done so then I had to wait for them to brew me a new pot (on the plus side I got an extra pot of tea!). The boyfriend really liked his darjeeling tea.

I was worried we'd be hungry afterwards but between all the little snackums and the teas, we were definitely sated. Skip the champagne add-on and just stick with tea.

Overall the food could have been better but we had a lovely time. It's more about the experience anyway.

Tip: The tables feature intricate metal circle patterns so don't lean your leg against it for the entire tea like I did :X",oXWBXVyT-5QurIE6QsG_cw,0,1,4,qdTp1OBLnf1LPJUoXIoSAA

This is an upscale spot, with a live jazz band that wasn't so loud you couldn't hold a conversation (we were seated at the bar).  The bartender was friendly, and made my buddy one happy camper with the suggestion of visiting Top Shelf to purchase the rum he was looking for.

This is a spot to take a date for an intimate conversation, where the drinks are priced to keep the riff-raff out.

I've actually been here for High Tea too, which was enjoyable.  My biggest complaint is that they are going for a tranquil atmosphere, but what barely constitutes a wall-divider separates the lounge from the front desk... so a lot of foot traffic is a bit distracting.

It looks right down on the strip with great views of Planet Hollywood, Aria, Paris Las Vegas, and beyond. We felt lucky to have just happened upon the MO Tea Lounge, and we soaked up our evening there, and even came back for another. 

We ordered several drinks - but enjoyed both the Golden Leaf and the Royal Tea the best. The Golden Leaf is a mandarin flavored drink that had a nice citrus balance with the alcohol. The Royal Tea was smoked tea with alcohol and lemon - the citrus was a little more biting in this drink, but very refreshing. 

Our waitress was very prompt, and we were offered a dish of wasabi peanuts, a salty snack mix, and sweet peanuts which were nice to have. We didn't feel rushed, and the seats were very comfortable, deep, and nicely padded.

It does book during the day for their afternoon tea, to make sure to make a reservation! If you stop in and they're fully booked, you can always go down to the MOzen Bistro. They also have a nice view, decent sushi and a lovely atmosphere.",amU2dHcyKLsbjKj3mGyaBQ,4,3,5,xG4cqxz9L7OYNvHoBBzaTw

I didn't notice til later that the pots are Teavana, but I thought in my head that a few sounds like some I have had from there. They probably are special blends for Mandarin since looking the names up popped up empty. The pu-erh is decent, but it's an earth based tea that isn't for everyone. The service was friendly and unobtrusive in passing by to pour tea.

I try French macarons at every venue possible and excited to find that they are served here. Ggreen tea macaron ,I must! Though it was a well made macaron (a sad rarity of LV), I don't think it's worth going up there to get $2 smallish ones when the craving hits. If I'm here for tea, yes, but I rather take home palm sized Bouchon ones. Still, I'm happy to find one other place with decent macarons. 

 This isn't perfect a venue, but I get that this isn't a tea town. Stowing it into a lobbys excess space makes sense though it could use a little bit more partition. The decor felt upscale enough, but could use a bit more comfort in the padding. 

Tea is meant for relaxation, but it definitely was a bit library so don't come here to do private talk since you'll probably be heard. After a night of partying, a busy relay at the buffets or just tired feet needing a break somewhere, this is a good place to take in a view and sip peace of mind.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,6,4,5oJH1ORKJe1WUFhAge-CMg

They may look tiny at first, but trust me...it's filling! The scones are worth the carbs and pairs so well with the jams and marmalades. For the tea sandwiches, the egg salad and smoked salmon are always winners in my book. Wished they offered cucumber tea sandwiches! The desserts are perfect, none too sweet, with good variety. The dessert plates vary from visit to visit. Service was perfect and the waiters are usually good photo takers too...ha! Parking, I recommend just doing valet. If you're staying at Aria, you can just walk over. 
My only complaint (my friends felt the same way too) is the seating! It's so cushy and that your body kind of just ""sinks in"" and becomes uncomfortable. The little square seats are too short. Sitting on them with heels, my knees were chest height. The tables, although gorgeous, do not allow our legs to tuck in or extend because of the design. The big couches were too deep.

The whole point of sitting in the TEA lounge is to have a nice city view and enjoy the intimate setting of the tea room. The other lounge she tried to seat us in overlooked the ugly Polo Towers Hotel, the street, and parking lots. Also, we would be the only group seated in this area...great way to be forgotten!

This was unacceptable, so I complained, and a seating area in the TEA lounge magically became available. NEVER accept to be seated in the other lounge; it's ugly with tired looking furniture and a horrible view.

There only two tables next to the window and the rest are stationed in a "" U"" shape.  So every table can see the view but it might not be so clear. 

The waitress was nice and explained everything to us.  She took really good care of us and answered all our questions. When the food came out she explained everything in detailed.  The food looked super cute and was themed to the season.  The first thing i had was the curry in a cone.  I enjoyed eating this a lot.   The Cream sandwich was good too along with the salmon with cucumber sandwich.  The scones is what i should've ate first, because it's best warm. I liked it the white cream sauce more, but they had two others for you to choose from. There was a strawberry jam and a apricot jam too.   I like the plain scone more compared to the berry one. 

The desserts were super cute and cute was just what it was. I felt it was too sweet.  All the desserts where too sweet.  The snowman macaron was prob. the least sweet but only if you avoid the hat.  I felt like i was eating sugar straight from the box.  It was a complete sugar overload that I have crossed off sweets from my diet for a whole month.

I know this is not likely, so I had to settle for a jazz combo on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental.

We didn't go for high tea. We simply went to enjoy pots of tea, which are $12. The tea selection is not huge or particularly rare and impressive. The pots were marked with Teavana logos, which made me wonder if the lounge is a partnership with them. Regardless, I was still happy, and my tea was delicious and soothing. Plus, the hostess was top notch, and she brought over a piece of scrumptious cheesecake for my birthday.

I will say I was a little disappointed by the venue. We actually ended up sitting in the bar because all of the window tables were taken in the lounge. However, we walked past the lounge, and it was not what I had envisioned. It is essentially a lobby area on the 23rd floor with some low tables, couches and chairs.

My wonderful boyfriend and I walked into this asian esque' hotel. We has a reservation for two. We were  quickly seated, me on a couch and him on a comfy coushioned lounge chair. This places decor was emaculate, chandaliers, floor to ceiling windows with as amazing view looking down on vegas. This high tea experience was next to the reception desk. At the entrance a fashionable gal next to an asian screen. This experience was first awkward given the seating, I didn't know these type of things existed!  My boyfriend ordered me the peace through water tea, a calming loose leaf herbal tea, freshly brewed. It was amazing, both delicious, and invigorating. Made with a combination of chamomile, lavender, and lemon balm to "" help reinforce your inner calm, "" lol as stated on the menu.

He opted for the classic english afternoon tea option $36 /person. It came with small smoked salmon and cucumber sandwhiches with a watercress spread. Creamy deviled eggs in the shell, goat cheese tarlets with apricots, dried fruits and a spice bread crisp, black forest ham sandwhiches, and their signature scones with imported davinshire cream and chef phillipe's house made marmalades and jams. 
The trio of plates also came with the chefs selection of pastries. Ours consisted of two chocolate lollipops with a honey flavored filling, perfect fruit tarts with the sweetest fruit toppings, a chocolate dessert, and a coffee flavored pastry topped with a coffee bean. 

Everything was presented on a teired display rack. The trio of plates was the most amazing assortment of bites. The skill level and flavor profiles are mind boggling. I came in thinking I was eating small simple sandwhiches, but left blown away craving these small dishes on a day to day basis. This first experience to High tea definitley set the standards high. I have yet to come across another place that creates and executed this perfection. This place is must go if ever your looking to grab a small bite between dinner plans when coming to vegas. The french know exactly what they're doing, trust me on this one you will not leave dissapointed. 5 stars from me!",CVP0UGBZx2UBBayUtyelnw,5,1,5,o_B6phvB0s0KRCNVISLCYQ

5357447,2015-09-24,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"I visited the Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge during my trip to Las Vegas back in July. I've always, always wanted to do afternoon tea. Living in NYC there are a lot of options for afternoon teas of all price ranges but for some reason the first time I do afternoon tea it's in the middle of the desert. Luckily, this was a wonderful experience and well worth the expense. 

The lounge was beautiful with sweeping views of the Las Vegas strip. Our party had reservations and we were sat immediately.

We did have one member with a very serious food allergy. I completely forgot about this prior to making the reservation. (I know, I know I'm a terrible person). When we told our server she handled it in the most professional manner. She went over the menu with the guest and spoke to the chef who was able to give us extra of the food items that the guest would be okay to eat. All of this was handled expertly and without any issue. 

The food was delicious and beautifully presented. It really was a feast for the eyes as well as the mouth. 

Afternoon tea isn't really meant to be a full meal but a respite before dinner. Even so I was stuffed by the time we were done. All the bites and all tea left me wanting to take a nap in my chair.  

The whole thing was over too soon. I could have spent many hours sipping warm tea and relaxing far removed from the noise and crowds. 

This wasn't a cheap meal but it was 100% worth it and, this probably makes me an old lady now, but one of the highlights of my trip.",KKzZhjpBtnHIECqTVaowDw,1,0,4,bKlJZbdTDmO5lZYVomvSCw

I did get a glimpse of the tea area itself and I thought maybe if I wasn't in a private area I wouldn't do the tea.  It was basically a nice couch and table area off to the side of check-in so there really isn't much privacy or ""high tea"" experience.

The hotel itself is not that easy to find.  My group had a hard time finding the entrance, so take a cab if you opt to go.

It has great views and is nice and quiet.  A good option if you're looking to recover from a long night out.",9Axvn1u7-Hds0U1ulohLMQ,3,1,5,46MvwLin-58YW_K0jpYBOg
5397621,2017-05-18,4,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"If you're looking for a view while lifting your pinky up to some yummy afternoon tea, this place is it. Tea Lounge is located inside the Mandarin Oriental hotel, and once you go up the elevator, the ""lounge"" is literally situated in a corner next to the hotel registration desk. There's no fancy restaurant or cafe, but rather, tiny little tables with seats or sofas and that's it.

To make it worth your $40/person + an automatic 18% gratuity (service charge) for afternoon tea, I highly recommend putting in a reservation and requesting for a window seat. For the afternoon tea set, you get to pick a pot of tea and it comes with a plate of scones/sandwiches/desserts. If you're not too hungry and are willing to share a single bite of food with another person, you can share the tea set and not do it individually (just keep in mind the portions are tiny)

Food Thoughts
---Like the many reviews, the scones here are DELICIOUS. I can just eat these all day 
---Also, like the many warnings, the desserts here are whack. Some were far too sweet and while it looked pretty, it definitely did not taste good
----Savory sandwiches = surprisingly filling and tasty. Definitely would eat this plate of food again

Suggestion: If you don't mind skipping sweets, I suggest ordering a pot of tea + scones or sandwiches a la carte. A little cheaper but more worthwhile to eat without having to feel bad on skipping your dessert. 

Service: Average service but most of the staff were friendly

Dress attire: While there is no formal dress code, I would recommend dressing nicer than usual (vast majorities of the ladies who were here had dresses)

View: The strip view was pretttttty. If you're taking your mom/someone out, this is quite the treat, especially if they don't go to Vegas often.

No place I've gone to has knocked it out of the ballpark on each of these: tea, sandwiches, scones, dessert, ambiance, and service.  All the tea places I've gone to are really good in a few or most of these areas and just ""meh"" on the others; the Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge is no exception.  The sandwiches just weren't appetizing to me, and me being more into the food than the tea (I march to the beat of my own drummer lol), I found that to be very disappointing.  However, there were some pretty good things about this place.

First of all, tea is tea to me, and theirs was just fine.  I've yet to come across tea that I've wanted to spit out lol.  (I usually stick with green teas/light fruity teas.)  I've already mentioned how I wasn't crazy at all about their sandwiches.  Their scones, though, were pretty good, and while I usually find desserts at afternoon tea to be pretty bad, theirs were a-ok.  What makes this place great is the ambiance.  Relaxing and quiet with an amazing view of the Strip.  My sister and I were able to get a table for two right by the window :)  Service was good, too.  And guys, you won't feel out of place here.  You usually think ""girly outing"" when you think afternoon tea, but quite a few couples were having afternoon dates over tea on our visit.  

If only we could combine the sandwiches from the Petrossian Bar at Bellagio with everything else here!  I would not hesitate to come back!

Also, it was my girlfriend's birthday on our visit.

Although a little pricey at $40 per person, really good. I got an additional iced tea, the orange blossom black tea, just amazing flavor. With that $40 you get the chef's special which include a sampling of finger sandwiches, scones, and desserts. We tried it all and enjoyed it all. I have no idea what my favorites were because it was all delicious.

Let's get it crackin' with ambiance. So the MO is very high end. Don't be fooled by the pashminas and the Summerlin moms - the service was great. Very worth the $40 price for the afternoon tea, and the snazzy finger sandwiches and pastries. We called ahead and requested be seated by the window (if possible) and MO was very accommodating and the view was magnifique!

Secondly, let's get to bizness with the food! I would say the food was the best part, but honestly the drinks also were spectacular. So my colleague and I loved pretty much everything that was presented to us. The forerunners were the apricot biscuit, the ham and cheese finger sandwiches, and whatever this yellow white chocolate raspberry ball of goodness was that was presented to us. I would say at least every delightful little snack was a B+ in our book - a few did not fit our preferences, but hey... you win some and you lose some. Even the French honey and the whipped butter tickled my taste buds.

Last but certainly not least, the dranks. My colleague and I also splurged on some libations. She got the Tea-tini which was was aromatically pleasing and in her own words, ""zesty."" I got the rooster drink because I am the year of the rooster. It was a cocktail made with Aviation gin, lychee popping bubbles, and whole lot of tasty. Now - the tea! My colleague got the peach tea and the pot came with this delightful blooming flower. Afternoon tea and a show! I went with the jasmine white tea which was absolutely delicate, feminine, splendid, and pleasing to the tongue.

The good
Great view, very sophisticated un-Vegas like environment.  Great hostess.

The bad
Several of the guests received their tea lukewarm, had to be sent back.  Service seemed disorganized.  Possibly because of the large party.

The ugly
We've been to several Mandarin Oriental Hotels.  Unfortunately, the Tea Lounge at the Las Vegas location does not meet the high standard we've come to expect from a Mandarin Oriental Hotel.",0INsbCvpanvJOho324dW0A,0,0,2,5c8fvlqokezaxxDDDmIDYA
5449756,2018-03-07,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"The Tea Lounge is a really cute idea at the Mandarin Oriental.  It was a little confusing to get to as there is no signage - you just have to know to get there by elevator.  

Reservations are a necessity and I would just tram it or uber - but I hear there is free valet if you spend $50 - which you most likely will for a party of 2.  

The team room is very pretty and well decorated.  It is smaller so that is why you need reservations.  My husband and I ordered separate teas but both got the traditional afternoon tea which is $45 a person.  We liked the assortment of tea sandwiches which were dainty and well presented, but I found some of their desserts - while pretty - a little bland and even dry in taste.  However, I was there mostly for the scones and clotted cream - just like in England. All items are dainty and small so don't come thinking you're going to get full based on the names - the names for the sandwiches are an earful... but not even a mouthful... does that make sense?   

Anyway, I digress.  It's a worthwhile experience and I enjoyed.  Outside of the dry desserts/petit fours, the reason I gave this place a 4 is that for the calibre of establishment, you would think they would clean better. I swear that the lights above were filled with debris or something.  It was a little unsettling for me.

The lychee green tea and the regular green tea were very fragrant.  They provided us with a giant pot of tea. If you finish the pot and want more, it is an additional cost.   The selection and amount of food was sufficient.  The food was good, but not mind blowing.  It is hard for me to judge because I have had tea in London, and I naturally wanted to compare the experience.  

The scones with a smear of strawberry jam were hot, fresh, and delicious. The bread in the sandwiches were a bit dry.  The desserts were good, but some a little too rich for me. (Matter of preference.) The most memorable item was the goat cheese tart.  I don't like goat cheese.  The idea of goat cheese makes me frown.  I was already frowning when I opened my mouth to devour the tart. Surprisingly that frown turned into a socked smile. The tart filling complimented the goat cheese well.  Goat cheese can be good!

She generously treated our group of girlfriends for Christmas and what a wonderful gift the time we spent there was.  I've never been to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel before, so, after dropping my car with valet, I took the elevator to the 23rd floor and found the hotel registration area with the tea lounge adjacent to it.   Suzy had made reservations for us and we were lucky to be moved to a sitting area right next to the windows overlooking the Strip after first being seated further away.  Appropriately, our tea staff person was named Jingle and she took great care of us for the 2+ hours we were there.  We each chose the Classic English Afternoon Tea ($38 per person), which included a choice of one of their loose leaf teas in your own pot plus a selection of finger foods and pastries including scones, cucumber sandwiches, and a chicken curry ""cone.""  The staff inquired about any food allergies or restrictions when Suzy made the reservation.  Those restrictions were accommodated and adjustments made for the one vegetarian friend in the group and the one person who's allergic to fish (me.)  Consequently, I got an extra serving of the chicken curry instead of getting the smoked salmon and cucumber with watercress spread.  I am a fan of the chicken curry and loved the scones, too.  We each chose a different tea so we got to have at least one cup of four different types.  The Mandarin Orange Blend was my choice, plus we shared the Monkey Picked Oolong, the Matcha green, and the Organic Lychee green.  Being able to try four different types was very nice and we had more than enough to go around, with Jingle checking on us often to refresh the pots so we always had hot tea.  
As our reservation was at 2:30pm, we were able to see day turn into dusk and the view from where we sat was terrific, overlooking the Strip and seeing the lights; that never gets old for me even though I've been a resident for 20+ years.

In terms of crumpets, I've definitely had and seen better presentation and pickings. Not that MO's was not good and pretty, but I really think they should kick it up a few notches.

In terms of tea, the selection isn't too bad. It has a little of everything to soothe everyone's taste buds, but presentation is very basic. I've had tea over at Petrossian at Bellagio and they give you the fancy DIY tea sets. A little fancier, but hey, it's hitea after all. 

In terms of service, they are very solid. No buts there.

I won't go into too many details, since there are plenty of other reviews to read, but here's the basics:

Pros:
- Located on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental - with a great view of the Strip!
- MO is a 5 Star hotel, so the service is spectacular
- Large selection of different teas, along with champagne and food
- Everything is beautifully presented

Cons:
- The space is just too small - there were 8 of us in our party (we had reservations), but they only had place settings for 7 people. They were able to pull up an extra chair, but it was a bit cramped
- Everyone ordered tea service, so the table became cluttered/full quickly with the tea pots for all of us
- This may not be a con for everyone, but MO only offers valet parking (which is complimentary). Also, if you are not familiar with MO, the entrance off LVB is a bit hidden. If you don't want to Valet, you can park in ARIA self parking and it's just a short walk away

Overall, it was a great time. All of the food was magnificent and the tea was amazing (I had the orange blossoms). They even welcomed us with a glass of champagne, since we were celebrating a special occasion. The Chef came out and talked to us and we really felt special. This is really a great treat, but not something I would do often (the tea service is $45 per person). I would totally suggest this if you are looking for a relaxed day with your girlfriends and want to do something different. Plus, there is a great view and the hotel itself is beautiful. 

If you haven't experienced tea service like this, GO!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,11,5,4,R8sQ53D99wsK6L53R7jExg
5676946,2017-07-08,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Food: I was a frequent afternoon tea go-er when I lived in the Bay Area, so was eager to find a quality afternoon tea location to take my visiting mom for a belated Mother's Day tea.  We had the Traditional Afternoon Tea with Golden Assam ($40/pp). I loved all the little sandwiches and sweets, more than I expected, since I'm used to the traditional presentation. But these were VERY tasty and satisfied the expected flavors, such as egg salad, ham, and scones and sweets along with surprising favorites like the curry chicken cone with asian pear (divine!) and the citrus dessert (yellow one). 

The big fail was the sweet item that was chocolate/blackberry cake, which I expected to like, but it just tasted terrible. They really need to fix this one! But everything else was FANTASTIC!! I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors and presentation and it exceeded my expectations, especially after reading other reviews. 

The Golden Assam tea was the perfect accompaniment as it was English Breakfast tea-like and what I'm used to. It was hard to pick amongst all their teas and ice tea selections! I took the local honey home to use on toast and it was SO DELICIOUS. I need to buy some local honey!

Ambiance: Beautiful area set off the lobby, with floor to ceiling windows/views and lovely couches and tables. We got there right when it opened (first seating) and lucked out by getting the best location front and center in front of the window.

Service: Superior as one would expect from Mandarin Oriental. Our polished server was top notch and professional. She explained the tea service, tea offerings, items when they arrived, and checked in frequently but not too frequently. 

Price: At $40/pp this is more than reasonable and practically a steal compared to the Garden Court at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco ($68/pp), which is my standard and stick to compare against.

Location: In the beautiful Mandarin Oriental Hotel.

Tip: Initially when I was researching afternoon tea places, I could not decide between here and Petrossian Bar. Thinking that Petrossian was more traditional, we went there first, but I was disappointed in the low quality service (we were an afterthought) and environment (view of the casino). If you are trying to decide between the two, Mandarin Oriental is WAY more superior in EVERY WAY. I will be returning!!",V6Cjj3SVmMqCrr6uJqvlPw,4,0,5,Q1kyNOjoCqU9LNKwJ0b91Q
5685027,2014-07-19,3,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Compared to Clipper Lounge in MO Hong Kong and Mo Bar in Landmark MO Hong Kong, Tea Lounge in MO Las Vegas had room in improvement. Why did I give Tea Lounge three stars? 
1) The view was spectacular - My friend and I were able to see Aria and Cosmopolitan from the lounge.
2) The service was good for Vegas standard  - Since I am allergic to melons, I requested to only have berries in my fruit platter. The waiter quickly fulfilled my request.
3) The food was decent - Both my apple juice and my fruit platter were fresh.

What could Tea Lounge do to get my other two stars?
1) Easy access to reservation - Since I was not able to make a reservation via Opentable, I called MO and was transferred four times before I was able to make my reservation. 
2) Increase the quality of the service - The waiter forgot my request for hot water. I had to remind her for it. It also took her a long time to stop by our table for the check. 
3) Improve the quality of the food - My matcha latte with soy milk barely had any green tea flavor. At the same time, my friend's Danish was relatively bland. The pastries do not seem to be on par with those in MO HK and Landmark MO HK. 

Despite of these minor flaws, Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge is my favorite place for high tea in Vegas due to its tranquil atmosphere. I hope that the quality of the food and the service would meet the five star standard during my next visit.",lXG7Mbhi6_nXaTZojpneUg,7,6,3,F0saGOsS6FclySs0Iya59A

My friend made reservations for two for seats by the window and the view was beautiful overlooking the strip. I must say, it is hard to find if you're not sure where you're looking for and on apple/google map, I thought it was next to pink berry and was looking for signs, but you actually take the elevator to the Sky Lounge from the Mandarin hotel lobby. 

The decor and set up was very beautiful. We both opted for the Traditional Afternoon tea which comes preselected and you just chose your pot of tea. I chose the matcha which you can select to come with or without milk (like a latte!) and sweeten it to your desire. It was delicious. 

You get a wide range of pastries and finger sandwiches as well as dessert, if you'll have room for it by the end! My favorite was the curried chicken they had in the cute little cones, and secondly, the smoked salmon was delightful as well. 

They do add a mandatory gratitude to your ticket regardless the number of people in your group. It's a lovely experience and would recommend anyone to try at least once.",SDgrUDEdWNFBlC4ufVk1PQ,4,0,5,5KTPLswbV-Z-DeF04G-mlQ

5725474,2016-08-30,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"Yum, I really enjoyed my afternoon tea here at the Mandarin Oriental. I haven't had many afternoon teas before, so take my recommendation with a grain of salt, but this was definitely one of my favorites! The $38 set comes with your choice of tea, 2 scones (buttermilk and blueberry) that came with peach jam, blackberry jam, devonshire cream which are all made in house, 4 savory (chicken salad, crab, smoked salmon, and ham), and 4 sweets (I ended up packing these to go for my parents because I was full but they said they were really good). The savory options at MO were much better than your typical crustless, slightly stale mini sandwiches with very little filling, and the scones were delicious! Served warm, they were flaky and the jams and cream were delicious and not too sweet.

Service was also warm and personable. Our waitress brought out a complimentary glass of champagne for my friend who was celebrating her bachelorette!

I took off 1 star because the Tea Lounge shares a space with the check-in lobby so you can hear and watch people checking in/out while you're having a tea, so it slightly takes away from the peaceful ambiance you want at an afternoon tea. The space itself is also pretty small - I'd estimate it fits a 30-40 ppl capacity at most.",Os7XnHJYLsHFhOsiMLQ6mA,4,1,4,6EPFGROl9UZMOJJjl2u91A

Totally swanky tea lounge on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel. Very quiet, relaxing and peaceful environment (keep in mind I went on a Monday afternoon though. I am sure it's busier on the weekends!)

We got the English Tea set and I ordered the Green tea w/ lychee flavors. The tea was quite good but it got lukewarm after a few minutes which is my pet peeve - I love my teas pipin' hot! The finger foods were very high quality but most of the items contained items I am not a huge fan of (e.g. smoked salmon, curry chicken, etc). I actually was hoping for more simple cucumber/ham sandwiches since they go so well with the tea and are easy to eat!

The dessert was a total miss for me. Way too sugary and sweet for my palate and I barely touched them. I would prefer more finger sandwiches in place of the sweets! Overall, service was great too and the server was very attentive.",vhDL0RHifIgEdWytB1yrSg,1,0,4,-cVb7CK0af_HB5E-VtbNmg

5804986,2015-11-12,0,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"This place is pretty much what I imagine little girls are picturing when they do imaginary tea parties (admittedly not me, I was more dinosaurs and lemonade stands for some reason), so that should help with the visuals. Everything is adorably presented and daintily tiny, except the pots of tea, which are bigger than the one I have at home. It's very lovely, and feels a bit like a homey lounge with the comfy couches etc.

I really enjoyed the butter scones, which were fantastic and warm when brought to the table. I wasn't a fan of the clotted cream (I'd never had that before), but the apricot jam and raspberry jam they brought to the table were both great with the scones, as well as the honey. I also enjoyed the fresh passionfruit on the fruit platter they brought out when they initially realized they had tried to substitute out one dessert I was allergic to with yet another dessert with the same allergen, and also the dragonfruit tapioca pudding they gave me as well (for the same reason). The tea was also of good quality, and the morsels which I was able to eat were definitely delicious.

The rating I'm giving reflects the handling of food allergies here, as that could have been a really bad thing for me if it had been a more serious allergy. I have an egg allergy which gives me stomach aches (so not life threatening so much as just painful), and am also a vegetarian. When my group made the reservation, my friend very specifically told them about this and asked if they would be able to accommodate me, and they said they'd have no problem with it. If you have a food allergy of any kind, know your stuff before coming here, although even that didn't save me in the end. It was easy enough for them to accommodate the vegetarian request, as they just substitute out things that have meat in them for other menu items which are safe. They tried to substitute some of the eggy dessert items with a couple of macarons, which are primarily made of egg whites, and I pointed that out immediately when the hostess brought out our desserts and pointed out which ones were intended to be ""safe"" for me. She looked pretty surprised, and thought maybe they made an eggless version so she went to check and discovered that I was correct, and the chef had made a mistake. The pastries and sweets, it turns out, appear to be brought in from outside sources rather than made in house, and the chef downstairs apparently was not aware of what went into them, either from general knowledge or from any ingredients list (which may or may not be provided, I guess, when ordering your sweets from elsewhere). They brought a fruit plate fairly immediately and then asked a chef to make me something from scratch, so once they knew about the mistake, they handled it well. (They came down with a vanilla tapioca pudding with dragonfruit and I think a guava compote or jelly, and it was quite nice. I hadn't had tapioca pudding before, oddly enough.) The hostess was also very polite about the whole thing, and apologized on the chef's behalf. However, I really should have been more suspicious of the other items that they had claimed were safe for me to eat, because even after all of that I still ended up with a stomachache later :/ So in case of food allergies, please be warned: the chef in charge down there doesn't seem to take it particularly seriously.

Another thing when we made our reservation was that we were told we would get a spot with a good view, which I guess we thought meant we'd get a spot by the windows. The entire time we were there, one of the two spots by the windows was open with a little ""reserved"" spot sign, and we weren't the only ones seated away from the window either. Ultimately not that big of a deal, but it was a little confusing--maybe the folks who reserved that spot were a couple of hours late or something. Also, we were told they don't really do the Gong Fu Cha service anymore, which... Well, we just really wanted to know what it entailed, and I guess they do that so infrequently that the hostess wasn't able to describe it to us.

Anyhow, I realize that was a very mixed review, but in summary it's a cute little place, with really cute little foods and reasonably good quality teas, but it is pricey and if you have food allergies and the like, be careful. I like the concept a lot, and the location is lovely, but I couldn't see myself going back after my personal experience.",tUsrdWOWjOGf_hTsjMKycA,0,0,3,l_In2WDYMYEhwgKq5bqeJw

5879476,2013-01-12,3,vYOtdnBm-45KQiiHj8jqaw,"During my recent trip to Vegas over the Christmas holiday, my best friend and I decided to visit the Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge for a relaxing late afternoon away from the fanny packs and liquor slushies. 

I'll start with the good...
The hotel itself is very chic as is the Tea Lounge. Beautiful Asian decor with a view of the strip you could find on a postcard in a hotel gift shop. A clean and upscale environment but without a pretentious air that frequent accompanies ""high tea"".  The hostesses were elegantly dressed and had us seated almost instantly.

In terms of food, I was impressed with the spread. The scones were delicious especially when accompanied by strawberry rhubarb compote and clotted cream. The selection of tea was lovely. My favorite being the matcha. 

Now, the bad...
The sandwich selection they offer includes a curried chicken salad, which contains nuts. However, nowhere on the menu did it specify the use of nuts in any of the offerings. The waitress also gave an extremely detailed run down of the types of sandwiches, scone toppings, and desserts yet failed to mention nuts being in any of the food aside from a pistachio cake. For the record, I am deathly allergic to peanuts and cashews to the point that I carry around multiple Epi pens in my purse everywhere I go. 

When I bit into the sandwich, I started to feel sick and I took a closer look, only to see a small piece of nut that I couldn't identify off the bat. When I flagged down a waitress to ask about what kind of nuts were in the items, she panicked and left to ask the chef. When she returned, she kept firmly insisting that I was fine because it was ""just walnuts"" but ANYONE who knows ANYTHING about nuts knows that almost all tree nuts are processed in the same facilities. When I tried to ask about nuts being in any of the other desserts, she acted annoyed to be bothered by me again. 

I was appalled by how it was handled and I felt ill for the remainder of the day because of that ONE bite of sandwich. I was almost offended to see that they automatically included 18% gratuity to the bill because I would have left $0 if given the opportunity.

I admit it was irresponsible on my part not to ask but the waitress had given such a precise account of ingredients used in other items (ie: eggnog truffles, bubblegum flavored French macarons, black forest ham sandwiches etc.) that I thought I was in the clear. I suppose it was my error to expect such a highly regarded establishment would care about their customer's dietary restrictions. 

I REALLY REALLY REALLY don't enjoy writing bad reviews (as you can tell from my profile) but it's necessary in this case to warn other people with severe nut allergies! I'm lucky that all I left with was a bad stomach ache. I really hope in the future the Mandarin Tea Lounge is more consequent of their patrons' needs.",lktvZdRSa1zqxYcaL0-Dsw,14,0,1,EbKEvMXyJ8IQsmU4iwmgmA

Our servers were very accommodating and nice to offer to take pictures of us, and not just taking a picture, but making sure if the picture they took was good enough and if the lighting was just right. Who does that nowadays???
