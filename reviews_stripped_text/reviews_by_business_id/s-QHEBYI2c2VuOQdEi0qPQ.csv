Also ordered a Chipotle Ranch Chicken and a Chili Cheese Griller because it only a dollar during happy hour which is 2 to 5 pm everyday. Again, not impressed even though it is only a dollar each.

First off, the XXL Steak Nachos had hardly any steak on it. 3 times the steak? More like 3 little strips cut up into really tiny pieces. It wasn't even warm and it didn't even taste like steak.  From the commercial they make it look bigger than it seems and even the poster that is on their wall shows you a lot more ingredients. 

The Grillers? Flavorless and bland. I don't even wanna go into details cuz it would be a waste of time for me and you.

As for service, who the heck trains these people? Was just showing up to work more than enough to be construed as hard working? After we ordered, it took about 10 minutes before we got our food and there was only one other customer ahead of us that has already ordered.

On their door where you enter, they have a sticker that says free wifi. I tried scanning for their free signal but my phone couldn't connect to it. Maybe my phone knew better than waste its battery power trying to connect to a non existent router. 

In closing, this just might be the last time that I ever step foot in a TB. I try not to recommend other places out of respect but I didn't get any from your establishment so you are not getting any from me. That same night, I took my kids to Del Taco to make up for the bad experience.

I haven't received bad service, bad food or an incorrect order yet. At this location I get  exactly what I expect from a Taco Bell restaurant.",E9yRSEtayhAKwnje3B4lDA,0,0,4,hHEXRLP11eXGg0xbsBG_9g
3481299,2016-10-27,0,s-QHEBYI2c2VuOQdEi0qPQ,"The drive thru is fine. As for walk in FORGET IT . 3 chances and they screwed up big time. First time we forgave and forgot whatever petty thing happened. Second time, order was wrong . Ordered some stuff and a side of NACHO CHEESE. Put a side of steak and charged is for that instead . Had to return this flimsy pile of meat for our money and then had to repurchase the cheese. During this process the other guy is putting stuff in and out of our bag. Like a big black nacho cheese cup and takes it out to replace it with the plastic little one. Practically cheated us during the process. We lost money and poor communication among everyone.  This time girlfriend and I walked in. She orders first got her stuff while I was deciding. Next dude goes. I'm behind him and the order lady walks away as I go up. I stand there for five minutes and everyone in the store has their food and I'm waiting to order mind. Entire kitchen staff staring at me. I sit down with my girlfriend just waiting . Meanwhile some managers were chit chatting to our right in clear view of the issue. Girlfriend goes back up to hordes for me and got attention of a kitchen member. I myself refused to order because I was ignored. I vow not to eat Taco Bell. Taco Bell customer service will here my wrath tomorrow morning. BEWARE OF POOR SERVICE AND INCONSISTENT QUALITY",ItmqzvxHDMh8dfCGPjNU6w,0,0,1,ImwfsjYow9ZcsyhBuj1NUQ

I love it and they handle problem people perfectly. See it first hand. And even when they leave I don't see them talking bad about them I think is amazing how professional they are most people when you leave talk about you I've seen that. 

Great job everyone",6_AugSHouBMud2ngS-RoqQ,0,0,5,kEeul05ZyGPYbREOT0Ltng

Vicki & Brittney are great employees, super polite and my son gives them extra points for making the burritos really good so good he wants one every night. Again thank you ladies for your superb customer service.",VNbQELcvi0HBYeeP2HRn-w,0,0,5,PIu8b4PtITi0m1StkowG-w

We ordered simple crunchy taco supremes to go. The clerk at the drive through was really animated and friendly. He really made us feel welcome. We received our food quickly. Once we got home, we enjoyed some of the best tacos from Taco Bell that we have had in a long time. They did not skimp on any of the meat or toppings. This experience really made our day.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,4,6,4,rtEzlqU18ve5KIr6ZZw7og

It really truly is a hot or miss at this location...I guess it depends on who works late here. For example: Sometimes I'll get the person who doesn't sound like they want to work there but they always get my order right...and other days I'll get the person with an amazing personality but can never seem to get a #6 right to save their life. So yes hit or miss

Don't get me wrong it's not like I'm gonna quit going there...whenever I'm in the mood for something quick fast and in a hurry Taco Bell is always my go to spot...but it's only because I love the Fire taco sauce...

The sauce packages really make me happy",_73GdBatHqhhQ7fA83WkGQ,1,1,3,ZX96fSNtNzvHX0nH8JxJsw
5580623,2013-10-26,0,s-QHEBYI2c2VuOQdEi0qPQ,"Well, it started off well... As I was walking up to the door, an employee about to go on break stopped and held the door open for me. That was nice and, frankly, a notch above the service one expects or usually gets at a fast food joint.  Unfortunately, that all went to hell the moment I walked in the door.

There was only one other customer in the place and his facial expression - that borderline look between frustration & constipation - should have tipped me off.  There were two employees in the cook line as they were so engrossed in their conversation that they didn't see or hear me come in.  Despite my ""Excuse me's"" & audible sighs they didn't bother to acknowledge me. One of these ladies was a manager.  The other one, working the line, had plastic gloves on but kept touching her shirt as she stood there making the food order in between squeaking with the manager.

I wasn't acknowledged until the drive thru girl came out of the bathroom still zipping up her pants.  When she finally asked if I had been helped yet, I politely said, ""No, and I've changed my mind.""

The customer that was there when I walked in, who was still waiting for his food order, started laughing out loud as I walked out.  Sad, actually, if you stop to consider that he was actually going to eat the food that the gloved employee that kept touching her shirt was making for him...

Not coming back to this Taco Bell - ever!",JDj2U1Ugnwn59nJTiN3dgQ,0,0,2,FvsxLZ3Rcl7sWWxnJ9Ig3g

5748540,2016-07-05,0,s-QHEBYI2c2VuOQdEi0qPQ,if i could give a  negative star review i would! we can't in the morning with a big order and it took them 15 minutes just to come to the drive thru window to get our money once we finally got our food the food was cold and not right. when i called to tell them the food was wrong and cold they told me they would replace it and to come back in with my reciept when it was convienent so we came back 5 days later when we came back into town and then they told us it was to late to come back for the food we needed to do it before 5 days i told them it was 5 days and the manager i spoke to never said a time frame. so they finally agreed to replace my order and then told me next time i need to come back within 3 days. this taco bell lacks customer service skills and any sort of speed. if your order is larger then one or two things expect to sit there waiting for at least 10 minutes.,6Y-aPujVXGDF3eMrhJybug,0,1,1,0jTx6fGHmUqXJ0Uou7PIJQ
