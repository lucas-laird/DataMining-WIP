I tried the drive thru and waited a few minutes but didn't hear from anybody. I just pulled around and went inside. Glad that I did, everyone was super friendly and the smoothie was awesome as always. Thanks for opening over here",1H1ztomzim9uWvx7Io-wcw,0,1,5,9pnh1uFNC2-YPbTHvRGzsA

The peanut butter and banana flatbread is awesome for a snack and I've also tried a turkey sandwich they have on the menu. Their chipotle mayo is delicious. I like this place because it's a refreshing 24/7 choice instead of a regular fast food chai",GS-9BDva76WHCA1zGKy66A,0,0,4,lwrK8skFwldeWequ5rbB3A

I had some random girl who looked like she was on some type/s of drug/s and stood right next to me asking for money when I was trying to get in my car. I felt very unsafe . I told her no, got into my car and locked the door immediately. She then stood behind my car for a good 5 mins for some odd reason(making it impossible for me to pull out of my parking spot) 

As far as staff members go, they were all very friendly and fairly quick.",qAdjIFcLfngO8_wwz4bqvA,0,0,3,0bsEPeloTP3VRp-gaIG2fw
3176416,2017-11-01,0,sPd9YmvS6eSWzTvqowcBXA,"awesome spot for a fresh smoothie. my boyfriend, best friends, and i come here frequently to grab our smoothies after work and it is always a consistent, quality experience. my favorite is the blueberry bliss smoothie! perfect blend of sweet & savory. their wraps are pretty good too like the southwest and all american breakfast. I have tried a handful of things on the menu including the peaches and silk, the acai berry, the strawberry limeade, and many others. 

Kat, V, and Carissa are always at the window. Super friendly checkout and quality service despite the wait sometimes when they are busy or understaffed. This is my favorite tropical smoothie location for sure in town!",KxuNoB6BaSboVkYQ0T4w7A,1,1,5,IPbVHFtbOdLYiqPBuX9vkw
3514173,2017-06-17,0,sPd9YmvS6eSWzTvqowcBXA,Clean looking spot. Great customer service but the smoothies are lacking a bit. Was impressed by the size of my drink - 18 oz drink for about $6. Pretty good deal until I tried it. Not enough of the ingredients in it so it was somewhat flavorless. :/,cvBxRQhUs17ISvfj9ETh2g,0,0,3,UgUkE0RxbPE64rqJKbRoNA

4185971,2017-09-06,0,sPd9YmvS6eSWzTvqowcBXA,Best smoothie restaurant in La Vegas. I always drink Sunshine smoothie and here they make it the best. Every time I go there it taste excellent.

4224072,2017-08-21,0,sPd9YmvS6eSWzTvqowcBXA,I was very happy with the smoothie I ordered.  I opted for Splenda instead of turbinado sugar.  It tasted great.  The staff was very friendly.  It's a quick walk from The Hard Rock.,N5z93pweC0UkPxDC0zw1Hw,0,0,5,iSdJH8heZ7VL2x10_e6qgA

I ordered a Beach Bum smoothie and a chicken apple sandwich of some sort, the name escapes me and I don't have a menu to look at. The beach bum smoothie was delicious as was the sandwich. My fiance's enjoyed his mango smoothie and sandwich as well. Looks like they have several locations in Cali which we will hit up as well.",QzIzkhECsJ3YvoHZQ0-igQ,0,0,4,YU_KpjSB5Fo-Rdd0UVwI9g
4399621,2017-05-31,1,sPd9YmvS6eSWzTvqowcBXA,"Its nice that this place is open 24/7!  Theres nothing more that I crave after going hard at the day club than a nice cold fruit smoothie.

The quality of the smoothie is just ok.  Its strangely  powdery and I'm not sure what the powder is.  All the ingredients listed on the board were fruit and sherberts but I noticed they dumped in a scoop of powder of some sort.  I did decline the free vitamin add-on so I don't think it was that.

I got the classic Mango drink which was pretty similar to mango-a-go-go at Jamba Juice.

I will probably come here again as its the only place open late but I'd prefer Jamba Juice if it was open.",imOiALa3vfuYQQZJhRwCgw,1,1,3,AwnZAM4r0IXgOtiVrFbdug

The woman working the window was extremely rude, and did not have any customer service skills, on top of that we waited about 15 minutes at the window for our food, which is rediculous, tropical smoothie really needs to work on their time management, being that we were the only customers in the drive thru.",nLuIHU9iiQ3m_CITjIrSgQ,0,0,1,u4r2Y1rBN2htnaETJ3Drlg
5503822,2017-04-30,0,sPd9YmvS6eSWzTvqowcBXA,"I think all Tropical Smoothies are great, but compared to other Tropical Smoothies in town, this branch could do better. I went here about a week ago before an event I had to go to at UNLV. My usual drink at Tropical Smoothie  is a Chocolate Chiller with Strawberries - I was very sad that they took this off the menu a while ago, but older Tropical Smoothie locations that I go to are still able to make that drink. I also noticed that they added a drink called the Beach Bum, which is strawberries, bananas, and chocolate. Very similar. I rolled up to the drive-thru window and the employee told me that they couldn't make the Chocolate Chiller with strawberries and that they only had the Beach Bum that I could order as an alternative. In my head, I was thinking, ""Uhm can't you just take the bananas out then??"" I was in a hurry and just went with it because I don't mind getting something a little different. I just don't know why the employees at this branch couldn't accommodate a simple request and think out of the box. At least they were quick with their service so I'll give them that.",didQq47ggh7iAxd5_wkuQQ,0,0,3,J1BUe_ZoPS9W1oUZZkcDXQ
5740621,2018-05-11,11,sPd9YmvS6eSWzTvqowcBXA,"I like this location, which is across from the Hard Rock Hotel and is open 24/7, YES I said 24/7! How cool is that? So, if I get a craving for a smoothie at 3am, I can satisfy that and even do the Drive Thru!

It was my first time here and Im glad I stopped in. Very clean and smelled nice.
I did not realize that they only offer one size for the smoothies.. $5.99. And, yes the smoothie is twice the size as a smoothie for the same price at Jamba Juice. I thought that was awesome.

I had the strawberry/banana protein and my friend had the pomegranate smoothie. Both were super delicious. I would say that two people could share one of these as the size is enormous! Variety of menu choices from juices, smoothies, sandwiches and much more. All moderately priced.  

24/7 with a Drive Thru! Only in Las Vegas..",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,25,25,5,POOP0WKiBp3eKF-YwNz1mw
