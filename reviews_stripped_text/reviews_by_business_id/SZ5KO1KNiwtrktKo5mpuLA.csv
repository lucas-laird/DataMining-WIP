This restaurant is the most attractive Chinese restaurant around.  It is to the right of  Rao's in Caesar's Palace.  I love going up the elevator and then walking into the dining room. Nice high pitched ceilings, modern furniture in a cool ivory arranged in a circular fashion.  It was very special and unique.  The service was really good. The servers were attentive. They poured my tea, continually stopped by with water (have you tried getting water at a Chinese restaurant???), and it was overall such a wonderful and lovely experience.  Low key, elegant, and calm. The perfect antidote to the craziness beyond its walls.  My only gripe would be the hostess that met us upstairs.  I like nice people who are polite and she was haughty and that is a very unattractive quality. Yet the hostess on the main floor of the casino was very sweet and pleasant...that's one reason why we felt we were willing to try it going into the elevator to be hoisted upstairs.

Our server was Vicky and she knew absolutely everything about the food.  She was so terrific and just REAL! Her favorite is the General Tso's Chicken so we got that dish. My husband and friend liked it...I don't eat chicken so will not comment on it personally.  

We also ordered the Sea Bass and Tofu Hot Pot.  OMG -- this was EXCELLENT. The sea bass was completely succulent and the tofu was just right...soft and soaked up the sauce.  This was my favorite dish. 

The third dish we ordered was Buddha's Delight.  There was an ingredient I enjoyed however did now know what it was..Vicky told us it was gingko.  Great!  Now I know I love gingko.

I ordered a special dessert...I do not remember the name of it - although Vicky wrote it for me in Chinese...however I will describe it as being made with barley and is a sweet slightly syrupy soup...it was quite good except...it looked to be a huge portion but was not...more soupy than substantive - however I still liked it - quite a bit. And maybe it is suppose to be soupy? Vicky described it as a healthy dessert...if you know Chinese medicine...this had some medicinal herbs in it.

The tea is not on the house like at other Chinese restaurants yet it was only $3...what a DEAL!  I ordered the chrysanthemum tea and it came with rock sugar on the side. JUST delicious.  Before the teapot was half empty, Vicky had brought out a fresh pot for me.  THANK YOU Vicky...that is really attentive service!

I would come back again and feel totally confident suggesting it to my friends.  I hope that you, dear reader, will go to this restaurant and enjoy the ambiance of the gorgeous and softly lit low key dining room.",uN-tjdXAkZZSP7x_sEF8Dw,0,0,5,V2DPMmmXfKMssVp_zzCciw

O_O.... but the food is alright.. it is kinda more expensive than chinese food should be but its not bad. Simple soup costs 8$ ^. The pork fried rice was good! Came to this place twice!.. Not bad....

1079113,2011-09-05,0,SZ5KO1KNiwtrktKo5mpuLA,"This was hands-down the single worst dining experience I have had in years.  And the problems ran from making reservations (I was transferred 3 times, even though I called the # on the website) to service to the awful food.
We went for restaurant week and had to request the menu as it wasn't offered.  Once we placed our dinner order, my cocktail arrived promptly, but it took over 30 minutes to get our first course!  There were only two of us and it did not appear to be busy.  
I had the chicken corn chowder and only took a few bites.  The chicken broth had been thickened with cornstarch so it had that weird viscous texture, then there was no flavor.  It needed to be seasoned and there was only a bit of corn and what looked like maybe egg drop.  
My second course was fish with filet mignon, mushrooms and fried rice.  The fish was very strange. It looked as though it had been pan-fried, there was no real batter, just perhaps a light dusting of flour or such, but the fish itself, not the coating, was absolutely greasy and all I tasted was oil.  This is strange, because it was sea bass and not an oily fish.  In fact I am not even sure how they cooked it to get it that oily.  And I found a bone in my first bite.
The mushrooms were quite rubbery, the sauce tasted like brown water and the fried rice was greasy and flavorless.  The filet mignon was very tender, but in a strange canned-beef sort of way.  
Neither of us ate hardly any of this course.  In fact there was quite a bit of food left on the plates.  When the server came he asked if we weren't hungry.  I said no, I didn't like it.  He mumbled something and walked away.
Our dessert was mango pudding and mochi.  A mixture of hard, underripe mango and a very delicious mochi (it looked like the brand I buy at Trader Joe's, ha!).
After each course, we would push our plates out of the way, staff would walk by and look, but keep on walking.  I had to ask for my check.
I would normally have higher standards for fine dining restaurants that charge more for their food, but even compared to my neighborhood Chinese take-out, this is far worse.  I am really just dumbfounded at how truly awful the food was through and through.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,0,0,1,D16r2VoTb3tgweglAFN6kQ

My parents brought me to Empress Court for dinner with my boyfriend and it was an AMAZING meal. Yes it's pricey but the food is really good and the service is impeccable. AND you get to take the secret elevator up to the actual dining area where it's quiet, peaceful and relaxing. 

When you get up to the main floor there is a really pretty fish tank in front of you and the restrooms are to the left. A hostess will lead you to your seat underneath a beautiful ceiling with twinkling lights. They also have beautiful art on the walls and the tables and chairs they use are very classy. The waiters/waitresses are always on top of their game; when we were there we never had to ask them for anything, they filled our waters, tea, wine, without us asking and did everything on point.

I had a hot and sour soup to start which was quite delicious. This is one of my favorite soups and I'm glad I ordered it as a starter. For our meal we all shared the lobster, mapo tofu, kung pao chicken and fried rice with pork and shrimp. I really liked the tofu since it was in a semi-spicy sauce and the tofu was really soft and luscious. The kung pao was very good as well, and I really liked how they didn't overload the dish with peanuts and instead let every ingredient play its part. The lobster dish was an entire lobster in sauce, even the head!! The fried rice wasn't really anything special, so I'd pass on this next time. 

Of course we couldn't resist dessert so we had the key lime pie and the chocolate mousse with raspberry. They were both DIVINE. I was surprised because they weren't Asian desserts but they were perfect!! The key lime had a very potent but yummy citrus flavor and the chocolate mousse was fluffy and delectable. They even put little crunchies inside to give the mousse some texture, something I've never had before!

The only down side to Empress is the price but I think it's well worth it. Definitely check it out if you are looking to splurge on some nom food and want to do so in a quiet, beautiful atmosphere.",UVs_7nPjqK_W_ap96IClpA,0,0,4,X4YD4qxjJkbtQ-3g0PXDKw

It's pretty well hidden and you have to go through an elevator before you actually reach the restaurant. I highly recommend it though if you won some good ol' cold hard cash or you have some caesar's palace rewards points or something that will cover your dining experience here. I absolutely LOVE their duck wraps as heart stopping as they may be...keep them coming! Live shrimp with soy sauce and fresh chili peppers? YUM! and it's not on the menu but they have asparagus with garlic which completes the meal perfectly. It's no ordinary asparagus I guarantee you. 

CAUTION: stay away from the bird's nest soup. $100 dollars? You have to be kidding me! Stick with the fried banana.",tZ6UTquj55ULeqKjckOsug,3,1,4,8-NFUeZRKtw8sTOM9U17KA

The ceiling is this beautiful outer space dome but the sound echoes so badly that you feel like a schizophrenic hearing voices in your head!

This is our third time here, bur this place has gone down the hill even my easily satisfied hubby said so.  I guess this would be our last visit.

Here is my take on their food: 

Spring rolls, no flavor at all!

Sweet and sour pork, too sweet!!!!, no good!

Mongolian beef was just ok, not good enough for the price.

Chicken with salty fish pot, too much chicken, barely any salty fish, lol.

I forgot what the other dish we ordered, must check the pics to verify.  If I can't remember what we ordered, it must not be memorable.  

The ambiance was good, the seating was very comfortable which made up for the food.  If there weren't waiters walking around, I could fancy I was in a Buddhist temple.

If upscale Chinese food is what you want. Empress court will fulfill your want, but your needs, that may take a little more.

The elevator and hostess on the bottom floor gives you a feeling of secrecy and exclusivity. the inside the restaurant is quite small. 

The walnut shrimp was excellent, huge succulent shrimp. The peking duck is lackluster, I prefer the traditional bao, but E.C. serves their peking duck in a wheat wrap. They even add red bell peppers, not what I'm used to. The bell pepper throws off the taste and distracts from the duck. The lettuce wraps were plentiful and sufficient. The show stopper was the scallop fried rice, dry shreds of scallops, egg whites and rice was a perfect combination. The crab sauteed in ginger was unimpressible, and not a dish I would order again. The mango pudding was refreshing and had nice chunks of real mango in it. 

The service was very good, attentive if you know the server. We had a familar favorite.",tB8K22NTv8HXHysFnyrYqw,4,2,4,MzZDDUKFoI1Nh4Q00T-cig

The waiter showed us the best way to eat it and it was a great experience. And then.....it came. We had what can only be called THE Asian experience. We ordered the geoduck (pronounced gooey duck). This was something! A clam that lives for centuries and burrows in the ocean floor. We ordered it XO, which was with a sauce uncluding snow peas. The texture was something like calamari, but not as chewy. It was thinly sliced and well prepared. So good! If there was a flaw, I would say the drinks were a bit sedate. I had an Emperor Sun, it was good and fresh, but no real pop. Overall, what an experience!",5kB0kv9YCsSoDO1CI85pvw,2,1,5,xrA3VpnfiYRBv39TQdd_2Q
