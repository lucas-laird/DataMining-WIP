I don't usually complain about a couple dollars however this does add up on my following trips. Go to the Tropical Smoothie on Charleston.

There's a girl who works in the mornings who either didn't get trained well enough or is just clueless. She never knows how to do anything. I wanted to buy a gift card and get the free smoothie they advertise and she literally said ""wait, I don't think I know how to do that."" What??

Then there's ROBERT. He works there some evenings. Same thing, went to buy a gift card,  noticed that none of its value went towards my points on the app, so I said he must be doing something different than the other employees I've dealt with. He rudely says ""if you don't like how I'm doing my job come back in the morning and speak to my manager"". 

I've never experienced such bad customer service at any other location. Shame...",TSZhoVwD1HJxZKzWpW8J5w,3,0,2,ZEIFbkJA86lT_ZpRLQcBAA

The other location is always amazing. This location on the other hand... not so much. I've gone here 4 times.  3 out of the 4 the bananas on my flat bread were soggy & brown. I can't taste any protein in my shack & it's mostly blended ice. If I can taste the ice but not the protein, something is out of balance. So this time I ask the the girl to please use fresh bananas instead of precut. Instead of saying no problem or sorry about that. She decided to argue with me telling me she always does. Then I get my shake again it taste like ice with no protein. Plus, she mean mugged me, didn't bother giving me a straw or saying thanks you. I just looked at her and said your welcome!

2876804,2018-03-02,0,9zvglUorc3YOpN3SyJQKZw,"Love Tropical Smoothie especially their Peanut Paradise smoothie. You get to select what kind of protein you want in your smoothie but I go for the traditional whey protein. On average a smoothie would cost about ~$6 but they offer a half smoothie and half sandwich of your choice option for just about ~$4 more, which is a great deal considering the size of the sandwich and the size of the smoothie is rather large themselves and you also get to select chips of your choosing. The place was clean but the service was very slow. Took about 20 minutes for our two smoothies and sandwich when we were the only ones there. Every time I visit this location it's very inconsistent with the speed of my order or if they have the correct fruits in stock. If they can be more consistent with what smoothies they have in stock and provide faster service I could see this location getting more business. They also have an app where you can order ahead of time and pick up your order when it's ready to avoid the line. Have not tried that yet but will definitely give it a shot if service continues being slow.",hMwPqwbNQV94fWSBhM4QaQ,0,0,3,8tlH7G6D1e4qGLRUbKua7w

First experience: 
Went through the drive through and as I pulled up the employee says ""what do you want?""
What do I want? I want to be greeted by a friendly voice to an establishment I'm giving my money to. As she repeats my order I only hear half of it before she cuts off the microphone. Next, as I drive up to pay she holds out her hand and gives me attitude when I asked the amount I owed. I'm sorry I didn't pull out my calculator to figure out the total.

Second experience: 
I decided to go inside this time to find an open empty space. I waited a good 4 minutes before an employee decided to stop talking to help me. Again, no ""hello"".... ""welcome""...""how are you""...
As I'm waiting for my drinks my boyfriend tells the girl the restrooms are disgusting and needs attention. He got a condescending sorry and 2 other employees just stand there, one a male, and do nothing. 

I was excited to see a new tropical smoothie open up and I was hoping it was going to be better than the previous one across the street but to my surprise it's worse! So disappointing and disgusting.",1he_r7kQnK5MXOYqXD-Gkg,5,1,1,frEuL0CmXtQ6NQm0wSFcBQ

I've been to this location twice and both times the employee acted like she hated me. It isn't just me ... she acted like she hated the other 2 customers I saw her serve today too. The first time, I wrote it off thinking she may be tired, hungry, having a bad day, just gotten bad news, whatever. But twice in 2 weeks makes me think that this is just the way it is going to be here.

There's a location by LVAC that's only a little further from my house and gives me a 10% discount because of my LVAC membership. I will go there instead and recommend that you do too.

When I asked to cancel my order he told me to come the next day for a refund cause he cannot do it for me, really??? I used to go there a lot , not any more .
