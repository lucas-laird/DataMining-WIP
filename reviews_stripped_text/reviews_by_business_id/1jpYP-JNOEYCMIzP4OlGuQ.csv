46570,2014-04-10,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Surprisingly, the best KALUA PIG in Las Vegas, no joke!

It's so funny coming from Hawaii, and trying all these Hawaiian restaurants out here that not even a full scale 808 restaurant can't compete with a restaurant that is much known for their Chipotle style of service. Yeah their Kalua Pig is that good. I bet if the owner made kind of a spinoff and opened up a full service Hawaiian restaurant that his Kalua Pig would be a big seller. Anyways, carrying on.

Service.
Management is awesome, they are the ones that greet you as you walk in and the ones who check to make sure that your meal is always on point. Carmella (assistant manager) is one of those people that small businesses need. Just an all around good person who cares about the customer, and just a good person to talk to. Ask for her when you drop in!

Food.
Basically the style of food you'll find here is Chipotle X L&L Hawaiian bbq but 100x better. Same process as Chipotle, pick how you want your meal taken in as, a buritto, a bowl, taco set, etc. Then your protein, you already know mines (see first line of review), and then the usual vegetables, salsas, and other exotic sauces. 

All in all, this place is awesome. Decent prices, good food, and great service. 5 stars in my book, enjoy!",LTD2NAIin8vBRFHv9CKrfw,2,1,5,D83kMbtx5Tgwbztk8WcM8Q

Not your average Hawaiian plate lunch spot.  More like a Zaba's/Chipotle with a Hawaiian inspired tastes. 

When we arrived and looked over the menu we were asked if it was our first visit and would we like to sample the meats.  Of course we did.  A delicious seasoned chicken, Kalua pig and a teriyaki style beef. All were delicious and between the four of us we ordered each of the three. 

We ended up with two burritos and two bowls. The portions were very generous. The ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly.  

The bowls were served in real bowls with real silverware.  They do the busing of the table when you are through. I think that adds to the immaculate appearance.  

The staff were so friendly and seemed to sincerely want you to enjoy your meal.  The prices were very fair.  It came to $10 per person with drinks. Quite reasonable for such high quality ingredients and preparation.  

We also sat outside on a nice patio area with umbrellas and palm trees. Nice atmosphere and not too close to traffic on Rainbow.

I took my wife and daughters here for lunch, and was immediately greeted by the owner, with a handshake and a welcoming smile. It was immediately apparent the owner was passionate about his craft when he proudly had us sample his hand crafted recipes for Pork, Beef, and Chicken. They were absolutely amazing. Moist, fresh, and perfectly cooked. The owner talked about his passion for fresh food, and his desire to bring something unique and healthy to Las Vegas, and he delivers. You might think this is another Chipotle, or Zabas but ah you would be wrong. Something about an artisan hand crafting the food he is passionate about that can not be matched by a big chain and employees who have no stake in the business' success. This has the potential to be the next big thing. Unique recipes, huge portion, and humble prices. This is definitely one not to miss, and is sure to be a Vegas favorite.

358360,2014-12-02,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"I go to Braddah's about once week since it is close to my work and offers relatively healthy and filling options.

Here is what I like:  
I can assemble a healthy, filling salad and not be tempted off my healthy eating program (except if you order the coconut bark!).

Their sauces are awesome.  Make sure you ask at the register if they are put out so you don't have to make an extra trip if they aren't.  I use them instead of the salad dressing to save calories and I am not missing a thing!

The ambiance and room temperature are very comfortable.  This is a nice place for me to hang out on my lunch hour while I savor my meal, catch up with a friend or just play with my phone.  At a place like Chipotle, which it is often compared to, I want to get up and leave right away since it is loud, cold and crowded.  Braddah's is not Chipotle.

Nice music. 

The steak is delicious!

The owner is awesome.  When he is there everything runs like clockwork, the food tastes better, the sauces are out and the tables are bussed more promptly.

Here are the drawbacks and why this place doesn't get an extra star from me:

The tables are often not bussed promptly which makes sitting inside somewhat not appealing being surrounded by many dirty tables.

The sauces are out for consumption maybe half the time.

The lemonade flavor in the drink machine is out half the time and it could be half-way through my meal before it's fixed.  Usually when the boss is there, he brings it directly to my table.

When the boss is not there, the employees tend to rush the food-assembling process and/or are not listening so I have to repeat myself several times or ask for things they decided not to offer me (like having grilled veggies WITH my meat selection).

I have also gotten slopplily assembled bowls by employees (setting the bowl down on other food before handing it to me or just dumping the wet contents, like beans, in haphazardly so that they spilled off the side).  Visual is important when it comes to food.

On one occasion the chicken didn't seem to be cooked quite enough.  Again, the boss was not there.

The north door is rarely open for people who park on that side.  Yet one can leave just fine out of the door.  It would be nice if they placed a sign on that door if it is out of order.",XnVUhtBzoykAxSFB-Ypk9w,0,0,3,CRTah8bi-yKw--4jdSI_bg

It was super close to my office, and when I walked in I received a friendly ALOHA from all the staff. I immediately felt good right off the bat. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are big. So sharing is a definite possibility if you know you don't eat a lot.

I tried all three of the meats. Steak was by far my favorite! It was cooked so tender it nearly fell apart and the flavor was so yummy. Their salsas were flavorful and accented the meat.

587665,2014-04-08,1,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Short: Bring a half off or 2 for 1 coupon. Questionable prices, but good food and decent service.

Long: I want to really like this place, but it's not doing itself any favors.
I came here since I've been seeing its coupons on several sites, and yelp had a $5 for $10 coupon up, so I snagged it and came here.
I arrived a bit early, and they were still setting up. In the meantime, they offered me a sample of their meat and I took it up. I haven't had this type of service for a long time. Then they took my order. I got 3 soft tacos with rice and beans, and a drink. 

On my tacos I got Hula Hula Chicken, Kalua Pig, and Palehu Steak. All were very good, but a few problems: 1) If you order a portion of your mean to be the Steak or Fish, you get charged as if your entire order was that--which is extra. 2) The Kalua Pork, while the best meat here, tastes like it's bathing in lard (which is good, kinda). It's just saturated with liquid fat, so do avoid if you're on a diet!
I only got salsa for topping, and I tried the three different--free--salsas they had. The pineapple and tomato/onion salsa were overpowering and I couldn't taste the meat with them in the tacos. The corn one was good. They would be great on anything else, just not with the meat. Leaves me questioning if I should have left them out.

My biggest complaint of food is with the sides. I had rice and beans with the side, and they were TERRIBLE. 
The beans were like straight out of a can. I don't know if they make their own black beans, but they taste like any black beans you can dump from a can.
The rice, while you can tell is made in-house, is the worse. It's some kind of white/wild rice with some of the shell still on it, with some ""seaweed"" spice. This would be great if it was boiled or steam loosely, if the rice wasn't made Japanese/sticky-rice style. By making it sticky, the rice turns to just globs of messy, weird rice. With Japanese sticky rice, this is great as the rice tastes clean, and ""pure"" (hard to explain). But with this, the rice tastes dirty and just unappetizing. 
AVOID these. Several other customers after me--more experienced--didn't touch them for this reason.

I do have to give mad props for having apple juice on the fountain drinks. That's something I've never seen before, and I love apple juice!
They do have two side sauces, which taste like concentrated artificial juice drinks with some hot sauce in them. While good, just doesn't sit right with me.

The service, was meh~. You're served from the counter--Subway style--which means the meat and all the sides are sitting out the entire time, pre-cooked and all. Then, the service ends about there. You get your own drinks, and leave your plates on the table. For the price I would have paid--if not for the coupon I had--this would have been pretty bad.

MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT: Price. I can't see spending $10.25 on what I got. Three OK tacos, terrible rice and beans, and a fountain drink, with little to no service, for $10. I just don't see it. I can dine out for that price, and get much better and more food elsewhere--just not ""Hawaiian"" style. With the $5 for $10 coupon I got from Yelp, it made it worth it, and I'm satisfied. I'm just moved enough to pay $10 for everything. 

Come here if you've got the groupons or Yelp coupon, or if you really want to try this place. Otherwise, I don't see the value in it.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,0,0,3,RAyBkXMR8ZXC6lFHCKTOBA

644062,2013-12-31,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Overall I really liked this place. It is like Chipotle but with Hawaiian meats and sauces. I had the three taco plate with flour tortillas, two tacos were with kalua pig and one with huli huli chicken. The kalua pig was tender and not fattier than what you would expect and the chicken was juicy too. You pick what you want on it (seaweed rice, brown rice, lettue, salsa etc) and they don't charge extra (like Chipotle) for cheese or sour cream. 

I should qualify the Chipotle statement it is the same in that you pick meat, what you want and what you want on it but I am not a fan of Chipotle so this place is much better. 

On my tacos I had both the pineapple salsa and the mango salsa. Also, they had four different house made sauces to try, I didn't try the coconut one (that was the hottest) but my hubby said that it was pretty hot and he loves hot stuff. Also, we got the coconut bark. It was really sweet, good but not my favorite and I don't think I would get it again. Too much going on in the flavor profile and they didn't solidify their sugar while making it so I crunched down on granulated sugar. All in all a good experience.  

I should have taken a picture but I was way too hungry and my hunger weighed out my priorities of posting a pic on Yelp - but I will say that the pictures the other Yelpers have posted was consistent with my experience. 

If you haven't tried this place yet you should give it a go. Cost of this place is reasonable enough too (about $7.00 for the three tacos) that it is definitely worth a try.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,4,aQOnf7pD-DEFi55bN-MmoQ

Same idea as Chipotle: pick your taco/burrito/bowl, pick your meat, pick your toppings. But the meats here are kalua pig, huli huli chicken, and pulehu steak (or grilled fish) -- in each case that's a hawaiian marinated meat, and you get more tropical fruit salsas than your usual pico de gallo and hot chili salsa.

Really, really good food both here and at the UNLV location.

Not to mention extremely friendly staff! We were excited to come back. We figured ""If take out was this good, maybe dining in would be even better!""

Fast forward to today-

We get inside the restaurant and discover that it's a Chipotle style assembly line kind of deal. No biggie...if the foods delicious, I don't mind!  We order bowls this time instead of burritos.  Big bowls...skimpy portions. Our bowl was BARELY 2/3 full. If that's your portion size...please get an appropriate size bowl!!  My daughter got the same taco from last week but  this time it was a pathetic, anorexic version of the one from last week. Maybe a spoonful of meat. They charge $3 for a kids taco and APPARENTLY $1 more for meat. That's $4 for basically nothing!  Not to mention the menu was confusing as hell in regards to the kids taco. I'm sure we're not the only ones to find it confusing and a bit of a rip off. Now what happened in a week to cause this drastic change? The staff wasn't nearly as nice as before. Although the manager did try to remedy the situation and gave us a refund on the taco.  The food wasn't nearly was good as before. Bland, and not very hot.  I'm especially bummed because this was our ""cheat"" meal after eating healthy all week. Last week I was going to be a regular customer...after today...not so much...

The meats are at the core of the flavor here but about half-way through my burrito, I had eaten all the meat and was left with beans, rice, and a bunch of guacamole.  Kalua pig quesadillas were great and tasted better than the trio of tacos and burrito.  We were given some coconut bark to taste, and they were awesome. It actually looked like soda crackers coated with caramel and chocolate topped with coconut.  Very good dessert.

They are definitely generous with their guacamole, and the staff up front were helpful and gracious.  We did notice that when an order was put in for our grilled fish, one of the grill guys rolled their eyes, which made us feel a little apprehensive about quality issues.

In the end, the food was okay (nothing to write home about, except for the bark), and some of the service issues can probably be attributed to the restaurant just opening but one of the grill guys needs to check his attitude at the door.

I hope this restaurant does well, but I think it needs to calibrate taste and distribution of ingredients in the food.",ld6Y4P4lntLEgMvVe81-2A,1,0,3,tZI951QouxEeMwZCmTsQAQ

I'm by no means Hawaiian or do I know much about the culture, but I don't believe I have to just to give a great review. All their food is fresh and it's simple. Sometimes trying out new place I can get a little overwhelmed by all the different options, but they keep it simple. If I were to compare it to some other restaurant I would honestly say its incomparable. You can choose between making a burrito bowl, a regular bowl with seaweed rice or brown rice, a salad, 3 tacos or their nachos. For me I ALWAYS go for the three tacos, I usually get each one different (Huli Huli Chicken, Kahlua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, or Grilled Veggies).  From there you pick what you want on top of it. The other toppings are great, but in no way, shape or form compare to their homemade sauces! They have Charred Pineapple Verde (mild), Mango & Roasted Corn (medium) and Tomato w/ grilled Maui Onions (hot). Bottom line, if you go to Bruddah's and don't try their sauces and most of all their coconut Bark, you're missing out! Also on top of being amazing, their coconut bark switches up during specific holidays (Thanksgiving- they have pumpkin bark). I could go on forever, but you might as well check it out for yourself.",LZhHJEwqkAycWSZoym3Iog,0,0,5,ol1uZoDdHXpuXLmlYAtOTg

I wasn't sure what kind of meat to pick, so I did half kahlua pig & half steak. I liked them both, but I'm also glad that I did half and half because I feel like too much of either and I would've felt sick. For the meats you have a choice of their huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish or grilled veggie.. then your choice of rice/beans/cabbage/lettuce/veggies. I picked the seaweed rice which I absolutely loved. I can't decide if I like Chipotle's cilantro rice or Braddah's seaweed rice better! For salsa, you have the choice of a mild charred pineapple verde, medium mango & roasted corn, or spicy tomato with grilled maui onion. I had the mild pineapple verde and my friend had the medium mango & charred corn... both of us decided that the salsas were on the sweet side (not really a fan). I did order the roasted sesame gingerette dressing on the side (they also have a papaya buttermilk ranch), and normally I love anything sesame, but I wasn't crazy for this dressing. 

I added cheese and guacamole on top... love cheese so that was obligatory. The guac... I prefer the guac from chipotle! It wasn't bad here, I just wouldn't order it again as there just wasn't much happening in terms of flavor. 

They have canned Hawaiian Sun drinks here.. I had the green tea with ginseng. This stuff was so good! It tasted more like a juice, but it was still really good. Now I just need to find out where I can buy these little gems!

Overall, I would probably come back.. but not on the regular like some of my yelp friends. It is good, not GREAT or anything aaaahmazzzing... but not bad/terrible either.",eLxR9WkbmMfRKLOKDabr_w,2,1,4,Kgx6VYEPMye2swqlToH_sg

1230052,2014-11-27,2,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"My husband and I stopped by Braddah's this past Friday for lunch around 12:30 pm. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and acknowledged by the 3 employees behind the counter. They asked us if this was our first time here and if we would like to try a sample of their food. So two of the employees started to scoop up each of the meat options (fish, beef, pork, chicken) in a small cardboard container for each of us to try. After that, we decided to order:

Huli Huli Chicken Salad Bowl with Brown Rice and roasted corn ($6.95 prior to tax): I wanted to get a salad but because I am Asian, I wanted to have some brown rice (odd combination, but I really did like the rice in this salad bowl). I did not have any dressing with this salad and thought the flavor of the chicken and roasted corn was enough to flavor up my bowl. The chicken was tender. The portion of this bowl was more than enough for myself for lunch. 

Kalua Pork Burrito on Whole Wheat Tortilla ($6.95 prior to tax): This burrito is a pretty large size (perfect for 2 meals). You have your choice of ordering this on a flour tortilla as well and additional toppings you desire (it does cost extra for avocado). My husband ordered this with the seaweed rice, corn, Maui onions, diced tomatoes and some lettuce. The burrito was an excellent combination of flavors that was perfect for our lunch. 

Coconut Bark (1/4 pound free with Yelp check in): I was pretty happy to see that I could get a 1/4 pound of coconut bark for free with the check in on my app. My husband and I both had a piece of it after we finished our meals. I loved the caramel, chocolate and coconut pieces in each delicious bite and wanted more. I loved the coconut bark so much that I decided to purchase 1/2 pound to take back home. Too bad Braddah's isn't closer to me because I could see myself coming more often just for this dessert to bring for parties (or just to eat by myself). 

I wished there was a trash can in the seating area so that I can throw out my own used cardboard dishes and put away my own tray because I saw some tables that still needed to be attended to, although customers may have left a while ago. 

Braddah's has some in house spicy sauces and my husband loved the mango, pineapple habanero sauce the best. Unfortunately one small bottle cost $6.95 (prior to tax) that my husband was not willing to purchase to take back home. Since I am not into spicy foods, I didn't try any so I can't comment on the taste. But my husband did mention that he liked the sweet spiciness. 

I am definitely a big fan of this restaurant and wouldn't mind coming back here again the next time I am in Vegas. The food was wonderful and and service was nice. I liked the Hawaiian music playing while we ate our lunch. This place reminded me of eating in someone's home because it was very welcoming (truly the aloha Hawaiian spirit). 

Just want to mention that there is free wifi here (password protected, long password is posted on the wall in the restaurant) that was pretty fast. The women's restroom was clean.

Step 1 - choose one -  burrito, bowl, salad, or tacos - 
Step 2 - choose one - meat (chicken, pig, steak, fish, veggies)
Step 3 - choose any - seaweed rice OR brown rice, black beans, and grilled veggies
Step 4 - choose one- charged pineapple verde, mango & roasted corn, tomato w/ grilled maui onions
Step 5 - choose any - sour cream, cheese, lettuce, jalapeno, cabbage, lime, cilantro, bean sprouts, habenero, lava chips

My combination was a burrito with the huli huli chicken, seaweed rice, black beans, mango & roasted corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, jalapeno. 

It was $6.95 + tax .. pretty similar to chipotle in pricing but a different taste. 

To be honest, i thought flavor wasnt really there. It was quite plain. The only thing that really STOOD out was the jalepeno. Surprisingly spicy despite a lot of other places with jalepenos werent really spicy lately. Aside from that, not much flavor in the chicken, not the mango and roasted corn salsa.

And he was like ""listen to this, you gotta check out this place, it's called Braddah's Island Style, and I'll give you $12 bucks of food for only $6. What do you say?"" I was like, ""ok, you twisted my arm, but be a little bit more gentle next time because that kinda hurt, I shall take you up on your offer."" And so our journey began.

It's really similar to Chipotle. You can either order a burrito, 3 tacos, a bowl, and a salad (just make sure it's not a tossed one). Then you order your meats and toppings. Go for the steak, it's worth it. Hey! Not really a steak eater? Well then young sir, there are also other options available such as pork, chicken, and fish. Oh, so now you don't eat animals. No problem my friend, because Braddah's has that base covered too. You can get some tofu. There you go.

These guys don't skimp on the toppings. I was so moved by their generosity that the tears almost, sorta, kinda, maybe decided to think that they were going to fall, but it wasn't the case.

I see you coconut bark, giving me the eye with your deliciousness. Looking all sexy in the corner over there. Oh, I'm heading your way soon enough. Just give me some time to get things situated with my situations, then we'll talk.

After I finished eating, I looked to my left and next to me was a roach that just appeared (since it wasn't there when we sat down). So, obviously I felt nauseous because it's not a sight you want to see after you eat. We told the front cashier and his reaction surprised me. He simply said ""Oh ok."" As if roaches are a typical issue for this restaurant. And as we grabbed our stuff (while I felt like throwing up), he stood there waiting for us to move so he could get it.

Got 3 bowls:  Kalua pig, steak, and huli huli chicken.

All the meats were nicely flavored and tender.  My favorite by far was the steak.  

Steak had nice crisp edges while remaining juicy throughout every bite.
Huli huli and kalua pig both had nice light smoky flavor.

Only bummer was the seaweed rice.  It was hard and kind of dried out.  

Grilled onion salsa and pineapple salsa were delicious.  I mixed that in together which distracted me from the hard rice. 

The bottled sauces on the counter were unnecessary.  I tried them anyway but didn't do much to add .  In fact, they probably take away from the flavor of the delicious meats.  Definitely able to create a well rounded meal if you add everything they offer.

I ate here more than a year ago and never returned since I did not like it, but recently returned to give it another shot. So there were a few things I noticed. The meat is sitting there and looks as if it were sitting there for a long time. It did not look freshly cooked. Most of the meats were at the bottom of the container it was in and needed a refill. Were they waiting to serve the very last bit before grilling more meat? Lucky me got the last of the meat. I tried the chicken and it had barely any taste. I never order pulled pork in restaurants but since the chicken was flavorless and the steak was slathered in sauce I went for the pork. They charge extra for avocado which is the same as Chipotle but it is free at Zaba's with a salad. Avocado just does not taste good with these mix of flavors at Braddah's. The woman who got my bowl shaked it off before putting food inside (guess it was wet from dishwashing?) nevertheless thanks for the bowl filled with drops of water. I find the food bland and weird mix of flavors. I honestly liked nothing about this place, especially the food which was not fresh. I think that when meat looks dried out and old it is time to replace it with a new batch, especially during the day on a weekend.

Like Chipotle, you order by selecting your protein and choosing a bowl, burrito, tacos, or salad. You also have a lot of similar add-on options like black beans, (fresh!) grilled veggies, and guac.
Like Chipotle, the protein options here are tasty- but I can find a chicken burrito on nearly every corner. I can't find huli huli chicken or kaluah pig very easily at all- and here, both are phenomenally well done! Bonus points for generous portions, too.

But what makes this place really stand out, in addition to the tasty island flavor, is the service- when I walk into a place and am greeted by the owner himself, it means something to me.

Sweet with a nice kick from the habanero  sauce.

I prefer the pig here. It might be salty for some people, but it works well with the pineapple salsa and a bit of sour cream. The chicken is okay, but I was not a fan of the steak. If that's what you're going for, this isn't the place. They are on point with the pig though. 

Buyer beware, when you get shredded pork (or any meat), there's a lot of juices. So if you're getting tacos your shell/tortilla may get soggy on a to go order. I personally like to separate the tacos from one another to avoid juicy sogginess. 

Definitely try some of the coconut bark. It's a delicious medley of flavor that won't disappoint.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,0,2,5,Q5fE6Zty7fayhwW4Rol2Xg

2017203,2013-12-05,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Due to a recent incident at this restaurant, it was difficult to give an unbiased overview since I personally will not be patronizing this spot any more. But here's a quick breakdown:
Food quality: A
Creativity: B+/A-, yes it's a knockoff of Chipotle but the food is amazing and the executive chef's new handmade, preservative-free sauces are phenomenal.
Cleanliness/quality of premises: A
Service/quality of staff (minus the owner): A

 I like the premise of this place: keep it simple, use a presentation that people are used to but with an island flair. And it works. There set-up is a lot like Chipotle: pick what style of food you want, choose your meats or opt for vegetarian and then pick your sides. And I must say, their Huli Huli Chicken and their steak are good and their Kalua Pig is amazing. And, as mentioned above, their Exec. Chef, I forgot his name, makes great/creative sauces regularly and there's a new one all the time. 
            I was definitely a fan of this spot and promoted it to everybody I knew. 
What changed? In short: the owner and his attitude/passive-aggressive demeanor. What happened: Myself, my gf and my brother went for dinner one night because I had been there 3 times prior and really wanted them to try it. We get there, order and everything is cool. Now, nearly every time I had come here, the sauce situation was different. The first two trips: they had like one sauce per table (a Pik-a-Pepper sauce I think) and the third time is when they rolled out these handmade creations. And each table seemed to have one of each of the handmade sauces. This particular time, none of the tables around us had any sauces on them. Since the sauces were like 40% of why I wanted to come back again, I looked around and noticed a rack with several bottles of each sauce. I figured: hey, they switch it up each time...maybe they put them on this one rack so they have to waste ingredients making a bottle of each sauce for each table. So I go and grab them for our table. Cool. A minute later, another customer in the same predicament went to grab sauces and was informed that those bottles on the rack were for sale and that there are bottles floating around that say ""Table"" on them for customer use. Of course, I and my group felt bad. But right after, the guy come over to the table and before he said anything, we said ""We just heard you tell them and we're so sorry...we'll pay for them. It's not a big deal, they're worth whatever the cost."" His response: ""So the wasn't big enough huh?"" We apologized again as he was walking away. He came right back with a purple sharpie to right ""Table"" on our bottles, overtly suggesting that now he can't sell these and he has to use them for other customer. We apologized again and he said, with an obviously forced smile, ""Don't worry. I'm the owner, it's my place. I just want my customers to be happy."" We replied, ""Are you sure, man?"" He says, ""Whatever makes you happy."" I had been apologetic up to this point, but now knowing that he was manager kind of ticked me off. He left again, and then we looked at this sign...I kid you not...that sign was in like 10 pt font....we were the closest table to the rack and couldn't read it from our table. (Which btw, is not only bad for avoiding people misusing the bottles but also is a bad way to promote that your sauces are for sale). As we were finishing up, he comes back again with a new sign, still in 10 pt font, and put the sign ON TOP of the bottles, so nobody can grab them without seeing it. 
Seriously dude? We messed up, that was admitted and we were willing and able to pay for it so as not to cheat an up-and-coming business but your attitude and demeanor, for being the owner, makes us not only never want to come back but to warn the folks t o which we previously promoted your biz. If it was an employee that was rude, fine, I'd excuse it but I cannot bring myself to support a place when the owner was directly rude. Here's how it should have went down, even if we didn't offer to pay for them, you eat the cost of those bottles ($21), be cool about it since it was a genuine mistake, wait til we leave and then make whatever changes you need to. Instead, you have to eat the cost of those bottles anyways, but your passive-aggressive manner has now lost my business and others' as well. Your staff was amazing and really does embody the laid back and friendly island spirit...but you on the other hand...need to learn how to embody the ""Mahalo"" vibe that you aim to promote.",AolnyiEB_UMlQtD_dp5E9g,11,0,3,cH815ihHTJIbvBrXBPqCSw

I used to travel to Hawaii a lot back in the day to visit my friends who were from there (Iolani vs Punahou forevah!). And by 'Hawaii', I don't mean Waikiki Beach. But since they all eventually moved here to the mainland, I haven't been back in a while. I just don't remember Hawaiian food being anything like this at all. Maybe things have changed. Anyways...
I kind of doubt that authenticity is the objective here. As many people stated, it's a Qdoba/Chipotle concept place with the Hawaiian theme. There are lots of interesting items you can build, such as a burrito, a bowl, and a salad using the basic proteins that they have. You then add on the extras as shown on the menu. No need to rehash what everyone else wrote. The server will guide you step by step. They also have a wide variety of sauces that you can use which I don't feel is necessary, because it seems to mask the taste of the food to me. Overall I thought the meal was quite good, including the coconut bark dessert of which you can ask for a free sample. 
The service was over the top. They will offer you samples of all the meats and they will even offer you samples of sauces if this is your first visit. They will also insist that you try a sample of the coconut bark dessert and I got a coupon for a free 1/4 lb box of coconut bark with my next meal purchase. I make a big deal about service and even if the food may be just ok to some, this place deserves at least 4 stars.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,5,5,4,aSZhDC5RHGFHDf8s2apokA

Step 5 - Add more toppings (included) - sour cream, cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, cabbage, lime, cilantro, bean sprouts

I then moved on to the selection of the meat and not wanting to focus on just a single meat I did all (Kalua pig, Huli Huli chicken, and Pulehu steak), but the grilled fish sounds like a crowd pleaser as well yet seems easily forgotten when stacked up against a triple threat like that. I'll invest in a potential fish taco next stop so I can truly say I've tried it all.

I will pause to discuss the highs and lows of each protein as unfortunately it was not as consistent amongst each as my heart anticipated. Hands down my favorite was the Kalua pig, truly a high recommendation here. I found it to be melt in your mouth tender and did make me reminisce of the paradise cove luau in Oahu so how's that for authentic? 

I was however left to desire that same experience with both the Huli chicken and Pulehu steak. I was mentioning to my wife that the seasoning was clearly there partnered with the slightest char taste radiating off each bite were impressive, but where things fell flat for me was the fact that both tasted a bit tough and if they had been more moist and tender it'd surely even have made King Kamehameha himself lick his chops over and over again!

The remaining three steps is the traditional topping overload (rice, beans, veggies, etc.), but the highlight for me here was their charred pineapple verde. There are a few other salsa choices here (mango and roasted corn or tomato w/grilled Maui onion) and maybe for round #2, but this one again was a party pleaser. I don't quite know what exactly it was about it, but the sweetness from the pineapple and light hint of char worked very well with the mixing of all that went in the taco. Another must try here for sure!

Although it wasn't consumed until the following day I want to bring honorable mention to the coconut bark as it left both us howling at the moon..the bark itself was soft and flaky, but throw some silky butterscotch layers on top of it and you'll be saying aloha in no time. I'm glad the cashier lead us to this vs. the regular bark as it took the meal to an all time level!

So all in all, (to play off of the rainbow road location) I can say Braddah's is certainly a pot of gold after it hands down. Even after all this time I can honestly say my lucky charms are salivating at another chance to consume some of this cuisine all over again!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,0,0,4,Wohjiaeb6jwjJDEPO4sy4w

Have you every had Chipotle's, Café Rio, and Qdoba? It's basically like those places but using Hawaiian inspired ingredients. Honestly I can see this place doing real good, I mean Chipotle and likes are pretty popular and Braddah's isn't that bad. It actually got busy after I got there.

You first choose what you want a burrito (flour or whole wheat tortilla), a bowl, a salad, or 3 tacos (soft flour or crispy corn). Then you choose your meats. They'll let you sample the meats, they were very delicious. They have huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish, and grilled veggies. Then you add various non-meat items.

There was a Groupon which I remembered after I got there and quickly bought. I decided on two burritos. Burrito #1: Whole wheat tortilla stuffed with pulehu steak, seaweed rice, black beans, charred pineapple verde, mango and roasted corn, lettuce, jalapenos, lime, and cilantro. It was GOOD. Burrito #2: Flour tortilla stuffed with huli huli chicken, grilled veggies, black bean, tomato with grilled maui onions, charred pineapple verde, sour cream, lettuce, lime, and cilantro. It was also GOOD. Both of the burritos could've used more heat but that's just me. I don't think I've ate anything like it back home but I really liked it.

They are decorated in island themed things, with I believe a drive thru and seating inside and outside. The service is very friendly. Plus I saw that they're planning on opening more locations around the Valley.

WHEN: On Sunday through Wednesdays, they are open from 11am-9pm. On Thursdays they are open from 11am-10pm. On Friday & Saturdays, they are open from 11am-11pm.

WHERE: Located in the plaza on  Rainbow & Sahara.

WHAT: If you are craving Chipotle, but with different ingredients, you may like this place! My friends and family have been raving about this place for the longest time ever, so I finally decided to try the so-called Hawaiian Chipotle because I saw a Groupon for it! (Thank goodness for Groupon!)

The dining area is decently sized, and may possibly allow about 20+ people to sit and eat. It is definitely new and clean = +++.

There were also 2 different types of dressings as well- and I chose to try both. The first was a Papaya Ranch, which was a creamy goodness. The other sauce/dressing was a tamarind base, if I can remember, which also was good and Tangy.

For dessert, I had to try their famous Coconut Bark, caramel brittle with chocolate, and coconut sprinkled on top. It was a tad bit too sweet for me, but it was definitely OFF-THE-HOOK!",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,8,8,3,l-juUgnPDDvA1iaZnOyEbg

I am giving it 2 stars because I did think the ranch dressing was pretty good. The rest needs some help. I will not be dining here again.

As others have said, it's a Hawaiian chipotle. Upon entering, you get an amazing sense of customer service already. They asked us if we have ever been before, and when we responded no, they gave us a sample of all the meats. I loved the flavors of the meat. I got a chicken and steak combo burrito on a WHEAT tortilla with fajita veggies, mango salsa, and the hot tomato pico salsa along with everything else. It was amazing and so big that they had to double wrap it. Usually, I am not a carb person, but it was the weekend so I killed that bad boy and easily ate my entire DV of calories. The steak has 5 slice and hoisin. It's sweeter than Mexican marinated meats but completely delicious. The food was plentiful and a plate of 3 tacos and my burrito fed us all. 

My only complaint is that the food wasn't hotter. The meat in our samples were room temperature and I usually like my food scalding. We had 2 people come by to check on us, and were even given a sample of their holiday bark which was greatly appreciated.

Added; I got home and found myself dissapointed in the meal I purchased.. I got the Palehu beef, for both myself and my partner. The amount for the $$ was not impressive. I have never had palehu anything that had so much Chinese 5 spice or licorice flavor ever in my life. I respect everyone's  individual spin on a recipe, however this caught me off guard.

The first time I had Braddah's, my boyfriend schlepped from his office clear to my place (about a 1/2 hour drive) with Braddah's takeout. Even a half hour later, the food was amazing. I was hooked. He brought me a Huli Huli chicken bowl with the mango-corn salsa, seaweed rice and black beans - the perfect post work-out meal. 

The next time I had it, I went to the actual store on Rainbow & Sahara - excellent, quick service, a clean restaurant and very friendly employees. Try their hot sauces - the guava one is to die for, and everything is homemade, bottled and labelled by the owner. They even have a drive-thru which, while I haven't been through it yet, is just a fantastic idea. Healthy food on the go that's not freakin Subway? Love it. 

Awesome local joint for a quick, healthy and delicious meal - I can't wait to see them open up in Green Valley/Henderson so I can get my Braddah's fix more frequently! My only suggestion to them? Start a stamp card program like Cafe Rio has - I feel like my boyfriend and I would have filled a few cards by now!!

My first time was a few days after Braddah's opened their doors. I was greeted warmly by a young man and he offered me a taste of all three meats- Huli Huli Chicken, Pulehu Steak and the instantly famous Kalua Pig. All three are incredibly delicious. 

I ordered a bowl with Seaweed Rice, lettuce, sour cream, cheese and the PIg. Wonderful!!! But not enough. I ordered the same thing to take home. The young man who greeted me asked how I heard of them and I said that Braddah's follows me on twitter. He then said the magic phrase of ""I'm going to give you a free Coconut Bark for following us back"".

The Coconut Bark . . . .  can I properly describe it? A thick layer of salty caramel, a crunchy layer of cracker, a layer of chocolate and topped with finely shredded coconut. So incredibly mouth-wateringly scrumptious, it should have a legal limit attached to it. (Thank goodness it doesn't!!)

I've tried the salad, the tacos and the burrito on other visits. My favorite is the flour burrito with Pig and Steak, black beans, lettuce, cheese and sour cream. I like the Charred Pineapple Verde on the side.

The drive thru is open until 11:00 pm which is great for those of us who want to swing by after work. I've been there half a dozen times already. I just can't get enough.

Now picture yourself at a luau on a beach in Hawaii. Hula dancers shaking their hips. Dudes spinning their fire pole thingy. Ha ha, that's a nice visual. Anyways, all you did was walk into a Braddah's Island Style restaurant. Ok, you can stop the music now. Actually when you go there they really do play Hawaiian music. 

When you come here, your options are simple with 5 easy steps. 

STEP 1. You pick whether you want a Burrito (flour or wheat tortilla), Bowl (bed of seaweed rice), Salad (bed of romaine lettuce), 3 Tacos (soft flour or crispy corn). 

STEP 2. Pick your meats. Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, or just Grilled Veggies. 

STEP 3. Pick your toppings. Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Shredded Cabbage, Romaine Lettuce, and Grilled Veggies (for a charge).

STEP 4. Pick your salsa. Charred Pineapple Verde (mild), Mango and Roasted Corn (medium), Tomato with grilled Maui Onion (spicy).

STEP 5. Pick even more toppings. Sour Cream, Cheese, Lettuce, Jalapenos, Cabbage, Lime, and Guacomole (for an extra charge).

Of course you can put any or all of the toppings on to your entrée selection. I can also describe how all this tastes, but that just wont do it justice. You need to come here and sample their product, which they will happily give to you.

Last but not least, finish it off with Coconut Bark. A salty and sweet concoction that will make your sweet tooth want to jump out of your mouth and make a residence here. This is their only dessert option but honestly, that's all you need.

Chris, the owner who was just behind the counter helping make orders, was also walking around bussing tables and talking to every customer that was there making sure everything was ok. When he came up to me, I had all sorts of questions for him and to my surprise, he answered every one of them sincerely. Things like more promotional menu items like Shrimp and Kalbi Ribs for starters. I was impressed by his honest response to any and all criticism that I had. That's the type of owner I like. One who listens to their customers and takes things to heart. Now if this is how the owner acts, I can only assume all his employees will have the same positive attitude.

Some random info. At the time of this review there is a 20 dollar for 10 Groupon so take full advantage. They have free wifi and the code is on the wall above you when you come in. On Sundays, if you come wearing sandals or flip flops, you get free chips and salsa with your order. They take cards. Their dining room is spacious and equipped with napkins and some kind of good tasting Hawaiin sauce. They have two separate solo bathrooms for men and women.  And lastly, they have a drive thru!

2837569,2014-03-04,7,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"As it's been said a thousand times over, this place is along the lines of a ""Hawaiian Chipotle"" with an assembly line of meats, toppings and sauces that go within a burrito or salad bowl using Hawaiian inspired ingredients, and depending on where you would rank Chipotle in the spectrum of similar restaurants in its class (a solid 3 star pushing towards 3.5 for me), this place also falls within a similar status.  

High points include the friendly staff since we were offered samples of the proteins prior to ordering and the meats themselves are pretty solid in texture and seasoning.  I noticed a one star review where the owner and customer got into a disagreement on whether or not an adult ordering a kids meal was able to receive chips/drink as stated on the menu, and not sure if that was handled properly since if it is not explicitly stated that the kids meal does not include drink/chips if ordered for an adult or that it is reserved for customers less than a certain age, not worth arguing over what is implied or inferred (owner may have won the battle, but lost the war since a potentially loyal customer and future referrals were lost over something trivial, and I doubt this scenario would come up very often since the prices on the regular menu are fairly budget friendly and there is a nice yelp deal available as well).

I was initially leaning towards rounding this to 4 stars due to the fact that I like the concept and I'm always in support of local businesses, but with the ratings already a bit inflated and if I were to rate it honestly in terms of flavor, it's not quite there yet.  Everything on the menu seems to read better than they taste including the salsas and the little bottled sauces which were seemingly watered down and my palate was struggling to find them with each bite, even after applying them directly onto an individual bite.  Hawaiian food is all about bright and bold flavors with contrasting textures and colors, and I felt like it was Chipotle with a mere Hawaiian twist whereas I'd rather be commenting that this was like Hawaiian food served in the style and accessibility of Chipotle.  Perhaps since they are a budding new business, ingredients need to be kept within a certain budget, but I hope to see them expand to have more interesting options such as poke, opakapaka, korean short -ribs, or spam as additional protein options in the form of nachos or their burritos/bowls, and something with a wasabi or taro element since those are all popular flavors from the island.  I didn't get a chance to try the well-reviewed coconut bark, but I don't think it would be too difficult to imagine coconut, chocolate, and buttery toffee to be a winning combination.  

If the owner is keeping up reading these reviews, you should feel proud that so many locals are supporting your product with 4-5 star reviews and building a local following, but I hope you're continuing to strive to improve and showcase your passion and homage to Hawaiian food and I hope to return at some point to dole out a few more stars.

On more than one occasion my boyfriend will order the burrito from here and there is one particular individual who puts the burrito together and wraps it terribly. I don't know about you guys but when I get a burrito I would like all the fillings to be in every bite. I don't expect perfection because burritos are just amazing but imagine only getting a mouthful of rice or worse eating half of your burrito and realizing that there is no more meat for the other half of your burrito because it was all on one side of the burrito. 

Something else.... I know avocados are expensive but if you are going to charge me $2.50 for guacamole please don't give me the smallest amount of guacamole you possibly can. I had to order extra guacamole on the side even then they didn't even fill the small container up. They did at first then scooped the guacamole out so it was more hollow in the center. Maybe I'm just used to Chipotle and expect the whole container to be full. 

Hear our plea, Braddahs! We love you and love your food. The atmosphere and the food are what keeps us coming back. But for those who are interested the location on Maryland parkway is amazing and very consistent.

Ordered a steak bowl, given in penitentiary-style bowls that tasted disgusting. States it is Island Style cuisine which is nothing but a bunch of white people pretending to be Islanders. When I went to pay after making the bowl, the front register knockoff iPad crashed after sliding my card. So the staff member took my card in the back in the back to charge using that register. Who knows how many time she slid my card because it ended up charging me over and over again. I  Ordered one shitty steak bowl and they charged me over and over again. Called the restaurant up to ask why and was basically told to fuck off by the 'founder' Christopher. He was so aggressive and completely blamed it on my bank even though he admitted the front register freezes up lately. He took no responsibility that this could have been his fault before putting the blame on the customer and their bank. Do not go through the headache of eating at this place.

...And YES. My Groupon was actually valued at $5.50 because it had expired.
Originally the restaurant was offering Groupons valued at $5.50 for $12.00 worth of food, but it appears now the restaurant has become a little more greedy offering their Groupon customers a lesser deal at $7.50 for $12.00 worth of food. What else should I expect?

Checked my bookmarks for something unique near me.  I saw Braddah's was only .5 miles away - sweet been wanting to try this place for some time.  
    We walked in and the manager could tell right away it was our first time.  He asked and we admitted yes we had never been to a Braddah's.  He let us taste the pork, beef and chicken along with the coconut bark.  They all tasted great now just had to figure out what we wanted.  Since all the meats tasted so good we got the 3 taco combo with the each of the meats on them.  Added guacamole to our 3 orders which was a very generous amount by the way. We also got the salad with chicken and a pound of that delicious coconut bark.  
   We were getting this to go as the wife was home waiting.  I did note the inside was really nice and kept clean.  It was near empty inside which was hard to believe.  The staff was excellent and ensured we got exactly what we wanted the way we wanted it.  The manger was really nice and even asked us what brought us in.  I of course said Yelp of which he was curious as to what on Yelp made us want to visit.  I explained that I look at reviews and pay much closer attention to reviews by my friends whom I know to be foodies and trust their opinions.  The daughter said pics are what she mostly looks for in deciding what to eat - millennials they are so funny.  
   The tacos were all very good.  The meat in each was week spiced, tender  and unique.  The taco shell was homemade and very delicious.  We had beans, rice, lettuce, pineapple verde and guacamole.  I devoured mine as if someone were going to steal them.  I must say they were the unique treat i wanted them to be.  The salad was on the small side and lettuce was very minimal.  It did have lots of the same goodies as the tacos but should have more lettuce.  I added some romaine and it was a much better balanced salad.  
   The coconut bark is as good as everyone says in their reviews.  I loved it and may have to hide a stash from my girls.  Their prices are very reasonable and when getting the tacos it is a great deal.  If your get the salad you will be left wondering - where is my lettuce.  Hopefully they remedy that soon.

We tasted each meat before we picked our order: the chicken was so much like a teriyaki chicken, the pork was awesome: juicy and tender. We had burrito bowls. However, once you had all the ingredients in the bowl, it just came out so under seasoned. Even their salsa were under seasoned not packed with flavors. I asked for 2 additional cups of salsa and a pinch of salt to make my bowl become ok. 

I can see the place become something awesome though..",N0y70IgvQ8XLvEVyrBaFHA,0,0,3,KYuclcxc07XLkbF5DfcDGg

From the time I walked in, I was greeted in a friendly manner by the staff and promptly asked if I had been there before. I haven't previously, and I was given a sample along with my friends to try their various meats. Honestly, when I tried all of the various meats, they were all so delicious... I had the hardest time deciding between the steak, chicken, and pork and I just decided on getting the chicken and steak, but the pork will have its turn in the future!

The ordering style is identical to Chipotle. If you haven't been to a Chipotle, what you essentially do is tell the first person what kind of dish you want along with your meat. You'll go along the line and say what items you want and don't want on your dish. At the end of the line, you and the people making your dish have made your masterpiece! Just a reminder, just like Chipotle, if you get a burrito bowl, you can get tortillas on the side, which is a definite plus in my book. It seems like you can't pile it up as high as Chipotle, but the food is still nonetheless delicious.

The guacamole was great, but the chips were served cold, although they were served in a paper bag with the grease coming through, giving the illusion they were going to be hot and greasy.

I purchased a $10 for $20 groupon so we could try this place out for dinner. Upon walking in we were greeted and right away offered a sample of their Huli Huli Chicken and Kalua Pig. Both of these were equally good, but I really loved the Huli Huli Chicken. After reading the menu board I decided to go with the ""3 Tacos"" with 2 on flour tortillas and 1 on crispy corn. I was torn on which meat to choose for my tacos, so the man behind the counter said I could mix and match them. Cool! I ended up going with chicken, pig and steak tacos and paying the extra $1.35 for guac on them. A lot of places would charge for the guacamole per taco, but I was just charged the 1 price and got a generous portion on all 3 tacos. The tacos were delicious! The charred pineapple verde adds a nice flavor addition, the meat is tender and has great flavor, the tortilla was soft and good and the price was right for what I got. The guacamole is worth buying just as a side to have with chips, but I have to admit that if there was some sort of Hawaiian pink salt in it, I didn't see it or taste anything except for fresh yummy guac. Hubby had a ""Pulehu Steak Burrito"" and loved it, but found the size to be too small for his hungry appetite. I still had half of a taco left so I was very fulfilled! So full that I didn't even taste a bite of the ""Cheese Quesadilla"" priced at $2.50 (meat extra) that we also ordered. 

I also had to make room for dessert later because I got a bag of ""Coconut Bark"" priced at $3.50 to try. Whoa!! This stuff is addicting! I have never had anything like it before and honestly don't even know for sure what all was in it. It seems like a saltine cracker with a layer of brown sugar or caramel and then a layer of chocolate and coconut. Whatever it is, I want more!

They even gave me a free sample of their dessert, which was not really good. It was a weird blend of chocolate and coconut (don't get me wrong, I  like both of those things!).

The Staff is very friendly, and the food portions are generous. The style is similar to chipotle, or Zaba's Mexican Grill as you go down the line and pick your food options.

Chicken, steak, and fish are also up for grabs.  

Finally, you can toss some sauces on the food to add some extra kick. I tried a raspberry hotsauce, and a pinapple jalapeno sauce.

3675253,2013-11-12,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Good island style grubs.  I opted to try out the 3 taco meal on my first go at Braddah's.  For my three choices I picked the veggie, chicken, and fish options and had them put pretty much all the ""fixins"" on it.  I was excited to try out the maui onion they offered and it wasn't quite as good as I wanted it to be as I didn't taste the flavor I've come to know and love.  But, I looked past it and settled on the flavors of the veggies, chicken, and fish contents; the chicken being the best out of the three.  It's not very often that you find huli huli style chicken here in LV (unless I'm not looking hard enough, which wouldn't really surprise me), so it was a nice flavor to re-visit after being out of the islands for a while.  The fish was also quite grubbin' but I found that the guac and sour cream overpowered the taste of the fish and I couldn't fully enjoy it.  I'll put it down as a mental note to try guac and sour cream on my tacos next time.  Got to try some of the prized coconut bark and it is as good as they say it is (and I'm not much of a dessert guy so that's saying a lot).  If I had to describe it, the coconut bark is just like a Twix bar with a healthy infusion of coconut flavor and texture.  Try it out, I'm sure you won't regret it.

Overall, Braddah's Island Style is a good grub option when you're hungry and jonesin' for a little bit of island flavor.  Braddah's style is reminiscent of back home but it doesn't quite hit the mark.  However, that is definitely not a bad thing as it is tasty and I enjoyed the lunch experience I had while visiting.  A Hawaiian-style Chipotle they say?  Pretty much a spot on description.  A solid effort from a promising spot.  I'll be sure to stop by if I'm ever in the area and looking to eat something 'ono.

I'm a fan of Chipotle and a bigger fan of Hawaiian-style meats, so what better than combining the 2 together! 

The staff was very friendly.. we were given samples of the Huli-Huli Chicken and Kalua Pork. I decided to go with a Huli-Huli Chicken bowl with seaweed rice, black beans, pineapple verde, lettuce and cheese. The chicken by itself was excellent with its sour marinate.. but loses its flavor when mixed in the bowl. It just seemed a little dry, like it was missing some sauces maybe?.. probably my fault for not adding more. 
I actually wouldn't mind just the chicken and seaweed rice.

I definitely want to give this place another try and hopefully make a better combination.",xpaIV92-DStPlBjyfITZqA,3,3,3,Wzlpye3QbFI2KiPAczDzsQ

It didn't have the typical ""rough around the edges"" family owned business type of feel so I was already impressed. Right upon walking in they offer to give me samples of the different meats, I was initially going to have the pork since it's their signature but after tasting the samples I opted for the chicken instead because I liked the flavor more. Just from that gesture the service was already off to a good start. The chicken was Teriyaki but not so strong of a flavor which is good so you can taste the other elements in your burrito or bowl. I must say since I frequently eat at Chipotle I am accustomed to their portion sizes and Braddah's is slightly smaller, almost to the point I would need to order a side. I was given a free sample of dessert which is what they call ""coconut bark"" and I absolutely loved it. It was like a gram cracker (not really sure) covered with chocolate and coconut flakes. I would actually come here just to have this. While eating I noticed the owner was doing some accounting paperwork at another table, usually owners of new businesses greet diners while eating and I guess he was too consumed into what he was doing?

I usually get the salad bowl, they always give dressing with it but u don't need it if you're adding salsa and all the other add-ons. I recently just tried the salad dressing and if skip it! Tasted funny. And I always get the spicy salsa with Maui onion, I tried the mango salsa and it was disappointing just bland. The coconut bark is worth a try to see if you like it but the price is pretty steep for the size ($4 for a tiny box with about 3 small pieces) a $1 candy bar at the store might be a better deal lol but overall a good place to go.

3988074,2013-09-20,5,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Recently tried Braddah's Island style for lunch with my wife. All i can say is fantastic food!!. Located on Rainbow and Sahara next to McDonalds. Why so many people stuff down nasty Mickey D's when all this fresh goodness is right next door for the same price is beyond me.
The building is very tastefully done. Nice seating area on the patio outside, and very bright and inviting on the inside. I love the old airline posters of Hawaii hanging on the wall, and the old Elvis music was relaxing just like you were in Hawaii for real . We were very warmly greeted by the employees with a friendly Aloha. Forgive me that i forgot to get any of their names, but they were all so friendly. What a nice change of pace to have such nice customer service. Since it was our first time, they offered us free samples of the Kalua Pork and the Huli Huli chicken. both delicious and full of flavor.
The ordering line is basically set up like a Chipotle if you are familiar with them.
FIRST: pick from either a burrito, rice bowl, or 3 taco option.
SECOND: pick you're meat. Kalua Pig, Huli Huli Chicken, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Veggies or Grilled Fish.
THIRD: Pick your toppings: Black Beans, Grilled veggies with green onions, Seaweed rice, lettuce, cabbage etc.
FOURTH: Salsa Time: Charred Pineapple Verde(very mild,) Mango and Roasted Corn (delicious) and Tomato with Grilled Maui Onion. (Medium).
LAST STEP: a few additional toppings such as cheese, sour cream, guacamole, jalapeno's, limes.
NOTE: additional toppings do cost extra, so keep that in mind when building your meal.

My wife ended up getting the rice bowl, which was a really good size portion. She paired that with Huli Huli Chicken which is so delicious. She put on various toppings such as lettuce, cheese, and got the Salsas in a couple of small containers so she could put the right amount on herself. I can't remember what else she got because i was so involved with my order. Total tunnel vision lol. I went with the 3 taco option so i could try a few of the meats. I opted for the soft shell and got the Kalua Pig, Huli Huli Chicken, and The Pulehu steak. The Chicken is grilled and flavorful, the Pig is declious and juicy, and the Steak has a sort of sweet unique flavor like i have never had. i loaded them up so much, she could barely fold the tortilla. The food is flat out delicious and above all so very fresh, like you would make at home if you knew how lol. And whatever you do, don't forget the coconut bark for dessert. A sort of Hawaiian smore's concoction?? I don't know but it was ridunkulessly good. Nice piece of chocolate with shaved coconut on top, kind of a graham cracker?? in the middle and a salty caramel bottom. The salty evens out the sweet chocolate, and will turn you immediately into a crack-head for this stuff wanting to take a couple pounds home to stash for later.

Overall can't say enough good things about this new restaurant. Excellent food, customer service, and ambience. We will be back again for sure!!. give it a try, and you will be so glad you did!!!! Mahalo and Aloha",0grZ4N1UYPZmRvv3lXJuJA,5,5,5,qPvhBD6iSN4L2Rv2ZqcE7g

Everyone is super nice at this restaurant and that in itself sets them apart from many restaurants in Vegas.

1 star = Quick assembly line, and every one behind the glass is super nice and friendly. What a great way to start a meal!

2 stars = The owner introduced himself, let us try some meats, and made sure we were enjoying our meal! Now that's how you handle business and return customers!

3 stars = Kalua pig flavor = bombtastic. Explodes in your mouth with flavor and does not taste anything like a fast food staple. 

4 stars = COCONUT BARK = to die for. I wish this restaurant was closer to home so I can always have a refill on my coconut bark. They are $3.50 a bag but so worth it and it comes with a lot. But definitely hate to share, so get your own! Haha!

Lacks the 5th star only because my tacos and fiance's burrito was tearing apart as we were eating them. Must be the strategy in wrapping and filling that needs to be worked on as the restaurant is fairly new. But all in all, great place for fast food, chipotle Hawaiian style goodness!

4014484,2013-10-01,3,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Yes, yes, it is kinda like the Hawaiian Chipotle!  But the flavors at Braddah's are definitely unique and local to the Islands!  Me likey!

The family and I went for dinner one weekend night and were greeted with cheery employees!  We were asked if we had been to Braddah's before, then given a nice sample of their kalua pig.  Really like home!  So needless to say we stayed for a meal.

Braddah's concept is almost identical to that of Chipotle's with their food-building line.  You start at one end and place your order, and along the way down the counter you choose what you want in your entree.  Menu items are very similar to Chipotle's as well, simple and easy to comprehend.  But with more Hawaii flavor infused into the menu.  

Choose from your menu staples of burritos, bowls, salads, or tacos.  Then you go down each station to choose your protein, rice and/or beans, salsa, dressing (if you have a salad), and fresh fixing choices.  Then it all gets wrapped up or placed on real plates!  Kind of a nice touch, since it gives you that homey-type feel.  Of course you can get it to go if you need to.

For proteins you can choose from:
-Kalua pig (damn yummy like out of the IMU)
-Pulehu steak
-Huli Huli chicken
-Grilled fish
-Grilled veggies

You have a choice of black or pinto beans, and the rice has either nori or furikake in it which is pretty good.  Hot rice, furikake, and shoyu...a meal in itself!

For salsa choices you get:
-Charred pineapple verde
-Mango & roasted corn
-Tomato with grilled Maui onion (LIKE since I'm from Maui)

Dressings make for salads include a papaya buttermilk ranch, and a roasted sesame gingerette.

Fresh fixing items to include with your order:
-Sour cream
-Romaine
-Cheese
-Cilantro
-Cabbage (great with grilled fish)
-Jalapeno
-Guacamole with pink Hawaiian salt (for a small fee)

Tons of flavor combinations!  Like a hula dancer in your mouth!  Hmm...that worked out better in my head then on paper.  I had a burrito with Huli Huli chicken, pineapple verde, tomato with grilled Maui onion salsa, sour cream, cheese, and extra romaine.  I thought it would be too much for the chicken to come through but POW!  That Huli Huli chicken tasted exactly like I remember from my 'hana bada' days (that's kiddie time to you non-locals).  Sweet, salty, tangy, just damn delicious.  Very good burrito, made even better with the Pickapepper hot sauce they get from Jamaica!  That sweet and heat flavor added some good kick to my palette.  I would eat jars of that stuff.

We also had a kalua pig burrito too and it was pretty stellar as well.  That smokey flavor of the pork complimented the rest of the ingredients nicely.  Good stuff.  Fish tacos were ono too, very comparable to the ones at a place like Wahoo's.  Fresh.

The only complaint I have about Braddah's is sometimes the servings can be a tad on the 'keiki' side.  Especially with the bowls and salads.  Please, most of us people from Hawaii are big!  I'm a big boy!  I want a big boy serving!  I can understand how food costs rise constantly.  I only suggest you put a bit more lettuce and rice/beans when you guys make a salad or bowl.  Tastes good, just want more!  So please, maybe pile over the top of the bowl!

Since it was our first time to Braddah's we were given samples of their only dessert, coconut bark.  Shiz...this stuff is like CRACK!  I don't even like sweets!  Sweet, silky, crunchy, coco-nutty all at the same time.  Tasty explosion!  No wonder it won 'Best Dessert' at this past year's Bite of Las Vegas, well deserved.  If you like spicy, add a dash of that Pickapepper hot sauce on top (I kid you not), and be amazed.  Super yum-yum.

I bought a Groupon for Braddah's so I will be back again sometime soon.  I thought the drive was a bit far for us so we would wait a bit.  Come to find out, another Braddah's location will be opening soon closer to us at Centennial in the NW!  Will probably be back much sooner now.

4053223,2013-11-29,7,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Reading all these reviews, I couldn't help but think ""what's a Hawaiian Chipotle?"".  Well, I finally got to find out for myself.  Yes, when you walk in it's almost like Chipotle.  Your meals are made in an assembly line fashion, it's fast food, and the prices are similar.  

The process is simple...select your meats (Kalua Pork, Steak, Huli Huli Chicken, Veggies, Fish, or Shrimp).  Then choose whether you want your meats in a bowl with rice, in a salad, a burrito, and even a taco.  Then after this, you select all the extras like sour creams, beans, guac, etc.  For me, my decision was easy.  I wasn't feeling a burrito or taco.  I also wasn't doing a salad or rice bowl. So, I chose just a side of steak and a side of chicken.  I thought both meats were a bit greasy and lacking some flavor.  I know Chipotle isn't any better when it comes to grease, but at least there's a little taste there.  I still managed to down my dish because I don't believe in quitting.  My gf got steak with rice and beans. She also had to get their coconut bark.  Might as well, especially since they're known for it.  I had a piece and thought that it was pretty good.  It's pretty much a toffee tasting, Almond Roca tasting, sweet piece of candy.  That one piece was probably the highlight.  

My gf had a $20 Groupon for our meals and we were originally sticker shocked that just two bowls, 2 drinks, and coconut bark was over $22.  Something just didn't add up.  When I got home, I realized why.  Instead of Braddah's charging me for a side of chicken and a side of steak, they charged me for a full bowl.  Yeah, we were over-charged about $2.  I'm not going broke because of this, but it's the principle.  

Overall, with a recent 5 Star ROTD for Braddah's and some of the hype I'm seeing, I have to say that I was a little disappointed.  The thought of Hawaiian food mixed with tacos and burritos sounded great.  But when it came down to it...they are just A-OK

PS:  At least the restaurant is clean and there's a drive thru.

The kalua pork is my favorite. I also love the charred pineapple verde salsa. So much yum. I made sure not to forget the coconut bark this time, and I was not disappointed. It's a chocolate salty caramel treat with a bit of crunch in the middle. Very rich, and a little goes a long way. Don't forget about the ""hot"" sauces! 

I love this place! And so does my picky daughter. Awesome restaurant! Oh, I almost forgot to mention the super friendly service. All of the staff are pleasant and helpful. Great find. :)",GmzwysGSE-gh0-RgG1_QNA,1,0,5,DZkLFGGcrLrHmGx14-fk7Q
4087241,2014-10-25,1,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Interesting place....

Stopped in here for lunch and was immediately greeted and asked if I wanted samples of the meats. I accepted and at first thought, ""Meh, it's okay...""  

I did a three taco plate and decided to try one of each (chicken, pork and steak). It works kinda like chipotle where you pick if you want rice, beans, etc now we get to the salsa picking - I don't remember the specific names of them but I had the verde with the steak and pork and had the corn salsa with the chicken. The pork was still ""meh"" but those salsas transformed the steak and chicken into something really tasty!  I was very surprised actually that the combination of flavors vs. just the meat tasting was so different.  Later, the perhaps owner or manager came by to ask how things were going and plopped another salsa on my table and said to try it.  Very complimenting as well.  So, food is very good I would say.

Now, why I gave it three stars in lieu of four - the place was only 1/3rd full but almost every table needed to be bussed so finding a suitable clean table to sit at made me choose a less desire able spot (small table in the sun for a semi big guy with an ipad, napkin dispenser, little sign and food on a tray to share all the same spot).  The salsa plopped down while having great flavor was sticky on the outside of the bottle and I hate sticky fingers etc.  So, I would have probably given 3 1/2 stars in lieu of 3 if these dynamics were different - however, not the end of the world.

One other thing worth mentioning, although I got one of each style of taco to make my three taco plate, the 3 steak tacos are like a buck more than the chicken or pork and I got charged for 3 steak ones.  I'm not sure how else they would have done that anyway since they don't have an option for one of each, so I'm ok with it - just be prepared if you go that route.  Also, since we're mentioning price, I came back a second time about a week later an didn't get the guac add on a second time around because I thought the charge for it was a bit hefty at $1.65 or so.  I made a big mistake not getting it as the difference was notable in the flavors I remembered from the week before.  So, cough up the dough and get the guac!

Overall, a nice spot that I would go to again.",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,1,0,3,o2YD1XHTTNHQeNz6cPZD8g

The set-up is taken right out of the Chipotle playbook, & why not, it's a great formula! We made sure to sample the meats that they had available especially since the guys are sensitive to spices. My Huz and oldest son had such a difficult time deciding between the Kahlua pig and the chicken, they went ahead & just got the mix in their burrito! I chose the chicken on a salad base & asked the counter server for suggestions on toppings. She was so friendly and my salad looked amazing & tasted just as well. My 9 year old stuck to a simple chicken burrito with beans & rice.  Like I said, the set-up is much like a beloved franchise, but it had a flare of its own. I felt like I was dining among the locals.

4107197,2013-11-12,1,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Braddah's reminds me so much of a popular chain that lots of people enjoy. Can you guess what it is?

Yep, it's Earl of Sandwich. They totally have the same font all over the menu! If that was your guess, great job.

I'm going to go against the grain and highlight what happened at the end of my meal here. After finishing my excellent food, I saw this purple and white ribbon pinned to the menu. I asked the manager (owner?) about it, and he quite proudly shared with me that it was for winning best dessert at the Bite of Las Vegas. He even boasted that they beat out all those fancy chefs who ""went to school"" to learn to make dessert.

Loathe to let a great opportunity slip, I stepped up to the register and ordered the coconut bark. Wow. I'm not normally a coconut fan, but this wasn't overtly coconut-y. There's coconut shavings on a hard chocolate layer, then a middle white layer which was more likely coconut as well, and a salted soft caramel layer at the bottom. It's pretty dang sweet, which is too my liking, and isn't too hard to crunch through. Only problem is that I only bought one box and there's very few pieces of this deliciousness. After eating a chunk just now, I only have one piece left for another day.

By the way, the non-dessert menu is also worth coming here for. I had three tacos, and following the excellent idea of Christie L., I got to try three meats (huli huli chicken, kalua pork, pulehu steak), plus three different salsas. I'd probably go for pork or steak (just like at the other fresh burritos places) and definitely stick to the mango and corn salsa, but the pineapple verde and tomato with Maui onion options aren't bad. They also have two hot sauces available at bottles at the tables. You know I'm kinda a fan of sweet, and I found myself augmenting my tacos with quite a bit of the raspberry and jalapeno sauce. The unlabeled guava sauce was a little too hot for my delicate taste buds unfortunately.

Overall, this is an excellent 4.5 star concept that the coconut bark certainly bumped up to an unquestionable 5. You will love Braddah's if you enjoy either or both of Hawaiian food and the fresh burrito concept. Hopefully, they'll stick to their goal of opening a Henderson location soon so that I can enjoy their food after a much shorter drive.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,3,5,K0spP1k8YqImbNAoAhYIBg

It all started with a Groupon and then it became an addiction.  This place is so close to my house 15 minutes max I can easily talk the man out of a home cooked meal for this any night of the week!  Yay for me for a night off! 

They have tons of great options all of what has been listed in the past.  We like the Whole Wheat Burrito with Seaweed Rice, we like the Kalua Pig.  We each like different sides but both love the Mango, Pineapple, Habanero sauce.  (they only give one per burrito so use it wisely)  This burrito is large and will give me 2 meals easy, I don't eat large meals but anyone could have leftovers!

I drive into this place and Mc Ds drive thru is long and sometime this place is low in customers.  I don't understand why someone would choose horrible processed food that you don't even know what is in it, over really good fresh food?!  Come on peeps choose better...

4147537,2014-03-20,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Yea!  I finally tried Braddah's Island Style.  And I so wish I could like it as much as four stars but I'm not sure that I do.  I'm really on the fence with this one.  Lets start with the positives.  Upon entering I was offered a nice Hawaiian style welcoming into the restaurant.  Mahalo to them for that.  I was asked if it was my first visit and I said yes.  With that I was offered a sample of the kalua pig and huli huli chicken.  Both were very good though I don't always care for pork.  This was on the oily side but still had a great initial flavor.  It is the porky after taste I don't care for.  The chicken on the other hand was a stand out with a sort of sweet and salty taste with a hint of grill char.  So I selected the huli huli chicken to fill my burrito.  When I ordered a burrito I was disappointed to see a generic Mission brand flour tortilla pulled out of the bag.  I mean seriously $7 for a burrito in an 8 inch tortilla?  It turns out they ran out of their usual jumbo tortillas.  So alright, I'll let this one slide.  Next came a very carefully measured spoon of seaweed rice (awesome flavor BTW) and an equally measured spoon of chicken.  It was a new guy making my order and he was being very cautious to the point of me feeling like I was getting ripped off.  But with the addition of the black beans, two kinds of salsa (roasted pine apple and corn varieties) and some shredded cheese I realized just how much was packed into this little tortilla.  There was so much in fact that it could not be fully rolled.  One of the burrito veterans came over for the assist and rolled an extra tortilla around the first and got a nice tightly tucked buritto.  When I reached the register I ordered a can of Hawaiian green tea and was asked if I wanted coconut bark.  I declined the bark as I don't even know what it is.  Not that it matters.  I am not a coconut fan any how.  So I paid and found a table in the corner and took my first bite of an Island Style burrito and honeslty I was not blown away.  Beneath the rice, beans and salsa the flavor of the chicken was lost.  I'm not saying it was a bad burrito but all together it lacked something.  The salsa could have been hotter.  I realize that I got the mild and medium salsas but there just wasn't much to them.  Mostly what I could taste in the burrito was the seaweed rice.  I do love the taste of seaweed so that was nice but overall it was nothing special.  My other issue is the limited menu.  They specialize in burritos, tacos, salads and bowls.  They also seem to have chips and guacamole.  What I really wish they had is musubi but I guess that doesn't quite fit their business model.  I think I will give them another try some time.  Perhaps I'll try another protien other than chicken.  It is my understanding they have steak and fish too though neither were offered as a sample.  I would like to give the steak a try though.  Perhaps I will appreciate the steak more than the chicken and bump up Braddah's to the four stars I know I want to give them.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,0,3,BSKBHsZdF4SQxJki5TwKMg

I went in with my good friend and we were excited to try a place as similar to Chipotle as we could find. Upon entering we were greeted with the extremely friendly Hawaiian vibe that people travel to Hawaii for. 

As we were reading the menu and continued to ask questions about what to get and what the options were, she offered us samples of EVERYTHING. The fish was my favorite, which I have gotten time and time again. She told us the different flavored salsa's that they had, mango pic de gayo and such. I don't remember the names, but the green is a delightfully sweet and sour blend added to your dish. 

I got the bowl, which is twice what they give at chipotle, my friend got the burrito and was not disappointed. Burrito stuffed and bowl overflowing, a food lover hearts dream. The flavors that exploded when we took our first bites made us instant fan-girls of Braddah's. We have been back twice a month since April! And will continue to come back this frequently. 

Now to the whole reason we spend so much money at this place. The coconut bark. My life completed it's journey when I took the first bite.

I opted for the bowl with the chicken. He then proceeded to ask what I wanted my bowl to consist of. SO MANY OPTIONS. My bowl had the seaweed rice (so good), chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, pineapple salsa, sour cream and jalapenos. Portions are huge so it's a good thing I came hungry. I docked them a star because when he scooped the tomatoes into my bowl, he didn't strain them first. So by the time I was at the bottom of the bowl, there was a puddle of tomato water. Not so appealing when your food is drenched in it. At that point I couldn't eat any more of it. Otherwise, the bowl was pretty tasty. Chicken was bursting with flavor, the seaweed in the rice was an extra treat and the pineapple salsa was outstanding.

4287683,2015-08-12,7,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Ok, I have been here a few times and have really only had one good experience and that was when it first opened up 2 years ago or so. I came here about a month ago and I noticed the little areas around been here a few times and have really only have 1 good experience and that was when its first opened up 2 years ago or so. I came here about a month ago and I noticed the little areas around the counter area had dried on disgusting grease. I was super appalled, and felt super bad because there were only two girls working at the time. That visit I saw the meats that were offered, and the girl offered to give me a sample of each. The beef definitely had been sitting there for at least an hour because it was now basically carmelized meat. The chicken was super dry and there wasn't but a spoonful left. And the pork was blah. 

Fast forward to today, it was around 6:30 pm and we went in to order dinner. The place was dead, just like it was the last time we went in, but this time there were three girls working. Once again I go to the counter and see it's still disgusting and dirty right by where they keep the plates and bowls and I'm assuming it's a microwave or something. So I ordered the kids chicken bowl and a half pound box of the bark. Again the beef and the chicken look like they had been sitting there for at least an hour, the fish was also uncovered and there were flies around the food. I decided to go with the brown rice with the chicken for my kids bowl. When she actually gave me the scoop of chicken it was pitiful, then she put on some cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, sour cream, and some cilantro that looked like it had been there for at least 2 hours. When she rang me up the total came out to 17 dollars and change, I asked her why the price was that much, and she said the child's bowl was $5.95. Now I don't mind paying $5.95 for a kids meal, but I want to pay that much for a meal, not a tiny ass rice bowl. I didn't have it in my heart to tell her I did not want it after all, because it was already made, and I was already getting irritated. When I asked the price breakdown of the $5.95 she said the bowl itself  is $3.95, and to add the chicken it's an additional $2. Now that 2 dollars would have been fine if it was a large heaping scoop of chicken that hadn't been sitting there for the majority of the evening. But this was not that, this was a half of a scoop of dried up funky ass chicken. I hadn't really paid attention to the size of the bowl so I paid for my food and left. 

Upon getting home I became even more irritated! I could literally almost wrap my entire hand around the $5.95 ""bowl"" that I bought. Keep in mind, this $5.95 price tag does not include any drink or chips or anything else. It's just a small ass bowl. I get that it's a childs portion; but I wouldn't even call it a bowl its more like a soap dish full of rice. And, a regular sized bowl is only $1 which I failed to notice until the end!

I don't think I will be returning, I've come here a few times, but things have just steadily gone downhill. This is not a Chipotle of any type! Chipotle is not this disgusting, nor has their food ever sat for over 30 minutes marinating in its own grease. So please stop comparing it to that, because it's definitely, definitely not that. I really think that they need to reevaluate the pricing, because for what you pay you can literally go and buy yourself a meal at another place and have fresh delicious food. In fact I had to go next door to stupid McDonalds just to purchase a side of french fries for that child's bowl accompaniment. They were extremely fresh and hot and even though extra fattening, they were delicious. 

I guess instead of complaining of the shit food, I'm gonna practice what I preach and go elsewhere.

I LOVE Braddah's because all their food is made fresh daily (and I do mean everything). You can customize your burrito, taco, and salad bowl the way you like it. Everyone is just so darn friendly that works there you want to stick around long after you consumed your meal. 

Minh and I arrived here on a late Thursday afternoon for some lunch. We were looking to stick to the healthy side of things. 

Walking in we were greeted immediately by not only the girl behind the counter but also by the owner Chris. We were asked if we have been to Braddah's before we both said no. The lovely cashier then explained to us their menu and gave us a sample of two of their popular meats (Huli Huli Chicken and Kalua Pig) wow the flavors were mouth watering making me want more! But how can I choose! So instead of ordering their ""popular"" meats I decided on trying their Pulehu Steak (which I think should be on their sample list too). Chris was so kind that he stopped what he was doing and came over to make my bowl (which I did not expect) 

I ordered a salad bowl: Pulehu Steak, Black Beans, Romaine Lettuce, Cheese, Lime, and Guacamole. There are also three kinds of homemade salsa to choice from since I did not know which one to choose Chris gave me a little of each in my bowl to try. (I loved all three of them)

We also ordered their Award Winning box of coconut bark to take home with us.

The dining room was super clean and every table was well stock with napkins. On each table, they have flowers, which is a nice touch and made my photo taking even better. 

I can't tell you enough times how amazing and flavorful my bowl was, I also can't tell you how happy Minh was with his food either! This is one of the best gem's Vegas has and I am a little jealous that we do not have a location out here in OC.
I was full, but not that overly full feeling that you usually have after eating umm let's say cough chipotle cough. I even had enough room to break open that box of sweet coconut bark.

Oh tasty sticky gooey slice of heaven where have you been all my life? Minh and I both had a slice and then decided to save the rest for later that night!

Yes this place is chipotle STYLE.... But 100 times better. And just in case all you yelpers didn't know... Chipotle was previously a subsidiary of McDonald's. Last time I checked McDonald's isn't usually the healthiest choice out there. 

Honestly I come here at least once a week. I can't say enough good things about this place. My 2 year old son doesn't like meat. But every time we get the fish from braddahs he eats it all!! And some!! Food is always fresh, the staff is always friendly, portions are always large and the price is reasonable. I've been going here religiously for over a year now. Chipotle has never tasted the same.


For those who say the food is greasy here.... You probably got the pig. Which is not greasy but fatty. Because it's PORK. And it's slow cooked. 




The coconut bark is amazing. Seriously. Get a box and you won't be able to stop eating it.",X-afiw22M_9o4jP6WeA92w,1,1,5,5fc0MXdbt-5bF88CtUoXuA

Their food is so good, you'll want to go back that same day for another meal. The chicken is so juicy and tender, and while the pig can be a little salty, it's another option that's hard to pass up. 

When you go, you must do two things -- order some of the coconut bark and try their signature sauces (bottled and available for free use in the dining room). The coconut bark is AMAAAAAZING, and may actually result in addiction. The sauces are the same way, and all are unique and a tasty addition to your food. My personal favorites are the white pearl sauce and the raspberry one. You can buy them to bring home, too!

There's really not much else to say. They give samples, they are friendly, the steak was so flavorful, the corn and tomato toppings were so good.

4451702,2015-01-21,1,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Braddah's Island Style is often referred to as the ""Hawaiian Chipotle"". While agree that the process and ordering is the same, the food here is not comparable to Chipotle, because it is very different. The meats are different because they are marinated in different sauces - in fact, when I order steak and chicken at Chipotle, there's no marination going on. Also, toppings are different, especially their choice of salsas, which are very different from your typical mild, medium, and hot at Chipotle.

I could go on comparing the two, but I should really get on with what is GOOD about Braddah's, and what makes them STAND OUT as a fast food chain, and not necessarily another ""Chipotle"" (also remember there is Zaba's and Qdoba...). 

I've had the Huli Huli Chicken and the Pulehu Steak - I prefer the Chicken. The steak, while good, was too much on the sweet side for me. I've had bowls, tacos, and burritos from Braddah's. All of them are very good.

Salsas are the main stars, in my opinion. Giving you options to choose from mild to hot - each of the salsas are good in their own way - charred pineapple verde gives some sweetness because of the pineapple, mango and roasted corn give a hearty flavor with extra oomph from the corn kernels, and tomato with grilled Maui onions is my favorite because it gives you the HEAT.

Not to be left out is the coconut bark - a delicious sweet/salty/crunchy/smooth dessert. It's one of those creations that is on-par with Cheetohs, because Cheetohs are so wonderful - crunchy, cheesy, pleasing - same goes for coconut bark, it gives you so many feels, smells, and tastes you're left wondering how you could have been living without having had it.

Service on the night I went to this particular location was SLOW. I felt as though service could have been picked up a bit, but other than that I have no complaints. The food is totally worth the price points. When I crave Chipotle I will go to Chipotle, but if I want something different - I will come here.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,1,4,JaPwYjAA6oe8ka6BooxhCg

Until walking in the place was pretty dead, only about one table occupied and one other couple in line ordering. It's set up as sort of a chipotle ordering style with different meat, veggies and topping choices that are added on in front of you as you go. The employees were all very helpful with answering questions and making recommendations. 

As the food goes we both ended up getting the crispy corn tacos. We each did one pig, one chicken and one beef. Personally I didn't care much for the pig. I thought it was too salty for my taste buds. The chicken was good, but the beef was the ultimate winner for me. The seasoning was spot on and the texture was great. I really enjoyed all the unique toppings, but wish they had some sort of hot sauce to give the food that little extra kick.

We were greeted by the super friendly manager (owner?), he explained the selection, and offered suggestions. I really appreciated his positive energy, and could see he was passionate about the menu. 

I went in here with a very small appetite, but once we were given samples of the meat choices, I knew I had to have a full dinner. The steak defiantly stands out; amazing flavor, and soft. Nothing like the dry thin steak you see at other burrito type places. The salsa choices are creatively delicious. Pair the pineapple verde with the steak, you won't regret it. 

We were taking our food to go, but I noticed they had house sauces in small hot sauce bottles. I'm so excited to try those once I'm able to come back.

That's when I found Braddah's and was even more pleased that they have a drive through window! 

The simplicity of the menu definitely made it easy to order quickly, which is a nice change from most drive-through eateries.

STEP 1: Burrito (flour or wheat tortilla), Rice Bowl, Salad, or Tacos (3)
STEP 2: Huli Huli Chicken ($6.95), Kalua Pig ($6.95), Pulehu Steak ($7.60), Grilled Fish ($7.50), or Grilled Veggies ($6.25)
STEP 3: Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Grilled Veggies (additional $1.25), and/or Guacamole made with Hawaiian pink salt (additional $1.65)
STEP 4: Charred Pineapple Verde (Mild), Mango & Roasted Corn (Medium), or Tomato with Grilled Maui Onions (Spicy); Salad Dressing - Papaya Buttermilk Ranch or Roasted Sesame Gingerette
STEP 5: Sour cream, cheese, lettuce, jalapeno, cabbage, lime, cliantro, and/or bean sprouts.

Since I was traveling, I opted for a Kalua Pig Burrito with rice (I'm not sure why they call it ""seaweed"" rice, but it's plain ol' sticky white rice), beans, medium salsa, lettuce, cabbage, lime, and cilantro. It's a really good sized burrito and it was very good of them to cut it nicely in half without having to ask. I really enjoyed the flavor from the Kalua Pig and it was done nicely - tender, juicy. Everything else accompanying it was fresh and added crunchy textures with additional flavors.

I'm not a fan of Chipotle, Cafe Rio, or similar ""Mexican"" build-your-own tacos/burritos restaurants, however, I really appreciate the Hawaiian-style meats and fillings.

Almost as good as the food was the friendly, welcoming service.

The staff was very friendly and gave great service, they even let me try all of their meats since I had never eaten there before. I asked for some more salsa and sour cream to finish off my chips and they were happy to give some.

Like other people have said, it is a Chipotle style place where you pick your meats, your tacos/bowls/burrito, and you pick what toppings you want. There wasn't anything special about the set up, but everything looked nice and appealing.

The tacos I got were pretty good, the pork was better than the fish.  My only complaint was that since I got the hard corn tacos, the bottoms were soggy when I started eating them. This happened for both the kaula pig and fish tacos. This was while I ate inside the store, not driving them back home or something.

The chips and guacamole were just what would be expected from a place like this. The guacamole tasted like it was made recently with big chunks of avocado. The chips seemed to have been fried recently with bits of salt still on them. Both of them paired together was pretty good.

All in all, while nothing was particularly bad, nothing stood out as particularly memorable. I think if someone made me eat the food with a blindfold on and didn't tell me it was Braddah's, I would have thought I was eating Chipotle.  I think I got my money's worth for it being a groupon deal. While I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here again, I would more inclined to eat here without a groupon as compared to other places that promote a groupon.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,0,0,3,PzBzQyb5YUsKajE5xsB4_A

4925994,2013-11-22,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Ahhhh, Hawaiian food and Mexican food fused together.  These are two of my favorite foods and thought after reading the reviews, ""This place is a dream come true!"".  I drove from the Mountains Edge area to sample their international delights.  

First off when you walk in you could kind of tell that this place may have been an old Taco Bell.  But, hats off to the owner for trying to create that Aloha feel!  Anyhow, I'd like to make a quick comment about the service.  It was our first time here, and they serve the tacos, burritos, and bowls Chipotle/Subway style.  It's really good and invites a patron to ask a lot of questions.  However, the ""male"" serving staff that helped me was not the greatest.  The guy that was explaining the different types of meat to me wasn't very enthusiastic about any of them.  I know they serve fish as well, because of the Yelp reviews but he didn't ask if that was an option I'd like to try.  

The food it self was tasty and inventive.  I got the Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Puleha Steak tacos with Mango & Roasted Corn Salsa on flour tortillas.  The Kalua Pig taco being my favorite!  However, I kept to things that ""looked"" familiar like the Mango & Roasted Corn Salsa.  I wasn't ecstatic about my meal but it was just, good.  What really held down it's reputation was the Coconut Bark desert.  It's really hard to explain.  But, we had friends that hated coconut shavings.....and loved it!

So, my suggestion to this place is to have a staff that is more suggestive.  Honestly, my food was pretty good but, kinda tasted like Chipotle.  It was my fault for not trying something different but, the staff also wasn't helpful.  You really need a staff that can put you in the right direction when trying something new and inventive.  I hope to try this place one more time but, usually the first visit makes the most impression on that decision to go again.",CLBDMeEs5mONY5uXZ2QRNQ,1,1,3,J589BU5-VYaRDpeG1_cU-w
4926639,2014-12-18,2,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Went here based on the rave reviews on Yelp.  This is one of the first times that Yelp has led me astray, and it makes me sad.

First, let me say that the staff here are incredibly friendly and helpful.  They go out of their way to make your experience good.  Upon walking in, we were asked if it was our first time, and then were promptly given samples of all the meats.  I immediately noticed how low quality and fatty the meat was.  The chicken and steak, though flavored nicely, were incredibly gristly and fatty.  The kalua pork is cooked well, but a bit on the salty side for me.  I got a steak burrito with the mild salsa, which just ended up being way too sweet because of the sweetness of the steak and the fact that the mild salsa is basically limes and pineapple (my fault, I guess for ordering it).  My wife ordered a chicken bowl, which was decent but not great.  We also got a side of chips and salsa, which I regret immensely.  The chips were stale and tasted like they came from a bag.  The salsa again was too sweet.  Our total bill came to $20 without drinks (a bit pricey, IMO).

The dining experience in general was basically a Hawaiian themed Chipotle. In case you're wondering, overly sweetened Hawaiian topped with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and sugary salsa is NOT a good combination.  The food just really isn't that good.  Not only have I had much better food in general based on recommendations from Yelp, I've had much better Hawaiian food in Las Vegas.

5042252,2014-06-01,4,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Hearing that Braddah's was featured on Groupon, I quickly took the opportunity to snatch that deal. As a Hawaiian who's super passionate about food, it's didn't take long to hear about this place. My impression was that this was a Hawaiian joint taking a Mexican fusion approach. I wanted to visit this place to see how accurate that was. 

Rolling up to Braddah's, I thought it was super cute! Yellow awning type roof, outside seating with bright yellow umbrellas. I knew the inside wouldn't disappoint as well. The color scheme is green and yellow, a very common combo from my hometown on the Big Island. My past schools had the same color scheme and a lot of housing tend to represent the same combo. The walls were beautifully adorned with Hawaii prints, maps and other artwork. Hawaiian music played over the speakers bringing a laid back vibe to the restaurant. The staff was pretty young, but full of the Aloha spirit. Kenny, a long time employee is someone I met through the Hawaiian community here in Vegas and seems to really embody the Hawaiian mentality. It made me feel like I was visiting a place back home in Hawaii! 

The food choice was really creative! I felt like I was visiting the Hawaiian version of Chipotle or Cafe Rio! For step 1, you basically choose a burrito, bowl, salad or 3 tacos and take it from there. On this visit, I chose the bowl, topped with step 2, kalua pig for $6.95 and doubled with huli huli chicken for an extra $2.00. Step 3, I chose seaweed rice (brown rice with nori) and black beans, step 4 I went with the mango and corn salsa, as well as the guacamole for an extra $1.65. My last step, step 5, I chose toppings like cabbage, cilantro and a'a lava chips. As you can see, you're literally building a plate from the ground up. Lots to choose from and the food was awesome. The kalua pig was super smokey and really juicy! The chicken was flavored well and really tender. All toppings and elements brought that Latin flare and a refreshing component. The cabbage and chips helped to represent a crunchy texture. Truly a great dish! For dessert I had to get the small coconut bark for $3.95. It was 1/4 of a pound goodness! Chocolate, caramel, cookie and coconut layered to make a sweet delight. Great way to end this wonderful meal! 

Seeing the great deals they offer on Groupon AND Yelp, makes me wonder. Usually Groupon deals to me, means the place is trying to attract more customers. The food they offer, in my opinion, does not need all that hype. When you serve great food at affordable prices, people will just come. This place serves pretty amazing food if I say so myself :-) I live on the opposite side of the valley and after trying this place out, I'm definitely coming back again soon, no matter the distance.

First time we dined in. I got the Pulehu steak, seaweed rice, beans, cabbage, sour cream, tomato onion salsa (supposedly ""hot""), corn salsa. It wasn't spicy and just needed something for some oompf with spice and needed a little salt as everything was underseasoned. There were 2 bottles on the table, a yellow sauce and one bright red/pink one. The yellow was tangy sweet and the pink was sweet fruity sauce. It wasn't what I was looking for so I kept it plain. The BFs bowl with the Kalua pig was way better as his meat was nicely seasoned and had a nice smokey flavor. 

The second time we came was much better. I got the kalua pig and to get some of the spice I asked for some sliced jalapeno. Everything seemed better seasoned this time around, like the rice the last time was not salted. I hope that this keeps on, it was much more flavorful and was actually pretty tasty. Now, if they can make the ""spicy"" salsa actually have some bite that would be awesome. I wonder if their consistency is a issue, but I hope that this visits quality is more common and would explain all these great reviews.

We tried the coconut bark salty sweet noms this time too. I want some more! The box came with 4 pieces and I should have bought more. It reminds me of the saltine brittle my sister used to make. It has some chewy almond roca tasting toffee, pretzel, layer of chocolate with some coconut shavings on top.

I'm not really sure about my entire bowl, but the sauces that I paired them with made the whole bowl way way better. I included a pic of the 2 sauces I liked the most with my bowl; it really tones the flavor down and makes it combine nicely :)

The only thing I would recommend is putting a bigger trashcan/tray/dish area in the lobby.

Tia was manning the register and was eager to serve us. She gave us samples of the meats that were offered. The huli-huli chicken and pulehu steak were okay, it didn't really pack a punch in my opinion, but the kalua pork was flavorful and on point. Most of their sauces were too sweet for my taste. I liked the coconut colada pearl the best, even though it was the spiciest I found that by adding just a splash it enhanced the meat with just enough heat to it. 

So for 3 bowls and a box of holiday bark we ended up paying a little over $36 which I thought was kinda steep. We got in the car, drove off and I just happen to check the receipt and realized they had charged us for the 2 boxes of coconut bark that was supposed to be free with the yelp check in. We went back, they apologized and all was well. While waiting for the hubby to get back I took a bite of the coconut bark, it was pretty tasty but nothing I would kill for.

The staff was super nice and genuinely seemed like their wanted their customers to have the best experience possible.  Another nice bonus was that there is free wifi (the pass code is posted on top of the door)

Now for the food:

I ordered the Kalua Pig Bowl with a bit of the charred pineapple verde salsa and the mango & roasted corn salsa. I loved thought the Kalua Pig was seasoned really well and it went well with both salsa.  They offer several toppings to spice up your dish that include sour cream, romaine lettuce, cheese, jalapeños, cilantro (which I LOVE), cabbage, and guacamole with pink Hawaiian salt (for a little extra).  Yes, I got the guacamole and it was wonderful and I feel like I have to get it next time I go back as well.  

Also, since we had a little bit extra on our Groupon we also sprang for the Coconut Bark on recommendation from one of the workers.  Now don't get me wrong, I like something sweet every now and then, but this was way past my sweet limit.  I'll be skipping this in the future, but if you REALLY LIKE SWEET than this might be the perfect dessert for you.

I'm excited to go back in the future to try out their other meats and combinations.  I totally recommend this place and really you can't go wrong with Hawaiian Food or Chipotle like bowls/burritos!!

I understand that this is a new restaurant and concept for this area and I would love to see this restaurant succeed...with that being said I would like to put my two cents in and advise this new restaurant to offer more varieties of food and drinks. I see that the kitchen is big enough so offering french fries and burgers (kids love) + ?? Hawaiian style should not be a problem. 

The family atmosphere that is evident in their great customer service comes through loud and clear...just some advice in hopes that this place can attract more customers.",G5HJ8ojD6Dx515m-eJYaXQ,0,0,4,PpHjRPbnwcAfBoLfGxETyw

The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the clean modern decor. I was very impressed. Very spacious dining room and outside seating. The menu consisted of tacos, burritos, bowls etc. Your typical Chipotle menu, but what made it stand out was the meat selections were all Hawaiian local style preparations such as pulehu steak, kalua pig, huli huli chicken and grilled fish. The girl behind the counter generously offered a sample of the kalua pig which I found to be delicious, tender and juicy. We ordered 3 huli huli chicken burritos, a kalua pig bowl and a kalua pig burrito along with a kids menu cheese quesadilla. The kids meal comes with tortilla chips and a drink. Although we were thoroughly impressed by the food and the service, what really pleased me is that they pay attention to the small details like the cutlery, napkins, and to-go bags. All of these were pretty ""high end"" when it comes to disposables. The napkin was nice and thick, the kind you would get at an actual nice sit down restaurant. The cutlery was sturdy and the to go bag was not some cheap plastic bag, it was a nice, large, sturdy shopping bag with handles.

Admittedly, we used the yelp mobile app to find it, saw the reviews, and dropped in without researching the menu thoroughly.  But with a name like Braddah's, you'd think it would either have a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere or plate lunch (preferrably both).  It had neither.

They are occupying the space that was a KFC forever, then the Mad Greek Cafe. Located just North of the Sahara and Rainbow intersection behind McDonalds.

Seaweed rice
Black beans or pinto beans
Then all toppings are free:
grilled veggies, fruit infused salsas, fresh jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, guacamole, and a few others.

I opted for a Kalua Pig Bowl. It was off the charts. Everything was loaded in my bowl and I mixed it all together. Perfectly seasoned. The meat was tender and juicy, the guacamole was fresh. Absolutely Aloha in a bowl. I loved it.

5355553,2015-07-25,7,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Braddah's Island Style puts a unique island twist to fast food. 

Ordering is simple: first start with your base of regular brown rice or seaweed rice (brown rice with seaweed), then you have your meats (huli-huli chicken, pulehu steak, kalua pig) to choose from, then finally choose any toppings (black beans, cabbage, bean sprouts, lettuce, and sour cream just to name a few). The guacamole, of course, comes at an extra price if ordered.
Though their ordering style is similar to Chipotle's, these burritos/burrito bowls pack some serious flavor.

I went with the classic kalua pig. I usually like to have everything mixed in (including both the pineapple and corn salsas) for maximum flavor. Everything balanced out perfectly. The pork was very succulent and juicy and went will with the sweetness of the corn and pineapple salsas. They gave out generous portions here, which I found to be super filling.

The coconut bark has a weird, yet addicting sweet/salty taste. Worth a try if you have a sweet tooth after your meal. They also have Hawaiian Sun products available for purchase, which are a perfect pairing to any meal had here. What better way to wash down a meal than with a can of Lilikoi Passion by Hawaiian Sun... I'm drooling just thinking about it!

Overall, this place is awesome. Customer service was great, they have their own private parking spots, and they have a drive-thru option if you don't want to step out of your car.

5361301,2013-10-20,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"**Summary**
       - Fusion - The place is a Hawaiian/Tex Mex fusion. It takes traditional Hawaiian meats and combines them with Tex Mex's tacos, burritos, and bowls.
       - Chipotle - I'd describe this place as a Hawaiian Chipotle. The menu and ordering style is the same. The flavor however, is different.
       - Rice - Rather than the normal cilantro/lime rice at Chipotle, they have rice with sprinkles of seaweed. It's quite delicious.
       - Taste - If you're not sure which meat to get, I'd recommend asking for a sample, that way you're knowing what you're getting into.
**Ordered**
       - Huli Huli Chicken - I can't get over how flavorful and perfectly cooked this chicken is. I went with an actual Hawaiian who told that Hawaii Huli Huli Chicken was one of the pinnacles of Hawaiian food and she said this chicken ranks up there as well.
       - Kalua Pig - Kalua Pig usually is pretty salty. This one is no exception. It goes well in a bowl, but I wouldn't recommend it in a burrito.
       - Pulehu Steak - The steak seemed a little under seasoned. It might of been since I had the Kalua Pig first.
       - Grilled Fish - The grilled fish tacos we had were delicious. The fish was flaky and cooked to perfection.
       - Coconut Bark - Unfortunately, I didn't like this as much. It's a lot of chocolate and was a bit too rich for me. A couple bites and I was going into a sugar meltdown.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you like Hawaiian fusion or Chipotle. It's an interesting change and delicious.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,2,4,3K0BN2s8sv6bFM3RtV4yDw
5387320,2014-01-13,1,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Seriously ono!  It's like a Hawaiian Chipotle.  Bowls, tacos, burritos and salads pack a serious aloha punch to your tasty buds.  The meat/vegetarian choices include huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish, or veggies.  My personal favorite is the grilled fish, which is packed full of flavor despite the nondescript name.  Now here is where it gets interesting, you get to choose one of their yummy salsas to top your creation.  Their current salsa list includes charred pineapple verde (mild), mango/roasted corn (med), or tomato/grilled maui onions (spicy).  My favorite is the tomato/onions salsa, however I wouldn't call it spicy by a long shot.  All of the other standard toppings are available, such as cheese, sour cream, lettuce, beans, etc.  They also offer jalapenos, which is a nice surprise!

My only complaint is their rice, it's quite dense and heavy.  I wish they offered a choice of something fluffier.

If you're not too full, you must grab some of the coconut bark dessert.  Screw it, even if you are full just grab some for later.  Be warned my friends, this stuff is more addictive than crack!

5390455,2013-09-26,4,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Went to Braddah's for the 2nd time this week and can officially say I'm hooked already.   I was determined not to mention ""Hawaiian Chipotle"" for the fear of it being passé, but really it turns out it's the best way to describe it.   I actually think they should have just fully played up to this fact by incorporating Chipotle into the name of the restaurant or something.   Hau'olipotle!   ChipotLEI!    I'll be here all week.

On my first visit I had a gameplan to get an order of tacos so I could sample all the main meats (Chicken, Pig, Steak), and even though they awesomely asked if I wanted to try any/all of the meats prior to ordering, I stuck to the plan and ordered the tacos.  Like you've read from other reviews it's just like Chipotle/Zabas where you start with a taco/burrito/bowl/salad decision and then choose meats/accompaniments to go with it.  On top of the meats I tried the seaweed rice, the corn salsa, the tomato salsa, and some jalapenos.  They also have the standard items like cheese, sour cream, guac.    I had the choice of crunchy corn or soft flour tortillas and went crunchy corn.   Of the meats the pig stood out to me by far.   The steak and chicken both seemed to have a bit of sweet teriyaki flavor to it which I'm generally not a fan of.   They tasted fine for what they are, but the pig was so juicy and flavorful that I've been craving it since that day.   The seaweed rice didn't really taste much different than regular rice, but maybe that was because it was on tacos and there wasnt much of it.  Most all of the other fixins I got were standard, which is not a bad thing but it leaves for very little to write about.  Pro-tip: the jalapenos here are fresh and extremely spicy.   I've already witnessed them leave a coworker in literal tears.   Be warned.   

To close out the first visit I tried some of the much heralded coconut bark.   This was probably ill-advised with my lactose intolerance but to add credence to the review I felt it was necessary.   You're welcome.   It was as good as everyone says it is.   So much so that you know when you're in a situation with a few people sharing several pieces of something, and it gets to that last piece and there's the tug of war of ""you have it"" ""no I insist!"".   I ended the tug of war after one ""no you can have it"" uttered by my friend.   So delicious it made me a greedy jerk.   Highly recommended

The 2nd visit I went to an all pig burrito with most of the same fixins I got previously.  I didn't really feel like my burrito was made all that well to be honest, especially when I asked for all 3 salsas and got them separated into thirds on my burrito by the gentleman making it.   It was almost too funny for me to even correct.   Are there people in this world who eat burritos like that?   I wanted all of them melding together throughout but instead it was like a salsa taste test.   Also the burrito just seemed really short and stubby and I kinda felt they skimped a little on the meat, whereas my friend's burrito last time looked completely stuffed.   It was still incredibly delicious and I can't really expect every cog of the assembly line to be consistent this early in the stages.

I can easily see this being upgraded to 5 stars once it does.   In the meantime don't bother trying to trademark ChipotLEI as I've already got my lawyers on it.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,3,4,oNpvRdM60hm-GQ44htE1DQ
5391042,2014-06-25,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"We went to braddahs and I would say it was very good. This place can be compared to a chipotle grill. You choose from burrito, bowl, salad. I tried the bowl with everything in it and got the grilled fish. I will say that the portion of fish was only 2 ounces or so. The meat that my wife chose was the steak and she got plenty of it. The size of the bowl was nice and the options of toppings are more than chipotle with option like fresh cut habanero, bean sprouts, and pineapple blend. 
We ended our meal with a piece of coconut log which is caramel, toffee, chocolate slabs topped with coconut. This stuff is the candy version of crack.. It seriously is amazing and worth the trip alone.

I had heard they were going to open, but didn't know when, so today when I drove by on my way to work, I noticed the sign and knew I had to try it. 

The drive through is not functioning yet, so I went inside. the first time might be good, the menu isn't big nor complicated but you gotta know your choices and seeing the whole board helps. 

First, pick put the type, burrito, bowl, salad or taco. Choose your meat, add the 'filler' like rice, beans, cabbage, etc....

Next add the salas, finally add all the other condiments like guacamole and sour cream. Oh yah, you can top it off with a saald dressing too!

I got a salad, huli huli chicken, (small bite size grilled slightly crispy outside chicken) with bed of romaine lettuce, add the spicy tomato with grilled Maui onion,  ( don't worry, it's not spicy at all, buy savory), I added sour cream, guacamole with hawaiian pink salt, and the roasted sesame gingerette (tasted the sesame but ginger not so much).

It was really good,  enjoyed it and will difinitly be back to try more! Friendly staff, excellent service and good flavors!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,7,4,5,Inj-0nMdLzVfgeQT8xRLtQ

My only problem with this location is that every time I've visited, they've always run out of something. The first time it was different kinds of meats and toppings (and I did not want to wait 20 minutes for them to be ready, so I just went without.) This last time we visited, the soda machine was not working...but the cashier still sold us a small drink. Luckily, another employee was kind enough to suggest giving us a bottled drink, which worked out well.

I ordered the chicken bowl with all the fixings. The chicken was dry, the rice tasted like its been sitting there all day, and everything just had a strange taste to it. Like I said, maybe I went at a bad time... But unfortunately I'm not tempted to go back and try again.

Kalua Pork Nachos.

I discovered this tasty meat in Kauai some years back, and I've not found comparable since, except for hear.  And they are generous with the meat.  I was very pleased with the flavor, their cheese, and the guacamole.  It's all very flavorful.

The place is nice and clean, and the people are very friendly.  They let me try a few samples, and they are very much about taking care of the customer.  What surprises me is that whenever I go, the place is empty.  Maybe I'm coming at an off time, so who knows?  But I do think the food and service is worth visiting for.  I'm already become mildly addicted to the nachos.

I love the idea of mixing the Hawaii locals favorites with that Mexican twist.  So far, I've tried the kalua pig (pulled pork) and the huli huli chicken bowls (gotta have the bowls!).  Both have great quality to them- the kalua pig has that perfect texture, it's not too wet but still very juicy and flavorful.  The huli huli was my favorite.  The chicken doesn't have that thick layer of fat lots of places like to keep on there, was all juicy meat.  All the veggies used were fresh, which can make or break dishes like these.  Now their coconut bark, mmm... It's sort of a soft brittle with chocolate and coconut.  Try it!!

5492475,2013-09-09,0,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Island style Chipotle is the accurate description of this place...but perhaps with a little less organization compared to its corporate counterpart.  Okay, so I ended up ordering a quesadilla with kahlua pork and asked to have an adult size version of it.  I had to correct them twice that I would like meat in it when I was ordering.  When it arrived at the table, it was a tad bit greasy and the meat was all smushed to one side and not evenly spread out.  Also the exterior was soggy due to it being cooked in wrapped foil...I like my quesadillas to have a nice crunch on the exterior.  The flavor of the kahlua was good, but they also failed to give me any fixings like sour cream or guac to accompany the quesadilla.  My fiance ordered the 3 taco combo and I must say that looked more delicious than my order.  He tried the huli huli chicken, mahi mahi, and the kahlua pig and his tacos were overflowing with guac/sour cream/salsa.  As I was in line waiting for our order, I heard the lady behind me say loudly, ""kinda stingy with the meat, eh.""  I turned to see what she was ordering and they put the two smallest pieces of fish I've ever seen in her rice bowl....eek!  If you are looking for value go with the tacos instead of the rice bowl...because she was right, they are stingy!  The coconut chocolate bark was just okay in my mind, but I'm not a big sweets person and this is SWEET! Overall, I'd give them another try since the samples I had of the other meats were delicious.  I probably wouldn't order the quesadilla again and probably won't order the rice bowl unless I feel like being a semi-vegetarian that day.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,4,1,3,YI-I_Cawf8SRC33K-dm1nA

When I walked up to the entrance around noon on a weekday, I noticed that the line went almost out the door; this is usually a good sign.  There were about 7 or 8 people in line.  Because everything is kind of labor intensive to make, it took about 20 minutes to get to the front of the line; not good for business people on a lunch break.  

I decided on the Huli Huli Chicken Salad with various fixings.  The setup reminded me very much of Chiptole, but with a Hawaiian vibe.  Also, decided to pick up a small box of their coconut bark which was very tasty.

The seating area was pleasant and clean with a few others eating their meals.  My chicken salad bowl looked delicious, but I was very disappointed that the chicken was somewhat dry and had very minimal seasoning. Boo!  Even with the other toppings this, didn't even rise to the level of a tasty salad.  I had to resort to adding salt and pepper to my salad, which is very rare for me.  

But before I started to eat my salad, I realized that I'd forgotten to pick up my small box of coconut box from the cashier.  So, I went up to the counter and patiently waited for the worker to recognize me and ask what I needed; I would assume that's normal protocol.  I realize she was busy, but instead of asking what I wanted, I was totally ignored.  After three other customers paid, I finally spoke up and asked for my small box of bark.

Other positives -- quality ingredients including fresh jalapeños.  Really makes a difference you can tell. Great portions and very fairly priced I would say. I like the Hawaiian themed touches around the restaurant. 

Only minus really -- they're going to need some window treatments of some kind very soon because despite it only being March and the temperature around 70-ish it was blazing hot at sundown with the sun setting in the west.  I suspect they might be aware of this and working on it.

Allow me to describe this place in one word: OMNOMNOM. 

At first, I thought, great, just what we need, another taco/burrito/bowl place within walking distance of UNLV (others being Chipotle and Cafe Rio). We're also not needing in hawaiian food either. But, Braddahs knocked it out of the park. Hawaiian mexican might be a way to describe it? Whatever the style is, it was *good*. 

We were welcomed with samples to try the menu (they just opened this location within the past few days) - and were sold right there. I had a steak & chicken salad. Delicious. If I had one critique, it was that the pork by itself was a bit on the salty side, but I could see that being less of a problem in the context of other things on the plate. 

Then, coconut bark happened. If I wasn't already in love with the place, I am now.

The owner (I presume that who he was) was welcoming and personable, helping out the service team and greeting customers. It didn't feel fake-servicey like at Chipotle, where they look up and begrudgingly moan, ""welcome to chipotle.""

I went with the half steak half kalua pig bowl with seaweed rice. The kalua pig choice was a shocker considering I've never actually tried one that I truly liked. Braddas was a winner. I finished off my salad with both the pineapple verde and the mango salsa. Mango salsa-- Something I'm also never a fan of.  This bowl did not disappoint and made me a lover of kalua pig AND mango salsa. 

My husband had a bowl with seaweed rice, chicken and steak with almost all the same fixings. Delish.

We were also given a sample of the coconut bark, we loved it so much we purchased a 1/4lb to go.

5778780,2014-07-16,7,1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,"Naming this place Braddah's, using kalua pig and ""pulehu"" steak really doesn't make it Hawaiian. Portions are large and flavors are ok, wraps were hard and cold, meats were dripping with grease. 

Part of the appeal of Hawaiian/local food restaurants like island sushi and island flavor for me is the atmosphere - it feels like home because of the food, music and people. This place was empty, silent, and the girl working the counter seriously didn't give a sh*t. It had a fast food mcdonalds type of vibe and I wasn't feeling that either. I would maybe go back to try the coconut bark, but otherwise - pass. 

With that said, I could easily see this becoming a small national chain. Calling steak pulehu (means grilled) sounds exotic I guess. People seem to like being adventurous without really being adventurous if that makes sense.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,10,4,2,Oo3H1-nIDMc3iuATRx5-Zg

This particular visit though wasn't that great. I came here with my girlfriend to get something to eat an hour or so before they closed. We stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before someone saw us. There was, on the other hand, what looked  like an 11 year old boy just hanging out behind the counter just walking around...he glanced at us and didn't say a word...it was kinda weird... Anyways, so there we were just waiting. Honestly, I didn't really mind waiting but it just sucks that no one greeted us all that  time. They gave us slightly old food from the looks of it and then when we got it we found a hair in my tacos. I brushed it off and ate 2 of my tacos. (mind you, I grabbed the tray from the cashier and I'm bald, so clearly it wasn't my girlfriends' or mine.) 

But this is why I'm writing this review:

I saw the young boy behind the counter again and reach down into the front area (where they prepare the food for you) and grab food with his bare hands a multiple times. No one saw him until the cashier/food handler come up and I thought she would say something. But she didn't and proceeded to let the boy eat.

....... I'm not going to lie, I was not a fan of the food at first. The main one being that the actual temperature of the food wasn't piping hot like I enjoy. I think all of the veggies and cold salsas took away from the warmth of the meat. I had the HuliHuli chicken burrito with seaweed rice, fajita veggies, corn salsa, and guac. The chicken was seasoned well but it was a bit on the cold side for a burrito. In your defense we did come in about 15 minutes before closing and maybe I got the last batch of chicken.
After much debate my boyfriend drug me back into this location (He's a HUGE fan of Braddahs) to give it one more try. I was honest with the young lady working and she asked lots of questions about what I did not like on my first visit and was determined to fix it..... she talked me into something different.
This time around I had a three taco plate. 1 Kahluah Pig and 2 steak tacos and  OH MYYYYYY....... AMAZING!!!
That Kahluah pig was perfectly seasoned, juicy, and tender, as was the steak. The tacos were very generously portioned out. Perfect!!!

It is not your typical Aloha grinds place but take Hawaiian eats like kalua pig, huli huli chicken, pulehu steak, grilled fish and mix it up with a serving style of something to similar to Chipotle and you have Braddah's.

My go to eats are typically a bowl with a bed of seaweed brown rice, a mix of half huli huli chicken and kalua pig, black beans, cabbage, lime, jalapenos, bean sprouts, cilantro, and a mix of mango and roasted corn salsa and tomato with maui onions salsa. I also like to add on a serving of grilled veggies which costs you an extra $1.25. 

You could also choose to add a pineapple verde salsa, lettuce, sour cream, cheese, guacamole ($1.65 extra) and salad dressing options from either papaya buttermilk ranch or roasted sesame gingerette. I am a fan of both salad dressings too.

And the kiddos are not left out here either. They have a kids menu as well that comes with a drink and chips, we also go with a nice cheesy quesadilla. 

You can opt for other options instead of a bowl, you can go with 3 tacos, salad, bowl or burrito. You can double your meat for around $2 I believe. The burritos are huge here FYI. You definitely get your money's worth.

The food is solid. I might have to add a little salt and pepper to my bowl but I leave with a full and more importantly a very happy belly. 

Las but definitely least, the best part of my eats are the dessert. They have this amazing salty and sweet coconut bark and it is just love. pure love. They had a holiday bark around Christmas time which in my opinion was better than the regular coconut bark and I anticipate the return of it again. Either way the bark will break da mouth. It is that good.

I think I am going to have to go again today after writing this review. I need some Braddah's.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,5,5,5,JCTG722CcIVspT_9C2rrcw

Hawaiian cuisine is my comfort food for the lazy days lounging around in my pajamas watching Magnum P.I. on my VCR. Sarah told me this place opened up recently and I was anxious to try some Westside Vegas Hawaiian grub.

Outside the building looks like an old Wienerschnitzel but inside it's clean and full of island flavor. Service was laid back and nice just like the islands. They let us sample some meats and the Kalua Pork won over my taste buds. The owner Chris was a friendly guy!

Kalua Pork Bowl - The seaweed rice is a genius idea. I'm glad it's brown rice too! The pork is better than many Hawaiian restaurants I've been to which cost twice as much. The sauces they offer were great. It's an awesome filling bowl packed with great contrasting flavors.

Don't forget some coconut bark. Sure it's cold and firm when it's first taken out of the fridge but once it warms up, it's a Maui honeymoon in your mouth. Chewy gooey goodness.

When we were waiting to order they brought us by some samplers and the Kahlua pork was nice and flavorful but I ended up with the chicken salad.  The down fall is they only had 3 kinds of dressing I believe.  Other than that the grilled chicken had a fantastic flavor.  The nicest part was that the owner was out cleaning tables and thanking customer for coming in.  That means a lot to me and I was impressed.

It's very hard to find good Kalua Pork here in Vegas. Always either too dry or bland. Sometimes even watery, which is gross. I tried the Kalua Pork in the tacos and the bowl. Soooo delicious!! Tender, flavorful and juicy. This was honestly the best tasting I have had so far in this town! Impressive, knowing that the owner is not from Hawaii.

Portions are huge, so definitely come hungry! I could only finish 2 out of 3 tacos the first time.

The kids ordered a good variety of foods. We did not eat off each others plates but they enjoyed what they had. If there was left overs it was not because they did not enjoy the food it was because there was so much we could not finish it.  We left full and happy they were out to please our group.
