Ordered a Caesar salad, and also a plain personal pan pizza. Salad was great, and even the spines of the greens were sweet. Pizza was very nice, if different from what I'm used to. Its crust was a nice thin and crisp situation that did not get soggy at any time, thus making it better than what I got from nearby Novecento. And I'm going to say that the cheese and sauce were good but not as good as the also-nearby Montesano's Eateria - but Montesano's had a thicker, breadier crust that interfered too much with the other ingredients in my opinion.

Staff were friendly, water tasted clean, and ambiance was nice. We came in during a slow time, so it wasn't busy or loud, but I can see how it would get very busy and very loud during dinner.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,4,HYu8s7ucnE_NBaTpXyL4DA

I like my pizza topping simple pepperoni and sausage and they use very special pepperoni not the cheap kind and the mozzarella they use is very creamy not stringy. 

If you like a lot of stuff on your pie this may not be your kind of pizza but if you like great NYC style pizza without the grease then give this place a try",Q8uTqwmv2XA2ojDyE9uNXw,1,0,5,BJKGJltummoC6b8zT-sBlg
20782,2010-09-28,0,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"Grimaldi's for me is the best place in Las Vegas for traditional coal oven pizza. It's not 100% Neapolitan, it is more like coal oven NY style.

The crust is crispy on the outside, soft, moist and chewy in the middle (foldable) and has a nice aroma from the coal oven. The sauce tastes fresh and balanced (bordering slightly on sweet). 
If you expect to find the gobs of generic ""cheese"" found in most pizza places you won't find it at Grimaldi's. They use fresh mozzarella and it barely covers the pizza crust but it is fresh and delicious and you can taste it in every bite. And if that's not enough, the pizza is not greasy at all! 
It is satiating without bloating you up and making you feel like you ate an anvil.

As for toppings I usually order their red peppers and maybe some extra cheese or sauce. I have tried adding chicken but the pizza ended up very moist. 

Their Mediterranean salad is fresh and a decent serving.

The cheesecake is pretty good, not artificially and overly sweet like some others, sweet enough to taste like dessert while also tasting fresh.

Service has been very good and the staff has been very attentive.
There is some outdoor seating which is great, especially when it's windy.
Inside the decor makes you feel like you're in NY with pictures, street signs, rail signs etc.

Overall one of the best pizza places in the valley and the best for oven baked pizza. I prefer Grimaldi's over Settebello for thin oven baked pizza; though quite similar in many respects, Grimaldi's gets my vote.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,2,2,5,MCDLufOzzckjdE3fcvO7wg

The waitress Bryna (dark hair in ponytail, olive complexion, average build) came to take our drink order. We had drinks at home so we declined and asked for waters. That were things started to go downhill.

-She cleared away the wine glasses in a abrupt manner, banging them into the pizza rack on our table and walked away without saying a word.
-After a long wait, she finally came to take our order. We declined to order salads and that made her walk away huffing and puffing.
-The food came, and the one time she did come to check on us she did not look at us when speaking and whatever she was saying was inaudible.
-We paid with a giftcard and she came back after awhile acting annoyed and saying she has to wait for the manager to apply the giftcard.
-As she was explaining this, our credit card fell from her hand onto the table and she picked it up and walked away without saying anything. 

She made us feel like she was mad because we didn't order a lot of food because she sure was chatting it up with the party at the table next to us. I filled out a comment card but don't know if it ever made it to management.

141719,2010-12-30,0,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"Wow. That has to have been the BEST pizza I've ever had. We ordered two pizzas, one margarita and one with sun dried tomatoes, sausage, and meatballs. Both were spectacular. The crust was thin and crispy, with just the right amount of sauce to cheese ratio. The toppings tasted extremely fresh and the pizza was not oily. I'm one of those people who dab the pizza with a napkin if I see oil on it, but this time I didn't have to! They use a coal oven to cook their pizzas, which results in a very crispy crust. I heard they take Las Vegas water, purify it, and turn it in to the same composition as NY water for their pizza dough. I'm not sure if that's their secret or the oven, but it was delicious! 

After eating tons of pizza we were stuffed but....we decided to order dessert! And boy, were we not disappointed. We split a cannoli and yum it was delicious. The exterior shell was crisp, as if it was just stuffed! The filling was creamy and sweet, but not too sweet. The atmosphere was very pleasant, and the service was wonderful and attentive. The parking was also great. Since it's in a shopping mall area, there are a ton of spots.

Once seated, you feel a little cramped. There just seems to be to many tables for the space. You're close to climbing over people to get seated or leave.

As far as the food, it's fine but not particularly tasty or inspired. The sauces are on par with any other pizza place. The salads are a good size. When considering sandwiches, they are big but coated in the same lack luster sauce. Finally, if you're having pizza, you better be in the mood for thin crust which will tend to have a little extra char than you might like. 

Considering the pizzas are priced per topping, I think (and my party) were most recently disappointed with the spread of toppings. At $2 per, I was just hoping for more meat than we were presented.",BYnnHEwIPRMnjpNVH7fEPA,1,0,2,7lr879GmPdWPftfcEXauJw

But our waitress was very helpful especially after we told her it was our first time.  The small salads can serve up to 2 people and are all made with a red wine vinaigrette except the Caesar salad.  They have set prices for plain cheese pizza with different sauces and sizes and additional toppings are about $2 each.

We ordered a small house salad- lettuce,red peppers, mushrooms green olives and red onion. There was a lot of dressing but thats the way I like it!  We also ordered a small red sauce pizza with fresh garlic, ricotta and Italian sausage.  When it arrived they stretched it to a large! This was the best pizza we've had in Vegas- ricotta was very creamy and they didn't hold back on the toppings.  Overall we spend just about $30.

Eastern Avenue location I was appalled by our experience on Sat. 8/22/15 at approx. 7:30 p.m. There was a table of 3 men and a woman. One man was drunk and disorderly. So much so, that a nearby table of adults with young children cancelled their order and left because of their foul language. Myself and my guest were likewise offended. One of the men at the table was permitted to enter and dine in bare feet, which was repulsive. 

I called for the manager to ask that he take appropriate action. His comment was ""I've already spoken to them and there was nothing more I could do."" I mentioned to him about the man being permitted to dine in bare feet and that being a health issue and potentially liability should he step on glass or other foreign matter. He just shrugged his shoulders and said ""I'm sorry."" 

This manager was approximately 6'3"" and 250 lbs. and seemed frightened to confront and order them to leave. I heard from some of the other dinners and they too were appalled and disgusted that the ""manager"" just let these unruly persons ruin their dinner as well.

The pizza is no longer piping hot.  4. The pizza was supposed to be Italian sausage & ""Red peppers""! I'm posting a photo of the pizza. See if you can find the sausage. I think there is more sausage on McDonald's sausage biscuit sandwich. I can here Clara Peller yelling ""where's the beef"" from her grave. 5. The only reason that I'm able to give this place a star, is because the pizza was in fact very tasty. The sausage was very good when you could find a bite. Good sauce and fresh peppers.

I had been to the Summerlin location months ago for lunch where I split a salad and a white pizza with 4 friends.  It was incredible there and the pizza I ordered for takeout on Eastern was quite amazing as well.

A large 18"" 1 topping pizza was roughly $20.  Little pricey for a thin crust with only 1 topping, but the ingredients were top notch.

If you share a large pizza and salad with drink with 3 other friends you'll probably end up at roughly $10 a person

A large would probably feed 3-4 adults, and it's a very good thin crust pizza with slices of fresh mozzarella, small spicy bits of pepperoni and delicious sauce.

684730,2009-04-28,0,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"Reading other reviews on here is laughable.  PEOPLE IT""S THIN CRUST PIZZA.  If you don't like thin crust then stay away from this place.  It's also COAL FIRED OVEN.  If you don't understand this,, the coal heats at a higher temperature than fire or other means leaving this thin crust cooked crisp with a few chars here and there.  Anyway, I dislike thick crust pizzas because my opinion is the crust can absorb/take away from the flavors on the pizza.  When Grimaldis opened (I actually was a subcontractor for part of the building so I was aware as it was coming into town) I decided to try and I absolutely think it's the best pizza in Vegas minus specialty gourmet pizzas which I give to Metro. The crust in my opinion is great, the fire roasted pepper yummy, the thick pepperoni, sausage extremely flavorful, And get this ,, the few people in here complaining about the cheese IT""S WHOLE SLICED MOZZARELLA.  I don't know if you understand that when a pizza place uses pre shredded cheese it looses some flavor as it has to be preserved  and prevented from hardening and sticking together.  The whole slices of cheese on Grimaldis pizza adds a great effect and provides in my opinion the best flavor the cheese can offer. If you want piles of shredded cheese that starts stretching and stringing as you have to keep pulling it away from you as you try to eat then you won't like Grimaldis.  Basically, IT's all about proportions.  I think Grimaldis has found the best, crust,cheese, sauce proportion for me. I can taste everything without getting full on the first slice.  Also, sign up for their email and get a free large pizza every year for your Birthday,, it's a great deal LOL.
If you decide Grimaldis doesn't have the toppings you desire then there's only one other place in vegas and that is Metro.",llx3GcUeFzxTw9vxfzvSqw,0,0,5,McmPdNupkizndNfe7L-E7A

Food: Pizzas definitely belong in coal brick-ovens!  
-Pizza: Crunchy smokey thin crust pizza with delicious fresh mozzarella. The topping choices are endless. We went with sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives, extra basil, and mushrooms. Since the large size was only $2 more than the small size, we got the large and ate pizza all weekend. ;)  
-Caesar Salad: I love Caesar salads. I order them everywhere I go. This one was perfect. Fresh romaine. Shredded parmesan. Smokey croutons. Tangy creamy Caesar dressing. Portions are huge. Small salad was more than enough for two.  
-House Salad: Felt like we made a trip to the Mediterranean salad bar. Tomatoes, roasted red pepper, mushrooms, olives in vinaigrette dressing. Not bad.
-Beer: Blue Moon or Stella on tap go oh so well with pizza. Don't get the house wines, they're not very good.

Service: We've sat at both the tables and the bar. Service is stellar either way. Waiters/bartenders are friendly. Food comes out fast. They check in with us just enough. What more can you ask for?

Atmosphere: This restaurant is especially great on a warm summer evening with a big outdoor patio. The bar is also a great place to watch the game. 

Parking: The only knock against this place is that the parking lot in this plaza sucks. Half the lot is reserved by Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Lame. So as soon as you pull into the lot, keep an eye out for parking.",lFOdzMVUA1E2WOhxGX9whQ,1,0,5,p-c0qIVYdovEMqvAt9x2hg

I've been here a few times now and have never had a bad experience. The slightly crunchy thin crust pizza is cooked perfectly each time; it's great but not super filling or overwhelming like some pizza can be. From peppers to pineapple they have any topping you desire. They use fresh mozzarella on the pizza so it's not oozing with a thick layer of cheese (a positive in my book), rather there are spots of cheese all around the pizza. The salads are enormous and wonderful. My favorite is the Caprese. You'll definitely want to share one of those bad boys. 

The outdoor seating is awesome when the weather is right and the indoor seating feels like an Italian grandmother's kitchen, dough flying through the air and pizza ovens hard at work.

Getting to why this location gets 5 stars... 

We sat at the bar to catch the playoff game, and had one of the best customer service experiences ever.  

Tracy, the bartender, was rad!  She subtly began talking with us after she got us some beers and took our order.  Through casual conversation Tracy was able to identify what things we had in common and have genuine and engaging interaction with us.  

After an hour or so of beers, pizza, and great service we had to go, but I would make the trip from Summerlin again for the same experience.

It's a bit costly for pizza but it's that gourmet pizza trend. In this case, I think you do get what you pay for, so it's on our list when we want to go out and have pizza.

I probably wouldn't take my kids here, though.

1093224,2015-04-22,1,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"Well, let me first start by saying my dinner last night at this place was me giving this place a second chance.   The first time I went I ordered my pizza with light sauce,   when my pizza arrived it had sauce oozing all over it.  The server was quite apologetic and offered me something else or to have the pizza remade, but I was with others and I didn't want to make them wait so I just opted to not eat.

So round two with this this place was even more traumatizing!   We arrived to wait for hostess to come up front because she was yakking it up with  the servers by the kitchen area.   We were seated in a little side room where we were pretty much ignored but I did get a good feel for the atmosphere.  After about 10 mins, waiting Server #1 strolled by and asked if we had been helped.   He gave me his name and took our drink and food order.  I once again mentioned I wanted light sauce on the pizza, no onions in my salad, and just a water w/lemon to drink.  Someone else brought our drinks and there was no lemon in the water so I asked Server # 2 for the lemon and he assured me he would bring back.  That never happened because a 3rd server brought our salads.   The salad was full of onions and so I did not eat it.  It sat on the edge of our table for about another 15mins until a 4th server brought our pizza.   The pizza was made correctly so I took a chance and asked this server for the lemon which he did return with and I gave him the salad and asked that he remove it from the bill because I couldn't eat it.

Through the meal no other servers ever checked on us.  In fact I had to flag down one just to get my daughter a drink refill.  The place was not very busy but yet all the Servers were clustered either by the kitchen or bar and everyone was laughing and joking amongst themselves, at one point I noted one Server swinging between the two counter areas.   I had to flag someone down again to get my pizza boxed and get my check.   I waited another 10 mins and no one ever came to get my check so I finally was annoyed and took the check to the front where once again the hostess was standing holding the front door open and chatting w/another employee and not at the hostess area.   

I usually leave at 20% tip at most places because I do understand how hard Servers work as I used to work for a restaurant company, but this time the only tip I left was a note on the check stating they needed to improve their customer service.   As for the food it's mediocre at best, nothing really stands out about it, so I most definitely will not give them a third chance.  Their customer service ruined it completely for me.  :(",Dl9EjZ1U7G0loCCcIzetkw,2,2,1,NMuTcyqG34LmiXDrcd3riQ

We couldn't come up with a good reason to drag a baby out to dinner when her bedtime was just minutes away, so my nephew suggested pizza.

We had red pepper and onion, and sun-dried tomato and something...I'm not a sun dried tomato fan.   Nephew asked if it had my seal of approval, and I mentioned it tasted like Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.   Then he showed me the box.  I was in heaven.  Only downside was, we were staying at a hotel with no refrigerator that I could cram the leftovers in.  I would have happily had a slice cold, for breakfast the next day.

Even though it was just my husband and I it is a very friendly family restaurant and atmosphere. I've dined here before but tonight's experience was amazing and I couldn't pass on writing a tremendous review. 

When leaving the hostess even opened the door for my husband and I & wished a nice evening!! The service, food and people are spectacular here and I will DEFINITELY return!",yIocBHO4LENleh6dtceepQ,0,0,5,Kqrnmu0UDV7YGO-CcLaZJQ

They have figured out the water issue by removing and adding minerals so the water is line NYC water, so the dough turns out right. The mozzarella cheese is delish and the space is nice. The cannoli for desert is just right!

1274138,2008-07-05,0,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"Being from NYC, I know pizza.  I grew up 1 block over from Little Italy and 3 blocks from Lombardi's.  I love italian food.

I love the thin crust, crispy, saucey, cheesey variety.  Grimaldi's in NYC is better than Vegas.  Pizza in NYC generally speaking tastes different than anywhere else.  Most pizzeria owners that I know back home, say its the water that makes it taste different, and I actually have to agree.  

Grimaldi's here make a great effort in providing NYC Style pizza.  The gf and I had a large pie with sweet red peppers, sausage and onions.  It's thin and crispy.  Saucey and cheesey however, it is not!  Seemed like they skimped on the sauce (which is their signature) and the cheese.  Especially, when the sauce and cheese are the main components of the pizza.  It was good, but not great.  Sadly, I left here unimpressed and missing NY a little more.

Atmosphere was good, they have an outdoor patio and full bar with a few flatscreens to watch the games.

Heard Giovanni's is better.  Will try Giovanni's next time I have a pizza craving.

All of the pizza toppings were a la carte, I wanted a vegetarian pizza and enjoy my company, instead I had a waitress staring me down... like I was wasting her time cause I had a hard time figuring out what vegetables to choose from... a large pizza with minimal toppings was $28. 

They forget our salad and spilled sauce on my friend. At the end of our evening we felt like we were being kicked out, even though they were open for another hour. I will never go back there and will definitely not recommend this place to anyone.",oarhjukgdkwQKa2rIr1uGg,0,0,1,ecb1IQ9Wz7JTCMPShO_AuA

Now don't get me wrong i love pizza; from the soggy microwaved, burn the roof of your mouth off to the crusty over cooked, kept warm by a heat lamp baseball pizzas. If it is made of bread, cheese and tomato sauce i am there, and i am one happy woman!!

But the pizzas at Grimaldi's well you could prop me up at the bar and keep feeding me slices of heaven until i burst like Mr Creosote (Monty Python reference there kids!!) I ordered a large (tomato sauce) pizza with mushrooms, fresh chopped tomatoes, roasted sweet red peppers and garlic...no meat for me folks sorry!! Also a caprasie (also known as a tri-colour) salad for an appetizer and a small house salad to go with my pizza.

The Caprasie salad ($7) was perfect to share and came with the dinkiest pieces of bread to top with basil, Roma tomatoes and home made mozzarella..yummy! The small house salad ($5) was again more than enough to share between two people and really complimented the pizza, the salad dressing was flavorful but didn't over power the dish.


And now we get to may favorite part the pizza, like i said i love pizzas, but this one has topped my charts! The base was beautifully cooked, it was a good thin crust hand tossed kinda base, but it was still soft and amazingly fresh tasting. They had amazingly managed to make it completely uncracker like which most wood/coal fired pizza places seem to make their bases. The ""secret"" tomato sauce was sweet with just the right amount of herbs, not over powering that it makes your eyes water, but with a damn good flavour! The toppings...well the mushrooms were beautiful, not gritty and not so small that you couldn't find them; the fresh tomatoes were sweet and juicy, the sweet red peppers...oh my god they were amazing a slight spicy flavour enhanced by the sweet roasted yumminess of the peppers! Lastly the garlic, wow wee it's a good thing I'm sitting here by myself as wow i can still taste the garlic and it's been a loooooong time since i ate it!

Well all in all it was a great experience, the total bill came to $50, and this included a half carafe of pg and 2 large glasses or Perioni beer.

So the down side, yes it did take FOREVER for the food to get served, yes the wait staff was not the jolliest i have ever encountered.....but for me the food totally makes up for it! 

So on my recommendation, go to Grimaldi's order the pizza, salad, beer or wine...and just remember to carry a book and a bag of pretzels to tie you over until the really food comes out, because ladies and gentlemen it is totally worth waiting for!",0_dLB7aYv_yCRg13g3cs0g,1,1,5,uJYykuH7HYvOGEvYW8jkBw
1276838,2017-07-21,0,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"So we ended up here because the link at the Mexican grille next door was too long. My husband recently had his wisdom teeth pulled, so we were hoping to find some pasta instead of just pizza. Unfortunately, it was only a pizza place, but it smelled good so we stayed. We ordered the caprese appetizer. It came with tomatoes that were hard and unripe. The cheese and basil were good, but the server brought the oil and vinegar, instead of it having any type of balsamic vinaigrette for dressing. We asked for it, but she seemed perplexed. Finally got that. Ordered a 16-inch pizza (they come with a thin crust) with onions and mushrooms. The pizza arrived quickly, probably because it was undercooked. We were surprised to see the crust on the outside was done, but underneath the toppings, the dough was raw. The mushrooms had zero flavor, as did the sauce, and the cheese was minimal and also flavorless. The onions were cut in too large pieces, and also seemed to have zero taste. We showed our server that it wasn't done, and she said it's because of the mushrooms. Really? I have mushrooms on pizza all the time, and the dough is never raw. I'm also kind of amazed she didn't tell a manger to come to our table who might address the issue. The server was nice, but might have been new because she was kind of clueless.

Ate some of the toppings but left all the crust. We ordered the blueberry cheesecake for dessert, and it was actually good.

Needless to say, we won't be back here. Joey's pizza up the hill on Eastern is WAY better, or just go to Pizza Rev where you can get exactly what you want for a great price and taste. 

Not sure how this place got such good reviews on Yelp.


NOTE: I was contacted by the manager regarding our bad experience and was offered complimentary meals to try again, which we will do in the future. I won't amend this review yet.

It is the fact that it's become a melting pot to some of the nation's best food.  Next door you'll find a frozen custard place imported from Utah.  You could also find some of the most popular burger places from NYC and Cali.  But what got me excited was the fact that at Grimaldi's, I could have New York's best pizza on the west coast!

In Vegas they actually have three locations.  I chose this location because of its proximity to my hotel and because of it's late hours (it closed at midnight on Saturday night).

What I loved about Grimaldi's in New York was its amazing crust, is fresh tomato sauce, and its fresh ingredients.  It was just perfect.

For my visit to this Vegas location, I ordered a Margherita pizza with garlic and  a pesto pizza with chicken and tomato.  Both pizzas were winners.  I love the pizza dough - it's chewy and it has a nice sweet flavor.  The margherita is a personal favorite of mine - I just love the simple flavor and the perfect balance of the tomato sauce, cheese, and basil.

My only gripe is that the pizza was that I felt that the crust could have been cooked a little more.   I can't really tell you with certainty how this compares to NYC, but I can tell you with certainty that I was so glad to have some legit NY pizza on the west coast.  Definitely give Grimaldi's a shot if you're not able to go to Brooklyn.  There are two locations west of the strip and there's a 3rd location at the mall that's across the strip from the Wynn Hotel.",0hMC8tPtc_K_ACAj7pss_Q,1,0,4,7L-7k0XwPTmoXRM981V2DA

I'm used to it now and I'm prepared to wait, so I guess that's a good thing since I'm extra hungry when the pizza comes.

1534649,2008-01-29,2,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"The name ""New York Pizza"" conjures up a predictable image in the heads of most people, and to those lucky enough, an intense and blissful memory.  This kind of pizza, large, floppy and often sold by the slice has been imitated in one way or another in every corner of the country to mixed results.  

But there is another sort of New York pizza that predates the style most (New Yorkers included) are familiar with. It's the kind of pizza made in a small handful of ancient pizzerias in New York city like Lomardi's, Grimaldi's and Totono's. It's thin crusted with a sweet tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan and/or romano, some dried oregano and fresh basil and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Mozzarella is used sparingly, about half as much as you'd expect. This is the style of the very first pizzas made in America by Neapolitan immigrants.  The distinguishing factor today is the once-common coal-fired brick oven running about 900 degrees that's capable of charring the crust before it browns the cheese.  The result is a striking palette of black, light brown, white, dark green and about five shades of red.

I've never been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, but I have been to Totono's. And this style, the so-called New York Neapolitan, was one I thought I could only score in NYC.  Through the magic of Yelp, I found this improbable outpost while looking for a hassle-free, off the strip locale for a family dinner. Problem is, I talk too much and felt the need to find a real gem.  This couldn't have been easier.  I was shocked to see that NYC's favorite pizzeria had franchised, but this looks like a small chain run by a nephew of the original owner, with his blessings, assistance and recipes.  

We were quickly seated through the help of a call-ahead quasi-reservation at the best table in the house, right next to the pizza prep station.  The pies were nearly flawless.  I went with extra basil and I sampled the pepperoni and sausage. There were six of us, all northeast natives, two of which have lived in Italy, and all of us ranked this as our favorite or near-favorite pizza ever.  Is it my favorite?  I'm not sure, but it's 2nd or third at worst.  It has to be the best in Vegas and it will be a mandatory stop every time I'm in town.

They don't have a line out the door yet, so check it out before the word spreads.  Service is attentive and polite, which isn't very ""East Coast"" of them, but that's one part of back home that I don't miss. Five mother-f'n stars.",kUz4S5fNAL7rRe0fWxm2Sw,11,5,5,ek6NRVgVTsEzGbk-SqYAAA

Located off of Eastern, you can't miss their signage.  This already busy area doesn't have a lot of parking to accommodate what could be.  It's very hectic in and out so be ready for that.  

Walking up to the door, the welcoming hostess opened the door and escorted us in.  The staff here were all very polite and courteous.  Our server Alex was amazing.  He was attentive with a fun personality.  

I decide to try their Caesar Salad and Calzone.  The salad was tasty and large for a small salad.  I loved the fresh shaved parmesan and cracked pepper. Delicious.  

I opted to stuff the calzone with spinach and mushrooms.  They really did a great job using fresh and plenty of ingredients inside.  Ricotta is one of their normal ingredients used inside so you don't have to order it extra.  Nice! Their dipping sauce on the side gave it a great flavor that I'm sure I'll be back for.

I'm Italian. I'm a pizza freak. And I am very opinionated when it comes to my pizza. I generally like most pizza places, because I just love pizza.

I went here with 3 other people and was excited. They had the outside bar open (why the hell you would want to sit outside in 100+ degrees, I don't know). The waiter was hilarious, and very lucky that I love all kinds of humor and sarcasm. Most people would've found him to be offensive.

I loved the fact that they cook the pizzas in a traditional brick oven and hand toss their pizza dough.

The bread with olive oil/pepper/balsamic vinegar was rather horrible. I attribute it to the crappy olive oil and subpar bread (I hate to say it, but Macaroni Grill has the best). Something as simple as that turns me off.
We ordered two pizzas, each half and half.
I had pepperoni, garlic, basil on the side, and fresh tomatoes. The basil was not fresh, it was brown and bitter.

Something very important to know about their pizza is that their ""pizza sauce"" has NO SPICES whatsoever. It's plain ol' tomato. That's why it's important to get the extra toppings. That's how they make their money. Each topping is $2+. I'm sorry, but I love my spices.

We make sure to go here every time we visit Las Vegas. One last thing that made me enjoy this restaurant even more.

So when I got home I got a cold pizza with very sparse toppings, not much mozzarella, sauce that was way to sweet and crust was lame and too much of it, not a good representation of a Northeast pizza.

I ordered a Caesar Salad and the Veggie Pizza. The Caesar was fine, it's the pizza that was so disappointing. The pizza was soggy in the middle.

Parking is pretty good during non-rush hour, but it can be difficult to find one when they are busy. Also, they do share their parking space with Café Rio and a dessert place. 

Ambiance (5/5):
This restaurant has the perfect ambiance of a NYC pizzeria. It's always busy and customers are always chatty. It's loud and during some game nights patrons at the bar area can get bit loud. But as I said before, it reminds me a lot best pizzerias in NYC. 

Service (5/5)
Service is excellent at this Grimaldi's; from waiters to bartender, you are treated with a smile. They would also make proper suggestions on if you trying to venture into exotic toppings area. They keep their pizza in the oven if you running late to pick it up, which keeps the pizza hot and fresh until you get home. This is the best way to do a takeout.   

Food (5/5)
This is the best pizzeria I've been to in Henderson or LV. I believe that this might be the best Grimaldi's location in NV. Every time I'm craving a pizza I come here to get my favorite custom pizza. I get their large pizza with marinara, pesto sauce (w/ olive oil), meatballs, and extra cheese. It usually lasts me for 2 days and tastes exactly same when you re-heat it the next day in an oven. Other item that I love to eat at this place is their caprese salad; it's fresh, flavourfull and light. Their cheese is not to chewy and it literally dissolved in your mouth. My mouth is watering just writing about it. 
Their desserts are excellent as well, I would highly recommend blueberry cheesecake. 

Overall (5/5), I think that this is the best pizzeria for me until I've been to other famous places in LV for proper comparison. If you can look over minor parking issues then you will love this place.",kwIhn1_cnQeUaLN0CuWWHw,3,0,5,Ro5ysXOoU5tqGwYERzaDtQ

Generally, I dislike going to any restaurant located inside a hotel on the strip because the traffic, parking, and combined walking distance is inconvenient.  The Palazzo is a nice higher end hotel so going here made it a bit more tolerable.  The restaurant itself lets you feel like you are having dinner outside, this was nice.  

We ordered the antipasto, spinach salad, and The Don pizza (pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs).  The thin crust pizza is cooked under intense heat for a short time in their brick oven, to me it tastes like your standard Napoli style pizza - they're okay but I don't like the way the crust is always burnt.  If you're a fan of Chicago style pan pizza then this place may not be for you.  My wife on the other hand just loved it and said it was the best pizza she ever had.  It was good - tangy tomato sauce, melted cheese, and that slightly salted meat taste hit the spot.  We also enjoyed the spinach salad because it came with other healthy stuff like crispy bacon and Gorgonzola cheese.   The antipasto was good as well - hard to go wrong with cold cuts, sliced cheese, olives, and jarred red peppers on a plate.  This paired well with their bread, olive oil, and vinegar for dipping.  I later learned that this restaurant is available in 5 other locations, we'll be sure to bookmark the locations off the strip the next time we are in Las Vegas.",tMu-ymSmfx1Ef6yjdjRndg,0,0,4,13J6ml5JwmIedZRPPAulXg

Okay, not a big deal as food is more important but they're out of a beer we chose and they didn't even offer a suggestion. We ordered a large pizza and got two toppings (sausage and mushrooms). I could literally count all the sausage toppings and mushrooms were just as sparse. For a place that charges by the topping, we felt ripped off! 
Service wasn't that much better. The table nearby had more food and drinks and could tell they got better service the entire time because of it. Ridiculous for the party of two! 
By the time we are almost half the pizza, it became rubbery and impossible to cut with a fork and knife, bleh! We had one slice left over and decided to get it to go.

My previous, less fabulous review was for the location in Henderson, this one is for the newly opened south west location.
BTW, they still can't touch Metro!

One more thing, this pizza is best when eaten at the restaurant. I ordered take out once and I do not reccomend it. You lose the crispiness of the crust and it turns a bit soggy.

Pizza - we made a custom small pizza. We added ricotta cheese, pepporoni, and fresh garlic.  The pizza was delicious, dough chewy, and dripping with oil. Just how i like my NY style pizza.

As this was going on, the staff kept apologizing,  gave us countless orders of free bread, gave my husband a free beer, all because we were waiting patiently. 4 tables left that I counted because everyone was pissed. Well after a while oven was working and everyone including the manager busted ass and got all the pizzas out. We got ours and it tasted great.

Luckily there were a couple of open tables for us, since we didn't have a reservation, which I would recommend if you don't get there early because the line of people waiting for tables got longer and longer while we were there enjoying our meal. In fact when we left around 8pm, there was still a line.

We started with your standard pepperoni and sausage pizza, and then we ordered a specialty white pizza (I can't remember the name), which is supposed to taste like a cheese steak. I liked the pepperoni and sausage pizza better than the specialty one. Although it did taste pretty good, I think that there was way too much cheese on top and it made the pizza taste a little dry and marshmallow-y.

After finishing two large pizzas, it still was not enough. So we ordered a pesto pizza with chicken and garlic. This pizza tasted really good and had tons of chicken on it and maybe just a little too much pesto. The pizzas here are thin crust, and it's a lot easier to fold each slice to eat it. I really liked that there was a bit of a crunch to the crust.

So our waitress was a little too anxious to clear our plates. I think this might be because they were so busy and probably wanted to try to clear the tables quicker so they could seat the people waiting for a table. She did check up on us often to make sure we had enough food and that everything was ok. 

Now here is where the 5 stars comes in. One of the guys in our group couldn't finish his slice of pizza, so he asked her to box it up for him. As we were about to leave, he asked her if she had the pizza. When she went back to the kitchen to get it, apparently someone had thrown it out instead of boxing it up for our friend. She informed the manager about what happened and the manager offered to either make a personal size pizza for our friend, or give us a complimentary slice of cheesecake.

Of course we took the cheesecake and got the plain cheesecake with raspberry sauce and it was heavenly!",ItgAvMKDuOODW-rvCMLp9Q,0,0,5,ii7Hn9MKyGApGBwaA9-s3A

So how did i try Grimaldi's?? Well, i was in a wedding on Friday and was busy all day from 9am-till after the reception ending at about 11:00pm, leaving the husband to fend for himself for the day!

I get a call about 4:00pm, ""honey, I have a surprise for you! Can i tell you what it is? Can i please???"" My reply ""No love, that would make it not be a surprise anymore, now i have something to look forward to...  I will get it when i see you!"" and due to the fact that i at this point have large hair, too much make-up on and am in a freezing cold reception room trying to get all the name cards placed on the tables and get the bride ready and keep her happy, while keeping the kids outta the way and clean in their flower girl dresses i am excited to have a surprise waiting for me when all is said and done!!!

Driving home after a beautiful wedding, the husband says... ""are you excited for your surprise? Can i give you a hint??""

""Yes dear, i am VERY excited for my surprise, lay it on me!"" 

""Remember what we wanted to try, but didnt want to give something else up for?""

I came home to half a pizza from Grimaldi's!!!!!!! :)

AAAaaahhhh, how cute!!

Ok, back to the review.. while it was cold and not pipping hot and fresh i few minutes of heating up, it was wonderful!!! Now, I cant wait to go get one and try it fresh, its WAY closer to the house than Settebello's is and now I am willing to give it a try and vier away at least once!

So for now 4 stars, and if this location is closer or better for you than Settebello's is (at least for now till they move next to Whole Food's in The District) it is a fair trade off, or even if you want to go crazy and mix it up a bit!!!

So I've had NY pizza before...huge honking slices where folding is not just what the cool kids do, it's necessary to not give yourself a Chelsea grin while eating.  These slices are a bit more manageable in size...and much better tasting, in my opinion.

I looked forward to the white pizza we got, but I discovered they really load the ricotta on if that's what you order...and too much ricotta just doesn't sit well with me.  It tasted good, but it felt like my mouth was being stuffed with foam.

The mushroom, pepperoni, and sun-dried tomato pizza...now this was par excellence.  Even ignoring that sun-dried tomatoes may be my #1 condiment of all time (even beating out giardiniera), the crust was good, and the light sauce let the toppings shine.

We were the leading edge of the dinner crowd so no problem getting preferred seating indoors.  Quick attention by Anthony, our capable, informative and entertaining server.  When we declared our ""first time visitor"" status, he patiently explained the three different styles of pizza, the salads, and ""Oh, yes, we have calzone too!"" 

We settled on a split medium, 1/2 ham/pepperoni and 1/2 pesto & jalapeno & basil (can you tell which one is the meat eater?).  Anthony wisely paired our selection with a Pinot Noir from Italy that matched perfectly.  So much so, we trusted him and got the bottle to finish at the castle (home).

Pizza is like sex, it's never bad unless you don't give it a chance.  And in this case, this was one of THE BEST PIZZA's I've ever had.

I almost faltered and finished my 1/2 of the pizza which would have left me too stuffed.

But, I exhibited massive amounts of discipline and saved one slice for later consumpiton and ordered the heralded cheesecake (with two forks 'cuz I'm that kind of date).  Oh My GOSH!!!  This stuff should be on the front page of the Review Journal.  Seriously!  I'm not a big fan of sweets, but I can appreciate a near perfect taste when given the chance.  Presentation = 10, texture = 10, taste = 10 and memory = 10.  Well done, Grimaldi's!!

Before we left, we had the chance to give our thanks and kudos to Gino for having such an awesome place.  So maybe it took three years to finally try this place, it won't take very long before our next visit.  Well done everyone!",59PQtA5xOOGhbb0Hj_Q4AQ,1,0,5,y3pd3tGQIG_pwvMSUM3Xug

She loved it (ended up getting some at Total Wine after dinner) and I had the house Bloody Mary, which uses pizza sauce instead of tomato juice, and garnished with pepperoni, cherry tomato, basil, and olives, VERY good. We started with Antipasto which was excellent!  For our pizza order, she had the gluten free Margherita, and I had the Margherita minus the basil, add kalamata olives. Now, mind you.. we are becoming pizza snobs, and are now on a mission to try the best of the best in Las Vegas. It will take a LOT to knock this pizza out of the top place, in my books. Not only was the pizza out of this world, the ambience, even being on a busy Friday night was just what we were hoping for. The service we received from Chelsea was impeccable!!!!  She was beyond helpful, and just a real sweetheart!  We will be asking for her every time we go back, without hesitation. I truly cannot think of anything bad to say about this place. To those of you who are saying this pizza wasn't good, it was too thin, it was too this, too that....  I'm telling you right now, Dominos, and Papa Johns..... IS NOT REAL PIZZA!!!!!  Say that over, and over in your head until you start to understand it. 

We finished the evening with dessert, which is something that we NEVER do, and boy am I glad we did!  We shared a piece of butterscotch toffee cheesecake, and it did not disappoint one bit!  Paired that with a cup of amazing cappuccino, and I was one happy, happy man. Now, the food is not terribly cheap, but I have zero problem paying good money for good food, and even better service, and that's just what we got. I've paid more for worse food, and worse service. 

If you happen to read this Chelsea, please know that we thoroughly  enjoyed our night, thanks to you and Grimaldi's. And we will take your advice and come back on a weeknight when it's less busy!  And the little tip about the certain time of day to get the best tasting pizza, we'll keep that to ourselves :-) Thank you again, and we'll see you real soon!",1oV4mY3GnNOZmGq8IYYL1w,1,0,5,BEk6yFn4Ets1yLfODMsgwg

This describes my relationship with Grimaldi's for the last year or so. On my first visit, customer service was on point, the pizza was cooked perfectly, and I couldn't have been happier. Aaahhh, those were the days. 

A few nights ago, my family and I thought we would try to renew that spark with Grimaldi's. Instead, we were treated with unevenly cooked pizza (kind of doughy, yet burnt in some spots) and so-so service. Every topping other than cheese is additional $2.00, so the bill adds up quick. Add in the $2.50 per soft drink, and I was starting to feel like the meal just wasn't worth it. 

The caprese salad as an appetizer was a great start to our meal-although it could have used a little salt. The crust is so thin that the pizza gets cold fast - so eat quickly.

I wish I could give Grimaldi's three stars because the food was good, they have a nice patio, and an outside bar. The service was not good, but I chalk it up to poor training.  I never saw a manager or anyone who appeared to be in charge, so I am reluctant to place the blame squarely on the wait staff.

WHY: If you're craving legit New York style pizza, this is the place to be!

WHAT: I never thought for once that I would be able to taste the difference between pizzas until I came here.  For years, I've always thought that pizza was just pizza! Little did I know, pizza here is beyond Little Caesar's!

I am a part of a charity, and we actually held a charity event here a few months ago, and it was the first time I've ever stepped foot into this place. I mean, I've seen it around, but never got to trying it.  Let me tell you! The entire staff including the manager were all wonderful, accommodating, and super friendly!  They had plenty of recommendations (Everthing was basically recommended, and I'm going to have to agree!)

Note: It is all thin-crust goodness! From the classic sauce, to the white sauce, all the way to the pesto sauce-- all G double O D = GOOD! There is also a list of toppings you may choose from (tomatoes, mushroom, SUN DRIED TOMATOES, anchovies, and the list goes on), and also different sizes of pizza. I'd recommend the biggest one (you know, so you can save the rest for later. You gotta strategize!!). So about the pizza, I'll leave it at that. Now it's your turn to try it!

Now onto the desserts! I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but I'll definitely eat a slice here! There is a variety to choose from as well (RECURRING THEME: so many to choose from, all so GOOD)! I have personally tried the oreo cheesecake (I highly recommend), original NY style, and the pumpkin cheesecake... which were all just perfection melting in my mouth! Yes, melt it does. The consistency of the cheesecake is just so perfect, probably why I'll only like cheesecake here at Grimaldi's!! Aside from the cheesecake, you must try the cannoli!!! JUST DO IT!

FUN FACT: Grimaldi's has a unique water system, where their water comes directly from NY, to get that authentic NY style pizza. DID I GET YOU NOW??...

Bring on the Grimaldis Margarita pizza!  They nailed it!  The slightly sweet Marinara sauce, thin sliced fresh mozzarella rounds and fresh basil leaves are the trio of flavors that define this pie.  

For those hailing from the Big Apple folding a slice is the only way you can walk and eat in the subway or as you rush to your next destination. When folded the end should not sag and drop its toppings if you're consuming a ""plain pie"".  It's survival 101.  Try it on your slice at Grimaldis...it passed the test.

My recent trip to Vegas was the second time I've been to this establishment.  It was on my punch-list since my last trip 2 years earlier.  My BW another couple and I shared a large freshly prepared house salad (easily enough for 4-6 hungry eaters), some draft brews and the large Margarita pie made up our dinner out.  Service was efficient and fast (perhaps too fast since we were still passing the salad bowl around when the pie came).  The dining space was a little noisier than I like but, when the pizza arrived, no one needed to talk.  The pizza disappeared rapidly and I easily could have taken down another slice without much encouragement.  A TOTALLY enjoyable dinner for 4 under $50 is hard to come by in Vegas. 

Oh yes, before we left Sin City a week later we went back for a 2nd time.  That's something to say in a town filled with wall to wall restaurants!",JBAtw3RhecpQfuisalVDdA,2,1,5,VQRRNLwuCQthoO3_Prm1PA

My server Rena did quite a good job selling me on the Chocolate Chessecake that I ordered one to go.   I think I left fat, (almost drunk-but-not- quite) & very happy.  I was left alone to read my Kindle, attended to so I never had to ask...and generally enjoyed my solitude in a very bustling but fun atmosphere.

Today's visit was to Grimaldi's Pizzeria.
I was craving pizza and decided to call in to go.

I called Grimaldi's and Junnie(I think that's her name) answered the phone. Very polite woman. 
Here is what I ordered:
Small size pizza
Half pesto and Half white 
I added some toppings to both sides.
Junnie repeated the order back to me and told me that she will give me a call back to tell me the total.

20 minutes later.... Still no call back.
So I politely called back and asked if maybe they forgot and I didn't mind(maybe they were busy)?

Junnie answered the phone and apologized that she forgot to call back. Then I asked her if I should be on my way to pick up the pizza and she said it should be ready already sincere she already placed the order 15 minutes ago -___-

I got there and a worker opened the door
For me(thank you)

I waited by the to go order area and this lady said;
""What's the name for the order?""
Me: ""Karen""
Her: okay your total is $38.92
Me: sounds good, by any chance do you have any ranch? 
Her: we don't have that here 
Me: oh.... Okay
Her: have a great day.

What annoys me the most is that she just
Left me with no options. WHERE IS YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE!?

Now on to the actual pizza.
PIEOLOGY sh*ts on this place.
 Check out the video and pictures attached to this review.

Took a bite out of the white pizza and the crust is so hard and you can taste the char. The bottom of the pizza is burned and not moist, very dry.


I am so sad because I love food and this place received great reviews and I did not enjoy this place at all. I'm sorry I'm not coming back...

We came at the end of lunch so it was pretty empty. We were greeted by a lovely lady who sat us down and went over the menu with us after we said it was our first time.

Our server came by shortly after and once again went over the menu with us. Menu is definitely short and sweet into the point. He walked us through the beverage menu and we ordered a couple of sangrias. 

A few minutes later my friend ordered one small pizza for herself and I ordered one for myself as well. We decided to share a small house salad also. We were surprised by his reaction when we ordered two small pizzas. As soon as they came out we knew why.

The pizzas are huge for being small. And the price that you pay for them is pretty phenomenal. I chose to start off with a traditional white pizza. White sauce with mozzarella and garlic and I had a bacon and pepperoni. She went with the margarita pizza. Both were 5/5.

My pizza came out first and unfortunately then put it in wrong. But both the manager and the server apologized. He told me I could have add it but that my pizza that I ordered was coming right behind it. I finished two slices of the mistaken pizza and it was phenomenal. My friend had two slices of her own. 

When my pizza, the one that I originally ordered, came out it was worth the wait. Had two slices of that one. We were completely stuffed. The service was impeccable. Very attentive. Everybody was surprised that we never been there before.

At the end of the meal they brought us out a complementary Oreo cheesecake. Cheesecakes are made in house. That was also a 5/5. 

We ate most of the cheesecake and got boxes for our pizzas. We had leftovers for about two days. I have to say that the attentiveness and the level of customer service of this place made it go from a 10 to a 10+.

----That was just the tip^^---

I was going to wait to review this place, but I can't. I'm so infuriated I could scream. We walked into Grimaldi's (Mind you, this was my very first time here) and while we were approaching the hostess, I saw her roll her eyes at my kids. LISTEN-- If you can't handle the service industry... BEAT IT! I worked every role in the restaurant business for years, including upper management. That's not how your greet guests. (Especially ones that Yelp!!)
The night was NOT starting off well at all. 

She asks us ""how many?"" and said that there was a 25 minute wait. That was fine for us. We told her that we didn't mind eating outside if that helped. She QUICKLY replies ""There's NO room to sit outside"".... Really? I see two open tables and a large table of 6-8 people with to-go boxes on their laps. She obviously didn't want to take another table. 

Now I'm irritated. I hate liars. I hate mean people, and I hate LAZY employees!  

We got sat about 10 minutes later. Our waiter, ""AJ"" was nice, he took our app and drink orders. Not to my surprise he screws that up. We ordered red sangria, he brought white. It wasn't a big deal, but I was already annoyed from all the prior attitude. We really should have left, but the kids were hungry and it's a school night.

We quickly order two pizzas and crossed our fingers that our night was about to get better. 

... Little did we know that it would get worse...

AJ, our waiter, came back a few minutes later with a red sangria in hand, apologizing for the confusion. (Ok, good work there)


After that we sat there for another hour, watching all of the tables (that arrived after us) get served their pizza! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? An hour for pizza? The waiter kept saying  that it was coming. Our kids were hungry, getting antsy and I was really annoyed. 

The manager came over and said our pizza was just about up. My husband told him what happened and how we have been sitting for an hour. What did the manager reply? He said we've only been there for 25 minutes!!! HOW DARE YOU?? I said ""Really? here's my Yelp and FB check-ins showing the timestamps""...... He knew he was caught out there and said our pizzs was next and he'd try to help work out the bill. ----GEE Thanks. You basically call my husband and I liars, make your business look horrible, then just ""try' to make up for it? I told my husband I wanted to leave. We only stayed because we were curious what was going to happen next. 

Another 5-7 minutes go by, and our pizza arrives. Just ONE of them lol. I explained to the waiter that I am a Brooklyn born Italian and NO freaking pizza is worth an hour wait. He didn't really have much of a reaction.

Our second Pizza came another 2 minutes later. I take a bite... and to complete the WORST pizza story EVER.... IT WAS BURNT! Not crispy, not well done, outright pitch black burnt. It tasted like charcoal. We told the waiter we were done and over it and wanted to leave. 

He brings over the bill, the manager took $33.50 off of the $95.00 bill. 

We paid and left.

NEVER EVER AGAIN! First and last time.

We usually order a Mediterranean salad and a small pizza with meatballs and mushrooms. Yes small because the pies are huge.  This pizza place has several locations over the united states.

We ordered a small caesar salad to share, yes share, yes a small ($7).  A perfect portion for two.  The dressing was zesty, ample, and quite addicting.  The croutons were fresh, large, and crispy (but not jaw breaking).  The lettuce was fresh and green.  The parmesan was good but the stuff that was factory shredded, not freshly shaved.  I'm a sucker for freshly shaved parm, you know the stuff that resembles potato chips.  Regardless, the bf will be picking up a random caesar salad after work for me to chow down on.

The pizza was quite delightful!  Their crust is thin and flaky with very good flavor.  Their sauce gets two thumbs up for not being overpowering or chunky, like some of these pizza joints tend to get a little over zealous about.  And the cheese, oh the cheese...it's freshly made mozzarella!  Each pizza gets thin slices of this freshly made mozzarella!  Therefore, when your pizza is presented, it almost glows because the mozzarella is a beautifully brilliant white!  Grimaldi's uses some delicious toppings too, if you so choose to garnish your pie.  Instead of the traditional size pepperonis, they use miniature sized ones.  I think it makes the pepperoni pie easier to eat, but that's just my opinion.

The ambiance of the Eastern Ave. Grimaldi's is quite charming, even for being in a strip mall.  We here in Las Vegas are lucky to have such beautiful weather pretty much year round, therefore open air bistros like Grimaldi's are a gem on such gorgeous days/nights.  The layout of the restaurant is well-thought out.  Their bar is two-sided.  One side being for the patio, and the other side for the indoor bistro--kind of ingenious!  Let it be known, the bar does have draught beer on tap (Peroni, Blue Moon, Blue Moon Pumpkin, and a few others).  The wine menu is geared more towards everyday wines (most bottles under $50).  They have an assortment of reds, whites, blushes available by the glass and bottle.   Liquorwise, they are limited to basics, Bombay Sapphire, Three Olives Vodka, 1800, J.W. Black Label, Jack, etc.  So just remember when you order your cocktail, this is NOT an ultra lounge.  So don't be a snob just because they may not carry your favorite liquor, suck it up and try something different!

I had a blast at Grimaldi's, not because of the bottle of Riesling or bottle of Pinot Noir, but because of being surrounded by good food, good ambiance, good service, and great company!",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,4,2,5,lQOOueD8rFKYxPDFf7buUw

First time trying Grimaldis today and WOW! I left very impressed. The service was top notch and attentive. The waiter was very patient in explaining all the different styles and options you have to choose from with the pizzas. We settled on a large with chicken and cheese on top (3 of us). The pizza had so much flavor! All 3 of us tore that pie apart in no time! It never stood a chance! ;)

Our drinks never reached the bottom before quickly being refilled. The prices were fair and definately well worth it for the product you recieved!

Only negative at all in the whole experience was that when we were finished, the server asked us twice if we wanted desert, which we politely declined. We than waited for our bill....and waited. It wasn't a ""Burger-Dog-ish"" time wait...but it was starting to become a bit frustrating until a sweet lady swooped in and sped things up a bit. By no means a deal breaker, as we will certainly be back in the near future, especially when out of town relatives are visiting!

I recently discovered Grimaldi's and I think it's about to become one of my go-to dinner destinations.  It's a bit on the pricey side for the pie - it's not the place if you're looking for a cheap date - but when you're in the mood to gab with your friends over wine, beer, salads, and thin crust pizza, check this place out.

The salads are meant to be shared.  I like the feel of that.  I do love a good salad, but the pizza is what drew me back after my first visit.  The crust is nice and thin, with a slight chewy bite.  It's often a little charred around the edges, which I adore.  The cheese is thinly sliced fresh mozzarella.  It's subtle, with a hint of sweet, and even though mozz generally lacks flavor, there is something about this chewy white melty cheesy goodness that makes me say ""mmm"".  I really like how they smoosh up the Kalamata olives so that the little crushed pieces are splattered all over the pizza.

Plus, they feature some local brews.  I enjoyed my pie with a Tenaya nut brown tonight.  Yay for supporting locals!  I think the biggest drawback is the lack of price breaks for topping combos.  Four toppings can cost you the price of the base pie, yowzahs.  At this Eastern Ave location there is some lovely outdoor seating (although I can think of better ambiance than Eastern Ave, but you can only ask for so much here in Hendertucky), and I find the indoor ambiance rather pleasant.  I've experienced nothing but friendly service.  It's a great place to grab a bite and a drink with a friend, and you'll leave with satisfied tastebuds and your stomach not overflowing with grease.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,2,1,4,CGfrxYNj7Ji_J9Y3QJP8og

The hostess was amazing! She remembered my name up until the moment we walked out (impressive). Typically, service is decent. However, after tonight, I feel compelled to write this review. Our waitress was Stephanie. She started out good, chatted with us about opening the bottle of wine, then when she was done, I asked her to bring us some silverware. She never did remember to bring the silverware. I had to get up and go to the hostess stand, after the salad arrived, to get my own. Then when the pizza came, she took my dirty plate but took a while to come back with the new plate. After finishing my first piece without a plate, we had to flag her down to get the plate (she forgot that too). At one point, she asked, ""did they ever offer you oregano or garlic""? We were thinking, 'who are THEY, isn't she our server'? When we answered, ""no,"" she never did ask if we'd like some, then turned and walked away. She also never refilled the water.

We completed a comment card and took it to the hostess stand and asked that it be delivered to the manager. We saw our waitress run over to read it, along with the rest of the girls at the hostess stand.

Will I go back again: Yes! I do love the food. I'm hoping; however, that service gets better. Being in the Las Vegas area, there is a lot of competition, so one would think attention to detail is important.",bN0vGcEIWCwUi2NWi6scEA,1,1,4,M1LMN3_4h5iF5E5vVOf7bg

I have driven past this place a million times, but never ventured in because there are plenty of places to eat on Eastern Avenue without hitting up a cross country pizza chain. When in Henderson, on a Friday night, after eleven, the pickin's are slim and I was tired. I was ""pizza chained"" into submission. 

I came in, bellied up to the bar, and ordered a Goose Island and Caesar salad. While perusing the menu for pizza options my salad quickly came and it was good. I mean it's a Caesar salad, with fresh lettuce and solid dressing. You really have to try hard to mess up a Caesar salad. 

I ordered a personal pizza (12in) with ricotta, sausage, basil, black olives, with a pesto drizzle. This pizza was very good and also came out fast and fresh. The crust was crispy and the ricotta was the perfect addition to the marinara and pesto collaboration. This was plenty of pizza for one person and the perfect sharing size. 

I like the fact that I can build my own pie and the process was mostly painless. Good pizza, not amazing, but I would come back for the service and the beer selection.

2999479,2013-09-29,0,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"Summary: True NY style pizza, crispy and holds up to the old NYC pizza test: ""hold slice with one hand and if it does not slump over or require a second hand than the crust was created and cooked perfectly!""

In depth: being from NY the lady and myself are slight pizza snobs. Grimaldi's on Eastern has always delivered a solid pie that reminds us of back home. See people complaining about the crust and I think they are simply uneducated. The crisp and darkened crust is the way this ""coal oven"" pie is served. That coal oven taste is transferred into the crust and gives it amazing consistency and flavor. This is not the Albanian owned knock off pizza parlors that most Vegas locals have grown accustomed to eating. 

I like to add the Ricotta Cheese, fresh tomatoes and sausage to my pie. I also like artichokes and think they make a decent topping along with olives. 

The Caprese salad here is the bomb. I like to add salami for an additional $2 more (see my pics). 

I only removed a star for two reasons: 1) the cost seems a little too high for pizza. It tastes good and I am a customer, I only feel like we would go more if it was priced appropriately. 2) service can be spotty when you eat in. Had to get up and track down our waitress last night to take our order. 

Lastly, Grimadi's makes for great left over cold pizza. Make sure you take a couple slices home for cold pizza breakfast the next day!",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,0,0,4,WaLERPPTy30xT25FDSjhYg

Vegas is not known for having great pizza, especially off the strip, which is why it's to the fortune of Vegas diners that we have an authentic pizza import from Brooklyn.

I'm a fan of crispy crust with a coal brick-oven toasty taste, thus Grimaldi's crust is probably one of my favorite.  The house sauce is flavorful, not overwhelming.  For a treat, I always order the pesto sauce, which tastes of fresh basil every time.  Their meaty toppings (sausage, pepperoni, etc.) are very good so if you are a traditional pizza eater, I suggest the sausage with roasted sweet peppers.  The only drawback is: toppings are $2-$4 each so the price can stack up quickly for a regular-ingredients pie.

However, if you're in the mood for a different palette, order the pesto sauce with ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, and grilled chicken.  I find that this combination puts together an absolutely delicious gourmet pizza seldom found elsewhere.  Fresh basil pesto, slightly sweet & lavish ricotta, top-quality sun-dried tomatoes, and tender grilled chicken always win me over at first bite.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,3,2,4,kqt2DDz7paYVzloL-OKC5g

What I do care about is I tasted the glory in their white sauce pizza with sausage. It was garlicky, it was crispy and slightly chewy and just the right amount of every ingredient. I would have liked a little more fresh Basil, but that is the story of my life. The sausage was savory and spicy without overpowering the other ingredients.This pizza was just what I needed and I have even almost gone back. I know, it's insane.

Downfalls. Because you know I gots sum;)

1. Loud, loud, loud. I'm not sure if it's because of the flooring or brick walls, but I could not think it was so terribly loud and it gave me extreme anxiety. My hearing is better than most so imagine being able to hear twenty conversations at once. Yeah, bad news bears. Next time I return I will be wearing headphones.

2. Bright lights. Pet peeve is bright lights in a restaurant in the evening. I don't need to see or hear the fifty kids fondling their raw dough, wasting the parm on the table and pretending to make their own za. I also don't need to see my date's pores. Ever.

3. 4pm. Whatever you do 4pm is not the time to come to Grimaldi's. They do something to the oven at that time for about 20-30 minutes and you cannot get a pizza. Instead you have to eat a boring salad with a bitter dressing and stare at each other. You can't talk because you can't hear each other over the noise. I really think the chef might just be celebrating 4:20p everyday getting erie mon. Whatever he did my pie tasted like a million bucks so keep on keepin on Chef pizza dude. 

Will I return? Oh hellz yeah. Just for the Large White Sauce with Garlic and Sausage and extra Basil pie. Kudos Grimaldi's for redeeming yourself. I am feelin' you big time. Until we meet again my new white saucy friend.",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,14,11,3,4ABawKdc1TX2t9lACD5npA

Friends of mine who lived in Vegas wanted to take me to Grimaldi's while I was in town last month. I have to say I was impressed!! We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday night and it was busy, so busy I thought there would be at least a 20-30 minute wait but I was wrong we got a table right away. Our table was located right in front of the kitchen were the guys were making the pizza's. When I sat down and saw the brick-oven pizza's coming out of the oven I knew I was in for a treat!! They were thin crusted topped with fresh ingredients and a brickoven/coal bottom. 

We started off with the cold antipasti platter. Italian meats, cheeses, olives and fresh foccacia bread. Your typical cold antipasti platter, you can't go wrong. 

For dinner we ordered a Large pizza; half with pesto, pepperoni and onions and the other half; tomato sauce, sausage, mushrooms, artichokes and olives. They both were great! I would have to say the tomato, veggies and sausage side was my favorite however I really enjoyed the mini peperoni's that were on the other size, usually its large slices of pepperoni. 

Grimaldi's also has a great wine selection. Since my friends are regulars the server was kind enough to offer me help on selecting a glass of white wine and even brought me out a few samples! 

The restaurant is a fun, casual atmosphere with bar half inside and half outside with outside seating. Perfect for a warm but cool Vegas night! I would definitely recommend checking this place out!",rPQB_TowgDibaEX8oXwxug,0,0,4,gleOjZ6gAO3XqdMNJkKOJA

This place is located on Eastern Avenue very conveniently close to 215 so it won't be hard to get there, and the restaurant does offer a few parking spaces that unfortunately tend to be occupied most of the time. The restaurant itself isn't so large, so you might have to wait to get seated depending on the time/day.

I had several different types of pizza there, and the pizzas were always fresh and decently but I would definitely have expected something better, particularly given the price of the pizza/toppings.

One good thing about this place is the atmosphere which is pretty nice, with the restaurant's decor participating quite greatly to it.

3303879,2013-09-07,4,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"I am not a pizza snob. To me Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominos, etc. is sufficient to satisfy my pie cravings. Thus I am usually hesitant to hit up actual pizza restaurants. Unless the place offers personal pizzas, you have to negotiate toppings with whoever you are sharing with. And I am sure we all have that friend who thinks anchovies is a must have. On top of that, pizza restaurants are comparably overpriced compared to their take-out/delivery siblings.

With that in mind Grimaldi's serves up some pretty good pizza, but to me fails to impress. Their ingredients are for the most part better than their chain counter parts. The pizzas aren't greasy or heavy, in fact, they only seem to have thin crust pizzas (no deep dish for chi-town peeps). They are a bit overpriced for what you get, and considering that they don't offer any custom or specialties pizzas, I'm left wondering I just overpaid for a simple pepperoni pizza.

I wish they had some more stand out ingredients or maybe a signature combo. I've been to this spot a few times and the service is pretty average. The patio is a nice touch but the restaurant itself is pretty small. Call ahead on the weekends as most pizza joints have a slower turn-over time and get packed on busier days.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,4,4,3,yQ1r7cn1pob1u6udoNo7_A

They have a lovely outdoor dining area, with no smoking allowed, about 10 tables I think .  Also, there is a bar where you can sit either inside or out (there's a large rolling shutter that opens up).  Oh & there is absolutely no gaming.  If you ask me, that's a major plus!

As mentioned a small menu, but how many choices do you need with pizza that tasty?

We shared a small pizza- 1/2 pesto 1/2 white with meatballs, sausage, ricotta & roasted red peppers.  I preferred the pesto pizza, a lot more flavor & zestiness.  It was just crispy enough too.  Not too charred on the bottom, which is what I don't like about wood-fired or coal oven pizza.  It was really quite good. 

I can't wait to go back & try the calzones.  I may have to join the gym first, as I see me being very addicted to this place...

Which brings us to Grimaldi's Las Vegas. I have visited this location a handful of times and only today realized that I really like this place. As other reviewers mentioned, it's not particularly cheap. You can't get great pizza for Pizza Hut prices. Today I also realized that the service there is really good. I also appreciate they carry Lavazza coffee and when they refill your cup they bring you a whole new fresh cup from the kitchen instead of just ""topping you off"". 
The people seem genuinely friendly and the place is very clean and open. I see a lot of families there having a nice meal which is great to see these days.

Food quality - 1 star
Inside of my pizza box lay a black ring of burnt crust with a smattering of toppings tossed on top. The crust was burnt so much we could not eat it. I know a brick oven crust has some character and some char to the edges, but this was ridiculous. We paid $2 each for four different toppings. For $2 of onions, I counted 13 pieces of onions. $2 for a small handful of jalapeño STEMS. The mushrooms seemed like they came from a can. The sausage was the only tasty topping on our pizza. The cheese was as flavorless as the crust. Maybe if the cheese was burnt, it would have had some flavor.

Compared to similar pizza places, excluding the fast food pizza places like Pizza Hut, the prices are a little high. If you only want a couple of toppings, your pizza will be cheap. If you like a lot of toppings, you should bring you last paycheck. My four topping, large pizza, complete with flavorless cheese and a burnt crust came two $25. 

Overall, not a great experience. I'm confident in saying I would rather have a slice of pizza from my school's cafeteria. Too much money and way too much disappointment.",OXwmkyamQ5H6Ed0xZo_kQA,1,0,2,Jh7Lkf5NLG8s5uJRv_9TCg

I just moved to Las Vegas and asked where we should go to get some good pizza  He said he has heard of a place called Grimaldi's and that it has some very good reviews so we decided to go.

We go there around lunchtime and was greeted by a very pleasant staff. Since it was our first time there the manager of the place came out to greet us and recommended a few items on the menu.  We started off with a  Chicken Caesar  Salad which was amazing.  I don't like my Caesar to be too fishy, this one was perfect.  It was a nice fresh start to our meal.  Then we ordered a small calzone with meatballs and pepperoni which by the way is far from small.  It came with this marinara sauce that was so delightful that I wanted to take some home with me so I could dip everything in it.  It was cooked to perfection as was the pizza we ordered.  The pizza was a large with red sauce, pepperoni, sausage and basil.  Let me tell you, after eating there I can easily say Las Vegas' best pizza by a long shot.  The pizza was hand tossed with the freshest ingredients, topped perfectly and was also cooked to perfection.  I don't always judge a pizza by whats on it but by the way the dough is cooked as well.  I usually don't eat the crust but I couldn't help myself here, it was just so good.

So after all that food I had to try the desert.  I figured since everything else was so good the deserts must be the bomb, and they were.  I had the tiramisu and he had the canoli.  I didn't think I had anymore room left but when I tasted that tiramisu I couldn't stop until it was gone.  

Between the awesome staff, the great food and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant, I have to say it is the best pizza place I have ever been so far.  If another place wants to take the top spot in my book they are going to have to be something spectacular because this is an amazing place to eat.  I definitely will be bringing out of town guest, family and friends here whenever I get a chance.",Gcfds8bAlYNPpwIpUUewIg,2,0,5,Wj9MilIy38QU3n60oKq1EQ

Like I said, pizza was delicious, nice sauce, crunchy, chewy crust, I was in pizza heaven. If they had one near my house, I'd get pizza every week.

The restaurant was nearly empty, yet when another couple came in, they sat them at the table right next to us.  My chair was touching the chair of the guy behind me.  I know, they need to squeeze in all the tables they can, but seriously, you have an empty restaurant and you pick to seat them right there?

Most of the antipasto was good, the roasted red peppers were excellent, the mozzarella, ok, but the salami was disappointing, it was ok, but was generic, grocery store salami.

We had 2 pieces of pizza, and some red peppers, olives and cheese left from the antipasto, so I told the waitress I wanted them to go, and she asked if the same box was ok.  I said yes, thinking the roasted red peppers and cheese would be put on a piece of wax paper or something so they weren't touching the cardboard.  Nope, just plopped right in the cardboard sucking up cardboard taste.  C'mon use a little common sense.

At that point the people in our party who had ordered the second pizza did not want to have the rest of us who had already finished their meal wait for them, and only ate one slice each leaving half the pizza. 

The bill came and for the manager ""making things right"" was to remove the charge for the second pizza. To me that would have been the starting point, since the meal had been ruined for everyone.

We ordered two pizzas, one with pepperoni and basil and the other with artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, basil and roasted garlic. Both equally tasty.

On vacation with relatives, we went in with a party of 13 including a 6-year-old, two 4-year-olds, and a 1-year-old. Found out pretty quickly Grimaldi's isn't the best pizza place for young kids or parents with young kids. The place is kind of intimate (i.e., small). So when you sit, the back of your chair slams up against your neighbor's. So, because we had little kids, we spent the entire time sitting down, getting up, banging neighbors, apologizing - repeat till fed up.

Asked for a kid menu - ""no."" Asked if they had mac and cheese, or spaghetti with tomato sauce, or buttered pasta - ""no, only pizza."" Asked if they had a vegetarian pizza, or a ""Hawaiian"" pizza, or a BBQ chicken pizza - ""uhhh, yeah, we don't have that."" WTH?

The left side of their menu is pizza. The right side of their menu is salad. There is no other side. And they don't have combinations. They have ingredients and you pick what you want. And as each ingredient is around $3 bucks, if you want a ""vegetarian"", tack on  an extra $30!!! So, $46 for a large vegetarian pizza. Again, WTH?

We ordered a pizza with red sauce and extra cheese for the kids, and a pizza with red sauce, tomatoes and basil, and a pizza with white sauce, fresh garlic, and mushroom for the adults. The red sauce pizzas were kind of bleh - very little sauce and only spots of cheese. Literally. Spots. Of. Cheese. If you're looking for a pizza covered, smothered, and dripping with yummy melting cheese (and we ordered extra cheese, remember?), what we received was not it. Not even close. Picture this: a pizza with a small to medium amount of pepperoni. Now replace the pepperoni with cheese. That's the Grimaldi's ""extra cheese"" pizza! haha

The white sauce pizza, with mushrooms, on the other hand, was a different story. The white sauce itself was like an excellent alfredo sauce, with butter, and parmesan, and tons of garlic. And, unlike the red sauce, they actually put a decent amount of it on the pizza. The white sauce pizza was that pizza where you can't wait for one of your friends to try it just so they can tell you, ""yes, you're right, that's fricken' amazing."" It was one of the best pizzas I'd ever tasted.

If we lived closer, my wife and I would go to Grimaldi's and, with a white sauce pizza with a couple beers, we'd be in heaven. Going in there with a party of 13, four of them little ones, and with it being a not-so-kid-friendly establishment, this was more like hell.",i5EKLVKclUQszP_Roi9khw,1,0,2,Ws4vkbloj4u14XCn3pN3sw

The crust is fantastic -- it's not that cheap crunchy garbage you get at the wanna-be NY pizzerias, this stuff is legit. It's thin, but somehow manages to maintain a soft, chewy texture that perfectly compliments their fresh ingredients and phenomenal cheeses. 

They say the secret to the crust is in the water... which is why they hired a chemist to recreate NYC tap water for the Las Vegas stores. It sounds nuts... but it worked, so I'm not complaining. 

The ambiance is great, very urban and trendy (according to my wife, I don't pay attention... I'm there for the food). It's nice enough to not feel tacky taking a date there, but casual enough that you can wander in whenever and pull up a chair at the bar to watch the game.

The ambiance inside is nice and the service is pretty good, so you feel ok sitting in there and hanging out for a while with a couple beers and a pie, unlike, say, Giovanni's up the road. 
Main point: I really like the pizza. Nice thin crust, so you don't feel like you're taking in 3000 calories (I'm not saying you're not....you may be...it just doesn't feel like it). The cheese is (I think) mozzarella, so it has a really good flavor that is different from your typical take out place. All the toppings are really good and seem pretty high quality.
The side salads are also really good. 
One star off for the high prices and (like others have noted) the fact that you can't order a specialty pizza. Instead, you have to get a large ($18 for cheese I think) and then add on your toppings at $2-4 each. If you get 4 or 5 toppings, you're looking at like $30+ for a pizza. But hey, that's another reason why I say this is a ""night out"" place and not a ""pizza to go"" place.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,0,0,4,Rk5N1INTyr8auWmFNA9Y5g

I always bring out-of-town guests here because I think the food is great and different from most pizza places.  This place is not close to where I live but I go out of my way to get pizza here and it's worth it.

Last night, the BF and I were meeting his aunt and uncle on that side of town, so I kindly offered to bring over some Grimaldi's. Yeah!  Pretty much always order the same thing, but last night I skipped the mediterannean sald I normally order and got two pizzas:

1. mush, meatball, kalmata olives
2. sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, kalmata olives

Seriously, if you like kalmata olives, make sure you get some on your pizza.  Before Grimaldi's I had never had them on a pizza.  Now I'm addicted.

I've tried the white pizza, but I'm not a fan of alfredo.  The pesto sauce is excellent, but I like red sauce on my pizzas.  I haven't even mentioned the staff.

4107118,2015-11-21,3,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"You might note that my original review starts with a disclaimer about my lack of pizza experience. I've gained a little experience since then, but maybe this place has worsened a little too.

A year after my first visit, I returned to Grimaldi's for another birthday pizza. I ordered the same large pizza (red sauce) with meatballs. From the birthday coupon, I got $19 credit back for it again. I think prices have gone up though, with $16 for the base 18"" large pizza and $4 for the meatballs. I ended up having $1 worth of pizza to pay.

Let's cut to the chase. Despite being quite hungry (I'd arrived straight from work), I wasn't very impressed with what I tasted this time around. The pizza just seemed pretty bland. Maybe some of the acidic tomato notes stood out, but not the sliced meatballs, and definitely not the cheese. I tried all sorts of condiments on top, including parmesan, red pepper flakes, and pepper, but I just wasn't getting much help. The table didn't even have oregano (or garlic, as I now recall) as it did last year, but I don't know how much those would have helped even if they'd been available.

I should note that I ate some of the leftover pizza after taking it home and popping it in the oven, and that pizza stood out in terms of crispy crust and just having more of the flavors. Actually, it tasted hot, as opposed to the warm-ish pizza that our server was able to touch despite warning us of the temperature. I'm guessing that there was a delay at the restaurant from oven to table due to the hectic service during the already crowded dinner hours, and that lessened the experience.

I would have considered keeping my rating at four stars for the pizza, but I also tried a dessert trio ($10) with half-sized portions of the tiramisu, Oreo cheesecake, and seasonal pumpkin cheesecake. Perhaps the latter was the most flavorful of the bunch, but again, they all seemed a little too bland and fleeting in flavor. The number of superior versions of all of these desserts outweigh the misses, so I can only conclude that the desserts are below average. I'd rather have the tiramisu at Trattoria Nakamura-ya again, the pumpkin cheesecake from Lazy Dog, or pretty much any slice from Cheesecake Factory (a place that's not even top of the line, mind you).

I'll be back in a year, but I won't be too enthused. Furthermore, I'm not even going to consider returning until then. On top of having had good experiences at Flour & Barley (via a Yelp event) and Little Tony's, I know that I can customize a far more complex and delicious pizza at Blaze Pizza not too far down the street. I simply can't see the same luster in Grimaldi's as I did before.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,3,4,3,K9Rf8HI56tl_gv_yfRwMaA

But I knew the pizza to be great thun crust style and thought it would be good for my family to try.

There were 7 of us last night. We got to the restaurant at what seemed like a late hour to me. Apparently 7:00 PM isn't really that late and the restaurant was packed. It only aboutb5 minutes before we got a seat though. They were quick on that. Unfortunately we were put into a small side room crammed around two small tables. Lucky for us we are a close family and didn't mind the close quarters. Ut got a little stuffy in there onve we all had a few drinks in us and hot pizzas in front of us.

Speaking of pizza and drinks, the food was the easy part. A Grimaldi house salad, a Mediterranean salad, a large The Don Pizza (pepperoni, sausage and meatballs) and a large with sausage and mushrooms. The drinks were a little more challenging. What beers do we want? Which wine do we want? Too many options you know.

The salads were fine. A nice variety of ingredients and a nice vinaigrette. We could have used a bit more of the dressing and my aunt actually did order some more on the side. Salad is just filler any how. It was the pizza we were there for. 

Half of us ate the one with mushrooms and sausage and we all shared the Don. Both were really good but I think we all preferred the Don. The meatballs on it were great. A good size with a fresh flavor. Both pizzas were a little soggy in the middle. Being such a thin crust it cannot hold up to the sauce too well. The edges, however, were superb. Crispy and slighlty charred. Most all of us ate the crust and there were a few in the group who don't normally do so. What does that tell you?

In the end, everyone was pleased with the choice which made me happy because this family has a tendency to be hypercritical of restaurants. We all enjoyed ourselves, pigged out on some quality pie and teased the waiter a bit. He was cool with it. He was even laughing when trying to take the order of the group next to us. His quality customer service was noteable as was the service of the lady who brought our food. She cleared the table for the salad bowls and served up a couple slices of pizza to get us started.

We called ahead to let them know we had a party of 13 coming and they informed us that they don't take reservations, but if we get there before 5:30pm we should be fine. Okay. We head down and arrive at 5:30. As one of our party enters one of the hosts says, ""Oh you must be the party of 13."" Yup, we have 13 and called ahead, but were told you don't hold tables. ANOTHER party of 13 enters right after us. They claim that they called ahead and were told a table would be prepared for them. The host staff then proceeded to seat the other party ahead of us! Really!?! We stood in front of the cold, crowded entrance for over a half hour waiting for our table. 

I really don't feel this way often, but we were all disgusted with how we were treated. I talked to the manager afterward who seemed to me to be pretty disingenuous. Like, ""Yea, yea, that's terrible, we're so sorry. Wow, we feel so bad, is that all? Oh we'll discount your bill."" She ended up taking $10 bucks off, which wasn't what we were looking for; but ended up being a slap in the face.

I had heard so many great things about Grimaldis, and I had been craving coal fired pizza for a while. We were anticipating this pie for quite some time, as we planned out a pizza night with our good friends a week prior to finally ordering. 

I would like to disclose we did do take out. So that could very well be why our pie was unsatisfactory. 
We ordered two large pizzas. One pepperoni and one veggie pizza. Our total was $50. This seemed on the higher side for two large pies, but we were okay with the price due to what we were anticipating. We picked up our two pizzas right on the estimated time, and brought it directly home. I live about five minutes away. We immediately served the pizza to our hungry pizza loving group to find that our pies were rather soggy. The outside of the crust (where you would hold the pizza) had a nice solid texture and char, but the rest of piece was Almost raw as you moved towards the middle of the slice. The dough underneath felt wet- If that makes sense? I couldn't even pick mine up because it had no form. In my past experiences with coal fired pizzas- I've never had one that was soggy. I was really sad because i was hoping for that crispy charred yet chewy crust. We kept in mind that this could have been because it was boxed to go- but I can't help but compare it to other pizzas I've ordered to go and did not have this same issue.  Also- our pies did not sit for long. 

The pizzas were beautiful, and the size was nice. 
It could have had an off night, but I don't think we will be ordering out from this spot again. Sad we had such mediocre pizzas.  Hope you all have better experiences!",nDynpOP644nCR9CPYz6ecQ,0,0,3,7Wbo29SICtJBiE4iT9TREg

4262208,2011-01-16,3,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"I opened up the restaurant with the opening crew three years ago.  I started as a bartender there.  So Grimaldi's, to me, is more than just another pizza joint.  

Grimaldi's is what true Italian cuisine is all about.  Stated simply, ingredients.  Use ingredients that are the best and in season in your region and you will have wonderful results.  Unfortunately, we are in the middle of the desert where nothing fun to eat grows.  Luckily, everyone ships to Vegas.

  When something is so simple as dough, cheese and sauce, the ingredients have to be the best.  Grimaldi's has a supplier from Italy that imports their tomatoes for them; they even use bottled water to make their dough.  I would think that pizza made from Vegas water would have to be subpar.  We have the worst water I've tasted in the states.  Their toppings, ranging from the pepperoni to the Ricotta cheeses, are all superior to any I've tasted in town.   

The artist who sculpts the pie also makes a huge difference.  The dough is hand tossed.  I loved watching the head pizza maker, at the time, dance the dough on his finger tips.  His pies were, by far, superior to pies made from some of the other pie makers.  The artist turns the pie while it's in the oven, moving it closer or further from the coals.  This helps to ensure a tasty crust.  There have been a few times when I've eaten there and the pie was delicious with a flaky crusty crust.  There have been other times when the pie was undercooked for my liking and not as crispy.  But, overall, an excellent pie with gourmet ingredients.

So Grimaldi's, to me, is a place of nostalgia and of mixed feelings of a different time in my life.  The little pizzeria, to me, is quintessential East Coast and Italy.  The former is where I grew up; the latter I dream of going.  I still love Grimaldi's to this day.",jClTjIP3oIuehjbW5I3saQ,4,2,4,e_h5CSmNdNIx-gLA5Lkrhg

I thought the food was pretty good, except for the fact that there was clearly a cheese shortage. Ordering extra cheese wasn't enough. I suppose you would have to order extra, extra, extra cheese if you wanted to actually taste the cheese on your pizza. Oh well, the flavor was good. The white pizza with garlic and mushrooms was excellent. Wow, I would definitely order that again. 

Here's the problem with the place - it was REALLY uncomfortable. First of all, when we arrived they made us stand at the front with a bunch of young children until every single person in our party arrived. That policy is extremely irritating for people with young children or elderly in the group. There really wasn't a good place to sit and wait, but we did our best crammed in by the front door. Once everyone arrived, they brought us to our table. That's when things got worse. 

The table was REALLY bad. We were so crammed in that we could barely move. I dreaded each time that a child had to go to the bathroom, or that I had to stand up to do something. I must have banged into the people behind me ten times. I know that table hated me, but come on, I wear a size 4 -- I should be able to stand up to do something briefly and sit down without shoving my behind in anyone's face. That's not asking for too much room. To my dismay, most of the time I banged the chairs at adjacent tables, and found myself apologizing over and over throughout dinner. I was tempted to stand up and just move our entire table, but thought that would make a scene, so I didn't. 

The food was pretty good. The atmosphere was terrible. I might come here again with just one friend, but I would be careful when agreeing to sit at a particular dining table. Decent food, but an uncomfortable dining experience.",WTUuKiLDrWJimd7ohIiAiA,2,2,3,izk1QvS5Dy4HUHhYpkNXYA

Me and my friend have never been here before and we have heard good things about Grimaldi's, so, we decided to give it a try. We ordered the large pesto pizza with itallian sausage on one half of the pie. My friend had a water to drink and I tried the passion fruit iced tea. 
  Now the atmosphere is nice with the lighting a little on the darker side for a nice reaxing feel to it. Now I wasn't to keen on the drink I ordered so I just asked if I could switch it out with a Pepsi or Coke instead. That wasnt a problem. But while my friend and I were waiting for our pizza we were talking and trying to conversate. Unfortunately we were sat right next to the kitchen where they were making all the food, and as my friend was talking, I could barely hear her or make out was she was saying because of the banging noises and cooking that was going on right next to us. I'm sure any other table would have been fine, but because we were sitting adjacent to where the noise is, I was just annoyed a little bit about that. 
  When we did get our pizza though, it was definitely delectably delicious (LOL try saying that three times fast). It was a nice NY style thin crust pizza that me and my friend enjoyed very much. Is it the best pizza ever? Naw, not to me. The secret pizza place in the Cosmo is a better NY style pizza joint in vegas to me. But, I did enjoy Grimaldi's Pizza and I will definitely come back again. I had the Pesto so I'll try the White with garlic next time i come here. 
  The only other real minor complaint I had was that I never got a refill on my beverage. I left my glass at the end of the table so they could see that it was empty, and our waitress never noticed it until we were already done eating. And by that time, I didnt even want a refill anymore because that would be a waste of soda. I guess that's my biggest pet peeve when it comes to restaurants. You don't need to come by every 5 mins, but you should come by and check on the guests every so often to see if they need anything.

We at first wanted to sit outside in the patio but there weren't any available tables at the moment. Rather than waiting, we just sat inside, a two-top table across from the bar.

We split a small pizza and both ordered some peach iced tea. Half the pizza was pepperoni with jalepenos, the other half with sliced meatballs, ricotta and mushrooms. It arrived nice and hot. I loved the thin crust, it was perfectly foldable. The ricotta cheese was very flavorful and complemented the meatballs quite well. I would say that the pepperoni side was just average though. The server came by once in awhile to check on us and filled up our drinks.

What I liked best about this place was the noise level. Too often I go to a pizza place and I can hardly hear what anyone is saying. Here, we're sitting next to the bar (who had the TV on) and there were a steady stream of customers in the restaurant. Yet, we could still hear each other talk.

My dining companion wanted to get some dessert, their cheesecakes, after the pizza, however upon finishing the pizza the server came over and just plopped down the check. Did not even ask if we wanted dessert.

I like the red sauce because it has a unique flavor that doesn't overpower the toppings. The standard amount of cheese is minimal which I like, but for someone that wants a really cheesy pizza you may want to choose extra cheese. 

In addition to good pizza they also have some tasty salads like the spinach salad. The small is definitely enough for two people to share if you are also getting a pizza.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,0,0,5,fOp60wX-J-jqjgAz4NHigA

(see review)  Since I cannot afford to fly to NY at a whim, Vegas is a little closer to home. Although, Grimaldi's isn't exactly in Vegas but it is worth the drive when visiting.

The biggest advantage to visiting the Vegas location versus Brooklyn is space.  This restaurant is much larger and therefore, no wait time.  The downside is slow service once seated.  You also do not have that 'authentic' down-home feel like the Grimaldi's in BK.  The ambiance is like any other pizza joint, nothing special and nothing unique.

There's nothing like the original but the white pie here was still pretty damn good.  Don't forget to add sun-dried tomatoes.  And if you have room left, try the cannoli. 

Some people like fast food for the 'cheap' deals so if you prefer to stick to the dollar menus or have Domino's just to save a few bucks then keep it moving.  Grimaldi's isn't your cheap or even average-priced pizza.  It is worth the extra $ so treat yourself sometime!

My cousin thought it could be crisper but just ask your waiter to cook it a little longer for that extra crunch or if you have to many toppings can make it soggy. Maybe the coal oven need to be seasoned more. The decor seems to be standard New York with black and white pictures of famous locals like the Brooklyn bridge Empire State bldg. etc...

A buddy of mine from back east (Philly) was visiting and I told him that there's a Grimaldi's off Eastern and 215 in Las Vegas. We visited the place last night around 5:30PM.

We ordered an 18"" light sauce pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms. We waited 15 minutes and the pie appeared. We were starving so we dug in. My bud says...""so where's the extra chesse""? and he was right. Not only was there NO extra cheese, there practically NO cheese on the pizza. I called over our waitress she brought over the order slip and sure enough she ordered extra cheese/light sauce. 

English must be a second language for the oven/kitchen staff. Our waitress sent over the Manager and he apologized and said ....""don't worry, I'll take care of this"" while holding the bill. We said great! We tipped our waitress and started to walk out when the Manager said...oh, wait guys, you still have to pay for half of the pie.

Will somebody PLEASE tell this guy when you say....""I'm gonna take care of this (bill)"" it means the whole bill ......not HALF.

We did get a $5 voucher for a future visit and so I will return and hope for a better outcome.

July 3rd UPDATE!!! Visited the Grimaldi's on Rampart; tried to use the $5 voucher, and.......wait for it.......the voucher date expired three months ago. Yup, the manager gave us an expired voucher.

5004918,2011-07-11,1,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"We really had a tough time deciding whether to give this two or three stars. We thought two was too cruel, but the food just wasn't above average enough to merit three stars. Unfortunately, two-and-a-half stars wasn't an option on Yelp. 

We recently moved to Vegas/Henderson. After all the buzz we'd heard and great reviews we'd read, we finally decided to give Grimaldi's (9595 S Eastern) a try for our first Vegas-area pizza experience. We were very disappointed. 

This was probably the first pizza we'd ever ordered where we didn't take the leftovers home. We ate half a large between us, and had them toss the rest. 

We noticed all the waitstaff were overselling the pizza and telling everyone who came in that it was the best pizza in town. In our humble opinion, the pizza should speak for itself. Sorry, but if this is the ""best pizza in town,"" then this town must have the worst pizza in the world. 

The worst part was the crust. It was like a bland water cracker with black burned marks on the edges. It was dry, crispy, and flavorless. The pizza was kind of like a Carr's Table Wafer with a few toppings on it. In fact the pizza was so dry that The Mrs. ordered an extra side of marinara in an attempt to make it more palatable. Unfortunately this pizza was beyond hope. Even with the extra mozzarella The Mrs. had ordered, there still was barely enough cheese. 

It was so thin that the waiter didn't even need a potholder to carry the pizza out. Two minutes after it hit the table it was cold. Perhaps if there had been some pizza and toppings it would have stayed warm longer. 

We also noticed pictures of New York City all over the walls. Calling it a ""New York"" style or ""East Coast"" style pizza doesn't make it good. Maybe it was modeled after a really bad New York pizza. I'm from the East Coast (Boston), and have been to New York many times. There are a lot of different kinds of pizza available on the East Coast. My favorites were ooey, gooey, and had a flavorful chewy crust. Whether the crust is thick or thin, it's the texture that makes the difference. This Grimaldi's pizza crust had no texture or chewiness. It tasted as plain as a burnt cracker. The skimpy cheese and sauce didn't help either. 

Others may differ, but personally I do not like black burnt portions on my pizza. Even the best pizza can get burned spots. I don't know if this happens from the oven being too hot or from an improper mixture in the crust. I've experienced this on many different pizzas and I'm just not a fan of it. Some people don't seem to mind it, and even the best pizza can occasionally suffer a burned spot and still be good, so I've come to accept it. It's still a negative for me, although not a deal-breaker. If that was the only issue with the Grimaldi's pizza, I wouldn't give it such a low rating. In this case, the black spots on the crust edges were just insult added to injury. 

Perhaps this would be good for someone who likes dry pizza. This was about the driest pizza we've ever eaten. Sorry, but we just don't like dry pizza. 

On the plus side, the waitstaff was very nice. Also, our small side salad was huge and delicious. They also had a pretty nice wine selection.",V-VeccQsom7uxHgXzf0_Lw,2,0,2,FxUJYQ-X9ylL69CPA1EWTw

I enjoy the thin crisp crust but I hate the fact they charge for every topping. Pizza starts at $14 for small and ranges up to $18 for large. Then add your toppings. Only cheese comes.m every additional topping is an added fee. Most of the time I'm here with a few gal pals so the bill is so cheap for the three of us because we divide the bill three or four ways. The last visit the pizza was so dry. Needed more sauce and cheese. Had we added more it would have been a $30 pie. Which is too pricey in my opinion for some almost burnt pizza. All the other visits have been pretty decent so I will give the benefit of the doubt. The salads here are always fresh and tasty. My favorites are the Mediterranean and the Caesar.

I went here a few nights ago with a few friends to redeem the free birthday pizza which is actually, getting $19 off your choice of pizza and additional charge for additional toppings. Which isn't a bad deal. 

We sat closest to the kitchen so we had a great view of the pizza making process. I'm always fascinated to see how things are made, especially pizza! 

We had the kale salad and a large pizza with little slices of pepperoni, sausage, and ricotta.

For me, the kale salad was okay. It was a mix of curly kale, romaine, drenched in a lemon vinaigrette & a few slices of lemon. I don't like too much dressing on my salad. 

My friends seem to like it. It just depends on your eating habits. I tend to enjoy healthier salads. I liked the option to drizzle fresh squeezed lemon. 

I expected the pizza to be better, because I hear people raving about it all the time. I didn't like the crust. The pizza toppings were great, and they gave a great amount of toppings. But the slices were too big and too heavy to fold & hold and it made the crust soggy, so I used a fork and knife. Bummed because I prefer to hold my pizza while I eat it. While eating the last couple slices the dough was hard to chew so I ended up just eating the toppings. 

I loved the black and white photos on the wall, the ambiance, and bottle light fixtures. Server was fast and checked in with us every so often. 

My expectations weren't high for this place because it's a chain but I thought it would be better than what I experienced. Willing to give it another chance but with other pizza places on my to-try list it will be a while before I come back to this place.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,8,5,3,rOPPksPZEr4qZPQ3JuNS5A

but the quality of their toppings is really no different than the national chains that dispatch pimple-faced kids to your doorstep when you're too tired to drag your ass to a ""real"" restaurant and that's kind of disappointing.

and i can't say i'm wild about their sauce either. theirs is raw (and ""lightly drizzled"" over the other toppings so the crust stays crispy) and i'm partial to a long-simmered version -- i enjoy the additional depth of flavor.

so, the quest for the perfect pizza goes on ...",sCiCkK_7CKNwzwo9c0PpKg,1,0,3,WpkZR95gn0xfO6X-cmCUkg

It is clean and a lot of people did seem to like the place, but it didn't fly for us. Canned mushrooms at extra cost? Canned?! The Stromboli had almost nothing in it.
Service was not over the top, you may have to wait just to get seated here. The parking lot can fill up quickly too as there are a lot of little places in this section.

However, the za is not greasy or heavy, and I think the sauce is solid. When it all comes together, it's a nice pie. Plus, the restaurant is nice, and they do have a fabulous patio. 

My minor complaints: The crust is a bit too crispy. The cheese is not provocative. The cost is pretty pricey, which usually leads to me deciding to go with a one topping pie - never mind blowing. Plus, I find it odd that they don't have specialty pies where you can realize some savings by getting a crazy combo they've dreamed up. Is that amateur of me?

The star for me, however, is the salad. Even a house salad manages to impress with super fresh ingredients and large serving portion. I guess what I am saying is go for the za stay for the green.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,7,6,4,dlVH7eKZaZFmXd9Sk02ZUQ

Crispy thin crust, the sauce is flavourful but there's not too much of it -- no soggy pizza for me!  They have a wide array of toppings -- I usually go for ricotta which is to die for, fresh garlic, fresh sliced tomato and basil (the tomato and basil's best when it goes on after it's cooked).  Yes, their italian sausage, pepperoni, roasted peppers and sundried tomatoes are awesome but I like to keep it simple.  They've got a nice wine list -- whether you want something pricey or just the house red you'll be happy.  Also, if you're a fan of caesar salad, make sure you try theirs.  It's not dripping with dressing like you'll find at a lot of places!

The downsides... It's a small restaurant and can get very cramped so if you're coming with a big group, anyone with mobility issues or small children I would highly recommend not coming at peak dinner time.  Also, there is one waitress there who is just unpleasant.  All the rest of the staff are wonderful from the bartenders to the hostesses up to management... I don't know what her problem is but every single time I've been there she's made it clear that she does NOT want to be there.

As for Grimaldi's, here's how I see it:

Pros:
*Cool vibe with a nice patio! Feels much more fun to dine here than Settebello.
*Various sizes of pizza! I have issues at Settebello because the only size they serve is just a tad too big for me.... then I overeat because I can't leave the last piece on my plate etc...or then I waste some... I prefer to order a slighly larger pie at Grimaldi's and split it! Much more cost effective and no wasted pizza and overeating.
*better drink menu
*They spread the cheese out! No huge globs of cheese.. the yummy cheese is spread out perfectly.

Cons:
*Crust is slightly better at Settebello's
*Ummm salame... can't find that here! In general I think toppings are a little better over at Settebello, but not by much.

5498936,2010-12-25,1,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"Okay, let's just get this out of the way right now - Grimaldi's is not New York style pizza. I know, Brooklyn Bridge, brick oven, yadda yadda.

But the style of pizza that they cook here is much closer in spirit to the artisan/VPN style pies than to the floppy, foldable slices that to me characterize New York pizza.

Until I discovered Settebello (and honestly, not until my second Settebello visit), I thought this was the best pizza that the Las Vegas valley had to offer.

Why? Ingredient quality.

One reason that Grimaldi's maintains as much share of my pizza eating as it does, in the face of Settebello's competition, is the fact that Settebello does not serve pepperoni, while the pepperoni you will find on a Grimaldi's pizza may well be the best damn pepperoni on earth. It's organic, and while I've never really a drinker of the organic Kool-Aid, when you taste this pepperoni, you'll wonder what the hell you've been eating all your life.

The sauce is basic, clean of flavor and just the right consistency. The crust is the best part of a Grimaldi's pizza, with that charcoal essence bringing out the flavor of the other ingredients, including fresh buffalo mozzarella that practically melts in your mouth.

Oh, and one last thing. The garlic powder that they offer as a seasoning isn't the granulated garlic that you typically find on grocery store shelves, it is a much finer grind, almost a real powder that actually seems to soak up the grease on top of a slice. I would love to know where I can get a bottle of this super-fine grind garlic. Anybody?",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,4,1,5,bNpl9eswNV9oeTN0EgP_3Q

Ive got it the last few times I have made it to a Grimaldis and its been amazing every single time.  They slice the meatballs real thin and then pile them on.  Its a great combo of flavors and I would recommend it if you haven't tried it before.

One of the managers there told us that they are looking into branching out into Southern California some time in the next few years.  I instantly got a boner!

I love the layout too of this grimaldis because it has a bar on one side that has open seating to outside.

The staff here is really hit or miss, sometimes you get a very nice, friendly, animated server, and other times you get a slow one that doesn't really care you are there. My food has always come out right though, so I wouldn't say this is a turn off from the food, which is always on point.

The pizzas have always been delicious no matter what I order.  My favorite here is the pesto pizza with red sauce, or a white pizza with fresh Italian sausage. Every pizza and dish is made to order and you can watch since the kitchen is in the back, but open.  I have also had the homemade desserts here, my favorite being the AMAZING cheesecake, some are seasonal but they always have original NY style. I have had their ceaser and house salads, both of which are good to share as a starter I think, before a pizza (so I feel less guilty!) The beer selection is alright, this is no brewery, but they have blue moon and some Italian beers or wine to match with your pizza.

I was seated before my friends arrived and didn't see a server for over five minutes. I had flashbacks to a few weeks ago and briefly considered sending a text to change our meeting place. A few minutes later, one of my friends arrived and I explained what I was thinking. As I was sharing my thoughts, Stanley arrived and introduced himself as our server.

I explained to him my experience for two reasons: (1) I never did hear about my inquiry after the last visit, I wanted someone in the place to acknowledge it; and (2) I didn't want a repeat and ruined meal. He made a point of not just nodding and smiling, but listening, asking questions, and assuring us that we would not have to worry tonight.

Stanley was fantastic! Special orders were accomodated, wine service was excellent, and his care for us (and, in fact, the other tables around us) was perfect. There was some slow going with the food from the kitchen, but we weren't about to shoot the messenger; he was communicative and helpful and jovial, taking the time to enjoy our company and make sure that we had an enjoyable experience with him. He wasn't just a server, he was a participant in our little dinner party and it made all the difference.

The food and ambiance are still (just) A-OK, 3 stars. Stanley's 5-star service is what makes me inclined to give this place 4 stars for this visit. 

FYI to the winos: Bonus points for the wine list with a lot of  inexpensive yet drinkable wines - big fan! Bottles... yes, bottles, for $20? At a restaurant? Some are better than others, for sure, and they also carry a lot of variety all the way into the more expensive ranges... this was a nice discovery!

First off - the crust.  It's that thin NY style, with a great char flavor - it combines crispy and chewy in just the right way.

Secondly - the cheese/sauce - thin slices of buffalo mozzarella, with a delicious tangy/sweet red sauce makes for a combo that provides enough flavor that you really don't need any additional toppings - that being said...the toppings are delicious too!

I would recommend this place to anyone in town!  One thing I would suggest is keep the additional toppings to a minimum - I never get more than two - because they start to take away from the amazing flavor the pizza already has.

I feel they can do no wrong. The service is stellar, the food is great, and the place is poppin'. It isn't a large location, so if they get busy you may have to wait. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait, which was fine with us. We went to the bar outside (it has one side outside and one side in). We ordered drinks from (I believe her name was) Shandra and her service was fast and super friendly. I also started with a small Mediterranean salad no onions (devil's food).

The oven they cook in is a coal brick oven. The pizza comes in different sizes small, medium, and large. You can get tomato sauce, white pizza, or pesto. We get the large white pizza with pepperoni and fresh tomato all the time. Last night we added ricotta cheese on half. The second pizza we got was a large white with meatball, fresh tomato, mushrooms, and added ricotta on half. Why half you ask? Well, I am not a fan of ricotta at all. BUT let me tell you, their ricotta is the exception to everything I know about ricotta cheese. It is smooth, creamy, and not gritty at all.

Of course it was delicious as always. The biggest downfall is you will pay $2-$4 per topping you get. We spent $100 with tip last night. It is expensive, but not a typical trip cost for my hubby and I. Normally it's around $25 plus tip for our regular. We didn't get dessert last night, but I have had their cheesecake.

Would it be too obvious if I accidentally lick it? did I brig my taser?? TOO LATE!! your 3 friends are already going ""sparta"" on each other for it. Yep..that good son..that good.

First lets start with the flavor. Le awesome. Mia mamma ..this pizza is packed of flavor. Delicious sauce, and toppings are generous  but not lacking of tastyness at all. Enough sauce to let you taste the other ingredients making it a whole different experience

The size..well..well..  if you are not that hungry you can use the x large pizza as a blanket, tent, parachute, or to cover a small garden. thing is massive. And its perfect for my appetite. even the ""small"" aint small. And the calzone you may ask? yes that one is the size of a whole island. Holy impressive sizes batman!

Now, if you (like me) have tried the grimaldins in NY , then you 'll say ""well its not the same"" DUH of course it isnt because all the other components that make food delicious (water, air, bacteria , etc) are not present as it is a different enviroment/city. However it is hands down the best pizza I tried in this desert. 

to top this, there are days that they do 50 percent off bottles of wine (tuesdays I believe) . Get drunk get full get happy.. man I should be writing their slogan! . Be aware that they dont take reservations and this place can get packed

5752975,2010-06-07,5,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"I've been spoiled by the Brooklyn location. About a year ago, we made the walk across the Bridge from Manhattan over to Brooklyn and found ourselves waiting in line at Grimaldi's. When we finally started eating, the pizza was properly seasoned, and the crust actually had that charred and burnt flavor that made the place so famous.

When I heard that there were Grimaldi ""chains"" all over the place, I was immediately intrigued. The closest one was in Las Vegas. So on the next trip, we decided to check it out for lunch. It was about a 10 minute drive from the Strip, closer to Henderson. We found ourselves at some strip mall, which reminded me of Irvine.

When we settled in and stopped looking at all the black & white ""faux"" Brooklyn framed photos all over the walls, we decided on sharing a large pizza, half with sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms, and the other half with pepperoni. We also shared an antipasto salad, which was pretty good. Fresh slices of mozzarella, salami, salted olives, along with some toasted bread. It was nice way to start off the meal.

Unfortunately, the pizza was a bit of disappointment. Naturally, I had high expectations, having been to the Brooklyn location. The pizza overall tasted a bit bland, like it needed more seasoning in the crust. The crust didn't have that burnt-coal flavor either. But if you think about it, how could it? I was comparing it to the Brooklyn location, which the ovens have been burning since 1905. It makes a huge difference.

I even asked our waitress if it was true that they ship in water from NY. She flat out said no, but they do have a water filtration system using ""osmosis"" which replicates the NY water. Interesting, to say the least. I wouldn't say it made much of a difference anyway. Overall, it's still good pizza that I would rather have than something from Costco or Dominos or Pizza Hut. Prices are pretty high, however, but good for the occasional splurge. 3.5 stars.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,5,5,3,jEI9jWqzt2arHvnhooPo8g

I am a fan of this and wish I would come back more frequently. It is a create your own style and you are charged for each topping, so this could get a little pricey, but it is well worth it, more than you know!! 

My favorites:

Caprese salad: perfect and simple. This restaurant does not try to reinvent the wheel on this dish.

Pizza: The standard thin crust that is perfectly baked in their coal ovens... get a piece with a pizza bubble on it!! I love the just-charred bits on here.. 
I usually get pesto with chicken. So light and flavorful. Its a carnival for your tastebuds, and texturebuds!

Dessert: Cheesecake and cannolis

I don't want to write too much on these dishes because they are what we have all had before, but Grimaldi's keeps it simple which makes there food SO GOOD.

5801113,2009-04-20,0,Z5eukYH32_nFljOTC2DJ0g,"Initial thoughts: 

I was first told about this coal brick-oven pizzeria by a friend of mines. I do have the say the moment you walk into this restaurant it has a warm atmosphere. I was initially greeted by the hostess and brought over to a table. It had a large coal brick oven and they do change out the coals depending on the serving time between lunch and dinner. I made the mistake of going at around 4pm when they were switching the coals out. It has a nice bar that opens out to a patio area that is open during the warmer season. It has a good location but I had trouble finding it at first. I couldn't see a sign for it until I passed it.

Food:

I really really enjoyed their pizza. Whenever I go, I always get the meatball topping and it is superb. They take the homemade meatballs and slice them thin and place them as toppings. The crust is nice and thin and the freshness of their ingredients from the fresh mozzarella and their basil. The sauce is quite flavorful and tasty. I was talking to one of their managers and I explained this was my first time dining and he told me a little bit about where they come from. He explained to me that they balance their ph of the water to match it just like NYC. I was really impressed that they did that, as it shows a dedication to great pizza. They also serve white pizza if that is something you enjoy. 

Service:

The waitress was very efficient. She took my drink order and asked if it was my first time dining. I can't remember her name but she was very friendly and knew the menu very well. I ordered my personal pizza and it only seemed like a couple of minutes and it came out warm, fresh and toasty. She did a wonderful job on asking about my food and making sure my drink was always full. Kudos to her. 

Quality:

Fresh, fresh, and fresh. Their ingredients are not skimped on and you can taste the freshness in their produce and sauces. I don't think you will be disappointed. 

Final thoughts:

Grimaldi's is definitely my choice for a sit down pizza joint. The freshness of their ingredients their warm and welcoming staff and their dedication to great pizza shows that their restaurant will be and continue to be successful and their patrons will spread the word and continue to come back. They obviously know what needs to be done to run a great restaurant. I know I will be coming back and I will bring my friends along as well.",VUrTgQhEB4Vo04xbnNiNyQ,3,0,4,SgTkP99USNX-JVPVvzLAGw

She said she would be right back to take our drink order.  Approximately 10 minutes later she returned and said that she was so sorry and stated that they were so busy.  As I look around I notice that more then half the tables are empty and I see numerous waitresses.  Oh well, maybe she was new.  She brings our drinks by quite some time later and apologizes again.  I can't stand when people keep saying sorry with no meaning behind it!  If you're sorry, change what you are doing!!  Eventually we got some food!!

Pizza - you choose your toppings for every pizza which range from $2 a piece to $4 a piece.  You can easily make a $30 pizza.  It's thin crust and it was eh!
