We had the pleasure of having our sandwiches made by Shomar (who is new) and he did a great job at giving us a generous amount of each condiment, when usually we get a stingy amount at other locations. Even though he's only been working there for a week he did a great job at thoroughly asking if we wanted all the items and if he didn't know the answer to a question he got assistance rather than just blatantly saying ""I don't know"" (which we've gotten from other new people at different locations). Chad the assistant manager rang us up and was pleasant to talk to; he made our experience even better by giving us a discount when they weren't able to toast our sandwiches.
Overall we had a great experience and this is now our port of subs of choice!",9qYDmCroLNpKru8HYfKLkw,0,0,5,E1LTLnKdf48P9d3_gqmrgg

They have a few choices of sandwiches. Nothing compared to subway.
They have ""grilled"" sandwiches, and just regular ones on sub bread. 

Everything is pretty minimal. They have basic cold cuts, turkey, ham, and then tuna.
The tuna is pretty good.

I like mine with peppercinis, spinach, smoked cheddar, salt, pepper. oregano, a splash of vinegar, and some red onion.

Just like their sandwich list, their veggies are nothing compared to subway. 
Very minimal, no jalapenos, no cucumber, you get the point.",bhmJrMRVc2sbk8XP00ravw,1,1,4,zToOaFgh3qnh8Urugj0ogQ

I am saying this because when it comes to port of subs I am not adventurous at all.  In fact I get the same sandwich every time.  I get the #5 Smoked Ham, Turkey & Smokey Cheddar Cheese.  Yeah I know it's crazy, I mean there are 2 smoked items on this thing!  Ok I'm kidding, but I'm not.  I have to say I love this sandwich because it never disappoints me.  

Port of Subs is that sandwich place that you always forget about and then realize you are missing out.  They have slicers set up so you know you are getting fresh cut meat as you order.  I really like their patented mustard mayo combination. (I think it's patented.)  This is such a mind blowing idea to mix the to condiments together!  The veggies always look fresh.  Overall they are tasty sandwiches.  

If you are in the area check this place out.  It is a little tucked away in this strip mall.  Watch out when you are driving it this place because I have dubbed it the parking lot of doom.

I just wonder how they pay their electric bill because this place has always been dead when I'm there. I mean 4 visits and so far I have yet to see anybody else here besides myself and my friend that was NOT wearing a Port of Subs uniform. Seriously.

But that makes for a quick service with no wait :) so I hope word doesn't get out too fast!

Im partial to the turkey and provolone with everything. The employees are always friendly and quick so that's a plus. I have catered from here before for family events and get together's. Their trays are reasonably priced and you can mix and match the sandwiches. They are located near all types of shopping stores. So if you have some errands to run and want a quick bite I would give them a shot.

On this wonderful visit I decided I'd add an 8 oz side of macaroni salad to my sandwich order. All good right? Nope!! The young lady serving me decided that instead of going to the back and getting more Mac salad from the back, that she would give me the last little scoop she had in front. I politely asked her if she was going to add more because I've gotten it here before and its usually a little more. She then proceeds to tell me how she works at another port of subs and that's how they do it! My darling, my sweet Clementine don't argue with the customer , get your lazy little butt in the back and get me some more Mac!!

5216356,2015-08-20,0,b4a9xvX1LtwcZx6a5SiFVw,"My wife and I came here this morning to get a BLT. We have ordered these many times but we had not been here in a while and we were craving it so decided to come in. The place smelled great and there were a few signs posted indicating there was some construction in process but really clean. We were the only ones there so I proceeded to sit at one of the tables. My wife just had eye surgery and asked the lady behind the counter for a hand menu because the one on top had a bad glare and she couldn't see it well. She was handed a menu to look at but she changed her mind because we decided to get the BLT (bacon, lettuce and tomato) sub instead. The lady working behind the counter was right there in front of us when we told her we were going to do a BLT. My wife asked if I was getting a large ($7.99) sub and i let her know that I was. My wife suggested we get the XL ($13.99) sub because this one is 24 inches long and it was cheaper than buying two large subs. The lady who was making our subs listened to our conversation and my wife looked at her and confirmed that we would be doing an XL BLT sub. She asked if we wanted it grilled and we let her know that we did not (I wasn't really surprised by this question because I thought that was their way of asking if we wanted our bread toasted, the way the Subway does). We then proceeded to letting her know what we wanted on our sandwiches and my wife made several mentions that on my half of the sand which I wanted some items to be different. She completed our sandwiches and we were really happy with the service up until the time that we had to pay for the sandwiches. When my wife reached the register the lady who made our sandwiches then said ""oh by the way, BLTs are considered ""Grillers"" now so I have to ring them up as two large sandwiches"". We asked what she was talking about and she said that the menu had changed and that they don't make XL BLTs anymore, that they have to be ringed up as two large bacon Grillers and that each sub is $9.29 each plus tax! Seriously??!!! For a bacon sandwich? And why was this not brought up when we ordered and XL BLT????? Needles to say that I won't be coming back. I understand that it was posted on the menu but my wife was the one ordering and the lady knew she couldn't see the menu very well. When we started to order an XL would have been a great time to say ""sorry but we can't make XL BLTs anymore"" and to point out to the change in the menu! I'm so upset right now and feel that she purposely went on to make our sandwiches knowing that we did not realize that that change had been made.",UYgX6kFtI8TBOAu6QPb_WQ,0,0,1,b4fkC3bbC4hchKPs2Rru9g
