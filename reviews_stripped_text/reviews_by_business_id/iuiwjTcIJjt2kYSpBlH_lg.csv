303201,2012-07-15,0,iuiwjTcIJjt2kYSpBlH_lg,I recently gave Goldfinger's another try.  My positive was the waiter on the food side. Anthony.  He was polite and attentive.  The food was your standard bar fare.  Would I go back??? Only because of Anthony.  Next I'll try breakfast.,Wl62D45KLGNE5A80xI4TcQ,0,1,3,dDJI2wBx8SEofwfjpl7WEA
408344,2010-10-02,0,iuiwjTcIJjt2kYSpBlH_lg,"I used to like Goldfinger's quite a bit. Within walking distance of my house, i'd go every couple of months with my MIL for late-night food and a bit of gambling. At 1am, the bar is pretty decent, and i've actually hit a jackpot or 2, a very nice addition. In fact,  I give them an extra star for the $800 I won there one night!

The food's been changed, and not in a positive way. This has been recent, say in the past 6 months. One of the best items they served was a steak and eggs graveyard special, and it was unique. It has a Mexican twist to it, the meat was marinated in a very delicious, unusual blend of spices. It made the meat very tender and delicious. Not anymore! It's a sub-standard, just salt and pepper steak of ill-repute. NOT GOOD. I used to love eating that steak!

You can't through a rock without hitting a gaming bar in this town.  For me it is all about the quality of food and service.  This is one of the few places I would come just to eat as opposed drink and gamble.  Breakfast is a dam good value, very tasty bacon.  Chicken Wings are nice and Crispy.  The only desert offered is truly decadent Fried Oreos, with ice cream.  If you have the late night munchies have the beer battered onion rings, and fried oreos for desert.  They have nachos that kick ass over this other place daddy something or other.  I like the mellow vibe of the place.

I usually go on the late nights and the overnight  bartenders are cool as hell. It is usually one of the guys. The late night specials are half off all appetizer's, and seeing that the most expensive appetizer during regular hours is 8 dollars, the late night app's are quite a bargain. I ordered the chicken nachos. When they came out it looks like 2 pounds of food coming out. The corn tortilla chips taste house made, and is topped with melted shredded cheese, olives, tomatoes, beans, and chicken. Oh, but the best part is that it's also topped with fresh chopped jalapeno's, Yum-o. Served alongside sour cream and salsa. After being stuffed I saw the bill and it came out to 4.02.

It is still great during Aprils grave shifts. But the past several times of going in on a swing shift that Gina is working is very uncomfortable. She has a bad attitude, is rude, and short with us. I have never asked for or expected anything free. I always ask for a check , ALWAYS!!! Last night I was greeted with ""You have to play a total of 5 coins for a drink"" . That was the rudest greeting I have ever revived  any place I have ever gone. The fact that my husband and I have always taken good care of the bartenders there, and never even implied that we wanted anything for free. My husband plays quite a bit and usually drinks nothing but water, so again the comment was just being nasty  & insulting for whatever reason.

2774932,2016-03-13,0,iuiwjTcIJjt2kYSpBlH_lg,"Major plus is that it's open 24 hours and if I ever decided to get really drunk, I could walk home, it's that close to my house.

I work nights so I like to treat myself to their steak and eggs at 4 a.m. Hits the spot. I'm very picky about my order and the cooks have always gotten it right, the first time. Their omelets are also fantastic. heck, everything I've eaten there has been fantastic. 

The waiters and waitresses have always been super attentive, more so than most other places I've been to. I drink a lot of water and iced tea, and my glass has never been empty there. The food comes out really quick and piping hot.  When you've just worked a 14-hour shift, the last thing you want to do is deal with a waitress with an attitude or food that takes too long. Neither have ever been a problem here.  

I only have two complaints. 

First, the dining area is plexiglassed off from the bar area in an effort to keep diners away from smoke.  But the very stale air in the dining area still smells of cigarette smoke. The air doesn't look smoky. But you can definitely smell it. Since I am highly allergic, I usually end up getting a headache before I leave which lasts for a couple of hours. Big bummer. They really need to air it out for a couple days and then get a huge hose with Febreze and spray it all down.

Second, the lack of desserts. The fried Oreos are delicious, but sometimes I just want to have pie ala mode or good old fashioned carrot cake or chocolate cake or cheesecake after a meal. It seems like it wouldn't be too hard to get more desserts in there. That would make those of us with a sweet tooth very very happy. 

Other than those two problems, I really enjoy going there. And will continue to do so.  I hope the owner takes suggestions to heart. Then i wouldn't hesitate to give it 5 stars.",dq4MLIMiPDzfEuhxJ72U7A,1,0,4,H21qX5eOgYGNR_2P0RJcQA

Can I please see your id"" Since I was walking I didn't bring my whole purse just the money I needed and she made me walk to the restaurant side of the bar just to pay and hand me my bag. I really had no problem moving since I didn't have an id to provide however I don't appreciate the customer service skills.

4137765,2011-08-15,2,iuiwjTcIJjt2kYSpBlH_lg,"This is one of those places that you go to and at the end of your meal you say to yourself ""I'm never coming back here again"" and then a year later you think- Hmm...maybe they've improved so you go back and then at the end of your meal it happens just like in the Lion King - The Circle of life- your  thoughts from a year ago come back to haunt you or dare I say bite you in the ass....
The food is just Whatever.... It's like they went out and bought a bunch of frozen stuff at Sam's or Costco's and then prepared it. I thought I was picking something special when I ordered the Chicken Cordon Blu. Basically if you don't know what that is- it's breaded chicken breast stuffed with ham and cheese and then deep fried. This dish is served with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Sounds good huh? Well, like I said I truly believe this dish came from Sam's. 
Aside from the bar side we were the only people in the dining area and the food took 20 min. (My dish, cheeseburger & an order of fries) The waitress clearly worked an extra shift or was asked to come in on her day off cause she did not want to be there, we saw it all over her face.

After a meal I hate asking myself  - ""Why did I waste my money and calorie intake at this place?"" So kids,the moral of the story is that life doesn't have to be a circle- if a place is not satisfying once, it's most likely not  going to be satisfying again.",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,5,0,2,ApolQBkf-1o7B3iuwZqKlg
