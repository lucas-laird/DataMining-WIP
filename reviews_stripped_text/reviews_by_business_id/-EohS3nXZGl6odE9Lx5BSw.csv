Did the survey to get a free small side and took 20 minutes before I left because they were so busy and forgot about me. Worst location for Panda Express the costumer service is so poor.,_f9CLuE52ZbDujNWKvtzkg,0,0,1,8D5ryevJv8rP34vmbYJjWA

The manager Michael was very nice and I liked how he helped and assisted everyone accordingly. Five stars for this place.",2UMQDnJaqt4xgD3Qu-AHVA,0,0,5,jQDZkgfGdCTA_OXJlRBE4A
1341676,2017-07-13,0,-EohS3nXZGl6odE9Lx5BSw,"Stopped in during my lunch break since it was close by. It was slow there was only one person in front of me being served first and I was fine with that. The lady finished with her then she walked away. So I stood for a few minutes waiting for someone else to come help me and finally another guy did. He served me but was rushing me since other people came through the door. He asked me 4 times if I wanted spring rolls and every time I said yes, he then ignored me and pushed me back to the lady who magically reappeared. She then asked me if wanted spring rolls again. Then at check out she asked if I wanted a drink I said medium. She ignored me and ran my card, never gave me a drink and walked off. I flagged her down and had to run my card AGAIN for a drink. She walked off again and I go to fill my cup and the soda machine was turned off. So I went back to find someone and I got the lady again and she started getting rude with me when I told her the machine was off. 
I am a very hormonal pregnant lady and I was in tears afterwards because I've never been so frustrated with this poor of customer service before. 
On top of everything my chow mein was burned and the orange chicken was so overcooked and hard I thought my tooth was going to break eating it. 
Thanks for ruining panda for me guys.",l-JMdvz1ISKc_TnPNHNnqw,1,0,1,tI5n_FkKoaAftHh8ybPXkA

Not sure what was wrong with my fried rice but it was not good. The kung pao chicken was not the best either. The chicken was horrible and it did not have enough sauce. The vegetables were not cooked all the way through. I would recommend going to the Sahara location instead.",qwIlUbNH0lGCSu4i3jcDMw,0,0,1,wlZNE350nlcD0gqSucJAlg

3670204,2017-08-16,0,-EohS3nXZGl6odE9Lx5BSw,"This Panda Express is the worst of all pandas. They show favoritism toward Hispanic and Scotty (I think his name is) is very rude. If your Hispanic they are very friendly, courtesy and give a lot of food but if you are anything else... beware of the rudeness. This location only hires Hispanic because they speak in Spanish which is rude when your dealing with English speakers. Scotty needs to work on his customer service and his rude attitude. Greet customers with a smile, it goes a long way.",XKBX1KF9mlXUACsoiOMzOg,0,0,1,qa5WsWTrqa9JxctnkpAq0g

They make you wait forever for the food to be prepared if they have run out of what you want.  Never again.  I would rather drive further to a better location.,hilL60vuuh06sMxs6Ckkog,1,0,1,GI5KMmW9Doi9a39SQCtmXQ

On the plus side, the place is kept very clean and it's fast. 
Be careful if you are diabetic, the chain uses a TON of sugar in everything. It's what they substitute because PE doesn't use MSG.",lCSFlVryaxetdjJmdzkUaw,0,0,2,9kmrYsqbHH3Zo4BXQwLCsQ

They added extra chilies to the spicier foods and that burned going down.   Not going back!   I think they are confused about whether it is a chinese or mexican restaurant.",ynVnB2s5wF7RxWX7SSdbhw,1,0,1,kxmFTO4xqfhMh3lYREPsjw
