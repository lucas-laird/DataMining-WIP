446288,2014-06-28,0,Xz3ClYYqk5rCzUaWYybYOQ,"Come during Happy Hour, the margaritas are my favorite menu item. If you've had a bad margarita here, like watered-down with huge chunks of ice - it's the bartender IN THAT SHIFT! Don't let one person ruin your experience. Most of the female bartenders do a fantastic job on the frozen margaritas and can get a little creative if you ask for a custom drink. 

I frequent the place around noon, I have never been here for dinner, so I cannot comment on what type of service you might receive at that time of day. The staff is typically pretty friendly and jovial at lunch time. They don't seem agitated or unwilling to explain what's in some of the entrees if you don' t already know.

The steak and camarones (shrimp) are also fantastic here. They both seem as though they were made in someone's home. If you don't know what I'm talking about, go try Applebees steak or shrimp and then sample either one at Hacienda Del Rey - there's a BIG difference. The shrimp are large enough to be served only 4-5 at a time as an entree (no pitiful salad shrimp here!)",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,2,0,4,EF4k69O22LRtugnFPlmeeQ

I live in this area and drive by this place daily, and had never paid attention to it for some reason. (Their sign is hard to read while driving.) I searched on Yelp for enchiladas and found this place. 

I was there about 430PM on Saturday afternoon and I was the only customer, which I thought was odd, although it's the first couple of weeks after Christmas and that seems to be a slow time. At any rate, I had enchiladas rancheras, typical preparation, great flavor,  with better than average rice and beans, chips and salsa. It was better than Michoacan the last time I was there, several months ago and the server was very friendly and efficient. 

By the time I left, there were several other customers which was good. I hate seeing restaurants go out of business due to lack of customers.",0Qg75JqVqdKlLMggvuHrmw,1,0,4,iAAzEALN5LNqCt9CHj8LWQ

We were town for a conference and apparently there was a traffic jam in the Paradise/Flamingo area (where all the chain restaurants are), so our cab driver took us off the beaten path until we came to this place. After a great dinner, we tried to catch a cab and were told we'd have to wait an hour! So our server, Miguel, offered to drive us in his car. We were hesitant to trouble him, but after waiting for 20+ minutes and unsuccessfully trying to flag down 4 cabs that drove by, we finally took him up and he graciously returned us safely to our hotel.

Food was prepared fresh which too a while but came out good and hot and better than expected.  I am sure people who live closer call in and pick up. But nice that they have tables too and salsa bar with fountain drinks too. 

Didn't know what to expect since we did a yelp search coming down the 215.  But they had what we wanted and it was good.   Hope to give them a try some other time.   I think they rank higher than Roberto's or Rubios.  But basically about the same.

In fact, I believe it was an Elephant Bar when it was built. Well, it was a stumble I was happy I made. I mean, how bad could it have been ... how bad could it have turned out? It is conveniently located a couple of short blocks from Sunrise Hospital. If things went bad, I had a back-up plan.

Very large restaurant - us, one other table, and 1 person at the bar ... service was excellent.  As soon as we sat, we were given a cheese quesadilla - nice touch. Also, given fresh, hot, recently made chips with salsa. Ordered the Carne Asada Plate. Delicious! Nice, good cut of steak (not thin like I normally would have expected). Served with homemade (well, restaurant made) tortillas (corn or flour).

I came across one that was pretty decent but OMG this past weekend I was in the area with my girlfriend and we both decided to try a new restaurant and I yelped and came across Hacienda Del Rey and this restaurant is by far the best Mexican Restaurant near the Las Vegas Strip. 

I was surprised that from the minute we walked in their service was top notch. 
The waitress sat us down I believe her name was Claudia it was around 7:30pm on a Saturday eve there were a few people inside eating but the waitress told us they get a crowd in after like 8:30pm or so. Any how back to the food. 

My girlfriend and I ordered a feast because we were hungry. 
She ordered the plate with Shrimp and a Steak and I ordered a Treo plate (1Taco, 1 Enchilada and 1 Chile Reñeno)  I once tried a Chile Reñeno in L.A. and since I was served the worst Chile Reñeno in L.A. I was kind skeptical to ever try one ever again so I gave it a shot here at this restaurant and all I can say YUMMY!!! I will order some more when I come back or at least I now have faith to try those again at other locations. They gave me hope. lol... But besides this plate they give you some delicious fresh Chips and Salsa and you can taste the freshness. I believe your meal also comes with 1 Quesadilla for each of you. I read from other Yelpers that their Tortillas are delicious and they were not kidding. These tortillas are delicious too I order the corn tortillas instead of their flour one. I couldn't tell you how that one would taste like but I am sure it's just delicious too.

I give this place a 100% and they pass with flying colors ALL THE WAY... I was totally satisfied and I definitely will come back for more and more. BEST MEXICAN Restaurant in Las Vegas and their prices are very decent. So if you are hungry for some fresh tasty Mexican food that taste straight from the kitchen made fresh and with some love I say stop by here you will be going back to the strip with a Huge smile on you face and a happy heart.

I ordered an avocado shrimp salad and after biting the first shrimp I found it a bit sour but thought maybe it was the dressing so I took another bite without the dressing and same sour taste. I let my husband taste it just in case my taste buds were off and as soon as he bit it he spit it out. We told the waiter and all he said was did you want to order something else. No apology or nothing. I asked him if all the shrimp was the same and he said he didn't know but would give me time to think about what to order. I didn't end up ordering anything, not because of the shrimp being bad but because this waiter's lack of interest in the issue. I'm not sure if this waiter is the owner or what but he does seem a little arrogant and careless about his customers for being a ""waiter"". Our bill still ended up being like 78.00 which is reasonable if this was a good Mexican restaurant but it's not!!!! Do not go there. Still, when we left I expected some sort of apology for ruining my Friday night dinner and nope nothing. We just left from there and I hope this yelp review prevents a lot of disappointed customers.

5483784,2013-12-03,0,Xz3ClYYqk5rCzUaWYybYOQ,"In the desolate almost barren landscape that is Las Vegas Mexican restaurants, finally an oasis appears called HACIENDA DEL REY. Yes, I am given to hyperbole but in a town that considers Lindo Michoacan a good restaurant, it is appropriate.

This was our second visit and it was just as good as the very first time. Did I just use a Foreigner lyric in this review? The food here is SO much better than any other local full-service Mexican restaurant, especially any place with Michoacan in their name.

This is what we have had for dinner and why you should probably have the same.

Chips and Salsa: chips were warm and I believe spent their formative years as tortillas rather than being reared in a bag, salsa was fresh and bright tasting.

Quesadilla: complimentary, tasty, and a very nice touch.

Seafood Campechana: full of shrimp, crab, pulpo, and avocado, delicious and pretty authentic as well.

Albondigas Soup: great broth, plenty of veggies, and housemade meatballs.

Carnitas: the real thing, old school well browned and succulent, big chunks and not greasy.

Steak Tampiquena: tastes of beef and the grill, cooked medium rare as ordered with a really good cheese enchilada. Puts that other place to shame.

Tortillas: made fresh in house and I prefer the corn slightly over the flour.

Rice and Beans: way above average and we finished them.

Guacamole: excellent.

We really enjoyed both meals here. The beer (Bohemia, YES!) was ice cold as were the mugs. Our server was outstanding and very attentive.

I do wish they would upgrade their Margarita program; more top-shelf and craft options available straight up or on the rocks would be nice. We want this place to stay around for many years so more advertising and promotions would be a plus.

If you think Lindo Michoacan is good, try Hacienda del Rey and see what you have been missing. GO NOW! Hope they can overcome that somewhat jinxed location.",6fr-cVNPoa5lQmGvqkIhFw,2,0,5,x1BrsdwH3U1tXJOv-J_1UQ

As soon we were seated two Sombreros with ten gallon hats would come and serenade out table with ""Guantanamera.-Wahila Gauntanamera""  I advocate this for any newly married since the tequila was intoxicating, the music lilting and the food was delicious and we couldn't wait to get to our nest.. This was the old days. Circa 2013, Las Vegas (Spanish for The Meadows)  is inundated with  Mexican restaurants in every corner and the one with the good ambiance somehow don't make it in Vegas (people don't seem to have class or taste anymore?). The Mexican food scene is changing to Food Trucks in every gas station and there is no room for ten gallon hats.

So when you hear about a new classy Mexican eatery you are attracted to it specially when it is authentic Mexican food., This location was previously  Elephant Bar, Inca and then El Patron. They all failed not to the poor location-no traffic after dark hence not enough dinner crowd.. But El Patron closed not because of the traffic but a victim of recession. 

Hacienda Del Ray, is probably the Best Ethnic Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas. This is not for Gringos who frequent taco bell and other bells or hyped up Mexican eateries who serve cheap and massive plates filled with sourcream and cheese and more oil than the spill in Alaska, but for some one who appreciate good food, the cleanliness and ambiance and even patio dining. and there are not many Mexican places with patio dining. They need good entertainment to draw the Gringos. Karaoke draws a cheap crowd and one of the singers sounded  like mating call of sea urchin,

I tried ""Fajita Hacienda"" with Chicken, Shrimp and Steak. and it was outstanding not to underestimate the Margarita on the rocks-the frozen was so so. I hope this place makes it since it is owned by a chain and they have money to spend on advertising and promotion. The service was excellent and If I write too much it will sound like I am patronizing which I am not. I find out this is a franchise and they have branches in Westchester, CA and Playa Del Ray, CA. And that is a Plus.",QsznkLEL_ljuk6UUMd1ukg,2,0,4,HUWR_HDNPwPhkTBDgNU1OQ
