388353,2016-10-12,1,COQMWoDNhnNWHafZjGh0Dw,"This used to be my preferred location for a quick breakfast.  My previous visit I ordered the grilled cheese breakfast sandwich to go.  When I arrived at work I found a sandwich with a couple of pieces of barely warm bread slopped over with some butter like goo. Not grilled, just sopping.  The cheese was cold and unmelted.  My most recent visit I ordered chicken strips and was told very snidely that ""I don't serve those until after 10:30"".  I had previously been assured that the full menu was available but it's not. I opted for a grilled chicken salad instead.  Got to work, brown salad under the top layer. It was obviously old. 

I contacted corporate and did get a prompt response which was apologetic and promised a coupon for a replacement salad. It's now been two weeks. I'm not holding my breath.  There appears to have been a management change. The gentleman that ran it so well has't been there of late and the current staff has an attitude about serving you.  The ones that speak English anyway.  I won't be going back.",G92s8G9KgXYLCm_X9EDYtg,1,1,1,vd8fqSQEqDB1B4K7YSjbYg

But since I wake up at 4 am and have breakfast pretty early... 9 am is definitely lunch. 

I typically get one of two items here ... Either the teriyaki burger... which I actually dreamed I ate last night.  OR the Sante Fe Chicken Sandwich.. (mmmm green chile)

This location always has really good food, and really good service.

Also their Dr. Pepper is not too bad either.

Most importantly, I appreciate how friendly I'm always treated.

It was a cheat (reload day) but I was in the neutral area of my caloric intake and opted for a 1/2 Lbs El Diablo burger.  Some fires shared with the GF and a small iced tea.  

Te service was good to go.  The squawk boxes the only difficulty.  At the window, all was smiles.  There was zero drama..as we consume our meal in the adjacent parking lot.

1531172,2014-08-14,6,COQMWoDNhnNWHafZjGh0Dw,"One of the few fast food options in this area- open until at least midnight, quick fix for a grilled or crispy chicken salad in the late hours, which is all I use it for. Staff is young and competent but barely.

Have never had an issue with the freshness of the produce in my salads here, nor the freshness of the crispy chicken atop. Sometimes I'll cancel out the healthiness of my salad by ordering whatever their featured fry is- bacon ranch, buffalo bleu, it changes with their promoted burgers and they're usually oversalted but that doesn't deter me.

My last visit, the cashier disappeared with my card to the back of the store to run it, which I was not particularly comfortable with, nor was I given a reason as to why. I was also not given any receipt of any sort. Bank statement reflects correct charge, but considering how prevalent CC theft is in food service, I'm not coming here again.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,4,2,h1v0vHkq527uCBVHnRd2Qw

There were no other customers at lunch time, except for the guy laying down and sleeping in one of the booths. The cashier was polite but he looked and smelled like I interrupted his afternoon joint smoking. The tables looked clean but the floor was disgusting. I watched they guy in the kitchen grab my burger patty out of a bin of already cooked burgers (probably hours ago) and toss it in to the microwave.  I got my food to go, because I wanted to get out of there ASAP. Got home and cracked open the worst burger I've had in a long time. Just terrible. I've had better hamburgers in Korea.  It was cooked hours ago, zapped in the microwave and handed to me. I gave a piece to my dog and he walked away and licked himself for 20 minutes just to get the taste out of his mouth.

3085602,2016-01-06,2,COQMWoDNhnNWHafZjGh0Dw,"Atmosphere: Dark, Uninviting
Upon entering this Carl's Jr. on a Saturday, the lighting was very dark. It was a very cold atmosphere, literally and figuratively. The two entrance doors at the south side of the building took a very long time to close. I tried pulling them shut, but doing so met with a lot of resistance. This resulted in a cold draft sneaking in from time to time. I couldn't sit at the high table without feeling a gust of wind at my back every few minutes.

Service: Not Very Fast for ""Fast food""
My order was served to me 13-15 minutes upon ordering, which was quite slow for a ""fast food"" joint, in my opinion.

Food: Not bad at all!
I ordered the Teriyaki Turkey Burger and the All Natural Burger with a side of fries and a small drink. The fries were good; crispy, hot, delicious with ketchup on them. The Teriyaki Turkey Burger had decent flavor. It was served with teriyaki sauce and a slice of pineapple. It was very messy to eat and the bun, in my opinion, was too small for such a burger. The All Natural Burger tasted just like any other burger, but without the guilt. This burger was advertised to be all-natural and non-GMO (I think?). Tasted just fine, but the red onion was just a little overpowering the rest of the burger.

Overall: Good for quick bites on the go
The price of the meal I got was about $14. This is a small combo with another burger. This not a bad price at all for what I got. I just wished that the service was a little faster.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,1,1,2,u3E5NOClRsm6iVzDZLRVbQ
3092501,2012-11-14,0,COQMWoDNhnNWHafZjGh0Dw,"I've been eating at Carl's for years and they have always been pretty good as fast food burger joints go for sure. The Western Bacon Cheeseburger is very good, the Grilled Barbeque Chicken sandwich is likewise delicious and the Cross-cut Fries are an excellent accompanyment for Carl's burgers. Lately though I've fallen in love with Carl's Turkey Burger. I've been trying to make the occasional ""healthy choice"" and this burger fits the bill when I need to grab something on the fly. This sandwich is served on a toasted whole wheat bun with plenty of lettuce, tomatoes and onions and a deliciously juicy turkey patty. Turkey patties tend to get somewhat dry when cooked, but Carl's does a good job of keeping the burger moist and succulent. If you're trying to eat health this burger is a great place to start.

BTW, this location is great! I use the drive-thru here with great regularity and the service is excellent. The location is very convenient, near the intersection of Rainbow and Westcliff and they are generally not too busy.",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,1,0,4,wAK5uObOHMNcOHRqorL5xg
