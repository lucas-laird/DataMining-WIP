215540,2014-07-19,0,3tBRBsiTi6JJz3CJ7DcS_w,"Amazing menu. Had a hard time sticking with my craving for chicken and waffles during a late night in Vegas. Ended up w/ a bacon waffle and fried chicken, and some sweet potato tots. Waffle and tots were delicious and came out quickly. Chicken wasn't as spectacular but still good. Very happy with my order. It's in an obscure area just off the strip but inside the restaurant is very nice. I liked the atmosphere a lot.",dKSWJ5qaim_laqn8q34reg,0,0,5,9hu6EmqaCr_p1fnWXouYog

We've tried something different each time and have been delighted at how tasty each item has been.  Great salad made with Kale instead of just plain lettuce for a healthier option, HUGE chicken wings fried to perfection, the Turkeygiving Burger that gives the Bobbie a run for it's money and the Chicken N Waffles..oh la la....Absolutely Delish! We will be back again very soon!",1jvcbx51XDV-KEpG93q_CA,0,0,5,uUohZ1GPzaiEuEje3pQBCQ

The menu is not overwhelming. I hate going to places and looking at the menu and not knowing where to start.  At skinny chick you have the perfect menu that makes sense. There is a healthy side and a not so healthy side. 
This is one of my new favorite spots. I recommend it to anyone.",QrWWJFlw4TYYbiNihiNV1A,0,0,5,KiJevoki1sTrkFrrdE4-zg

2253245,2014-06-24,0,3tBRBsiTi6JJz3CJ7DcS_w,Great food and great service. The chicken tenders are huge. The salads are super good. The wraps are no joke. Plenty to choose from no matter what you're in the mood for. I eat out a lot and I know when ever I'm in the area of skinychick's I'm eating there no questions asked.,FDlOn3dxF9DCYZOt0b9suw,0,0,5,wc0FJWhgz9YWNnMMyXBG_g
2828003,2014-07-10,4,3tBRBsiTi6JJz3CJ7DcS_w,"My first impression about this place is ... What an awkward location! They have stripper stores and a strip club as their neighbors. This place definitely has a rough exterior but the inside is quite different. It's much nicer and cleaner inside. This place opened just 3 weeks ago!!

I do get a ""Skinny Fats"" vibe from this place. The ambiance, the menu, and the name of the restaurant scream SKINNY FATS! ¯\_(?)_/¯

Skinny Chick's menu is a little bit more condensed than Skinny Fats though and they do focus around the chicken idea. They do have steak and turkey as well but mostly chicken is the main attraction.

I opt for the Turkeygiving burger, AKA Thanksgiving heaven in your mouth. It's a turkey burger with cranberry sauce, turkey stuffing, sweet potato and mayo. It comes with a side and i got sweet potato tots! yum! The turkey patty was made fresh and did not taste frozen. The stuffing I had a little hard time with the taste. It had a day after taste. It wash't intolerable to eat, I think it still tasted pretty good together BUT it did have that slight after taste of day old stuffing. 

I wish they had a special sauce to dip the sweet potato fries and tots in. I love when I can dip them into something sweet like maple cream sauce. 

The table I was in was still really sticky. The container/plate that came out with my burger was also pretty sticky. 

With that being said.. There was only 1 person working the entire place, which isn't a big restaurant nor was it even busy but I felt bad that he was the one taking orders, cooking the food, and waiting on us. Now that's a star employee!",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,7,7,3,XqehZVnMYFTUgtViHpUDLg
2975190,2014-06-25,0,3tBRBsiTi6JJz3CJ7DcS_w,Decent wings. Breaded which I prefer because they hold more hot sauce. A bit over cooked and at $9 + tax for 6 wings and a small salad instead of fries I thought them to be a little over priced. If they had beer I would add a star.,lyYEqqCgxrNQYJLX_yi8IA,0,0,3,knJ3_GzcOnJeecZzxkLwrA
4039423,2014-07-09,0,3tBRBsiTi6JJz3CJ7DcS_w,"I tried this place out after looking through the ""hot and new"" filter of Las Vegas restaurants. It's located on industrial by the Can Can room and some adult stores.

I was a little skeptical with the idea as a picture of the menu reminded me of SkinnyFats so I thought it was like a knock off, but I actually had a good experience.

You order at the register and there's about 3 or four booths and a couple of tables so the place is pretty small. They have paper menus by the register and their menus also hang off of the ceiling. 

They have burgers, wings, fries, wraps, and salads.

We had a nice young gentlemen who took our order, brought out our food, and cleaned up after us. It was nice that he checked on us a few times. With this type of ordering system they have you usually just get your food dropped off and that's it.

I got the thanksgiving burger with sweet potato fries, a 4 piece fingers with fries, and a 6 piece wings with fries. This was for three people. 

My burger was really good! The patty was seasoned well, was juicy, and some tasty herbs. It had Sage mayo, cranberry, and stuffing. The sweet potato fries were good and the serving was just right. My only criticism of this is they should totally butter the bun and toast it slightly & they should put more mayo. I know that's fat but it would really make a difference.

The regular fries were also delicious & their fingers were on point. Nicely seasoned, juicy still, & a good portion.

I always consider food cost and what I'm getting so I felt good about the meal after we all left.

After I left I didn't feel like they tried to rip SkinnyFats anymore. I think their focus may be more on the chicken items hence their name. 

All in all I'd go back for sure to try some other things. It was clean, the staff was nice, it's affordable, and they have a lot of unique things.

The staff should definitely put out a better tip jar. Just saying. The paper cup isn't cute. I just left it under the cup I left. Hope they got it!",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,4,0,4,RC1_N27w-KX0l3O9UzM9uA
4239290,2014-09-29,0,3tBRBsiTi6JJz3CJ7DcS_w,I've eaten here a couple of times and it's really good.  If you are really hungry you want to do the AYCE Wings and Fries so good and it was really fast coming out.  Then another thing you want to try is their Turkeysgiving Burger.  It was way better than the Bobbie at Cappriotti's,O2M4ivz2YgPRAopuud-4iA,0,0,5,qVRx4eQBSw4lwIEPcfdrQw
