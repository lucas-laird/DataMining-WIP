When I had first come to this pizza place it was different they had so many different kinds already made. I'm vegetarian so there's not too many types that I can eat. I narrowed it down to the olive pizza. After having it every time, it wasn't available anymore after stopping in. If I want it again, I'll have to order a whole pizza. Which is ok because I used to buy whole pizzas pieced together.  The customer service is best after midnight. This is when I will try back.

** 9/3/17 This shop now gave up space to the donut shop. :( let's just say I'm disappointed. And I no longer eat here. They still exist, but in a small area. For awhile they had calzones for $5- They were good and filling too.",5Bs1BZcD6_wo_sUiAGe7FA,3,1,4,QrOumkNORHH4MXVfzOFtYw

I was going to pay my pizza with my AMEX card, the clerk accepted the card but it didn't work for him, he kept sliding my card and nothing happened before he got help from another girl and she said oh we don't accept Amex although they have a big sticker on the cashier that says they accept Amex,discovery etc etc and I pointed that out and they said oh we don't know. Obviously they didn't have a lot of knowledge of what was going on and the guy was probably new, I don't blame him. Anyways I gave them a different card, a visa and that worked but now when I got home I looked up my statement online and they double charged my visa. I called the store and got to
speak with the manager Karyn. Karyn was going to call her boss and look this up for me and call me back. I didn't hear anything back for a while so I called back again and she said that her record shows they only charged me one time which is not true, I got a statement from my bank proving this. So she told me you gotta call your bank, they probably charged you twice and I'm like the bank doesn't charge me anything, you do! Anyways I called my bank and they confirmed voodoo pizza charges me twice. So I call Karyn back and told her you guys need to refund me the money, she once again says she needs to call her boss and see what the refund payment options are and that she is going to call me back to let me know. Now 3 days later I have heard nothing and I've called them everyday to see what's going on but Karyn is never available, and I have told them to leave a not for her twice now to call me back again but I have heard nothing. They say she will come in at this and that time and when I call around that time she is gone already or not there.... I'm going to dispute a double charge with my bank now, was it worth it voodoo pizza? Be aware guys.",1Z4r93pIlisj7eTDjjy8eA,0,0,1,I080OMw-h5T5N6AeMf4QqQ

I ordered two slices of meat lovers that arrived with a rock hard crust. Sure the pizza was passable, but its no fun if you cant eat the entire slice. If you just need some cheap eats on the strip, don't be afraid to swing by!",54PyGYYuKLCVLnmI2zDsvQ,1,0,3,3LsETbrFZi4F8VGEsiUjLw

Not only does Eric provide the greatest customer service I've seen in Vegas, It also the greatest customer service I have had ever! The food, the pizza is amazing and their calzone is to die for!

5645679,2018-03-22,0,-xX-Vjol_fwWaN2mn1F1wg,"First I should note that the hours listed here are wrong -they are not open 24/7.  In a city that parties until 4a, they close at 2a. Further, they accept GrubHub orders at 1:10am with an est wait of 30-40min, then cancel them b/c they close at 2...that math doesn't add up to me but hey, guess they don't want the business. Now I get to wait 2-3 business days to get my $37 pizza (that's right...one Pizza with only pepperoni) refunded all because of poor management and/or lazy employees.",phsDm7coAiXBV4rCEURedA,4,0,1,vk2TbSzVUR2y0_xm00Lbxw
