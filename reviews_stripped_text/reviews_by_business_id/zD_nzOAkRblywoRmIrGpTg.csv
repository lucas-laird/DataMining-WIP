I know good BBQ and southern food so I got ribs and the hot links greens and Mac n cheese and it was so good I came back the next day and got the burgers and catfish sandwich which were also yummy,so I decided to make sure this business got on yelp and everyone comes and support it. Very nice family and there isn't a lot of space, but I order to go anyways.  I wish I made pictures of the ribs but I will next time",o7Y-1wa7D5Xh7malhP2Vgg,1,0,5,82clYXfr6RVViNC3P8Wirg

4458482,2018-06-17,0,zD_nzOAkRblywoRmIrGpTg,"Food was good! This is my chest day therefore, I got the fish and chicken combo it came with french fries, onion rings, and hushpuppies.  (3 catfish, 5 chicken party wings)They were out of onion ring so they just gave me more fries.  The hushpuppies were THE bomb! I want just an order of those next time, omg!  They had a hint of jalapeno in them which I never had before, but it complimented them very well.   The caramel cake is delicious! I had already taken a few bites of it before thought to take a pic.  Will be back to try some different dishes!",4V5nEhLLrqNx16SXsLTqYQ,0,0,4,AEjwzJkPfYA_bmFvqDxI3w

5924407,2017-12-30,0,zD_nzOAkRblywoRmIrGpTg,Found this spot on yelp had good reviews seems like it hasn't been open to long but I'm new to Vegas and was exploring and decided to come check it out I placed my order and it wasn't to long of a wait I got the 1 meat special the meat was hot links which they just so happen to run out of beef links and all they had was chicken so I was thrilled I just assumed everyone just used beef or pork they meal was great I had a well severed portion for what I payed my sides was the smoked cabbage and baked beans which was good to the only reason I gave 4 out of 5 I ordered cornbread and got white sand which bread was looking forward to the cornbread but all in all I would go back I also got cake can't wait to try that,zSyDdamonHjja73giyMajg,1,0,4,SUpJRqV6zAsba2O1tE43OQ
