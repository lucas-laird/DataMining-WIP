Sometimes all of the food is hot and delicious and other times it is cold and tastes as if it has been sitting out for awhile.  I have gotten to the point of looking in the trays to see what looks fresh and what doesn't.  I have gone in when they have cooked each item I ordered fresh.  That was the best!!  I'd rather wait to have  hot, fresh food than mediocre food that has been sitting out too long.",VR2LBLed_sKouYkbOtcivQ,0,0,3,PBbYAFKNuTApxELFYCHTrg

The last several times I have had to wait almost 20 minutes because they have nothing made. Today I am at 22 minutes and still waiting. If I wanted to wait for my Chinese I would go to a restaurant. There are about 8 people waiting for food. Also they made half of my order while waiting on the rest so that will probably be cold.

All the guys working there were professionals. We had to wait for one of our sides to  be cooked and they brought it to our table. It turned out nice and fresh so we didn't mind the wait. My husband and I like to split a three-item combo. If we feel like having leftovers then we will order separate combos.

4792351,2011-11-06,0,K0FtmxCgqJEbDNCyXyMX_w,"This was my first experience with Panda Express and I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though they were pretty busy the place was very clean and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed - much more enjoyable than your typical fast food experience.  The staff working the line were very polite, friendly, and efficient!  I also like the 'plate' concept they use - pick a side, then pick 2 or 3 entrees.  (When I go to an authentic Chinese restaurant I can never decide on just one thing to order!)  The Orange Chicken and Beijing Beef were delicious, although the Fried Rice disappointed me - the rice was undercooked and was pretty much flavorless overall.  We loved their hot chili sauce - it had a great flavor and was actually spicy enough to satisfy us! ;)

Keep in mind this is still fast food- so if you're looking for a place with authentic cuisine I'd try somewhere else.  Great in a pinch though - we'll definitely be coming back!",RLAv9x80WxQqoYjdwYigjw,1,1,4,qYakLBQ2XqM6OTrhoig5fw

They are probably one of the most hard working individuals and satisfying co-workers I have worked with. To say, something less than ""okay"" is an embarrassment to their character and working ethics. I am proud to return and see that the food is as amazing and tasty as I remembered. Attitude and customer care is at its best. They cover the expectations of how a ""fast/express"" restaurant should always run. As much as I miss this team of mine. It is difficult to read the comments by people who doesn't understand the portion and quality this specific Panda store is capable of. Guys keep doing what you are doing! You are doing nothing wrong at all! Best luck and know that this ""guy"" has your back.

5054148,2014-02-15,1,K0FtmxCgqJEbDNCyXyMX_w,"Where else do you turn to for super Americanized Chinese food!? It's really what you expect for this restaurant. There is a certain taste, a tang, for every single dish that is served here. The food is consistent, but just okay. Not good, not great! Plus, the chow mien is super greasy every time! But all dishes just fill you up really. It's fast food--it made me not want to eat for a day!! 

If you're trying to eat healthfully, don't stoop to Panda Express! Go next door to subway, because PE is just too greasy to be healthy :P 

This location is not that busy. There are no super long lines, and the place is clean because not a huge number of people visit! Also, the staff is welcoming and friendly. Sometimes they get sidetracked, but it's not too long of a wait time.

I normally don't like ordering food from here but when you have that craving or the area  is just limited to type of restaurants for a cheap, fast dinner. Anyway each time I come here it's usually in the early part of the evening (630-730ish), their pans are bare. They do not close till 9 or whatever time and what am I gonna order??? I'm sure they can cook more but they'll make you wait and rush the cooking. Why not have the pans filled, are they conserving? It seems also one time about 8pm, they are cleaning and mopping in the kitchen area. Barely any food in pans. I am not having them prepare me anything because I am not gonna be contaminated with cleaning chemicals. I've decided to eat elsewhere. The chicken teriyaki was also a bit rushed, undercooked and lacked flavor of the marinade.

5775617,2014-10-29,0,K0FtmxCgqJEbDNCyXyMX_w,"First, we usually enjoy Panda Express: and over the last few years, have eaten at MANY different locations in both Las Vegas and other cities. We understand that the POOR experience we had here is because of ignorant franchise owners at a single location and not a reflection on Panda Express in general. Nevertheless, we learned the hard way not all Pandas are created equal!

UGHHHH. Unfortunately, we made the mistake of trying this Panda Express because it was very close to the doctor's office where my 94 year old Mom had an appointment.

It was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon...well after lunchtime and before dinner. There was nobody eating there, but EVERY table was DIRTY with crumbs, noodles, spilled soda, etc.It was disgusting. We couldn't find ONE clean table to sit at. I went up to the food line to ask someone if they could wipe down a table and was ignored for at least a good 2-3 minutes by the manager and three members of the cooking staff who seemed to be very busy talking at top volume in Spanish. Finally, a woman with a name tag that said ""Manager"" came up to me thinking I was ordering food and barked, ""What do you want?"" I answered, ""We'd like a clean table to sit, can you wipe off a table for us?"" She seemed annoyed, ""Give me a minute."" FIVE more minutes passed as she proceeded to leave us standing and waiting (a 94 year old woman on a walker) as her loud conversation and laughing with employees continued.

I had to ask her one MORE time AGAIN if we could please have a clean table . Finally she begrudgingly came over with a wet wash rag to wipe. I asked her if she was the manager to which she replied in a challenging tone, ""No, I am the assistant, why?"" I said, ""Because all the tables in your restaurant are dirty. Don't you think you might have more business if you didn't have to leave customers standing and waiting several minutes to sit at a clean table?"" 

Oh, she didn't LIKE that. She gave me the stink eye and walked away. We should have just LEFT at that point, but unfortunately didn't. After wiping ONE table for us, she retreated back behind the food line and continued blabbering away with employees in Spanish, apparently comfortable to continue leaving all the other tables in the restaurant dirty.

When we finally went to order, half of the selection trays looked almost empty and dried out. They acted annoyed that some of our order choices required them to cook fresh. My mom only wanted a water to drink, so we got her a water cup. The second time the caregiver took my mom's water cup over to the drink bar for a refill, she put ice tea in it. The ""Manager"" noticed right away and came over scolding her,"" Those cups are for water only, you'll need to pay for that tea!""

Yeah,they can leave customers standing around and waiting ten munites before they can be bothered to come and wipe down a dirty table, but a 94 year old woman drinking a tea she didn't pay for...IMMEDIATE response. SCREW you, Panda Express! BOO HISS! 

BTW...we paid them the $1.72 they demanded for my mom's tea.

The last part of our negative experience here actually happened while we were eating. We started to slowly become aware of the odor of sour mop and garbage. The longer we stayed, the more noticeable it became. Determined it was coming from BOTH of the inside garbage cans in the restaurant which were filled to the brim (No customers in the place, but too busy to wipe off tables and empty the trash). We can only conclude that from the smell, when they DO empty the trash, they don't bother to clean or sanitize the liner pails. GROSS!

I CAN report that none of us experienced any sickness or food poisoning as a result of our meal here. When we left, that was a concern in the back of my mind. If you are considering eating at Panda Express, you will be much more pleased to drive five more minutes to the location at Durango and 215. That Panda Express knows what they are doing. They have consistently fresh food, a clean and pleasant interior, and really friendly employees that really care about your meal.",fLiDKj6MmMrzgNJDazZrIg,1,0,1,IS3_WFHOmiTMO0uzxvR1QQ

Today a combo of half fried rice/veggie chow mein with two entree choices with tax costs $8.00+ What's worse today is their meager portioning of your entree choices....this Panda Unit is the cheapest of all that I've been to in Las Vegas.....you get home and yes lots of greasy fried rice and chow mein but it's like two tablespoons each of your entree choices....a better deal is ordering one takeout entree with steamed rice from a regular Chinese restaurant...enough to feed two people for $9 or $10.,mYuaXH4LULtDUJQyEn4YDw,0,0,2,LZgqKVlaU-gXXirl9LdONA
