We've been there twice because of the delicious, fresh and authentic food and the excellent service. They have Guacamole to die for!

425301,2017-04-27,0,rbWL5eZCaHLqhpLd84xwUg,"This restaurant is by far the best Mexican food that I have tried in Las Vegas. My boyfriend and I were looking for a good Mexican restaurant where we could get great food, that welcome feeling you get when going to a Mexican restaurant, and not too pricy; which is exactly what the place has to offer. The location was a little hard to find and that is the only negative thing I would say. For starters we ordered chips, salsa and guacamole. The chef made the guacamole to order (never had that done before) and the chips came out very fresh. We both ordered a couple tacos, because who could go wrong with taco, and neither of us has ever had a taco so flavorful and well executed. We would recommend their El Cachi specialty taco which is carne asada, avocado and pico de gallo and absolutely delicious.  For only being open for a couple months they definitely made some loyal customers. Kudos to them!",oTaAg6OpdhuDW4mmt52J1g,0,0,5,JTLHbI5LkGpCSaEzOmdzGA
913035,2017-04-12,1,rbWL5eZCaHLqhpLd84xwUg,If you guys like authentic Mexican food this is the place to eat!! The food is real and flavorful and fresh!! And the company isn't bad either!! Fernando and Jose the owners and workers are nice and you can really tell they have a passion for there business. I recommend the shrimp plate! It's spicy and garlicky and full of flavor!! My husband is not partial to Mexican cuisine but I think el cachi has changed his mind!! He had the chicken fajitas and empanadas and loved them!! Oh and the carnitas were the best i have ever had!!,XfoD6h0fmAIZo_yoP9ZnDQ,1,1,5,aNLayVHiQifvmj0nlBgpOw
1007411,2017-05-14,0,rbWL5eZCaHLqhpLd84xwUg,"Had a long layover in Vegas and picked this from Yelp reviews as an excellent casual Mexican restaurant for a light lunch on a Saturday.  We were not disappointed. Short Uber from the airport and if you had no bags it would't be a bad walk. 

For the three of us we ordered an order of chicken fajitas, a couple of the the shrimp tacos and three of the house special El Cachi tacos. Flavoring on all was great as well as excellent guacamole and chips with salsa (which were free with a Facebook check in)

Staff were friendly and helpful. It's a small restaurant (~15 seats with a couple more outdoors) tucked into a motel complex. 

Well worth the visit.  Best tacos I've had in a long while and the shrimp tacos were truly special.",Ewz0Cx-XuMb-cETqam6-KQ,1,1,5,NjqLoulViaTeQanaYbv8vQ
1008201,2017-05-23,0,rbWL5eZCaHLqhpLd84xwUg,I work close by to the restaurant and decided one day I was going to check out what they had to offer. It is small humble place to walk into and the guys great you right away. I love that the cook actually puts in time to speak to his customers as well. Overall the food is AMAZING!!! Their carne asada burrito is to die for!!! I went in today for lunch and found out that Friday will be their last day... I was crushed. I really hope that the owner decides to move eventually re open because I will make the drive to eat their food again. The ladies from SFR will miss you!!!,aeDXy-6U0Tn0SEwu5AiQ_w,0,0,5,6pu7Jl3Fs74ThKejLXf_eQ

1808626,2017-04-12,9,rbWL5eZCaHLqhpLd84xwUg,"Apparently I'm in the minority, but I was underwhelmed by El Cachi. Let me preface this by saying I was a huge fan of the previous Mexican restaurant in this hard-to-find spot (El Frescos Cocina Mexicana). For whatever reason, they closed. The menu got tweaked, but prices stayed pretty much the same (read: high) and the new name is very similar. If you aren't looking closely, you might think it's the same business-  but the food isn't as good. 

The shrimp tacos I used to get here regularly were legendary. They were $6 but totally worth it. The new menu specifically calls the new shrimp tacos the ""house favorite""-- new tacos are a buck less but they don't even compare. The grilled shrimp wasn't seasoned, the mango salsa lacked discernible citrus notes, and the chipotle cream tasted like it was cut with mustard. It's a totally different taco, and I'm bummed about it. 

I also tried their carne asada el cachi taco, made with rib eye, and it was okay but the soggy singly-ply corn tortilla tore like half a bite in. How do so many reviews use the word ""authentic"" when they use ONE corn tortilla per taco?! It's gotta be double-thick, y'all. Taco Science 101.  

My server was friendly, asked for feedback and seemed genuinely interested in how they can improve, which is awesome. I really want to rave about this place but right now their tacos are just A-OK. Is it fair to judge a new business against the standard set by their predecessors? Well, when you offer the exact same cuisine, you're inviting the comparisons. Please make the shrimp tacos great again!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,11,3,nvxF-RHv96eUO8sYW6JNrw
1995248,2017-03-31,0,rbWL5eZCaHLqhpLd84xwUg,When you walk in you pick your seat and they service you like a restaurant would. The chips and salsa are made fresh and by hand. When the food was brought out to us you can tell they were just made. Once we got our food it tasted freshly made. It tastes authentic 100%. The place is extremely clean and fast service even when it's busy.,ySwCwPBDCxoHTu6XzTBONw,0,1,5,WfYRLyzMozXqNAfE8znllw

As soon as we walked in the owner Fernando made us feel like we were long times friends just joining him for dinner at home. He was very welcoming and so was his helper.

3074908,2017-05-05,2,rbWL5eZCaHLqhpLd84xwUg,"Haven't written a review in maybe years but must give 5 stars to this hidden gem located in a seedy motel.  There was a CLS 550 so not sure if they were there for tacos or parked in one of the motels upstairs..... hey -  HOOKERS, TACOS Y MAS 

Some of the best tacos I've ever had - juicy, fat pieces of carnitas.   Mahi Mahi, shrimp tacos - carne asada delicious.

There's only about 15 seats so soon this place will be flooded and they will expand SOON.  They also do catering.   Fernando and everyone there super friendly and will take care of you.   Check In Yelp specials - definitely check this spot out.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,3,3,5,gzTGl9n9RRaMgfbZHOr80Q

3362770,2017-05-15,0,rbWL5eZCaHLqhpLd84xwUg,"Hands down one of the best hole in the wall places I've ever been to!! To be very honest why I would give this place 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the location. The location is super confusing to follow because the first sign you see will have an arrow pointing to take a left turn, BUT in small print it says ""in 500 ft"" so naturally people will see a sign for El Cachi and turn the corner. It'll take you to a very SUSPICIOUS area and you'll think to yourself al I in the right place. Yes you are, but just get back and turn at the second sign which isn't as big but it's the right one. You'll feel like you're in an apartment complex and you will only know you're in the right place when you see a sign that says El Cachi.

The food was AMAZING!! I love the fact that this place is a Mom-and-Pops-kinda feeling with no fancy decor; just tables, chairs and some TVs. The prices of the place is pretty affordable and I felt like for the food I ordered it should've been so much more. I ordered the Asada platter that came with rice, beans and tortillas, while my boyfriend ordered the daily special of Tilapia tacos with rice and beans. Next time I already told my boyfriend that next time I come back to Las Vegas, first thing we do is eat here!",RhoTdP02R40f29RbvB_HSA,1,1,4,XGOm0QPb-8es75N3MnieIg
