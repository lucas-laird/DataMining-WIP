He wasn't busy and wasn't trying to rush us, he was just genuinely concerned about his service being timely.  And when my wife ordered her cheesecake to go, Brandon brought her cheesecake out for her approval before he boxed it up.  Let me say that again... For her approval.  Who cares like that anymore?

To specify on the location, the host was extremely nice; handed the little one her own menu. He was inviting and had a good attitude.
Sit down and immediately get the vibe our server is disappointed with our table. I'm assuming it's because we have a kid with us.
Every time the water went empty he'd mention he was going to get water and 5 minutes later he still wasn't back with water.
He didn't come check to see how our meals were. He went to the table behind us 3 times before he came back to our table.
Our dirty plates sat in front of us for 10 mins before he came over and asked us if we wanted dessert. Meanwhile our waters were still empty.
I noticed a manager; Lady, Wearing purple, that seemed to just walk by. She didn't look very happy.

As for the company.

I got it and it looked fine but about halfway though eating it, I noticed that there was ground beef in my soup!! I let the waitress know and she handled it horribly. She told me that there was no beef it in it. She brought it back to the kitchen then came back with the same half-eaten dish and put it in front of me proceeding to imply that I was wrong! The manager got involved and told me that they had mixed two soups in the kitchen together - a vegetarian and non-vegetarian soup.

1182814,2010-08-25,0,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"The Olive Garden is one of those chain restaurants that I just can't help returning to for great tasting food at a reasonable price.  It's not always healthy food, but I love Italian-style food in general, and Olive Garden serves some tasty dishes.

Most of the time I go here it is to take advantage of their Soup, Salad & Breadsticks lunch special.  You get as much as you want of each for just $7.95.  Usually I get the Minestrone soup because it is vegetarian, but I have tried the Zuppa Toscana, which is rich and delicious, but also high in calories and cholesterol. 

I only occasionally go in the evening because the dinner menu is more expensive (most entrees are in the $15-20 range), but all the ones I've tried have been very good.  And after filling up on salad and breadsticks, I always end up taking at least half the entree home, so it's like I'm getting two meals for that price.

According to one of the waiters who recently served my friend and me, most of their meat cuts do not contain nitrates, although certain cuts do.  If you want to avoid it, just ask your waiter.  Ours was very helpful. 

Also, for the gluten-sensitive, there are gluten-free menu options.

I think it's all the Olive Gardens in the Las Vegas area that are for one reason or another are all bad.

Compared to the Phoenix restaurants all the Olive Gardens here need to change or update their menu.

We will not be coming back to any of the Olive Gardens in the area. I think someone from corporate needs to look at all of them and see what's going on.",OoUYP1Do5EZ9mfQ4guYd4Q,0,0,1,AuZ4twCXLn3GZ5ERihmv6g

1634325,2013-11-02,4,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"I picked up some dinner here after seeing their current promotion on tv. Buy one pasta (from the choices offered) and take one pasta to eat later for $12.99 plus tax. Make sure and tell them which pasta you want first so you get that one hot since the second one will be cold and intended to be reheated. I got the spaghetti and 4 cheese meat sauce and mezzaluna ravioli with 5 cheese marinara. The spaghetti was good but the ravioli heated up later was probably a dish that is better eaten right away rather than later since the ravioli was a but dry around the edges. I had some pasta e fagioli and it always reminds me of Italian chili... so damn good.

Make sure if you are placing an order for pick up or curbside to go that you ask how many breadsticks they will give you. This location likes you rip you off on the amount of breadsticks your supposed to get if you don't eat inside. I ordered a side of alfredo dipping sauce and asked for a couple extra breadsticks. The girl over the phone taking my order said she could only give me 2 with my meal and 1 for the dipping sauce. Seriously??? They charge $3.79 for the dipping sauce and barely give you any in the to go cup as it is and you are only going to tell me this crap? This girl was short with me and made me feel like I was bothering her for even placing an order. I asked to speak to the manager, who said I was allowed 4 breadsticks for the 2 pastas I ordered and 2 for the dipping sauce. The manager said she had no idea why the girl taking my order would tell me that and that she would talk to her. When I arrived to pick up my order the manager personally gave me my food and apologized again. She ended up giving me like 10 breadsticks and extra dipping sauce so that was cool. I wish I could give 4 stars because the food is usually good even for not being real Italian food but customer service is not always great and if eating inside or picking up a phone order it takes longer than it should.

I won't hate on this chain. Mostly because I've learned to appreciate the art of chain eating. I am a foodie, and that means appreciating culinary art at locally owned restaurants, but also indulging at chain restaurants that succeed on processed, frozen foods just because it's fun.

On this particular night, I was exhausted from unpacking my stuff, and wanted to have a fun meal out with my parents. We chose this location, and it lived up to my OG expectations.

Service was great, and the food was A-Ok.

Was it the best, most authentic Italian food ever? No. Did I expect that? No.

Did it do the job? Yes.

2205582,2017-02-11,2,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"So this is one of the nicest Olive Gardens I have seen from the outside. Very pretty and well kept.

The restrooms were not very clean at all, a lot of debris not only on the inside but outside the door to restroom as well among other things.

So good and service was good. We went on a Friday around 3... didn't think it would be really busy around this time but it sure took a long time for our food. We got our breadsticks a whole 20 minutes before our salad. Then salad and food after . 

Waitress was great though and managed to eventually get the refill, napkins and anything else we needed when we finally did see her.

Main complaint?? I have always held Olive Garden on a higher standard than others and was extremely surprised that at the big dining table next to ours , they were doing individual performance reviews on employees. While I'm dining with my family for Valentines I don't need to hear one of your waiters personal performance criteria/critiques. That he is at 63% with wine and needs to be at a 69% and sell that better and on point with his appetizers . I don't need to know what his goal for the night/ month is. That is extremely unprofessional to do in front of customers... 
 
I don't know how it works with restaurants as far as where these meetings take place but I suggest at least not in a busy Friday evening .

This is the problem when you watch late night TV. You're watching old reruns of Star Trek Next Gen and then a commercial comes on advertising the never ending pasta bowl. The next thing you know, we find ourselves in front of the local OG. 

Curses. My susceptible mind is weak to the lure of salad and bread sticks. 

We both order the pasta bowl special for $8.95. We remembered Misti Y's tale about $4 marinara dipping sauce and vehemently declined the offer. (Our waitress did not disclose the cost to us also...sketchy...). My hubby starts with the chicken/gnocchi soup and I start mowing down my first salad bowl. The soup lacked dumplings and seasoning. The salad was limp from being out in the Vegas climate too long. 

My hubby ordered orrichete with Parmesan portabello sauce while I tried their Chianti meat sauce with whole wheat linguine. Subsequent order included a penne with the Chianti meat sauce. The parmesan sauce was bland albeit the portabello flavours did come through. The Chianti meat sauce has less acidity than their regular meat sauce but again bland. 

The pasta was not al dente and overly soft. The whole wheat linguine was broken down into 2 inch strands that wouldn't twirl on a fork. I speared a penne pasta and just watched it droop on my utensil . Gives a whole new concept of limp noodles. 

You know that you've been had when the best part the meal is the chocolate mint at the end.

Went to the lunch menu and decided we'd eat soup and salad and I'd get a meaqtball sandwich.  Every thing was great until I opened my utensil napkin and notice the knife had a ton of garbage on it so I asked the waiter to exchange it.  He was a bit rude and took the knife but never brought a replacement.  Good thing the wife had one.  When our food came I again noticed both my forks were filthy with crude on it so I ended wiping them with my napkin.  Unbelievable how this place has gone down the tube since it opened, we've been coming here since then but I think we'll find another place to eat.  Not Happy!!!  On top of all that one thing I notice was the amount of tip the little stupid machine did to the receipt--it added a few cents to the tip I chose, WOW, for service that wasn't that good to begin with in the first place.",fYBwTpuyK5ujW2vZs9OWlQ,1,0,1,4Rr_r_p8YbJlSMqD_q_s2Q

The food is great, especially for their deals. AYCE soup and salad for 7.95 and AYCE pasta bowl or $9.99 (that also includes AYCE soup OR salad). 

The pasta combinations are endless an delicious. I always add their breaded chicken for an extra 3 bucks. 

The peach tea is amazing! Favorite part is the real half of peach inside that I love to nibble on.

Sounds great right?! Te problem is customer service. The waiter was rude, never once smiled and I swear he was a serial killer. Maybe it was the fact that my daughter spilled her sprite but come on, that was an accident! And yes, I did say no tomatoes on the group salad but that's because I'm allergic. Next, on the same salad I said dressing in the side but that's because our friend was watching her weight. I don't really think we were being difficult but still doesn't mean we deserve bad service.

Tip- everyone should tip servers AT LEAST 18% off of the original tab. If that's too hard to figure out just do 20% or use your CELL PHONE to figure out how much tip to leave.

We researched to see which Olive Garden was closest to us and proceeded to place the order. There was a coupon spot at checkout so we tried a code from an email I had received and it worked for 15% off the order. TOGO15. Not sure how long this code lasts, but if I can help another family enjoy some savings on Olive Garden food, I am happy to help. We ordered a build your own pasta with meat sauce and meat balls, chicken giardino and some soups: minestrone and chicken with gnocchi and always some of the fabulous breadsticks which of you can believe it are even better when dipped in the salad dressing! Lastly, we finished up with a delicious lemon cream cake.

I received the confirmation email and off I was to go pick it up. The wife prepped the wine so the Italian meal could go down upon my return. I arrived at Olive Garden and they had plenty of designated parking right up front for TOGO orders. I walked in and they have a wide counter next to the bar with two employees working orders for just TOGO. The cold dessert was placed on some warm food so the manager replaced it with a fresh one and gave it to me for free. They also put another bag of 4 breadsticks and salad dressing in the bag. Thank You! Quick to pay and back on my way. 

The food was packed very well and everything was nice, fresh and hot; and of course the bread was scrumptious dipped in the dressing! Truly a great experience!",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,4,3,5,MujjRdbcdD5uYT8VfM-tHQ

This review is for Valentine's Day, 2010. This Olive Garden doesn't take reservations, like most Olive Gardens, so we waited an hour for our table like the rest of Summerlin. I took this as my excuse to get some alcohol in my system.

There were three bartenders on staff, which is not enough when you consider they were also mixing for the house. I am understanding, and felt my bartender gave service above and beyond, considering. I did not much care for the pom margarita, but it got the job done.

Which is basically what you can say of the food. It's good, but for the price we could go to a non-chain Italian place and get better food/better service.

We chose to sit at the bar and got seated right away.  The nice part about sitting at the bar is the two TVs they have mounted, which were playing an NBA game. The bad thing is that you have to sit next to strangers. 

Service started out pretty well, we got our drinks, salad, breadsticks, and soup rather quickly. We didn't get our meals until much later though. It even tasted like our pasta was reheated; some parts of my fettuccine Alfredo were already stiff, not soft. Additionally, we never received our appetizer. I had to ask if they were working on it as we were receiving our entrees. The waiter stated that he thought we already received our appetizer. We decided to cancel it, but he said since the kitchen already started it, he would just take if off the bill and give it to us to go.

While this was a very nice gesture, I still didn't appreciate the wait and the reheated pasta. Olive Garden just isn't as good as it used to be, especially in regards to their food.

Located across from Red Rock Hotel, near by Costco, BJ's and Island (summerlin)
Restaurant is spacious. We were greeted and got a table right away.
Our waitress (Haimanot) was SUPER nice and very attentive to our request.
We started with a bottle of Moscato, love that sparkling wine, and some Cabernet (red)
We ordered some bread sticks with the Alfredo sauce (of course), some mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce, some  5 cheese fonduta that was alright, little greasy 
The waitress brought us the house salad. I used to enjoy it. I don't think it's anything amazing about it, they use iceberg salad so it's kind of plain.
I like that salad with no croutons but extra olives :)
tour of Italy where you have lasagna, Alfredo fettuccine and some chicken parmigiana  (by the way in Italy they don't have any Alfredo Sauce Lol) looks like the kids liked it. Portion is good for sharing
sea food Alfredo with shrimp and scallop. It was barely any Alfredo sauce and I could could shrimp and scallop, it was dry not moist :/ 
If you don't have a big appetite do not eat the bread stick because you won't finish your plate if you do...
They offered Bella her 16's birthday cake slice she could choose from the Menu.
2 co workers of our waitress came to sing the Happy Birthday! Thanks god Haimanot was sweet and Happy because the Co-workers looked annoyed that they have to sing Happy Birthday :/

Our Experience was alright, service was excellent but the food wasn't as I remembered it :/
If I have to choose between Olive Garden and Roma Deli (that place is real Italian), I will pick in a heart beat Roma Deli

I am sad to say, this was my final try with Olive Garden. They have gone down hill, slowly but surely. I have tried Centennial twice and on March 9, 2018 Summerlin for the final goodbye.

The customer service up front, was a 50/50. There was this young asian girl who just looked and acted she did not want to be there. The nice young black man asked her to seat us first. She rolled her eyes at him, didnt say a word and kept walking... we were like ""should we follow her, what are we doing?"" Lol. 

The server came and he was alright for the rest of the night. He was nice but tricked us to order all kinds of sides. The trick is saying ""I will get you a side of alfredo sauce for your breadsticks, it's delicious"" come to find out later he charged us $3.79 every time he brought that out. Smh. Never again.

The food was not that great. We were excited to do the neverending pasta special. Yup, only did 1 bowl and it was enough. We didnt even finish the pasta. The pasta was old, it was mostly clumped up and turned color (like it old). There was barely any sauce on each of our bowls. I think they were short on sauce or they are just stingy. We had to fill ourselves with the breadstick and salad, it was the only thing that was well worth to eat. Smh. Never again.

So, I am very disappointed, Olive Garden was one of my childhood favorites. But after giving them a chance 3 times. It's time to try something else.",Hf-jGNS9it5_fcfiH44Qgw,2,0,3,zSaex1nwT4sL73aWiric2w

Especially, when they advertise new pasta dishes, sauces, and the never ending pasta bowl.  One can never go wrong going to lunch there for their all you can eat soup, salad, and breadsticks for $7.95.

OG favorites are the salad, breadsticks, alfredo dipping sauce (for the breadsticks), zuppa toscana, and the chianti braised short ribs!

The only reason I give it four stars is because this location is always clean, consistent, professional, and not in a sketchy area.  I also believe this location has outdoor seating.  Other bonus points for this location are that it is nestled in with other restaurants such as BJ's Brewhouse, Agave, Islands Fine Burgers, and L&L Hawaiian BBQ.  

The only downside of this location is, while their servers/staff are always friendly and helpful, they sometimes seem overworked in a sense they are servicing too many tables and can't keep up.  It's really nothing to complain about because I see the staff are definitely busy attending to other tables and, after all, it's Olive Garden, not Ferraro's.

Large Rigatoni w/ bacon Sun Dried Tomato Sauce w/ Chicken Meatballs - 1 Star - Not enough sauce, pasta was way over done and stuck together. The only thing that saved the dish was the chicken meatballs.

There was about a 15 minute wait when we arrived on a Friday night. Looking around, there were plenty of tables opened, but I guess they were short on staff. A couple of booths were open at the bar area along with plenty of bar seating but we were never offered a spot there. We decided to wait it out. No biggie. 

Our server provided speedy service. No complaints here. They had a great deal going on: three course Italian dinner for $12.95.

Appetizer: You can choose from unlimited salad or soup. I chose the salad. Your typical appetizer salad. My boyfriend got chicken gnocchi soup. This was alright. Gnocchi had a grainy consistency to it. But the soup was tasty. He finished the bowl. Hot and fresh breadsticks were also brought out. No sauce. Sauce is an extra charge. 

Entree: I got the three cheese ravioli. Your typical ravioli. I really wish I had hot sauce to give it some flavor. I should seriously carry a bottle of hot sauce in my bag at all times for this! Anyways, my boyfriend got the Penne di Mare. This is pretty good. Small pieces of shrimp with cream sauce over penne pasta. Apparently, scallops were supposed to be in this dish. I didn't see any, but the dish definitely had the scallop-seafoody taste. 

Dessert: I got the chocolate mousse cake. Pretty darn decadent. I think this was the best part of the meal. But then again, I love anything chocolate. Give me chocolate and I'm easily satisfied. Boyfriend got the strawberry and white chocolate dolcini. This is way too sweet. Stay away.

My family and I, occasionally will crave Olive Garden or for the sake of just having Americanized Italian food. My parents are from the Philippines and Italian food is usually consumed by the wealthier citizens in the country. However, it's pretty much a middle class staple here in the States, LoL.

They have decent food and most times I do enjoy my order but this particular visit we had the privilege to be served by Luis, who was simply amazing. From the beginning to the end of our most recent visit was fantastic. Considering that it was a busy night and the staff seemed overwhelmed. He made sure we were ok and everything came out in a timely manner plus the food was hot and fresh which in most cases chain restaurants tend to forget. We will be back and will request Luis to be our server!

My ""create your own"" pasta wasn't the best. The noodles dried up like it had been left in the window for a while before it came out. And my sausage had to be brought out separately that I ordered on the pasta that was forgotten about. (Kitchen's fault, not our waitress) I'm not picky so I just asked for an extra side of sauce so I could just mix everything.

3972373,2018-03-29,9,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"I was given a gift card for Olive Garden--a restaurant chain that I have not been to for over 15 years at least.  I decided to use the gift card today and I went to this location near my home.

Service was the reason why this review is less than stellar and it started at the host podium.  A woman didn't acknowledge me but walked away to get her ear piece in.  When she came back, she said it would be a short wait as they were cleaning the table.  The place turned out to be 2/3 (at least) empty.  Soon, another host came over and she got menus and gave to a young man who took me to my table.

I was soon asked by my server if I wanted something to drink, iced tea perhaps.  That ordered, I looked over the menu and made my decision.  When my iced tea was brought, I ordered the chicken and gnocchi soup for a starter and the chicken Margherita--one of their ""Tastes of the Mediterranean"" dishes.

Within a short time, the server brought my soup and two breadsticks.  The soup was OK.  I wanted to avoid pasta because I've been spoiled by our independent restaurants that make their pastas in house but I didn't want minestrone.  The soup was OK.  

The chicken was quite good.  The menu describes it as ""Grilled chicken breasts topped with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, basil pesto and a lemon garlic sauce. Served with parmesan-crusted zucchini.""  The lemon garlic sauce was well executed.  There were two small pounded chicken breasts with cherry tomato halves.

Here's where part 2 of service became an issue.  I ordered the cannoli trio.  When the server brought the dessert, I moved my dirty main course dish to the side of the table.  The server dropped off the cannolis and left the dirty dish on the table.  As I was eating the dessert, the server dropped off my check and said, ""No hurry with this.""  Still the dirty plate remained.  Just as I had finished the cannoli, the server asked if I was paying with cash or card.  (What happened to no hurry?)  My gift card was already in the black book and I indicated that.  The server left and the dirty dish remained.  It was only after the server brought my slips back and explained the amount left on the gift card that the dirty plate was removed but only after two people at the next table had gone and as the server cleaned that table, my dirty dish was taken along with the other table's.  I had to ask for a refill of my iced tea.

As for the cannoli trio--supposedly imported from Italy--the shells had the softness of not being fresh.  The strawberry filling tasted very artificial.  The chocolate was OK but the classic cream was the best.

All in all, a very mixed experience.  How long does Olive Garden train their servers?  It's obvious that some need re-training or a refresher course at the minimum.

Since I have some credit left on the card, I'll choose a different location to clear the credit and then I'll avoid Olive Garden for another 15 years.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,15,7,2,LTxfVSpditUHgoG8hWMXyQ

4014576,2013-11-05,2,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"About as average as you can get for an Olive Garden.

Yes, even being a Yelper one cannot always go to that hole-in-the-wall or that fancy Michelin star restaurant.  Even we occasionally one has to wind up at that dreaded place for foodies...CHAINS.

Chains (ironic as that name is) are everywhere.  Sandwich chains, burger chains, ice cream chains, pizza chains, taco chains, you name it.  Well here we have your good ol' Italian chain...Olive Garden.  It's about as American (aka, un-Italian) as you can get.  Doesn't necessarily make it all bad, but it doesn't make it all good either.

I know, you Italians and your nonnas scoff at places like Olive Garden.  As well you authentic ITALY Italians should.  In your motherland, nonna wouldn't dare make pasta from a box, or take less than a fortnight to make a da sauce.  Mi scusi, but NO!  

Olive Garden is for those folks who THINK they are having authentic Italian eats.  In some cases, sure, but for the unknowing American masses...no.  But you gotta hand it to Olive Garden for giving it a try.  I guess I really can't say I've had real Italian food until I actually go to Italy.  So I can only dream of one day tasting some true stuff.  Or I must meet a nonna of my own that imports goodies from the heartland to cook a meal for me.

I'm an Asian guy, but damn do I love a good bowl of pasta.  Must be the Asian thing for noodles.  It's like, coursing through our blood.  Anything noodle or rice must be a part of the Asian staple diet.  When I get tired of the sometimes overly-sweet Filipino spaghetti (yes we do make it, try Jollibee), can't afford a bowl of that $25 stuff over at Scarpetta (Scott Conant send me a message and I will gladly come in for a free sample Ha Ha), and can't fathom Fazoli's (oy), I often end up at Olive Garden.  But, it ain't all that bad.

Whoever started this trend capitalized on making some BANK.  I have no reason why Olive Garden is almost always busy.  Is it the Italian deco?  The smell of bread baking?  The semi-hot hostesses?  I don't know.  But I can tell you this, just about every meal you order from Olive Garden comes with fresh breadsticks and their house salad.  That in itself can be very addicting for some folks.  I hate admitting it....but I love that damn salad.  I order on average three bowls of it every time.  It's those damn croutons and that damn dressing that do me in.  It's not even the greatest vinaigrette I've ever had, but the fact that it's so accessible ups its appeal.  Shoot, you can even buy Olive Garden branded croutons and their signature dressing at Sam's Club now!  Yes, I do have some of it at home.  Sellout, I know.  

The pasta at Olive Garden?  How do I say this...my experience with the menu is rather limited.  I've only ever gone to Olive Garden when the all-you-can-eat pasta promo starts up.  So sad!  But makes me so glad!  Where else you gonna get some decent carbs for less than $10 a person?  Plus unlimited breadsticks and salad?  Eh?  In a semi-fancy restaurant?  Consider date night with my wife sold.  I'm guilty.  Someday I may venture into ordering an entree at Olive Garden that is in the $20 range, but...probably not.

I don't have a problem with Olive Garden's chain pasta and sauce, as long as the pasta is cooked RIGHT.  It's gotta be al dente.  At least most times Olive Garden's chefs get this ok.  Good pasta and my go to of meat sauce, and I'm a happy man.  Breadstick for dipping?  Check.  Extra grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese in my bowl?  Check.  A meal like this sure beats the pasta and sauce I usually cook at home.  I suppose I should get at cooking a better Italian meal, and try to at least make someone's nonna proud.

And just who started this trend to give an Andes mint at the end of the meal?  Olive Garden, that's who.  Cheesy (umm...minty?) yes.  But for some reason my chain experience at Olive Garden isn't complete without that silly mint.

Overall I usually do OK at Olive Garden.  The food when made right is pretty exceptional, no way gourmet, but a step above the stuff that chef guy puts in a can.  Plus, at least it gets me out of a night of cooking.  Mangia!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,2,3,KLrY0vAh0I0Bj4EWTv7Cfw

So after of hours of spending some time and cash at those places, it's pretty nice to be able to end a shopping day with Olive Garden. 

Like I said, my fav dish is the Chicken Alfredo. The way they cook the chicken is pretty inconsistent but I like their Alfredo sauce. I've tried their other Alfredo dishes, seafood, but it tends to taste too-- fishy? Does that make sense? LOL I have no idea if it's the poor quality of the seafood that they buy but it just does not go well w/ their sauce. So as much as I love trying new things, I always play it safe w/ my chicken Alfredo.

4302309,2016-09-06,0,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"Soooooooo many things wrong with this location and the staff.

First of all, we came on a Sunday around noon.  Our server, Jordan, came over and got our drink orders.  He seemed nice.  Because I didn't want a heavy pasta dish at that time of day, I wanted to know how I could get an appetizer with maybe some salad on the side.

Now, back in the day, I remember going to OG and getting endless salad for a whole table, it just came with whatever else you ordered, like the breadsticks.

So I thought I could just get an app and share my boyfriend's salad/soup deal he was getting (the whole bowl comes to the table, all Jordan would've had to do was to bring me an extra salad plate).

But instead, he COULD NOT understand what I wanted to order.  I said ""Can I get this appetizer and then have some of his salad?""  He looked annoyed, frustrated, and confused.  It might have to do with him being foreign but I really don't think so.  I think all he cared about was how high he could get the check.  

See, the problem with ordering just a little bit at a restaurant is that a lot of servers will get pissed if they know that's what you're going to do.  Forget about the fact that I'll probably give you an EVEN BIGGER TIP if you just help me get what I want.

First he entered in my app order on the screen, then started taking the rest of the table's order with his pad.  When I tried to clarify that I was going to be having some of my boyfriend's salad he just looked at me with blank eyes and was like, ""Well you can order the endless soup/salad.""  COME ON, I just told you I wanted the appetizer and just some of the salad on the side!  Why would I have to order an additional $7+ to get my ""own"" salad that just comes out in a big bowl for the whole table anyway?!  That's a rip off!  

So I said, ok, cancel the app order and AGAIN with the perplexed, deer in headlights stare at me (really?!), and he tried to mumble something about he already put it in so.......... 

Ok.

But I still don't want it now because you aren't explaining/understanding/accommodating at all!  I told him instead of the app combo (which is more $$) I would just take a single app.  He walked away and we still weren't sure what we actually ordered and what we were going to get, and I see him over in the corner talking to a male manager.

So, we wait.  I get my app.  Then we get our giant salad bowl and soups.  Apparently I had ordered a SEPARATE $7+ soup/salad.... this is ridiculous.  And if this is the policy, it's a stupid policy and it should be changed.  Just bring the people who want a little bit of the salad but don't want a whole extra order (which doesn't mean extra salad comes, the same exact amount comes!) a side plate.  Your salad isn't that extravagant anyway what with the whole 3 olives you put in there, swimming in the excess croutons that help fill people up quicker.

So we eat our salad, our soup, I eat some of my app (it isn't that good, I haven't been here in awhile!) and we don't even order a second salad bowl.  My boyfriend orders another soup after finishing his - and this is where it really starts to get bad - and his second bowl of soup comes out.  Jordan has come to check on us about zero times by now.  I just see him frantically running around from place to place.  I think he can tell I'm not entirely happy with his service.

So then my boyfriend finds a BIG FAT HAIR in his soup.  Yep.  It's not even the color of either of our hair.  So, eventually, Jordan rushes by and I tell him that he found a hair in his soup and show it to him to see that it isn't either one of ours.  He stares at it with the same dopey expression he's had on the whole time and just mumbles something about a manager.  Then dashes away.  No, ""I'm sorry,"" or, ""I will get a manager right away,"" nothing you know, NORMAL that a server should say in that situation.

So more time goes by, he brings my boyfriend another soup but that's it.  Then five minutes later he brings us the check.  Are you for real?  It's the full check.  No manager.  

So I sit there with it and just wait.  I see Jordan peek around the corner (no joke! lol) to see if I've set the check up to be picked up and he quickly dashes away again.  MORE WAITING, and then he comes to the table and I say, ""Where's the manager?""  Here's the kicker.

HE ACTS LIKE HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!!!  LOL!!  I said, ""You said you were going to get the manager,"" and he looks disappointed and says, ""Oh, ok."" and runs off.

So some lady (who I'm assuming might be a supervisor?) comes to the table and very professionally tells us that Jordan sent her and she looks at the hair and says, ""I'll take care of this,"" and walks away.  We get the check back from her and she took off the soup and one other item to be nice.  To be fair, no she wasn't the manager, she was probably just saving Jordan's neck, but she was nice.  We pay quickly on the kiosk and leave before we have to see Jordan again.",C-O1hKW7_ZIA3kZbQg0WmQ,2,0,1,Mxw961Sb4vrdqidLMRiJwg

Atmosphere, you know the drill. ""Fancy"" interior for a chain restaurant, quaint music in the background, and decent lighting.

My girlfriend got a pork/ravioli dish, it was tasty, and I decided to be a cheapass and ordered the never ending pasta bowl with meat. Everything was pretty good, it did not taste bland or cheap like you imagine a special would taste. We also shared the sampler appetizer which had the chicken fingers/calamari, all equally delicious, especially their herb tarter sauce. The seasonal pumpkin cheesecake was FANTASTIC.

4645619,2013-02-09,0,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"I am not a huge fan of Olive Garden because the healthy choices seem rather limited, but it's a decent place to visit on a budget for a big group.

My last experience a few days ago was incredibly lackluster. The server was very nice and I appreciate nice people who are in the service industry. You'd think that would be a given, but it's definitely not always the case. She was a very nice server and knowledgeable about the menu but she did forget a few of our requests from the table more than once. Other than that, the 2 stars are in regard to the food.

Food: Really bad. I started with the Seafood Bordetta. I like to eat healthy and that was one of the few choices from the menu (which of course was the priciest). For a whopping $18,95 (pretty pricey for Olive Garden) I was willing to pay the high price for a healthy and tasty meal. The server told me that it was the better of my two options - the other being the Lasagna Pomodora. I was so disappointed. The scallops were rubbery, the shrimp was way too chewy, and the smell of fish was incredibly pungent. After I tried a few bites, I simply couldn't take it anymore. I LOATHE sending dishes back, but for $19, I couldn't throw it away. I asked to substitute the dish with my second choice, the Lasagna Pomodora. I should've gotten that dish in the first place because it was delicious. The portion was really small for a dinner course but delicious none the less. I like my portions smaller anyway because I don't like leftovers.

Overall, this is the 2nd time at this Olive Garden that I have been disappointed with the food. The wine is overpriced and the wait for the food is too long. The good points are the servers and the manager. I wouldn't return if I had the choice.",NYDvprxYyDm1dJj8g_G0RA,0,0,2,2oW3cR7z91XgIb7TJHlFjA

4702437,2014-03-25,1,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"During lunch, their famous Unlimited Soup, Salad, and Breadsticks is only $7.99. They've added a new promotion called Tuscan Trio Combination that invites you to add Salad Toppers (Antipasti Italian Meats and Cheeses or Roasted Tomato Caprese), Pasta Sides (Spaghetti with Meat Sauce, Fettuccine Alfredo, or Ziti with Five Cheese Marinara), or Tastes of Italy Small Plates (Chicken Meatballs, Tuscan White Bean Hummus, Crispy Risotto Bites, or Parmesan Roasted Asparagus). All selections are just $3.99. Even at $11.98, the lunch is a great value.

I've been to this location at least once or twice, but it's been at least four years since my last visit. I'm not a big fan of their restaurants, so I usually stay away. My mom has been talking about coming to fulfill her unlimited soup and salad craving, so we visited for lunch today. We both opted for unlimited salad and soup and a side of Spaghetti with Meat Sauce from the new Tuscan Trio promotion.

The salad is nothing grand; a mixture of (mostly) Iceburg and Romaine, red onion, tomato, whole black olives, peppercini, and seasoned croutons. They are extremely sparse on everything except Iceburg lettuce. There was literally two olives, two small slices of tomato, and six small rings/layers of onion in the first bowl of salad. For our second bowl, I requested no olives and extra tomatoes and thankfully, they were much more generous with the tomatoes and onions. I'm not crazy about their dressing, but it's manageable when we ask for it on the side.

We both chose the Zuppa Toscana for our soup because we've always enjoyed it. It's a creamy broth filled with spicy sausage, russet potatoes, and fresh kale and it's always delicious. As much as I don't care for Olive Garden, this soup is really great (especially with freshly shaved parmesan and black pepper). My only complaint is its consistency and sometimes lack of kale. We had a couple bowls and each bowl was different. Some had too much sausage, some had too many potatoes (making it starchier), and it always had too little kale (we love kale).

The Spaghetti with Meat Sauce was also nothing special. I don't have a preference for their sauce and overall flavor. The noodles were nicely cooked. Silly portion for four dollars. I would say skip the Tuscan Trio combination. Oh, and the breadsticks? Meh. Not worth the carbs or the calories.

Service was mostly great. After placing our orders, I realized that it may be advantageous to share a Spaghetti with Meat Sauce entrée rather than ordering two sides, so I decided to ask our server. All we asked was the size and price of the entrée portion and his response was bizarre. This was his side of the conversation: ""Oh, but if you order the spaghetti, then it costs more to add on the soup or salad ... I don't know, I guess It's about $10 ... No, I had someone else order the entrée and when they split it, they basically gave them two sides, so you're getting the better deal ... Oh, the one over there is our dinner portion .. It's like 13-14 dollars ... You'll get the salad with the entrée, but it'll cost you like $4 to add the soup ... But, you can do whatever you want ... I'm not being lazy, I just don't want my customers spending more money because we're already charging you enough."" UHH, WHAT? My mom was becoming annoyed, so she said, ""Nevermind,"" and dismissed him. We just wanted to know what our options were and every time we tried to ask a question, it was met with a rebuttal of why the Tuscan Trio Combination was better (without actually making that statement). I had to reiterate more than once that we each wanted to order the Unlimited Soup and Salad AND a Spaghetti entrée to share. My mom felt duped and I also felt that there must have been a reason that he was so adamant about keeping the Tuscan Trio order.

Anyway, I still enjoyed my meal, but my return is unlikely. It would have been a two-star rating had it not been for the yummy soup. I love my salads and this one is definitely not worthwhile. Also, this isn't the first time that I've had really strange service at an Olive Garden franchise.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,1,2,3,C_7NPB93DubiIeuKkFDhbg

We ordered a boat of Alfredo to go with our breadsticks (you must do this) but when we got the breadsticks, they weren't that fresh. We did go at 10pm on a Friday, but it was decently full when we walked in... I just thought they would have been better. Anyway, not a big deal.
We ordered the fresh salad which is my favorite and add extra peppers! 
After the salad and breadsticks were through, we ordered ANOTHER boat of Alfredo (I know, but it was our cheat meal) and extra breadsticks. These breadsticks were cooked to perfection. And I mean, like soft and salty and buttery and perfectly dipped with a white cream sauce.

I then ordered the steak Gorgonzola Alfredo... Omg how this dish hits the spot every time! It's been years since I've had it and it's still perfect.

I was offered some menus and had a very friendly experience with Shelly(?) the manager. I called Monday before the party to give my final head count and ask for high chairs to a gentleman manager (didn't get the name). I get there Sunday and the guy upfront doesn't seem to know what I was talking about. They tell us to take a seat. Then they seat us. Now I budgeted for this dinner with the special menu.  There was no high chairs at the table and I had to go find someone for them. Then I realize we have regular menus at our table. No kids menus and not even water. We finally get the right menus and the server was awesome but still waiting on a drink. We just came from church it's hot and now my little guy is not feeling well. I took the bottle water from my purse to give him a drink. I'm really disappointed that I called and tried to have this set up for a relaxing dinner and ended up with a headache!

The endless soups were delicious. I had two. I got the zuppa Tuscano and the chicken gnocchi. Both were cream based soups with good flavor. I really enjoyed my pasta. I love bolognese and this sauce was not bad. I just wish there was more of it. I thought it was too much pasta for the amount of sauce they gave. 

I ate my take home pasta the next day. I heated it up and it was tasty. Some people don't like eating leftovers when the sauce is already on the pasta. However I didnt think the sauce made the pasta mushy or soft.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,2,1,4,hMOD7s3Q_aVth9NKL5Q8XQ

Just move me, apologize and move on. My waiter was very mute, didnt ask if everything was okay, didnt introduce himself, horrible!!!

5086869,2016-01-06,7,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"Yeah yeah we all know Olive Garden is a chain restaurant, mediocre in the eyes of many. Mostly Americanized Italian fare but you know what, I've never had a bad experience here and in reality, several of their dishes tastes better than some of the places that claim they offer ""authentic"" Italian cuisine. It's cheaper and definitely blows Buca de beppo out of the water.

Their menu is extensive and they have a lot to offer from appetizers to desserts. For starters we always like to order their Sampler Italiano ($10.79) you pick 3 from a medley of apps. Calamari, stuffed mushrooms, mozzarella sticks are among our favorites. Then they offer you either soup or salad and of course their famous breadsticks. I always get the Zuppa Toscana, it's nothing special but it's not horrible either.

Not really a big fan of their pastas but I do like their chicken dishes. Among the ones I favor are the Garlic Rosemary chicken ($12.49) and most recently the Chicken Piccata ($16.99). It's very well balanced and all the flavors blend harmoniously. The main reason I like coming here though is their dessert, particularly Zeppoli (Italian donuts) $6.99 they are soooo addicting! I especially like to get it with both the raspberry and chocolate dipping sauces. Ugh so bad yet so good!

This is the closest one to us therefore our go to place when the mood strikes. Service is always pleasant, though sometimes untimely and the wait can be a bit of a hassle at times. Even though it's nothing fancy or even close to being authentic, this place always satiates. Overall, a favorable experience.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,11,8,4,WIZ2LwjiFQ3e8rnccZlgfw

5167197,2007-10-23,1,cPmThZ7Ugpd8eJnIObOy0Q,"It's Sunday night and I forget that it's family night for most folks in Las Vegas.  Joe and I had no choice but to go to Olive Garden for dinner last night.  I'm not complaining since the food is always quick and good.  This one is a little different to all the other Olive Garden's I've been to - the atmosphere is a little bit more posh and high class than the other restaurants.  When you walk in, like every Olive Gardens, there people who open the door for you and greet you hello and bid you goodbye.

You have a choice of being seated or going to the bar.  That's what we decide to do, have the bartender wait on us.  Besides, it's easier to just holler at him than wait for a server to come back to you.  It was a nice looking bar, granite, and comfortable high chairs.  It was just hard to  move the chairs out to sit on them and move them close to the bar.  Our bartender gave us decent service.  As soon as we sat down, he offered us something to drink.  I think he was disappointed that we just wanted water at first.  But, he delivered.  Our menus were placed in front of us gently after we had requested for them.  

After skimming through the appetizers, we decided to get the Bruschetta.  A traditional topping of roma tomatoes, fresh basil and extra-virgin olive oil. Served with toasted ciabatta bread - $6.35.  It was just okay for me.  I love tomatoes but this really didn't impress me all that much.  After a while, our bartender came over and asked us if we were ready for our alcoholic beverage.  I knew I wanted to drink some wine but didn't know what.  So, he was kind enough to give us some samples.  Samples = free = awesome!!!  So, I got curious about Principato, the red one.  We tried it, and it was pretty good.  Not too strong and simple in the taste buds.  But, for some reason I just wanted something more bold and rustic.  So we had a 2003 Super Tuscan Villa Antinori imported from Italy - $9.95 per glass.  That was so good.  It was really strong tho.  But, I couldn't put it down.  So, that's what we stuck with.  

Finally, we had ordered our entree's.  I decided to get the Braised Beef & Tortelloni - Tender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce $13.75.  This was just okay.  I should've gotten the Ravioli di Portobello - Portobello mushroom-filled ravioli in a creamy smoked cheese and sun-dried tomato sauce $11.95.  This is my most favorite through out the entire restaurant.  But, I wanted to venture out.  Joe decided to get the Steak Gorgonzola-Alfredo - Grilled beef medallions drizzled with balsamic glaze, served over fettuccine tossed with spinach and gorgonzola-alfredo sauce.  Steak prepared medium unless otherwise requestedm $15.50.  This is pretty good and filling.  We couldn't finish it so we boxed it and took it home.

Pros:  
*  Great service.
*  Awesome food.
*  free samplers on wine.
*  very clean.
*  servers and employees are always smiling.
*  high class feeling but laid back at the same time.
*  large portions.  Enough to bring home for lunch the next day.

Cons:
*  chairs are hard to maneuver.
*  wine glass is small.  I was expecting a bigger glass for red wine.

I'd go back to this one again.  I like the food a lot.  I would choose this Olive Garden over the one on E. Flamingo and North Las Vegas any day.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,2,2,4,nwHXtsalGKQMh5J22Q1I8A

Had to ask the server for a wet towel to clean it. He seemed put out. Just a quick wipe. Had to ask for the towel so that we could clean the table ourselves. The menu has gotten very limited.  After ordering, waited 10 minutes for salad and bread sticks. The pasta dishes had very little marinara sauce. We had to ask for more. Food was just ok. When we got the check, we were charged for the extra marinara sauce. $70 for 3 adults without alcohol or desert. Olive Garden has always just had ok food,  but this meal was not worth the price. Service is very poor. If you asked the server for drink refills he seemed as if we were bothing him. That won't be an issue as we won't be back.

What I did enjoy was the service. I had gotten off a later flight back into Vegas a few days back and really didn't have a taste for fast food. We got to the restaurant at 9:10pm and they close at 10:00pm. We were ushered in like the place just opened. Once we got seated, were were almost immediately greeted by our server, Cisco (don't know if I'm spelling this right, so sorry buddy). Cisco was full of energy, even though they were closing in less than an hour. The other thing I liked about Cisco was the fact that he was engaging with my kids. A lot of servers don't do that and it irritates me to no end. He even laughed at some of their cheesy jokes!! 
We skipped appetizers this go round and ordered our meals. I ordered the Chicken Scampi and Zuppa Tuscana. The soup was on point. We got our meals and I noticed that my Scampi was very dry. A quick mention to Cisco, and I had a large side of sauce. It was awesome. Let me also mention that Cisco must've filled our drinks five times in the hour we were there.

I too fell victim to the lure of the all you can eat soup and salad and bread sticks. We were leaving our Red Rock staycation, and we were in a hurry, so it seemed like the perfect plan. We sat at the bar because that seemed the speedy thing to do. I ordered, went to the restroom, and when I returned there was a saucer of marinara for dipping our bread sticks.

""That's cool,"" I proclaimed to my hub and started dipping. It wasn't too delicious, so I didn't dip that much. I then proceeded to eat sub par iceberg lettuce salad with a bland dressing and equally bland soup. The whole time I was thinking I could have just gone to Smith's and bought a bag of iceberg and a can of any soup on the shelf, saved money and had a more enjoyable lunch. 

Then, the bill arrived, and our shallow dish of wannabe Prego marinara was $4. I think an artery busted in my head I was so upset. We had been had. Apparently, while I was in the bathroom, our server had asked if we would like some marinara with our bread, and based on her delivery, my husband assumed it was complimentary. Wrong!

As we set down, the waiter was there immediately and barely let us take our jackets off as she was pressing us to order something.... we asked for an appetizer, but as we are trying to eat healthier, less then 2 min later we asked her to cancel the appetizer. her answer was - I already put it in. My husband said that since the place was so full, i doubt that the kitchen already started on it. so she went back and canceled it. 
Normally it seems that we have to wait to put our order in, but the waitress was next to our table barely letting us view the menu. It felt like we were extremely rushed to eat and get out as they had other people waiting in the lobby. Our salad and soup came in and less then 5 min later entrees arrived. We had no time to enjoy our salad.  
The highlight of the visit was when a waiter came to the table next to ours and put his behind almost on our table and into my husband's face. Then some big lady did the same.

Not more then that.
But. I have to compare Olive Garden to Cheese Cake Factory. CCF was better taste, better quality and cheaper.
 In almost same price  I had two cocktails and two appetizers in CCF. While in OG for 10$ less I he'd no cocktails and only one appetizer.
In both I've bought two slices of cakes and no doubt CCF is winning big time.  There is no reason why to go to OG when CCF is across the street. 
The service was good though in both.",Ez4P16pnEESSwjgzA9IWeA,0,0,3,EB5_EmsyQtt6yVOYQOafCw

My family and I went on a busy Friday night, and put our name on the waitlist. While we were waiting we went to the bar and although the bar was clearly packed, the bartender delivered fast, and friendly service by chatting with us and laughing at some jokes. 

I am very appreciate of the manager Shelly and the server Branden. They were very respectful and understanding of one of our party members severe nut allergy. It definitely eased his mind knowing that they were both sincere and thorough in making sure everything would be free of the allergy. Which is a huge deal because the list of restaurants to eat at just went from 2 to 3. :] 

Branden was a fun server and kept up on refills, was fun, and professional. Management, you have a great server on your hands and we will definitely ask for him when we come back! 

Thank you for making our experience an excellent one. :]",yhsWUWex0RtJvOwdRnZLuA,2,1,5,0Nj2-q58NNGQMLeQn5giUA

We arrived at lunch time and were quickly seated and our waitress arrived to take our drink order. She was very pleasant and friendly. We ordered and our soup, salad and bread sticks arrived swiftly. Our pasta arrived with perfect timing as our salad and soup were being taken away. 

The food was decent. Not the best Italian, obviously. But it'll do in a pinch and you always know what you're going to get. Service was top-notch and we never had to flag down a waiter or waitress to refill a drink or replace a fork. Everyone, including the people who brought out our food and the hostess were warm and friendly. Service is what gets chain restaurants higher marks in my book.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,5,4,skG8MZe_3axUfaPA0ctPIA
