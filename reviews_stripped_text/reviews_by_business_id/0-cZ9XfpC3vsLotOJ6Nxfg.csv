Don't know what's going on in the store, there are clothes for sales in a counter display, like jeans and odd old milk jugs on the table for sale.  There is karaoke equipment on tables as well, no real identity.
While I waited for the pizza the new owners were arguing over bills that were coming in.  My pizza must have been checked a dozen times before it was ready.
Finally it was served, nothing special, kinda bland, need to know your competition, Little Caesar's is 2 mins away and lunch deep dish with drink is $4 and delicious and airy and crunchy crust.",WstpcZuGllb1aeonbhQ3CQ,0,0,2,eK8TOn4dOj9_Ncb-Y7K6sw

Debra was very friendly and welcoming as she told me about the lunch special; a mini pizza with 1 topping and a drink for less than $7. The pizza was quite good, hot and freshly made. I will be back!",coh2RWKvuDuwSHZlm24y8A,0,0,4,Z6Qcx2xab7Pz7oDwG6dEgg
