But we've had several other dishes as well and thoroughly enjoyed everything.Usually they aren't too busy and can get you in quickly. Nicely decorated, and it's fun to sit on the patio next to the fountain and all the lights. Definitely a nicer restaurant and slighty more spendy price range",G8zXwB63B79H1pgHOh59Kg,0,0,4,tXS41AQyUPcvRLKBrlaABA

The food is top notch and is on par with the other big name restaurants of more luxurious casinos (without the pricing of a celebrity chef's kitchen).  The food our party received was both portioned and presented well. The only complaint we had about the food was that we wanted more sauce for some of the dishes. Another complaint about the food was there wasn't enough room for more dessert. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant itself was pleasant. We really enjoyed the music which was golden oldies. Service was also excellent and not overbearing. The styling was dated but was far better than the casino itself. Again, don't let this turn you away from such a hidden gem.",9PLHBScKy1ioBdrrwmCvBQ,0,0,4,9fn6zKTvHdc1Y6BE8_MMLw

The extra touches added to the dish were amazing. The chicken dish is exceptional. The chicken had a clean crispy outside and perfectly cooked. The dish has this gruyere french bread pudding that was so unexpected and unbelievably good! The dishes were off the charts and had all the touches and detail of a much higher end restaurant. The chef really knows how to put together some great work. Our server Christine was very friendly and knew the menu well. The wine selection is good  and reasonable. We cant wait to go back next week and explore the menu further!! Great patio as well.",U_Knj23UeFPr0nPRDfCM5Q,1,0,5,2-D54sTX01oSOEn57QWsrA
124310,2013-08-01,9,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"I'll keep this one short and sweet, as there isn't a whole lot to report. I've had a handful of people I don't know suggest I check out Embers in Summerlin, and despite my skepticism I finally made my way there to check it out. Amidst an embarrassing display of the worst of the worst Summerlin floozies I could possibly see, including a girl with a Pink fleece jacket and matching Pink fleece short shorts and several other seemingly miserable pairs of women drinking wine at 11am on a Saturday, I braved this scene to try their burger. I haven't really heard much buzz about this place around town ever, so I assumed what I would be getting matched the clientele around me.

Embers is located in Boca Park; the shopping area filled with horribly overpriced and awful clothing stores, typical chain restaurants and the most amazing liquor store ever. The interior is fit out with hard woods, simple light fixtures, and a number of seating options both near and away from the bar. They also have an outdoor patio where you can watch all of the local train wrecks walk by as they're shopping in ridiculous outfits and tans. They offer both a brunch and dinner menu, with the brunch menu being a little more breakfast oriented. They also have a large drink menu with some decent cocktails. We started with the bacon wrapped dates; they were decent but it was an extremely small order for $7.

Their classic 8oz burger comes with butter lettuce, tomato, red onion, French fries and the option to add cheese for $1. While it looked somewhat decent, it tasted like dry bun and onions. The meat had ok fresh flavor when sampled on its own, but with no seasoning it didn't stand out at all. It actually reminded us of the very first burger I had at Honey Salt before they revamped and made it the spectacular burger it is now. There is really nothing good I can say about this burger; the toppings were all fresh, and the meat did seem to be of good quality, but with a dry bun and zero flavors it's kind of the opposite of what you're looking for in a good burger. 

And to match, the fries were completely generic, frozen, and had almost no flavor either. They were seasoned with some pepper, but nothing to speak of whatsoever. The burger starts at $13, add cheese and you have a $14 burger that's flavorless and not worth it. With so many more viable options surrounding it between Honey Salt, Fleming's and even The Martini, I can't recommend you go to Embers to get a burger.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,7,5,2,zIgtz9WJKe3NCuuQ9Np6Pg

It's good value at full price for very good quality food. The hummus was creamy yumminess. The Corpse Reviver was a great cocktail. The steak salad was great. Steak perfectly cooked, salad perfectly dressed, blue cheese crostinis so moreish. The chef somehow manages to elevate healthy simplicity into divine deliciousness. Have the vanilla creme brûlée. The portion sizes were perfect as well, which is refreshing in a nation of wasteful overeating. It's a rare treat to be able to share a starter, have a satisfying main course, and share a dessert without feeling like we overindulged! I'm totally a fan of Embers. Quality over quantity ftw!

203227,2012-01-03,0,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"I had heard about the opening of this establishment while dining at one of my other local favorites and finally had the chance to check it out.  I'm SO glad that I did!

To begin with, I was surprised to see how empty it was on a Saturday night.  I mean, this is Boca Park at peak dinnertime!  My party of three and I made a reservation only to walk into a very subdued environment.  I was soon to realize that word simply hasn't gotten out yet about the amazing food served at Embers.

We started with the calamari.  Perfectly done with great dipping sauce--nice and spicy the way I like it but too spicy for one in our party.  Good, more for me!  

During our appetizers, I perused the cocktail menu and decided to order something that looked unique.  While I honestly don't recall what I ordered, I do remember that it was absolutely delicious.  

Next were soups and salads:  wedge salads for them and French onion soup for me.  They were clearly happy with the salads and I was amazed by the soup.  This was not one of the soups where there is just one small onion piece doused in tons of broth and lumpy cheese.  This was almost like a chili!!  Lots of good stuff in here.  I could have easily called it a night after this hearty soup but I had ordered the macadamia crusted mahi-mahi which was DElicious!  I took two bites and boxed the rest for home.  My friends ordered some steaks which they also gave the thumbs up.  (Of course, I took a bite and was also impressed.)

The only downside to Embers was the service.  I'm a very laid back person but I did notice that neither the hostess nor our server seemed to want to be there.  Maybe they were just new or ??  but even when maintaining the utmost of professionalism, nothing's wrong with a warm smile.

All in all, I had a nice time and I look forward to trying some of the more unique menu items like the guacamole brie melt with sun dried mozzarella.  Yummo!",PYJYzbhtvjG5OWEqHBmc9A,3,0,4,oI5r1CoLMawM9YyEHcWc9A

The service was great. Wasn't very busy for a Sunday brunch, but that just meant more attention could be paid to the patrons. 

Ordered the stuff dates as an appetizer. If presentation is everything, this clearly missed the mark. It looked like a giant blob, but the taste was great and the bacon crispy which was nice.  For my entrée, I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits. I'd highly recommend that although the potatoes were greasy.

How can any place do burgers (and Embers has many on menu) with only yellow mustard?  I was scandalized and disappointed.    No dijon? No deli mustard? Not even honey mustard?  I did love our server and enjoyed the sides. My burger was good-  reasonably priced. My tablemates loved their wine and meals.  But the mustard thing was a downer for me.    I hear they have a great weeknight happy hour and dinner is great. I'll go back - but I'd bring my own mustard.,il9YGi12gRza4IcfskDcRw,1,0,3,pv871XNdasroZUyUzbe06A
550285,2012-01-23,4,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"I got the sliders again tonight and something I forgot to add in my last review is that size wise they are very small. Plus, you only get two and they come with
Chips instead of fries. Overall, they're good for a bar snack but not a meal. My fiancé had the cajun chicken sandwich and it is much larger size wise and also comes with fries. She said it was good.

Service this time was terrible. We were seated quickly but our server decided focusing on her older clients would be a better use of her time. We had to ask for things multiple times and by the time they finally got here they weren't needed. For example, we ordered waters with our drinks and she didn't actually bring them until we asked again. Also, we asked for a side of sauce once the food arrived and we finished eating by the time it got there.

One other note, the bartender who didn't make my finances drink felt the need to sample it. She didn't drink from the glass but used a straw with her finger over one end to try it. She did this close enough and in plain site for us to hear her say, ""wow that's good.""",BRN_UPViHXJ3DtZGklmdqw,5,2,1,Z8-fWOmuviqxNlsuBTQTBQ

I've visited Embers twice. On the first it was for dinner at the behest of a friend who lives locally. My friend's request wasn't just for the food (which is excellent), but because of the drink selection. It's easy in the greater Las Veegas area to find a place that does cocktails; it's hard to find a place that does them right. My gauge for expertise? Can they do a Lion's Tail and a Blood in the Sand. The fact that Embers can sets them apart.

We ate early on Saturday evening, so the restaurant was quiet even though the bar area was lively.  We received friendly greetings upon entering, and our fabulous server Chrissy continued this tone throughout the meal.

The drinks were good, and wine pours were generous.  We split a Caesar to start, which was good.  Our steaks were tasty and cooked precisely as ordered.  My filet was completely tender.  They called the fries steak fries, but they were shoestrings and just a bit sparse.  The baked potato was huge.  Broccoli was great; asparagus was skinny variety but good.  The fact that entrees include 2 sides makes Embers slightly better cost wise than other good steakhouses in the area.

Proud to say that I have probably been to every establishment in Boca Park over the last 5 years, so I figured it was about time to follow tradition and venture into Embers. Immediately upon arrival it seemed like my kind of joint, like the vibe and the decor. My friend and I decided this might be a good place to catch the UNLV game, so we took a seat at the bar. After about half a beer we struck up a very good conversation with two females seated beside us who were also lawyers, it definitely some of the best conversation I've struck up in a good while, however it would not last. It seemed as though the bartender took exception talking to these girls as evidenced by him continually jumping into our conversation with snide remarks, and was even brazen enough to ask us to give up our seats as move because he had some ""players"" coming in. While we came in with the intention of watching a UNLV tournament game, we were quickly relocated to seats out of view of the TV. The humorous part was that these ""players"" that forced us to move were an older couple, and only one of them ended up playing. Furthermore she played a measly $5 on the table game. I would have easily offered to double her earnings just to not have had to give up our seats, view of the game, and new found friendship. Really a move that soured my experience at Embers in Boca Park.

Honestly, I enjoyed everything I tried here, and that's rare.  I usually hate SOMETHING.  But, nope, liked it all......

Including...

The bacon wrapped dates.  Now, these are trendy and they're Firefly's specialty, yadda yadda, but that doesn't mean Embers' version is without merit.  They're delicious with the pomegranate reduction.  Plus, Bacon and cheese is always a win, no matter what!  However,  I did freak out a little when I bit into the date, crunched the almond and thought it was a pit.  So, FYI, on that.

For the main course, the tri tip entree was fantastic and likely the best tri tip I've had.  Really. It was a hefty portion of a great cut of meat, cooked perfectly.  To top it off, it includes glazed sweet potatoes and sauteed spinach, my most favoritest of all favorite sides. 

But, the best thing of all was the Gruyere bread pudding.  Now, at first glance, this sounds disgusting.  But, hot damn.  I would eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It's that good.  Gruyere truly makes everything better.

Overall, a great spot.  I liked the mix of hipsters and cougars at the bar.  Makes things interesting.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,5,4,5,B-t3_T0keZ7nFkcFIYzmdw

Either the owner or manager, this guy never cracked a smile and was awkwardly way more casual than the staff.  Normally, I'm not bothered by these things, but this guy just seemed to be out of place/unconcerned/disconnected to the rest of the restaurant both times. 

With that being said, we came at night, and the walls to the front were pushed open to expose the outdoor patio.  The night was nice (not too windy/hot), so we sat outside.  Our waitress was pleasant and accommodating.  The menu seems to have changed some, so we ordered a tuna tartare appetizer (5 stars) and cocktails.  My husband had the salmon which he said was great (the portion could have been a little bigger), and I had the cioppino.  It was very good - lots of seafood, just the right size and delicious.  

For dessert, I was surprised that they mostly only have sorbets and things like that.  I went with a little chocolate lava cake - not bad, just nothing that I'm going to be running back to order again.  If I had any critique, it would be for them to have more variety in their dessert offerings.

Overall, it was a nice night.  It did take awhile for our food to come, and it wasn't that busy.  We didn't mind this and actually prefer it because we like to drink our cocktails and talk, but it probably would have annoyed others.",p6BTpaxCLOXhX2pFRd52GA,1,0,4,fJWZTkmaev5xRUOroUBdlQ

I was really impressed at the offer, and stunned at how quickly it came. Now, I've only been yelping a short time so I never expected a restaurant to reach out to such a newbie. But, she did. Obviously, she isn't messing around and takes serious pride in the food and overall experience at Ember's. 

I spoke with May earlier in the week and told her I'd come in at 10:30 this past Sunday. I did. I didn't much notice whether the place was packed because, honestly, I was a little uncomfortable walking in, knowing I'd given them 1 star, and here I was again. I don't know whether I was expecting to be told off or what, but it didn't happen. May was super nice to me when I walked in and quickly showed me to my table (which had a ""reserved"" sign on it...nice touch!) and said she would wait on me herself. 

I ordered coffee and the White Chocolate French Toast, which was the dish I was so underwhelmed by last time. I was tempted to order the Ricotta Pancakes but thought the best way to critique this time around was by ordering the same thing as last time. 

Let's get coffee out of the way. It's good. Strong. And my cup was never, not even for a moment, more than half empty. 

On to the French Toast. It was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Seriously. It was cooked just perfectly. The slices are HUGE. I could only eat half the portion. The granola accompanying the french toast was sweet and crunchy. And the berries were perfect. I don't know how they got the most perfectly ripe strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. The last few times I've been to the grocery store, the berry selection has been quite sad. I digress. The dish was perfect. 

I will definitely be back after this experience. And next time, I'm getting the Ricotta Pancakes. Thank you, May!",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,0,0,5,ZPtIrmMDgrBC0qVAj5H41Q

The best part of my meal was the Happy Hour Roasted Garlic Hummus, our waitress even brought us more pita to finish it off!
I ordered a Blackberry Pepino (Tequila, Honey, Jalapenos, Blackberry). It had slight spice but no balance of anything else, and pepino - that's cucumber - and it was no where to be found in the cocktail. As an appetizer, I ordered the Bellpepper Soup, when it came out I thought it was chili, not some deliciously light creamy pureed soup that I imagined in my head when I ordered it. The soup had ground beef with chucks off ill-cut bell peppers and onions, it also tasted like chili. For an entree, I ordered the Blackened Prime Flat-Iron Flank Steak (chili red potatoes, sauteed haricot verts, creole mustard Demiglace). I liked it very much however still not the best.

The prices were reasonable with large amounts of servings per entree. The atmosphere of the place very relaxing with indoor and outdoor seating. The sevice was wonderful. Christine our server was friendly and accomadating. 

For appetitzers, my favorite was the Chilean Sea Bass Skewers. It waas served with Bok Choy, Edamame, and chili mint sauce. The sauce was to die for, and reminded me of a homecooked chinese dish my family use to make. 

Christine also suggested a Ginger Mojito, and this drink was the perfect amounts of rock candy and lime juice. Not too sweet, and not too tart. 

The Mixed Green Salad also deserves a mention. Served with goat cheese and topped with watermelon, this salad is simlpe, but refeshing and light. 

My favorite entree included the 16 oz ribeye steak. The meat was so  tender, it melted in your mouth. A knife was not necessary to cut the steak, that's how tender this thing is. The Ribeye was full of flavor and the tempurature of the steak was cooked to perfection. 

For desserts, I really enjoyed the tart tangy taste of the Grapefruit Sorbert as well as the Smores gelato that reminded me of sitting around a campfire. The smores gelato was sprinkled with graham cracker crumbs and the crunch of the crackers blew me away coupled with  a lightly drizzled chocolate syrup and toasted marshmallows on top. 

Last but not least, was the bread and butter. I normally don't like bread and butter, but I loved the Honey Herbed Butter they served here. It's whipped butter, served at room tempurature. The butter was so fluffly and the hint of sweetness complimented the bread that was served. 

Overall,  I  give this place four stars. I'm a fan of this place, and will definitely be coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place to everyone. Everyone needs to try it!",DC9yjg6hluUKtBdmvVWiVg,3,1,4,_npwQUR2pRZSyOXg5m8gkg

Okay so it was my bfs birthday and since there wasn't a way I could secretly tell our waitress, I wrote it on our ticket when she gave us the check. She then comes  over and asks ""how old are you turning"" and then just said happy birthday. The reason why I found this really bizarre was because most places gives you free dessert or have the staff come sing happy birthday , even like apple bees or olive garden does. So considering that this place is suppose to be a nicer restaurant,  that was really disappointing, even my Bf was surprised. On any other day it would be fine but since it was a special occasion I think they could've acknowledged it a bit more.

Onto the . He had the 18oz tbone steak which was really good and juicy. He liked it a lot. I had the teriyaki salmon which was pretty good too.I probably would've liked it better if there was a side of the sauce to dip the salmon into. We both had Mac n cheese as a side.

Either offer it or don't, but hiding it only has bad intentions. That being said, I'd rather drink here than eat here.

House sangria and several other wine/drink options are available for $3 during HH: 4-7PM, every day. The sangria is tasty- not too strong or too fruity but just right, an alcoholic Goldilocks would happily down three of them for under $10. 

We only tried a couple of dishes- select appetizers are half off for HH. The hummus plate and crispy beef soft (oxymoron?) tacos sounded tasty but we chose the tri tip sliders and the mushroom flatbread. TRI TIP SLIDERS (regular price $11) came in a pair with a heap of unseasoned shoestring fries, they were overflowing with meat topped with an especially vinegary barbecue sauce. If you're going to serve tri tip, let it shine instead of covering it with sauce as if it's pulled pork. MUSHROOM FLATBREAD was just okay, not some thing I'd pay full price for ($11)- it's hard to go wrong with mushrooms and cheese but the bread itself was really dry and floury. It was nicely crisp, but only the middle had any toppings.

Service was not really present- in addition to having to ask for the HH menu to begin with, the hostess never brought it and once we asked for it our server was rarely seen.

My dinner partner and I walked in to see modern decor in dark colors, punctuated by light, fanciful water-lily light fixtures over a few booths. The bar was busy and highly inviting, but we decided on a quiet booth.

We started out with a pair of crostini appetizers.  The Wild Mushroom and the Caprese.  While the Wild Mushroom Crostini was mild on flavor, the Caprese Crostini was an explosion of fresh flavors in our mouths. One bite of the heirloom tomato relished to perfection combined with the crispness of the crostini made me go ""WOW!"" feeling like I had committed a sin for enjoying it so much,

After the decadent appetizers, out came my Prosciutto and Fresh Pea Risotto and my partner's Miso Salmon with Edamame.  While I'm not a big fish eater, my dinner partner relayed that the salmon was cooked to perfection, as he finished off the whole plate without complaint.  My risotto was wonderful, again loaded with decadent flavors and textures - definitely something I'd order again and again.

Our server, May, was totally awesome.  She had wonderful knowledge of the menu and guided us through our first time savoring Embers.  

So, my advice, if you've got deep pockets, definitely go so you can enjoy the menu.  Not the place to go if you're on a budget.",cqHqdupbqm7YPPK9Odnm7Q,2,1,4,RD6bMCFxHVvy4gtZDXftPg

I had the warm spinach salad for my entree, which was also good. My husband had the ribeye, which he enjoyed. I stole a couple of the polenta fries that came with his steak and they were yummy! Not greasy and the batter was just right.

2279608,2014-06-16,0,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"We recently visited Embers on a Friday evening, around 7 pm. Unlike other Boca Park restaurants, there was no wait, and lots of empty tables. The server informed us upfront that the kitchen was very backed up, and if we were super hungry we should go somewhere else. I appreciated her warning, but we weren't starving so we went ahead and took a table on the patio.

Our server was very nice, our water glasses never sat empty, and the wait for food was not too bad.

We started with some bacon wrapped dates, I had read on yelp that they were better than Fire Fly's bacon wrapped dates....either we just received the exception, or that other reviewer was smoking crack because these weren't even on the same playing field as Fire Fly. The bacon was soggy, the pomegranate reduction lacked flavor, and I was completely unimpressed. 

Next small plate comes out: tri tip sliders and fries. My slider had large chunks of orange fat, I'm guessing from where it had been pre-sliced and chilled. The barbecue sauce was inedible. I took one bite of the meat and left if on my plate. It tasted like the ""steak-ums"" we ate in college. The fries were nothing special at all, comparable to Wendy's fries. They remained mostly untouched also. A different server took my plate and I told him I couldn't eat the sandwich because something really tasted ""off"" but he didn't respond. 

My cocktail arrived - it had muddled blackberries and jalapeños, it was just okay, looked pretty though! 

Our salads came out next- we both ordered the pear and walnut salad, and I was very happy with mine. The dressing was good, the ingredient ratio was nice - it was the high point of the meal. 

Last to come out were our chicken skewers served on a greasy piece of naan or pita bread that was too soggy for me to eat, and some sweet chili sauce that was obviously from a bottle. 

I would not return to Embers. The staff was polite, and the patio was nice, but the food was mediocre at best.",45mRoEbA_IvHIyUHpiABBw,2,0,3,ES0c4S75VfJcjhOsc2LO5A

I highly recommend their Moscow Mule for all of you vodka aficionados out there - Vodka, lime and Fever Tree Ginger Beer which made for bright, tart flavors - perfect libation for warmer weather!   

We eschew red meat - and Embers has a nice set of appetizers for the less carnivorous.  Deep fried artichoke hearts were really well done crispy on the exterior while remaining soft and luscious on the inside.  Their Ahi tuna on mini-rice cakes with masago and micro greens is very well done as well!  We sampled their Caprese Salad which was nice - but easily, for me anyway, one of my favorite dishes we tried was the Seared Diver Scallop with Roasted Cauliflower, Cauliflower Puree and Wilted Frisee.  The scallop was perfectly seared on the outside and wonderfully nearly-rare.  The roasted cauliflower added additional textural interest and was a creative touch. 

Service was very swift and attentive throughout, even with the restaurant packed with people. Music choices were amusing (and surprising) to us old rock and rollers - we heard ""No Fun"" by the Stooges, ""Sweet Jane"" by the Velvets and ""Sha-La-La-La-Lee"" by The Small Faces while we were there!

I made the comment ""I wonder why some places don't carry a beer as popular as Blue moon?', his response was 'because its not a very good beer, we do things differently here'. He said thats why we don't carry Bud Light, to which I replied 'now thats not a very good beer"". His response was 'well, thats who makes Blue Moon and neither ones are good beers'.

I've been wanting to try this place since it opened, and since the bar at GB was full on Saturday night, we decided to give it a try.  The atmosphere is great. It is very upscale and swanky (minus the annoying video poker - which I understand is inevitable in Vegas.) 

The only reason I'm not giving this place a higher rating is because it was surprisingly expensive (mainly for wine) $9 for a glass of house cab is a little extreme. (Especially when they have a 1/2 carafe next door at Grimaldi's for $9.) Don't get me wrong, I know wine fairly well and am willing to pay a relatively high price for good wine. However, sometimes I just want some decent, reasonably priced wine on a Saturday night! My boyfriend's 12 oz beer was $5.50 which is slightly more reasonable. We got the chicken tenders as an appetizer and they were quite tasty. 

Overall I really liked this place, but  I wish the drinks were a little more affordable. $50+ for 4 drinks and an app is rather steep. We will be back, but only for happy hour (which is strangely only Mon-Thurs.)",tQBeDnrViwX_UfDwdL1Jyg,6,3,3,32h4l7kCBvvR5luSSAD6Tw
2468731,2012-09-17,2,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"Embers has really hit its stride!  I was a big fan from the beginning because the drinks are 2nd-to-none and I did enough homework to order great food.  They have had a new chef for a few months now and their menu has truly caught up to the cocktails at this point!

The Drinks:  This is my favorite spot in town for balanced drinks and classic cocktails!  My personal favorites are Howard's Old Fashioned, Not So Rusty Nail, Lion's Tail, The Sunny, Honey Side Car, Aviation, and Blood and Sand.  You can get all the normal cocktails that you find anywhere, but I strongly encourage expanding your horizon's while at Embers.  I will often bring people in that just tell Howard what they normally drink and ask him to make them something new...they are repeatedly pleased!  Embers has a great selection of Craft Beers, and does wonderful with the limited amount of taps...you can tell that a beer snob set the draft list, not a restaurateur.  Their wine selection is solid as well, with several boutique bottles that you won't find every place else you go.

Happy Hour: Everyday from 4 - 7 and from 10 - close
Several drinks are on Happy Hour, plus bunch of great appetizers.  I really like the crispy steak tacos, and the humus.  The tri-tip sliders are great...but then so are the regular sliders.  Happy Hour is in the bar AND on their delightful patio!

The Food:  My favorites include the Sea Bass, the Roasted Chicken, and the Heirloom Tomato & Fresh Mozzarella salad.  I don't love the fact that the name says: Steaks, Ribs, & Spirits.  The spirits I think are great, but the steaks and ribs are just good.  I know people that like them...and come here for them, but I would not come here specifically for those two items.  I would however absolutely order one if that is what I was in the mood for because the drinks are so good that I'd be here anyway :)

The Service:  The staff here is great!  Always friendly.  They tend to get a little busy when a big game brings in additional clientele, but this has never been much of a problem to me.

Brand New:  They just started serving brunch on the weekends at 10am.  

BRUNCH!!!  Embers new Brunch Menu is so good!  They literally have my favorite hollandaise sauce for Eggs Benedict that I have ever had...and Eggs Benedict is my go-to breakfast and brunch item.  The classic Eggs Benedict is great, but if you like smoked salmon their Smoked Salmon Benedict is insanely good...a hint of capers comes through with a lite truffle oil that plays so nice with the smoked flavors...I love it when food plays nice together.

Come here with friends so that you can try multiple Brunch Items...other savory dishes that I liked include the Fried Chicken and Biscuits Sliders and the Chorizo and Piquillo Pepper Omelet.   I also want to try the Smoked Bacon/Ham Croissant sliders because they look great in front of the stranger next to me...I'm thinking I should have asked for a bite anyway.

I lean towards savory breakfast/brunch items.  I tried a few sweet items that were wonderful however...Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes!  I could eat these without a problem.  Additionally, the White Chocolate Cinnamon French Toast is outstanding, but I could not eat a whole serving...too sweet for this savory guy.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,9,6,5,D9hkX6MU8njUd7qqShexmQ

2641295,2014-05-21,3,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"I was craving a sandwich but at 10pm most places are closed. They don't have any Embers out in Southern California where we are from, plus they have great reviews, and they are open late, so we decided to order take out from them.

I couldn't honestly say I enjoyed my meal here. It was beyond overpriced by any normal standards for what we got. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem spending extra cash if it means I'm getting quality and flavor, that's not the case here.

$15 for a grilled chicken breast sandwich which advertised mozzarella cheese and pesto aioli on a roasted garlic focaccia bread, spinach, and roasted red peppers. There was a paper thin piece of melted mozzarella - seriously, there wasn't any. Pesto aioli? More like a dot of pesto oil! The sandwich and chicken was extremely dry and flavorless. Only when I actually had a bite of roasted bell pepper, was it an average sandwich. I felt really let down and robbed. 

$11 for a mushroom and spinach flatbread. I felt that they really skimped on the toppings since most of my bites were just dry bread pieces. I barely got any bites with truffle oil and once I did get a mushroom and spinach bite in, it was only ok... It wasn't amazing. There wasn't any body or layer of flavor, just salt. 

$30 for a meal that I could of gotten at a typical chain like Cheesecake Factory and had a better flavorful experience. 

I don't know who decided to slack that day, but it caused a first time customer reconsider ever coming back again.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,7,3,2,UulFwt_rAYAaW8XwyCLE_A
2653479,2013-08-25,0,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"We ate here on a whim to try something new after a successful wine haul at Total Wine next door.  We were greeted by the bartender / manager who let us know they were currently participating in Restaurant Week ($50).  Not wanting to drop $150 for lunch / early dinner, we asked if there was a Happy Hour.  There was and it just happen to start (4pm).  We were sat outside and ordered a glass of their House Pinot (eh - nothing special) and a Tall Tenaya Creek Tandem Double IPA.  Got to support the local brewers and I was glad i did as this was a delicious IPA.  
I asked the bartender / manager what the four best items were on the App side (as we find the Apps are what make people come back from time to time) and we ordered the Grilled Filet and Mushroom Skewers, Seared Blackened Tuna, Crispy Beef Tacos (BEST) and the BBQ Tri Tip Sliders.
The Grilled Filet and Mushroom Skewers were fantastic for my 3 year old as they were very tender and cooked perfectly mid-rare, however the flavor was bland.  The BBQ Tri Tip Sliders were very filling however there was a heavy ""tex-mex"" taste which was hard to get over.  It wasn't a bad taste, just not what I was looking for.  I would order them with a Heff.
The Blackened Tuna needed a little bit of acid added, so once my wife splashed some Lime on them, the flavors really popped.  Overall, the best tasting item (although it photographs poorly) is the CRISPY BEEF TACOS.  I would order these EVERY time i return and i plan to.  The dish has three tacos and although it looks to be hard to eat, is extremely tender and flavorful.  THIS DISH IS A MUST TRY!
As a pleasant surprise, the waitress brought us the Bacon Wrapped Dates that she let us know the bartender / manager ordered on the house.  They were very enjoyable until we received the bill and noticed they were included.  My wife and I feel that this was an honest mistake and at $5, we didn't think we needed to bring it to the waitresses attention as we were in a rush to leave (2 children ready to go after their 20 minute threshold).
Overall, we would return and plan to as there are some specialty cocktails we would like to try on our next visit.",NppW9SFDMKioUAx_87QQhw,1,0,4,Ovu35BB5hP1u0oyPH-Aa4A
2759615,2013-09-28,6,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"Was my first time here for a UUYE dinner that Stephanie ""Fluffy Bear"" K kind of put together at the last minute. 

On this night it was a nice 76 degree evening with a slight cool breeze. Where we sat was just right inside next to the patio. The doors to the patio were wide open which was letting some of the cool breeze in. I was impressed by this set up so my first thoughts of this place was pretty good so far.

As we looked over the menu, one main thing stood out to me. THE PRICES. Since me and my wifey were going to our favorite late night happy hour restaurant later, we decided to share an appetizer, a salad, and a main course. Im glad we did because if we actually ordered our own meal, it would have pushed the bill to 100 easily.

So for the appetizer,we went with the Spicy Ahi Rolls. Price: $15. As the server brought it out, it looked pretty good. The problem I thought was that their were only FOUR pieces. Now I have been to some places where we have had ahi rolls before and I know they are kind of pricey but this was ridiculous! You would think for that price we could get a whole roll like maybe eight pieces instead of four. 

For the salad I ordered Caesar with the dressing on the side. Price: $10. For that price, I was thinking maybe they did something different to it to make it that expensive. Maybe have a guy dressed up as Julius Caesar come out with an entourage to present this magnificent salad. But, no. It was just your basic romaine lettuce, parmesan cheese, and croutons. As a side note, their cheapest salad was a spring mix, which was $8.

Lastly, for the main course, we got the Slow Roasted Tri Tip. Price: $20. Now this was actually decent. I still don't think 20 for tri tip justifies it though. Came with mashed yams and spinach. 

Overall, the food quality was below average, especially for the price. The total came out to 54 dollars and some change. That's with a 20 percent tip included. I have been to a lot of other places where you can have soup, salad, and a main course for under 20 dollars. Don't get me wrong. I am not a cheapskate, but I'll be damned if I pay that much for a meal  that I cant really rave about. 

In closing, the atmosphere and service is pretty good here, but the food is not worth the ridiculous prices they charge you. Originally I was gonna give two stars, but since I was with good company, that probably distracted my disappointment long enough to give you guys that extra star.

Speaking of good company, shout outs to my good friends Kevin L, Ollan A and his wifey Kristina, C D and his gf Evelyn Y, including C D jr.

2943102,2014-03-12,0,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"Had an amazing meal here. I started out with the crispy beef tacos which were surprisingly large for an appetizer and also excellent. The beef was nice and crispy (I'm guessing fried in a wok) and the sauce and pickled veggies gave it tons of flavor. The spinach salad was pretty typical, good, but nothing to write about.

For my entree I had the pan roasted herb chicken and it was above and beyond what I expected. I don't usually order chicken because it can be boring and usually dried out. I ordered this one though because I was intrigued by the gruyere bread pudding with cranberry relish. The pudding was the perfect consistency, very soft and cheesy but firm enough to not be too dough/mushy. The relish added a nice sweet/tart contrast. The brussels sprouts were great (can't go wrong with those). The chicken was pretty close to perfect. The skin was crispy and covered with a peppery dry rub and the meat was very juicy and tender. Pretty much as good as chicken can be cooked. 

Since this place is a cocktail bar I had the Blackberry Pepino. It had tequila, honey, jalapeños, and blackberry juice in it. They used a very peppery tequila which balanced out well with the sweetness of the blackberries and honey and the jalapeños weren't overpowering. A very well balanced drink. One of the better cocktails I've had in a while. If I wasn't so full I would have tried a dessert but it wasn't going to happen.

During this visit I tried 3 appetizers: the spicy ahi tuna, the hummus and the chicken skewers.  Everything was solid; the ahi tuna sitting on top of crispy rice was my favorite of the three.

Embers is located in Boca Park and the atmosphere is fabulous!  The patio is huge and the decor is sleek.  We were definitely under-dressed but our visit was very impromptu.  We happened to be hungry at 5pm on a Tuesday afternoon.

However, regardless of how you're dressed, you should always greet customers with a smile.  When we walked in we were coldly greeted by a young lady.  I told her we wanted to enjoy their happy hour menu, and she looked at us like ""well I'll be lucky to get $5 in tip from these chumps.""  She sat us in the empty patio and also happened to double as our server!!  LOL

We ordered 5 of their happy hour dishes, which is basically $2 off their starter menu.    I also enjoyed a couple glasses of the $4 Stella drafts.

Two really tasty little burgers with a delicious & generous serving of fries sprinkled in kosher salt and black pepper.  I would return for this.

Chilean Sea Bass Skewers $14 on HH

The last dish i had was a NY Steak which was also perfect.  Both my steaks came with two sides which is great for the price. Their sweet potatoes are fantastic, baked potato is great, and the creamed corn is also good.  Not to mention the great staff that kept my drink filled and was always by my side without getting annoying.  The owner also walked around and talked to us which is quite warming. Most owners could care less about their customers so i thought that was great.

Moscow mule, amazing. Get it. Drink it. Love it.
We sampled almost everything from the menu. We ordered most of the appetizers. The standouts were Goat cheese and fig crostini. Those little guys were so good. Thankfully they were $4, at full price I would have felt shortchanged.
The linginue with scallops and shrimp and salmon was DA BOMB! So gooooood. Pasta perfectly al dente. Wowser!
I really enjoyed my food and drinks and will come back for HH. Not sure yet if I'd come back for full price items.

3517480,2013-04-23,1,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"I've been here a couple times. First time was for Restaurant Week, where dinner was a bargain at $40.13 for four courses. The apps were probably the highlight of the meal. The beef in the crispy beef tacos was a great mix of a tender, juicy interior and crispy  exterior with a wonderful flavor all around. The stuffed dates are similar to what you'll find elsewhere, but the tried and true ingredients always make for a delicious dish.

The salads were more than respectable with my wife and I trying the mixed greens salad and the warm spinach salad. The risotto, one of the entrees, was rich and (almost too) creamy with plenty of mushrooms. The tri tip was a touch too sweet and tough for my tastes, but the various preparations of sweet potatoes on the plate were all winners. The bread pudding to end the meal was a hit. It's tough to go wrong with a spongey mound of warm and cold deliciousness.

If you follow Embers on Twitter you'll see different discounts throughout the week for happy hour or brunch. On my second visit we got a few apps that were a couple bucks off during happy hour. The best of the bunch were the sliders -- nicely toasted bun and beef patties that weren't too firm and plenty moist. The filet skewers were pretty good as well and the best part of that dish was the crispy polenta fries -- absolutely amazing! The crispy tuna and seabass skewers weren't bad but the quality of the seafood was less than stellar.

Still, I'm a fan of the place. It's a local spot with a nice patio, friendly staff, and several dishes that make a return visit worthwhile.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,2,4,Y44V3F5_J5zCOX9dKhFBLw
3563781,2012-02-15,5,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"Saw that a new steak place opened near our house and was sooo excited to try it out.  First and last time there...I predict it will be closed within the year unless it just happens to get overflow from the other restaurants nearby.  Food was nothing spectacular, but not horrible either, problem was that between the server and the bussers we felt like we had to be constantly eating our holding our fork like we were going to take a bite, and that finally was not even enough.  THEY KEPT TRYING TO TAKE OUR PLATES AWAY!!  We came in on a Friday, later, and not busy so not sure why they heck they kept trying to get us out of there.  Every time we tried to take a breath and have a conversation someone new came over and tried to take our plates even though they were full of food.  I finally gave up and let them take my plate but my husband had JUST put a bite of steak in his mouth and had more on the plate and the server again came over and asked to take his plate...his mouth was full so he too just gave up and let her take it.  After his mouth was empty he went off on her a little and complained about the employees constantly trying to take our food away.  We never saw her again.  Some guy, I assume a manager, brought our check over, dropped in on the table, didn't meet our eyes, or say anything.  Came back over picked up the credit card then brought it back...no one ever came over to find out how things were or apologize...nothing, it was so weird and rude we will never go back.  Good luck staying open if this is how you treat your guests, there are way too many great restaurants in Las Vegas with amazing service to go back to a place like this.  We also had to send our dirty martini's back because we asked for light on the dirty and they were so strong and salty we couldn't drink them.",UuGIFBDZmwYLxQQMxHp6Yg,5,2,1,gMVfexZCY7bwf0XjGnuc9A

My boyfriend and I started with the filet and mushroom skewers and bacon wrapped dates -- love these!  They are as good if not better then Firefly's.  For dinner we split the grilled rib-eye, and unlike most steakhouses it comes with sides included.  More then enough for two people and cooked perfectly.  At $36 for the 16 ounce rib-eye I thought that was a very fair price.  I am also a huge fan of their drink menu.  I usually stick to the red sangria but this night I had the Dirty Girl martini, pear based, and the Cacao Confusion, one of the best chocolate martinis I've ever had.

I spent a nice long stretch of time visiting my BFF in Las Vegas.  Lucky for me, she happens to live near Boca Park so we frequented Embers during my two week stay and I had a chance to try a lot of menu items.  I honestly liked everything I ate here.  Best hummus ever!!!  And then rigatoni was amazing as well!  Tried the truffle fries - um, who doesn't LOVE truffle on fries?! Flat iron steak or Filet... can't go wrong.  And then while sitting at the bar, one of the regulars recommended that I eat a ""cheese ball.""  Huh?  Lucky for me, the manager/bartender knew exactly what he was referring to and ordered me the Gruyere Bread Pudding.  Seriously... soooooo good!  Told you I tried almost everything on the menu!!  And then the bar... the drinks... holy batman, I have never drank so much in my life.  You can basically order any drink you want.  I would tell Howard the manager/bartender what type of flavor I liked or didn't like, he would mix something up, and it was outstanding!  And speaking of the people of Embers... such a great place.  Everyone makes you feel welcome.  It's like Las Vegas' version of Cheers where everyone knows your name after just a few visits!  And my last observation, I think this is the perfect restaurant for a date night!  Great lighting (ladies you know what I'm talking about), intimate and cozy, casual yet not too casual, and so many options on the menu!

First of all, can I get a, ""Hallelujah!"" for a place that serves up a nice classic cocktail on the Westside!!  As much as I love going downtown and to the Strip to get my fancy drink on, sometimes I wish those places were closer to home.  Embers has a top notch drink menu and is a hop, skip, and jump away from my house!  Excited!

Second, I like the people who work here.  Howard the bartender is super eager to please and tell you about his drinks.  The owner (Tony I think was his name?) was really friendly and talkative as we sat at the bar.  Our waitress was super cute and made me laugh.  Excited!!

Third, the menu is heavy on tri tip, which my Santa Maria born husband was stoked about.  He loves him some tri tip.  Excited!!!

The thing holding me back...the quality of the food.  I've had the BBQ tri tip sandwich and fries, French Onion soup, cobb salad, and chicken tenders here so far.  Everything has so much potential, but falls just short and is underwhelming.  I don't know what it is, but the food needs a little kick in the pants.

Tried again a little earlier on the next Saturday and successfully set a reservation for 2pm. Got there a few minutes after, and to my surprise, the place was nearly empty considering the full list the weekend before. Our server was nice & cheerful. I ordered the bacon croissant sliders & my hunny ordered the green & white omelet, both of which came with breakfast potatoes. The food took a pretty long while to come out for the place to be so un-busy, but it was all delicious. Music selection was a cool eclectic mix...maybe a good Pandora channel?

3907719,2012-02-11,7,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"First, the with positives.  Service was fine.  Server was pleasant, attentive and offered to resolve the issues associated with the food.  Creamed Corn was good with fresh corn and good blend of peppers and spice.  It was a tad cornstarchy though.  Place was pretty full for reasons I will never understand.

Then, came the food.  I root for restaurants.  I really do.  Especially when someone opens a new restaurant close to my house, I especially want it to be good.  When we heard that Chef Bret from Becker's was behind the stoves, we were especially optimistic having been to Becker's dozens of times as a Westside alternative to DelFrisco's, N9ne, Ruth's Chris, or Prime.  So we tried Embers a couple weeks after they opened and ordered a myriad of menu selections only to have various combinations of Sysco lettuce and vegetables show up with stale bread and temperatures all over the board.  

We chalked it up to opening jitters.  Tonight, we elected to go back because we heard that they had revamped the menu and the food.  Oh my god.  We ordered the Eggplant and fresh mozzerella melt ($8.00)  for an appetizer.  It arrived promptly and was a crusty dry tasteless piece of toast with an ultra-thin tasteless sliver of what appeared to be eggplant under a half-dollar piece of lukewarm cheap mozzerella.  It was served on a bed of Sysco generic mixed greens with generic diced tomatoes.  It was drizzled with a balsamic vinegar reduction which was barely noticable but it was the highlight of the awful awful tasteless dish.

The Mrs. ordered the chicken cobb salad ($12.00) and I ordered the 12 oz., New York. ($32.00)    The chicken cobb was a serving plate of iceberg lettuce that looked like they just dumped a bag of iceberg lettuce from Von's onto a plate complete with some of the core.  The chicken on it was moist but it was unable to save the salad.

Then came the 12 oz. New York.  I have eaten probably 50 steaks at restaurants in the past year, some of which at restaurants I would never bring a date.  Some of them at bars and truck-stoppy places where you have no business ordering a steak.    This was the worst steak I have had in several years.  It was ordered medium rare.  It came as a grey slab of meat with a couple of criss-cross marks in it which looked like they were colored on it.  

I gave it a try to see perhaps if the taste was better than the microwave looking grey slab of putrid looking garbage that was staring at me from the plate.  It was as gross as it looked.  I thought it had to be a mistake, because I could not imagine that Applebee's or Chili's or Outback puts out anything quite as awful as this mess.

I asked the server whether all the steaks look like this, and whether they are cooked like this.  She replied that she would be happy to take it to the back and char it more for me.  I passed as that would just mean that they would cook it way past medium rare as I ordered it and they would end up giving me a medium well steak which would be as bad as the thing on the plate.  I tried to stomach a couple of bites, and the steak, rather than a meaty salty piece of steak, tasted like lemon.  I don't get it.

Then some sort of manager type guy came up and stated that the steak was cooked over redwood in a broiler of something.  He further stated that told the chef that they were, from now on, going to char their steaks more.  Thanks.  That made me feel a lot better that I, after 9 months of being open, told them that they were cooking steaks that looked like they were microwaved.  

They charged me for everything even though we only ate 1/2 of the eggplant garbage and half the ""steak"".  I'm not looking for a free dinner.  

In fact, if I was given a $1000.00 gift certificate to Embers, I would sell it for $200.00 and take the cash to any other restaurant in Boca Park area including, Flemming's, Roy's, Cheesecake Factory, Kona Grill, Applebees, Three Angry Wives, or Roberto's at Fabulous Freddy's Car Wash across the street.",usHZH81IJdJbi1NaAfWBQQ,7,3,1,6vY8hjOCHir9mzDiLnwtvA

Brio's kitchen was closed.  Was recommended to check out Petra or Bottles & Burgers.

Petra and Bottle's & Burgers were closed.

Drove across the street to Kona.  It was closed.

Walked to Gordon Biersch (now I'm slumming it).  It was closed.

Gave Ember's a shot, and amazingly they were open even though they weren't supposed to be (fantasy draft?). 

Looked over the happy hour menu, and the Crispy Beef Tacos and Goat Cheese Crostinis sounded good.  Asked the bartender if he had any recommendations from the menu, and he named exactly those two.  WIN!

Got a Hoegarden comped for playing some video poker.  Ended up winning $5, so thank you for paying me to drink.

Both apps were out ridiculously fast and were ridiculously delicious.  A tad overpriced at $7 and $6 for happy hour prices, but definitely flavorful enough to write it off.

If this place was open late, I would probably start making this my local bar.  Unfortunately, they close at old people hours.  Going to have to come back and do dinner here, the 2 apps were that good.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,4,1,5,l_q682ASm4W6mHhSrXgrqg

I have only visited their bar area, so I cannot speak for the restaurant, but the attitude of this bar recently is down right appalling.  Howard has been the bartender for quite some time, when he first started he was very attentive and a pleasure to speak with. Lately, he has been cocky and dismissive to anyone who does not play their video poker machines. Preferential treatment is given to video poker players and non-gaming patrons can expect to wait at least 15 minutes to be served. Sorry Embers, but there are far too many other establishments I am more than happy to give my money and loyalty to. See ya!",bjqDo2dBq6n8SEUnIOewKw,4,3,1,jruv53Ty3-1uZLfZZwn0Tw

I decided to come here after putting it off for no reason at all for so long.  Maybe because it's close to where I live, I always think I can go anytime and never do.  As it turned out, we had too much food but that's always a good thing if the food is good.  

I ordered the hamachi sashimi for the first course and my wife ordered the flatbread.  My sashimi was good, flavored with a garlic ponzu sauce and Serrano chili rounds.  My wife's flatbread consisted of a mushroom, spinach, and parmesan topping.  It was quite large and could have been split for two very easily.

For the main course, I went with the grilled miso salmon and jasmine rice, bok choy, edamame, and red pepper.  The salmon was grilled perfectly and was sitting on a mound of rice with the vegetables.  My wife got the wild mushroom risotto with parmesan.  It was very good, too, and there was so much, we got a to go box for dinner later this week.

For dessert, she had the vanilla crème brûlée and I got the warm bread pudding.  My bread pudding was very good.  It was a strawberry-rhubarb bread pudding and came with some vanilla ice cream.  I wasn't allowed to taste the crème brûlée as someone was hogging it all to herself.  She said it was good!

Service was very good with our server bringing someone with her to learn how things work at Embers.

4085904,2014-01-20,0,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"Went to this restaurant based on the Groupon deal. It was not busy and it was a nice little restaurant. 

We sat and the server, whom I believe was named Marcus, was helpful and looked sharp. We ordered a filet benedict with the steak medium rare and a omelet with meat (I can't remember the name picuillo or something to that effect ). We had coffee in the meantime. 

It took some time for our food to come out and when it did, it was disappointing. The steak was closer to medium well, the sauce on the filet also was cold as well as the omelet, which indicates it was probably sitting around for a bit. We were hungry so we ate it but did tell our server our issues. 

They were nice enough to give us a complimentary dessert which was bread pudding. It was delicious! The warm bread pudding along with the vanilla ice cream was scrumtralesent. 

Overall, our main entrees were disappointing because it was cold and steak cooked too long, but with the service being so nice and the dessert being exquisite, along with the nice presentation, I think this place deserves a shot. I will say that if we hadn't gotten  the Groupon, I'd be a little more upset, but I can only base the review on what I experienced.

Bar was packed, I had a bloody mary that was really incredible, I was told by the waitress they make the bloody mary mix by hand, and it tasted like it. The wife ordered fillet, I had the new york. Each entree came with 2 sides, which was a nice change from the ala carte menu everyone seems to do now. The steaks were cooked perfectly just like we ordered. For a side I had a baked potato and the creamed corn. The potato was a large baked potato, nothing special there, but the creamed corn was the best I have ever tasted.

The real kicker is when we were totally ignored when the two other tables near us were getting proper attention. We were walked by so many times its amazing she knew we were still there.

 My husband wanted to order an appetizer we could all share so we ordered  the Crispy Beef Tacos ($9.00) . It came with 3 tacos that looked good but I wasn't sure if I wanted mine . It's just that we eat Mexican food often so I was like , ""I'm just going to take a bite of one "". I ended up eating all of mine because it was delicious! 

I had a hard time choosing what I wanted for my main entree. My husband and brother can go to the fanciest place and still order a burger. I don't get it but that leaves more money for my dinner options lol. They both of course ordered a burger while I was scanning the menu. The appetizers looked really good and the main entrees I had difficulty with. It's because the sides are pre chosen with your the meal . There was a particular one I was interested in  but the side was sweet potatoes. I'm not too fond of sweet potatoes so I kept searching. I decided on the 16 oz Rib eye ($36.00) we were at a steak house so I thought, ""Why not""!?"" The steak was nicely done I loved how juicy it was. It came with smoked Cheddar Polenta Fries , roasted broccoli that was served with a side of Poblano Demi Cream sauce. The fries were fried to a golden brown and they tasted okay. My brother liked them better than I did so I let him have them. The broccoli was still crisp which is a plus for me because I hate soggy veggies. 

My husband and I shared a Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee ($8.00) which was yummy. I particularly like the top the best. 

The prices were very reasonable especially because we also had the 20% off coupon. The food is definitely worth coming back for .  The service was also terrific !

With the ability to order even the best burger or a healthy salad.  The service has always been great and the bartenders are creative with their specialty drinks.  Howard is not only one of the best bartenders in town but also over sees the management of Embers and is very passionate about the food, drinks and service.  He is also a mixologist and comes up with very creative cocktails.   

Bonus : )  They have a few video poker machines and respect that they are for gamblers only. Which if you like to play, you will appreciate.

For my main dish I ordered the slow roasted tri tip. Not only was it plated beautifully but it was mouthwateringly delicious. I ordered it medium and it really gave my jaw a workout. I guess tri tip is cooked a little differently than regular steaks so in hindsight I maybe should have gotten it medium well but it still tasted great!

They have a few video poker machines at the bar, and located at each machine was a sign saying ""if you are not playing do not sit here"". It is common Vegas knowledge that you may be asked to move if you are not playing the machine and someone else wants to.  There were only these 2 seats left at the bar.

When asked what the soup of the day was, he said he wasn't sure but he thought it was Cauliflower.  The soup arrived in quite a large bowl and it was stone cold and lacked flavor.  This was then switched for a Caesar salad.  The flavor was okay, but it was made with iceberg lettuce rather than romaine.  The buttermilk fried chicken, while tender and juicy inside, but was in the fryer too long, as the crispy crust was on the edge of being burned.  The mashed potatoes served with it were luke warm and runny.  I've had much better instant from a box!  My friend had the mushroom risotto, which she said was flavorful and good.

It wasn't a beer day for me, so I went with the Aviation (Gin, Luxardo, Lemon Juice, and Creme De Violette). A girly drink, yes, but so what - if it gets you buzzed, it serves a purpose, right? Veruka got the Stone Smoked Porter, which she said had the after taste of an ashtray.

Appetizer - can't go wrong with the Embers Sliders, served with fries. We were starving, so that hit the spot! For the main course, I ordered the Wild Mushroom Risotto. It was well prepared, and yes, the mushrooms tasted fresh! My dining partner chose the Linguine Frutti di Mare. The scallops were nice and tender, and the fish was moist and flakey. Her only complaint was that there was too much linguine. Picky, picky! For dessert, we shared the Warm Bread Pudding which had some kind of blueberry sauce. It was insanely delicious, and ranks up there with my favorite bread pudding experiences. No chocolate chips in this one, but warm, creamy, crunchy and sweet all at the same time!

(Revision, June 2012)

After two more happy hours and a nice dinner there with different groups of friends, I'd like to add to my previous review:

1. Glad to see that its happy hours are now 4-7 (instead of 5-7); 10-closing; and the patio is opened up for seating earlier now, too!
- This patio by the beautiful fountain is the most attractive setting for happy hour and dinner! We love it!

- 5 STARS  for HH.

2. Its dinner menu offers quite large selections. The one time we had dinner, we had grilled seabass; grilled salmon; seared scallops (special that evening); all delicious!   The price is comparable to that of Roy's.The serving staff was all friendly and efficient. We really enjoyed ourselves there.
- 4 STARS  for dinner.

PREVIOUS REVIEW

Ember Bar and Grill, Boca Park

It is another great sports Bar for Happy Hour with great valued drinks and barfood in a comfortable ambience!
- It has a very inviting patio seating area right next to the beautiful water fountain; a spacious, comfortable bar counter; good selections of tasty goodies on the happy hour menu, not to mention its friendly, attractive, attentive serving staff and barkeep! The bar counter space is so wide/deep, it's comfortable to eat dinner there!

I went there three times with different friends for Happy Hours, and we all enjoyed ourselves there every time. We love their delicious garlic hummas with pita ($5), sliders (tritip or BBQ; $6 each; 2 per order), Chicken Skewers ($6, 2/order). They have expanded their small plate menu for HH as well. Their relatively mellow, dark beer from Oregon ($3) is my favorite among other selections. Wine is $4 per glass, not bad! Yes, Ember has now become another local favorit of mine for Happy Hours!
- Watch out, Gordon Biersch and Kona Grill!

Fried artichoke hearts were a pleasant surprise. Not dripping in grease. Very simple taste, but once you bite into it, it was very savory. Lemon aoli added the perfect zing. Even the bed of greens were quite unexpected. 

The mac was slightly disappointing, as I thought there would be huge chunks of pork belly as I've seen at other establishments. The mac was also far too saucy as opposed to creamy. 

Tri tip sliders absolutely killed it. Just the right amount of bbq and tons of meat in between 2 cute little buns. 

Margarita was decent. Boulavardier was strong and bold... Just how I like it. Can't wait to try their lion's head as it also has bourbon. 

Bread pudding was eh. Pretty simple but the walnuts added a nice texture and spin, as did the tahitian vanilla ice cream. 

Loved morgan, our server. Very nice. Was able to articulately answer our questions and offered her honest opinion.

We came here during their anniversary which had 50% off your entire bill...food, drinks, everything!  Yeeeee :P  We ate pretty much EVERYTHING on the menu lol :

Bacon Wrapped Dates ($7): Toasted Almond, Blue Cheese, and Pomegranate Reduction. These are soooo good! Blows FF's version outta the water!  I will order these EVERY single time I am here :)

Grilled Chimichurri Chicken Breast Sandwich ($14): Butter Lettuce, Tomato, Red Pepper Chili Aioli, and French Fries. This was good! Cooked perfectly and I love the chimichurri sauce!  Good portion size and value.

Linguine Frutti di Mare ($29): Sea Bass, Rock Shrimp, Scallops, Salmon, and Spicy Shellfish Tomato Sauce. This was cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor in each bite. A bit spendy, but a great dish.

Grilled Filet and Mushroom Skewers ($16): Roasted Tomato & Hominy, Herb Salad, and Grilled Tomato Salsa. Tender, flavorful beef, but the portion is on the small end at the price point in my book.

BBQ Tri Tip Sliders ($9): Smoked Cheddar, House Made BBQ, and French Fries. Good portion here...very sweet bbq sauce, but the overall taste is good.

Seared Blackened Tuna ($15): Cucumber Mango Relish, Tempura Crunch, and Mango Sriracha Puree. This was tasty! Good combination of flavors.

Roasted Garlic Hummus ($8): Grilled Pita and Marinated Chickpeas. Very tasty and large portion of hummus...we asked for more pita bread so it wouldn't go to waste!  I will probably order this next time!

Tempura Rock Shrimp Misto ($12): Avocado, Red Fresno, and Ponzu. Very good! Lightly breaded, cooked well, and lots of flavor!

Grilled Chicken Skewers ($10): Roasted Pepper Couscous, Chimmichurri, and Red Pepper Chili Aioli. Very juicy, tender chicken with yummy chimmichurri and dipping sauces!

Fried Artichoke Hearts ($10): Spring Mix and Spinach Lemon Aioli. Not a big fan of artichokes, but everyone else enjoyed this dish

Goat Cheese and Fig Crostinis ($8): Roasted Fennel and Micro Greens. I don't usually enjoy goat cheese, but everyone else at the table enjoyed this very much!

Crispy Beef Tacos ($9): Cucumber, Red Onion, and Tomato. This is VERY sweet...almost like a bulgogi seasoning with lots of sugar. The combination of the vinegary cucumbers was not for me...you might like it, but I didn't.  :(

And for dessert :

Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Gelato ($9). This was good, classic lava cake, but the portion is a bit small.

Warm Bread Pudding with Vanilla Gelato ($9). This was good...not as good as I thought it would be, since the bread pudding didn't really impress.

Not sure what they include in their HAPPY HOUR, but this place is a solid 3.5-4 stars even with the higher price point to me.  If you come here when the prices are cheaper, I had a 4.5-5 star experience!

Generally skewing my dining out towards Saturdays as to allow for a lazy Sunday, the Martin Luther King extended weekend conveniently allowed me to visit a spot just down the street for Sunday brunch with a new friend - the noon start time of the AFC Championship, a 20% off coupon, and wonderful customer service from a reservationist named May further sweetening the deal promised by a creative brunch menu.  Billed as an American Grille and located in upscale Boca Park near Sambalatte and Panera it was just before noon when we arrived at Embers and opting for a seat at the bar instead of the small dining room in order to afford full vantage of the dual plasma screens it would not be long before we were greeted by the friendly bartender and with menus presented plus a round of stiff but well-crafted $8 cocktails soon in hand the meal that followed would unfold in three acts, each piping hot and nicely presented at a veritable bargain even before the discount.  Opting to pair sweet with savory at each course it was with six dates curled in crispy bacon that found  adept balance in funky bleu and light acid that we began and moving on to the smoky yet smooth juxtaposition of bacon and garlic Alfredo atop crisp bread the hits continued to arrive as round two served up at least eight ounces of aromatic, juicy chicken amidst mild curry on one plate and the dish of the afternoon on the other, two slices of custard imbued French Toast with light cocoa notes serving to mellow fresh, boozy fruits as granola added just a touch of sweetness and plenty of crunch.  Battling satiety from prior means yet still debating a third proper course as the first half of the game wound to an end it was with a bit of sadness that we ended up passing on both the pancakes and the fried chicken sliders, but unable to resist dessert it was in the restaurant's bread pudding that we invested our last bites - the warm buttery croissants layered with fresh apples and soaked through with custard before being crowned with a ball of gelato and finished table side with rich crème anglaise, the end result a slowly melting masterpiece on par with some of the city's best and plenty of impetus to head back in the future for the chicken, pancakes, and a second round.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,6,5,T7K5nmpUd24VbS7up2OAjg

I was eyeing the fried chicken and biscuits or the blueberry ricotta pancakes. Only a mile away, we hopped in a cab and were seated immediately. 

Best cure for a hangover? MORE DRINKS!!!  While the unlimited mimosas, bellinis and bloody Mary's definitely sounded appealing, they have a great beer selection so I went that route. FYI the wait or said those unlimited are interchangeable so you can bounce from a mimosa to a bloody, etc. I'm a Belgian drinker and they had a few of my favs so I drank bottles of Trappistes Rochefort 10, followed by Westmalle Tripel after the food came out. What hangover?!  

We both ordered the blueberry ricotta pancakes and I'll actually have to say I was pretty disappointed. On one hand, they served their purpose and soaked up last nights intoxication, on the other hand, the pancakes looked much more amazing than they truly were. Perfect in appearance, they were a little doughy and truly lacked flavor. I felt like I was eating bland white bread. They were so doughy that I had to look and make sure they were actually cooked. Neither the blueberries not the sauce were sweet and we actually ended up putting syrup on them. A lightly flavored lemon ricotta ball was placed on top of the pancakes just like butter normally is and that wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Sadly the food was nothing to write home about.

We tried the goat cheese and fig crostinis, bacon-wrapped dates, Embers sliders, tempura rock shrimp misto, tomato basil soup and our server's suggestion: slow-roasted tri tip. They do have food and drink specials but not on the night we went.

Goat Cheese and Fig Crostinis:
Come with fennel and micro greens. I love goat cheese since it doesn't make my stomach hurt as much as cheese from cow's milk. The crostini is crisp. The goat cheese is creamy and a bit tart balanced by the sweetness and crunchiness of the fig. 5/5

Bacon-Wrapped Dates:
Almond on the inside with blue cheese and pomegranate reduction. This is easy to make but I always get this wherever it is offered (like tapas restaurants). I just love this stuff. 5/5

Embers Sliders:
Butter lettuce, red pepper chili aioli, shallot, smoked cheddar and fries on the side. Just your plain old cheeseburger sliders. I was not in the mood to try their BBQ tri tip sliders and chose this instead. 3/5

Tempura Rock Shrimp Misto:
Battered and fried shrimps, avocado, tomatoes and pepper with ponzu for dipping. The fried avocado and shrimps were quite good. The sauce was a bit basic. 3.5/5

Slow-Roasted Tri Tip:
Comes with sweet potato puree, sauteed spinach and BBQ sauce. The meat was tender and not bad with the sweet potato. 3.5/5

Starters are anywhere from $8-16. Soups/salads from $8-16. Entrees from $14-37. Desserts $9.  Our total with food and drinks was $92.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,1,1,4,HW1-bI0144hc_IYIeBUNGw

Eggs Benedict came with the egg hard, common mistake so I sent it back. Pancakes came paperthin so we tried to eat like crapes. One bite in and realized it was doughy  inside.

New eggs Benedict came and whites were not done and it was tasteless.

I've passed this place many a time, but always thought it was a steakhouse or something.  It's actually got a very laid-back vibe going on, with breakfast, burgers, small plates, and sandwiches on the brunch menu, which is served until 3pm on the weekends.  Reservations were suggested on the Groupon, so I called that morning and made some for us, but it wasn't busy when we arrived at 11:30am.  Instead of the eggs, hash browns, and toast or veggie omelet that I would normally have at a breakfast joint, I wanted to try something different.  Consulting our waitress on which she would recommend, the White Chocolate Cinnamon French Toast or the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes, she said the former were her favorite.  I was not disappointed.  I don't have French toast very often at all, so I was happy that these were tasty, not soggy, overdone, or too sweet, even with a bit of syrup.  The granola was a nice touch, adding a crunch.  
     The non-breakfast and dinner menu items look tempting and the prices are not outlandish.  I will definitely be back and recommend it if you're looking for a new place to try in this part of the valley",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,7,4,yvhPdZDP8nZV4Z3LDwbI7A

The family and I were in town for a few days and were weary of the glitz/cheesiness of the the Vegas Casino-Resort fare and were tapping away at our iphone Yelp app for help. 

Up comes Embers and it met all the ""filtered"" search criteria. 

Located within an upper crust shopping center in the affluent Westside of Vegas (lots of European Luxury cars/SUVs in the parking lot), we decided not to venture into the frequently crowded Cheesecake Factory (we already have that back home) and take a crack at Embers. 

The interior is dark, chic modern, the servers and staff wear black (the opposite of Cheesecake Factory), seating is cozy...yet, abundant and there's a happening bar with a large HDTV playing the football game. There's a nice vibe about this joint with smooth R&B playing in the background, made my head nod. :) The place was about 1/2 full with lots of lively folks of all walks, hanging mostly at the bar. Lots of couples having intimate dinners together, snuggled and feeding each other (awww). 

The menu is fine tuned, condensed with popular offerings they do well. 

The grub was well presented, tasty and satisfying. We got the Asian Poke appetizers (so good, we ordered another) the kids got gourmet 10oz bacon burgers (huge), wifey got the salmon and I got the salad/steak combo. Service was quick, friendly and efficient with no issues. 

All in all, we had a great experience here. We will keep this place in mind for a return visit when we're in town again. A fine alternative to the crowded Cheesecake Factory nearby. 

Too bad they don't have calamari appetizers. :(",cHpXABKFJ9oWZwE4IK-Z8Q,15,11,4,chZII6-TYb28Azy1vDF5FA

Crispy Beef Tacos are delicious, with a hint of spice and sweetness.Sea bass skewers are cooked perfectly light, with a sauce that makes you keep dipping them even though they are perfect on their own. The White chocolate french toast was so good I almost ordered a 2nd helping even though I was full. Today I had the smoked salmon benedict and it was delicious, the hollandaise sauce is one of my favorites ever. Eventually I will try the entire menu, but so far its been one great meal after another.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,0,0,5,LYArg7mbnypG6yeOAZ5vag

I've been using Open Table in combination with Yelp to avoid disappointment and the ""it'll be 45 minutes for your table"" response that you will hear at popular family places like The Yardhouse or BJ's.

When I tell ""Management"" I have booked ""Embers"", her response was lees than enthusiastic. The ""old"" Embers was a sort of BBQ joint hidden beneath a quite sophisticated Boca Park location. We hate BBQ.

""but,but,but"" I eloquently respond ""there's a new menu"".

We arrive and are greeted by a very friendly hostess, offered two different tables, window or booth in back and are promptly seated.

Our server immediately arrived and got us drinks and sodas.

Menu has changed, extensive without being over complicated.

We had a couple of appetizers, ahi tuna on little rice cakes, delicious, light and well presented. After they were done, the Tandoori chicken skewers arrived. Just as good.
Our server noticed that one of the teens wasn't eating and brought him a bread basket. Nice touch.

Mains: We shared Beef Tacos, Griiled Salmon, Fish & Chips and the Cheese Burger. All were top notch.

Belly full, 2 beers, two Chardonnay, countless sodas $120 before tip.

We are coming back, it will be a new regular venue.",hRzmJCPmV1_ggM5jSxq2bA,1,2,5,Fggx3BafcIcelQ_84MfDIA
5956256,2014-08-31,0,6MpOzb5ImLdDXHsn4HwI-Q,"My husband and I finally had a date night, and I'd been wanting a good stake for weeks. We decided to try Embers since it was close to home and their online menu seemed to have what we were looking for. I made reservations, but when we got there, noticed it really wasn't necessary.

The place was smaller than I was expecting, but not too small. The atmosphere was more contemporary than most steakhouses. The hostess greeted us immediately and sat us down.  Our drinks arrived quickly, and we were ready to order. The food arrived amazingly fast, especially for a steakhouse, and everything was fresh! My steak was mouthwatering, just what I needed.

I rarely do desserts, especially after a hearty meal, but their portions were perfect, and left me with just enough room. I tried their creme brulee, and was not disappointed.

This is definitely our new ""spot."" Looking forward to our next visit!",v0ubSOMRPxyUD5PinPlwMw,0,0,5,ViLLqSqLjdIqtXbZS2VKfg
