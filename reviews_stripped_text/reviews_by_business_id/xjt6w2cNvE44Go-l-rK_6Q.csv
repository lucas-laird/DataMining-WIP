Despite being overwhelmed, the baristas were very friendly and got me my drink within a few minutes of ordering.  No complaints; except they may be too good and too busy, but they still do just fine.",YcGAQ8iXMzHA0r_7ee_qMA,1,0,4,NL_ATXxFiojI78HehxndRg

I don't know if I've ever dealt with a less attentive barista. Friendly sand smiley enough, just not retaining any info coming through the speaker box. I ordered tea, w milk, honey, and egg bites. She specifically asked how much honey - 3 packets - and what kind of egg bites, bacon or egg whites - bacon. When I got to the window, no milk or honey, and egg bites were egg whites. So had to ask for the milk and honey again, gave me FIVE honey packets, then had to ask for a stirrer, gave me FIVE stirrers. I didn't realize the egg bite situation until after since I was driving. 
None of this is a big deal, but come on - just listen when someone's talking and answering your questions. I know some people have insanely complicated orders; how in the world can you get those right when you can't remember what goes in a simple tea or what version of one out of only two varieties of egg bites someone orders. And super wasteful - five stirrers for one cup. Like seriously - it's just dumb.",wfK7oukwc90fVqFG2lw87w,0,0,3,6ADtefU4ORdD-zjeUPs1OA

4655439,2013-10-16,2,xjt6w2cNvE44Go-l-rK_6Q,"This will be a moderate review or in Starbuck's terminology, a grande review. The best way to summarize the Starbuck's at the southeast corner of Decatur and Charleston Boulevards is BIG ON CONVENIENCE AND SHORT ON COMFORT.

  The location sits at the corner of two hyper-busy Las Vegas highways in a Super Walmart Shopping Center surrounded by fast food places. If you are shopping, eating out, or cruising along eastbound Charleston and north and southbound Decatur (Decatur entrance controlled by a traffic signal) this is a convenient Starbuck's for a caffeine boost.

  This has to be one of the tiniest Las Vegas Starbucks that I have visited. It just isn't very conducive to relaxing. There are only four tables, five counter stools, and a couch; which can fill up quickly in a hyper-busy area. The standard handicap table is nonexistent. On another note, a password combo is necessary to access the rest room. Forget about a drive-thru. It is attached to a Panda Express and Jamba Juice.

  This Starbuck's needs some work to be the third place that it is supposed to be. I would not be surprised if Starbuck's rebuilds this location nearby as a modern third place with a drive-thru.

*This Starbuck's is shown in an incorrect location. I checked into a Decatur Boulevard location that shows this store. Oh well.
