The service is great. I pay with cash so the $.50 charge the other reviewer freaked out about is no issue.

Never been disappointed with the food but sometimes it comes out really good(I like my fries extra crispy so that is always a plus). Night staff is pretty cool, oddly enough when I started open carrying they actually started making conversation. But I avoid this plus during the day. I get a lot of nasty looks even before I was open carrying. I get this a lot in Mexican stores/restaurants, it's like they don't want my white business. It is pretty annoying that they charge for debit/credit card usage. Would be less of hassle since I go to the bank to pull out some cash so I don't have to pay the extra charge. I feel like business should just absorb that fee buts that's just me. All in all, cool place for some late night food.",ZK9HhS0Gt6eUzFyPXHSTrw,0,0,4,11xHWmCxa8shogsQiub7zg

What did get to me was I was waiting there for three min while the people in the back stood there. The second thing that bothered me is the   
$.50 charge to use your card. This is straight up taking people's money for no other reason than to make more money and screw your customers. 
Robertos! It's 2016! Everyone pays with some type of card! Stop scamming your customers out of money! 
I personally will never go back to this location due to that fact. I hope that less and less people do and say something about it until they change their archaic ways of doing business. 
I will say though, that the food was delicious as expected.",qJXA5Qtn0gqCcJ_SsvF4Kw,4,0,3,2quEUMf77Xwg94INn_fIMg

We go back tonight and order 12 rolled tacos with guacamole only and come home to find them covered in sour cream only. NO guacamole. We call again just to be insulted by the worker who answered the phone saying he knows there was guacamole on them. Basically accusing me of lying. Great customer service. Please see our picture as proof that there was no guacamole on them. He puts me on hold for five minutes to come back on and say the only thing we can do is if you bring them back right now. You just lost a loyal customer and I will spread the news of your horrible customer service to everyone I know.

Now at the 30 minute mark we told the cashier we either wanted a discount or our money back and we would eat elsewhere. They refused both and by that time our food was ready so he said he wouldn't give us our money back because our food was ready now. We asked for his name and the mangers name. The employee refused to give us his name and said he didn't have a manager at all. After arguing with him for several minutes asking for the manager or owners name he finally have us a generic 800 number but then refused to give us our customer copy receipt back that he had taken when they lost our order.

I mentioned when it first opened how clean it was and my BIL assured me it would be just as greasy and grimy as every other Roberto's in no time. Not so, sir! They've been open for a while and are just as clean as when they opened. 
On our most recent visit, I got a ham breakfast burrito and my husband did a steak breakfast burrito add bacon. The green salsa was friggen' spicy that day!

The meat is good quality, never fatty.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they charge $0.50 to pay with a credit card.  This is a turn off for a lot of people.  They should have just thought through the menu and charged 3% more per item to recover the credit card fees.  Then no one would know and all would be happier.

Where's the guac?!
How do you charge extra for guac and forget to put it in?!

You should realize, when someone orders something extra on their meal, they look out for that extra ingredient. Did you think I wouldn't notice? 

I cut this burrito in half, started on one side never to find guac. When I grab the other half to try again on my quest to find the delicious avocado mix, nothing. 
Crushed. Im full, with no guac to accompany the others that sit in my stomach. 

Good burrito. Just missing what i paid extra for...

How ever a week later I came back a couple times and I saw them doing a method where they have carne asada already cooked and being kept warm in a metal jar over the grill with tongs in it. I guess they do this so that they don't have to keep cooking a fresh batch of meat every time they get an order but it's horrible. And it doesn't make any sense because carne asada only takes 3 minutes to cook. I got my food and the meat was barely warm and tasted stale and hard. This is coming from someone who ate Roberto's growing up in Vegas. Lazy method by lazy employees. I asked them to re make my order and make me fresh meat and they did.

This location is attached to the AM/PM gas station, it's clean when I go, the condiment bar is stocked and the people working are nice. I've only had an issue of a mistake on an order once and it was fixed without a problem.

So my food recommendations.. Get a breakfast burrito anytime of day, they are huge, made fresh and ask if you want extra cheese or anything you prefer. Carne asada or adobada is really good from Robertos especially on chips or fries and I always ask for my fries extra crispy. I also recommend to skip the Wednesday chicken taco deal, they are fried and usually dripping in grease and just not worth it.

I will definitely be back to this Robertos for a carne asada breakfast burrito with extra cheese!",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,4,MnVyyFg_n8qfEvKMV7YHiQ
