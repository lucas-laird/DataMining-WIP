She wouldn't even look my direction when I got my food, not even an apology. I waited 40 min for one pizza and crazy bread. If my kids weren't starving I would've demanded a refund and left.

But the pizza is barely worth the $5 and when you call in to save time and they tell it will ready in 15, what the really mean is 45 minutes.

The wait for ""hot n ready"" is always several minutes. The employees are highly untrained, and we learned the hard way to be pushy to get treated fairly because they're certainly not paying attention. Not worth it.

They proceeded to take the next persons order. Um excuse me, can you grab my box of pizza right behind you? They proceed to tell me they have none and that there's a 20 minute wait. I demanded my money back, drove to a different location and had pizza. Took less than 10 minutes to go somewhere else.",VIsSr0blrfL62aW7dxE8AA,0,0,1,vWgcqj7l2BQBD3WL5dPgPg
1506587,2017-12-31,0,5qK5rJxwo0cjP3vTf3lkSA,Horrible service!!!! Waited at least 25 minutes for bread. They have a sign saying if we domt offer you crazy bread then you ger it free....not once did i hear the female cashier offer ir to anyone...not even myself. The employees looked like bums. No hairnets on food handlers no upselling wbatsoever! Idk how they keep their doors open. Pizza was cold and the italian cheese bread i ordered that took over 20 minutes to make had no flavor and  hardly had any cheese on it. Wanted buffalo wings...they didnt have the sauce...only bbq or plain? I will not go back to this place again!,3yeA-K0tVRPHuU7VCF1chg,0,0,1,wu8fLAxv_qnArBiOwWrUMA

I went there last night to pick it up, she instantly remembered who I was.  She apologized multiple times, and was very genuine& nice.  I asked to buy 2 of the sauces& she freed those out too. Places get busy , def on Friday nights, the fact that she did everything she could to make it better & was genuine, is the reason ill be coming back.",9jZk5Iiqnuosl75rZhBdMg,1,0,5,xuHri2VaxksGC9gkZTAViQ

2622232,2016-05-07,0,5qK5rJxwo0cjP3vTf3lkSA,I love Little Ceasars Pizza for $5 but this location is disgusting!! Obviously they're using imitation cheese because the taste is gross and there's way way way way way too much sauce on the pizza there is no flavor at all whatsoever it's worse than Domino's. I'll never go here again. I suggest anyone else who wants Little Caesars drive a little further to a better location because this is truly truly disgusting. If I could write it no stars I would.,y-s0GnY6BLc5UKmaiLP8Ow,0,0,1,xJCXCxvz7awI3v9U8pY6rQ
2625346,2017-02-16,0,5qK5rJxwo0cjP3vTf3lkSA,Visiting from out of state. Hot and ready really is just a catch phrase for this location. Been twice and both times had to wait for pizza to come out. The first night a customer came after me and orders two pizzas.  The clerk took his money sent to the back cut his pizzas and delivered. Then I waited another five minutes.   At least it's only five bucks and my pizza was fresh.,_GKSUcJDxmyfeO-QJGNJeQ,0,0,1,tmuA9iVeMP3wk883oaSL6g

There where 3 people who came in AFTER me who got their orders of bread  now I am a patient person but 10 minute for bread that was already out of the oven and just waiting on the girl to bag up TWO orders at the same time?!? 

It is so chaotic here. Workers yelling at each other and instead of helping they yell back that they won't do what the other asked. I'm all for having fun at work but don't do it in front of costumers. Looks so unprofessional",gkQIMXPFYyhHkB8hswjIjw,0,0,1,fLRpwc43dNaCrVdvolqlfQ

I guess that's what you get for 5.00!!. Tonight we went at 8:20. We waited behind TWO people for over 20 minutes wanting to get a pizza. The lady working the register was so slow. she was more concerned throwing the boxes of old pizzas out onto the floor and looking confused at ticket orders than helping the line of customers going out the door. We watched pizzas from the oven being thrown on stacks of boxes just sitting their until she had time to cut them. We finally got her to take our order after 20 minutes waiting. It came from the holding bin!! Knowing it sat there the 20 minutes we waited and not knowing how long it was in there before we got there! Burnt and dry as toast! Thanks lady!! Maybe you should get those pizzas out faster so they are fresh Disgusting!!,gNSRp5Gf0Pfp82if7fhh3g,0,0,1,Juz570XTKexTayPc-zAFiQ

They were pale and soggy! And they didn't give me marinara. So I had to go back, and then they gave me some ice cold sauce. Very disappointed!",1dE_IA9jvKuNT-Gm5QV8gw,0,0,1,g71Ul3Nqm0_gV175CafV-A

Tonight we waited over 30 mins for an order of breadsticks and we weren't the only ones.  For some reason the cashier took all the orders but then never fired the orders.  People were complaining and some even wanted refunds and left.  We were so hungry by this point and waited so long already that we stayed for our breadsticks.  In the end, they didn't even put enough garlic on them and they were dry.",upNep4Q2mMownruMWtUVGA,4,0,1,VjpwirlK4gH-sGpo6x4vQA

4060124,2015-10-29,0,5qK5rJxwo0cjP3vTf3lkSA,"""Are machine is down"" things you hear when the place is backed up and nothing is ready. I asked a customer how long they been waiting and said 25-30min. Cashier is friendly but don't get me wrong telling your customer the machine is down is why your backed up is a lie. How are you taking my card and everyone else of the register is messed up. How are you making more pizza if the machine is messed up! Caught lying big time. I worked fast food before and when computer is down, you can tell it's down. I was told 10 min my pizza will be ready. I set my timer and so far time is up and bout to go past my time limit. Definitely not hot and ready BIG TIME!  Right now all I hear is gibberish in the back and it's not related to work. This place should hire people who want to work and need the money. People here working seem like they just in it for the heck of it and working at their own pace which is SLOW! No one is expediting, if I could go back there I would record every single one of them. I wonder if they even wash their hands cause the cashier here with glasses just touch a bunch of pizza. Almost 15 min in now and still no pizza. Come on I would have gone to pizza hut if this was the case. I've been here multiple time and never left a review till now because this is getting out of hand and its RIDICULOUS.  Alright so I spotted a girl working hard and an employee called her stephanie, now she working hard. After 35min I finally got my order WTF.",8Fu9GsqxxlG8l_LrodWe9g,0,0,1,2hDLkwHP1r2PMggH5aurhw

They told us it would be 15 minutes, we went about 30 min later and they still didn't have our order ready. When we finally got our order they gave us a Deep Dish Double  Stuffed Pizza... When we told the cashier that this was not our order, they kept insisting that it was and didn't even charge us. I immediately assumed this was someone else's. I don't mind free pizza, but I would prefer to also have my original order, due to some pepperoni hatters in my household and i don't like cheese all that much so this pizza was completely pointless. Me going home with Deep Dish and only pepperoni... nah. So we claimed that we would wait and pay. She kept insisting that I was wrong and this was my order.. I haven't even payed yet, but she claimed that I did. So i ended up leaving with Deep Dish double stuffed.

Every time I have been here, service was slow and the hot and ready pizzas were hardly hot, minimal amount of pepperoni, and barely even cooked thoroughly. I even asked if they had any other fresh ones or to even put what I bought back in the oven to cook it a bit more but I get shrugged off with an attitude.

The first few times I thought maybe it was just an off day and gave it a few more tries because it was the closest one to me but this Little Caesar's location was consistently off.
