I'm glad we got their 1 slice for a buck to try it out.
I was expecting a thin, floppy slice instead it was light cheese, bland tomato sauce, stiff bit will say the crust had a nice crust. Maybe this is some sort of pizza a certain city like Chicago eats but I wasn't loving it. 
I will say, I did it eat it once I layered the parm on it.
Also they say they are the founders of Villa Pizza. I don't  think Villa pizza here in Vegas unless their recipe is now different. Still the staff was very friendly, the place is well decorated, prices decent..

We ordered a xl pizza which they offered to cut into some extra slices for us because we were all splitting a pizza.  My little group ordered a carmines special split with a meat lovers. I was sad we couldn't do the white pizza with the carmines special, but we were told you couldn't mix red and white. Either way, the pizza was delicious!

2188805,2016-04-28,1,60uVlCUiLJvq3xNo_3bhQQ,"I was glad to see this new pizza place open just a few minutes from my house.   They had a special for their opening day for $5.99 large pizza.   I figured you can't beat that so I would give it a try.  The staff was very nice and friendly.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was very inviting and warm.   Solid family environment with at least one fairly large flat screen tv on the well.  
But most importantly, I'll give my review of the pizza.   I got a large pie with meatballs.   It was actually a beautiful looking pie.   Looked like the kind of pizza you can eat all day every day (assuming you didn't care about getting fat or an early death).  Unfortunately, the pizza was more appealing to my eyes than it was to my taste buds.  The crust was solid but honestly it was just bland.  I think the culprit was the sauce.  Just not very flavorful.   
I'd think about stopping in for the dollar slices they offer from 11-4, but probably not.  I just didn't like the pizza much.   Didn't have much flavor.   And the meatballs I added as the topping was pretty flavorless as well.  I know all people have different preferences in pizza, but Carmine's did not hit the spot for me.  Wish you guys the best with your restaurant but I'm not  sold on making this a place I would regularly come for pizza.",lzgEUPNFGboDm1U7aO8gTQ,2,1,3,F19kygjT4kVZZUUMbNgADQ

Sauce was definitely in need of some seasoning.  I hardly use salt on any of my food and this pizza needed it.  The cheese on my husbands Meat Lover wasn't completely melted but what can you do.  Now the wings.  They were good in size/taste and we ordered the hottest sauce they had,  which isn't hot to us by never the less tastes ok.  The weird thing was we got 7 wings in our order.  Usually you get 10 wings in an order or at the very least 8 but never ever have we gotten 7.  Maybe they portion it by weight but I mean come on, 7 wings, lol.

Opted with rigatoni a la carmine (simple but great flavor), XL carmine special (I was very impressed and not only by the size!! Hahaha) and finished with the zeppoles.

Kinda seemed pricy for what was ordered... But worth it for the portion size and delicious flavor. And I'd like to think I have a refined palate for amazing foods. The crust for this pizza... Oh goodness... Yum.

First off I have to comment on the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff, very impressive first walking in. Very casual atmosphere with New York memorabilia across the walls. They offer outdoor or indoor seating.

The staff is very attentive and happy to accommodate any dietary needs. They offer a wide variety of items on their menu. Specifically they offer $1 cheese pizza slice for dairy enthusiasts!! Our table ordered a VEGAN personal pizza with mushrooms jalapenos and pineapple( note: they were sparse with their toppings and do charge per topping.), 4 cheese slices of pizza and a basket of fries.

Our drinks were refilled before they emptied. Food was made fresh, quickly and ACCURATELY! Which is very important for patrons with dietary needs. I.E.: vegans. Home made ranch was brought out to the table for the fries. All food had freshness you could taste. Very impressive that nothing tasted stale or frozen. 

Overall, this is a really cool hidden local spot to grab lunch or dinner. I recommend the pizza highly, non greasy all the way around. Outdoor seating is intimate and quaint for a date night or family dinner. Must visit!",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,2,2,5,tvg3UCYCoZn5EHpiiJUCxw

Is it the same carmines? If so, could it be as good? Somethings are best left in the past, retrospect makes you remember them better but Carmine's pizza is NOT one of those things. It's just as good as I remember if not better!

I haven't had the pasta yet but the pizza is typical New York style, mellenzan was good, garlic chicken was insane, chicken was moist and I found a chicken bone on it... so you know it was good chicken!

Can't wait to have an amatriciana.

I ordered a couple times (delivery) and I love the service. One time, the chef messed up my order; but I had some picky friends in that did a custom job and it was a Friday night, so I didn't hold it against em....but they credited me a free pizza next time I ordered and then Gianni called me up the next day to make sure it was good.

Carmine's Pizza Kitchen is located on the corner of Sunset & Fort Apache not too far away from my house. I've seen it plenty of times driving past and kept saying I must try them out. This weekend I put the procrastination to rest and decided to give them a shot.. So the fact that they sell pizza by the slice really sold me because there are far too many time I have a crazing for a pizza but don't want to buy a whole box. 

When I walked in, I was greeted right away by the front counter person and helped right away. Pizza by the slice? Well I kept it simple with a single slice of cheese pizza which only came to $1.87 or something. Not bad! I was expecting more but that price was great. While I waited in the dining room I noticed that they actually have a full service restaurant type of set up with a server and everything! The ambiance of the place is really cool and you get the feel of being in New York City. I took a look at the menu more in depth and noticed that they have a wide range of options so I will definitely be back. 

The to-go menu offered that cheese pizza slices were $1 with a maximum of 2 slices per person and of course I didn't notice this until after the fact so I left wondering why the person who took my order didn't tell me about this. Other than that situation the review would've been a 5-star but menu knowledge is critical and basically I could've just bought two slices if that was the case..",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,3,3,4,VxV3xV2k5QifIFszqE39UQ

Placing the order was quick and friendly. We ordered fried calamari, antipasto salad, pasta fagioli soup and the sausage/pepper sandwich. The food arrived in an acceptable amount of time by a friendly driver. My antipasto salad was very good although I prefer any other type of lettuce to iceberg which was the only lettuce it had. I'm sure I could have asked before hand and asked them to use romaine or mixed greens, so my bad. It had a delicious big chunk of mozzarella on it with salt/pepper and balsamic. It also had other delicious toppings as described on the menu. The calamari was good. It had whole tiny octopus if you are into that (which my family was). My husband enjoyed the sausage/pepper sandwich a lot. The pasta falgoli soup was good. It was a bland tan color with pretty much just beans and pasta, more beans than pasta which I liked. I believe they were white beans. The flavor was simple and comfortingly good. Very filling. I only got the cup size but the soup alone could have been a meal. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ranch dressing but this really boils down to personal preference. It certainly wasn't bad but I prefer a little thicker consistency and a different taste which I can't describe. You'll just have to try it.

But you would never guess that because of how mature and engaging she was.  If I could have, I would have also tipped her in pokeballs as she hasn't had time in the past few days to collect any since she's been so busy this summer. 

We got to the restaurant a little after 6pm and the restaurant was empty. So I was a little afraid that we made a bad choice. However, a few minutes later, a family of 5 came in and the patriarchs were Italian. Apparently, this family was a regular to the restaurant. My husband and I enjoyed eaves dropping on their conversation about where their fathers worked in NY. And few minutes after that, two young couples also dined-in. 

Food was excellent. We ordered calamari for appetizers, my husband ordered the chicken Parmesan with linguini, while I ordered the eggplant Parmesan with spaghetti. 

The size of the chicken Parmesan was more than half the size of the plate. And the thickness of the chicken was about 1/2 an inch. For both dishes, there was plenty of marinara sauce that I needed to use the dinner roll to sop up the sauce to ensure it wouldn't spill over into my dress. 

Although we didn't have pizza, my husband did ask about the $1/slice pizza. It is a $1 cheese pizza. If you, it is $.75 for each topping. 

We loved the decor of the restaurant. My husband  commented on the amount of pictures they had as it filled up every wall space. The restaurant and restroom was very clean. Outdoor dining is also available but never a choice of mine during the summer. 

Carmine's, my new favorite neighborhood restaurant.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,4,3,5,MrUH_-6zDHBbYsh6Km6DcQ

If they've changed at all, it's for the better (which is hard to do). The pizza is great, but the PASTA?....you can't get any better for the price! They used to have a really nice sports bar/ dining establishment on S. Durango, and I wasn't sure this humble looking new place would ""measure up"" to the outstanding food they served there....my worries withered away when I ordered the lasagna, my long-time favorite, and for the first time, rigatoni al la carmine. Now the only trouble I have is deciding which to order!!! 
From the flavor of the dishes, to the portion sizes, to the price, you can't beat Carmine's for neighborhood Italian food.

Note: the bad reviews on here prompted me to right a review (my 1st). Those reviews really seem unreasonably harsh and unforgiving. Even if I received ""less than perfect"" service, I'd try and remember no one is 100% ALL the time!

The only exception to the wait staff was them steering us away from ordering a larger pizza due to ""wasting our money."" Finally when the pizza came, it lacked flavor. 

You could not taste the sauce at all, just a dense crust and the topping. We came back hoping all the ""bugs"" would be worked out and for a better experience but it wasn't.

He did what I asked and my verdict is....

Meatball sub was alright. Meatballs were ginormous so that was awesome but it was fairly bland. The pizza on the other hand was pretty good. It's a thinner type of pizza so don't expect it to be a thick crust.

For entrees, I ordered the ""Meatballs on a Dish"" and Hubby got the ""Sausage Parmigiana"" Hero. My Meatballs were bland and so bad I ate 1/2 of one out of 4. The sauce was also thin and tasteless. The Sausage on the Hero was also bland and the only good thing to say about it is the bread was really delicious! We were too disappointed to order dessert.

The crust did have a nice crunchy texture to it, and it's not this big huge crust either. I thought it went well. I had a special and a cheese. The cheese was great, it had a creaminess to it, that it reminded me of eating mac n cheese. The special was good too, onions and peppers were diced so not overwhelming,  helps them cook even too.

Upon entering this charming little pizza place, on the southwest side of town, I was graciously greeted by Wes. He politely said that I could sit where ever I want. So I picked the corner facing the whole dining area, adoring the walls, displaying such beautiful NYC pictures. Then Wes asked me what I would like to drink, and I was actually ready for that and my order, I was famished! He clearly explained to me how that dollar slice worked, and the additional seventy-five cent per topping. That deal sounded great to me!  I first ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of Italian sausage, and both were absolutely delicious! Where do I begin? That crust was perfectly done! That is essential, because that is the foundation of the pie. Those two slices weren't enough. I was still hungry. So, I then ordered another two slices. This time I got the meatball and the anchovy. It's ridiculous, because it just keeps getting better! I made sure I took a picture of this pair. The first two was eaten immediately. I was too hungry to take pictures! lol After eating all four slices, I still managed to order and eat a cannoli. That just topped my amazing meal! The owner/manager, John, even sat with me, and told me a brief history of his pizza business. That was very nice. It was such an amazing experience. My meal was even better, due to the fact that the service by Wes, was exceptional. He was beyond courteous to begin with. The other lady server, ' brought my first two slices, was a sweetheart. I just don't remember her name. She was also the one that recommended the cannoli for dessert. Which was absolutely delightful. The best part is, this restaurant is  near my mother's house! It'll be systematic for me, to swing by, every time I'm near. What are you waiting for? Just take your butt to the restaurant already! Just to let you know, they have other classic Italian food on their menu, besides pizza. That'll be the next few items for me to devour! Yummy!!!",_VLJPIDqRMwtuF17Dcz-EQ,1,2,5,h072ldk7kvMKTseZR-831g

They also own Ventano's In Henderson as well, which we frequent quite often. Pizza is made to order so there was a bit of a wait, but worth it Pizza was hot and fresh with a wonderful this crust.

The people they have working there don't know what is going on, they are pretty useless if you ask them a question.  The first week they were open it was great but by the middle of May food quality and service had gone to hell.  It's now August and still no improvement.

Nice location and clean dining room is about the only good thing about Carmine's.
Disappointed in the food, lacked any flavor. Spinach stromboli was awful, bread tasted like cardboard, mixture of watery frozen spinach and mozzarella cheese filling. 
No joke, Little Caesars makes a better pie than this place. 
20 minute wait for food.. 5 minutes after receiving food, we were offered to go box. 
Overpriced, low quality. 
$7 for a tiny kid's pepperoni pizza.. didn't even include a drink.

**********

I am baffled on how this place has any good reviews. 

This place is right down the street from me, and I would rather drive across town to get quality food than come here again. 

Do you like sugar? Then this place is for you. Everything -sauce, pizza, RANCH DRESSING- tastes like it has a pound of sugar in it. When we voiced our displeasure, the waitress literally stood there and said ""I don't know what you want me to do.""

While this is true, she has no say in how things are made, she could have at least offered something else, especially when my 12 year old daughter didn't even touch her food. Spent $13 to toss it in the trash. 

Oh, and my sons pizza came out last, which is smart since it was scalding hot and he's 3. 

Even the calamari, breading and all, was chewy, which is odd for making it ""fresh"".

So the guy working there made us move because we weren't ""large party"". When he came back to get our order at the new table, I asked him what do you consider a ""large party"" he said ""5 people or more"" so my question for him was "" then why does that party of 4 get to sit in a larger table (just the same size as where I was sitting before)...he paused and got a little nervous and ""um..they've got someone else coming"". Howver where he sat me, there was an empty table beside me so if a ""large party"" came in he could've easily put the two tables together.
