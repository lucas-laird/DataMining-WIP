26255,2010-04-25,0,IyrDnrvUKpndj5zIv1KvGQ,"Dona Maria's is extremely over-rated.  They are located East of the strip in a seedy part of town- near the pawn shops and wedding chapels.  The restaurant is a hole in the wall with bars on the windows, but very large inside.  It has some charm and has been there since the 80's, but it's not especially clean and the booths are sticky.  Their chips and salsa were good (although the salsa tasted a bit like pizza sauce), their guacamole was more of a guacamole ""dip"" and had been watered down with sour cream- it had no flavor.  It was similar to what you would find at Roberto's or other low quality Mexican restaurants.  Their tamales come in pork, chicken, cheese, and a raisin desert variation.  I came here with my husband and my dad, we tried the chicken and cheese ones and none of us liked them.  They are extremely salty and flavorless, and actually some of the worst tamales I have ever had.  We all love Mexican food and have had lots of tamales, being from CA.  These do not compare.  I would skip this place in favor of almost any other Mexican joint.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,1,2,sCvq67yi_3p_AcXA-ZkLhw

Today I left the restaurant thinking why didn't I go to the new Farmer Boy restaurant instead. Everything seemed pretty average until I had to take my two young daughters to the restroom.........filthy! Mind you there are only two toilets and one was clogged, gross! ! It looked like a restroom in TJ! My husband ordered the Chile Verde and it had no spice and they must have been low on the meat. I ordered the grilled talapia, it was smothered in this green, garlicky disgusting cream. Fresh fish should not smell like fish and this didn't smell like fish, it smelled like sewer!! I'm sure that's why it was smothered in the green sauce. The refried beans had so much lard you couldn't taste the beans. I sent my dish back, i was not going to risk getting food poisoning.  My daughter ordered the pork tamales, she gave me a taste and the same thing with the beans pure lard, I told her not to eat anymore because she could get sick. Sure enough she spent the whole night throwing up. Never, never will I go back to that sewer in the wall.

I didn't have the tamales and all of the other reviews seem to emphasize how good these are.  So maybe these are what gives Tamales a 4-5 star opinion.  

I can say on my observation that:
1) the salsa tasted like spicy pizza sauce...very unimpressed. 
2) the food was nothing I haven't seen outside of any run-of-the-mill ""Mexican restaurant"" in the DC area.  
3) the place seemed to be very popular with the locals since the place was pretty full and everyone seemed like locals.  Our server was very nice.

I must say the food is almost as great as it was when the owners were cooking themselves. They have the best Tamales, Chile Relleno and green enchilada suiza around. The only downside is the dozen tamales price is rising faster than our economy's inflation. I remember when the dozen was 12.95 now its a whopping 21.95.

I ordered the the taco plate (two tacos, beans and rice) and my gf ordered the tamales plate. Now, the tamales were good, nothing bad to say about them, but the fish was discussing. First off, it was the blood line cut, so it was super fishy tasting (to fishy tasting to eat). Then they upcharged me 3 dollars for steak, but I had gotten fish? Mind you I did not eat more than one bite and left the rest of the fish tacos for them to pick up and throw away. So..They would not take the 3 dollar charge off when the fish taco on the menu was only 30 cents more than a shredded beef taco(what the plate was supposed to come with I guess). The waiter did not tell me it would cost any more money. So when they did not take it off, the owner/manager tried to lie his way into convincing me that his price was right. End the end I just laghed at him, had him charge me the 3 dollars and wrote on the receipt that was his tip.",peZAxPKaGQ-zRb7tmXClvw,0,1,1,9wjdFJKJF5-WDQPxMEbv7A

I ordered a chicken taco and chicken tamale that comes with rice and black beans. The rice and taco were good but the tamale was OK. I have had tamales before and they were much better then the one I ate here. I should point out the tacos are served in crunchy corn shell and not the soft corn shell which is a bit strange for an authentic Mexican restaurant. Like I mentioned their prices are a bit high especially for being away from the main action of the Vegas strip (it is located more near Freemont St).

Dona Maria's is the lovely green eyesore resting near a strip of wedding chapels in the downtown area.  It advertises itself as a Tamales restaurant, but features quite a bit more on the menu.

The best Tamales I've had were wealthy with flavor, prepared with love, and sturdy without being dry.  My excitement for Dona Maria's tamales was met with disappointment, because really they were nothing special.  

I had the Red and the Green tamales.  While both were alright, they lacked vivid flavor and reminded me of lots of Americanized Mexican cuisine in the valley:  good enough.  The flavors in each were a muddles mix of Mexican staples (onion, chili, paprika, etc..)  I wanted to love these tamales, but really wouldn't return for them. 

I also had the Enchiladas Mole.  The mole was rich without being chalky or powdery, suggesting it was made from scratch and not a prepackaged mix.  It tasted more of cocoa than the chiles, which for me was less than wonderful.  I like my mole to be both smoky, spicy, and rich with a touch of sweetness, and these were mostly sweet.  


I can't say that I had a bad meal, since the service was spot on, and the staff was friendly, but the food left a lot to be desired.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,5,2,3,Kb3x5B361GQPDDbsGJtfIQ

This visit was a Sunday morning when the restaurant had only a dozen or so people dining.  
I just want to start by stating to the servers of the city:  ""If you don't like your job, Nevada is an at-will employment state.  You can quit any time you like, and find other employment more suitable for your interest or skill sets.""  

On to the food.  The salsa and chips were fresh and tasty.  The guacamole was definitely not very impressive.  Was like creamed avocado dip.  No spice, very little acid, and just left me disappointed.  I enjoyed the ceviche tostada, although it was a little salty.  The red pork tamal was okay.

I usually hit Las Vegas for a beer fuelled weekend of fun twice a year. I think Las Vegas is a wonderful food city and love it for its many great pizza offerings. However, Dona Maria's Tamales is the one MUST for me on every Vegas trip.

I love Mexican food. And I really love Tamales when they are done properly. These are the best I have personally ever had. The chicken verde are my favourite, followed closely by the cheese. Homemade and always perfect.

The homemade salsa they serve with chips when you sit down is the greatest salsa I've had. I could drink that stuff by the pitcher. Seriously. I always have to hold back not filling up on chips and salsa before my Tamales arrive.

The staff here are always fantastic. Dona Maria's Tamales is always a chill hangout for us on a hectic Vegas weekend ... a place to unwind, eat great food and sip a few Victoria Cerveza or high octane margaritas before moving on to our next adventure.

Dona Maria's has good food and bad service. we get there and waited for a few minutes to be seated. We sat in the back, close to the kitchen. It was a group of 6. some ordered shrimp soup, steak and shrimp, I got the tamal chile relleno combo. Almost everything was good, but what I got. I just decided that I should not get chiles rellenos at a restaurant because even if they are good they will never be as good as my family's recipe so, and also the tamal was ..... how can I put it? big, lots of corn masa, lots of dry chicken breast with almost no sauce at all. I was surprised because they do have tamal on the name so I guess not doing justice to it. every tamal is priced at over $4, really??? I could get 3 better bigger tamales for that $$ at my usual spot (lol not Vegas I guess)

The menu was extensive, unorganized and repetitive.

The service was kinda bad. Two people in the party ordered dished that came with tortillas, well only one of us got the tortillas really late in the dinner and they were cold.

I usually opt for the Chile Verde burrito (a la cart) because I refuse to spend the 15-20 dollars they ask for -on most of their entrees. The burrito is simple -Chile Verde, onions and beans.  Don't get me wrong, the burrito is good - but not $10.00 good.

4. The menudo was extremely bland. The broth tasted like watered down ramen soup BEFORE you put the seasoning in. The actual tripe was very soggy. I may be wrong but I think this means they didn't cook it long enough? Either way, it's not the way I like it. You can get better menudo at Pepe's Tacos.

5. Are we having a lime shortage again? Not one lime seen, but lemons galore. In the menudo, the food, and the micheladas. No lime.  

6. The salad that is offered with your food was comical. Store-bought cheese and half a tomato placed on top (not even diced up).

The chips and salsa are good. I leave this restaurant with a full stomach of that. Unfortunately nothing else left a great impression and we will not be returning. For the prices this place offers, I would expect the food to be a lot better. Very disappointed.",zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,1,0,2,tGIXWNJo1JgMxlmSqs6yTA

I wanted to go in and sit down but unfortunatly my time was pressed & I got a Chicken Tamale to go. The price was kinda high at $4.15.....$2.75 would be more reasonable BUT it is what it is.

These are the best tamales you will ever taste.

Dona Maria's been hanging around downtown since 1980 on the corner of Charleston and Las Vegas Boulevard.  It's not the most visited of areas, especially for dining, and Dona Maria's has been here and packed for almost 30 years.  They recently opened another restaurant in Summerlin so you won't have to drive your nice car downtown (wasn't that sweet?)  The reason why it's done so well are the tamales.  They are out of this world.  They come in pork, chicken and cheese with expertly crafted sauces.

The chips and salsa were good. People on Yelp had said that. I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. The menu said 3 and there were only 2. The fish was very over cooked. There was supposed to be a mango salsa. I guess there were a few mangos there. There was so much mayonnaisey something on it that it ruined it. Just overall icky. It came with ""grilled"" veggies which were Birds Eye at best and not grilled. The rice was white with peas. Way too much butter. I only picked out the edible pieces of fish and left the rest on the plate. All that for $19.00. My husband ordered a steak and enchilada plate with green sauce on the enchilada. The steak was chewy and although there was green sauce on the enchilada there was red sauce inside. What? The waiter should have mentioned this. The Mexican rice was too tomatoey. He didn't even finish his food. Not once did the waiter come to our table after the food was brought. When another waiter came to take the plates he asked if I wanted a box. I said no. He didn't bother to ask if there was something wrong. I had planned to order a tamale to go just to try it based on the reviews. Honestly, by that time I just didn't care.

From the outside it doesn't look like much...a squat, dusty building with bars on the windows. Yet, considering that it's been around since 1980--practically Biblical times in Vegas years--you know it's probably pretty decent. 

I arrived for happy hour at 4:00, walking from the nearby bus stop. Other reviewers have (accurately) described the neighborhood as dicey, but it's perfectly fine in the afternoon. I ordered a jumbo lime margarita for $4.95 which was roughly the size of my head. It was far from a masterpiece, but certainly got the job done!

The chips & salsa were fair--chunky corn chips in a thick, fruity salsa. I followed up with a bean & cheese burrito. In addition to being one of my favorite dishes, it's a surprisingly reliable benchmark of quality. It arrived, somewhat alarmingly, in two minutes. The presentation was straight out of 1983, replete with the decorative lettuce and tomato garnish that inexplicably accompanies Mexican platters. It was fairly tasty--dripping with melted jack-- and I nibbled for about an hour as I emptied my glass. 

Apart from happy hour, it's not especially cheap. with a la carte lunch entrees in the $10 range and seafood dishes exceeding $17.

The balance of the menu is a little Gringoized for my taste.  Too many ingredients in the tacos.  Guacamole too creamy etc.  But the Pico de gallo chopped salsa is realy nice.  They put cinnamon in their carnitas which I dont like...but the carnitas were meaty and juicy none the less. Id give the restaurant as a whole four stars.  My problems are more with style than quality. The quality of everything I tried was uniformly high.

But the TAMALES are WORLD CLASS. ...and I know tamales.  Ive eaten them in four countries and know the styles.  These to me seem like Jalisco/Nayarit. (Mexico)

I ordered 12 dozen a day ahead and they made them up for me and froze them so I could drive them home to LA.  Now I'm set for Christmas Eve.  We always make some but since the average visitor to the casa Hollywood eats about 4....it's nice to have a backup supply of the good stuff.

My favorite way to eat them is ""a la comal""...meaning that they are steamed first (as always)...allowed to rest...and then crisped in a non stick pan.  You kind of squish them down in the pan so that more of the masa is in contact and then treat them like a pile of hash.  DONT ADD ANY OIL!!  The manteca comes out of the masa and allows everythign to get a little crispy.  You can start them in the pan with the corn husk still on and then sort of shake the tamale out ofthe husk once it heats up a little.  Then just squish it with your spatula and let it cook.  Hard to burn so High heat is ok.

I asked for them to be prepared this way as an appetizer in the restaurant and they did it for me.  I would skip the ""enchilada style"" thing they offer.  Tamales, like oysters, (and women), should be enjoyed with minimal additional complication.  The simple essential item is as good as it can be.

After transfer to a dish I like to drizzle mine (tamale I mean..;) with Blanca's smokey tomatillo/Chile Japonese salsa.  Increible.

I'm convinced that this is the way the Tamale was intended to be eaten.

Came here for breakfast before my flight home and enjoyed a variety of house specialties, ordered both their chicken and their pork tamales, the chile rellenos platter and made to order vanilla custard filled churros. The pork tamale was a bit dry and flavorless whereas the chicken variety was really wonderful and seasoned perfectly. So perfect that I had them pack up 3 more for my long plane ride back to the east coast! Vanessa my waitress was even so nice to take each of the Tamales out of their husk wrapping and gently placed them in a sealed foil wrapping before putting them in their styrofoam to go container so I wouldn't have any leakage issues.

The Chile rellenos platter was so delicious and filling, I could not stop eating it. A large poblano pepper stuffed with cheese then topped with more cheese, who can say no to that kind of deliciousness! They offer the usual plain Cinnamin sugar dusted churros and then they also offer one that is filled with rich sweet vanilla crème.

Not only did I waste my time but my gas and in case anyone forgot gas is $4 a gallon premium and I live in Henderson!

I mean they might seem expensive but wait till you see the size. Much bigger than what I normally see. Yes still expensive but if you can buy 6 or 12 you can carve the per tamale rate down. Not much for the salsa here as it is lacking in about every way possible. Almost seem like tomato sauce at best. Do ask for the green and hot sauces as they are quite a bit better but still nothing to brag about.

Pozole is similar to Menudo minus the tripe. It is a pork based soup or stew with hominy, chiles, garbanzo beans (traditionally), and other seasonings. Garnishes include cabbage or lettuce (cabbage is better), oregano, radish, cilantro, avocado, and lime juice. Most of the time I come here, I get the Pozole and a tamale or two.

I love the taste of history. Tamales are my all time favorite and I only like getting them from little Mexican woman that make them in their own home. 

This place is in a busy area. I always see the sign but the building is in a parking lot facing another building. So you really can't see it from the outside and was so hungry I don't even remember what it looked like out side. 

When we first walked in there was a bar that could seat maybe ten across and a beautiful  bartender who greeted and seated us the moment we walked in. Less than a minute later we had hot chips and salsa and had a waiter asking what we would like to drink. 

We already knew we were there for tamales. I loved that there menu had every Mexican food item you could think of with tamale. It's perfect for people that just wanna try it or wanna a little of both. We ordered chicken, pork, cheese, and desert tamale. With a side of rice and beans of course. 

While waiting for our tamales we adored the restaurant. It has pictures of Mexican families on the walls. The entire place felt very homey and family oriented. Even the little chip basket was cute. 

When the tamales arrived my eyes lit up. They looked delicious and they were. Hot and fresh. The cheese tamales were my favorite. The flavor of fresh cheese, corn, and tomato made a perfect combination. I was just as happy with the chicken. It was very juicy and a nice flavor. 

As much as I love meaty tamales the sweet ones are my favorite. I have had sweet corn and pineapple tamales. But never raisin pineapple. I was very excited. So excited I made sure I ordered two for myself incase I loved it. And I did. It was such a sweet flavor with the perfect amount of spice. They are not like other sweet tamales that are simply sweet, they have a hint of spice that makes you keep wanting more. Serious love.

They prefer the pork with red sauce, so I haven't had the opportunity to try the chicken with spicy green sauce or other variations. The masa is moist and delicious. The pork is succulent and flavorful with the great red sauce. Most importantly, the tamale is HUGE and there is no shortage of filling! It really is the winning combination for the best tamales.

I would highly recommend ordering a dozen for $19.25 (or $1.60/each) rather than paying $3.95 for one. They also offer an order of half a dozen for $14.25 ($2.38/each) which is still a better deal.

Upon ordering the soup, you get a condiment tray. It is a three tiered holder with cilantro at the top, lemon slices, and chili flakes at the bottom.

Nice decor and nice sizeable dining area, just past the bar upon entry.  We were seated near the kitchen/bussing area, which bothered the Mrs. Furniture could use an upgrade as the tables and chairs looked older. But I loved the Mexican decor and the place looked clean.

We went for the number one combo, two tamales, rice & beans.  Beans were very good, rice was moist (just the way I like it). Service was friendly, though we felt rushed by the older male waiter. Tamales were good but too much masa and cheese and not enough green chiles.  My wife didn't like the sweet tamales.  She did, however, like that they did not forget her to-go order, as some places do.  Points for that.  Also points for the delicioso salsa.

Another thing we liked was that they seemed to work as a team. We had three different people serve us, they didn't have separate stations and each server is on his/her own.

Negatives: $4.30 for a side of beans, $4.30 for a side of rice, $4+ for a tamale a la carte.  These same items are two-fifty in L.A.  I understand this is Vegas, but in this part of town?

So after my meal I had to make a little trip to the little boys' room.  Wouldn't you know, no toilet paper.  Who doesn't check and fill the paper roll before they open?  It was one of those rolls that has 10 feet of paper on it and I find the only one in Las Vegas that is out, at breakfast!!!   Fortunately, I checked before I did my business and improvised (I will not elaborate). I did let them know and they were polite about replacing it.

4960332,2010-05-12,0,IyrDnrvUKpndj5zIv1KvGQ,"This place is a fantastic Mexican restaurant, but it loses points for being in one of the worst parts of Vegas.

My parents have been bringing me to this restaurant since I was a baby, even back when they were in their old location on Charleston. As anyone who reads my reviews knows, I am not a huge Mexican food fan, but this place has amazing food. From chips and salsa right down to entrees that consist of a little bit of everything Mexican, I don't think I have ever eaten a bad meal here. It's difficult to recommend a particular item, but I doubt any fan of Mexican food will be disappointed.

The staff are also extremely friendly and courteous. Having gone here for years, my family is often recognized when we pay the place a visit. These are great folks, and they definitely treat their customers like family.

The atmosphere is average, though it does get a bit annoying when soccer games are going on on the TV, and people start cheering loudly. Also, for no apparent reason, there are tons of posters for old Las Vegas boxing matches on the wall. Not complaining or anything, I just thought it was a bit strange. 

The only thing that keeps me from giving this place a higher score is its location - the run-down, old end of the Strip. If you've ever watched Pawn Stars, this place is kitty corner from the pawn shop. There are always seedy characters down here, and it's common to have the homeless begging you for money. It's too bad the owners here can't borrow Antoine from the Pawn Shop to clear out the riff-raff that often fills the parking lot.

Still, despite its not-so-great location, Dona Maria's has some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. Come for the food, but do yourself a favor and come armed.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,2,1,4,1nVT0VJ5E7B4BSbsVpVRHw

 I love the coffee, a hint of cinnamon, tastes like Cancun coffee. It stays full, no matter how busy they get. I have never seen a wait, though the parking lot gets full.
 The area is sketchy, lock your car doors. However we have never had a problem. The traffic leaving is ok if you realize there is a rear exit. Otherwise plan on patience. The rear exit is a ONE WAY street, be careful.
 We used to go here weekly with my Grampa, it was bittersweet when they remembered us. He loved breakfasts, and started the Sunday morning tradition. Every family needs one, or you start to break apart. So, why not have Huevoes Rancheroes here, they are sublime. (I use that word when I want to feel pretentious. Heh)

The server washed out a horchata/lemonade pitcher in that very same sink--which you're not supposed to do. Those sinks are for hand washing only. I saw a busser bus tables then go cook on the line. Did he wash his hands or just wipe them on his extremely dirty apron. Seriously it looked like he was butchering meat. Unfortunately we were seated near the line where the servers pick up the food. They were horsing and joking around to the point we thought they had been drinking. It was really inappropriate. In keeping with the drunk theme, my server literally laughed at me when I ordered a cheese tamale. He apologized, maybe he was thinking of something else but it was really rude.

The tamales are large with a lot of meat ... we had pork, chicken, and beef, they were all good.  I can't tell you how many tamales I've had that were WAY to much masa for the amount of meat, these are not that.  Basically, they do taste like homemade, not like some uber-modern eatery that's doing all these things to them.  Service was good (not great), ambiance was good, etc.  Really liked the fact that you can order tamales a la carte, didn't want to fill up on rice and beans which are usually very mediocre.  Here's the deal with pricing ... if you order singles, they are $4.50 each (ouch).  If you order a half dozen, they are $3.00 each and for a full dozen, $2.00 each.  Since we had a large group, we ordered 18.  So if you can order more (to eat there or take home), you will save a LOT.

I don't understand a lot of the other reviews.  I lived 50 years in CA (Orange County, Bay Area, San Diego County) and RARELY found a good tamale there.  First, don't complain about salt.  A lot of people don't want or can't eat salt, so put your own f*cking salt on.  And the same goes for hot sauce.  A number of people in our group ordered very spicy hot sauce and put their own on, each to there own.  I don't like mine spicy.

The restaurant itself is great.  Hearing the tamales were awesome I ordered a basket of 6 for myself (the price was very reasonable), while my friends picked dishes off the menu.  I quickly realized that ordering 6 tamales was a mistake as I was full and satisfied after 2.  Tamales I've had in the past have almost always been short on filling and disappointing- not these.  They are almost entirely filling and are excellent.  My friends were both satisfied with their menu dishes saying they were quite good.  The service kept us happy by refilling our chips and salsa very quickly throughout.

Typically Mexican food will destroy my intestines, and as I was going to a strip club right after I was somewhat nervous about eating here first.  Luckily I had no stomach problems- a true Vegas miracle and testament to how fresh and well prepared Dona Maria's food really is.

5891137,2011-02-16,1,IyrDnrvUKpndj5zIv1KvGQ,"not good, not particularly bad either. the chips and salsa are pretty much the best part of the meal. The fideo soup is also OK. The tamales are actually decent although not mind blowing as several reviews have mentioned. The chicken soup is also OK, full of vegetables with a side of tortillas, enough for a complete meal. 

One thing I hate is the cooker's addiction to the microwave. Ever wonder why the plates are super hot when served? All cheese is grilled with the micro, which really sucks as it burns and dries the food. It also gives the impression that is not fresh. To be fair, the problem is common in most (if not all) the mexican food restaurant I've been in Vegas.

The place is OK for an office meal. Not for a family feast.  

I hate that every time I go the TV is tuned to soap operas. I mean, can we watch the news or at least NFL network???
