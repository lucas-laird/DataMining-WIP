22969,2015-06-09,0,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"I was very disappointed in this place.

The hostess & servers were lazy, and seemed very annoyed that I expected the service that I'm (over)paying for. For example, all of their booths were open, but the hostess acted like it was a huge inconvenience to seat me at one. 

I can't even count how many times I was sitting here needing something (like a refill on water, as they refused to give me a full-sized glass), watching my server Max stare slack-jawed at the TV as I tried to get his attention.

Bud light is $7. That's expensive even for Vegas. 

There was a screaming child and the staff did nothing to urge the parents to silence the little hellion.

I've never been to a restaurant that serves a burger without fries (except maybe McDonald's?), so I was a little taken aback. The seats were covered with crumbs, and thanks to their substandard sanitation, I ended up with a grease mark on the back of my pants.

The burger was great, but they got my order wrong on the first try.

Maybe they were just having an off day, but the place was dead, and there's no excuse for this kind of service (or lack thereof).

There are plenty of restaurants with employees that give a shit about their customers. Try one of them instead.",XYOYiru2ZYhzM4wL42u1Yg,0,0,2,I5L_zMVTiX_g_HGoaDXQxQ

I definitely don't recommend anyone to waste their money at this spot. I got the drive thru burger. It was ok... barely ok. For a $10.00 burger it wasn't very big or any distinctive taste. Ordered a side of fries, another $6, but understandable cause where we are. The fries came out with so much salt on them I could not even eat 1 fry. The waitress came over n asked because I had not touched the fries, n i had told her they were way too much salt on them. Her reply was: I'm so sorry, picked them up and left. Never to offer me a new batch or a refund...

124317,2014-01-02,4,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"Because Vegas didn't have quite enough celebrity-backed burger joints, the Venetian recently opened the tongue-twisting B&B Burger and Beer by Batali and Bastianich. This restaurant replaces the short lived and highly touted Rattlecan, which served some fantastic burgers and had a great interior. There was a lot of drama surrounding their early demise, but rumors flew around of the space not being what the Venetian wanted to display, and other odd things. That rumor is slightly hard to believe when you look at the atrocity of design close by that is the Bourbon Room, so who knows. Regardless, this duo provides some great meals in other locations within the property and throughout other parts of the country, so surely it would be a good replacement?

As I mentioned above, the interior of Rattlecan was great; custom graffiti everywhere, cool artwork, and a great bar made of skateboard decks. What has replaced it is a bright, boring, and poorly decorated space that feels much smaller than its predecessor and somehow way less inviting. The orange, yellow and red tones are horrible from the floors to the wall sconces, the tables look cheap, and the space overall just doesn't look like a burger joint that sells $14+ burgers. The muted wood tones in the clunky booth section bisecting the space as well as the dull back bar do nothing to spice up the environment, and the wavy ceiling feature made me feel like I was in a Denny's. Their menu is pretty simple; snacks, salads, shakes, burgers and heroes. The snacks and salads don't seem offer much, and the heroes sound more impressive than their small handful of burger choices.

With a recommendation by the waiter I went with the Royale with Cheese: robiola cheese, caramelized onions, grilled treviso and parmigiano-marscapone cream. What came out was a decent sized burger accompanied by an odd side of pickled carrots and onions. The bun was fresh, gooey, and well proportioned. The meat was really good; very fresh and juicy, just lacking any seasoning or flavor. The burger was very creamy, almost too much. The onions were barely noticeable aside from a couple bites, and the treviso wasn't strong enough of a flavor to be noticed, but good on its own when pulled out. Overall it was a very good burger; messy, creamy, juicy, all the things you'd want, but there was just that bit of beef flavor that was missing.

As for the fries, this is where the restaurant starts to piss me off. Spending $6 for a side of fries when you're already spending $31 on two burgers is just insulting, even on the strip. These on-Strip places need to remember that there is a huge local base of customers here to support them if the prices were even somewhat reasonable. This price is not. The fries themselves had good flavor, were of the thin, natural cut variety, but they were completely undercooked. You get a good sized portion that can be shared by two people, but spending that much for just one person on a bit of potatoes is stupid. For our two burgers and fries we spent $40 before tip, and that's just ridiculous. While they do offer up at least one decent burger, I wasn't crazy about the bite I had of the Really Good burger, I didn't really try much else. The slightly ridiculous prices combined with my longing for what used to occupy this space may not bring me back to try anything else.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,8,5,3,WIpEJ6Bo-FaWsrqEouB87A

148624,2014-01-29,0,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"Unfortunately, the B&B Burger & Beer is an absolute flop. If you look at all of the advertisement, you see a thick, hand formed burger patty on a sesame seed bun, quite appealing. THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY OFFER and for that Mario Batali should be absolutely ashamed of what he is doing. Talk about a ""bait and switch,"" I cannot believe his management team allows this. What IS served at B&B is an upscale Double-Double In/Out burger. Two THIN and flat burger patties are cooked on a grill, well seasoned, fresh bun and produce, etc. But what you get is just in the same family as any other fast food burger. Chocolate shake was outstanding, onion rings were fine, nice store, clean, great service. Here is the pisser, I ordered lunch for my brother and I, two burgers, one shake, one soda, two sides (slaw - rings) and my bill out the door was over $50 bucks. 

Absolutely over priced, false advertising in every sense, do not bother with this location. Tons of great burgers in Vegas, plenty of options inside the Venitian/Palazzo for a burger such as Legasse's Table 10 or his sports bar, or Grand Lux Cafe for lunch. Another location inside the Palazzo that serves an OUTSTANDING burger for lunch is Buddy V's, it is an Italian restaurant with great, great, hell, outstanding pasta, but man do they serve one hell of a burger.

Oh how I wish I didn't! First, I drink a lot a lot of water. And the water glass are so small that I would need it filled many times and I would have to wait or make sure to stare at my server until he realizes I need more water. 

Second, the server was seriously rushing us! We already knew what burger we wanted but not the sides. Once me and my boyfriend told the server what burger we wanted but still thinking between the sides, he asked if he can come back later at least 3 times! Why don't you recommend what's good instead of leaving in the middle of a food order? Of course right when we were done I noticed he jumped to another table (who sat down before us) to take an order.

Right when the food came and I had one bite of a side order of fries...the server asked me how my food was......ok whatever 


Third, My royal burger was super plain with no flavor but my boyfriend's was really tasty. He ordered the really good burger. The fries were half burnt and too thin, also no flavored or had a burnt flavor.

Dinner included:

  Fried Pickles - very good, batter was tasty, not soggy, and fried perfectly. Highly recommend if you like sweet pickles.
  Eggplant Parmesan Hero - we opted for a non-burger mainly because I love eggplant parmesan and wanted to see how Mario and Joe decided to prepare this sandwich.  I've eaten a few of these in my lifetime and would rate this as a pretty good rendition served on a ciabatta roll.  The eggplant was fried and not too greasy and there was just about the right amount of marinara sauce.  Nice and fresh buffalo mozzarella and the fresh basil pesto gave it a nice mellow taste.  I would order this hero again at this restaurant.     
  Side of Onion Rings - again, like the pickles, the onion rings were crispy and not soggy!
  Side of Slaw - had peanuts in it and dressed with a light dressing that wasn't overdone.

After taking the initial drink and food orders our waiter was nowhere to be found.  The few times he did come back he would ask one person at our table if they wanted a refill, then run off to get it before even giving any of the rest of us an opportunity to ask for anything else.  He also didn't check in on us very often.  It seemed like he was very flustered and easily distracted.  As soon as he got a new table he was off to attend to them and it seemed almost as if he forgot he had any others.

The food itself I would say was very average.  Burgers were cooked to order, and somewhat tasty, but I've definitely had much better...it was very mediocre and just didn't wow any of us.  They were also overpriced, even given that you are paying for the name.

There are definitely better burgers to be had in Vegas, and places with much better service.

The one good thing were the booze milkshakes. I had the cherry bourbon vanilla shake which was to die for! I might go back just for one of those in the future, but would probably go elsewhere for food.",IGIEEUlNVQSmbEnABXup2Q,0,0,2,Ka2kRbzk_rtmj6EFVRWxzw

420640,2017-04-04,0,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"Came here with the family for lunch. My dad was super excited to try B&B Burger & Beer as it's opened by Mario Batali and has been highly recommended by his friend. It was also super convenient that this restaurant was located in the Venetian, where we were staying, so it made for a quick meal. 

The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating. It was very sunny so we chose to sit inside. It took a while to get seated, which was quite odd, as there were barely any occupied tables indoors. The place is very casual with booths in the middle and separate tables surrounding with metal chairs and very bright walls. Nothing super fancy. 

Food::
Chicken Wings ($9): Mario's hot sauce
Morning After Burger ($15): Sauteed mushrooms, frisee, fontina cheese, sunny side egg, truffle aioli
Drive-Thru ($10): Two patties, American cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, mayo, mustard
Bottom Burner ($14): Pepper jack cheese, onion rings, japaneo pesto, Mario's hot sauce, mayo
Bison Caprese ($19): Tomato, mozzarella, romaine and basil, balsamic, ciabatta bread

Thoughts::
The wings were pretty meaty but for $9 for 5 wings, it was definitely not worth it.
There was just too many things going on in the morning after burger. Of course, burger places need to differentiate itself from others but sometimes perfecting a regular burger is better than adding in unnecessary extras! The flavors melded together (and not in a good way) to the point that I couldn't tell what I was eating anymore. The sauce dripping down from the mushrooms and the aioli, and the egg caused the bun to get all soggy and vey unappetizing after a while. Also, the burger was so big, I could barely get to try everything all at once. I resorted to eating it with a fork and knife because it just fell apart after a while. The frisee was an interesting touch to the burger though. The patties in the Drive-Thru and Bison were a little overdone and made it tough to chew when we had asked for them to be medium. 

Overpriced burgers with overcomplicated burgers. Given it is Vegas, prices are reasonable and probably on the cheaper end. However, I would go somewhere else. Service was lacking as it took a while to get the waitress's attention for the bill and the burger turned into such a soggy mess after a while that I couldn't even fully enjoy it.",by-tJ56fIfWjTJFivDxkAg,0,0,3,TqaHjVSs9_m3potPrWO6xg

Babbo, Lupa, Esca, Casa Mono, Tarry Lodge, Del Posto, Osteria Mozza, Pizzeria Mozza, Chi Spacca, Bar Jamon, Becco, Carnevino, OTTO Enoteca Pizzeria, B&B Ristorante, and the massive Eataly.  So when I heard they opened a casual burger and beer restaurant in Vegas, I had to try it.

Being lenten season, I gave up red meat, rice, and pork.  So no burger for me, but luckily, they do serve lobster roll.

I went on my last day in Vegas for lunch with my new found friends at the seminar that I was attending.  I ordered the lobster roll and nutella shake.

Both were wonderful!  The lobster was sweet and cooked perfectly, it has a nice coat of mayo but not overpowering.  The bread was great, nice light golden brown crisp on the outside and has a nice chew on the inside.  Perfect bread to lobster ratio.  Great in every single way.

The nutella was uber rich, not in a bad way but my goodness, this shake is pure awesomeness.  It was very hearty to say the least.  It just hit the spot.  wonderful shake!

Now with the food reviewed, let's talk about the restaurant itself.  It feels ""forced"".  I felt that they did not have to open a type of restaurant like this, it's stuff into a corner of the Venetian.  This is not the typical restaurant they open, it's too casual, to the point where the staff seems like fresh graduates from high school.  No service at all.  One of the diner had use one of the chairs to put all our bags into it, the manager asked us if he can take the chair back because they ""may"" use it.  The place was half empty, this itself is not typical B&B service.  The kid servers just stand there and talk to each other like it's high school once again.

When we asked for the bill, it took 22 minutes to get our bill and another 3 minutes to run the card.

I would skip this restaurant.  It's a polar opposite from my dinner at Carnevino.  Yes, totally different restaurant but service in any restaurant should be consistent, especially when they're own by the same group.",t_jRD8drPcr1AFfco4sOxw,0,0,3,9HOEJ2dB9jr9Kl6Q0MWmdg

I was surprised that the place was not busy at 12:45 PM.  I sat at the bar and ordered their Bar Burger (build your own), an order of fries and ice tea.  I mentioned my server that I don't want salt on the burger and fries.

It took 17 minutes before my lunch was served.  The burger was average.  I ordered it on a sesame seed bun with lettuce, tomato and added Provolone cheese.  The bun was not soft and chewy.  The lettuce was iceberg lettuce - no nutritional value to it.  A single slice of tomato - could not taste the tomato.  The burger was cooked medium instead of medium-well as I requested.

The fries had six to eight full length fries.  The rest were broken pieces of fries.  The fries were good and fresh.

The cost:

Bar Burger (burger, lettuce and tomato)  $10.00
Provolone Cheese (all cheeses on the menu) $2.00
Fries $2.00
Ice Tea approximately $3.00 

My total bill with tax was close to $23.00 Wow!

I would have been better off with convention food.

We told the waitress and she took away the roll and the manager came over. They did not bring us a new roll but instead gave us a free milkshake (which we didn't even want) the bill came and we mentioned something about taking the roll off since it was made incorrectly and we were never brought a new one. They wouldn't take it off the bill because they gave us a milkshake that we didn't even want. I can't believe Mario and Bastianich put their name on this place.

And, too bad, as the ambiance could have been upbeat and nice.  

The restaurant was empty when we walked in at 10pm and the hostess stated that we can only sit at the bar as the entire dining room, which closes at 1am was closed.  Shame on you Batali!!!

As for the food, it showed extremely well on the plate, nice presentation and looked appetizing (as you can see by the pictures I took of my meal); but that's where the meatfest honeymoon I was hoping to be on, stopped cold in its feet!

The burger patty was super thin and small for the advertised 6oz patty and versus the huge bun housing it - and it looks nothing remotely close to the oversized burger  and Batali advertising poster pointing to the place throughout the property, elevators and hallways.

I'd order the burger again but not the rings.

Full bar with a nice whiskey selection and some good craft beers to choose from.  What's not to like?

The service was quite good.  Our server was attentive but not intrusive and delivered a pleasant meal.

I got the Royale with Cheese and my husband got the Very Good Burger. The concern I have with burger menus is that the flavors tend to be the same. These were very different burgers. Mine had a mild flavor, his was much more umami and bolder flavors. Both were cooked a delicious medium rare and the seasoning was spot on.

We also got the onion rings. They were delicious. My loan complaint of the day was that they were just served with ketchup, rather than some house-made sauce. 

We also got two different shakes. I got the caramel swirl and he got the cherry bourbon shake. They were both phenomenal tasting and there was snafu for us to swap flavors and have almost two full shakes.

Their beer selection is more than adequate so I'm a little surprised by the select few on here that said it is lacking. A good mix of local, craft and international breweries on tap or in bottles. Typical Vegas prices around $8 a beer.

The wings had a decent buffalo sauce but since they are served lollipop style on a bed of blue cheese, they arrived a little colder than I'd like. I typical like ""flappers"" as opposed to legs so they weren't ideal.

The burger itself wasn't anything too special. The mushrooms were strong so that was the overbearing taste you get on this burger option. Probably needed some sort of strong sauce to cut into them a bit. Burger itself was cooked well but lacked much flavor.

This is a pricey joint and my $ or in this case $$$ are better spent elsewhere.",vIqv6Ocqb3j5QGF8TsZnEQ,0,0,3,LnkY0qU-dCZ4_TMrz1R_DQ

I went to carnevino the day before and was impressed but i was really blown away by the value for dollar at B&B Burger, not to mention the excellent service. 

I wasn't starving so I had the fried oysters, which were lightly coated in corn meal, I think. They were so light and crispy... An amazing preparation. I also got the chopped salad, which was similar to the one at Carne but was big enough for an entree.

Patrick made me a special gin creation, similar to an aviation but with his own touches. My only critique is that the signage to the restaurant from the casino floor is basically non-existent so.... I had to ask two people for directions to the restaurant.",0KueQxXgax9GlbZ0UNaGlg,5,5,5,SHdUFPRaRkyDsSZgsH78fg

Unfortunately,  I found the food here just ok. My burger was cooked the way I like it (medium rare), but was greasy and under seasoned. It also was cold, and I felt it sat at the counter too long. We shared the chips with blue cheese and bacon. The top 2 chips were delicious but after that, they were all a soggy mess. It was more like eating scalloped potatoes not chips! I complained to the waitress and she took them back and took them off my bill. My son was happy with his burger and said he would get again. 

The place is clean, and I like the bar with many flat screen TVs showing all the sports. The service was a bit slow, and the waitress seemed tired.

I had the Royale with Cheese (Robiola Cheese, Caramelized Onions, Grilled Treviso, Parmigiano-Mascarpone Cream).  I wasn't a big fan of the grilled treviso, and I thought the sesame bun didn't quite stand up to the quality of the meat & other ingredients.

at B&B i ordered the burger with the fried egg. it was a bit sloppy - fell apart too quickly and became a drowned out mess, but still quite tasty even after it lost its structural integrity. and the first few bites before the bun disintegrated were heaven. I would probably order the same without the mushrooms, as I suspect that those are the key culprit in the rapid deterioration of my bun (other than the burger juices and the runny egg yolk, neither of which i'm willing to eschew).

After sending off our friend who had an earlier flight, my best friend and I were famished. We packed our things, checked out and placed our luggage in hotel storage and had time to kill until our 9:30pm flight. The first order of business was FOOD. We were staying at The Venetian and decided on B&B Burger which honestly turned out to be one of our best decisions ever. 

From the moment that we stepped in, the ambiance was chill with the World Cup on multiple screens, the entire staff was friendly  and pleasant, and our server Marcus won us over. You know when you are so hungry that you can't think straight? ...That was us! But Marcus patiently worked with us, was very knowledgeable and attentive while answering all of our menu questions, made recommendations and was genuinely fun and comical to boot. 

At one point, when we inquired about the taste/consistency of one of the cheese options that was part of the BYOBurger section, Marcus even recruited help to get an accurate description for us (even though we ended up going with standard cheddar!) 

He absolutely went above and beyond, and, along with our food, was the most enjoyable part of our visit to B&B! I live in NYC - born and raised - where we are generally discerning and have unlimited access to all types of food, and I can honestly say that the buffalo wings, lobster roll and craft cheeseburger we had here at B&B were all delicious!

One night with a client I had the Really Good Burger cooked MED with an order of fries.

I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chips after seeing the fries. The replacement chips were way overseasoned. They were so salty they burned my taste buds. If it were not for the draft Stella...

Two nights later I was on the receiving end of a dinner out by one of my vendors. They wanted to go to B&B. Being a gracious guest, I kept quiet thinking I could just find something else to order than a burger or a fried potato side.

I ordered Crispy Cod sandwich and a lettuce wedge. The fish was greasey but it was hot, another 30 seconds of draining in the basket would have made it much better than bleeding the oil on the bottom of the sandwiches tarter sauce covered base. Again, it was OK, but for the price I would of expected something ... more.

We were seated. The restaurant was about a third full. Someone came and filled our water, but we still had no menus. We waited about 15 minutes and were just about to get up and leave when the guy came back and filled our water again. I asked him if he could find a waiter for us, who then finally came over.

Of  course, the waiter didn't bother to ask if we wanted anything else to drink, so all we had was water.

The burgers came after a CONSIDERABLE wait. While we were waiting, the table behind us got up and walked out, because like us, no one came to wait on them.

The burgers were OK. Pretty average, nothing special. I ordered medium, and it was medium-rare. My wife's was well done as ordered. The warm potato salad was very good. The highlight of the meal. The burgers were definitely not worth the $15 they charged. I would say it was more of a $7 burger. Not even close to the quality of what you get at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr in Planet Hollywood.

Waitstaff seemed out there -out of touch. The appetizer came bf our drinks. Appetizer-greasy fried pickles w mayo on the side. And within 2minutes (literally) the burgers came. We ordered a side of onion rings but were served old dried up French fries. Still waiting for our drinks. My Manhattan was served in a tall glass used for drinking ice water. I also ordered it neat and it came on the rocks. So the waiter drained the ice and put it back in the tall glass. I figured they didn't have the appropriate glass but when I was leaving I saw those cute vintage champagne glasses w drinks in them. Idk what happened to my drink. So the waiter then brought onion rings and told us to keep the fries. Really-they were so stale. I wonder how long they were siting there. Onion rings had a lot of batter and I had to searched for the onion and again-grease. You can have fried food without all that grease. It is possible, just not here.

 B&B Burger & Beer was a Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich venture. They had other jointly owned establishments in town, so this provided B&B with enhanced access to stellar ingredients. The beef was a prime example. The beef blend (50% Brisket and 50% Chuck) was ground and blended fresh daily onsite from hand-selected sides of beef from Niman Ranch. The beef was broken down, ground, and blended by the on-site butcher. Yes, these guys had a guy picking out the sides of beef for the burgers. Niman Ranch beef is 100% Angus, vegetarian diet, and no hormones/antibiotic free. The burgers came out at 6 ounces each. The Drive Thru was two 3-ounce patties, and my burger was a single 6-ounce patty. The beef was splendid. The flavor hit us in a rush of sear, beef, salt and pepper, complex mineral notes, and a little blood. The texture was firm and then creamy. The burger patty was perfectly juicy with no trace of oiliness. The beef resembled  Stracciatella cheese  in its complexity and delicate texture, but the beef brought a sledgehammer of flavor to the palate. This was one of those bites that made me smile and slow down as I savored eat bite. The Drive-Thru Burger was very similar to my Bar Burger, except that burger had twice the sear and twice the cheese. I will be getting that burger on my next visit. The beef was perfect.

B&B Burger & Beer is now on my list of top burgers in the country. It edged out the burgers at BurGR on the merit of the sear. This burger was on par with the spectacular cheeseburger at The Brindle Room in NYC. I found myself already missing the burger as took my last few bites. I am fortunate to live close enough to Las Vegas to repeat this experience.  FINE DINING ON A BUN.",wcfUv4PT00KXhN8pGGfaPA,3,1,5,3wdOS7Mj-NxBk6aBBrp7pA

Ambiance/Decor- 2/5. The decor was just alright, more like a food court or a very nice fast food restaurant rather than a celebrity chef restaurant.
Service- 4/5. Our server checked on us throughout our meal several times and was quite pleasant. She initially put in the order for the wrong burger but came out right away and apologized. The correct burger was a bit delayed, but we were prepared thanks to her quick catch and explanation.
Food- Here's where things get dicey...  I guess I'll go with 3/5
We started with the ""un-fried"" mozzarella. I did not really like this. It was not at all what we were expecting. It essentially was toasted bread with a tomato and mozzarella dipping sauce. The bread was burned in many places, and the sauce was mostly tomato. 
The fries... Not good. I'd have preferred fast-food fries, to be honest. Thin cut, salty, not remarkable, and not good.
 However, I really enjoyed my ""Morning After"" burger. The flavor of the meat was great, as was the egg on top. I also really liked the mushrooms. The only downside was that I wish there were just a tiny bit more sauce on it, as it got a bit dry as I ate it. The bread was soft and delicious as well.  
Nutella shake- pretty yummy! It was thick, creamy, and had Nutella sauce and little crumbles on top. They also gave us a shaker of the ""overflow"", so there was plenty to share.

One other note- there is another B&B Restaurant inside the Venetian, which made things confusing. This one is located near the sportsbook.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,3,2,3,6EfVVNDTx49DYstF2SY6oA

Located near the Venetian sports book in the old Rattlecan space, the decor is pure Batali and more befitting the Venetian that the former's graffiti adorned walls.

The service was ok, the burgers were mediocre, and the items were pricey. I ordered a Royale with Cheese medium well. It came out more rare than my friends who ordered different burgers medium rare. I pointed this out to the waitress and asked if they could throw it back on the grill for a few minutes. She seemed slightly annoyed that I was asking her and said that they would likely need to make the burger since there was already a bite taken out of it. I'm not sure how else you would find out that the burger wasn't cooked enough. When she came back, however, she was extremely apologetic and said they would re-make the burger right away. When it came back out it was cooked a perfect medium well. The flavor of the burger and the melty cheese was great. 

FYI, you have to pay extra for a side of fries. I split some with my fiancé and the side was enough for 2 to share. It should also be noted that if you are a vegetarian there aren't many options for you. Our friend ordered the eggplant parmesan and said it was great, but they don't have veggie burgers. 

I ordered a boozy shake for dessert, but wasn't impressed with the $12 price tag or the taste. I got the Caramel Swirl which was alright, but way too sweet so I only drank half of it. I prefer the boozy shakes at BLT across the street at Mirage.

We were told the would be a 5 minute wait to be seated outside. Sure, not a problem we say as we sip our water. 

About 10 minutes later we were advised that we could be seated outside and to head out. We were told to check in with the woman out there. So we went up and said we were told our table was ready. She, I kid you not, looked us up and down really nastily and then said there was a 5 minute wait. We advised that we already waited inside for our table. She repeated again that it was going to be at least a 5 minute wait. 

We look around and there's 4 tables that are free, clean and set for service. 

Asking her where we should wait she waved at the couches in the sun. 

Less than impressed much? I know! 

She then trots back 10 minutes later and says we have a table. Then says it's in the sun if that's ok. We say no its not. We want part shade. After waiting that long in the sun I needed a cool spot. Which ended up being another 5 minute wait. 

The food itself was ok, be warned however that my best friend got food poisoning from this meal, she had a burger (who knew you could stuff that up?). She's been up all night vomiting and had to go to the doctor today.

2725052,2013-12-25,1,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"For a while I was debating whether I should be giving this place 2 stars or 3. I originally had the intention of giving it a 3.5. All the stars for this place go to our server, Anthony who was very friendly, attentive, and helpful.

I came here for a late dinner with my sister and brother in law. We've been to other Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich restaurants and were very impressed so we had some pretty high expectations in B&B Burger & Beer. Unfortunately, my expectations were shot down.

First off, the decor is pretty casual. It's supposed to be a burger joint so it's simple. I personally think the location is a little too hidden. It's in the sports book area in The Venetian (as Mike C. has pointed out) a little past Noodle Asia. There was no line, and the two girls up front who were hostesses were friendly and helped get us seated right away.

I ordered the morning burger (minus the egg) along with a side of fries, my sister had a spicy burger of some sort, my brother in law ordered the pastrami, and we shared a side order of buffalo wings. Almost everything came highly recommended by Anthony, so our hungry stomachs waited excitedly for the food.

Coming from SoCal, I'm not sure if maybe I've just been spoiled senseless by the amount of gourmet burgers in the area (The Counter, Slaters 50/50, and Umami to name a few) but all three of us were very disappointed. 

The buffalo wings tasted hard and almost frozen. The sesame on my burger bun tasted too hard for the bread and to sum it up, the best word to describe it would probably be ""forgettable."" The pastrami was at best average, and my sister's burger was so overly spicy, she was barely able to eat it. 

The reason why I ended up giving this place 2 stars is because even though Anthony was attentive enough to note to the cook in the back that many customers during the day had complained it was overly spicy, management still did not do anything to make it better. He suggested we just write on the comment card at the end of the meal that we thought the burger was too spicy. There was no offer to make up for it and no attempt to please the customer.

I think B&B has some great potential, but considering it has just opened a little over a week ago, it's absolutely vital to be listening to its customers to make the experience more memorable and better, considering all the other competition for food choices on the Strip.",YkMCNI3nVukPL_PIztHZJw,3,0,2,nRv_5YwjFK-i17oNLceh5w

party of 11, they sat us altogether and it was not a hassle.  we made reservations, and b/c it's vegas, i'd recommend making a reservation no matter where you go.  

#1 these burgers were FANTASTIC.  honestly, i was MEH about the idea of burgers when a friend had made the reservations.  there is so much good food in vegas, why hit a burger joint in the venetian?  but i was happily surprised.  meat is juicy, fresh, and cooked exactly the way you order it.  the burgers are creative ,and not any more expensive than any other dedicated burger place - about $11-12 (except for in-n-out).  

i had the Bottom Burner, and it's called that b/c the expectation is that your bum is going to bleed and burn when this comes out the other end.  sounds yummy, right?  well, it was.  delicious burger, topped with a jalepeno pesto (basically jalepenos chopped up into tiny bits and smeared on there) topped with pepper jack cheese and a giant onion ring.  it was so tasty!

among our group, we basically got one of each burger, and everyone was super happy.  the appetizers were ok - they offer fried pickles and these are definitely worth trying.  fried oysters were also good.  

great drinks, large beer selection.  the Nutella milkshake is a heart attack in a glass but so worth it.  definitely share b/c it is a lot of milkshake.",XYDyktd9zsqPvJxxSTDxNw,4,2,4,4j7QIb46EDCf5DEqd_f6Eg

I've said it before and I'll say it again, the lobster roll here is AMAZING. That buttery New England bun is stuffed with flavorful and meaty chunks of lobster with small crispy pieces of bacon that gives it a nice crunch. Having this lobster roll again was excellent and passed overdue for the amount of visits I've had to Vegas over the last couple of years. Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich knocked it out of the park with this one. Its $21 and well worth it for the amount of lobster meat stuffed in the roll. I've paid equal amounts for other lobster rolls where some were good, some not so good. This one takes the crown and I haven't found one to top it.

If you haven't had the lobster roll here then you're missing out. Don't miss out on the burgers either, pretty good stuff...especially The Royale with cheese and The Bottom Burner.

I ordered the Morning After Burger and it was a pretty good however the truffle flavor in the aoli was kind of nonexistent and also the egg yolk was slightly overcooked. I will say though, this has been the best meat flavor in a burger on the strip I've tasted however I still am in love with the texture and thickness of Gordon Ramsey's BurGR. The size was nice and had good height as well. My boyfriend ordered the Really Good Burger and well, it was just an okay burger. The meat and toppings seemed to be a lot smaller than my burger! The bacon was a pretty measily portion however it had a cool sour taste to it that was different in a good way. Fries were nothing memorable. Now onto the eh. First thing I didn't really like was that there was something off with the hostess. Everything she was saying was friendly but she had a mad facial expression and was speaking reeeally loudly, almost yelling! Us and the older couple behind us looked at eachother and were kind of confused lmao Also all of the waiters and waitresses seemed really rushed and running all over the place even though it wasn't crowded at all.

5 stars for atmosphere and music. 
Ok, I will settle on 4 stars average. After trying Otto, I could not wait to seek out another B&B restaurant! I figured I've had almost every other ""celebrity chef burger"" why not try this one?
I randomly made a reservation since I had never been here. Happy I did, because it was super packed, and safe to say under staffed. They asked if we minded sitting on the patio, and the sun was down so we went for it. 
They have huge shades with misters and classic rock at the appropriate level. 
We were not getting much service at first. I actually went to the bar, and got my beer before my boyfriend received his from our server. I was totally disappointed in the bar service. No total quoted, no eye contact, just- ""here's your beer, thanks for the $20"" I was brought change but still nothing was ever said to me. 
I did like the beer, Brooklyn Lager though. 
We ordered fried pickles, the burner burger, and the drive thru burger. 
Off the top, I felt the similarity of Otto with the high quality ingredients. The meat was fresh and cooked to perfection. We also ordered a side of potato salad that had a creamy, sweet mustard style sauce. It was really unique and enjoyable. 
We ordered a cherry shake to-go and it was worth the $9 price tag. 
Overall, I could see the disorganization of the staff, people waiting, and lack of service. Even though we personally had a great server and were checked on by management, everyone did not seem so lucky. I will go here again hoping service improves.

I also had the Pickles: Fried and Not (fried pickles and pickeled veggies), the onion rings, and S&P Chips. The Chips were great, the onion rings were pretty good, I wasn't a fan of the fried pickles, they used bread and butter pickles not dill which was a disappointment to me.

All in all it was good, but not OMG great, it will blend into the stream of the never ending Burger Joints on the strip. I'm honestly a little bummed they closed Rattlecan and replaced it with this place. It'll have to ride the celebrity name on the door or it will end up getting lost.

I decided on the ""Really Good"" burger and I have to say, whoever named it needs a lesson in naming dishes. The burger wasn't ""really good."" The burger was UNBELIEVABLY FREAKIN' GOOD.

When I return home to DC, and someone asks me, ""hey, J Dog (that's what people call me), what's the best burger you've ever had?""

My response will not be of words, such temporary things. Rather, I shall point westward.

West, over the lands of our forefathers,
West, through rivers and mountains and plains.
West, past where the arid air grows hotter,
West, where the canyons and crags have names.

And they will see, in their mind's eye, a vision of a most majestic place. B&B Burger and Beef. And they shall weep. And I shall weep. Our tears of perfectly salted beef. And together we shall journey west.",o-0Ml9GmFJIdH8TuBCCyMw,0,0,5,4_RUoA6gK86FpwN1lJAOAg

My burger was gummy and rubbery my wives burger was okay she said nothing special. So we asked if they could just take one burger off our bill the one that I did not eat the whole thing the manager said no that it was not their policy so after going back and forth with her and explaining everything to her described above she finally took it off.

One positive is that it is very convenient to the Venetian poker room, and you can easily get take out here and bring it to your table while playing. That's actually why I went here. Otherwise, no reason to bother.

My second experience coming here was a disaster. My husband's order was completely wrong. The waiter took it back without a problem, but it took nearly 25mins for him to finally receive his burger after which I had already finished my meal. When they brought back his burger, it was incorrect once again! My husband didn't want to wait any longer at this point and ate it anyway. How could anyone get a burger done wrong-twice?! Is it really that difficult? In between waiting for the burger I asked an employee for extra napkins and he said sure. 10 mins later I see the employee walking out of the restaurant without ever bringing my napkins and completely ignored me. When I asked the waiter she just slammed the napkins on the table without saying a word and walked away. Umm..yeah, Don't be a waitress if your going to have an attitude, lady! 

My husband then asked to speak to a supervisor and she didn't want to comp us for the burger because all they could do was take out a lousy $3 off the bill. Seriously?! These employees are a joke!! 

After realizing we were going to get nowhere with these idiots we emailed who we had thought was the corporate office, we then get a call from another employee at B&B named Suda (general manager). We tried explaining to her our horrible experience and all she kept saying was ""I have very loyal employees"". So...what are you trying to say we're lying?! Of course my husband got frustrated knowing he wasn't going to get anywhere with her either he began to raise his voice a little bit and the bitch actually hung up on us!! Could this women be any more ghetto and unprofessional? She obviously doesn't have a clue on how to make her customers happy and satisfied. Apparently she puts her ""loyal employees"" first. We felt like we were dealing with McDonalds employees. Certainly not a restaurant owned by Joe B. Just pathetic.

This was one of two reasonably priced restaurants at the Venetian that we found.  (there may be more, we just didn't pass any on our walks through the hotel/casino.)  

The first time I was here, I had the eggplant sandwich. From my memory, I believe this was the only vegetarian item on the menu other than the side salads.  It was so good, with crispy fried eggplant and a touch of heat. The others got burgers and the meatball sub.  I wish they had a veggie burger because some of the burgers combinations looked delicious. The server asked if we wanted fries or onion rings with the burgers...note, these are not included and are an extra charge.  I tried the salt and pepper potato chips the first night and thought they were quite good. 

The second night I was here, I had the cod sandwich.  It seems everything here has heat to it, as the cod had a jalapeño spread on it.  I'm not complaining because I love spicy, but that might be a problem for others.  The bun was nice and buttery, and quite good.  However, I thought the eggplant was better.

However, my biggest qualm was the service. Probably the worst service I've had in a long time. I had to wave someone at the host desk even the host saw me waiting in front. She was too busy or whatnot to not ask me if I want to dine there. I had to yell out if I could get a table to get her attention. When we finally got seated after 15 minutes, there were plenty of empty tables to spare? We waited awhile for our server to order. Then one of the servers walked by our table and told us she made a mistake with another table and had an extra Morning After burger.

I was going to a show at the Venetian Theatre last night and I decided to give B&B Burger a go.  The place was almost empty.  I opted to sit at the bar where I could watch the basketball game while eating.

Omar, the barkeep, brought menus to me promptly and got my iced tea.  I ordered a morning after burger and an order of fries.  My iced tea was kept refilled during dinner and it was a pleasant place to sit and enjoy the food while watching the game.

In a short time, a runner brought my burger and fries.  It was cooked just the way I asked--rare.  The meat was red and I was pleased.  The morning after burger consists of a good sized burger with sautéed mushrooms, fontina cheese, a sunny side up egg, truffle aioli, and frisée.  The serving of fries was a standard size and they were good.  

Because of the sunny side up egg, I opted to eat the burger as if it were an open faced sandwich.  The last thing I wanted was dripping yolk on my clothes before a show.  The burger was juicy and the egg and fontina cheese added nicely to the flavor.

At the end of the meal, I asked about dessert.  Omar told me they had shakes.  Originally they did have desserts when the place opened, but they just didn't sell so they dropped them.  I opted to have a refill of my iced tea and I knew I could find somewhere else for my after dinner sugar fix.  Omar asked if I wanted the iced tea placed in a to go glass.  Nice touch and thoughtful service.

The restaurant is in a bit of an out of the way corner.  I think the target market are the poker players from the poker room next door and the race and sports bettors from across the hallway.

She told us that there was a huge group coming in and they already reserved a huge portion of the restaurant specifically where all their TVs were located. She offered the bar so we took it. 

Later, I looked over to see the big group seated in a corner of the restaurant. And random people sitting by the tables by the television I was hoping to get seated at. For some reason, I guess the hostess just didn't want to accommodate our request? Oh well.

The meat was shockingly tough and chewy, and simply wasn't juicy at all, while the bun was way, way too dense and the condiments were distractingly plentiful. Honestly this was one of the worst hamburgers I can remember eating.

Meanwhile my wife had asked for extra napkins and it was never brought over to us. When we had asked the waitress for it,she slammed them on the table without saying a word. 

When we received our bill, I asked if they were going to charge me for the burger my waitress said they never comp burgers. The waitress than said she would speak to the supervisor, Krissy. Krissy did not comp the burger and took off $3 from the burger. 

I strongly believe this service would not be acceptable to Joe B's standards. The staff was very unprofessional and they seemed very ""lazy"".

In other words, it's expensive and the portions aren't too big. It is also sort of slow. I had time to go to the bathroom, play a bunch of rounds of puzzles and dragons on my phone and sit idly for 5 minutes before the chicken wings came.

Anyways, the food tastes good, but probably is only worth half the price. I suppose it's an upcharge for some chef that owns this that I don't know, but I don't know, so that meant nothing to me. I was just hungry.

$9 chicken wings were really good with the sauce and tenderness but probably only $5 worth of meat in this

4113971,2014-09-02,0,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"It's hard to rate this burger joint with an unbiased mind because my favorite burger place of all time is also on the Vegas strip: Gordon Ramsey's BURGR at Planet Hollywood.

But that burger aside, this place was OK. Lots of great signature burgers to chose from with various unique toppings and condiments. Despite the choices, I went with the ""build your own"" option: burger, pretzel bun, avocado, bacon, lettuce, garlic aioli. You can't go wrong with that combination, but on this occasion it lacked some flavor; I ended up having to ask for more aioli. The pretzel bun was also not pretzel consistency; it really was more like a regular bun. It was good overall, but not amazing.

The fries were thin the way I like, but one of our two orders were overcooked and seemed like the stragglers at the end of a batch. Also, I absolutely hate when restaurants don't automatically give you fries (or a side) with your burger make you order them separate. This is especially ridiculous when the burgers are priced at $15 and higher.

The beer selection is great. I went with a Moscow mule and it was really good, served complete in a copper mug. My friend thought it was ""too gingery"" but I don't think he knew that's what ginger beer tastes like. Drinks were also unnecessarily pricey.

Our waiter was great: friendly, patient, helpful, gave suggestions, attentive.",y158lUTlxiUiqlkUIPgtng,0,0,3,_m0WnVjOH6AjKbu6QpzYYA

Plenty of great burger places in Vegas, so we opted out. The place has a very minimalist feel to it also.

Having been to other J & M restaurants, this place looks like a fast food burger joint on a budget. Odd for being in the Venetian hotel.

The bartender said we should try the fried pickles, so we decided to stay, at least to have the pickles. No need to go on about fried pickles. They were good, but we really wanted a burger. Lot's of other reviews here were so so on the burger, so maybe we made the right decision.

I invited my friend for lunch, and to take in some of the NCAA March madness at The Venetian. I asked him to meet me at B & B Burger at an outside table so we could watch the games. When ordering our food, I asked the waiter what the best side item was too have with our burgers. Granted they were all $7 or $9 for fries, onion rings, warm potato salads, etc. 

He recommended the onion rings with our selected burgers (the standard for me which was$9 and the Morning After which was $15 for my friend). Our waiter was happy to recommend the onion rings so we went with his suggestion. 

While we waited for our food, we requested water 3 times. We got our meal, but still did not get our water or napkin setup. I tried one of the onion rings and then another while trying to track our waiter down for what would be expected, napkins, silverware and a glass of water, on our table already. I turned to my friend and asked him if he tried the onion rings because they were decent. He said yes, and I asked him how many he had. He told me one. Low and behold, there were only 2 left in the basket! So that would make a total of  5 onion rings (see above on how much we paid for the ""basket""of onion rings). 

We asked our waiter, since he ""highly"" recommended the onion rings, if this was some sort of kitchen error. His reply was no - it wasn't a mistake, it only comes with 5 onion rings. We were disgusted. I felt like pouring the water we didn't yet have over his head...which might have spilled onto our dried out burgers to make them moist. Overall, poor service, very poor waiter recommendation, and below average food for the price - 2 burgers and 5 onion rings $35 not including the tip.

We had a beautiful view of the strip and cannel. The service was excellent and the food was even better. We ordered the Caesar salad, fried pickles and a burger. The Caesar salad had a spicy zing to it that set it apart from other salads. The fried pickles were light and airy and our burger was delicious! We felt that the price was very reasonable.

I got my chance to eat today at B&B Burger & Beer. Since my friend and I were catching a show at Palazzo, we decided to venture over to the Venetian for a quick bite prior to the show. We arrived sat and ate at the bar.

My friend and I decided to split a burger because we wanted to tryout a couple of appetizers from the menu, without getting too full to genuinely enjoy them. We ordered the following: The Drive-Thru burger, hot wings, and Dirty Chips with bacon n blue cheese. To drink we both had a glass of Flor Prosecco. 

The burger was juicy, of decent size and consisted of 2 beef patties, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo on a sesame seed bun.

The hot wings were succulent, bold and spicy. Great kick and the perfect amount of heat. Served with a side of creamy, chunky blue cheese dressing for dipping.

The Dirty Chips were crisp, mighty tasty and were topped with bacon bits and pieces of blue cheese chunks. Delish!!

I wanted to try one of Bastianich's wines, but I was not in the mood for a red wine. A chilled white wine was more of what I was craving, since it was a hot summer day. Unfortunately, the female bartender was of no help when I asked for a recommendation, as she kept mentioning red wines, when I was asking for white wines!! It was as if she was not paying attention to what I was asking her. That was very annoying!! I don't think she knew much about wines at all. 

We settled for Flor Prosecco, since it is chilled. A different bartender by the name Norberto took over and brought us our drinks. I am glad because he made up for what the female bartender lacked in service, knowledge and friendliness.

I plan on returning to B&B Burger&Beer. I want to try their Lobster roll, onion rings and one of their yummy sounding milkshakes. I also plan on finally trying out a glass of Bastianich wine. Thanks Mario Batali & Joe Bastianich (especially Joe...be still my beating heart) for the great gastronomic experience!! Until next time!",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,0,0,5,yWtHs2eTqJDRQaazAjHYVg

Food: This where surely the worst burger I have eaten in Las Vegas. The meat  patties were greasy and the fries were burned. The onions seemed to have been peeled only sloppily as I found some brown peels inside my burger. The cheese wasn't worth mentioning.

Service: mediocre and a bit shy. Food was served promptly though.

(My flight was so delayed that I didn't get to experience dinner the first night, but that's a different story!) Note that dinner in Vegas really means sometime after midnight, because after you get out of a show, walk the strip, go to a party, all indoors in a well-lit environment with clocks, you lose all sense of time until you're completely starving. I was the first one to proclaim starving-ness, and this was a good choice.

I had the flame burger, which no longer appears to be on the menu. It was a beef patty, jalapeno pesto, pepper jack, topped with an onion ring and hot sauce. I'm not a wimp when it comes to spicy food, but this was actually pretty spicy! I drank so much water that the busboy kept coming back to refill just my glass. I was too grateful to be embarrassed. The burger was large and was well cooked. It was a perfect medium and the bun was fluffy and light but nicely toasted. I also had a side of fries, which were the highlight of the meal- they were thin, crispy, salty, and well-cooked.

My companions also ordered sandwiches- one got a burger (it had a fried egg on it) and the other got a lobster roll. Everyone devoured their food in companionable silence, so it's safe to assume we all liked it!

I found the prices to be on the high side for the food ($15-16 for a burger, plus $7 for fries), but I think it's still considered a lower end restaurant on the strip. Vegas is not exactly a budget destination.",nDzAPj3zvzcltAmqg17csQ,0,0,4,Y6YQk54WKsNCO3rj2Ec5Qw

Although I very much enjoyed my burger (the bottom burner), the restaurant did have a few issues. For example, why is alternate/hard rock music constantly playing in the background and why is it so loud? 

From reading the description, the bottom burner had my name all over it: jalapeño pesto, pepper jack cheese, onion rings, and hot sauce. How could I not love it? (Although it doesn't list it, the default is to put mayo on the burger so make sure to mention leaving it off if you don't want any.) The burger had a lot heat to it that really snuck up on me after a few bites, which was great. It was well-cooked and a bit on the greasy side but very different and worth getting. 

It's a little upsetting the burgers don't come with sides but we got some fries and onion rings anyway cause how could you not? I enjoyed the onion rings a lot as they were on the thinner and crispier side. Also, they were nice enough to prepare a special batch to accommodate a food allergy of ours. The French fries were initially super disappointing: lukewarm and salty. We asked for a fresher batch and they were much better, although still only average fries sadly. 

It's not a cheap burger place by any means and the sides are a tad disappointing but the service was friendly and accommodative, and if the bottom burner sounds like something that interests you, stop and get it for sure.",GWOf1oB2mTalRY_A-EjSiQ,0,0,3,JvTO9RJPXkifSMjncMtWKw

In town with my wife for the week celebrating our 15th anniversary, so we are staying at the Venetian for the first time because of the celebrity chefs represented here.  We wanted to try some on-property locations on our first night.  We were immediately seated as there were many empty tables available.  Our server (Shane) said that he would have someone else helping for training.  Service was average.

The menu is a bit limited in my opinion, but there is a create-your-own option (Bar Burger) that has a lot of customizations.  My wife had the Drive-Thru Burger with a side of fries.  I ordered a Bar Burger on pretzel bun with provolone, caramelized onions, and garlic aioli, with a side of onion rings.  My wife's burger was very salty, and the ""fresh cut"" fries were so salty that they were nearly inedible.  my wife likened her burger to ""a Steak & Shake burger.""  My burger was tasty, but the onions were on the bottom and made the bottom part of the bun disintegrate so that I had to eat half with a fork.  The one thing that probably needed salt the most (onion rings) had none and there was none on the table.  The garlic aioli was easily the highlight of my meal.

There was a table of four near us that was being very loud and disturbing.  They ran one couple out of the restaurant, and we had to hurry through our meal because it was very annoying.  The waiters continued to serve these people more alcohol.  We told the hostess on the way out that she might want to consider not seating people back there until the obnoxious patrons left.

Seriously disappointed in this experience, as we've been looking forward to this trip and the opportunity to try the restaurants here for weeks.  We expected better from a celebrity chef restaurant with $16 burgers.  Unfortunately we will not be back on this trip or any other.",XiO2G6mXut5pOy8dpPpmVw,0,0,2,vWj-sAX4gjjsYIrER5paEw

The thin patties at B&B were done to perfection.  Literally, I have no idea how they cooked these this well.  The thing about thin patties is you don't want to cook them too much that aren't juicy, but you need to cook them long enough that they get the delicious crispy ends.  Well, B&B managed to leave this burger pink in the middle, thus ensuring maximum juiciness, while getting the crispy edges that make thin patties so good.  Very impressive.  

Wrapping the whole thing in butcher paper allows the cheese to properly melt, and sort of crams all the flavors together.  I have found my burger at B&B for future visits.  The fact that this thing is only $9 is amazing, especially when you consider the price of comparably sized burgers at enormous fast food chains is only about $3 less.  Get to B&B and try this burger, unless you hate things that are delicious.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,4,2,5,iWlq-Xy0IkRmzMRohiOElg

This signature Batali orange restaurant is nothing to write home about.  I had the Morning After which is a mushroom burger with an egg.

Here, I can sit in a cold, silver, metal chair and listen to Alanis Morisette.  I gotta say my waiter looked fit so that is pleasing.  It wasn't pleasing when he kept asking me how the food was when my mouth was full of burger.  I guess he knew it wasn't that great.

How does it stack up?  Accepting that Hubert Keller's Burger Bar with it's selection of top grade beef and well prepared, gourmet toppings is the supreme high end burger and Bachi Burger at the other extreme for delicious creativity, B&B Burger fits right in the middle.  (Sorry, clowns and kings don't even count as food in this burger arena).

Breaking it down, the burgers are firm and juicy, with a good blend of different cuts of beef, aggressively seasoned, cooked to temperature with a good outer sear.  Small selection of well made toppings (sautéed mushrooms, fried egg, avocado, caramelized onion), decent selection of cheeses, great sauces (jalapeno pesto, balsamic mustard, Chianti mustard, garlic aioli, truffle aioli).

Order as a ""build your own"" or from preconceived selections that feature ""The Drive-Thru"" (take on In-n-Out's burger, griddled patties with processed American cheese on a sesame bun in a paper wrapper)  slumming it on the Strip or a great ""Morning After"" (sautéed mushrooms, Fontana, egg, truffle aioli and frisee) AKA Midwest heart attack.  Both are good eats, classic, comforting.

A selection of Heroes for the non burger eaters.  The crispy cod is very good.  Deep fried, crisp, moist cod with a refreshing slaw and spicy jalapeno tartar.

OK sides.  Chips crisp and flavorful, onion rings, sweet with a crisp coating, fried pickles good acid but excessive coating makes them oily.

Service not perfect but Strip friendly.  Well chosen selection of craft beers.  Vegas resort pricing.

My wife had the Cosmo and I had a Moscow Mule for $14.00. She ordered the Lobster roll for $21.00 and said it was the best one she's ever had. Plenty of Lobster chunks and not too much filler. The roll was perfectly toasted.

I had the steak sandwich for $15.00 and it was very reasonable. Plenty of shaved steak and the bread was different for a steak and cheese. Sort of a french roll but very good.

5123026,2014-06-12,2,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"This new high class burger joint phenomena composed of slapping a celebrity chef name to the front of the establishment exists because it is a pure profit machine.

-You don't need expensive ingredients beyond the small amount of high quality meat.
-You don't need to hire any chefs with accolades
-It attracts business because people want to say they experienced a creation by ""...."" without spending $150/person.

...and what you get is a good burger at 600% markup and fries at 1000% markup.

I had The Morning After:
Sautéed mushrooms, fontina, sunny side egg, truffle aioli, frisée $15

The meat itself was high quality and it came out a perfect medium rare as requested...I didn't really taste the fontina nor the truffle aioli since the egg ran all over the place. Also the meat to bun ratio sucked.

End of day, I'd take the taste and value of the $6.99 Mushroom Truffle Swiss over at Smashburger rather than buy another one of these $15 jobs.

The fries were $6 and were better than McDonald's...but about the same size portion.

2 burgers and one shared french fry came to over $40 with tip.

Briefly known as Rattlecan and subsequently rebranded to another Celebrity Chef spot in late 2013 when Mario Batali and partner Joe Bastianich launched B&B Burgers & Beer, there is little doubt that the odd corner near the Venetian Poker Room and Sports Book remains a marketing challenge no matter how big the name on the signage, ongoing construction in the vicinity and outdoor temperatures topping 105°F making the idea of a visit even more of a chore.

Best accessed from the outside patio, a pleasant view of the Gondolas with some seclusion from Strip traffic a bonus compared to other eateries jutting out onto Las Vegas Boulevard, B&B Burgers & Beer is not to be confused with B&B Ristorante located along Restaurant Row connecting The Venetian to The Palazzo, price points far lower with a stripped down orange decor and a vibe far more casual.

Still marching to the beat of Chef Batali's drum, the music intentionally a touch too loud as muted screens displayed The 2016 Olympic Games, it was just past 2pm that way was made to the hostess podium, reservations quickly confirmed with a smile and the young lady beckoning ""right this way."" 

Faulted by some for the steel barstools, other qualms raised about a lack of desserts plus a menu that seems resistant to change, it was at a booth large enough for eight that seating was selected during the Restaurant's off-hour, a brief look at the menu showing prices for most sandwiches to range $12-20 with Appetizers hovering in the upper-single digits along with four types of Shakes.

Higher priced than some places, though not any different from a spot like Holsteins or Gordon Ramsay Burgr, it was with an eye on Sandwiches moreso than seared Beef that the visit was focused upon, a total of three far more than one should attempt to eat in one sitting, a single selection actually a substantial lunch for one when paired with an appetizer, salad or side.

Described at length by the Server and Chef, Batali's dedication to product sourcing evidenced by House-cured Pastrami, Line-caught Cod, Imported Cheeses, and Organic Produce on Fresh Baked Breads, the tasting began with a handful of crispy fries with a coarse-salt adding an extra bit of crunch, a follow-up bite of the Eggplant Parmigiano showing the lightly grilled rounds perfectly complimented by melty Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce and aromatic Pesto atop Carnevino's signature Ciabatta, still one of Las Vegas' best breads whether topped as it is here or liberally slathered with Lardo.

Having heard that the Lobster Roll would soon be making an exit and instead turning to the Fish Sandwich for a seafood fix, suffice it to say that the fresh Atlantic Cod finds a new level beneath Jalapeno Tartar nestled into a Bun rich with Sesame Seeds, the fatty cuts of Black and Green Peppercorn Pastrami subjectively better than that remembered from World-Famous Langer's in Los Angeles on Rye Bread with a light touch of house-ground Mustard and particularly pungent Swiss Cheese.

Drinking bottled water with most of the meal, but surely not planning to leave without a Shake, fans of Nutella will be happy to know that the Italian Hazelnut Spread is so thick amidst Vanilla Gelato that a spoon is a far better tool than a straw for its consumption, the boozed up Amarena Cherry a slightly more sipable option, though no less creamy in its constitution with several whole cherries to be discovered at the bottom.

****Doing what Batali & Bastianch have done at Carnevino or New York's Casa Mono, taking something outside their traditional scope of ""Italian"" food and nonetheless crafting a unique experience featuring memorable food, B&B Burgers & Beer warrants no less acclaim than its Strip-based bretheren, though return visits may indeed be limited by a menu that has not changed much in over thirty months and a disappointing lack of desserts.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,6,4,mx4caGNTu38aej1IxVrzXA

5319767,2014-01-15,2,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"I've been wanting to go here since they first opened. Nutella milkshake, helloooo? Why would I not want to go here? So, my friend and I went here. It's located by sports book inside the Venetian. This is different from B&B Ristorante in front of Delmonico.

I knew exactly what I wanted to try before I even went. My friend and I have been talking about having a wine date night so, we got a bottle of Pinot Grigio instead of getting beer with our burgers. I got a morning after burger, fries with truffle aioli on the side and Nutella milkshake.

Morning After Burger:
Frisee, truffle aioli, sauteed mushrooms, fontina topped with a sunny side egg. I got mine medium-rare as usual. They serve 50/50 which makes the thick patty soooo flavorful you can eat it by itself. I had to eat this with a knife and fork - it was thick and messy but oh so good. 4.5/5

Fries:
Hot and crisp. They were fine on their own and maybe a bit of ketchup. 4/5

Truffle Aioli:
I got an extra side of truffle aioli for my fries. I've never had truffle aioli I didn't like - well, I have now. I couldn't taste truffle at all. It was just like dipping fries into plain mayo. I was rather disappointed. 2/5

Nutella Milkshake:
Vanilla gelato, Nutella, whippe cream and candied hazelnuts. This was my main motivation for coming here. There's another Nutella milkshake version at Burger Bar but they use chocolate ice cream so, there's a difference in flavor and consistency. I like both. The candied hazelnuts was a nice touch. You get a crunch on your milkshake. The shake isn't too thick. So, sucking on it wasn't a problem. 4/5

The service was fantastic. Our server gave my friend suggestions, answered all our questions and always with a smile on her face. She told us all the items on their menu are made locally daily (like the pastrami) and the beef for the burgers are also ground fresh daily. Our wine and water glasses were never empty.

They have sandwiches that all sound good. Pastrami, steak, crispy cod, lobster roll, eggplant parm, meatball, etc. I'll have to try those next time.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,7,4,0tZDZaHNNyoF9n7brjpQ6A

B&B Burger and Beer could be a 4-star restaurant, but the cleanliness factor drops the rating down a bit.  There were lots of food crumbs under our table, specks of who knows what on my silverware, my seat was wet after being wiped down that I had to ask for a napkin to wipe it dry, and there was a used toothpick on one of the bar high tops where we were sitting at while waiting for our table.   

While cleanliness was a let-down, the food, however, was pretty good.  I had the Your Way Bar Burger and basically built a bacon cheeseburger which I really liked, and for my side, I had some onion rings which I enjoyed as well.  The ranch dressing I requested on the side, though, not so good.  The onion rings were better by themselves.  For my drink, I had the Caramel Swirl Shake, which came with a tin container with an extra serving.  That was pretty good too.  

I requested to sit outside on the patio when I made my reservation.  It was too cold to seat people out there though, they said, so we were instead seated at a table for two inside.  Bummer - the view looks nice out from their patio!  

Service was fine, but maybe too fast if that's even possible?!  Our check was placed on the table and my dining companion didn't even realize it :p  They were busy but there were definitely some empty tables, so if there was a rush to get us out I don't get it.  

Food was good and service was okay, but just need to improve on cleanliness.  Overall, an okay place!",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,0,0,3,qmYGQm6oLHt7Mb4-eFmeaA
5434561,2016-05-06,4,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"Going against the grain of the Yelp star rating, we trusted more that the names on the restaurant sign would assure us that we would have a good experience. Overall, everything was just OK and we expected a bit more. The burgers were good, the beer selection is above average, the service was less than what we hoped.

We started off on the wrong foot when our party of 6 arrived on time for our 5:30 reservation via Open Table and were seated in a large booth. With the way the sun was coming in through the room, I was literally blinded and couldn't see a foot in front of me. I didn't feel like wearing sun glasses throughout the meal so we requested another booth. Our server gave us the neighboring booth (although 90% of the other tables were open) that had yet to be bused from the previous party. She then told us to stand and wait at the hostess area. We stood there waiting with our table in plain sight with not a single soul including the hostess, our server, or any sort of management attempting to clean the table for ten minutes. The bus person appeared out of nowhere and finished the two minute job. The lack of teamwork and lack of any sense of urgency with patrons standing and waiting for an extended period of time didn't score any extra points.

Appetizers ordered were the fried pickles and the pork parts. The pork belly in the appetizer was probably the best thing we had in our meal. We had to rush though because our burgers were brought no more than 5 minutes after we received the appetizers. Burgers ordered were the Royale with Cheese, The Drive Thru, and I had The Really Good. I don't mind the strong flavor of Gorgonzola, but this blue cheese combined with the chianti mustard gave the burger a really strong, powerful bite that overwhelmed the beef. It's good if you like those strong flavors, but I think I should have chose a hoppier beer aside from my Brooklyn Brown Ale to tone down the flavor. I think an IPA might have paired better.

Everyone else finished their burgers with no major complaints and everyone passed on dessert, which are just milkshakes, except my brother who ordered a bourbon cherry shake. Total price for the meal was $160 before tip. I can name about three or four other places on the Strip that I'd stop for a burger before I came back here.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,7,6,3,t5RbRtaPvDQJgSkwoFrxlA

5464815,2014-01-08,0,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"The burgers were great!  The service was subpar.

This place has only been open one month so there are obvious wrinkles to iron out and that is totally understandable.  My boyfriend and I ""built"" our burgers and they came out great.  They were perfect size, not to big, not to small.  Cooked to temp.  The meat tasted very good and you can tell it was not previously frozen (and it is Angus ++++).  I had the pretzel bread bun and I could have eaten it plain without a hamburger on it, it was that good.  Obviously, my boyfriend enjoyed his because by the time I had finished my first bite his entire burger was nearly gone!
We sat at the bar as we often do when we eat out and the service was ""okay"".  Just minor things because the staff is still unsure on how to work with the kitchen (modifications, returns, firing time).  It is likely this will improve over time.
The decor in my opinion is not pleasurable, the color is very ""Batali"" if you know Mario.  It is very ""Mario"" orange.  
We also ordered the onion rings and they were very, very salty.  Under the impression that they were salted after coming out of the frier we asked to return them and get then without salt (this was an example when the bartender was obviously unsure about how the kitchen would react).  The rings came back out after a few minutes and they were alittle better, it seems the batter is just salty.  If you are not crazy about salty foods as we are, I don't suggest the onion rings.

Not exactly the case but the guys behind one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas definitely know beef.  So a visit here was inevitable despite the mixed reviews.

Before B&B burger opened, Batali himself said ""The food will be easier to accept if you've never heard of me.""  Everyone comes to expect so much with his name on the front.  

My verdict: a damn good burger!  We ordered what most reviewers got and also what the servers recommended.  The ""Morning After"" was everything I want in a good burger.  The patty was a very juicy medium rare.  The egg on top looked and tasted so perfect upon my first bite which then turned into a beautiful mess of yolk everywhere.  The bun itself was excellent with a kind of croissant quality to it.  I was only able to notice it after eating part of the bun separately though.  The royale with cheese was also very good and my wife preferred this more with all its caramelized onion glory.

It sounded like a reasonable competitor v. Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, but that would appear to be wrong.  Our crew ordered a burger each, and one of our 4-some wanted to get a lobster roll to share (it's a tiny thing and makes 4 very little pieces).

The burgers just weren't good enough to meet the expectation from reading through the menu.  If you see ""jalapeno"" and ""Mario's hot sauce"" you'd expect some heat... nope; swing and a miss.  One of our group gave up after going through half his burger.  The lobster roll was a soggy mess... I could not detect the bacon and the sweetness came from the mayo concoction, not the lobster meat.

The plates are plain as can be, with a tiny dollop of pickled veggies to give the left hand side of the rectangular plate some color.

5675473,2014-07-21,1,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"B&B Burger & Beer really seems to have mixed reviews, so I was cautiously optimistic about dining here.


I made my reservation on Open Table for 8:30pm on a Friday night. I wasn't sure where the restaurant was located, and the map on the Venetian website was not helpful at all.  Luckily, I saw someone mention that it's near the poker room and sports book. I parked in the self parking garage and just followed the signs towards the poker room. Although my friends were given bad directions by a security guard and ended up at the other B&B. The hostess was very friendly and offered to either seat us inside or on the patio. I thought it might still be too hot to sit outside, but she mentioned that they have misters and suggested that we walk out there to see if I wouldn't mind it.  It ended up being very comfortable out there (although I would suggest more misters).

The patio was great! I would much rather eat out there than inside (although the inside decor was cute). The tables are basically just off Las Vegas Blvd, on the outdoor canal. So you can watch the gondolas go by (and hear singing gondoliers) while you eat.  It was a great atmosphere.

I've noticed that most of the negative reviews are based upon 2 things: bad service and the prices. It's a Strip restaurant, so complaining about the prices is futile.  In the grand scheme of burgers, they are overpriced, but I don't think they are really ripping anyone off here.  They are using higher quality ingredients and cooking everything to order, so I am willing to pay $15 for a burger.

Our server was great! I definitely have no complaints there.  And it seemed as if they are honestly trying to improve on their service, because one of the Managers was walking around, delivering drinks and refilling waters. In fact, when we ordered beers, they came out quickly.

Now for the food! We all ordered something different (not intentionally). We started out with fried pickles. They were good, but nothing remarkable. I did like the spicy pickled veggies that they were served with (like a taco shop). I had the Royale with Cheese, medium rare. It wasn't as cheesy as I expected, but it was definitely delicious.  I could immediately taste the quality of the meat, which had awesome flavor. It was on the small (ish) side, but I still felt satisfied.  My friends got the following:

Lobster roll - she enjoyed it, but I thought it looked disappointing and nothing like what you would get in Boston.  It seemed like it was all bun and not enough lobster. This is the most expensive item on the menu ($21), and I wouldn't order it.

The Bottom Burner - I tasted this and it was really good.  This is likely what I would order next time. I love spicy stuff and Mario's hot sauce is a nice complement to the jalapeno pesto and pepper jack cheese.  She ordered this medium well, and it came out a little over cooked, although our server recommended she order it this way because she doesn't like pink meat. After she saw my burger, she wished she would've ordered it med-rare as well.

We all shared a side of fries and a side of onion rings. Both were good, especially the onion rings. They also had a pretty decent beer selection, which also included some local beers.  It was $9 for a Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA, which is really reasonable on the Strip.

Overall, it was a great dinner. We were seeing a show and I was a bit worried that we would be delayed, but everything was smooth. I am surprised to see people saying that the food was flavorless and horrible, that couldn't be further from the truth.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,6,3,4,PQ_S6rpKUUuY43NwX1vOYQ

I ordered the Chicken Heroes Sandwich, served on a pretzel roll. The chicken itself was fine but the bread was overpowering! I love my carbs; however the bread was very dry and on the verge of becoming stale. Normally I don't really pay attention to plating, but this sandwich was served on a very long plate, and it just looked lonely and weird.

Service was friendly and earnest enough, but very choppy, and the staff was clearly inexperienced. Also, this is a casual joint, so I thought it was very strange when they served our food in unison - out of nowhere 3 servers stepped up up to our table and it was like this awkward orchestration of serving our food. i've only seen this done in more formal dining settings, and it just doesn't really jive with the whole beer and burger vibe.

Service was good here and our food came out super quick. I got the drive thru burger, which is 2 patties with some stuff on it. It was cooked exactly the way I wanted and was very filling.The fries were super yummy, too

I honestly don't remember what beer we had here, but they had a pretty good selection.

Price on the food seemed reasonable, the beers not so much. But it's Vegas and was pretty in line with Vegas prices.

They had a ton of TV's in there and playing the game, which was nice. It would be a good place to go sit and watch some football.",vJU7VP831iKtwdwdD49MWw,1,1,4,pP1ToGGHI1koEZi_AoVf9g

We ordered the loaded fries, and they were awesome! Literally loaded with sour cream, bacon, cheese, and chives. 

My boyfriend built his own burger and got the potato bun, pickle peppers, bacon, pepper jack cheese,tomatoes, onion lettuce, and chianti mustard and said it was on of the best burgers he's had.  

I ordered the grilled chicken sammie, which came on a ciabatta bun (which is my fav), bacon, avocado, mayo, lettuce, and tomato. The chicken was really juicy and tasty.

The fries were each one inch long n seemed like they were left over bits from the bottom of the fry basket.. Horrible.. The onion rings were very greasy. This place is a no go.. Pls stay away..

5816275,2014-02-05,0,GZONBn0K1yp2aaD-l8debQ,"Really?? This is Batali's take on gourmet burgers? Before I rail on the burger, let's give some love to the things that were solid. Nutella milk shake that my buddy had was simply outstanding! The Beer selection is solid, with enough craft beer on tap and by the bottle to pair with any of the burgers. The fried pickles and the sauce for dipping was also a table favorite. Now when it comes to what should have been the star of the show, the burger,  disappointment abounded at our table. The menu does offer what should be some appealing options but when they arrived the were really more akin to a Carls Jr $6 burger than a $15 gourmet burger. Nothing special on the patty and the bun frankly looked like something they had gotten from the bakery section at the local supermarket. If they were not pricey it would not be a big deal, but with the name on the door you expect big things and B&B simply doesn't deliver. I live in Southern California, home to some of the best gourmet burgers in the country. If this place opened there it wouldn't last 6 months.

B&B is a burger restaurant with a beer garden.  A fairly decent selection of craft beers, but I came here for the burgers.  And a solid burger, it delivers!

They have a handful of burgers and I opted for ""The Morning After"" since I have an affinity for egg on my burger.  Who doesn't love egg on their burger?!

Good burger overall.  Patty cooked to order.  Well possibly a tad rarer but that is fine with me just don't overcook it!  Good meaty flavor in the patty.  But the truffle aioli was the clincher and tied everything together!  All the different parts worked together wonderfully!  Just ask my stomach!

My only complaint?  The patty was smaller than my liking.  Only a 6oz patty...  For me, an 8 - 9 oz patty packs the right-sized punch of flavor.

Good burger but still not worth a repeat visit anytime soon with many burger options in Vegas.
