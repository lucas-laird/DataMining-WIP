The best thing to order and I often do, get the steak special because they do have the best steak deal in las vegas for $6.99. The value is there and so is the service, excellent service all the time in Jackson's. 

I suggest the steak deal because it's a lot of food for a little price. :-) 

Also good, mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, and most of there daily specials are reaaaaly good like chicken alfredo, meatball sub, stuffed porf chops and many soups. 

Hollar and look for the Villain on Tuesdays if you do stop by.....

For my entree both times I've ordered the ribeye. The first time was the 16 ounce and with a baked potato. The second time was the 10-ounce with mashed potatoes and gravy. Each steak was Juicy and flavorful! The mashed potatoes and gravy and baked potato were done right...by my stands. Each came with steamed broccoli.

I am a night owl so I love places that are 24 hours and when I went into this place and I met the graveyard bartender billy that was it it was over. Billy is the only bartender I've ever met that created a drink with me and everytime I walk in starts making it without even asking me he knows exactly what I want and how to give it to me. 

I went in there on Monday and it was about 1 a.m. Then we decided to order food we ask the chef Lonnie if he had any  prime rib left he said no he chopped it all up to make pot roast at midnight but he did say Billy one big piece. 

Billy notified us that since we are so awesome he would let us have his giant enormous piece of prime rib this prime rib was bigger than my face it was huge and it looked so amazing. 

I have never had a bad experience in this place its like home it's right across the street from my house and even the nights that I go in there without Billy it's still a good time but I purposefully going on between Monday and Thursday between midnight and 8 a.m. Just to see my favorite bartender Billy",gugUpNPEyl54jCNc3kBlWQ,3,2,5,EVPij5yAAVSHjJNtmtoDwQ

It was never truly good, unless you don't know steak--the meat is always clotted with gristle and the fat rarely rendered. Expect a quarter of that pound of steak to be inedible, or be disappointed. They do season very well, however.

I'm sure this place would be better if you were a little drunk--it is a bar, after all--but I don't drink so I always felt the full brunt of the disappointment. The last time I went, which is the last time I'll ever go, they kept me waiting for a full 20 minutes past when I was supposed to pick my order up, repeatedly promising it would be right out instead of just honestly telling me that they messed up and would have to redo it. That, plus the usual box of gristle, plus the price increases put me off them for good. 

For the best, actually. Now I buy a gristle-free ribeye for cheaper from Smith's and cook it better than Jackson's ever has. Someday soon I'll have the seasoning down, too.",xRH9Q2QiUTp_6he1pEYT5A,2,1,2,sKPsw4XN_GiutRKEMqdytQ

I'm usually not too cool with local places because of the smoke but since the Vegas smoking ban went into effect there's a noticeable difference. Jackson's is clean and light and the opposite of a dingy joint. The owner, Brian, poured us a drink and told us about how he bought the place a couple of years ago and named it after his newly born nephew. And since they have slot machines I assumed it was named after the money but not so. It's a friendly atmosphere and we hung out and watched some football games on the bunches of TV's in the place. After winning a few bucks at the slots, we sat for lunch in the dining room. It was typical ""bar"" fare with a twist - Not everything was deep-fried! Salads, sandwiches, pizzas, all freshly made-to-order. I enjoyed my french dip and the wife liked her caesar salad. Big portions and reasonable prices. Freindly staff.

I finally read enough positive reviews to go in and take a look. First let me say that the only reason I took off one star is that this is mostly a bar that often has a lot of smoke when you enter. However, they do have a non-smoking section in back.

I've had the ribeye special many times and it's always been great. It is heavily seasoned and you can request ""light seasoning"" or ""no seasoning"" if you prefer it that way. The ribeye special is well-known around town. They also have a prime rib special and it's good, too. Plenty of other good burgers and salads to choose from, too.

This place is reasonably priced and has great servers. Check it out!

Ambiance is standard sports bar, but the service is great and the kitchen is fast. This is a meat and potatoes kinda place. You're not going to find anything fancy, but if you're looking for really good food at reasonable prices, you can't go wrong with Jackson's.

1420399,2014-02-25,5,iAu8s96GKQ73Xe7j_2GyCQ,"The $12 Monday night Prime Rib special will pull you in. Don't believe the hype.

BF is a huge prime rib fan, and when I stumbled across this place i thought I'd struck gold and found a Monday night that fit our schedules to bring him in for a surprise date night. And my carefully-laid plans bombed.

Placed his order for the prime rib special with mashed potatoes, bummed to hear it does not come with a vegetable despite many mentions in other reviews and pictures here of a veggie side. Waitress told us a side would set us back $2- for bar veggies? No thanks. My order was for the 10oz NY, which did come with a veggie, mashed potatoes as a side as well. Both of us added on a side salad for $1 extra, with bleu cheese dressing.

Now, if the first element of your meal is a side salad, and you are unable to finish it, that's probably a bad sign. The salad itself was fine and decently fresh but the dressing had seen better days- it neither smelled nor tasted like and bleu cheese dressing I've ever had in my life, and we couldn't put our finger on whether it was supposed to be a yogurt-based ranch dressing, or if it was spoiled.
Waitress cleared our still-full salad bowls in confusion, and when we mentioned that the dressing was off/funky, all she had to say was, ""Well it came straight from the bottle."" Um, then maybe check the expiration date on that bottle.

Then our entrees were brought out. BF's rare prime rib was medium rare only in the middle, and easily 1/3rd of it was fat while another 1/3rd of it appeared to be brown in color and possibly spoiled.  It tasted like more of a roast than any prime rib I've ever had.
My steak also had a good 1/3rd of the meat consisting of fat, and not even just around the edges of the steak itself but globs of fat within the middle of the steak- very, very low quality meat. I know my expectations for bar food are low, but come on ...

For a $30 meal, we literally ate about 1/5 of his prime rib (we were put off by the rest of it), and maybe 2/3rd of my steak, plus the broccoli and potatoes. Not really the value it's advertised as.
On top of that, we barely made it to the car before our stomachs started hurting.

To end on a positive note, our waitress was super friendly and sweet, though I'm a little perturbed that she didn't offer a solution or even begin to address the quality issues with our meal. That being said, she's a server and not a manager or in charge of who is selected as a supplier, so she's not really the one to discuss those matters with any way. Considering we had maybe five bites of our salads, I expected them to be removed from our bill- even if it was only a measley $2.

Only redeeming factor of our meal was the beer my BF ordered- it was a JW Dundee Nut Brown Ale and it was delicious.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,3,2,2uj1vX30XTa9Pf9c7Rd5xA

The house salad was all white iceburg lettuce and 2 grape tomatoes and a couple of cucumber slices with the skin on and the flesh was starting to go mushy.

2013495,2017-10-16,1,iAu8s96GKQ73Xe7j_2GyCQ,"This is a review 4 years overdue. This is partially due my selfishly wanting to keep this place to myself and my feeling overwhelmed in truly doing this place justice. 

When my husband and I first moved to Vegas, Jackson's was one of the first ""local"" places we visited. With my husband starting grad school, our budget was limited. Jackson's quickly became our weekly treat; allowing us both a steak dinner with sides for around $60 (tax and tip included). Back then, the steak special included a 10 oz NY or a 16 oz ribeye. That has since changed to a choice of a 10 oz or 16 oz ribeye. The prices have gone up slightly since, but not drastically. $16 for a 16 oz ribeye with 2 sides sounds like a deal to me. 

PRO TIPS:

1. The difference between the 10oz and the 16oz is the rib cap. I LOVE ME SOME RIB CAP so I always order the 16oz if I'm going with steak for my meal. 

2. Prime Rib special on Mondays. Do yourself this favor and try it once. 

3. The burgers are made of ground ribeye. I've made my way through all of them and there is not one that I wouldn't order again. 

4. Check the specials board for the daily entree, daily soup, and dessert selections

5. The deep fried turkey available for order for Thanksgiving is DELICIOUS AF. It was well received by many of my non-turkey loving family members. 

6. We've only ever sat in the dining are in the back (open to those under 21). However, there is a gaming area and bar in the front that is age restricted (duh). 

7. You can go double veg or double salad for your sides if you, like me, are ever watching your carbs. I go back and forth on the sides because their fries, loaded baked potato, and onion rings are fantastic. 

8. Clam chowder, tomato bisque, lobster bisque, and broccoli cheddar are my favorite soups. The clam chowder is SO clammy! 

Over the last four years living here, we've had waves where we've eaten there weekly (or twice a week) before we hit a dry spell. But what's so great is that every time we come back, we always find the same Jackson's. I know that my food will be delicious and reasonably priced and that the staff will always be welcoming and wonderful. Without planning it, Jackson's has become ""our usual spot"" . It is often requested by friends visiting from out of town as a ""must-go"" while they're in Vegas. My in-laws have even adopted it as ""their spot"" since they moved here from Tampa.

I really wanted to like this place, but the overall vibe of the experiences made it so it was just the opposite.....I'll give you the brief run down of the experiences

Visit #1- Bartender barely greeted me and reluctantly fulfilled my drink order as if i was pulling her away from texting on her phone. No personality just the usual miserable ""i don't want to be here as an employee"" vibe. I figured that was because i wasn't one of her regulars who waste away in there everyday. Ordered food from Frank who was upbeat and accommodating. The sandwich i had was amazing....STRIKE 1 for poor bar service

Visit #2- Liked the food i had on visit 1 so much that i had to have another, this one to go....Frank who handles food orders was again friendly and upbeat. Bartender was as miserable and inattentive as the first visit. Food order wasn't as good and they forgot the fried jalapenos for my sandwich- STRIKE 2.

Visit #3- This was the worst- i came in on Tuesday night (4-24) with my wife and had a few drinks, dropped a larger amount money in their machines and wife ordered a burger. This same Bartender (Later found out her name is ""Teah Heath"") barely greets us with her usual miserable show of apathy. Fast Forward to the end where we noticed we were overcharged by 1 drink which wasn't a big deal, its $5... we don't get trashed so we know what we had...but when we brought this to ""Teah""  & she told my wife ""oh whatever, you had at least four"" and proceeded to argue with her about it while i sat there looking in disbelief....I've never seen my wife that angry at someone treating her in such a manner, and after my wife walked out of the bar this poor excuse of a bartender tells me ""I don't want her to come back here"" of my wife. Well ....I guess she doesn't have to worry because we both don't want to come back to bar that has such a surly and condescending amateur ""bartender"". We didn't give her any reason to react that way, her unprofessional behavior was clear to see at that point.

I hope Teah enjoyed her $0 tip, because we truly felt she was an amateur and not a professional by any means.

If you aren't already a ""regular"" stay far away from this place. I doubt they care if you come or not anyway...they don't even care enough about their brand to fix their neon signs out front that for weeks had simply said ""JACK""....We went up the road to another bar with a touch more class and professionalism and had a great time. 

Teah: I think you really need a career change, your comment about ""I wish everyone would order quickly like that so i don't have to deal with them"" speaks volumes about how disgruntled you really could be and i do feel bad for you and even pity you.

I'm a big fan of prime rib and trust me I've been eating prime rib at different place for a long time. So far nice been to Lowry, Ellis Island Casino restaurant, And many other places. But I'm going to be honest and say that out of all the places I've eaten prime rib Jackson is my favorite. For only 12 bucks I get an inch thick prime rib. The prime rib was very soft and juicy. And it's not tough like most prime rib I've eaten at. I would highly recommend this place.

2306215,2014-07-17,3,iAu8s96GKQ73Xe7j_2GyCQ,"It says it's been 19 days since I wrote my last review. That's the longest I've done that in a while.  Let's see if I still know how to do this.

Ah Jackson's Bar and Grill. I've always known of Jackson's, pass it all the time but never went. It's your typical neighborhood bar/restaurant. The food ain't fancy or amazing but it's good for what it is.  This is a Packers bar so when it's the NFL season you know what's up. Solid 3.25 stars.

I had a serious craving for a steak and remembered Roger T. talking about the 16 oz rib eye deal here. Well after I got here I was hit by a dilemma, it was a Monday and there was also a 16 oz prime rib deal. Hmm do I have the 16 oz prime rib for $11.99 or the 16 oz rib eye for $12.99 how about both!?

I already had my mind set on the rib eye before coming here so I had to get it. For the price the rib eye wasn't that bad. I ordered a medium well and got more well done but I had no complaints there other then it being a little tough. I still ate it. It still taste good enough to get again. It came with some brussel sprouts and a baked potato, which were both kind of meh. It's a pretty good deal for a steak meal offered 24/7. I also ordered a lobster bisque soup, kinda too salty but edible. 

Another Monday I was craving steak again and said PRIME RIB. It was OK again kind of overcooked and dry had to really use the au jus for it but it satisfied my craving for meat that day. They actually ran out and I  had gotten the last one, it was barely 5:30pm on prime rib special night. Prime rib is offered pretty much everywhere in town. I wouldn't say I was a fan of the prime rib but I'd eat it again maybe ask for it more rare.

The rest of menu ain't that bad. There's more meat dishes, it has ""Grill"" in it's name, sandwiches, burgers, breakfast, etc. What stands out besides the 16 oz prime rib and 16 oz rib eye has to also be the 20 oz ham and eggs for $9.99, the 1 lbs rib eye and eggs, and whatever they had on the 24/7 menu, which I may come back for. 

The staff is friendly but they seemed understaffed.  It's been pretty busy both times I was there. There's a bar area which can hold decent number of people, a separate restaurant area which can hold more people, and another area away from the bar where there's a 82 inch TV and a comfortable chair right in front which I fell asleep in after eating two 16 oz meals each time I was here. Real chill place with a pretty good 2 pitchers of PBR for $10 deal offered 24/7.

Once you enter, the wall is covered with paintings of money and names of the important people whose faces are on the American notes (money)! Very cool concept and this bar is a GREENBAY PACKERS bar. If you are a Packers fan, this place is for you! The only thing on their wall is PACKERS and everything gold & green!

A very chill bar with great selection of beers and drinks! It is very open and there are plenty of room to sit. Of course, there are slot machines up at the bar, a few arcade games and two open spaces where you can eat. There is an open place where there are many tables and chairs to sit to watch any sports in front of their 60+"" television screen and if you want a more quiet place to eat and just talk with friends, there is also a room where you can sit and relax that is quiet and doesn't have a television.

I tried some of their foods and the service is great and food came out fast!

Buffalo Chicken Wings- typical chicken wings.. could have used more sauce, though!

Chips, Salsa & Guacamole- the guacamole tasted a little off, but the chips and salsa were good. I wouldn't order it again, though.

Even her husband in the bar always asked if we needed anything. Very sweet couple. Now let's talk about the food..... OM*G THAT RIB EYE 16oz STEAK is one of the most tasteful and perfect steak I've ever had in my life. My boyfriend is a meat lover and he doesn't let anyone cook his red meat bc he is very picky but this ribeye steak blew of his mind. I even told him the onion rings were the best ones I've ever had in my life. Now I was suprised my bf actually ate his broccoli. He loved it. My bf only eats veggies when he is prepping for a show. But this man ate it like it was French fries lol. Honestly we are planning to come back and hopefully we get to see this amazing couple again.,fAzjIZbqK8w-Jb2ByAGuHg,0,0,5,zwerZaqunHF0dXOUxUtP3w

So much so, that I wanted to introduce my girlfriends to it and have one of their birthday parties there. I called ahead of time. I asked to sit in Tammy's station, she always takes care of me when I come in, she has the right attitude and is very customer friendly. Which is another reason why I found this place to be appealing. I was told 'NO' Tammy is not a server she is a busser.... which left me confused, they have one girl taking the order and Tammy running the food and drinks for the most part, when Im there. I was VERY disappointed they wouldn't let Tammy take care of our party last night, what happen to customer satisfaction? I think my request should have been honored just because she does it all anyway, so someone writes my order on a piece of paper and inputs it into the computer, does that make you a server? Our server was just OK last night. She did go M.I.A a couple of times, when drinks were needed and order needed to be taken. Tammy kept our drinks rolling, which was the MAJORITY cost of our bill. Our server never came to even ask us if we were ready to order. We waited 15 min to order our food, one of the girls actually had to shout out we are ready to order now. In the end the girls all loved their food and left a fat tip, thinking it was meant for Tammy, not the other girl. I hope Tammy got at least half. Girls also thought Tammy was more deserving of it than the other girl. We will be back but next time with a party of 25 or more from our meet up group, last night was a trial run.

As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.

If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.

As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sautéed onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.

My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.

Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed ""Non Smoking"" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.

So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,34,23,4,FPFK15EP_xyBBLM2GGw_Xw

I just had lunch here and was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very friendly, the beer was good, and although it took a while for the food to arrive -- it definitely cured my munchies. I don't necessarily go into a bar with a massive appetite. 

As most bars, the lighting is dim, there are poker machines invading bar space, and there's usually a few other things to keep you ""occupied"". I didn't really get the chance to scope the entire place because I was only there for a quick lunch, but I could see a dart board and a big screen tv for the football fans. 

FYI : IF YOU ARE NOT A GREEN BAY PACKERS FAN, GTFO! This place has Packers memorabilia left  and right! It'd definitely be the place to come if you ARE a huge fan, as you'd probably make it in very well with the owner as well as many others! 

The bartender was very nice! I didn't catch her name, but she had a very welcoming vibe and carried herself very well. The girl that took our food order was also pleasant and seemed very customer/service oriented.  
My friend and I weren't all too hungry, so we decided to split an order of nachos. It took about 20 mins to receive them, but that didn't bother us too much -- we were busy catching up. 

The portion was as expected, big & shareable, yet they weren't the best nachos ever. Loads of cheese, salsa on the side(?) And sour cream in a little packet (similar to ketchup packets) which was strange. Another thing I found strange was we'd ordered nachos with chicken....but got nachos with ground beef AND chicken. Hmm. Nachos, ground beef, cheese, a couple chunks of chicken, salsa on the side and sour cream in a packet. Omitted the jalepenos. For $10.95.

I can deal with quiet. Sat there for 10 minutes of the first half game against Detroit today and not once got acknowledged. The one star goes to the customer who saw me sending up and decided to offer me a chair from his table. I paid it forward and gave my chair to another guy who was standing up around the area where I was. That same guy chased me down to give me my wallet since I dropped it as I hurried out to catch the rest of the game elsewhere. I can oversee a lot of things in bad service and think of myself as a pretty easy going guy but to receive no kind of acknowledgement really sucks.

Their Bloody Mary's are really tasty and reasonable as well - It's hard to find a better deal than a $4 pint-sized Bloody Mary.

The bartender was very pleasant and I decided to order the 16oz Prime rib to go. The waitress who took my order was LISA. LISA was amazing and suggested I order the prime rib cooked (medium) as a more thoroughly cooked prime rib tended to be very dry. I also ordered the mashed potatoes with gravy and brussel sprouts. The prime rib was flavorful and HEAVENLY. The mashed potatoes melted in my mouth and I've never tasted brussel sprouts so full of flavor with a consistency that almost didn't require chewing. Kudos to Jackson's! The overall ambiance of the establishment along with the separate dining area was quite comforting. I suggest you stop in and bring all your family and friends.

So if you're looking for a dinner for a very decent price and is off strip with a local flare (smoky, gaming environment), go to Jackson's Bar and Grill. I was passing by this place with my friend whose name is Jackson. He wanted to go in,so we did and we were glad we did. The food was pretty good. Our steaks were perfectly cooked, chicken strips were so plentiful that two people could share the dinner and even take some home. I would definitely go for the steak.

3167484,2014-05-04,2,iAu8s96GKQ73Xe7j_2GyCQ,"I can't say I normally go out of my way for bar food, but after hearing good things, I bookmarked Jackson's and knew I had to check it out. This bar is located on the NE corner of Flamingo & Jones and has a nice locals feel to it. They have quite a few TV's inside for watching games and if you happen to be a Cheesehead like me, they're a Packers bar too!

Now, if you happen to be coming in here for food only, they do have a separate dining area. As other have mentioned though, there is absolutely no barriers between it and the bar itself. In fact, most of the booths are within feet of where people are smoking. We sat in one of the booths and it was actually a bit overwhelming. It sucks leaving somewhere and smelling like smoke for quite a while afterwards.

As far as the food goes, they have a pretty extensive menu and even serve breakfast all day. Of course since it's a great deal, we decided on a couple ribeyes. For just $12.99, you can get either a ribeye dinner with a side of your choice or go the breakfast route, which is the same 16oz cut, but with 2 eggs and a side of toast. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare but the wifey's was a bit undercooked for her liking. Both were extremely tender, juicy and had great seasoning. It was somewhat of a thick rub-like seasoning and had a great peppery flavor without being overpowering. My only complaint on the steak was the fat percentage. As expected, you're going to get fat on a ribeye, but these were fattier then I've ever seen before. Not a huge deal but it's worth nothing.

We also ordered the bavarian pretzel to share. For just $6.99, you get a giant pretzel served with a couple dipping sauces. The pretzel is so big that they actually bring it to you hanging off a banana hammock...how awesome is that? It was good too! Great crunchy exterior but soft on the inside and they didn't over salt it. I was a bit bummed to find out they only serve it with the cheese and mustard now. Both were okay but I wanted to try the jalapeño cream cheese mentioned in other reviews.

If you're in the area and want a giant, delicious steak on the cheap, stop by Jackson's! It may be a bar but the food is elevated from your standard, greasy offerings and the staff is great too. If you're sensitive to a smokey environment though, you may want to call your order in to-go.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,6,2,3,CjeHDJKu_O1MrM5_T4eA1g

She wasn't joking. Although it's not your $5 steggs plate from South Point, you get a 1 pound ribeye steak, hash browns, eggs and toast for $12.99. Whatever seasoning they put on the steak is so so so delicious. I don't need steak sauce - a true testament to great seasoning on meat! You can get this deal around the clock, so if you want good quality steak and eggs at 1:30 in the morning, this place beats other steak and eggs joints in town!

Craving prime rib? For $11.99, you get a 1 pound slab of beautiful prime rib with a side of baked potato. A downside to this deal is that this is only good on Mondays! I think everyone should check this place out for the prime rib special - we can dub this day ""Meaty Mondays""! 

The last time I was here, I ordered the full rack of BBQ ribs. Came with a side of baked beans and slaw. Not the best ribs I've tasted, but they were pretty good. 

I would definitely consider Jackson's a hole-in-the-wall, at least for their food.

The place is pretty huge. There's a giant dining area, perfect for large groups. You can bring ten and fit them comfortably. They have great food. Particularly the giant pretzel.

Drink specials are nice there as well. You can get cheap pitchers of PBR for those drinking on a budgets (2 pitchers for $11? Around that price). For those who don't want to drink sand water, other beers are still pretty cheap and their pitchers are a bargain. 

The service is pretty on point. Never had a problem there. They check on your table often and refills come often. You never wait for your food too long. They put up with our groups shenanigans so they are a great group of people.

On night #2, I had a grilled cheese with bacon and all I can say is that it was dammed good! They use the best bacon! I'll definitely have it again when I'm back in town.

The Husband ordered their Jack Daniels Tri-Tip Sandwich ($9.99) and it came with your choice of french fries, cole slaw, cup of soup, or side salad.  He opted for the french fries.  He thought the sandwich was pretty tasty and he was happy with his choice.

I went for their Chicken Fingers ($6.49), which you can choose how you would like them.  I went for spicy, hoping for some much needed kick.  Unfortunately, it looked like it would be spicy but it definitely was not.  It was more on the mild side of things.  The four fingers came with carrot and celery sticks and their homemade ranch dressing.  It was just average, nothing special.  

It looks like the thing to get here is their $6.99 Steak Special though.  ""A 9 oz steak, choice of fries, slaw, or rings, steamed veggies and a dinner salad, all for ONLY $6.99, 24 hours a day. Groups are welcome.""  All that for $6.99 and served all day sounds like a pretty good deal to me!

This is a locals Green Bay Packers bar. So, I was a little confused why there aren't any cheesehead decor in the bar but there was a harpoon of all things. This place is pretty big.

The women's restroom is quite disgusting. Only 2 stalls: regular and handicap. The regular one was filthy and I had to use 3 toilet seat covers to relieve myself and the flush didn't work! The other times I went to the bathroom, I had to use the handicap stall which was much better and cleaner.

BUUUUUT our server was fantastic. I couldn't decide what I wanted to drink so she let me try stuff and she was accurate with the description of flavor profiles of drinks. She would chat with us from time to time. However, we found it quite peculiar when she asked me if I wanted a cold glass. I want a volcanic glass that would spew hot beer please!

I wish we had been hungrier because it seems like the food is the big star here, but we opted for the pretzel (as always) and the chips, salsa and guacamole. 

The pretzel was fine, not the best I have ever had but not the worst. It came with packets of mustard and a microwave cheese cup. Slightly disappointing for a place with such high reviews for food, but again, it was fine.

The chips were delicious, the menu said homemade and they were certainly good. The salsa was fine, tasted like a jarred salsa, but again, tasted good with the chips. The guacamole was also tasty, so no complaints there.

Between my beer buzz and the waitresses suggestion, we ended up getting the special dessert, apple dumplings. It was actually just one, dumpling. The dumpling was very tasty, but I was thrown off by the apple filling because it was cold. Possibly just a preference of mine though.

The place was pretty dead for a Saturday night, and even more dead in the dining area where we sat, but the waitress was nice and the bar area seems like it would be a good place to hang out, especially for Packer games which, by the decor (LOTS of Packer stuff) I am assuming they broadcast during football season. They had two HUGE screens out there which would be great to watch the games on.
