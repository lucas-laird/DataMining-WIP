During my visit, I was also in the bathroom, which was very filthy. About food? I couldn't finish the plate, that means it all. Definitely a one-time experience, I will not go back there again.",-_T2PFiSFzHHHufwuGjrpA,1,0,1,ug6gmSfzd8_PQ7Gyvec7_A

We tried a little bit of a lot of menu items, and all were served piping hot or fridge cold. From the homemade hummus and baba ganoush to the chicken shawarma and kebabs, everything tastes delicious. 

Try it, you'll like it, and you won't be sorry.",wqWXLB6yXrDb-JP_qohiZg,1,2,5,9l5ZmhpantAjdqv1wycvWQ

On the other hand, my uncle's plate of chicken kabob and shish Kafta beef was bland in flavor and not grilled, so will not order kabob plate but will definitely order the chicken shawarma again.",k7ytYuNCl9BfIQFgKz8y6g,1,0,3,x4Vq0cNVXw1ZfT_MISjVPQ

We split a combo plate special that had kafta kebab and chicken kebab my husband ordered an additional beef kebab....this was on a plate with rice, three salads, hummus, two fresh warm flat bread oh and three different sauces ....spicy...that was a little spicy, but very good, garlic, and tahini. This was way more food than we were expecting for about $23 including bottled water.  The cashier brought our food to the table, and was extremely nice to us, giving us an extra plate, cups for our water, a small tray with olives, peppers and beets before our meal was ready and to go box when we were ready to leave.  The chef was also friendly asking how we liked the food and thanking us as we were leaving. Great experience!",qXImBOkJGFFaX6Mw7Z9caA,2,2,5,YpfvD7rp7JbNzq8LhdLyyw

Both times the food was too much for me but it's so amazing. It's family owned and I feel like family when I come here. Everyone is so friendly and I feel as though I belong there. They have fresh food, great service and wonderful smiles. The garlic sauce is delicious, I'm addicted. 

There's nothing I can ask for that they don't have. Great food Service and even more they are warm. I'll be back again and again and plan on bringing more people with me.",cqy-OvaSX5fCiL6F6_Rffw,0,1,5,6Mo94R4HOeby1LOh3vECJg

The fries were also delicious, heavy on the garlic, and kinda smoky. I think might've been from paprika. Was surprised the place wasn't more crowded but we came in the early evening on a Thursday.

1962841,2017-10-05,9,Q1m3ZAO1t9JRhHK3txhJQw,"Falafel, shawarma, hummus, and more- Kiton Kitchen has all your favorite Mediterranean specialties, served out of the former Al's Beef spot on the west side. Menu is pretty expansive with large portions and reasonable prices, and the cook in particular is super sweet.

Favorite thing I've had here so far is the Chicken Shawarma Plus- a giant platter of pita, chicken cooked with onions, rice or fries, plus fresh salads, hummus, and sauces. Definitely get the garlic and spicy sauces on the side, they're both great and made in house. The chicken is a huge portion and so flavorful, made with juicy thigh meat. 

Their falafel pita was somewhat disappointing- cut in half and torn, with fairly flavorless falafel and missing the additional condiments I'd requested. I'd prefer the more traditional stuffed presentation, which I may request on another visit. Maybe order carefully, or chalk it up to a new business working out the kinks in the kitchen. Most recently, I tried their chicken soup, which is perfect for the cooler weather and packed with protein and vegetables!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,19,4,wO9IMAqQVdwEnz0LGsljeQ

As we were leaving around 7PM they were closing even though their sign said they are open until  8 every night.  We ordered a chicken pita and a lamb pita and there was more salad than neat.  The tahini sauce had a bitter taste and the hummus left a lot to be desired.

I think I'm expecting more flavor scores on their chicken and rice though. I think some Mediterranean spices were not as prominent as most or other shawarma places have it. Nice portions. I enjoyed my meal cuz it made me full. Sure to try them again if they're on my route. Maybe a beef platter...,JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,34,30,3,fK2SLDYk7z898yiZEFkwiQ

Update:

Ever since the main chef left this place hasn't been the same. Food went downhill immediately. Started using tortilla for lafa pita!

You can also substitute the hummus with baba ganoush, which is WOW, BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Since the portions are so big and I have a tiny stomach, I usually only finish half of my plate, but the baba ganoush, I always eat every last bit of it!

My friend got the beef kafta plate and I was not hungry so I got the baba ganoush. They  gave us a plate of pickles and olives that were just fabulous. The kafta was freshly grilled, beautifully spiced and the plate came with all kinds of stuff. Pilaf, hummus, like 3 kinds of salads and homemade pickles. 

My baba ganoush was the real thing. I could taste the smokiness of the eggplant that is the hallmark of real baba ganoush. Warm fluffy pita. 

The staff was wonderful. The cooking was going on right there so you could see how freshly made it was.
