The nice thing about this place is they don't charge per topping for the create your own pie. The food came out pretty quickly, and again was really good. Definitely will be back!!",hjmYUAKnJuoWTQdTgF55mw,2,1,5,MLHlYsEQsBv8mIVtiXSupw

The staff was so extremely helpful and friendly, they make you feel so welcome and like part of the family. As for the food, the garlic knots are top notch, and their individual sized pizzas are out of this world, we were so impressed with how delicious the food was! Also, I was blown away that they have beer on tap there! I am so glad that this place opened so close to my house, I can guarantee I will be going to My Pie at least once or twice a week. As far as pizza is concerned, My Pie can't be beat in my honest opinion! I highly suggest My Pie to anyone and everyone, it doesn't get any better than this guys!",9u91Beky282E9uSXpRz53Q,3,1,5,f7tqAexS0tFRHPbBw_MsVQ

The place was very clean and had a friendly atmosphere. The workers there were super friendly and helpful being our first time there and all.

We ordered the pizza your way and a side of garlic knots.
OMG!!!!!!! They were amazing! The individual pizzas and the garlic knots hit the spot. Took a picture of my pizza forgot to take one of the garlic knots. We had dug in already. 

Highly recommend this place to everyone. Thanks guys for making such delicious food.",DXIntD5dOmaZfMrLsOucrQ,2,0,5,XXcg0xx9uMCTGsc12ZWKjQ

I had a pepperoni pizza which was among the best I've had in town, and my son had a calzone which he said was in his top 3 of calzones in town. 
 The staff was very friendly the menu is very simple to use and they make everything right in front you a great experience.  They also have freshly made cookies which were amazing. Great price point, great service, great staff, great food.

2137014,2018-06-10,1,3QQdF1RT43sVq2YxeE_iHw,"So happy we tried this new place out! It's in a great location in the Walmart shopping center. 

*Customer service was on point! All of the staff that helped us out were super nice and recommended amazing pizzas! One of the owners,  Richard brought our food out to us & he was extremely friendly! Happy to see good people succeeding! 

*Pizza was delicious! Their sauce recipe is out of this world! Coming from a family of chefs .. the sauce can make or break a pizza! They had tons of creations already listed or you can make your own. Love having the options!
*Love that they offer gluten free and wheat dough but I think a low carb cauliflower pizza would be SO awesome!!!*

*Garlic knots were AMAZING! Usually I don't get any sides and garlic knots aren't my go to but thanks to the staffs recommendation we went for it and were not mad about it! 

 *Beer on tap!  YES! 


Overall, this pizzeria may be like some others in the area however, they really do stand out once you give them a try! Highly recommend!",eICyvIE-ZaXqn9Z2vCVT3A,5,1,5,gYp_EFNOJdnDcYhc3RaOSg

2544451,2018-06-11,0,3QQdF1RT43sVq2YxeE_iHw,"Better than Blaze Pizza. More sauce choices and much better salads. Garlic knots, the New York pizza and Southwest Chicken salad were really good. Plus, if you order a beer or wine ($6) , it's only $3 refills! Staff was super friendly , kitchen looks brand new and restaurant was very clean. Hope they add a TV or two",jsqZ-v7nHO2Mk8pAJNkGoA,3,1,5,q85S-JX-OhmB8LFbsO_I4Q
2700071,2018-06-21,2,3QQdF1RT43sVq2YxeE_iHw,New pizza place in Centennial Hills in the Walmart parking lot. It reminds me of Blaze pizza. Kind of pricey for the kind of pizzas we got. I had the Pesto My Chicken pizza. I was a bit disappointed when they used diced chicken pieces like CiCi's. They don't have a whole lot of toppings to choose from. On a side note: The garlic knots were really good! I would recommend the garlic knots for sure!,VX2ET_olUjvBj2cc6ci_Pw,2,0,4,DU2whYaQ4d8Z-Rc6xjC4xA

We were immediately greeted by Dwayne. He was so welcoming. After asking if we were new to My Pie he explained how they work, let us know the favorites as well as his. He made great suggestions which were much appreciated. He's awesome!! Someone else checked us out. Equally friendly. I had 1/2 My Greek Pie, 1/2 Spicy Butcher. Hubby tried 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2  Hot Hawaiian. Both were delicious. The food was actually brought to us. Bonus points!

You also can't go wrong with classic pepperoni and cheese. All the ingredients are fresh and delicious. Prices are very reasonable to grab some lunch and dinner. A lot better than Blaze and Pieology.

The teamwork environment was very tight and I love to see that. They worked together flawlessless to recommend, start, and provide the BEST vegan pizza I've had. Another gentleman helping top our pizza even gave us recommendations on the vegan cheese to make sure we knew it was a little more savory tasting so they use it sparingly. The cashier did a great job up-selling cookies, brownies, and drinks to us. We will be back to try the spicy butcher next!",mnboKKyCM1okoO8se1eQrA,1,1,5,Dw2sZEmeqyjL6uVQLQeS4g

5139395,2018-06-09,0,3QQdF1RT43sVq2YxeE_iHw,"Another great restaurant opening in the NW!

This one a bit familiar in concept, but standing apart from the rest using the freshest ingredients, house made dough, every sauce and seasoning prepared in-house daily, etc!!

Surprising in this setting, but once you taste the difference, you'll understand why they prep hours before open and the lunch rush to ensue shortly after.

Multiple draft choices at an ALL DAY happy hour pricing. Tenaya Creek Brown Ale and Peroni are great options depending on your pie toppings. Refills are only $3 even on the imports....yes, only $3 :)

Recommended :

Spicy Butcher Pie : Fra Diavolo Sauce, Parmesan, Fresh Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Sausage, Pepperoncini & Basil. My favorite of the day, love pepperoncini on pizza, and the pepperoni and sausage is delicious here! Can't go wrong here!

The San Gennaro : Pizza Sauce, Parmesan, Mozzarella, Sausage, Green Bell Peppers, Roasted Red Peppers & Caramelized Onions. Tons of flavor, peppery and delicious :)

Angry Bird : Savory BBQ Sauce, Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, All Natural Spicy Chicken, Red Onions & Ranch Drizzle. Great buffalo chicken style pizza, just the right amount of heat.

Don't forget the vampire worthy Garlic Knots...excellent!! You'll want to sop your pizza crust in the medley hiding below :)

Enjoy!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,7,2,5,UX_MmFggpQrAkZqvlsNcVA
5236742,2018-06-30,1,3QQdF1RT43sVq2YxeE_iHw,Very bad management. In a Friday evening at 5:30 they were all out of wheat dough. Not one person in restaurant. All surrounding restaurants were packed. Terrible mananagement.Ate there once before and they are very stingy with the toppings. Don't expect this place to be open in 6 months.

Few complaints I have is management seems to be micromanaging too much, system well there really isn't one and everything should be labeled. Also waited at one register for a bit to be told to go down to the other heisted and had someone come from the back to help me while my pizza sat there 

Other than that great service and good pizza will try in a few months in hopes they get a better system down.",WzXOzgnHRIyoQx07E3nu_A,1,0,5,6Y9wOihu14m_GhfTQqatPw
