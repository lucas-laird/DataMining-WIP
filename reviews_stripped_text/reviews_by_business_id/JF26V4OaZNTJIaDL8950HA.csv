What makes this one particularly special is that Manny and Erika work there. Manny is really helpful, quick with the order, and memorizes who you are giving it that personal touch. Erika is not only beautiful, she gives everyone a five star experience. Manny and Erika is the reason I continue to go to this location and will continue to go as long as they are there.",ghIZ0m3DFDABY-oNof6fvA,0,0,5,1kNbRQIXpI1qWW8yDw7H-A

2000675,2013-08-03,1,JF26V4OaZNTJIaDL8950HA,"Terrible service, so-so food.

This place is super confusing and almost misleading. 

You order from the board, but you don't realize that you get charged extra for some entrees even though there is no indication of that until you actually start to order it. It felt like a trap. Like, who wants to sit at a drive-thru and make ANOTHER choice because you don't want to pay an extra dollar for what you already chose?

Anyway. I wanted to get extra vegetables to go with my honey shrimp entree (which was good, but for that extra dollar it's way smaller than the other entrees) and some chicken teriyaki for my dogs. They told me the teriyaki would be an extra five minutes so pull up and wait. I did so and waited 10 MINUTES for my food. I finally had to drive back through to get it. NOT HAPPY. 

I also asked the people at the window if they could make sure my other entrees were hot despite the wait for the chicken. They assured me it would be. It wasn't.

I would really avoid this place. It's super expensive for what you get and the service is terrible. The vegetables were good, but the spring rolls and the shrimp weren't good enough to pay for.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,2,1,2,bGych7GoFb1-z99nkrngpw

I ordered a bowl and wanted to pay with a remaining gift card balance. She told me the card wasn't reading. Ok.

She tried covering it in plastic and told me that wasn't working and that's what they do when cards don't work. I know this. I used to work a cash register. Fix it and get me my food. It's already been 7 minutes.

I told her type it in. She tells me she can't. I said again, type it in. Again she says she cannot. I ask for a manager because clearly she is incompetent. She informs me she is the one in charge. WOW! I'm amazed. Shocked. 

She then tells me she is going to another register. She finally comes back and tells me she typed it in. Way to go! 

I'm truly appalled people like this have jobs and think they can demand 15/hr. 

Veronica and the other employees at this place need some training. I'm sorry to go off like this, but people like that shouldn't be in charge.",bkZ2jqi74fyfXs6JEdtTUA,0,0,2,52zRMPpme9DPiklxyMFE4Q

It is not often when you get your mail to go, did you arrive at back at your hotel and take the first bite and realize this is the freshest panda express food you have ever had.

We were looking for a quick place to eat and take back to our hotel room and enjoy a nice quiet evening we found out there was a panda express about a mile from our hotel which made it very nice and easy for us to go pick up our meal. Upon arriving at the location there was plenty of parking in two entrance to choose from to enter the location. Upon entering this location we had a short wait for other customers the place their order, upon placing our order was done very fast efficiently and with a very big smile from the employees. We were able to pay just as quick pick up some chopsticks and soy sauce and of course y'all famous fortune cookie. And then we were on our way.

Once we arrive back in our hotel I opened up our food and begin to eat and enjoy a nice relaxing evening it was upon that time I realize the food that we were eating was so fresh and so tasty that this location became one of the Favorites for us. We would have to commend all the employees and the franchise owner of this location for doing a fantastic job and making sure everything was fresh for not only us but for other customers that came to the location. We hope this was not a one off event and this is the way they conduct their business every day we look forward to coming back to this location in future trip.",PsQE8GI6ZybxZDUxOmrLSA,22,24,5,mMjnhy1n0_YB2fHN1ouhkg

The first visit I was actually shocked to see that they offered vegetarian selections now and even changed the way they prepared their rice so that it was vegetarian friendly. In the past, there wasn't much I could order here outside of the cream cheese wontons.

This visit, however had nothing vegetarian to offer but the wontons and vegetarian egg rolls. Typically they have tofu. I was only stopping in because mom had a craving but thought I might order something once I started smelling the goodness. Well, I didn't get anything because as I mentioned, the selection was small.

Both times I have come here, the restaurant has been a ghost town. Today there was absolutely no one inside but the employees, me and my mom. The same for the last visit, but grant it they were both Sundays.

All in all they keep the place clean in which I appreciate and demand, and my mom loves it, so all is good. Oh and the staff? Always super friendly. Kudos to the training staff!",dnv5UpldAE6UITDcMleLVA,2,1,4,CxuJPDuAaVKbiXe4is_hKw

Knowing that I still like it, call it a guilty pleasure call it convenient, call it just slightly healthier than a Big Mac. That being said, this location had an issue when I was there. It was 11 AM, I think we can all agree that is lunchtime, an early lunch perhaps, but lunchtime nevertheless . They were out of many items, some items were running low, and no replenishment had been started, and other items were not hot.

I had a kid's meal & I felt like that was a good enough serving to fill me up. I had the sweet fire chicken breast & half & half of the chow mein & brown fried rice.
