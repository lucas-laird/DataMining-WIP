The three words you need to hear at the beginning of your dinner that ensures a very pleasurable experience... DUCK FAT FRIES (and a trio no less).  What an amazing thing!  Light, crispy, wonderful flavor.  I was expecting something that would be too rich to handle, but these were great.  Three flavors (bbq, truffle, herbed) with accompanying dipping sauces.  Yum.

I decided to forego an appetizer as I really wanted to sink my teeth into some steak.  So tempted to go for Wagyu beef, but I went for an 18oz dry-aged Angus rib-eye... perfectly seasoned and cooked.  No need for any kind of sauce.  And the sides...

The sides!  Truffled mac n' cheese.... and not just mac n' cheese made with truffle oil, but actual truffle shavings in the sauce!  Heaven.  Creamed spinach with bacon... caramelized onion and goat cheese scalloped potatoes... and their complimentary foccacia bread.   

For dessert... Beignets with 18-year-old Scotch pudding... just the right amount of booziness.  The beignets were warm, light, and airy. 

As if this isn't enough fried dough... i also ordered the Dunkin' mini doughnuts... these came with jasmine infused chocolate sauce and salted caramel sauce... yes...  yes...

Service was wonderful... The space is beautiful and modern.

We both ordered the angus filet, medium-rare and medium and both thought the steak was cooked to the correct doneness. I thought that the sear was a little weak and a lot more flavor could have been achieved on the steak. We received the complimentary trio of fries about 10 minutes after being seated and they were pretty good, I personally thought the truffle dip was awesome.

The big disappointment was the Truffle Mac n Cheese. I don't know if we came on an off night or if the people reviewing are used to bad pasta, but after asking the waitress whether we should order the trio potato puree or the truffle mac she told us the truffle mac was the way to go. It was horrendously overcooked and extremely soft, I could definitely taste the truffle but it was over-peppered and that taste was overpowering. It was also very oily/greasy. I mentioned it being overcooked, and my friend and I ate literally one small spoonful each so over 90% of it was left in the container but the server didn't mention anything else about it which I thought was poor service.

Dessert was excellent, I had the beignets with the butterscotch pudding. Don't let the word ""sauce"" fool you, it is definitely full on pudding (delicious though!).",WzZf0tkegf17U_IPz9v7Nw,0,0,3,dQK5pG3dEP3bevWN6ZoXiA

Start with duck and sashimi .. The duck appetizer was fantastic. 5. Sashimi was awesome too, and the nice touch is that there was real wasabe and not the pasty generic kind. Tasty and sentious : 4.75 out of 5.

Ginger beer nice selection, as suggested by the server when I ordered ginger ale. 4.5

Flight of fries was cute and noshy.. very bistro chic. 4.5

Marrow : delicious and rich. Served with perfectly sized toastettes... 5

Dry aged rib eye 3.5 out of 5. Hate to say it, but a bit too much marbling and gristle. I would rate the meat quality as a choice cut, but not prime or Angus. Also, I would have expected the steak to be served decently hot, but it came to the table cooler than being let to rest after cooking.  The smokey (Alder) was a bit more overwhelming than expected and I felt it impeded the taste you should be getting from proper aged beef.  I know I'm being a bit critical here, but I have had awesome creations from Mina and know he can purvey far better. Maybe it was an off night.. 

Noise: dang loud. But it's Vegas. 

Service: Decent but seemingly with slow dips. I was disappointed with a few things though. The server was very nice for the most part but did two things a server should not do:

First:  Please never clear one diner's plate before the other diner has finished the course. IT isn't proper etiquette. 

Second:  when offered the taste of the ginger beer, it truly was a good selection. I hadn't even drank the ginger ale yet. The server was a tad patronizing in stating she would get me the ginger beer as well, and did not remove the ginger ale from the tab. Partially my fault for not asking for a taste, but the proper manner should have been to be offered a taste first before bringing me both. I know it wasn't malicious.. and it was during the Consumer Electronics Show, so she may have had her fill with attendees that didn't know proper dining etiquette.  2/5

I say overall itWould I go back? Yes.. Kinda like learning a new country and their customs, I know what to focus on more. I'll be back in Vegas in a few weeks and will give them a try again because I do see the potential.",0in2lZcHmh6VqFq7_0nhUg,3,1,3,hv-oEQnFRVH2q0N0oXFarg

I went for a company dinner--so you know I got to eat everything possible! For appetizers we had Tiger Prawns, Lettuce cups, and fries as appetizers. They were all very good. Flavorful and nicely seasoned

As much as I wanted to abstain from beef because I've been feeling a little heavy lately, I HAD to get the steak--I mean, the place is called STRIPSTEAK for christ's sake! I had the 10oz Filet Mignon (Medium Rare) and it was cooked to PERFECTION. I think that was the best cooked steak I've ever had. Melted in my mouth like butter!

For sides, we had the Potato Puree Trio, Spinach, and roasted mushrooms. The spinach wasn't anything special, but the roasted mushrooms were great. The potato puree was a little ""pureed"" for me, and maybe I had a little bit too much alcohol in me, so it didn't sit quite well in my stomach--but it was ok. 

For dessert, we had a trio of ice cream (chocolate ice cream was amazingggg), strawberry shortcake (really good), a blueberry custard (this is good if you're not into anything overly sweet), and some sort of chocolate concoction. Wish I could describe the desserts better, but they don't have the dessert menu up.

To my splendid surprise, the manager of Stripsteak, Ashley, saw my review on yelp and invited me back for complimentary appetizers and drinks. As far as customer service goes, this is the best I've experienced. Ashley really made me feel welcomed.

I ordered the maine crab chowder and the lobster fritter:

Crab Chowder: this soup was fantastic. The chunks of crab in the soup were huge and incredibly fresh. The soup itself was silky smooth, flavorful and reminded you of the sea.

Lobster fritter: these fritters were also really good. they look like miniature corn dogs but with bacon wrapped lobster in a light batter. Per Ashley's instructions, you are to squeeze the lime onto the fritter, then dabble a good amount of creme fresh, and then wrap it in butter lettuce. The results were short of genius. The butter lettuce gave it a good balance to offset any oiliness the batter may have. 

p.s. Order the raspberry martini. It was strong as shit. next time, i'm definitely going to order the filet tartare and the kobe shabu shabu.

Old Review: I ordered the now legendary American Kobe Rib Cap with Truffled Mac N Cheese. The server also brought out a complimentary trio of fries: truffle, herb, and cajun. The truffle aioli was out of this world. Unfortunately, I can't be this complimentary with the rest of the meal.

Let's start with the Truffled Mac N Cheese. This was a great dish. It wasn't too creamy and it wasn't too runny. The consistency was perfect. The cheese wasn't overpowering, so the truffle was able to shine through.

My problem with STRIPSTEAK was their overrated Kobe Rib Cap. What I received was way too salty. With a steak valued at nearly $70, I expected perfection. I do give them props for the way they cooked the steak though. The crust was crisp, and the center was tender. It would be a great piece of meat if they didn't dump a ton of salt on it.",HEzVlIJeVpwjiNCPXNM-aA,2,0,4,Dt5NulvvUq9LR9RRD0u2dA

Started the dinner with a glass of scotch and ended with a glass (how every dinner should be!).

Came here with a group of guys during our guys weekend to Vegas.  We started with the Duck Fat Fries and Foie Gras Sliders.  Both were awesome and highly recommended.  Foie Gras Sliders melts in your mouth!!!

For the entree, I had the 8oz Wagyu American Kobe Rib ""Eye""

By far one of the best pieces of steaks I have ever had.  It was soft like a marshmallow and melted like one in my mouth.  During the meal of course we ordered a nice bottle of wine or two and it really brought out the flavor of the meal.

For sides we had the, Truffle Mac and Cheese, Asparagus, Scalloped Potatoes, and the Bone Marrow.

All awesome, but the Bone Marrow really stood out of the bunch.

Now for dessert....

We all had a glass of scotch and ordered some Beignets with some aged whiskey sauce and creme brulee sauce.  Man that was awesome as well.  Crispy on the outside and soft as a pillow on the inside.

All in all a great meal, due to the fact that every course was great.  I did not have one bad thing and the service was wonderful as well.

The place is expensive, but you should know that before going in and just forget the price and enjoy the night with some of the best steak you will have.

My eyes drank in the gorgeous ambiance. The ceiling light displays playing swirls of water like some giant screen saver were mesmerizing.

Complimentary Duck Fat Fries....these are just crack for fat kids.... I was really surprised at how good something like ""fries"" can be. I was happy with how delicious they were. 

I started with the Sweet Onion Soup. OMG I was seriously considering licking the bowl dry.... I was very angry at the shape of the bowl! Because it's hard to get out every delicious drop.

It's creamy and thick without being clumpy and the golden flavour of the onions are strong without overpowering. It's just ridiculously good.

I also got a La Poire Martini, to sip on. Refreshing and so clean. I want that recipe! Hell I want all their recipes.

For main course I chose the Colorado Lamb. I have NEVER had lamb so good before. It was juicy, tender, the RIGHT amount of fat to complement its flesh. The jus was delicious. I was having to hold myself back from going feral and just picking up the bones with my hands and ripping into it :)

Stupid manners...and forks...

I chose a side of Mac and Cheese. SO GOOD. Sinfully good, I was like I'm so putting this in my purse to take home, good. Creamy, and gooey and the right bite of sharp and creamy cheeses.  Noodles were perfection.

I got a cute bag of popcorn for my complimentary desert. What a lovely gesture.

I would say a rip off!! The first ribeye came out to the table and it was 70% fat. The waitress was kind enough to acknowledge it was all fat and brought a second one. It was lean but flavorless. Ordered potatoes as a side dish and only to learn after we ordered,,, you are presented with French fries rather than bread. 
Brussel sprouts were average. Peppercorn sauce ( you are charged for) flavorless.
Our starter of Oysters were very good. Wines are very pricey and it is okay if it matches the quality of the food.
We love Fix at Bellagio, STK, Wynn Steakhouse, Palm, and may I finish by saying we would of had better quality down the street at Texas de Brazil. Very sad as It isn't about feeling taken advantage of, but more you can not replace an evening in Vegas!!",0D20DPif2KyEN9_zS5YOUQ,0,0,1,xboBq0Lj3r_W56L6YhKIug

I thought my steak was dipped in salt,  I could not taste the steak,  the salt was over powering.  I could taste it throughout and it left a very bad taste on my palate.  My wife's scallops were over salted too.  Then i start hearing from the table next to me,  told you we should of went to jack in the box. They offered free desserts to a lot of tables, including ours which was nice,  i did not have our meal replaced cause i thought it may take too long and was so hungry so I did a little patting with my napkin to reduce the salt and finished with a large glass of water., but i do not think I am coming back.

The service was great. This was in-line with the level of restaurant that this place is. The servers paid attention to detail, had the right amount of ""chat"" in them, and didn't give off any stuffy vibes for a place that is priced at that level. 

The atmosphere is underrated. I thought that the open feel was nice; instead of going with the ""modern"" color tones, the wood feel of the side wall (a giant Jenga piece) kept the balance between old-world and new-world. The chairs were VERY comfortable to sit on (and I'm a big guy). This is an important detail after being stuffed.

The food was a notch below ""the best."" This is not a slight on this restaurant. I just happen to reserve my ""Best"" label for only the 2-3 elite few restaurants. The meat was a little overseasoned for my taste buds (as was my wife's). The sides were delicious. Our favorite was the Jalapeno Creamed Corn - yum! The Truffled Mac and Cheese was really good too. The trio of mashed potatoes is a safe choice if you are looking to go that route. Our appetizer, the Hamachi, was decent. The flavor profile of the fish and the seasoning (fresh) was good - however, it just didn't fit with our steak and potatoes type of meal.

I would come here again. I have a feeling the steak was overseasoned on accident (not so much so that I would have to send it back - I still ate all of it). The deal at restaurant.com really made this a great luxury-value.",FWmqs6tgPuzKdrrweKBIrA,0,0,4,DpZdsdE0vAXjBynuGpjM4A

186718,2007-03-17,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Who should eat here:  Some one that wants a great steak, and price is no object.  Let me repeat: price is no object (this place is off the charts expensive, and yes I do know its Vegas, and Mina's name is on it)
 
1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off
2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable
3 Stars - Adequate
4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there
5 Stars - Can't get much Better
 
Ambience/Atmosphere: 3.5 stars.  Big and open, with a very modern a sleek feel.  I found it a bit uncomfortable to be honest, but I guess not that bad for Vegas.  Has a cool bar, and the cocktails are very good.  
 
Service: 4 stars.  A tiny bit cold and service is a little bit snotty, but not to the point where it would bother you.  They know what they are doing and they are extremely professional.  They will not miss a beat at all, but I found overall they were very un-personable.  
 
Food: 4.5 stars.  Mina has done it again with the food.  First off they brought us three little cones filled with french fries, with three dipping sauces.  Not a big fan of fries, but these were pretty damn good, cooked to a crispy light brown, they had the most flavor I think I have ever experience in a french fry.  I had a American Kobe steak tartar to start.  They prepared it table side, mixing the small pieces of chopped steak with 9 ingredients and spices.  This app was off the charts.  Probably a little too rich if you plan on having a steak for you main, but if you are going to go for an alternative or are just getting apps, ORDER THIS DISH!  The meat in the tartar could have been some of the most delicious steak I have had in a long time.  It literally melted in my mouth.  For entree I opted for the pork loin.  This dish was crazy good and I will have to say exceeded my expectations in every way possible.  If you are not going to order a steak for your main, I would seriously consider this as an option.  It had a bitter orange type sauce that was sooo good, and was perfect with the flavors of the pork.  Given time constraints we passed on dessert, so no comment on the sweets.
 
Wine: 4 stars.  First off Strip has a 5 star wine list, I am knocking it a star because it has no value.  Expect well over a double in mark up, and in most cases more.  The staff is well skilled on the list, which was a plus for me too.  If price is no object I would focus on some of the Bordeaux on the list, they have all the trophies.  But be prepared to put a big dent in the wallet.
 
Overall:  Well this definitely is Mina in style.  He really knows how to create a food experience.  I have to say though, I would really struggle to recommend Strip to anyone, given that I don't think the experience really holds up to the prices.  I really have never had a problem paying a lot for dinner, but this was a little ridiculous.  Good luck, and happy dining.",YvAOzprdaK573mU5fqHMTg,4,1,4,hxyeUninpBOzGyY6dribHg

StripSteak is the restaurant I go to every time I go to Vegas when I am looking for a great steak. I have dinned here at least a dozen times in the last few years and I have yet to have a bad meal or one that does not meet my expectations.

The last time I dined there was March second, just prior to the Carrie Underwood concert as part of my birthday weekend. The experience I had was exceptional! They were very accommodating and the service was spectacular. My parents and I started the evening in the lounge for a couple of happy hour drink specials prior to our seating (we arrived early and prior to the opening of the main dining room). The happy hour drinks were well priced.

Once the main dining room opened, we were promptly seated by the hostess and our server was present to attend to us. He was exceptional with any questions that my parents had and dietary requests were received well and honored by the kitchen.The duck fat fries are a nice change to the regular bread and butter offerings of most restaurants.  We ordered a bottle of Joseph Phelps Opus One wine for our dinner and it was exceptional, but also costly... The wine list is exceptional for a steak house.

Well all had appetizers of Salad. I always get the caesar salad (presentation changes every time) and the the Kansas City Striploin steak. My parents opted for a filet. All steaks cooked to perfection. We shared a couple of side dishes at the table and were also excellent.

We opted for a desert beverages as opposed to deserts. I opted for the Adult root bear float, which was likely kaluha and galliano with  a scoop of ice cream... Nice and refreshing. Though, as it was a birthday weekend, I did receive a complementary plate of ices cream with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate sauce.

There was an element of sticker shock with a tab of over $1,000.00, but worth the celebration of a milestone birthday.",9bUGCyc8qcNRngAmUd9GZg,1,0,5,uAehtd7MbmY6RiBNFLv0Pg

I ordered a caesar salad which was incredible and the rest of the table ordered the BLT wedges also amazing, simple but great flavor.

My dad ordered the World Wide Wagyu which is outstanding but being I had ordered that last time I wanted something else so our server recommended the Mishima Wagyu Reserve Cap and holy smokes it is probably the best steak I have ever had. 

For sides we had Grilled Asparagus, they char it on the grill so it has a charred taste and the ladies didn't like it but I did. Now the auGratin potatoes are absolutely a must, they are definitely the best I've ever had and I'm a picky potato person.

We made reservations the same day (on a Sunday night) for two.  They only had a couple time slots available and we now understand why.

We ordered a wedge salad and asked to have it split for both of us, which they did and it was presented cleanly on two plates for our appetizer.

For our entrees, we got a filet mignon ($56) and a Kansas City strip ($48).   Both were tender, juicy and delicious!!  A nice size portions too!

Our side dish was the scalloped potatoes.  We were not expecting much, but wow did it surprise us with the taste!

We will definitely be back to this high class restaurant on our next visit to Vegas and will be telling all of our friends about it too!

The truffle sauce rich but so flavorful.  Next, we shared the 18 oz rib eye and the braised veal chop.  The 18 oz dry aged rib eye was simple, without the excessive spice mixture coating or butter drenching the meat, and yet so delicious that you could really appreciate the meat itself.  Cooked to perfection!  The braised veal chop fell right off the bone, however was on the saltier side.  To compliment these large slabs of meat was the star side...the truffle mac and cheese.  A blend of broccoli, macaroni noodles, and cheeses smothered in a coating of cheese (I think it was mizithra), this was the best mac and cheese I've tasted, and I couldn't stop eating it (yes it is a recurrent theme in this write-up).  I was so full after finishing my veal chop and mac and cheese that I couldnt make it to dessert, but I'll definitely be back for more.

First of all, given the sheer size of my party, I knew there would be some small issues.  Stripsteak does not have a private dining area, but they set up a nice table for my guests.  The ambiance was perfect for my type of outing - trendy, and certainly upscale without being stuffy, where you would have to worry about using the wrong fork and be without another for the rest of your night, as punishment.  I would probably give 4 stars as an individual rating for the ""value"" of the set-up vs. what it cost, but then there was...the food.

Ahh yes, the food.  What really matters.

First of all, pretty much everything at Stripsteak is served with complimentary duck fat fries.  Deliciously crisp and decadent, and accompanied by 3 dipping sauces (but good enough to not require any accompaniment.)  Now here's a little secret - still have a small ghetto streak in me where I like my fries served with my steak, so it was a little strange to have these as an appetizer, but surely a great way to start off the meal.

Per their menu, my group had the choice of salad or a shrimp cocktail appetizer, entree of flat iron steak, chicken, or salmon (I have no idea how the non-steak items tasted.)  Upgrades to filet mignon or ribeye were available.  And given the decadence of my spending, an upgrade for sure was necessary.  (More on that below.)  Additionally, sides were served ""family style.""  Broccolini, pureed potatoes of three flavors (sour cream and chive, lobster, and I can't remember the other), and truffle mac and cheese.  The truffle mac and cheese was the highlight for many of my guests (the ones that didn't order steak.)

Ahh yes, the steak.  Peruse their menu and you will see that Michael Mina doesn't drive to a corner butcher to get his cuts.  With all respect to USDA grading of beef, this night required a little international flavor...in the form of...

World Wide Wagyu.

Anyone who has done steak research knows that Japanese Beef is luxurious but also a curiosity.  ""Kobe Sliders"" at your local bar and grill for $12 have more in common with an aging basketball player than they do true Kobe Beef.  Even cows that are designated ""Wagyu"" may not be imported from Japan.  So, this mini world tour consisted of three cuts of Wagyu (beef derived from a line of Japanese cows that are bred in other countries.)  These cuts:

American Wagyu Rib Cap - rib cap is the new trendy top cut of meat.  It's generally the best couple ounces of your ribeye, made even better when it comes from a well-marbled wagyu cow.  This cut had a perfect sear and set all my umami sensors afire.

Australian Wagyu Short Rib - tender, fall-apart, as if it were braised.  (I didn't check to see if it was actually braised short rib or not.)  

Finally, real Japanese ""A5"" grade Wagyu Filet Mignon.  A5 is the highest grading that Wagyu can have in Japan, based on beef yield, color, and the all-important marbling score.  I wish I could have seen a photo of it before it was cooked, to visualize all the delicious marbling.  After cooking, it tasted like pure meat butter.  Delicious.

After a meal like this, I'm not sure if I can ever go back to eating steaks even at fancy local steakhouses.  Of the three, I am declaring the American Wagyu RIb Cap the winner in an ever so slight margin over the Japanese A5 Filet (though, likely, just because it was Rib Cap).  The Australian came in third, but was still delicious.  Wagyu, you may have ruined me for life!  Thank you, Stripsteak, for introducing me to it and making me an addict.  

Thank you also for an incredible birthday with a ridiculously good meal.",0Kyh0ayZhSlcZCREmgrmkA,0,0,5,EJvTWDXF5YFIUeytyrlQiw

Father in law is staying at Mandalay Bay for a convention this week, so after watching the Tigers game at the sports book, we ventured out to find some grub and a few drinks for catching up. After looking at several menus we decided on Strip Steak. Wife's pops is probably the biggest fan of steak in the world. Yeah, you've probably met a steak lover before. Not like this guy though. 

For starters, the place is right off the restaurant mall-ish area when you are walking from the casino back to wards the shark reef and chapel are. Familiar to me since I GOT MARRIED THERE! It is a little loud and not as intimate as your typical high end steak house, but that is to be expected considering the location and the fact it's called ""Strip"" Steak. 

Very extensive wine and cocktail list sure to please anything you'd crave. The dinner menu was impressive as well, featuring a massive selection of steaks from any quality and cut you could imagine. There were also your typical sea food selections and the ala-carte sides you've grown to love from a nice steak house, baked potatoes, creamed spinach, etc. Let us get back to the important part - the steaks. 

We were lucky enough to be sat close enough to see the giant wood fire grill system set up in the kitchen and the meat lockers with giant slabs of meat. Now that sounds pretty weird, but it's cool to see them wheel the grills up and down while your choice cut is being prepared. In theory, they could put a name-tag on your selection and you could watch them cook it. 

Our table ordered the east coast oysters of which I only had one. It was perfect though. The wedge salad looked impressive, but had a cheap store bought like bleu cheese dressing instead of the crumbled bleu cheese you'd expect on a steak house chop salad. Pass. 

I selected the bone in rib-eye. It was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The steak was well marbled, just the right amount of char, and seasoned the way a steak should be. No fancy sauces tonight. I also had the creamed spinach I mentioned above, and it wasn't that good. They sprinkled what seemed like bacos (gross) on the top, which were really pointless. Also, they spinach was not as creamy as a creamed spinach should be. Am I being picky about spinach? I suppose, but for as proud of the menu (think $$$$) as this place was, they better do it all right. 

Overall it was a great meal. I had a few cocktails from the bar, and my two counterparts enjoyed some wine. The cocktails are served with one giant ice cube which is an interesting touch, as it did not water  down my drink as fast as a normal ice having drink would have. 

I saved the best for last. When your server hands you your menus, there is a snack of three types of fries served at the table, with three dipping sauces. One set of fries is fried in duck fat. Absolutely NOT gross. Paired with the truffle dipping sauce, they were probably the best fries I've ever had in the history of me eating fries. They were so good I almost ordered a hamburger at a steak house, just so I could have the side of fries it would have come with. 

4 stars out of 5 for the creamed spinach thingy and the less than impressive wedge salad. 

Note: If you're an out of town-er looking for a pregame meal before your main event of a drink filled excellent adventure on the strip, you could do much worse, and I can't imagine you could do a ton better. Great service, nice bar, and even with a convention in the same building were able to seat us without a reservation.",MJrSvJ-Tz1HXKOOCHnlyoQ,0,1,4,wdprcXoSDMke6FfStl_D5Q

Let me inform you all that my BF is kinda closed minded when it comes to food so him eating raw-mooing-cow meat was effin crazy for me to hear! 

Anyway, this place is good. Michael Mina, thank you. Complimentary duck fat fries were bomb.com they were a bit salty, but so crunchy and cooked perfectly. They came in three different flavors with three different dipping sauces they were all yummy! 

Kobe beef tartare: surprisingly good. The server brings the tartare and spices on a plate, explains each spice, asks if we are ok with each and then mixes it all in front of us. He then puts it in the bowl over ice, and it is served with grilled pita bread. It was Awesome. I was skeptical
About eating raw meat, but if it's Kobe, I guess it's fine?

Our main course was our steAks. I had the skirt steak and my BF had the 18oz ribeye. Cant say anything bad about em. Our sides were the creamed spinach and the scalloped potatoes.

395965,2010-09-16,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Coming here was a bit random.  I was staying at theHotel at Mandalay Bay and a group of us decided to hit the Happy Hour special after a nice run on the craps tables.  I am sure glad we did.

I ordered/tried only appetizers this time around.  The list includes Skirt Steak, Oysters, Tiger Prawns, Crab Cakes, Duck Fat Fries, Lobster Fitters and Kobe Sliders.  I could write on and on about how good everything was, but I'll keep this short.

The Skirt Steak was remarkable.  I'd say it was about an 8oz serving and had a chimichurri sauce over it.  Perfectly grilled to my liking.  It was almost as tender as filet.  The steak had a nice char on the outside.  Just perfection all around.

My next favorite the Kobe Sliders.  I'll admit I've never had the pleasure of having a full Kobe steak at any restaurant.  I sort of think it is overhyped, but these were sublime.  They were small, but for the amount of food we ordered, it was a perfect size.  If you go to their Happy Hour, they are 50% off ($10 instead of $20), order 2 orders, they are that good.

The Duck Fat Fries were great.  There were 3 different kinds.  Most reviews have written about them, but I am reiterating how good they were.  The middle ones with the truffle aioli was the best of the bunch.

My next trip to Vegas, hopefully sooner than later, I will be stopping here to try a full meal.  The bartenders commented repeatedly how good their Rib Cap Steak is.  Gotta try it.",Sk9Hgl9sXG5rhOvFFmvQ9w,3,0,5,0ffBJO51LU20aHnkzXSPVw
412332,2011-01-10,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"So I decided to give in and try a fancy schmancy place on the strip over the weekend. Usually I try to avoid restaurants on the Strip because they're overcrowded, overpriced and in general the wait is to long. Luckily I had to join my friend as she was meeting a group at StripSteak for happy hour. 

Walking up to the restaurant, we were generously greeted by the Assistant GM Miss Ashley and the rest of her hosting staff. Our group was easily accommodated since the happy hour was pretty dead. According to Miss Ashley, that was rare on a Saturday night. To me, it was luck because I would then be able to assess a fair review on this place. 

The bar area is fairly small, I would say that the big comfy purple seats do tend to take up a lot of space within that bar area that it really wasn't an ideal place for a group of 8 to be sitting. Plus we made it a little difficult for the wait staff to maneuver around. Their happy hour drink & food menu is reasonably priced. I would highly recommend their specialty, the cucumber martinish drink, it was quite refreshing and a great summertime drink. And this means a lot since I'm more of a beer drinker. The raspberry lemonade & mojitos were just ok, maybe a little to weak, but again that's just my opinion. 

My friend and I decided to try dinner so we asked the staff for a table in the dining area and were quickly accommodated. Right away we were greeted with complimentary duck fries, which we also had ordered during happy hour. These fries are cooked in duck fat so don't worry it's not any crazy duck part, which I would have hoped for. There are three different rings of fries - paprika smoked, truffle and garlic Parmesan. The sauces were just ok, it was the general concept of ketchup, BBQ sauce and truffle aioli but of course more upscale. I preferred to munch on the suckers without any of the sauces. 

Our waiter, Steve, was awesome. He highly recommended the Rib Cap & Filet Mignon, along with a side of truffle mac & cheese and honestly it was phenomenal. The Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and just melted in your mouth. The Rib cap, which is the end part of the rib eye, was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The truffle mac & cheese was definitely the best truffle mac & cheese I have experienced in a while. Most tend to be dry but this one was moist and also had pieces of broccoli that it never lost it's flavor. We also had a side of asparagus with a horseradish blanc sauce. I couldn't complain about anything. At first I laughed at the portion size but then as we kept eating I was actually pretty full. Also it might have been the alcohol we had prior to dinner! And me not knowing if you are allowed to take a doggy bag from such places, found the inner strength to finish our food, it truly was like a scene out of Man vs Food. 

But wait, we weren't done! WTH? Steve charmed us into trying dessert, I figured what the heck, let's go all out! We ordered the beignets with their chocolate butterscotch pudding. Whew! I think I was getting drunk off the pudding, I might have been able to light a fire. However, the beignets were soft and moist and perfectly fried. 

Overall the ambiance of StripSteak is great, perfect for a date or just to people watch from the bar. It did tend to get busier as the night progressed. Yes it's quite pricey but honesty I have to say it was the best experience I have had in a while at a Strip restaurant. Michael Mina did a phenomenal job with this place and all the employees were great. To see the AGM serving drinks, chatting with customers, waiting on guests, cleaning tables and bringing out checks says a lot about the employee morale. She helped making the dining experience that much better.

The only thing I would say is that yes the meat platters need to have a little more presentation. Maybe had a sprig of rosemary or something, just to give it a little more color and pizzazz.. 

Food for thought - 1) make sure you have reservations 2) make sure you give yourself enough time to have dinner as our evening lasted over 4 hours 3) if you can't stomach rich food, be aware that some of their steaks are cooked with butter. Yay for TUMS! 4) All sides are al a carte so expect to pay over $100 for a 2 person dinner.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,3,2,4,Hotyt4hVDRnxBATpSXBdVg

The group of us came here for our ""upscale"" meal the first night, and it was about everything I hoped it would be! Upon being seated, we were provided with a platter of 3 different kinds of fries with 3 different types of dips complimentary! I don't recall what each different kind of fries and dips (well, one was kethcup lol), but they all tasted great and got the meal started off right. 

For dinner, I decided to have the 10 oz Filet Mignon, along with a side of their charred asparagus. I must say, the Filet was incredible! A perfectly cooked medium, the meat melted in my mouth like butter, and had a nice seasoning crust on it as well. 10 oz might not sound like much, but it was more than filling, and the asparagus was great as well. 

Probably my only complaint, for such an expensive restaurant, the ambiance could have been a little more ""eye-catching', but the food was definitely up to par.

425942,2009-01-27,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"""MY God, what have I done to deserve this"", were the words I spoke when eating here. Being in Las Vegas, Nevada, a.k.a. Sin City, I knew that I had to atone for my sins, but I do not know what sin I could have committed to deserve this place! I can not tell you how many times I've been disappointed by restaurants that tout their great service and even better food, then come away feeling despondent.

However, this restaurant takes the proverbial cake, and a crap one at that!

Where to begin? After having been sitting at a table with my guest for 15 minutes, the waitress finally decided it was time to work. Realizing that she was indifferent, my guest and I ordered some red wine to numb the pain we knew lay ahead. When the wine came, it was as warm as the desert outside the hotel. Enduring this bit of pain, we decided to press our luck further.

I ordered the Kobe steak which after about 40 minutes of wondering when my food would show up, came most disappointingly. Kobe beef, the most rarified and king of all steaks, prepared properly medium rare, came out well done. Well done! I was horrified to see such splendor squandered. I decided to take a bite and tasted charcoal. I was livid. I found my nonexistent, indifferent waitress and demanded to see the manager.

A manager came round and apologized and brought me another Kobe steak, this time thankfully, faster than the last. When it finally arrived, it too suffered a cruel fate reserved only for witches in Salem. I spoke with the manager who brought out his manager. This new bloke apologized some more and took my meal off my bill. My bill? Yes, it seems I still had to pay for my guest whose food was only average. I feel that if one person's meal is ruined, everyone's is. Therefore everything should be taken care of. Sadly, Strip Steak doesn't think this way. Strip Steak simply doesn't think or cook for that matter. They can apologize well though.",9-bSz5P5kNL7rF1tVK7gOA,2,1,2,abhPNZReaD_iWsSKpiGfxQ

Duck fat fries - yum.  I wish they weren't so yummy because I could not come close to finishing my meal.

Foccacia - eh.  Everything else was better, so skip this and save room for the good stuff.

I got the beet salad with burratta cheese.  I must confess that I love burratta.  I want to take it home and cuddle with it.  When my husband asked for a bite of it, I had a serious internal debate before I decided that sharing was good for my marriage.  The beets were also delicious, but this was all about the cheese for me.  My husband got the wedge salad which was good but not anything out of the ordinary.

For dinner, I got the skirt steak and husband got the short rib.  The short rib was delicious and tender and well sauced.  But I won with the skirt steak.  Meltingly tender, deliciously seasoned.  We also got the scalloped potatoes and the mushrooms which were both fabulous, but the meat was totally the star.

We also had an excellent Spanish Rioja (a new kick we're on) recommended by the sommelier.  It was so good in fact, we reminisced about it the next night as we sat at the bar at Il Mulino while waiting for our table.  So good, that we determined that if the hostess couldn't get her act together and get us seated by the end of our cocktails, we would pay the check and hop in a cab back over to Mandalay.

So our second meal at Stripsteak was just as good.  I pretty much got the same thing again, but with the truffled mac n cheese instead of the potatoes.  Oh my was that good mac n cheese.  I will dream about that meal.

My husband got the bisque and the lamb and thoroughly enjoyed.  But we still agreed that the skirt steak was one of the best meats ever.

I was very pleased with the service from beginning to end, and loved the food. The meal started off with a complimentary appetizer of duck fat fries and special dipping sauces which was unlike any other flavor I've had. I also had the Caesar salad which was big enough to share, it tasted super fresh and made right for our order. I went with the ribeye (16oz) which was what I usually order at steak places, and I was only disappointed with not being able to finish my steak. You can tell that there is a lot of time and thought put into this initial process to cooking the steak, as they were displayed in the restaurant showing how some of the steaks are dry aged. Not only was my steak juicy, tender, and marbleized with those tasty fat pieces in side, but the char on the steak was just perfect. I also ordered the potato gratin and loved how cheesy and melt in your mouth it was, it is a little on the rich side so I would look to order a more toned down in flavor potato dish to go with it next time.

I am looking forward to visiting Las Vegas again soon because of this place...",d4gFDNCnjxrALK2LpKhvDg,0,0,5,7cneZSAvDYb7ZgGiZBBFqg

Fish dishes were all cold and when two people sent theirs back it was just reheated. They had traded some food and the plates came back with the same soggy food on it and looked awful! 
After all that, the manager blamed us!! She said the steak was the way THEY do medium (it was under cooked). Crab cakes soggy. Everything too salty and floating in olive oil. 
All they did was comp a couple of sides on an $800 bill.

531176,2013-04-10,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I'm a bit ambivalent about Stripsteak.  On one hand, their Scotch selection was very extensive and, for the Strip, reasonably priced.  Yes, the Scotch menu is a big thick book, like a Scotch for Dummies because it gives a complete history of every single distiller and a thorough description of every single malt from that distiller.  And if the Scotch for Dummies bible isn't enough, the bartender Chris was wonderfully knowledgeable about the vast selection of single malts.  Unfortunately, the bar isn't really a great setup - not a lot of stools at the bars, and the tables for the bar area felt like they were almost in the middle of the walkway leading to the Event Center.

On the other hand, the restaurant is a very comfortable space, but the food is awfully pricey.  Very good, but not sure it's worth the cost.  Well, except for the delicious duck fat fries (served instead of bread), which were complimentary.  I had a foie gras appetizer that was one of the most delicious variations on foie gras I've ever had (not that I can remember ever having a bad foie gras dish), but it was $32.  The 90-day-aged sirloin steak was $72 - very good, but I've had better steak at lower prices.  The grilled asparagus was really good, just a tad too expensive at $14.  I ordered dessert, but can't remember what it was, just that it was really good too (and obviously not the least bit memorable).  Again, our server was also terrifically knowledgeable about the restaurant's impressive Scotch menu.

So the vast and reasonably-priced single malt menu is worth going back for, but the bar isn't a great space.  The dining room is very comfortable, but the food menu is priced just high enough that I don't see myself going back there to eat.  If Stripsteak had better bar seating or slightly lower food prices, I'd be a die-hard regular.  As it is, I'll probably be back every once in a while.  If you're a single malt guy, Stripsteak's Scotch menu is too good to resist.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,1,0,4,Drxnug6vJy6MhDK5cuw6Bg

540077,2009-09-15,3,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"So you say you want to hear about this steak...well let me indulge you
in this experience... 14oz Bone-in Filet Mignon!

When it first arrives it seems a bit intimidating, bulky even. You see
this piece of meat and think, I see nothing special or glorious about
this, let alone why it would cost $57. If anything, this chunk of meat
would be thought dry due to being over-cooked, or too bloody from
being too thick to cook properly. So you first cut into it with your
average steak knife, and what do you find? 

This knife, though somewhat blunt, seamlessly slices through the thickness. The tenderness is AMAZING!! Not only that, there is no trail of blood typically found with such large portions of meat cooked over a fire. 

Then comes the first bite. Words can not truly describe the sensation, but the closest I can come up with is that it feels like a meatgasm in your mouth. Hahahaha but seriously, the flavour from the seasoning of the steak was phenomenal, robust and savory with a hint of a wood burned taste. Once you've slightly regained consciousness from the amazing flavour of the steak, you then realise the meat is moist and tender that it literally melts in your mouth. You chew with little to no
pressure and it still falls apart in your mouth, then mixing
completely in your mouth. 

But when you think it can't get any better,
you continue to chew thinking you never want this feeling in your
mouth to end. You eventually realise that it does need to end, that
you will need to swallow. It then becomes a bitter sweet moment, when you think of how you must end it by swallowing, but knowing there will be another to come soon afterwards. Yet when eating, the following bites are never as wondrous as the initial...except for this steak.

Each bite was as good as the first. Every single bite left me with the
same feelings as the first. And no matter how full I was becoming,
there was no hesitation in each bite, no thoughts of stopping due to
over-consumption. There was only one thought in mind...ME WANT MORE STEAK NOW!!! Even to the last bite, which I then cut into 3 more
pieces to try and extend this experience, it was wonderful throughout.
I will be back for this steak...",-BDOAmHvzE2w3SMfwlUN5A,3,3,5,Uj3lVHqlqU06T9_Ii9g-hQ

I was worried the thickness would not allow it to be cooked thoroughly but there was no pink to be found.  The mushroom risotto and pork jus accompanied the chop very well.

OMG whoever said this place is good has not had a true ""dry-aged"" steak at the very least. So this review is for those of you who have tasted TURE ""DRY-AGED"" Ribeye. You know that nutty NON-IRONY taste and weird yet interesting smell.
 
For the quality of food...it is WAY Overpriced. AND i dont usually complain about price as long as the food is outstanding tasting. Stripsteak is NOT! Definitely does not taste like a true ""DRY-AGED"" steak! I had the bone-in rib-eye and it tasted like Costco steak...which taste good....but not $51 for 18oz good. My Gf had the American Wagyu....terrible! No marblization no flavor punch...just another eye of rib taste. Ive had both ""Dry-aged"" bone-in rib-eye and Kobe steak before and the steaks at strip steak do not even near the realm of the taste you encounter when eating the true stuff....sooo dissappointed.
 
Lobster tail not at all fresh or worth the price. Roasted Mushrooms tasted too wierd...also too expensive as well. Scalloped potatoes...barely OK. Merlot Excellent! Their Focaccia bread thing was a heart-breaking waste of dough. Roasted Bone marrow was OK. French fries was your basic multy times fried re-hash fries...SUCK...BUT the sauces was Good & seasoning good!
 
All in all, just too over-priced for the type of food...the food served here is the same level as Outback steak house....Please believe me, i am not even joking. Please save your money and buy 3 ribeyes for $22 at costco....same taste...trust me! I wish this place did work out for us but sadly it failed horribly.

But this place was damn good! So if you are down to read this whole review, then please do so. If you don't want to read it, I don't really care because I am having fun just reliving the dining experience.

My sister and I wanted to take our parents here for xmas dinner. Michael Mina restaurant, right? Should be good! We had tickets for Cirque du Soleil's Ka (excellent, by the way) at 7PM so we were definitely on a time crunch. StripSteak does not open until 5:30PM. We called in a little bit early and told them our dilemma and the lady at the front desk said she'd make sure they'd get us out by 6:30. Excellent. We got there about 5:20 and were seated by 5:25. 

Our waitress came by and told us she was aware of the timing situation and took our orders immediately. She was really hot by the way. And no, I am not a lesbian. She seated us at a circular table surrounded by 5 comfy lounge looking types of chairs. They were a bit low but they offered us pillows to sit on or to use for our backs. It was very comfy!

On to the FOOD! Instead of offering the typical pre-meal dinner rolls, the waitress came out with 2 trios of fries. I have no idea what the fries were, but there were 3 types, each with their own dipping sauce. They were awesome! I almost wished she didnt give it to us because I filled up on so much fries when I could have made room for more of the luscious beef that was on its way. Now I must admit, I am a potato addict, so free potatoes was definitely a big plus for StripSteak. Even if I was not a potato fanatic, I think having something different from the typical dinner rolls makes the restaurant stand out from the average high-end steakhouse.

For our appetizer we ordered the Filet Tartare ($21). Waiter came out with the tartare and told us what garnishes would be going in . He mashed it up and came back with it all nice and pretty on a bed of ice in a small jar. It came with 4 pieces of pita bread. Very delicious!

For our entrees, my dad and sister's boyfriend ordered the 18 oz Rib Eye ($51 each). My sister ordered the prix fix menu for $55. It came with clam chowder, Prime Rib and samples of random sides, and Beignets. My mother and I shared the 30 oz Porterhouse ($69). For our sides we ordered the Spinach Souffle and Potato Puree Trio. Man o man, there is not one negative thing I could say about the food.  We ordered everything medium rare... and what do you have it... they were actually medium rare!!! The rib eye was absolutely delicious. Definitely one of the best cuts of rib eye I have ever tasted. The porterhouse was excellent as well. They had it cut up into slices for easy sharing between my mom and I. The filet part of the porterhouse was so juicy and tender. The prime rib was just as good. It was also nice to be able to try the 3 samples of sides that came with the prime rib - spinach, mac and cheese, brussel sprouts. All tasted great. The trio of mashed potatoes was unique. The flavors were lobster, sour cream and onion, and horseradish. I'm not a big fan of horseradish, but the sour cream and onion was absolutely amazing. 

The waitress was nice enough to ask us if we wanted the beignets to come after the meal or whenever they were ready since we were running out of time. We said to bring them out whenever they were ready. They were good but not spectacular. The rest of the meal was so amazing, I really didn't care. 

My sister had a restaurant.com coupon and knocked $50 off the meal. The total for the meal with $50 off and an 18% gratuity was $311. Not bad for such an awesome meal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It's a bit pricey but definitely offered some of the best steak I have ever had.

We walked into Mandy Bay and were greeted by the uber  friendly hostess.  With the dress she was wearing I'm surprised there wasn't a brass pole nearby. My icy cool composure kept my wife from throwing a Krav Maga style elbow to my head. But regardless, the male portion of my brain registered Awesome.(That was possibly an inapproriate thought on a special occasion. I sowwy) Anyhow,  We ended up with the most amazing romantic table in the back of the restaurant, tucked away and quiet.  

Our busser was quick to come by to get our drink orders and our waiter was close behind with the specials of the evening.  We ordered the filet and ribeye with the mac & cheese and spinach soufflé.  A Few minutes go by and the free wickedly good fries showed up.  BAZINGA! I ended up having to go the little boys room and upon my return I was stopped dead in my tracks by the death gaze from my wife. I mean laser beams, ears with steam coming out of them, the works! 
I looked around and now sat next to us was a table full of screaming satan's spawn. 6 of them and the parents. AT STRIPSTEAK? ARE YOU F'ing SERIOUS?  
The death stare got the attention of the waiter who looked over and said we will get you another table:) As he turned, all of our food was coming out. He told the other waiters that we were moving and the food went back.  A few short minutes later we were in our new quiet serene home and the food arrived perfectly. The wait staff and management was amazing. Even if the food was craptastic I'd still come back because of how great they were to us. 
We both enjoyed our steaks, which were seasoned perfectly and very tender but I still prefer N9ne or Brand for my carnivorous tastebuds. The sides were amazing, the Sommelier was on the money and place was just great. We will certainly be back and we will add it to our nom nom rotation.

Walking in, we were greeted warmly and escorted to our table, which was in view of the glass wall where you could see the grill. pretty cool.

The waiter was a nice enough fellow, but after going through the menu (since it was our first time) I asked him what his favorites were. He seemed a bit miffed by that and told me to just listen to the rest of his speech.  And the rest of his speech basically constituted of the specials.

We got the mac and cheese, spinach souffle, creamed spinach, and potato gratin for sides.  A buddy and I shared the bone in porterhouse.  Everything was good, not great.

We were able to be seated without a reservation, about 6:30. We ordered two glasses of Pinot Noir at $15 a piece. Our server told us we would be receiving a complimentary appetizer that evening. The appetizer were duck fat cooked french fries, done three ways. The fries were amazing, each seperately dished, seasoned and they each came with their own dipping sauce. Really tasty. Due to the pricing, my mother in law and I decided to share one of the larger steaks and order two seperate sides. I believe we ordered the 16 oz Kansas City Strip. $50+ for the one steak, a la carte. The steak was cooked to order, medium rare.

Now, on to why I am rating three stars. I LOVE steak, cooked many different ways. The steak had a nice charred crust, which I love. But, it tasted like charred, burnt butter, which delivered a very unpleasant, bitter, chary taste which I was not expecting with a steak of this caliber. It was seriously unpleasant and I having to try hard to eat it all. 

Otherwise, we ordered the brussel sprouts which were AMAZING in their bacony, vinegary goodness. We also ordered baked Artichoke with goat cheese, which were also amazing, but personally, I would have ordered double brussel sprouts. 

Onto desert, I cannot personally recall the name of the dish, but I know it came with cocoa nib ice cream which was heavenly. 

Our service was excellent, and we had a very pleasureable dining experience. It can get a little loud, but the ambiance is excellent. 

So 3 stars due to the over excessive pricing and the charred taste of the steaks. Otherwise, it was great!",Ef6GGxdv-AoTmwP93lTQmw,0,0,3,vyu_PmuDFb-1hjOJrAW8GA

Our server had a large table and a couple other small ones in addition to us, so taking as long as she did to get our orders is forgiveable.  She was friendly and responsive when we did see her, so I'm sure it was just a tough night.

The hostesses were less pleasant, mumbling responses and then practically ignoring us.  If we hadn't had reservations for dinner and tickets to a show right after, I would have gone somewhere else right then.

Now let's get to the great part - the food!  We both had steaks, one a filet and the other a ribeye, both of which were expertly cooked to order.  He added shrimp and I crab legs, neither of which was as large as I'm used to, being from the coast.  But it's understandable this far inland, and both were cooked and seasoned well.

We each ordered a side, mushrooms and broccolini, and let me tell you, each was large enough to serve two people.  I was definitely impressed with those portion sizes.

Cocktails were nothing special, tho the Scottish stout beer my other half enjoyed was the best he's had.  The dessert menu looked nice, but nothing really jumped out at us.

Overall, it was a nice experience.  Perhaps I'm too ""small-town"" to enjoy the full Vegas Strip experience, but this was a good meal and a great precursor to a FABULOUS Cirque show.  I would recommend this restaurant to others heading to Vegas.",-E_gdMuBKaGrUu7N_Vfu-g,0,0,4,U5e5Kvv1Jp4yAhCdU_fDRg

We got the sashimi appetizer and the ""bacon"" (I forget the name) appetizer. The sashimi was fresh and had some jalapeños for a little kick, and the bacon deal was just flat perfect.

I had the Angus filet medium rare which was cooked to perfection, tender, well marbled...basically they took a perfect filet and made it better.

Not just the apps, but the duck fat fries, the foccacia, the truffeled mac and cheese, even the steaks!! Don't get me wrong-the food was good. But dear lord-I think I sent my blood pressure through the roof with all the salt. It was crazy. Literally, every dish!!! Except my mint chocolate chip ice cream that i had for dessert.

I'm sure the cut of steak we chose also helped, we both had the ribeye cap.  The cap is the ultra rich and soft outside layer of the ribeye.  The part that I normally save for last because I like it so much.  This is the only place I've ever heard of that serves just the cap.  It was amazing!

Overall, our dining experience was wonderful....... Food, service, price!
Now on to the actual review:
5:30pm reservation time, showed up early for a little HH cocktail and was promptly seated for dinner soon thereafter. Our server, although very soft spoken and a little difficult to hear, was attentive and nice! He gave us the perfect amount of time to order, and the food started to flow out of the kitchen.
Compliments from the chef: duck fat fries: hello?!? Heaven in my mouth!
1st course: Kobe beef tartare- beautiful presentation! Tartare came out on a plate with the quail egg set atop with all the mix ins surrounding. Our food runner gracefully mixed the tartare and placed it in a chilled glass. Grilled pita bread to go with. We both decided that the pita bread and the tartare were great........ Separately! The pita bread masked the steak when eated together.
2nd course (his): wedge salad: wow! Crispe cups of iceberg lettuce, bacon, blue cheese dressing (which was not too ""blue cheesy""), and pickled shallots.
2nd (mine): hearts of romaine, which I automatically pegged for their version of a caesar salad. It was and it wasn't. The menu states ""olive"" dressing....... After my first bite, I remembered that olives are not my most favorite....... My fault!
Main entree (his): rack of lamb. Perfect mid-rare with the most incredible rosemary sauce drizzled over the top.
Mine: grilled scallops: cooked nicely...... Nothing over the top. My very last bite did have a grain of sand which sends chills down my spine, but it was just the one. I appreciate the work, talents, and dedication of the prep all the cooks/ chefs to back there do before service starts. One graine of sand won't kill me.
Sides: Brussels sprouts with bacon-de-lish! Potato purée: sour cream- average, lobster- incredible, horseradish- in between.
Dessert (his): beignets with 18 yr scotch butterscotch pudding- the pudding was amazing. You got all the favors of both the scotch and the butterscotch. Perfect pair!
Mine: mascarpone cheesecake: the best cheesecake I've ever had! Huckleberry compote, shortbread crumble, and candied kumquat peel...... Amazing!
all savory food came out very quickly, almost too quickly. By the time dessert came around, service drastically slowed down. As I stated at the beginning of this review, I'm in the industry, so I see both sides of it.
At the end of the day, would I go back? Absolutely!!!
Other reviews state that the price is to high, blah, blah,...... But you need to remember, you're not just paying for that steak on a plate..... You're paying for the technique of food preparation, service and everything in between. So, if you're worried about how much money you're going to spend, don't go out to a restaurant like this because you'll leave pissed off when in all actuality everything was great until the bill was dropped.

Our group of 4 arrived at 7:15 and there was a bit of confusion about our reservation (I made it online) but the manager figured it out and took us to our table which was a bit small for 4, but it worked.  We were immediately impressed that the manager asked us where we were from, why we were in Vegas, etc. and really tried to get to know us.  Turned out he used to work in Scottsdale, gave us his card, and gave us passes to the nightclub upstairs.  He was very nice and accommodating.

Our service was awesome too!  Our actual server knew just about everything there was to know about the menu and the wine and the cocktails and our bussers were on top of the stuff with water refills and clearing our table.  I was impressed.  

I ordered a cocktail but I can't remember the name...It was good though!

The food was great! We all ordered something different, so we were hesitant to buy a bottle of wine.  The table came with complementary duck fat fries which were the best thing ever!!!!  They were soo good!  All the dips and the seasonings were paired so well, we finished them off in no time.  

I ordered the scallops with the side of mac & cheese and they both were amazing!  The scallops were cooked perfectly, moist, delicate and tender!  The mac and cheese was creamy and just delicious.  It might have been the best part.  We also ordered a side of the artichokes with goat cheese and although I love artichokes and I love goat cheese, this dish just didn't really do it for me.  

We also ordered the organic half grilled chicken, which I tried and though was very moist and tender (almost too tender...), the 8oz America Wagyu Rib Cap, which was pretty small and tasted like ribs (no surprise) and the 16oz Kansas City Strip.

839024,2011-05-06,3,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Greetings from your resident picky eater.  I know you are probably surprised to see me write a review of a steak house considering I don't like steak and normally these hoyty toyty establishments do not cater to those with a palate of a five year old.  

Let me set the scene.  My husband advised me he is taking me out to dinner yet would not tell me where.  This alarms me because after knowing each other for nine years he still tries to surprise me by taking me to placing such as Prime Rib Loft and PF Changs.  Guess where we are going??  StripSteak.  Apparently, you can get a coupon on restaurants.com and so he wanted to give it a try.  Panic sets in as I am worried what will I eat.. again I don't like steak and I especially don't like a steak I would have to pay $50 dollars for.  My husband Michael assures me he has looked over the menu and told me they have chicken dishes and even mac & cheese.

Upon arrival we are seating and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable.  Michael had advised them we are there to celebrate my birthday.  It was two weeks ago but if I know my husband he was hoping to get a free dessert out of it.  There was a very nice happy birthday card placed at our table which I thought was a very nice touch.  

Looking at the menu.. oh dear oh dear there is ONE chicken dish.. not chicken dishes (plural) as Michael had indicated.  Organic chicken it is.  Michael opts for the kobe beef burger.  I order a corona and Michael orders a Pepsi.  (Stay tuned as the Pepsi will come into play later on in my story)

We are then provided a sample of the duck fat fries three ways with three different dipping sauces.  They consisted of old bay seasoned fries, rosemary garlic type fries, and plain duck fat fries.  The sauces were some mustard crème nonsense (which kind of tasted like ranch), ketchup, and truffle aioli.  May I just say that the truffle aioli was amazing.  Who would have thought it would win over ketchup in my mind.  While enjoying our delicious fries, Michael is especially entertained in watching the people constantly stop to take pictures at their famous boob sculpture in the walkway to the Conference Center. 

Meal arrives.  My plate is very fancy with some onion jus drizzled around the plate and a lovely piece of chicken on top of some truffle mac & cheese.  Michael wastes no time diving into his kobe burger for which I think he foodgasmed after the first bite.  Now my chicken report.  It was delicious!!! So moist and flavorful - it better be for $30 bucks.  It had nice grill char marks on it which added to the flavor profile.  The mac and cheese was good as well but alert.. there were two broccoli thingies mixed in it and a couple of baby carrots!  This was not an invited guest to the party and I did not appreciate them hiding out under the chicken to surprise me.  Luckily I was able to remove most of the little tree top specs and continue with my meal without incident.  I decided to share my chicken with Michael.... ""This is not a normal chicken!"" he says as I think he was shared a spiritual moment with my chicken.  He then tried one of my baby carrots and asked for another.  Against my better judgment I tried the smallest of bites possible of the carrot and holy cow it didn't even taste like a carrot.  It almost melted in my mouth - probably all the butter it was drenched in.  I that that was the first time I eat a carrot since I was forced to stay at the table until I finished them when I was 8.  

The meal has now ended.  Our waiter asks if we would like to order dessert.  Although the $700 glass of cognac was tempting we decided to pass.  Michael was looking around wondering where is my happy birthday scoop of ice cream?  We then get the bill and I think Michael about had a heart attack.  Remember the Pepsi I mentioned earlier?  Well apparently they are $4 - each.   Michael had four of them because they are served in those skinny bar glasses that you could finish in one sip!  So he paid $16 bucks for Pepsi (not even Coke!) That was $9 less then my Corona.  I found it quite funny.  We did however receive two small bags of some sort of chocolate drizzled caramel popcorn which I didn't get the connection but thought was nice.  

To summarize, although places like this are not my cup of tea I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Be forewarned if ordering a soda that it is by the glass.  If I could offer any suggestions it would be to perhaps replace the broccoli bits with bacon in the truffle mac & cheese.  Even with our $50 coupon we ended up paying about $50 dollars out of pocket (thanks to Michael's soda binge) but this is a nice place for special occasion.",GbHckhaFyxErPGKAP0PJQw,2,2,4,3Bh6eANO4BC6CIF4hLjc-w

I notified the waitress to tell her manager so they could check it after closing before it got bad. She offered to move our table which we declined because it was so small it was no biggy, we just wanted to make sure they checked it before it became a problem. For this they bought us desert and sent us back to our room with candied popcorn and cheese cake. They didn't have to do this because the water was really no big deal, but that is just the kinda place this place is. The service was just that good.

i loved the meat fridge where you see all the aged steaks

we also loved the complimentary fries they send over with 3 dipping sauces that i guess replaces traditonal bread and were very tasty.

i had a 16 once kansas city steak which was perfectly cooked (rare of course), bone in and was very tasty. we wanted to try the special sauces that come with the steak and ended up paying $6 for the trio of sauces that were just ok.
 honeslty - you can give a 3rd of the amount they gave in each jar and just offer a sauce for free....you pay $50 for steak.....they can add a little sauce free of charge which will be much classier

my wife had a kobe beef burger which was tasty. (we had already kobe beef burgers before and we always feel its stupid and waist of good beef as you cant tell the difference....you can use regular beef and add 30% fat and will get the same result and fraction of the price)

We both had the filet. For $59 you would expect it to be perfectly cooked and look like a great cut of meat. Well that was not the case. My filet looked like a hacked up piece of meat on a plate. For a steak house you expect it to look edible. I was a little weary too because I ordered medium and it came out more rare to medium rare. That being said the flavor was good. Needed more seasoning but I ate most of it. Not overly impressed for a Michael Mina restaurant

Sides were great. I'd skip the fried sweet potatoes. While they are shoe string they had almost a powdery taste but the spicy fried rice, mushrooms and Mac and cheese were all excellent sides the four of us at them all minus the sweet potatoes.

We ordered our main dishes....I had the special of the day which was halibut (42) and the boyfriend ordered the kobe filet ($72). We also ordered a side of the truffle mac n cheese (about $12)
Our food came out pretty quickly and we dug right in.  The food presentation was great and the food was hot which is important.
I had a bite of the boyfriends steak and i have to say it was pretty darn good.  It was cooked exactly how he requested it.  I am not a huge meat eater, but i had to try a bite of that $72 steak.
By the time we were done with our food we were too full to even think about dessert. (the dessert menu had some tasty looking options)
Out waiter took the restaurant.com certificate no problem.

We had a great experience at Stripsteak and would definitely consider coming back here next time we are in Vegas.",EfJyAI_5jZDs7-imubpByA,3,0,5,9nJ1oyYgFwGJTet0a12kSg

I can get an idea for what this place emphasizes and it's not service.

Let me list our problems with our visit to this establishment:

1) Eternal waiting: our server took his time to make it to our table. The staff took their time delivering bread and drinks to us. 

Once we ordered, it was at least 45 minutes, possibly longer, before our entrees were delivered to us. We discovered somehow that the kitchen chose to first serve a large group that arrived later than we did. No apologies, no visits from the manager, no ""make ups.""

2) Dishonesty: While waiting outside we had noticed the prix-fixe menu stated the rib eye was a 12-oz, while the rib eye a-la carte was 18-oz. That was reasonable for the price (which was roughly comparable); some in our party chose the a-la carte and others chose prix-fixe.

When the entrees finally came, to our surprise there were no differences in the size of our steaks. When we inquired of the waiter he stated that the steaks were the same size regardless of prix-fixe or a-la carte. When we then pointed out that if we had known, all of us would have ordered the prix-fixe, he did not respond.

3) Food: the best part of the meal, honestly, was the fries. The spinach souffle is nasty. And having been to Mastro's, Ruths Chris, Lawry's, and Flemings, the steak is overpriced for its quality. 

Easy to say we aren't coming back and I hope this review drives foot traffic elsewhere.",bc4uFFwtzGHC7TpjURPAeg,1,0,1,xTTU1zrRiKf0ZrJJow8rpQ

the service was well above average. although the staff did give a bit of preferential attention to the larger, spendier groups, we were not neglected in any way.

the decor was pretty straightforward and clean.  better than the dark wood and antlers decorations in many steak houses (i guess not being ""angus"" beef helped that ;)  they have a wide selection of high quality seafood to complement the beef, but before you bring your pesca-friends, know that they've got sides of beef curing in coolers that are visible from most seats.

all in all, it was a pretty ideal setting and dinner. 5 star all the way.

so, what went wrong?

my steak.  as previously mentioned, ryan and i ordered the exact same thing.  we got two very, *very* different pieces of meat.  while his was perfectly medium rare, solid, and tiny bits of heaven, mine was...less so.  it was what i would consider medium, not nearly as tender, and felt more like a poor cut of meat that was reshaped to filet form.  

it might not have been a filet. it might not have been wagyu (there was a lower tier of meat on the menu).  when i mentioned it to the waiter (after only having a few bites), he mentioned that the ribbons of fat through the meat sometimes make it looked more ""cooked"" than it was, and as long as it was medium-rare tender, it was fine.  i didn't press later, when it became clear it was an inferior piece of meat (my husband gave me a large piece of his to enjoy), and i think i could have and been compensated in some form.

so, 3 stars.  i don't believe the restaurant tried to pull on over on us (because logically, you don't do that to the table that ordered identical dishes), although the waiter may have fed me a bit of a line to try and cover, which is forgivable.  in any case, i believe that if i had known more about steak in general and could have spoken with more authority, it would have been quickly rectified.",XN7GVORBtwkcq4zfhIALqg,1,1,3,ruMLSgH-0XECwsK6ii55Iw

Pros:

- Wagu Burger (medium rare) was delicious.

Cons:
- My Kansas city steak (New York Steak) was not good.  Had to send it back.  They gave me a refund so at least customer service was good.  
- My friend's chicken was dry and not good.
- Grill Fois Gras had a very weird taste to it.  Not as buttery and seemed like it was just seared on the outside make the inside a bit undercooked.

the wagyu rib cap was the best steak i've ever had. and the service was excellent. our server, katy, made the dinner a complete 5-star experience.

***long version***

as i walked in i asked our server if i could finish my can of beer at the table. ""sure"", katy said flashing a smile. yeah, i'm cheap and i hate spending money on expensive steaks and drinks. i was set to order one of the cheapest things on the menu (kobe burger at $20), when i mentioned to her that i've been disappointed every time i ordered a $30+ steak. she replied that their rib cap was the best steak she's ever had. she tried to explain what a rib cap was, but her friendliness was so disarming that i ordered it without fully understanding where on the cow the meat was coming from. i normally like medium, but i know medium-rare should be the way to go. she suggested something in between: medium-rare plus. i doubted her cooks' skills but she assured me that their temperature control was outstanding.

what's a rib cap? i had to look it up when i got home. on a chunk of roast there's the familiar rib-eye loin and then that layer of fat along the top. when you cut away the eye, there's quite a bit of meat still attached to the fat. that's the rib-cap.

out came the meat, and i immediately cut into it. it wasn't running blood, but it was still full of that that happy pink center you expect from a gently-cooked steak. (medium-rare plus!) after a vigorous discussion with my tablemates we settled on a description of the rib-cap: the robust flavor of the rib-eye, the tenderness of a filet, and the mouth-melting fat of pork belly. a trifecta worth the $60. the sides were awesome, but i couldn't stop loving each bite of my steak.

katy checked in, and i was impressed that the product delivered. she noticed my can of pale ale was out, and suggested i try an ipa. wine just wouldn't do with this steak, and i got the feeling that katy was a beer kinda girl. i mentioned to the server extraordinaire, that the only problem i had with the rib-cap was after the first bite and subsequent beefy fatness melted and coated your mouth, the excitement of the next bite was slightly diminished. 

katy went back to the kitchen and brought out a small serving of coconut sorbet as a kind of intermezzo, palate cleanser. so my last bite was just like my first.",ALdJJ3iydaHS3FW86YXz7A,0,1,5,4Brrgy-wBpV3Wa7HHESS1w

We then shared a wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon....very good and classic starter.  The steaks came out... mine ala cart and hers with a few sides ( the special) They were both cooked on the flaming grill which could be viewed from the dining room. the sides of truffled mac and cheese , the brussel sprouts with bacon and the spinach with..... you guessed it  .... bacon!!  were all good. Really though how can you go wrong with adding bacon??? the wait staff were very nice, and our waiter even gave us a few samples of wine to try before we made our decision ( I like that) 
  On to the highlight!  My steak was a little more fatty than marbled, a little undercooked (which they fixed) and a little smaller than other 18oz ribeyes I have had ( the aging ??) anyway I could have had a bad piece as the filet was very tender and flavorful ( this was a great restaurant week deal) and the special even came with a mini creme brulee and 2 beignets.

While we were seated promptly, I felt our waiter was a bit slow to take our order and check up on us from time to time.

Maybe this is a conspiracy, but these guys serve duck fat fries seasoned 3 ways with 3 types of dipping sauces instead of bread. These thing are fantastic and most likely if you do not control yourself you will get full off these things. That's just my theory. Either way, out of a group of 7, 4 ordered off the prix fixe menu, one got the kobe burger, one a wagyu steak, and one the pork loin. Everything was cooked very well and tasty to boot. I had the 18oz bone-in ribeye off the prix fixe menu, along with the iceberg lettuce salad. The salad was surprisingly good. The steak was large and juicy.

The first was a steamed and chilled lobster cocktail for $24.  When the waiter brought it to our table, it was a major disappointment.

It's not the most inviting thing to hear your server introduce you to duck-fat french fries but WOW, are they consumable.

StripSteak took the place of my beloved 3950 Steakhouse at Mandalay Bay. While 3950 will also be close to  my heart and stomach, StripSteak is a great runner-up.

I have eaten here five or so times and it has been excellent service and amazing food everytime. The staff is inviting and friendly.

I recommend the burrata & beets (everyone knows I am infatuated with the melt-in-your-mouth-mozzarella-of-choice).

If you want to save room for drinks and some donuts... or as some say beignets, split a steak and add a crab leg.

The side portions are ample. The steak, supple. The crab, succulent.

I'm a traditionalist and prefer the filet instead of ribeye or the other guys. Can't go anywhere nowadays without seeing mac n' cheese on the menu. Don't miss theirs though. Chunks of broccoli, the essence of truffles and a perfectly rich cheese (gruyere I think?) make it memorable.

They serve Chat. Lynch-Bages by the glass. Love it.

We have been here with 2 people up to 10 people. They are very accommodating with any size. Only downfall... it looks like a high-end cafeteria. Nothing intimate about the place. If you are coming with a group of at least six guests, I would recommend requesting a booth so you aren't in the middle of the restaurant... then again the walls around it are clear acrylic.

There are only two restrooms TOTAL. Have to venture out into the casino if someone is taking forever.

Usually it's good, not the best steak, but good enough.  Last year they served us two ribeye's that were full of gristle.  Left half the steaks on the plate and chalked it up as a bad cut.  We could care less, we're there to bet on football and drink.  The server saw we left half of a $140 steak dinner and was kind enough to offer us a couple of drinks which we appreciated, says a lot for the service.

Only reason I'm sharing this is that it's not a $65 steak in case you're planning some special event with the old lady.  

We're heading back next weekend for the start of football season (thank god) and are looking for a good steak house.  Guess we'll try the MGM or NY NY.  Too bad, we always stay at Mandalay Bay and this place was really convenient.  

If the chef changes something let us know, we'd be glad to give it another try.

REVISED:  The restaurant manager sent a very nice email asking us to give it another try.  We will definitely do that as they were all extremely nice and all we're looking for is a great steak that we don't have to leave the casino for.

1220723,2017-03-06,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Wow. What a meal. Upon arrival, the restaurant had prepared several small but meaningful items to celebrate the special dinner my girlfriend and I were enjoying. Rose at the table, signed card, the works.

The ambience is not quite 'fine' fine dining, more of a contemporary steakhouse. Not a bad thing at all, just be advised if you're looking for truly romantic, this is probably not it. Regardless, the food befits the title of fine dining without any consideration.

Began with the short rib ravioli. While smaller in portion, the flavor was unparalleled, including the apples and carrots included. Highly recommended.

As for steak, spend the money. It's a fair bit, but do it DO. IT. I'm talking, of course, about the Mishima reserve wagyu. The rib cap was divine. Melt in your mouth, lose your mind perfection. It doesn't quite stand to A5 kobe, but the price differential between the two may as well be the Grand Canyon. A bernaise sauce complements the steak well. I recommend the medium rare wagyu rib cap.

Sides. Oh my God, sides. If you don't order the potatoes au gratin, you're a fool. Plain and simple. I probably gained 2 pounds from this side alone, and I don't care. One of the best sides in the city. Period. 

Oh crap, almost didn't mention the complimentary duck fat fries with tasting sauces. If you've never had these, you've never had fries. This redefines the experience.

You will absolutely pay for this meal. And it is absolutely worth it. I'll be back again...and again...and again!

THE WAIT...
After we sat down it took what seemed like forever to get water, not to mention the time it took to order drinks. 

THE WINE MENU...
The wine menu is on an iPad now, and the user interface is dreadful. It felt like a chore to try  maneuver the application. I'm 31 years old and my boyfriend is a web designer- we're pretty tech savvy, and found the app to be a pathetic piece of junk. 

THE WAIT CONTINUES...
After we ordered our drinks it took at least 25 minutes for our server to come back to take our order. In the meantime we saw him dicking around and taking pictures with another table for at least a good 10 minutes. 

When our waiter, followed by the manager, finally came to our table we asked to order. We also inquired about the fries they serve at the tables, because we were starved after sitting there for about 45 minutes. The waiter said the kitchen was really backed up so it was out of his control, but the manager had no problem getting them for us, which wasn't surprising because all of the tables seated after us had already been served.

THE FOOD...
Six people ordered steak, four of which were the filet mignon, and no one was impressed. My boyfriend and I each ordered the salmon, which was okay, but definitely not worth the price or the wait. The side dishes were lukewarm, the vegetables were very oily, and we abandoned them half-eaten on the table.

My friends and I make it a point to have a few nice dinners whenever we all go to Vegas together. This used to be a staple on our trips, but it would take a lot of convincing to get me to go back after this alar visit.

This thick tome was organized by the regions of Scotland. Each section focused on a distillery with a small bit of history and trivia about the place, then listed the scotches, with tasting notes. I was able to try several that I never heard of.

1261968,2010-10-11,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Here's the short version: Worst possible dining experience, no exaggeration. Wrong reservation, terrible service, bad food, and promises broken for a business dinner with our best client.

Here's the long version: Came here for a business dinner for our most important client on a recommendation. We made our reservation for their private dining area 2 months in advance to coincide with a trade show. Confirmed our reservation a week or two in advance as well. 

I checked in with the hostess with about half of our 20+ party there. They said our table would be ready soon and to let them know when our entire party was there. Our entire party arrived about 5 minutes later and I informed them that all were present and she said our table would be ready in a few minutes. After another 5 minutes I check to see if our table was ready. Said it would be soon, just a few minutes. After another 5 minutes I asked about our table and again the answer was soon. Not a good thing to keep a large group and important clients waiting 15 minutes for a private room that was supposed to be reserved. 

Finally we were told our tables were ready but it was just that, normal tables in their regular dining area. We informed them that their must be a mistake since we specifically reserved their private dining room. We were given some attitude and told that we were mistaken but they would look into it. They quickly learned from their group reservation department that their was some sort of lack or mix-up of communication between them and the hostess. The general manager shows up and began to sweat and apologize to us a thousand times. 

Nothing could be done at the time because they had already given away tables in their private dining area. There was only an approximate estimate of an hour wait to move to that area. We decided to start at the tables we had and move if the private area became available soon. 

Fortunately they said they would be able to move us to the private area after 20 minutes so we headed over. Unfortunately it was not a private room but just a semi-private area partially enclosed by glass walls. And there were still some other diners in the area but we were assured the tables would remain empty once they finished. 

After all of this drama I thought to myself ""hopefully the food is AMAZING and redeems this entire mess."" However, I was thoroughly disappointed. The blue crab chowder was too salty, the prime rib was mediocre at best (I'd rather have Bellagio buffet prime rib), and the desserts were forgetful. 

In addition, the service was pretty poor. A number of us had finished our drinks and had empty glasses on our table. They remained empty on our table for at least 20-30 minutes. When I had my water refilled I asked them to take away my other empty glass. It was taken away but all of the other empty glasses were ignored. It was bizarre to me that this simple task was overlooked, especially after the general manager said that he would make sure that we were taken care of and serviced well. He also mentioned that he would give us additional drinks and food and not charge us. After we received the final bill that didn't seem to be the case and it looked like we were charged the full amount. 

What added insult to this all was that the other tables in our semi-private dining area didn't remain empty, they continued to fill them with new diners. We spent about $5000 for the worst possible dining experience on clients who do over $50 million in business with us.",o4doq_xtRGNRALX_L0JS8g,0,0,1,lfYPZsL8uvCN-1F6y7BZvQ

1308363,2011-04-24,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"The following review is based on one dinner experience:

FOOD: 5 stars

Appetizer - Trio of Duck Fat Fries
Each meal is preceded by a complimentary order of the trio of duck fat fries.  The trio includes:

1.  Paprika and mustard fries accompanied with a mustard crème dip
2. Truffle fries accompanied with truffle aïoli dip
3. Rosemary and onion fries accompanied with onion ketchup dip

My taste buds couldn't really tell the difference between duck fat fries and fries cooked in regular vegetable oil.  The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The fries aren't particularly better than any other restaurant quality fries, but they make for a nice ""complimentary"" appetizer while waiting for your meal.  

There's more than enough pics of the fries on Yelp so you can get a glimpse of the appearance and presentation.  


Entrees:

The steak entrees have a very simple presentation with just the meat, a grilled scallion, and grilled yellow pepper on a large plate.  Both steaks smelled like they were hot off the grill.  

1. 16oz Dry-Aged Bone In Rib Eye (medium well)  $51

This particular steak is more fatty than the Filet Mignon and Kansas City Strip.  The fattiness contributes to the melts in your mouth factor.  Not a piece of this meat had that dry chewy quality that separates good steaks from bad steaks.  I'm not sure how the meat was seasoned, but there was a subtle spiciness that enhanced the flavor of the meat.  

2. 10oz Filet Mignon (medium well)  $54

This steak was my favorite.  Once again the meat was tender and flavorful.  Although it wasn't fatty like the rib eye, it was still amazingly moist and melted in my mouth.  


SERVICE: 5 stars

Our server was very quick, attentive, and friendly.  She was all about enhancing ""the experience"".   She was also accommodating to all our special requests and knowledgeable.  What I thought was cool about this place was that when I asked for another side of the mustard for the fries, they didn't just bring me a small cup, but decent sized bowl.  

I thought it was kind of annoying though that as we left, every person who worked there said goodnight to us.  I understand the concept of service, but having all your employees say good night to customers who they had no interaction with comes off as a bit fake.  

I noticed some reviewers complaining that service was slow.  They must have gone during a busy weekend because we were quickly seated and had no issues with slow service.  


Misc. Info:

Stripsteak is good for a date, dinner with friends, or a celebration dinner.  It's not super formal, but I wouldn't come here wearing shorts and a wife beater.  

If you come with a date, you're likely to be seated near the bar where they have more seating for 2.  Most of the restaurant seems organized based on seating groups.

As for that mac and cheese... I've had better.  It was tasty enough, but maybe they can add some bacon or something else besides peas to make it more interesting.  The cheese was good.  

My husband had the Wagyu burger.  I had a bite of that, and I wish I ordered that instead. The meat was YUM.  And half the price of my filet mignon.  Not that price is an issue at a steakhouse, but I expect more at this price point.

Then came the main course. One of my friends and I shared the lamb which our waiter had recommended. They split it up onto two plates for us which was nice and actually, the lamb was pretty good. I'm not sure if it was really good or if it was just the best out of what I tried that night. I definitely had better lamb before though but this one was not bad. I ordered it medium rare and it came out just right. The mac-n-cheese that our waiter said was ""amazing"" was far from it. It was alright, tastes like mac-n-cheese I could make from a box. What I really didn't like was the broccoli in it. The broccoli flavor overpowered the mac-n-cheese in my opinion. Definitely not ""amazing"".  

Two of my friends ordered steak and one ordered the smoked salmon. She said it was alright but couldn't finish it because it wasn't that good. She was actually sick the next morning. 

This restaurant was definitely not the experience I was expecting based on the other reviews. The service was slow and the food was nothing special. If I'm going to pay that much for dinner I expect everything to taste good if not great. Definitely pass and go to Craftsteak instead.",M-OyDg7UU0RKJh70GkDuHQ,1,0,2,VoZPnrPkQH6sea7_b8ga4g

oh yes, it is THAT good.  when i eat steak, i am normally put off by if it is kind of hard and dry, if it is overcooked, etc, etc, etc...i am pretty picky and can't eat more than 3-5oz of steak when it isn't done well or if it isn't tender enough...

i have no idea where they got the meat and what the heck they did do it but DAMN whatever it is, wow.  if only they had another location in Los Angeles, i think i would eat here at least once every 2-3weeks!  i get to go to Vegas 2times a year for business and the hubby and i snuck out of town on a last minute whim and ended up at the Mandalay Bay.  he is a steak man so we decided to try this place and our eyes bulged when i saw the prices.

BUT, this is Vegas after all, and after all the crappy uber expensive restaurants i have tried at the Palazzo like Carnevino and Morels (which SUCKED SUCKED SUCKED and you totally get ripped off) the prices here are downright reasonable!  

we almost ate at BOA Steakhouse at the Caesars Palace which i tried before and was pretty happy with...this place is A LOT BETTER!  

my hubby ordered the 30oz porterhouse while i had the prix fix menu and upgraded to the rib eye....we both ate in bliss, and i have to say the quality of the meat made every bite worth it and money extremely well spent.  

honestly, the soup was so so, the 3 types of fries was DELISH, the bread was meh...it truly was all about the steak.  

it was prepared so well, and the tenderness, and the taste...hard to do justice -and the best part is by reading the other reviews i was clued in to the restaurant.com discount so for my next trip to vegas this july i pd $20 for a $50 gift card...SO SO SO SO SO SO awesome!  

thank you yelp and yelp reviewers...

for anybody that really enjoys a great cut of steak that is expertly cooked, forgot all the other places, this is THE place to go.  worth every penny.  me and the hubby had to practically roll ourselves out of there and we had two giant grins from ear to ear that lasted for days because of this meal.

The creamed corn was so-so. The corn seemed chopped up and the texture wasn't that great. It was also a little too sweet (and not natural corn sweetness). The creamed spinach was also very delicious.

All I have to say is OMG! This could be an entree. Unreal. I want to cry thinking about it. On a 1-10, this dish for me was a 9.5 (10 doesn't exist). Finally... another chart topper, the Beignets! Wow! They are served warm and they have two sauces with them... a butterscotch (amazing), a creme brulee (pretty good), and my favorite, the chocolate (which sadly they for some reason no longer serve - crazy!) Overall, an amazing experience every time.",43mw4n9eZA5o8_hiwZIulQ,1,1,5,UwuGTOzZhAK4yXjQD4QfzQ

1507208,2012-02-18,7,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"First off, for those that are confused - the Steaks at this restaurant do not actually strip, nor is this a strip club although there are several poles in the area which some guests seem to enjoy climbing onto.

Anyway, when you enter this palace, you're initially greeted by a waiter who while nice, has just enough condescension, and general annoyance at your hopefully great (and perhaps alcoholically induced) mood, to let it show. That's the first mistake. These guys are not fun. They're here to give you their song and dance on their Steak and other assorted bits and pieces. You better pay attention.

And so they do...""First, we spank the Cow for 30 days, until she is good and angry, and then we marinate her in a garlic olive oil arugula salad, while poking her with a pitch fork in a tub of fat-reduced sherry chutney, on top of a mound of butter farmed by orphans in Canada""...ok, not exactly but that's what it sounded like to me. It's actually hard not to laugh at how serious they take their ridiculous and unnecessary explanation. And I think that I did. And that made our guy a little upset. Just something not quite elegant about all these little details. 

And then you see ""Lobster Fritters"" on the menu and you come full circle with the classless mess that is Stripsteak, where my fondest hope was that the Cow would indeed disrobe at the end of the story.

The Lobster Fritters (I personally did NOT order them) were ok. Kind of tasted like from frozen, but better quality than Weight Watchers. They come with Creme Fraiche so if you're looking to die of heart disease before your 30 lbs of red meat, this is the appetizer to get.

Oysters were also just ok. Not fishy but just not great. And for 15-20 bucks, they should have been. Great, that is. They also only carry Kumamoto I believe, or some other mini Japanesey thing. Dude, Steakhouse - we need man Oysters here. Save these for your fake Sushi bar in the center of the hotel. (and they need it)

Steaks do NOT come with condiments, so for a 50-60 dollar steak, assume another 20-30 bucks in potatoes and/or veggies. I had the scalloped something or other which was all in all - gross.

The Steak (Rib) itself was good. Was it 60 dollars good? No. But one of the better things to eat at Mandalay and that's not saying much.

They also keep trying to push their stupid fake Kobe beef on you. Man - it's not KOBE. Kobe beef is made under stringent and incredible conditions in Japan and Americans won't let it in the country, as I hear. This is American FOBE. So don't get sucked in. The cow did not drink any beer before getting massaged, and tattooed like they do in Tokyo. 

The other thing we noticed is that its the busboys, both here and at China Grill, that do the place justice from a service perspective. Our busboy (busman really) - Victor, was awesome, fun, polite, respectful and free of that ever present Vegas-condescending, elitist attitude that is spread around the hotel, and inhaled by most staff members.

If you need to have Steak at Mandalay, go here if you don't want to walk for 4 minutes to Charlie Palmer at the adjoining 4 Seasons. Otherwise, walk on by",0I1dVZpjNfcTuhHNhCHUHw,6,5,3,FtGapEATx-_2r_vBVm3KlA

Since everyone in my group was getting steaks, I decided to mooch off of them and indulge my self in other pleasantries. So I got the West Coast Kushi oysters - similar to Kumamotos - my fav. I also got the bone marrow - nothing spectacular - a bit plain actually, just the marrow and some toast. I like it when marrow is spruced up a bit with capers and greens. So I wont be ordering this again from here. I also wanted to get the Fois Grois but the waiter suggested the Pate. It was good, but wish I had gone with my previous choice. The Pate - since i was eating it by myself - was a bit too heavy for only one to consume, especially when paired with the rich taste of the marrow - my bad overall, I should have considered it. 

My friend's Filet was AMAZING the most beautiful piece of meet you've ever seen. I will probably be getting that on ym next trip. My boyfriend's aged rib eye - rare - was succulent . My other friend got his rib eye med rare and it wa s bit too dry. We enjoyed a nice Syrah - $80, the lesser end of the list, but still lovely. 

The scalloped potatoes were awesome, as was the jalapeno cream corn. The Sides there are a MUST - get as many as your stomach can handle! AND you may not think you have room for desert but share the coconut passion fruit sorbet plate with your table - you'll be glad you did.

I never knew that people slammed martinis like teenagers on spring break but apparently they do.  Seems like it would be much more efficient to just buy a handle of Skol.  But I digress.

I started out with a Rockin' Rye, which is a pre mixed house concoction of rye, rum, ""aromatics & herbs"" served with one giant ice cube.  It's kind of fun that they have it up lit in a glass decanter on the bar.  It's a pretty good cocktail.

They were very tasty, with just enough alcohol that we returned for the happy hour the next 3 nights in a row to get more!

Once at our table, we received an order of the Duck Fat Fries, compliments of the chef. The fries were as great as you can imagine. Deep fried in duck fat, in 3 different styles, with 3 different sauces. I was trying not to eat too many because I didn't want to fill up and not eat my meal, but I could barely bring myself to stop eating them.

My girlfriend and I each got the 10oz Kobe Beef Filet Mignon. The waiter informed us that the beef is poached in clarified butter, then finished on a mesquite wood-burning grill. It was literally the best steak I have ever eaten. 

There is a great selection of appetizers and sides to choose from, very difficult to decide. We ended up going with the Truffle Mac and Cheese, the Roasted Artichokes with Goat Cheese, and the Chipotle Scalloped potatoes with Queso Fresco.

Overall, it was a very good meal for the price.  9/10.  I would definitely go back again.

Food
I had the pre-fixe meal for $65.  Helpful Hint: I had to ask for the pre-fixe menu.  They do not just give it to you.  Also, they said that the rib eye on the pre-fixe menu is the same size as the regular order.
Before the regular appetizers and entrées, they brought out 3 cups of French fries, each cooked differently (including one in duck fat) and each with a different dipping sauce (ketchup, aioli, and truffle oil).  I thought the fries cooked in the duck fat with the truffle oil sauce were great (10/10).  You just can't go wrong with truffles.
I had the crab cake as an appetizer.  It was a lump crab cake, which is my favorite, as it had chunks of crab instead of shredded pieces.  It was very good (9/10).   It reminded me of Legal Sea Foods on the east coast.
I had the rib eye was my main dish and they did slightly overcook it.  It was supposed to be med-rare, but it came out closer to medium.  The meat was tender and had a dry rub on it.  It was a very good steak (similar to Ruth's Chris, Capital Grill), but not in the upper echelon (Maestros, SW Steakhouse, Del Friscos). 8/10.
I had the root beer float with 2 chocolate cookies for desert.  The cookies were soft and warm and tasted good.  The root beer float had 2 small scoops of vanilla ice cream, but it also had a scoop of a frozen root beer.  It was a nice way to finish off a meal, but it was nothing spectacular. 6/10

Service
The waitress was full of energy and was friendly.  She checked up on us throughout the meal and made sure we were doing ok.  I would love to have her again.  10/10

Ambiance
I could call the restaurant modern and trendy, not old and stuffy.  It has glass partitions between booths so it has an open air concept.  They have different furniture in different areas so it looks like they tried to create ""sections"" without having walls.  You can see the meat handing and aging in the center of the restaurant.  9/10.",NCTPW4Noprdun4vscyY3vw,0,0,5,gbNYh2niPg6vFa3ZVCyzJQ

I had reservations as part of a package that included tickets to ""The Lion King"". So I had a pre fix menu to choose from. The decor inside the restaurant was nice, and everyone was friendly when I arrived. 

The server was friendly, but a bit slow. I started my meal with the mushroom soup and also ordered the Lobster Fritters. The fritters where very tasty. That was by far my favorite pert of the meal. Then I tried the mushroom soup. Maybe my expectations where to high, but I just didn't enjoy it. It was too creamy and barely served warm. No everything could be a winner tho. 

For my entree I had the Skirt steak. Here is where they went from 4 stars to 2 stars. Normally I order my steak med-rare. My steak came out charred on top, and completely raw in the middle. I ate less then half of it, and had to give up the rest. I over herd my server talking to another table, saying that the steak is cooked under temperature, so I should have ordered it medium. Unfortunately, my server failed to mention this to me and got stuck with a tough, burnt tasting raw piece of meat. Not a winning entree. (It did taste great re hashed in my breakfast burrito the next morning however.)

 The orders came wrong and stayed wrong,  both orders, both times they came to the table.  The worst part is this is a steak house where none of the menu items are cheap.  The expectation is that the kitchen of an establishment like this should get it right the first time and would  be able to re-fire a steak correctly the second time; no such luck.  

Now to the management reply... it took forever to get the manager to the table and when she did arrive there was little to no remorse about the cooking errors, and I mean NOTHING. A lopsided apology at best.

I guess the restaurant feels that with such a transient clientele as a Las Vegas resort has they do not need to extend themselves to diners to make a bad experience right or the food right because most people don't return visit for approximately a year and most are too lazy to write reviews.  BTW, I am writing this in December and my experience was in June;  I got busy, but I didn't forget!

I went shamalamadingdong over the duck fat fries and truffled mac and cheese, but how can our steaks that we made at home the following night shine over the Stripsteak steaks?!  Huh?  Allow me to illustrate....

1.  Trio of Duck Fat Fries - These were mutha beepin' good!  Loved the bbq flavor fries.  Loved the garlic flavor fries, and most of all, I mutho beepin' loved the truffle fries.  These blows Envy Steakhouse's out of the water (not that ENVY had a chance with their truffle fries anyway).  Let me just call these my Crack Fries.
2.  Sashimi (albacore, bigeye, blue fin toro) - The worst decision ever.  We were greedy and thought that ""Hey, we're at an expensive restaurant.  It has to be good right?""  Boy, were we wrong!  The albacore was icy?  WTF?  The tuna was fishy.  AND.  AND!  The toro was so fibrousy.
2.  Bibb Wedge (Salad) - Standard blue cheese, iceberg and bacon.  Yum.
3.  American Kobe Ribeye - Good but not juicy.  (Del Frisco's and N9NE still win)
4.  Slow Poached Prime Rib - Not juicy, not super tender.  *tear
5.  Truffled Macaroni and Cheese!  - Another mutha beepin' good one.  Trufffleeee.... *pump fist.

Conclusion:  I beepin' loved the fries and mac n cheese.  I will dream of them.  However, the steaks, I will not have, again.  I say save yourself the disappointment, don't go to stripsteak and make it yourself.

1667434,2012-10-09,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Wanting to surprise my fiancé with a trip to Vegas, I planned everything in advance including dinner reservations. We ended up dining at STRIPSTEAK and Bouchon for our main dinners, and STRIPSTEAK took a notable second place for me out of those two experiences. The food is delicious and the service is great -- there's not a question there. I had the tuna and it was cooked to perfection. My fiancé had the bone-in ribeye and seemed to be in heaven. We split the bleu cheese scalloped potatoes as a side and started with the hamachi poppers, both of which were exceptional. Aside from that, we each had a couple of cocktails and noshed on their complimentary trio of fries (the truffle fries and aioli -- nom!). Still, we somehow managed to tally up quite the bill, which is where my uncertainty lies. Around $230 for the two of us. Again, no wine. Just a couple of cocktails each (sub-$15). We did have a restaurant.com gift certificate which helped, but we were still both a little surprised by the cost of the meal. It was good, but not so memorable where it was worth that investment (at least not in my book). 

The ambiance wasn't totally what I expected either. I was expecting something a bit more Bouchon-esque (a little more closed off, dark wood, etc.), but instead the space was pretty modern and open. It's a place that you could go on a date just as easily as you could make it a guys night out. Not overly intimate in its surroundings, though still very nice.

All in all, I thought it was a very good meal. Not exceptional, and -- for me -- not worth the cost when there are so many other exceptional restaurants offering something bit more unique and equally delicious for the same price point. Still, I'm happy that I've checked a Michael Mina restaurant off the list. I just think I'd have been happier giving that money to Bobby Flay at Mesa Grill. :)",zqttuCEWI4-l4ZBCbfGk6A,4,2,4,YsqoKJJRQB6sUTVzOw43VQ

1677444,2015-06-01,15,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"***StripSteak is a typical Michael Mina restaurant that provides safe and consistently good cuisine, which is a plus in Las Vegas given the mediocre and overpriced food that you will often find here (even at acclaimed restaurants)***

There is definitely a comforting consistency with Michael Mina restaurants regardless of the location. You are likely to have at least a satisfying dinner at a Michael Mina restaurant because his cuisine focuses on quality ingredients and tried and true flavor combinations. Michael Mina restaurants though do not veer much from his style so I am rarely surprised by his food. 

Michael Mina in San Francisco is his best restaurant; that restaurant definitely has a few real high points though its food would not compete with San Francisco's best high-end cuisine. I remember finding Michael Mina in Las Vegas being good but nothing memorable. Their menu has changed quite a bit over the years and seasonality seems to be playing a larger role so maybe I need to give them another shot. 

StripSteak in Mandalay Bay is a Michael Mina steakhouse. It has all the trademarks of a Michael Mina restaurant with Asian influences throughout the menu and a variety of high quality beef available to order. Like Michael Mina's Arcadia in San Jose, StripSteak starts you off with a complimentary trio of fries and sauces. Fries with different seasonings like truffle oil as well as different sauces like curry ketchup and mustard aioli. The fries were hot, crispy and definitely addictive. 

I tried two of their beef cuts. The best was the Wagyu rib cap. This beef was very rich, juicy and tender. It did not match the best rib cap I've had, which was at Splendido in Toronto. That Canadian restaurant not only delivered an exceptionally rich and juicy meat but also an incredible bark that was crispy and smoky. Still, this was the kind of beef course many would love because it was as flavorful as it was juicy and tender. 

The other steak was disappointing. It was a Prime bone-in ribeye. The steak was too thin so there was not that great contrast between a nice sear and a thick and juicy center. While it was by no means a bad steak, it would definitely not be in the same category of excellent thick ribeyes you can get at a high-end steakhouse like Mastro's. The steak was garnished with complimentary bone marrow. I also added grilled foie gras, which was fine but too pricey.

For sides, I had the pork belly fried rice that was mixed with carrots and peas. The fried rice was quite spicy, which definitely differentiated it from a lot of fried rice dishes I've had. I enjoyed the heat though I am not sure if this is the best pairing for simply prepared and seasoned steaks. I also tried the asparagus with yuzu butter. The asparagus was thin and tender and not too bitter. The butter sauce was not too heavy and provided a good citrus element to the asparagus. 

For dessert, I had the beignets with three sauces. The beignets were fairly good. They were light and pillowy though not as airy as the best beignets I've had at restaurants like Village Pub and Spruce in the Bay Area as well as what I used to enjoy at the now closed Hatfield's in Los Angeles. 

The sauces were not sauces as much as they were mini desserts. There was a very good creme brûlée with rich and thick vanilla custard and a crispy caramelized sugar top. There was also a salted caramel pot de creme that was sweet and salty as well as very thick. The last sauce was a butterscotch pudding. The pudding was creamy and the bitter burn was definitely noticeable. 

Service was good--friendly and polite. It is a loud and frenetic restaurant so it is no surprise that the service might have been a little less attentive and personable as some other high-end restaurants I've tried. 

Prices are high, but it is Las Vegas. I think StripSteak is within the same price range as other high-end and celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas. 

As mentioned, StripSteak is a loud restaurant. It is dark, contemporary and definitely energetic. I did like how while the restaurant was very close to the casino, a lot of the seating was very deep into the restaurant so guests are not bothered by the cigarette smoke that engulfs a lot of Las Vegas. I did find the chairs, which had low backs, to be slightly too uncomfortable for a long dinner. 

StripSteak is a perfectly fine Las Vegas steakhouse. I think StripSteak really separates itself from other steakhouses I've been to across the country with its sides. The sides here are more interesting and taste fresher than typical steakhouse fare.  The rib cap was very good while the ribeye was disappointing. If you are a big steak fan, I would recommend Carnevino, which delivers thicker and more memorable beef, but StripSteak seems to offer excellent choices from starter to entree to dessert, which is a rarity in Las Vegas.

I've heard rave reviews of Michael Mina so frankly I am shocked at the blatant ineptness of this kitchen. It was embarrassing to be shelling out so much money for how consistently shitty each entree was. When we walked in, the hostess hesitated to put our names on the waiting list and recommended we go to Fleur instead. She said it is superb. We should've paid attention to her subtle warning. 

So they give you complimentary fries as an appetizer. They were cold. How do you mess up french fries?! We started with a ceasar salad. It was bland and the anchovies had zero flavor. They tasted like they'd been thawed or soaked in water. They were certainly not fresh. Anchovies are supposed to be salty. The saltiness is essential to create the best flavor in the salad. At times I felt like running back into the kitchen and helping these chumps. I ordered the $40.00 salmon...I call it ""the $40.00 salmon"" because the only thing that stood out about it was it's price. I had to send it back. It was chalk dry and overcooked. It was disgusting. My boyfriend said I make way better salmon at home. We went to Norm's the following day, even Norm's makes better salmon. Like way better. Then they made me a new one and it was rare. I knew they simply don't know how to cook, no matter how many times I send it back, it's still going to suck and I like sashimi so I ate it. 

My boyfriend's steak was, ""alright,"" (his words, verbatim). Our bill came out to $153.00.  We left the waitress, who spent most of the night gossiping with the other waitresses, 15%. Save your money. This restaurant blows.",P7tk0TvdBtnZUlTtv8uzzA,1,1,1,AhJAW4ErIQ_C0XH6rmMO_g

-Trio of Duck fat fries:  OMG, all three were amazing.

-Bibb Salad w/ avocado, bacon, Oregon smokey blue cheese:  Their take on the standard steakhouse lettuce wedge.  The bibb felt a little limp and not as sweet, would have preferred the iceberg lettuce wedge.
-dry-aged bone-in ribeye:  i ordered medium rare, it was overcooked.  They very graciously brought out a replacement (albeit a bit on the rare side), very quickly.  I enjoyed it.   The portions are ginormous, even for the prix fixe menu.
-Select seasonal side dishes:  tiny ""tastes"" of house specialty sides, including the truffle mac 'n cheese.  yum!
-Michael's root beer float:  i hate root beer...my bf enjoyed it.

REGULAR MENU:
-10 oz filet mignon ($54):  perfectly cooked, tender
-Potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream and onion, horseradish):  loved the sour cream & onion and lobster!

Atmosphere was great and the service was great too, but it's the food what counts.  I went with my family and we ordered a bunch of things.  They provided us with the trio of duck fat fries, which was the best part of the dinner. There was an aioli sauce that was fantastic.  The fries were not greasy, but so aromatic and melted in your mouth.  We ordered several appetizers.  The lobster mini grill cheese with a side of tomato soup was the best tomato soup.  It was light and slightly sweet.  The sandwich was really greasy and buttery and I couldn't taste a hint of lobster for the life of me.  The foie gras came in a form of two small burgers, which were adorable but I didn't touch it. We had another appetizer that had something to do with crab, but can't remember it much.  Then came our steaks and sides.  Everything was REALLY salty.  It wasn't just me and my palate, everyone mentioned it even before I did.  The bacon creamed spinach was the worst, I think the bacon didn't help the saltiness of it.  I couldn't eat it after one bite.  Which was really disappointing because I always look for creamed spinach as good as Lawrys.  The mac and cheese was also salty.  Since it was truffled mac and cheese, I expected it to melt in my mouth but of course it was salty!  also they used cavatappi pasta, which is hallowed corkscrew pasta that they cut short...not the best for mac and cheese.  Scalloped Potatoes was nothing special and the mushrooms with onions were also really salty.  Thought I would get a nice piece of steak, since it is a steak house but, it was really salty as well.   It was nicely cooked, and perfectly charred and would have been perfect if someone had not dumped a bottle of salt all over my food.  I was just bewildered and thought it must be a mistake or an abberation, but, I don't know, not coming back here again.

The restaurant is wonderfully decorated, with the wood boards clasped along the side walls, the sleek lighting, and lounge-styled booths and tables.  Walk around to view the kitchen as well.  The space is expansive, and not overly cluttered by many tables.

Three different types of fries, along with three different sauces started the evening.  Wonderful.  Their beet salad with burrata cheese was phenomenal, what a great combination of texture and taste.  The turkey dinner, complete with stuffing, was near perfection.  Dessert was grapefruit panna cotta, coconut ice cream, passionfruit, and lemongrass.  I was amazed by how wonderful this combination tasted.

They have a great selection of specialty cocktails and a fairly good wine list to go along with a great menu.

The best Mac n Cheese that I've had anywhere. Came here for a Business School dinner. I recommend making a reservation as this seems to be a very popular spot for dinner.

Being the only vegetarian in the group, things weren't looking up for me. Even their fries are made with duck fat. Oh well, I resigned myself to ordering the beet salad with burrata cheese and a few sides. So a few sides turned into 3 eventually. Namely, the Truffle Mac n Cheese, Roasted Morels, and Potato Cakes. 4 if you count the Potato Focaccia that they bring out with your meal.

The Beet salad was pretty good, but as I mentioned earlier, just order their Mac n Cheese. It's that good. The potato cakes and Roasted Morels were nothing special. Also, they dry age their steaks, if that counts for anything.

Sides are family style, and I recommend the goat cheese scallop potatoes. They were incredible.  I also really enjoyed the complimentary french fries with dipping sauces, and baked bread before the meal. 

The decor is stunning, and the restaurant is ideal for a group setting.  

If I was rating this review on just the above, then I would generously give Strip Steak 5 stars, however, my 3 star review is based on service.  This is what we experienced while dining:

1) My friend's steak was cold in the middle. Not sure how long our meal was sitting out, but this should never happen at an upscale steakhouse. 

2) My other friend's halibut was not cooked throughout, hence leaving a very salty, bitter taste. 

3) The service was slow. We sat down for an 8 pm reservation and did not get out of there until after 11 pm.  

4) I ordered Bearnaise sauce with my meal and it did not come out with my steak. I had to wait until the server took another trip to the kitchen to finally bring it out. 

These inconveniences should never happen at a restaurant where our final bill comes to $900 for 7 people.  I won't be coming back here.

I mean they give you French fries instead of bread- what's not to like? That being said I would say my experience at the Vegas restaurant was slightly worse than in DC or SF but I am a Niles Crane-esque nitpicker so don't let that deter you. Also, Stripsteak is in the Mandalay Bay which makes it a bit easier to get a table/reservation on the weekends as its not nearly as popular a hotel as it once was (something that also lends to the Border Grill brunch). There are like 3 negative reviews where the people say "" I can make food better than this""- I'm not sure if they all climbed out of the same clown car together but if they can actually make better food they are in the wrong industry. 


The Steak

I always get a bone in ribeye when I first go to a steak place as a basis of comparison with other restaurants. The ribeye here is a bit smaller than usual (18 oz vs usual 22 or more) and I actually think the meat was a little tastier. The steak had been trimmed a little more than I would like (fat= flavor) but it didn't seem to have negatively affected the steak. The curst was nice and salty- good. Medium rare was a deep red-good. The price (59$) is pretty average for Vegas steak joints on the strip. My dining companion got the Waygu  vs Waygu entree and that was fantastic- probably what I will get the next time I go (although bacon rapped veal is pretty enticing as well) 

The Sides

Some people, after eating 2 lbs of French fries, might think ""You know what; I probably don't need another potato side"". We call those people losers. The reason these underhumans won't be dining with me is because Stripsteak has a little something called the Potato Puree Trio- much like the fires it delivers 3 different kinds of potato including one that is pureed with lobster. Perhaps I am a philistine but the lobster potatoes were actually freaking awesome. I know it probably shouldn't be done, I know it's probably not the choicest lobster bits but jesus... it is good. 

The mac and cheese- I also always get this when available my first time at a steak place and this one did not disappoint. It was quite ""crusty"" with lots of bits on top which I like. The mac itself was perhaps a little dry but I would rather that than have it swimming. 

Broccolini- had a very nice amount of garlic flavor which made this usually inedible weed actually taste pretty good.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,7,7,5,zy6mwccAJcSrZXNnMfZRmw

I Showed the waiter how raw it was so they took it back and finished cooking it while everyone else ate. Still charged full price.

1942590,2009-07-15,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I was underwhelmed with this place. I ordered the prime rib from the prix fix menu, and it was okay, probably a solid B. It came with some sides--a small thing of creamy spinach, okay. A small thing of mac'n cheese, tasted pretty nasty. A small dish of steamed vegetables, mostly peas, probably from a can. 

The potato bread was greasy as heck. Duck fat fries, also very greasy--nothing special, don't listen to the other guys. In'n out has way better fries. Someone should tell the people cooking back there, more grease does not equal better tasting food. The dessert was really good, however (kudos to the dessert chef). That, and the hostess (kudos to the hiring staff) were about the only redeeming qualities.  

I used a $50 restaurant.com coupon and still it seemed way expensive. This is more of an overpriced tourist joint for people who are staying in the hotel and don't have cars. If you are stuck in Mandalay Bay, I would suggest Aureole or Lupo, both had better food.

Well my buddy and I decided to try Stripsteak since we didn't have the requisite number of peeps to eat the tasting menu at Craftsteak. Also it was good to try a different steak place in LV.

Well it's a very happenin' place. Crowded with lovely looking hostesses in short black dresses. Always a plus in my book :D Plus they had complimentary duck fat fries tonight with the trio of dipping sauces. Excellent start so far. The crab cake and romaine heart appetizers were ordered. Crab cake was decent. Nothing spectacular. The romaine heart was a bit too salty because of the overwhelming anchovies and cheese on it. Could have passed on that. As far as what we ate, my buddy had the special which was a 12oz American Kobe New York Steak while I had the 8oz American Kobe Ribeye Cap. The Ribeye Cap had more marbling that the New York Steak so there was definitely a more buttery feel when you chewed it while the New York Steak was meatier and lacked some of the fat. Both were exceptionally seasoned and grilled. Just remember to request light on the salt just in case it becomes oversalted. Dessert was the mini doughnuts which were crispy on the outside and slightly cakey on the inside. Dusted with powdered sugar, you had chocolate and caramel sauces to dip and a large scoop of caramel ice cream as an accompaniment. 

The server was great and was always there to make sure everything was fine. The secondary server was quick to set up and remove our plates once we were done. Once again, water was promptly filled which is a plus. Also, the server confirmed what I heard about them slowly butter poaching their steaks until it gets to room temp and then placing it on the grill to cook further. Gotta love the butter.",V0Kg9fkgfoCNvYpNJcv0Ng,0,0,4,Piy8DXcSlwPp_pDTk18jnw
1958775,2012-01-07,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I had a very good meal here, but nothing blew me away. Given the reputation of the chef and the price paid, that is disappointing. My friend and I were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time. Dana White and a group of UFC fighters were dining in the restaurant as well during the time of our visit. In fact I came pretty close to smacking the guy in the crotch when he walked by our table and I was in mid stretch. So yeah, as other have mentioned, the tables are packed pretty close together here. In addition to nearly smacking a guy in the crotch, the closeness of the tables also meant hearing a lot of other people's conversations. The nice older woman next to us started to tell some of the most expletive filled stories after a few glasses of wine. I did like that it was a relaxed atmosphere for fine dining. My wrinkle free shirts hadn't stayed as wrinkle free as I would have liked in my luggage and being sort on time I put on a black t-shirt and tried for the Steve Jobs look. I thought I'd look out of place, but lots of people were dressed casually. 

Our server was in a bit of a rush at first. All of his tables were sat at the same time including ours, but later in the night, as things calmed down, he came over and chatted with us for a bit. The guy was right on with all his suggestions. The service was good overall. 

For appetizers we had the lobster fritters and east coast oysters. The fritters were lobster wrapped in bacon, fried and served with butter lettuce and creme fraiche. You know anything made with that combination of ingredients is going to be good and it was, but it was just good. I'm not usually one to talk about the concept of a dish, but when I'm in a place like Stripsteak I am hoping for something unique. This dish didn't strike me as being anything that unique as much as it was a bunch of delicious stuff that got fried. We also received our complimentary fries and while they were all good, the one that really stood out was the truffled one.

My friend and I both had the bone-in ribeye as our entree. Hate to say it, but it was slightly overcooked. I kept cutting into it hoping it was just the char from the wood burning grill that made it seem less pink than a medium rare should have been, but my steak was mostly medium until I got very close to the bone. This was a shame since it was a very good cut of meat. My friend had his with foie gras and it was a great combination. He also had the chipotle scalloped potatoes recommended by our server and they were excellent. I went old school and got a baked potato. The overcooked steak was probably the biggest disappointment of the night.

We were both stuffed, but after such a heavy meal I wanted something sweet to end the night. We both went with the beignets. I had the one with chocolate, pudding, and Macallan 18. I'll eat anything with Macallan 18 in it. It was a decent beignet. A little bit denser than I would have liked, but probably done so because it was intended to be dipped into the pudding. Again, a good dessert, but nothing amazing. The best part was probably the Macallan. My friend had the same thing but with creme brulee instead of pudding.

So yeah, that was pretty much the story of the night. Good food and good service, but nothing we had really wowed me. My friend raves about his steak with foie gras, but it was his first time having foie gras so I guess we all remember our first time ;) I think the only item that was really memorable to me was the truffled fries.",DgrkaxfNoMP1nGGrDcpkOw,0,0,4,YgxCuEl2SmhHZJkgejUuUA

Stripsteak is located in the restaurant wing/section of Mandalay Bay, and offers happy hour daily from 400-600pm.  Seating is first come first serve at the bar and lounge area in the front section of the restaurant.  Although the food offerings/specials for happy hour are few in number, all doubts will be cast away as soon as you get a whiff and taste of the food.

The bar and lounge food menu consists of a mere 5 items, and my friend and I decided on 3:

1)  Prime Rib Sliders, $10; au jus with brioche bun
2)  Meatballs, $8; with heirloom tomato sauce and aged jack cheese
3)  Duck Spring Roll, $9; hot and sour cherry sauce

We ordered 1 item that was not listed on the menu, and that was the the trio of duck fat fries with herb, truffle, and bbq dipping sauces..

As far as drinks, select beers are $3, well drinks $6, and an assortment of ""featured cocktails"" are $6 as well.

Aside from the duck fat fries, our other favorite dish of the evening were the meatballs, as we thought the combination of the sauce and aged jack cheese certainly made a flavorful combination.  The prime rib sliders can be slightly on the messy side so make sure to have ample napkins available.  The spring rolls were delicious, but not as wonderful as the duck fat fries.  Truth be told, my friend and I ordered and devoured 2 orders of duck fat fries that night.....that dish is a winner!

SERVICE:  Excellent and outstanding.  The 2 female servers were very polite, patient, and always checked on us in a timely manner.

Stripsteak is located in Mandalay Bay, where all the restaurants are, before the Mandalay Bay conference rooms and ballrooms. 

When you walk up (hopefully with reservations as this place gets BUSY!) there is a full bar with a seating area. Luckily, we were able to get a table without reservations at 7:00pm on a Monday night. They sat us at a nice table, right in the middle of the action. It's a tad loud in there so bring your listening skills. 

After you are seated and given the menu, they bring out three little containers with french fries and dipping sauces. Now these are not your McDonald's fries. These are the most amazing fries you will ever have. 

The first one had french fries with old bay seasoning and a mustard herb dipping sauce. 

The second one had french fries with oregano and ketchup. 

The third one was knock-your-socks off amazing. French fries in duck fat with truffle dipping sauce. Are you fucking kidding me?!?! The minute we all tried these we all looked at each other and said ""these are goddamn delicious!"" 

All three had fantastic flavor with good crisp on the outside. 

But yea- duck fat + french fries + truffle = smiling faces. 

Our table ordered: 
Starters- 
Oysters (in a half shell)- east coast style. They ask you if you want them east coast or west coast style. The difference? east coast are ""larger and briny-er"", west coast are ""smaller and sweeter"" according to our server. 
The oysters were delicious! They had came with cocktail sauce, lemon, and other toppings. The cocktail sauce had some nice horseradish in it for the perfect combination. 

Wedge Salad- bleu cheese, bacon & polenta croutons, red chili cucumbers. I was told that it was disappointing as the bleu cheese dressing didn't have any bleu cheese chucks and tasted ""like it came out of the store"" 

Main- 
18 oz. Dry-Aged Bone-In Rib Eye- heard it was delicious. They cook the steaks on this beautiful open flame wood burning grill. You can watch the chefs using the wheel up and down to get the steaks. Heard that the marble was good and had great char on the steak. Nothing fancy just cooked perfect (medium-rare plus) 

16 oz. Kansas City Strip- great char, great flavor, all round good steak. 

Diver Scallops- which is what I ordered. Four deliciously tender, cooked perfectly, great flavored scallops. Seared nicely. 

Sides- 
Creamed Spinach w/ bacon- I LOVE creamed spinach and this was up to par, but nothing crazy. The bacon doesn't really add anything to the dish. 

Roasted Maitake Mushrooms- great roasted mushrooms. Not much else to say. They are always a good side to seafood and steaks. 

We had a couple of glasses of wine (a cab-combination) that was REALLY GOOD and I would order all day long!

You will wait and wait, you will beg and ask the dishwasher to please dear God bring you your beer, but you will NOT leave disappointed in the food. 

My boyfriend and I went last night (Saturday evening) and the wait was non-existent. We were seated in a beautifully designed dining room at a large table. We waited and waited and waited on our first beer, but we were okay with that because we'd been at the bar drinking before dinner anyway. The waitress was polite enough and seemingly efficient, but then would wander away waiting on the tables around us while we fantasized about another drink. Eventually we got one more.  

I don't want to harp on the waitstaff, but when you present a beautiful place with an outstanding menu (and wow, the prices) then you expect to be waited on accordingly. No, not here. Anyway, onto the real star, the meal!

Ordered some East Coast oysters. The waiter said the oysters from the West Coast were smaller and we like our oysters to have something to bite into, so...Got the oysters and they were TINY. I don't want to know what the West Coast were like. Regardless, these were the best oysters I do believe I've ever had the pleasure of eating. There weren't enough, and in my estimation, with the way those tasted, never will be enough. I could have eaten them for days. As Rowan Jacobsen says 'at some level, it's not about taste or smell at all. Because an oyster, like a lover, first captures you by bewitching your mind.' These are those oysters. Get them.

We then ordered the 18 oz. dry aged bone-in rib eye. Wow, wow, wow. WOW. It came out cooked a little more rare than we asked (medium rare), and while usually that much red in meat makes me shy away, it was hardly relevant with this steak. It melted in my mouth. Every taste was better than the one before. I have never, ever eaten a steak that tasted this way. I was considering going full vegetarian, but after this steak there will never be a chance of that. I have eaten at Cut, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, BLT, and many, many more. None have ever come close to the steak I had at STRIPSTEAK. None. As a bonus, my BF ordered foie gras to go on top. Listen, if you asked me to trade sex for a year for all the foie gras I could eat from this restaurant, well, let's just say I'd miss my BF a lot. It was THE best thing that has ever touched my lips and I mean that with everything I have. If you don't get this you are missing out on the most divine dining experiences you could possibly have. I have to stop talking about it. Moving on...

I can't skip the sides we had with our fabulous meal. The potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish) was, as stated, a puree, and I tend to like my mashed potatoes with a little more body, but these were out of this world. The flavors were subtle and smooth, and really, now I'll never want to eat garlic mashed again. THANKS A LOT, STRIPSTEAK. We also had the truffled mac and cheese. Speechless. It was the most divine taste of truffles in any dish I've ever tried with them. The musky, earthy flavor was just enough. I ate the whole thing (sorry, honey). 

Okay, the letdown here was the dessert, but you really don't go for the dessert anyway, right? While I don't remember what they called it, we had miniature donuts with a couple of dipping sauces. While I've had this dessert elsewhere and loved it, here it fell flat and really shouldn't be on a menu as amazing as this. Avoid. 

My suggestion is, if you want to round out your experiences with great steak RUN, don't walk, here. This place sets the bar for it.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,1,1,5,ijzB9tP4CY43HUHf1x4qrg

All kidding aside,  I love this place. One of my favorite stops in Vegas. I've been twice so far, and I plan to go back. First off, this place is currently on restaurant.com, so you can get a pretty good deal. I've tried both the ribeye and the rib cap. The rib cap is supposed to be their best meat they have, and it is rich and flavorful. However, I guess I'm a traditionalist and love my ribeye. It's very good here. The sides are incredible. I've had the mac and cheese, the trio of pureed potatoes (good!), and the creamed spinach with bacon. Also, the foie gras was very tasty and a generous portion. I tried the bone marrow for the 1st time in my life, and I just think I'm not a big fan of it.  As you must already know by reading the many reviews, they bring a complimentary trio of fries that come with special sauces. Oh, the truffles fries and truffle sauce... amazing. For dessert, I've had the marscapone cheesecake and the donuts. Both were very good. And they even give you a dark chocolate covered popcorn goodie bag to take with you.

The drinks are good too, and the service is great. Both times I came alone, and I felt very special. They are very accommodating.

For cocktails I highly recommend the Cucumber Martini and the Moscow Mule. Both of those drinks were phenomenal. Their drink menu is an iPad with a really cool interface that allows you to easily browse all their drinks.

We were served complimentary fries upon our arrival, since there were five of us, they brought two servings of them. All the fries are cooked in duck fat and seasoned differently, I know for sure one was truffle, but I don't recall the others. The dipping sauces were great, one was truffle, one was mustard, and the other I don't remember, but everything was delish.

I split the lobster bisque with my stepmom, so they gave each of us a small bowl. My favorite lobster bisque was at Craftsteak, but they can move over, because my new favorite is at Stripsteak. Love, love, loved this bisque! 

I ordered the grilled diver scallops, which were delicious and reasonable. Four large scallops for under $40 is a pretty good deal, especially in Vegas. They are mesquite grilled and they were wonderful. 

I sampled everybody else's food, all of it was amazing!

Halibut - Also mesquite grilled, light touch of lemon. Perfect.
King Crab Legs - Served with drawn butter and lemon, and they removed the shells for my sister in law, very nice of them!
Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye - Only one person ordered steak at the steakhouse, lol, but it was one of the best ribeye's I have ever tasted. I would get that if I come again.
American Wagyu Burger - Awesome burger with a really good mustard flavor to it.

For sides we shared the Truffled Mac & Cheese with Peas, Potato Gratin with Gouda Sauce, and the Creamed Corn with Jalapeno. All amazing. The portions appeared to be pretty small, but they were actually perfect considering all the other food we had, we ended up leaving some of the sides behind.

For dessert with ordered the Beignets with the trio of sauces. We were given six light, airy, hot beignets with a very scotchy butterscotch sauce, a creme brulee sauce, and a chocolate pudding sauce. Mmmmm, I would come back to this restaurant just to get dessert again!

Food: Duck breast w/ foie gras and beat salad. I've been waiting a long time to have foie gras. I know know why it's so revered by ""foodies"". It is creamy, savory, slightly sweet, with a touch of gamey. Superb. The duck was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The beat salad was slightly unbalanced with the bitterness of the greens they used; more beats or goat cheese (which are part of the dish) would perfect this salad.

Alcohol: It's Vegas, so the industry standard is that you have everything. This place is no different. Prices aren't cheap, though. You pay about $11 for a pint.

Ambiance: Great, modern look. Music volume is perfect for conversation; the selection is what you'd expect for Vegas, poppy with a touch of clubby. 

Service: The wait staff is very welcoming and professional. This is greatly complimented by their managerial staff, who I'm sure sets and enforces these standards.

I just felt we were not given the attention that you normally get at a high-end restaurant. The food was not something out of this world that we would've expected from such a highly reviewed restaurant. My wife ordered filet mignon that was rare as opposed to medium. Mine was overcooked. Even as we requested drinks that took forever to come out if they remembered. Dessert choices were not that great. Had dessert somewhere else.

2058503,2013-01-22,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Strip steak is probably the most unique of the steak houses in Vegas. The focus is on the meat itself with very little outside influences. What that means is that the steak speaks for itself.

The ambiance is quite nice but since the bar is pretty big and at the entrance, the place is pretty loud too. The staff was very good in that they checked up on me often even when I didn't even order anything yet. They are the only ones that offered me a Prix Fix menu.

The first thing that comes out is probably one of the most addicting fries you will ever put in your mouth, their Duck Fat Fries. I know it doesn't sound as good but the crunch and flavor will change your mind. Knowing that is complimentary makes it harder to resist. It comes with 3 flavors: Original, Herb fries, and Old Bay fries (the latter being the saltiest and least favorite of the bunch for me). There are 3 dipping sauces, Truffle Aioli, Ketchup, and Mustard Remoulade (not sure how to spell that).

The appetizer was a single crab cake (normally $18). Although it seemed fresh and tasted very good, it was not worth the price in my opinion. Thank god for the Prix Fix menu. The one thing I will say is that as soon as it comes out, the fresh crab aroma does hit you pretty hard, which is good for seafood lovers.

The truffle Mac N' Cheese was very good. Not too cheesy, not too salty. The flavor is smokey so I wonder if they used some sort of smoked cheese like Smoked Gouda. Cream is smooth and not overpowering.

The Brussel Sprouts were undecipherable. It was a mish-mash of a whole bunch of stuff I could not discern. It reminded me of that Cafeteria mystery meat where you are unsure what is in it. Probably my least favorite side of all the steak houses I've been too so far.

The STEAK: The steak is first poached at 118-119 degrees in butter for 20-30 minutes, depending on size of cut. It is them placed on a grill raised by a giant wheel (as seen in pictures) over mesquite wood and charcoal. The seafood side of the grill has an additional wood (Olive Wood). Surprisingly, there is no char or crunch on the steak but because the steak was poached, the cooking is uniform throughout the steak. This is where Strip Steak focuses on the Steak. No other sauces are added.

The root beer float dessert brought back childhood memories. Nothing spectacular but great nostalgia.",SO5vCEZYPUgEDcdwFcnaPA,0,0,4,57_cozBbZkl6elHUrJf-Jg

This was probably my 5th time at Strip Steak & while it's been a few years since I've been, I was delighted that some of my favorite staples were still on the menu & the experience was as good as ever. We had a party of 5 & took our foodie friends. There may have been tears of joy shed & it was THE PERFECT last meal of our trip.

For apps, we did crispy duck rolls, pork belly (instant bacon on the menu) & crab legs. The duck was great, but the latter two were so phenomenal it made a great app underwhelming. As always, the complimentary duck fat fries were a big hit.

Three of us had scallops for our entrees; they were perfection. One had the flat iron steak; again, perfect w/no complaints. But the absolute stars of the culinary show were the rib cap & the bone marrow side. Oh. My. God. Rich, delicious, heaven! 

Other sides we ordered were pork belly fried rice, brussels sprouts & gratin potatoes. All had subtle, perfectly harmonized flavors. Perhaps one thing I personally did not care for was the preparation on the brussel spouts; they were rather soft (but GREAT flavor) & I prefer mine roasted & a little charred & crispy. 

We shared beignets for dessert (7 pieces w/creme brûlée, chocolate & well-aged-scotch butterscotch sauces) they were perfect as we were all stuffed but couldn't pass up a sweet bite ending. We also had after dinner drinks & the big hit was one made w/vodka, kalhúa & frosted flake (yes, the cereal) soaked milk. It was GRRRREAT!

Most notably was how, like BLT, StripSteak provides an amuse bouche and bread serving complimentary.  I give the edge to StripSteak on the amuse bouche duck fat fries.  They were so good that we were salivating over the un-touched portion that the table next to us didn't finish.  And, although the bread was good, there something more unique about the popovers at BLT.

As for entrees, three of us chose the ribeye ($51 each), which had a good flavor due to the fat content, but made me rethink choosing it over the filet ($54), luckily I got a nice sample of the filet since it's owner couldn't finish it.  Edge to BLT.

Sides.  Edge to StripSteak.  We ordered three to share among the four of use.  Mac N Cheese ($12), Cream Corn ($13), and the Spinach Souffle ($12).  While we felt each was good, the Cream Corn was our least favorite with the Spinach Souffle being my most favorite.  And, we probably could have been fine with two sides since the portion of the sides were much larger in comparison to BLT. 

Three of us had drinks.  The service was attentive.  And, like BLT, since we declined dessert, we were provided with a complimentary treat, which was two small bags of chocolate caramel corn, which was good, but not was good as the pecan treats BLT has.  

I know it's not necessarily fair to compare StripSteak with BLT, but  again I thought about the comparison during dinner.  

I think StripSteak could have done a better job of designing the interior to give you the feel that you weren't inside a Casino, but rather a Michael Mina level restaurant.

Our waiter explained the different cuts of meat to us and even brought out the raw rib-eyes before cooking to show us the difference between American and Japanese Kobe. I guess if you're paying hundreds of dollars for meat, they're going to make sure you know what you're buying.

- The service was exceptional. They were friendly, timely and got everything right.
- the Pear Martini. What made this a memorable drink for me was the lychee puree, which seemed to elevate the pear flavor in a way.
-Manhattan Lobster chowder- huge hunks of lobster.
-Roasted Marrow Bones- extremely buttery. It needed toast points to spread it and current marmalade to offset the fatty flavor.
-Truffled Mac & Cheese- this was my husband and daughter's favorite. It was good, but I wasn't feeling the big chunks of broccoli in it.
-Masami Farms American Kobe ""Eye"" of rib eye and fillet Mignon- were tender and cooked to perfection. steaks were garnished with a large roasted and steamed orange peppers added a sweet and slightly crunchiness to the steaks when eaten together.
- Spiced Carrot Cake- don't expect a neatly sliced triangle or square cake topped with cream cheese. This dessert is very ""new age-ie"" where the cream cheese is smeared on the dish, the cake is crumbled like a decimated city and it's dolloped with a scoop of carrot sorbet and vanilla ice cream.

- Dunkin Mini Donuts with jasmine chocolate and salty caramel sauce. I loved the salty caramel sauce the best. the jasmine chocolate was very subtle.

Our Sommelier was 'sort of' helpful. My table was happy with my choice, but I think had he been a bit more descriptive or able to communicate with me, the wine would have been exceedingly more impressive and we might have spent a bit more on the bottle in the end.

For sides, the Scalloped Potatoes were the most memorable and delicious of the four we chose. (mac and cheese, asparagus, ?)

Dessert was a real treat. There was some kind of pecan maple carmel something or other dish with Beignets that was incredible.

The bill came out to $180. I used my coupon for $50 and this took off $50 but they added $30 for gratuity. On the original receipt, there was no gratuity added. It was just 2 of us. I didn't bother about this anymore since paying and using this coupon with the rep (manager I assume,) took about 15 minutes of our time. I would probably come back here for lunch if I had coupon.

My hubby was hankering to take me here for a while and we finally got a chance to try the menu at Stripsteak.

After passing by multiple restaurants with hostesses soliciting our business, we were taken aback by the inefficient hostess. By our seating time, there was least 3-4  group of guests gathered around the hostess desk. She basically ignored the diners and the wait staff  who lined to find out how to seat us. 

She also didn't tell us about ongoing promotions at the restaurant: ie, the 3-course prix fixe menu for $55, or that they are currently having a half-priced happy hour lounge menu from 4-7pm. Plus, they don't offer  you their prix fixe menu unless you specifically ask for it... even when you're seated at the table. For this reason, despite the stellar service at our table, the service gets 3 stars.

Michael Mina is known for preparing a dish in three different ways. So obviously our amuse bouche consisted of Bay-seasoned, garlic herb, truffled duck fat fries served with accompanying truffle aioli, ketchup and mustard/bay-seasoned sauce. The fries had a lovely crispness that retained its texture even when it cooled off. The sauces were lovely especially the truffle aioli. I considered drinking the remaining dregs of it on the bottom but decided I still needed to save my appetite for food we'd ordered. 

The soups were solid but nothing special. The vidalia onion soup accentuated the sweetness of onion but the croutons really lack that nice crunch. The seafood chowder was  good - the broth was a little on the milder side which allowed for the diner to get the full flavour of the crab when eaten.

The foie gras sliders had the right flavour however the bun was definitely overly large considering the serving of foie on the inside. The plating would have been infinitely improved with having the bun on the side.

By far the standout was our bone-in rib-eye. It's rare to see me shovel down an entire steak the size of a catcher's mitt all on my own but there was not a scrap of meat left on that plate. Yes, it is that good. The carmelized crust on the meat was so wonderful, the inside so tender and well-seasoned ... it's hard to find steak that well-prepared. 

It was lovely that they provided a small tasting of three sides along with the rib-eye. The peas were okay - a little on the mealier side of things. The truffled mac 'n cheese is always great - perfect consistency, texture and flavour. Unfortunately, the creamed spinach had a rather bitter unpleasant undertone.

The hubby's grilled chicken (they don't fry a serving of chicken unless two people order) was a very large portion. Half a grilled chicken - a lovely crispy skin, tender and moist on the inside - on top of their wonderful mac 'n cheese. Who wouldn't like this?

We topped off our very filling meal with a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies. We loved the fact that the ice cream was so cold, it turned our creamy root beer into a nice slush. The chocolate chip cookies were a delight - not too sweet,cool enough to have a mild crust on the outside with melting chocolate on the inside.

Overall, we had a wonderful meal for a very reasonable price due to the Restaurant.com certificate. We ordered one prix fixe meals ($55 + $10 supplement for the steak) plus two starters (foie gras $22; onion soup: $17) and one entree (chicken $30). Subtract the $50 Restaurant.com certificate (we got at bargain basement prices), the meal ended up being $118.97 (including tax and 18% tip) which is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the cuisine. Definitely a solid four star review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,8,6,4,Dt_pCVrQAYbOM0YmlPLffg

Complimentary: 
Trio of Duck fat fries - BBQ, Truffled, Original 
(Delicious. Truffled was my favorite.)
Potato Foccacia bread 
(Greasy but that's how I like it.)

Entree:
8oz American Kobe Rib Cap 
(Smaller and more expensive than a bone in rib-eye but makes it up in taste.  If you're gonna go to a nice restaurant might as well spend a little more on something special.  Recommend the Kobe Rib Cap over the Kobe Rib ""eye"" but based on preference.  I love fat on my steak. )

Accompaniment:
Grilled Foie Gras
(Didn't actually order it but took some off my brother's plate.  It was amazing but I don't think I ever had one that wasn't.)

Sides:
Onion Rings Tomato - Dusted
(It was a bit too salty but for some reason I kept eating it)
Mac and Cheese - Truffled
(My favorite side of the meal. Recommended)
Scalloped Potatoes - Caramelized Onion & Goat Cheese
(Not a fan of goat cheese.  It was bleh.  Others enjoyed it a lot more than I did)
Spinach - Bacon-Creamed 
(It was good but nothing special)

The the meal quality and price was what I expected from a restaurant like StripSteak.  I enjoyed it very much.  The waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful.  I never had to wait and ask to have my cup refilled which is a big plus.

Why only 4 stars?

My friend made reservations a month in advance but when we were about to get seated our table was given to the group on the next table in order to expand and accommodate them.  When we asked for another empty table, we were told they were reserved for a different group.  Really? That table that was given to the other group was reserved too.  I highly doubt the empty table was specifically asked for.  Then after waiting ten more minutes, we were given a table in the corner next to the kitchen.  Maybe we   didn't look classy enough but then again you don't play hip hop in a classy restaurant.

The duck fat fries.....they were nothing special, they are friggin fries, come on people!  I think people get too caught up in the atmosphere and alleged reputation of places to form an honest opinion.   You ever see those shows where they swap the food at a fancy restaurant with some take out and people still think the food is fabulous and the best they've ever had?

This place was just average.  When I say average I mean average compared to comparable steakhouses.  It was by no means near the quality of Sizzler but far from  what I would expect for the price I paid.  The Caesar Salad was terrible.   The side dishes were actually pretty good, I had the scalloped potatoes.  I ordered a Kansas City Strip Steak.  It was OK, somewhat flavorful but was still missing that ""wow factor"".   I was a bit disappointed considering the price.  You don't always get what you pay for.  My rating of 3 stars is being very generous.

this is really all i need to write.
what else does anyone need?
well, at a steak house, steak, i suppose.

unfortunately, i can not personally attest to the meaty goodness here except to say that the oohs, aahs and mms coming from the meat eaters at my table distracted me from my overcooked salmon.
yeah yeah, i know, why order fish at a steak house?
well, because most steak houses usually serve some of the best seafood.
i was actually quite surprised when i stuck my fork into my overcooked salmon because on a previous visit here, the trout i ordered was absolutely perfect in every way.
consistency people, that's all i ask.
it was especially disappointing since i specifically ordered it ""rare in the middle, please.""

what i can say is that the service is outstanding every time.
our server, upon noticing that i had only taken 2 bites from my salmon, asked me if there was something wrong with my meal and whether there was something she could do to fix it.
as grateful as i was for her attentiveness and willingness to help, i declined as i was already incredibly full from the duck fat fries, heirloom tomato salad, broccolini, mashed potatoes and truffle mac n cheese.
all, by the way, were freakin uhhmazing!!!
the last thing i needed at that point was another entree.

dessert was fairly standard.
nothing exciting to share about it.

Got the foie gras tasting menu for $85, half of the dishes you could not even taste the foie gras!  The appetizer was a gazpacho with foie ice cream.  Just some cold soup.  The salad was ok, but a tiny tiny portion.  However there was a silver dollar size of foie on it, tasted good, and a bit of lobster.  The only dish that was completely finished.  The wagyu eye was tasteless and kind of dense, although it was soft, but I didn't care for it at all, and the foie mousse was more like liquefied beef liver.  The dessert of beignets I actually asked for to go bc I could not stand being in there any longer.  The foie gelee you dip it in just tasted like fruit jam.

Other things worth noting:
We had reservations for 6pm.  There were only a few tables in the place, but it took so long between courses for the plates to come.  We already informed our server that we had time constraints as we needed to be someplace afterward.  I left approx 7:30.  Took forever to get the bill too, which came out to $111 for the tasting menu and an order of oysters ($18 for 1/2 doz)  The oysters were ok but I can get those anywhere for much less.

Also the server was really annoying by always asking if we were done with a dish or not by saying ""are you still enjoying this?"" *rolleyes* If I was enjoying it, the plate would be empty.

The duck fat fries were the amuse buche.  They came out lukewarm.  The Old bay seasoned ones were way over the top salty.  Nothing special, they are just fries.  Don't see how the duck fat made any difference.

The music they play is terrible.  Who's that singer guy that was in the club scene in the first Nutty Professor movie?  ""This is how we do it"" song?  they played that.  Yes, that song.  OMG  That was when my bf walked out.

As for food, we had the tomahawk which was huge (suppose to be) and it definitely did its job filling up the men. I had the shellfish ""tower"" which wasn't a tower by any means. And for lack of better words was a total rip off.   You have to order it for a minimum of 2 ppl. I ordered it for myself since I love seafood. Now keeping in mind that I have ordered shellfish towers before at multiple steak houses before what I got was a total disappointment.

Bobby Flay was at the table next to ours with his crew. Raj as usual has put together a nice wine list though we all found it a bit strange that there are so many Austrian Rieslings' at a restaurant that revolves largely around meat and more meat. Maybe I am missing something... I found the food a bit mediocre particularly for the price ($36 for skirt steak or $50 for a filet. The Kobe beef started at $50 for American to $195 for Japanese, all ala carte.) The many sides of potatoes were nearly the consistency of a soup with some actually bleeding liquid when dished on to the plates. The mac n cheese though very tasty with the truffle oil was dry with absolutely no creaminess ever being apparent. The foie gras ""sliders"" though tasty and a very large portion of liver did not quite translate. The sweet potatoe mash was so dosed up on clove as to make it unedible.  For dessert we had the mini doughnuts with a trio of sauces. The sauces were tasty but unfortunately the doughnuts were over cooked and very dry. Service however was exceptional and friendly.

For wine we had a great bottle of 2004 Freeman Akiko's Cuvee.
The Akiko's Cuvee has always been my favorite Freeman wine besides the chardonnays and last night was no exception. We popped and poured and she was away to the races right away. Out of the gate this wine has a haunting nose of cherries, cranberry and black licorice with baking spice and a touch of shitake mushroom. The palate is incredibly silky with super fine tannins with. Everyone at the table called it soft. Sweet ripe fruits are in abundance but the fine tannins keep them in check. The oak in this bottle is much more integrated than the last bottle I had providing an immensely seamless pleasurable experience.

Happy Hour:  Every day from 4 PM to 5:30 PM! 

YUMMY!!!!

Ok this place has it all.. well almost. The husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice little dinner. We were super happy to know that this place also has happy hour so we showed up for that. 

* I ordered their white sangria. Unfortunately I should have maybe ordered some wine. The sangria was not tasty because it was soooo sweet. Not my type of drink but maybe others would like it. I would say skip the sangria and stick to wine or beer.
* We ordered the smoked hummus for appetizers. That hummus was good! You had the nice smokey taste in it without being overwhelming. The pita bread was tasty too and warm. 

As for dinner:
* We were hoping to get their prefixed dinner but unfortunately we found out after seating down for dinner that they no longer had it. We were started with their well known complimentary duck fat fries that are served with different dipping sauces. I love fries so no matter what, I knew they would be good!
* We also ordered the yellow tail sashimi. Super duper, fresh, served with a bit of cucumber slices and some crispy rice and a little hint of chili. Best yellow tail I've ever had! I would have been one happy girl with two more orders of this all for myself (and I'm not one to choose fish over beef). $22
 * For main dish we ordered 8oz of mishima reserved wagyu rib eye. This is the first time I've ever had wagyu and it for sure set the standards high. The meat was cooked to perfected and to order. Way juicy and oh so very tender. $69
* We ended our dinner with the beignets! These are so not the disneyland beignets we know but holy crap are they bomb! That macallan 18 butterscotch sauce, I want to swim in it! That sauce that sauce that sauce!!!! I am not even a btuterscotch person so I am glad I gave it a shot with an open mind because I was blown away! Highly recommened!

When they give you the check, they give you a little bag of popcorn on the house. Nice little extra touch. 

Great place for a date! Make sure to call to make reservations.

My steak was overcooked, the trio of pureed potatoes or whatever they call it was a joke, and the trio of ""duck fat"" fries must have been fried in 5% duck fat or something, because they tasted like something Burger King would serve (except for the white truffle ones, but how can you screw that up, really?).

The three pureed potatoes dishes were lobster, which, while I love big chunks of lobster, tasted like an experiment on how to get starchy potatoes and a bag of white flour into a pasty goo reminiscent of gruel which clung so steadfastly to the lobster chunks that it didn't offer the opportunity to salvage them from the muck, the sour cream and chive version, almost as gooey and I guess was worth one taste, and the third, horseradish, I guess was supposed to be some kind of traditional take on wasabi mashed potatoes you would have seen on every menu five years ago.

Service wasn't anything to brag about either. This is another one of those places where they really need to train their waitstaff a little better. For this kind of money and they large crowd it draws, they should be watching for your fork and knife to come together on the plate in the interest of turning the table over.

We sat in the lounge this time to get more of an intimate feel (I guess the birthday girl was in a festive mood) and it did deliver with getting a bit out of the limelight of the main dining area. We sat right next to the bar area which may have lead to the consumption of alcohol at random.

For starters we were given the fries and yes the duck fat fries. Those for some reason just always have me quacking up a storm. The dipping sauces that accompany it do seem to add a special dose of flavor to it, but I was not a fan of the house made ketchup. It just tasted a bit more tomato like then I prefer.

As the main event I went with the filet mignon and partnered that with the Mac and cheese and spicy pork belly rice. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and melted away once again with every bite. The highlight for me though is the Mac and cheese. It is well worth 3 hours every time and highly recommended. The noodles were soft and none overcooked which is a rarity. My favorite was the cheese though. It is not overloaded and just the gooeyness in each bite sends your mouth into a tailspin.

Waiting for the game, we ordered 3 appetizers and 3 rounds of cocktails.  Drinks were good, appetizers were just ok.

Then 30 mins into watching the game and getting ready to order $300 worth of Seafood, we were told by the Manager Robert, that a new group of people had arrived at their bar, and since their other TV was broken, that they were going to change the channel on the game as it was MANDALAY BAY HOTEL POLICY, to always select whatever the larger group of people wanted to watch.

In this case it was 5 people from Russia who wanted to watch a different game and as such, we were told we were not as important as us, and once again it was MANDALAY BAY POLICY!

So, they changed the channel so that 5 people could come in and order a round of water...LOL, and then basically said tough luck to us.

Imagine my chock when I called MANDALAY BAY only to find out that it was not hotel policy and rather the policy of the individual manager.    

So now, we have no idea who to believe, but, if you want to go to a loud, overpriced restaurant, where you can easily be treated as a nothing, if a larger party arrives, go to this joint.  

If not, find somewhere else.   There was a reason why when every other restaurant was packed with a waiting line, this place was 1/3 full!

I used to think beignets were just fancy donuts but stripsteak proved me wrong.  They were crispy on the outside and chewy but airy on the inside.  It came with a trio of sauces of which creme brûlée was my favorite.  The butterscotch was too bitter with an alcoholic after taste.  Definitely will come back next time i am in Vegas.

I thought that was such a nice touch. 

Duck fat fries complements of the chef was a great addition. I enjoyed the Fresc-ahhhh drink after Thomas' recommendation and my husband had an extra dirty martini with blue cheese olives. 

For dinner I had 8oz filet, husband had 16oz ribeye and we shared Mac and cheese and brussel sprouts. All was delicious! 

They ended the night with a scoop of birthday cake gelato and because it was Easter Sunday they sent us home with 2 bags of fresh caramel corn and chocolate eggs!

Excellent food--steak was amazing.
Very good service
Extensive wine list
Accommodating-- when a large party came in, the maitre d' asked us if we would mind moving tables for our dessert. Not only did they comp the desserts, but they added several more, and offered us complimentary coffee and after-dinner drinks.

Cons:
Extremely noisy! If the restaurant is filled, as it was the night I was there, you can barely hear the person sitting next to you; one of my table-mates, a corporate executive from Amsterday, said she had never been in such a noisy environment.

ask for medium rare
receive blood flowing raw
send back
receive charred on the outside no flowing blood but still clearly raw
send back
receive new steak- i tell the waiter to stay and watch, even before cutting i can tell that this steak (which is again charred on the outside) will again be raw
no steak for me this night

manager makes cursory attempt at apology, takes steak off, gee big thank you there considering i didn't eat it, nothing else was comped, i figure since my wife pretty much ate alone that they would have made up a little more-  dont think i ever paid over $200 for a meal i didnt get to eat before, and i dont intend on doing it again

I started with the prosciutto tart and while it was crumbly, it was light but still wowed me. to be honest, I was full by the end of having half of the tart. Those fries were seriously delicious! Why can't I buy those sauces anywhere?!

I ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it was easy to cut and easy to love. It had a cheesy taste to it and was delicious.

I tried two sides - the spinach soufflé and the baked potato. The baked potato was like any kind of baked potato I've ever had. It was so smooth, but still a potato, with all kinds of flavors. The soufflé had Parmesan sauce over it and it was very yummy. I personally liked the baked potato more than the soufflé.

We had wanted to have a glass of wine at Aureole before dinner, but the hostess said if we waited an hour they would be unable to seat us due the the RUSH concert ending. Somehow, I could not fathom hordes of mullet haired Rush fans descending on StripSteak. They never came. But later that evening, as I was happily  losing money in the casino they arrived in droves.

Easy enough to make reservation.  We arrived early and was seated right away.  Good start.  Server Alex was attentive but not overly hovering.
Two of us in our party went with the Wagu Ribeye Cap as suggested by the server.  One went with the striped bass, and one with the lobster.
The good:  Service, relaxed environment of the restaurant, the French Fries brought to our table, the sides (creamed spinach and potatoes). 
The bad:  Two orders of the most expensive cut of meat on the menu, and they look completely different.  One was 8oz as described and cooked perfectly, and one (mine) looked to be about 5oz, thin and almost raw inside when I ordered it medium well.  The server offered to re-fire it, but not wanting to disrupt the flow of the meal, I declined.

I had the crab cakes and they were heaven. THe crab was so delicious and fresh.
As an entree I had the scallops. Amazing. Perfect. So fresh. One of the guys we were with got the truffle mac and cheese and I ate off of his plate lol ... that truffle mac and cheese was amazing..... soo good!

StripSteak is one of Michael Mina's restaurants and it doesn't disappoint. Located inside the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, the space is vaulted and beautiful. We were promptly greeted by a friendly host and taken to our seats in the back of the restaurant.  The Sommelier came right over and poured us a bottle of champagne on the house (yes, knowing Michael has its perks) and we began the amazing menu. 

Courses: 

1. Three variations of fries. 
2. Hamachi course topped with osetera caviar. Um, yes please. 
3. 64.5 degree egg on a bed of quinoa, duck prosciutto, and asparagus.  
4. Bass with kiffir lime broth and crispy onions
5. Pork belly with a tempura fried mussel
6. Wagu Beef, Alaskan king crab, and truffles for daaaaayzzzzzz

Our sides consisted of taziki asparagus, mushrooms and pearl onions, and a wonderfully spiced vegetable risotto.

My friend and I started off our dinner, after watching ""Love"", with the Crab Cakes, Tomato Preserve, Tabasco Vinaigrette and the Lobster, Chilled, Black Truffle Vinaigrette,Baby Lettuces.  Both were excellent.  They even gave us the StripSteak Trio of Duck Fat Fries complementary. The sauces severed with the fries were a barbecue, truffle, and ketchup.  The truffle sauce was the best.  Our entrees were the American Kobe Rib Cap and American Kobe Fillet Mignon.  Both of the Kobe beef was cooked to perfection of medium rare and seasoned perfectly.  It was so soft, that you didn't need a knife to cut it, especially the rib cap...gotta love that marbled fat. We accompanied our steaks with the Sauteed Baby Brussel Sprouts, Bacon Lardon Steam Asparagus, Mascarpone Beurre Blanc.  The brussel sprouts were out of this world...again, cheers to fat, this time the bacon.

I was so stuffed, but I forged on to eat dessert. I had to live it up as it was my last night in Vegas.  We both shared the beignet with butterscotch pudding and the dough nut with banana fosters. Both desserts were OK, and here is where I think the improvement needs to be made.  The butterscotch pudding was not memorable, as it was not as sweet as I would have liked it to be.  

I would have given it 5 stars, but the dessert was a little let down. But the services was excellent.  Shout out to our server Kyle, another local boy from Hawaii, ""you da best"".  In all, a very enjoyable dinner.  Plus they gave me one of the menu's when I asked if they had a take home version.

The first night my $61 medium rare filet mignon was perfect, and the half order of mushrooms ($8) was fantastic. The second night, my $63 ribeye was not nearly as flavorful as a ribeye should be, and instead of preparing it medium rare, it was light pink and a definite medium, leaning toward medium well. I was starving so I didn't alert the bartender until he came by a few minutes later. I didn't want a new steak at that point so I just paid for it anyway. Premium steakhouses need to be able to provide a flavorful cut of meat and cook it as ordered. I was seriously disappointed.

And the coloration is not appetizing.  

But let's get on to what they do well.  The service here has always been amazing!  I have also had one of the most unique sides anywhere in the spinach soufflet.  The atmosphere is beautiful, and the restaurant has great energy.  More of what's good here - I have had the 4oz kobe and short rib entrée, it was amazing.  I had the wagyu filet, sliced to serve, also amazing.

I just wish there was a way to let guests know that ordering any regular steak from the menu is not taken seriously in the kitchen.  But if you spend an extra 20 bucks or more to get a premium selection, you will find yourself with a steak house quality meal.

Is it wrong that I ordered a second serving of the duck fat fries?  I couldn't help myself.

So from a recommendation from My T, I ordered the Wagyu Rib Cap... it is a slightly different cut from the Wagyu Rib Eye, and just $3 more.  According to our server, it is a special cut from the top of the ribs, and slightly more flavorful than the rib eye.  Honestly, I bet they are both delicious.  My medium rib cap came out, it was tender as all tenderness can be.  I had to resist eating it within 10 seconds.  Our sides were the trio of mashed potato (Horseradish, Sour cream and onion, and lobster).  I may have an eating disorder because I was dipping my duck fat fries and using the mashed potatoes as a dipping sauce.

Great meal, our server was very informative.  The restaurant is really nice and not loud like some of the steakhouses can be in Vegas (sometimes you feel like you're at a nightclub!)  There is a great picture spot where they have all the olive oil in jars along the wall).  I'm not sure how an animal activist will handle this place because there are glass windows with the Wagyu beef hanging.  I'm not sure if that would be the design of my choice personally, but the food will steal the show once it is cooked and in front of you, I promise.",jX7n6KfNZ22kBh6AHhxRbA,0,0,5,9_qJEaxPXJ7cGdvrOZ5clw

First, this meal will not be inexpensive by most standards. Our group, each having two cocktails each, sides and steak had about a $600 meal total for 4 people. As long as you know this you should enjoy the experience. 

The duck fries were phenomenal, the tar tar worth ordering and the mac and cheese side was also delicious!

We ordered the prime rib eye (highly recommend) and the filet mignon. Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned to the point where somehow I ate like a pound of cow and my mouth was exploding with flavor. 

Ambiance is just ok in my opinion given its location in a strip area of Mandalay. Nothing too out of the ordinary and I didn't really find the setting too intimate.

Maybe I don't have a sophisticated pallet, or maybe I didn't look like I would give up the tip to be seated in a location other than the bar when we were told there was a 45 minute wait for a table. Since we asked the Concierge for a recommendation and reservation information, we definitely would have had them make us reservations instead of the option of the 45 minute wait. We were in view of a group of tables that weren't occupied the entire time we were there and later realized that the restaurant was larger then we were aware of and there were numerous tables Unoccupied we wondered why we weren't seated at a table in the restaurant. We had just missed the happy hour apparently so the rush to get those prices shouldn't have been a problem. It was a Sunday evening last NFL playoff, CES and the Adult Film Awards were over. The hostesses didn't really bother to stop their personal conversation when we approached so it set the tone of what I felt was going to be a negative experience. Because we were seated in the worst seats in the open bar area, I had a first hand view of the open tables that no one was using the entire 1.5 to 2 hours we were at the restaurant. I also had the honor of facing the hostesses that apparently were employed to have conversations with each other until the big boss came along. But that is enough about them.
The waitress was attentive gave suggestions and checked in often as well as other staff of the restaurant. Now the restaurant is not some place you would bring your family because it is quite pricey. Since I was being treated I didn't feel that I should order steak from the steak house. Everything is alacart, so expect to spend upward of $100 per person. My companion is a foodie. Likes new and different things. She ordered the pork belly and potatoes scalloped. I ordered beet salad and lobster taco. Now this was supposed to be a fine dining experience (pinky raised), but I have to say not accommodating for menu item adjustments. I asked for pecans with my beet salad. I may have gotten two lonely perfectly positioned pecans. I also realized why there was a pause when I requested additional dressing options. Well my appetizer selection was not a substitute for a meal. The lobster taco had more pico than lobster. I could count the meniscal pieces of lobster. It needed salt and something acidic.  Just a precautionary measure of advice. Do not go here if you are hungry portions are small, small, small. My daughter loved her pork belly. It was deceiving lite, crispy and not as greasy as I expected. The potatoes were alright. The best part of the meal were the French fries that we tried to guess what the seasonings were as well as the sauces. I agree that the catsup was my least favorite. So to the hostesses I say don't judge a customer by its cover. You did pass up a good tip by not seating us.

The waitress had recommended this after my husband said that we wanted a vegetable.  Cake cooked with vegetable doesn't exactly count in my book.

We ordered drinks and two appetizers from the happy hour menu to start - duck fat fries and beef short rib tacos. I had a cucumber martini which was excellent, and my friend had some sort of coconut rum/mango thing which was too sweet for me but she liked it. We then went ahead and ordered the two ""entrees"" they have on the happy hour menu, which is a burger and a steak. 

The fries and tacos were really good. Unfortunately we didn't realize the burger and steak both came with fries, so we were really french fried out!!!! If we'd known, we could have gone with a different appetizer, oh well, hindsight is 20-20. And we didn't order at the same time, so the waitress couldn't ""warn"" us :-).

The steak was good, but the burger was divine! So delicious, who knew a burger could be so good???? And way too much food! We were still under out $100 so ordered a dessert and some cookies to go. My friend ate the apple tart later and said it was good, and I had the cookies later and they were good. Our total bill before tax and tip was $101, so dead on for getting our discount!

I'm docking a star simply because of the experience with using the coupon. The waitress had to get a manager, and it took a while. Then apparently my app timed out on my, and when the manager hit ""redeem"" for some reason it showed up that I had already used it. The manager looked at me like I was trying to scam them, and said that they would honor it anyway. I told her I hadn't used it, and then logged back in and tried again and this time it showed that it was valid and redeemed that day. But she didn't even look at it. They did honor it, but made me feel like I was some kind of crook. They add an 18% gratuity automatically, and with that and tax even with our coupon it was $75.00.

The salmon served at Stripsteak is right up there. My husband loved his filet which was delicious.  The Gratin with smoked Gouda was decadent. The potatoes were cooked to perfection and the Gouda was so creamy and rich. The BLT Wedge was probably my favorite part of the meal. The bacon was amazing - crisp but juicy and the right amount of smoke. They also started is off with a trio of fries and dipping sauces which were a very pleasant and tasty surprise! And then they also sent us home with a treat of gourmet popcorn. The drinks were terrific too - I tried the cucumber martini which was lightly sweet and refreshing.  Our server Brian was fantastic.

Mind you the food wasn't horrible, but the experience of a steak house was completely null and void. If I wanted food court atmosphere and noise, I would have opted for the McDonald's McRib and saved myself $130.  
Additionally, when I sit down at a famous chefs restaurant, make sure I don't have the capability to make better side dishes or steaks (from what I gather none of the guys who had steak enjoyed it) at home. And for the prices that are charged, offering me a 'french fry' sampler 'compliments of the house' was pretty tacky...don't give ketchup a fancy name in the hopes I'd never had ketchup before and didn't know what it tasted like.

It's hard to eat a fatty medium rare piece of meat when it is closer to room temperature.  Cold fat is not good.

We went here with a group and ate on a thursday night, we had no problem getting a table for 4 at 8pm with reservations.   

I had the lobster with bacon appetizer which was honestly the lowlight of my meal but still very good.   My wife had a beet salad which looked nice and a friend of mine split onion rings with the table.   The free fries were also amazing and we loved the different sauces.

Next came the main courses.   My wife ordered a filet done perfectly.   My friends GF had the halibut which was also excellent.   I had the regular rib eye and the king crap options as did my friend.   Let me just say this steak was seasoned and cooked PERFECTLY.   The king crap legs that were the side were amazing.   They were split and all of the good parts were left.   A great addition! 

We got the mashed potato sides  as well as a mushroom that was part of a forrest fire.

None of the steaks (Angus Ribeye, Angus Strips) were exceptional, although the strips were at least cooked to order properly (rare).  The Bone-in ribeye (my steak) was extremely thin,  overcooked, and lacking any salt at all.   I've had better steaks from national chains at 50% price point, and certainly from my butcher and backyard.

The duck fat fries were actually the best part of our meal by far, and would definitely order them again.  

The restaurant wasn't very busy so it's hard to say how the staff is during peak times, but the service was very good for us at 7:30 on a weekday.  Friendly, prompt, enjoyable.

I've appreciated Michael Mina's flair with food for well over a decade now, even going back to his days as Exec Chef at Aqua in San Francisco. With StripSteak he has elevated the steak eating experience to the level of the top 1% of steak restaurants in the country. 

Restaurant: Warm, well decorated and easy to access from the parking garage or the hotel rooms. I also found the noise level to be very moderate. 

Food: 3 seasoned choices of duck fat fried French fries were the free starter we enjoyed with 3 amazing dips to go with them. Very good! 
My daughter and I ordered the Hamachi crispy rice starter. The flavors were amazing, presentation was good and all very fresh. 
My wife ordered the Sweet Corn soup and we all had a taste (she's vegetarian), and it was fantastic, possibly the best corn based soup I've ever had. 
The main course... My daughter ordered the Wagyu 8oz Filet and I ordered the World Wide Wagyu. The Wagyu filet was cooked rare and was really amazing. Easily compares with the top 5-6 steaks I've ever eaten. No sauce, no rub, just amazing and perfectly cooked beef. Truly fantastic. My World Wide Wagyu had a trio of meat, Wagyu tenderloin, short rib, and rib cap. My least favorite was the short rib, I'm not really a short rib guy, the rib cap was amazing but the tenderloin moved right up into the top 1-3 pieces of steak I've ever eaten. If I could have married that steak, I would have called for a justice of the peace right there. 
My wife had the special with an excellent Ravioli over a bed of perfectly cooked veggies. Very, very good. 

Dessert was a trio of ""dips"" with beignets. The first dip was a cream brulee, the 2nd a chocolate moose and the 3rd a McCallan infused butterscotch (Scotch with Butterscotch). All of the items were amazing.

My wife and I arrived early -- about half an hour before our reservation. The hostess still seated us promptly at a small circular two-top, but in the back of the lounge, in between the bar and the main dining area. It was very comfy -- her on a long bench with big cushions, me in an oversized chair -- but not ideal for eating a meal because of how low the chairs are in relation to the table. Add to that the deafening sound of all the lounge chatter and music and it was difficult to have a conversation.

The food wasn't bad at all. As a matter of fact, some of it was great. But, I think there's better value to be had elsewhere.

To start you off, they bring out a complimentary trio of fries (Old Bay flavored, Garlic herb, and truffle oil). All were some of the best fries I've had, with the garlic herb being my favorite. They were perfectly crispy, light, and addictive. We had to force each other to stop eating them and save room for the rest of our food.

//Appetizers//
Sweet onion soup ($17) - morels, parmesan crouton. Excellent depth in flavors, earthy and delicious mushrooms.

Main lobster fritters ($20) - bacon-wrapped fritters. Three per order. The lobster flavor was masked by the oiliness and saltiness of the dish. But the crispness and coolness of the lettuce wrap was a nice compliment. Not worth getting again.

//Entree and sides//
10 oz. filet ($56). They were nice enough to split it for us since we wanted to share. Ordered it medium rare, but it came out closer to rare. Tender and savory, but not nearly as good as the filet at Carnevino.

Two sides of king crab ($24 ea.). Each order contained two meaty crab legs with lemon. Served cold, it could have benefitted from some drawn butter.

Shallot potato cakes ($9) - scallion creme fraiche. Three cakes. Perfectly crispy, great flavor... kinda like the greatest hash browns you'll ever have.

English peas ($14) - shaved fennel, pancetta. Peas are peas, nothing extraordinary, but the pancetta added a good bit of savoriness and salitness.

Overall, the food was pretty good, service not very attentive, the sommelier suggested a wine we weren't crazy about, seating was comfy but not functional, and it was too loud to carry a conversation. Oh, and I forgot pricey. But we did have a $50 restaurant.com gift card that helped mitigate the damage.

We had a large party of 16 people for my 30th birthday. I called ahead about a week. No problem! They couldn't get us at one large table, but we were seated next to each other along the back wall across from the freezers. I was told this at the time of the reservation. 

The service was excellent. My sister and Parents got a cheap bottle of wine(95 bucks). 

Appetizer of lobster in tempura with some kind of cream sauce was awesome! It comes on a stick (fried) then you dip it in the sauce, pull it off the stick and wrap it in a leaf of lettuce. mmmmmmmmmm. 
We also got the Kobe tart tare. Its different, my pops freaking loved it. 

The main course!! I got the American Kobe (65 bucks) it was grub, super soft 8oz. Mom and brother in-law went for the rib eye. Get it off the prefix menu, Its 55 bucks for anything off the list. If you order the rib eye you pay 10 bucks more and get the same cut you would order of the a la cart! Excellent value!! My wife got a special cut, I don't know if they always have it, it wasn't on the menu.....it should be!! Bone in fillet Mignon!!! IT WAS BETTER THAN MY KOBE i think it was 58 bucks 14 oz with bone. My pops order the standard fillet mignon. Not as tender as the bone in, but excellent. The rest of the group ordered off the prefix, no one complained about the steaks being over cooked. 

SIDES, you only need one side for every 3 people!!! I personally tried a bunch of them and you cant go wrong with any!! Mac and Cheese is the best hands down. The rest are great, spinach, potatoes with caramelized onions were bad ass, peas were freaking unbelievable, they tasted like they were picked an hour ago!! Onion rings, well they were onion rings. 

Deserts were great!! everyone got the doughnuts that come with the prefix. I went for the 12 dollar cheese cake. It tasted like it was twelve bucks!! Caramelized black berries. Enough said! I wobbled back to the casino. 

At the end of the night the bill for my family of 6 was about $700 bucks.

2815975,2017-07-17,4,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I have been a fan of StripSteak for a long time. This upscale modern steakhouse is located inside the Mandalay Bay Casino back towards the convention center area. They have a large bar and seating area with an open wood grill and aging coolers.

Service and selection are personal and top notch. This is an excellent place to get a modern twist on a classic steakhouse menu. The beef is the star with custom aged prime and waygu-style options. You will likely be offered complimentary duck fat fries with your order in lieu of bread which makes for a unique appetizer.

On my visit, I stuck with the classic combination of a steak and wine. Of course, this was a Mishima Reserve rib cab paired with a wonderful Bordeaux. The steak was good perfectly with a wonderful flavor and fattiness that complimented the earthy wine very well. The chef added a small cornbread muffin with the steak as an amuse. Paring the fries with the steak helped round out the meal.

Dessert was another level. StripSteak is justifiably famous for their beignets, but I chose the Affogado Bout It. This was simply amazing with a DIY serving of house made ice cream, fresh espresso, and Dragon's Milk Barrel Aged Stout. Combining the three made for a wonderful end to an amazing dinner.

This is a fun place to impress your guests with a fun take on a classic steakhouse. The cocktails and wine list are extensive and pair well with the food. The appetizers and sides are really good, especially when the fries arrive.

I read reviews beforehand that warned about slow service. After we took some time to look over the menu and decided what we wanted we were given Duck Fat Fries with three sauces. These are amazing and I do hope that people get a chance to try them.

For my appetizer I ordered the Maine Lobster Fritters, which were to die for. For dinner I had the Braised Pork Shank, others in my park had the 12 oz.

Staff:  Great staff.  Accommodated well. Had birthday card signed by staff members on the table. Made effort to attend to our needs as far as noise level.  Very attentive. 

Food:  Not the best for steak IMO. Ordered rib eye (not the wagyu) medium rare.  Had better steak at other high end steak houses. Rice pilaf was bland. Wife got 6 or 8oz filet. Ordered well done. Butterflied but still didn't come out well done. Had to send back to get cooked some more.  Comp'd fries were awesome. Came with 3 sauces. Each was unique and good.

The service was one of best I've received, as the wine kept pouring in and we were checked in every 10 minutes, also easy to flag down as needed despite busy setting.

Here is what we had:

*Duck fat fries with trio of dipping sauces (complimentary) - seriously we could have stopped here because they were really really freaking delicious. All four of us loved the truffle aioli dipping sauce the best.
*Rosemary bread (complimentary) - soft and very good, but perhaps a little unncessary because of the fries
*Maryland blue crab chowder - course 1 of the prix fixe for 2 of the 4
*Bibb Wedge salad - my prix fixe first course. It was the perfect size and had a good blue cheese flavor without entirely overpowering the whole dish.
*Ribeye - course 2 of the prix fixe for two of the four of my group
*Organic half chicken - my entree. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the truffle mac and cheese the chicken sat on was the perfect side, and the onion au jus gave the entire dish a good flavor.
*Potato puree trio - order this for the lobster mash alone. You will thank me.
*Beignets - 2 of us got the chocolate pot de creme and one got the creme brulee. The beignets were a good, light dessert to end an indulgent meal.

Service was outstanding. Our waitress was phenomenal - super friendly, helpful, and the right amount of attentive. Prices are what you would expect to pay at a good, upscale, fine dining restaurant.

The Rib Cap was tender.  I asked to have it prepared rare-plus, but once again, the server recommended that I try the steak medium-rare instead.  I think I would have preferred it rare-plus as the medium-rare was a bit over cooked for my taste.

The free appetizers of french fries cooked in duck fat with exotic dipping sauces is a redeeming value.  But for a party of 7 they only brought 2 servings and then wanted to charge us for more.  If we were single diners, we each would have received one?  So why be so cheap?

EVERYTHING is ala carte - main courses require sides to make them a complete meal.  This really jacks up the price.  
Caesar salad around $15 was small.  The $65 ahi tuna was ordered rare with seared outside - it was delivered cooked entirely through.  Small in size and cooked incorrectly.

The spinach side dish is awesome as are the sliced au gratin potatoes.

2958023,2010-05-06,3,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Few things satisfy one's appetite in such a primal way as steak. And few chefs are as innovative with food as Michael Mina. So when searching for a place with an innovative approach to steak, StripSteak should have been a no brainer, right?

As it turned out, StripSteak was a bit of a letdown. The reason, however, is a little hard to pin down. Suffice it to say that I found the restaurant both overwhelming and underwhelming.

What was overwhelming were the ways in which they attempted to ""bribe"" you into loving the restaurant. This begins the second you sit down, when they parade out to your table a Trio of Duck Fat Fries. Now who can resist duck fat fries? Clearly I was being manipulated here, and the truffle oil fries did just that. That said, because they bring them out to every table, while lying in wait for their next victim, the fries don't come out as hot and fresh as they could be. In addition to the fries, they also bring out to your table a cast iron pan of potato focaccia bread, which was delicious but dense. All this before even getting our appetizers!

For our meal, we both opted for the prix fixe menu, which is a fair deal at $55.

1st Course

Maryland Blue Crab Chowder | Bacon Lardon, Parsnip -- Intense crab flavor but a little watery. Not my favorite.

Bibb Wedge | Avocado, Bacon, Oregon Smokey Blue  -- Good flavor, but I felt like I have had this before. Surprisingly staid for Michael Mina. In fact, both these dishes were really underwhelming.

2nd Course

Slow-Poached Prime Rib of Beef | Select Seasonal Side Dishes -- The meat was well cooked, but honestly, I have made better prime rib at home. The side dishes consisted of a wonderful brussels sprouts slaw, a predictable truffled mac and cheese, and an insipid creamed spinach.

Dry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye ($10 surcharge) -- This was delicious, perfectly cooked, and full of flavor. Now this is the reason that one comes to a steakhouse, not for all the distractions and bribes. And this is the reason I brought the 2006 Scarecrow Cabernet Sauvignon ($35 corkage), which paired perfectly with the meat.

3rd Course

Michael's Root Beer Float | Sassafras Ice Cream, Chocolate Chip Cookies  -- Pure yum! I could have had a pitcher of this.

Finally, as if this wasn't enough, before you leave and write your Yelp review, they present you with a bag of Chocolate Almond Brittle. Again, a bribe.

The service was for the most friendly and unpretentious, with the exception of the person who came to open and decant our wine (I don't think he was the somm). He seemed a little snotty and did not smile at all.

So would I come back again? Probably not, but I did enjoy some aspects of our meal. The next time I'm in Las Vegas and want to do a Michael Mina restaurant, I'll head to Nobhill Tavern instead.",cWVsDzn7L7dwL9c5tubwaQ,5,3,3,IsnJYN-KdMb1sIebgjW-CQ

The nerve of them to charge $30 for this. The mgr came over and asked what was wrong and i told him that the vegetarian entree prepared by the chef was disappointing to say the least and i showed him the hummus. He seemed shocked saying how people ask for the recipe of the hummus all the time. Not a very good response to someone who was clearly not happy with what was supposed to be an entree. It looked like the chef just threw together whatever he had laying around and called it an entree. Even more Strange since no where on the menu can you even order hummus so how would anyone even know that they make it to ask for the recipe? The appetizer we ordered originally was artichokes in a cream sauce but when it arrived it was nothing more than a greasy sloppy mess of a ""soup"" swimming in butter so we sent it back. Didn't even bother to tell the mgr about that one because i really didn't want to hear how that recipe is often requested as well. It was horrid. My husband had a steak and it was just ok. Nothing special about this place at all and in my opinion it's just another overpriced restaurant in a strip hotel. Ive been to much better ones at other hotels.

The first time I ate here, it was my first experience in a Michael Mina restaurant. Our group of 4 was making its way through Mandalay looking for something tasty. As we made our choice, we were seated promptly. Now since this was over 2 years ago, I don't remember every detail of the meal, but I remember liking it overall. I don't think our guests were as pleased, but I don't remember exactly why. I do remember my date got a shashimi plate that he loved. 

Fast forward to January 2010, on a family trip to Vegas we needed a nice place to take the parents that wasn't too ""scary"". Since we knew StripSteak was mainly ""meat and potatoes"" we thought it was fitting.

We started with drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. One of my favorite things to do is to find a well-stocked bar and order all my favorites. First, a French 75. The bartender was so tickled that he got the chance to whip out his cocktail book and make it for me. It was delicious. Next, was a Ramos Gin Fizz, which contains egg whites. It is very hard to find a bar with egg whites. Once again, he told me he loved the challenge. It too was delicious. 

We were seated in almost the exact same spot we were 2 years prior, which I found amusing. Our waiter was a tad arrogant who at one point told us the kitchen was slammed so if we didn't want to wait forever for our food, we should order right away. I thought this was so out of line. The whole time he stared at us like we were just ""dumb kids"" visiting from some BFN town dragging our parents along with us. By the end of the meal I couldn't stand him.

The food overall was good. I was pleased with the assortment of duck fat fries that was delivered to our table, complements of the house. I love anything cooked in duck fat and was very pleased. The bread brought out was also so delicious. I don't claim to be a typical woman who ""loves bread"" and I don't think it is a requirement of every restaurant on the planet, but when its good, it is so appreciated. I started with a duck confit, poached egg and frisee salad. I am not usually a fan of frisee but since the dressing, duck and egg was warm it wilted the frisee to a perfectly edible point. Unfortunately, the salad was way under-seasoned and craved salt. Next I had a Kobe beef filet, rare, and the goat cheese gratin. The beef was wonderful, tender, rich and decadent. The gratin too was amazing. I couldn't stop eating it! 

Overall, based on both trips I think its overall good, but not great. I think next time I want to try Wolfgang's Cut.",nYIH8IHzWp3j33L3qsAz5Q,0,0,4,4AUEyw2fcRqPufoaAOXqEg

The poppers and sashimi were fine, but not too exciting...just average. The gratin was phenomenal. It's very indulgent and filling. I don't recommend it for those watching their weight (if they are then this ain't the city for them).

We each had the wagyu rib cap. Interesting story behind this. There are only two places in Vegas to get this. The chef from Stripsteak is now the chef at Gordon Ramsey.

To top everything off afterwards, I was fortunate to meet Chef Bell and thank him for a fantastic culinary experience.

When we got there, there was a slight wait even though we had reservations and the place was clearly empty (common restaurant tactic in order to drive patrons to wait/drink at their bar, which we did). It wasn't a problem as we were planning on trying some of their specialty cocktails on their happy hour menu anyway, and I had budgeted plenty of time for dinner before our Lion King show later in the night. We got to chat up two of the bartenders over a mojito and Stripsteak Sour. Drinks were okay; nothing out of this world. The bartenders were pretty outgoing, though it was obvious they were tired of hearing about what tourists had planned for their trips, even so, they continue to ask.

I have to say, our waiter (Glen H) was awesome the whole night. He was extremely attentive, and we didn't notice any decline in service after we had ordered our meal. He answered questions on the menu items (which I always have at these type of places where they have fancy names for everything), and was around just enough but not too much.

Food is served with a complimentary trio of duck fat fries, which were amazing. I ordered the prix fixe menu as planned and chose the salad wedge, prime rib, and root beer float dessert. My girlfriend ordered the Kobe burger with a side of duck fat fries (we didn't know we would be getting complimentary fries before we had ordered, and she really wanted to try them).

The meal was excellent. The duck fat fries were a perfect start and the prime rib was surprisingly filling (I got triple sides of mac n cheese as well lol). The root beer float was not my thing. To be honest, I'm not sure how different you can do a root beer float, so I found it somewhat uncharacteristic of this type of restaurant.

All in all, we kept the bill to $150, and that's with four drinks (a head's up, the specials go from $6 to $13 after 7pm, which I hadn't noticed before we had ordered our seconds). We even had leftovers, though I warn that duck fat fries do not taste good at all cold, so kill these at the restaurant (the fat begins to harden).

I think the prix fixe menu served its purpose in wetting our appetite for Stripsteak. I would love to come back again soon. Nice bar, comfortable seating area. It was a near perfect dinner. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.",HCPpzzWzdFLIhJHNNgCheQ,3,0,5,Z3YFPz56HKInq9dXuleZ_g

We had a nice table in the open area of the restaurant, I would've preferred a more intimate dinner, but the ambiance was still chill.  Our server was very nice, and ended up actually being from Hawaii (I think his name is Brian), so that was nice!

We pretty much knew what we were going to order, since we studied their menu before our trip!!  He got the 30oz Porterhouse, and I got the Veal Chop.  For sides, we ordered their Truffled Mac & Cheese and Scalloped Potatoes.  Of course we got their complimentary Duck Fat Fries, which were effin' awesome with their little dipping sauces...I had a glass of wine and he, a beer.

Our food was very good, my BF ate ALL of his steak - and it was a huge one!!  I had a bite, and it was delicious.  So was my Veal Chop - it was big, and I couldn't finish it, but that's what BFs are for ~ he ate the rest of my chop with no problem!  Our sides were good too...I especially loved the Truffled Mac & Cheese, but then again - I love anything with truffles!!  The Scalloped Potatoes were good, but even though it's prepared differently - I seem to eat it a lot at my mom's house since her only grandson (AKA the ""Golden Child"") loves to eat it!

Unfortunately the flight was delayed (surprise, surprise) and I was going to cancel the reservation, if not for the fact that the husband got extremely upset and insisted that we find out the latest they can fit us in.  Turns out that they were able to move us to 10.45PM, so we took that spot and rolled the dice.

We landed at 10.15 and went straight to Stripsteak, carry ons and everything, just so he got his Stripsteak fix.

One bite into the duck fat fries (served with three different sauces, my favorite being garlic aioli) and the rib cap (the best, fattiest part of the ribeye steak) I understood why he was so noticeably upset at the prospect of not being able to make this dinner. 

The steak was the most amazing cut I've ever had - it was a relatively small piece (about 7 - 8 oz), but gosh, the meal was satisfying! It's not like digging into a hunk of meat, the fat was intertwined with the muscle so as to give the beef a soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture.  

Equally fantastic were the the foie gras sliders (more, please!!!!!!) and beef shabu shabu (similar to the one served at the SF's Michael Mina) as appetizers, and beignets with creme brûlée as dessert.

I had no idea that they also bring out fries with dipping sauces that are amazing as well (the truffle aioli is on point!).

I ordered the 18 oz ribeye. So good.. Cooked perfect with butter on top. The highlight of the meal may actually have been the potatoes au gratin though, believe it or not! They are covered in a rich, smokey Gouda cheese sauce. Unbelievable! It was a good sharing size as well.

Acclaimed Chef Michael Mina breaks new ground with the debut of STRIPSTEAK at Mandalay Bay, his first steakhouse. With its classic menu, inviting bar scene and sophisticated atmosphere, STRIPSTEAK plays host to guests looking for the perfect filet in a modern alternative to the traditional steakhouse setting. As with Mina's other restaurants, STRIPSTEAK uses only the highest quality ingredients - corn-fed, all-natural meat; line-caught seafood and fresh, seasonal produce. While first-rate components are essential, it is Mina's creative approach to cooking that has made his name.

STRIPSTEAK features a menu rife with imaginative interpretations of classic steakhouse favorites using state-of-the-art kitchen equipment. STRIPSTEAK offers three kinds of beef, Certified Angus Beef, American Kobe and 'A5' Japanese Kobe, and is home to two wood-burning grills and six circulating, slow-poaching chambers. The signature slow-poaching method enhances flavor and tenderness by heating the meat for several hours at a low temperature, while the mesquite-stoked grills infuse every cut with a subtle smokiness.
***

With that said, this place is devilishly good.  The modern decor coupled with a menu that will send your taste buds dancing earns this place the coveted 5th star.  While enjoying my meal, my friends, and the talent on display in walks....da da dum Andre Agassi.  Wow!

He was very lively, his presence filled the room.  He was engaging with the many guests requesting pics.  I was too befuddled to reach for my camera.  Don't ask me why something about being so close to a multiple Grand Slam Champion.  Turns out he is a part owner in this latest iteration of Michael Minna's restaurants.

The duck fat fries was like the free appetizer thing. It was awesome. Don't even need to dip it in ketchup/ranch or anything. We were hoping to get refills on those.

The waiter recommended Wagyu beef rib cap (apparently it's more marbleized  than the rib eye or something, I wasn't really paying attention to him hehe). Anyway, I got the steak medium, but it looked/tasted like medium-rare. I like the ""crust"" thing on the beef. Don't even need to add any sauce or anything else to it. Definitely worth the $70 I paid for it.

Love the truffled mac and cheese. Truffle oil just seems to make everything tastes better. I wish I could just have the truffled mac and cheese to myself but I had to share it with my friend :(

We split the bone-in rib eye, medium rare. It didn't need any sauce but we ordered the trio of sauces to try. It was tender and juicy and wonderful!

Quick hits:
1) Best old fashioned ever. If you've never had an old fashioned, this is where you become addicted. If you have had an old fashioned before, this will raise the benchmark. Order the ""specialty cocktail"" old fashioned ($16?) ...didn't know there was a difference but the waitress brought us some terrible looking ones during our second round.

2) Bar/waiting area waitstaff is friendly. Dining room waitstaff is friendly, but extremely slow and unattentive. Like, really slow and unattentive.

3) Wagyu Rib Caps: Delicious, tender, chewy, can't stop won't stop.

4) 18 oz bone in rib eye: ""them bones doe"". jk. this is a solid choice and can be shared if you're getting a ton of other food

5) Seafood platter: Broken up individually amongst 3 of us: lobster tail, king crab, claw, 3 or so oysters, 1 jumbo shrimp -- think it was around $34

6) Added foie gras to the steak: It's foie gras, what do you expect?

7) foie gras butter: too foie-y and not worth the upcharge

8) A5 wagyu - for $34 an ounce with a 3 ounce minimum , i was thoroughly underwhelmed. It was good, but not great. I'd stick with the other steaks listed above

9) Kale salad - $17. Quite literally something you could go to the grocery store and reproduce for less than 3 dollars. Nothing special

10) Diver scallops: Nicely seasoned and delicious

11) Complimentary fries with 3 dipping sauces: All. so. good. Beware: do not fill up on these

12) Alcohol/wine menu on an ipad. Cool, I guess...

13) Note: If you have a reservation, expect to wait for a little bit (our wait time was 30 minutes) until you get seated!",RYXMrb12VzDY1hhDj_hkHw,0,0,4,oITUEWsjk5ANQM-b-OeQ0w

I called and easily got in at our desired time. The restaurant was not busy at all even though their online booking system said they were full. If we didn't have the Restaurant.com coupon we would have probably given up on trying to get in.

3186544,2011-11-21,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"With so many options in Las Vegas, I have to say I was surprisingly underwhelmed with Stripsteak. This statement may seem incorrect, but allow me to explain. In Las Vegas there are so many amazing restaurants that they each need to compete to stay on top, or at the very least - relevant. I didn't feel that Stripsteak was even trying. 

The decor made me feel like I was in a cafeteria. The way the tables were placed and the type of chairs they had looked like a food court in a mall or cafeteria. It wasn't impressive at all. The menu didn't have anything on it that really stood out to me either. It was a standard Steak House menu- which isn't something to complain about, since I love steak, but the steak I had wasn't even that good. - A little background on me- it takes a lot for me to dislike any steak. I love steak. This steak in particular was just BORING. It wasn't cooked Medium Rare- it was more on the medium well side- which is fine too, but when you're paying $50 for a steak it should probably be cooked the way you requested. It also lacked flavor. It was just blah. I never in my life had such an expensive boring meal. 

The upside- the french fries. The different french fries that they bring to each table as opposed to bread are phenomenal- and also the reason for 2 stars as opposed to 1. 

I'm sorry to the Stripsteak fans, but for me Stripsteak is a massive let down.",_Fayj6NkO2vCv264Xavgeg,1,1,2,IrIhC8jznCCbLUUwG6Gofg

3233167,2009-02-15,3,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I hope to get through this review without drooling all over my laptop. 

So I chose this place for My boyfriend's 30th birthday dinner, and it's one of those happy occasions where I cannot imagine a better choice.  As soon as we sat down in the plush chairs in the middle of the gorgeous but unpretentious dining room, and picked up the Happy Birthday card the establishment had written out to my beau, it felt right.

Then we started sipping the best cocktails we've ever had.  Birthday boy tried the Claymore, an intriguing blend of Scotch, elderflower syrup, and Lambic beer. Sounded flat-out weird, but was out-of-this-world good. Just a little sweet and you could totally taste the smoothness of that good Scotch. 

Before we order, we are presented with a trio of french fries with their own dipping sauces! Herb with Ketchup, Duck Fat with Truffle sauce, and Paprika with Barbecue. I'm afraid I'm gonna bust out another superlative. I don't wanna get discredited that way, but hot damn, these were best fries I'd ever had. Specifically the duck fat and truffle sauce. What can I say about those fries? When you ate them, the world fell away. It was just you, the fried potato, and the truffle sauce.

Birthday boy picked an appetizer that the server recommended: Lobster and bacon fritters wrapped in bibb lettuce with a meyer lemon creme fraiche. Not my thing at all, but he was quite content with it. 

Meahwhile, I reveled in a fantastical salad of tri-colored beets with burrata. Do you know burrata? It's a fresh mozzarella that's made molten with cream.  It's hard to make, and its quite expensive. It's often flaunted on a menu as the star of a dish, but then miniscule in portion compared to the other ingredients. Not here, at Stripsteak! I enjoyed two healthy-sized, mouth-watering balls of exquisite burrata, which were complimented just perfectly with the lightly dressed roasted beets. At $15, this was a deal. 

Between the cocktail, beets, and fries, I probably didn't need to consume much more, but then our steaks came. We both ordered filet mignon ($54). There was nothing MIGNON about these steaks, they were enormous! I ordered mine ""Rare- really rare"" and I was happy to see that the while the outside was seared dark, it was red and cold beyond a few millimeters. It was perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect. 

Now, at Ruth Chris and the like, the $8 sides of sauteed vegetables or baked potatoes remind you of the expensive wrappings and bows you have to buy for a wedding gift. A necessary accompaniment to the main event that makes it pretty and complete, but would be utterly useless and ridiculous if purchased on their own. 

The sides here at Stripsteak are NOT wrapping paper. You could bring a vegetarian to Stripsteak and they would be just as happy with these sides as the carnivores with their meat. 

Truffled Macaroni and cheese. **Maniacal laugh heard here at the mention of this dish.** According to our server, the best thing on the menu. No arguments here!

We also had Scalloped potatoes with goat cheese. Giving the mac a run for its money.

If that wasn't enough gluttony to invoke wrath from the Gods, we also had an accompaniment of grilled foie gras. Each bite bursted with sinful flavor as it instantly melted on our tongues. 
 
I cannot express to you how blessed we were to be eating these side dishes. It was pure, unfettered bliss. This is comfort-food that grew up to be a gorgeous, confident Gourmet. It's the best of both worlds. 

We played happily with combining these flavors. This bite is filet with truffled mac. This bite is filet with goat cheese. This bite is filet with a bit of the roasted shallot, the most delicious garnish in town. 

And then there was the moment that I realized ""Hey! What about the trufffle dipping sauce from the fries? I bet that will taste good with the steak!""

I never thought I was going to be able to eat that enormous steak, but despite being at capacity, I ate and ate and ate until everything was gone. 

The birthday boy chose beignets with chocolate mouse dipping sauce, not my thing, and then I happily paid the $300 bill. 

It was worth it.",_xFrjg55612CA61OQ4PrdQ,4,5,5,eaAYHQ0B149jDbs4dKYqBw

We made reservations for a Friday through the concierge at the Mandalay Bay (the StripSteak website said they were booked) but we were able to get an 8:30pm table for two the day of. The restaurant is located on ""restaurant row"" of the Mandalay in-between the casino and convention center. We arrived right on time for our reservation were seated right by the window. I recommend doing the same because it's perfect for people watching since everyone LOVES to stop and fondle the giant marble breasts across the way. (Ridiculously funny.)

To start things off, I ordered a Patron Margarita and Russ ordered a man-tini. We went to work pouring over the menu. We quickly discovered it was perfect for anyone who loves modern american comfort food.  As soon as we sat down our (extremely nice and helpful) waiter brought us out a complimentary order of Duck Fat fries - which we were happy to munch on while we made our decision.

Spend your money wisely and invest in the $60 Kobe Rib Cab which was the best cut of steak I've had in a VERY long time.  It's 8ozs of deliciousness. I got mine medium and am happy to report it was juicy, full-flavored, and melt-in-your-mouth good. Russ's Porterhouse was also extremely tasty, but if you're willing to pay more for the quality - go for the Kobe beef selection. It was unreal and worth every $5 bite.

For dessert, we ordered the Milk Chocolate mousse which was the perfect way to end our meal. It was sweet and smooth, but not too heavy  -- we left feeling happy and full.  I asked the bartender to prepare me a special desert cocktail that would go with our desert and he made a delicious chocolate raspberry martini that I rocked till the last drop.

To those of you reading this on your Yelp app deciding what to do for dinner tonight or later this week on the Strip, look no further.

Maple glazed squash is delicious. Oh, and they stock my favorite beer, Hitachino Nest White Ale.  But you'll probably get off on the wine list instead.

Service was great. And our dinner was served promptly after ordering.   I had originally communicated with the manager prior to coming down from our room, that we had an early show to catch so we couldn't afford to have our dinner served late.  So I sincerely appreciate that they were very accommodating and reassuring. 

Albeit I liked the casual atmosphere, I still thought it was a tad bit loud for a nice sit down restaurant. 

We started with three orders of duck  fat fries. Omg. And of yeah, it was on the house :)

I believe three of the girls ordered Ribeyes for their main.  Ofcourse I had to take a big bite, definitely juicy and cooked medium well as I liked.  One ordered it medium rare and she was quite pleased.

Two ordered their lamb.  Cooked medium well,  moist and seasoned well. 

Two of them ordered salmon and personally I thought it was a tad bit dry to my liking otherwise seasoned ok.

My scallops were seared perfectly and thus making the inside juicy and oh so yummy!

One of my weight conscious gf went with a Fuji  salad.  Definitely refreshing and made her a happy camper.

The side dishes we all shared-
Creamed spinach- I was very disappointed how it was way too salty.  How can anyone mess this up :( And I am a creamed spinach gal! 

Mushrooms- bleh. I don't like them personally but the group loved them.

Sautéed broccoli- ok.

To sum it up... Solid 4 stars. I suppose my expectations were really high for a 4 star $$$$ at over 700+ reviews restaurant. So I expect everything to be perfect even from as simple as their side dish, my creamed spinach.  

But great thing about rolling with high rollers is this entire dinner was covered on behalf of Mandalay Bay as credit due to one of my gfs.

Before our meal, they brought out a sample of their duck fat fries. They were good, and we were presented with three varieties paired with a sauce. I'm not sure I would order them again, only because the rest of the food was amazing!

Our steaks were cooked to perfection! Cut with a fork they were so tender! While the two sides were way too much for two of us, they were a great accompaniment. We savored every bite!

We also ordered a $90 bottle of wine. That is way more than we usually pay for wine (in fact, this whole meal was more than our biweekly food budget!), but it was awesome. Unfortunately we both drank too much of it to remember the name! Bottom line- just let them pick the wine. They won't disappoint!

While it was not needed, we indulged in the marscapone cheesecake. WOW. A perfectly light end to a great meal!

I can't say it was the most amazing steak I have had but it was good. The duck fat fries were good and the duck fat did impart a good flavor to the fries that was interesting. I also had the soy glazed shitake mushrooms. They were a bit too sweet for my liking and i thought that there should have been a bit less sugar and more acid with them. The decor is very open and nothing to write home about. Overall it is a good meal solid meal but not something to write home frantically (or on yelp) about. If there is a next time I'll order more of the sides to see how creative Mina was with his menu but for now it was good but nothing tugs at me to return.,gkxHpjPMkpAR1kb8rqEa3Q,1,0,4,vpL1Pg550MV06x0dMIgEwA

Being one of the birthday peeps, I was a little hesitant to celebrate the big 3-2 at a restaurant on the Strip.  However, my buddies assured perfection, and boy were they right!  First, let me start by saying that restaurants on the Strip are notorious for terrible service.  However, the service at Stripstreak was some of the best I've ever received.

Do yourself a favor and order the steak tartare for an appetizer.  Trust me.  For the main, most of the table ordered a filet instead of the larger steaks because we were heading to XS later, and let's face it - dancing while in a food coma is no fun.  The filet's came out perfect, and each had a nice char on the exterior while maintaining that familiar medium-rare reddish/pink interior.  The sides were equally impressive:  truffle mac and cheese, potatoes 3 way, duck fat fries, and creamed spinach.  So, if you're looking for a steakhouse in Vegas, Stripsteak will impress.

We were seated right on time for our reservation at a private table towards the back. They give each table a trio of duck fat fries with three different dipping sauces on the house. It was a nice touch since we didn't order an appetizer. 

We ordered:

30oz Porterhouse: It was a good size and since I'm not much of a meat person, my husband had to take care of the majority of it. The meat was perfectly cooked albeit a bit under-seasoned. 

Potato puree trio: Such a cute presentation and a perfect side for spud lovers. The potatoes were pureed to creamy perfection but the flavors weren't very potent. The lobster mash wasn't as decadent  as Mastros, and the sour cream and onion tasted like plain mashed potatoes. The horseradish had a nice kick to it and was my favorite of the bunch.

Brussel sprouts: We read it had bacon lardon mixed in and we were sold. The smoky flavor of the bacon complemented the shredded brussel sprouts nicely. 

We also ordered a bottle of Cabernet and it was our first time seeing the sommelier pour a little bit out  to taste for himself before presenting it to us. 

The server was attentive but not intrusive. Good ambiance, not crowded, quiet, dim lighting, typical fancy steakhouse vibe. Although we did enjoy our experience here, with so many great steakhouses in Vegas, it's hard to say when would come back.",C07dCRn1oTNlnA9zQ0GXzQ,2,1,4,MSnF4sMDq0sI2z2zf9lzdA

The service here is outstanding---everyone is friendly, helpful, and on the ball. They even gave my friend (the birthday boy) a Birthday note. Additionally, the manager sent me a follow up email the next day to thank my party for the visit! 

On to the meal: we were given two free appetizers---french fries cooked in duck fat, with various dipping sauces, and warm bread with rosemary. Both delicious! I ordered off the pre-fix menu (appetizer, entree and desert for $55) and had the crab soup, rib-eye steak, and creme broule---all delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. The Bday boy had the Kobe burger and also said it was fantastic. My boyfriend had the filet mignon, which he said was great. One of the best parts of the meal was the mac n' cheese the Bday boy ordered as a side dish. I highly recommend ordering this treat---it will be hard to return to that old staple, Kraft, after you have eaten this!! 

Overall: GREAT STEAK, friendly service, beautiful atmosphere!

Tip: I had a restaurant.com $50 gift certificate that we used towards our meal. Restaurant.com often has sales, and gift certs are generally 60-80% off. Thus, I got my $50 gift cert. for $4!

as you walk into the restaurant, you'll see meat in the windows by the grill aging to perfection.  and as expected, everything from the food to the service to the ambiance was amazing.  as soon as we got to our tables, a happy birthday card awaited us which was very thoughtful and cute.  our server was extremely helpful especially with choosing a wine to celebrate wifey's birthday.  he generously brought out a couple of samples of wine and was very knowledgeable of each type.  i love how they bus your plates immediately and how our drinks never touched the bottom of our glasses.  FANTASTIC service.

the trio of fries were delish...but we tried so hard not to eat all of it for fear of not being able to finish our main course.  the truffle mayo was exquisite...and it was dang hard not to soak up every single fry in it.  the fresh out of the oven rosemary focaccia bread was WOW.  i didn't even get a chance to take a picture of it cause we just dove right in.  it was buttery, warm, and so good that after a couple of pieces, i found myself not trying to look at it or else i'd devour the rest of it.  

both of us ordered off the prix fixe menu which was well worth the pricetag of $55 each.  don't forget your restaurant.com gift certificate which takes 50 bucks off your bill!  we took advantage of the discount and decided to order an appetizer...so we got meat at its purest level...the kobe filet tartare.  man oh man...if i could, i'd skip everything else on the menu and just order 3 of those for myself.  the server came to our tableside with a plate of the diced kobe, a quail egg, and seasonings.  he mixed the tartare right in front of us explaining every single ingredient and placed the mixture into a bowl with ice.  it was served with some pita bread.  the tartare itself was enough to give this place 5 stars...the quality of the kobe was amazing!  a must try when you come here...

now the first course...wifey had the crab chowder while i chose the bibb salad.  the server said that every bowl of crab chowder is made to order.  the chunks of crab in the bowl were generous...and the broth itself was super tasty.  but my salad...mMmmm...i absolutely love blue cheese...and my salad had 2 different types.  wifey gave me the stink face though but was still willing to try it.  yummy!!!

we both decided to order the slow poached prime rib...who wants to order chicken from a steak house?  the server warned us that ordering medium guarantees you medium rare...which was perfect for us.  so medium it is!!!  the prime rib was super tasty and tender.  no juices splattered over the plate which means that the chef knew what the heck he was doing.  it was served with a side of delish au jus and creamy horseradish.  our entree also came with 3 sides...peas and carrots, truffled mac n cheese, and bacon creamed spinach.  i left the peas and carrots alone since they weren't anything special...and devoured the rest of the side dishes.  the truffled mac n cheese was OMG good.  don't truffles just make everything that much better?  yum.  

and then dessert...root beer float with sassafras ice cream and root beer sorbet...served with chocolate chip cookies baked to order...oh, and a chocolate straw.  the server was nice enough to even put a candle on wifey's plate and happy birthday written with chocolate.  before we tried our dessert, we had to ask ourselves...how good can a root ber float possibly be?  haha.  this root beer float was of course, the best root beer float i have ever had.  amazingness.

loved this place...can't wait to try michael mina's other restaurants...i've heard great things about his lobster pot pie.  yummy!",Dj77pkw_EZJvR-F4RIf_BQ,0,0,5,GezVAcU0JBYympp0v4xpuw

The restaurant started the night with some complimentary duck-fat fries that were unique and extremely good! The menu was extensive in its selection of steak. There were a great variety of types of meat from T-bone to Kobe cap. We ordered the lobster salad w/ grapefruit vinaigrette. It had a slight tanginess to the sweet fresh lobster. I ordered the diver scallops w/ cajun spice--which actually didn't wow me at all. It basically was grilled scallops w/ lemon for $40.  My boyfriend ordred 18 oz. bone-in rib eye which was a hearty portion! I actually liked his steak a lot more than my own scallops. We also ordered the Mac & Cheese in truffle oil and mushrooms. Both of which were amazingly good and I would recommend that you order it w/ your meat! The truffle oil gave the Mac & Cheese a distinct taste that separated it from your typical American/Cheddar mac & cheese. 

Honestly, I felt like the food was good here, but it's definitely too expensive for the portion that they give you. I have been to other steak houses that offered the same type of food for a little bit cheaper.

I had been here before when my palate wasn't as refined as it is now and I wasn't too thrilled with it.  I think it was because we had intended to go to Shanghai Lilly but it was closed and we ended up here.  I liked it much better the second time around.

Who can resist their complementary duck fat fries?  The perfect way to start out our culinary experience.  The starter came with 3 different sauces that complemented the 3 different types of fries they gave us.  Our table ate them up!  They were so good.  I would go just for that!

The chicken breast was the perfect portion of white meat and pieces of crisp dark meat.  It came with truffle mac and cheese that was more delectable than it should have been.  A nice balance of cheese and truffle oil, but not too much truffle oil that it was over powering.

Their special was a pork chop with jalapeno creamed corn which was my FAVORITE part of my dinner.  It wasn't too spicy like I had anticipated.  The first bite is a kick but once you get to the sweetness of the corn, it extinguishes the fire of the jalapeno and becomes this perfect balance of sweet and spicy.

The potato puree trio was pretty darn good.  It came with 3 different potato purees: lobster, onion and sour cream, and horseradish.  They were a great compliment to our chicken.  it was like a creamy potato soup.  I really enjoyed the sour cream and onion.

I give them an extra star for our wonderful waitress Lisa.  She was efficient, friendly and gave us a special treat at the end of our dinner.  I really liked her.

The bf & I got the following: prime rib, rib eye, truffled mac & cheese, spinach, foie gras sliders, and root beer floats for dessert.

The foie gras sliders were pretty good. Our waitress suggestd that we take off the top piece of bread so we could taste the foie gras more. Good call on the bread! I think if I had eaten it with the bread on top, the taste would have overwhelmed the foie gras. It had a slightly sweet sauce taste but it was delicious! It only comes in two small pieces though. 

I'm a HUGE fan of prime rib so I ordered this without even thinking. However, they cook prime rib really different here. I wish my waitress warned me because I wasn't a fan. She later told me that people either loved it or hated it. Thanks, you could have warned me :( There's a certain taste that you expect when you eat prime rib but this place didn't have it. But like she said, other people would love it.

The rib eye was pretty tasty, cooked well. The sides of truffle mac & cheese was delicious but extremely rich. The spinach was okay. 

The root beer float dessert was a nice finish to the meal. Tastes exactly like what you would make for yourself as a kid but that feeling of nostalgia and the fact that it's not a heavy dessert was a nice touch. 

I probably wouldn't come back since there's so many other places to try but the meat definitely looks promising. Except the prime rib haha",4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww,1,1,3,Zj8DrL2WurRGnyuwZzzWCQ

The steaks were done to perfection and could rival Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille easily. The sample of cornbread that came on all the plates was scrumptious.

After placing our order, they served us a trio of crispy fries - Old Bay Fries with Truffle Aioli, Garlic Fries with Ketchup, And Truffle Fries with Mustard. 

Our party of five shared two salads, steak entree, and three sides. Everything was delicious except the Spicy Fried Rice.

The Baby Greens Salad consisted of fresh baby greens, pepita seeds, and medley of thinly sliced fall vegetables such as carrots, radish, and candy candy beets lightly tossed in a white balsamic vinaigrette. 

The Caesar Salad consisted of fresh romaine hearts, parmesan, and crunchy garlic pita croutons lightly tossed in a Caesar dressing and garnished with white anchovies.

Before the Tomahawk arrived, we were given a mini corn muffin with a spiced honey dipping sauce.

The 40oz Australian Tomahawk was served medium rare on the bone. There was about 32oz of tender Wagyu meat. It was seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic.

The Brussels Sprouts consisted of brussels sprouts and mulled apples. It was sweet like honey but I loved it and highly recommend it. The Potato Gratin consisted of sliced potato topped with melted smoked gouda. It was filling. The Spicy Fried Rice resembled a spicy tomato-y paella with pork belly.

I also absolutely loved the lobster mashed potatoes. Our waitress was awesome as well and very patient as we took a good 20-30 minutes to figure out what we wanted to order between wine and food. The complimentary fries with dipping sauce may be the cherry on top of this dining experience. Only negative I can say is it was a bit loud and difficult to talk to those in your party especially a small party. Don't expect to get out of here for less than $300 with 2 people.

We ordered the prime rib eye with a Caesar to complement. The ribeye was really good. Grill to exact request it was smooth and full of flavor. The Ceasar wasn't that great. When we ordered ours without anchovies it came with it anyway. What threw me a bit was the total lack of craft beer selection. Several pages of fantastic wines but no draft craft beer selection. Only bottles and sub par beer selection at that. Basically not the type of beer you want to complement a five star steak with. A little shocked actually.

3648498,2011-01-19,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Steak here is quite bomb-good! It's a Michael Mina restaurant, so his signature style is interpreting an ingredient in 3 different preparations and flavors. So I was excited when this came out first while we decide on drinks.

TRIO OF DUCK FAT FRIES (comp amuse) - 5 stars
1. Smoked paprika and mustard fries w/a smoked paprika and mustard crème fraîche dip 
2. Truffle fries with a truffle aïoli dip
3. Rosemary and onion fries with an onion ketchup dip

I love french fries and these were cooked right. Fresh potatoes were cut and fried to perfection. The exterior was crispy and the inside was soft with a richer taste coz of the duck fat.

Our table didn't get the 2nd complimentary dish, the olive oil focaccia. I should have asked, but I wanted to save room for steak.

STRIP-PEAR ($13) - 4 stars
I chose the Strip-Pear martini. It's made with Grey Goose La Poire (Anjou pear flavored vodka), lychee puree (instead of the usual pear puree) and fresh lime juice. Pear was the main flavor with a hint of lychee. It was sweet and medium strong... nice.

Other drinks we got were: Guinness ($8), Stella Artois ($8), New Castle ($7) and Lustau Solera ($13).

18oz DRY-AGED BONE-IN RIB EYE ($51) - 4 stars
10oz FILET MIGNON ($54) - 4.5 stars
All of our steaks came out medium/high warm. Note, after grilling steaks need to rest for the juices redistribute. Both steaks were super tasty and tender with a smokey and peppery finish. All 4 (1 rib eye and 3 filets) steaks were cooked perfectly as requested. 

The plate presentation is simple: steak, a whole roasted shallot and yellow pepper and garnished with a small sprig of thyme. No fluffy presentation for the main dish. There's room on the plate to place your sides.  It's a steakhouse after all.

I asked out server how the steaks are cooked and she said, ""They're poached then grilled and basted with a wine butter."" I did some research to get the details of how they cook their steaks.

Step 1: Steaks are placed in slow-poaching chambers, which enhances flavor and tenderness. The meat heats for several hours at a low temperature. 

Step 2: Steaks are then grilled on a cast iron grill above mesquite wood. The wood gives every cut of steak a nice subtle smokiness.

POTATO PUREE TRIO ($14)  - 4 stars
Another trio dish we ordered. The 3 flavors were: horseradish, lobster and sour cream. The puree was seasoned nicely. All of the purees were smooth, rich and creamy. 

BACON-CREAMED SPINACH ($10) - 4 stars
The crowd fav was the creamed spinach. It was made with spinach, heavy cream, shallot, garlic, butter, nutmeg, S&P and topped with bacon crumbs.

PASSION FRUIT PANNA COTTA ($12) - 4 stars
Passion fruit pieces, red grape fruit, thin slices of avocado, and coconut sorbet sit atop the panna cotta. The panna cotta itselft was refreshing, light and subtle sweet. The avocado gave the dessert extra creaminess and weight. While the grapefruit and coconut sorbet gave it a tart and sweet pairing.

MILK CHOCOLATE CUSTARD ($12) - 3.5 stars
Small red velvet cake pieces, powder sugar, toasted pecans, cocoa nib ice cream lay on top of the chocolate custard. This dessert was smooth and rich like a very thick pudding. The topping provided a nice contrast.

I was so full by the end of dinner. Anyhow, the steak dinner was a nice way to close out our weekend of Vegas fun. Cost for a party of 4 with tax was $335 (alcohol $49, steaks $213, sides $24 and dessert $24). 

Reduce costs by 1) get alkie during happy hour 4-7pm at the bar, 2) non-big eaters share a steak or 3) order the prix fixe menu 3-courses for $55. Prix fixe only offers chicken or prime rib. 

Overall, my experience was good. It's better than all of the chain steakhouses: Fleming's, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, BLT Steak, etc. Next steakhouses, I'd like to try is Mastro's and CUT.",lucIbk6WeQ6Nq0Zr5jrSBA,8,4,4,ZBhJrPII6YujaNooVIdlng

The Decor was very modern, I especially liked the large cup style chairs we sat in, very comfortable.

They had an extensive winelist but I just felt like drinking beer so I had a few Newcastles.  

They start your experience by bringing out their duck fat fries with their special dipping sauces.  The duck fat fries alone are enough reason to come here.

I ordered off the prix fixe menu, and got the maryland crab chowder with a 16 oz rib eye with truffle mac n cheese and bacon creamed spinach.

the soup was good, very fresh seafood,
the Rib eye was amazing and I was so happy to not pay $50+ for a non-petite portion. the truffle mac n cheese was really good, I just wish it had a larger portion, and so was the spinach.

the big hit was the mashed potato trio that my friend ordered, Horseradish mash, garlic mash and lobster mash, the big hit was definitely the lobster mash, the bowl was being scraped.

for dessert we had beignets that were deliciously flaky and served with various dips,  I had creme brulee, but I believe there were some chocolate variations as well.

There was a small mistake on my appetizer, but the one that they brought me by accident was awesome and much better then what I had actually ordered so that was great.  And they took off my first glass of wine which just shows how awesome the service is.

The skirt steak I ordered was wonderful and I was almost tearful when it was gone; the side of scalloped potatoes were equally amazing.  It almost tasted like there was a hint of truffle oil.

It's near all the other fancy restaurants in Mandalay Bay.  The entrance is very open, glass windows that extend to the roof and you can see the whole restaurant just standing out side.  

Large cow carcasses hang from hooks in the fridge behind the glass by the kitchen.  I'm guessing these are the delicious ones that they'll be hacking off for my order.

The host is formal; he pulls out my chair, hands me a menu, and places a napkin in my lap for me.  Thanks guy.  I order the filet mignon (a la carte, as most of the menu items come), the beau orders the Fried chicken w/mac & cheese.  Meanwhile, compliments of the chef are 3 types of fries and corresponding sauces - Truffle, BBQ, and ketchup, as well as a small pan of potato foccacia.  The truffle fries won me over.  I could have eaten plenty more of those.

My fiance and our friend ordered the Filet Mignon and both really liked it along with the fingerling potatoes they shared.

The Bad:
I ordered the Ribeye and was not impressed in the least bit. I have had numerous Prime Ribeyes and this was more like Choice . It was also fairly bland, my fiance tasted it also and thought the same. When you spend $65 on ala carte steak you should not have to saw through or spit out gristle. I have had better Ribeyes at Outback......

Chilled seafood is also a good starter.  The portion could have been bigger but the selection was quite good..  It had lobster tail, lobster claw, a few king crab legs, a couple oysters and a couple clams.  I could have eaten the whole thing myself, but I had to share =)

I have eaten at many fine steak houses all over the country (Peter Lugers, Mastros, Burns, etc.) and I can say without reservation that everything was great at this restaurant (side dishes, appetizers, wine) except the STEAK.  I had the $52 bone-in ribeye and it was an outback steakhouse equivalent at best (and I may be offending Outback).  It took a long time to receive and was barely warm when it got to the table.  We had to send two steaks back to be reheated.  It was 30% fat, thin, and just not good.  I rarely leave negative feedback but just had to relate our terrible, terrible experience.

We both shared the Foie Gras Sliders as an appetizer.   Now think about that for a second... What psychotic and degenerate soul would think of making sliders with Foie Gras?   Well, apparently Michael Mina would, and they totally rock!   

We then proceeded to share a Kobe beef Rib Eye and some scallops.   For sides, we got the Mac & Cheese, the spinach souffle, and the trio of mashed potatoes.

Let's just say that I was fondling the Mac & Cheese, drooling, while looking at my wife in very suggestive ways.   She got embarassed and I just got off...  No, really.  The Mac & Cheese totally rocks.   The richness of the cheese is cut with the acidity of the truffle oil, and the result is a masterpiece.  Bravo!

The kobe steak was pretty good, though not great.   The scallops, though, were absolutely tender and beautifully prepared.    The mashed potatoes, too, were beautifully prepared.    The spinach souffle, while nicely presented, didn't leave a lasting memory.   Still, it tasted good enough that it deserves a honorable mention.

The sommelier was also absolutely stunning.   We ordered a bottle of Paraduxx Zinfandel.   They were out, and the sommelier recommended a bottle by B Cellars instead, slightly cheaper.   Well, it was a stellar wine, and it was nice that we didn't feel like he tried to upsell us.   Absolutely stunning.

We started off with the lobster fritters. Yummy..and I don't enjoy any type of seafood , but these were tasty. I split them with my husband and because there were only 3.. We fought over the remaining one...
Next the waitress brought out these too die for French fries . 3 kinds with 3 different dipping sauces .. I devoured these (it was 9pm and I was STARVING). My husband asked if we may have more and the waitress responded yes but we will have to charge you $8... Are you kidding me... $8 when I'm already spending $250 on a dinner for 2.. Whatever!! She brought out another batch and we ate them.
I ordered the rib eye Medium Rare and the hubby had the flat iron.. Both of us thought the meat was tough and lacked flavor.. For $60 a steak shouldn't it have been cut with a butter knife and melt in your mouth?
We split the potato purée and all 3 were delicious. The server was nice and attended to us well. We left full and skipped dessert.

Well it was a nice place, but nothing too superb to be honest.  But its your Bday, so you just enjoy the flow of drinks and after enough everything taste good, Right?  We did get complimentary duck fat fries, which we will say was good and different.  That was the special appetizer the chefs prepared that night.  Our waiter came by and recommended some great drinks I will give him that.  We started with some martinis, and then I was having drinks on the rocks!!!!  

As the drinks were flowing steadily, we then ordered our food.  We had the bone in ribeye, which you cant go wrong, and also the kobe beef ribeye, yes ""kobe ribeye"" supposedly is very buttery and just melts.  Needless to say, they tasted the same it seems, but the sides is what we enjoyed.  We ordered the truffle mac n cheese, roasted mushrooms, and brussel sprouts with bacon.  I think anything with bacon is already a positive.  Its a Bday dinner so no reason to just enjoy and not try things right.  I would say this is a good place for a evening dinner with friends maybe better to be at the bar and grab more drinks and apps, than so much dinner per se.

This was easily the best steakhouse we have ever eaten at! This place gives you a truly American vibe as soon as you walk through the door. From the dimmed lighting to the wooden table/chairs to the paper place mat, this was definitely American. Don't get me wrong though, this place is still very fancy. Not to mention all the freebies they give out! First freebie was the Duck Fat Fries which were... indescribably delicious. Don't take all the other review for granted, they are all completely accurate!  Second freebie, was the pizza bread. I wasn't really a fan of this, it was just way too dense and dry for my liking, and not to mention filling. I wanted to save my stomach for the STEAK. The third freebie we got was from our waiter Steve, at the end of the meal he gave us two packs of caramel/chocolate covered popcorn to enjoy during our Mystere show we were going to after dinner, very nice gesture, and we of course tipped him accordingly. =)

With all the freebies we got we decided to go ahead and skip the appetizers and go straight for wine. I ordered a Red Syrah Wine from Sonoma (I think) and she ordered a Pinot Noir (location unknown), I thought both were good, but we ended up switching because she felt that the Pinot was tasteless and I thought it was light and amazing.

Meat:
We were actually intending to get the Japanese Wagyu but according to Steve they won't be carrying it for another few months due to a MAD COW breakout in Japan. BOO MAD COW! Regardless, the American Wagyu did not disappoint. I suckered her into getting the American Kobe Rib Eye and I got the Rib Cap. FYI: the Rib Cap is 10 TIMES better than the Rib Eye. The steaks were perfectly cooked to our specifications, Medium Rare. Both pieces of meat were delicious but the marbling of the fat in between the crevices of meat in the Rib Cap made it that much more easier to melt in your mouth than the Rib Eye. But please don't take it the wrong way, the Rib eye was still one of the best Rib Eyes I have ever had. 

Sides:
We ended up getting two sides and sharing, which was more than enough. We got the truffled mac and cheese and the jalapeno creamed corn. We already made our decision that we were getting the truffled mac because of all the reviews. One word described this dish... BOLD. The flavor was bold and I liked it but I could only have so much. The jalapeno creamed corn on the other hand I could have probably ate the whole bowl. It was a perfect combination of creaminess with a hint of spice to give it a kick. It was very very very good.

Dessert:
We got the Beignets with creme brulee. The beignets came out warm with dusted powder sugar on top. And the creme brulee was well... creme brulee, nothing too special. It was a delicious end to our meal nonetheless.

This is a definite must eat at spot in Vegas. We were torn between Cut and StripSteak and I think we made the right decision. Next time we are getting the Japanese Wagyu!!",pUmTc6CSKsQMbHgk4ZWvIQ,1,1,5,-hn5bQV08aK6X_W02E7EGg

There were 11 of us in the group.  Before dinner, we gathered at the bar to have a pre-dinner drink.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  He took several pictures of the group at our request and was patient as we gave him 5 different cameras to take pictures with.  The whole time he cracked jokes and told us he would take as many pictures as we wanted....+1 in my book for the service.

Originally, we had a reservation for 15 people but 4 didn't make it, so the hostess had to rearrange the table.  The hostess came to get us 10 minutes after our original reservation time....not bad for a last minute change like that.

We were seated and our server immediately asked me if we wanted the wine list and who were the wine drinkers in the group.  I gave her the headcount and instructed her to keep our wine glasses full until I said stop.  She obliged and went to get the wine.  I ordered a Malbec from Argentina, it was nice and earthy with hints of blackberry & pepper....perfect! +1 for the wine.

The server made several recommendations for the group and we placed our order.  As a complimentary appetizer, they brought out a tray of 3 different flavors of French Fries.  From what I could tell the flavors were BBQ, Plain, and Garlic & Herbs....served with 3 dipping sauces....BBQ, Horseradish, Ketchup.  They were good, the Garlic & Herbs was the best of the 3.

When the food came out, it was presented beautifully on the plates and cooked exactly how we all ordered it.....that's rare for a group this large.  Normally there is one or two that has to send it back because it wasn't cooked right, but not tonight!  I had the 10 oz Filet and ordered it Medium Well.....it was tender and the knife sliced through it like butter.  It had a nice juicy flavor with a smokey & peppery finish.....a great pairing for the Malbec...nom nom nom!  +1 on the Steaks.  I took a few pics of the Steaks for foodie viewing pleasure.

For a side dish, I ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese....again, great pairing for the entree....I highly recommend it.  The Asparagus was good too.

Nobody had any room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  Overall, the dinner was a big hit with everyone.

My friend and I shared a Porterhouse with some King Crab... It was nearly a religious experience. The steak was so tender, I could've sworn it simply fell apart in my mouth. I've never had such an amazing steak. Don't get me wrong, it hasn't ruined me for other places, like Ruth's Chris or Boa, but it certainly set a very high standard. It needed absolutely no further seasoning and was cooked perfectly. The King Crab, well, it was good, but then again King Crab is fairly consistent from place to place.

3835155,2014-09-16,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Tried multiple dishes at Strip Steak. But what can you expect as a pescetarian going into a steak house? I didn't eat the fries because they were fried in duck fat, but you could smell the truffle oil from the truffle fries. 

Didn't eat the duck bolognese or the ""instant bacon,"" but I could admire them from a culinary standpoint. Presentation of everything was wonderful. 

The things I could eat though...

The beet salad with goat cheese was light and delicious. It needed a little bit more acid, but was still very well seasoned. 

The truffle mac and cheese was absolutely scrumptious. As a side, it could easily feed two people because of how rich it is. 

The trio of potatoe puree is a little odd, but still very flavorful. When given a fork to eat with, it's a little odd trying to get what are basically thin mashed potatoes into your mouth. 

Glazed mushrooms with shishito peppers and mirin reduction provided a nice Asian flavor and balance to all the richness of everything else. The peppers are smoky and sweet. 

I had the halibut entree which was tender and moist. It was cooked well, but underseasoned. It came with a coconut-red curry and sunchoke puree that didn't do much for the halibut. It needed salt. The curry overpowers the sunchoke so that you don't really taste much except a light hint of coconut milk.  

The aforementioned sides and dessert of bourbon infused custard saved the meal. This dessert looked odd, like a crème prior to being brûlée-d. On top of it was a bourbon gelatin which, although delicious, were jell-o blocks of brown blobs. Then there was spun sugar and a whipped cream that I didn't care for, but the custard tasted so delicious, I finished the whole thing. 

Overall: nice atmosphere, good food, good service, my boyfriend says it was the best steak of his life, and I had a good time. There was a little wait in between the salad and the main courses, but nothing a good scotch can't take up.

The sides I recommend are Mushrooms, Mash Potatoes Trio with Lobster potato being my favorite, and asparagus. Do not order the corn, not very flavorful.

Completely agree with all of the other reviewers re the service and worth the splurge.

We got sat down by the hostess, and we were just admiring the surrounding. The waitress were super nice, no complain there! And plus wouldn't really expecting it being bad service at all. 

When we ordered our food that is when I was disappointed. I ordered the Kobe steak (the one that was the most expensive on the menu) and the Bf ordered the ribeye steak, we had ordered the fried cauliflower, scallop potatoes, and the Mac and cheese. Cauliflower tasted horrible, it was suppose to be fried but it was mushy. The other two sides were good. The steaks were just okay. 

The amount of money we paid for this dinner was not worth of coming back to. I was expecting something amazing with paying over $300 for two people...",ObrFkAwrOPfSJJ-2Ye2EgQ,0,0,3,dhXQFxTh98pFgOOFCTgFww

3881245,2014-04-23,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Stripsteak was great, and we'll definitely go back next time we're in Vegas. We had a reservation, but decided to sit at the bar instead of a table. The bartender, Anthony, was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. 

The atmosphere is somewhat casual for such an expensive restaurant (there are TVs in the bar area), but it was contemporary and comfortable. 

Instead of serving bread, they serve a sampler of three different types of fries (cooked in duck fat) with three different sauces. I can't remember what they all were, but I liked them all. We thought it was both odd and interesting to have fries instead of bread, but we enjoyed them. 

The only disappointment of the evening was the wedge salad. We asked to have it chopped and split--and when it arrived it looked like two $2.50 side salads from Denny's. Seriously, an upscale restaurant like this should have a fancy wedge, with high-priced blue cheese crumbles, ample house-made dressing, and loads of freshly cooked bacon. Instead we received a small bit of iceberg lettuce with hardly any dressing or cheese crumbles and what my husband called ""bacon dust."" You couldn't taste the bacon at all. (They should check out the wedge at Mastro's to see what an upscale wedge is like.) I think this wedge was around $16--maybe more.  Crazy!

Anyway, things got much better when our entrées arrived. I ordered the yellow tail sashimi appetizer, and it was some of the most delicious sashimi I've ever had. It was super fresh and tender--practically melted in my mouth--and it was prepared just perfectly, with just a touch of sauce and jalapeño; it had a perfect balance of flavors.  

My husband ordered the filet, and it was cooked perfectly--very tender and flavorful. 

We also shared the potatoes gratin. It was like a large brick of thinly sliced, tender potatoes in a cheesy cream sauce (no unwanted ingredients, such as onions). They were delicious. 

Finally, we had to have dessert. I thought the beignets with three different sauces sounded delicious, but Anthony recommended the apple crumble (served with vanilla bean ice cream), so we ordered that instead. Anthony was right--it was great. He also brought out one freshly cooked beignet for us to try (so nice of him!), and it was delicious too. 

We left Stripsteak fat and happy. Highly recommend! (Just don't order the wedge salad.)",Y_kCZ1A0Xo-QrVZgBq_75A,1,0,4,xvHQltf7XF1yZ8iA1Bbhiw
3884523,2017-03-12,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Overall not worth the money. Food is a 3.5, service is a 3.5 and atmosphere is a 3.  The night started with reservations at 8:30.  Did not seat us until almost 9:00. Brought our own wine, Corkage was a bit expensive at $50 but still fine because our wine was personal and from a special winery we visited. What's not okay is the sommelier having an attitude about his job in pouring our wine. This is supposed to be a high end restaurant. At least go through the same motions as if it were your wine. Our server was pleasant. But she let me down. Best part of the whole meal and night is their play on bread, instead they bring fries prepared several ways. Started with beet salad and the onion/oxtail soup, both very good. 4 people in our party; salmon, filet, 2 scallops, spinach, lobster potatoes and the truffle mac and cheese. Salmon was okay, scallops were good and the sides were good. This is where it goes wrong, this is a high end steakhouse right? How do you overcook filet? And at an $80 price tag! I ordered medium and got well done. Really? When I showed the server she completely agreed and said she could get a replacement. Problem is that the meal took way longer than it should in the first place so waiting for a replacement was not an option. So when I politely said I would just muddle through she said she would make sure and take care of it. Service overall was polite but really slow. Everyone appreciates polite breaks between courses but this was way too long. So when the check came and she said we took off half the price of the steak I just stared at her. I was dumbfounded. You just expect more from this kind of a restaurant. I won't be back. Too many other great steakhouses in Vegas. I can even go to Outback Steakhouse and get a properly cooked filet!

We ordered west coast oysters and crab cakes for our appetizers.  The oysters were super fresh, but I could have done without the crab cakes.  Don't get me wrong, the cakes were good: made with whole lump crab and contained no fillers, but it just wasn't anything to write home about.  

I shared a 30 oz. porterhouse Angus steak with my sister.  We ordered it medium rare and it gloriously arrived at our table to perfection!  They even sliced it for us, knowing that we were planning to share!  It literally melted in your mouth.  No joke.

We ordered 3 side dishes and shared them family style -- Spinach Souffle with Parmesan Cream Sauce, Truffled Mac and Cheese, and Blue Cheese crusted Potatoes Au Gratin.  And I have to say, all of them exceeded my expectations.  The Souffle was delicate but flavorful, the Mac and Cheese deserves an entire review to itself (I was worried it was going to be too heavy and the noodles mushy and overcooked, but alas, I was wrong!), and the Au Gratin was the right balance of creamy and salty goodness.

As if everything we've had at this point wasn't enough, we ordered beignets with creme brulee and passion fruit panna cotta with coconut and mandarin sorbet.  Somebody punch me.  Although the creme brulee was tiny, the beignets were warm and comforting.  The panna cotta was creamy, delicious and refreshing.

Just from everything I've ever heard about Michael Mina restaurants, I was expecting high brow, snooty service, but instead, we had the most attentive server who was pleasant, downright kind and totally normal.  I could tell that he shared a love for the food and was happy to explain and answer all of our questions!  

This restaurant really hit all of the buttons for me: great food, fantastic service and impeccable attention to detail.  Even the music that was playing in the restaurant was pleasantly unexpected.   Tables are not that close to each other and the booths give you a sense of privacy.  Yeah, it's pricey, but worth every penny.",PjWbZe8ZpO1_sugOACJ7qw,1,0,5,dBn2cIzqbDoeVFgUox6jYA

The room is laid out like a cafeteria: cold...hard...tinny acoustics....wooden tables.

The bone-in rib-eye I had was expensive and had the consistency of an Arby's sirloin (never been there but I can't imagine it's good).

The wines by the glass are way overpriced.

The complimentary duck fries come out so early that they're cold by the time the steaks arrive.

The only memorable thing is the pan-baked bread.

This is possibly the worst steak place I've been to in Las Vegas. That tacky joint at Circus Circus is better.

It was cooked a perfect medium-rare and had flavor beyond anything I've seen in my life.  Maybe my expectations were too high or what not for this second time around, but I got the burger again.  It was a little bit burned on the outside and below rare on the inside.  The waitress made a pretty snobby comment when I asked for a new one ""You did ask for it medium-rare"" to which I replied ""I did, in which I'd expected it to be cooked"".  She brought out another one which was cooked just about the same way, except a bit more burnt and a bit rarer in the middle; I ended up not eating either.  I ended up asking for the manager and getting the burger off of the bill.  

The filet my wife had was tasty, but I'm not sure if it was a $56 steak.  Then again I'm pretty cheap.

Gotta put a shout out to the tasty fries they bring out to start the meal.

Maybe your luck will be better than mine, my first time there I would have given 5 stars but this time more inclined towards 2 or 3, only giving 3 due to the manager being cool about the grills running hot or whatever else seemed to be happening.

Yes, the duck fat fries were very good. I preferred the truffle oil fries, the others didn't seem all that different than regular seasoned fries to be honest. I absolutely loved the richness of the potato focccacia bread. For appetizers we went with crab louie with avocado lettuce cups and the lobster, bacon-wrapped fritters. The crab cups were so fresh and came with a great spicy sauce...very refreshing and bite sized (especially after the heavy amuse).  The lobster fritters were served on a stick and came with a great, light, almost frothy lemon dipping sauce to roll into the lettuce. Again, light and refreshing, especially for something that was fried. 

What was not light was the rest of the meal. I ordered the ahi, seared rare, very delicious and well seasoned for not being blackened. Sides were truffle mac and cheese and bacon creamed spinach. To die for! I am not a mac and cheese person, but figured I'd give it a try, and love it! I was so upset with myself for filling up and not being able to finish everything! I really tried so hard. My date got the prime rib, which he enjoyed as well.

It tasted very good too.   It came with a large side of duck fat fries with garlic/herbs which were awesome.  Such a large amount of food - it is almost enough for 2 people.

We got last minute reservations on a Saturday night for 9:30pm, which was lucky because the place was packed!  Muse was playing the arena nearby so there was a huge rush before we arrived.  I had the ahi tuna and my buddy had the salmon.  Each was around $40, but with the coupon, it came out to about $46 after tax and tip.  Not a bad price for Strip Steak!

The decor is very modern, with a small dining area (has booths as well as tables), a bar and a small lounging area. It was 5 people in our party, and as soon as we sat down, they brought out complimentary duck fat fries cooked 3 different ways: truffle, old bay and regular, and it came with dipping sauces. Next 4 out of the 5 of us ordered the 18oz dry aged bone-in rib eye, medium rare (cuts like butter, very juicy). As a appetizer , we ordered the roasted bone marrow, which was really good, but smaller than the other places I've ordered the bone marrow at. For sides, we ordered the potato puree trio that comes in 3 different flavors: sour cream/onion, lobster, and horseradish. Another side we ordered IS A MUST, which is the truffle mac and cheese! It was so good.

Overall, the service was excellent, the food was great, but the place is pricey, but at the same time, you get what you paid for, so it was all worth it.

3932339,2008-12-04,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"When I strolled into this joint with my pockets bulging with Mandalay Bay chips I expected to be completely blown away. The place is nicely designed and of course has the usual eye-candy-ish host staff at the front desk that you learn to expect at these fancy schmancy type places. The young blond hottie proceeded to seat me right next to another couple who were dressed to impress while I was looking slightly better than alley trash. My first thought was to ask to move, but then I decided that since I might get bored at any moment that I would just sit there and eavesdrop on their conversation. 

When I gamble I usually either GO BIG, or play really conservative, so I decided to treat this meal the same way. I pulled out a quarter and gave it a flip. Tails for cheap. Alright the theme has been set. Instead of ordering the $180 wagyu 8oz steak I opted for the 16? 18? oz $51bone-in rib-eye. For a side-dish I chose the ""caramelized onion and goat cheese scalloped potatoes"" which came in at like $13 or $14. I also ordered WATER. Bottled water sir? No, just regular water please. Oh and with the steak please bring me an $18 a glass of this cheap Cabernet. Would you like an appetizer to start off with sir? No. A salad or some crab-cakes? No thanks. I'm not really starving right now so I can wait. 

So as the waiter rushes off I proceed to listen to the life-stories of this couple I was seated next to and waited for my food. Ahem, Sir the chef sent you this complimentary fries, three different types of fries, each paired with its own special dip. Actually these fries were pretty good, but if you go here, I wouldn't spend 9 bucks for them, just wait for them to get comped. 

Anyhow, the steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, but it had a little more fat and bone than I would have liked. The scalloped potatoes were excellent. A little rich for some people I would suspect but good for me. 
While savoring the taste of the rib-eye, a thought occurred to me: When I cook rib-eyes over mesquite wood at home on my BBQ after seasoning them properly, they taste almost exactly like this. Ahh well, probably just overestimating my own potential again. 

To give this place a fair review I would probably have to kick out more cash than the $94 bucks I spent here. It was good. It is probably a great place to take a date to impress or the wife/girlfriend/mistress for some special occasion.  I guess you are paying for the ambiance.  It was good and I'll probably end up here again after pillaging the Mandalay blackjack tables, but not overly impressive, at least with the cheap stuff I ordered.",YCkSm_4c5_d5OteO2d60Eg,1,1,3,tGzngx2yYFBQOz4RHNOJoQ
3936257,2013-09-02,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"This is a lovely steak house located in Mandalay Bay with great decor, excellent service, and a classy ambiance.  So why 2 stars?  Quite frankly, our steaks were incorrectly prepared.

First some background: I make a middling 5 figure salary, so I can't afford to eat $60 steaks very often.  But when I do, it's usually worth every penny.  I've happily dropped $300 on a single meal because it's difficult to find world-class beef that is expertly aged and prepared.

I ordered the ribeye medium and my fiancee had the filet mignon medium-well (each is currently $59), we had the spicy zucchini and asparagus sides, and we ordered two glasses of Michael Mina's cabernet.  When our steaks arrived, I was bitterly disappointed to find that my ribeye was overcooked, somewhere between medium-well and well-done (no trace of pink whatsoever), while my fiancee's filet was completely well-done.  

Our vegetable sides were about quantity over quality: I'm not sure how many fistfuls of zucchini and asparagus is customary for two people, but the zucchini was hardly spicy and the asparagus was elementary.  I'm certain I could've made either side at home blindfolded.

All the work that goes into designing and executing such a beautiful restaurant flies out the window the instant the chef overcooks your steak.  When the apex of your evening on the town is your dinner, and the keystone of your dinner is your incorrectly prepared steak, it puts a damper on your mood.  I am not one to send back food, mostly because it irreparably throws off the timing of the meal, but when I mentioned to our server the problem with our steaks, she informed us that lately customers had been complaining that their steaks were undercooked.  She had received authorization from the manager to give us complimentary desserts, but we declined.

Please keep in mind that the quality of the beef was superb, and the pacing of the meal was comfortable.  We were treated very well, and the wine was satisfying.  This review is not about the price nor the value for your money.  It is simply about two overcooked steaks and two underwhelming sides.

We ordered:
American Kobe Rib Cap w Foie Gras - top pick! as mentioned before, it was heaven in my mouth and the foie gras is top quality!
American Kobe Rib Eye - Not as good as the rib cap. it is leaner and not as rich but still marbled and better than the average rib eye
2 lb Grilled Lobster special- great but incomplete by itself.
Skirt Steak - PRetty tough but is expected of skirt steak. The one steak I did not enjoy all night
Dry Aged Ribeye - Very good, tender and with a good amount of fat. 
Lamb - Tender and not very gamey at all. I didn't care much for the accompaniments tho.
Potato puree - delicious. all 3 versions were quite good, the lobster is my favourite and tasted like lobster bisque!
Creamed spinach - pretty good
Mushrooms - not bad
Mac & cheese - doubled in size since our last visit but not as good. It was missing the random bits of broccoli that i enjoyed. Stil the best of all the sides.

My first time at Stripsteak and it was excellent!  I usually don't order steak out as it is almost always overcooked for me.  Based on the good reviews on Yelp, Stripsteak became an addition to my Restaurant Week list of places to go.

Amuse bouche:  Three containers of seasoned fries - garlic herb, truffle, and bay-seasoned.  There were three containers for dipping the fries one mustard and bay seasoned, truffle aioli, and ketchup.  Pace yourself here.  All tables are served the amuse bouche in lieu of a bread basket.  Since I was alone, I could have totally pigged out on these tasty fries.  5/5

Course 1:  Duck spring rolls.  Duck confit with sweet and sour cherry drizzle.  The duck was excellent and what a great appetizer.  5/5

Course 2:  OK, so I decided to get a steak.  It was the Kansas City strip steak with small sides of creamed corn and mushrooms.  The steak had a grilled small red onion and a yellow tinkerbell pepper.  The pepper is very mild.  The steak was grilled exactly as I ordered - black and blue. 5/5

Course 3:  Beignets and vanilla creme brulee.  Perfect ending to the meal.  I forced myself - yeah right - to finish the beignets.  5/5

As mentioned in other reviews, when you get ready to leave, you're given a small bag of candy popcorn with the Stripsteak logo to take as a gift.  It will be a TV snack some night.

My server, Alexis, was always available and attentive.  When the two eating next to me left for a bathroom trip, she refolded their napkins while they were gone.  I noticed this attention to detail and good service throughout the night.  

I was quite pleased to see the number of families with young, well behaved children.  There was a concert with someone named Selena Gomez at the Mandalay Events Center and thus the large number of children. Alexis had to explain to me who this Selena was.

A great evening and another wonderful Restaurant Week experience!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,3,5,RcfQpjMO113Kcge-_uQSpA

I had the bone in ribeye and the wife had the filet mignon.  The sides we shared at the table were the baked potato ( which is very unique and hard to explain, but delicious),  the jalapeño cream corn, and the potato gratin.  Cream corn was very good, but to me that gratin still has me thinking about how good it was.  Wife finished her meal off with the beignets which were wonderful.  Not too heavy with good dipping sauces/mousses.  Fat boy tip:  the truffle dipping aioli/sauce from the fries. if you have any left,  save it and try it with a chunk of steak.

I suggest you share an entree with your date and a couple sides.  A good appetizer to start with are the bacon wrapped lobster bites.  Yummy!  The aged bone in Rib Eye was flavorful.  Comes with a little onion and pepper, great with every bite.  No sauces like A-1 or Tabasco needed!  Haha!  

The truffled mac and cheese was the best mac and cheese I have ever tasted.  You can definitely taste the truffle oil, but I love it!  We also ordered the creamed corn which was good too, but I have had better.

Truly a delightful night!

Service, drinks, food, all outstanding!

Act 1 - Pear, caramel, nougat, goodness!  A delightful sweet to get us in the mood...

Act 2 - Duck fat fries three ways, with 3 unique dipping sauces, savory sweet spicy every base was covered, these fries were amazing, one of us at the table was a strict pescatarian, the house proceeded to make some cottonseed oil fries specifically for her, with out question or request....

Act 3 - Three tunas cooked just the way I like them, not at all...  Sashimi wonderful!  The albacore was simply the best I have ever experienced buttery, fresh, sumptuous, and addictive, the kind of flavor one may pursue the rest of their life...

Act 4 - Lobster grilled cheese with tomato soup...  I could not imagine this dish being bad in any way, shape or form, it was truly excellent! 

Act 5 - Aged veal ribeye, I want to say 60 or 80 days dry aged, I can not be certain, all I know for sure, is it melted in my mouth, it had a deep flavor that only a dry aged steak can achieve, almost Smokey but not...  One of the reasons I like ribeyes is the fat and flavor, this was an exceptionally lean cut ribey but still rich in flavor, this was a top notch cut of beef for sure!

Act 5  1/2 - Two sides accompanied the main course, a mélange of puree potato, horseradish, garlic, and lobster...  where is the straw because I could have drank these!  Good stuff!  Second was a hearty portion of thick tender asparagus, baked with lots of pepper and cheese atop, pepper and cheese, two of my favorite things!

Throughout this wonderful meal excursion lots of drinks were folded in, for me mainly bourbon, for my friends martinis and wine, I was lucky enough to be dining with fun peeps, so I got to try it all, and everything was there, you know where, just where it should be!

The steak was VERY greasy and not good at all you think paying $80 for a steak it would be amazing. But no. I would rather eat a steak at some chain restaurant. 

Our bill was $350 for 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, 2 sides and 2 drinks and tip. Thankfully I had a $50 restaurant.com certificate. 

I would never go back and was very disappointed in the execution. Also the waitress was not attentive and she added an automatic 18% since I used the restaurant.com certificate which is tacky.",vN7b9zpIsuY3HWMKh5pMJg,2,0,2,2fUGMeY5J6xkpklsMGTZhg

Ahi tuna tartare starter on crispy rice: adorable presentation, sizable portion and extremely flavorful.

Kansas City strip steak and side of jalapeño creamed corn: steak cooked PERFECTLY. Corn slightly underdone gave amazing texture with creamy sauce and background of heat. YUM. 

Amazing addition: all dishes were split between myself and my husband. No questions asked and no sneers given! Each dish was presented on separate plates, neatly split for us. Classy.

Service was impeccable yet friendly. Sommelier was the most approachable of any I have encountered, yet adequately knowledgeable. Atmosphere was lively and pleasant. Modern, clean design.

They don't do a traditional bread basket, they do fries made with duck fat. They were phenomenal. 3 different types each with it's own dipping sauce. My husband had the scotch flight and said it was very good. Started off with the crab spring rolls, probably would skip the $25 appetizer next time since we had a lot more food coming. We felt like we wasted it only having 2 people. Husband got the American vs Australian Wagyu entree, basically it was two different types of amazingly tender delicious beef. He thoroughly enjoyed it. I got the filet mignon, my usual, it was very good but tasted like many I've had before. We shared the trio of potato purée, lobster, sour cream and onion and horseradish. Horseradish and sour cream and onion were delicious but I generally don't like lobster that much. All three were very good. Didn't do dessert but they all sounded delicious.

I came to StripSteak for a business function and a group of approximately 20 different people. The dining space is slightly upscale, with a welcoming atmosphere, nice lighting, and not ridiculously loud music. Service was tentative and friendly was worked our group well without hiccups. The food was from a fixed menu like usual with larger groups, choosing a starter, and your entree from 2-3 choices. I had a prawn starter that came with 3 large prawns and a sauce on the plate (i don't see this on regular menu). Fresh, good, and perfect starter for a much heavier beef entree to come very soon. My steak choices were of the 16 oz. Rib eye or 10 oz. Filet and i opted for the filet as i wasn't overly hungry and the smaller cut would be perfect. The meat was pleasantly prepared consistent throughout the table and was of quality you would expect at a place like StripSteak. Sides that were offered were Broccolini and Mashed Potatoes, the Broccolini was quite tasty and i didnt try the Potatoes but im sure they were good as well given the feedback at the table. All in all it was a good meal, actually the best i had over the 4 day event being in town and having a meal each night at a new place. You would expect that when you come to a place such as StripSteak, with the pricing that your meal should always be a thumbs up but its not the case. The same time last year a similar group went to Carnevino, and the quality of the food was not up to par as i am guessing it has to do with maybe the large group and fixed menu. So if your looking for a quality spot that will handle your corporate event, with good food, solid service, and a positive impression StripSteak ranks up there for me.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,2,1,4,dsBCP4G1ntmUXLXhqwfE7w

I ordered the Wagyu Ribeye Cap. It was the best steak I have ever had. I got a Kobe steak (forgot what cut) at Charlie Palmer which was amazing but for some reason the Wagyu Ribeye Cap at Strip Steak was better. I got it medium rare and it came out perfect, at first glance it looked like an ordinary steak but once I cut into the steak I knew I was in for a treat, it was moist and jam packed with flavor! My gf usually gets the regular rib eye which is amazing as well but in a different way. What turned me on to this place was the price, after browsing many steakhouses in Vegas, Strip Steak had the cheapest Wagyu steaks. =)  In addition to great steaks, their sides are pretty good as well. They also seem to always give you the duck fat fries which as others mentioned compliments of the chef. All I care is that they are free and very tasty too, they come with 3 very different dipping sauces. One of the sauces is basically ketchup, another is almost like a peppery bbq sauce and my favorite was the truffle sauce. I never knew fries could be so good with this sauce. Also if you order the iced tea, you get a cool mini pitcher of sweetner to add to your tea. My gf and I thought that was pretty cool and made the iced tea taste better than adding splenda or equal.

4102217,2011-05-14,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Very disappointing.

First the ambiance. It's extremely loud, almost to the point of not being able to hear the person across from you.  Tables with no cloths and paper place mats.  That seems to be the thing with a lot of Vegas steak houses now, charge premium prices but present a coffee shop atmosphere.  

None of that is as important as the food, of course.  We both love steak tartare, so we ordered that for the appetizer.  It was loaded with black pepper. So much so, that frankly, that's all I could taste.  

Then a 50 minute wait for our main course.  At about 40 minutes I was getting irate and was just about to go complain when the general manager did stop by our table to apologize and say our food would be here shortly.  

When the main course did finally arrive, the wagyu filets we both ordered were both cooked perfectly, and were melt-in-your-mouth delicous.  I ordered a lobster tail with mine, and it was small and chewy.  The sides  we ordered were average, not bad, but nothing great.

The service was friendly, but very poor. Our server seemed a bit...how should I say this...out of it.  Whenever she came to our table she had a huge smile on her face, as if she just a heard a hilarious joke.  But if I asked her a question about something, she didn't even respond, as if she didn't hear me.  I know it was loud in there, but you would think she could see me looking at her with my lips moving.  Because of the 50 minute wait (during which we never saw her, by the way), we had finished our bottle of wine before the steaks even arrived, so I ordered another glass with our main course.   She finally brought it with desert. Along with our coffee. SIgh.  Speaking of desert, it was fine, once again nothing special, but pretty good.

$460.00 with tip for the two of us. That included a $120 bottle of wine.  It was just not worth it. Craftsteak is much better, and Delmonico is much much better.  

I'm baffled at all the rave reviews.  Maybe we just hit it on a bad night?  Or maybe a lot of people have just never been to a really good steak house?  I mean, yeah we did get the free french fries too, and they were tasty, but really, they're just french fries people",3Riuwx_9xYhuqu0y1cuSFg,3,0,2,keo2TWFNV5VhAl13Ht8Gdw

The place was dead, yet the waiter seemed busy and distracted. We waited about ten minutes before being bought menus, then we had to prod him about the prix fixe menu.  

I had the cucumber martini, husband selected the rock n rye.  He said his drink was pretty good, but mine had a weird sweetish taste to it. Wine list was brought back out before dinner, but the waiter couldn't seem to get the wine out before the entrees.    

We ordered the prix fixe rib eye, and filet, medium rare.  The waiter gushed over the amuse-bouche fries, ""special this evening,"" which I knew wasn't, because of Yelp.  My filet arrived overdone. While my husband's ribeye was nice and juicy, mine was gray and dry.  I had to call the waiter over twice, he talked me out of it once, then after a second bite, I had to convince the waiter to take it back. Then I was brought a second steak - cooked properly, but fatty.  *Sigh* I accepted it. I would've rather had that first one, not overdone.  

Despite the method of ""butter poaching"" the steak to make it ""juicy,"" my filet was on the dry side.

We had a choice of bibb lettuce salad or crab chowder (go for the salad), sides were a sampling of truffle mac-n-cheese, creamed spinach with bacon (came out cold), and sauteed brussel sprouts (the best), and beniets with chocolate, butterscotch (yum), or creme brulee (okay).

Drinks- mine (rock'n rye) was great with a gentle cinammon bitters flavor & a mondo ice cube.  Wife's--some kind of pomegranate or blueberry mixed drink (from the cocktails menu)--very average to her taste & mine.

Filet (bone OFF) came cooked a little below my medium instruction, which was a surprise according to some contrasting reviews here.  However I was pleased with the quality & flavor nevertheless.  Last time i visited almost 2 years ago, I recall my piece of meat being on the mark of my requested temperature.

Sides were very good, as they must be at an a la carte steakhouse of this caliber.  Chef's treat of duck fat fries are perhaps the best side! Yet I've had better sides at Flemings and /or Ruth's.  I think we had about a 3* service experience this time; but had about a 4.5* the last time (waiter was a lot better then).

The food was pretty weak, I don't know if it was just off or if it's the way that it is here. I won't be back to do it again. 
For appetizer we had the tuna crisp things and the foie gras. Both were pretty plain, and didn't actually do a whole lot for either of us. Matter of fact both were kind of a waste of time. 
My wife had the wagyu filet, and I had the wagyu rib cap. So to basically describe the flavor perfectly...I had to ask for salt. I have never had to ask for salt at a steak place. There was no flavor. It was literally flavorless. The only flavor was that slight burnt oil flavor that occurs just when the oil/butter starts to blacken and turn a little greasy. It wasn't greasy, but it did have a hint of that flavor.

Quality of food:  The food here is good.  Not great (4star) not amazing (5 star) just good.  The steaks were cooked perfectly how you ask and they have a pretty decent rub on them.  They are aged and tender as one would expect from any big name steak house.  They gave us a complimentary selection of pommes frittes which were delectable and the truffled mac and cheese was tasty.  However, not a single one of these items mentioned above was better than a 3.5 star rating.  

You could argue that my palate cannot discern the difference between the beefs, but I would like to at least think I can tell the difference between a grain fed cow and one that is massaged by the japanese from kobe.  It also could just be that I've had so many steakhouse steaks that an aged piece of prime beef with a generic rub of salt/pepper just is old hat to me.  

Service: The service is very good.  As expected from any high end vegas restaurant, they were very attentive and always served you with a smile.  I was amused with the sommelier we saw opening a bottle of wine.  You see, our table was right next to the small station where they open all the bottles of wine.  One table ordered one with a synthetic wine cork.  I know from experience those things are a B*^%@ to open.  It was comforting to know that a man who drinks and dispenses wine for a living also has problems with said cork.

Ambiance: Dimly lit, contemporary decor, open kitchen with the meat locker right next to it.  The restaurant is a great place for a date.  

Price: This is where I felt they fall WAY short.  We walked out of there for about 70 to 80 per person.  This included a steak and a side.  The lady got a sirloin steak and i got the ribeye.  If you've been out, you know that the sirloin is the cheaper of the few cuts.  That's why I was surprised that the total bill was pushing over 150.  

Dont' get me wrong, the strip steak was great.  The ribeye was good.  But in all honesty, I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris or Flemmings where they have something unique.  The broiled steak with butter.  Quality of the meat MIGHT not be as good but it doesn't fall too far away from that at Stripsteak.

After I found out they serve imported Japanese A5 Wagyu, I had to try it!

I called to check the price the night before.. $185 for a 6oz Ribeye.  Pricey! It was the most expensive steak I've ever had.  Although I prefer Filet, if it's really A5, it should be just as tender as a Filet.   I think the Wagyu at CUT at the Palazzo is A3, but don't hold me to that. 

I decided to risk it, and I arrived on a Tuesday Eve around 6pm w/o reservations.  I was seated on arrival.  The booth was very comfortable with fluffy pillows.   

Instead of bread, they served a complimentary trio of Duck Fat fries.  They each had different seasonings, and dipping sauces.  

I liked the garlic sauce the best, it was very thin, and rich and I knew I was racking up the calories when I was eating it.   It was one of the best dipping sauces I've ever had. The fries themselves were maybe 3.5-4 star, not the best I've had, but better than average.  I usually don't use dipping sauces on my fries, but the garic dip was excellent.   

The fries were better than Wolfgang's CUT steakhouse french fry side dish. 

I ordered the A5 Japanese Ribeye Wagyu ($185) along with Foie Gras as a side ($19)

It came pretty fast.  The restaurant itself wasn't very busy.  I dropped by the night before around 830-9, and it looked alot busier.   The bar was packed, though.

The steak was good. It was very tender, as I expected.  Very buttery, and rich.  The seasoning was outstanding.  The steak came pre sliced in thin slices, about 8-10 pieces.  I suppose they can make sure it is cooked correctly throughout.   Mine came out medium rare, as requested.  
Compared to the wagyu filet I tried at CUT in Beverly Hills, I have to say this comes very close to being the best steak I've ever had.  It was on Par, for sure... 

The foie gras was maybe the best I've ever had! It was more tender than the steak, like butter, served hot, and was very rich.  It was well worth the $19.   

I had no room for dessert, and nothing looked too appetizing to me. 
Overall, a very outstanding meal for a very expensive price.   Bring your wallet, the total with tax and tip was nearly $270.  That is for just 1 person. The soda is $4 a pop w/ no freebie refills.",lGj7s42BJx_Xg7ZgaO_dmA,5,3,5,7hWFq_1wyTEUJ-ZZZiSnrA

In this case we are talking about a Vegas, and you only get one shot to impress and hope people spread the word about your Steak house.

(no problem) 10 mins goes by and nobody is yet to stop by our table. Finally the same host saw that we hadn't been helped. So he brings up a dinner and drink menu. Takes our order for the drink and they come. Now we are just back to sitting around waiting for our server to come by.  I then pull out my cell phone and start the stopwatch on it. 23 MINS later our server comes by. Proceeds to tell us about the menu.

I had to ask that server for the Fries that come on the house because our server never came back or brought them. I ordered the 16oz NY Strip and my wife ordered the Filet Mignon.

The interior is sleek, dark, and modern. I liked the meat on display; kinna like a fancy chinatown bbq. We got seated in the bar area of the restaurant which irked me since I made reservations a 2 weeks in advance, but our server was great. Knowledgable about the menu and answered all our questions in the smallest mini dress you could find. Hey, it's Vegas.

I got the Kobe beef; I can't remember the exact name but it was a mix of different parts of the cow. Amazing and tender and melt in your mouth. The birthday girl got a porterhouse and equally delicious as well.

Wasn't planning on getting side dishes since the duck fat fries were filling, but we ended up getting potatoes au gratin and asparagus. The asparagus had something sweet on top that didn't jive with me. But overall they went very well with the steak.

I told them it was my girlfriend's birthday and I was under the impression they would give us a free birthday dessert with 'happy birthday' written in chocolate, but you have to actually order a dessert for that to happen. Weak.

FOOD:
---------
To be honest, not much else stood out during this meal other than my soulmate (aka PB). Everything else was slightly underwhelming. 

Surprisingly, the complimentary **Duck Fat Fries** were pretty bomb, and the second best thing we ate here. Very light and crispy and goes well with any of the trio of sauces.

Second up was our appetizer, none other than the incredible! super edible! pork belly--its proper name being **Instant Bacon** ($22). See opening paragraph for my full assessment of this dish.

Since this is a STEAK place, we figured we'd better order one. The **10 oz Prime Flat Iron** ($48) did not live up to expectations and was definitely not worth the cost. Even thought it was done medium, the meat was dry and lacked flavor. Super disappointing.

For side dishes--often the best part of any meal--we got the **Potato Gratin** ($17) which came with gouda and the **Creamed Spinach** ($14) topped with bacon streusel. Both were decent but neither really met my side dish hopes and dreams. However, they did make the steak easier to eat!

The **Vanilla Cheesecake** with strawberries and shantilly cream was the chef's special for the night. It was simply perfection. Thank you to executive pastry chef Monica Delgadillo for helping us end the night on the right note.

AMBIANCE/SERVICE:

The storefront is super impressive with full glass panels and brightly lit signs indicating your dinner destination. Even the reception desk outside is lit up, so there's no question where you start your journey. The attire here is mixed, some in cocktail dresses and others in casual/business casual attire.

From the hosts to the servers to the bussers, everyone was extremely pleasant. Our server was particularly helpful, especially since he's the one who alerted me to.... PORK BELLY!!!! aka Instant Bacon. I will be forever grateful. 

TIP: I would return here for (at least) three  --3-- Instant Bacons and the pastry's special dessert for the night.

I ordered the marrow bones to go with my steak, and for $29.00, I was expecting larger marrow bones, and at least a marrow spoon to extract it with. Instead I got two 1 inch bones, and I had to fish out what I could with the back side of my fork.

All in all, it wasn't an exceptional meal, but it wasn't bad either.
But there was 4 of us, no alcohol, and the bill was almost $600.00. 

For that price, and based on Michaels reputation, I was expecting a lot more.",IlzXT_dFrwlAc1GWp5yJpg,0,0,3,LCgPK2NtXs8T_S9k9saIKQ

Okay, I get it. There just seems to be the ""Vegas factor"" in many non-buffet restaurants (okay...buffet restaurants too). The food prices just seem to be much more than back home in Canada, even after taxes. I understand the whole phrase ""go big or go home"", but at the end, is it worth it?

Stripsteak is located inside Mandalay Bay, which mind you is probably one of the largest hotels in The Strip...and one of the most poorly accessible from public transit. Good thing I was living in NYNY so I was able to take the tram there. The first thing you would've thought is that with the high prices, the restaurant would've been on the quiet side. Nope! It's about as loud as a Chinese dim sum restaurant on a Saturday afternoon; very loud.

We ordered the Japanese A4 wagyu satays, American wagyu vs. Australian wagyu, NY strip, and wagyu rib eye. Yeah I know, a lot of wagyu...I mean, you don't get wagyu in many places in Canada! As for the food quality...the two wagyu comparisons were interesting, but I certainly did not feel the value of $69 for all the wagyu foods, and honestly the $59 NY strip tasted a little better. However, this restaurant is definitely something I would recommend trying once if you're a steak lover, but not twice.

Service was great though. The server explained all our foods when we first ordered, and when they were being delivered one by one. We also got complimentary fries and different dipping sauces for each fries. Again, it's a restaurant I was glad I tried since I was able to experience a non-buffet higher end dining style in Vegas, but I wouldn't do it again.",1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,0,0,3,V0WdJM5OU7RREmAHGoZPpw

Service - A+++! Our waiter impressed us with his recommendations, his manner, and how attentive he was during dinner. I heart him. 

Food - A+! My husband ordered the skirt steak with a add-on of crab legs. Originally he ordered the lobster tail, but our waiter recommended the crab legs, since they are a bit bigger, more bang for your buck! (I said that not the waiter lol) He LOVED it. He was smiling the whole time. He was happy that the waiter recommended the crab legs because he loved them too! 

I ordered the Kobe burger. I ordered it well done. I always order my meat well done. My burger came out kinda charred. Not sure if it was the ""well-done"" factoring in. I actually had to cut the top and bottom off the patty so I could taste the flavor of the meat. It wasn't a big deal. Like I said I am not a big meat person. I didn't mind if my meat patty was 1/2 the size in the end. If I ate here again, I would def not order the burger. I was eying the roasted chicken.. maybe I'll get that next time. 

The sides! The mac and cheese is a must order! We also ordered the scalloped potatoes which wasn't AMAZINGLY good. For 2 people I would say one side order would've been adequate. We barely touched the potatoes. Probably because I ate all the fries... 

My husband wants to come back every time we are in Vegas. Yes, it made him that happy. And trust me this guy is hard to please!",eSdQJJx3s-4uKS9ofr0zhw,1,1,5,OR7PZwRE2KHQjwwwza9nDA

StripSteak has several side dishes to choose from and we ordered the Mac and Cheese based on our waiters recommendation.  The waiter said this was enough for 2 people, I'd have to say it was enough for at least 4 since we had the fries and entrees.  Dinner was amazing and unfortunatly we skipped dessert.

The hostesses were sweet and friendly, and once seated our server was professional and pleasant, never pressuring us to order hastily, really letting us relax and enjoy our meal.  The service here never disappoints - it is always on point.

Oysters and hamachi were the appetizers we chose, and both were delicious.  We really enjoyed the green goddess sauce served with the oysters, and the hamachi was probably my favorite dish of the night.  The fish was buttery and fresh, and the sauce drizzled over it had a nice heat that really punched up the overall flavor of the dish.  Definintely recommend trying it!

The steaks were perfect per usual, and the seafood was just as fresh as I remembered.  The server recommended the ribeye, and it really was the star of the show.  A blue cheese topping took it over the top, but it was not so heavy that the entire steak could not be finished by one person.
For sides we loved the mushrooms and pearl onions.  They tasted great as a topping on just about everything, but also as a side just eaten on their own.  The pureed potatoes were also creamy and delicious (something new that we tried), but the portion size was huge.  One order is plenty for 4+ adults to share, and definitely try them topped with lobster.  
If you save room, the sorbet for dessert is a simple, sweet way to end your meal, but if you are feeling more decadent, the dessert menu should not be missed.

Be sure to make reservations - and don't miss the Hamachi!

First off the restaurant has a hip and modern feel.  The one thing I noticed that I really didn't like was how crowded the room is.  The tables are basically one on top of another, not much spacing at all.  On to the food.

First came the Trio of Duck Fat Fries.  I was looking forward to the them but came out underwhelmed.  They tasted like french fries.  They were good fries but did not understand all the hype.  Next I ordered the crab cake appetizer.  2 pcs filled with dungeness crab fried up like a hush puppy.. It was decent but nothing spectacular.  I found too many shell fragments in the crab cake.  Maryland style crab cakes are way better.  For the main course I ordered the 6 oz Japanese A5 NY Strip, grillled Foie Gras, and Truffled Mac & Cheese.  The steak was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  It came with a Yuzu dipping sauce on the side which added nothing to the steak.  The one thing I didn't like was that it was way over seasoned. (for a $185 piece of meat it should be perfect)  The foie was good not great.  The mac & cheese was pretty good.  With all the components being so rich, I didn't have room for dessert.

Service was decent.  I was not offered the potato foccacia bread.  Not sure if this was because I was solo but I didn't make a fuss about it because I honestly wasn't as hungry as I wanted to be because of brunch earlier in the day.  This was my first time at a Michael Mina restaurant and I came away unimpressed.

Logistics: Make sure to go here when you are not in a rush, you will want to move slowly through the courses. They will ask you what your timing is, if you need to be somewhere. Also, make reservations at least ~24 hours in advance to ensure you get in when you want. Everyone needs to be there when you arrive for your reserved time.

Service: Fantastic- our server was a New England fan (we are from New England), so naturally we got along very well. He was spectacular in his recommendations for everything. 

Food: Delicious!

- Pork Belly: If you are used to fatty, melt in your mouth pork belly, this is a bit different. It is smoked so not alot of fat on it but still good.

4411839,2009-10-21,2,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Stripsteak, a steakhouse brought forth by the all-powerful Michael Mina, is rightfully located in the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino as the perfect Sin City restaurant. 

Why do you ask? Stripsteak is a vegetarian and Kosher eater's hell, but to a carnivorous foodie, it is simply the Garden of Eden. It's a place where giant haunches of beef are hung up to age in a wall-to-floor ceiling glass case, not unlike a display at a natural history museum chronicling the stages of decomposition, or rather, the stages to one delicious steak. 

And the food, oh, the food. As I write this, my mind is wandering back to the memories from that deeply satisfying meal. 

First, I had the trio of duck fat fries--each fry was a dream, with a shatteringly crunchy, smoky shell and a fluffy interior. My friends and I fought over the truffled fries and light garlic aioli especially, but the BBQ dusted fries and the original were stellar as well.

And if that wasn't enough, we also ordered their spinach souffle, as an attempt in incorporating some vegetables in our meal. The state-of-the-art souffle was placed on the table by the server with great care as to not deflate the impossibly high, cloud-like confection. Then, he took it to a even higher level by pouring a luxurious Parmesan cream sauce from a dainty saucer. Just as the Fairy Godmother transformed Cinderella into the belle of the ball, Mina transformed the dowdy spinach into a classic French beauty.

But even the beauteous spinach souffle couldn't hold a candle next to the Rib-eye, for that steak has been through rigorous training. First, it begins its epic journey in the aging room, where's it's kept in a moisture and temperature controlled room to slowly mature for a month. The chef then trims the the sides of beef with an expertise not unlike a plastic surgeon to remove all unsightly dried bits and excess fat before portioning it into perfectly formed steaks. The next step is crucial: the steak is then poached in butter. A big no-no in the Kosher community as they forbid the fraternizing of meat and diary, but in my world, a big OH YES. For the finishing touch, the Rib-eye is then charred in their 1,000 degree grill for that deep smoky sear. 

The best part was that the steak came to our table au naturale. With steak this juicy and well-seasoned, there's no need for A-1.

It's impossible to fall into a deep food coma coming out from a meal there, but it's oh so worth it. A definite must-eat destination for my next Vegas trip!",u-s03Dd-N5SbSIRhKSSkSA,1,1,5,L-7YLGl0l3qyTHfbl7Y3_Q

After the fries, they do in fact still give you foccacia bread baked in a mini pan so you have it all to yourself. Yummmm. I opted for the short ribs and my bf went with the prime rib. I know its a steakhouse but we just weren't in the mood for steak. The prime rib was not the best but I wouldn't be too hard to critique based on that because I'm sure they aren't known for their prime ribs. The short ribs were very tender.

Interior was modern, masculine and bold (just like a good man), and while busy at dinner time, it didn't feel crowded. The service was surprisingly good.

Pricing knocked me a little off my grandpa rocker, especially since in scanning the wine list, I could only find two $40 bottles of wine, with the most expensive being $28K. Instead, we opted for cocktails, which were spot on!

Every table was brought a trio of duck fried french fries with dipping sauces. A perfect opener to a delightfully debaucherous dinner. Steak was prepared exactly as we requested.

Truffled mac and cheese - Again, very tasty mac and cheese, and the truffled flavor was excellent.  A strong choice, but not anything that is phenomenal or mind-blowing to speak of.  

Potato puree trio - Great concept: three types of flavored mashed potatos served side by side.  The lobster mashed had a few small chunks of lobster in it (so my companion told me, as I didn't get any lobster bites in the three spoonfuls I tried) and was interesting to taste.  The sour cream and onion was a pretty standard flavor, that probably could've used a slightly stronger seasoning as it tastes nearly plain compared to the other two.  The horseradish was easily the best tasting, and one of the standouts during dinner.  Something as simple as horseradish added to well made potato puree made it a really standout.  

Beingets with vanilla creme brulee - Crisp on the outside giving way to soft pillow interior, the beingets were fried perfectly with a dusting of sugar.  And the vanilla creme brulee provided a perfect sugar crust on top to crak, and had a perfectly smooth creme inside that made every bite enjoyable.  This dessert had great execution, and was delicious.

Finally, at the end of the meal, they provided two complimentary bags of peppered caramel popcorn to take home with us.  The popcorn was tasty, and the complimentary final note was a nice touch.  I enjoyed the popcorn about an hour later, and the texture had staled only sligthtly compared to freshly made, but it was a nice reminder of the meal we just had.

Verdict:  A very solid steak restaurant and worth checking out.  They attempt to differentiate by using wood to grill (thus infusing the flavor of the wood into the meat) but to be honest, I can't taste a significant difference.  Service was top notch, food was top notch, and the overall experience was great.  Would I be back?  Possibly, to enjoy a good meal, but having had the opportunity to eat at a lot of great steak places, it's hard to warrant traveling to Vegas and coming by here again when there are so many other options of great food to try.  Great experience!",_qRV6YI3wm6hF0SF-2z8ng,3,1,4,_PgD3I0P76c9jVspzjZt-w

Wow. This was by far our worst dining experience in Vegas.  It was the worst spent $700 ever. We made a reservation for 7 people about 1 month ago since we were going to be in town for a trade show. Our last appointment ran late, so four of us showed up the restaurant late. 3 were already there, but couldn't be seated until the missing 4 arrived. They could have been ordering drinks and appetizers, but instead, the table sat empty.  

We arrived and were told that we could eat, but that we would have to be out of our table by 9. Okay, that is fair, but how they treated us after that was not.  

We had plenty of time to eat, in fact we finished 20 minutes before 9. But we kept getting pushed...the waiter first said that he would choose out appetizers (because us reading the menu for 2 mins was too much) He kept reminding us that we were in a hurry. We rushed through our food and at 8:40 the waiter gave us dessert menus, threw some fiddle faddle packages, courtesy of the chef, on the table, and said that we could choose dessert and that we MIGHT have time to eat it.  Seriously guy? 

Gratuity was included. We didn't give a penny more.  On the way out we commented to the hostess that they could have handled that situation way differently.  Understating that we had to be done by 9, they could have sped things up in the kitchen instead of constantly reminding us that we needed to rush. She argued with us instead of apologizing.  That is not customer service. 

Even more disappointing, we LOVE Michael Mina restaurants.  And planned ALL Michael Mina restaurants for our trip. This Michael Mina restaurant let us down :( But--American Fish (Aria) and Michael Mina (Bellagio) are both excellent!!!",1ldXhP-krxnZfVtnAd3WOQ,10,1,1,m-zo0jSmUMsW3Vy1EdpdiA

For my meal I ordered the filet mignon medium rare.  It came out as ordered.  The meat had good flavor.  You can distinctly taste the wood it is cooked on.  It is not my first choice, but it was good none the less.  It was tender and juicy.

The sides are served family style.  I tried the crispy potato cakes.  They were very good.  The scallion creme fraiche added some good flavor as well.

For dessert I ordered the beignets with 18 year old Macallan butterscotch pudding.  The beignets were very good.  They did not have as much powdered sugar as Cafe Du Monde, but were at least as good in flavor.  The butterscotch pudding was very good as well.  The Macallan shot gave it some added depth and a little kick.

The Angus was about as good as any I had tried, but once you try the Kobe, it just isnt in the same league.  We went for the American Kobe which was 70 bucks for the Filet, as apposed to the Japanese A5 Kobe which was 180 bucks!  And it was succulent and juicy, and almost caused me to drool as I chewed.

4465021,2015-12-29,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Having experiencing the happy hour of this establishment many times, this was our first time eating here for dinner. At first the service seemed very slow but as the night progressed, the service level of attentiveness did not change. So expectations were not necessarily met when compared to the service received during happy hour. Also, having dined at Tom Colicchio's Heritage steak restaurant the night before, where the experience and atmosphere was much better put a damper when dining here and raised the bar of expectation. 

**Food**

As a complimentary dish from the chef, we were given the trio of duck fat fries. One is the truffle   fries accompanied by a truffle aioli, next is the herb tossed fries paired with ketchup, finally the old bay seasoned fries are paired with a mustard sauce. The truffle seasoned fries along with the truffle aioli were the favorite. 

For salad, we ordered the BLT wedge, which was very refreshing and very leveled in flavor given the bacon, maytag bleu cheese, and buttermilk dressing. As for the main course, we ordered the 8oz. Mishima reserve rib cap and the 16oz dry-aged boneless rib eye. I must say that after trying both cuts, the cap was superb. Literally melts in your mouth, by impacting it with full of flavor. I suppose that's the benefit of a wagyu vs. angus and cap vs. rib eye. The boneless rib eye slightly lacked flavor when compared to the cap. For side, we ordered the potato gratin which comes with a smoked gouda sauce that is drizzle over and creates a bed of sauce for the gratin. 

We finished our meal with the beignets accompanied with vanilla creme brûlée. The combination is divine. I have previously tried the other two sauces, salty caramel pot de creme and butterscotch pudding, but the creme brûlée by far is the top winner and goes perfectly with the beignets. 

In all, it is not over the top expensive, but not cheap either. Hopefully, our next visit might be more pleasant with the ambiance and service. For now, I'll stick to the happy hour or dining at the bar, where service is more attentive.

One more thing, a few reviewers noted receiving complimentary popcorn at the end of their meal as a token of appreciation, I suppose none were provided that night, as we were not fortunate to receive a bag .",SmSqtDzLMOm1a8tQyvVU_Q,1,1,3,r_-8sFg8DqNqzprlY72ihA

My boyfriend ordered the Kobe Filet and I ordered the mesquite grilled scallops, both served a la carte.  Nothing special about my scallops, I could have made them at home on a mesquite grill.

We started off with the crab cake and crispy duck thigh appetizer.  I have to say neither of those were anything spectacular.   Actually, as we were eating them, I wished we had ordered something else. 

For sides, we ordered the potato puree trio and the spinach souffle.  Both, again just ok.  The spinach souffle was unique which I liked, but the potatoes were just three different kinds: horseradish, lobster, and sour cream and onion.  They also always bring out the trio of fries with the appropriate accompanying sauces and foccaccia bread as appetizers.
 
For dessert we finished off with their chocolate mousse dessert which I wish I hadn't eaten.

All I'm saying is for the hefty price of $74 for a piece of meat, you would expect everything to be amazing.

Either way, Michael Mina's STRIPSTEAK offered one of the best meals i've ever had and will forever be a MUST while in Vegas. Each meal is started off with a trio of Duck Fat Fries, compliments of the Chef. Duck Fat Fries are french fries which are fried in duck fat , seasoned three different ways and served with three dipping sauces. These are easily the best french fries i've ever had are deserving of the 5-star rating alone. 

Collectively, our group ordered the Japanese A5 Filet (market price of $95), a few orders of Salmon ($35), the American Kobe Burger ($25), and additional sides of duck fat fries and the truffled mac and cheese. While the prices are high, this is a prime example of ""you get what you pay for."" We were told that the A5 filet was flown in from Japan earlier that morning, and upon receiving it, was tender enough to cut with a fork alone.  

The Salmon, cooked and seasoned perfectly, was extremely fresh. Having eaten at places such as Neptune's Net on Pacific Coast Highway in California, I didn't think it was possible to taste a fresher tasting fish, but Stripsteak really nailed it. When served with a side of truffled Mac & Cheese, which might i add was some of the best i've had the pleasure of trying, it was truely an adventure for the taste buds.

Onto the burger. The American Kobe Burger was the least expensive of the various options. It featured a kobe beef patty cooked to a perfect medium served on a bun with fennel slaw and watercress. What was without a doubt the best burger i've ever had was served alongside a second helping of the succulent duck fat fries I had experienced at the beginning of our meal. 

Overall, i was very pleased with the meal as well as the amazing service and I didn't hear a single complaint in our party except regarding the price. But like I mentioned earlier, ""you get what you pay for."" Unless of course you were the one ordering the $95 A5 filet...

I lost count of the number of staff who wished him a happy birthday, from the hostess when we arrived, to the hostess when we left, and all manner of staff before, during and after the meal.  And there was the Happy Birthday card on the table, and the tiny dessert with a birthday candle at the end.

We started with the amuse-bouche Fries - three kittle cups with different seasonings with three paired dips.  I'm not a Fry Freak, but I have to admit I just couldn't stop, even with all the salt (I'm giving up on complaining about salt, which is just too pervasive in restaurants).

Both of us ordered the NY Strip, and it was good enough to make me a meat eater.  Perfectly cooked.  Juicy.  Tender.  We ordered Asparagus in Horseradish Beurre Blanc and the Truffled Mac & Cheese as our sides.  The asparagus was fabulous.  But the Mac & Cheese, which they're famous for, was just too rich for my taste.  I know I would've been happier with the Scalloped Potatoes, but hubby wanted to try the Mac, and it was his birthday, so...  Besides, I was too full from the complimentary fries to even get through the steak, so it was no problem to eschew (pun intended) the macaroni.

The service was terrific - not elegant, because this is a casual place, and that's just the way I like it.

My one nit-let about this very stylish space is the chairs.  They're very comfy, upholstered arm chairs.  But the arms are as high as the table tops, so I couldn't sit as close to the table as I like.  It made the comfortable seating a bit uncomfortable for Petite Moi.

First, when entree' items are over $50 I expect an elegant decor and atmosphere.  I felt like we were in a cafe' and not in a first class restaurant. 
For starters we had their fries and a hamachi appetizer.  Both had excellent flavors but TOO MUCH SALT.  I called the waiter over and said. ""I can tell by the starters, that your chef is a little heavy handed with the salt.  Please tell him no added salt on my chicken""  Unfortunately the chicken was salty too.   
The cardinal rule in chicken is don't overcook to dryness.  In an effort to not cross that line,  the chicken was just a FRACTION undercooked.  Slightly PINK meat. A little less salt and 2 more minutes cooking and this flavorful chicken would have been PERFECT. 
the sides of truffle mac n' cheese, mushrooms and cream corn were all good, but not spectacular. 
Rick had the Kansas steak.  cooked nicely and fresh and flavorful.  However I overheard both parties on either side of us complaining that their steak was overcooked to their order.

I enjoyed my first experience at Stripsteak.  We enjoyed an early dinner on a Thursday evening.  The place was empty and our server was extremely friendly and attentive.  We had a $25 gift cert thanks to Restaurant.com, but I think every dollar spent is well worth it!

I ordered the  18oz dry-aged bone-in rib eye ($52) cooked 'medium' and my boyfriend ordered the 16oz Kansas City strip ($46) cooked 'medium rare'.  Both steaks were prepared superbly.  The rib eye was juicy and tender with each bite.  The strip was just as juicy and much more tender to the bite.  They were both well seasoned and we savored each bite.

For sides, we ordered the scalloped potatoes ($12) and truffle mac & cheese ($12).  The scalloped potatoes just slightly more than ordinary... it was the chipotle that gave it an extra oomph and why I enjoyed it.  But the mac & cheese.... o.m.g.... I'm biased... b'coz I.LOVE.MAC.AND.CHEESE.  So, you might want to rule my opinion out.  The truffle mac & cheese was perfectly creamy and cheesy and truffley... pure decadence.

We were also given a complimentary platter of 3 types of french fries with 3 dipping sauces.  The fries prepared in duck fat were my fav... along with the garlic aoli sauce!!

1) Hot sweaty dance floor action 

2) Titties at the Rhino 

3) A big fat juicy piece of meat from Stripsteak

As far as the steaks go, my personal recommendation would be to get the 18 ounce dry aged bone-in ribeye ($52).  Its fatty, flavorful, and absolutely satisfying, but If that's not enough for you, Stripsteak also offers a much larger 30oz Porterhouse ($69). And for those who want a little slice of heaven you can opt for the 12 oz gold label kobe steak for a whopping $85.  Might as well right...

And we all know that no steak dinner is complete without a few sides.  My faves include teh the scalloped potatoes and the truffled mac and cheese.  I would say that one side per person is about right, but keep in mind that they do send over complimentary duck fat fries to get the juices flowing while you wait for you steak.

If you're in a rush and want your steak pronto let them know you have to catch a show and they'll throw that sucker on the grill and have it ready for you in no time. Oh and before you head over to Mandalay make sure to hit up restaurant.com for a $50 gift certificate.  

Below I have also included some eating instructions for you.

As soon as your steak arrives please take the following steps to ensure maximum satisfaction. 
 
1. cut your steak one bite at a time 

2. do not stop eating until you have finished you entire steak (fat included)

3. once you finish your steak begin to eat the steak off of your dining companions plates.

4. If they resist stab them in the neck with your knife then proceed to eat their steak as they bleed out.",Jy7BwojX8fRcq14_Lmigcg,15,15,4,HUlruORJJqgYVPpM0heKUg

I've never really had that reaction here.  10 oz filet mignon was $59.  It was cooked on the rare side of medium rare and it's lightly seasoned.  While it came out to the table medium hot, it really didn't stay hot for very long.  I much prefer the hot plates at Mastro's and Ruth's Chris.   Our server was friendly so that's a big plus. 

We used a $50 restaurant.com certificate which took $50 off of $100.  Dinner for 2 without alcohol was still $150 after tax and tip.

This place would have received a 5 but the night started off rocky. 

First it was the bitchy hostess. Seriously honey, you aren't that pretty and that tat on your tit just makes you look cheap. I understand that it was a little bit late but you're a hostess, isn't it your job to at least be pleasant when greeting guests?

Even though the service started out crappy, the food made up for it. First it was the free duck fries. I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking ew.. duck fries. It's not really duck, just regular ol' french fries with a new name. The condiments it came with however, nothing close to regular. I remember it was 3 types of condiments, forgot the flavors but remember it being delicious. I think I ended up fighting with my date on who could have the last duck fry. 

The steak..MMMM...mouth watering. *Insert picture of Homer Simpson drooling* I had a petite filet and loved it. My date on the other hand, had Kobe steak. I had a piece of his steak and had entree envy right away. His Kobe beef was exactly how Kobe beef should taste like, tender and full of flavor.

You would think after pigging out on fries and steak, that we would be done right? WRONG. We decide to order blueberry fritters for dessert. My God were they delicious. Even though I was dying from over eating I couldn't help wanting more. 

We won't discuss the bill. I just know it was expensive. =X

We decided to go to StripSteak because they were staying at Mandalay Bay so he made reservations for us plus his coworkers family.  The restaurant itself is very modern and ambience is comfortable.  They had large open windows showing the dry aging process for the steak and jars along the wall that looked like picked vegetables.  The staff was welcoming and seemed very knowledgeable.  They even had a sommelier that helps you order wine that best fits your tastes and food order.  

We ordered the yellowtail sashimi, instant bacon, and the crispy rice poppers for appetizers and a bottle of pinot noir to start.  The sashimi was so good we asked for a few more orders.  It's also beautifully plated with the cucumbers, peppers and yuzu ponzu sauce and the flavors just work so well together.  The crispy rice poppers were just okay, but my dad compared the crispy rice to a hashbrown.  I didn't care for the flavors on the pork belly, but it was really tender.  

For our main course, everyone ordered their choice of a steak and we shared the potato gratin, creamed spinach, broccolini, and mac & cheese.  I ordered the Mishima Wagyu filet mignon and it came plated with a bite of cornbread with some spicy honey.  The sides were all pretty standard and tasty.  There was so much cheese everywhere which I loved.  The steak was just average and the reason for the low rating.  I ordered mine medium rare because I love having the inside of the steak softer and juicier, but it was really dry and kind of hard to eat.  I think it may have been too overdone so I lost a lot of the flavor I love in tender filet mignons.  I could tell my dad didn't enjoy his either because he only ate about a quarter of his steak, which never really happens.

The restuarant itself is not set up how I would personally like- it seems sparse and tables/settings were plain to the point of feeling cold.

I ordered al a carte and has the Foie Gras sliders to start. Great little sliders with a generous amount of sweetness from peach preserves and the foie was perfectly cooked. For my main I had the American wagyu ribeye cap. This steak was fatty and delightful in only the way waguy can be. It blew my mind and while I think of myself as an accomplished steak eater, this 8oz portion was nearly too much. Its richness and lush flavor was enhanced by the way stripsteak cooked it. For a side, we shared their mashed potatoes- three ways. They were extremely rich, but oh so good! 

My better half enjoyed the 3-course predetermined menu. He had no complaints other than his truffled mac and cheese was much too truffle-y, which I agreed. 

Stripsteak is pretty typical Las Vegas steakhouse. No real surprises, but they provide consistent high caliber steaks night after night. The prices are high and there's no way to get around that. If you dine there, I recommend splurging on American kobe.

I came here with a group for dinner without reservations. They were booked solid but thought they may have a cancellation so called the party to see if they could release the table for us. This level of service continued all night. 

After being stayed we were brought our drinks with plenty of recommendations from our waitress. This was soon followed by complimentary French fries, fried in duck fat. On top of that they were seasoned with old Bay, black truffle or an herb blend. Best fries ever. 

I next had a BLT lettuce wedge. It came with thick cut bacon and large chunks of blue cheese. It was good but at the end of the day it was a chunk of lettuce for $18. 

The real star was the steak, as it should be. I got the house specialty, the Wagyu Rib Cap cooked to a chef recommended and perfect medium rare. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The flavor was off the charts and the Fois gras butter just took the whole thing to another level. I can't remember ever having a better steak.

The tomato soup is pretty good. It definitely has the heirloom tomato taste so the the soup is a little bitter. The lobster grilled cheese triangles are small, but tasty.

My date ordered the fried chicken, but was bummed to find out that they only fry it for parties or 2 or more. Single fried chicken eaters have to opt for the grilled breasts instead. The truffle mac and cheese was just fair.

Nobody however wanted to leave the hotel, so we decided on shall I say THEY decided on ""stripsteak"" at Mandalay Bay.  I tried hard to talk them out of this as I had eaten here about 2 years ago with 8 people and it was absolutely horrible, but they insisted. With that said I am very happy they talked me out of it as this experience was completely different from our previous visit.

1st off ambiance wise you can't beat the place. Very trendy yet elegant. Service staff spot on. Complimentary Appetizer - Trio of Duck Fat Fries
Each meal is preceded by a complimentary order of the trio of duck fat fries.  The trio includes:

1.  Paprika and mustard fries accompanied with a mustard crème dip
2. Truffle fries accompanied with truffle aïoli dip
3. Rosemary and onion fries accompanied with onion ketchup dip
The Truffle fries great and the best of the 3 but nice touch instead of the regular bread & Butter. 

Onward we go. Glasses of wine ordered as nobody wanted the same thing, and a bit pricey per glass but nice selection. 

3 of us tonight so it was 3 Steaks and two sides I'll keep it simple.

A: KC Bone in NY Strip Charred medium. (Cooked to perfection)Tasty, moist, juicy, a 10 on the steak scale.

B: Bone in Rib Eye Charred Medium (See above Perfection)

C.  Slow poached prime rib perhaps the weakest of the 3 but still very good, not as thick as I would have preferred if I was ordering it.

Sides Truffle Mac & Cheese & Bacon Cream Spinach

Spinach ""GREAT"" simply stated

Truffle Mac & Cheese Great except for one thing, no mention of broccoli in this dish yet it had pieces of it and I hate broccoli. Taste was exceptional aside from the unwanted greens.

No Deserts...  A quick meal with excellent service, super food in great ambiance..  Won a few bucks at the dice table afterwards to pay for this thing....",ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,0,0,4,ppfB7z38oP-MZEnYnqcNuw

The bad:

What's wrong with that combination? Steak... good! Strippers... good! In a fantasy world, such a place would exist. Unfortunately, that was not the case. At least they had great steak and that more than made up for the lack of strippers.  Turns out the strip in Strip Steak was because the restaurant was located in the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Ooooh. I get it.
What makes Strip Steak special is not strippers but how they cook their steaks. From what I understood from the waitress, they braise their steaks to the proper doneness and then finish them over an open flame for color. A boiled steak? Don't knock it till you try it. Seriously the third best steak I've ever had. The number one spot goes to a Kobe Steak I had in Tokyo.

The only thing Strip Steak could improve on is if they offered more dry aged cuts of steak. At the time of this post, they only offered their Rib Eye dry aged. Our group ordered our steaks in a variety of doneness. One in our group got them to cook a steak the rarest the restaurant has ever cooked it. They've only done it one other time since they opened. Talk about an accomplishment, to be the second person to have a steak this rare. They are on the strip after all. Instead of par boiling the steak, they pulled it straight out of the fridge, quickly placed over the flame, and served it. To our surprise, there wasn't even a drop of blood on the plate. 

The next time I go, I'll try the $200 Japanese Kobe 6oz filet mignon, but unfortunately, I ""donated"" that money to ""Red 14"". Any steak on the menu will definitely please your palate. One of our group suggests the lamb. Not gamey at all.",0QRMOUgGEeLssaNh1gwGjQ,0,0,5,CKlTr3lK9q2w6IvgUh7cGg

In the end, what really annoyed me was the waiter.  I sort of knew what to order already but wanted confirmation from him.  I went about every item with an inquisitive stance and he kept saying ""amazing,"" ""the best,"" ""great choice,"" etc.  I guess that is his job to not only hype up but also support his employer.  Personally speaking, I would be embarrassed if I were him because almost every dish was terrible and that is not an exaggeration.  The guy disappeared on us for long stretches.  He wasn't attentive and his smug attitude just got to me.  The best item was probably the duck fat fries, which happened to be free, thanks.  Here was the order:

Appetizers:
- Oysters - weren't terrible but I have had way better
- Hamachi Sashimi - the WORST I have EVER had; it was pure MUSH without any texture;  it literally melted and broke apart in your mouth but in the opposite way you would expect if you had good or even decent sashimi before

Entrees:
- Wagyu Filet - GF ordered medium, and it came out almost rare; maybe it was an honest mistake but other steakhouses would have replaced the entire steak and not have recooked it, which took about 15 minutes
- Wagyu Rib Cap - I really don't think this was wagyu.  It tasted like a normal steak.  With every successive bite, I was waiting for that strong hit and it never came

Sides (smallest sides I have ever received at a steakhouse; are they trying to be cute?):
- Spinach Souffle - presentation was cool but tasted so plain
- Mac and Cheese - truffle was nonexistent;  COME ON, you couldn't make the portion size bigger for MAC AND CHEESE?  It came out in a little teacup, truly pathetic.

Dessert:
- not even worth mentioning

The experience was poor.  The ambiance was extremely plain.  Contemporary maybe - but nothing popped out.  I felt like I was just eating in a room.  For a $240 bill, excluding tip and without alcohol, I was disappointed to say the least.  I was disappointed that I went out of my way from Encore to Mandalay Bay to eat this overpriced, tasteless, and possibly unauthentic food.  Maybe there is a trend happening for Michael Mina's restaurants.  They start off good and then slowly dissipate.  The same thing happened to one of his restaurants on the Sunset strip.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was the next victim.  I kept saying to myself ""the next one has got to be better.""  Hope is not a strategy, sorry.  For what I was expecting and what I received, I could be generous and have given 2 stars.  Then again, I would be dishonest with myself.

At least that has been our experience, and we've had amazing food and beautiful ambiance for substantially less. Here's what we were turned off by:

1. From what we could see, there was one server tending to about 15 tables on a Saturday night. I looked over and saw her running around to all these tables and it felt oddly IHOP-esque. She came to our table way less frequently than she should have at a restaurant of this quality.

2. It took 45 MINUTES for our steak to come out. I mean, my wife and I were talking and enjoying the conversation, but it came a point where we looked at each other and called the server over.

3. $89 for a small piece of steak, which came with a thumb sized piece of cornbread and about a half ounce of honey. No pretty garnish or anything on the plate.

4. I thought maybe we were being critical, but my wife went to the bathroom (only one stall, apparently, so she had to wait outside), and she struck up conversation with a couple other people who had nearly identical criticisms.

So after I took my girlfriend to a show, I wanted to treat her to a nice dinner.  And this was the closest steakhouse near the show.

This place may be the best steak that I had ever tasted.  I ordered the ribeye which was very tender and seasoned to perfection. They did not overbutter their steaks like some other nice steakhouses.  

Also, they give you fries as instead of bread.  The fries are seasoned differently with various different dipping sauces.  I dont know if they do this anymore, but they did do this when I was here last. 

The decor is typical of a fancy steak house, but I love the fact that they have some cuts of meat on display on windows.

Drawback of course is the price, but hey, what do you expect..it is a fancy steakhouse.

Been there so many times and pretty much had everything on the menu. I like the american kobe better then the Japanese (too rich). AK has a better texture and the flavor is more balance. The Japanese ones are worth a try (you can cut the meat with your fork) because its better then what other steak houses offers. The caviar is also awesome but pricey but if you looking at it you most likely have a host that will comp it. The duck fat frys does nothing for me.

4973803,2009-09-04,6,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"My 700th review goes toward a night of decadent eating!

Parties of four are really one of the best ways to experience a menu.  With drinks in hand, we took our seats at a table by the floor-to-ceiling glass walls separating us from the outside world.

* Trio of Duck Fat fries with dipping sauces of barbecue, truffle aioli, and ketchup - This complimentary dish was the first to arrive, and yes, they are very delicious and decadent, and oh so good and fatty.  A great way to start any meal!

* Potato Focaccia - More complimentary stuff to get your palate going, although I found to be just okay, the Husband enjoyed it more. 

* Maine Lobster ""bacon-wrapped fritters"" ($17) - Skewered lobster with bacon wrapped around, and then deep-fried.  A refreshing dipping sauce to cut the fat!

* Roasted Beets ""burrata, walnut oil"" ($15) - The fresh Italian cheese, greens, and beets had the three men at my table fighting over the last bits.

* Filet Tartare ""american kobe filet, classic garnish, grilled pocket bread"" ($21) - Beautifully presented with the rare beef and a raw quail egg resting on top.  Garnishments of mustard, cracked pepper, red onions and the like surrounded it before the waiter artfully mixed it all together and presented it in chilled glass.  So tastefully good, you don't need or want the bread.  

* Shabu Shabu ""american kobe beef, mushroom consomme"" ($24) - A pot of hot broth took center stage as enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef arrived.  A quick swish and a dip of sauce and into your mouth it goes.

* Angus Beef Cap ($46) - We all ordered this off-menu cut of beef.  I initially wanted it rare, but was dissuaded to have it medium rare instead.  Cutting into my beef, it was more medium and I was saddened.  A quick glance around the table, and I realized my piece was definitely more cooked than most.  Lucky for me, the Husband was willing to switch his piece with mine.  (That act alone makes him a keeper!)  Once I cut into my newly acquired beef, I was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  

* Mac & Cheese ""truffled"" ($12) - Yes, it's all that and a bag of chips.  So creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it's all over! So yum!  Worth ordering on its own.

* Scalloped Potatoes ""caramelized onion & goat cheese"" ($12) - The onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  

* Potato Puree Trio ""lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish"" ($14) - My personal fave over the other potato dish.  With so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  Very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.

* Creamed Corn ""jalapeno"" - I guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  A slight bit of heat from the pepper and it's more creamy goodness.

* Beignets ""Chocolate Pot de Creme, Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, Madagascar Vanilla Creme Brulee"" - Take a spoon to the crème brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  Dipping wise, I liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.

* Coconut Candy Bar ""Caramel Ice Cream, Toasted Almonds"" ($12) - A very fancy candy bar that's super sweet, and perfect for sharing.

* Cucumber Martini - Surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.

* Cherry Caiprihana - The Husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.

The service at Strip Steak was probably among the best.  There's a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  One of the more personal and better customer service experiences I've had in awhile.  Michael Mina obviously knows what he's doing with his food and his staff.  It's no wonder there's a cult following of his restaurants.  They also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch. (Most restaurants in the casinos don't have their own restrooms, so you're forced to walk through the casino to use it.)  But there can be a line, which is the downfall of it.

My suggestion is to gather a few friends, and only a few, and share a wonderful meal with them all.  With a party of five or more, it's harder to share the appetizers and sides.  You'll share an intimate culinary adventure with them!

So we tried Michael Mina's StripSteak. My dining guest said Mina's name like I should know it, I think he has a restaurant in San Francisco too.

First, the Rare Ahi, Nioise Garnish was just simple with simple seasoning that was perfect. I got the Prime Rib rare to check to see if they could do it right, because most place's rare prime rib is just not done slow enough and if not over done it is still just tough. I was very impress. And the Brussels sprouts we ordered was prepared all sliced up like cole slaw, we were both impressed. The lobster was cut in half long ways so it was no work at all to eat lobster. It was marked as market priced on the menu and we both bet to see who came close. I bet $50 and my friend said $60, it came to $74 but we both said it was seasoned well and was worth it, believe it  or not.

Don't get me wrong.  The service is beyond excellent.  We were well taken care of and our table was checked in on every ten minutes or so to make sure we were comfortable.

The fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=aA_po75wwNmG17nAJRbA-w) are really, really good.  So good that it may have overshadowed the rest of the dishes.  And, they're free!

I had the Kansas strip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=FBhiB59p-kaGZlbKi7adQw).  It's a really intimidating piece of meat, 14 oz in all.  Good thing I took the rest to go and it was still fine the next morning.  The texture was a bit too chewy for my taste...but I would have gotten yelled at if I ordered the prime rib at a steak house.

The 16 oz bone-in rib eye (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=V7XFHkvuJnnrXErP7T0JCw) was good, too.  Maybe even better than the Kansas strip.

The creamed spinach (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w?select=-kT8S3f8RYyMTk4hpmD-qg) was a good complement to our steaks.

We were very familiar with Michael Mina's steakhouse concept having enjoyed his Bourbon Steak, one of our favorite places in DC, on multiple occasions.  As a result, we had high expectations for Stripsteak.  Stripsteak occupies an open, modern-looking, high-ceilinged, well-lit space along Restaurant Row in Mandalay Bay.  Since we had early reservations at 6pm, the dining room was virtually empty except for us.  Given that we practically had the place to ourselves, the service was solid and our food came out expeditiously, hot and fresh throughout our meal.

Our meal started out with Mina's signature amuse of Duck Fat Fries with a trio of dipping sauces.  The fries were hot and crispy.  They were a nice prelude to our meal, but still...just fries.  Stripsteak's strength is in its wood-fire grilled proteins.  I had the 8 oz. American Wagyu Rib Cap, medium rare.  My rib cap came out cooked precisely to my requested doneness, seasoned with restraint with only salt and pepper, was fork tender, and was, not unexpectedly, wonderfully juicy and flavorful.  It was the perfect treatment of this treasured cut of meat.  We shared orders of the Roasted Wild Mushrooms and Mac & Cheese with black truffle sides.  The mushrooms, a mix of maitake, oyster, and possibly another variety, were earthy, tender, and possessed subtle smoky notes from the wood-fire roasting.  The mac & cheese possessed distinct but balanced truffle flavor.  It was a solid and enjoyable upscale rendition of a comfort food staple.

Stripsteak served up an excellent meal that lived up to our expectations.  As steak joints go, it held its own with Las Vegas' best steakhouses.

It pains me to give 2 stars... and the only reason is the service. My husband and I had been here 4 years prior with 4 friends and had the best meal of our LIVES to date. The food was beyond perfect, we had 5 servers attending to our table... so when we decided to elope this month in Vegas and were deciding on where to have our wedding dinner with our 7 friends who attended the wedding- we knew right away Stripsteak. I talked this restaurant up to my friends for weeks leading to the day, we were all so excited. We arrived for our reso to a VERY busy restaurant ( it was a Tuesday at 7:15pm), there was a cute card on the table that said Congratulations and was signed by all the servers. Then it started going downhill... drinks took forever to come from the bar, two of them were completely wrong, the server mixed up my friends and my wine. The server seemed to have a hard time reading the computer in the dark. Dinner felt very rushed. The food was as fantastic as I remembered it from my previous experience. Then it came time for the bill and I asked our server if it was possible to split the check, I explicitly said "" If it is in ANY way difficult, don't worry we will figure it our amongst ourselves."" He said No, it shouldn't be hard, it may take 10 minutes. So I said OK let's split the bill. FORTY-FIVE minutes later, 3 of my friends were still waiting to pay their bills because there were so many mistakes on them and the manager had to come and help the server. Now I was a server for 8 years... it is not rocket science to split up a check. 

Over all we were disappointed, as our dinner ran so late we had very little time to spend down on Freemont Street. Considering our table spent over $2,000 I was not impressed how it was handled by the server or management.

I had the chicken ($39), which left me unimpressed, as it was rather bland, and my husband had the wagyu filet ($83) that while he very much enjoyed, couldn't say it was the best he'd ever had (though by far the most expensive). The potatoes au gratin are a must, probably the best thing they have besides that tiny square of instant bacon they serve.

App: 
Trio of duck fat fries with different sauces was pretty darn tasty. Similar to how McDonalds fries are tasty, and onion rings, and wings, basically anything fried.  

Dad wanted sashimi (at a steak restaurant?), I knew it was going to be bad, but he couldn't be unconvinced- TOTALLY GROSS, do not order this.
Albacore sashimi?? Keep that stuff in the can plz.

I got a roasted beet salad, which I expected to be a little more rustic... but they kind of tasted like canned beets.  And too much of the white cheese! 

Ordered the truffled mac and cheese after being convinced by the waiter...
only OK, not blown away and couldn't really taste whatever was truffled.  I think they use the word truffle as a license to charge and extra $5. :/

My dry aged steak was pretty damn good, which I would have been pissed if it wasn't for $60.  

My dad's waygu tip steak thing was also tender and delicious. 

Brothers pork and collards with grits was only ok. Not too much flavor.

5056673,2012-09-14,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"One quote says it all ""The Waygu Rib Cap was the best steak I have ever had!"". This was from my Dad after we finnished dinner last Tuesday night. 

Everything was perfection. We started with the complimentary duck fat fries. Each type had it's own mouthwatering flavors, but my Dad's favorite was the truffle, while mine was the Old Bay Seasoning with the herb sauce. YUM. 

We also ordered the fresh oysters. We were given the choice of east or west coast, and we chose the smaller, sweeter Kusshi oysters from the west. They were perfect. The minuet sauce was fresh and paired with they perfectly. We then split a caesar salad. I loved their dressing and how it came with a anchovie on the side. 

Onto the STEAK. Which is why you really need to come here in the first place. Like I said, he ordered the Waygu Rib Cap, which if you read the other reviews is amazing. It's rich and full of flavor. It's Waygu, so expect it to be a little fatty (but a GOOD, full of FLAVOR fatty). I ordered the Filet, which was cooked just the way I like it. Both were medium rare. The rib cap had a nice charred crust on it which is another sign that it was cooked properly. 

THE SIDES - oh the sides! We ordered the trio of potato puree. Horseradish, Lobster, and Sour Cream & Onion. My favorite was the horseradish becasue it think it pairs well with the meat. His favorite was the lobster with nice big chunks of loster in it. Basically to die for. We also had the creamed spinach which was another favorite. 

Honestly I can't say a bad thing about this meal. We finnsihed off a bottle of wine between the two of us. Yes it's expensive, but a nice steakhouse in Vegas SHOULD be expensive! It's all about the service, amazing food, and atmosphere.

So, in a place where our meal for four (with their 3 course special and a bottle of wine) cost $400 it took an hour and a half to eat.  The place was not full and we saw our waiter only about 4 times throughout that hour and a half.  We did complain to the manager who comped part of our meal, although she seemed to think the wait was not excessive.  The food was also not up to par for the cost.  Two people ordered the rib-eye and both were disappointed.  The other two ordered the filet mignon which was much better. I can only afford places this expensive occasionally, but I have been to several others at the same price point and quality/service was exceptional.  So, I would not return here.

First night I was not very hungry so just had a nice pour of wine and a couple appetizers, which were quite tasty (Shabu Shabu and Hamachi sashimi) but everyone else at the table was raving about their entrees. 

So I went back with my team the next day and had the Kobe Rib Cap steak, perfectly crispy outside and rare inside and it was bar none the finest, richest little cut of meat I can recall!  Top that off with the Spinach Souffle (so fresh and what an interesting texture!) and the mashed Brussels Sprouts with a nice buttery/peppery twang. They brought out some Duck Fries just for fun and they were great especially with the truffle dip.

The restaurant unfortunately was Stripsteak. The restaurant itself is nice and seated us immediately upon arrival. The server was quick and responsive. The problems began whenwe ordered. There were a number of items including baked potatoes that were not available this evening. This had to be a major faux pas on the part of the order department but totally affected our view of the place. They must have used up all their potatoes making French fries because that was what they bring in lieu of bread. Their special this evening was prime rib encrusted with a horseradish mix. This my wife ordered the special and it was way below par perhaps being the worst prime rib she has ever had. Nothing to do with the mix, the food was bland and hard to eat. The steak I had was good though. We had Brussels sprouts, which were sliced and blended with bacon, which was tasty. The potato scarcity coupled with the tasteless prime rib assured that we would not be back to this restaurant. A steakhouse with out baked potatoes is just not right. I say dressy in how one should show up but that usually does not happen anymore. Some of our fellow diners were dressed up while others were in sandals and shorts. The short of it is this is a restaurant in a resort and really does not have to live up to any expectations. The management definitely is aware of this fact.

5087516,2009-06-21,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I loved this place. This place ""was. an. experience."" It's a surprisingly chic place not far from Fleur de Lys in Mandalay Bay and right next to a Starbucks. It was packed and loud, so I guess that's a good sign. 
To be honest, I wasn't impressed with our waiter. He seemed like a casual Billy Corgan type who was interested in talking to you so long as you were increasing your order. No small talk, 0 personality, and the real piss ant is he conveniently didn't add our restaurant.com coupon to our bill. He may have forgotten, but frankly this is the second time this has happened to me in Vegas, and seeing how just about every other attraction in Vegas is designed to suck the money out of your pocket I can't help but wonder if it's not a coincidence. They must slip more than a few bills under the noses of patrons who unknowingly assume they got their discount but fail to check after a bottle of wine, but not me, and I'm not too forgiving about this ether, because I think it really is intentional. 
Anyway, the food is what saved this place from a more negative review because in the end that is all I really and truly care about anyway. Anyone can learn how to carry a plate of food to a table, but it takes a talented individual to craft a work of art in the kitchen. 
We had salad to start. Frankly I wasn't impressed with my caesar.  It seemed a bit bland. I was hoping this wouldn't be precursor to the rest of the meal but in this rare occasion it wasn't at all. Salad must not be their thing because the rest of the meal was mind blowing. I had a regular filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and another side of the creamed corn. Ummmm....the food was utterly fantastic. The filet was of EXCELLENT quality. Perfect taste and texture throughout, and the accompanying pepper sauce was not a creamy peppercorn sauce like you usually get, but more of a demi glace sauce with peppercorns - truly the sauce I have been after for years.
The sides of the mashed potatoes 3 ways was stunning. They serve 3 little bowls of mashed taters. One is sour cream and chives infused, the other is lobster infused, and the third is horseradish infused. Each was the creamiest, smoothest mashed potato I have ever had, and was accented perfectly with its character ingredient. Wow. With the steak it was just superb. The creamed corn with jalapeno was very good, although not the best ever. Still very nicely done though and no complaints.
To top it off, and the reason this place is a solid 5 star experience and worthy of one of the most smitten reviews I have ever posted was the simple divine experience I had with the Executive Chef, Ben (lost his business card but remember his name).
I was walking out of the restroom, and stopped by to look at their see-through window next to the grill where they cook the steaks and other entrees. I noticed what seemed to be a chef standing nearby, so in a spontaneous moment of gratitude I went up to him and told him how much I enjoyed my food. He was very nice, and after I asked a few more questions about how the steak is prepared, he said ""come on, I'll take you back."" He actually took me back in the kitchen past all the kitchen staff who were probably thinking ""WTF is this guy doing in here?"", and took me straight up to the grill where a few beautiful steaks were in the home stretch. He explained the process, how the steaks actually soak in clarified butter at a perfectly controlled temperature before they are grilled. This would explain the awesomeness of the steak, actually, but now that I've tasted it I know that it's the best. He enthusiastically answered my other questions about the kitchen (""is it really like Hell's Kitchen??"") and then ushered me out of the kitchen. I don't know why this is such a big deal to me, but it really just impressed the heck out of me that the Executive Chef of one of the best restaurants I'd ever been to was so down to Earth and gave me an impromptu tour of his kitchen. I remember as a young boy my dad would approach the cockpits of planes even during flights sometimes to talk to the pilots, and they would bring us into the cockpit, explain a few neat things, and then with a wink we'd be on our way. Obviously those days are gone forever, but tonight I had a bit of the same feeling; the man running the ship gave me the tour with no expectation of anything in return. Clearly I don't believe this kind of thing happens that much anymore and that's why I'm so ecstatic, but it was a privilege and an honor to meet him and I cannot thank him enough for his exemplary skills as both a chef and a business man. 
I'm a fan of Strip Steak for sure. Maybe next time if I win big in Vegas I'll try the Japanese Kobe (it's not cheap). Until then I'll enjoy a superb domestic cut of beef and be glad I can afford the luxury.",XZ7gWj4cIbFJOhG03lYY7w,0,0,5,SDLwo0G4W7VY7MZLZ2-thw

I made a reservation for a party of 15 for a birthday dinner and we arrived 15 prior to the reservation.  Waited 30 minutes after the reserved time then waited 20 minutes to order plus another hour for waiting for our entrees. Spent $110 on porterhouse and it was dry, overcooked & flavorless.  Some steaks were missing standard baby carrots and bulb onions on the plate.  The steak- the $110 porterhouse was lukewarm and felt like it's been sitting under the warmer.

The service was another story. My friends felt like he wasn't friendly or attentive enough considering we do expect steakhouse service.  However, I did feel like he was friendly inside but just not with a smile on his face. It felt like he didn't want to serve us.  When I mentioned to him about my disappointing porterhouse, he did comp my dessert which was a nice touch but still couldn't make it for the whole experience.

Yet another 2.5 years from my previous review.  Yet another dozen visits in that time.  StripSteak continues to evolve and prove its dominance as one of Vegas' top steakhouses.

This is a steakhouse so starting with the steaks.  Japanese A5 is back.  Although the brand is not specified, one slice into the heavily marbled beef (if ordered simply seared and raw on the inside) showcases its classic, deeply marbled, gentle beefy flavor, and melting sweet fat.  As good as it gets and at $35/oz, well worth it.  Tip:  Do not order more than 6oz.  The richness will fill you up very fast.

Up next, the American Mishima wagyu.  Running A3 - A4 quality, these steaks are tender with a more pronounced beef flavor.  The fat is nowhere near as sweet as the A5 but still plenty good.  Opt for the rib cap if available.  It has the deepest beef flavor and is by far the most delicious.

An Australian wagyu offered as a tomahawk is very good.  To be shared (even if the bartender tries to tell you you can eat it by yourself - eyes bigger than stomach - epic fail).  A step down in tenderness but if beefy flavor is what you want, good balance.

Finally the angus beef.  If you love American style beefy flavors, it's ahrd to pass on the UDSA prime flat iron.  A true butchers cut.  Packs mineral, beefy flavors.  Good chew and nicely integrated fat.

All steaks (except the A5) have a very good sear, cooked to temp, with a very even core.

Sauces and toppings if you must; foie gras butter is liquid crack.  Talk about richness with the distinct livery flavor of the foie.  Pairs beautifully with the bitterness from the wood burning grill.  Note:  do not add this to the Japanese A5 unless you want a heart attack.

Sides are meant to be shared.  Do not pass on the truffle mac and cheese, baked potato with bacon marmalade, or bone marrow topped with a matsutake chimichurri (the tiny bits of matsutake add an unmistakable umame finish).

Bouncing back to starters, three true standouts, the Mina classic foie with roasted pineapple, brioche, coconut milk and macadamia nuts, the braised oxtail French Onion soup, and the steakhouse staple, classic wagyu filet tartare.  All taste as good as they read.

Service is practiced and polished.  Very knowledgable.  Steakhouse friendly.

The wine program remains strong though somewhat lacking in vintage depth.  Many great choices.  Vegas resort pricing.

Raising the bar once again for the top tier steakhouses in Vegas.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,21,20,5,yCkGvTghXx0MwV-ukKeeGA

Atmosphere is nice, up-scale, and very open.  You get a nice little view of the kitchen without it being a spectacle.  As I said the service was excellent.  The sommelier was friendly and helpful, and just added to the experience.  Our waiter was attentive, friendly, sociable and just helped make the meal that much better.

They start things off with some french fries that are cooked in duck fat.  They were light, crispy and very tasty.  You get three varieties which I believe were garlic herb, truffle and chipotle each paired with dipping sauces.  It's nice to see a restaurant take something simple and class it up a bit.

For an appetizer I had the bacon-wrapped lobster fritters.  I already knew that bacon makes everything taste better but I didn't know it could make lobster taste that much better.

My date had the spinach souffle with parmesan cream which she absolutely loved.  I had the bone-in rib-eye which was absolutely excellent.  The steaks here a first poached in butter and then cooked over a wood-burning grill.  I hadn't had steak prepared in this manner before but it was excellent, one of the more memorable steaks I've ever had.

We actually stopped in for the Happy Hour which turned out to be a great deal. From 4-7pm all the apps were 1/2 off and beers were $3. 

Over the two days I ordered, split, and/or tried the following: Duck Fat Fries, Skirt Steak, Crab Cakes, Kobe Sliders, and Lobster Fritters. 

First off, none of them disappointed and some of them (crab cakes, and fries) I had the first night and went with again on the second. The DFF's were great. Each fry matched it's sauce perfectly. The skirt steak I will save for last. The crab cakes were the most unique I've ever had. Usually you think of a handcrafted pan sauteed cake. I have no clue how they got this crab cake so perfectly shaped (probably a mold) and so crispy but it was amazing. Not short on crab and had the right amount of of kick, great dish. Next were the Kobe Sliders. For those of you who claim you can't taste the difference between regular beef and Kobe or grass fed beef, there is a McDonald's right across the street from Mandalay. The sliders were seasoned well and the whole burger was delicious. The lobster fritters were, you guessed it, great. So very light and fluffy and a light creme fraiche to accompany it. Last and very much the best was the skirt steak. I actually didn't believe it was skirt steak because of the tenderness. I was lead to believe skirt was a very tough cut and expected it to be very chewy. Quite the contrary, this steak melted in your mouth. That, along with tasting out of this world in terms of seasoning, made this my favorite dish. 

The last thing of note was the service. A+. We had the same two bartenders serve us both nights and there were awesome. Two of the most easy going friendly dudes ever. They were right on top of things but weren't over bearing, it was almost like they could read our minds. They featured a homemade blended drink serve with one massive ice cube (apparently from a 20k ice maker) that was a blend of two different types of liquor (i asked but now forget which two) and is mixed with some fruit and other ingredients over a lengthy process and then put out in a colander sitting on a bed of ice. It runs for $14 a glass and the guys had no problem letting us try it. It tasted excellent, almost like an Orange flavor reminding me of Grand Marnier. Overall, it was enjoyable and worth the small priced compared to what it costs to get a mixed drink at every other bar, restaurant, and club in Las Vegas.",mnoe2vwouRADn97dTDkw4A,2,1,5,hj8Eqk-9BPGOYCCzkc-xVQ

I wasn't able to go to Stripsteak last time I was here but I was delighted that I got to come this past visit. It's a very little thing, but offering complimentary duck fat fries is fun and I appreciate something different. It was one of the selling points in addition to Michael Mina that attracted me here. 

Let's start with the good. The Wagyu rib cap was amazing and super tender. I'd recommend this steak hands down to anyone that dines here. The lobster fritters and wagyu satay appetizers were tasty too. They come in a set of three, which is kind of odd but maybe it goes with their theme along with the three types of fries and three dipping sauces that came with them. The Loup de Mer, which is an european seabass (skin attached), was worth ordering as well.

The not so good. I kind of wish the fries came in a more timely matter. If they came before we finished ordering, that would've been more appropriate. There were just too many different servers for our table and it just felt out of place. They had someone walking around with fries, then another person take our order, then another person who cleared our plates after the appetizers, then one of them came back to set up our table for dessert. Also, the timing of when all the food came out was out of sorts. The fries came a while after we ordered, but then it took even longer to get the appetizers out. I understand steak restaurants take a long time to get it right, but it felt inordinately long for the entrees even when the server said it was coming anytime now. I also could've went without the potato puree and spicy zuchinni side dishes, just didn't seem to put much effort here. The cuts of the zuchinni were amateurish imo.

For the price you pay here the food is not worth it - there are way too many other steak options in Las Vegas. 3/5",uAJNBvcJA2kIsGx_sSofEw,0,0,3,MUQxZq001QQirqs5I2BPKw

This establishment is an upbeat, loud, energetic type of place.  Service, is excellent.  Great teamwork, and no matter what you are ordering, service is always fast and efficient.  As a complimentary appetizer the chef provides a small sampling of the duck fat fried French fries with three amazing dipping sauces.  The perfect start to any meal here.

My problem is I am a creature of habit, and while staying at Mandalay Bay for the ETA Transact 2016 convention, Strip Steak is a typical favorite of ours and I always get the same thing.  Their NY Strip is an amazing cut of meat.  The perfect amount of marbling to give it awesome flavor.  I like my steak cooked Medium, and they hit the mark every time.  Succulent, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  Their Caesar Salad is a perfect compliment.

5229691,2015-03-22,5,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"As usual, I will go straight to the point: food was excellent, service was great, but prices.. OMG ... stratospheric. 

Let me elaborate: I long for the days (1980's actually)  when you could get amazing food, huge portions, never ending buffets (with steak, lobster, crab legs, etc.) for $5.95. Yep, those days and deals did exist. Even 5 start hotel rooms could be had for $100 a night. The casinos made their money from the gamblers, so they wanted to attract everyone with great prices on room and board. It worked... until Vegas became a hip destination for the rich, the famous and politicians. They wanted fancy food, top notch entertainment, clubs... so why not charge for that? So you have it.

Strip Steak was undoubtedly a great experience, our Wagyu steak was excellent, the potato gratin fantastic (although I still think the version served at Fleming's in Coral Gables is better), and the broccolini (it was Ok). We had a good red wine (it cost $90 ... crazy for an average red). Note that I have an issue with Wagyu meat... it costs much more than ""grass fed"" equivalent, but I can't really tell the difference. Although the price at Strip Steak was not bad ($65 for a 12oz Wagyu Skirt Steak, the one that broke all records was the Wagyu filet at Nobu in NY for $25 per Oz.. that is insane, unless it had a secret side effect like growing hair or curing ED).

But high end places in Vegas are now like Strip Steak... good to great food and service, but prices that require a credit from the casino cashier manager in order to cover the ""experience"". We were two guys, one Wagyu steak each, one side each, one bottle of wine and two deserts... $300 with tip... wow. Good thing we were on expense account, and now I have a week to come up with an excuse when the secretary questions the expense... like ""Elvis just left the building..."".

In summary: if you landed in your private jet and took the Bentley with the scantly dressed Victoria Secret's model as a chauffeur, then I'm sure you will thoroughly enjoy the food and service of Strip Steak. If you are a commoner (like me) I suggest you put it on your boss' credit card. If both scenarios are not doable, then head to downtown Vegas, they also have great places for a fraction of the cost.

But don't take me wrong: I loved the food and the service (by the way, our waitress was beautiful, sexy and very efficient.. kudos!), but I had to knock off one star due to the high price... it just doesn't make sense...sorry.

5229846,2012-02-21,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"A big group of us went for dinner the other night, and we essentially got a tasting menu of sorts.  There were a few things that were only okay, but on the whole, everything was really really good. And yes, they do a trio of french fries to start.  I've noticed Michael Mina loves doing things in threes, and this place is no different.

Duck Spring Rolls - tasty, but nothing to knock your socks off.
Kobe Filet Tartare - very tender, very good. Some of the best tartare I've had
Ahi Tuna and Hamachi Poppers - loved these.  Just little circles of crispy rice with a little bit of fish on top with some vinegar/soy sauce concoction 

I hope I'm attributing the reviews to the right meats, but was rather drunk by this point, so here goes:
Filet Mignon - very tender and flavorful, but maybe even a little over seasoned. 
Ribeye - Amazing.  Tender, flavorful, and not gussied up by a lot of seasoning.  
Strip - good, but definitely liked the other two better.  

For the sides, we had the Broccolini, Spinach, Mac & Cheese, and Potato Puree Trio.  All of them were good, but I especially liked the mac & cheese and horseradish potato.  

All in all, it came out to about $150 per person (including tip) with a bunch of wine. So yes, it is pretty expensive, but it definitely is some very good food.",K_X_4WBu00sih2oKOX7JTg,1,1,5,oicPsJxil4ZNxEmoO-MHhw

We chose to dine here to celebrate getting engaged... our last experience was so amazing I thought surely we would be in for a treat again.

We sat in the bar area again (as we did last time). There were 4 other couples dining (total of 5 tables of 2). As soon as the waitress realized we were only ordering about $200 worth of food , she gave up on our table. I ordered a martini that sat on the bar for 22 minutes before she brought it to me! Thanks for the lukewarm drink b*tch. My water was NEVER refilled until I finally had to chase her down and ask her to. She was rude, never smiled and it was obvious $200 doesn't deserve service to her. 

Kobe tartar.. stil incredible. Foie gras sliders now use peach and came served cold. I prefer my seared foie gras served warm, but I do realize room temp is considered ""good"" to some, so I can't faul them. Steak was still awesome. 

Side of mac and cheese had broccoli in it. My fiance and I hate broccoli.. seriously put that in the description if you're going to try to put gross healthy stuff in my fatty mac and cheese dish!

Luckily I still love the food.. but being completely ignored by a waitress and staring at your warm martini sitting on the bar for over 20 minutes is unacceptable.

5278840,2018-01-09,2,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Rumored to be hurting for business since the events of October 1st, visits to Aureole and Border Grill since that time showing Mandalay Bay to be perfectly safe and the Resort's dining options as good as - or better than - ever, it was for a party of three that reservations were made at Michael Mina's STRIPSTEAK on Friday evening, some minor renovations having take place since a visit in October 2016 shortly after Chef Anthony Schutz had taken over the kitchen.

At this time one of four Las Vegas Restaurants for Mina, the pending retooling of his eponymous Bellagio flagship soon to make STRIPSTEAK the eldest unchanged concept of the quartet, it was upon approaching the hostess podium that reservations were confirmed, a four-top featuring full views of both bar and grill already set with a pre-arranged tasting menu laid out in five courses.

Now a bit more open than prior, the loss of a few dividing walls and slightly brighter lights giving the space a little more flow without compromising the sleek and sexy vibe, it was shortly after seating that a waitress heavy with superlatives appeared tableside to take drink orders, an all-new General Manager soon to follow and last, but not least, Chef Schutz confirming a lack of allergies or intolerances before the evening got underway.

Arriving at 7:00pm on a Friday to find the space less than an eighth full and never eclipsing 1/4 capacity over the course of 150 minutes, a significant change compared to a pair of prior visits and particularly noteworthy as the previously loud music could barely be heard even with such a small crowd, it was with $4 glasses of Iced Tea in hand that the night expectedly began with Chef Mina's trio of Duck Fat Fries, the signature Appetizer unchanged for good reason even though the equally delicious warm Focaccia skillet has since been replaced by slightly less impressive but still good Black Olive Focaccia slices.

Presented family-style with good pacing and fresh settings for each course, the low volume seeing service improved compared to prior, it was riffing on familiar concepts that dinner began with a new preparation of STRIPSTEAK's spicy Yellowtail Tuna paired to Japanese Bayberries and cooling Coconut-Yuzu Cream, the flavor pleasant but subject to ""Strip pricing"" at about $3.50 per bite while the ""Thai Calamari Ceviche"" put a new spin on an old idea by pairing snappy Squid ribbons with shaved Carrots, Mint, Peanuts and vibrant Vinaigrette.

Progressing from lighter to heavier flavors, a third encounter with ""Instant Bacon"" no more or less impressive than prior considering the $22 price-tag for slightly more Pork Belly than typically served on one of David Chang's infamous Buns, it was once again a Cephalopod that stole the spotlight in Round 2, the Spanish Octopus cooked fork-tender despite a good bit of char amidst Potatoes, sautéed Kale and a touch of Citrus

Not partaking in the STRIPSTEAK's composed Foie Gras plate since 2014, though Mina's cadre of Chefs have never failed in preparing great Duck Liver whether hot or cold, it was alongside rounds of French Toast and Apples that Chef Schutz presented another lovely specimen seared and soaked with Barrel-aged Maple Syrup, the Bone Marrow at its side unaltered over the years and amongst the city's best when topped with smoky Chimichurri on a slice of grilled Bread

No longer offering A5 Wagyu, the decision instead made to focus on Domestic and Foreign cuts better suited for STRIPSTEAK's Butter-bath and high temperature grills, it was alongside flaky line-caught Cod on a bed of Squash 'Noodles' and Lobster that a 45-Day Dry Aged Rib Eye arrived, the thin crust and Medium-Rare center showing off a good depth of flavor while the accompanying Duck dish explored Breast, Leg and Offal atop toothsome Forbidden Rice with Pomegranate Seeds and Pan Jus

Offering a bevy of a la carte sides, the Gouda Potatoes au Gratin one of the best Steakhouse Spuds in all of Sin City, it was a bit unfortunate that otherwise nicely cooked Brussels Sprouts were lost amidst Salt and Vinegar, the Cauliflower a far better use of Crucifers in an All-Clad pot with restrained spicing and gently cooked Raisins

At this point turning things over to Pastry Chef Monica Delgadillo, several of her creations highlighting a previous visit, fans of Chef Mina's Chocolate Chip Cookies will be interested to know that a larger version of the recipe now forms the base of a sharable Sundae also featuring Brownies and Caramel while other seasonal choices include light yet boldly spiced Carrot Cake and piping hot Apple Fritters, though the 'go-to' remains STRIPSTEAK's world-class Beignets served with a choice of up to three great sides that are as good on their own as they are as toppings

****Not quite as extravagant as Jean Georges Steakhouse or Bazaar Meat, but still a great place for grilled Meat, creative Sides and particularly memorable Desserts, STRIPSTEAK is another worthy bearer of the Mina label here in Las Vegas",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,5,4,4YVVAdCVNp0bdxzky6EVDA

We made reservations for a Friday at 6 pm but we didn't need to as it was pretty dead. It picked up later but definitely not full like I thought it would have been.

As you would expect in Vegas, it was very stylish and beautiful and grand, with big comfy seats and huge wooden tables, a big open kitchen to see through, yadda yadda. The service was very friendly and nice without the super posh annoyingness that you get at some places (you know what I'm talking about). Our server was helpful and cool and he had a team of backups to help him out, all of whom were good as well.

There were seven of us and they kindly gave us some complimentary duck fat fries with some amazeballs dipping sauces. Seriously these were the best duck fat fries I have ever had. We then each ordered an entree and split up some appetizers. The appetizers - mac and cheese, creamed corn, potato puree, and some mushrooms. All of it was out of this world except the mushrooms, which was just regular damn good. I ended up with the angus filet mignon and it was also freakin delicious. The others at the table were equally impressed with their various entrees as I heard lots of mmmmms and ahhhhhss.

Pleased to find this gem.  Although a bit pricey ($54 for my fillet ) the atmosphere, plush seating,  and extensive wine list were very appealing and made it worth the price.

the complimentary duck fat french fry sampler was so tasty!  I loved the spin off of the american favorite dressed up gourmet style.  It was done very well.  Also I ordered a side of asparagus with some sort of lemon sauce over it, and that was fantastic as well!

5310428,2009-06-22,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"StripSteak is a fine steakhouse but, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the hype.

I'll start with something positive.  The ambience, to be expected, is excellent.  Good use of wood, and in an open, non-stuffy, modern way.  

They start you off with some complimentary french fries and potato bread.  The fries are gourmet (one kind is cooked in duck fat) and are good, but not great.  (In fact, I had some McDonalds fries the next afternoon which left me just as satisfied).  The bread is a bit dry.  I would never order it.

As for the drinks, I had a glenlivet 12 (can't report much there) and a cucumber martini.  The cucumber martini was perfect for a hot Vegas day (95 degrees) and was refreshing.  I also haven't been to too many places that offer a cucumber martini, so that was nice.  As for the drink itself, it was un-nuanced.  Overall, though, I'd get it again.

Onto the steaks.  I've been on a wagyu kick lately and like to compare the different restaurants that offer it, so I was glad to see they offered it here.  The price is supposedly market, so on this night, it was $185 for a 6 oz. New York.  In short, I was disappointed.  First, they serve it pre-sliced.  That pissed me off.  Pre-slicing alters the surface/area ratio, which means that each slice gets cold quickly.  I tried to return the steak to get a new one that wasn't pre-sliced, but the most they would do was ""flash"" the steak.  B.S.  In any event, the steak itself fell way below expectations.  Unlike CUT, the wagyu at StripSteak did not melt in my mouth and I still had to chew (ok, at CUT you do have to chew, but barely).  I would never order the wagyu here again.

I went with four other guys and none of them were impressed with their steaks (they don't even go to nice steakhouses often).  In fact, one said that the steak at Lawry's ""destroyed"" the steak at StripSteak.  That gives you some context.

On the other hand, StripSteak's truffled macarroni and cheese was truly divine.  In all seriousness, and forgive me for the superlatives, it was the best mac & cheese I've ever had, and by a wide margin.  For the truffled mac & cheese alone, I would go back to StripSteak.  If you go, it is a must order.

Finally, and it must be said since I'm a guy, the other reason to go to StripSteak is that one of their servers, Tori, is perhaps the prettiest girl you will ever see in real life.  I'm really not joking on that one (it was the consensus amongst the 5 guys at my table, as well as the table of 8 guys sitting next to us).  Ridiculous.

So, at the end of the day, 3 solid stars for StripSteak.  Can't say it's the best steakhouse (or even close to it), but it is a place to grab a good meal with a nice ambience and pretty scenery.",UKUDY_H7JXBAogn4eEIK_A,1,0,3,J9sTQMpHmsj0bQDUwsxDlg

Instead of bread, we were given complimentary duck fat fries trio: truffle oil fries, garlic herb fries and Cajun fries with truffle aioli, ketchup and Cajun sauce. Amazing! I had to tell my family the truffle fries and truffle aioli weren't good so I can have them to myself. 

We had a wagyu filet, wagyu rib eye, wagyu rib cap, spinach, corn, potato purée trio and beignets with trio of sauces. Trio trio trio everything!

Maine Lobster Fritters:
3 lobster fritters with bacon. You wrap the fritter in shiso leaf and remove the skewer then dip the fritter in the meyer lemon creme fraiche. The bacon and shiso flavors were so strong, I couldn't taste the lobster. 3/5

8oz Wagyu Filet, 8oz Wagyu Rib Eye and 8oz Wagyu Rib Cap:
Delicious, tender, juicy and simply seasoned beef. All cooked medium-rare so you can enjoy the taste of good steak without the shenanigans. Each wagyu is about $70-75 but is worth it. 4.5/5

Creamed Corn and Creamed Spinach:
The corn has jalapeno so it has a bit of a kick. The spinach has bacon streusel so it has a smokey flavor to it. 4/5

Potato Puree Trio:
Pureed potatoes three-ways: horseradish, lobster and sour cream and onion. The best one of of the three was the sour cream and onion then the horseradish and last was lobster. I wish the lobster potato puree has bits of lobster in it...it just seemed like a very thick lobster bisque that needed more oomph! But overall, this trio was nice and creamy. 4/5

Beignets:
6 beignets. We got the trio of sauces: Macallan 18 year butterscotch pudding, vanilla creme brulee and chocolate pot de creme. I wasn't sure why they called it ""sauces"" since the creme brulee and pot de creme were oh-so thick to be dipping sauces. The only sauce I used to dip the beignets in was the butterscotch pudding which really tasted like alcohol. I had to eat the creme brulee and pot de creme as individual desserts.  The beignets were perfect. Warm, light and a bit fluffy. 4/5

However, I should note that I have celiac disease, and although I have safely ordered and eaten at several restaurants in the casinos, this was not one of them.

I normally order by telling the server my restrictions, and asking how the food I choose is prepared. My meal was brought to me by someone other than my waiter. The meat came differently than described to me, and upon asking him what was in it, he told me cornstarch (I can't have corn). When my waiter came by, I asked him as well, and he agreed there was cornstarch. I told him I couldn't eat it, and he did not offer to take it away and replace it. He returned shortly after and said he checked with the chef, and said they were wrong, and there was no cornstarch. I had two bites of it, and decided it didn't seem safe. I ate the vegetables instead. I have spent the rest of my evening in awful pain from reacting to the food.

We started with some appetizers and wine by the bar because dinner had not started yet and were pleasantly intrigued with what else they had to offer.
We ordered the oysters and the foie gras sliders with pear compote.  Two of our very favorite foods and both were spectacular! We had to stay for dinner.
We were moved to the dining area where we both had the waygu Japanese rib eye med-rare of course.  It was perfectly prepared on their wood burning grill and went perfectly with the truffle mac and cheese (not the best MnC ever but still mouth watering).
We were served complimentary duck fat fries with a trio of dips and bags of caramel popcorn at the end.
Can't recall the wine we had but after stuffing our faces we were the last passengers to board the last flight out to LA scampering into the plane buzzed and satisfied. 15 min later our luggage was loaded and we took off--I'm sure we got some dirty looks for the extra lag but the food coma had set in and we were knocked out.

Instead of your normal bread & butter, Stripsteak gives you a sampler of 3 different types of french fries (paprika, regular, garlic) and 3 dipping sauces for you to munch on.  They get an extra star for originality!  

I tried their cucumber martini... which was refreshing at first but started to taste too cucumber-y towards the end.  But once again, extra star for being innovative and atypical.

I'm not a big meat person so I ordered their alaskan halibut.  Nothing fancy - just grilled with some herbs/spices on top.  But it was still very juicy and not overcooked AT ALL.

My boyfriend ordered some steak special they had ... I forgot the name but I had a bite and it was tender and JUICY!!! 

For sides, we ordered their truffled mac & cheese and asparagus.  Once again, excellent.

5369339,2014-08-18,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"A bit over priced for the portion of steak and food they give you. While the sides were pretty large the steak and lobster were quite puny. I ordered an American Wagyu rib cap that the waitress recommended  it was MP (market price) which was $80 for the steak and the half lobster was $25. The lobster was like getting a large prawn about 3 bites, quite a baby lobster for $25. I didn't not like the potato gratin that the waitress recommended it was a bit too rich in taste for me. 

Only thing that was great was that you got three different kinds of shoe string fries that 
were fried in duck fat with 3 different dipping sauces. This was complementary with order of a steak. 

The steak was good but the size and quality for $80 was not worth it for an 8oz steak.

My total bill came to be $180 for one (this includes tip of 20% and tax)  I sat at the bar because I was in shorts and tshirt and flip flops. The service was more like a 15% but I felt generous and gave 20%. I don't know if it was because I was at the bar but for a $150 meal I felt service should be impeccable. I shouldn't have to ask for a receipt for my bill or be asked to be refilled on my ice teas. 
For god sakes it's a high end steak restaurant.

1. American Wagyu rib cap $80 (market price) 
2. Potato algratin $14
3. Ice tea $4.00
5. Banana fosters egg roll $14 
6. Half baby lobster tail $25

Not worth $180, maybe for someone who has ton of money and don't care but not for someone who works hard for their money. 
Only reason I ate there was because mandalay bay casino gave me $200 in resort credit so I figure on last day having $140 left I go out with a bang. i might try again but I think I'll stick with an angus ribeye which  I believe 16oz and only $65.

Normally this area of a restaurant does not provide the most stellar of service but our bartender, Chris, was on point. He often checked up on us and made sure to glance over once in a while as well. 

We started off with the wagyu steak tartar. The fat ratio coated our mouths and when paired with the Ermitage M. Chapoutier 1997 it was heaven. Although I was getting full by this stage we continued with their New York Strip, bleu cheese scalloped potatoes, and the creamed corn. I am glad we split because I would have gone into a coma. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. Cooked to a medium and I was not ready to throw in the towel. 

By the time dessert rolled around, I was about to die. The chocolate cake with spiced cherries was decent. It was a concentrated brick of decadence. I am not always a chocolate person, which made this too much for me. The strawberry pavlova was the highlight for me. The chef takes a classic dish normally eaten in Australia and New Zealand and puts his spin on it. I have tried this dessert a few times while traveling abroad and never liked it. It tends to be too sweet. Stripsteak's version was a more mellow presentation. Before presentation a strawberry jus is poured over the fresh fruit. The combination of that with the basil ice cream is magnificent. We had also got the beignets with a McCallan 18 caramel which I didn't care for.

Here's my story:  made a reservation, got a great seat by the window so we could people watch, table was ready when we got there [good], and then everything went wrong from here.

Took a friend of mine here from San Diego, I live close to Mandalay Bay, & I had a $50 Restaurant.com certificate, so it was a logical choice. My only downfall was I took her to Panevineo the night before so the dining experiences were extremely different.

They don't serve bread to start, but rather french fries. Interesting. Making America fatter, I dig it!  I have never seen this before, I'd rather eat these with my meal then prior, but whatever. Fries were great! I mean they weren't McDonald's fries but they were dang tasty.

Ordered 2 cocktails, one with a splash of cranberry [that never happened], limes in the cocktails were actually quite gross. They looked old and discolored they had been cut days prior and when we got brave enough to squeeze them into our drinks like 2 drops of juice came out.

We ordered a stripsteak, lamb chops, and brussel sprouts [see pix].  Lamp chops came out extremely under done since my friend is Greek and ordered them well done, her mom likes to over cook lamb and that's how she's used to eating it.  She put some brussel sprouts on her plate and then we proceeded to hunt for our waitress so we could get the problem rectified.  Friend starts  eating the side dish on her plate, flag down a bus boy, who tells another waiter, waiter comes and removes her plate from in front of her--doesn't even offer to get her a side plate so she can continue to nibble, but says they'll bring out more sprouts. 

Now she has no food, no bread, so she's staring at me. Naturally, I offer some of my meal to her she starts eating some of my steak [fine].  About 10 mins later lamb comes back ready to be eaten.....no sprouts???? About 10 mins after that round 2 of sprouts appear.  OK so their preparation is interesting on this as well, they shave the sprouts so they remind you of cole slaw????  Add bacon and then drowned them in butter. Like there is a pool of butter on the bottom of the dish. Not my favorite. My strip steak was ok, but it needed chimichurri.  There wasn't really a selection of sauces you could put on your steak much like you would see at STK or other fine places in this city.  Menu was rather limited and lacked depth to me.

No apologies for food, etc [fine] .  Bill finally comes, we've been here now for like an hour and a half, give them the restaurant.com certificate, and now the waitress has to find the manager to take it off.  ANOTHER 10 mins goes by, finally get the bill back, and thankfully we checked b/c they took the certificate off but then added 18% gratuity. OK. Our waitress was not worth 18%, I can guarantee you that, but fine.   What I didn't like was that she didn't mention that the tip was on there, which I HATE.  She was sat with a 10 to 15 top in the back, and 3 tables of 4.  THEN another table sat down of 6 men. They got the menu, waited a bit, no-one came to help them, they got up and LEFT--and I don't blame them.

So that was my story and my morale is: pick another steakhouse :) there's some really good ones in town.",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,2,1,1,7BW-xA-CVj0XUk9zuvWFBg

Started off at the bar with a round of drinks.  We were seated pretty quickly after since we had a reservation.  We got the french fries, herb, truffle, and paprika.  They were delicious.  Our waiter Heather was really friendly and an excellent server not too annoying but also helpful in making appropriate suggestions.  She even brushed it off diplomatically when one of the guys at our table hit on her.

We ordered some sides, the brussel sprouts with bacon, mac and cheese, and mushrooms (I wish I could offer more descriptive recaps but I was hammered).

I ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it was perfect.  I've been to fancy steak houses before and this definitely makes the cut if you will as one of the nicer ones.  Some of the guys at our table ordered the Kobe cap steak which they also enjoyed.  

The filet was the right size, 10 oz and I wasn't able to eat it all after all the fries and other sides.  We got free gourmet popcorn which was a nice touch.  

The sommelier wandered around and we ordered an Oregon Pinot Noir which was nice and I took a to-go cup because I'm classy like that.  I wandered out almost with the glass and they offered me a plastic cup, ahhh I just love Vegas.

My sister and I went there for her Birthday and the hostess was so nice and quick to have my sister and I seated.  The server was there instantly to take our drink order with complementary duck fat fries (Amazing!!!). I tried the bourbon flight and my sister stuck with wine. We shared a wedge salad, and instead of having us slice and dice it on our own, they have two mini salads. We both had the 18 oz bone in ribeye (My God, the best I've ever had. And I've been to Bobby Flays and Tom Colcchicios restaurants). We asked for a recommendation on side and was suggested the green beans and mac & cheese. I'm not a fan of green beans but the server swore by them. Was quite impressed, never had a soy glaze let alone mixed with thai basil. Was delicious.  The Mac & Cheese was to die for. Was stuffed but made myself eat everything. The thought of leaving anything unfinished was unthinkable. Loved the Bourbon flight but forgot what brands they were, server wrote out the bourbons in order I drank them so I would know which was which. By far best place I've been in a very long time.

the trio of duck fat fries they give you are just delicious! not to mention, they're free! they charge you for refills though, oh wellz...

the free bread they give out here is one of the best free breads around, it kind of looks like a small pizza, it comes in a small pizza pan like thing, it has the perfect spices on it, and the crust is nice and crunchy, amazing free bread!

i went with the pre-fix menu this time that they were having for restaurant week

around $50 for a 3-course dinner, what a deal!

appetizer, american kobe beef tar-tar... DELISH! the dish comes with two small pieces of pita, and two clumps of kobe beef, put the two together and they make a great combination, the beef was very flavorful and tasty

main course, 8 ounce filet mignon... very nice and tender cut of meat, cooked perfectly to a medium rare, one of the best filet mignons i've ever had, it also came with three mini sides, sauteed spinach with bacon, truffled mac and cheese, and... not really sure what the third dish was, it was kind of like a combination between mashed potatoes and creamed corn, all three were very good, especially the truffled mac and cheese

dessert, butterscotch pudding with (spanish donuts?)... the pudding was kind of weird at first, but after getting used to the taste i just could not stop eating it, i think there's a bit of rum in it, and it was just amazing, the donuts were also warm and fluffy, topped with powdered sugar but not too sweet 

overall, just an AMAZING dinner

the service here was also amazing, we were late for our reservation so i called them in to tell them, and they gladly moved back our reservation time, and whenever you leave your seat for whatever reason, they always fold up your napkin for you, haha, i thought that was pretty cool

also, the hostess was just so cute!

What an experience!  I am not a vegetarian but I don't eat steak very often.  This night I opted for the rib eye.  BEST STEAK ever!  I could only eat about 1/4 of it but every bite was amazing.  Two of my fellas got the same but my Son got the wagyu cut (this has replaced Kobe).  I was a little put off by the texture and appearance of this steak and did not try it.  My Son said the flavor was amazing and that he was glad he tried it but would probably never order it again because of the texture.  It was soft and gelatinous which was very unappealing to all of us.  We were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary amuse bouche of the duck-fat fries with dipping sauces.  There were plenty for all four of us.  There were three different types of fries and they were all unique and delicious; however, one of them was a little too salty for my palate.  The men thoroughly enjoyed them.  We ordered several of the sides with the stand-out being the truffle and macaroni and cheese.  The cocktail and beer selection was amazing as well.  It was a wonderful dining experience.   The server was knowledgeable and attentive.  She surprised us with complimentary ""kibble"" (out of this world, delicious, chocolate-covered gourmet popcorn) when she delivered our bill.

I have been here at least 5 times and I always bring a $50 restaurant.com coupon.  This isn't a top 3 steakhouse in Vegas but $50 off from $100 makes it a terrific value for a really solid steak.  

We've recently been ordering the $72 porterhouse which is a monster cut that can easily be split 2 ways and even 3 if you get an appetizer or an extra side.  They'll bring it out to you in a pan already carved up if you want a la Peter Luger style and that's what we do.  I also love all the meaty goodness on the bone itself.  To me, kobe beef is basically that really tender, juicy part by the bone all blown up into a regular sized piece of steak.  My wife loves the filet so I eat the majority of the sirloin side which is just fine with me.  We like it rare.

The sides are $14 each so 2 of those gets me to a $100 exact.  The spinach souffle is the absolute must freakin have side dish.  I don't think there's any other restaurant doing the souffle quite like this.  The server brings it to the table piping hot, punctures the top of it and pours cream into it.  One of my favorite sides ever.  I am over creamed spinach!  We're through!

We went with the mushrooms cooked in bacon for our second side since we already loaded up on starch from those awesome complimentary fries they bring to the table.  Forget bread, forget appetizers, you've got french fries!  I never make it to dessert anyways.        

But the kicker this evening was when it came to box the steak.  We had asked the server to box up the 2 leftover pieces along with the bone itself.  The general manager was assisting the servers and busing tables.  She accidentally threw out the leftovers not hearing the server ask her to box it up.  I didn't make that big of a beef (ha) about it but she proposed the chef to cook us another WHOLE porterhouse and box it up for us!  I was stunned.  Talk about going above and beyond!  Who are we to say no to another $72 steak?  Wow.  This was an all around great experience and I look forward to the next time.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,24,17,4,bDlQTPGYZsua11KlSBGzHw

The sommelier was helpful and made a very good suggestion based on my description/request.

The duck fat fries were good but the truffle aioli tasted sour.  Overall, they were definitely not the mind-blowingly awesome fries/dips we've experienced in previous visits.

The BLT wedge was delicious.

For sides, we had spinach, creamed corn and gratin.  The creamed corn and gratin were both delicious. The gratin was an excellent recommendation by our waiter - very flavorful and prepared very well. The spinach was just okay - definitely not on par with the spinach soufflé which used to be an option. 

Our waiter ended up being one for two with recommendations as unfortunately, two of us ordered the Wagyu rib cap based on his recommendation and suggestion that ""people come back here just for this cut of beef."" Well, I may want to come back for the gratin, but definitely NOT this steak.  We both ordered the beef medium rare. They both were served at medium and in some spots medium-well.

5586747,2011-09-08,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I arrived before my sis-in-heart to celebrate her birthday. I mentioned the occasion so that we could have a table that wasn't stuck in the midst of a bunch of tourists, nor did I want to sit near the bar; we wanted to take our time and enjoy the evening. When the hostess sat us, she found for us a table sort of center-stage... in other words, we could see everything going on and had a fantastic view of the whole place.

As soon as we sat down, we were offered water and a wine list and the Restaurant Week menu. As that is how my sis chose this place, we were just fine with that idea.

We also noticed a birthday card from the staff. Details, people, details!

Getting to the good stuff (well, mostly):

Duck-fat Fries (3.5/5) - The truffled fries were amazing but their accompanying bleu cheese sauce was bland and boring. The herbed fries were, ironically, refreshing, with a simple ketchup (keep it simple, STRIPSTEAK!). The last one, I can't remember what it was, was good with the grain mustard sauce (the best sauce offered, just flavorful enough without putting off people [my sis] who don't like mustard). 

Foie Gras Sliders (1.5/5) - Ordered off the main menu as an extra, we originally wanted the grilled foie gras they list as an extra. We were told it was a single piece, but if we order the sliders there are 2. OK, we thought, we'll try it. Spoiler alert! It was still a single piece, just sliced in half. This made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. The bread (I tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. The garnishes were OK. A single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. Overall, high hopes dashed.

Duck Spring Rolls (3.5/5) - Generous portion and, I was happily surprised, not too heavy. The wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. Again, however, it was not heavy. The crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. The meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. It was a bit dry in spots. I am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.

Heirloom Tomato Salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - Fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn't weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.

NY Strip (4/5) - Slightly overcooked based on our order. We were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. The sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.

Roasted Chicken (4/5) - A tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. I love that they left the skin on; I don't eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. The truffled mac n' cheese (4/5) was really good. Almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it's own amazing profile.

Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Biegnets (5/5) - The brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. The biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. Another detail we thought was fantastic, sis's dessert came out presented with the words Happy Birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!

Wines (5/5, nail on the head every time). We started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of Gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish Oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. We spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked AND what we ordered). Given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.

The service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. There were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. 

All in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.

With the Restaurant Week menu (50.11 each), the 2 wines by the glass and the bottle, plus the additional foie gras, our total was $300 and change. Bonus tip: they are on restaurant.com so another $50 saved!",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,2,1,4,6FVKr98E8vbOSeCi31fYHA

Kobe slides - ridiculously expensive and you only get 2. Even at half price, not a deal. They tasted like your average upper end sliders and nothing special.

Duck fat fries - the dipping truffle sauce was good. Ketchup and bbq sauce dips were just that. The fries were far from awesome, I would gladly take fries from McDonalds over these and not pay a fraction as much.

Ultimately we expected much more after hearing how good the reviews were on these. It wasn't bad food, but subpar for this type if place, thus the two stars",z4IFMXSW5TSm62QcrWWPOA,1,0,2,_J2oiA02A4cy69ajkrwAdQ

The foie gras from their appetizer menu is paired with pineapple for a sweet and savory starter. We devoured it. The yellowtail sashimi was also delicious but not the best we've had. I'd recommend trying something else.

My girlfriend and I both ordered the wagyu filet mignon cooked medium rare. This steak was one of the better filets I've had since living here. Don't be cheap, get the wagyu. It's worth the price difference. 

The only thing we didn't enjoy about this restaurant were the chairs! They're more of a lounge style seat than they are appropriate for sitting at a table. Uncomfortable and it kind of isolates you from the person next to you because of the large arms. Hard to be romantic when you can't sit closely to your partner.

The service was spectacular. They even left us a ""Happy Anniversary!"" card on the table when we arrived. We had show reservations at 7 at the Bellagio and they made sure we were out of the restaurant in an hour to make it back on time.

As so many people on here rave about, I have to start with the duck fat fries. I assumed they might taste a little gamey and I'm not a huge fan of the taste of duck, but WOW. Every bite had one wonderful wave of flavor after the next.

Both my boyfriend and I had the filet minion. It's everything you want out of a filet - melts in your mouth and a wonderful rich flavor. My only complaint is that the 10 oz is a bit too big for one person (surprisingly) and I ended up leaving 1/4 of it on my plate at the end.

As a side, my boyfriend got the potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream & onion, and horseradish) which is more than enough for two people to share.

This is going to be a staple every time I return to Las Vegas, for sure.

5604304,2012-07-19,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Here's a tip from me to you : if you're planning on drinking alcohol or hitting a club at night, don't have dinner at Stripsteak beforehand. I had a wardrobe change into looser clothes but still enjoyed a great meal here last Sunday. The trio of fries comes out in place of bread. They took awhile to arrive at our table (note : service isn't the fastest) but they were fantastic. Who doesn't love French fries, especially when fried in duck fat? My favorite dipping sauce was the truffle cream and my favorite fries were the garlic herb. Delicious!

I ordered the scallops and added the roasted bone marrow because I just had to. I should've just had that bone marrow as my main course. It's so fatty and meaty and drool inducing with the buttery little toast on the side. You better believe I scraped that bone marrow clean. The scallops were fine but for $41 I don't think the 3 pieces were worth it. We had lobster mac and cheese as a side and they were ok but I don't recall seeing or tasting any lobster. Maybe the essence of the lobster was running throughout the cheese sauce and my unrefined palate did not catch it.

My husband ordered the foie gras tasting menu. I was too busy eating my own meal but I remember not liking the cold appetizer. The salad course was awesome and I got a big piece of the foie gras from his place. I guess they banned it in California recently so we had foie gras on the mind. I wouldn't order this again if I had a choice however, but I'm not the hugest fan of the stuff.

5625772,2009-09-22,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Michael Mina has exploded.  Before you know it, he is going to have a restaurant in every major city in the country.  I've eating at several of his other restaurants so I had a good idea of what to expect.  However, this was the first time I've visited his steakhouses.  From a culinary aspect, I've always enjoyed his food.  However, the price you pay for his work tends to eclipse a reasonable number.  I've always left his place enjoying the food but never wanting to go back because I feel like it cost a little more than its worth.  The amount of add-ons you get exceed reasonable.  With that being said, having an expensive restaurant in Vegas is the norm and almost should be expected.  So, with that in mind, my concerns with cost went out the door and that left my taste buds to enjoy every savory bite.  

At a steakhouse, its a standard that I get the bone-in rib eye.  We went to StripSteak on a Thursday night and they sat us close to 11pm, which was great (we arrived at 9:45pm).  I ordered the American Kobe Tartare and it was delicious.  Very flavorful, not to overwhelming and the steak just melted in your mouth.  An excellent appetizer that was prepared table side.  The steak I ordered was medium-rare and it was spot on.  The thickness of the cut is slightly smaller than say a rib eye cut at Delmonico's.  So the edges of the cut were closer to medium than the center which was closer to medium-rare.  The tenderness of the steak was excellent.  An excellent steak that was grilled perfectly.  

A steakhouse should be able to make great steak.  That is the norm.  To make great appetizers at a steakhouse, that isn't necessarily a given.  I think one of the best steakhouses for appetizers and ""other"" parts of the meal I've experienced was at David Burke's Primehouse in Chicago.  At that steakhouse, it is more than just the steak.  StripSteak is pretty close but still a distant second to David Burke's.  The thing that separates this steakhouse and makes it a four-star on yelp is the scotch selection.  The selection of scotch is extensive and is well worth the visit for any aficionado.  On this night, I visited with a friend that knew scotch more than me and he was surprised at the selection.  

Lastly, this is one of the few steakhouses on the strip that actually serves true Japanese A5 wagyu.  They have two choices, filet and ribeye.  Both Bradley Ogden's in Caesar's Palace and SW steakhouse in the Wynn have a version of the filet and CUT in the Palazzo actually has two choices as well (filet and ribeye).  So this is one of the few amongst many traditional steakhouses.  It does provide more options.

Cons: 
The wine selection by the glass was okay at the time of this review (9/13/09-ish).  I was really hoping that they had some really good bold cabs by the glass but everything that I wanted was by the bottle and the bottle selection, although expansive, was expensive.  As usual, the markup on some of these bottles are way too much.  

I've only been here once so far but I look forward to eating here again.  Nice work Michael, now maybe you can fix your original namesake in Union Square---but I digress.",lBrqz3tvS2SU7al1sagZBw,0,0,4,Qgtj2v6D_EEqouNCNti3OQ

        I was here for Vegas Uncork'd by Bon Appetit Magazine; I signed up for quite a few special events, the Japanese Wagyu and Japanese Whisky tasting was 1 of them. Stripsteak has changed a lot; new executive chef Gerald Chin just this Spring 2013 (former chefs at Bradley Ogden, Guy Savoy, Rick Moonen, Joël Robuchon); so I was stoked to see him again, since I've been following his work for a decade long now. He's also the latest winner of Chop on Food Networks 2013 season. 

       Stripsteak is such a new mordern steakhouse, nice and spacious lay out, top of the line steak, nice wine list and beautiful creative cocktail list. I was so thrilled to be here. 

       What was an unique opportunity to experience Japanese wagyu tasting along with hand-crafted Japanese whiskey cocktail pairings.  A homage to the return of Japanese wagyu to the Unites States, Chef Michael Mina took us through a tasting journey based on his experiences from a recent culinary exploration tour to Japan.  Mina Group barman/mixologist Carlo Splendorini, will pair each course with the perfect Japanese whiskey.

      The event was hosted by Andrew Knowlton, Bon Appetit writer; and Want to see what Michael Mina does with $9,000 worth of Wagyu beef? And we got to eat it this meal, amazing - Please watch it here: http://www.bonappetit.com/blogsandforums/blogs/badaily/2013/05/michael-mina-wagyu-beef.html

      Watching chef Michael Mina, chef Gerald Chin, chef Gary LaMorte worked their magic at ever single dish we ate were so delicious. Watched barman Carlo Splendorini shown us the ceremony of Japanese whisky was just stunning! I got to meet this awesome barman Carlo at Michael Mina and RN74 in San Francisco where he's often at; to see him here again, it was so cool!

- Wagyu beef tataki - 3 ways, each with powder, spinach rolled in each piece, each has its own flavor, melt in your mouth, so marbled, no cooking needed! I die happy!
   1. Aged soy salt
   2. Fresh wasabi
   3. Braised lovtus root
- Parining with The Berrykin featuring Nikka 12-year Japanese Whisky

- Wagyu beef broth and crisp tendon, Tokyo negi, ramen garnish (salmon trout, nori), quail egg - this broth was crazily tasty, rich, flavorful; Julie K. and I licked the bowl to the last drop!

- Pairing with Gogo Yubari featuign Hakushu 12-year Japanese Whisky.

- Grilled wagyu beef with charred Miso, at least 8 OZ of goodness gracious meatilicious! Crispy shallot, fried rice, ginger tamago - this is why  I work out 5 days a week and at least 2 hours a day to indulge like this! Worth every single sweat!

- Pairing with Japanese Whisky ceremony featuring Yamasaki 12-year Japanese Whisky, served in a Bordeaux glass with banana aroma, this ceremony is worth the ticket to the event itself! 

- Beignets with Japanese Whisky pot de creme - Julie K & I couldn't eat anymore by now!

     After 3 days for luxurious food and wines with 78 Michelin Stars chefs combined, this was how we ended our Vegas trip, in this high note, at Stripsteak steakhouse, no better way to say goodbye to Vegas.

His name was Steve. But, I'm pretty sure everyone there is nice. It is a fancy place, so, it is a little bit rather expensive. But, definitely worth every penny! Plus, they give you a couple of complementary items. Such as their french fries. There were three different batches & each one had that their own dipping sauce or ketchup. That was a nice touch. In addition to the fries, we ordered our usual shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were fresh & tasted very delicious! The cocktail sauce had a little bit of a kick to it, but it was not too spicy at all. Although, they did have a little tiny bottle of Tabasco for those that really like it spicy. The cucumber Martini was excellent. It was not watered down, but it didn't have too much alcohol either. I know for some, that could never be possible. I also had their hot tea which came in a cute little Asian style teapot. The sugar was in a separate shiny brass container. Very elegant. I ordered the 16 oz. ribeye. I was a little worried because it did not have the bone in. That is what I am used to. But, it was still very flavorful. I also asked for it to be extra well done & extra charred. Some restaurants are scared to do this. So, I always add the sentence ""I promise I will not complain if it's burnt."" Some like it rare, I like it that way. Different strokes for different folks. It came out perfectly. I was very happy with it. As for the sides, we ordered the broccoli, the gratin potatoes & the truffle mac & cheese. I did not particularly like the truffle mac & cheese. I like truffles, but to a minimum. As for the potatoes, they were absolutely delicious. They do their gratin quite differently from other places. I like their version very much! (I did not personally try the broccoli, although I heard it was good.) We got stuffed rather quickly. The food was filling, comforting & very delicious. For dessert, I wanted to try their famous beignets. I read about them, they sounded & looked amazing in the pictures. Unfortunately, I didn't have anyone to share them with. So, we had some ice cream. Cinnamon toast & mint chocolate chip. I loved the mint chocolate chip, but I didn't care for the cinnamon toast too much. Lastly, when Steve packed up everything to go. We were surprised with another gift. Their absolutely delicious caramel & chocolate popcorn. One for each person. Once again, such a nice touch. Overall, I really love this restaurant.

In fact, it may be one of the best strip steaks Ive ever had. The flavors were robust. The meat was perfectly cooked, nice and juicy and the marbling was charred, which was perfect. The steak was about as perfect as one can get. I also added a lobster tail with my steak, and that was good too. The whole meal was completely satisfying.

This is kind of a splurge restaurant, both dollar-wise and calorie-wise, and I say calories be damned when in Vegas.  Just spend an extra hour in the pool the next day.

I got the 18oz ribeye, and it was terrific.  I'm not sure if the kitchen is preparing the steaks with anything else besides salt & pepper, but my steaks at home never taste this good.  The thought of sauce never crosses your mind as your eat your steak.  The sides here are EXCELLENT.  We got the creamed corn, the potato gratin, creamed spinach, mac & cheese, and mushrooms.  I couldn't pick a favorite if you put a gun to my head, because they were all so dang good in their own way.  The creamed corn is slightly spicy, and the kernels are still firm when you take a bite, instead of all mushy.  The potato gratin is definitely more like a potato lasagna (as to aptly described by the famous Phil T), so don't even try to scoop it with the spoon they give you.  Grab a knife and go to down on that bad boy.

The service was good, and I never had to ask for more water, as they were constantly keeping an eye on us and stopping by.

Although the burger is only served during happy hour, they made an exception or is that a facade too just like their ""fries compliments of the chef"" line? Who cares they're both good. 

The ""kobe"" beef burger. It would take a team of detectives to find out if it's actually kobe because the taste itself could fool you into thinking it is. The best burger meat I've ever had. A perfect medium rare. The meat could have been put in between burnt toast and it would of still killed it. That's all there is to say. Did I forget what the bread tasted like? And the other ingredients? Yes...but that meat got added to the list of things that I can think of and still savor. 

The complimentary fries were better than the ones that come with the burger. I wish they gave you an option of getting a different side on the count that the ""chef"" gives out free fries like casinos give out free drinks. The sauces and different styles of them were perfect beer pairings.

The service was cool. I feel bad I really do, everyone ordering steaks and starters and round after round of drinks and there I was having a burger at 630pm. But hey I had to do it for the yelp.

The food was very good.  The duck fries were very tasty and left you wanting more.
I had the Wagyu Rib Cap, I got it done medium well and it was fantastic!!!!!!!! I highly recommend to anyone visiting this restaurant.  
The atmosphere is great, the people and the staff were very friendly and the drinks were great.

Our services was very mediocre we had a party of 5 we were not very demanding at all, but for some reason our server didn't seem to be very attentive to us.  Poor customer service can ruin your whole experience.  

Our server somewhat forced me into getting the wagyu rib cap after I told him that I wanted the wagyu  ribeye and I didn't appreciate that.  While it was a good choice that I ended up getting rip cap our server was very aggressive.  I guess he was looking for a bigger tip.  
The sides were just okay, we ordered the mac and cheese truffle and we had ordered the spinach soufflé and it came out undercooked, they took it back and brought it back to the table once we were all finished with our food.

Is it highly rated?  Yup!  Esquire Magazine has it listed as one of the top 10 steakhouses in the US!  Easy to make reservations? Opentable.com easy.  Is it modern and trendy?  Duck fat fries!!!!

We ordered:
Duck fat fries (complimentary)
Foie gras sliders $22
Potato puree trio $14
Creamed spinach with bacon sauce $10
and we both ordered the Ribeye in bone $52 each

Surprisingly, the duck fat fries came free instead of bread, and they were awesome.  It came with 3 sauces, truffle, ketchup, and ranch.  They were very crispy and you could totally taste the duck goodness in every bite, especially as an aftertaste.  I had been meaning to try duck fat fries in LA and they have a place on Western in KTown, but haven't tried them yet so this was an unexpected treat.  

The sliders were delicious, though only about 2.5 bites each.  The steaks came out and you could really taste the quality beefiness with the first mouth watering bite.  Very tender, flavorful and perfectly seasoned, bite after bite was lip smacking good.  I love mashed potatoes and the puree trio did not disappoint. They came in 3 blends: wasabi, lobster, and sour cream and chives.  Of the 3, I really liked lobster the best and though it didn't have any chunks of lobster the flavor was there and really well infused.  The other 2 were delicious though and if I had some bread to wipe up the remainder I most definitely would have.  The creamed spinach was awesome too, though pretty pricy for $10 with the amount they give.  Not a big deal.

We were also given $50 credit from Mandalay Bay because we were staying there and it was part of our package.  The restaurant is located in the casino so we actually got $100 off with the restaurant.com gift certificate.  You can't beat that!  One of the best steak dinners I've had and literally half off.

Main courses are pretty much what you'd expect of a steak house: lots of steak, and some seafood. Beef lovers may choose between Angus beef, Wagyu beef (what most places call Kobe) and, if memory serves, true Kobe beef. There are some surprises in the side dishes. I failed to write any down except those I ended up ordering: duck fat fries; roasted marrow bones.

The feel is modern, with lots of glass and steel. An industrial ceiling is high above, below which is a checkerboard latticework of what looks like stainless steel. The floor is speckled black, white, and gray granite tile. In the bar area, the bar top is glass with a stainless steel edge at the back. Servers are dressed in black. Loud rock music is playing.

I opted for a ridiculously unhealthy meal: Angus filet mignon; duck fat fries; roasted marrow bones. The filet was firm, a little dry, but with a nice charcoal flavor. It was served with two small roasted peppers and a bulb of roasted garlic. The duck fat fries were very interesting: three small cups of french fries, with three flavors (BBQ; truffle; unknown) and three sauces (BBQ; mayonnaise; catsup). The fries were crisp, almost crunchy, and tasted great. Highly recommended. The roasted marrow bones were very good, with lots of rich marrow; very good with steak. This is something you either love or hate.

First impressions, this is a more casual steakhouse than I'm used to, but it's actually really nice.   Our server was Katie and she was great!  We got our menus and placed our drink orders.   The drinks were good and they came out rather quickly.   
On to the food.   We ordered, the instant bacon (pork belly), Waygu tatare, wedge salad, mixed greens, Tomahawk Waygu 40 oz, and spinach.   Ok, the instant bacon is a must try.   It's wonderful, it comes covered and when they open the cover, you get the smell of smoke.  It's really great.   The tatare was very good, it came with awesome pesto which complemented the sweetness of the meat very nicely.   The salads were good, but nothing to write home about.   The tomahawk was excellent.   We had it medium rare and it was perfectly cooked.   40 ounces is a fair amount of meat, but it was good.  The veggies were also pretty good.  
For dessert, we had beignets,   Wow!  They were awesome.   Get the trio of sauces.  You have to plan ahead and save a little room for them but it was worth it.   Our favorite was the Macallan scotch sauce.   We never received the fries that everyone talks about, but that's ok because we had plenty of other food.  
Overall, it was a very nice dinning experience.   The food and drink were all very good.  This is relaxed place to enjoy a good steak.   Particular shout out to Katie.   She did a great job of keeping things flowing at the perfect pace and she was very fun to talk to.

But... the best part? The habanero CREAM CORN. Oh man, I've never had corn this good, the spicy flavor blended just perfectly with the corn. We scraped that (little) bowl DRY.",3dmA1XCPgQaXgkpuLQVB0g,3,2,5,fGW3gP_Mlutki0CdpWul6g

My friends and I decided to try STRIPSTEAK while in Vegas for the weekend and were certainly glad we did.  Dinner there was one of our favorite events of the whole weekend.

Cocktails were delicious and effective.  The fries, as everyone points out, are a highlight.  We all went with Wagyu fillets for an entree and shared a few sides.  None of it disappointed.  Their macaroni and cheese has made it tough for me to ever want to try any other macaroni and cheese anywhere else.  The asparagus and shallot potato cakes were tasty as well.

For dessert we went with yet a few more cocktails and their cheesecake, beignets,  chocolate cake, and a lighter strawberry type dessert (I can't recall the name).  

My only regret is that I am not physically capable of eating more.  I highly recommend STRIPSTEAK to anyone looking to enjoy a long dinner while visiting Vegas.  The experience is worth the cost.",xztPbkxk-YlWWH7jRTCNSw,3,1,5,7T02RpF7p59jMWHqXmHm6Q

When my steak came back it was overcooked and tough. They should have replaced it. The waiter could see we were miffed and never really came back to our table. He sent the manager over every time. We were not being rude or that impatient but we got upset after nothing was done. I didn't eat my steak and our friend didn't eat her fish course.

Compliments of the chef, we received 3 different kinds of duck fat fries each with it's own dipping sauce. These were ridiculously good, foodgasmic even!

I had the 10 oz. filet and was once again impressed! It was seared to perfection, almost to the point that I thought it might be overcooked. I was stoked when I cut in and found it was a perfect medium rare, just as I requested. I wish they offered a petite filet...  With our entrees we had the truffled mac & cheese and asparagus.  I would skip the asparagus next time and opt for just the mac & cheese, which stole the show.

The potato focaccia bread came out in its own cast iron skillet.   My fingers glistened with oil after my first piece.  And  yes, that was a good thing. 

We ordered the 18 oz. bone-in rib eye and the 10 oz. filet and all I can say is WOW.  Both were cooked absolutely perfect and the taste was amazing.  The flavor of the rib eye was out of this world and the filet was deliciously tender.  

Our side dishes were brussels sprouts with bacon (trust me ... you've NEVER had brussels sprouts like this before) and the trio of mashed potatoes -- horseradish, lobster and sour cream & onion.

The complimentary fries were pretty good. Basically, the fries were provided in three stainless steel cups, with each cup filled with different flavored fries: parmesan, truffle, and duck fat. I also tried the West/East coast oysters. Those were too fishy for me...maybe the flights that shipped those oysters were delayed. My party ordered a few appetizers of which was the bone marrow. The marrow was topped with an overwhelming amount of onions. The richness of the marrow disappeared, as a result. 

Now onto the main event. I had the NY Strip cooked medium rare. It was cooked perfectly, but served warm. Tasted similar to meat cooked an hour ago which sat under a warming lamp; similar to a buffet. Don't get me wrong, the meat tasted dry aged, but the temperature of the meat threw me off. 

Service was generally okay, except when my party asked for another set of complimentary fries, we got rejected and was told..$6 please. I expected more from a place that sells $50-75 steaks.

My wife got the Kurobuta pork duo.  Dry as the Las Vegas Desert!  Bland as the desert sand!  She didn't want to finish so I gave a stab at it.  I didn't feel like finishing it either!  They should go back to the drawing board on this entree!

First off I have to start with our server Brian. This guy provided us pretty flawless service and is a fantastic server. Friendly, professional, knowledgeable with the menu and preparations, and just the right amount of checking on us. 

We arrived around 5:30 and were one of the first ones to be seated. By the time we left the restaurant was packed full, however our level of service never changed. Brian had many full tables but we never had to look for him or ask for our drinks to be refilled. 

As first timers Brian went over the menu and as always we asked for suggestions which he was happy to provide. The complimentary duck fat fries were soon delivered. Served with three different dips a great start to the dinner. We ordered the yellowtail sashimi appetizer. Although the fish was fresh and flavors were good it was our least favorite dish of the night. For $24 I was expecting a lot more than five small bites. 

For our steaks we ordered the 16 oz prime bone in ribeye and the 10 oz prime filet. Brian said it was the best filet he's ever had and I would have to agree. Both steaks were cooked perfectly as ordered. My NY had great flavor and was served with melted butter on top. The filet was phenomenal, so juicy and tender. For our sides we chose the jalapeño corn and potato gratin. The corn was really good but the gratin...out of this world! Thin soft layers of potato covered in melted smoked gouda. 

To finish we had to order Strip Steaks famous beignets. A staple on the menu since they opened they come in an order of 3 or 6. If you order 6 you get a trio of ""sauces"" which of course we did :-)  The beignets were incredibly soft, served warm and cooked to perfection and then dusted with powder sugar. Two of the sauces, the mocha and the vanilla were actually a creme brûlée style and not a sauce. The third one, a butterscotch you could pour on the beignets. A perfect ending to a fabulous dinner that I will not soon forget.

We get there and had to wait about 15 minutes before we got seated (when we got in, over half the tables were empty...) Whatever - thats fine. I got a little happy bday card from them and the waiter was really cool at first. Then I let him know we had a restaurant.com certificate and I don't know but I feel like maybe it went all downhill from there (not sure why they would be upset with this bc they still make the same tip amount if we didn't have the certificate.)

We got the duckfat fries. They were mediocre. So many people raved about these fries and I just didn't think they were anything special. They actually came out room temperature and seemed over cooked. I would have rather had some bread.

Then we ordered. My boyfriend ordered the Gold Label Kobe NY and I told the waiter that I wanted the Kobe Rib Eye and then the waiter convinced me that I wanted the Kobe Rib Cap. I said that I wanted something super tender and buttery and he said definitely Rib Cap. We both ordered our steaks ""medium."" We also got a baked potato and the bacon creamed spinach. I asked for a wine that went well with my steak and I said I normally drink white sweet wines but i would do a red wine if he could recommend one. He didn't know anything about wine or he was being sort of condescending towards me bc I said that I never really drink red wine. I dunno. I just got a glass of riesling. 

The food came out rather quickly - maybe thats because they barely cooked our steaks!! What the hell - they both came out RARE ( we ordered medium.) And this rib cap I got - it was super chunky and chewy and bloody - just not what I wanted at all :(  My boyfriends $85 steak was a bloody massacre. The inside was just pure mush- you couldn't see any grain in the meat at all. My bacon spinach was almost too bacony- I LOVE bacon but the flavor overpowered the spinach. My boyfriend said his potato was good though and the sour cream that was served with it was delicious. 

Since I saw peoples' bday desserts from Yelp photos, I was waiting for them to bring me an ice cream or something. They didn't, so I just ordered off the dessert menu - I got the Dunking Donuts- since our meals sucked, I was relying heavily on these donuts to make up for it!! These donuts literally took about 30 minutes to bring out - this took longer than the steaks lol. They wrote happy bday and I got my candle then we ate the donuts and... they were ok but I would have rather had Dunkin donuts or krispy kreme!!! When we ordered the donuts, we asked if they had vanilla (instead of the caramel that went with it) and they did. He asked if we wanted to swap it and I said I'd rather have just one caramel and one vanilla scoop. Who knew they would charge $5 for the little tiny scoop that was smaller than a teaspoon and that we demolished in one bite. lol. 

So then we get the bill - $286.... yeah. thank goodness for the certificate we had then it came out to $236. We didn't even order appetizers!!! They charged $24 just for water. They charged $12 for the little donut things plus the freakin $5 for like the smallest scoop of vanilla ice cream I've ever had in my life. This place is a rip off. We have no problem paying $300-$500 for a fabulous dinner experience but this one was far from it.

We had a 9 pm reservation and opted for the tasting menu ($320 per couple with wine pairing). Even with the crowd tapering down, service was rushed and we were barely halfway through one glass of wine before the next course and pour were dropped on our table. Wines were good. Champagne and Viognier quite nice; main course wine was a very nice Mas du Daumas Gassac vin du pays.

There was virtually no service attention between courses, other than water refills and table clearance. Not that there was any time for attention, given how rushed everything was.

With respect to food, oysters were tiny but good. Second course, ravioli, was chewy and tasted a bit stale. Main course, skirt steak and Australian lobster tail, was ok. Steak quite good, lobster over cooked and meaty. Best part of the meal, I'm afraid, was the complimentary duck-fat French fries. 

Ambience is poor. The dining room looks like a slightly more stylish than average coffee shop. We endure the piped-in thumper music of the Mandalay Bay food and beverage concourse throughout our entire meal.

The steaks were cooked under a firewood grill it did have a bit of a charcoal flavor. The sides we got broccolini and black truffle Mac and cheese. Both were delicious. 

Price. 
Very reasonable for a part of two. About 125 per person.

5942182,2015-11-01,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"It honestly kills me to give a Michael Mina restaurant a 3-star review -- I've been to many of his restaurants around the country, and am nearly always thrilled with the service and quality of the food.  Perhaps it was an off-night for the chef, but I left disappointed.

Let me start with the good -- there were 16 of us in our party, and the accommodations were great (it's generally tough to deal with a party that size), as was the service.  Also, the appetizers (tuna and hamachi poppers and fries) were very good.  As was the wedge salad.  And the side dishes were all great.

The disappointing part of the evening was the main course -- the steak.  I decided on the filet, which was a generous cut and looked great when presented.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked and dry.  The strange part is that -- with all the distraction of the large party -- several my friends and I didn't realize until after the food was delivered that we were never asked how we'd like the steak prepared (to be fair, it sounds like about three-quarters of the party were asked...just not the several sitting near me).

I'm not overly picking about preparation -- I would have been happy with medium-rare or medium -- but the steak came out on the medium-well side.  Worse yet, it was barely warm.  Perhaps a side effect of the large group, but I imagine we weren't the first time the chef has dealt with large parties.  Good rule of thumb -- if the server forgets to ask how someone would like their steak cooked, ere on the medium-rare side, not the medium-well side.  In addition, the steak wasn't seasoned much at all (those this could have been a side-effect of it being overcooked).  

In retrospect, I should have returned the meat, but by the time the server returned to check on us, many in the group were already halfway through the meal.  

Overall, the experience was great, the service was great and the rest of the meal was great.  But, there's no excuse for a bad steak at a place with ""steak"" in the name, and especially not at a Michael Mina restaurant.  I'm on the fence whether I'll return, though the high ratings in general give me hope that my meal was an exception, not the rule.",VhRCFW-wZH6N42jlYs2R4Q,0,0,3,YDwTKph7D3HvO7DGtOKLaw

The decor was beautiful and modern. I almost felt like I was in a night club. This also means that there was music blasting throughout the restaurant. It was a little difficult to hear. My wife and i sat against the wall where they had a nice couch style bench and nice intimate tables for two.

Service was excellent though the waitresses in the short short skirts and low low blouses weren't necessary. The other serving staff members really looked nice and presentable. Even the manager got his hands wet by helping clear tables and attending to us when we had a question and our server was no where to be found.

We ordered from the Prix Fixe menu (three courses):
Both of us ordered the same appetizer and dessert. While we chose our own cuts of meat... One prix fixe was $55 and the other $65

Appetizer - Maryland Blue Crab Chowder
Entrees - Prime rib ($55) & Rib Eye ($65) both Angus beef
Dessert - Root beer floats w. chocolate chip cookies

We also ordered a side of mushrooms to share.

Everything was delicious. The chowder was different and interesting, a good start to dinner. The meat was good though a little tough considering the price. The rib eye was huge (18oz), I would opt for the prime rib next time. The root beer floats were okay... the sorbet was icy as you can imagine. The cookies included pistachios which we did not touch due to allergies (it would've been nice if the manager went out of his way to have cookies made w/o nuts for us).

The mushrooms were excellent and a very good serving size for two people. They were often over-powering the steak flavor though. The best part of dinner I thought was the three small sides that came with the steak: truffled mac n cheese, brussel sprouts, and creamed spinach. The brussel sprouts were amazing!

All in all, our dining experience was good. I would return to this restaurant and try something else on the menu anytime!",UyUJ2dAPVTwAELPV4dAqyw,0,0,4,3UV4NmFkRFJBMkBqoSZYWg
5959329,2011-02-16,2,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Steak? Yes please!

I can't get enough of good ol red meat. I have tried the lamb, ribeye and NY strip here. All to die for and all cooked to perfection. What sold me more than any of that were the sides. They were the best part of my meal. That's hard to do when there's a nice juicy steak sitting in front of me, but the brussel sprouts, mushrooms and french fries stole the show. 

All delicious, all the time. The vibe here is pretty great too. Perfect for out of town guests, a date with your honey or a family night out. This place is versatile and has a great atmostphere. The servers are all really friendly and helpful too. Come for happy hour, it's pretty groovy.

Definitely worth a trip to the strip.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,3,4,W06Yd3P7N9MchdldFjW0lQ

I had the 10oz filet and it was awesome. Be sure to get the potato gratin side, you will NOT be disappointed in this dish because it goes well with a steak or fish entree. Very friendly and accommodating staff that really added the finishing touch to the great food.

5968435,2016-05-02,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Big disappointment. Lovely place, noisy (we could barely talk at times), great service. My friend and I both had the Wagyu Filet for $79 each--the steak was very tender but was strangely under seasoned. And I've had grass fed steaks with better, and more flavor. Perhaps they expected you to invest another $6 in a sauce (a variety offered) but this doesn't provide a great wine pairing...

All the salt missing from the steak, and then some, was in the sides. We have the brussels sprouts (which were perfectly cooked which is rare) but too salty with the meat. And the scalloped potatoes. Both too salty!!!

5973508,2012-09-10,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I came for dinner with my husband and some friends the night before a 50 mile bike race, so i wasn't able to splurge the way I would have liked.  However, my meal and the mini teasing bites of steak that I did have were incredible.  

I ordered the chicken confit, which is served with a side of the truffle mac n cheese.  If this wasn't a steakhouse, then I would order it again in a heartbeat.  It was bursting with flavor.  My husband ordered the skirtsteak and i took a bite of it, and savored the flavorful tenderness.  On a previous visit, he ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye and he claims that it was the best steak he has ever had.  On this particular visit, he wasn't very hungry, hence the smaller order.  Our friends ordered the ribeye and the filet mignon, and they enjoyed every bite.  They shared the truffle mac n cheese sides and the spinach souffle.  Everything was devoured.  In fact, we practically had to tear the truffle mac n cheese bowl away from our friend before he started licking it clean. 

I also did try the 3 types of complimentary duck fat fried french fries and the accompanying sauces.  The truffle dipping sauce was heavenly.  I am surprised that I was able to restrain myself the way I did.  

The food isn't the only thing calling my name... So is the House made ROCK N' RYE cocktail.  Holy sweet mother of Jesus! This drink is amazing. It consists of Wild Turkey Rye infused with Rock Candy, Citrus & Aromatics. The flavors are melded together for 30 days before it is poured over one giant ice cube.  This alone is a 5 star cocktail.  I can't wait to return and have a whole glass to myself.  Or maybe even two. 

Reservations are a must! Be warned- it is quite loud at this restaurant.  It was a little difficult to have a conversation without leaning in to hear, but it is definitely a fun atmosphere.  I was disappointed with the Michael Mina restaurant in the Bellagio, but Chef Mina has been redeemed by STRIPSTEAK!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,3,0,5,vNFpMgjXO6ic5ld2IeRWkg
5975706,2015-06-23,1,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"Came here after a weekend of fun with a group of friends in desperate need of a steak for Meat Mondays. 

The place itself is beautiful. We sat at a booth that had ample room for 6. It's located close to the casino in their, for lack of a better word, strip mall. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the bone in rib eye steak and it was phenomenal. We got an assortment of sides that were delicious as well. The drinks were tasty and timely. 

The only reason I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars is because of the shoddy wait service. HOWEVER, the rest of the staff was amazing. Especially Paige who after hearing about our ordeal, was more than willing to help us out. She understood our issue and without hesitation assured me everything would be taken care of. 

After all was said and done we had a great night. We will absolutely return for some yummy steak and dessert.",M83yWwcobr9iNQuFOZmK0w,0,0,4,ovFKQtxpxmLg5x6L-V_wQw
5976689,2014-05-08,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I'll make this to the point

the bad:
1. There are much better restaurants in this price range, SW being one.
2. The food is overpriced for what you get.
3. Don't sit on the couches on the wall, they're way over used. The table was at my chest and had to ask to be moved.
4. The busser did the server's job, besides take orders.
5. The server didn't introduce herself nor welcome us to the restaurant (not being picky, but many patrons expect this when you're paying $130 per person.)
6. The hostess had to take our dessert order because the waitress was nowhere to be found, which is extremely irritating.
7. I had to send back the scotch I wanted because they gave it to me with cocktail ice. This is completely unacceptable for a $22 scotch.

The good:
1. The decor was very nice and not too bright or dark.
2. They give out free appetizers, french fries, which are pretty good.
3. The hostesses are very accommodating.
4. Decent beers and excellent wines.",5KzS8xgVJHOY1_L5XcraaA,0,0,2,F6FIPcoEqNy7YYPHg7WYDQ
5978002,2009-07-01,0,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"With all the steakhouse options in Vegas, do not waste your time with Stripsteak.  We were first seated in the bar at a lounge chair and a high table.  I have no idea how they expected us to eat a steak sitting at the kids table.  We were eventually able to move to a normal table and after a good 25 minutes, we got a waiter to come by and take some drink orders and we also placed our food orders.  I got a soup appetizer which was pretty good.  While waiting for the steaks, which arrived a good 35 minutes after appetizers, I started to feel sick and had to run to the restroom.  I'm not saying it was their fault, and I'm not saying it wasn't.  My wife finished her over salted steak while I was in the restroom being sick and the waiter and manager firmly told her that she had to pay the bill in full and they couldn't comp anything.  She never even asked for it, she just said I wasn't feeling well and probably wouldn't be eating my over salted undercooked steak (medium rare is a cool pink center, not raw and uncooked).  I'm not giving a bad review because I got sick or because they put a pound of salt on the steaks.  I'm giving them a bad review on how rude they were and made a big point to let everyone know that my sickness couldn't possibly be their fault.  I will definitely not be back.",8v8e9XUPFV8SaDb6P0OmfQ,1,0,1,KW4ch2LijT866tgkok7tbg
5984199,2012-12-27,2,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,"I give this place 2 stars because i didn't appreciate the service. My family of 4 went on a Monday night at 5:30pm. There were maybe one or two tables of customers, tops. But it still took them 10 minutes to seat us even though the restaurant was completely empty and we had a reservation. what?

we ordered 2 18 oz. rib eyes ($54 each), both paired with foie gras ($22 each) and bone marrow ($17). For sides, we got the bacon creamed spinach, trio of potato puree, and mushrooms ($14 each). The steak was delicious but the foie gras was really raw in the middle, the bone marrow was overly salted, and both the creamed spinach and mushrooms were mediocre. The potato puree was the only thing besides the steak that was yum. But everything was SO overpriced. $14 for some wilted spinach? meh. 

for dessert, we got the beignets with creme brulee and again, mediocre. I was really disappointed with the dessert. 

Our waitress didn't come in to check on us after she took our order except to bring us our wine, and as other tables trickled in, we saw that they all got complimentary french fries, which we did not receive, even though it showed up on our check as ""Amuse fries."" wtf, yo.
