Gave this sushi place a 2nd chance but ultimately they still haven't deliver, im not even sure if the mgt even reading the bad raps here. Theyre giving the boca park tasteless and cheap, poor quality of food, the atmosphere wasn't pleasant you can smell the oil of the foods theyre frying, unappetizing presentations, gooey tuna and fishy fished (argh!), most of all the service was just awful most esp. The sushi chef, its very forgiving that sometimes they forgot what you order esp if the place is really busy but on this case, we were only less than 5 customer that they have to cater, two of which just ordered ala carte so i dont think that what i order ""unagi sushi wasn't that hard to put, and the tempura is not served 20 minutes later, im not sure if he's doing it by purpose because not once or even twice he forgot the order and the thing that doesnt sit with me is the fact, that he looked annoyed when i reminded him. I mean if youre having a bad day, who isn't?! We are in darn fed shut down and i still managed or decided to eat on your awful resto. What im saying here, i am a paying customer and that attitude wasn't acceptable at all. Thanks for keeping me waiting and chose to take the order of the new customer whereas i already placed mine before he even sat, i just cancelled and called it a night. My 2 cents worth, eat at your own risks. Peaceout!",L59L8SPh1Qfp8pe0IX8rmw,0,0,1,me_AT7c1wrXmqRiPtYUfvg

The amount of fish on the rolls at this restaurant is NEGLIGIBLE!!  One roll had eel on it that was the same size of my baby fingernail!  It tasted fine, but the amount of food/fish is just terrible.  You are losing customers because you are so cheap with your ingredients!

408761,2013-07-23,1,FzY2g1J5IoMGmUDaw4ppFw,"Definitely not the best first impression I would have liked to have from a sushi restaurant, as when me and my girlfriend walked in we were welcomed with the smell of frying oil (that wasn't really fresh either). 

We opted for the AYCE,  priced at 24.99 at dinner (which would be reasonable, but more on that later). Unfortunately, a good number of the rolls we ordered were underwhelming to say the least. The avocado roll (which is one of my personal favorites when done correctly), looked more like a roll of rice with a tiny green vein of avocado running down the middle. The Aladdin roll, although sounding good on the menu, was drenched in a VERY garlicky ponzu sauce which just dominated the whole dish. I was also looking forward to the Jalepeno Popper roll, which was spicy tuna and fresh jalepeno fried tempura style. Quite possibly one of the blandest things I have ever eaten, sadly. Also, service was a tad on the slow side (granted one lady was working, the place had no more than 6 people in it at the time we were there).

Negatives out of the way, there were some tasty rolls to come our way. The Red Rock was particularly good (although not a traditional roll, more like a sushi ""lasagna"" with layers of rice and spicy tuna with tuna and avocado on top). Also, the Lion King roll was by far the highlight of the night, and one roll I would gladly order again.

Overall, I have to give this place a thumbs down for underwhelming sushi. As for the ""all you can eat"". They should really consider renaming it ""all you can eat in 2 hours"", because that rule is plastered at the top of the menu (I've been to quite a few restaurants that have an AYCE option. FIRST time I have ever seen that.). Kinda makes that 24.99 price tag a little heftier in my eyes.",HKwgvhNqMtLGLO-VhJNkqQ,2,0,2,XeikTpNkn22_2AS5e7y9YA

We absolutely LOVE this place for the quality of the fish and the warm hospitality. I must admit the service can be slow going at times when their volume is high but the overall experience has always been fantastic! 
We love the Garlic Tuna Nigiri, as the tuna is always fresh in smell, texture and taste. Their ponzu sauce is one of the best and we crave their Mimi and Aloha Specialty Rolls. 
The ambiance is quaint and relaxing. We also enjoy the fact that they're cleanly and the portions are just right. It's a great place for a casual date where conversation is the main event and not too shabby if you're dining alone as they also have flat screens and don't shy away from requests from the patrons.

1025438,2013-05-27,0,FzY2g1J5IoMGmUDaw4ppFw,"We ate there last night.  We eat here about 3 times per year.  The sushi with sauces tends to be ok.  They don't have a very big variety on their AYCE menu.  There are a lot of rolls on the menu, but if you look close most of them are very similar.  The sushi and nigiri without sauces tend to very very very dry.  The service is usually good, but if there is someone at the sushi bar that speaks Japanese, you will be ignored.  We were the only other customer other than the Japanese speaking customer last night.  The chef, the owner, and the waitress spent all their time talking to the Japanese speaking customer.  We waited much longer than normal to get our food.  If you are going to get AYCE, it's the best place I have found in Summerlin.  If anyone has found a better place, please let me know.

Do not order take out.  Even though they know me there, the take out is horrible.  If a roll comes with sauce, they will not put the sauce on the roll.  They are very hesitant to give you containers of sauce for the rolls that you pay for.",uPgj7UUo5BTErhAnzVV4Ww,1,0,3,fIN7ruvApHCiDwtxyunAcw
1125711,2014-05-12,0,FzY2g1J5IoMGmUDaw4ppFw,"First experience here, Mothers Day 2014 lunch: ""All you can eat"" 

The name of this restaurant should be ""Tokyoto Rice""

Service was friendly and attentive although drinks were never refilled. Each roll took 5-10 minutes to arrive with two chefs working and only two other groups in the restaurant. The sushi chef serving us was approximately 80 years old. Very little fish on top of rolls. Avocado was used sparingly.  Too much rice used for rolls. Nigiri had more rice than fish. Eel sauce was very thick and too sweet/ flavorless. Garlic Ponzu was very acidic. 
The ""Seafood Salad"" was a single piece of salmon, single piece of tuna, and a crab stick with ponzu. 
The ""Red Rock"" sealed it for me. It was a large patty of rice with a thin layer of crab in the middle and a thin smear of tuna on top (picture spreading jam on a piece of toast). Green Tea ice cream was not even that great. 

I'm trying to find something positive but this does not fly when there are excellent examples of AYCE in this city.

I've had sushi all over Vegas having lived here for 10 years. Tokyoto is unimpressive in practically every way. They switched recently to an AYCE menu so business must have been slow. That is quite an accomplishment given the location in Boca Park. This is one of the best locations for a sushi restaurant right in Summerlin, however this place has no appeal and no clientele. They need new management and new staff to survive.

I'm not going to give it away on this side of town but try Yama by UNLV. Or I Love Sushi in Henderson. For non AYCE always try Yummy on Lake Meade.",JvaazEOWOsRWB9ZJOJLReQ,2,2,1,QgxKT0-g8QZ_dbh5NkiewQ
1488706,2013-07-23,1,FzY2g1J5IoMGmUDaw4ppFw,"Should have left at the first moment we walked in, the place reeked of oil to almost an uncomfortable point. We decided to stay because we were pretty hungry. We opted for the AYCE which was a little bit pricier than some of the nearby places and actually limited to 2 hours which I have never seen. Would be outraged if this place was actually busy.  

This might be just semantics but Nigiri Sushi should be labeled as such and not just sushi to avoid confusion. I ordered the scallop nigiri sushi and was a bit upset that they couldn't have made it spicy since there were other add on's I could have had but spicy mayo was too much to ask for. 

The first few set of rolls we got were pretty pathetic, extremely small and no ""meat"" to them, especially the avocado roll. I respect ordering little by little but low quality and quantity. That's a no no. We learned quick that we had to order from the specialty rolls to get what you would normally expect of standard rolls. 

Also we had to ask for plates to eat our sushi as we were beginning to make a mess just using our napkin and the one plate the sushi was on. For awhile I thought we were going to have to retain an empty dish just so we had plates since it took us asking twice to get some. We also had to wait a long time for water to be refilled and it had to be asked with an order and more wait time.  

The Red Rock (Note: which is not a roll) and the Lion King Roll were the only pleasing ones out of our choices.

The place is a little cramped, but the sushi rolls make up for it. The dragon roll is my favorite,  hubby likes the tempura rolls.

I sat at the bar and it took 15-20 minutes between orders to get my sushi and there was only 3 other parties present. The waitress never came by to check for refills on my green tea. The Nigiri was tougher then I am used to but wasn't horrible. The rolls menu seems to be centered around alot of Tempera Battered ingredients. So if your trying to avoid the fried variety of sushi I would suggest going some place else. They limit lunch to a hour (which is usually fine for me) but with as slow the service is its chancy.

Hesitation wasn't unwarranted, it turned out.

Went in to order takeout. Opted for the rolly roll and the pink lady roll.
Sat at the sushi bar next to an AYCE patron. As I waited, he ordered and received 3 different rolls. This began to get annoying as I waited nearly 20 minutes for my order- restaurant wasn't busy, only two other tables were in and neither was actively ordering. One other person was waiting on a takeout order and waited longer than I did.
What really irritated me was realizing that my order sat at the counter for a good 10 minutes before the older waitress noticed and brought it to me.
And then I had to remind her to charge my card before I left. Service, needless to say, is lacking.

Food was okay.
Rolly roll was one of those rounded mounds of mixed rice and fish- I'm not a huge fan of that type of ""roll"" and though there was nothing wrong with the flavor, I was annoyed that the nontraditional roll structure was not mentioned on the menu when I ordered.
Pink lady roll was just okay- sauce did not taste like any garlic ponzu I've had and the salmon almost tasted cooked rather than fresh. Disappointing.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,7,2,URPkc3B3kqU32x8xJ-M_rA

I was completely disappointed. I couldn't even tell you how the fish tasted because there was barely any fish. Every roll was rolled the size of a nickel. And no flavor. At that point after seeing my boyfriends rolls (and they were just as tiny and not any flavor) I ordered 5 more rolls just to get my moneys worth and still left hungry

Not one thing we ordered stood out to be amazing. Service was quick but I would hope so, there was only us and 2 others in the whole place. I would rather go to a place, pay a little bit more money for fresh AYCE that isn't greasy and bit size.",vulPfJ5Q8Hg9nXaKezigfw,0,0,2,ElGYtSGdYDRF4Plu8EUlDg

3014563,2010-02-18,0,FzY2g1J5IoMGmUDaw4ppFw,"A couple months ago after arriving from a small island busting with Asian cuisine, I searched for a new sushi spot to land on for the remainder of our stay in Vegas. Moving to a new place requires you to find a suitable regular spot for particular tastes, and I needed a new sushi bar to call home.

Going up Charleston Boulevard toward the Red Rock Casino--because we heard about their Japanese restaurant in the hotel--we came across an area with a Target, Vons, and restaurants. One in particular is a small place called Tokyoto, and because of it's quaint exterior, I asked my spouse to pull over. We drove up to the place at 11 in the afternoon, easily finding parking to eat inside.

We walked through the door, which was separated by a wooden Japanese-like divider--and turned the brief corner to find a sushi bar that looked like home. Tokyoto has a traditional sushi bar with the fish displayed along the counter and a chef--headband and knife--ready to make your dream roll. We sat at the bar for our first experience, although there were many tables open, and looked at their menu. We learned that in Vegas you get a paper and mark your order, then hand it to the chef. What we're used to is telling him directly what to make, but respectfully. I decided to go that direction.

After ordering tempura, tempura rolls, and some new rolls I've never heard of--I assume they're made for American tastes--we were excited to see that the beauty of sushi making is preserved in this sushi bar. We started on our tempura, which was light, flaky, and had great taste, and ate the sushi. I have to be honest--I was expecting the same fantasic rolls as I find on Guam--and although the sushi is not as great in Vegas as it is at home, it was pretty darn close.

Tokyoto is as close as it gets for me personally to real sushi. We tried the hotel sushi, and although good and traditional, the taste wasn't as great for some reason. Tokyoto's, however, has beautiful fish and great rolls. From our experience so far, all sushi bars have the same menu for sushi and tempura, but for some reason this place had excellent food and service.

Not like burnt toast smoke, but cigar smoke which can be very unappealing when you're trying to eat. I realized when we left that the restaurant is located next to a cigar shop - they must share a vent or something. 

The food took FOREVER to come out. It was 2 PM and there were a total of 3 occupied tables! I don't know why it was taking so long, but I heard another table complaining. When we finally got our food it wasn't that that bad. My mom and I each had a combination lunch with teriyaki, tempura and 4 california rolls. The teriyaki was ok, a little on the sweet side. The tempura was so heavily battered that it was more like fish & chips than the traditional lacy tempura. They also give you about 3 tablespoons of rice to go with your meal. I didn't try my grandma's nabeyaki udon, but she had the same problems with the extra crispy tempura.

The seaweed salad was old, shrimp tempura was tough with a thick batter, and the mussels were also tough and neither any of these were edible at all. The sushi rolls should have been called rice rolls but at least they were edible. The only thing that we liked was the miso soup but who goes wrong on that?

The service didn't help their case either. Our server, well, she was the only server there, was very arrogant and rude. She wanted us to finish every little thing on our plate, mind you, we can hardly eat anything we ordered. 

We should have known better as we were the only ones in there on a Saturday. We were out the door 45 minutes later, hungry and disappointed. Such a waste of money and time.

It gets one star because the fish wasn't bad, but we barely got enough to say we were eating sushi. We did AYCE for lunch on a Saturday, not many people there. 

We are nigiri kind of people and rarely ever order a roll.  Everything we ordered was all rice and a sliver of fish.  The rice needed work too.  When we asked for tobiko he said he only gets it once a year. Lol. OK I'll just keep going to the other places who have it all the time. 

In hopes that we could find something positive to say we ordered some things from the kitchen. The shrimp tempura was warm not hot and the batter tasted as if it came from a box.  The agedashi tofu was anything but.  It was just two fried pieces of tofu sitting on a small puddle of ponzu...not even the right sauce guys. Tonkatsu was thin pieces of pork and really tough. It looked as skimpy as the fish. So I'm sorry to say nothing was good.

3736535,2015-01-23,0,FzY2g1J5IoMGmUDaw4ppFw,"We ate there this week. The only positive thing I can say is that the dining area seemed clean. That's it. 

In case you didn't know, this restaurant was on dirty dining. Closed down in October 2014 for health inspection fails and then reopened the next week, barely. I think 45 demerits or something insanely high. To get you up to speed: it should probably still be shut down. 

Service: really bad. I ordered a meal that came with soup, specifically asked her if I could have clear soup instead of miso, she didn't understand and just kept saying ""yes miso soup!"" And then never ever brought any kind of soup at all. But it was ok because I decided shortly after my food came that it would be unwise to eat anything more anyway. She also took about a thousand years to bring things to the table, including the check. And she served sushi to the table without any wasabi. 4 people were eating sushi and after having to ask for wasabi, she came back with a tiny ball for them to share. 

I was afraid of the sushi after knowing about the dirty dining shut down. (My friends made me eat there. I should've been stronger in my refusal.) I ordered teriyaki chicken. She brought me a huge plate of teriyaki chicken, steak, and salmon. The rice was fried, which isn't the norm for Japanese places but I'll look past that. The meats were all room temp and the teriyaki sauce was questionable. Lord only knows when it was made or how it was stored. The chicken was spongey, which I think is an indication that it has been stored improperly, and it didn't look cooked all the way. I couldn't tell for sure though because the lights in the restaurant are pink so it's impossible to tell the true color of the meat. Honestly. 

I stopped eating the chicken and stuck to the cold beef and the overcooked, dry salmon. My husband, who actually got just the chicken he ordered only ate his rice. My friends ordered sushi and said it was fine but I really really don't believe them. I braved up and tried some sushi- the spicy tuna in the middle was brown colored. I don't think that's normal. 

Long story short, my husband and I shelled out $90 between our food and the babysitter for a terrible dinner and I was sick before we got home and visited the bathroom a few times that night. Thanks, guys.",5gVLjO3wqplXr6IBuK5Vgg,1,0,1,m6l_n-u1B-7saBYa-KTWiQ

Lots of choices for rolls, and honestly the Monkey Roll (or something with a similar name, it's been awhile) is one of the tastiest rolls I've had in awhile. I'm partial to things with fatty/spicy tuna, and the tuna was fresh and tasty.

I don't remember what the boyfriend had, but I remember it had cucumber and tenkasu on top. Also delicious (I tried to steal it after eating my own roll).

We had a few other things (tempura, soup, etc) and they were all very good for the price. 

We went at lunch and it wasn't too crowded (the place is sorta by itself in a shopping center and it is rather small). Prices are also better at that time.

4974741,2008-03-13,0,FzY2g1J5IoMGmUDaw4ppFw,"One thing I love about Japanese restaurants, you can always find a decent bento box lunch for an inexpensive price.  It usually leaves you satisfied without breaking the budget.  And if they treat you well during this midday meal, you're more likely to come for dinner and try their sushi too.  (I do hate how many of them close for business in between that lunch and dinner hour though, which luckily, isn't the case with Tokyoto.)

Located next to Caffe Gelato in the Bocapark Mall, you walk into this pleasant and bright Japanese restaurant.  The sushi bar takes center state with tables all around.  The BF and I grab a table facing the TV (behind the sushi bar), so we can watch the baseball game.

Our waitress brings us the menus and takes our beverage orders.  It's not long before she returns with our tea and complimentary suno mono (cucumber salad).  

My choice for today is their Lunch Special #1 which is Chicken Teriyaki, Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura, and California Roll ($7.95).    The BF gets their Lunch Special #4, which is Tonkatsu, Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura, and California Roll ($9.95).  (Rice and miso soup automatically comes with all the lunch specials.)

When our orders arrive, we are both pleasantly surprised with their generous portions.  A nice heaping side salad also accompanied our bento box (with a carrot-based dressing?).  Six pieces of CA roll instead of the pictured three pieces and five pieces of tempura - shrimp, onion, potato, zucchini, and carrot were presented before us (along with our chicken teriyaki or tonkatsu).  

We were initially thinking of adding a roll to our order since they had some unique ones that piqued our interest.  But after seeing our order come out, we knew we couldn't finish it all.

Service was good, our waitress was very pleasant and refilled our beverages as needed.  A steady stream of customers started coming in a little after noon on this Friday, so it started to fill up slowly. 

Overall, we had a pretty good experience based on their lunch bento box.  A solid 3.5 stars.  

We'd definitely return to try out some of their unique rolls like the ""Who Your Daddy?"" roll (Spicy Yellowtail inside, Yellowtail and Jalapeno on top with Ponzu sauce $13.50) and the ""Heart Attack"" roll (Spicy Tuna, Cream Cheese, Jalapeno, & Deep Fried with House Sauce $9.50).",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,7,4,4,E8gXZPLekmUFxgCP6IHu8w
