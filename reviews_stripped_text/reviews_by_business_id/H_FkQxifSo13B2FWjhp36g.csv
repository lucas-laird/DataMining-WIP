10858,2011-06-02,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"Besides Tao, this was another Venetian hotel restaurant that I did some research and looked forward to experiencing. Also; I think Mario Batali is one of the least obnoxious Chefs on the Food Network AND I LOVE, LOVE GOOD AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FOOD!! It also reminds me of past travels abroad. 

Simulated outdoor dining ha! Your view is a pretty good replica of St. Mark's square in Venice, ahem... minus the Cathedral, sexy Italian guys, and pigeon poop LOL! 

I like to eat earlier rather than later in the evening (better for your health) so I did not have to wait for a table at 5:30PM. Before I talk about what I ate I have to share that while waiting for my libation; I saw that there was a crowd gathering and I noticed that they were mesmerized by a damn Mime that was supposed to look like an ancient, white, venetian statue. The Venetian Hotel was playing along, with strategic lighting and a platform for her to stand on. Of course she only moved when a tourist gave her some money - and then they took pics standing next to the sham. I totally detest that kind of shiz but did not let it upset my appetite and just laughed at how funny people are *rolling eyes* 

MMMMmmmmmmm okay here were go: 

I actually chose starters again but all were so delicious and are ranked by delectability below: 

Fried Risotto Balls = OMG! I forgot the actual menu name, but I think you get like 4 of them for $9. Imagine if you will; warm, cheesy risotto rolled into a ball and flash fried to a crunchy golden brown. Non greasy goodness and they were gone within a blink. 

Prosciutto di Parma = Dry cured ham that melts in your mouth. This is not your down stream prosciutto but actually imported from a little but well know town of Parma. To learn more about why I had to try this specialty: http://www.italyinsf.com/2008/10/21/prosciutto-di-parma/ 

Roasted Beets with Saba = Even if you are not a beet fan, this is a pleasing, light and healthy balance to the fried risotto balls. I was happy to see their choice of yellow and orange beets instead of the same ol boring red. The roasted flavor is immediate and the Saba, which is a cooked grape juice really made it pop, another good choice. 

I'm actually going back to the Venetian in a few days and will plan on trying their squash blossoms, grilled radicchio w/ smoked mozzarella and braised pork shoulder. Stay tuned!",CTgIqlxjeux21arF8MS0ww,0,0,4,TMLusXE9VqBXYs0LC4Zzlw

The quality and consistently of food,service and atmosphere is remarkable. The pasta dishes are superb and very authentic.  My favorite pasta is the beef cheek ravioli. The vegetable dishes are imaginative and .unique. I tried the cauliflower with olives and orange zest,eggplant caponata,and peperonata.  The main courses are also terrific. We dined there on 12/24/11 and enjoyed the seafood fra diavolo. The seafood was cooked to perfection , and the sauce/seafood broth was outstanding.

105787,2012-08-16,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"This place is amazing!

The reason I say this is because we went in expecting the worst and left wowed. 

Let me explain a little, my family and I had been walking around all over the strip since 10 am, tired, hungry and irritated, around 6pm we finally stopped and chose the first place we saw to eat. Im a big foodie and didn't even notice this was Iron Chef Mario Batali's Restaurant (yeah, I was THAT tired). 

First thing I have to say is that the Olive Oil they bring out with the bread (ask for bread service, not only is it delicious, its free!) is amazing, easily the best and the most flavorful olive oil I have ever tasted. What I recommend is to order a few different dishes and share amongst your party, italian style after all! We ordered the Pancetta and Goat Cheese, I'm not a big pizza person but boy was this delicious I couldn't stop eating it (The pizza's here can easily be shared by 2 people) We also ordered the Penne alla Norma, very tasty! But the real winner of this meal was the Marinated Chicken Paillard!! I HIGHLY recommend ordering this when eating here, it cannot be missed! AMAZING is the only word I can use to describe this dish, I still crave it each and everyday and so does the rest of my family! I could not figure out why this meal was so great and flavorful, this meal had a special quality about it that I couldn't put my finger on, but then I turned around and I saw, very discretely, Mario Batali's name and I quickly understood why this was a high quality meal. 

Thank you Chef Batali, I praise you for this glorious meal. 

Everything about the meal was perfection (service was so-so though, that is until it was time to leave the tip! wink-wink) The atmosphere is also great, feels like your outside and they have some great entertainment. I will most defiantly be back on my next trip!",BIScwSZTGtyqwzhscnlzrQ,0,1,5,ZqAUKBXCLB_D36MdcCIkYQ

We've never had an experience better even at other fine dining places in Vegas.  It was a one time hit for us and hopefully the next time would be the same.

Our food choices:
Octopus salad was great, a little spicy and not that chewy just like the server described.  The Pork shoulder was enjoyable. The fried mashed potato was amazing.  The potatoes were just slightly crushed so the center can get fried too.

My main course was a goat cheese and pancetta pizza which was not bad, but the tomato sauce taste like Hunt's tomato paste straight from the can. My gf had a plate of linguini and mussel and saffron, she liked it ok. The busboy was really nice and friendly. Ambiance is good.

Me grumpy - replied that we were ready to order.  Waiter very calmly replied, yes, but what would you like to drink.  So then from that point, service was great.  Food came out quickly.   We ordered the margherita pizza with buffalo mozzarella - crust was perfect crispy but chewy too, sauce flavorful, mozzarella slightly smokey.   Also had caprese salad - expected balls of mozzarella and cut up tomatoes that you get at supermarket, but this was so good with soft mozz cheese, herbs, olive oil.  I've never raved about caprese salad before.  Now in retrospect, I liked the waiter - seem so European, no apologies, lunch should be enjoyed not rushed.

141394,2014-01-06,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"I had two occassions to visit Otto recently. The first was a 5-star lunch that exceeded our expectations.  Two of us shared appetizer portions of brussel sprouts and gnocci fritters.  The sprouts were absolutely delicious, and were quickly consumed.  The gnocci fritters were frankly weird, and reminded us of ballpark fare.  After the appetizers, we had two salads.  My wife had a mixed green salad with balsamic vinegar and prosciotto.  I had the octopus salad with celery and potatoes.  Both were excellent.  

On a later occassion, and needing a quick meal, we revisited Otto for lunch.  This time, it was only a 3.5 star experience.  Service was adequate, and the food was fine, but lacked flavor.  We each had a salad (good) and shared a clam pizza.  I am a fan of seafood pizzas because they provide so much flavor... not this one.  It was undercooked and bland, regrettably.

Overall, this is probably a 4-star restaurant.  I hope that your experience more resembles my first time rather than my second time.",gSbi3GJbGxlxv18gSIticQ,0,0,4,Z_pKGuGsxLc3DgmQYi6cfg

The dessert was tdf. Mama Mia! Defo go here for the dessert called ""Dark Chocolate"". It has a gorgeous little rich chocolate lava type cake with dark choc gelato, salty caramel gelato, and a blow torched soft gooey meringue topping. Omg. I'm salivating just remembering the dessert! I will go back for this dessert. The price of this dessert and the wine (we only went for a cheaper 250ml portion of red to share...can't remember which one...for about $15) are reasonable, especially considering that we had an operatic floor show in fake St Mark's Square.

197750,2013-04-12,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"Ok, where to start.  Figured I wanted casual italian from a celebrity chef, and made the family walk from the Cosmopolitan to the Venetian for what I heard would be a better meal then Scott Conant's  DOCG Enoteca (especially any fish based on what two 'foodies' had told me).  All I can say is big mistake, BIG MISTAKE!  The atmosphere at the Venetian - well designed and entertaining (despite being older then some of the newbies) - was worth the walk but the food was ok, sub-par if you consider that the menu and items were done in conjunction with a  celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  There was not one item ordered (except the Penne alla Norma) that was up and beyond what I get locally in a Detroit suburb's italian restaurant.  We started with 3 Verdure dishes (olives, beets in saba, and farro verde) - the farro was good, but the other two tasted grocery store bought level at most (lacked depth and uniqueness) never again. Next I ordered another item recommended by the server - Insalte la supurba (I think), marinated tuna and white anchovy salad - what a disaster, not only did the tuna lack any kind of oomph or upgrade from Starkist albacore white, the anchovy (white, house cured) lacked character and carried an unusual stench rendering it inedible for me.  The salad was returned only after one bite and I genuinely feared furthering my culinary adventures here.  Thank god my wife had ordered a spring pasta(the only pasta made in-house) with english peas and vegetables, that was acceptable - otherwise I would have rated the place as a solid one star eatery.  Not all is bad here, the location (in the middle of the 'Piazza de Marco' (of the Venetian Hotel)) is outstanding all it needed was a few pigeons to complete the experience - but in retrospect, we should have ventured to Wolfgang Puck's place just a few steps away then waste a Franklin on something not worth the mile walk on the Vegas strip.",xvg3lgJ-tZFBcbSZNn08Vw,1,0,2,fQBn1Gtttm7bP59BFeHuNw

213410,2012-11-13,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"Context:
This  was the last thing we did on our way out of town after a chaotic weekend visiting family in from the east coast. I don't gamble and I am not a fan of Vegas culture, but I had hoped this meal would be a deperature from the slick and tacky and over the top.  I was looking forward to an authentic, quiet meal in a kitchy, yet relaxing (by vegas standards) environment. 

First Ominous Impressions:

The whole meal started off badly. We waited nearly twenty minutes for our order to be taken, even though the restaurant was half empty.  The music was grating and loud (this, coming from someone whose boyfriend has a gold album from his punk band) and it clashed horribly with the music coming from Saint Mark's square. When I come to an Italian place, I really do want Italian music, either Italian classical or opera or Italian modern or vinatge pop, or hell, Sinatra in a pinch, but not whatever that awful American meathead stuff was that was blaring from the speakers.

The Meal, the goodish bits:  

 Once we were seated, the staff were kind and attentive, and my Venetian Spritzer was refreshing and balanced. The fried squash blossom was pretty good, and reminded me of the ones my great grandmother used to make, but the rice flour batter got too chewy very quickly and the frying oil tasted old. 

The Meal, the horror show: 

The vegetable plates came out discolored and overcooked and yet, ice cold (should have been room temp) and soggy with oil. My boyfriend nearly broke a tooth on a stone in the farro (but refused to complain, because he is exceedingly polite). But the worst were the pastas! They were so salty that it was actually painful to eat them. Even my boyfriend agreed to tell the truth when the server came by to ask about our meals.  We were told our pasta was salty because the pasta water is salted. Um...I salt my pasta water at home, with a generous handful of salt, and I love salt so very much, but this tasted like a full tablespoon in the finish of a single, small (23 dollar) portion. Even after we got our pastas back, they were still like a salt lick. I'm not entirely convinced they did anything different at all, and with a fairly spendy price tag, I'd hoped for something actually edible.

Overall Experience: 

This meal was a disgrace, made even more crushing because I adore Mario Batali's show and personality (and, swoon, that red beard!). I had such high hopes, but my dear Italian grandmothers are spitting in their graves. 

Mario, do you read these reviews? Do you understand that this experience was supposed to be a high note for us? A redemption? The sole tasteful experience of a weekend in hell, I mean, Las Vegas? Meals create memories...and this memory is 
tarnished.",NFL5GTMS7muJPwa6ylhBXA,1,0,1,DPxf3pIZzudkvUWR7tWfUg

Have some cheese - I highly recommend the taleggio. It is fantastic by itself and even better with the honey, cherry, or apricot they bring out with the cheese. I got the cheese both times it was just so good.
The fried cauliflower was hands down the best fried cauliflower I've ever eaten.  It didn't need any dipping sauce, just a little lemon juice that's it.
They make their own ricotta in house and you can tell. 
We got great wine recommendations from our waiter. 
Of the 4 main courses I've seen/eaten not one was disappointing. The spaghetti and meatballs was simple and tasty. The veal meatballs on polenta I will definitely have to have next time I go.",nrinz-D7RwiFs8zIpeAAaQ,0,0,5,Ak9hPVaOOmiFG9uYRpBwqA

Out-of-towners who have never eaten at a Batali joint will go ""ooh"" and ""aah.""  For the rest of us, this place can be skipped.  Go to Il Mulino instead.  The lunch crowd at I Mulino (at Caesar's Forum Shops) is non-existent, so it's easy to get a table and experience some really good Italian food.

This place was seriously crowded on a Sunday night in the off season.  So we knew that it was either (1) really good or (2) a sucker for tourists from the Midwest.  Sadly, we found out it was the latter.

The olives were great, and the wine selection was super.  The salumi platter offers a nice choice except . . . when you order ""all five of the salumi"" you get two versions of head cheese.  Now we are not sqeamish but we had no idea that two of the five would be head cheese and frankly . . . head cheese tastes like DOG CRAP.  (No, we've not tasted dog crap, but we have a pretty good idea of what it must taste like.)  We gobbled up the other three and nudged the waiter a bit ""Hey, what the heck was that stuff?  Was that head cheese?""  He says, ""Yep.""  We said, ""We're not fans of head cheese.  We sure wish you would have told us it was on the platter.""  He giggles and says, ""Huh, Huh, yeah, not many people like that stuff after they order it.  Huh, huh, huh.""  (Note to self - kick waiter next time he chuckles at you and doesn't bother to offer a credit.)

The pasta dishes were ho hum.  Again, if you want really good sauces, go to Il Mulino.  And Rao's is great too, if you can get in (also at Caesar's, but in the main section.)

We skipped the rest of the meal and instead grabbed some gelato at the little kiosk just outside of the restaurant.

Food:
Our starter was a three cheese plate with Gorgonzola Dolce, Pantaleo, and Robbiola Bosina. The fruit paring it came with was amazing.

Our salad was a beautiful greens salad topped with Pecorino and more importantly a fantastic piece of Prosciutto.

We had to ask for olive oil and bread separately, as some people have complained. Personally, I don't see the problem. It was high-end olive oil and I can understand them being a bit conservative.

My dinner plate was the real reason I went there though. I wanted scratch made pasta and the server informed me that only a few dishes that had that. Consequently, I ordered the Maccherona and it was perfect. Once you've had fresh made pasta, everything else pales in comparison. Kudos to the chef.

For dessert we split a gelato trio that punctuated a great dinner.

Service:
Excellent.
Surprisingly, we were able to walk up without reservations at 7pm and were still able to get a seat in under 10 minutes.
Our server was very attentive and was very knowledgeable about wine.

Ambiance:
I will admit it's very European in the close proximity of the tables, but this is the Venetian so I'll chalk it up to ""authenticity."" We were seated outside and although a but busy, was nice because of the live performers across the way.",SnV5kJ_ywEsdSTQca1KHZw,1,1,5,T169GrZgj0axgSrEpReADA

So here are the things that I did not like in Mario Batali's restaurant
1) Gnocco fritto is supposed to be served with meats and cheeses not alone! If you don't believe me check out 
Wikipedia http://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnocco_fritto#section_1 
... I know you can't read Italian but just look at the picture! There is salami next to it!... You could get it right if you order Gnocco fritto for 9 $ then a couple of cured meats for 20$ and one cheese for 5$ but it gets pretty expensive for an appetizer!
2) mozzarella di bufala was subpar at best. I'm actually fairly sure it was just plain mozzarella, not bufala !
3)the pizza had a gallon of oil on top. Seriously it was was  dipping! I've had better pizzas (even in the states!)
4) my husband got spritz and was perplexed... He thought the mix of wine/aperol was Not right (and usually there is not olive in it even thou i googled it and found out that one version of spritz has olive in it so maybe this is what they were going for.)

Here is what I liked:
1) prosciutto di Parma and bresaola were good
2) my husband seemed pleased by his pasta with clams even If it was quite spicy
3) the honey served with the mozzarella was good

So, overall...food was ok but since it's a famous chef and all I expected more... Maybe Mario batali could take another trip to Italy? And pick up better titles for his books (Molto gusto sounds pretty weird!)",tpmNjVR08NPd0Y9awhFxug,0,0,3,Ht2NNMl0BATicDZyVZc9YA

We made a reservation a day before, get to the restaurant and it was clear by the hostess' reaction they weren't expecting us. It was clear they made a makeshift table for our party...in the hallway. 

There were people coming and going and it felt we were in their way. My dad had politely requested a clearly open table, and was told it had already been reserved for a larger table. The table stayed open for a while, only to be filled by a party our exact same size. 

After seeing this my dad again, politely, requested a table that wasn't in the middle of the hallway. We were eventually told they could accommodate us, then we waited. And waited and waited some more. We ended up waiting an hour and sipped on cheap yet overpriced wine. We finally had enough and then packed our things and left when we realized not only would we not be moved to another table we were purposely not going to be served because of our table request. 

We left an hour after we were ""seated"" in the hallway. When we let the manager and hostess know we were leaving, without making any sort of scene, they threw their hands up in the air emphatically as if to insinuate our leaving was our own problem.

The table was small and the waiter just dropped everything on it and left.  We had to put everything plate in order ourselves.  This is terrible service!  Food sucks too, the salad was not very impressive.  The pizza was baked hours ago and served dead cold.  The pork shoulder was the only dish that i would recommend for the night.  

Another interesting point to note was the waiter came over asked ""how's everything?"".  He literally was gone before he finished asking.

I was in Venice last month, and it is a very modern smaller version of San Marco Square, non-the-less it was a perfect spot for the restaurant of the infamous Mario Batali. 
This will always be memorable, because my parents are locals of Vegas, so they were meeting us here for lunch.  Meeting my BF for the very first time, so yes I was nervous. So he ordered a bottle of red wine knowing that a glass would help me. 
I have to say, that I was never a big fan of Italian food and perhaps I take that after my father.  So I was a little apprehensive that my dad would not enjoy his lunch with us. Fortunately everything we ordered was a hit.  We started w/ arugula salad... my favorite. But you can't go wrong with that, it's pretty simple. We also shared  a margharita pizza as an appetizer.  I love that it's thin crust. It was delicious. Both my dad and BF ordered the steak. My mother had the lasagne, and I ordered the grilled succulent pork chop.  We all shared a bite of everyone's main entree, and they were all incredibly yummy!  Our desert was sundae of 4 different gelati. coffee, pistachio, caramel, and chocolate.  Sinfully good! Our friendly waiter was very patient and attentive.  And best part was my parents enjoyed their lunch and getting to know my bf. It was sort of preliminary rendevous to get a taste of where my parents were off to... they were getting ready to leave for Europe... They are about to spend the entire summer in Italy... primarily Venice. So how cool was that?",rBRuie_HNzxCkMDF-ooRog,0,0,5,KIx7muPNTawl_awYowIsGA

Braised pork shoulder - the The first one we received was fatty and overcooked.  We ended up sending it back to the kitchen. The second time they served it to us was definitely a better cut of meat was a proper temperature, but really lacked overall taste.

Carbonara Pizza - this was simply OK. Didn't wow us and really wasn't that hot. I have had much better pizzas even at California pizza kitchen.

Black Ink Pasta - temperature was good on this one it tasted OK. It really lacked flavor.

Veal Meatballs on Palenta - this was a good helping size. The temperature was very good on these. But again lacked overall taste. I wasn't impressed.

Carrot Side Dish - oddly enough, this was my most favorite part of the entire meal and it's a side dish!. They were perfectly cooked tasted absolutely fantastic and I could've made a meal of them all alone by themselves.

To wrap it up, the service was excellent but the kitchen just didn't deliver the food. I've had way better meals for $120 tab than I had last night. It was just OK.

The cheeses were served with black truffle honey, macerated apricots and cherries.  Wow!  The cheeses and accompaniments were amazing.  The sandwich was good and quite rich.

We decided to go with pizza as our main course.  I chose pacetta and goat cheese and my wife ordered the pepperoni.  The pizzas were good.  Mine was on the salty side and mellowed out by the slightly sweet sauce and the richness of the goat cheese.  My wife's was basically an upscale pepperoni pizza.  We opted to pass on dessert.

So how does this deserve 4 stars?  It was upon our return the next evening.  We asked to be seated with Chad and he delivered once again.  We started out with the same cheese plate as before.  Equally delicious.  I opted to go for the Vongole pizza (olive oil sauce, mozzarella, clams and chili).  The pizza came to the table with the clams still in the shells.

I read some of the reviews commenting on the pizza not being good and I completely disagree. I was in Italy last summer for three weeks and the food at Otto's is as close to true authentic Italian cuisine as I have found in the U.S.A. The problem is that most Americans eat Americanized Italian food not true Italian food.  In italy chicken comes on the side and never smothered in cheese or sauce. I love the bellini's at Otto's. For people who have never tried a Bellini, it is the national drink of Venice. I also love the pizza at Otto's, it is light and flavorful just like Italy. American pizza is smothered with cheese, not Italian pizza. It's too hot in Italy to eat heavy meals. On saturdays they make homemade lasagna which is light and delicious, one of my all time favorite dishes at Otto's.  Make sure to leave room for the gelato which is also very authentic to Italy. Real Italian gelato should be light and airy and bursting with flavor and that's exactly what you get at Otto's.

712892,2012-03-28,1,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"Dear Mario,

Being a retired chef and visiting LV on business with the family and being Italian, I couldn't resist visiting The Venetian and visiting Mario's restaurant.
 
Really cool spot, Mario. We requested to be seated in the piazza area, but were told it was full, but would try to get a table out there. well, after 10 minutes, we were told it couldn't be done. Big surprise. We then were escorted to the back dining room area . Nice room with wine bottle decor and a very smart elegant atmosphere. Loved the taste of the room. That was great, Mario. 

I don't know how to tell you this, Mario, but I'll try stating my overall experience with all the respect and admiration I have for you. 

We ordered the penne dishes and the Taliatelli dish for my daughter and had the cheese appetizers.  Pasta was prepared adequately and tasted great. No problem, except portions were extremely small compared to the other Italian restaurants we've visited in LV.  So small in fact that we all stopped at another restaurant within an hour because we were all hungry still.  Unheard of from an Italian restaurant where the food at the table is abundant.  Ok, so you have ambiance.  

Other issues.

When we were seated in the dining room, there was already a full table of 6 people having dinner and were sometimes too loud for the room.  No biggie.

Then after a half hour or so, servers were scrambling to put 4-5 tables together for about 20 people who had shown up.  In this small room? Are you kidding? Since this room was small these people were very loud and disturbing to everyone.  So much so, I couldn't hear the server explaining the desserts on the menu.  It was so disturbing, we chose to leave the second we were finished with the entree. 

We were sorry we didn't do 'Trattoria Reggiano' on the way in.  The food looked out of this world and everyone seemed to be having a great time.

In short, nice place, but needs some work on the portions, selections and stuffing about 40 noisy people into a small room.  Server should have moved us out before.  And Mario, no Gnocchi or Cavatelli or Lasagna on the menu?? Whaa??

Very disappointed with our initial visit and will probably not visit your restaurants.

Best wishes,

Sincerely, Sal Carone",9j_dACHgTcB-mZFwaOMu2g,2,1,1,_ZykjzJXl7NXu9slL1hrlQ

Ours had a heavy hand when it came to being almost over fried, but the batter did have a slight heat to it, which was appreciated.  The gnocchi was dense with a flavorful tomato sauce.  The mozerella alla caprese, comprised of mozzarella, pesto, pine nuts and tomatoes seemed fresh and was fresh tasting.  The penne alla Norma was also well received.  Unfortunately, dessert brought salted caramel gelato that lived up to its name as it had large bits of sea salt that weren't entirely welcome and harsh.  The olive oil gelato was silky and definitely interesting.  Overall, our meal was pleasant, but sadly, lacking the finishing touches that should be a Mario standard.

the pasta was great! cooked perfectly, cute little meat balls.  good sauce.
the caprese salad was awesome, they fire roasted the toms because it's january and real tomatoes are out of season.   
we also had the brussels and speck which was amazing.  the sprouts were carmelized without being mushy and the speck was nice and only a little smokey.  a little dash of vinegar really livened it up.

If you have not had water buffalo mozzarella (bufala), it's much more buttery (higher fat content) than american mozzarella--a different animal altogether (no pun intended).   The crust, because it's DOC, was also magnificent-- thin, crispy to the last bite, and you could taste the wood fire in it.  Just wonderful.

There was live music playing on the courtyard stage which was very pleasant.

We were given three small pieces of bread or as Al Bundy would have called them ""toaster leave'ems"". We asked for olive oil which helped. I was ravenous by this point because it took a good ten minutes to read over the extensive wine and cocktails list. 

My quattro formaggio pizza was meh.  It tasted like those Kashi pizzas sans the fiber aspect that makes it tolerable because it's good FOR you. There were no spices used in the sauce at all. However the cheeses were delicious. I enjoyed my (yes, you read it right MY) bottle of Prosecco Flur. It was not too sweet and a nice bubbly to accompany the ""meal"". The saving grace of the evening was their dessert--their dark chocolate cake with whipped salted caramel, toasted vanilla meringue, and dark chocolate malt gelato was utterly sinful.

986368,2014-02-07,2,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"I have been in search of 3 things in this town. 

1. Good Service 
2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home. 
3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.

The Service
We decided to eat at the busiest time in the evening so much of the issues with the service were understandable. In fact we were there right after a large convention let out on Tuesday. The hostess was very nice and was able to seat us at the bar which ended up saving us from a long wait. Once at the bar we received our water and menus. Later the bread and oil made its way to the table/bar. Our waiter was as attentive as he could be seeing that the place was crazy busy. 

The Food
We had a salad, rice balls, and the pork raviolis, and of course bread and oil. The salad was so simple it didn't inspire me to want to finish it. The rice balls were just tasteless. And the raviolis had a processed taste to them which wasn't too bad but I could definitely make better ones at home. Bottom line...if you have to eat here just get the bread and oil with a nice over priced glass of wine.

The Experience
Unfortunately poor Otto's gets a one star because the food just didn't pass the ""Can I make this better at home test"" plus the price was not in line with the taste. The portions were all out of line with what a normal human consumes at dinner which made us search for a hefty desert after we left. Thank god the Venetian has tons of places to get a tasty desert. I mean it's amazing what a tasty treat can do to make you forget about an tastless dinner. 

Here is a tip for the management!
The view of all the goings on in the court yard at the Venetian is priceless. And the fact that the huge Sands convention center brings in countless hungry visitors in the evening who will eventually fly back to their home towns, makes your place unique. In other words you have a captive audience. So you really don't have to change a thing. Many of your customers are expensing  their meals and could careless what the food taste like. Perhaps it would be a wise idea to raise your prices and ship in food from Fazolis. The food would taste better for sure and the profits would sky rocket.",SUnbwW60dJZnxciYgtTGYQ,2,0,1,DocYXR4xbT3YRqTxz0nvGw

1061435,2014-03-11,1,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"Our bachelorette party group of five ended up at Otto Enoteca Pizzeria for Saturday night dinner recently. We were walking through the Venetian earlier in the day and decided it would be a great spot for later. A four star review is probably a little generous however there were definitely four and five star aspects to my experience so I'll err in their favor.

We showed up for our 8:15 reservation were seated immediately in an ""outdoor"" table. It was nice to enjoy the views of the Venetian Courtyard while being serenaded by the nearby musicians.

The most daunting task and possibly my favorite part of the experience was selecting the wine. The rest of the group wanted red and I was in the mood for white so my decision was pretty simple. As a big Sauvignon blanc fan I just went with the only sauv blanc being sold by the glass. Now the other ladies got the pleasure of working with the sommelier to find their perfect bottle of red wine. I don't recall his name but he was just a plethora of knowledge. I could have listened to his descriptions and stories of the wine all day. If I could give 5 stars for just the sommelier I would. 

We decided to go family style with our food and ordered the Caprese Burrata Pesto Tomatoes, Mozzarella Di Bufala, Cypress Grove Goat and one other cheese as our starter. For our mains, we split three pizzas which included the Margherita 'D.O.C.', Truffle and the special of the day, which was a pesto pizza with a garlic white sauce. So the cheeses were phenomenal, specifically the goat cheese. The caprese salad was pretty good too, as I'm not a tomato fan and the tomatoes almost seemed like roasted red peppers. Sadly, the pizza was the least favorite part of my meal. I only sampled the margherita and pesto pies, but they were just overall bland. The best part of the margherita pie was the fresh basil, but it just slid off the slice along with the mozzarella. The pesto pie was just lacking the usual burst of flavor that one would expect when eating pesto. 

Aside from the sommelier, the rest of the service just seemed a little off. For example, after we finished our cheese and salad appetizers they did not remove our small plates. The cheese came with honeys and spreads which wouldn't have mixed well with the pizza that was just served, and we had to ask for new plates for dinner. That was the only faux pas but they were just generally lackadaisical. It took a pretty long time to settle our bill, even when paying with just one credit card for the group. 

I'm not ready to write off Otto Enoteca entirely as the appetizers, sommelier and atmosphere were pretty great. I'd just hope that if I were to return the other pizza options were more palatable.",OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g,2,1,4,mv7VZtoW5RYyOWHZULZ7dQ

Romana Pizza (anchovy pizza)
Lasagna
Ravioli

All three were mediocre and something you would find at a buffet at Vegas.  That would be fine if I was visiting a buffet, but I tend to avoid the petri dishes that we consider buffets as much as possible.  So...if you go to a restaurant, you expect decent food for the price you pay.  You don't expect overpriced beef a roni.

We all paid relatively high for raviolis that were not filled with anything (not sure if the chef screwed up or the filling was cooked out in the sauce), lasagna that I could cook better using a Batali recipe, and my Romana pizza that obviously had old anchovies.  The anchovies tasted like sardines that had been sitting out for a few days and were sometimes licked by a cat.  Super fishy..more than a normal anchovy.  The sauce on the pizza had the taste of a canned sauce, and the cheese was flavorless.  The capers were the only thing decent on the pizza.  

I asked the waitress about the anchovies, and she just said ""yes...that is how anchovy tastes.""  No...that is not how they taste when they are new.  I have eaten at 5 star restaurants and the anchovies were fresh.  What they gave me was horrible.

Batali has cookbooks all over the place in that restaurant and I noticed we were right next to the Venetian streetscene play...so I put two and two together.  This must be his throw away restaurant (place where he sends his older food) and he believes the touristy area of the place will suffice for driving traffic.

Also, the service was sub par for a supposedly higher scale restaurant.  It took them some time to seat us (although there were a lot of tables) mainly because nobody was at the station for about 10 minutes.  This didn't just happen with us.  Other patrons were standing in a line with about 7 tables open because the hostess was nowhere to be found.  Bad experience, but it is a learning experience.

It was fine. Maybe I was looking for wonderful. I've had margarita (I know I'm spelling it wrong) pizza before that was so special in it's simplicity, because it was handmade and oven-fired, with flavors and textures that made your brain light up, but this pizza was just okay and not worth the $20 you end up spending on it. The lasagna was good, solid. Still, not amazing.  When we got our bill, $71total, it hurt a little bit to spend that kind of money on this meal, even with the great atmosphere and service.

We ordered a tagliatelle pasta dish but received a pork belly ragu instead which was pretty delicious so we ate it and didn't say anything about being served something we didn't order.  Ended with a dessert called dark chocolate which was a dark chocolate cake with chocolate gelato and whipped cream and cappucini.  Again just okay.  Cocktails and wine are pretty pricey.

1286281,2014-01-13,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"For those of you who are new to Vegas...I don't envy you.  There is SO much to choose from!  You need to accept, right now, that you will not possibly be able to experience all the amazing things Vegas has to offer.  In fact, as much as I plan my trips (and boy do I plan them!) there is inevitably a moment when I walk by something and think, ""why didn't I make time for THAT???""

I tell you that - to tell you this.  Understand that Vegas is a lot about knowing your price points and researching the best value for your money.  Example:  If a quick McDonald's breakfast and coffee (yum) is just as good as a gourmet omelet from Mon Ami Gabi (at the Paris - YUM!) then save the money and spend it somewhere else. 

Ok, back to the review.

Why you should try this place:
-Ambiance, Ambiance, Ambiance, value, value, value for that ambiance
-Located in the Venetian along the Canal shops, with occasional live music nearby
-Great food for Mid-Price point ($20-30 entree, with apps separate)
-Extensive Wine List, approachable prices
-Service is quick, lots of tables, easy to get reservation (use opentable.com!)
-Food is authentic, southern style with red sauces, lots of garlic and homemade sausage (not as good as my Nonna's, but then again, nothing ever will be!)
-Skip the dessert and grab a gelato at the nearby gelateria and stroll your way back through the shops
-Consider splitting a pizza (6 thin crust slices) and some side appetizers

What you need to keep in mind:
-A reservation is a good idea, just because Vegas can get busy FAST.
-This is not superfine dining.  Don't expect a really posh atmosphere but understand that everything in the Venetian feels a bit classy and you can totally be dressed up if you want to, either way, you will fit in.

My girlfriend and I stopped in here for lunch while the hubbies were off playing hockey.

I liked the outdoor seating area. Very cozy and very European. It was nice. 

For lunch, we decided to share the Tuna salad and the Margherita pizza. For the salad, the menu read, ""Tuna Roasted Tomato Artichoke Caprese Burrata Pesto Cherry Tomato Salad"", a lot going on so I was a little intrigued at what the salad would look like.  It could also use some punctuation too.  The salad overall was a 3. A little too tangy for me to rave about it but nevertheless, it was tasty and enjoyable. I think they if they can simplify this salad, it would really go a long way. 

The margherita pizza is what made this lunch for me. The crust was nice and thin, very tasty and had the right amount of cheese on it. I know it's pretty authentic to just place the whole basil leaves on the pizza but I never understood why restaurants do this because you can't get the taste of the basil in every bite. I prefer cooks and chefs to chiffonade the basil and then sprinkled on top. That way, the basil goes a long way.

The service here great. Our waiter was very attentive as well as the rest of the wait staff. We didn't have to ask or wait long for anything.

This is a Pepsi-contracted company, so unfortunately the soft drinks taste like typical Pepsi terribleness.
All of us ordered different entrees, most chose pizzas.  The Quattro Formaggio was a great pizza!  I had a cheese (don't remember the type) and sautéed mushroom pizza (the Thursday special).  I've never had that type of cheese before and it turned out to be one of the ""smelly"" ones.  It was ok but I personally wouldn't do it again.  The pepperoni pizza looked good.
Finished off with a Tiramisu dessert.  We were all surprised of the prices of the desserts...like $12-$15 range.  Surprising to me since I manage a fine-dining steakhouse across the street and this price is almost twice what I charge.

We were seated in the very back corner of the indoor patio.  I was a bit concerned that we might be forgotten but our service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.

The saffron risotto of the arancini was so perfectly flavored, my guy declared them the best he's had.  The calzone was very yummy and very rich.  I was surprised not to see some tomato sauce to cut some of the creamy fattiness but didn't mind a bit.

For main courses, we continued to indulge and went the pizza route:  Pancetta and Goat Cheese for me and Artichoke and Prosciutto Cotto for manfriend.  We both enjoyed the crisp, cracker crust.  Good amount of toppings.  The goat cheese on my pizza had perfect tang and creaminess.  Mine was good but I reeeeally liked the artichoke pizza.  Delicious cheese and prosciutto, great subtle lemon flavor.  Very nom.

Vegas is pricey but Otto's items were only a couple dollars more than a comparable place in the Bay Area where we're from.

We started with the Gnocco Frito,  Eggplant Caponata, and Grilled Radiccio salad with smoked mozzarella.  The apps were okay - certainly not bad - but nothing special.  (also some drinks and wine which were just fine)

Then we had two pizzas.  The Margarita DOC pizza and the Pancetta/Goat cheese pizza.  The Margarita DOC was truly disgusting.  The thin crust was tasteless and soggy.  The tomato sauce was as if someone had taken campbell's cream of tomato and slapped in on cardboard.  Then there was a dab of mozzarella.  Overall a tasteless, soggy, bizarre tasting mess.  C'mon Mario - please don't tell me you actually think this is good?   The other pancetta/goat cheese pizza had a little more flavor but still mediocre at best.  (btw: note to restaurant - those breadstick packets you put on the table are old/expired/have a funky chemical aftertaste).

The setting in St. Mark's square ""a la Venice"" is charming and romantic.  Really a lovely setting - and reminds me of my trip there many years ago.  The service is
eager, but weirdly clumsy - like they  are trying too hard to let you know that this is a serious dining experience - overly explaining every little thing - and educating you on every ingredient if you ask a question about the menu - which is nice but just too much.  They also push certain dishes or desserts - but they go on forever when you really just want to cut them off and let them know you hate Pumpkin so no need to do five minutes on the"" deconstructed pumpkin cheesecake in a jar"".  Just sayin....   Somehow - we spent close to $200 on this meal - a lot given what it was.

I had read the mixed reviews on yelp - including one that mentioned the Campbell's tomato soup tasting pizza - but I figured they were probably just being bitchy - and the location worked for us as we were going to see a show at the Venetian.  But the mixed reviews are accurate - and we will not be returning to Otto anytime soon.  Mario - still a fan - Joe, still not a fan.",v4NRZt3Fv29TTrWQFTxQMw,3,2,2,o-FD7ZVl2hHWXHVRC-QmSQ

We split the cauliflower, a pizza and the Fra Diavlo. All were good, however, when we wanted to order dessert, we had to flag down a manager, after 30 minutes.. Our server never checked back on us. I noticed she was busy with a large group, but acknowledgement would have been nice.

We ordered our Americanos from the manager and when she came by to take our dessert order, she was rude and probably assumed we were going to stiff her.

She was wrong, we left her 20% just to prove our point and make her feel stupid.

Their appetizers were fun. They brought us a giant plate full of compartments that contained different appetizers. There were a lot that were reminiscent of Indian food: black lentils, egg plant, green olives, etc. Since I'm a vegetarian, I can only discuss the Veggi dishes.

The Cauliflower pasta sounds like it would contain a weird taste, but their sauce and consistency of the pasta was made and blended to perfection. Their Margarita pizza was to die for. I had incidentally had margarita pizza the night before as a late night snack at Grand Lux Cafe, and I was blown away by how incomparable Otto's Margarita pizza is. It's rich, soft, fluffy, and delightfully tasty. The final Vegetarian dish that we had was the ricotta cheese pasta with marinara sauce. That was cooked to perfection as well.

I especially liked that they provided each of us with skinny bread stick packets. I wasn't a fan of their wine, and unfortunately I don't remember which kind we ordered.

1643486,2017-02-12,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"Otto is my happy place!

The smells, sights, and sounds of St. Marks Square in the Venetian are the perfect back-drop for a casual, relaxing, and thoroughly enjoyable dining experience. How amazing is it to be greeted with a glass of Rose Prosecco? The perfect aperitif to cleanse the palate, and there's something about bubblies that starts off a meal with a happy note.

If you haven't tried the salumi options, you are missing out! House-cured meats? Yes, please! Try the Coppa & Mortadella - mmm... And don't forget the variety of cheeses that are served with a trio of accoutrements: apricot mustardo, brandied cherries, and truffle honey. The Taleggio dipped in the truffle honey is a-MAZ-ing! 

Next up, Reagan helped us with the extensive wine offerings, and we usually try something new, but on this visit we opted for a favorite, Quintarelli's Primofiore 2010. So good! Now it was time for some fritti: the brussel sprouts with Fresno chili and a little squeeze of lemon on top, these things are addicting, as is the fried ricotta. 

Since there were three of us on this visit, we opted for two pastas served family style, the black spaghetti with calamari that my husband was craving and a special, papparadelle with mushrooms. My mouth waters just thinking of it... The fresh pasta is cooked perfectly al dente. The calamari in the black spaghetti is fresh and tender, and chef surprised us with the addition of shrimp (thank you!). The papparadelle with mushrooms has an wonderful earthiness and creaminess - really nice dish!

Our server, (JR or RJ?  I'm sorry I don't remember which!) recommended a rosemary & lemon gelato - thank you! The cake on the bottom was moist and flavorful, the gelato was refreshing, and the cookie on top was dusted with rosemary. Seriously?! Rosemary dust - how cool is that? I'm told Chef Denny came up with this one... Nicely done! The new GM, Matt, offered a tasting of Cardamaro, a wine-based amaro infused with cardoon and blessed thistle, and Matt was spot-on that it went with the rosemary lemon dessert. We would have finished everything if our bellies weren't so happily full. Thank you, Matt and your wonderful team!",KdQq5g7AjZyCrB2gzwHsmQ,2,1,5,tag2QhLJJsSu98lSQs-uzQ
1677454,2011-01-16,9,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"Las Vegas is Disneyland for adults and dining at Enoteca Otto Pizzeria in the Venetian is a pretty good representation of that.  Enoteca Otto Pizzeria has both indoor and outdoor (or pseudo outdoor) dining here.  To get the maximum faux design, you will want to eat in their outdoor dining area that is modeled after an Italian train station.

The pseudo outdoor area has nice tables.  At the center of the restaurant is a cylinder train tower that appears to be used for curing meats.  The canal shoppes surround this restaurant (fake buildings, statues that come to life and that blue sky, which I think looks better here than the skies at the Forum Shops or Paris).

Otto (as well as its surroundings) features that Disneyfied decor/atmosphere, but it also has the backing of a celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  We went here for lunch and the pricing was reasonable (when compared to the many overpriced Vegas restaurants).  Pizzas went about $18 while pastas were about $20 or less.  You would expect to pay at least that for most sit-down restaurants in nice Vegas casinos.

The complimentary bread was packaged crispy breadsticks followed by focaccia bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar).  Standard stuff.

We ordered the tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula pizza.  This is one of the better pizzas Mario Batali and Nancy Silverton serve at Pizzeria Mozza in West Hollywood.  This pizza at Otto was okay but not great.  The pizzas had a thin and crispy crust, but it lacked both the flavor and the chewy and crispy texture of the Mozza crust.
 
The flavor of the pizza at Otto was okay.  It was a little salty, but that is kind of common with these prosciutto pizzas.  The pizza had too much tomato sauce as it oozed out with each bite.

We also had the Brussels sprouts with pancetta.  Brussels sprouts can be a little off-putting, but I have had good versions of it like the Brussels sprouts salad with vibrant fruit at The Bazaar or the tender Brussels sprouts with salty pancetta and creamy parsnip puree at AOC.  These Brussels sprouts were boring in flavor.

In addition, the pancetta was not good.  It did not really taste like pancetta.  Instead, it tasted like country ham.  While I was not a big fan of the flavor, they were definitely generous with the portion size.

Before ordering, the staff informed me that none of their pastas were housemade.  It was disappointing, but we forged ahead and went with a thick spaghetti dish that came with tomato, cured pork and onion.  Unfortunately, the pasta was served a little cold.  Also, the tomato sauce looked like it had dried on the spaghetti; it appeared that it had been sitting around for a while (it also had that appearance of re-heated pasta though I doubt the cooks would do that here).

The flavor was not that great.  It just tasted liked cold tomato sauce. There was not much of the pork and onion.  My friends really did not enjoy the dish and asked the server to remove the dish.  Not something I would do.  No matter how bad I usually eat whatever is put in front of me.  What can I say?  I am a good guest.  The staff did kindly remove the item off the bill without further discussion.

For dessert, they were out of our first choice (fried dates) so we settled on a scoop of housemade salted caramel gelato.  The gelato was not well presented.  They filled the gelato in a cold sundae cup.  There was not much gelato above the rim of the sundae cup though.  It was flat too--like someone had flattened the top with a spatula.

Despite the presentation, the gelato was actually quite good (and better than the gelato we had at Mario Batali's other and more expensive Vegas restaurant Carnevino).  The gelato was cold and creamy.  The flavor was good.  It was both salty and sweet.  They sprinkled some sea salt on it to give it a more pronounced salty taste.  Despite the salt flavor though, the sweetness of the caramel still came across.

Service was very good.  We were served by a waiter and a waitress. Both servers were dressed casually and they were friendly and funny but also polite and attentive.

After having mostly positive experiences at Mozza, I was hoping that Otto could become a good Vegas spot for tasty food at reasonable prices.  Unfortunately, most of the food here was average to below average.  Otto is definitely a Vegas restaurant in how it makes the most of its faux but still nice atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the food here is too similar to many other Vegas restaurants in how it is not worth the money and lacking in both flavor and quality ingredients.

Overall, we had a good experience.  Ordered a few pasta dishes and a pizza.  However, it didn't leave a lasting impression.

What I remember is that portions are small, so don't eat here if you are famished.  If you do, order a dish you can all share in addition to the food -- like a pizza.

1923236,2012-08-30,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"This was our third and final dinner on a recent trip to Vegas. After exquisite meals at Yellowtail and Scarpetta, we were ready to be impressed (in a more casual setting) by Mario Batali's joint. 

Finding the place was our first hassle. The Venetian could use some updated signage. Finally someone told us to ""bear left at the canal"" and we were on our way. We arrived in a quintessentially Vegas setting: a pseudo piazza with a few designer shops and restaurants. After two meals overlooking the Bellagio fountains, this was totally mediocre. We took our ""outdoor"" seats and reviewed the menu.

Once we picked our food, we placed our orders in one of the most irritating interactions with a waiter I've ever had. When I ordered the arugula salad to start, he said to me, ""Do you know that arugula is bitter... are you sure you want it?"" Wtf? I guess we were in Vegas where folks from all walks of life, including those that never encounter arugula, eat out. I guess he was trying to be helpful. Mostly I was insulted by having to explain that I do in fact know what arugula is and do in fact want to eat it.

Then I ordered the gnoccho fritto as part of our fried appetizer. Again, the waiter explains what it is as though it's definitely not what I have in mind and possibly won't like it. I don't care what it is. I want to try it.

Then I ordered the gemelli for myself with their housemade sausage and broccoli rabe. AGAIN, ""Do you know what broccoli rabe is? A lot of people don't know."" Yep, I know what broccoli rabe is. Thanks! 

Yadda yadda, other than the above mentioned experiences, the food was pretty solid. We asked for the bread and received it half way through our entrees (and no olive oil to speak of, though I guess we should have been more clear about that). The fried stuff was fried stuff. It should have come with more sauces for dippin'. The arugula salad was tasty, but there was nothing particularly special about it. The girl who brought our wine commented, ""I love that salad. It's so... simple."" Indeed.

My pasta was delicious. I scarfed down the whole plate, which was impressive given the massive amounts of fried food I'd just had. The housemade sausage was spot on, and the broccoli rabe was plentiful and well-prepared. My sister had the pesto pizza and loved it, though I thought it was a bit too rich and couldn't imagine eating much of it. My mom had the bucatini and loved it, as well. 

If you find yourself near this place, give it a try. But don't go out of your way. They have some work to do in the service department, and maybe they should just write out explanations on the menu if customers are frequently confused about arugula and broccoli rabe.

The ceilings are around 80 feet and they're beautifully painted and they resemble clouds so it feels as if you're outside!
The food and service are both spectacular! 
I have tried the braised pork shoulder and it was so tender and flavorful and the cucumber salad on top was great!
I also had the rigatoni pasta with veal and it was so rich and hearty. The veal was cooked to perfection and it was very savory!
I also tried the caprese salad which was to die for. It was during a time that they had cherry tomatoes in season and I liked the sweetness of it. The deserts they had to offer were also so amazing! They had pistachio and olive oil gelato and it was so creamy and amazing!

I think to tell how good a pizza place is you have to try the Margarita Pizza due to its simplicity and freshness of the ingredients which should be used. This has to be the saltiest pizzas I've ever had in my life. The sauce was probably the saltiest. Horribly disappointing! SMH. We even started off with a meat plater and allowed the waitress to select the meats for us. Biggest mistake ever. Nothing was memorable. 

I kept it simple and ordered the house wine. It was good. One of the best house cabs i've ever had. 

We got the bill and found that the wine I bought was $20/Glass. Seriously? I could've ordered my own glass! Wow. If we subtract the glass from the tab then it was reasonable. Around $50 for a appetizer and pizza was decent for a Batali restaurant. Batali - you have salted my last pizza. Needs work.

I remember getting little containers filled with beets and rabe and mushrooms, and eating them alone in Washington Square Park. This Otto is less affordable than the original--even New York can't rip you off quite like Vegas--but it's equally pleasant, with excellent food and a casual, friendly ambiance.

Otto is in the Venetian, in the central spot formerly occupied by Enoteca San Marco, which was more or less Otto by another name. You dine faux al fresco, under the painted Venetian sky, and you yield to the gleeful corniness of your surroundings. My husband and I came for a late dinner, right off a Friday night flight to Vegas. We had a reservation, but it looked like we could've walked in. Our waiter Eli L. was excellent. He took his time recommending both food and wine, and attended to all our needs with warmth and absolute competence.

We drank red wine by the glass--Montepulciano and Barbera--and indulged in a wonderful meal. There was fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic, and we ordered a big spread of starters. We got prosciutto di Parma and coppa, which were both excellent, as well as a plate of gooey taleggio served with black truffle honey and syrup-stewed cherries and apricots. We also got a pot of Otto pickles, which overflowed with baby carrots, cauliflower, fennel, radish, and turnip, all crisp and zippy with brine. Feeling extra indulgent, fresh off the plane, we got the caprese with oven-roasted cherry tomatoes, pesto, and milky burrata. Entrees were probably unnecessary at this point, but we did finish our pastas with alacrity. I had the linguini special, cooked a nice al dente with shrimp, garlic, and chile. My husband had the tagliatelle with butternut squash, brown butter, and sage. This one was too sweet for me, but he liked it. We ended this decadent meal with a bowl of sorbet and gelato--huckleberry, lemon, and olive oil, all perfect and perfect together.

Dinner was expensive, but that tends to happen in Vegas, and I thought it was very worthwhile. The food, service, and atmosphere were all on point, and I'd recommend Otto to anyone looking to sit down to a good Italian meal.",WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ,11,9,5,A_TrBJwkG-B4XMjARq0MzA

On their side, the pizza was thin, crispy, and as close to real Neapolitan pizza as I've had in a long time.  

Other than that, the service was fair to good:  the place was very busy, but service was kind of slow and bordering on not attentive - long waits between the waiter's visits to our table.  

Dinner was longer than we wanted, and it felt even longer due to the setting at ""St. Mark's Square.""  I realize that many people find the the fake street scene environment at the Venetian to be novel and even charming.   

However, to me, the location was simply not relaxing - loud echoes like a gym full of people, lots of people.  The music of the amplified ""acoustic"" street performers sounded like it was in an echo chamber - the ""sky"" was vaulted and reflected any sound below.

People-watching was interesting, but only one or two steps above the freak show on the strip, with the typical bachelorette parties in crotch length dresses, wasted dudes re-enacting The Hangover, and tee shirt covered pot bellies.  In short, a lot of American tourists.  This kind of sucked the charm factor down to near empty.  Ultimately, it was a mall...  in Las Vegas.

And was a big mall.  Entering through Palazzo might have provided a shorter path to the restaurant.  As it was, the walk through the Venetian shops was looooong - both in and out.   

To summarize, the food was good, but it was pricey.   However, with lack-luster service in a setting that I found to be harsh, I don't need to return.",csjys5jzCHwQD7zd6gkvYQ,0,0,2,VVDXzFOLnfVukjsZZOy0Bw

I wrote them a letter about how sick I got after eating there and general manager Paulo Duran followed up with me as soon as he got back from a few days off to offer profuse apologies and assurances that this is the first time that this happened and that it would never happen again.

Here is the back story:
I am a celiac and am careful to the point of being anal. I spent 15 minutes on Monday night going over the menu with the two women at the reception desk. I was told that they have gluten-free pasta for most dishes and that the homemade sausage is also gluten-free.

For my Thursday lunch I ordered the gemelli with house sausage and broccoli rabe, made gluten free by substituting GF pasta. The server returned to my table several times to let me know it was taking a long time because they boil a fresh pot of water for all gluten-free orders to prevent cross-contamination.

My order was not delivered by my waiter, but by someone else. She said it was gemelli without cheese. I said that mine is supposed to be gluten-free and not without cheese. She said that she made a mistake and it was gluten-free and she would bring cheese to my table.

Right after lunch I picked up my luggage and left for the airport, giving myself plenty of time to catch up on work in the Amex Centurion lounge before my 7:00 flight. 

As I was walking to the lounge I felt queasy and knew I was starting to have a major celiac reaction - which I did for the next 3 hours. Anna took very good care of me letting me lie down in the children's room with a cold compress on my head.

After talking to the chef and several employees, Paulo determined that there WERE two special orders of gemelli at lunch; one gluten-free and one with no cheese. I got the wrong one and paid the price. He said they are very, VERY careful with food allergies but something went wrong at the last moment - and he is determined to ensure that it doesn't happen again.

Okay, so I will give them another chance when I am next in Vegas. Paulo - thank you so much for your follow up.",wxSKcdjtluS4BKZDSc_Apg,1,1,3,peW_XwyH1Ps2xjpe_qUekg

I started with the arugula with shaved parmigiano, and while the salad was very green and the cheese awesome, I felt it was underdressed. It was decent, though.

I went with the pancetta and goat cheese pizza and it was out of control delicious. The cheese and meat were both cooked perfectly, and the pizza was so crispy that I was in heaven. I forced myself to eat every piece. My friend went with the margherita pizza and he loved it, too.

The service was just okay.. we ordered drinks, then food, and our drinks came out with our meal. After we finished, nobody stopped to see us, and after 15 minutes of waiting (we were on a little compressed timeline.. not too bad, but I was itching to get to an event), I stopped a server that wasn't mine.

Tease:  Iron Chef, Mario Batali's small Italian Pizzeria and café in the Venetian casino. 

Why I went:  We were in the mood for a nice lunch before flying home and this seemed as good as any to try.  We love his place Mozza in LA, so why not give it a whirl?

When: 11/20/12, we went for lunch early.  It looks like it could get crowded.  It wasn't when we went.

Food:  For drinks, I had a really solid spicy Bloody Mary ($14), and my wife had a tasty glass of Lambrusco ($12).  We enjoyed an app of olives, and 1 cheese that were exceptional!  The olives were good, but the cheese was amazing!  Sadly, I can't recall the exact one...but it was a harder Italian cheese served with the most ridiculously tasty truffle honey we've ever had!  We over-ordered so that we could take some food home with us...  We had a pepperoni pizza.  Very good...but not Mozza good!  Nancy Silverton's influence on the crust in Mozza is apparent when comparing it to Otto.  There just is no comparison!  However, the pork shoulder and the buccatini Amatriciana were SUPER good!  The pork shoulder at $26 isn't inexpensive, but it's worth every penny!  It's Mario's signature dish and is packed with flavor.  Also, the pasta was simply perfectly prepared.  It had some nice spice and was so good...I overate and finished it!  The pasta was $19 as was the pizza.  All reasonable given the quality.  

Service:  Good.  Cruz T. did a fine job serving us.

Hints/Final thoughts:  Get the cheeses, apps, pastas...and pork shoulder!  Save the pizza for elsewhere.  It's good, and if you are craving it, it does the trick.  But if you've been to Mozza...don't expect similar.",EBveE4oDk6AYWNUEs937mg,3,1,4,JpSJgpez4h-wCeeBSsBDiQ

Anyway ate their while I was at a trade show in Vegas.  In all honesty I like the place a lot.  What I liked most about it is that they have a very good selection of Italian cheese.  Which I love and they have Broccli Rabe which I love more.

Sat at the bar by myself after a god awful day at the trade show.  Had a nice glass of wine which they sell by the ounce. I thought I was back in high school buying  pot but the selection was great and while worth it.

The staff at the bar was atentive but not the best.  All in all a fun time but Mario knows how to do that.  Check out Eataly.

I'm totally a big fan but this particular restaurant is his lower end, budget type, not so special place. For what it is, and what it's trying to be, it's ok. But if you're in town for a great Italian meal, then do not come here.

- caprese salad: they use cherry tomatoes (which I've never seen done), and instead of fresh basil, there's a pesto mix blended in 
Not your traditional caprese, and not different in a good way. Budget style.
- prosciutto & arugula pizza: great crust, good sauce & topping ratio, but the prosciutto was extra oily & salty. I've had this before at other restaurants and it doesn't taste this way. Also, the arugula should be generous and crispy/fresh. This wasn't 
- veal lasagne: not enough cheese, or sauce. needs more fresh herbs/spices. It tasted bland and just not delicious.

Then there was the pizza. Meh. My husband really liked it, but I consider myself to be a pizza connoisseur, and I was completely underwhelmed. The crust was very very thin-- think cracker, with a tomato sauce, and a little dollop of mozzarella on each slice. It was not great.

My biggest problem was the server. Every time I ordered something it was like he was questioning my order... for instance:
Me: I'd like the margherita pizza please.
Server: OK, that has a very thin crust with sauce and one piece of cheese on each slice.

Me: I'd like the roasted beets please.
Server: You mean you don't want to try the lentils or the eggplant? Both are very good.

Me: I'd like the arugula salad please.

No, don't worry, these things happen (when you're trying to scam your customers).  $115 for 2 for lunch.  Is that really normal?

After the small plates it was some some deep fried squash blossoms filled with delicious ricotta cheese.  Excellent choice I must say. We wanted to try something a bit heartier, so it was the short rib ravioli up next. Very tasty and a generous portion.

My other half and I came here on a random date night. Even though the restaurant wasn't easy to get to, I love the location. It's fancy, but still semi casual with people in jeans at the bar. Also a great place to people watch as its an indoor patio inside the Venetian's canal shops. 
Our server was so on point. Literally the second the hostess seated us, she was behind her offering wine and water. We asked about appetizers and I told her the type of cheese and meat I usually like and she came back with the perfect platter. The truffle honey to pair with the cheese is to die for. I could eat that on anything, and continued to dip my bread, cheese, meat, and even Brussel sprouts in there. 
With the wine, cheese, and brussels so good, I was waiting for something to be wrong!
Nope, did not happen. Our entrees were served and they were Italian perfection! Fresh al dente pasta, with ingredients that matched perfectly. The pasta servings were actually decent sizes, not huge where its unfinishable. Even the herbs used made a noted flavor to the dish.

Our first visit, we started with Caprese (Burrata, Pesto, Cherry Tomatoes). The burrata was amazing and the pesto tasted fresh and bright. The cherry tomatoes seemed picked at the peak of flavor - they were so wonderfully sweet! We enjoyed the Caprese so much that we ordered it the subsequent two times we dined at Otto. 

Next, we tried the Grilled Pacific Tuna with Sicilian pesto with broccoli rabe as a side. The tuna was grilled to medium rare and has a great, fresh flavor. The pesto and greens scattered atop the dish added to the great melding of flavors on the plate. The broccoli rabe, unfortunately, was bitter to the point that I couldn't manage more than one bite. 

Dessert was a trio of gelatos: dark chocolate malt, salted caramel and pistachio - YUM!

The next trip to Otto, we ordered the Caprese again, along with the grilled tuna (no more broccoli rabe for us, though). To round out the meal, we ordered the Bucatini all'Amatriciana (tomato, cured pork, onion), which we'd somehow missed on our previous trip - if we had seen it, we would have ordered it from the beginning! Again, the Caprese was sublime, as was the tuna. The bucatini was also amazing, to the point that we needed more bread, then our fingers, to make sure we got every last bit of sauce left on the plate. 

Our third trip to Otto, we varied it slightly. We went with the Caprese and the bucatini, but mixed it up by ordering the Marinated Chicken Paillard (arugula, fried eggplant, ricotta). The Paillard was delicious, so simple yet expertly prepared. The eggplant was a nice, thick slab and the creamy ricotta complemented the rest of the dish nicely.

All in all, the only disappointment was the broccoli rabe, everything else was just wonderful! If the Shoppes at the Palazzo were a bona fide neighborhood, we'd have our favorite neighborhood restaurant right there.",IUrGaOc4Tcb-CAL7_MZXsQ,1,0,4,qprUWCeGwAL5Xl-9349Htg

Service:
Very friendly and helpful.

Food:
I thought I knew what al dente was until I dined at Otto.  Now I question every al dente pasta I've ever had.  I ordered the Spaghettini with sauteed mushrooms, garlic, and thyme $19.  The pasta was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the portion was just the right amount as well.  The ingredients were simple and fresh, which allowed each of them to really stand out.  The variety of mushrooms were especially flavorful and distinct.  For dessert, we ordered three flavors of gelati $9; Colorado River Coffee Roasters espresso, pistachio, and dark chocolate malt.  The gelato was soft, rich and flavorful, with the pistachio and dark chocolate malt my favorites.

2782631,2012-03-18,1,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"Dear Mario,

My son and I visited your Otto Enoteca Pizzeria at The Venetian in Las Vegas. With all the choices in Las Vegas, and having experienced a nice variety of them during our stay, we were looking forward to a simple spaghetti and meatballs dinner with some Mario creativity to flavor. 

Really cool spot, Mario. The atmosphere was nice and we enjoyed the piazza setting. Great lighting, nice ""show"", simple elegance- all worth a little extra, in my book. We've paid a lot more for a lot less ambiance in this town. Hostess seated us with a very big smile and I liked that. So thanks for all that, Mario.

I don't know how to tell you this, Mario, but there's some disconnect from there- so I'll try. We've experienced the best and worst of dining throughout Italy and we get the Fritti, Insalate, Piatti dining experience, and we do appreciate it. But, we're in Vegas where it's always not so transparent how authentic dining in Vegas can be. So, spaghetti and meatballs for $20 might need some clarification in this stippling of cultures. I sometimes defer to a quote I was once offered in another country when I asked directions of another US citizen- ""We're from America, we don't know s***."" Most of those walking up to view your menu might not know s*** about requiring multiples of $20 dishes to be able to rub their substantial bellies on the way out.

Shame on us, we fell for the $20 pasta dish. Oh, it was authentic. That is, relatively minimal, delicious, perfectly cooked and lovely. I might add my disappointment with your arrogant and negligent server. He made it clear that his interests were elsewhere in the room. In addition, my son's request for Gnocchi with meat sauce was accepted with ""I don't know, but I'll ask"", and dismissed with ""We can't do that""- what??? So he ordered spaghetti with your little Irish hamburger marbles that you call meatballs (of which we each ate one of the ten or so little impostors), and very soon after, we're completing our dishes. Also, nice job at the math blackboard during staff training. Two persons, two pieces of bread- four persons, four pieces of bread. (Reminder- America/Vegas).

Mario, if I were anywhere but the middle of a ""mall"" in Las Vegas, I might have added some consideration for the menu authenticity. Get your best marketing people and figure out a way to clarify to your walk-ups that the $20 pasta is a side dish or offer the Walmart Shopper option for a couple dollars more. And let the people have what they want if it's Gnocchi with meat sauce. Also, please try to update your online menu info, it isn't even close to real time. 

Now that I know, I have a special little spot where I can get an authentically prepared snack between shopping and dinner for less than room service. Again, thanks for that. 

Sincerely, Vegas visitor.",xsrXP3czhVhoLgGE53DvPw,3,2,2,LNhD1vcSMzifBV8mwQI04w

Let me start out with some of our mistakes or variables that you have to account for when eating out:
- we came a little after 11am on a Saturday morning (aka right when they open)
- we expected a lot from this place since it has a ""Mario Batali"" on its sign
Our server was quite nice, tried very hard to sell us the appetizers, but we only wanted to grab a quick bite before gambling - plus, we had to leave at 2pm to catch our flight, so we are basically in a rush.
The bread was okay - my friend said it was grainy. Their breadsticks came in a package - they were alright.
When the food came...that's when the nightmare started. We had a long night of partying, were running on 4hours of sleep and planned to go to the Wynn Buffet but decided there was not enough time, so Otto it is.
Back to the food. I thought Italian food is supposed to be all about olive oil, tomatoes, basil and al dente pasta. What we got was SALT SALT SALT. We got:
- overly salty lasagna
- overly salty other pastas (I forgot the names)
They were horribly salty. My friend ended up telling the server his pasta was too salty (and the pastas were nowhere near al dente - some were over and under cooked). He then ended up getting an arugula salad with parmesan cheese - that wasn't great either because it was overly oily.
Overall, the food didn't look as pretty as the Venetian atmosphere surrounding us and I probably won't be going back again. 

Lesson of the day: take into consideration the variables I mentioned above and hopefully you'll have a better experience here like most of the other yelpers.",nAoR_O35MnVotyH5L4-3qQ,1,1,1,PXA2eSQQCGWRgiwBzxD2nA

We arrived just a few minutes before happy hour. We tell the hostess we wanna do HH and she tells us to sit at the bar and we can order in 8 minutes when it's HH--great. Now listen, me and my 2 friends are friendly 20-somethings from NYC. Generally, in this type of situation, bartenders, waiters, etc would offer to just take the order and do HH pricing. They didn't, and that's fine, I didn't deduct stars for that. What I did deduct is how long it took them to then take our drink orders, and then how long it took to get drinks. We ordered small plates and we were HANGRY to say the least. Those small plates were taking forever, and we wanted to ask about it, and eventually it becomes clear our waiter forgot to put our order in. So he brought us a free plate of something else, which was a great gesture and would have redeemed this a bit, if it also wasn't a huge struggle just to ask for the check. My friends and I were not even talking to each other for about 20 minutes, just spending all of our energy trying to get any workers attention--and failing.

YOU OTTO NOT GO !!

We should have known something was wrong when we approached this restaurant...it was virtually empty, while Wolfgang Puck's restaurant just across the way was bustling with patrons.

My wife and I were celebrating our 35th anniversary and had our son with us...after being seated, a small amount of foccacia bread was served with no butter or olive oil and balsamic for dipping?...the party next to us hailed down their waiter and asked for olive oil and balsamic to be brought immediately...it was too late for us, as we had already eaten the small portion we were served...oh, BTW, that party had already gottten in the face of the waitress we were blessed with, and they got a different waiter..they had complained of sitting too long without being attended to their dining needs...

We both ordered the hanger steak which was accompanied by an arrugala and fig salad...I ordered my steak medium rare and received it raw/rare...my wife ordered hers medium and it turned out to be medium rare...the best part of this dish was the salad..both steaks were not cooked to our order and lacked seasoning...the steak itself was boring....$28 a plate!

My son had a pasta dish (Cartierra).....also looked boring on the plate...just pasta...no other accompaniment.....waiter never grated any cheese over the pasta, as was being done on other pasta dishes being served....$17

In celebration of our wedding anniversary, I ordered my usual Bombay Saphire Gin and tonic...when I got my bill and found out I was charged $14 for this cocktail, I should have called the manager over and made a scene...I've NEVER in my life been charged such an exhorbitant amount for a Bombay Gin and tonic, nor would I ever expect to again in my lifetime...c'mon Mario, are you kidding me!

Now for the dessert fiasco...we ordered Dolce Giorno...which was three different gellato selections, served in cream puffs...what we first got was the three different scoops of gellato served in a bowl all squished together to liken one large scoop?...when we said we had not ordered the dessert that was served, you would have thought all hell was going to break loose...the waitress's jaw dropped, like it wasn't her fault...and then the manager wanted to know why she was bringing the dessert back for a replacement?...price tag...$12

All told, it was a mediocre meal...a $111 tab plus tip...I agree with the other one star commenter...these TV star restauranteurs could care less if they ever see you again, as the constant turnover of travelers to Las Vegas provides a huge pool of sitting ducks just waiting to be plucked.

And by the way Mario, if you would like to try a good hanger steak, please visit the nearest Cheesecake Factory..they sell theirs as ""Hibachi"" steak for slightly more than half your price.

I thought to my self that she was playing along so my wife is surprised.i waited for some more time and nothing came. I had to go back to her and remind her and she carelessly looked at me and said...oh yeah...I forgot.it was just the sheer carelessness that amazed me.

And then she brought an overtly sweet ice cream with a candle to my table. For a birthday surprise!!!ice cream in a glass!!! How the heck is my wife supposed to cut that!!!

Service is always quick and pleasant. I've never had trouble getting a reservation or getting in when I don't have a reservation. It's very close to the self-parking and looks out on Saint Mark's Square, where, if the time is right, you could see a lovely opera performance, masked clowns on stilts, or even a string quartet.",HmXQ52rRxE_4FBxvVZvQoQ,1,0,5,HMqA5EpZA0lGy90UsTsP-w

Not bad, not good, not mindblowing. Just pizza, and I'm even eating pizza while writing this. (It's really delicious, by the way.)

I HIGHLY suggest getting the octopus salad. I detest celery, but how on earth do you blend octopus, potato, and celery to make the best salad ever? I would go back to eat this. The small portion is plenty for two people.

I got the calamari pasta with squid ink pasta and a pesto. It was super salty and heavy-handed as can be with the garlic. You couldn't really taste anything besides the garlic. In theory it sounded delicious on the menu, but I wouldn't recommend it. It was really oily, and the pasta was more raw than al dente.

Service is hit-or-miss. When the crowd was thinner, service was spot on and great. When things got busy, I ended up waiting on my check way after the folks at the table next to us cleared out, even though they got there after me. Very few times do I find myself getting irate with how long I have to wait for my check, but this was one of those instances.

Not sure if I would recommend going back again. If you have kids though, this is probably a quick, affordable down-and-dirty that could fill everyone's belly, but expectation management is important.",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,1,1,3,mNwrMlO6CI73riAaIGfe0A

Ricotta fritte - absolutely amazing. You must get this appetizer if you come here!!!!!!
Arancine fritte - these were ok
Quattro formaggio pizza - this was ok. The only thing different was that each slice of pizza had a different cheese rather than a blend of cheeses all over the whole thing.
Balsamic onion pizza - this was their special of the day. It was sooooo good. I've never had a pizza like this. The contrast of the balsamic onions with the ricotta cheese was an awesome combo.

I had the Seafood Diavolo.  This was a mixture of clams, mussels, squid and possibly swordfish in a spicy tomato sauce.  It was ok, hit the spot; however, nothing I would ever order again.  For $30 there are better entrees to be had in The Venetian Hotel (simply put).  

Had some kind of lemon merengue desert which needed help.  Tasted more like a lemon mousse to me.

Had a really good bottle of wine, a Barolo that ran $90 a bottle.  Technically the wine was the high point of our meal.

Service was okay, nothing special.

We had read that they had bad reviews on service, but we had excellent and beyond attentive service. All of the wait staff were extremely kind and helpful in making recommendations and taking care of any of our needs. Carlos our waiter was awesome and we even mentioned at the end of the meal how he was so smiley and attentive and it added to our meal. I only gave this place an 3-star rating because I wasn't particularly fond of my meal. 

I had the pasta carbonara and I think I had high expectations that just weren't met. I think I learned my lesson and shouldn't order items off the specials. My sister had the lasagna (and I had a few taste tests) and it was excellent. The sauce was so delicious. 

We ended the meal with some housemade daily gelato. Olive oil, Vanilla Bean and Salted Caramel. I forgot to mention that we started the meal with a cheese plate. It was three different kind of cheeses - mozarella, fontina and parmesan. They serve it with bread and then small sides of honey, apricots and cherries.

We started with:
-Ricotta fritters: 6 balls of cheese, rolled in bread crumbs and fried in peanut oil. TO DIE FOR
-Lentils ""alla Toscana"": really tasty if you're a lentils fan
-Panteleo cheese: A goat cheese--delicious
-Taleggio cheese: A cow's milk cheese--also delicious

Like I said, these were all really reasonably priced and we were pretty full with them. Not full enough to skip an entree, of course. Who do you think we are?!

We decided to split the eggplant pizza. The dough was perfect--soft, but crisp. I worry about eggplant (and other veggies) making the dough soggy, but this didn't have that issue at all.

Now..although this restaurant felt a teensy bit like a chain restaurant (must have been the look and feel of the menus and the paper-wrapped breadstick appetizers), I still enjoyed it immensely. Just make sure you can find it on your own accord since not one staff member we asked at the Venetian knew where it was. Strange.

We started the night off with the squash fritti, which was basically a french fry in squash form. I am a fan of anything fried, so you can't really go wrong here. The fritti were perfectly crispy--also a plus in my book.

I ordered the braised pork shoulder, which I was told by two servers was the best thing on the menu. It was melt in your mouth delicious! This is a no nonsense dish for those who like meat. Very few frills...just some vegetables sprinkled on top and some balsamic around the plate. Both complimented this dish very well. That's really all an avid meat-lover like me can ask for!

My friend who dined with me is admittedly not adventurous when it comes to food, so she stuck with the spaghetti and meatballs. I got one bite of a meatball, which I could barely pry away from her on account of her loving it so much. Hard for me to tell much about it in one bite, but it seemed like a very standard meatball.

We finished off the meal with a dark chocolate cake, dark chocolate gelato, graham cracker gelato and meringue all tucked into a martini shaped glass. Very yummy, and also a recommendation from our fabulous server from Turin (so sorry I failed to get his name!). 

Service was fabulous, and all servers within a 10 table radius were attentive and helpful, regardless of whether you were their responsibility or not. Last but not least, I have to mention the music selection. Since Mario had been dinged for his music choice at Babbo before, I must commend his Black Crowes song flowing from the speakers inside. A little ""Sister Luck"" never hurt anyone before.",7-BTm74b43TyLzV_WwQ9ag,2,1,4,5TaK3zm9rDFIQ2UZDk0b7A

We sat on the patio, so I can't say much for how the inside of the restaurant looks, since I never went inside.

Both were just ok at best.

For entrees, I ordered the linguine with mussels which was fantastic. The noodles had been cooked with saffron and they were really excellent. My friend has the baked ziti that was on special and it was phenomenal as well. 

For dessert, we split the gelato sampler where you get to choose five flavors of gelato. We got chocolate, vanilla bean, pistachio, graham cracker and salted caramel. These were not very good at all.

I had to chuckle when the waitress took our pasta orders and mentioned that the pasta was prepared al dente but she could have it cooked more if we wanted, so it would be soft. It was a sweet offer. Perhaps she mistook us for people from the Midwest or something, but I laughed out loud (which was not polite, but it was a gut reaction) when my 8 year old said he liked his pasta cooked properly -- al dente. She understood the message precisely and what we received was perfectly cooked pasta with extremely flavorful sauces. So flavorful, in fact, that we acted like we were from the Midwest and sopped up the sauce from the empty plates with our bread. :) 

We didn't really want to leave so we looked at the dessert menu. I almost choked on my tongue when my teenager said he wanted the ""three flavors of gelato for $12"". WHAT, I thought. (Not really.  ""What?"" is what I said; WTF is what I thought.)  But then both kids wanted that, and after reading the flavors we all wanted that. So we picked our three flavors, all four of us, and -- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT -- spent almost $50 on essentially four scoops of ice cream. But what ice cream it was. Awesome textures and flavors.

We had reservations through the hotel concierge but still had to wait for our table. When we were seated, we made the apparently unforgivable decision not to order alcohol and were promptly ignored by the waitstaff. It's been a long time since I've had such a grumpy waiter.  

Imagine my surprise when the waiter dropped off a plastic package of ""cracker-like"" breadsticks. At the time I was surprised, but more was to come. We ordered a set of appetizers, a pizza, and a salad for the two of us, earning an impressive sigh and eye roll from the waiter who returned with a small plate of actual bread (from costco I think) with some oil and vinegar.

Now, most Italian places take pride in their olive oil and vinegar, and with the chef Mario connection my expectations were high. But this oil might as well have been canola, and the vinegar was merely caramel colored and bland.

After my water glass had been dry for about ten minutes someone showed up and dropped our appetizers on the table. The mozzarella was burned and the squash blossom was a grease bomb going off in my mouth. Both lacked any real flavor.  The caprese salad was a decent preparation, but the tomatoes were not very flavorful and the pesto had an unfortunate amount of mint.

The pizza arrived after another ten minutes. And was the wrong pizza. The girl who brought it offered to let us keep it, but was going to add it to our bill if we did. We really wanted the pizza we ordered, and when we said so she took the other pizza away in a huff.

20 minutes later, our ordered truffle pizza arrived. It looked pretty good, smelled good, and we were excited that this might be turning around finally. Alas, I could barely get down one bite. My wife managed two. The pizza was bitter, the truffles were burned and flavorless, and the whole thing was drenched in the same flavorless oil that they served with the bread. 

The high point of the meal turned out to be the prepackaged cracker sticks that arrived first. If course, the waiter wouldn't do anything about our 9/10ths uneaten meal, so for $70 we got to come back to our hotel room and snack from the minibar.

The runner is going around four or five tables asking if someone ordered the cauliflower fritters.  He even delivered the first batch to the wrong table, who had just placed the same order literally 45 seconds prior to delivery by runner.

A waiter nor runner should ask who ordered a specific dish at a table with multiple diners.  Flavor wise this place has a lot to ask for.  I can only salvage the Gemelli with home made sausage and broccoli rabe.  It may just be the only thing they got right at this place.  Prices are outrageously high for this type of food.  All in all the place can be a lot better. And for their prices you should expect that much high standard of service and attention.  Not the concept here.

We ordered the ""Gnocco Fritto"" with the ""Prosciutto di Parma"" to start. The dough was fried perfectly and the fresh grated parmesan was the freshest I have ever tasted. Then ordered the ""Margherita D.O.C"" which was topped with an amazing tomato sauce that was seasoned just right, bufala mozzarella and basil. That pizza alone was breathtaking, but the real winner here was the ""Pesto"" pizza. Thin wood fired crust topped with ricotta, olive oil, and green pesto. When it arrived I admit it looked like the pesto was going to be overpowering and bitter, but boy was I wrong. I have never tasted such a balance of flavors in one bite.

Stopped by for a quick early dinner after the show at Sands Convention Center and enjoyed the food, didn't have too much time to take in the experience.

Well, wasn't my first time at the spot (and won't be last either, I guess) but this time either I was paying more attention, or the food was much better. 
We each had a salad, one of the vegetables and a pizza to share. Grilled Radicchio with smoked mozzarella was super flavorful and absolutely delicious - dressed with good aged balsamic.  The arugula salad with parmesan cheese was also pretty good. And, of course, the classic - Margherita 'D.O.C.'.

The Service!  The service was not great, heck it wasn't even good.  Let's get the bad part of the review out of the way.  We were seated towards the side near the back, and behind us were 2 other tables that the waitstaff had to keep squeezing by us to get back there.  Annoying.

Our drinks were not kept filled, in fact, I think the waitress only asked once if we needed anything.  Other than that, she would walk by us very quickly and just say Enjoy.  At once point another table was madly and frantically waving their arms to get her attention, so she went over there to help them, and promptly disappeared before taking our dessert order.  She was gone quite awhile.  When she did come back, she took our order, but didn't write it down.  Time goes by, she comes back and double checks my order, and said, Oh, I got it wrong then, I'll have to put it in again.

The restaurant was not that busy, and this type of service was inexcusable in my book.  Especially at the prices you are paying.  I know its Vegas, everything is overpriced, but for a casual restaurant some prices were high for what you got (mostly talking about dessert). Plus we were not told about any specials, then a few minutes later we hear our waitress reciting specials to the table next to us!

We ordered an appetizer of fried eggplant.  The order was much bigger than I expected.  The waitress asked if I wanted dipping sauce with it, so I said yes.  Turns out that dipping sauce was an extra $2.  Thats fine, but I hate when restaurants do that, I feel like I'm getting the wool pulled over my eyes.  Eggplant and sauce were delicious.

We got a margherita pizza which was FABULOUS!  Crust, sauce and cheese were perfect!

the 2 salads were good, and decently sized (we got 2 smalls instead of sharing a large one)

Dessert, we each got a trio of gelato.  One combo was chocolate malt, espresso and graham cracker.  Second set was huckleberry sorbet, concord grape sorbet and vanilla gelato.  Each item tasted great, but the portions were skimpy for the accompanying price tag of $12 each set.  I know they are using local ingredients etc.  But when 2 desserts tally $24 they better be mind blowing and they werent.

Would I go back? Yes, especially for the pizza.",yLZOrUg5UJhQlffSoL-j0Q,1,0,3,16K-Q-StlN252hfeabrtAg

The busser was a delight ( he was warm, smiling, and even chatted with my brother about the football game) ... the server was cold and repeatedly failed to explain the menu. When we stated that we would not be having wine with our dinner that night, he seemed aggravated (it's not always an option for those who must drive later). When shown the cheese selection on the back of the menu, I inquired if these were options for a cheese course. I was told no ...  with no further explanation. (And there was zero explanation on the menu other than that it is so many dollars for one, so many for two, so many for three ... for what? A wedge? A serving? I still have no idea. The same applies to the appetizers and when I asked the server, his answer was inscrutable. We opted to skip both the cheeses and the appetizers. Obviously.)

Our tables was presented with a small portion of bread ... with no oil (and no butter). Once the sampling was nearly depleted, the server asked if we wanted butter ""or something."" Erg.

The entrees were lovely. I had the Pasta Norma ... the eggplant was delicate and well prepared (I am not usually a fan of eggplant, but this was the only vegetarian option ... and I ended up getting lucky here). However, but my boyfriend and brother ordered the steak which was covered in a mountain of Parmesan and arugula ... both moved the majority of this to the side. Kind of a waste.

We would have loved to sink into dessert, but we all agreed that viewing another menu at this eatery was not an option. And, certainly, we would receive no help from our server. We would have easily invested double the amount into this meal ... but we literally could not. 

The service was so stressful and the menu so cryptic, we literally could not enjoy the experience. (And, the din was virtually unbearable. Be prepared for one LOUD experience.) Such a pity ...",-rFBSjuTYLH6uFRyg4dxXQ,0,0,2,g7nUayi8Fdiwh1kb8XvQug

I ordered a pasta, described as with pecorino and pepper , and this was exactly what I got.  It was disgustingly plain looking,  as it was just narrow, long pasta noodles with pepper, cream,  EXTREME amounts of salt, and the cheese (pecorino) was melted and mixed in.  It was NOT even garnished with any parsley or any greens, it was just plain pasta--no veggies at all.  Presentation was horrible. It was just piled on a very plain plate, not even on an attractive plate.  It tasted like I just threw a box of spaghetti noodles in, mixed some cheese in and threw some pepper on. This place is in a PRIME location at Venetian, so I was definitely surprised at the quality of the food. Mario Batali, your name has forever been tarnished in my mind because your name is on this restaurant. My meal was the most dissatisfying meal I have ever had, and to top it off, I PAID someone to make me this horrible dish, I didn't even make myself the worst meal of my life!!!  It was $17, which I thought to myself (based on the location/looks/chef Mario Batali's name on the restaurant) seemed like a bargain, but I was let down almost instantaneously with one bite. The best part of this visit was probably the packaged breadsticks they give you in the beginning of the meal-- yes, individually packaged breadsticks, which were not even good. 

I went in a group of about 7 people, and I tried everyone's dish-- it all tasted the same--but theirs just looked better. I thought maybe I had just picked the bad menu item, but they were all bad!! I think though the worst dish was the ""salad""--and we were all confused because the ""salad"" included radicchio + mozzarella. It sounded good on the menu--although I am not a fan of radicchio because of the strong bitter taste, I decided to try it. To my surprise there existed a dish even WORSE than my own! It was not a bed of fresh, raw veggies + fresh mozzarella-- it was in fact cooked radicchio mixed with melted mozzarella. It was an epic mess. 

So disappointed by Mario Batali's cuisine. I will NEVER be returning here NOR will I be going to any of his restaurants because clearly this restaurant is ruining his image, and nothing is being done about it.

On the down side the food is pricey for what you get. I had the special shrimp pizza for $20 and while good it was not ""that"" good. The special melon salad with prosciutto was a major disappointment. The melon was very unripe and was hard. There was way too much mint on the salad which overpowered the bland melon also the tiny sliver of prosciutto  did not justify the $14 price tag. The assortment of fritti we tried were a  mixed bag with the cauliflower being excellent but the squash blossoms squirted out their hot filling right onto my wife making quite a mess. The server said that happens some times.... Maybe a warning would be appropriate. We did like the gelato sundae dessert as it was rich and creamy and not over sweet.

The corn & crab ravioli was my entree choice and I think it was the right one---it felt light but also filling, and the swiss chard on top was a nice addition. The lasagna was good but nothing to write home about; the pizza was a little too salty and the tomato sauce tasted like it could be from a jar. And unfortunately the pasta alla norma was a big disappointment: the eggplant pieces were so tiny, there wasn't enough cheese, and the sauce tasted like a standard vodka sauce.

We ordered the arancini and squash blossoms appetizers. I loved the arancini which were creamy on the inside with pretty intense flavor but still very crunchy on the outside. I like the squash blossoms which had an interesting flavor of mint and ricotta and anchovy. My family weren't fans of the squash blossoms. We also tasted the bufala mozzarella taster with truffle honey (so delicious!), apricot mustarda, and some kind of flavored cherries. All of those accompaniments were awesome and really gave the creamy cheese what it needed with the cheese being like a blank canvass. 

Next we moved onto the pizza which was pretty good. The sausage and peppers was good. I expected the sausage to be spicier, it wasn't, but it was flavorful. We also got the Quattro Formaggio pizza which had four cheeses all in their own places on the pizza, not blended, totally separated on the pizza so you can taste each cheese by itself.

The bartender who served us at the bar was knowledgeable and attentive.  He was also very friendly.  My wife chose one of his cheese selections to add to her Prosciutto Di Parma plate and she was pleased with it.  We thought it was a bit ridiculous that they ask you if you want a side of Pomodoro sauce and then ding you $7 for it but it's Vegas and even an extra napkin will probably cost $1.  We are used to it.

The wine he suggested was not her favorite but she wanted to try a Pinot Grigio that was a bit different.  I ordered one of my favorite white wines:  Bastianich Vespa Bianco so I was very pleased since it is not easy to find.  Mario Batali restaurants seem to carry it in Las Vegas however because I last had it at his B&B Ristorante.

We ordered a plate of Gorgonzola, the fried cauliflower and fried ricotta balls as an appetizer, then two types of pizza and the veal and ricotta meatballs, and a very nice and reasonably priced bottle of Chianti and cannoli. 

The Gorgonzola was tasty and was served with honey, cherries and apricots, which was nice. The fried cauliflower was GREAT - unique texture and delicious flavor. The ricotta balls were like a fancy jalapeno popper and were tasty too. 

I really loved our pizza margarita - I love buffalo mozzarella and the sauce was flavorful enough to balance it - and my friend's four cheese pizza was good (except there was way too much ricotta on the ricotta slices). We shared an order of the meatballs, and were so happy that we did. The meatballs were moist and flavorful. I wish the polenta had been less ""grit"" style, and that there had been more of it - there was MAYBE a couple tablespoons and we were expecting a little more, but it was good.

And the canolli was delicious - three small canolli with creamy filling that wasn't overly sweet. It was just sweet enough that you weren't overwhelmed, but not saccharine-y.

The reason they don't get more stars - I wish some of the portions were larger - I get that Vegas is super expensive AND this is the restaurant of a famous chef, but other places in Vegas have a better cost/portion ratio. 

Also, the pizza was delicious but the crust was just a TINY bit overcooked for my taste. I like a pizza that has a firm but slightly chewy crust, and the crust here was too crispy all the way through. And the bread they give you was kind of flavorless and dry - good for the cheese my friend put on it but otherwise kind of bland.

1. The waitress was a snob and used hard sell tactics.  She made outragious claims about the food.  She told us ""everything"" was organic.  Not likely.  She went on to say how the quality of everything was so special that none of us would have every had anything that good.  I have been in the food business for years and was insulted by her implication that we were country bumpkins. When we didn't order the dessert she told us not to get any from the adjascent vendor, cause it had artificial colors and flavors.  WTF.  When she couldn't sell us ""everything"" she abruptly left and pretty much ignored us for most of the time we were there.

2, There were 6 of us.  (2) couples EACH shared a salad and one entree. The other couple each had a entree, no salad.  No one had dessert and only one person had a drink (a coke).  The bill was 180.00  I could stop here but.........

3. When my husband and I asked for the dressing for the octopus salad to be on the side, she pretty much rebuked us and said it was the best lemon vinaigrette we had ever tasted and we must have it on the salad.  Ok, we did.  Never even tasted it.  The salad was $14.00 and had a couple of pieces of octopus and a couple of pieces of potato.  It was ordinary.

4. My husband and I ordered the Grimalini.  It was so undercooked that I could not eat it.  The waitress overheard me say this and after commenting that I didn't understand what al dente was took it back.  When it finally came back, it was almost the same as it had been.  There was about (3) tablespoons of overcooked dried out sausage and some rapini (not bad).  I did not eat it at all. The bread was aweful and my husband had to ask for oil. 

5. My husband's uncle ordered the meat balls and spaghetti.  It was the smallest portion I have ever seen for an entree.  There was a handful of marble sized meat balls???? I can only imagine what they tasted like.

6.  The others didn't complain about their meals.

7. While waiting to go to the ladies room I could see into the kitchen.  There was a large tub of chicken sitting out unrefrigerated.  It was there when we came in and it was there when we left.  Someone call the health department.

We let our server pick our pizza for us, he suggested the Sweet Onion, (proscuitto cotto, bel paese) the crust was pleasant, like a typical version of thin, crisp Neapolitan-style, but the way the prosciutto was placed really threw me off, it was literally slices like what you would put on a sandwich, placed all over the pizza.

Another major issue for me was the menu updates... What's on line doesn't match the menu and there were not even disclaimers, i.e. Seasonal item only! I made my decision to eat there based on two factors. First, j was going to get squash blossoms! Which I know are seasonal. However, their online menu said they had them. Second was the zucchini fritti or simply... fried zucchini! They didn't have that either!
The service was just OK. Nothing to jump up and down about. Our waiter brought. Age of breadsticks, asked if we wanted sparkling or flat water then disappeared... I even told him when we mentioned water that we wanted some drinks. Even that was lackluster... no question on what vodka I wanted, no suggestions of wine to anyone else @ the table... nothing.
So for service and ease of menu, I have to say, a fail!
However... and there is a however!!! The food was great!
Pizza was spot on, nice taste, great chew, crispy crust! Just the way it should be. We also had the arancinj and the brussels which I would highly recommend! 
Unfortunately, there is good food all over the place. So with a lack of emphasis on the service and lack of attention to details, I can say, I will not be  returning!

I sat at the bar and it seems I am the only one in attendance at the bar. Such perfection since I have one chapter left. I ordered a glass of white wine and dove back into the pages.

The server was very friendly and let me try the wine to make sure it was something I liked. He even put the fancy bread and oil out with a glass of water too. He continues to check on me asking if all is well. I politely nod and he goes onto his other guests.

The restaurant area is pretty steady with customers. This seems like a true Italian experience, since my server even says thank you and the other pleasantries in the Italian language. 
 
Now finished with my book it does seem time for a little snack. I decided to have on the servers advisement the Abruzzo and Charred Asparagus. The Abruzzo is a thinly sliced pork that is cured and has a little kick of spice. It tasted wonderful. The Charred Asparagus is served chilled with wonderful bits of chopped hazelnuts. The romesco gives the Asparagus sauce a brilliant red color and a zing in every bite.

After finding out this fine establishment is closing its doors in July I am so glad to have dined here while I still can. 

The surroundings that are happening out in the plaza of the Grand Canal Shops are so fun and unique. The live performances of jesters and ladies singing is sweet music too all.

This faux outdoor sidewalk café looks swanky and classy from a distance but if you look closer you'll see that the waiters are wearing jeans. Which is cool.

The menu contains all of the usual overpriced, hard-to-pronounce staples of a typical North American Italian restaurant that tries too hard. They have something like two hundred different kinds of wine to choose from, so if you're a wine connoisseur or pretend to be one, you'll be in heaven here.

I ordered the spaghetti & meatballs because it was the only item on the menu that I could articulate with absolute certainty. Despite being the smallest meatballs I've ever seen, the meal was good. I had an overpriced Bloody Cosmopolitan to wash it down and I think I enjoyed that too. (I couldn't pronounce most of the drinks either) It was powdery, but maybe it's supposed to be. I was worried that maybe I ordered a chick drink. My wife didn't say anything though.

The waiter and assistant waiter were both very cool, laidback, and casual as was the lady that showed us to our quiet table at the back.

My only hang-up about this place is their prices. They don't accurately reflect the kind of restaurant that this place actually is. It is a casual atmosphere with casual food (even though the names of the food are a little convoluted) but they charge as if they are some high-class, renowned establishment.",WPdkJN1FLiNDVDWRN5MLaw,1,0,3,pkaLrR5JIEJPYiqKNRY-Ng

Service: 4.0/5 - The waiter was friendly and attentive to our orders and kept our drinks fresh.

Food: 4.5/5 - Started off with the Arancine.  Saffron infused risotto, bolgonese, and the bufala mozzarella made this cheese lover happy.  I went with the Pappardelle at the suggestion of an Italian friend with much knowledge of the food.  I LOVED the thicker pasta and the overall dish was tasty.  The portion of the Papardelle received was significantly less than the dishes my friends had.  The strawberry martini was tasty but also a little light in portion.

Value: 3.0/5 - It can get pricey quickly if you actively order from the great appetizer and dessert selections.  However, I was extremely happy with the ones I sampled this time around.

Ambiance: - Great place to eat, and people watch at St. Mark's square in the Venetian.  Loud enough so others can't hear your conversation, yet quiet enough so you don't have to raise your voice.

Summary - Think of it as a higher end Maggiano's with about the same pricing, with a much better selection of good at a much better quality.

When we arrived, we had a table ready, but unfortunately it was tucked away in a very tight back corner. We asked for another table, and mentioned we'd be happy to wait for one. The hostesses were really helpful and got us seated about 10 min later. 

What I loved about this place, was the location. You felt like you were outdoors in Italy, soaking up the ""sunshine/daylight"" and listening to live music on the ""streets"". Very charming touch and part of all the magic in Vegas! 

The food though, fell really short of everything I was expecting for Mario Batali. I'm a huge Food Network junkie..and the dishes I've seen him make, looks freaking incredible....just not here. I was torn on trying out the crab ravioli or the pappardelle...they both sounded amazing on the menu...as did the truffle pizza!

After making one of my toughest decisions of the night - Pappardelle it is. First off, it was dark meat chicken. I hate to discriminate here guys, but I'm more of a white meat chicken type of gal here. I looked past it, knowing I was in great hands with Mario's food...but nope. The dish was bland, the chicken was beyond disappointing. One of my girl friends ordered the crab ravioli...I tried a bite and felt like I was eating old seafood. The crab was really dry and had a significant and overpowering fishy taste to it. Definitely not for my palette. So playing with my food, I decided to carb up on my pasta...There was one final pizza slice of truffle pizza at the table of girls, and you can certainly bet I snatched it! That was probably the best dish there for the night. In hindsight, I should have probably ordered the pizza and passed on the pasta dishes. It was perfectly crisp and the truffle flavor was so so sooo good! 

Also, note that they will not make substitutions or alterations to items on the menu. I tried that and got rejected real quick. Bummer. 

Service was nice, but sort of became hit and miss throughout the night. I felt like there were some moments where our waiter was totally on top of everything and other moments where I wondered if he had flown off to Italy...",J9kJCqMx0JWvHthaM6i-lg,0,0,2,fhafXvj3QNChS3waR7gefw

The fried ricotta was delish - it's basically little cheese balls with a little bit of spice. Yum. The pizza was really good - tons of fresh prosciutto and the crust was done just right. The carbonara pasta was pretty heavy and had an odd but good taste if that makes sense. I think a really stinky cheese was used. I don't know if I would have liked it as just a single entrée because it was so rich but it was a great combo with the pizza. Our waiter recommended a white wine that also complimented the flavors perfectly so overall it was a well put together meal.

It is a plate of greens with cheese, bottom line.

So we order a ""caprise"" salad. Again, advised of nut and dairy allergy..Guess what it comes out with on it, yes that is correct, nuts.

Being perfectly honest the service has  always been somewhat sloppy but the food selection is great - taking specifically about the cheese board and small plates which are always delicious and interesting

We headed there last night and brought friends along with us but were rather embarrassed by the entire experience!

More than 20 minutes after being seated our friend finally got up to find our waiter. We had no food and no drinks only bread as at least that server was attentive - when you bring company and they have to search for service; it's not a great experience 

Then the waiter finally shows up to ask what we want to eat - so we just added on drink orders or he would have never taken them. The kids ordered their meal but we ended up having to order again later when it never showed ( and on that note - they may be kids but that does not mean it's okay to compromise the quality - the pizza was over cooked and way too firm; it was rushed like an afterthought and bad )

The cheese board was delicious as always and the squash blossoms were amazing but that is where it ended. The cauliflower was burnt and had we found the waiter we should have probably just sent it back; it was salty , deep brown to black and was mostly left behind! There was also a notable absence of some of their previous lighter dishes like tuna or farro - with a large emphasis on fried and heavier fare - so for me the appeal is gone

The pizza itself only had 3 toppings: almost no cheese, prosciutto, almost no arugula (literally 3 tiny pieces on the whole pizza) and super tangy tomato sauce. The problem wasn't the lack of variety of toppings. Some of the best tasting pizza I've ever had had few toppings. But there needs to be enough of those very toppings. Anyway, the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a can, but if it was made there which I assume it was, that shows theirs taste even worse than Prego or Ragu, yuck. The little cheese that was there (not even certain there was cheese amongst the strong sour tomato sauce) & meat slid off the entire pizza along with the tomato sauce.

We decided to hit the bar for a few beers. I forgot what i was drinking but it was a nice big Italian beer for $8...not bad prices for Las Vegas. Just as we took our first sip of beer our table was ready.  Sometimes I think restaurants want you to order a drink at the bar even though your table might be ready...it is a smart business move but as a consumer I find it tacky...oh well!

We were given a great table in the fake outside. These restaurants crack me up with all of the fake elements. I feel like I'm eating on the set of a movie every minute. When are they going to make fake birds come over and try to eat my real bread? At least I hope it's real...the bread I mean!

I made a special request from the waiter. I wanted my pasta cooked in a fresh pot of water with no salt. He said no problem. Some girl in our party...I don't even know who she was but she started giving me a hard time. Telling me the rest of the table was going to have to wait for there food because of me. She also started saying other things but I tuned her out. I didn't know she worked for the restaurant. Oh wait she doesn't! Just completely annoying! I'm still wondering who invited her? I would give her 1 star if I could review her!

Here is the funny part. All of our pasta hit the table and someone at the table said, ""can we get grated cheese?"". The food runner then said, ""I would recommend you try the pasta first because our water we cook the pasta in is really salty and people always complain it is too salty!"" I looked right at this girl and said,""Wow that's ironic the food runner would say that!!!"". I then looked at the food runner and said,""Load me up on the cheese because I had my pasta cooked in unsalted water!"". I then shot a dirty look at this girl sitting at our table. She knew I directed it at her but she had no come back at me! I've never met someone who would attack someone at there own table for a special request!!! I hope she liked her salty pasta dish!

I had the pasta with the shrimp and it was really good. Guess what? It wasn't salty at all. In fact, others at the table commented at how smart I was for requesting fresh unsalted water!  Sometimes it is good to ask and I was so happy with this restaurant honoring my special request.  A slammed restaurant that still cares about making there customer happy.  I love it!!!

We also started with a pizza too and it was really good! I was really surprised at how tasty everything we ordered. I would come back here for dinner and drinks but I will not be dinning with that mean girl ever again. I am so glad I have no idea who she is and hopefully I'll never see her again.

I also understand that Vegas restaurants that are play offs of their main establishments are meant to cater to a broader variety of people that often come at the sacrifice of quality and variety.  In any case, however, what I'm trying to get at is, it'll be good, but there aren't too many places that I seem think are great.  Such is the case with Otto Enoteca.  Greg and I stopped off here after wandering around the Venetian and trying to find a place that was moderately priced for a Linner (Lunch + Dinner).  Greg had just visited Mario Batali's place in LA, so naturally he thought to try here just out of curiosity.  We both decided against pizza since that usually gets taken care of past midnight in Vegas, so we went with two pasta dishes: Bucatini all'Amatriciana and Gemelli.  Leading up to this, we ordered two drinks, a Bellini and a beer while waiting for our food.  Our waitress was nice and very courteous, but what I didn't understand was the table bread situation.  After we requested the bread, it came out in a basket...and that was it.  No butter, no olive oil, no salt and pepper on the table, just bread.  Um, ok?  We were starved, but they certainly didn't put much effort into presentation.  The bread itself was delicious, but it probably would have been better with something else.  Anyway, the mains came out, and the waitress had warned us that they serve the pasta al dente.  No kidding, as it would seem.  I typically don't like al dente but was willing to try it.  My dish, the Bucatini, had great flavor to it with a spicy tomato sauce, onions, and some cured  pork.  My only issue was, much like the bread, it was literally just pasta on a plate.  No additional decorations, no detail to presentation, just pasta on a plate.  The plate itself wasn't that big, but I wasn't going to complain about the portion.  Anyway, Greg's plate was also good, and he was convinced that his plate was better than mine.  I had one bite (the maximum bites I was allocated) and it was tasty.  Anyway, after the meal was over, we sat around and people watched which I would say is valuable since there's a million things going on in that little plaza.  Ultimately, I'd say this place is a little pricey considering the fact that a) it was just pasta, b) absolutely nothing special done for the dishes, and c) I think like most places in Vegas, the restaurant can hike the prices up since people like myself will pay for it.  I might come back here next time if I feel like pasta, but for $35/person, I'll see if I can go somewhere else.",-g3XIcCb2b-BD0QBCcq2Sw,1,0,3,JGHh-xp-X9Szl3Mv57v1jQ

anchovy pizza and sausage pizza: both yum. if you like the thin pizza style, you'll like these. very hearty!

Rather than being set in a dark restaurant the 'outdoor seating' vibe makes you feel like you're in an outdoor Italian sidewalk cafe. That makes it casual and relaxed, including occasional performances on the town square under the faux Venetian 'sky'.

The menu offers a decent range of unpretentious simple Italian dishes and a robust wine list. The prices are pretty reasonable for the most part for the quality of food. I say relatively because much of Vegas fine dining is overpriced, including Mario Batali's restaurants. It's not the food prices that are the problem, it's the drinks and wine that are jacked up to the top end of the scale. 

Overall, you can count on a delicious meal here with decent service featuring all the things we love about true Italian fare.

Legitimate wine selection. In short, your stomach will likely be satisfied and your wallet will likely not be empty. 

However, I cannot overlook a very racist remark Mario Batali made not long ago. It will not stand I'm sure folks will chime in with contrary opinions. Feel free but just like Mr. Chik-Fil-A who chose to use his position and power to spew messages of hate, Mr. Batali has to face the consequences of revealing private opinion in a public setting. In this case that consequence is not terribly significant; I will simply never be a patron.

The restaurant has an ""outside"" sitting area which feels like a balcony or terrace and gives you the feeling that you are sitting outside in a piazza somewhere in Rome. The area is lively and filled with activity with people performing in the area just right outside the restaurant. Absolutely loved the atmosphere here!

The food is delicious with the pastas being my favorite as they are simple yet full of flavor. My mom had the truffle pizza and she loved the thin crispy crust! Service was wonderful with our waiter attentive and ready to get us whatever we needed.

4604171,2012-06-24,1,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"This place kicks so much ass. Probably my best meal in Vegas and I'm not even that into Italian food. I tend to avoid Italian places when outside of the northeast due to them not usually being as good as the food in places like Federal Hill in Providence and usually being twice the price. Otto proved me wrong.

I started with a selection of two cheeses, taleggio and fontina. My girlfriend ordered the roasted tomato and cucumber panzanella.

I think about that cheese like fourteen year old girls think about Justin Beiber. It was one of the best things I have ever had. I enjoyed it with the table bread and it was served with some type of blueberry, another type of preserved apricots and some incredibly good, fancy honey which appeared to have truffle in it. I'm not 100% sure what was in the accompaniments but it was all fantastic. Creamy cheese with the honey on crusty bread mmmmmhhmmm. I knew right when I was eating it that I would miss that plate until the next time I visit. Cant stress enough how much I liked this.

My girlfriend said the same about the panzanella. I took a bite and agreed. It wasnt something either of us would normally order but it all came together so perfectly. I'm not one to take a bite of plain tomato but I would eat mountains of this. 

My entree was the Rigatoni with Ragu Napolitana. Big perfectly al dente rigatoni noodles with a veal ragu that was pretty much just stunning. It got better with every bite. At first I wasnt that impressed. Then I kept tasting it and noticed how perfectly and simply flavored everything was. Just another incredible dish..

My girlfriend had the Bucatini. I'll just say she thought everything of her pasta that I did mine. 

The service was fine. Attentive but not overbearing. nothing incredible but certainly passable. No complaints.

Jeff and I split a pizza that had goat cheese, prosciutto and a light tomato sauce.  The dough was thin and crisp.  The saltiness of the prosciutto was ameliorated by the sliced green onions and the cheese.  A bit salty, but a delicious bite.  

We were lucky that the olive oil gelato was available.  Each bite was excellent.  There were buttery, flowery notes, but not the gross mouth feel nor overly sweet aftertaste of some ice creams.  We had it with the pear and chocolate gelatos.

Although the restaurant seemed full, we were promptly seated at a table that afforded a view of the square (i.e. I watched a ""statue"" throughout our entire meal).

Our waiter was enthusiastic and I must note, pronounced the Italian perfectly (although he clearly wasn't Italian).  He guided us through the menu and since we weren't that hungry (and had dinner reservations for Bouchon), we decided on an appetizer and a pasta dish to share.  We got the gnocco frito, and per the waiter's suggestion, had prosciutto wrapped around it.  HEAVENLY!  I've never had anything like it:  it was almost like a savory funnel cake with salty prosciutto and finely grated fresh parmesan.  Omg, yum yum yum.  The portion was huge too - definitely a share-able appetizer!  We then got the spaghetti and meatballs, which is my favorite dish and I'm always on the search for the best meatball ever.  Were these it?  No, but I loved the spicy-ness of the dish and the freshness of the basil really paired well with the pasta.

One of my favorite things about Otto Enoteca was the wine.  Otto has an enomatic wine dispenser, which permits you to get small to large glasses of wine, based on what you like.  This means that your gamble on wine is actually quite diminished; something interesting for Vegas where gambling is so prevalent!  I took advantage of and got a small glass of the Brunello.  The bottle retailed for $220, but my small glass was just $17.50.  A coup, if you ask me, to sample a super rare vintage of one of my favorite wines.  Yay.

Hubby went the amari route and the manager gave us a very personalized walk through of the numerous selections, pointing out the specific ones beloved by Mario.  So special!  The manager seriously spent about 20 minutes just with us walking through all the various types, before we settled on 4 different ones to taste and savor.  And yes, artichoke liquer is actually tasty!

All in all, impeccable service, unique italian eats, and a great people-watching spot make this one a fun afternoon spot.  I would definitely go again and try the pizza, which looked amazing!  

But note:  Is it the best Italian you will ever have?  Nah, so I'm not sure I'd recommend this as a prime time dinner spot (especially with the price tag), but I did really enjoy it!

One weird thing worth noting:  we ordered soda water, but it wasn't until the end of the meal that I realized it was being poured from a fancy bottle instead of simply served from behind the bar.  And then the bill came:  $7/bottle.  Oooooooops.",nal0Ev3PeRVCdMgU82PEmw,0,0,4,5VIdyJuQQtqigh5vbQ2sXA

In typical Las Vegas fashion, you can spend as much as you want here. But if you are tight on money, 2 can eat here for under $25 very easily.

Booked through Open Table, and was seated right away in a small room in the back. Was the first time i was back here, usually sat on the plaza. I love sitting out there, especially when the opera singers and violinists are performing. The Venetian is so pretty, I love walking through it along the canals with gondolas. 

I have been to both locations of Otto, Las Vegas, and New York City. The menus are pretty similar, but i find the wine list is better in NYC. I am a fan of this really obscure Italian wine, and the NYC location has it, LV doesn't. But don't let my snobbery cloud a really good wine list in LV.

You can order 2 different sizes of salads, which i like. Had the arugula and parmesan which was very tasty!

The pizza's here are fantastic. Had the house-made sausage and peppers pizza which was cooked perfectly. The sausage has a bit of heat to it, and the thin crust is awesomely cooked.

I definitely recommend this spot.   While the dishes seem basic they are very well made.  It really makes you appreciate the quality in a simple well-made dish.

We were fortunate to snag a table for dinner right along the rail in the ""courtyard"" meaning that we enjoyed the string quartet that was playing as well as the incomparable people watching that Vegas casinos offer. If you were with a significant other, it would be pretty romantic - all the atmosphere of St Mark's Square in Venice without the worry of being shit on by hordes of pigeons. As it was, I was here for work and had to confine myself to enjoying the fashion choices of the tourist hordes.

Wine - well, an enoteca generally means ""wine bar"" where the choices are many and the price is reasonable. This is Vegas - the choices are many, but the prices are mighty. That said, I did have the best prosecco I can recall (bone dry) for a relatively reasonable $12/glass.

Food - I had a hard time choosing between pizza and meatballs. But at the end of the day, who doesn't want to sample Mario Batali's balls, amirite? All ball jokes aside, my meal was really good - if meatballs could ever be described as ""light"", these were. I liked that they were served with polenta rather than pasta. And the serving was generous - 3 large meatballs. Personally, I can only handle two balls at a time. (sorry, couldn't resist)

Side - Cold peas with prosciutto & mint - absolutely delightful.

Service - slightly above average. We didn't see her a lot but no real issues either.

Two further questions:

Does ""Otto"" mean something in Italian? Otherwise, it kind of seems odd to name a restaurant after the bus driver on the Simpsons.

This place is located across the piazza from a Wolfgang Puck joint. Do the servers here fight it out after hours a la the Sharks and the Jets? Because that would be pretty awesome.",PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,1,1,4,s4D42i6PlN4rqG_hpQ1R4Q

I also wanted to try something different.  We arrived a bit earlier than our 5 o'clock reservation and I didn't see my awesome waiter from last time, Jeffrey, so I didn't bother to ask to be in his section.  That sadly was an error.  He did show up right around 5 but it was too late by then.  The waiter I got assigned wasn't nearly so attentive (he actually disappeared partway through our meal) and to be honest, much as I hate to say it, I could barely understand his accent so I didn't ask as many questions about the menu as the first time.

We ordered five cheeses - the three I had last time plus gorgonzola and parmesano reggiano.  I love blue cheeses but the gorgonzola was actually a bit too strong for me, which I found really surprising.  My favorites this time were the aged goat cheese and the parmesan.  I still love the cherries that come with that dish.

For entrees my honey ordered the lasagna and I ordered the sausage and peppers pizza.  I had a bite of his lasagna and thought it was very good.  The pizza alas was just mediocre.  The sausage didn't have much flavor and it was sparse on cheese, though the cheese was good quality, and to be frank I didn't find the sauce very flavorful.  I preferred the goat cheese pancetta pizza from last time, which was different enough from a 'normal' pizza that I wouldn't compare the two directly.

For dessert we tried the cherry shortcake which was pretty good.  The cherries were sadly not the same ones as on the cheese plate which is what we were hoping for, but were more like queen anne cherries.  It was still a decent dessert but didn't hold a candle to the amazing pear sorbetto from last time which alas was not offered on this visit.

I still like the restaurant overall but I'm feeling like it's very hit or miss, with some potential for greatness that isn't always realized.",51Dg7npqsTegnd1ZDxVb3w,0,0,4,14pmQZQjgUqX32M74SZZvw

Otto's has an eviable location and whilst staying at the Venetian hotel with my 70 year old mother-in-law and twin 7 year old boys, convenience and an easily acquired view (of the Venetian square) counted for a lot.  Unfortunately, our dining experience was ruined by the staff's refusal to provide a side of pasta with marinara sauce to my mother-in-law!  She's from back east, so she's used to family style Italian places where one gets a side of pasta with a main course. They had the audacity to suggest we purchase another entree of spaghetti and meatballs for $23!  I went escalated to the manager and received the same response. I was told at one point that because the food is prepared in a kitchen that's not actually on the immediate premises, custom orders are not possible. It surprises me that an Italian restaurant with these price tags wouldn't be able to produce a plate of ""pasta with marinara"" by request. Given the sponsor chefs (Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich) are of such notoriety, I was surprised and disappointed.  Maybe they treated us poorly because we had our 7 year old twin boys with us or we didn't look sufficiently sophisticated.

Our assistant waiter came with bread and water quite promptly.  Our waiter was friendly and casual.

I ordered a bellini which was not a slushy drink but still good.  The bread was good and I like how it came with the dipping oil and vinegar.  They brought out 3 pieces for 2 people which I didn't quite understand why they didn't have even number of pieces.  But I guess that was all that would fit on the late.  

The menu contains more wine choices that food so if you want to try a different wine, this would be a great place to go.  I had the rigatoni ragu with veal and pork shredded in tomato sauce with the pasta.  The portion wasn't too big but just right and saved enough room for dessert.  I liked the meat as it was different from meatballs but filling.  During the meal, we asked for more bread and the assistant waiter was very quick to respond to our request and told us to let him know if we wanted more.

For dessert we had the tiramisu.  It's not the usual tiramisu that I've had but it was good and I liked the espresso gelato.  It's definitely pricey at $14 though.

We didn't make reservations and were seated inside the wine room.  Only complaint was that it was pretty stuffy inside which I thought was weird considering the amount of wine they had nearby on the shelves.

As we were browsing the menu, a server brought over the water along with some bread http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#BybPUIq7bTLkopItCcsTXA.  

We opted to share a few appetizers which included the sweet potato croccheta and the spiedini http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#64U553oYf5iPiEJNBYzcSw.  Both were fried to a dark golden brown and were tasty.  Highly recommend the spiedini as it came out hot and was like eating a gooey cheese melt.

Next appetizer we shared was an assorted vegetable antipasti which comprised of the following marinated olives, eggplant caponata, roasted parsnips, roasted cauliflower, and the otto pickles.  All were tasty but be warned that the pickles have a very very strong vinegar taste to them which people may/may not like.

We then shared the prosciutto and arugula pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#vreDtfVTfDNJCRA3SZqRGQ.  I cannot tell you how good this pizza was!!  The crust was crispy throughout and combination of prosciutto, mozarella cheese and their sauce was amazing!  This is where the vast majority of pizzerias that serve thin crust pizzas fail as it's soggy in the middle of the pizza.

Next up was the gemelli pasta which consisted of their homemade sausage with broccoli rabe bits http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#6Q7NoNkvAMfRK_jyyFYILA.  The sausage once again did not disaapoint and was simply awesome.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the broccoli rabe and sausage combination was to die for.

The menu is the same.  You get to select the number of items you want to try or share from a well chosen list of cheeses, cured meats, salads, fried items and if you like, add pastas or pizzas to your starter.  Fun.

Wines by the glass are still 250ml pours making them a great deal.

The slip in quality is found in the service and quality of the prepared items.

I am a regular and several managers and servers know me so I have never had any problem with service however, another guest sitting at the bar next to me was told that she had to pay $5 if she wanted an extra marinated cherry with her cheese course.  Another asked for additional olive oil for his bread, his server told him that they give you enough for your bread and wanted to be sure that he would not waste the additional oil.

As for my food the fried cauliflower was heavily coated in uncooked batter and the pasta was extremely salty.  I sent the pasta  back but thanks to a language barrier (the busser did not speak good English), my dish returned with NO salt.

5102815,2012-08-28,1,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"A harrowing experience that I have never forgotten 

On December the 27th, 2010, my family and I decided to eat at this establishment, a quaint and attractive corral of tables inside the Venitian. Thinking that pizza was universal enough and since I love cheese, I ordered the pizza quatro fromaggi. It should be called the ""pizza quatro dimone."" 

While my fellow diners were privileged to partake in good and tasteful victuals, my experience was horrifically different. The ""pizza"" arrived, a thin yet textureless crust more bland than a saltine cracker. Oh, what I would have given for the remainder of that meal to have been so bland! 

The sauce was somehow simultaneously as bitter as orange juice served in an aluminum cup and as sweet as frosting, smothered atop the pizza in a bloody masacre-like fashion. The surface of the pizza would have been only sauce, but for one horrific, greasy, formless globule of cheese in the center of each piece. I'll never know if it was the Tallegio or the Cacio that fell me.  

And here, I start to go blank. The memories, the horror... 
The taste of bile and frosting mixed with locker-room sweat and sourness, mixed with the at once rosey yet musky dirty-water ""Esscence of the Venitian"" scent wafting through the air ducts. I could taste nothing but that for days. Every food I ate for the rest of the day tasted of IT. 

Now I sit here, more than two years later, still remembering every once in a while that terrible taste, that permiating aroma. I can still smell it on-call, just by remembering. 

Shame on you, Mario Batalli. In all of your culinary genious, you have hidden ONE fateful dish on your menu, making for a cruel game of russian roulette.

We ordered a cheese platter with some nice condiments like apricot marmalade, cherries and honey that went amazingly well with the ricotta cheese. I don't remember what other cheeses we ordered, I think there were like 8 different kinds on there. They were cheeses that you could buy at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods or even possibly at an Italian Deli, which I'm sure would be way better. That platter alone was about $30 and we ordered 2 different pizzas....might I say I had better. I would prefer a Pizza from Pizzamania in Long Beach, Ca. over the pizza from Otto.

My boyfriend and I had a Grilled Pork Chop for our entree, the server suggested for the pork to be cooked medium rare...but when we got it it was well done and dry.

Unfortunately ownership has since changed and although the menu looks almost identical to its earlier version, the quality has dropped a great deal. As things stand now, Enoteca has 2 things going for it: a good location in the middle of the replica of St. Mark's square which means that you will get a chance to see a performance of the ""Phantom"" soundtrack and some Italian opera pieces during dinner and that you won't pay an arm and a leg for a meal. The pizzas are about $18-21 each and are sufficient to keep you satiated and  one can easily feed 2 diners if you add an appetizer or 2. I would say the Prosciutto and Goat Cheese pizza is the best, although the last time I ordered it the pizza came out burnt and overloaded with cheese. Do yourself a favor and don't order the Pesto Pizza; it is supremely disappointing. Finally the wine list is (as expected) dominated by Italian vintages but the staff does not offer much in the way of suggestions if you're having trouble deciding. Their pours of wine are also stingy and the waiter made the mistake of using a wide rimmed glass for champagne.

After we placed our order with the waitress, the breadman came by with a plate of cold bread...didn't even bother to offer some olive oil or cracked black pepper (all the other tables that came after us had those offered tableside).

The last time we saw the waitress was when she shoved the dessert menu right in front of my wife's face...pretty rude.

As for the food...mediocre.  Friday's special was the carbonara pizza.  It was a fair dish...the egg was slightly over-cooked.  DO NOT get the artichoke pizza.  The prosciutto they used was completely flavorless and the scariest part is...that more than half of each slice was pure fat!  So, as you bite into the slightly sour (from artichoke...tasted like they are from a can) and spicy (from chilli) pizza slice, you get a mouth full of white, greasy flavorless fat.

Rather than caring about money and hiring rude but cheap servers and using less-than-quality ingredients, maybe he should care more about his customers.",OOOV0Ezzy68E9cfYgx5dMA,2,1,2,OJbKsqlzSWz16L7XjHXTsw

Firstly, we loved our server.  He was so patient and offered us a reasonably priced wine after we described they type of wine we like.  He offered wonderful suggestions and didn't push us to order too much, or too little.  

We stared with several appetizers:  ricotta fritters, which were incredible, lentils, way better than I expected them to be...(I wish they sold those at Trader Joe's), and two cheeses which were accompanied by jam and honey to compliment them.  We had a goat cheese and a cow's milk cheese.  

By the time we had gotten through the appetizers we were too full to each get a main course.  We were in the mood for pizza and split the eggplant pizza.  The eggplant was shaved thin.  The pizza had red sauce, which I love and the crust was perfectly thin but not so thin that the slice drooped onto your hand.  It was a fantastic pizza.

5341481,2012-03-26,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"I like to judge Italian restaurants on their margherita pizzas and spaghetti with tomato sauce.  Both of these dishes are very simple, but if done right, can be amazing.  Based upon the server mentioning how small the dishes are, we ordered both, along with a sausage and peppers pizza, and a cheese plate.  The portions were not as small as the waiter said or what other reviewers have mentioned, and we are not exactly lightweights.  

We started with a cheese plate of bufala mozzarella, taleggio, and Cypress Grove goat cheese.  The plate was served with bread, cherries, apricot, and most importantly, honey with black truffle.  All three cheeses were great, and I loved the honey with black truffles.

The margherita pizza was very good.  What really made it stand out was how crispy the crust was.  Many pizzas tend to get soggy over time, as the sauce seeps into the crust, but this remained crispy until the end.  The sauce had a nice fresh tomato flavor.  The cheese was good, though I wish it had more of it.  It was not the best margherita I have had, but I would definitely order it again.

The spaghetti and meatballs were good but over salted.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  The sauce would have been better with about 1/3 less salt.  The meatballs had nice flavor and added a little kick to the dish.  I was hoping the dish would be in the same class as spaghetti at Scarpetta, but it most certainly was not.

The service was great.

My husband and I ordered a salad to split along with a pizza to share, including drinks.  First, I notice others were getting bread with dipping oil while there food was being prepared.  We did not.  What we received was our pizza? No salad, no bread and no water refills. When I asked the server if we'd get our salad he seemed puzzled. A few minutes later the salad and bread appeared, still no water.  So we were sitting in front of all our food at one time.  Not sure about you, but i like to enjoy my salad and then have my entree nice and hot.  By the time we were ready for our entree of course it was cool.  Our server offered to reheat it and we accepted.  A while later the pizza was brought back to our table BURNT.  I'm not exaggerating, it was three quarts of the crust was burnt, yes black crust. Did no one notice it was burnt?  Why would you serve a burnt pizza? Now we had to ask for a new one.  
It would have been so wonderful if our server would have come out and said, the pizza was not to their standards and they will be making us a fresh pizza.  If that would have happened I'd give them a 4 stars!  But it did not and we were put in the awkward position of asking for a new one. We waited and waited and finally received our mediocre pizza. Ugh, such a waste with so many other wonderful Italian restaurants in the local vicinity.  
Finally they brought us our pricey check.  I'm okay with pricey when the meal matches, but it did not.  No, offer of compensation for all the mishaps.

I had a pizza which was cold by the time I got it. It wasn't that busy and it didn't take long for our food to arrive so I have to wonder why it was cold. 
Quite frankly it tasted like a frozen pizza. Let me rephrase that as it was an insult to frozen pizza - those are usually warm. The crust tasted like cardboard and it looked like they had trouble cutting the slices as it wasn't even cut all the way through.

5349870,2012-07-12,0,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,"I went back and forth on whether to give this place 5 stars or 4.  Not because I don't think it deserves 5, but because I don't want people to think I give top ratings to everywhere I eat.  The truth is, I generally only rate a place if it is really good or really bad.....and I mean reallllly bad.  I don't like being negative or nitpicking unless they have truly offended me or made me feel they have stolen my money.  That being said, I've had nothing but great experiences here and so I can't help but give it the 5 Star treatment.

The cavatappi with lamb ragu dish is mind-blowing. I will admit, I'm a sucker for lamb and this dish is one of the reasons why. I must have had it for the first time 4-5 years ago and it's what keeps me coming back every time I am in Vegas.  The meat and cheese platters are delicious, but a little on the pricey side.  Not that it isn't worth it for the quality you get, but it can really make the bill add up if you go crazy (which I tend to do).

Funny enough, I'd say the one thing you shouldn't get here is the pizzas.  I've had some friends that loved them and some that didn't. I haven't really tried them to be honest.  I just know that if I am going to spend the money to go out in Vegas, I wanna get something I can't normally get everyday. So I'd say if you venture out, try the unique dishes or the charcuterie, you'll love it.  If you just wanna eat some pizza, go find a local pizza spot and you'll walk away with some extra dough.....see what I did there....okay, I'll stop now.",ZoCRoAn-KPfHD6c-mBnO3w,0,1,5,cdlAcT3TJL-aEt56mgRUdw

I was not impressed with Mozza (another Batali pizza place in CA), so my expectations were low. The cheese was insane! It was sooo fresh and creamy and light, it wasn't leathery at all! The dough stayed crisp at the bottom, which I have never seen before. Usually when u first get a thin crust pizza at your table, the first slice is nice and crisp, but the following slices get soggy and buckle when you pick them up. This one held it's shape like a crisp little cracker, but it had that unmistakeable chew of a pizza.  My GF was obsessed and she said it deserves 5 stars. I did wish the sauce had a little sweetness (it's more salty than sweet) and maybe a pinch of oregano. My other favorite Pizza place is Tirovino in LA.

 I was really disappointed with the gelato. I ordered the Graham Cracker, Almond Ice Milk, and Dark Chocolate Malt. They were packed in layers in a little metal cup, which irritated me, I wanted to taste each flavor, not have them all mashed together! Wtf?  I tried to separate them as best I could but the flavors were kind of boring and not as interesting as I thought they would be. The ice milk was the best but it wasn't a smooth creamy gelato, more like an icy sorbet. I couldn't taste the malt in the chocolate one at all, Too bad, because I love malt! The graham cracker texture was nice, but this needed a pinch of sea salt or something. I got a cone on the side and it looked fine, but tasted burnt. Anyway, it definitely wasn't worth $13.

 Our 2 waiters were knowledgeable and knew how each dish was prepared, which added to my appreciation of each dish as well. The atmosphere was truly breathtaking as well and hearing the opera singers, who were very talented, was a total extraordinary sensory experience!

It's in a big wide open area with high ceilings painted to look like the sky so it really gives you a feeling of being at the real Piazza San Marco - actually better since its AC, not in the direct sun, no mega crowds and clean :)

That being said I really used to love the bruschetta there.  The standard bruschetta, not the daily ""special of the day"" bruschetta they serve now.  That and maybe either the bread changed or I'm a little pickier about the bread or dough.  

The pic is attached but the garlic, honey, prosciutto looks and tastes like ham on a big jelly baguette.  Not what I was expecting and disappointing. 

So I usually have some kind of pizza and really felt like a meat lovers so requested a salami and prosciutto combo.  I was warned (and should have listened) that the salami is aged and has a strong, gamey taste to it.  Wasn't a good choice but my bad.  The second thing that was disappointing was that the pizza wasn't hot or fresh.  Tasted almost like it was reheated - and not reheated enough.  Really disappointing as you can totally tell when you're eating old leftover pizza...

That was two disappointments for the food.  I still love the atmosphere and the service - the busser, waiter and host were all tremendous with excellent service.  They just don't reheat or cook the food.

The only thing going for the spaghetti allá chitarra is that it had a bit of a kick. Each bite was a mouthful of sand, I don't think they even rinsed the clams. I think I may have chipped a tooth (jk). This was extremely salty, even more salty than my review.  Had we not been famished from exploring the strip all day, we would not have eaten it.

Penne allá Norma was decent, but not particularly memorable. Ingredients tasted fairly fresh. 

SERVICE
Friendly, attentive staff is the primary reason for the stars given.

Firstly, the hostess was the rudest, coldest person and the management should be mocked for hiring such a person.

Last but not least, after our food was finished we sat for almost 30 minutes without anyone checking on us. I actually had to raise my arm to receive our check.

The food: we ordered the grilled radicchio salad which was different, and some antipasti specials for happy hour. Food was fair but then we did not order a pasta, pizza, or an entree so i can't say with surety.

I have been numerous times and I find it very consistent, consistently good.
This is pretty authentic Italian food. Not the basic American version with heavy sauces and a ladle of sauce on a mound of spaghetti. 
While I have not tried the entire menu, I have had the privilege of having several items. 
I always start with the Ricotta Fritters. These are crunchy yet creamy deep fried balls of ricotta cheese. I dare you to try and eat just one.
I usually follow that up with the Rigatoni with Ragu Napolitana. It is served a bit al dente, so if you prefer softer pasta, ask them to cook it a little longer. The ragu is light with a flavorful blend of shredded veal and pork. 
I have also had two different pizzas. The Margherita and the Sausage and Peppers. Both were wood fired with a light crisp crust. I preferred the Margherita. It was so light and fresh. The perfect amount of sauce as to not over power it. It's making my mouth water thinking about it.
In the past I have also tried the Ravioli (Butternut Squash with Browned Butter and Sage drizzled on top) and the Gemelli (with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe). Again both were very good.
The portions are a bit on the small size, however, they are deceivingly filling. 
I have read several reviews that mention they think that the price is a bit high, even for Vegas. I would agree with them. But you must consider the location, ambiance and the Operatic singers and minstrels that are playing and singing in the square. 
If you are looking for quiet, you may want to sit inside. If not, the patio is great!

Our bachelor party of 12 dudes needed a casual spot to get food without spending too much (in the realm of Strip restaurants), and without traveling too far. Otto Enoteca fulfilled all of those needs quite well. Located by the shops in the Venetian, the space is surprisingly small for how big it looks from the outside, but we were able to get seated right away without a reservation, and drinks/water were distributed very quickly.

We all split some arancini (fried rice balls), which were quite excellent, so much so, that we ended up getting more orders of it to start off. As for my entree, I got the carbonara pizza, which had egg, scallion and guanciale on top, and was quite excellent. I assumed that the egg would just be a runny yolk on top, but it was actually scrambled on top, which turned out really well. The scallion had just enough bite to cut through the richness of the pizza, and I finished the pizza off quite quickly, almost wanting some more. 

Service was pretty helpful and attentive, as much as can be in the late afternoon for a group of 12 hungry dudes. Prices were pretty much on par for a casual sit-down for the Strip, with pizzas around $20, and cocktails/wine were about $11-12.

Given the names behind this place (Batali and Bastianich), it's a pretty decent place for Italian if you're staying in the Venetian, but perhaps nothing to go out of your way for.

The truffle pizza is really potato-y with just the right amount of truffle that didn't overpower all the flavor. We also had the braised pork shoulder which was really tender and well-seasoned. The cucumber on top was a really nice contrast in texture and gave it a refreshing bite. 

Being serenaded by the live music on the canal was nice, despite the loud gaggles of Asian tourists snapping photos with their iPads. 

This was almost a 4-star review, but I am docking a star for the following reason:

The bill came out while my boyfriend was in the bathroom, so I put my card in and paid. When the check came back out for us to sign, the manager / host (he was checking people in but was also checking on the tables, so I assume he was some kind of manager) handed it to my boyfriend and said, ""Thank you, Stephen."" It may have been an innocent mistake, but it definitely came off as misogyny. It's the 21st century - women are allowed to pick up the tab once in a while. Poor form!",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,1,1,3,GX_Umkr7hCCzFd-v1DNPeA

I ordered the Pasta Norma, it was just ok. Really did not like the texture of the ricotta used in this dish.

Hubby ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, he enjoyed it.

Overall - too expensive for what you get. There are way too many restaurants to try for me to ever give this another chance.",1vTcHEsdA4202XJbNoTDtQ,0,0,3,lCdc9dgWCxMvSDLju2cezw

Started off with the mushroom bruschetta- the mushrooms were tasty even if the bread was slightly on the too crunchy side. It was topped by a light cheese (I'm sorry I don't know exactly what kind cheese it was but it tasted like provolone) and some chives to cut the richness of the dish. 

For my main, I ordered the chicken paillard. The dish had many layers, starting with a slice of fried eggplant for crunch and bitterness. On it, they spread ricotta to add a creamy texture to the dish. They then added a layer of tomatoes followed by two layers of grilled chicken. The charred edges of the chicken added the perfect amount of smokiness to offset the ricotta. For a little bite and a little acid, they placed arugula that was dressed in a vinaigrette.  A little olive oil finished the dish.  It's a beautiful dish and worth a try. 

For dessert, I had a pumpkin cheesecake. It's an interesting dish, composed of both crispy pumpkin chips (tastes similar to sweet potato chips) and thicker slices either boiled or grilled. Underneath was mascarpone (the cheese in the ""cheesecake"") nuts and graham cracker to mimic the flavours of a cheesecake. It was an interesting dessert but definitely not a sweet finish. If you want something sweet, then go for something else, like the gelato that they make in-house. 

The only not so nice thing is the lighting - it's a bit too dark for my taste. 

Tip: Daily specials are great - check the back of the menu. 
Tip: If you're the designated driver of the night, ask about their sodas; they also make them fresh in-house.",60OhUP904CWpFUOWKdI1gg,0,0,4,S6dJaP7SGXbkMfk6s4Kmcw
