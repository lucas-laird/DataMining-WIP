Our experience at the downtown Summerlin location could not have been better, from being greeted upon entry, to the great service we received at the register when we ordered, to the service when and after we got our food, which was delicious AND healthy (we ordered from the ""healthy"" side of the menu).

My wife got the ""TATS"" sandwich, and I got the ""Steakation,"" and we split the Tu-Nuts. All delicious and satisfying. My wife took half of her sandwich home. They also, surprisingly, had AMAZING beers!! I tried the bourbon-barrel-aged brown ale and the bourbon-barrel-aged dark Belgian. I'd never heard of the latter, but both were excellent.

My best friend and I got there before our other friend, and we wanted to wait for her arrival before we ordered food. We went up to the cashier to just order some beers first, but due to their liquor license, you can't order any alcohol without ordering food too. We thought this was strange and inconvenient. The cashier was extremely friendly and knowledgeable on the beer. The beer was really good and tasted just as she described it. I ordered two filet mignon tacos for $7.95 and they were by far the worst tacos I have ever had in my life. The filet mignon tasted bland and was COLD. There really wasn't much in the taco besides shredded onions that looked like some sort of white cheese but there was no cheese at all in the tacos, or sauce, or sour cream, or guacamole, so they were just cold, bland, and dry. I probably wouldn't return. There is much better places to eat and drink at inside this mall.",aiSMCaIQzyLgJu7xXHfuoA,0,0,2,NMnQ59DfeB90QT8PoTMLcg

Just like the name, there's a skinny (healthy) side and a (happy) fat side of the menu, if you're reading this review to gain some insight of the skinny side, stop here. 

Yes, you'll be paying a bit more for the foods here, but for the quality and taste, it's worth it. With that being said, definitely don't see me here every lunch break. 

My favorite is the Filet-O-Fire ($14). When I first saw it, looked like it wouldn't suffice as a meal, but it was perfect. I love spicy food so it wasn't intense, but if you think hot Cheetos are spicy, have a drink just in case. 

If you're a sauce kind of person for the fries, they have a variety to pick from and if you absolutely love it, can pick a bottle up for home. I love their fountain drinks since it's the cane sugar company. And if you have room, the caramel salted cookie is amazing",wdJKGY0xI5jpFrEL4Gm2fQ,2,2,5,rAHM4fZHUbx2IG4hefSzLA

Better pack an appetite! The wait on a Saturday can be 30 minutes or longer, to order your food. Every minute worth it. 
I ordered the Turkey burger which was beyond expectation! The portion was HUGE! I could only eat half, and took the rest home.  The flavor was amazing. I want to try everything on the menu.
The atmosphere is very fun and lively! Great music and Vibe. They have employees working the dining room, immediately cleaning tables. My favorite was the cool Salt and Pepper Shakers on every table! 
I wasn't a huge fan of the soda there. I'm partial to Pepsi and Coke, but wouldn't stop me from going in. Most people may really like trying something different.
Be prepared to spend at least $10.00 per person. Worth every penny!

That is one of my favorite things about SkinnyFATS, I love the murals/artwork/decor and overall ambiance of each location. The staff is always very attentive, and informative (I love how they let you customize anything on the menu to make it perfect for you).

I ordered the Blaze of Thunder, and a side of Truffle Fries, also an order of the Fats' Pickles, and the Dem Greens.

The Blaze of Thunder was spicy, but paired perfectly with the Brioche bun and creamy slaw. I asked for extra pickles and it was a good choice, because they were delicious.

 This got me hyped to move on and try the Fats' Pickles. These are fried pickle chips ( vs. spears) and they are perfectly seasoned, and breaded. I asked for extra of the aioli (I use it for the Truffle Fries), and almost finished the pickles off before realizing I had two more items!

The truffle fries are my staple side go-to, and always ask for them extra crispy. These are a perfect pair with any of the burgers/sandwiches, and one of my favorite things to get at SkinnyFATS regardless of my order.

I saved the Dem Greens for last, and truly love this salad because of the dressing. It is a truffle caper vinaigrette, and pairs perfectly with the capers and cherry tomatoes in the salad. SkinnyFATS also has my favorite ranch dressing on the planet, and I hope one day they will bottle that up like their ketchups! (I LOVE THEIR BOTTLED KETCHUPS).

Overall great visit. Very excited for this location (closer to my house).

1941760,2017-11-27,0,j4F5LtyQ3_dKLJbIEkwFpQ,"At Skinny Fats you must answer a difficult question of willpower and choose whether to be Good or Bad. They have a healthy side of the menu with dishes less than 600 calories right across from a happy side with 600+ calorie indulgences. 

Walking up this skinny fats has a corner suite next to an open air shopping walkway in Downtown Summerlin. This location is different than the other two in that there is very little parking right outside but in my opinion this is the nicest. Like the southwest restaurant this one had a retractable glass wall that allows for open air dining. 

They have many vegan, vegetarian, GF options that are clearly marked on the menu, making it super easy for people like me. Also you can sub grilled or fried tofu for almost all of the meats on the menu for additional vegetarian and vegan choices. 

I ordered the ""Stuff on Curry"" which was pad Thai noodles with a curry sauce and fried chickpeas. My husband got the ""Hot Chix"" which is a salad with blue cheese deep fried jalapeños and ranch dressing and avocado with buffalo chicken. They were delicious, packed with flavor, and we will be back for more.

1947797,2018-01-13,1,j4F5LtyQ3_dKLJbIEkwFpQ,"I checked this place out last night with the entire family. There was 5 of us.  I'm giving this a 4 Star due to a few things I believe they can easily improve on

Positives: 
-Food is amazing.  Love the variety of flavors
-Staff around the cooking section and the two guys were really cool. The guys both came by and asked us how the food was a few times but it could be because we sat right up at the high top counter 
-Crayons provided to kids when asked. You have to know they provide these upon request. We have 3 kids from 2-7years old. Big plus for us 
-loved the Special Benny that I ordered. Genius concept and so delicious!  This place has specials is what I'm told so you have to ask. Its not on the regular menu. 

Negatives: 
1) Not a lot of seats. I had to sit my 2 year old on me while sitting on the high counter seats next to the kitchen. Not comfortable at all but they were packed inside. Nobody sat outside.  I would suggest putting heaters or telling customers that there are heaters if they do have them.  Really do not want to eat with a 2 year old on my lap on a bar stool the whole time. That was annoying. 
2) Did not like that their kids meals doesn't come with a drink. You have to purchase the drink and costs 1.95 if I recall correctly.  I have 3 kids. That adds up for us.  For this place to be a non waited service Restaurant, the 1.95 on top of the 4.95-5.95 meals can add up and I don't have a seat for my 2 year old. ... seems a bit costly.  
(In my opinion, you can go to Lazy Dog and be able to order kids meal, be waited on with comfortable booths for everybody and it costs less.  Also includes crayons for the kids and their kids meals wont add the extra drink cost) 
3) When we were waiting in line something happened three people before us that caused a stop in line for about 5 min.  There was only one person at the check out line with a huge line just adding up for ordering. I don't know what the issue was but it took a good 15-20 min to order your food. Then you gotta factor the wait time for the food to be cooked. Maybe just one of those random things we got caught in. Hopefully not this bad all the time and that's why I was comparing it to Lazy Dogs. After 20 min in line, I really don't want to have my 2 year old sit on me while I eat and scarf the food down as fast as I can.

Probably not going to come back again with the kids unless it's not busy or someone approves on seating. I'm not someone who can place my jacket and purse down and leave my 2,5, and 7 year old to reserve a seat while I order so I'm screwed.",r6bTtMJ26w3Vy46CxYJu0w,3,1,4,vDbWV_86E4sg2nrb8xDbwQ
2002736,2018-04-13,0,j4F5LtyQ3_dKLJbIEkwFpQ,"Love this place! Definitely get there early for lunch because the line will whip around the block if you snooze. 

I ordered the Steakation sandwich from the ""Skinny"" side and couldn't believe it was under 500 calories! It was so delicious and super filling. It also came with a side, and I chose a salad, and the ""side"" salad was HUGE. That could have been a meal in itself!

We also treated ourselves to their vegan, gluten free red velvet cake and, holy cow. That tasted every bit as decadent as a standard cake! It was great. The woman taking our order was extremely patient and helpful, being that it was our first time as well. She suggested her favorites and led us through the menu.

The ""happy"" side of the menu has more not-so-healthy food that maybe I'll try in the future, but for now I'll stick to the skinny food that is still tasty!",YEg9YxQQ0dL5ajzkwokyyQ,0,0,5,2rem2buRpxcwAqH3nq321A

2006269,2018-06-11,0,j4F5LtyQ3_dKLJbIEkwFpQ,"You know when you find a place that you can't say enough good things about?

SkinnyFATS in downtown summerlin is exactly one of those places. From the moment you walk in the staff is friendly and ready to help you fulfill your dining needs.

Which they gloriously do. I had been hesitant at first to go when they first opened because I am a creature of habit. 

Yet after trying their delicious food once, it was an Ahi teriyaki sandwich and sweet potato fries, I was hooked. 

Chicken, beef, fish, vegetables, they truly had it all. I had meant to write them a review for quite some time because, well, it's truly an amazing environment. 

They have both a healthy and happy side - mind you the healthy side doesn't lack in the taste department.

Steakation and the ahi teriyaki are my go to sandwiches from the healthy side - both phenomenal - highly recommend and then there are also bowls with delicious jasmine rice.

The happy side--- it just opens a world of possibilities you would have have fathomed.

Beverage side - they also have pressed juices and a myriad of unique pop flavors that I have not seen elsewhere. 

For example, how do you make a cheese steak better? 

Add a whole bunch of amazing cheese! Like a French dip with cheese, the sweet cheesus is amazing. 

In the mood for a burger? Try that cherry popper, it's got a nice kick with the jalapeños and the combination with the beef/bun/slaw is what dreams are made of.

Don't want rice bowls with chicken, fish, a burger, or a sandwich at all?

Never fear they serve breakfast all day. Their healthy wrap supastar is quite delicious with the Cajun cilantro and egg white burrito, but for a truly magnificent experience, the smotherload is on a whole new level.

You want to know what goes in a great breakfast burrito? Of course you were thinking filet mignon, right? 

Cause that's in there.

This is a top notch breakfast burrito and one of the most delicious ones I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.

You'll probably need a fork though because none of these foods will leave you with inadequate portions.

As you can see, I can't stop saying enough positive things about this location. I recommend it to everyone I can and highly advise you go in and be greeted by the wonderful ladies in the front yourself.

You won't be disappointed I assure you.",Cmg8w_sM9LgFlvr3wqqGqQ,0,1,5,PviHLvbGsE0vMcUh1GtbYw

I ordered the Sweet Cheese Us, it's like a Philly Cheese steak belive me it was really GRATE haha no pun intended. Mainly because this had the perfect amount melty cheese. Yum!
My hubby got the Shrimp Tacodillas. I had a bite and they were pretty good. The quality of the Shrimp was very good and it was a small size taco.
My bff got the Hot Chic salad. They didn't skimp out on the avocado which is great. It tasted like boneless hot wings mixed with a salad.

- Buffchix: freaking awesome buffalo like chicken tenders with truffle fries. 
- A blazin hot chicken sandwich which is just out of this world. It is has a nice kick to it. I think it's hotter than most of their menu items. You can chose your side- I'm biased and love the fries. 
- Smootherload: amazingggg breakfast burrito loaded with the staples and topped with a cheese sauce of some sort! Ummm delicious. 
- Chickenwaffledoplias: I just butchered the spelling of it... but basically great chicken and waffles. Now I have never had real chicken and waffles but they know how to make a damn good fried chicken and a fluffy waffle so I'm happy!

The food took a little bit to get here and they forgot my beer, I had to ask for it twice. They said they had to change the tap so it took a little bit. 

I ordered the Bleu Balsamic salad. Spinach salad with red onions topped with bleu cheese and balsamic dressing. They dont joke around with the bleu cheese for sure! They put a lot of blue cheese crumbs on top. The steak was so good tho!

Turnip tacos were great.. lot of cheese ad the meat was cooked perfectly. Very tender and tasty. 

They have cucumber water free of charge by the drink station. 

The outside seating area is great with comfy chairs/seating, theres a fireplace for cold nights. 

The menu has a variety of healthy and ""happy"" choices, so theres something for everyone.

Although I didn't see it on the menu here, you can order a red velvet waffle. I think it's on their secret menu? Anyway I tried it at the other location and it was delicious! At this location, I decided to be on the ""healthy"" side and ordered ""Naked Chix"" bowl while my brother decided to be on the ""happy"" side and ordered ""More Cow Bowl"".

- Red velvet waffle: Topped with cream cheese frosting, chocolate sauce, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and powdered sugar. Try it! 

- Naked Chix: Mango basil chicken with jasmine rice topped with cilantro yo. Delicious! The chicken was tender and the portion was perfect. 

- More Cow Bowl: Teriyaki filet mignon, cauliflower, portobello, peppers, scallion, egg fried rice. Since this wasn't my order, I only got to try some of it but I liked it and so did my brother! They gave a good amount of meat and it was tender! It was delicious as well!

Their interior design has always been spot on & this location totally shows it.

Food
I ordered their chicken and waffles and my fiancé ordered a breakfast burrito. He loved his burrito, but I wasn't impressed with the chicken and waffles. The chicken was pretty plain and nothing to make me order it again. However; I'm willing to give the food a second shot. I've seen some great items on the menu that I want to try.

Drinks
They offer alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks. The sodas are all natural and I've heard great things about their smoothies.

This go around I didn't eat all day. I wanted to be hungry, senses keen, taste buds primed. There are two sides to the menu, a healthy side and a happy side. Another reviewer kindly told me to focus on the happy side! 

My daughter got the chicken and waffles, my boy got the protein waffle with berries. I got the Thai salad with added ahi tuna. 

The salad. It's a good salad. Mango, bacon (real chopped bacon, not bits out of a can) green onions, romaine, peanut dressing...a wonderful bowl of munchies diced to the perfect size. I was satisfied with the quantity. 

Chicken and waffles, super. The only drawback, the fried chicken didn't have enough seasoning but they do use excellent maple syrup. It doesn't taste like corn syrup gluttony so one might enjoy the flavor and crispness of the waffle. Same goes with my boy's. 

I'm so much happier with this experience than my first. The staff jokes with each other. They like to see who comes in. They want regulars and familiar faces, friends of good food, and the unique Downtown Summerlin experience that means you can get good food at a good price surrounded by kids playing, open air, comfortable seats and tasteful art without a hushed sticky restaurant conveyor belt.

Remember they have food the menu ""secret"" items-- namely the HappyMess-- their take on carne asada fries. My go to is their NakedChix  or their AhiTuna anything.

Smoothies are also so good! They have a patio which, I think, is dog friendly.. since the mall is dog friendly???  The patio at their Warm Springs location isn't dog friendly. I really hope this one is. Come to this location instead!

Food came out quick and fresh! Plenty of seating compared to other locations. I imagine on the weekends it's more packed so expect a brief wait at the very least.

We decided to brave the loud music and the AC in frigid January and return to SkinnyFATS. They must have known we were coming - the music was at conversational levels and the temp was just right!

Miles, the guy at the register, is super helpful and patient, and very friendly, too. I was glad to see that they now have wine, but IMHO, they are priced too high for the venue. I mentioned this to Reed, a manager (owner?) who was seated at a counter near us, and he explained that they were in the exploration stage of their wines, and he appreciated my comment.

In keeping with the outside temps, the hubs had a craving for soup, and ordered the tomato soup. Miles had said it was different, and it sure was: not your usual cream of tomato, this one was rich and dark without cream, a bit spicy, with toasted bread croutons, and thoroughly delicious. 

We couldn't resist ordering the same salad we had last time, which was the shining star of that meal - the Thai Cobb, again with turkey bacon and peanut dressing on the side. As it was brought to the table, the runner noticed that the dressing was on the salad, and whisked it away before even putting it down. Reed was still nearby and overheard; he said they were just going to throw it out, so we should keep it. My husband would surely eat it, dressing and all, so we ended up with two of those fabulous salads. Now that's service!

Also to share was the Sweet Cheese Us - shaved NY strip, with pepper marmalade, caramelized onions, pepper jack, and portobello on a hoagie. We got the cheddar sauce separately and this time had the riced cauliflower as our side. My husband found that a bit too garlicky, but I loved it, though I would prefer my cauliflower cooked some more. But when my fork, which had been dipped into the cheddar sauce, hit that cauliflower, wow, what a flavor sensation! I have resigned myself to the fact that I'm never gonna find a hoagie roll in Vegas that has a hard, crunchy outside, so I don't even take that into consideration any more. It was a great sandwich despite that.

We've done a total 180 on SkinnyFATS, and understand now why the reviews are so great!!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,4,5,PqX592fa1Z4AeyS4XgGRyA

Day two I got the avocado toast, it's REALLY good, super duper good.  
My only complaint would be the time it took me to get my food on day  40 minutes....I felt like they needed to be sorrier about it, maybe offer up a free cookie or have someone come by and apologize for the time.  No biggie tho, it was more delicious than annoying.

Skinny Fats is located at the old Ribs n Burger location in Downtown Summerlin and they have a great patio area. Downtown Summerlin is also bringing in Makers and Finders, so happy to see them supporting local businesses instead of the giant chain restaurants.

I popped in to Skinny Fats on a Saturday morning right after they opened and ordered a couple breakfast dishes as well as the Caulifire (because I CANNOT come to Skinny Fats and not order the Caulifire).

If you haven't been to Skinny Fats, the idea is that half the menu is Indulgent and the other half is Healthy (though still delicious). It's a great low-key date place because you can order one entree from each side and share, and not feel too guilty. 

...My only issue (and it's kind of a big one) is that if you're a low-carb eater or eat a keto / ketogenic diet, there are very few options. Both sides of the menu are pretty carb heavy. Granted, they will customize. (We ordered the Smotherload burrito minus the potatoes and minus the tortilla as well as the Wake n Bacon minus the bun and they were happy to oblige.)

The bread was fine on the Meltdown but had so much butter on it.  The burgers themselves had no flavor at all. The breakfast potatoes had no flavor and some were way undercooked. Sweet potatoes were ok.
The cola tasted strange...may be not used to it with cane sugar.  Sorry but underwhelmed on the whole meal.",QdPY0W7WIgBZrzRuL1lZMA,1,0,2,RtTgeMSx6K7IHV-N7Fi0PQ
5709379,2018-03-02,1,j4F5LtyQ3_dKLJbIEkwFpQ,"I do love my SkinnyFATS even though I've had minor issues with them almost every time I've ordered online (although usually another location) from missing sauce, wrong sauce, missing items, food not ready, not finding my store credit, etc.

I don't live in LV, but travel here constantly. That said, to say I was SHOCKED by the whole ""downtown Summerlin"" thing is an understatement. It's what every suburb dreams of becoming. Rows of Teslas, Mercedes, Porches, nice even sidewalks, well lit, stores galore, movie theater, parallel parking to try your hand at (I'm a pro), and a parking garage to keep your huge truck or SUV out of the ""rain"". Luckily, SkinnyFATS has 2 to-go parking spots outside so you don't have to trek from the garage.

This location was way busier than the others I've used. Normally I just wait in the line to pickup, but this location had a guy ask me right when I walked in if I was picking up and guided me to not wait in the line. Go straight to the bar area if you're just picking up. He was great, food was ready. My only complaint this time is that my ""over easy egg"" was completely solid, 100% solid. As usual, I'll be back, but next time putting ""ridiculously runny egg"" instead of over easy.",EW3jDZFPhUEKPxPMhxLN8A,1,1,5,twu2YyWdMH4K4hLQUngGHA
5717252,2018-06-22,0,j4F5LtyQ3_dKLJbIEkwFpQ,"Quick. Easy. FUN. SkinnyFATS is a great lunch spot when you need a break from shopping. I tend to stay on the healthy side of the menu and everything I have had has been delicious. I had the veggie burger the first time around which had a yummy black bean patty and sweet potato fries. I got the avocado toast for breakfast which was gourmet af and loaded with flavor. 

I ordered the Naked Chix today and HOLY- it is amazing. I scarfed it down in 5 minutes. The mango chutney sauce on it is incredible. 10/10 would recommend. 

I always get their cold pressed juices. The Hangover Cure is so far my favorite. You can't go wrong with the Skinny Punch either. It's like a healthy slurpee. 

It's worth noting that the employees here are awesome. The menu can be daunting at first but they are always really knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to substitutes and helping you choose an option.",lmRCyM2Rx4xNm4wFd_ba1A,1,0,5,Ia48LpLog9VsPUwnob1xZA

5747315,2018-01-11,1,j4F5LtyQ3_dKLJbIEkwFpQ,"SkinnyFATS is a unique restaurant aimed at pleasing both the health conscious and the hearty food lover. You first walk in and grab a menu as you line up to order. You get a number and find a table to wait for your food. Going during peak hours ment having to scout for a table that looked as though they were about to finish eating and pounce one they did to make sure you actually had a place to sit before your food arrived. 

The food itself was pretty good. The new year's risollution was a bit small for a fully satisfying lunch but the taste was amazing. The burger and the melt were also very good and the fries were perfectly crispy. The protein waffle was probably the weak link of the table as it tasted like a plain simple waffle, but it did still taste decent. 

SkinnyFATS was a pretty good and everyone left satisfied. Finding a table was a little frustrating when they are busy but not a deal breaker as it seemed everyone eventually found a table before their food arrived. Definitely would recommend trying, especially if you have a diverse group of foodies who both want healthy and hearty.",O-nFhs8UBvWaCkgkOTynDw,2,0,4,Kx-QxofzvLDfMckaQgQXlQ

The Sweet Cheesus looked amazing and exactly what I wanted from the picture but the real sandwich, though good, was nowhere near the one spilling over with meat in the picture and was looking forward to.  If you closed the sandwich the bread hid its contents in entirety. Very sad. 

My wife good an egg white burrito of some sort with avocado and was very ""meh"" about it. 

It's food. It tastes okay. It's average...not 4.5 stars.",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,2,1,3,SaqFc9ZkOgKxHHytXkeIbQ

I was honestly impressed despite expecting that it would be good. The price is average with the portions. Not too little but not overly generous. Their drinks are interesting and pretty good. Someone mixed up the root beer and birch beer soda so that was fun. Everything tasted good and was fresh. Half the restaurant is at the patio and the weather was warm and perfect for dinner when we went. All in all a great outing.

It is very hard to find restaurants that can cater to your dietary needs and cater to your children's needs as well. That's why I like Skinny Fats! Because they can customize my order and they have menu items available for those who are not on a diet. On top of that the food is delicious and the price is reasonable. The menu is not that large, which in a way is good (or bad) less choices can be less head ache right? But the great thing about it is that you can order your burger with No bun and lettuce instead and they do have a lot of great tasty options and the serving size is perfect.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,1,0,5,-lxqTzHQJNsiOWoT9YxGjg
