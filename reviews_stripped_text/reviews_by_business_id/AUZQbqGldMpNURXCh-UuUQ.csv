It wasn't busy, but our food took forever to show, 15 minutes or more. My wings sat on the counter a good five minutes before they realized my order was up. She pulled a pre-made pretzel out of a bin and passed it back to have it heated up...

Wings were like jerky, driest wings I've ever had, and not spicy (they were supposed to be). Pretzel tasted like bread shaped like a pretzel. It didn't even taste like a pretzel, just bread.",0vsWvAITn_MuC_-bi0R6-w,0,0,1,FZfXnX3KrSOE8Mk3ca0QTw

486994,2014-03-04,0,AUZQbqGldMpNURXCh-UuUQ,"I loved their cheese and ham breakfast sandwich - but the bacon one broke my heart.  They add a weird flavor to their bacon so instead of the usual heavenly smoky taste you get this unrecognizable rude awakening with every bite.  Dude, it's bacon: delicious enough as it is - leave it the hell alone! 

I also loved the fruit bowl - every single piece of fruit was ripe and tasty.  Coffee also exceptionally good - then again Bellagio coffee is generally great - so it's not exclusive to this one outlet.  Prices could be lower but when you see their to-go containers you'll understand where your money is going!  It's like they're packing a takeout meal for the White House.   

Their burger was absolutely horrible: completely burned the first time and on the second attempt they forgot half the ingredients I'd requested.  The unburned version didn't taste that much better either!  Their fries are really delicious though. 

The place is too small for the traffic it seems to have, and AC is too high for my liking, but it is SUPER convenient and a great option if you want to grab a quick bite, whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Go in with low expectations and save yourself a bank breaking and belly aching trip to the buffet!

It prints a ticket that you bring to the counter to pay & get your order. Only tried a couple of slices today... Margarita & carne. Although it was a big improvement from previous pizza they still need some work. The menu described the margarita pizza as having buffalo mozzarella & San Marzano sauce. None of that was on it. Not even traditional basil that's always on a margarita pizza. Basically plain mozzarella cheese. The carne was as described but nothing special. Both slices were overcooked..very crunchy... Seemed like if done right the crust would have been light & airy.  Slices are reasonable $6/$7. Whole pizzas around $30....which if I would have got the margarita liked they served, I would have sent it back.

So I used to live in Vegas, and this spot was one of my favorites, it's good, fast, and it's at the Bellagio! We were in Vegas over this last weekend, and as I'm trying to nurse my hangover yesterday morning, I see ""SNACKS"" whoohooo! I ordered the BLT with cole slaw, freakin delicious! Perfectly toasted sourdough bread with bacon lettuce and tomato. I love their BLT, I'd go back just for this alone! 

The place is small, and it's usually busy, you order at the counter and wait for your food. It's a pretty spot, not a lot of seating. It's next to the sports book section so you can grab your food to go and watch it in the sports book section. They've got mainly sandwiches with pretty sides, they also have chicken wings, which I haven't yet tried.

2181900,2011-06-13,0,AUZQbqGldMpNURXCh-UuUQ,"We were supposed to eat at the Bellagio Buffet, but we weren't hungry enough to forfeit $30/person. Plus, we weren't compelled to stuff $30 worth of food down to our stomach, and didn't want the extra million calories of kobe beef, sushi and carb galore. Around the corner we bumped into this cute ""snack bar."" The menu is small so it was easy to pick. Anyways, we ordered the pulled bbq sandwich, club sandwich and an order of chef salad to split between us. three words - TOO MUCH food. Our bill came out to $30 (thank goodness we didn't eat at the buffet). We assumed the proportion would be small, hence 3 plates for 2 people. We were wrong, the pulled bbq sandwich is a plate of 3 huge stuffed pork sliders, the sandwich was about a foot long and the salad (looked like a side salad) had a lot of fixings and was overflowing The salad was topped with tomato dressing, which sounds weird and looks like pizza sauce, but it complimented the chef salad really well. First time trying tomato dressing and it was good. The cole slaw was good. The sandwich/burger came with a slice of pickle (yes!), and my potato chips looked like it was from the bottom of a large potato chip bag (small and crumble-y) which was okay b/c i wouldn't have been able to finish 'em. 

Anyways, check out this place, and it is Vegas so don't expect a $6.00 sandwich, minimum was $9.00 a plate. I cant complain about the price of drinks, b/c i ordered a cup of water (free). 

Their cookies looked tempting but we were way too full to even think about dessert. 

We got here before the crowd. So, it took about 5 minutes for our food to arrive, and didn't have to hunt down a table. Small eatery, so not a lot of seating.

If you're going to complain about pricing in Vegas, go down the street and hit up McDonald's or In-n-Out. :)

I would like to note that this is not really a snack bar.  Grilled veggie sandwiches and caramel hazelnut brownies are not snacks, especially when the brownie is SIX DOLLARS.

How do you mess up cornbread? I've also had the steak soft tacos. They are the typical 4"" diameter tortilla with enough filling to belong on a 6"" tortilla. So you inevitably look like a moron trying to eat them and having meat and avocado bits splattering all over.

Pricing is ridiculous. But it frankly isn't Bellagiodiculous. So if you have had three meals at Circo and Noodles and Yellowtail, then Snacks is going to seem positively cheap. You will feel like you're ordering off the dollar menu.

With the name Bellagio on the paper cup the coffee ought to be good and it was. I could tell that the coffee is truly quality when I am enjoying it without a flavoref syrup. The coffee is $4 plus change. Refills are complimentary. 

  Bellagio Snacks is one of a few cafes inside the beautiful Bellagio. It is near the area where the Esplenade merges with the casino. It shares the same area with the sports book and The Bank.

 The cafe is relatively small. There is a long table with some individual tables. It is a self serve cafe where people order and pick up their food and beverages at the counter. I would like to mention that the employees are friendly.

  Bellagio Snacks serves beverages from coffee to beer. They also serve the coffee shop food that includes soup, sandwiches,  bagels, and cookies. The food was far overpriced and did not look appealing. When I write that the food is overpriced, here are some examples. Soup is $6. Bagels that look like the Starbucks kind are $3.95 plus $1 for cream cheese. And a burger is $10.50. No wonder why a few minutes later, I was checking-in to Johnny Rockets.

  The best part of waking up in the Bellagio is Bellagio Snacks serving me coffee in my cup. Based on high prices, they most likely won't be serving food on my plate.
