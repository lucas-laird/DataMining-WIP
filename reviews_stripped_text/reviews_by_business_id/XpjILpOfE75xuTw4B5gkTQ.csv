232978,2014-08-03,0,XpjILpOfE75xuTw4B5gkTQ,Stopped here to fill a craving. The wings were fresh and crispy unlike others I have had recently. I ordered the casino deal with bourbon and teriyaki wings. You cannot beat the price for the amount of food you get. The bourbon were my favorite. I haven't had a sauce like that before and it fulfilled my craving. I'll be back before I leave town.,rgQpdFvj-7Giz_B-dfR8lg,0,1,4,ZMgmZdfNwLY49rbg90V52Q

I went on my lunch break to this place and wanted chicken strips and fries But they only have chicken strips on the kids menu for 5.99 so I asked if I could a kids combo. The guy said he couldn't sell me it because it was for kids only. But instead suggest a wing special for 6.99. I said I just wanted chicken strips not bone in wings. So, long story short he lost business and future business from me because he couldn't sell me the kids combo for a dollar less. Wonderful customer service strategy there! Ended up going else where and will never go back.",HxW-J04HpbJNcW4ta-pqTQ,2,0,1,eGb0GxAD_quv_Dx8h9S0rA

So when I got to work today and noticed that we had wings from 702 wing spot I knew it was going to be a great day. But like a crappy M. Knight Shyamalan movie the twist was that the wings were barely edible, just as ""The Village"" was barely watchable. They were as dry as a British sit-com and about as flavorless as Public Enemy withthout Flave.  They were more reminiscent of the turkey from ""Christmas Vacation"" than the delicious food of the gods they are. It made me sad not to finish them, but it made me even more sad about 30 minutes later when a Mt. Vesuvius type eruption was happening in my belly. Which is sure to end in a Pompeiian type devistation. Maybe this was a one off experience, maybe it wasn't. All I know is that it will be my only experience with 702 Wing Spot.",kvO_bnZMQSFTI-YUZOm9oQ,0,0,1,saFEHeWwZCXfOH2UgtqUkg

1781277,2014-07-19,2,XpjILpOfE75xuTw4B5gkTQ,"Super bummed to see that Wing King is gone- their vast variety of sauces were a huge part of their appeal, along with their service.If you're going to take over the same space as a successful business and offer up the same type of food, you best be sure you can provide a product that is as good as the place you are replacing. This new place is not on the same level.
 
Menu combos require wing orders to be over 10 pieces for more than one sauce- which is frustrating as the WK menu of 50 sauces is cut down to a max of 15 here in the first place.  Grand opening special (10 wings, fries, drink; $12) offers up to two sauces... but I was told they'd be limiting to 1 sauce in the future. Bad choice, management- this will lose you WK's former fans.

Of the garlic-parm and cajun wings, the former seemed to be a close match to the recipe used by Wing King but with less cheese while the latter was more of a rub (please note this on the menu). Bleu cheese dipping sauce was disgusting, couldn't tell if it was spoiled but color was off, consistency was watery, and flavor wasn't right.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,3,3,YYkHmoAR20WICBfBw1GnrA

2268779,2017-12-26,1,XpjILpOfE75xuTw4B5gkTQ,"Would not recommend this place at all for wings. First of all, what a weird location. It's located inside Campus Food Court on West Charleston Blvd and shares a space with Tacos El Jefe. I ordered the combo #2 which included 10 wings, fries, celery, and choice of ranch or blue cheese for 11 bucks and some change. I opted for lemon pepper wings since it's usually a pretty safe option...

When the wings came out, they were under seasoned and way too overcooked. Like Greg K's review said, it was similar to chicken jerky! What the heck?! I've never seen wings over cooked! Usually the issue would be with them being raw or under cooked. I was definitely not happy with the food. No wonder nobody comes to this Campus Commons place. Definitely would not come back or recommend!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,2,2,88bndHeWKrgJN2LoXOeMRw

2759617,2014-07-17,9,XpjILpOfE75xuTw4B5gkTQ,"Was feenin some Jamaican Slam Wings and Sweet Chili Glazed Fries so off I went to the one place that satisfies my craving. Wing King. *Record scratch. Huh? This aint Wing King!

Apparently, its a whole new owner and he named it 702 Wing Spot. Now being the open minded Yelper that I am I was more than willing to give these guys a spin.

What I got was the Rat Pack ($9.99). You get one sauce for 10 pieces of wings, fries, and a drink. I wanted to play it safe so I got just honey barbeque.

When they brought out my order, it was only 9 wings and they noticed it as soon as they put it down in front of me. They said to just go ahead and start eating and they will bring out the other piece. At first I was thinking that this was a bad first impression. But about 5 minutes later they brought out 3 pieces because they felt bad about their mistake. I was impressed. 

As for the wings, not bad. Not bad at all. I think I will go for more bolder sauces next time like Mango Habanero. The fries were sprinkled with some type of cajun spices which made it pretty good. Not as good as sweet chili glazed fries but good nonetheless. Lastly, you get a 12 ounce can of soda. Not a bad deal for 10 bucks.

As a bonus, when you check in you get a free dessert! At that time, not all the desserts were available because he just opened so I ended up going with the cheesecake on a stick which normally sells for $3.99. If you refer to my pic, it is a nice sized goodie for you guys with a sweet tooth! It had a rich taste to it just like how a good cheesecake should be.

Originally I was gonna give them 4 stars but the service more than made up for that supposedly bad first impression. I like these guys. A bit different than Wing King but I am more than happy to recommend these them. For those that are not familiar with this place, they are located in a strip mall kind of setting with other food joints of different ethnicity. Dont let the appearance fool you for the good food and service will have you coming back!

2916490,2014-11-13,1,XpjILpOfE75xuTw4B5gkTQ,"First and last ordering here. I ordered a wing meal that should have come with a soda and fries, I paid an extra dollar for it and they didn't put it in there. I asked for wings only no drums and they had to call me because they did t know what I meant... so I said the flat ones... He still didn't understand what I meant... you work at a wing place... you should know what the hell I mean. I've never had an issue anywhere else with this request.  Now I also request ranch for everything I ordered and got all blue cheese. The fries looked brown as if they were cut and weren't soaked in water so they wouldn't turn brown and nasty. They had no flavor. Now my wings I ended up getting boneless because they couldn't understand what I wanted. I ate one of each flavor and threw it out. I could have bought frozen boneless wings and had them taste and look the same. I have no clue how this place has such great reviews.  Oh and they delivered it 20 minutes late. Never ever again.",eUiisYNqV2nV7h770bpg2A,0,0,1,YG7u6Xx8V2Nu0KWw6a3Dpw

3587997,2014-07-06,0,XpjILpOfE75xuTw4B5gkTQ,"I was craving some wings and since I was in the area decided to give what I thought was Wing King another chance.  Brian was not there so that did seem odd but I was going to place my order anyway.  I mean even owners take the day off occasionally.  Then the gentleman taking my order mentioned they had only been opened for a couple of weeks and I thought, wait, where am I?!?  Lol.  Turns out Brian is gone.  Looking at his facebook it appears that he will be opening in another location.  Price wise it's about the same as other wing locations in town.  I got the lemon pepper and honey bbq.  Usually lemon pepper is my favorite and my go to but in this case I really liked the honey bbq and would order it again.  

They offer 15 flavors of wings but the new owner said there would be more.  So that is a major difference between Wing King and this new spot.  The Wing King menu had 60 flavors and offered dessert.  They don't currently offer dessert so the yelp check in won't be honored.  I have to take away one star because they could be more generous with the ranch and the blue cheese.  I ordered the 30 piece and it came with two containers and that was enough for a 15 piece but not 30.",YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,1,2,4,Jps85yVbdL1tElxaZi9qJg

We tried:
Medium buffalo-plenty of sauce, average flavor
Mango habanero-delicious!!! Lots of sauce
Garlic Teriyaki- lots of sauce, average flavor
Honey BBQ-lots of sauce, average flavor
Caribbean jerk-it's a dry rub, we expected sauce so a little disappointed.

The flavors we had may have been overall average but the friendly service and size of the wings makes this place to return to (when we are on this side of town).",UbLZsES_aV_-z7mon6tNaw,0,1,4,Wf1pZPe_zGtaPZytvDmADw

4934644,2017-09-13,2,XpjILpOfE75xuTw4B5gkTQ,"Really?  Come on.  For a place that is supposed to have great wings, ummm, let's have a reality check here.

1. We ordered 40 wings and had two dressings, the Teriyaki and the lemon Pepper, which is a dry rub.

2. It took about 25 minutes for the food to come out.  You get a huge tray of cut celery and plenty of sauce, blue cheese or ranch, whatever you prefer.

3.  The ambiance is inside a small, old, retro food court that has other smaller family owned type of cuisine.  On a Sunday, many were closed at about 1:00 pm. It is near the Charleston CSN facility, so perhaps it caters to students.

Why a two star???  The ambiance of the place is not the greatest. In fact, a bit dirty.  With hardly any other customers at this time, 25 minutes for 40 wings is a long time.  Also, I was excited to try these wings and all of them were pretty much way over cooked, shrunk in size vs. plumb and tender.  I mean this is the perfect meal if you wanted to order chicken jerky.

This place will have to do a much better job timing the temperature of their wings and making sure that they are moist, plump and tender.  Not sure how this could have high reviews when they need to be totally consistent.

Try it out, but start small like 3 or 6 wings, not 40 like I did.  It was a waste when the celery tastes better than the wings.

GK says, try it but sample first.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,1,2,mYSBa0-EOWn5HikW1eEn7w

The wing stop is part of a joint window serving both wings and also Mexican food. It just seemed like a strange combination to me.

For this first visit, I came for 702 Wing Stop. I was hungry after class, CSN Charleston. I ordered the Hoover dam which consisted of 6 wings: one flavor, one dip and canned soda. But don't get this deal fooled by their ""daily special"" which is the same thing but $1.00 difference. As for the garlic chicken, it was cooked well but the garlic flavoring could be a little stronger as well as fresher. The fries that came with it could've been a little more warmer but I didn't mind because it had fair amount of seasoning. I checked in for their free desert & I think the desert takes the cake, although that's not the kind of desert I had, their crispy fried ice cream makes up for everything else! delicious! 

Overall my experience was greatly satisfied and I hope yours as well! definitely coming back to try more, next time.",uwU9D3F6l5DJN_ygnlvEkQ,0,0,4,pOnTMdH20Wa0CCpO_j7D9w
