I am sure there are some amazing options on the strip, but I don't want to drive to the strip or pay the strip premium. We have been on the hunt for a good sit down Mexican restaurant since we moved here in May. We have found the one we will be eating at, even though it's on the opposite side of town! 

The carne asada tacos are amazing and their tequila menu impressive. :)",Roo5xp66Ky7Su7I8cy03ng,0,0,5,NO6taxMHCh0MrGQFdD8EBw

We were sat towards the left of the restaurant and the large window let the bright parking lights in destroying that ambiance and it made reading the menu difficult. Drink menu looked great! Food menu was typical ""Mexican"" food. Sadly, the best thing on the table that was ordered from four orders was the taco salad.... yes the taco salad. The second best thing on the table were the chips, not the salsa. The carne asada plate was not marinated or seasoned as a typical piece would be. The enchiladas picantes is made with habaneros, but McDonalds picante sauce is hotter than this. It had an awkward taste and it was just bad. I got one grilled and one shredded and the shredded enchilada had cartilage/connective tissue. The taco salads looked and tasted really good. The salsa tasted like canned Herdez I'm not even kidding, it was chunky tomato sauce. The rice tasted like boxed rice and the black beans.... no. If you're going Mexican you serve pinto. Overall the service was good and our waiter was very courteous. He made the experience worth the trip. I would not make a trip back here unless it is to the bar. Honestly I knew going in not to have high hopes because it's Mexican food in Summerlin where people think pepper is spicy.",Ec5XWH8cj8z_mNTlmuDRYg,0,0,2,Ahd46JBkwXr_JkuQBBVZ-Q

344159,2017-07-29,0,iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA,"Surprisingly mediocre food. Less than stellar service. Took about 15 minutes before we saw our server. I ordered the street taco sampler and all of the meat tasted similar and a little strange. Very salty - even the al pastor. I don't think I could have told the difference between the carnitas and the al pastor without looking at them. The calamari appetizer was good - especially the fried peppers. Squid activists will be happy to know that only one squid was killed in the making of our appetizer. Kind of tiny compared to most restaurants. For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Decadence cake, which conjured up visions of a giant wedge of Claim Jumper cake. But alas, what showed up was about half a brownie with whip cream and a scoop of ice cream. We also ordered the lime cheesecake, which turned out to be a disc about the diameter of a baseball. I should note that we went in with a $50 gift card and when we found out we couldn't use it for the tip, we kept adding desserts to use up the balance since we knew we wouldn't be coming back. Entrees were $12-17 and appetizers were $7-10. I figure to survive, a restaurant needs either great food, stellar ambiance and service, or big portions. And probably 2 of those to be safe. This place doesn't really nail any of those. Hasta la vista!",8jv9RLYqM_RAoW-IqGZUrQ,0,0,2,8QDno1PdPP1606jJeAW6sw

379331,2016-08-19,2,iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA,"Been here twice.  Sat at the bar both times
1st visit - after 8pm on a Tuesday.  Trash behind the bar overflowing.  Bar tender serving up all the wrong drinks, servers fixing the orders, bartenders don't care if the drinks are right or wrong.  Speak to the manager about the trash and observations.  Manager tells about the restaurant and the 1/2 of $12+ Tequila on Tuesdays.  Manager drags away the trash by herself.  Not a good visit.
2nd visit - after 9pm on the following Tuesday.  Ordered chips & salsa, street tacos, and a Cadillac Margarita and a glass of water.  Got the water in 5 minutes.  Got the drink and it was missing the Gran Marnier floater.  I asked about the floater and the bartender said that they are out of Gran Marnier.  I asked him if he should have advised me of this prior to serving the drink without it and he said yes probably and walked away leaving the drink.  The chips and salsa came and they are quite good, but i was disappointed that they only have one kind of salsa.  When the street tacos came the corn tortillas were dried out on the edges, like they were heated in a microwave and the flavors were bizarre, and not in a good way -- with a finish like talcum powder - barely edible.  I also ordered a flight of tequila since they are supposed to be 1/2 off on Tuesdays, but no body bothered to inform the bartender.  
The restaurant is so beautiful!  It's sad that they get that right but don't get the most important parts right.  They need to hire a bar back, maybe two.  They need to fix the menu or hire a good chef or somehow fix the food.  They need to offer many more salsas.  They need to fire all of the bartenders and hire people who listen and respond and are interested in good customer service and not just how much money they can pocket!",s-tYluswb2xphRwdctOTvA,4,0,1,gsEJv-ubrMcRXCKybt7fFA

The group in front of us stated that we had to stop a food server and let them know that we are waiting???  We stopped Fernando and he was gracious and also apologetic.  He assisted in getting us seated.  After being seated, our waitress walked by us several times before taking our order and/or acknowledging our presence.  Approximately 15-20 mins later, Fernando returns with 4 plates of food that we did not order.  Let me say this, the place is beautiful and it was not crowded, so I'm flabbergasted as to why the service was less than ideal and why Fernando had to break his back to accommodate us.  His service was nothing less than amazing, but I felt like he was trying to compensate for the other servers' shortfalls and they weren't busy enough to warrant that.  To the food - The chips tasted old, but the salsa was spicy and tasty.  I ordered Street tacos, which were blah, the wife had a cheese quesadilla which was great, and our boys' nachos were good.  For this to be a brand new establishment, it's shocking to see it being ran this poorly.  I think they have potential, but they may need to overcome their staffing issues first and foremost.  Again, Fernando was great.  The waitress returned and stated that she discounted our check because of the food order error.  The end.",zCv9tRCitgPozPr0boNQ7w,0,0,3,OkX-qopanlKRnB2TPU9VgQ

What we got was beyond that! We had a blast! The decor of the restaurant is gorgeous, the lanterns that line the ceilings, the open floor space, the unique displays on the wall, the Dia De Los Muertos wall paper behind the bar...it all was great. There weren't many people when we went, but that gave us a chance to get to know the staff. 

Joel was our bartender and he was AWESOME! We had a great time getting to know him, and let's face it we stayed longer than planned because the drinks were fantastic.

Roxy was our server and she was bubbly, fun and we enjoyed getting to know her too!

The food was alright, we had the taco platter (Chorizo was my favorite), the chilli lime shrimp and steak, and the jalepeno poppers (Extremely hot, and so tasty). We will try other dishes the next time we go. 

Overall we will definitely go back, for the venue, the staff, the drinks, and the vibe of the place.

We waited for 15 minutes after being seated for any acknowledgment let alone, water or the offering of a cocktail. Things improved from there (our waitress was apologetic and upbeat) our food and drinks were good. 

However after many cocktails and appetizers, our bill was paid but we continued to sit and chat. No one came came back to ask if we wanted another drink or if we were OK. After about 30 minutes, we had to get up and ask the bartender to send someone over. Two different wait staff did come over but asked if we had a question about our bill (that had been settled for at least 45 minutes at this point), which we did not. I had to correct them and 3 waiters later, we FINALLY got beer. What a circus!

969094,2017-04-24,1,iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA,"So I have to say that since my last review of The Matador, immediately thereafter I received a genuine response from the manager with willingness to correct my experience as well as a follow up with his staff with different expectations.  He did invite us back but we never made it in to meet him.  While the restaurant was still on my mind, a few months later I reached out to the manager Ken to see if he would be interested in hosting my work group event.  Because of his genuine response to my previous review,  I had thought  that this would be a good opportunity to reconnect and I believed he would make this a good experience for us.  So I set up my event with him for 60-65 people that actually took place here in the last week.

Our event was properly staffed, the food was refreshed immediately as the trays got low, and none of my guests waited long for their drinks.  Dalia and the servers were personable and super efficient.  They all worked well together.  We were lucky to have the whole patio to ourselves as well as an overflow inside which we didn't end up needing.  For 5pm the weather was amazing and the sun was just over the building leaving the patio with the perfect shading.  The setting and ambiance was perfect for our group.

Chef Andrew provided the food in a buffet style presentation.  The food was bursting with huge bold flavors and every item was spot on.  It was so nice to have the Chef close by making sure there were no issues.  You could tell he took pride in his job and his food....a class act.  The food we ordered for our buffet   (happy hour - munchies) was as follows:  Braised Beef & Shredded Chicken tacos to assemble yourself (I'm still dreaming of them-YUM), ancho-chile wings (my favorite), stuffed mushrooms, grilled stuffed jalepeno poppers wrapped in bacon (hello) and nachos.  All were served with an assortment of condiments on the side - sour cream, salsas, guacamole etc.  For drinks they provided me with drink tickets to give to our guests and accommodated our need to keep $8 max per ticket.  At the end of the night they gave me the drink tickets with the actual cost listed on each ticket so I knew how I was charged for the drinks in the end, unexpected but appreciated.

From beginning to end we had not even one issue.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for group settings as well as visiting for dinner or their happy hour (one of my favorites HH).  Like I said before, you will not be disappointed in their food and their service.  Their manager Ken was THE best.  I truly felt everything was handled and he made the experience less stressful on me.  He was there every minute to make sure everything went smoothly, not to mention the several emails back and forth previous to the event.  I'm so thankful for Ken and his team and their exceptional service and outstanding food.  It made for a special night and my guests were happy-which was the overall goal.

Our group of six decided to venture down to partake in the $25 Bottomless tacos and margaritas but only four of us decided to do it. The other two decided to order off the regular menu. It really didn't matter because all of our orders came out at the most random times.

It didn't seem to be too busy but the service seemed like it was a full house and if there was only one server. What I am trying to say is that the service was agonizingly slow and at some points non existent. We seemed to get everything at different times, seriously different times. Some got items in 15 min and others in 45 minutes. My friend kept patiently waiting for a Sangria that came after I was done with my second Margarita!

One of my friends waited 30 min for tacos, asking one of each. The server appeared and said there was no more Al Pastor,  my friends pretty much told the server give him anything. 
Another friend ordered the guacamole that never came and was charged for it.

As for the food, well it was mediocre at best. I have been eating similar style tacos since the 80s being a SoCal native. So yes, I am a taco snob. I had each taco and had to ask for jalepenos because they were bland. The only one with flavor was the Chorizo taco.

We automatically walked over to the bar area to enjoy the HH specials.  With good prices and variety, we split nachos, calamari, quesadilla and stuffed jalape√±os.  I can feel you judging me but it's ok in Yelp world.  

The Nachos are huge for happy hour.  For $5 you get a large portion topped with cheese, black beans, pico, guac and sour. Cream. Pretty fantastic.  The mushroom quesadilla was so delicious.  It was well filled with ingredients and also served with guac and sour cream.  The calamari was your standard fare.  Just ok so I probably wouldn't recommend that item.  

Looking for some hot stuff? The grilled stuffed jalape√±os had a great spicy kick which made them my fav.  Cheese stuffed jalape√±os wrapped in bacon with a dipping sauce on the side.  Well anything wrapped in bacon is usually a winner.  This was no exception.   I loved every bite.

Our group came in to enjoy the bottomless taco/margarita special. Instead, we were met with a long list of disappointments. The apologies began before we had even sat down, as we waited some ten minutes for the pretty common request to sit outside, an outside that was virtually empty. Then, like another reviewer from this same day wrote, we were told they were swamped, so sorry for the delays and confusion. Except they weren't swamped. The place was not even half full. And this is a large joint in DTS, so why would you understaff yourself on a night you chose to do a promotional special?  Nonsensical. 

To that list of disappointments and to keep this brief (honestly):

-- our waiter took our orders, then proceeded to take them again, turning to me and asking, ""for you, sir?""  My man, you *just* took my order. He did this with two people at our 6person table. We aren't all white or brown; we don't all look the same. Did not instill confidence.
-- some got drinks quick; others waited literally 30+minutes so we stopped counting. Having only one bartender in a city full of bartenders and in a restaurant and bar of this size, being understaffed is not a reasonable explanation for shortcomings.
-- a side order of chips&guacamole was never delivered. We were billed for it, though. Thankfully, there was no argument against removing the charge. No apology, though, either. 
-- we asked early on for a dessert menu and were told one would be brought out. Never happened. In the end, we weren't asked if we were interested in dessert, either. Oh well. We probably weren't, so at least there's that. 
-- again towards the end, we must have waited some 20 minutes for the bill. The table next to ours also waited, and like me, decided to get up and go inside to get payment rolling. 
-- two tablemates waited some 20+minutes for their meals after ours had arrived. Unacceptable. 
-- I had the Mahi Mahi taco plate. The rice was the best part. Perfect, really. The taco, though, the interior was that of fish sticks albeit rolled in seasoning, not appealing, and the exterior taco was of such poor quality that it disintegrated before I took a second bite. It could not support the filling, which wasn't even particularly wet. Soggy taco fail. 
-- black beans were over-seasoned, spicy, too hot, for what they traditionally are supposed to be on the plate. 

Let's be real for a minute. Tacos. Burritos. These things aren't difficult. They're of the things made in university to save money and stave off hunger before I had a clue what I was doing in the kitchen. 

Unfortunately, our waiter bore the brunt of our dissatisfaction with being almost altogether absent throughout the evening and long delays before, during, and after our meal. 
I say unfortunately, because clearly what Casa is suffering from is a management&training issue, so it's not altogether his fault. Close shop for one night and get the ship in order. Our waiter just didn't seem to know what to do, and communication between him, us, and between he and the kitchen just seemed nonexistent. 

I love Mexican food, but for a sit-down restaurant in DTS, they've got a lot of work to do to improve.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,9,5,2,P0Kx8eIDcvT76z-8dZur3A

We were supplied with Chips, salsa and a spicy queso. The Chips were just the right amount of greasy/crunchy and the salsa was earthly garlicky and fire roasted, providing a nice contract to the piquant, and entrancing queso. I could have ate a bucket of it.

We sampled a mixture of margaritas, the house draft IPA, and tequila. For food, we ordered the run of street tacos, a black bean queso (yes, more queso!), and a chicken quesadilla. We also ordered a plate of calamari.

The IPA was very tasty and provided a nice compliment to the spicy food. The street tacos were very tasty and distinct with a salty cheesy notes. I enjoyed the chicken taco best, but they were all great. The calamari was a bit cold, fishy, and greasy, like it had been sitting there for awhile.

The tequila sampler was ok, but nothing special. For additional tequila, we tried a sampling. I ordered the Siete Leguas and another member of my party ordered something more expensive from the Anjeo selection. 

The waitress reversed the drinks, giving me the more expensive one (which was by all accounts fabulous). We sampled them all, and someone in my party loved my drink so much he ordered the same, which was how we found that the drinks had been switched.

We asked the waitress about this, and she insisted that we got the correct drinks; we slow walked her through it, despite her being argumentative. Eventually, with the bartender's assistance, we figured it out, and she brought another drink out to my friend.

However, she then went on to charge us for the more expensive drink despite it being her mistake. No apologies.

Overall, the food was good, but you expect the staff at a Mexican restaurant to know their tequila and not charge customers for their errors.

I told him I was reading my own to see which taco I liked, and he made some comment about how he never Yelped...okay, well good for you, I thought to myself. 

I ordered a cocktail off the seasonal menu and it was delicious, but there was simple syrup or something all over the glass and got the table sticky. The brussels sprouts were also off the seasonal menu, and were delicious--I wish I would have just stuck with those two things. Odd behavior continued from the server, I don't know if he was trying to be funny or just really going overboard because he saw me using Yelp (I'm not the type to flaunt it or use it as leverage), but when I asked him for napkins he brought us like 20, literally a huge stack. He kept saying things like ""what else do you need to make your dining experience more enjoyable?? In really exaggerated enthusiasm. It was just strange--like I said, not sure if he thought he was funny or if that's just his personality.

My al pastor tacos were exceptionally greasy, but (luckily?) there wasn't a lot of filling. Rice and beans were bland and boring as they have been on prior visits so I wasn't surprised.

Chips and salsa: light crisp chips and salsa was well seasoned.

Spicy shrimp appetizer: flavor was good, pick up a lot of habanero. Corn bread muffin was cold in the middle.

Ceviche app: sad, lacked lime juice and salt. Shrimp was poached instead of being cooked from the acidity of the lime juice.

Street tacos: menu price is 12.50 actual price on receipt 14.50. Tortillas are store bought and not steamed or anything to help them out. Almost straight of the package and onto the plate. It's suppose to be an assortment of 5 different kinds of street tacos. Everything... tasted... the same. The only reason I could tell the chicken from the others is because the color of the meat, otherwise everything tasted way too similar. Also not enough meat, or cilantro and onion on each taco.

Regular taco plate: two 6inch tacos with red rice and black beans. My wife got carne asada and al pastor. Again the marinades taste way to similar, she couldn't really tell the difference in flavor. The only reason she could tell the al pastor was al pastor is because it had red grease dripping from the tacos.

Kids quesadilla: these were fine, my kids had no complaints. They could probably save money and not put guacamole on the kids plates though, use that food cost to put more meat in the street tacos!

Horchata: it was alright, tasted a little too watered down for my liking.

Cucumber jalapeno margarita: pleasant enough, strong on cucumber flavor and had slices of jalapenos (not muddled) floating in it. 

Overall service was good (for my liking), decor was good, tequila list was extensive and drink was alright, but food really brings this restaurant down.",p08DIheTHs1DyO7Ijuncxw,0,0,2,BW9wKLwt64TyGM0DJGCoaw

The recipes are decent and the spices are interesting,  but the execution seems to fall short.  Nachos grande are boring, frozen margaritas are bland. Real margaritas are pretty good, but expensive. 

Ambiance - flies on my salsa and guacamole. Someone brought their screeching kids and left them unattended for over an hour.  Management did nothing about it while there were 3 children under the age of 5 running, screaming, making that high pitch shriek that only a toddler can produce, pushing stroller from one end of the restaurant to the other.  Customers and servers had to dodge the young children as they ran wild climbing booths and tried to get into the kitchen.  I left more tensed than when I walked in from work, needing a drink.

We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, and they were very good, and the flavor and spice of the salsa they give you with the chips to start was also good. But those two points are the only reason they got 2 stars.

For dinner, I myself ordered the Enchiladas Poblanos and they were disgusting. I ordered them before and they were pretty good, but I feel like something was different. Like they replaced normal cheese inside of it with a gross cheese like sauce. As for the rest of my party, they got the Chicken Quesadillas which looked good, but it's pretty hard to mess up a quesadilla. They also got the Grilled Chicken Tacos, which was nothing more than baby pieces of chicken under a mountain of iceberg lettuce.

1. Hostess are a mess: I was told by one hostess they do not take names for a list to calm the madness of the holiday. Then a second hostess takes my name down when the first hostess walks away to seat a party. It took entirely way to long to seat since we needed stroller accommodations.  I had to check multiple times if our table was ready since everyone after us were already sat.

2. Once finally sat we, under our table was filled with ants taking bits of food that have been piling up under the tables. We could not bare eating an entire meal with the thought of ants crawling on ourselves or most importantly the baby we had that shouldn't be in those conditions. There was plenty of tables available that enough was enough, we had to ask to move since no one had greeted us since the discovery. 

3. Once our waiter was notified we had moved, he showed no consideration for the terms. He thought it was comical. 


4. They did not bring until we asked if they served complementary chips and salsa that every table around us was enjoying. 

5. We had to continue to ask for basic restaurant needs, as in silverware, or water the entire meal. 

6. Once we finally ate the meal a GIANT cockroach climbs up the wall directly in-front of us as a nice cherry on top of this miserable dining experience. When we notified the waiter in shock he again tries to be a comedic and say ""No that's a cricket"" and also ""you guys must be lucky, first ants now a roach"" . He then brings our check with no accommodations or apology. Not one person apologized for the infestation of bugs. 

7. When we spoke directly to the manager on duty and all she said was ""are you good"" like you've got to be kidding me?!? Your lack of managerial skills just reflects the terrible restaurant you run! Talk about the worst Cinco De Mayo celebration ever!!

Man I really should add that to my titles I've been awarded in life. ""Happy Hour Guru"" hehe this place get's kudos and plenty of hand claps because they have some fantastic food!

After a movie me and ""the bae"" decided on grabbing some food! Usually people do a dinner then movie but who cares about tradition? Left the movies hungry I whipped out my phone and went to my handy dandy yelp app to discover I bookmarked this spot! Couldn't remember why until I saw that they have happy hour everyday! By the time we got there it literally just started (10pm-1am) SCORE!

On a Friday night I expected them to be slammed and to my surprise there was like nobody here! Awesome! When we walked in there was nobody at the hostess both and finally somebody came out! Told us we could sit where we wanted which I thought was pretty cool because most places during happy hour restrict the seating area in the bar only to honor the HH prices. Booth it is! Our server was super friendly and helped us with deciding on what we wanted. Margaritas of course! I usually only like my margaritas on the rocks but in this case they come frozen on HH! No biggie! One mango and one lime coming on up! They are STRONG people! Loved every last sip! Can't beat that for $5! On top of the margaritas, we ordered the HUGE nachos ($5) , chicken quesadilla($5) and one of each on the tacos ($1.50 each)! FEAST! Food was delicious and I can't find not one thing that I didn't like! Great service, Excellent food, and STRONG drinks? Yeah that equals a happy returning customer!

I think the designer did more than an excellent job here. There is very good use of visual space and there is loads of depth and interest. Kudos.

Now for the juicy parts: the Tequila and Mezcal selection is quite good. I don't like them sitting the bottles up as a visual wall of color and absorbing the light like they do, but it is pleasant to look at. An expert that was with me, told me that their wine selection is solid and that it is a well concieved idea to group the spirits according to their tasting profiles. I'm also liking the fact that the food has a more smokey quality and there is less dependency on heat. This allows the flavors to shine through. Not many places get this right.

I generally don't like ""Mexican"" restaurants due to non-authenticity, but this palce does a lot of things right. And it gives a high level of sophistication in its delivery. I'm definitely going back. And bringing friends.",1e-YlTcTpYKkCu6d_7kSJQ,4,3,5,wSy3WoYioL0tKeIE7qW0XQ

Water along with chips and salsa were received promptly. The overall service was at a leisure pace. Our wine and margarita were delivered at the same time as our lunch items. The incorrect white wine was received and our server apologized and agreed to correct the problem. The Cadillac margarita was just OK. I would have preferred less lime.
The salsa was thick, very tasty with a nice amount of heat. The chips were crisp and not greasy.
 
I chose the lunch mix and match special which offers a choice of 2 or 3 items from a list of 4 types of tacos, green chili soup or a garden salad. I selected the carnita taco, pork al pastor taco and green chili soup. The soup was very good, nice balance of flavors, tender pieces of pork and spicy just right for my taste. Both tacos were lean, tender pork but small in size.. By the time I ate my second taco the bottom fell out due to the juice soaking through the corn tortilla.

The decor of the dining room is very interesting with many pieces of wall art and unique lighting.  All chairs are hard surface. Sure would like to have some cushions for the seats.

It's tucked into the summerlin shooing center right next to California pizza kitchen and the Wolfgang puck bar. The decor is very inviting and casual and has a Southwest Mexican theme on the inside and is very clean. Our server Nicole was fantastic , however, I did notice a lot of staff in the building but she was the only one running around which I didn't understand. She was very honest and gave us some good recommendations as well as telling us what to stay away from which I appreciated greatly.

So based on Nicole recommendations we ordered the street tacos, the nacho plate all from the happy hour menu a frozen mango margarita then a chicken burrito from the regular menu. So the tacos were what you would expect from a street taco with the exception was the chicken was very tender and well seasoned and above average, the shredded beef and chorizo taco were average and the price was 3/$5. The nacho was $5 and enough of a meal for 2 people to be full and was huge and a great value. The frozen margarita was $6 and was really strong and they spare no liquor inside of it. The chicken burrito was gigantic and the chicken was fantastic as stated above, the one call out is that the sour cream is mixed with some kind lime and cilantro so it's a little tangy , you can have it with regular sour cream but it's just a buyer be ware type of thing 

All in all it's definitely a solid place to eat with a great value and worth going again if nothing else for the happy hour and the multiple selections they have and my whole bill was $30 which is a cheap eat for all that food and a drink",PB1PY4NhNu1bNwQCEUcFQQ,1,0,4,_YnIiYUnikb-BBppTxXNaA

It tasted like  a traditional ""well/ house margarita"" with no noticeable notes of orange to be found. The bacon wrapped jalape√±os were delicious & very well done! The free chips and salsa were missing something, we poured a good teaspoon of salt in the salsa & some on the chips & then the flavor popped, so it could've been under salted.  The Carne Asada tacos were below average. Meat was sparse & lukewarm, tortilla was inundated with pico de gallo to maybe compensate for the low level of flavor? Black beans were delicious & rice was very nice! Service was average-at best... I hate to criticize any server by name because I've been both a bartender & a server & you never know if they're under staffed for the night or new/ training etc... nothing bad, but nothing overwhelmingly positive either.  In a part of town- off the strip- where you have to compete with Juan's Flaming Fajitas, Leticia's & Pancho's I'd say this place probably comes in 4th place to all of them.

The only problem with that is being a solo diner, I took up one spot at a table for 4 people.  I looked around while I was there and there was always an open table so I felt less badly about taking up a whole table which are fixed to the patio floor.

My server was Nicole and she brought me chips and salsa and my iced tea very quickly.  She answered some questions I had about the size of the starters which was very helpful.  The chips and salsa were pretty standard.  The salsa was not very spicy.  I started with the fried calamari which has a poblano chili, ancho seasoning for the breading and is served with a garlic-cilantro aioli.  This wasn't as large as some restaurants serve but it was still large enough that two people could have shared the dish.  

When Nicole picked up my empty calamari dish, she said she'd put through the carne asada order.  That was super!  When I ordered, she asked me how I wanted the meat cooked.  I answered rare and by waiting until my starter was finished to continue the order, the steak came out rare.  That's a good server or good restaurant policy but I think in this case it was Nicole.

The steak was medium sized and you have a choice of refried or black beans.  I chose black beans.  The dish comes with rice, beans, grilled Mexican corn, and a piece of red pepper and a grilled jalape√±o pepper.  I ate 2/3 of the jalape√±o at which time I started with hiccups.  That's d corn were good--the rice generally why I don't eat jalape√±os outside the  house.  The steak and beans were good with the rice being standard with no discernible seasoning.

I passed on dessert (yes, I really did!).  It was a pleasant evening for eating on the patio despite some guilt.  Service was excellent and I will be back.  The interior was quite noisy as it was just at the end of happy hour and the loud drinkers/eaters were nearing the end of their deals.  It was quieter as I left.

Service: I've never had a bad service experience.  It was either average or very good.  I do appreciate the servers who gives us a heads up of when happy hour is ending and swings by right before it ends for one final order.  I make sure I take extra care of those servers when the bills comes..I really appreciate that...=) 

Food & Drinky Drinks-  My Happy Hour favorites are... 
Habanero Chile Wings - Not very spicy, but very tasty and the wings have lots of meat
Grilled Stuffed Jalapenos - Just like my dating life, I knows it's not going to end up well down the road, but it's so worth it for the temporary bliss...
Tortilla Chicken Soup - Tasty and loaded with chicken.
Green Chili -  this is hit or miss, batting about 50%.  But when it's good, I love it!
Mango Frozen Margarita - Blended with real mangos which makes this flavorful and fun

Value: Tacos are $4 and the remaining entrees are either $5 or $6.  Margaritas are priced $5 to $6.50.  Amazing value for the quality, portions and tastiness received.  

Ambiance: Contemporary mexican restaurant decor.  We like sitting in the patio when the weather is nice.  When dusk comes, it's dimly lit insides which creates a nice intimate ambiance.  I swear, the best gossip comes out when it's darker and fueled by $6 margaritas.

Summerlin is a far drive (Vegas standards) from Green Valley so I'm only at the Matador's House happy hour when I visit my bffs on that side of town.  I'm kind of glad, as I could see this becoming a routine late night happy hour stop on school nights.  Until next time Matador..=)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,4,4,4,uxFSbPFuvxp1fkifjZX4Ew

We went on a Saturday night (prime time) with friends and were seated in a beautiful wooden booth that was the most uncomfortable piece of furniture I have ever sat in for a long period of time and sat we did...the wood was without a cushion for your backside and seemed to be so short that it didn't support your legs, so I feel like I was in a ""squat"" halfway supporting myself all night with taught thigh muscles.  This is what I remember most about my dining experience.

The time it took for the food to arrive was quite a bit of a wait.  I think it's because the time and day we had went, although the servers were very nice.  This wasn't a huge deal to us as we weren't in a hurry because we were with good friends and enjoying the company.

Once the food arrived, life was good (except for the uncomfy seat).  Fortunately, I got to try a ton of stuff from everyone's plate and I enjoyed all of it.  My main entree was ""Street Tacos"" and I liked it.  It was 5 different kinds of tacos and the flavors and variety are good.  I would definitely get that again.  We also had the stuffed jalapenos (good but watch out for the one with seeds), we had a arugula and grilled watermelon salad with serranos (basically arugula with a couple of these other items) - super spicy.  We also had the mexican street corn which was on a seasonal menu for them (meh..), it wasn't my favorite due to how much I like mexican corn in other places which prepare it differently but it wasn't ""bad"".

Overall, I liked the food but I don't think I will be back to eat inside due to the extremely uncomfy seats - like seriously.  Now, I'm a big and tall person, so your seating mileage may vary!",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,0,0,3,NI_Kn_6Fny39btITz7teZQ

We started off with the Tex-mex Spring Rolls. They were under seasoned and looked like little fried chimichangas. They were filled with chicken, corn, black beans. They came with 2 dipping sauces. 

For dinner we ordered the Polenta Pork Verde and Street Tacos. The meats in the tacos were pork, pork belly, chicken, chorizo and carne asada. They only came with the tacos and no sides of beans or rice. All but one was very greasy and fell apart once picked up because they only had one mini corn tortilla holding each taco. The meat on the pork had a very sweet sauce on it. The chorizo was sweet too. I took a bite of each one and only finished the asada one. Too greasy for my taste. The polenta was fried and topped with the pork verde. It also came with no sides. We ordered a side of flour tortillas for an extra cost. It was seasoned properly. Not the best pork I've had. It was okay. 

They served up complimentary chips and salsa. Salsa wasn't too spicy and had a good flavor. Chips looked homemade. 

The cucumber margarita was perfect and served with English cucumber garnish. The blood orange margarita was strong and served with a garnish of a regular orange. Both were the highlight of the meal.

SO, my ""parents"" (ex bfs parents) came down from San Jo!! Well, they asked where I wanted to go, and I said, here! I was seriously so excited! My broke ass always has them take me to places that are priced higher than $2 for items... LOL.

This place is in Downtown Summerlin, next to Ethan Allen. Parking is a bish in the evenings. We walked in and were seated quickly. The hostess was nice, told us where the specials were, and left us. We looked over the menu and it was a hard choice for me: the machaca burrito special, or the carne asada enchiladas... I went with the enchis. I opted for carne asada, and the picante. They asked if I wanted them wrapped in flour or corn, and I was like... da fuq? I've never eaten an enchilada wrapped in flour... I would think that would be like a small burrito wet, no? Anyway, I asked if they were handmade flour torts, and she said, negative, store bought. So I went with the corn. My son had the one taco kids meal on corn and my parents had street tacos and enchiladas. 

The real winner here is the chips and salsa. THAT SALSA IS SO DAME GOOD! Seriously, it tastes like my dads.... where did you get this recipe, ehhh!?

We literally had 2 bowls waiting for the food... which was so-so on the time. It finally came, and I was pretty let down. I looked at my dad in laws plate, and was like, wtf? His enchiladas were hella... flaccid? LOL. Then it donned on me! He asked for his on corn as well, then at the end she asked if he wanted corn or flour torts - we both thought they were going to give us extra with our order, so he said, none. SO, when his order came, they were literally just meat and cheese because he initially told her corn - but at the end she asked and he said none. He's a good sport and didn't say anything. 

Let me preface this - my orders always come out effed up. ALWAYS. Today was no different. I looked at the rice and was kind of turned off, it was ugly and not the traditional spanish rice. They make it with annatto - achiote, but it's seriously not good. I wasted a few carbs on it. LOL. The lack beans were just ok. AND NOW - the enchiladas. I got the picante, I can handle heat... I can't handle gross. I was expecting so hella spicy enchis, and I got some tart spicy ones. I couldn't get past the tart orange flavor, it tasted rotten. I politely asked the server if I may try different ones, and she suggested the verdes... those too were not the business, like, at all! I literally had to deep throat one, and take the other home. The steak was cooked pretty good though. My son order a taco on corn, and it came out on flour - he also said the meat, beef, was super spicy. When I was pregnant I ate spicy everything, my son can take spice! So, they must have been crazy. My moms street tacos looked very sad, so tiny! She said they were ok, and ate 2 out of 5. We also have the stuffed jalapenos and spicy shrimp for apps- they're were ok, jalapenos left me desiring more. We literally had left over on EVERYTHING. That's seriously unheard of for Mexicans! LOL. I took the remainder of my enchilada and some beans home... I ate it the next morning and wanted to puke, it does not keep well! I ate the meat and tossed the rest.

I really waned to love this place - alas, it let me down... like all the Kings fans probably felt when the Avalanche beat them on the last Frozen Fury game... Go Avs! LOL.

You would think on day one that there would be staffing or food issues, but everything was prefect! Their happy hour menu is extensive. $5.00 items will leave you very satisfied and full. I had the guacamole to start off with chips and salsa. The guacamole is very well blended and tasty. It comes with a salsa verde that is very flavorful and not watered down. A hint of spice and it's perfect! You also get jalape√±os and spiced carrots with onions as well. Then I ordered the $5.00 chicken quesadilla which was amazing! Very flavorful and a decent portion! I also got 3 street tacos ($1.50 each at happy hour) I tried the braised beef, it was ok not my thing, chicken taco was awesome same chicken that was in the quesadilla, and 1 chorizo taco it was ok just not my thing. I also tried the frozen mango margarita which was very refreshing and not too strong, just right amount of alcohol. Overall the service was awesome, the food was truly amazing and the atmosphere was excellent! Their portions are a good size and I walked out very full! Flavored are spicy and not watered down. I will definitely come back at least once a week and try other items on their menu. Also this is a tequila bar and their selection was absurd!!! It looked like they had at least 150 of them to chose from!!! Keep up the good work!!  Looking forward to coming back!

4484514,2017-01-20,4,iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA,"What restaurant has a Spanish name, Mexican menu, and decor reminiscent of the 800-year Moorish occupation of Spain?  Bingo, Casa del Matador.

I really liked the vibe - beautiful woods with a very high wood ceiling, lots of metal, beautiful curved wood tables at the raised banquettes, a very long bar and communal pub table, and lighting and other decor that took me back to my first visit to the Alhambra.  But all that wood has a price:  the bench seats, as well as the ones at the tables (I tried both), are tush torture.  The benches, at least, could definitely benefit from cushions.  They need to pick some colorful Mexican woven fabrics, and then even thin cushions could enhance the space bootyfully. 

Their regular Happy Hour ends too early for us, so we went for dinner.  Our server, Dalia, was lovely, and is the probably the most authentic representative of the restaurant.  I had a good time practicing Spanish with her.

We started with red sangria, mostly because it was described as having Pisco, a Peruvian and Chilean brandy.  It was a good-sized glass, tasty and much less sweet than the usual sangria.  But I didn't taste any mango which, as a puree, should have been readily apparent.

The menu isn't all as large as other Mexican restaurants, but we didn't lack for choices.  There were four different enchiladas to choose from, and my husband ordered Enchiladas Poblanas, one of the milder versions.  He enjoyed them.  I had carnitas, a dish I've never ordered before, strange because of how many times I've been to the real Mexico, not just the tourist resorts.  And I learned what I have been missing all these years!  Of course I have nothing to compare them to, but I was really happy with the tender  and mildly spiced  lean pork.  Both of our dishes came with Spanish rice, a dollop of guacamole and black beans with cotija cheese, again unusual for being slightly spicy instead of bland.  Mine also had some lime sour cream - really good - and pico de gallo.  Not enough pico de gallo, but I probably could have had more if I'd asked.  Pretty good corn tortillas accompanied my carnitas.

Casa del Matador specializes in - drumroll - tequila!, and has a 50% off tequila special on Tuesdays.  Not being a tequila maven, I didn't pay a lot of attention to the details, but if you're interested, it'll be easy to find out.

My only complaint was with the Ladies' room.  The two stalls were in dire need of attention.  Granted, most of the mess was attributable to women with absolutely no manners, but the strange, funky, sorta sewage-y odor was not from what bathroom odors are usually made of.  It needs fixing, pronto.

Overall, we enjoyed our dinners, the ambiance, and the service, and we will definitely return.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,8,4,MPns6BBxoX6QIxxfCnwR-w

We were seated below a bull skull with a roses adorning it's head. I'm sure it was fake just in case you were grossed out for a second. I had to start off with their bacon wrapped jalapenos ($11.00) They were addicting especially with my Strawberry Margarita ($8.50) the salty with the sweet perfect combo.  I had the Carne Asada taco with just rice no beans for me . ($14.50) The portion size was decent and the food was pretty tasty.

4492050,2017-07-26,3,iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA,"This is one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a while. Literally, from the moment I arrived, it started to go down hill. And, just. Kept. Snowballing.

I was meeting friends for dinner at 630p for their promo of bottomless street tacos and margaritas for $25. I was a bit early, so I went to the bar for a drink. I explained to the bartender that I was meeting friends, but I was early. I ordered a Sangria. And, when she served it to me I tried to give her my card because I knew my dining companions were on their way, I knew I wouldn't be drinking a 2nd drink at the bar, and I knew it would slow things down to have to pay my bar tab when it was time to be seated. She refused and told me she'd start a tab. I said I didn't want to do that and again tried to hand her my card, but she told me it was no problem and walked away. But, it actually was a problem for me. When my friends arrived, I again tried to pay for my drink and after about 3 minutes of waiting at the bar and being unsuccessful, I gave up and joined my friends at our table. I mentioned my unpaid for drink to the hostess and our server. So, I made a strong effort to tell several employees.

We asked to be seated on the patio since it was a nice night. I initially thought it was closed since no one was sitting out there, but they told us it wasn't when we asked. And, after we were seated out there, other Diners followed suit. But, even this felt like it took time.

Once we were seated, we were given menus, and then we waited...and waited...and waited. It took FOREVER to get someone to come take our order. When the server finally did take our orders (there 6 of us). He then started retaking our orders. It was odd, but we laughed it off. We, also, asked to see a dessert menu at this time, which never came.

4 of the 6 ordered the bottomless special, and 2 of us ordered other items off the menu. The people who ordered the bottomless tacos tried to order what they felt like they wanted to start, for example 3 of each kind, but we're told they could only have 5 at a time. I get it, you don't want to leave the kitchen scrambling, but c'mon. AND...it made no difference since 2 of the 4 taco eaters were left with no food for at least 30 minutes. At no time did a manager or a server, or anyone else come by to apologise for or explain the delay. It turned out that those 2 diners had ordered al pastor tacos and the kitchen had run out and were making more. So you say nothing?? And, let half a party eat and half a party eat nothing?? Really??

I had ordered nachos which I 100% didn't eat. I didn't eat them because I had nothing to drink for at least 45 minutes to an hour. Nothing. I had ordered a 2nd Sangria and it just never came...partly because our server disappeared partly because when he did he told us they had sent people home and they were slammed. In the meantime, someone at our table who had not ordered a 2nd drink because they still had half of their 1st one, was given a 2nd drink...while I had nothing. Even my water glass was long empty by this time. Again, no one cared to ask if something was wrong with the nachos or inquire as to why they were sitting in front of me completely untouched.

In addition to the dessert menu that never came, was an order of chips and guacamole. No one ever offered dessert either. They did, however charge us for the chips & guacamole we never got. The server removed them from the bill, but questioned that we didn't get them. WHO did he think brought them?? Certainly not him. He was nowhere to be found!!

I feel bad blaming the server. I know that they're the face you see and when things are going wrong elsewhere in a restaurant, they get blamed. Clearly, there were failures all over this restaurant. The management should not have sent anyone home leaving the place short staffed, the kitchen wasn't prepared for week 2 of the bottomless taco promo, and if you are serving a bar full of people and running a bottomless margarita promo you need more than 1 bartender. I dine out often enough to understand this and none of us gave the server any flack. But, WHERE was anyone... our server, ANY server, A MANAGER to explain the unbelievably long delays and just say they were sorry for it. Our bill was over $150 for the 6 of us. There had to be someone available to say or do something to make up for it...yet no one came. And, that is why I won't be heading back to Casa del Matador. The food was OK, but the service/execution was horrendous.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,4,3,1,9rPg2iI4h1n3Q7wKu91N_g

I would always go to panchos but today I wanted to try something new with my family and I had a HORIBLE EXPERIENCE. I've had bad experiences in the past where I wouldn't be that upset but this time I had to write a review!  Once I arrived I had a waitress named Nicole.  She was so rude and arragont. The first thing my husband asked for was a cold beer and she said ""everything is the same temperature"" with attitude then he asked for a cold glass and she said she didn't have any cold glasses so she wasn't being helpful at all. Later on I ordered a strawberry margarita and I had to repeat myself 3 times because she wasn't focusing on me. Afterwards I ordered street tacos I even pointed at the menu  and then she asked me if I preferred corn or flour tortilla with it I told her I wanted flour because I don't like corn. Once they came with the food they brought me the wrong dish I told them that I asked for the street tacos the busser (guy) that was helping her out apologized he was way more helpful than her he had  krisma. Later on She brought the right dish out and said ""here you go I had another order for someone else that got the street tacos so I snatched this one for you""  I began to eat it and realized it was corn tortilla even tho I told her I didn't want that I wanted flour so I ate what was on top and left the five corn tortillas. I just wanted you guys to know that I did not feel welcomed and that I had horrible service. She doesn't even have patience. The place wasn't even that busy maybe 5 tables only were busy.

Let's say we really enjoyed it because we ate here 2 days in a row (haha) Then I came back a 3rd time with a friend because it was that good. 

First of all, the complimentary chips & salsa is addicting. I don't know how they make their chips but I'm assuming they sprinkle crack on it because I couldn't stop snacking on them. 

The first meal I had there was the cilantro lime shrimp which was served over rice and with this awesome sauce bell peppers and onions. It was so good, I didn't even have time to take pictures of it. I cleaned my plate. They gave you a decent amount of shrimp and they were pretty big as well. My bf had the carne asada which was served with mashed potatoes and corn. I had a piece of his carne asada and it was really good. Nice & tender and melts in your mouth! For drinks, he has the blood orange margarita and I had the Jalisco mule. Both were made nicely, but his you can really taste the alcohol haha. 

The following day, we came back again and this time for brunch. I had the Huevos Rancheros and he has the breakfast burrito. Both were really good and filling. The Huevos Rancheros was nicely put together and the salsa was spicy but not intolerable. I had their bloody mary and it's by far the best bloody mary I've had in a while. The chipotle seasoning that they mixed made all the difference. I didn't try my bf's stuff this time around because I was already struggling finishing my food because I was so full. 

My most recent visit with my friend, we went for happy hour. They have happy hour from 3-6pm and 10pm-closing. We had their mango margarito, habanero shrimp, bacon wrapped stuffed jalape√±os, and their shrimp tacos. All of which were amazing! I loved everything we ordered and it was a lot of food because I couldn't breathe towards the end of our meal. The margarita was yummy and had mango chunks in it! The habanero shrimp was really yummy but super spicy. I love spicy so I couldn't leave it alone. The bacon wrapped stuffed jalape√±os were really good as well. I don't usually like goat cheese but the bacon and jalape√±os with the goat cheese really complimented each other. The shrimp tacos were really good as well! Simple but tasty! 

Clearly, I have a love for this place and mind you I went here 3 times within a week so that should say something.

Food wise I opted for trying the al pastor and chorizo tacos. They were only $1.50 each on HH! The taste on both were good, but definitely not the best I ever had. I wish they had put more onions or toppings on them. I also had one of the frozen margaritas for just $5. I went with the mango flavor with chili on the rim, very good! Another thing I can't forget is their chips and salsa. I'm super picky when it comes to salsa and theirs was very good.

I've been here several times (I keep trying to love it) but it always disappoints. Each time I've been here, the service has been sub-par (both at the bar and also at a table). But look - I'm willing to look past bad service for great margaritas, but that's not the case either.  The drinks have NOT been delicious, but they certainly were pricey. 

Ugh - and the FOOD...I've tried a couple different entrees and appetizers and it's just not that good. From the bacon wrapped jalape√±o to the taco salad, the execution just isn't there. Everything on the menu sounds great...but it just doesn't hit the spot.

I ordered $5 nachos and waiter asked if I wanted to add meat which apparently costs an extra $6. Food came out at random times for different parts of our group. The food was good and came out freshly made and hot. Waiter was difficult to locate although we had no trouble get help from other staff helping out. When clearing our table they asked if we wanted part of our meal boxed up and then never saw it again. When we asked where it went they said they would bring us another and never did. Finally they asked us to leave since a larger group was coming in although they did offer a pitcher of margarita if we moved to a different table.

The margaritas were very refreshing! The frozen lime margaritas are awesomely priced at $5 and the mango margaritas are $6. I'm always a bit hesitant to try fruit margaritas because most places use a fake sugary mix.

Found this place on Yelp while waiting for a table at Dave & Busters. The wait time for a table at D&B's was 2 hours and some of us were hungry so we headed over to this place. 

It's one of the few restaurants open at 11:30pm at Downtown Summerlin. Open till 2am and Happy Hour till 1am. SCORE! 

We ordered from the HH menu: 
- $1.50 street tacos (carnitas & al pastor) -- they were tiny compared to other places but surprisingly I walked out of there satisfied. It could've used some sauce and pineapple. (see photos) 

- $5 cheese quesadilla - This one was the best deal. They added A LOT of cheese, always a plus in my book, I love me some cheese. It was maybe half an inch thick. (sorry no photo)

- $6 frozen mango margarita -- I guess it depends on the bartender, but this drink was surprisingly strong (in a good way :-) )! Totally recommend. 

*** TIP: They have an extensive selection of Tequila (120 to choose from), recommend trying if you love tequila! 

- $5 Nachos Grande - It was huge. Totally recommend. 

- $6 Calamari - included a few fried veggies (red peppers & a green veggie). Not the best I've had, but not bad. 

The most memorable were the mango margarita, quesadilla and the decor. I loved the gorgeous lanterns, booth tables, & indoor fire pit table. Cute spot for date night :-). 

Looks like this place just opened a few weeks ago. I recommend checking it out if you're at DTS! 

TIPS:
* Happy Hour every day: 4-6pm & 10pm-1am. 
 
**From D&B's it's a long walk. Recommend driving there if you don't like walking. It's located near Krave.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,7,9,4,9fCn8Sa2cgAzrEpMxMWwwg

However, you'd think on a Saturday night, they'd have their A game on.  I have to start by saying this is a beautiful restaurant from a decor perspective. Gorgeous inside. 

As for the food, it's just okay. A third of the chips in our basket were stale. Kind of disturbing to find those little hidden gems when you're trying to enjoy your salsa. I will say the salsa is quite tasty however. We tried the queso and ordered it without onions. Of course, it came full of onions. We sent it back. We ordered the street tacos, again without onions, and of course they came with onions. Might be a small thing, but you'd think if someone takes time to order food without something, as a server, you'd check to make sure it was right. Nope. 

The chicken was oily and dripped out of the taco. The carnitas have decent flavor, but there's a lot of cinnamon in their making so be ready for that.  I've been eating Mexican food in Las Vegas for 30 years, and I've seen a lot of places come and go. I hope Matador makes it as its a really cool place, but they need to take a step back and focus on the food. It's what will keep people coming back for years to come. I feel like they are trying to hard to pack as many flavors into the food all at once.

Although I don't drink, I can never pass up a good happy hour menu, and there's is amazing. The hours are 3-6 pm and 10 - closing daily. I've order the following from the happy hour menu: habanero chicken wings, the strawberry salad, chicken quesadilla, nachos, chicken street tacos, and braised beef street tacos.

The chile relleno is my fave! It's stuffed with rice, black beans, and cheese. It's not fried, but you don't miss it! I also enjoyed the chipotle mushrooms and the queso fundido. 

Always save room for dessert, because they have the lightest cheesecake on the planet. Now, you have not truly experienced fried ice cream until you've tried it here. I won't give away the surprise ingredients, but I'd nominate it for Dessert of the Year 2018.

The Matador is a large space with a definite Mexican theme.  There is a variety of seating and a long & huge bar with 2 screens above.  We liked the amount of light streaming through every window.  You'll need to find ""your"" place in the Matador; that is, for more peace & quiet.  There are booths & a bar in the middle, though no cushions on any seating, meaning your rump may be screaming at you after a half hour.  Servers were in abundance and knew their products.  Even the main menu is well priced & we were impressed with the choices.

We ordered mango margaritas for $5.00 (having my ""designated driver"" with me), carnitas & chicken street tacos ($1.50 ea.), mushroom quesadilla and bowls of green chiles.  Yes, I could taste the fine tequila in the margarita & it was perfect, with just the right amount of sweetness.  The chips & salsa were very good.  The tacos were delicious & surprisingly filling, & also contained avocado, cheese & cilantro.  The quesadillas were substantial, more out-of-the-ordinary, & I'd order them again.  It was the green chile, served with piping hot tortillas, that stood out.  Spicy but not too hot & really scrumptious!  This happy hour menu is very special & even includes 2 salads & 2 soups.

That being said this is only visit #1, and it is truly mediocre at best. The most compelling variable is, this place is aesthetically beautiful. The decor feels cluttered but, it works. I like the ambiance and it certainly feels more upscale than the food quality and service up to this point but, it's early in their life.

Let's talk service; the bar staff lacks the intuition of a seasoned crew. You know how good bartenders can anticipate your needs? Well that does not exist here. They were so busy doing ""busy work,"" I was ignored more than a couple of times. One bartender was more concerned about getting his personal meal for the night at 8:15p that he never checked on me before he left and, all I needed was my bill. The other bartender was so busy talking and taking care of his coworkers who were guests that night at the bar that those ""guest coworkers"" noticed and even apologized for the bad service! The couple seated to my left even grumbled at the fact that none of the two bartenders asked if they needed anything else. By the way, the bar was only 40% occupied. 

Now the food. I ordered a strawberry salad which on paper sounded great. Take a look at that picture. My military school cafeteria can make a more garnished and visually pleasing presentation than that. It tasted okay and the price was fair but, presentation, sucked. Street tacos, were good. Especially for the price but, once again, it is such a contradiction to the entire ambiance of the restaurant which feels and looks more upscale. Schooling in plating and garnish is in order. The flavors relative to the $12 price were good.

Finally, the owner.¬† He happened to be sitting at the bar next to me when I first sat down. Let's just call him ""Nick"" (close to his real name, same number of letters), he is why this place is the way it is. Zero personality, gruff, no sense of engagement, no awareness of his guests, he acted as though his s**t didn't stink. My thoughts apparently were corroborated by the bar staff and other workers. As soon as he left the bar, I got an eavesdrop FULL of what they thought of him. 

It would be a real shame if this place failed. Sadly, Panchos with their start up disaster and ridiculous pricing is going to look good after this.",6_OsfMU6GhlnhKE1g28r9g,4,0,2,4kxLOF0AXeAg1CVBW4douw

We were there for lunch, and were the first customers in the restaurant.  So you would think the food would be fresh.  To the contrary.  My chicken enchiladas looked slapped together in a rush, yet still spent way to much time under the heat lamp.  The chicken was not shredded.  In fact, it was in large chunks with the skin still visible.  Luckily they were still tasty, as I was pretty hungry.

I will go back, and give them another shot.  However, only one more shot.  Luckily, the margaritas will call me back!",Fijzh96nE8F_Umsi2A2BSA,0,1,3,DQIlH3o9LbIJ9mZcTqKoXg
5385369,2017-05-06,0,iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA,"Went for cinco de mayo because we were looking for a nice patio to enjoy the weather. Got there around 2pm and walked into the restaurant, had to wait about 3 minutes before being greeted by a waiter who took us to a table outside. We walked by the bar which was lined with dirty glasses and cardboard boxes. Was one of two groups sitting on the patio and they sat us at the table directly next to the other group (a huge pet peeve of mine especially since there were about 40 other open tables on the patio). We were handed a food menu, a tequila menu, and a cinco de mayo menu. The tequila menu was like 10 pages long so that's kind of awesome. But I was looking for the cheap margs and crunchy tacos. Luckily the cinco de mayo menu had both. Cinco Rita $7, 3 fried tacos for $5 either beef or chicken or combo. 

Cinco Rita was mediocre at best, not even served in a margarita glass -what the heck 
Tacos had beans in them, which wasn't disclosed on the menu or when ordering and I can't eat beans so I had to send the tacos back (which I hate doing) the waiter seemed annoyed but he quickly brought me new tacos. 
The food was awesome honestly, the tacos were super crunchy and juicy meat. The salsa was kind of bland but pretty good. 
The waiter seemed flustered sand never refilled our waters (100 degree day in Vegas...come on) 
I'll go back to try the other food but I won't expect good service.",SbtShuhfGilv5qJrogXYTw,1,0,3,W0UzLRei0txKQnIOzPpaVA

The customer service was ok but the server didn't even offer to refill our waters. Menu items are pretty pricey. Got the taco plate with the five types of tacos and they were very very tiny and I pretty much finished one taco in two bites. The cheese on the tacos pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients of the tacos you couldn't really taste the seasoning of the meats. Also ordered the guacamole and it wasn't anything but average. Probably won't be here again.,P19z16iz5I9Hh4T99pY8Sg,1,2,3,MOZNohDVwPYkOT88PKzkwg

5653767,2016-08-15,1,iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA,"The family decided to try out this new spot yesterday afternoon. We happened to get lucky to arrive during happy hour. We also were lucky enough to score a parking spot curbside in front of the restaurant.

The entrance is rather commanding and you can see they have outdoor seating for when it is not 1000 degrees outside. When you walk in the host station is immediately to your left. The decor of the restaurant is breathtaking. Beautiful tiles, and hanging lamps of various shapes and sizes. Cool iron artwork with candles hanging on the walls and bullheads as well. The vibe is more Spanish and less Mexican. 

We were immediately sat in a booth by a very nice young man. My only complaint about the booth is there are no cushions so a little hard on the old tush but still comfortable for the time we were there. As we were viewing the main menu, my husband pointed out that the dishes on the happy hour should be able to satisfy us and he was right.

We all chose a couple of street tacos, chicken, al pastor, and braised beef. We also ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup, black bean queso and a chicken quesadilla. I enjoyed a mango margarita which definitely was packed with a punch but yummy! Also, they bring over chips and salsa when you first arrive to get your appetite going. I really liked the salsa as it had a nice kick to it but not overdone in terms of heat. They also have a green tomatillo sauce which is more sweet than spicy. We really enjoyed our tacos, good flavor and all the meats were cooked just right. We had some sour cream on the side for dipping and they have two types. One plain and the other with added cilantro. The chicken tortilla soup was definitely my favorite. Plenty of flavor here and the broth was simply delicious. The chicken quesadilla was also good. Not your average quesadilla, the chicken was cooked to perfection and very tasty. 

The service was very good. Our server was Aaliyah and she was very helpful, checked on us often and made sure we had everything we needed. For only being open a week and half, everything seemed to be running well.

For a total of four people, the bill was only $36, which we were all happy about! I plan to return for more happy hour eating and drinking. This is a cool place and super convenient to where I live!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,7,4,4,PLP-tDlbcleH8wBf4OO4hA

I was famished (as usual) and nothing in the Summerlin area sounded that great.  This place only had 3 stars which would normally have me looking elsewhere BUT if a restaurant is new or if it is in Summerlin, I will gladly give it an opportunity to prove itself otherwise.  We were so glad that we did!  The service was good, the margarita selections was abundant and the food was mouthwatering!  I savored every last bite of my shrimp tacos wrapped in lettuce (don't judge, it was a few days before Halloween and my costume was small) and my husband thought his carne asada was out of this world.  He can eat some spicy food and that one had him wiping his forehead which I enjoy watching as it's only happened three times during our marriage.  We have been back a few times since and have really enjoyed ourselves.  The taco salad is a must try if you are trying to convince yourself that you are eating health but really, deep down, you want to be naughty.  FYI for all of my fellow margarita drinkers, their margaritas are served in tall glasses. not margarita glasses.  Hope that is not a deal breaker!",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,5,4,5,B6oth7kD5P4fWAKETgNCtg

When at a Mexican restaurant, what else do you start your meal with but a margarita, depending on the day and my mood I choose either the blood orange margarita or the house margarita- both great choices! For a starter I highly recommend the grilled stuffed jalape√±os, they are so yummy- jalape√±os stuffed with goat cheese wrapped in hickory smoked bacon with ranch dressing. For an entree I recommend the grilled carne asada- grilled skirt steak with beans and rice served with tortillas.

They also have a great happy hour which will give you a chance to try a sampling of the menu at the HH prices. Enjoy!",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,0,0,3,H5sfr0UT3qAp9tIUMqvTyA

5947914,2017-05-07,0,iBlQvqiy5Rg2h-y9TS1yOA,"We were VERY disappointed. We chose this place as first timers for our Cinco De Mayo dinner. All four of us had an overall baaaad experience. There were a couple of good things about the night: 1. We were told it was gonna be a 45 minute wait and we were seated within 10 minutes. 2. The Queso Fundido was very good. They did forget to bring anything out for us to eat it with (tortillas, chips) but eventually we were able to ask our server how to eat it and he brought tortillas. Okay, so that was it. We were brought chips and salsa but no plates/napkins. Salsa on our fingers and no where to wipe them. Server wasn't sure what Micheledas were (at a Mexican restaurant on Cinco De Mayo??) but he put the order in. Took forever but they were satisfactory anyway. Hubby ordered carne asada burrito. I ordered chile rellenos. Our friends ordered street tacos and enchiladas. All of us received our food except hubby. Probably a 10 minute wait for his food after we got ours. Server brings out a steak. ? Sends it back and he waits 10 or so more minutes. Meanwhile, my chili rellenos isn't that. It's a bell pepper stuffed with rice and red sauce.  Awful. No cheese whatsoever. The street tacos were on tortillas that had never been warmed up, just the cold, firm, outta the package tortillas.  hubby's burrito arrives. He had asked for the mild tomatillo green sauce. Instead they burned his face off with what tasted like a ghost pepper sauce. I like things spicy-This was FIRE HOT. He can't eat it. Sends it back and they bring him 3 street tacos with a hunk of steak on each dry, cold, corn tortilla and a smidge of red sauce. We had enough. We complained to the manager and he said ""well, you're the ONLY ones that have ever complained about the food here"".  Well, I highly doubt that in 9 months of being open and having terrible service, terrible food, followed by terrible management. He removed 2 meals from our bill after saying he ""tried"" three times to make hubby happy. Smh. No, you messed his food up three times and gave him some inedible all three times.

You can't go wrong with taco salad right?  Wrong....worst taco salad ever!!!  Dark meat chicken (yuck), black beans hard as rocks and the sour cream had something green mixed in it that made it runny and weird tasting.  On top of the salad were pickled carrots!!  Really?
