64551,2013-06-04,0,DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg,"We were in the mood for some Chinese food one evening, and really didn't feel like hiting Panda Express again (although in hindsight, it would have been a better choice.)

We had tried a Pei Wei in San Antonio in the fall of 2012. I wasn't overly impressed then, but thought we'd give it another shot. We were over on the west side of town geocaching and this one was close to where we finished for the day.

We came in on an early Friday afternoon and the place wasn't very busy so we thought we'd be able to grab a quick meal with some decent service. We placed our order for two steak lo mein dinners with a side of pork rolls. We sat down and waited...and waited...and waited while our food sat dying on the pass. Finally the three busboy/waiters came in from their smoke break on the patio. They brought Brenda's food over and then the pork rolls. We asked about my dinner and said that was it. We pulled out the receipt and sure enough, even though the cashier repeated back that we ordered 2 lo meins, he only rang us up for one. Since I already had a bad taste in my mouth from our last visit to a Pei Wei, I declined to go up and order again.

I tried the pork rolls and they were so greasy the mustard wouldn't even stick to them. I tasted Brenda's lo mein and the noodles really didn't have much flavor at all. I suppose that having the food sit at the pass under a heat lamp for 15 minutes while the server was on his smoke break didn't help much. This place is really disorganized. While we were there, we watched a table of 4 get served. Three of the four people got their food while the fourth got served only after a 10 minute wait and finally complaining to the staff.

When the waiter came around to ask how our food was, he only asked me (the person who didn't have food in front of him). He ignored Brenda completely. Zero stars is way to high of a rating for this place. We could have had a much better meal at Panda Express at a better price with better service.

507287,2009-10-02,4,DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg,"Beware of large crowds.  If you see a mostly full dining room and a line a few deep at the register be prepared to commit a good hour of your evening to the Wei dynasty. 

While waiting, try to get a seat facing the kitchen, which is in full view of the dining room; a dining room that is, in essence, a high school cafeteria in disguise.  (Don't be tempted to sit with the cool kids, it's a trap.  They'll only make fun of you.)  Facing the kitchen affords you a great entertainment option while you patiently wait for your food, because nothing is as wondrous as a fully-slammed, high volume kitchen.

Four to five line cooks man the woks, flinging wire baskets of meats and vegetables back and forth in a juggling show the likes of which I haven't seen since the Flying Karamazov Brothers.  At regular intervals large tongues of flame would leap up around the woks and bask the kitchen in an orange glow.  Pyro too!?  Best show off the strip!

I also had ample time to observe the food runner (is he a waiter? a busboy? indentured servant?) who was very pleasant, never letting the hectic pace of his shift dampen his spirits, and he was very kind when he told me that after my 30-plus minutes of waiting he was just informed that they were out of the main ingredient of my dish.  He offered a substitute and had no problems changing my order to ""to-go,"" thankfully, because the kitchen show was starting to get a little repetitive and I was late for my movie.

The food itself was meh-inspiring, an improvement over Panda Express, but that's like saying the Dodge Aspen is better than the Plymouth Volar√©, which is not saying much, and if you're there at any sort of rush hour, the ""fast"" in ""fast casual"" goes out the window.  But if you've got a hankering for some ThaiChinapanese food at around 3pm on a Tuesday, I say go for it.",QoHFdySn4K85_aLsgyWUEA,2,1,2,QrYdlu_HFLCXC9Dgbp4d1A

Pei Wei is a favorite of ours and we visit quite often.  This is a fast food - version of PF Changs and you are missing out if you are a PF fan.  From all that I have ordered from Pei Wei I can honestly say that alot of it is similar recipes.  Our favorite waitress RENA makes our dining experience just THAT much better.  She litereally knows everyone who walks through the door and greets them with open arms.  She is the epitomy of customer service.  We love her!!!  Make sure if you visit and run into her let her know you heard about her on Yelp!  ;)

Last nights dinner - on the patio mind you - (Love) starting with crab wontons which are always perfection sitting on top of a plate of a sweet and sour kind of sauce.  They are to die for.  The BF had to have the edemame which for some reason at this place they always seem to be on steroids!  They are huge.  It is served with a little cup of sea salt that you can sprinkle on as you see fit.  For the entrees BF had mongolian beef with steamed rice.  Very similar to PF....aws flav.  I usually try to steal a few bites when he's not looking.  I ordered the seseme chicken but instead of fried I asked for their ""stalk velvet"" which is a healthy version of cooking.  I think its kind of pan seared.  You can order most dishes this way but you have to ask for it special.  Their brown rice is alway cooked to perfection.  I dont know why it is that hard to cook brown rice but you'd be suprised.  

Food is ALWAYS great.  I dont think of all the years we have been coming here we have ever been disappointed!  The customer service-just because of the waitresses they have had has been simply amazing.  Enough to make you coming back even if the food wasnt that great. haha  So don't tell me you never heard of this place - you just did!",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,1,1,5,HaHxiFoMAOUVolmvkBvObw

Pei Wei is a mystery to me.  It isn't quite what PF Changs used to be (I think the quality has drastically decreased over the last few years) and it isn't take-out Chinese either.  They offer a few different influences in their dishes (Korean, Thai, Chinese, Japanese) but all are bland and disappointing.  They're missing the point here.  Either go for the low cost, greasy take out we all love, or the more refined, pricier fare you'd find elsewhere.

Lately, her fav place is Pei Wei.  Surprisingly, I've come to enjoy Pei Wei, too.

Her standard dish is Chicken Curry ( sauce on the side ) , ""stock velvet"" with extra veggies, no onion and brown rice ( 7.95) - It's a very large serving for the price.

I usually get a bowl of hot and sour soup ( $4.95) - a little too ""thick "" from what i presume is corn starch but i like it and it's a very generous serving.  I then prefer the dan dan noodles with Shrimp ($8.50) - I've yet to finish it given the large portion provided.  Again, for what it is, I'm a fan.  Yes, it's ""americanized"" but i don't care.

I've had quite a few things from Pei Wei and the follow are a few that I like: Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken or Shrimp Lo Mein, Edamame and the Crab Wontons.  My husband always orders the Mongolian Beef.

This food is not something that I crave or that I say ""Lets order from Pei Wei! Because its SO GOOD!""  Rather, its one of those places that is like ""well... i dunno what I want for dinner, do you?  I guess we could do Pei Wei, since its cheap and fast and I reallllyyyyyyy don't feel like cooking.""

What I do like- they are extremely fast and when you call to place your order, your number comes up in their caller ID, so they address you by name and ask if you would like the same order from last time (which they tell you what you ordered).  That would make ordering even faster!

ANYWAY, Pei Wei!
Go in, order, take a number, grab a seat along with your drink, and hot food is brought to you since everything is cooked nice and hot to order.  

The younger sister to PF. Chang's.  It has more of a pan-asian variety of Thai/Chinese then just straight Chinese cuisine compared Chang's.  The food comes in large portions, nice and hot with plenty of fortune cookies and delicious teas available.

I almost ALWAYS get the pad thai with extra chicken and tofu.  Their cooked tofu is really very good, very flavorful and it actually KEEPS very well in the fridge for a day.  

They are a PINCH pricier than I'd prefer, buuuuut.... c-est las vie.

I DID take AWAY a star though based on my first experience at this particular location where I stood waiting for my order to be taken while the cashier was going on and on to a server and then walked up without an apology or ""Oh, hello!  I'm sorry, I didn't see you there!"" or anything of the sort.  Or a friendly gesture or whathaveyou.

2229626,2010-05-19,1,DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg,"Went with my boyfriend one day while on this side of town. We were both famished and ordered it to go so we could sit outside with our puppy. We started with beers, which came with an icy cold glass- a nice touch. Beers were $3.50-4 a bottle, which is fairly reasonable. The restaurant has a quick turn over and fills up quickly. It's interesting being able to see the cooking going on in the background, though it feels awkward standing around waiting for your order. It's essentially a chipotle for asian food but a little fancier looking. I ordered the chile ramen with beef- essentially a lot of msg-laden egg noodles [like pancit] in a ponzu-mirin sauce with a little bit of beef and a few vegetables. It wasn't what I had anticipated and while it filled my gaping belly, wasn't something I'd ever order again. There was hardly any beef and the whole package was essentially stuffed with noodles, a super cheap ingredient. My boyfriend got a chicken dish that was recommended by the hostess but it had very little chicken, no veggies and tons of rice. Maybe it was because we ordered it to go...I'd eaten at other Pei Wei locations in town but it had been years ago, and the experience hadn't excited me enough then to draw me back over.

2241227,2014-01-23,0,DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg,"There's been a few noticeable changes here since my last visit to Pei Wei. First, they replaced the long menu board near the entrance to a smaller and easier to read electronic menu screen. Some menu items such as the combos have been removed and some new items have been added, mostly appetizers and salads. Simply choose your protein (chicken, steak, shrimp, or tofu), size (small or large entree),  then your sauce, and then type of rice or noodle (white, brown, fried, etc). I don't come here much and I always forget what I got last time, so I just choose what sounds good. I've had all different entrees here and seem to usually go with Pei Wei spicy, orange peel, sesame or spicy Korean. This time around I decided to try sweet and sour chicken with a cup of Thai wonton soup. The wonton soup is nice and light, and the sweet and sour chicken was good but they tend to oversauce their entrees so if you're sensitive to that, be sure to tell them when ordering. The small entree size was perfect and I typically have a hard time finishing a large size, but it's only 2 bucks more.

They also removed the old skool soda fountain and installed a Coca Cola Freestyle machine on one side of the self service counter and a water/ice machine on the other side. The seating is all the same and if you're dining in, you simply grab your seat after grabbing your drinks and they'll bring your order out to you when it's ready, which isn't very long and they'll pick up your empty plates when you're done. Silverware, boxes, drinks, sauces and fortune cookies are all self service here.

I would recommend this place when you're looking for a fast casual Asian fusion meal. The food here is better than places like Panda Express and a lot fresher but the menu items are fairly similar.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,4,7zei9wO_fJro4GoiyCJJFQ

I have been several times and it is totally great for what it is.
What is it? It is PF Chang's version of Fast Food, but with good fresh ingredients.

You can basically build your own food, which is kind of interesting. You choose the sauce, noodle, protein, etc. The service is ALWAYS friendly and fun, which I really appreciate! Each dish runs about $10, depending on how you build it. Certain ingredients cost more, you get the picture.

Last time I was these I saw a couple sharing a large noodle dish and a couple apps, family style. This looked brilliant to me! I have always been a fan of the apps here, but don't order them because that and a bowl of noodles is just too much food for me personally. But sharing sounds like the way to go!

Then came Vegas. There is no Pei Wei close to my home and I realized I never do crave it. For something I used to have once a week, a non-craving for Pei Wei  really did mean I must not have liked their food that much. I confirmed that suspicion today. 

I ordered the Kid's Teriyaki Bowl with Tofu and Veggies. Brown rice at no extra charge. Definitely a plus point. I find the portions at Pei Wei too big and so the kids portion suffices and is actually a bit large still for me. I love that they allow someone clearly older than 12 to qualify for this portion. Kudos to Pei Wei. I usually order an extra serving of Tofu and Veggies and that is what I did today. 3.95 for the kids bowl and $2 for the extra tofu/veggie serving. 

What I got at my table (in a very timely manner) was a dish that met all my expectations. Generous heaping of tofu with snow peas. carrots and broccoli. In Dallas, I remember this dish as having spinach which was something I missed today. The tofu here is different from anywhere else. It's long and seems rather dehydrated. But it actually tastes rather pleasant. 

Pei Wei is true American Chinese Food. Created in America, for Americans. It's definitely not as tasty as PF Changs but they do offer dependable fare that CAN be made fairly healthy (if you choose to exercise portion control) and it's a nice spot to hang for a quick lunch.

You can't afford to have dinner at P.F. Chang's very often.. And you're not adventurous enough to try out the local mom and pop eateries.  What are you supposed to do?

Well, if this is you, there's a few options..
You can either settle, make more money, or get over your fears.

Luckily though, life doesn't have to be that difficult, and Pei Wei exists, making this dilemma a non-issue really.

This place offers the fast preparation of Panda, and the gourmet style of Chang's at a price most would consider reasonable. I'd definitely say it's fair for the food you get.

The food always comes out hot and fresh, made to order. The veggies are crisp and colorful, rich in flavor. I've never had any meat that wasn't tender.

I recommend the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. It's a juicy chicken, lightly fried and tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce.  It's sweet at first but has a nice little bite to it. Not hot by any stretch, but definitely has some spice.  

Thai dynamite is another similar spicy chicken dish I enjoy. I have a hard time deciding between these two.

I always order brown rice because A) it's healthier B)Pei Wei offers it .. and  C) they do it well.

For something a little more fun, though, I recommend their lo mein noodles.

Like all great Asian establishments, pei Wei has hot chili paste for your dining pleasure. This wonderful hot sauce is one of the few things on earth I consider to be pure and altogether good to the soul.  What sets Pei Wei apart is the fact that they have dozens of bowls of this stuff available for you to pick up at the bar to bring to your table. Just help yourself!! And don't mind if I do... I easily drain a whole bowl each time.

They have those nifty futuristic robot time machine drink dispensers with the screen that lets you invent any crazy flavored fountain drink you can think of.  That's cool and all, but I'm a tea drinker on most days. Pei Wei has an outstanding selection for folks like me. I recommend the Mandarin iced green tea. With a lemon wedge this stuff is so refreshing and satisfying to the taste buds. A perfect companion to the fresh food you'll likely receive.

This location is always immaculate, and my food is always delivered with a smile.

I was so hungry after spending 3.5 hours volunteering at the aid station for the Viva Bike Vegas 2012 ride that I could have eaten a take out menu and thought it was good.

This was my first time here and I had researched Yelp reviews and their online menu.  I ordered from the take out window one order of chicken lettuce wraps and a large hot and sour soup.  The lettuce wraps were very good.  I am a salt lover, but the sauce made the wraps salty even for me.  But, I still enjoyed them.

The hot and sour soup had a rich taste but I'm not used to having ground meat in hot and sour soup.  It's generally small slices of pork.  The texture was a bit of a turn off and I didn't think the soup was that spicy.

My biggest issue was service.  I realize I was a walk in at 4:30 on a Saturday evening.  There were four people in the restaurant at the time.  There were some take out orders to be made but there was never less than three cooks working behind the counter and before I got my meal, there were 5 total.  I probably waited 15 minutes.  I saw the one cook pick up and handful of rice sticks and toss it into the take out box--no gloves, no tongs--just bare hands.  Also, the soup was ladled into the take out container and just left on the metal shelf for 10 minutes while the other things were being prepared.

When the counter critter brought my bag, she apologized for the long wait.  I watched this place as it was being built and never stopped.  That's been about 10 years.  I guess I can wait again before I return.  The lettuce wraps saved the rating from being 2 stars.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,2,1,3,oOYWAKzknENdmbCT4fsWag

4014359,2011-04-18,2,DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg,"I'll give it a 3 1/2 stars.  It works for me!

Pei Wei is great when I'm in that crossroads of 'I overpaid for my condo so I can't afford P.F. Chang's right now' and 'If I have Panda Express one more time this week I think I'm gonna smuggle a bear and paint it black and white'!  It fits the bill right in the middle!  

I don't always particularly crave this place as a must eat because while it is cheaper and more convenient than it's big bro P.F. Chang's, it definitely costs a few dolla-dolla bills more than Panda Express.  That being said, we'll often end up at Pei Wei because the kids don't want burgers, are a bit tired of Subway, and are sad looking at pandas eating bamboo on modern painted restaurant walls.

I like Pei Wei for the most part, but of course it definitely isn't authentic Asian cuisine in most cases.  They definitely cater to the American taste palette!  For what it is the place works great. 

The menu is pretty easy to read.  Right when you enter, as you walk down to the cashier station to order the menus are right in front of you on large lit boards to look at.  Very convenient, and good marketing technique!  Make em' hungry before they even order!  The have your appetizers, salads, noodles and rice bowls, and entrees all prominently displayed on their menu.  Most entrees run from the $6-$9 range depending on what you choose and if you get it with chicken, beef, shrimp, or veggies.  The great thing here is that with all of their signature entrees you can sub in brown rice for free!  Trust me, their brown rice is good!  We get it every time.

Here's what we usually order for our family of 4:

Asian Chicken Chopped Salad - Chicken with greens, napa cabbage, carrots, Thai basil, tomatoes, crispy wontons, toasted sesame seeds, with a sesame ginger vinaigrette.  Very good!  Light and flavorful!  Our favorite salad at Pei Wei, although sometimes I wish they would add some green onion and cilantro for a bit of punch.

Chicken Lo Mein - Chicken with lo mein noodles, rice wine sauce, scallions, garlic, onions, bean sprouts, shiitake mushrooms, and carrots.  The kids fav!  Although it is a bit greasy it tastes great!  Much better than the lo mein you find at that Panda place.  

We like these signature dishes as our favs, we'll usually pick one with chicken:

Honey Seared - Crispy chicken with honey garlic sauce, chili oil, rice sticks, scallions, and red bell pepper.  Yum...Asian-y!

Orange Peel - Crispy chicken with chile bean sauce, orange peels, scallions, garlic, snap peas, and carrots.  If you like Orange Chicken from the Panda, this is a good start for you!  

Spicy Korean - Chicken with Korean hot pepper sauce, garlic, mushrooms, carrots, onion, long beans, and toasted sesame seeds.  It's got a nice lil' kick to it!

Korean BBQ (brand new dish) - Chicken seared with carrots, scallions, in a smoky-sweet gogo BBQ sauce.  Then topped with a salad of green apples, bean sprouts, red bell peppers, mizuna, and a Korean vinaigrette.  It's good!  My new fav!  Now if they would only add a side order of Kim Chee to it...hello, taste buds!

The menu also has several options for kids, as well as a nice sized gluten free menu.  Pei Wei takes money from everyone, folks!

Serving portions are ok, although I wish they were a bit larger for the price.  A signature dish at Pei Wei (white or brown rice included) could feed two people...barely!  I can definitely finish an entire dish by myself!  

Service is fast, speedy, and usually pretty friendly.  I've never had problems before. Their take out is popular, but Pei Wei can sit a number of people in their place nicely.  I also like how they have hot mustard, siracha, shoyu, and vinegar at the ready by their tables so that you can concoct your little dipping sauce for your food.  

Down for some Asian-American food with no fuss and a bit of flair?  Give Pei Wei a try today!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,1,3,tvaNsl3EzDlmSp0b5ZT9Kw

Last night we had the Chicken Pad-thai, the Thai Coconut Curry & an order of spring rolls with sweet chili sauce.

As usual I was satisfied with the pad thai.  YES I know this isn't genuine pad-thai but I love it nonetheless.  I love their tofu! I don't know what they do with their tofu that is different from everywhere else but I'd be a tofu convert if it was this way in more places! 

My husband loved the coconut curry.  The spring rolls were crisp without being the slightest bit of greasy.

Kung Pao Chicken was too hot (spicy) for me even though I asked for the light version of the sauce. My husband liked it because he likes hot and spicy and that was his order anyway. I got Thai Coconut Curry with Chicken and it was horrible. There were way too many cooked white onions which grossed me out. And where was the coconut or curry? I couldn't taste either one in the dish. Usually you can at least get a good curry flavor in that dish but not here. I started to pick out the onions but there were so many that it was easier just to pick out the chicken. Then I doused it with soy sauce to make it edible. Even then I could only eat about a third of the chicken because the onion flavor was so predominant I really couldn't stand it but I was so hungry I had no choice but to eat some of it. While I was waiting there was a table of diners that I saw put what looked like their whole entire meals into to go containers. Now I know why.,rxkkBnttILRjBPDqLg0UHQ,0,0,2,hU7Z641xmudj6cB8S8txSA

If she wasn't with me, I wouldn't know what the heck to do, not that I wouldn't have figured it out, the layout is just weird.

They have these really tall menus, usually 3 of them, side by side and go from the ceiling to the floor right when you walk in, take a look at what you want then you walk over to the cashier to pay, they hand you a number, pick a place to sit and they'll bring your food over to you. Drinks are self-serve and food is served on dishes and you use sileverware, not paper plates & plastic utensils. I felt like I was at PF Changs by the decor, food and staff but the process of ordering and serving felt like Panda Express.

I ordered the Lo Mein. I have no complaints. The noodles were cooked right, they include whole green onions rather than slicing them up. The size and amount of mushrooms was good, love those! The dish did the job but it wasn't over the top.

This location is BY FAR the worst in terms of speed of service and being on top of their game. I moved to Las Vegas back in October and this Pei Wei is very near my home. I like to order online and pick up my order on my way home. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt the first few times, but I am about fed up with this location. I'm wondering if their parent company's recent financial woes and restructuring have affected all of their stores. I did notice that they've done away with the plastic cups used for dine-in beverages and have gone exclusively to disposable paper cups.

My main ""beef"" with them is the fact that today I placed my online order at 5:33 and received a confirmation that my order would be ready by 5:55. My order is normally ready at other locations WELL before the promised-by time, however this location's sloppy staff just doesn't get it.

Today I received my order at 6:05, more than 30 minutes after placing my order. Some might say I am being way too picky, but it is all about pleasing the customer, and this location falls short of this consistently. The staff is ever changing (including management), so I'm not sure what the story is here.

The food quality is still good, however I noticed today I had no condiment bag with my order that usually contains sauces and fortune cookies. It looks like Pei Wei is cutting back, and that is not what I would expect from this chain.

I was hoping to order a Mongolian style beef but since their Mongolian sauce is not spicy as indicated, I tried the black pepper instead and unfortunately they only have ""steak"" not beef. And it was the lowest quality of steak I have ever had, no exaggeration, it was literally beef jerky chunks, and to top it off (literally) it was layed over soggy fried rice (due to the black pepper sauce).  I am shocked people like their meals on top of each other like that.  Even Panda Express separates their dishes.  The lo mein noodles really didn't differ from Panda express except that it had some veggies here and there and dumped a cup of sugar in it, and for $9 with bland ""crispy"" yet dry chicken I will say that it was another disappointment.

Considering I've been a regular at this joint,  most of the employees know me and they usually have an idea what I'm going to get. This makes it a biased review simply because my experience is going to be different than someone who checked in for the first time... 

Just so you know, if you walk in this restaurant expecting authentic Asian food, you're going to be disappointed. This is more like an ""Americanized"" version and a little more casual than PF Chang, which by the way is a sister company. 

One of my all time favorite is the chicken Phad Thai. For the price you pay, you get a very decent portion. Sometimes I even have left overs. It's a little spicy but you can tell them how spicy you want it if you're not into hot stuff. Everything is fresh and made to order. You can actually see the cooks prepare your food behind the bar type counter and decor. Some of the other house favorites is also something I would recommend. The  ""Pei Wei Spicy"", ""Honey Seared "" and "" Caramel Chicken"" are all savory dishes. Some of my friends enjoy the ""Mongolian"" but I personally find it too salty for my taste. Mind you, all the dishes are customized to your liking. You get to pick what protein and what type of rice or noodles you want. 

With all that said, Pei Wei is a very simple conceptual restaurant. It's very casual. I don't consider myself a food connoisseur... As long as I enjoy the experience and the food suits my taste, I'm all for it.",A872opA-l6OeCy9x1b2QFw,2,0,4,bHsltm_C_KhQJwpVBFyMuw

Here we go...

a.  The Good - Ok, if you are not used to eating the real authentic chinese food, then you will like this place. It is like an upscale Panda Express with healthy foods choices and a really nice and inviting eat in environment.

- Choices - I like that they have a lot of spicy choices, and you can order many of the items on the list with Chicken, Pork, Beef, or Tofu.

- Brown Rice - Awesome that they have brown rice and this also adds to the healthy 

- Fresh - Everything seems so fresh.  We Had:

- Honey Seared Chicken with Brown Rice
- Thai Wonton Sooup
- Thai Dynamite Chicken
- Spicy Korean Chicken

b.  The Really Good - Their drink and condiment section is totally cool. I don't know why I liked this so much, but it is clean, they have a great deal of choices for drinks, some teas, plenty of cut lemon and orange slices, Fortune Cookies, chili sauce and hot chinese mustard!  Oddly, I did not look for, and I don't remember if they have soy sauce, and this would actually get a way from the healthy aspect of the food.

c.  The Ambiance - As I said, upscale atmosphere for extremely casual people. You really feel that you are in a well taken care of and top notch cafe.

d.  The Bad - The only bad I found was that everything was a bit bland.  The Thai Wonton Soup was not very Thai style to me. The taste was a bit off and uninspiring.  The Spicy Korean Chicken had a heavy sauce that created all the taste and the chicken itself did not have any of the flavor. Kind of like dipping chicken in kitchen.  The sauce was the overpowering flavor and that is not great to me at all.

e.  Comeback - I will come back to give this place a second chance. While it is not what I consider really authentic, I will also challenge the healthiness of the food here as even though there is brown rice and some really great looking stuff, it seems that everything is 800-1200 calories and there are so many other better choices for quality food for the same caloric intake. 

GK says, not bad, and as long as you know this is totally just an asian influenced cuisine and not really authentic, then you will be very happy.

I give it a 3 star because of the blandness and the overpowering sauces and under performing soup...",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,1,0,3,SY5YfEtYZHD4pund7Ct9kA

I've lived in Vegas for 4 years and just recently found myself at Pei-Wei and I am seriously upset that I've been missing out all this time.  

Since moving here, my husband and I have struggled to find decent Chinese food and while this isn't exactly what we are looking for, it is delicious. As is PF Chang's for dinner (I know it is the same company).

The only thing that I haven't liked that I've tried is the wonton soup. It's too minty. I prefer the wonton at PF Chang's.

They have an extensive menu of appetizers and entree, and I like that you can pick your choice of meat for it. I picked ginger broccoli with shrimp, with brown rice on the side. 

Definitely like that they are made to order. The food was delicious, but I thought that the sauce, which was drenched on my plate, was a bit too salty for my liking. Perhaps next time I'll get the sauce on the side.

5075881,2012-03-05,0,DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg,"I find it strange that I never wrote a review for Pei Wei before. I had gone several times when I was in the area. Pei Wei is an intriguing place to me as it falls (as many have stated in other reviews) kind of in between Panda Express and PF Changs. I feel that the concept is there, however the execution could be better. They seem to be doing well though as they were pretty packed today (Sunday) for a late lunch.
The negative for me is portion size relative to price, especially for their dinner selects specials. We both ordered the specials which include a half portion of an entree and a side item. I chose the Honey Seared Chicken with white rice and my side was Won-Ton Soup. The soup was flavorful but was barely cup size and the entree was pretty good but left me plenty hungry. Worst part was they didn't include a drink so my $6.25 cent meal turned into an $8 meal that left me wanting more.
So, why the 4 stars?? Well, for one I appreciate the concept of this chain and I think they actually make some decent dishes. Seeing as how they are partnered up with PF Changs it makes sense. I wouldn't go as far as to say they are the poor-man's PF Changs, but they might be the middle-class man's PF Changs. The staff was friendly and our order came out right. 
In a perfect Yelp world, I would probably give them about 3.75 stars... but I'll bump them up to a 4 because I had a good day :)",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,1,0,4,c6VoWWgQGmxiCpxYNr3qhw

It also means less lines and wait time to be seated, and is cheaper than the full-on restaurant.

The food and service have been consistently good, and they have some sort of new reward card system (buy enough meals, get one free).  I was feeling a little playful today, so when the server handed me the card, I said ""This is the greatest moment of my life"", upon taking it, to which she just looked sort of confused at me, until I offered that I was just joking.  She still just stared curiously at me as she rang my meal up.  I didn't realize I had caused such a conversational faux paus.

Not sure if I was just really hungry or what but that visit made me realize how great and convenient Pei Wei is, especially since they have great selections of Chinese and Thai food that also include healthy options (a big bonus for me!). I really enjoyed the food and decided to give it another try today. For today's visit, I got the same thing as last time but felt like they put WAY too much sauce, so it was a bit too sweet for my liking.

The Mongolian bowl was much better- the sauce was good and there was plenty of chicken and mushrooms. I did get extra sauce on the side for both meals, because their entrees are always pretty much dry. Even the extra sauce portion wasn't even that much!!!!

If you're looking to have a quick bite of Chinese food that is not too pricey.. this place is great. Super friendly service and no need to wait a long time to get your food!",BlzKK3qINrANOC1KlzYQRA,0,0,4,GEdIUVtLdNPn_IKRqYyaiA

Pei Wei spicy and the Chopped Chicken Salad are our regular entrees. The salad is the one item that is not consistent, i.e. today the greens could be a lot fresher. A lot of wilted going on and the tomatoes were mushy.  But overall, we enjoy this restaurant .",_2rRSDaeAmn3v4YOaS1PLg,0,0,4,MNAyU7brESInMmtfCqytwg
