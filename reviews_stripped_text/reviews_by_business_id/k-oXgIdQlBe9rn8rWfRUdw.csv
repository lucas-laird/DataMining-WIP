The Owner/Manager, takes a lot of pride in what he serves. They add a little spice to the meat for the Philly Steak so if you like it bland you might want to have the cut back on the spices.  Don't let the location detour you from trying one of the best Cheese Steaks in Vegas. Cal-Ranch is next door so you can pick up your horse feed and enjoy a great Sandwich.

Days later I was checking my credit card statement and I saw that I was charged $31.36! I went to the restaurant and showed them that they over charged me. They pulled up my receipt and saw that i was correct and that the manager will call me once they figured out what happened. Couple of days later the ""manager"" called and said ""we only charged you $8.57, you'll have to call your credit card company and deal with them"".

Famous Philly makes good ones, but unless you go to Cal Ranch you're never going to happen upon their location- they're at the far end of a mostly deserted parking lot. Location is a little run down and most of their business is takeout.

Their cheese steaks are available in steak or chicken, and the chicken one was surprisingly decent. A regular is $8 but get two since it's just $11 and you'll have dinner for two or a huge dinner and lunch for the next day. Other menu items include burgers, gyros, chicken shawarma.

Went in about 3 weeks ago (against my better judgement.) The first ime I went in here, I received a dried out gyro. All the vegies were good but the meat tasted like it had been on the spit for 2 days.

The second time I ordered a gyro to go. Got home and found a plastic container full of lettuce with gyro meat piled on top.

So, I go back in about 3 weeks ago. There was a girl working the register. I said I would like a gyro with the pita and salad and fries. Oh, Okay she replied. paid $15.00 and change. Brought my order home, I had a Greek salad and fries. No gyro meat, no pita.

Drive there, park...go inside and 1 question, ""Are you guys also located in the NW part of the valley?""  The second I got a ""Yes"" then found out these guys are also the owners of this location, I decided to stay!

Absolutely no frills, they make no claim to being 'authentic' Philly steak either...but damn, they make some great food!  Greasy & friendly all at the same time!

Sometimes when you're hungry, you're HUNGRY.  This may not be gourmet, it may not be organic, Hell it may not even be healthy LOL but ooooohhhhh to these guys at Famous Philly Steak & Gyro know how to make something tasty!  We ordered:

-Philly Steak with Fries & Soda ($9.99)
-Gyro with Fries & Soda ($9.99)

Cooked fresh from the grill!  Philly steak had a ton of meat, mushrooms, onions & provolone cheese.  Full of flavor but not salty.  Thankfully bread was still on the fresh side, not crumbly at all.  Fries have some sort of seasoning on them that make em' delicious.  The gyro was good too, pretty sure it's a mixture of lamb/beef.  Not as good as the local Greek-owned eatery but it'll do.  The pita was warm & supple, veggies were fresh, and the sauce had some tang to it.  Good enough for a value lunch!

If you're in a pinch they do EAT24 delivery as well.  And they serve food for large parties too!  Pizzas, sandwiches and the like.

When I came in there was no one at the counter one lady came from the back and got a second I thought she was the cook the cashier and all in one person but she said oh no the cook is in the back when the cook came from the back I did not see him wash his hands and then he proceeded to make the food and touch the vegetables that I was to consume with his bare hands I explained how this made me uneasy because he was using his bare hands and I had not seen him wash his hands instead of washing his hands and offering to remake the food I was schooled on how their is no need to wear gloves because the heat will kill the germs the customer service clearly was great so I walked out of you come just make sure they wash their hands,-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,1,0,1,F5ec_DBJxB8YKrAE_kilBQ
