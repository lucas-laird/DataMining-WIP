But whats the point of good beer specials when you have to wait 20 minutes at the bar to either get a drink or close, out, so annoying....service from the one particular bar man is awful he seems more intent drinking with a couple of the regulars rather than actually doing his job and serving.",diDWrdyyhuiNTN7xPrM9jQ,0,0,2,yi1X3-MQOemQq30YR2adsw

Upon entering, I must say the place was extremely CLEAN. Might be one of the cleanest bars in town. 

The menu was nothing special. No steaks or chicken. Just burgers, appetizers & salads. 

Had the Chef Salad. The salad was fresh. had tons of tomatoes (which I was very happy about), but did not have any personality to it. Was just an average plate. 

Prices slightly higher than what I would like. $16 for a sampler platter for them seems a bit high. This isn't Claim Jumper. 

Service was decent. Not under-attentive or overly friendly. But it was not a weak point. 

Maybe if you want a place that is clean, well lit, & knock down some suds, this could be your spot. If you are seeking dinner, this is not the place.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,1,0,2,RdMzgbY0N4faQ8oEIxB_NA

The service was okay, but we had a brand new waitress and we were her first table that she waited.  I'd go back, but just probably wouldn't go out of my way.",ENZNKU6Xqt_kX1yFFb_H4g,0,0,3,LINqXYdOyZ33AholxFCyhQ

My friend and I went here for St. Patricks.  Huge mistake.  I know, I know, it's Irish-themed... why would you go to someplace Irish-themed on St. Patrick's Day.  Because it's Irish-themed!  

Apparently only two bartenders decided to show up.  The rest called in sick.  And one of the two bartenders working tried to regale us with the tale of how the rest of the staff called in sick instead of taking our order!  Finally, when he was done bitching, he asked what we wanted.  But, of course, they were out of almost every single kind of beer. (I guess the guy who orders the beer called in sick, too?) And instead of making a suggestion, he just walked off.  Needless to say, we left never to return.  There are so many better places in Las Vegas... this poker bar just needs to close down and become something remotely useful. Ok, rant over!",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,4,2,1,HkbWvxLzX6iixdDfhJkRjw

It has tables on the other side for people who want to be waited on...but we have not gone that route.  The bartender has been the same both times we have gone and he was always super nice to me...even willing to make shots of  ""something yummy"" for me when I wasn't sure of the flavor I was in the mood for at the time.  We felt like the service was good and the prices were normal, with some beer deals if you like what is on special.

2667897,2010-04-28,3,0JmCGyAqAK_yVEuZ0ts16w,"I guess your view of Bilbo's depends what you're looking for in a bar. This is by my parent's house, so I've stopped in a couple of times. I was out at Gordon Biersch on a Friday because I wanted to get drunk on beers and watch a baseball game, except it was slammed. And they weren't playing baseball on the TVs.

So I came here instead. There was a handful of people in there, maybe a dozen  - and the bartender greeted me like he knew me, served me a beer and then after checking on the other customers, went to play pool with the chef.

The one thing I would say is that it seems to be mostly guys. Not too many lesbians watching baseball in there and the other ladies were with their men. I wasn't uncomfortable, though one of the customers totally did describe me as a lesbo to his girlfriend from across the bar. Too bad that 'laid back' means it's quiet enough for me to hear that. Sigh.

Still, if you have a fantasy about having a 'Cheers' bar of your own, this could probably be that place for you if you come often enough.",BemKKkZBBmu9GupEwKBj9g,3,2,3,MKrtD_pWL_GYCoVG9XwEyw

On Sunday mornings with perhaps two other people in here, the waiter and bar tender spend more time watching whatever game is on TV than checking to see if you want to order a drink or food. When you do finally order, expect to wait until half time or the end of the game before you get what you asked for.

I also gave their ""Wall"" challenge a go as well, and made it a point to stop by after work three days in a row. Unfortunately, each day they couldn't find my card and I had to start over, by the third day I gave up and just never went back.",3okrWrDZxfMrF3_thV3Kmg,0,0,1,yPKV1ZG_c1uz3lf5i8wqZw

I wanted to love it, love local watering holes, but there was one bartender who was also waiting tables and that didn't work well for a Sunday afternoon.

Happy Hour menu is cheap. You definitely are getting what you pay for here, which isn't much. 

I didn't expect much from Bilbo's, but was disappointed nonetheless. 

Why? 
The service stunk. 
Really. 

We waited an adequate amount of time for my beer, which I spotted on the bar--yet the one server working didn't bring it to the table. My partner kindly fetched it for me. [I was thirsty.]  Worse, she didn't even notice that I had it in hand when she brought our tepid, poorly prepared food. Fail.

Advice: go to Bilbo's for drinks ONLY and sit at the bar. If you do anything else, its your own damn fault.",PEpBk6UQ67T2Vlp7-za61A,0,0,2,fHV5Y6VcAl0b5ihPtb-mEg

Knowing my dad's tastes, I figured we could get some decent bar food here. We were right. Had a salad and nachos. Salad was fresh, but very basic, and the nachos were standard pub nachos (cheese sauce and all). Unlike the other reviews, we found the service pretty good, but then we were the only people not sitting at the bar. We were also the only ones that were not regulars (or so we think). The review would be higher except the beer prices were outrageous. $5 for a pint of Smithwicks, and $4.75 for Sam Adams Summer Ale... yikes. 
Looks like it would be a good place for a game, lots of TV's and there happy hour (3-7pm M-F) may be worth it...",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,0,0,3,A-CVH-_hDaJIed2Qv15sPg

That's what I get for visiting my Vegas friends!
