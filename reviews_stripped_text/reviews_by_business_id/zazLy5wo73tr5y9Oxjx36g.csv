The bartender Joe was friendly and the surround sound sounded very good.  We ordered a pan pizza called the Al Capone, and it was very good, definitely fresh and hot, not Pizza Hut.  It was a little quiet when we got there but got busier as the night went on.",sZ2lbVIhDRM5ovTsch1jEQ,0,0,5,tOmvZxZB6_ADzm_M75n0dw

Place is always empty except for a handful of guys. Bartender is also the food runner. Staff always on cell phones texting. Takes forever to get food and service.,yZK3lcW64Vj3i0nRbFOAvQ,5,0,2,aPmxDKIpHmyQQDFAgMRNGA

I ordered off the 1/2 price menu and everything was super. I have told several people to come check this place out.

I have never met such friendly bar tenders in my life, my only gripe it gets expensive here because I have to tip so much. Also try the stuffed burgers they are excellent!",c0fvDzlXGXG-e7-IlBemJQ,0,0,5,2i7cs3fKPmIGX5_jIEswYA

We wanted to try out the new Bacon Bar from Bar Rescue, but couldn't get served, so we left and came to VIOLA'S.
What a great choice!!!!  Happy hour specials were awesome, Food was GREAT, and service was wonderful!  Both Stephanie and Marnie took very good care of us and both were awesome!!!!
We will definitely be back!!!!!!",iU180JImxkSNE7PearcX9w,2,0,5,jeac4hfQ9nMTeHRM8ICqmQ
2433810,2013-11-27,0,zazLy5wo73tr5y9Oxjx36g,"What a difference an engaged owner makes ! ! We just enjoyed a WONDERFUL afternoon at Violas and you can feel the difference. The place was pretty full and everybody was having fun. The owner was tending bar and engaging the customers without ""hovering"" over anybody. Just the right amount of attention. I'll tell you all, this place is the PLACE TO BE if you are looking to chill and enjoy yourself. The atmosphere is 180 degrees from where they were at opening. One happy winner even bought the house a round after winning a royal. I'm impressed at the change. Our food was excellent and served fast and correct (we split the lunch special and it came out in separate baskets, without having to ask ;~) ), the fries are steak style and awesome ! ! This is our ""neighborhood"" watering hole and we could not be more excited about the direction it's headed ! !  THANKS.....many THANKS ! !",ss-xkQPThqjp10XKGw_M8A,3,1,5,gkFn1cL43gmgjkUMAmzxFQ

Gave them a second chance to try pizza and was dissapointed. We live in 89108 and we have alot of great bars with fantastic service and food, this is not one of them. We go for lunch at least 3 times a week and are always willing to give a new place a try. Bummer for them. Every bar in 1 mile of that place is 100% better.",WjvFSpJuhPKrpmxRzxV1QQ,8,1,2,aCL3MZvReN2UUqzIiUqPXA
2515517,2013-05-11,0,zazLy5wo73tr5y9Oxjx36g,"I had a delicious take out pizza. Here's a suggestion if you like mushrooms and onions-have them on your pizza! Viola's sautes and carmelizes them first and then puts them on the pie-nice touch! I've had several meals and appetizers in house too-the Cowboy Burger and Artichoke Dip were very tasty and filling the wait staff has always been friendly and attentive.  The selection is great too-salads, pizza, burgers, sandwiches, salads and appetizers.",cTKtcuUXRU7NEFwLQ8eC8Q,0,0,5,yYspXZiYCdSPflC0Pwxk7A
3005375,2015-08-27,1,zazLy5wo73tr5y9Oxjx36g,I've been to Viola's 2 or 3 times. The bartender was very rude. He looked drunk. Maybe he doesn't like the graveyard shift. Good luck Viola's. There are plenty of other bars that appreciate there clientele. I won't waist my time and money again. Oh the bartender was Jeff.,2sw2uyK42FkUNrhDJRp3RQ,2,0,1,ayzCi4eeogeBC9zcxES5Ug

I saw decent reviews and was nearby so gave it a shot. Maybe was an off night, but didn't turn out well. Initially saw they had good food reviews. Kitchen was closed, alcohol selection was limited.

5765430,2014-07-20,1,zazLy5wo73tr5y9Oxjx36g,Don't waste your time or money.  I have been here for 30 minutes and have not been greeted by a server. After 10 I went to the bar where she smiled at me and walked away. The bartender ignored me. A man came from the other side of the bar (he looked like an owner maybe) and he asked me what I wanted.  There were no greetings from anyone. Not a friendly place. I came to show support for my buddy and his band. But I will never come back here. And I haven't even tried their food -- I have no waitress.  Apparently you get friendly service if they know you.  Well guess what... They aren't gonna get to know me after this lousy visit.,DHwKz0OuGUuvSpbAilTVrw,6,0,1,PpY9DwkPyqI13xzw3cYsHQ
5921165,2014-04-02,0,zazLy5wo73tr5y9Oxjx36g,"Quite honestly, not sure if I just encountered Viola's on an off night or if the service is generally incredibly slow & inattentive. My friends & I sat down to eat around 8:30, and we waited patiently... Which, frankly, didn't turn out to be a virtue. We were cheerily chatting away for about 15 minutes when one if my friends noticed we hadn't been approached with menus or drinks. Hm. OK? So, we literally found menus that were lying around, as we couldn't find any wait staff apart from the bar tender. After figuring out what we wanted, we approached the bar tender, who was really an awesome guy, and ordered. He put our order in promptly and proceeded to do his job, which shouldn't have been taking food orders, anyway. Another 15 minutes passed, and we were approached by, lo and behold, a waitress! She informed us that they were out of one of the food items we ordered. OK... So we change the order. Another 15 minutes pass and we finally receive our food... Which was decent; not out of this world, but good. Unfortunately, 2 of the orders weren't correct... We decided to just eat, because we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for food. So, frankly, I KNOW there are thousands of other places in Vegas to get the same kind of faire at an equal price... As I stated, I concede that it MIGHT have been an off night, but I can't think of a time I have ever waited that long for food in a place with multiple open tables. Plusses include the humorous bar tender & decent food. But, let's be real, only a handful of places really merit a wait that long.",8ihwqM7sUXmrNBE-HdLOgQ,6,0,2,s60s_8nWrb6xzxVJMWsAUw
