115170,2012-01-03,0,n1Ng1q300iLHYZELtOd5FA,"I hate to lower my rating for a restaurant that was perfect on my first visit. Unfortunately, BOA failed to live up to expectations after a flawless first meal.

When I went back last week the service was extremely slow. After being seated I waited over five minutes just for someone to bring a menu. After that it took another ten before any water was brought over. The staff was very friendly extremely inattentive. The service is the biggest reason for me lowering my review.

That being said, I had an issue with the food as well. I ordered the Kobe Ribeye, not an inexpensive cut of meat. I've had the same steak at BOA before and it was amazing. This time however it was far from perfect. It was seasoned well, but the meat itself was tough. Looking back I should have said something, but I don't like doing that. This was a $100 steak that was extremely hard to cut with a steak knife. I don't know about most diners, but to me that's unacceptable. When I'm paying that much for a steak I expect it to not just taste amazing but have great texture as well - it did not.

I was extremely happy with my appetizer, I had the smoked salmon and it was amazing. I expected the rest of the meal to follow suit, unfortunately with the service and entree BOA fell flat on its face.

I would like to clarify, everyone gets a bad steak every once in a while. If it had only been the steak that was a problem I wouldn't have followed up my previous review. The fact that the service was poor as well is what did it for me. I'm really disappointed with this place because my first experience was so amazing. I wish that they kept to those standards for every visit.

As an ending note. At one point I waited 15 minutes for a water refill, this was while the staff filled the glasses of the three table surrounding mine. At a restaurant that costs as much as BOA that is ridiculous.",r3mYUwiEe9fD6ZpHcfYK4g,0,0,3,khq1gulh-tkROuo0hrEZDg

We got seated promptly near the patio.  It was February and it was too cold to eat in the patio even if it had a better view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  Their service was very good.  We ordered steaks, salmon on planks and for me the spoiled bday girl that I was got the large lobster.  Our server even took my lobster out of the shell for me and was constantly ensuring that everything was okay at our table.  My cousin's bf was trippin everytime his napkin was getting folded whenever he got up to check out the views or go to the restroom.  I even recall one of their employees rushing to get to the door to open the restroom door for me.  Wow.

The view from the balcony is amazing the the ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner or a classy dinner for a bachelors party which is what we had.  

As for the food, the calamari was awesome and everyone agreed it was one of the best we'd ever had.  They also gave us some complimentary appetizer which had cheese and tomatoes on lays potato chips which were delicious!

Most of us ended up ordering the 40 day old steak.  I've had much better steak for half the price.  Wasn't impressed at all to be honest.  Overall, I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn't for the steak.  I would definitely go back though!",I22QueJ7v1WQu9LAmjeXlg,0,0,4,_EGvlrDdWHRw8xYxbAZenQ

They melt in your mouth. Also, the truffle oil macaroni and cheese was to die for. The tableside  ceasar was spicy! Not sure why, but it was still cool to have someone come to your table and make everything by scratch in front of you. Definitely recommend the goat cheese and truffle oil bak lava.

I was pretty intoxicated when I got there so everything on the menu sounded great. I ordered the $45 Porterhouse. I've lost so much at this point, $45 sounded like a good deal. The steak was nicely cooked but once again, it didn't really wow me. What did make me say ""wow"" was their 2 signature drinks. I do not recall what they were called but one was made with fresh strawberries, vodka (I believe), balsamic vinegar ( 
yes! vinegar!), and crushed peppers to top it off. To my amazement, it tasted like candy. The other drink was a rum based drink with pineapple and some other ingredients i cannot recall. Just ask about the 2 signature drinks and they'll tell you. I'll definitely go back for the drinks. As for the steak, I think I'll pass on a $45 Porterhouse next time.

Hmm..torn. 

We dined recently at this steakhouse located on the top floor of Caesar's Palace newest shopping area. It has an absolutely excellent view of the strip, you can even see the water show at Bellagio from the patio. It is a bit down there, but still. 

As far as the service goes, this has to be staffed with some of the most pleasant, professional people I have ever encountered. Too often, the attitude in retail and hospitality is really awful, but in this case, everyone was beyond. 

Our server was Michael C. or E. ( I wish I could remember) and he was helpful, nice and zero weird attitude...yay!

My pre-dinner cocktail was the Crush and it was very delicious, sparkling and slightly sweet. 

For dinner, my boyfriend started with clam chowder and it was delicious, more of a rich white broth with little bits of clam, than a heavy, creamy typical chowder. Very good. I started with a salad, which was, fresh, crisp and tasty.

We both ordered petite filet medallions and it was the perfect amount of food. It came with a blackberry reduction sauce, but we also ordered a side of the J-1 Sauce to try. Both great, but I think I did prefer the sauce the filet came with afterall.

Dessert came and we shared a creme brulee and the chocolate filled beignets. YUM. I love sugar a bit too much and these were no disappointment. The creme brulee is excellent, it is incredibly rich, creamy and served on the chilled side. Thank you! I really do not like warm, eggy brulee's which are more commonly served. 

If you are a person who loves the creme brulee at Nordstrom Cafe, then you would love it here too. 

After our dinner, we sat on the patio outside and waited for the 4th of July fireworks to start, but unfortunately weren't able to see any, so headed home and instead saw them shooting off from various neighborhoods along the 95.

913695,2011-01-28,0,n1Ng1q300iLHYZELtOd5FA,"I had the center cut ahi tuna with wasabi mashed potatoes, bok choy and shitake mushrooms. It was the best seared tuna I've ever had, hands down. The tuna was cooked perfectly, was cut properly and just melted in my mouth. The sauce was a salty, dark, wine-based masterpiece. The mashed potatoes had the subtle hint of wasabi, but it was not overpowering.  The mushrooms added some great texture and flavor. The bok choy was the weakest part of this dish I think- it was a little too mushy for my taste. Overall, I still loved this dish. Also, as a side note, the bread that they serve is fantastic. They have these rosemary rolls that were fresh out of the oven, hot and tasty. The butter there is also crazy. It tasted just like normal butter, but the texture was somewhere between whipped and liquid- almost like sour cream. I think the point was to make it easy to spread. It was a nice little luxury.

I'm not sure about the steak, as I didn't have any, but I did have a bite of the lobster one of my friends ordered from the surf and turf, and the lobster was amazing. My dish was $40, not bad for the best tuna ever. The surf and turf ended up being $150, which I wouldn't have paid if I'd known it was going to be that much. I would have paid 100 for it though. That lobster was good. 

The atmosphere was nice, a little dark for my taste, but that's how most steak houses are. It wasn't too hard to get a reservation on Saturday night, and the place was on the noisier end, but not enough for you to really notice. The waiting staff was quick and they were very on top of their water and bread refills. They give out these funny super sparkler candles stuck in a container full of sugar crystals for your birthday. They're pretty entertaining for the 10 seconds they burn. 

I would definitely come to this place again. I'd probably give this place 4.5 stars if I could. I'm just holding out on that 5 star rating because I don't know what the steak was like. This is a steakhouse, after all. If I go again and have the steak, I'll update this post.",DVkB2PaKLn2u3fixcDGb6Q,1,0,4,4qldPGvK2F2dvA67GtVq4w

We had trouble choosing a place before we went out to Vegas but I came across a Groupon for BOA about a month before we left.  So I bought it and made reservations for 8pm on a Friday night via opentable.com.  

It took us a little while to find it because we weren't staying in Caesars and that place is a bit of a maze.  I also have to take part of the blame because I was wearing heels so I couldn't walk as fast :)

I had read reviews on trip advisor to ask for a table on the terrace.  That was an excellent tip!  I asked the hostess and she accomodated us with no problem.  We were seated pretty much immediately and had a fantastic view of the Strip on a gorgeous October evening.  The ambiance played a big role in how much we enjoyed our experience.

I really wish I could remember our waiters' names.  They were phenomenal.  All of their suggestions knocked it out of the park.  We started with drinks, a BOA 405 for me and a local beer for my husband.  Both drinks were delicious.  We skipped appetizers because we wanted to indulge on side items.  

My husband ordered the 40 day dry aged NY Strip and I had the petit filet with creamy horseradish sauce.  For our sides we ordered the truffle mac and cheese, sauteed seasonal mushrooms and chipotle lime corn (at the suggestion of our watier).  All of our food was delicous.  I cannot rave about the chipotle lime corn enough.  It was something I would never have ordered myself but it blew me away.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly and we enjoyed everything, except the truffle mac and cheese.  But that's not due to the restaurant.  I just don't like truffle oil.

All in all it was a wonderful experience and I'd recommend it and hope to return there on my next visit to Las Vegas.",n5jbfcZt1N7SR-nSbt24gA,0,0,5,UK5rVGcA92Hz-k4PNZ39yg

It was crispy on the outside, tender inside with a nice sauce that complimented it well. My bf got the prime filet medallions and while it wasn't bad, its not something I'd recommend. My pan seared Salmon however was delicious! Same as the crab cake,the seared crust was just so good. And the sides of whipped potatoes and snap pea risotto were okay. While our waiter was super friendly and attentive, the main course took a long while to come out. So we took our desserts to enjoy at home. The cheesecake was good but could use a little more graham crust. Chocolate donut holes were absolutely yummy!!!!

The good:

The soup of the day was a broccoli-crabmeat soup, which tasted more like broccoli cheddar, and was very good. It was a little thin, as it appeared almost to be puree'd (sp?), but tasted great.

For an entree, I got the filet, and my wife ordered the Kobe flat-iron steak. The one snafu of the night was when they brought a filet for my wife. We informed the waiter of the mix-up, and he was very apologetic and went to correct the mistake. Amazingly enough, within 5 minutes, a the correct entree came out, cooked to perfection. 

The service was very good, and the food was wonderful. The other thing dragging down the rating would be the dessert: We were so stuffed, but decided to split a dessert - the smores dessert. It was a brownie with some sort of marshmallow topping. Unfortunately, the brownie almost tasted store-bought, and the marshmallow topping was very bland. On top of that, it came out room temperature. All in all, it wasn't a BAD dessert - just disappointing for a place of this caliber.

We explored the whole menu, ordering a variety of steaks, sides, and seafood.  The oysters were very fresh, and served at the right temperature.  The sides were fine, but the real red flag went up when we got our steaks.

All of our steaks came out desert dry, regardless of how they were cooked.  This was most likely due to not letting the meat rest after it was taken off the grill.  This is a total rookie move, and a mortal sin for any self-respecting chef.

It was late on a Saturday night in Vegas.  We were hungry and spent way too much time in the car to get to Caesar's from Orleans.  To our pleasant surprise BOA was still serving.

We were seated promptly and were delighted to put in our food order.  I had the rib eye - medium rare.  Cooked to perfection!

The rib eye was buttery and melted in my mouth.  Since there were about 7 of us, I got to sample many of the sides.  We had the asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, creamed spinach, garlic mashed potatoes and the gratin.  All very good.

I took my time eating my steak...it was that good!  The topper was the perfectly roasted garlic bulb that accompanied my steak.  SHEER AWESOMENESS!

You might feel the weather though as I was sweating during the summer and near freezing in October.

Now on to the important part, the food.
I have tasted most of the appetizers and my favorites seem to be the crab cakes and fried calamari. I enjoyed my lobster bisque and tuna carpaccio. 

My first time eating there, I order the surf and turf special. The dish was good, but my beef did feel a little more tougher then I thought it would be. It did however, pack a lot of flavor. 

The second time around was the porterhouse. Let me tell you, this thing is huge. It comes with roasted garlic to spread on the beef and is just so tender and juicy. I would recommend this dish to anybody who is going to try this place out.

Our reservations were on Saturday at 7pm but we had landed in Vegas that same day and got stuck standing in line buying show tickets. We had to call twice to let the hostess know we were gonna be late. We finally arrived 30 minutes late but they were nice and seated us immediately. 
The bf ordered the bone-in ribeye medium rare, $45 with their peppercorn sauce on the side. 
I surfed and turfed it, ordering their petite filet mignon medium plus, $39 with their signature J-1 sauce on the side and alaskan king crab legs, mkt price. The sides we ordered was their sauteed seasonal mushrooms, $9 and smoked cheddar bacon mashed potatoes $8. 
The food was quite awesome. The bf said his ribeye was very good, but not comparable to Pappa's Bros. 
My petite filet mignon was juicy, tender and cooked just perfectly. I usually don't like sauce with my steak but their signature J-1 was very yummy and complimented the steak's flavor perfectly. 
The sides were also very good. The cheddar bacon mashed potatoes were recommended by our server, and a very good choice. Bacon is my fave and this had chunks of it. The sauteed mushrooms were good but nothing special about them. 
We had decided to skip on dessert because we had a show to catch at 9:30pm but our server was so sweet she brought out their vanilla creme brulee and lit a sparkler for my b-day!! It was awesome. I had always wanted a sparkler for my birthday but never knew where to find them so it was extra special to me. The creme brulee was okay but we've had better. (I love Pappa's Bros. and Grand Lux) All in all, dinner was great. The servers were very attentive, asking us if we had any questions about the menu and making suggestions. Our plates were cleared quickly and drinks refilled promptly. To top it off it was nice they made note that the reservation was for a birthday and treated us to the complimentary dessert.

Overall the dinner was amazing, the dimmed lights all around were nice too.Towards the end spent about $315 with 4 people not including a few free deserts the chef gave us, so we tipped him $85.",ouL5bc8IBVitg6fU3BpwZg,1,1,5,pfgrY2dteLfKvtoSYpt3dQ

I gave BOA in Santa Monica 3 stars too because they couldn't cook the meat right, their Wagyu steak was too dry and their sides were too salty but their ambiance is great.

BOA Steakhouse in Caesar's palace was a complete opposite.  The ambiance was horrible, seating was uncomfortable and the lighting was too strong it nearly blinded us.  Service was pretty laid back for a steakhouse... which I don't mind... but a little more attention wouldn't hurt....

But the steaks were cooked PERFECTLY.  It was tasty and juicy... mMmMmMmmm... I ordered a medium rare and the steak was perfectly medium rare from the tip to the middle to the end.  Polish up the interior and with better service, this restaurant could potentially be 5 stars.

I kept running out of my iced tea (super easy to refill) for 6-7 minutes at a time, my starter salad took 20 minutes to come out, and I must say the chair backs were extremely uncomfortable; and it wasn't just me I noticed the lady at the table next to me rubbing her back as well. Now after the salad arrived I'm happy to say everything picked up dramatically. The salad I chose was the BOA BLT with bacon flavored dressing and it was amazing, and so was the bread that came with it, a perfect 10 combo. Followed by the fillet medallions which were spot in as well, they were perfectly cooked and well flavored with delicious mashed potatoes.

In summary: Aside from the slow service at first and the uncomfortable wooden backed chairs, I'd highly recommend BOA Steakhouse. The salad, sides, and fillet were excellent. and I look forward to trying their full steak menu for dinner!",3K8tL7yCj8rXoPu_PR3qcg,0,0,4,RSvHsvqZ3L0B8SEhyWsMjg

So why the 3 stars?  Personally I thought the steak (NY Strip) was only okay and for a $44 steak I was expecting a little more.  My cousin got the lamb chop which he found to be extremely good (though he thought the Wynn buffet lamb chops were a better value).  The bacon and cheddar mash potato was very, very satisfying.

I started with the Caesar salad, which they make table side, and it was excellent. 

My main course was the petite filet mignon with blue cheese and Cabernet sauce -- one of the best steaks I've ever had. 

The truffle mac and cheese was outstanding -- I was sharing with friends, but I could have eaten the whole bowl myself. The bacon and cheddar mashed potatoes were also very good.  

For dessert, I had the chocolate chip cookies served with vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was good -- it had a really nice texture. The cookies looked and tasted like slice and bake.

     What can I say? I was in Vegas for New Year's and on NYE (New Year's Eve) a friend called around and got our party a table there. Boa originally set a 6 course prix-fixe dinner for $150+ per person (I can't remember exactly but it was somewhere around there), but luckily he convince them to let our party dine there. The only requirement was that each member of our party had to spend at least $50, which was not difficult at a place like Boa. 
     To make things a little easier on our waiter our party of 12 people asked for 3 separate checks. My boyfriend and I ended up ordering a Porterhouse steak $45 and Lobster (MP - Market Price=$99) and a side order of asparagus $9 because all entrees are a la carte. When the host first seated our party, the waiter brought a round of complimentary shots for everyone. It was a shot of their famous drink ""405"" and a raspberry one which was less memorable. 
     I can't remember what time we had arrived at the restaurant, but our food arrived shortly before the big countdown to the New Year. The steak and lobster looked deceptively delicious on a porcelain plate, but I asked the waiter to keep the food warm while we went to the 2nd floor balcony for the countdown. It was a chilly evening in Vegas with a huge crowd on the streets. Boa supplied the guest with a champagne toast at 12. As everyone kissed and cheered in the cold, the fireworks were going off in the background at Rio and all I can think of is the food. After all that we went back inside to our hot food waiting for us to devour it. The Porterhouse steak was cooked to perfection (Medium) and the portion was big. The lobster was delicious as well, I didn't expect it to be as big as it was. My boyfriend and I are pretty big eaters and once we finished our food we were full, but of course I still wanted to indulge in their dessert. The only dessert available that evening was the Opera cake $16 on their prix-fixe menu. I must say it was definitely not worth the $16. The presentation was breathtaking, but once I cut into the cake and had a bite- I was not impressed. I would not order the Opera cake again.

I like to be consistent, not only because I order what I like, but it helps me to compare places fairly.  I got my usual Tanq gimlet and some drinks for my friends, and was wondering why it was taking a bit longer than usual seeing as we were the only ones at the bar.  I still dont know why, but when I got my drink, it was THE BEST, BY FAR gimlet I have ever had.  I couldnt stop talking about it or thinking about it (lush?).  Whatever they added or did, it was more balanced and sweeter.

When we were sat the real fun continued.  I ordered the NY since its what I always get and it happened to also be the most expensive item (46), along with a side of asparagus.  The bread they brought out for us while they prepared our entrees was good, typical nice restaurant good.  

Then the entrees came...

If you took an audio-only recording of our table, it could easily be mistaken for a 5 person porno.  We were all very impressed!  I ordered my steak MR and it was perfect.  The steak wasnt overly dressed, they let to quality of the meat do the most talking.  The asparagus was soft while still retaining the nice crispness you'd expect.  By the end of it, not only did we have a great steak, but we were full!!  I had abandoned the asparagus to ensure that I finished the steak even.

Even though it took me a long time to decide on it because I couldn't justify paying $$$ for steak I'm was really satisfied with it.  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was just so flavorful.  We had also started off with the Chop Chop salad which they split into two plates for us and had Truffled Mac and Cheese and Bacon Cheddar Mash as sides.  The hubby got the ribeye as his steak but I gave him half of my Kobe too so he was stuffed... but content :)  The service was wonderful.

That night's off the menu appetizer were escargot and French onion soup.  We tried the escargot.  The dish came with toasted bread and it was very good.  

We ordered the bone-in ribeye, petite filet, and bone-in filet.  All came out perfectly cooked, but we expected nothing less from a fine establishment such as BOA.  I really like the side dishes-the chipotle lime corn was fantastic with just the right amount of heat and tartness. Asparagus dish was grilled nicely, not overcooked and dried out like some restaurants. The mac-n-cheese with truffle oil was excellent-much better than the one at CUT.  We also ordered the fries, but the ones at Stripsteak were by far better than these.

The wait staff was very experienced.  They were courteous, prompt, and polite, couldn't ask for more.

Don't know how anyone can come here and not get a STEAK.. it is a ""Steakhouse"".... burgers? Bah! If you come here don't waste time with the other details, you go to a steakhouse you get a steak, mine was the 40 day aged New York Strip, $44 (not bad) and it was perfectly cooked, I asked ""rare with no sauce or rubs"" - perfect. With the cream of asparagus soup with lobster for starters and a side of Truffle Mac and Cheese made this the perfect meal for the night. Also, if there's room, ask to be seated on the patio which overlooks the strip ;)

The service was very good, though between getting our drinks and ordering he did dissappear for a while, but after that he was all over our table like white on rice.  

They also have a very extensive wine list from all regions and a decent selection of hard liquors, but it's vegas where doesn't?

After this I went to Casa Fuente for a cigar with some buddies. Anymore manly than that? A steak and a cigar.

So take it from me, if you're going to Vegas, you're going to spend money on food, don't go low and get a burger, order a steak and a red wine, if you want a burger go to ""The Plaza Diner"" and order the Big Daddy Barrick Burger ( 9.5 lbs. of burger ).... http://eatfeats.com/calendar/LasVegas.html ...

All the staff I came into contact were professional and quite hospitable.  

My server allowed me to choose seating inside the restaurant & suggested facing the mall for a good view.  

The sommelier was sharp w/wine & threw in a FREE wine flight.  I was loaded: 3 EXTRA 2 oz glasses of wines to sample, all fantastic.  One from the Willamette Valley-currently my favorite region.

Boa bread is normally baked in house at the Southern CA locations.  In LV, they bake their own rosemary rolls, reminiscent of the texture of a biscuit, but fluffier & nicely scented.  I couldn't finish the whole roll and packed it away for later.

I was given the option of ordering from the dinner menu also.  My server was unsure if the Steak Tartare was available and I let him know I would be more than happy to replace that item with a petite filet.  He could have easily told me the lower priced item was unavailable, and garnered a larger tip with the bigger ticket item, but he didn't.

As I said, we returned for lunch so the restaurant was far less full and the menu a bit more limited.  You have a choice of several appetizers, soup of the day, about five salads, a burger, a few sandwiches, and a smaller list of entrees.   

We sat in the front so that we could people watch, which is always fun... and the staff was great... really down to earth, quick on the draw with the cocktails and very fast to remove the charge for a mistake on the order and comp us a round of drinks.  

We ordered the beef tartare (we thought we ordered tuna but that was a mistake), goat cheese baklava, prawn cocktail and the BLT salad to share.   The staff was very helpful in deciding how much would be enough for 3 girls to share but not spoil their dinner later. 

I thought the beef tartare left a lot to be desired.  I am usually a fan of the dish and the presentation was pretty (they cracked the egg and mixed it tableside) but I just didn't care for the texture (the meat was not very finely ground) or the flavor (a bit bland).

I was a fan of the prawns last time but this time around they seemed a bit dried out.  Might skip that next time.

The goat cheese baklava is a new favorite.  All three of us thought this was a real standout.   The combination of textures and flavors was wonderful..  from the paper thin phyllo and the creamy, tangy cheese, to the drizzle of honey and sprinkle of pistacios, right down to the bit of frisee salad with candied orange peel.  Would definitely like to have this again... and I ain't sharin'.  ;-)

The salad was also very good.  I can't say that it's more exciting than anything else I've had but I think it's great light lunch fare to grab a salad and the baklava and call it a day.

Started with drinks at the bar, I think they're might have been a drop or two of cranberry juice the rest was pure Belvedere bliss!! After just one drink, it felt like I was floating to our very private, romantic window booth that overlooked the strip. Our waiter was fabulous and very helpful. We asked about the Kobe flat iron simply because we didn't know what it was and it was the only inexpensive cut on the menu. He explained it and we both knew it was not what we wanted. We went the filet mingon-you can't go wrong with the filet. And if your going to spend the money, you might as well spend ALL the money!! 

Everything is a la carte so when you order your cut that's all you get. We each ordered a side; truffle macaroni & cheese and butternut squash. Ok, the filet was delicious. Every bite melted in your mouth. We didn't order any of the rubs or sauces they offer-we just wanted pure beef in all it's glory. The filets were prepared to perfection. But I know it won't be the last perfect filet I eat so let's get back to those sides. The butternut squash was delicious. Tender, sweet with an ever so slight kick to it. Great veggie choice. The truffle mac & cheese was out of this world. To die for. The most amazing mac & cheese I've ever had or ever will have. It was rich and creamy. The truffles gave it the most unbelievable and luxurious flavor. Yes!! It was pure luxury. If mac & cheese were cars,  a box of kraft would be a moped from the late 70's and BOA's truffle mac & cheese is a Bugatti. 

Dessert did not disappoint. We ordered the special dessert-it may have been a Valentines special since we were there Valentines weekend. It was warm sugared doughnut holes with a Godiva heart in the middle served with warm caramel & vanilla sauces to dip these warm, doughy, sugary pieces of heaven into. It was so delish and the most perfect ending to a most perfect dinner. 

So the price of this dinner for just the two us-which was 2 drinks, 2 filets, 2 sides, 1 dessert + tip was just about $200. Yes, looking back that seems extreme, but that night and in that moment, it was worth every single penny. Everyone deserves a dinner like this, at least once a year.",qiA5QI85-A2WB5lKRlyCIQ,4,2,5,GzABNeazJT9rJTuEuCqCqw

They have a great view of the strip and giant, comfortable booths.  The drinks were made perfectly and the service was excellent.

The steak, of course, is the main attraction, and BOA did not dissapoint.  I had the New York Strip with a peppercorn dry rub cooked medium rare.  It had to be one of the best steaks I have ever had.  My girlfriend had a Filet Mignon that was also delicious and cooked perfectly.  Our sides, wasabi mashed potatoes and an order of mushrooms, were also excellent.

This is yet another steakhouse transplanted from a tiny original version situated on Sunset Blvd at the Grafton Hotel. This restaurant in LA is such a hot spot, well it used to be anyway. 
The decor of the LA store is super fab, intimate, and dark. BOA in Las Vegas attempts to capture the LA store but it is far larger and more open. I do like the food here though. Steaks come out hot in skillets almost and they can be carved for you table side. Sides are inventive, as many new steakhouses are now days. I will say, the view here is cool, and they have a fun patio that looks out to the strip. 
The place is really far out of the way, I would recommend valet parking at the forum shops from the strip entrance and going up the elevator, but the walk out to the casino is for real fifteen minutes, don't wear your jimmy choo's.",ko06Ptkr1YtZWR6FIDqubA,0,0,4,kNn2XMeFYAUlaFqZdx9-aw

The ""nachos"" are actually fried potato chips with melted Gruyere cheese and truffles on top, but it was excellent. Who would've thought that I'd also be raving about their dinner rolls! They are served hot and are light and fluffy...almost like a biscuit. Oh man was it good. The star of the show was their special for the night: filet mignon with a pile of crab and lobster meat on top with a barnaise sauce. The beef and crab/lobster combo was excellent, although the seafood was a little on the rich side. The sides that were ordered (cheddar and bacon mashed potatoes and grilled broccoli) were good, but it didn't blow me away. I couldn't even taste the cheese in the mashed potatoes.

Also, you can't come here without trying one of their delicious cocktails (I had one with a rum created by the restaurant)- so yummy!

Don't come here before a night out on the town...you want to eat a lot of the rich, delicious food they serve without the pressure of having said food bouncing around inside you on your way to a club...that could lead to a bad night, and consequently a bad review for BOA on yelp.

They put all the herbs and spices into a bowl, make the dressing a presto.....fresh salad.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because although it was delicious (especially the donut holes for dessert)  i feel when you are paying $50 for a steak it should come out perfect everytime.  The steak they served me was tasty, but had more fat on it then real meat.  The most fatty steak I've ever had.  Granted it was a ribeye....but, you could clearly see how fatty it was.

2410991,2010-10-17,0,n1Ng1q300iLHYZELtOd5FA,"I walked up at 8pm on a Saturday night and asked for a table for 2.  I was seated right away.  Sherman was the captain for that night.  He was great.  I ordered 2 bone in fillets, mac n cheese, mushrooms, creamed spinach, baked potato, 2 glasses of wine, and panna cotta for dessert.  He told us about the locations in LA because my mom was visiting me from out of town and lived there.  After learning about those locations, he gave us his card and told us who to ask for at the other locations and assured us that we would be taken care of there as well.  

I admit I should have ordered a bottle, but my mom quits on me after a glass then I'm stuck trying to drink thing and drive home after drinking 3 glasses.  I'm not a very big girl, so that is a lot of alcohol.  Anyway, my glasses came out, they were great.  While the wine list was good, I believe that other restaurants such as Delmonico have better lists.  What was great was Sherman put in for us to have truffle oil nachos to go with the wine.  Great pairing!  The nachos almost stole the show from the steak.  They were great!  

Next was the bread...  That has to be one of my favorite rolls and butter in a restaurant bar none.  After that was the steaks and sides.  The steaks were great.  Now was it the best bone in fillet I've had? No.  Was it the best steak in LA, such as the staff told me? No.  But was it in the top 5? Yes!  Places that beat it for me by a long shot are Mastro's and Cut.  Don't get me wrong, this is one great cut of meat, but there are better out there.  

As for the sides, they are alright.  Truffle oil mac n cheese-- It was good.  Will it replace a craving for the mac n cheese at Mastro's? No.  Creamed spinach-- It was okay.  Again, there is better at Delmonico and Morton's and Porterhouse Bistro and STK and The Palms and... honestly, just about every other steakhouse I've been at.  Mushrooms-- There were the standout and gone first at the table.  Baked potato--  I only had a taste, as this is more of a dish my mom loves, but I did like the fact that it came with everything including cheese.  Then again, I love just about anything with cheese and potatoes.

My dessert was great... I was given 2 spoons with the panna cotta.  It also came with roasted pears, which was tricky with a spoon.  I finally gave up and just had cream.  My espresso was better than what I've had at most restaurants by far.  And they did not bring out sugar with it.  I've always found that to be peculiar when they bring out sugar.  Who puts sugar in their espresso?  That's another rant for another day... as is the snobby valet guy who would not valet my car until I said I was eating at Boa.  Then he opened my door and said, ""Welcome to Forum Shops.""... Yeah, thanks, jerk.

All in all, Boa serves great cuts of meat with great service for that style.  Most of the sides leave something to be desired, but I never had to ask for anything twice.  Sherman is a great captain at this restaurant.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,0,1,4,r9EVh904QtCU2Bk4M3I2oA

We finally decided on this steakhouse after a brief conversation with the very friendly hostess who reassured us that our transient like appearance would not be mocked by any of the staff and we would still be served the same quality pieces of meat as more suitably dressed guests. We had to wait for the females so first stop was the bar. 
The bartender was quite friendly and knowledgeable about mixed drinks and their wine selection. Despite knowing that Boa is well known for their locally created mixed drinks we opted for a bottle of Malbec from their extensive list. When the femaliens finished their shopping expedition, we were immediately seated in their impressive dining room. 
We were seated in an impressive booth with a decent view of the strip for half of our group...the rest of the group got to look at us looking at the strip. We each ordered a side and decided to share all of them as they all seemed to sound good. Circling the table was: 
Garlic mashed taters 
Balsamic string beans with toasted pine nuts 
Lyonnaise potatos 
Macaroni and cheese 
The sides were quite fantastic, the best of all being the mac and cheese and the mashed potatos. Mac and cheese were made with a shell shaped pasta that was perfectly cooked and very thick and doughy...wonderful. 

As for the steak, I had a bone-in ribeye ordered medium well. It was cooked perfectly and came with a very good peppercorn sauce. Other items that were ordered at our table were the 40day aged New York and the Boa Burger all of which received rave reviews. 

Service at Boa was impeccable, our waiter seemed to come by at the perfect time, every time and did not have to be asked for anything really. He just knew what we needed a minute before asking for it. I could not have asked for more.

And so that we did.  We had reservations at 6:30 PM but our breakfast of left over galbi, bulgogi and other Park's Korean BBQ delights couldn't hold us over 'til then, so we made our way over around 6.  I was worried that they couldn't seat us because we were there before our reservation time. . .and the worst part about arriving early to a restaurant while you're ravenous is watching everyone else around you eat.  

There was nobody there.  By this point I was nervous.  I've had bad experiences with Los Angeles's Restaurant Week, and I was preparing myself for a repeat of disaster.  However, the food was superb.

Free bread (yay!):  Buttery biscuity bread.  Mmn mmn. . .so flaky, warm and golden brown like a biscuit on the outside and yet it was pillowy-soft on the inside like freshly baked bread.  The added hint of rosemary was divine.

Calamari appetizer:  Crunchy golden brown rods with creamy buttermilk ranch type dipping sauce and a tart marinara sauce on the side.  This was good but not spectacular a la Scott's Seafood calamari provenciale.

Truffle Chips: OoooOOooOOOOooOOOOooOOOOooOOOoooooooo (this could go on for a while).  Home made, flash fried, thinly sliced, oval shaped chips with a creamy white cheese sauce and truffle oil.  So simple and yet so utterly wonderful!!  This was my favorite appetizer, and comes second to Scott's calamari.

Kobe Flank Steak: Tender, juicy, perfectly medium rare and they have this tangy steak sauce that they give you on the side that tastes like A1 but even better. I got the charbroiled broccoli and the creamed spinach as sides, and my bf got the mushrooms and the garlic whipped potatoes.  The sides were good, not great, but at least they weren't salty and inedible like the sides from Alexander's Steakhouse in Cupertino.

Creme brulee: Instead of custard-like in the middle, it had the texture very similar to flan.  Interesting, my bf liked it. . .though I think I prefer my creme brulees creamy!

I noticed that they had an outdoor terrace for dining although the night we went...it was slightly pouring outside.  The menu was typical steakhouse choices: porterhouse ribeye, filet, kobe, sirloin, ny, and a few others.  They had the side dishes like truffle mac&cheese, creamed spinach, mashed spuds, sauteed mushrooms, and so on.  They had an interesting prix-fixe menu wherer they gave you a salad, kobe flat iron steak or ahi tuna, and a vanilla creme brulee.  Since I wanted the ribeye, I passed on that but that seemed to be a nice deal.

The steaks were decent sized...the meat was soft and fresh.  I asked my steak to be blackened and served with their version of A1 dressing.  It was juicy and delicious and cooked well.  The sides were about average....the truffle mac and cheese had a ton of truffle oil in there...I think it was overkill.  

The restaurant was nice enough to give us a comp'd dessert to celebrate my friend's promotion at work.  They brought out their donut holes dessert and gave him a liquor filled candle which they torched in front of him and caused all the nearby tables to crane their heads to watch.

We had a large party, so we were assigned a pre-fixe meal. Okay, so $100 a person got us only a petite filet, and some appetizers and dessert served family-style, so it was VERY overpriced. However, I was pleasantly surprised. 

The appetizers were okay but not mind-blowing... steak tartare was okay, crab cake was decent, and the truffle nachos just seemed like Lays potato chips with some truffle oil and melted cheese on top. Meh.

The steak was larger than I expected for a ""petite"", and it was perfectly cooked. The flavor was pretty good, as well.

The sides that came with the meal was probably the highlight. The truffle mac-n-cheese was EXCELLENT.. with macaroni (more like.. pasta) that was cooked al dente, and a distinct truffle flavor. Too bad they kind of went stingy on that one and didn't give us enough plates. The creamed spinach was good, and the fried crispy onions, though not special by any means, served as a decent filler. 

The chocolate-filled beginets with dipping sauces and the chocolate cake were great. I didn't care so much for the s'mores thing and the cheesecake, but they weren't bad.

Okay, so the perfect indicator of the ridiculous cost of this restaurant is that their wines had a 2.5-3x markup. Ripping us off, don't you think?",jhPAC7UyPiRFNPlNQYMMXg,0,0,3,Ke6fQ2e9_iKvcEFV9h7Jyg

Aside from that, this place is a huge rip off. Two entrees, salads, two drinks and one dessert should never be $190 plus tip. I don't care where you are, that is just pure bullshit. I've often said that if I can do a better job with my limited education, expertise and intelligence this place has a problem. Boa has a huge problem. My Alberston's rib eye for $4.99 a pound tastes better and is more tender on my Char Broil low end grill than Boa's. The Flat Iron NY Strip was good, not great.

The Cocktail:
Boa 408: with strawberry puree, balsamic vinegar, and crushed black pepper. I only ordered because it's award winning cocktail, and it sounds interesting. And it turned out to be the BEST COCKTAIL I've ever had. I was expecting something heavier, but it's incredibly light and refreshing. Not too sweet, almost can't taste the alcohol, or the pepper. It's just a perfect balance.

The appetizer:
Goat cheese Baklava: this is amazing. I love baklava, and this savory version of it is so simple, packed with flavor, surprisingly interesting texture, and just amazing. It's basically the same texture as the sweet baklava, except that the nut filling is replaced by goat (chevre i think) cheese, with pistachio, crushed black truffle sprinkles, and drizzled with honey. Flaky, creamy/cheesy, crunchy, and sweet....I'm going to try to make it at home. It's divine.

Curried crab timbale with avocado, cantalupe, and lotus chips. I loved the combination very much, especially the big chunks of crab meat on top. This is probably the least favored dish in the meal only because everything else is so amazing, but it's pretty damned good.

Entree:
The seafood special f the night: fish fillet (i forgot the name of the fish) wrap, with prawns and asparagus. This is truly amazing dish, perfectly executed, and harmoniously flavored. The fish itself is seared perfectly so the outside is slightly browned, but the inside just melts in your mouth. The whole combination is just perfect. 

Dessert:
Flourless Chocolate Cake with homemade Vanilla Bean Icecream. The cake is luke warm and melt in your mouth, but I thought the vanilla bean icecream is stellar. 

The service:
Our waiter is so friendly and personable. Great suggestions, great memorization, and so chill.

My wife and I dined here the day after Thanksgiving 2011 and, not surprisingly, the restaurant was somewhat empty at 6:45pm (but it is also Vegas, so 6:45pm is more like lunch).

Atmosphere:
Coming from the bright and noisy Caesar's Palace Forum Shops into the restaurant is a drastic change of scenery. The restaurant is very dark and surprisingly quiet. Patrons immediately see a large bar area and a giant wine chilling room stocked with bottles before reaching the main dining area in the back. Large windows provide a view of the neon world outside.

Appetizer:
We started with the Steak Tartare and it was decadent. The raw steak is mixed at the table with 6 different herbs and a raw egg. It was one of the best Steak Tartares I have eaten.
 
Entree:
I selected the Bone-in Kansas City Filet and I was very pleased with my choice. The medium rare filet was so tender, it was actually difficult to cut, but eating it was sensational. The marbling was rendered edible and not gristly at all...very nice! Melted herb butter topped off the succulent steak for an amazing taste and texture experience. Perfectly-prepared mashed potatoes with sour cream and chives rounded out the plate.

Drinks/Desserts:
After consuming more than our share on Thanksgiving Day, we opted out of drinks and desserts, so I cannot comment there. However, friends tell me the mixed drinks at BOA are above average.

Service:
The service was top notch. Our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing. The bus and water people came when needed and were quick.

Other:
About the only thing resembling a complaint is the overly-cushy seats. They made the table a little higher than standard, but this was not a major issue. Prices were similar to Ruth's Chris & Morton's, but the quality food was much better. Kudos for being able to book on Open Table straight from my phone.

3 of the 4 of us were rather disappointed in our steaks.  In a town like Vegas where good steaks are a dime a dozen, these ones really weren't that great for $40+ pieces of meat.  I am pretty bad at bbq'ing steaks and I have done better than the one I got here.  If you want a great steak in Vegas, this doesn't seem like the spot

The waiter also said the sides were served family style--Apparently that meant there is enough for one person in a tiny bowl that they set in the middle of the table.  Weak!  Desert was good, but its still sad that all four of us said the highlight of our meal was an appetizer we split four ways.

You choose a cut, a rub and a sauce. I had the Kobe flat iron steak with foie gras butter. I also had some of my friend's bone-in ribeye (peppercorn rub) and some bone-in filet (peppercorn rub).

Sauces? I noticed that most of the table didn't really have much of their sauce. Everyone was just enjoying the meat too much.

It's what's for dinner.

No, I wasn't talking about the bachelor party sitting across our table. I'm talking about red meat at BOA steakhouse.

This being Vegas and this being a steakhouse on the strip, expect the prices to be high but not ridiculous like CUT at the Palazzo.

We're glad that we went with the tasting menu, not only did it offer variety, it was priced right at $75 for 5 courses. The portions are quite generous for a ""tasting"" menu.

We started off with watercress salad. I'm personally not into watercress, but hey, I needed veggies. If it weren't for the hearts of palm and the feta cheese, I wouldn't have even touched this.

As a foie gras lover, I was excited when our second course came out.  Seared Hudson Valley foie on a toasted brioche, caramelized onions and blood orange syrup. My tastebuds were all in a frenzy. A fine frenzy.

The steamed Chilean sea bass looked pretty on the plate and tasty in the mouth! It was flaky and moist and if all fish were cooked like this, I'd eat it more often. The baby carrots and bok choy still had a nice crunch to it while the tropical salsa was the perfect complement.

Shortly after, my filet mignon came out. I was a wee bit disappointed that they over-salted my meat but it came out medium-rare as I requested. The mash potatoes wasn't too creamy which I liked, especially after having two of those buttery rolls they kept refilling my bread plate with and those were good sized rolls!

I was in the ladies room when they brought out the last course and the bf was actually finished with his by the time I got my dessert. Our waiter apologized because the kitchen forgot to make one for me! (I know, sad face!) When I dug into my warm banana cake with house made banana ice cream, it was good but the toffee sauce was too sweet, it took away from the subtle flavor of the cake. 

Service was excellent. Good drink recommendations, our bread plate and water glasses were never empty, cutlery were changed with every course and our server even offered to take our picture. (couple of pics actually!)

BOA gives you great value for your money, especially if you decide to do the tasting menu, although a little adjustment is needed on seasoning its meat.

It's clear that Daisy hasn't had a lot of kobe burgers before, because Boa's burger is as bland and forgettable as it gets. Clearly they use purchased patties...they're too perfectly-shaped to be house-ground. Even the condiments and the bun (usually the most forgotten part of the burger experience) were kind of mediocre.

SERVICE: 
I hate this place for being so effin snobby and forgetful.  I made a reservation at 8:15pm and was running late because of traffic on the strip, so I called to extend it to 8:30pm to be safe, which Ashley (she was very helpful) was very kind about.  She extended it without a question, and even told me the lines for the valet wasn't long.  We walked in around 8:18pm and still had to wait until 9:00 to be seated because according to the other girl in front, ""I called in to extend my reservation and now I will have to wait longer"".  So basically even if I had a reservation at 8:30pm it would have not mattered to her.  People that walked in without a reservation got seated before us, and we only had a party of FOUR people.  Anyway...

FOOD: 
We ordered the Crab Cake, BOA Burger, Spaghetti with Kobe Meatballs, Kobe Filet Mignon and Truffled Cheese Fries.  I loved everything! 
The Crab Cake has got to be my favorite out of all the food, because I am not a huge meat fan and would rather eat crustacean.  The crab just melted in my mouth and was so juicy and crispy at the same time.  $20
The BOA Burger was 'incredible' at the least.  It was so yummy and juicy.  It came with fries on the side and was of really good quality. $28.
The Spaghetti with Kobe Meatballs was just okay.  I expected better, because the spaghetti itself tasted really cheaply made and you couldn't really taste the Kobe flavor in the meatballs. $25.
The Kobe Filet Mignon on the other hand... was melt in your mouth delicious!  We didn't add any rub or sauce with it, because its fine on its own. :) $53
The Truffled Cheese Fries were good also, the cheese on it was really yummy and creamy.   $12.
For dessert, our server brought us chocolate filled donut holes with a sparkler for a birthday we were celebrating.  It was so good, although I'm not a fan of sugar coated anything.

That being said, the serving of our ""Porterhouse for  2"" didn't quite meet the glitter & glammar that is Las Vegas.  Coming from Southern California, most of the finer, gourmet steak houses (etc Ruth Chris, Arroyo Chop House, Mortons, Maestros.....even Boa, Santa Monica) will serve your Porterhouse for 2 at the table, dividing both the strip steak & fillet equally where both individuals have pieces from each side, respectively.  Boa Las Vegas divides their Porterhouse for 2 in the kitchen, and is brought to the table where 1 person gets all of the strip steak while the other person gets all of the fillet side.....UNBELIEVABLE being served in this style at such a well established steakhouse.  When asking the waiter about this, he said that ""HE usually will divide the Porterhouse at the table BUT, he could bring it back to the kitchen to divide it properly, should I wish!""  I said sure AND upon bringing back our Porterhouse for 2, the whole strip steak portion was cut to pieces and served to my wife while the whole fillet portion was also cut to pieces and served to me.......WOW.  The look by the waiter was suggestive of ""I don't know what's wrong with you.....don't know how to cut steak or what?""  My sister who had suggested Boa Steakhouse for our New Years Eve rendezvous was embarrassed & appalled in the way my wife & I were served.  Next, they'll probably say there was a new chef in the kitchen for New Years Eve that didn't know what he/she was doing.  This makes me apprehensive to come back for a second chance at this restaurant  because this should have been one of the best dining experiences of my life in Las Vegas.",qn8IYeNRvz0e2b45Xir4eA,4,3,1,zaQxTLJsp8acyrrgmCHP5w

We had several other steakhouse options, but finally made the decision to give BOA a try since none of us had ever been there. The entire staff was very nice and were around to tend to our every need whether we needed more bread or more water. We were served potato chip nachos topped with truffle and melted cheddar while we waited for our food. All of the steaks come with your choice of a rub or a sauce so I had the bone-in ribeye with the herbed butter rub with a side of BOA's signature sauce for an additional $1. My steak was cooked medium and was juicy and tender. A whole roasted garlic is also served with your steak, but it is truly an acquired taste. The mushiness and slightly bitter taste of the roasted garlic may not tickle everyone's pallete, but once you can appreciate the taste it can really compliment your steak. The sides were also delicious. We had the lobster mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, and the truffle mac-n-cheese. We all ordered a different meat from the menu such as the bone-in kansas city filet mignon, petite filet, and the american kobe flat iron and there were no complaints. We were all very impressed with the food and the service. They even gave us a sparkling birthday treat of little donut holes with a side of raspberry sauce for dipping, but...we weren't celebrating anyone's birthday!? 

My friends and I had a very memorable dining experience at the BOA in Las Vegas thanks to the great food along with the A+ service. I was so impressed that I just had to bring my boyfriend the next time I went back to vegas, which was during Labor Day '08. This time around I started with the smooth and creamy lobster bisque. We both ordered the bone-in ribeye because ribeye is our favorite cut. We also ordered two sides to share. He was very pleased with everything just as I thought he would be. We topped off our dinner with a delightful order of creme brulee garnished with a little candied basket filled with fresh fruits and berries.

We've got tons of them.  But when I heard that Boa was having their 5 year anniversary and were offering 50% off their entire menu, I had to go try it.  Boy am I glad I did.

From the moment my girlfriend and I walked in, we were treated to fantastic service.  A manager passed us and greeted us, and even though it was odd that we didn't get menus when we sat down, they arrived shortly.

We started with the fritto misto, which is a calamari and artichoke dish.  My girlfriend loves artichokes, so she was very disappointed when it arrived and there were only two pieces in all of the calamari.  I asked our waitress Winnie if this was normal, and she said it was.  She explained the dish further to me and told us next time we could request extra artichokes.  Then two minutes later she came back with a bowl of artichokes for us, as she said my girlfriend's face looked like her dog had died when she found out the lack of artichoke was normal.  That was awesome of her.

For our main course, I took the waitress's recommendation of the rib eye, and my girlfriend had the prawns.  Neither of us were disappointed.  Her prawns were big and had a great flavor to them.  My steak was prepared to perfection... probably the best rib eye I've ever eaten.  I didn't even need the sauce I had ordered.

We were stuffed when Winne brought the dessert menu, but we looked it over anyways.  Chocolate filled donut holes with two dipping sauces?  How do we say no to that.  Let's just say we were overstuffed when we left.

Our entire bill pre-discount was $102, so $51.  Oh how I wish it was always $51 for this meal.  Worth it at $102, but probably going to save my pennies and hope they run this promotion at their 6 year anniversal.  Well done, Boa.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,5,3,5,DwFj10o9_4Bn1Vrf3BAJTQ

We go in. Customer service is great. they lead us into our table and give us menus. my waiter even did my napkin for me! haha. it was dark and i LOVE dark restraurants. it just gives off that feel. that hecka subtle dark moody feel.

theres a sheet of paper that they call a menu that you order from. one sided. i guess it was because we arrived lunchtimeish. but there was plenty that we wanted to eat. so it was good
 
i ordered the bone in filet mignon. my sister got the porterhouse. and my dad got the SHOOT I FORGOT! -_- but it was just OK. my bone in filet mignon however was delicious. a bit salty and a bit burnt lol i had a slight charred taste in my mouth for a while haha. but was delicious. perfect red smack in the middle. beautiful. didnt cut as well as texas roadhouse but goooood. it was a good 12 ounce. if you dont know what a 12 ouncer looks like, imagine your fist rolled up. thats what it looks like haha.

 My sisters porterhouse was 16 ounces. more bigger than my filet mignon but lacked in that much flavor. personally i liked mine MUCH better then hers but she said she liked hers more than mine ,so (shrug)

We told the hostess we'd wait at the bar for the next table available in the main dining room, to which she begrudgingly replied that the wait could be up to an hour.  The wait was less than 5 minutes.  We were led to our table before even being able to order drinks.

The experience seemed to have kicked off with a very unappetizing attitude.  Thank goodness, it was saved by 1. Absolutely delicious cocktails; 2. A delightful and gracious waiter who comped us a bottle of red, because ""you're here to have fun!""; and 3.

The bread rolls was pretty mediocre, and tasted a bit aged.. but the butter was extremely soft and creamy. 

I ordered 2 appetizers..  Foie Gras ($20), and  the japanese wagyu ($32).

The wagyu was excellent! It was only 2ozs, but after having a 6oz cut at Stripsteak earlier.. This didn't taste much worse, and and I thought it was a decent deal.  It tasted excellent, and came served as 3 sausage shaped pieces.

The foie gras wasn't bad, but I've had MUCH better before.  If I had to choose, I would settle for the Wagyu next time.

From what I remember the last time I came here I ordered the ""BLT"" salad that has some nice applewood smoked bacon, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and a nice creamy bacon dressing..but it's not overbearingly heavy considering it has avocado and bacon..they put just the right amount.

Took my parents here for dinner one night during our stay for their 30th wedding anniversary, we had a party of 4.  I put my better half in charge of finding a good steak place and she came to settle on BOA based on other reviews, etc.  We had dinner on a Wednesday night and the place was fairly empty.  The service from the hostess was prompt and they allowed us to basically pick where we wanted to sit.  The decor is nice and the place has a generally good vibe.  Not a typical ""mens club"" steakhouse feel but a very upbeat which one would argue is typical of Las Vegas.

Appetizers:

1 Bottle of Pinot Noir - I do not recall exactly which bottle but it was very nice and reasonably priced.

Chilled Jumbo Prawns - Large, fresh and excellent.  They couldnt have been done any better.

Calamari - Again, fresh and done just right.  Not the rubbery mess that you can sometimes get but very well done fresh calamari.

Jumbo Lump Crab Cake - Spot on, lots of crab and very tasty.

Organic Baby Greens - Fresh greens and the balsamic dressing was done right.

Dinner:

Jumbo Prawns - A little hesitant to order these after already having shrimp for an appetizer but she wasnt disappointed.  Good flavor, grilled perfectly, not dried out which can typically happen at lesser restaurants.

40 Day Dry Aged NY Strip - Wow.  Stop the bus.  Hold the presses.  Being from Kansas and a total meat lover I have eaten countless steaks at some of the best steakhouses in the country, not to mention farm fresh steak from locally grown cattle in Kansas.  The steak here was done to perfection!  This is easily in the top 5 steaks of all time.  If you come for nothing else than a steak, just do it!

Sides:

For sides we did family style with mashed potatoes, baked potato and two orders of sauteed mushrooms.  All of these where done correctly.  I really enjoyed the sauteed mushrooms

Dessert:

For desert we had a selection of sorbet, cake (I forget exactly which), coffee and tea.  Again the expectations were totally met and everything was delicious.

Summary:

The service, the food and the ambiance was done to perfection.  I would go back there in a heartbeat and recommend this restaurant highly to anyone go to Las Vegas that enjoys an excellent steak.",mm-2o0YpFIv3LJNXLF7I9Q,0,0,5,achWXa2spik70PIw8uiw8g

They start you off with yummmmmy bread, it had rosemary in it, came out fresh and hot and tasted like a lighter focaccia bread. i think I had like 2 and a half rolls because it was so delicious. I then had the Boa Chop Chop salad which I thought was really great. It had chickpeas, cheese, ham, salami, pepporcinis and was very good. Some other people in our party had the ceaser salad and they prepare it tableside which is kind of cool. 

For entrees my bf and I shared the filet and spaghetti with kobe meatballs. The fillet was not bad but I have had better steak elsewhere, we had a side of Bearnaise sauce, and my favorite part was the roasted garlic half  that came on the side. Some of the sides we had were the truffle mac and cheese (a favorite of the group), potato au gratin were good too.

Boyfriend had a Bleu-cheese crusted New York, which was good also, but not nearly as melt-in-your-mouth as my Filet. He did enjoy the crust, it had just enough flavor not to overpower the steak.

I came here for lunch on my last trip to Las Vegas with my friends. I had done some research before I got there and was looking for a nice and reasonable place to have lunch (gotta budget yourself in Vegas!). I saw on their menu that they had a Kobe beef burger and prime beef sandwich. I had to go try it out.

The Kobe beef burger was melt in your mouth good. And for only $12??? Incredible. 

The prime beef sandwich was a great preview of what their steaks for dinner could be. Came with a salad with this super tasty dressing. I don't remember what it was but I've never had a dressing like that anywhere else before. 

Next time I come to Vegas I'm going to save up some money so I can check out their dinner entrees. I'm always down for a good steak. =)

* The service was a mix of ok and bad.  the main waiter was friendly, but too chatty, pushed stuff on us we didn't have any interest in, and tended to talk in too much schtick, not that genuine
* the drinks waiter was just bad - a few folks had to go through multiple iterations to get it right
* we sat ""downstairs"" and out on the terrace.  great views and a really nice night, except that the kitchen and bathrooms are upstairs - meaning to go to the bathroom, you need to take an elevator!  if they mess up your drink, they need to walk up 2 flights of stairs to get it fixed
* prices were ok, but hey, you're in vegas, if you're looking at the prices, go home :-)
* the side dishes were quite ordinary, a few folks thought they were worse than that.
* the bachelor of all people had to send his steak back, it was raw... ouch!

what was good:
* the salad was delicious, great and fresh
* the wine list was impressive and lots of magnums for large parties
* great location, right in the middle of the strip, inside the Caesar's forum shops

I listened to him as he spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to give her his name. I understand it's the mainland & she might be unfamiliar with Asian last names but he was spelling it out for her (multiple times, mind you), for God's sake. Apparently from S-A-S-A-K-I she was able to get S-Z-A-X-K-H-I.

Luckily, there was still an opening in the time slot we'd requested.

But enough about the hostess' inability to understand the alphabet & onto the actual restaurant. The only way I can describe BOA's atmosphere is...sexy. Guys, if you wanna impress a girl, bring her here. You won't be sorry.

We were seated pretty quickly by the hostess as there was no one really there at around 8:00 pm. Most people showed up around 9:00 pm or so, I guess in Sin City people just eat later. Well the first knock was the fact that it took them about 5-10 minutes just to have a waiter come by and give us menus. They did give us the wine menu when we first sat down, so i guess if you are a big wine drinker then thats good I guess.

The server was a middle aged man, handed us the menus and took our drink orders. A little bit later, a younger gentleman stopped by and told us about the specials of the day and so forth. Nothing really impressive, just some expensive Kobe beef they were selling by the ounce.

The appetizers came out pretty quickly, but why would you name the appetizer calamari and artichoke when there is obviously only one peice of artichoke in the dish? It was nothing sepctacular. i have had better calamari at Sam Woo. 

So we are enjoying ourselves and waiting for our food, there was a couple who sat down about 15-20 minutes after us and they received their main course. I looked over and thought it was kind of peculiar that even though we had appetizers that they would receive the main course before us. But i let it go, thinking that maybe because of what we ordered it would take a tad bit longer.

Funny thing is, that about 10 minutes later I see the same young waiter we had come by with an order slip and look at the table next to us, checking the order slip and what was in front of the other table, once that happened I knew they had given our order to the wrong table. I also could guess when i saw that the woman at the other table had a porterhouse in front of her, not saying she cant eat it, just saying that she probably wouldnt order the biggest steak on the menu.

So we wait and wait and wait. The older waiter comes by and tells us our food is on the way, we say okay thank you. Once again even though he stopped by our table he didnt notice our drinks needed to be refilled. 

The younger waiter than proceeds to come out with what looked like chips topped with some white cream sauce and says that its on the house. I tell him that i would rather not and proceed to ask him why it is taking so gosh darn long for our food. He says that they messed up the order, i then ask him if the table next to us received our order, he tells me honestly, yes they did.

Two things that pissed me off, first off, you could have come to me right away and explained the situation instead of making me wait 20-30 minutes before finally letting me know. Second thing, dont give me chips and some stupid sauce and think that i can be bamboozled by this gesture. Ridiculous. 

So by the time the food comes out, its been about 30-45 minutes since we finished out appetizers. The steaks we had were okay, nothing to write home about. I will say that my porterhouse wasnt the best cut and apparently they have a different interpreation of what medium rare is. 

A manager came by later and gave us his fake apologies and told us he would take care of it for us. He took off my steak, which i really didnt care about. You would think that if i had decided to come to somewhat of a pricey place that i wouldnt mind paying for what i ate, so for them to take off one steak for us did me nothing.

All in all, a really bad choice on my part for picking this place. Might have well choose the place downstairs, Joe's or something. Would I recommend this place to someone? No, i wouldnt, steak is average at best, service is laughable.",ybbdMe2Wtfi7qI4Tmig7Cw,4,1,2,QcXWvxkaWi32WkEoPf-suw
5311702,2006-09-16,0,n1Ng1q300iLHYZELtOd5FA,"The steak here is good, but not the best in Vegas. No complaints on the drinks and appetizers. You cannot really mess up oysters on half shell or fried calamari. They have a very extensive wine list and a knowledgeable sommelier. Only complaint I have with Boa is their wait staff. They have no idea on what goes where and who ordered what. Very uncoordinated and slow in delivering the entrees. Steak was cold, but still tasty. Don't get their Kobe Steaks. It's not worth it and it's nothing special. It taste like a more buttery rib eye steak. Ruth Chris's is still the best steakhouse in my opinion.",5aMGeZ96w_IjZGcwVirURQ,0,0,4,iektC2zL3iPB4jyaH-aKIw

When dining alone I love sitting at the bar and the guys at BOA are just another reason why. Super friendly service, great drinks and a steak that makes you want to slap your gramma!

Since my current alcoholic crush is on gin I sampled a few of their crafted cocktails made of the stuff, each drink went so well with everything -- I really wanted this meal to go on for days. 

I started with a wedge salad (hold the bacon), the lettuce was fresh and the dressing was super creamy, this was delicious! Next up the star of the show, a juicy delicious piece of boneless rib eye cooked to perfection! I don't think I have ever eaten so slowly. 

No way there's room for dessert you say, oh, but there was. Three chocolate cupcakes topped with torched marshmallow and served with fresh whipped cream. I pretty much went back to my hotel room and passed out after this meal, it was well worth the hefty price tag.

5331769,2007-01-07,0,n1Ng1q300iLHYZELtOd5FA,"Went here on my sister's recommendation, as she adores the Santa Monica Location.  However, even she agreed that this particular place was not up to par.

In any case, the highlight of the evening was the steak itself.  Cooked as requested, my dry aged NY strip was tasty.  Also, the service was appropriately attentive and friendly.  Outside of that though...little was going right that evening.

The first issue came up when I scanned the menu.  Cool, you get to choose from a variety of steaks, from traditional corn-fed to ""organic"" to , uh oh, Kobe.  Intrigued by the organic offering, I kindly ask our waiter if he could tell me about where they get their organic meat, and if he could tell me if it's partially or completely grass fed.  After hemming and hawing for a bit, he says, 'actually, I don't know...let me go check.'  After a couple of minutes, he comes back and tells me that he's unable to find further information about the organic beef, and how it's raised.

Red flag on the play, 10 yard penalty, still first down.  Sounds like there's more marketing on the menu than actual care put into the beef.  Suddenly, the Kobe and Organic offerings don't appeal to me anymore. If they don't care enough to know the origins of their specialty meats, how can I possibly expect them to cook them properly?   To give them the benefit of the doubt, I went with a traditional corn-fed steak-- A good move, as I mentioned earlier.

It comes with a selection of sauces, and I decided to go with Bernaise...as it's always a favorite accompaniment of mine.  To start with I ordered up the Steak Tartare prepared tableside...I was in a beefy mood, what can I say?

The tartare came, and it wasn't anything special.  They included a quail egg, which is no big foul, but I've always preferred a good amount of yolk to accompany my chopped beef.  Also, it was doused with olive oil and set on top of bitter greens, and served with toasted baguette.  In the end, the preparation masked the pure beefyness that is the only reason for ordering tartare in the first place.  I still long to find the yummy baseballs of fillet and yolk that I'd get in most any Parisian Bistro.

On to the NY Strip.  Got it with a side of asparagus....limp and stringy, someone forgot to peel the bottoms.  Got to the Bernaise...but it was just way too buttery and missing the balance of a good Bernaise.  I guess they really must be afraid of egg yolk in this joint.  As a backup I tried their J-1 sauce...hmm, it's just like A-1 except not a sweet.  Okay, never mind then, I'll just skip the sauce and go for the meat.

In the end, the faux Laguiole steak knife on the table pretty much summed things up.  Most everything looks pretty and sounds good...but there just isn't enough substance and care put into the food or the cooking for me to really enjoy it.",wktMii8vZ0P4iHaOCDjZTw,3,2,2,0yFmeykf7QdcZu0UBRkZrg

Once we got to BOA  we thought we should totally get steaks. So we did and ended up  full but disappointed. Drinks were good. Service was okay. Loved the decor.

I got the special (not with a special price) Oscar Filet, ordered medium rare. The server initially brought me the wrong meal, but promptly took it away and was replaced quickly with my correct order. The filet was a bit over medium rare, the lobster/crab mix on top was good, the bernaise sauce made the dish, helped moisten the steak and flavor the seafood. Asparagus on the side was good, done nicely.
My husband (he wanted me to give them 2 stars) got the Rib Eye which we were told by the waiter is the best on the strip...it wasn't.  It too was ordered medium rare and was a bit over cooked. It was a bit dry and lacked seasoning. we asked for salt (there's none on the tables) and we got a dish of sea salt and truffled salt, which helped things. We shared the loaded mashed potatoes, they were too heavy and just tasted junked up, too much bacon and cheese.

It was made fresh by our table side. For the second course my boyfriend had the filet mignon medallions and I had the Salmon. Both of these were cooked to perfection. The steak tasted so good I thought I was in heaven. The cocktails were also very good (if you like girly strong drinks). We did not get to eat the donut holes everyone has been raving about because my bf and his friend didn't feel well (too much partying!) We ended up leaving and the waitress felt so bad we couldn't stay for dessert. She took my cocktail drink off my bill and told us we could come back for it later that night. SERVICE was a 10 as she catered to our needs the whole night. When I didn't eat my soup, she offered to get me a salad or something else...........now this is fine dining. I felt like a Queen.

I had a $50 gift certificate thanks to a Living Social deal which definitely helped with the bill; but even without I think it would have been worth it.

Things got off to a good start when a server brought out warm rolls which were crusty on the outside and doughy/flaky on the inside, almost like a croissant.

For 3, we ordered 2 salads and both were yummy! Fresh and flavorful! 

For dinner I got the bone in filet mignon, by far my favorite cut of meat and even more so when I can find it with the bone-in. Came out perfectly cooked rare.

My reservations via OpenTable were for 7:30 PM. Apparently my friend didn't know her way around Caesar's and finally showed up at 7:50 PM. The host (I suspect manager - an asian guy in his 30's) talked to me for a bit in the lounge while I waited for my friend. Two guys at the bar apparently knew everybody in sight and the chef came out to speak with them so I was able to see him and say ""hi.""

This place gets a star for not turning my friend away at the door. I'll admit that I didn't tell her to dress up, but to my credit, I told her it was a pretty expensive steakhouse and she didn't take heed. Luckily, I threw my fur coat on her, and we were seated pretty quickly. The dining room is nice, but it was very empty. Apparently, according to staff, this time of year is extremely slow - so go in! You'll get more attentive service!

I had the Boa Chop Chop salad ($14), hold the chickpeas, my friend had the Caesar salad ($14), made table side and we split the $9 sweet potato fries, served with ketchup and blue cheese dipping sauce. My salad was pretty tiny and bland, so I mixed in a bit of the blue cheese dipping sauce from the fries and it was better. My friend didn't eat much of her salad but said it was good. She took it to go.

We still had $10 left to play with for the meal, so we ordered the donuts to go because we weren't hungry and didn't feel like eating them.

At the time I have never heard of the restaurant, and BOA only conjures up images of a bank or the popular Korean singer. A few weeks later, I bought a Groupon for BOA ($25 for $50 worth of food and drinks) so I can go try it out for myself.

Making the reservation was painless and easy.  But finding the restaurant itself was a little tougher, since it is located a bit off the beaten path (3rd floor of the Caesar's Palace Forum Shop).
The restaurant itself was very nice, but when I arrived for my early reservation, only the front part and the bar was opened for seating.

My waitress was friendly and handed me my menu (for lunch) shortly after I picked out and sat at my table, but gave me the dinner menu once I asked for it.

The menu options look interesting, with the typical categories of items found at steakhouses.

For my appetizer I went with the Goat Cheese Bakalava served with pistachio, black truffles and a few pieces of frissee ($14).  I liked it, plus it was different from the usual steakhouse appetizers. Definitely worth a try if you are feeling adventurous.

And selected the 21-days Dry Aged Bone-In Rib-eye and opted for the Blue Cheese Crust (it was that or Foie Gras Butter), the waitress also brought out their Signature J-1 Sauce (tomato based, with Sriracha for that extra spicy kick, even thought it was pretty mild).  The steak had nice flavor, a great blue cheese crust, but slightly over done (probably after broiling the blue cheese crust). 

After that I was looking forward to a refreshing dessert, but most of the desserts found on their menu didn't look appealing or were too typical for me at the time, and I eventually opted to get a scoop of gelato instead.

Nothing like a mini surprise to top the night...Other then the start of the night the rest was perfect.",PR9zEMqTNaFxBARQa19_lw,0,0,5,NLlCxs7FATX5pXlaGPG76w
