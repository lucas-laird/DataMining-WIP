It's a shell of the actual fast-food restaurants, but it fills the hole for a quick bite and drink while traversing the Rio. Service was adequate, although I attacked the restaurant when there were no customers. So maybe adequate is not good enough when I'm the only customer.

The Whopper was bland. The ingredients were fresh enough, and I saw the server make my hamburger so I know it wasn't premade. But it just tasted bland.

Overall, it's just meh.",ToCtj9x7Ei0m_uLeoMQv3Q,1,0,2,P-qULQu6QKEiTeleyTzZXw

3577091,2011-06-22,1,idPAwtnvruaB7YivrvFbzA,"I don't understand why anyone would want to go here, ever.  I like Burger King just fine and so the idea of having more options for the burger sounds good, but everything about this place is just awful.

The first time I went they were very busy and the layout is such that there's almost no separation between tables and any potential line to form.  For some people I imagine it was a crowded and uncomfortable eating experience.  I got a double whopper and when I asked for pepper jack, cheddar cheese, and pepper bacon on it, they got totally confused, I mean to the point of me having to explain what I wanted to two different people over the course of 2 minutes (no I don't have a weird accent or speech impediment).  Anyway, your options are ""small combo"" or ""medium combo"" which is weird because with the medium combo you still get a giant drink, but only a medium fry.  Why take options away from customers?  Isn't the whole point of the Whopper Bar to give people more options?

Of course, when I got my burger it was completely wrong, and combined with the rather disgusting look of the fries (same as the normal BK fries, but this batch looked old) I got a refund.  It would have been almost $10 exactly.  

I went again a few weeks later and asked for the same thing.  No confusion on the order this time, and surprisingly they were not busy despite being a Saturday afternoon.  The first time I had gone they explained to me that the double whopper comes with 4 slices of cheese (don't worry, they're thin) and you can pick two different types for free.  For whatever reason I got charged extra this time.  Anyway after getting the burger, I opened it up and noticed that the bacon looked exactly like the normal bacon you can get at any BK, and half the cheese I wanted was not there.  So I took it back up and it took nearly 4 minutes (!) to fix, which is weird considering there were no other customers there and they did not make a fresh burger, just put cheese on the old burger.  When I got the burger back the bottom appeared to have been soaked in some liquid.  It was extremely nasty and so I once again got a refund for my meal.  The manager herself even said ""that's disgusting"" and offered to make it herself and give me a refund, but I just wanted to get out of there.

Even though I've never tasted the food there, it was exactly the same stuff you find at a normal Burger King restaurant.  There is nothing special about it except being overpriced, having a poor layout, having unacceptable levels of service and incompetent staff.   Nobody in their right mind would ever make a special trip to the Rio just to go to the Whopper Bar, and if you happen to be in the Rio looking for a burger you would be infinitely better off going to All American Bar & Grille or Sao Paolo Cafe, who are only slightly more expensive, but I think have some of the best burgers in the city.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,3,0,1,JYnnZ6zopDassFV1X81glw
3738635,2015-09-15,4,idPAwtnvruaB7YivrvFbzA,"So we were going inside the Rio from the parking garage and the first thing we see when we come in is the Burger King.... BAR? 

What.

Is this real life?

Only in Vegas- not even. Only in Rio Las Vegas!

They have a couple beers, which I didn't get, but if you ask them, they'll totally tell you what it is.

The Burger King is VERY limited- they make Whoppers. And double Whoppers. And breakfast.... and to my eye, that was about all they made. O_O So you don't get hamburgers, cheeseburgers, etc, unfortunately. Or whatever else BK has, because I haven't been to a BK in  so long. They DO have smoothies though!

Ordered a whopper, tasted alright, cheaply made, of course :-/ They didn't put enough sauce, and so it felt a little plain. It's totally fast food, and lines show up and that's when production begins to slow down, as there is a cashier, a man working on making burgers, and the people in the back making everything else. (Hash browns, fries...). It took a couple minutes to get our order in, but even longer for them to make the hash browns. I mean- it's breakfast.... shouldn't you have some already ready?


They do have nice service and they do accept LA coupons (whose food they make), so they do have that working out for them.

This place in the Rio got a 3-star because of what an actual BK is.  If I take it that way as a chain, it gets an average rating.  No extra stars for this wannabe mini bar concept.  I was kinda excited to finally get to check this place out too!

After getting Trekked out at the Star Trek Convention, I was as famished as a Vulcan without a home planet.  Places in the Rio Hotel & Casino are HELLA expensive to eat at and I just wanted something simple.  Like a burger.  Eureka!  I finally thought to check out the BK Whopper Bar.  Burger and a beer?  Can't get much more grandiose for the chump change I had left after taking an interplanetary beating buying collectibles.  

I finally get to the place, and guess what?  Every single other klingon, vulcan, and U.S.S. Enterprise crewmate was in attendance.  Drats.  I was like, ""Damn, this burger better be good.""  After a 15 minute wait in line, I finally approach the cashier.  I look at the menu boards.  Whut?  This is all the same as in a regular BK!  Damn again!  I coulda just left this place and gone to a less busy (and less expensive) BK!  All the same items available at this BK Whopper Bar sans you can order a bottle of beer with your meal!  And dammit, why did I ever think I could order a foreign beer with it?  All friggin' domestic.  Unless you consider CORONA as being foreign (or alien in this case of Star Trek OR Mexican).  Other choices were Bud, Bud Light, Miller Lite, Heineken, or Corona.  Bleech.  Not really my favorites.  Would it kill you guys to have a brew-of-the-week special like Newcastle or Sam Adams??  Ack.

So ok, kill the beer and I'll settle for a soda.  The other perk for the BK Whopper Bar was the fact you can get your burger YOUR way, with additional toppings not available in your regular BK.  But hey, after being starving, standing in a slow @$$ moving line, and seeing skanky beer (and skanky dressed cosplayers), I was not in the mood.  Even more so after seeing the additional cost of adding any of these extra toppings to your burger.  So I gave in and just ordered a damn Whopper with Cheese combo like nearly everyone else before me.  Although I did get an order of onion rings instead of fries.  The setback?  A 'Whopper' of $9!  NINE friggin' dollars!  Oi, yes it is at least for me, expensive for this kind of fast-food slobbery.

The food?  Luckily just as good as a regular BK.  Which is not saying too much.  Whopper with Cheese (lettuce, tomato, onion, extra pickle, light mayo, ketchup, add mustard) for me was just OK.  At least the bun was supple, and the veggies were semi-fresh.  The burger itself though was dry (was probably holding in a tray).  The onion rings were basic but fried fresh, although I wish they had filled the box to the top instead of ripping me off a few rings.  Soda was just a soda (luckily it was a Coke).  I doubt I would have enjoyed this meal better with a skanky beer.  But who knows.

Overall, not much of a 'Whopper' of a time for me.  A fancy BK (ooooo...beeeeer) with the fancy price included.  Though much of the fancy doesn't go to the food or the experience itself.  I fancy that fancy goes with the price of acquiring the liquor license for this place.  BK for big boys, aye, so much potential sucked down the fast-food drain.

Now, I have to admit, I liked the concept of the BK whopper bar.  A build your own whopper bar complete with a plethora of different toppings you would not see in a normal Burger King?  Count me in!

However, for some odd reason, the BK whopper bar had incredibly SLOW service.  Like, painstakingly slow.  I had ordered something simple and they somehow took 20 minutes to get me my food.

I guess since I was there at around 7, they may have been hit by a dinner crowd?  However, it looked like the set up was just not conducive to more than 1 person putting together people's seriously complex build your own whoppers.

I'm sure if BK Whopper Bars can get the set up more like a subway restaurant, this would be a concept that could be taken to other locations.

They were a bit understaffed when I was here, but the service was good. The Whopper was your average whopper. Nothing to outstanding, but if you want something to eat, its perfectly fine.",TOBO9QLOJz9SFWbWolJoxw,0,0,3,XzNhsJIhD9U94gpORFMe_g

They didnt have Blue Moon and since im from Colorado i love my Home Brewed beers. The menu is great. Like the California whopper with Guacamole. And the Angry Whopper. Some toppings are free, others they charge 50 cents for Like Hickory Smoked bacon and Onions which can be raw or grilled or fried like onion rings. Adding a beer for 2.99 to the meal isnt bad. The Germans have had beer in fast food establishments for years. 

Its about time we catch on and hopefully it will. They also have Caramel Sundaes on the menu which i havent seen at any other Burger king. The downside is, when you get a fountain drink, they dont offer free refills.",A2N4y0VeZ-3TtmBVCSVVnQ,1,0,4,a-4IDsjROT4WgPGn2hf3rQ
5583335,2012-08-19,2,idPAwtnvruaB7YivrvFbzA,"I had high hopes for the Whopper Bar.  I mean here was an opportunity for the Burger King franchise to take their burgers to the next level.  Now I did not have unrealistic expectations.  I mean I knew the patties would be the same as the restaurant.  I did not expect gourmet toppings. And I did not expect 5 star service.  However, I did hope that they would have some creative toppings and sauce choices such as maybe a blue cheese crumbles or sauce.  I also expected that they would make the extra effort for quality service and cleanliness.  However, on the day we went, the staff was less than friendly, screwed up our order, and unattentive when we tried to straighten it out.  The prices here are slightly higher than the BK franchises and the reality is you don't get much different of a burger than the restaurant since you can ""have it your way"" at Burger King anyway.

The toppings reminded me of a bad subway chain as they looked wilted and sloppy with mushrooms dripping into other containers.  The angry onions were really the only ""different"" topping on the menu and they were flavorless and limp.

The restaurant itself was not as clean as I hoped. The trashcans were overflowing and the floor looked dirty. The tables were not wiped down well.  I even had a server  who had just walked out from behind the counter refuse to answer my simple question about plastic knives because she was off duty.  No employee was anywhere to be found for about 5 minutes and then they looked at me like I was asking them for an angus patty covered in gold before handing me a sealed plastic knife.

All in all a disappointing end to what sounds like a great concept.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,5,0,2,0VIuckvTpO5s-gozNyDcjA

1)All the employees had their teeth A++++
2)The bathrooms didnt have standing turds from the previous trucker who ate there. A+
3)Its perfect for when you are on your last $10 for a cheap eat on the way out of getting casino raped at the RIO.
4) only bad thing??? Its way in the top back corner and very eay to miss. 
I mean everyone knows, NOBODY KEEPS BK IN THE CORNER!!!",VZDdJXseXVMRIeYiDmdZWA,2,3,5,zI31KLJUJY1sMvIDufECVQ
5812567,2011-10-03,0,idPAwtnvruaB7YivrvFbzA,"Hmm....well it is probably one of the cheapest eateries at the Rio. Also, it is open 24 hours, so that's a bonus. It also serves beer, which is why this is a BK Whopper Bar. They do not have much selection and the food does taste like any other Burger King in the nation. If you have run out of money because 1. you spent it at the clubs in Vegas or 2. you gambled it all away, then this is a place of refuge because at least the prices for food are reasonable (for Vegas that is)",XiFzYeOUdkL1HxVFlPsHSA,0,0,3,_AgFBK1TXWPHlm1BDFGl4Q
