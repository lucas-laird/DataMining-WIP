11425,2010-04-20,2,sSmt7JFTDNCcK1KfMVO2hw,"We went there on a Thursday night and tried the $9.99 steak & beer special. It came with a baked potato and a glass of their house ale. 

The baked potato was good (as if you could screw up a baked potato). The steak was pretty lean, not Kobe beef by any means but what do you really expect for $9.99. It wasn't bad at all, I've had worse and paid more. 

* as a side note, they cook their steaks a little well, so if you like medium, get it medium rare that's what I did. My husband got his medium which was more like medium well...............Lucky for me after 3 glasses of ale , he doesn't get too bothered by a thing like that :-) 

Anyway our server was attentive, the bar tender was personable, and with the patio seating you can't beat Freemont street people watching. 

Their house band was playing, we didn't catch their names but they were really good. The patio also has a little fire pit, it's a nice spot to just chill( pardon the 90's verbiage). 

The ale is a good deal @ $4 a glass, its on the sweeter side but still light. I think it tastes like a sweet Corona, my husband says it tastes like OLD- E, I don't know because I've never had OLD -E and don't plan on it. However if anyone out there has had OLD -E , and tries the house ale @ Mickie Finnz , please let me know if its similar or if my husband is just having PTSD from too much malt liquor in his youth. :-)",TtV527nQhO9ziCMEIhGEKg,1,1,3,ppORQut1PWsr9NFH4oX5Iw

She put $5 in a video poker machine expecting that as is the case with most other places in Vegas, she would get her drink free. She ordered a Crown Royal on the rocks. The bartender said nothing, brought her the drink and said ""eleven dollars""! My wife asked why she was being charged when she was playing a machine and finally at that point he told her ""you have to put $20 in the machine to get your drink on the house"". I have no doubt he's been trained to rip off people in this manner. Rather telling her up front that $20 was required, he allowed her to order the drink and then grossly overcharged her for it. Furthermore, while Crown is a higher end blended Canadian whiskey, charging $11 for a single shot of it is thievery of the highest magnitude.
I HIGHLY recommend anyone reading this avoid these scam artist thieves at all possible costs (to your wallet).

However, it took forever and the  side order was wrong. The server was nice but, seemed to disappear in the kitchen. Maybe she was trying to help. 

All of this was not a big deal but, what made this a bad experience, was when the band started. It was so loud, we had to scream at each other across the table and at the server. It's downtown and most places have loud music but, these guys were pretty bad. They were off key and out of sync. The place was pretty empty so, we asked the server, to get the music turned down. It didn't happen. We even moved to the back of the restaurant. I couldn't get out of there quick enough. I quickly, asked for the check and explained once again that the music was just, unpleasant.

Our party of six landed on this joint. Big mistake! We sat down and after quite a few minutes we were greeted by a server named Jamie I believe. Naturally as we have been in the heat all day we start to order drinks. The first four people order water. Without saying anything to guest 5 and 6, she rolls her eyes and storms away from the table without allowing them to order. We were all completely astounded by her behavior. Seriously? 105 degrees and you're annoyed we want water? We had all planned on ordering beers but we were so disgusted by her crappy attitude we all passed. I wanted to leave straight away but as a group we decided to stay. The mood was extremely awkward for the next few minutes. I don't typically get worked up about bad service however these are friends of mine. My wife and I invited them to come out with us. Not the hospitality we expected.

1102121,2014-06-02,1,sSmt7JFTDNCcK1KfMVO2hw,"Stopped in with a friend for an afternoon bite after hitting the Zappos Downtown Showdown...mostly because it was close by and they had a newbie check-in special on Foursquare: Free appetizer with the purchase of an entree and beverage. My friend and I decided to share. We were told that our entree could only be ordered from a specific area of the menu to get the check-in special.

We ordered the Maui Beach Balls appetizer. Deep-fried balls of something (I think there may have been some shrimp and cheese in them) that came with 3 dipping sauces. They were ""ok"".

For our entree we ordered Baja Shrimp which was described as seasoned and grilled and accompanied by pineapple rice and a vegetable. What we got was some sort of taco plate, which wasn't part of the designated section we were told we had to order from. (I thought it was strange when the waitress asked if we wanted sour cream and guacamole with our grilled shrimp, but I just thought ""Okaaaay..."" and asked for it on the side.) Anyway, I sent it back because that's not what I ordered. 

So then the correct entree showed up. The shrimp were grilled, I guess, but not in the least bit seasoned. Not even with salt. Or garlic. Or butter. Or citrus. Or anything even remotely Baja-like. There might have been a minute amount of pepper. They were flavorless, chewy and dry. They tasted like the wood skewers they came on. The pineapple rice was very pineapple-y but also very dry. The vegetable accompaniment was broccoli, which was actually phenomenal. VERY flavorful.  It was the best thing on the plate.

The service was meh. But we still tipped over 20% because we're locals and that's just how we roll.

Shout-out to Jeremiah, who was on stage doing an acoustic guitar set. He was funny and a talented singer/guitarist. And the reason I'm giving Mickie Finnz 3 stars instead of 2.",LciiVOEKVPZIcOaOqZpMSw,6,2,3,NSRBlFSIEJv6De7yt6ilDA

I returned with a group of ten as The food was decent before and the street side seating is nice.
Service was ok at first but a little slow as the night went on 
Where the problem really was ,was with the food and  supposedly this was a ""whole new menu "" according to the waitress .
Surprisingly   almost everyone ordered the same meal it was a Teriyaki rice bowl .It sounded great rice veggies and chicken . A nice healthy late evening dinner .

When it arrived we were first surprised to see how small it was . Then even more surprised to see how bad it was . The rice was clumpy  like it was premade in the morning .The only veggie was broccoli and it was limp . The chicken was a Mexican style where it was shredded ,and if you put all yours on your plate back together it would have been less than an ounce .When we were asked how our meals were I told her it was probably the worst meal I had ever had . And we all felt the same .
She seemed surprised but not overly concerned . 

When we first entered we had asked to put two tables together and I saw the waitress check with a man sitting near the front . She informed me he was the Manager . I am not sure if he was working but he did sit their the whole time drinking and smoking with some female patron .And that was all he did . He was never informed by our waitress of our review ,and we had waited so long for our bill we didn't bother to press the issue  

If this is a new menu ...didn't anyone try out this dish . If they did ...did they think it was good ? I am sure a high school cooking student could turn out a better more imaginative dish . Was this new menu item designed so as to use less than a dollars worth of  ingredients l . I will only have to imagine what the others items are like based on this one ,as I will not chance trying them .",EokHVWomk-y-W7s5w8Cu3g,2,0,1,t5mhK99vYTpZIS_OpuYgcg

As this place bills itself as a ""fish house,"" my husband got his standard order of fish and chips. The fish was pretty tasty but WAY overcooked. Same with my mini burger sampler. There were four blackened burgers, and I just happened to eat them in order from worst to best: cheese, BBQ sauce & bacon, teriyaki & pineapple, and guacamole. Great guac, but it would have been better served on chips instead of burgers.

Noticed some waitress was texting in the corner by the bar, even some girls clocking in it seemed, even though it was 10pm. Finally our beers came, being so hungry we opted for Chips n Salsa before we ordered any further because our experience so far was not good. The chips came quickly. Guacamole and salsa were great, chips on the other hand were stale.

We had absolutely fabulous nachos, and we ordered these because my Mum had been in Vegas in 2015, and had been here and eaten the nachos. They nachos were loaded with black beans, cheese, guac, salsa etc. and they were fresh, flavourful, and plentiful. Enough for dinner for two (for Australian stomachs at least). I actually ended up going back again, as I went to Fremont St a second time on my trip, with a small group of people who weren't up for trying out one of the cool looking places further down towards the Old Vegas neon signs. If I was back at Fremont St I would definitely eat somewhere down there as my fellow Yelpers had lots of good things to say about a few of them. 

My second time there, I was aware that the food I'd spotted other people eating (and that other Yelpers had eaten) didn't seem great. I wasn't super hungry and I was open to eating a little somethin somethin more when we got back to the strip, so I just ordered the garden salad with ranch and asked them to add bacon and avocado. This was actually a damn good salad! Everyone else's enchiladas, tacos, etc. look so-so. Although one of my dining partners said her steak was one of the best she'd ever had, so huh, who knows hey!

Mickie Finnz, has a great location, you can watch some of the action as people arrive at Fremont St, and as they hop on the giant scales outside of the Heart Attack Grill. Cheap, strong cocktails, but I'd still rather get a margarita from one of the drink stands further down and wander through the craziness.",qrvc-9FF8lpPRW-K0_4w4Q,0,0,3,e33m9ffFhv7b2-ZYWJpKow

Our server was Kate and she was fantastic.  She was very personable and her recommendations from the menu were spot on.  Service was very prompt and everything came out correct and delicious.  

Also, we went during happy hour so we got discounts on booze, (never a bad thing) and discounts on appetizers as well.  

I had the Baja fish tacos and they were splendid.  Beer Battered Cod, with cabbage and a reealllllyyyy good tartar sauce.   yum.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich and she enjoyed it.

2370571,2007-10-17,2,sSmt7JFTDNCcK1KfMVO2hw,"My friend and I came across Mickie Finnz Fish House after searching down Fremont St. for an Italian eatery we saw advertised the night before.  Since we were tired from a lot of walking, and hungry to say the least, we decided to hit it up.  Needless to say, our experience was flat-out BAD.  The hostess lets us decide where to sit, and that a waitress would be on her way (with 1/3 capacity full, it still took her a little over 10 minutes to reach our table, a table seated on the outside with only 2 other cpls/groups being waited on.)  If that's your policy as a business, you damn-sure better be on your shit for service, and this was not the case.  Usually the 3-strike rule should apply, but for some reason we ended up giving her more than deserved.

She finally gets to us and asks for drinks.  STRIKE 1-  I wanted a house margarita, and rather than ask for on the rocks or blended, she jotts it down and proceeds back to the bar.  Fucker.  She comes back about another 10 minutes later with our drinks (noted: our table was about 15 feet away from the outside walk-up bar) but luckily my drink was how I wanted it in the first place.  Still, all this took way too long to happen, which shoulda been a sign to just drink there and eat somewhere else...  bad choice.

So we order our food (split between a ""Shrimp Bucket [sided with fries] and Mahi-Mahi [sided w/ vegs]) and after a cpl minutes decide to walk around a little to look at a map of the area.  As we're approaching back to our table, our waitress, helping another family near the entrance, reinterates our order one more time making sure she didn't get it wrong.  Not that there's anything wrong with getting it right, but isn't that why we write orders down?

STRIKE 2-  Our food comes out, but we've yet to be given silverware nor plates of any kind.  First, the ""shrimp bucket"" was clearly misleading as it had approx. 8 grilled (er, should we say BURNED) shrimp on skewers, and a bucket about  10"" high filled with fries... yes, more like ""FRIES Bucket [sided w/ Burnt Shrimp]""  That's what it shoulda said, else we would've never ordered it!  As for the Mahi-Mahi?

STRIKE 3-  It might have been pan-coconut-crusted but it was pretty much between the raw-rare stages... something, as a waitress, she should've confirmed before, asking how we wanted the fish to be cooked.  It was tasteless and only fared decent with the drizzle of hot sauce provided next to the cold side of veggies.  Oh yes, apparantly the dish already comes with vegetables, and had I known that I could've ordered something different. That constitutes an automatic STRIKE 4!

Oh before I forget, when we have to ASK for plate/silverware, she brings out 1 (yes, one, singular) plate and some fork/knife set that looked just washed.  Not just bringing it to us, she half-heartedly drops the plate in front of my friend.  STRIKE 5!   Then to top it off, she comes back one time only to check up on us, and while I ignore her my friend has the urge to stick it to her about the food, to which she takes as an invite to bring over the manager... we didn't want the manager, nor did we ask for him.  But still, she does it anyway-  #6!  So we end up explaining everything to him, and all he can do is order my friend another Mojito, one that he refused the first time but the manager still persisted to bring out.

As you can imagine, there was NO tipping involved here.  It simply would've felt WRONG to do so.  And I would NEVER E-V-E-R recommend this place to any tourist, let alone neighborhood regular.  If the food was outstanding I might be able to put up with the subpar JV-type service, but even the food sucked.  The only approval I can give is the the fries... those were decent, and pretty big too, but not worth all the other shit thrown in.

2558914,2007-02-26,0,sSmt7JFTDNCcK1KfMVO2hw,"On my crew's past weekend's reintroduction to downtown, one of the places we were required to hit was Mickie Finnz for their fabled fish bowl cocktails.  Unlike the giant 'fishbowl' drinks at other Vegas establishments, I had photographic evidence that this cocktail came in an actual fishbowl with ginormously long neon straws.  This brought me more excitement than should be allowed.

Mickie Finnz is apparently a 'fish house' that is next door to Hennessey's tavern directly on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Fremont, across from Neonopolis.  There wasn't much evidence of fish housery when we went, but the bar was open and a cover band was playing their heart out.  We ordered the fishbowl drink - The Big Surf - at a price of $15.95 a piece.  It touted 64 oz of boozey deliciousness, although we surmised that half of that was ice and another 1/4 pure pineapple juice, but regardless it was tasty and IN A FISHBOWL.  The band played cover band standards by Jewel and Alanis Morissette and my friend Lunchbox (he'd had a few) was popping and locking in front of them all by his lonesome, to the band's utter delight.

Of course, being a restaurant the ambiance was slightly lacking, and the clientele was all tourists save us.  It wasn't the most thrilling place in the entire world, but I recommend it highly if you're as excited as I was at the prospect of drinking out of a fishbowl.

With the food, it was average to below average at best.  Wife and I had the Baja fish tacos and definitely on the lower end of fish tacos I've had.  Batter used was just a little off.  Wasn't terrible but could see others deciding to not finish the meal.  

Guacamole was serviceable but nothing exciting.

So you're reading this thinking well, this should place should probably be getting two or three vs. one star.  Here is where the place faltered hard:  service.

Waitress was regularly nowhere to be found.  When happened to get a chance to interact person was with asked for a refill.  Person said she'd be on it.  Never came back.  Food dropped off but still no refill and now all of our cups were empty.  Asked waitress who dropped food if we could get more drinks and could tell was a little annoyed. Couldn't tell if bothered we asked her or was used to having to assist our waitress.  Waitress comes by to get an inventory of drinks.  Comes back with just my water and said would be getting the rest.  Eventually came back with sodas.  

Asked for check and that took awhile.  Then waiting for the return to get the checks paid.

Could hear at adjacent tables grumbling about the service so seemed to be a restaurant wide issue.

Used to be my all-time favorite spot on Fremont (always for a Painkiller).  Last couple years I've noticed a decline in my drink quality but last weekend was it! 
I was charged $12 for a glass of grapefruit juice (not even an ingredient!) with no nutmeg (they didn't even have any), and when I said it was weak I got charged $12 for a floater (which I swear was watered down to start, and light not dark rum!).
So, I threw a $27 (w tip) drink in the trash.
Thanks Mr. Bartender, your total lack of empathy really made my night.
(Maybe I wasn't clear on just how much I loved this place before. Sure, they have tourist pricing, whatever I don't expect to be treated like a local on Fremont; but I did look forward to my drinks whenever we were going down there, and it was kinda always my motivation to go to Fremont in the first place!

I ordered the quesadilla with chicken and the food wasn't bad at all. It had a good amount of cheese and chicken with guacamole and sour cream on the side at no extra cost!

At first the service was really good. Our waitress gave us water, greeted us and asked if we had any questions, etc. After we got our food though, she was no where in sight for the remainder of our time there. We needed to get the bill so I had to ask another waitress for it since I couldn't find the one we had originally. We paid by credit card and left them on the table for a bit while we finished our drinks and thinking our waitress would come by to pick them up. We finished our drinks and they still were not taken for payment, so I had to ask another waitress for our credit cards to be taken and process the payment. Once she figured out the totals and what not, she came by and even said, so sorry but I have no idea where your waitress went. Coincidentally, neither did we!

A live band began to play soon after we got our food, not too loud for our old ears but just right. Rock classics, mostly, and it got several of us dancing!

We later ordered a fishbowl of something yummy, serving the four of us well.

A cocktail in a fish bowl.

We decide to order the most fizzy, neon, gut-bleaching drink on the menu. The stuff is mostly comprised of rum and some nondescript energy drink. The server pleads with me to not order the stuff. 

""Um. Don't do this to yourself,"" she says with biblical conviction. 

""I have to! I have no choice!"" I exclaim, the collar of my shirt drunkenly crooked and sticking up like ruffled feathers on a limping pigeon. 

""Whatever, man,"" I hear from the now indifferent lips of the once concerned server.

The concoction of well spirits, the juicy innards of a popped open can of energy drink, and the distilled hatred of a thousand future memories is swelling in the witch's cauldron of this gigantic fish bowl. My eyes light up; not from excitement but because the color of this drink is so bright. It looks like the green ooze from those Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies.

My girlfriend and I spend the next thirty minutes passing this monstrous thing back and fourth like it was a medicine ball.

Slider 1 - Pico de Gallo and Chipotle Aioli:  I wasn't expecting this slider to give my mouth a spicy kick, but it did. 

Slider 2 - Tarragon Caper Mayo: Surprisingly creamy, and I enjoyed the flavorful combination of the tarragon and capers. 

Slider 3 - Tartar Sauce: Out of the four sliders, this was my least favorite because of the tartar sauce, which, in general, I don't like. Each slider has a unique sauce/topping, but this one was predictable.

Slider 4 - Dynamite Sauce: My favorite one out of the four. The sauce had a bold, spicy taste. To me, it captured the perfect level of spiciness (can I just order four of these on my next visit?). 

As good as the sliders were, I was still hungry for more food after I finished them off. This might be something to order if you plan on eating light, but don't expect to become satiated from these.

There is option to dine in this patio or walk into the dining area that surrounds the main bar area in the center of the restaurant. Colorful seaside paintings adorn the walls. Electric-lighted paper lanterns decorate the bar. Signature cocktails, beer, and specialty drinks are offered on the menu along with soups, salads, munchies, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, taco plates, seafood buckets, fresh fish dinners, steaks, side dishes, desserts, hot and cold beverages. Atmosphere is cozy with tables and booth type-seatings. Carribean, hip-hop, rock pop music plays when the live band music is not playing. Large TV displays a music channel or sports on its monitor.

The night we dined I ordered the Fish Tacos meal and a lemonade soda which was served in a tall glass...it was sour and sweet as lemonade should be. Not watered down taste. The Fish Tacos here was just right for me (but it could have been better). It was served with chips on the side. The multi-colors of the chips may have put me on a ""good mood."" I wouldn't recommend the soup my Mom and my girl friend ordered, as it tasted salty and was cold. Can't tell you what the soup is named as they themselves decided to just forget about it!, or rather as a New Yorker would say, ""Fohwwwgehhhdtttdabouttitt!!"" My girl friend & I's male friend had burger sliders and he said it was simply good enough to eat. He is the kind of person to eat burgers a lot and he found it just satisfying enough. So enough said with the food!

Mega-jumbo size cocktail can be taken home as it is in a souvenir take-home glass. Just take the second-hand smoke in if you really care to dine here. Otherwise, it's a pleasant experience. The Freemont Street Experience Light Show, people watching, other live band music playing on its stages, variety stores, the entertaining crowd will entice you to linger more around Freemont Street (I'd rather like to go on a culture crawl).",l1CtGHiqB349YrmxjIcgng,2,1,3,CO6-USle3W3h_JFYTC56Kg

I mainly go here late night on the weekends.  The main draw, for me, is the live music and it is exceptional with high marks to my fav, All the MadMen.  The area in front of the stage serves as a dance floor and the servers will clear out tables if you want to dance.

The theme is a Pacific, beachy-surfer hang out.  I assume Pacific for the tikis and palm thatched overhangs.

There are both indoor & outdoor dining.  Also, uniquely, it is kid friendly.  There is no smoking in the establishment, but they do provide smoking areas just outside the main door.  The outdoor dining is divided into a couple areas, some regular tables with full view of the stage that is separated from the main dining area by folding, glass doors which are typically, fully open.  The other area has a fire pit, more table seating and the ""patio"" bar.  If there is a band playing and you want to have a conversation, this area is your best bet.

Food-wise, I typically only get appetizers and really enjoy the bucket of fries.  They have daily drink specials and you can use certain apps to get half-off a signature cocktail, each visit.

Additionally, there is a ""claw"" machine, that, for $2, if you can catch a lobster, they will cook it for you for your $2 Lobster Dinner.  You gotta read the fine print, I suppose.

Cocktails, well, I am not well versed in the sweet drink category, but I do order MaiTais, Margaritas, and have been known to share either of their ""fishbowl"" drinks, the Big Wave (contains Red Bull) or the Biggest Blue Hawaiian.  These are an exceptional value at $20 for a 64oz drink and pretty tasty, too.

Here is a direct link to their menu:
http://www.mickiefinnzlasvegas.com/menu.html

The service i experience is almost always very good.  Partly because I am a regular, I am sure.

My bottom line, the staff is friendly, the drinks are good (and can be cheap), and the live music is amazing.  I recommend it as super casual, night-time hang out, especially on the weekends.",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,6,3,4,ShUy67nd-4OpU3a70Yz3rw

It's one of those places that are going to be busy anyway, so the staff doesn't have to make an effort and it shows. Although a table of 3 left next to us, nobody came to bus it and it remained full of dirty dishes!  Customers kept coming up wondering if the table was open and then walking away!  We should've left upon that observation but we really wanted to get some food in us and it was warm sitting by the fire.  I ordered a strawberry daquiry, it was super sweet and watered down so I ordered a long island iced tea next which was also watered down.  My boyfriend ordered draft beer (impossible to screw up) and I ordered the fish and chips for us to share.  All the while, our server Kimberly did not stand at the table for 5 seconds.  So I wasn't surprised when the food came, that while the fish was piping hot, the fries probably sat out for a while and were not hot.  There were only 3 small greasy pieces of fish.  While I expect grease with anything fried, not enough where they have to be squeezed with a towel.  When the bill came, it was for $74.00 so my boyfriend told me to ask for the itemized bill which she did not bring the first time.  Kimberly said to me pretty condescendingly, ""Honey, that's the part you would sign.""  I said I understand that but he wants the itemized version, she was pretty annoyed we were asking for it.  Well lo and behold, the first bill she brought us was for some other table, our actual bill was only $52.00.  My boyfriend was livid, and a simple apology would've made up for it, but all we got from her is, ""I'm human, I make mistakes.""  No doubt she figured we were drinking so we wouldn't notice.

Most of the bucket is filled with paper. It actually made me mad. Chips and guac. Tiny. Another miss. Chicken wings. Good sized with a lot of meat. Medium means mild. Go hot. Nachos were awesome. Lots of toppings. The best topping was the shredded chicken. I'd definitely order that and the wings again. The only reason they get 3 is the giant 60 ounce pint glass filled with PBR for 25 bucks. It works out to 5 bucks a pint but you get to keep the huge glass. I think I'll use it during baseball season.,85rGU0L7rS1AoSdtxQIKag,3,1,3,3juHGdZasdbqajGJR1Kikw

We also use the certificates from the www.restaurant.com program. (They got wise though; they adjusted the certificate value from $35 to $50.) This is one of the best restaurants in the downtown/Fremont Street Experience area. The atmosphere is a fun beach theme. There are a ton of tv's, indoor seating with booths and tables, outdoor seating with a fire pit, and a bar in the front of the restaurant. We've eaten at the adjoining Hennessy's (same kitchen, different menu & theme- Irish Pub) but I just thought it was alright. If you park in the Neonopolis garage (red), you can get your parking ticket validated here.  

We really like the Nachos & BBQ Chicken Pizza (it's as good as CPK's but cheaper, $9.99). The pulled chicken on both of these dishes is yummy. If you come with a crowd, you can order a couple pizzas, the nachos, and another appetizer for pretty cheap. If it's just me and my husband, we usually bring home leftovers. We've taken many people here and they all like the food as well. I love the nachos- it's my favorite in this city. We had the buckets before, but were really disappointed- the meat was plain, the portions were small, and it wasn't like ""Rockin Baja Lobster."" We wished that we had ordered our favorites.

There are daily specials (two for one deals). One part of the restaurant looks like it's set up for late night entertaining. It's a neat place with cheap food, but when we come for lunch or dinner, it's pretty empty- hope that it stays open. We've had good servers and some not-so-attentive servers. But we overlook it when it does happen, because we like the food so much. Side note: We tried meeting our out of town friends here for dinner but the power went out; that was disappointing, but not the restaurant's fault- it was raining that night.

The many times I have been Downtown I have always passed by Mickie Finnz assuming it was just another bar. I had no idea they actually had food. It is usually overshadowed by Hennessy's - the tavern next door that I used to frequent quite often while trying to max out my Jameson stamp card.

But back to Finnz - basically my friends and I needed food after drinking so much, so actually, this place was perfect. They offer a very eclectic menu, with some sandwiches, ""munchies"" (apps), and ""Buckets"" of seafood. I didn't really care to have a bucket last night so I went for a ""munchie"" instead.

I ordered the Chimichanga appetizers. I did not know what to expect because I was ordering Mexican food at an Irish sounding seafood place. (?) They came out naked aka they were not smothered with red sauce and cheese like you will typically get chimichangas. However, they were deep fried to a nice crispy exterior and hot interior of ground beef. I was surprised by the ground beef - usually chimichangas are shredded, but it did not deter me from eating them. They also come with a salsa, pico de gallo, sour cream, and lettuce. You can basically fork on whatever you like onto each chimichanga as you eat it. The platter comes with four of the mini chimichangas.

Our service was pretty good, our waitress nice. Although it would have been nice to have had our waters filled a little more often. 

Like I said, I need to go back and give it another try. Next time I'll probably go for some seafood and get one of those ""buckets"" of fried deliciousness. For now I am giving the rating of A-OK.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,3,_PI6oJBC7bW0Uq9435o2Ew

We decided this place looked appetizing and stopped in and sat in a booth. We sat for 20 minutes waiting for a server, and when she did finally come, she wasn't friendly and asked if we were ready to order. Now, I've worked in two restaurants so I understand some servers aren't as peppy and we all have bad days. I ordered a Caesar salad and my mom the fish and chips. THEN the food didn't come out for at least 20 minutes and we were already irritated. Server who dropped off the food was pleasant and asked how it looked. Food was decent despite the fish looking a little bland and overlooked. Not once did our server come by to check on us and see how things were. When she would come and fill up a drink, she didn't even stop; she just grabbed our cups and walked away without a word. Then I waited...and waited...for my own water refill. A. Water. Refill. And she barely put any ice. I'm typically not picky but as a server I was appalled she didn't talk to us at all but talked to other people and asked how they were. She was at the bar dancing the whole time we waited for a check...which was probably another 30 minutes. My mom had to get the check and then she came by, didn't say anything, and grabbed it. Then she was at the booth next to us and just dropped off our check without a word or even stopping by OUR booth to drop it. I was beyond angry and I never EVER leave a bad tip because I hate when that happens. But I did last night because it was ridiculous and it wasn't even busy and she treated us like nothing from the start. Will not likely ever come back here and if I do, I'm definitely speaking to the manager or whoever is on duty because it was appalling they let people like that work here.

My friends and I hadn't eaten all day and were looking for good food. After looking at the menu, we decided to take a seat. After a while, a waitress came and took our drink order. About 3 minutes later, she ran to our table, ducked down and stated that she didn't want to talk to the creeper on the patio are so was pretending like she was working. Strike one, she could have been actually working and getting our drinks. We were not amused. There were only about 3 tables of people in the place as well. After she dropped off our drinks, she went back to talking with the guys by the patio (who were clearly just there to talk and not order).

She returned and took our order. I had my heart set on the crab cake sliders, but she said they were out of crab cakes. We went with a bucket of fries, fish tacos, and a chicken quesadilla. Once the food was delivered, the waitress walked away. My friend noticed her chicken quesadilla was actually steak. We waved down the waitress, and she grabbed the plate and said she could bring another. A bit later she returned and dropped off the quesadilla. It was another steak quesadilla...and cold. We waved down the waitress again and told her it was steak again and to just take it off the bill. She looked at my friend and said, ""well then, the first one was chicken"" and walked away. No apology, just attitude. It was clearly not chicken either time. She returned, literally threw the book with the check on it on the table and walked away, saying nothing else. 

We tracked down a manager, who took care of the tab. She also stated she spoke to the server. We could tell, considering she was staring down the table behind the manager. We got up and left, never planning on returning again.

For this lunch, we decided to visit Mickie Finnz as it was national Margarita day.  Don't ask me how we knew that.  Our group is bunch of drinkers and we always know alcoholic Holidays.  

The one thing I noticed is that the decor is either intentionally older or very outdated.  Contrasting colors like bright blue, yellow and red, wooden chairs and an overall tropical theme.  I do enjoy the amount of natural lighting that comes into the restaurant.  The bar is airy and there's ample seating.  

For lunch, I started with a Suntan Martini for $8.00.  I know it was national Margarita day, however, I'm a bigger martini fan.  Remember that if you check into Foursquare, you get 50% off of any signature cocktail.  This martini has coconut and pineapple rums mixed with tropical fruit juices, then shaken.  Super sweet cocktail so be advised.  For lunch I got the Giant Fish Sandwich for $10.95.  This sandwich had a huge cut of beer battered cod, with lettuce, red onions and tomatoes all on a toasted French roll.  This dish is served with tartar sauce, tortilla chips and salsa.  This sandwich was on point!  The cod was perfect cooked, super crispy on the outside and flaky and juicy on the inside.  The tartar sauce perfectly complimented the fish and sandwich as a whole.

None of us ordered appetizers. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos. They came with a dipping cup of blackbeans. They were tasty and spicy, but the little cup was a joke. Two of the people in our party returned their Surf N Turf because it was cold, not luke warm, but cold. Another person returned her food because the bacon was more raw than cooked and her sliders were also cold. We were not all about to wait another hour for their food to be recooked so they ended up eating some leftover nachos from someone else in our party.

Our waitress heard all of our complaints out, but definitely didn't care that much. She helped with what she could and was pretty busy.

Been here for 29years and tried many restaurants in this valley... THIS is by far the worst food I have ever tried! For a fish spot this had to be the worst seafood experience I have ever had.

Their crab dip was disgusting! Old and burnt and just gross. The shrimp enchiladas were DRY and cheese-less.  Just a horrible dining experience! I know it is downtown las vegas but any place downtown even the hotdog stands are better than this place.

I would not, could not recommend this place for anything else other than the live music as you  WALK BY!

We even did shots of nice Patron and they were still comped.  Sat at the bar which is right by the open windows, had a nice breeze, gambled, drank, watched football [notice the underlying tone of 90% of my reviews], enjoyed the nice day.

I ordered a fish sandwich with no bun. It came with tri-colored nacho looking chips that I ignored, did try the salsa and it definitely was 'overworked' it was more like a sauce then a salsa.  But the fish was pretty good...pretty sure it was previously frozen but you aren't going to get 'fresh' Mahi Mahi in the desert. I put some lemon on it as it was a little plain [maybe order it blackened].

Friend got the fried fish tacos which he said he liked. I will have to agree with Mark Z here, he also got black beans and rice and boy were they bland!  Definitely not cooking it up Cuban or Mexican style, it's white boy bland. A little Goya Sazon would do these up much better, maybe some peppers and onions [talk to the Havana Grille they got some black beans going on!]

We gambled= 2 drinks, 4 shots, and 2 meals our total bill was $21.00 with tax [not tip]. We tipped pretty well since we didn't get charged for drinks and good service at the bar.

Good burgers, nice, funny staff, their lounge area is excellent to just sit back, and people watch (not to mention that great fire pit of theirs), live music....  All of that is well and good, but that's not my favorite part.

""What is it then"", you ask?

Drinks served in coconuts carved to look like monkeys.

For $12 mere dollars, you can get an amazing coconut carved to look like a monkey.  Not to mention that there are various types of banana liqueur drinks served for said amazing beverage holder.

The first time I went there, they were sold out, and that made me sad.  Last night?  I was getting that monkey, by gum.

So in I went, ordered it, and walked out to a surprised patio full of friends and unrelated patrons.

""I drink out of coconuts now"", I said after a mighty sip of banana booze.  ""Coconuts are cool"".

And you even get to take the coconut home, which means that I get to be cool any time I feel like it.  They'll have to pry this drink amazement out of my cold, dead hands before they can take it away from me.

This update is sad.

This place should just be called Mickie FINISHED.

Had a great time here before. Not this time.
We took some relatives from out of town here while they visited Fremont.
I am actually embarrassed we took them here. I felt so ashamed having to explain how cool this place was a year ago after the service and food we got. Its pretty much over priced under par bar food, for out of town- drunks who know no better.

Everything started out fine, till our food took really long. There were only 3 tables of people in the place, and a few on the patio. It wasn't busy. AT ALL, Tuesday night.

We saw another angry table of people complaining that their food was taking forever. So we complained a little too. They really had no excuse, the place was dead.

As soon as the bitching started they jumped into action swarming our table like bees, filling our water cups and such. Not sure why we had to bitch to get this kind of service. It was soo awkward and embarrassing. The manager jumped in and served our food. They really tried to accommodate us, and we did appreciate that. But like why do we have to ask for service? Made everything uncomfortable from there on....
The food tasted bleh. Not worth the gas I got later on. The shrimp and chips were frozen shrimp, and if they weren't geezus help us cause I don't know what that was. My aunt ordered a pizza, and it was like something you would get at the skating rink. My cousin got the sliders, huge bun , turd sized burger with no taste. 
The chicken in my nachos tasted like cat food. ( forgot to order no chicken - it was my fault.)

This place is either going to shut down, or get a visit from Jon Taffer and the show Bar Rescue. If that does happen I hope the first thing he does IS TAKE AWAY THAT HORRIBLE LOBSTER TORTURE TANK. ANIMAL CRUELTY AND ITS SOOOOO DISGUSTING TO WATCH PEOPLE TRY TO CATCH HELPLESS ANIMALS WITH A METAL CLAW. 

I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN. AS LONG AS THAT INHUMANE  LOBSTER TANK IS STILL THERE.",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,1,0,2,6tpS4WWEb8dSUrYxYp8i8w

3 Stars is pretty good for a place like this.  
Good selection of beers and specialty cocktails.
My wife had the Baja Taco's. Her comment was finally enough red cabbage on a fish Taco to get the peppery flavor.
Our other guests had burgers and a wrap.  They both enjoyed them and thought the serving size was right.  Both boys thought the tater tots were very good.
I had the Atlantic Ale Beer Batter Fish and Chips.  The batter was a little heavy for a beer batter, a little more beer in the batter would be helpful.  The fish was cooked properly but the batter of over fried and oil was dripping out when you bit into it. Maybe oil temp to low and they left it in to long?  I'm not a fry cook so not sure.

Although the live music is great and our server was super friendly, the food is totally flavorless. And let's be real, you're here to eat. Not to listen to music and make friends with the bartender.

Our party of 3 ordered the chips and guacamole and the mini sliders to start. I'm not sure how you make guacamole taste like bland avocado mush but this place achieves that tasteless flavor. Yikes. The sliders were dry and burnt but still incredibly pink inside. How does that work out? All the ketchup and mustard in the world couldn't make these sliders taste good!
