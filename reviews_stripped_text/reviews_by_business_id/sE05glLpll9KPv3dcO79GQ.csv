10933,2013-03-20,0,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"Ok been waiting to get home to write this.

Me and my wife and youngest daughter were staying at the Fremont Hotel and decided on eating there as well.  We went down stairs and walked into the Paradise Buffet, my wife asked the cashier how much for my 6 year old and she informed her it would be full price, without my wife even asking the cashier took it upon herself to waive the cost for my daughter, all 36lbs of her.  She even cleared it with a male manager.

We proceeded to be seated close to the buffet which was nice since I was hobbling already from over doing it walking on the strip earlier that evening.  As soon as our waiter came by he asked about drinks I told him 3, he asked how many we're eating and I again said 3.  He looked at the receipt and noticed we payed for 2.  I told him what the cashier had done and he said ok and walked away.

5 minutes later a female manager walked over and told me we would have to pay the $17.99 for my daughter to eat.  I said I would talk to my wife and we would handle it, she said ok and left.  Our waiter, who clearly must have ownership in the buffet came by again and was looking for the receipt that we paid for my daughter, I told him we had not yet, at that time my wife came to the table and informed him that the male manager had approved it, our waiter/owner said the manager has no right to approve, such a drain on the business and cash income of such a struggling establishment, ok he just said the manager had no right to approve that.

So now our appetite is ruined, we are pissed and I want to kill our self important arrogant bastard of a waiter.  But after he and his favorite manager went and spoke with the original manager, who apparently COULD approve such a thing, they dropped it and left us alone.

The food was ok, not great.  The service was ..... Well let's just say this, never never never never again.",fKIlgxxRLW5u2z-tcBmYTQ,0,0,2,7H-uQSTEEqlC2Ih_F27MyA

I took a walk from the stage and found myself lost in a different time zone.... Did I fall through a time rift that brought me back to the early 80's hmmmm...... I like the music and the TV shows were great but I digress.

No time rift no alternate universe on Fremont Street.... Nope I was in the Paradise Buffet... A look back into a culinary error (sorry mean to say ERA) that has long past on the Vegas strip but is alive and well in on Fremont Street. 

Atmosphere- Interesting if you like that vintage diner feel... (yes plastic flowers and all)

Service- Great!!! Our server was right there as soon as I put down my fork or hit the bottom of my glass with the the following line "" Go get some more"" and ""Let me refill that for you"" The Hawaiian shirts and the flowers in the hair I guess you can compare to ""flare"" that you see at other restaurants but it just fit right in with everything else. 

Food- Ummm hmmmmm well It was ummm homey and not in a bad way the items on the buffet were ALL very identifiable from the iceberg lettuce salad (really) to the cold cuts (really really) to the make your own taco station. You knew what you were getting yourself into from a culinary standpoint and did not have to ask any question about what an item was. More then likely you have had it a few nights ago for dinner. 

All in all great place to sit relax and enjoy some comfort buffet food that you WONT see on the Vegas strip... ANYWHERE and that is not a bad thing.",ArhCAg5KRRwg9qxvLWR3Jg,0,0,3,s8lh37wf8SOZalPjtVlPhg

57609,2009-04-12,0,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"When was the last time I was in Vegas? Yesterday!  Had dinner in the Paradise Buffet in the Fremont Hotel.  Cheap eats caught my attention.  Buffet with NY Steak cooked to order.  Hey, why not!  6:30pm and there just a couple people ahead of me to pay before entering.  It felt like I was lining up on the cafeteria line back in the days of elementary school.  But can't go wrong with a $26 dinner for two.  
Endulge....all you can eat!  Went straight for the roast beef roast and mash potatoes.  Not bad.  They advertised sushi but it was only limited to tuna rolls (small strand of tuna surrounded with rice and wrapped in seaweed) - California rolls (Not good at all) - Somesorta roll (didn't know what it was but didn't take anyway and the shrimp nigiri.  Overall selection was not good for sushi.  New York Steak - 6 oz Grilled to medium rare.  The chef cooking it was more entertaining than the steak.   Crab legs were good.  Not the biggest but they were good.  The selections were good for the price.  Gotta love the soft serve ice cream.  This was not bad tasting considering I've tried some that just tasted like frozen milk.  I was too stuffed that I didn't get to try the Tacos, duck, and hot food items.  Salad bar was decent.  Dessert selection was okay with the different pies and cakes.  And the slices were sizely okay.  If you want to stuff yourself with a budget......go.  Don't expect much from though and you'll enjoy the experience.  The filipino servers were on top of their service with following up on drink re-fills even though I didn't need one, pre-bussing and extra napkins.  Would I go back?  Maybe not considering I have to experience all the other buffets in Vegas.",FKo3JR8g7e1PPpBDFxh0Pw,0,0,2,6lUd0eTaKikjEsyEQqrbDw

408923,2011-09-27,0,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"Definitely not one of the best buffets I have ever been to. But, my parents really wanted to for the AYCE crab legs & shrimp, AKA seafood night on Tuesday's, so I had to humor them while they were in town for a visit. My Aunt & Uncle who were also in town played it a little smarter & went to Hash House at the Plaza :P 

The place as a whole is a little depressing & the selection was just ok. I'm not usually a fan of snow crab legs, just because I feel the reward is not worth the effort of sitting there & trying to crack them open. However, I was mildly impressed by the fact that the legs here are already split for you & ready to go. Wow! And...they actually tasted petty good. I tried both the cold & the steamed...pretty tasty. 

I wasn't very happy with the shrimp though, They were really bland & not even lemon juice, butter, and cocktail sauce could help :( 

Also, we had a really bad waiter & I had no compassion for the fact that he was an old man. I really wanted to sock this guy in the head! & I will just leave it at that. 

The 2 stars is actually pretty generous, but I have to give it to them for splitting the legs for you already.

There was no way I was going to drive or bus to the main strip for dinner, and I settled for this--which was a big mistake. I went on a Thursday night so there was no ""Seafood buffet"", however, there were crab claws, smoked salmon, and various choices of meat...which were questionable. As a sushi fan, I looked forward to the sushi, but was disappointed as they were the same quality as the pre-packaged sushi found in the supermarkets. The salad choices, or lack thereof, were extremely mediocre and so were the choices in fruits. In the middle of my dinner my stomach started rumbling which is a huge red flag to stop eating, so I did. However, I was sad that I did not get to try the some-what delicious-looking dessert collection, but I am pretty sure I would have been disappointed. The two stars are for the price ($9.99) and the quick seating service (which could be explained by the lack of people that were there).

532833,2012-01-11,0,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"The Paradise Buffet is a nice small, inexpensive buffet on Fremont Street at the Fremont Hotel & Casino. I was not very impressed with the decor. It is like sitting in the middle of a jungle. It is quite bright in a colorful way. A bit on the gaudy side to me. But I look forward to going back again. There are a few things there that make me say that. First of all was the service. I sat down and within moments someone came by to take my drink order. When I sat back down after getting my first plate my beverage was there and the glass never went empty. I don't mean that I didn't drink much. I mean that before my glass went empty each time a new glass was brought to may table. Every time I finished a plate, cup, or bowl within moments of me setting it aside it was whisked away. I am very surprised that for a small hotel buffet the service ranks as high as some high priced restaurants I have been in.

Another thing that surprised me was the quality of the food. I was not expecting such good food. The buffet is not very big but what they have is big on flavor. The roast beef was succulent and had a flavor that lets you know what a good beef tastes like. It was also very low in the fat department. I have been to some places where their beef was fatty and just ruined the meat. The Mexican lasagna was one of the best low cost dishes I have ever had. I am quite impressed with the food quality.

It has all the stuff you'd expect of a downtown Vegas buffet including shrimp cocktail, smoked salmon, snow crab legs, half shell oysters, prime rib, etc etc etc.. (prime rib was overcooked and tough so make sure you look at the color and how many strokes it takes the carver to cut your slice).  Good salad bar.  Desserts are okay.

Food taste and quality is definitely 3 stars but overall it is a good deal and has lots of selections.  In my opinion having fancy seafood is not an indication of culinary skill, though it is a must have for a buffet of this caliber.  (It isn't hard to thaw a couple cases of precooked split crab legs or to blanch and shock a couple hundred pounds of shrimp in a steam kettle for shrimp cocktail.)  

Ambiance is festive and fun, but verges on tacky with its plastic flower tropical theme.  Its a turn and burn buffet so don't expect much service so i'm not going to even rate that aspect here.

The Paradise Buffet at the Flamingo Casino and Hotel is one of the most sorry excuses for a buffet and the second-worst buffet I have eaten at in Las Vegas.

The buffet is hard to find, hard to get to, the selection is limited and the food just isn't good. While most buffets in Vegas pride themselves on seafood, the Paradise Buffet had very little of it.  

The center portion of the buffet is dedicated to shrimp cocktail and crab legs, but unlike the Aria Buffet or other top venues, the crab legs are not cracked open. This buffet also has some sushi, but it is dry and had been sitting out for a while. The sushi selection was also very limited and was the worst I have had in Las Vegas.

The rest of the buffet was nothing more than home cooked items like pot roast, macaroni and cheese, Caesar salad and boneless chicken. It was almost like an expensive, glorified Old Country Buffet. But at least with OCB, you didn't have to pay like $20.

Of course, if you check-in on Foursquare you can save a few bucks on the buffet. But it is Vegas, and who wants to stand in line to save money on a buffet. Just put that five bucks into the machine instead and let it ride.

Sure you saw this one coming, but come for the bulk, not the quality.  I sampled the shrimp pasta in cream sauce, the roast beef, fried chicken and some stir fried vegetables from the Chinese station.  It was steak night but I didn't like the look of the steaks they cook up in the center station weirdly next to the desserts which is also oddly where they put out sushi.  Pasta was meh.  Vegetables were meh.  Fried chicken was unbearably salty so I just ate the breast meat which was dry but I hate wasting.  Roast beef from the carving station is tasty!  If I hadn't discovered the chilled peel and eat shrimp and had three plates of those, I would have gotten a slice of my own.  They marinate the shrimp in bay spices and just enough brine to flavor them.  Squeeze three wedges of lemon on those and I'm in heaven!

1) sushi should have been set it with fewer pieces so the rice wouldn't be as dried out as it was.

2) salad bar seemed fresh enough but I didn't even bother with that...had to leave room for everything else 

3) cold bar had oysters, crab, peel and eat shrimp, and a few other items I wasn't sure about. The shrimp were good even though I had to peel them.

4) hot bar was another story. Pasta (didn't have any), ribs (pretty tasty and adequate meat), crab (yummy but it would have been nice if they were at least pre cracked or crab crackers were available, I ended up using a fork), breaded shrimp (ok, nothing spectacular), breaded clams (I was really looking forward to these but I was disappointed, they were rubbery), corn was good and the seafood bisque soup was probably the best part of the meal!

5) dessert options were plentiful but the couple that we tried were a bit dried out, but still tasty.

Well, looks like this place still has a relatively cheap buffet.  I was actually not of drinking age when I came that time and it was the first time I had Cherries Jubilee, which I loved.

Getting seats for 6 seemed to be a challenge.  We were directed to the back and was told someone would be waiting for us to seat us.  Alas, no one was so we just seated ourselves.  What appeared to be confusion as another server asked us if we were supposed to be seated there or not.  Turns out, it was the right place.  Anyway, we waited....hmmmm... quite a while.  It seemed longer withTWO antsy toddlers who weren't shy about declaring their state of hunger.  The waiter hurriedly walked by and said he'd be right there.  He appeared to be on the verge of a hissy fit.   
We waited AGAIN even longer.  Finally, annoyed with the wait since we had just arrived to Vegas after roadtripping 5 hours, I walked over to the waiter station and asked for someone to bring us drinks.  
A minute later, our huffy server shows up with no greeting and asks us for our drink order.  We were already ready to order.  
Again,  another long wait.  I looked at my watch and noticed it's been over 20 minutes with NO DRINKS!  This has been my worst experience at the Fremont Hotel.  Again, I walked over to the wait station and asked for assistance. 
About another few minutes go by and then our drinks arrive.  No apology or explanation about the delay.  
Then our food arrives.  Now, the food was ok.  The American cuisine was pretty good.   But how do you screw up a patty melt or fried saimin noodles anyway? The Asian iterations could have been better.  The Korean ribs were not authentic.  Ok,if you like your bbq really sweet or never had true Korean marinated ribs.  
We noticed patrons who arrived long after us who already received their drinks and their food arrived at about the same time as ours.  NICE....
While we were finishing up our food, the server tells us he's going on a break and that ""so and so"" would take care of us.  Well it was a while before we saw this person since usually, we're introduced to the new server.
Anyway, this new server couldnt have been nicer.  She had a friendly disposition and almost simulataneously, hubby and I exclaimed we should have had her as our server plus our original server was going on a break?   It appeared he went on a break while we waited for our drinks.  Funny thing is, we devoured our food and was out of there so soon after we received our entrees.   
The new server was more empathatic and tried to explain how slammed they were with a new cook and that the previous patrons gave our server a difficult time.  My point was that it doesnt take THAT long to bring drinks and explain the situation.  Plus, why are we being punished because of other high maintenance sh**heads!!!  If the food was really crappy, I would give 1 star but the buffets I've experienced in the past were decent.

The casino has a lot of advertising that boasts all you can eat prime rib and etc. After paying and getting seated for dinner I saw that prime rib is the only thing people were standing in line for at the service stations - and with GOOD reason. 

The bf grabbed some sushi which I was too scared to try. I touched the rice with my finger and it was a sticky, rubber like consistency - a sign of bad rice. I didn't even want to try that. 

I grabbed some mashed potatoes, prime rib, sweet yams with marshmallow and bean soup. Everything except for the prime rib has the consistency of mush as it had been sitting on the hot plate for a long time. The bean soup tasted really terrible and left an aftertaste in my mouth. 

The prime rib was the only attraction here as the meat was juicy and decent for the price paid for the buffet. People were like vultures waiting for the prime rib and I had two people cut in front of me as we were waiting for it to come out of the oven. It's obvious that people come here to eat plates and plates of this meat.

Fortunately enough, my aunt went there first and waited in line.  By the time we walked in, she had already gotten us the table.  As you walk into the Buffet, the lighting is a bit dim and dark.  However, you can see and navigate.  The atmosphere is laid out like a safari or jungle.  Imagine the RainForest restaurant with no animals.  Unless, you think the large buffet people are hippos, elephants, or tigers grazing on the buffets...hee hee...

The wait staff was not that great.  For some reason, it looked like the casino has cut back on staff.  As a result, the service was a bit too slow for my taste.  Also, some of the utensils (i.e. crab breakers/nut crackers) were not available.  Need to stock up people!

As for the food, I headed straight to the king crab claws and was sorely disappointed, they were a bit frail and thin.  boo hoo... shrimp was okay... and I don't want to really talk about the oysters.  Let's say this, one look at the oysters and I had to sadly walk away.  It was puny and a bit too old for me.  

On the flip side, they had a great pasta layout.  But, it was the various ""creole"" sauce that stood out for me.  They had a clam sauce, a shrimp etoufee creole sauce, and another light creole flavor sauce.  It was pretty good.  The salad bar was okay.  However, the desserts and the fruits were very sweet and good.

Overall, the price per person is about $18 on seafood night.  If it was not for the creole sauce, this place would have received a lower rating... honestly, Asia buffet is still hands down my favorite...

An old electronic board hangs above one of the tables and displays todays date as of january 14 1998. The board is however sadly not the only thing that's stuck in the 90's. The restaurant's interior screams tacky early 90's design, perfectly in harmony with the staff's hideous flower patterned shirts and dresses. How the owner hasn't thought of making a design change here is something I will never fully understand.

But the main part here is of course the food. I can honestly say that this is the worst buffet I've ever been to and I've been to plenty. Went there for prime rib night and was or course looking forward to trying their advertised prime rib. It was extremely blend and reminded me of the crappy pieces of meat I used to get for school lunch in first grade. The lasagna, macaroni salad, crab salad and even the desserts all tasted like last week's leftovers. Even the bread was stale and terrible. 

Also, as a nice surprise afterwards, I'm pretty sure I got food poisoned from the buffet. It ruined the whole evening afterwards and I'm not surprised now when I see that other fellow Yelpers have been food poisoned from there as well. 

When I left the place, I wanted to stand outside and warn people from going in there. My girlfriend literally had to stop me from doing so by dragging me away. 

So please, whatever you do, avoid this place at all cost. It's not worth ruining an evening or your whole trip because of the restaurant's cheap prices.

This place is still great and has become a Las Vegas tradition for my friends and I. We stop here every time our trip coincides with one of the seafood nights (Tuesday and Friday). The soup of the day rotates and it is always a special treat when it is the clam chowder. The cold seafood continues to be the highlight of this buffet although the hot foods have gotten slightly better (although not enough yet to make this a 5 star buffet even at the very affordable price). We have turned many of our friends onto this place and the 11pm closing time is great for our friends that drive in from Southern California after work on Fridays. On our last trip, the crab legs were no longer split. I prefer them split as it makes them easier to eat, but I know others feel unsplit crab legs retain their taste better. The biggest surprise was that they now have added snow crab claws. They were delicious despite being a little hard to eat (although once you learn the trick they're easier to eat than snow crab legs even with the harder shell).
_______________________________________________________________

This was the surprise of my last trip. I really wasn't expecting much since you never really hear about any downtown buffets outside of the one at the Fremont's sister property: Main Street Station. Well, we were hungry and the seafood fantasy night sounded good so we decided to give it a shot. 

The room it is served in might be described as tacky by some, but I really like it. It has that old school feel. This is actually where Trent and Mikey ended up eating after losing all their money in Swingers. That movie does not come close to capturing the feel of this room. Plus the service was pretty good. 

The main draws of seafood fantasy night are the snow crab legs (split for easier eating), oysters, and peel and eat shrimp. The crab was pretty good. The shrimp tasted good too, but they were seasoned and I would have preferred them unseasoned. The oysters were awesome. I ate about a dozen and my friend had 2 dozen. I'm sure others in the buffet had more. These oysters were small, but tasted good and fresh. They were as good as any other oysters I've ever had; just smaller. I usually am weary of buffet oysters, even the Rio's famous seafood buffet has terrible oysters, but these were good. They also have a small sushi section which was pretty basic shrimp nigiri and California roll variations. I'm surprised they didn't have more variety. They also have a clam chowder that no one notices because they put it next to the honeydew melon. I had actually finished eating and wanted to get a few pieces of melon for dessert when I noticed it and got a bowl. The chowder is very good. My friend said it was the best thing at the buffet. He ended up skipping dessert and eating another bowl of the chowder. Actually, instead of using the little chowder bowls, he grabbed an ice cream sundae bowl from the dessert station and got himself a huge bowl of clam chowder.

The other items in the buffet are also mostly seafood. Nothing really stood out except for the trout which was very good. Some of the items were a little on the dry side such as the lasagna that had almost no ricotta and the seafood enchiladas. I would have preferred it if they kept more of their regular dishes instead of doing so many seafood dishes on seafood fantasy night. I like a little turf with my surf and the only items that weren't seafood, bread, or vegetables were the meats at the carving station and the fried chicken.

All in all, I was really impressed by the quality and price.",DgrkaxfNoMP1nGGrDcpkOw,2,0,4,8BtNLRdRPAVrMMmocKS3qg
1986396,2016-04-07,1,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"I am one of those old veteran longtime Vegas visitor that can still remember these awesome $7.00 buffet at the Stardust Hotel and Casino (this place has been torn down, by the way). Those days are long gone. Now, Vegas has turned into this expensive culinary experiences that will cost you in the range of $35.00 to $45.00 per person at hotels like Paris, Trump, etc. There is a restaurant where the hamburgers are $75.00 each. What?! 

Anyway, this no-frill buffet offers a variety of dishes for a relatively cheap price. I believe we paid $15.00 per person for dinner on the weekend. The wait was about 25 minutes which was not bad as compared to the likes of the Buffet at the Rio.

Wasn't this place called Lanai's in the past?  My friend who's also from the islands goes to this place all the time.  So, when I went to Vegas with him, he had nothing but good things to say about this place.  The secret?  Bypass the Buffet.  All the mainlanders eat the buffet.  But if you're from the islands, you have to eat at the Paradise Cafe in the back.  The lighting is dim, but who cares, I don't like people watching me eat anyways.  I've actually got in a fight with people who stare at me.  Anyways, go back there and be treated to the REAL island food.  Spam, rice (the sticky kind that's washed - not the minute rice that no self respecting islander would ever touch), Portuguese sausage, etc.  If you don't wash your medium grain rice and then measure it with your finger, you might not be using authentic sticky rice.  So, I walk into this place and see this nice buffet spread.  My friend tells me to keep walking and leave the buffet alone.  So I do.  We end up in the back at the Paradise Cafe where I see nothing but islanders eating.  This place MUST be good.  So we sit down and our waitress come around.  She has an island accent so I know this is going to be good.  What does everyone order?  Spam, eggs, and rice.  Now, I don't know if you know this, but the islanders like to eat.  So, when they bring our food out, it's overflowing over the plate.  They put a full can of fried Spam, a dozen eggs, and 2 cups of rice on my plate.  I also ordered Portuguese Sausage.  This is some good stuff.  The waitress keeps coming by asking if we want anything else.  Heck yeah.  We need more rice.  She hooks us up on the rice too.  She brought out a BIG bowl of rice so we can finish our Spam and sausage.  I can't finish my food, but everyone else doesn't have a problem with it.  For some reason my friend also ordered toast with it.  Toast?  Why not more rice instead of toast?  I think he sold out.  I keep looking around and it's nothing but islanders walking in.  She comes by to see if we needed anything else but we were good.  We then start asking her about some local island/asian store around here that we can get portuguese sausage.  She starts to tell us about some place that everyone goes to.  I was tempted but since I live in Cali, it would have gone bad by the time I got home.

The sushi was not sushi. It was a shitload of rice surrounding unidentifiable gray stuff. That's not an exagerration for comedic purposes.

The peel & eat shrimp were small and flavorless. The shrimp with shells on were seasoned and actually really tasty but messy. The crab legs were typical buffet crab legs.

I stopped by since they advertised fresh sushi for the dinner and the sushi was not very fresh at all. The rice was slimy and they packed a ton of rice with a small amount of fish. The selection of rolls was pretty pitiful - they had tuna rolls, shrimp nigiri and a roll with seawood inside.

I went on a Sunday night which was ""prime rib"" night. The prime rib was tender and they had all the condiments you would want with it (parmasean, horseradish, etc) which was good.

I loved their Mexican section. They had some mildly spiced carne asada with fresh cilantro as well as guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, lettuce and more. I was able to make an awesome taco salad.",51G0a8V8TO3eoau4aUT-tg,0,0,3,1cRH9d39TshKsgLkNY0hWA

The decor is dark wt mirrored walls but nice enough with big plush comfortable booths wt strong direct lighting on the table good for reading a paper.

I hit up the sushi bar first and the rolls are large cuts and limited to cali, tuna & some mystery roll (?) the wasabi was dry and had very little kick at all. I accompanied the rolls wt peel & eat garlic shrimp that had been cooked then iced down and it had a mushy texture wasnt very nice at all. The crab salad was tasty enough and helped make the roll a little better. Overall a big disappointment.

Next up was the Mexican station and I made a plate of ""Super Nachos"" wt a bed of crispy chips wt a hearty spoonful of pulled pork, ground beef and pulled chicken in a tomato sauce & added guacamole, some refried beans, mexican rice and sour cream. I ended up  adding some much needed salt & mixing it all up and it was better tasting than when I was picking at the individual sections. This was better than the limited & lame sushi station. I had also got a pc of fried chicken and it turned out to be on the cold side and I stopped eating it.

Next up was the chinese station  offering 3 or so dishes of Beef Brocoli, chicken in some sauce wt thick cut onions & peppers. I tried both combining them and it was OK. There was some Lo mein and Chines noodles I passed on and NO spring rolls.

Last up was desert and the selections seemed many and looked quite good. I tried the Coconut cream pia wt some soft serve ice cream and it was good enough to have 2 pcs. There was more cream than coconut filling but at least the crust was good.

This was kind of pricey coming in at around $17 and not really worth it at considered the lacking quality and offerings. I might add that this night I went was ""Prime Rib"" night and while I didnt try any, it looked OK.

I doubt I will be going back if I'm in the area and will stick wt the Golden Nugget over The Freemont as the quality was in line wt the price.",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,1,1,2,wLNj89-tBdhgpzjZbPIl-g

It was a Friday night, which meant Seafood. The seafood buffet was $20.99 per person. We were all hungry, so we made the best of it! My friend and I had a strategy... and that strategy was to ONLY EAT SEAFOOD!

The 2 stars for this review definitely goes to the Giant Crawfish! I HEART CRAWFISH! So... GUILTY, I had about 2-3 plates full of crawfish =X. There was also crab legs, which were alright, extremely small. I did enjoy the smoked salmon and fried oysters. The peeled shrimp on the other hand? They were BAD...

2566358,2013-01-10,1,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"The thing I love about Vegas is for the price of a appetizer you can eat at a buffet.  Paradise Buffet, located in the Freemont Casino, is your stereotypical cheap Vegas buffet with tons of food items but lacking in quality

Parking:
Parking available in the Freemont Casino.  

Atmosphere:
Kinda tacky. Think of dark rain forest, mirrors and green vinyl booths. All that and a big buffet.   I'm pretty sure this restaurant was featured in ""Swingers"" as the place the guys got dinner after they lost the money at the tables.

Service:
This restaurant is both a Buffet and standard restaurant service.  For the handful of times I've been service has been fine without complaints. For both the Buffet and standard service waiters have been attentive and fast. If you have any problems its just getting into the place where if you go buffet you pre pay.

Cost:
So for the Buffet it ranges from $7-8(breakfast & lunch) to $20(Tues night Seafood).  For the most part the standard buffet you're going to get your money worth for $14 although for Seafood night you could do better.  For standard restaurant service  most food ranges from $6-11 so depending on what time you go and what you want to eat it might be a better deal just to get the buffet.

Food:
Like many Las Vegas buffets the food is just alright.  Well at least nobody ever got sick when they were with me.   I think the weekend breakfast brunch was my most favorite just do selection.  The times I've been the dessert selection was rather good.

Conclusion:
Paradise Buffet is just your typical Vegas cheap buffet. Nothing amazing but your also not breaking the bank to get some food.  It's a bit tacky but if you get by that then its definitely worth it for breakfast or lunch(weekdays)",9fF_T3pQu3ay1oA7h_VYNA,2,1,2,ZP5qskp-v3Mg-GVBSs3Ryg

considering, price, quality and taste.

I have been to this buffet several times for breakfast
only and can truly say it is very good for the price 
and I look forward to eating here every visit.

 The price is one of the lowest in all of Vegas and 
weighing all out this buffet has good breakfast and 
considering Mc D's and Burger King is about $5 for A 
breakfast that is small and cheap, you get reasonable 
bacon, eggs, freshmade to order tasty omelette's with 
fresh eggs cracked right in front of you, fruit, veggies, 
desserts, shrimps, salads, and much more for A very
 low price.


 This is a buffet that has reasonably good food that is 
very good for the price, and I recommend their made to
 order omelettes so you can pick what you like and 
have it made in front of you.


In conclusion, where on earth can you get quality fresh 
made unlimited omelettes, bacon, eggs, fruit, bacon, 
sausages, desserts, and so many other options that 
are reasonably good in the year  2015 and after for less 
than $8 bucks with a server bringing you unlimited bever-
ages and on top of that all items are reasonably good
and tasty.  All in a nice nostalgic dining area with nice
plants to accent the paradise theme?  To expect expen-
sive gourmet food for a low price would be unreasonable
in my opinion. 

Try other buffets and you will pay double for similar food.",rzuptU3XPsUl2UOVoWeHPQ,3,0,4,c9TxyTC9F1rT7We5U57O9w
2751246,2012-08-19,0,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"This is a tough review for me to write.  The food was mediocre, which come on, is what you expect on a buffet, and if that were the sum of my experience at the buffet, I would have given the Paradise Buffet more stars.  

However, I am 99% sure I had some bad oysters on the buffet.  Which, shame on me, I live in Louisiana so have no business eating oysters in the middle of the desert 1500 miles from The Gulf. 

So, that was a downer.

But, I'm a lover of kitsch. And the Paradise Buffet has this in spades, in an un-ironic, before the hipsters took over sort of way.  The dining room looks like it is a leftover set from The Golden Girls, but with more tropical floral patterns and crystal chandeliers. 

Now the food itself.  I went to the Seafood Spectacular, or whatever it's called, and  had a coupon.  There were piles of seafood in every direction.  And they split the crab legs for you because as Americans, that's something we can't even do anymore.  And like I said, aside from the suspected bad oysters, it was all mediocre, so just kind of meh.

If you're set on having seafood, you could do worse.  But, if you're just looking for cheap eats, head across the street to The Four Queens and chow down on the $8.95 Prime Rib Dinner, which was actually very good.

Price vs. Quantity: 4/5
Food Taste: 3/5

I've eaten at Paradise Buffet twice now. Both times I've had the same experience which was just O.K. So they get props for consistency. The biggest draw point for this buffet is the price. It's one of the cheapest buffets I've been to. The food quality, however, is lacking.

The restaurant interior is a little too dim for my taste with a cheap tropical feel. The place is clean though which gets points since it's a buffet and those tend to get dirty. The wait staff shows up sporadically, not the most attentive.

The best thing they have is hands down the fried shrimp. It tastes delicious, especially with some lemon and cocktail sauce. They are pretty large in size and fried to a point where each bite provides a crunch. The taco bar was pretty impressive too. They have numerous taco toppings including some refried beans. They weren't the best taco you'll ever eat but it was unlimited so I was satisfied.

All the Chinese food is mediocre. Most of it is dried out or lacking flavor so I would personally steer clear of that. The sushi is extremely limited in variety. They have a neat little salad/side bar that has various things like pesto pasta salad, ambrosia salad, seafood salad and more. I was actually pleased with that because it gave me a lot of things to try, all of which were so-so (except the ambrosia salad which was great).

They had a stewed meat which was definitely noteworthy as I don't tend to see stew at buffets and it was pretty tasty, but not very tender. The desserts were a nice surprise for the sheer variety that they have. It's more typical stuff like pies and cakes, so don't expect anything unique. The flavor of all the desserts is about what you'd expect, almost like a store bought flavor.

If you're on a budget and not picky then give this place a shot. You probably won't walk away thinking you just had the best meal ever, but it beats paying $30-60 a person at a buffet in the strip.",uwavnlkvnttiDEbrNXYgvA,0,0,3,MDx_Iis08Xtx8YsHWBaCOQ

Our champagne brunch was quite nice. We each asked for orange juice with an extra glass so we could mix our own mimosas, and the drink waitress looked surprised but complied. The orange juice was great and fresh tasting, so the mimosas were a highlight.

The prime rib was good. The delicious Korean chicken was the best thing I tried. The lamb was only okay. I didn't much care for the stone crab claws (my least favorite kind of crab). The peel-and-eat shrimp was very pleasantly spiced, another winner. The seafood bisque was okay; the soup itself was good but the plentiful seafood was not very appealing and brought it down a notch. (Fake crab, a few tasteless scallops, and tiny shrimp that didn't seem to make any difference other than to give you something to chew.)

The hash -- apparently a big favorite of Hawaiians -- was only adequate, straight from the can and heated the bare minimum. The sausage was okay. The bacon was the best bet among the breakfast meats; but if you like your bacon crisp, you won't like it. The array of lox and fixin's for bagels looked pretty good, but we didn't try it. 

The pecan sticky rolls looked marvelous but were unfortunately disappointing. If you like oatmeal, there is a great selection of toppings. There was the usual huge array of buffet desserts.

Lucky for me I had great company so I put up with it.
We got seated and went up to the buffet. This was the smallest buffet selection I have ever seen. (which I guess could be good because the food was awful.) I took a little bit of the buttered noodles which were so hard and crispy. nothing like a flimsy noodle should be. The beef in the asian dishes was extra chewy. I sampled some of the taco meat, mexican rice, and beans mixed all together on my plate and got a piece of plastic in my mouth. yes, you read right. PLASTIC in my food. I was instantly turned off from anything else. In order to please my party I ate a slice of pineapple, some cottage cheese, and the wimpy salad bar. As for dessert in the ice cream section they give you warm bowls. it melted my poor vanilla ice cream into soup.

The one thing I do love is their breakfast buffet!!! I always get the omelette at the omelette bar. From that 1 omelette, you can already get your money's worth. Their fruit is always fresh and sweet! Their pancakes and belgian waffles were also amazing! Freshly made as well, so it's fluffy and soft :) 

Their dinner buffet; however, did not impress. I went on their Steak night and that was pretty good. Cooked to order however you would like. Got my money's worth on that. Their Chicken Marsala was also good; it wasn't dry...phewf! Those were the 2 things that stood out to me. Everything else was average. I didn't like their soft serve or froyo or whatever it was. It's more like ice milk? 

Also, if you want to do a la carte items, their Ox Tail Soup is really good and the portion is HUGE. Great flavors. When I got the saimen, it was soooo salty. I took out half the soup and added hot water. And even after adjusting the soup, I was soooo thirsty that night.

Pros: snow crabs legs are pre-cut to allow easy eating. Service was good. Plates were whisked away and drinks refilled rapidly. Selection of seafood items was surprisingly broad.
Oysters, peel and eat shrimp, cocktail shrimp, scampi, fried shrimp, fried calamari, cioppino, crawfish, smoked and prepared salmon, tilapia, mahi mahi, trout, mussels, maki, and sushi, maybe more I'm forgetting

Cons: most items were just good or ok. Nothing was great and a couple of things ( scampi and cocktail shrimp ) were yuck. Desserts uninspired complete with soggy canoli. Smoky atmosphere bothered my asthma, but this is Vegas, so that isn't a fair complaint.

Both of us has been here only once and didn't remember the experience from the previous experience.

The restaurant lounge has a very lush a floral-like decor to give you the impression of being somewhere exotic & tropical.

The food islands each have its own setting of food variances.

One is dedicated to freshly cut fruits, an assortment of melons and other well knowns.

There's a salad and cold cuts section with an assortment of premise salads like macaroni or potato salads.

In the middle, there's a build your own burger or hotdog station. It's a little confusing since you have a hot station for burger patty's, hotdogs, grilled onions, bacon strips, etc. 

The buns are located next to it and yet May and ketchup or cheese is nowhere to be found. Also, there's a soft serve ice cream section which is sort of in an odd place. The remainder of that island is a lie and dessert section hosting Apple, cherry, blueberry pies and the other end a variety of cakes.

Along the back wall is the hot food station.

Beef bourguignon, mashed taters, roast or fried chicken, roast turkey or beef carved slice by slice, fried rice or plain, potstickers, cornbread etc.

Also know that there is also an ala cartel menu that provides specific meals - half of it is for our Hawaiian O'Hana who may want local island fare.

Not too bad, the food was good, chicken was juicy, the customer service was amazing.

One fun story, after making my first plate of food, I walked back to my table and set my plate down, before I sat I was already starting a conversation when I looked at the other person and realized I was about to sit at the wrong table.

Enjoy!

If this is the biggest and the best I would truly hate to see the others.  We were here on ""steak night.""  Price was $14.99/person.  I think you get a $1 discount if you have a players card for the casino.

I should probably preface this review by saying we ate at Bacchanal a couple days prior to eating here at the Paradise buffet.  I knew we would not get the same quality of food as at Bacchanal, but good lord... The salad bar was kind of gross.  Their ""fresh meats and cheeses"" section was packaged lunch meat and Kraft singles (probably generic, not even Kraft).  I am not kidding.  The hot food section was... limited.  I think there were maybe 10 food choices total with a meat carving section in the center.  One of the meats available was ham.  They had a maybe 2"" thick end piece of a ham sitting there that was dry and crusty.  They never replaced it the whole time we were there (which, granted, was not long) and it never got smaller, which means no one else was foolish enough to ask for any either.

Being that it was steak night we expected to see steaks.  Well, there were some very thin cuts of steak being grilled.  They ask how you want yours cooked but there's really no point - the meat is so thin they're all well done.  As far as the other hot food went, the only 2 things I actually enjoyed were a baked potato and a fried chicken leg, neither of which was worth $14.99.  They had a porkchop dish that was downright disgusting.  I did find a basket of nacho chips and a pot of scalding hot cheese sauce.  These were edible and I did like the fact that the chips were thick.  I saw some sushi but didn't get anywhere near it.

Dessert... only the sugar free items were labeled so we took a couple of things back to our table to try (hoping to figure out what they were).  We tried two different pies that had absolutely no flavor, a piece of chocolate cake that was kinda rubbery, and a slice of cheesecake that my husband deemed ""ok.""  We left the desserts on the plates with small bites out of them.  As I was walking through the restaurant I noticed several other tables with plates of desserts on them that looked exactly like ours.  The service was just ok - we had to wait a while for someone to come take our drink order but our plates were always cleared promptly.

Bottom line, pay more for a better buffet on the strip.  I wouldn't come back here, even if it was free.",zbahX7xiLbjWWM4_L43lhg,2,0,2,oC0vy8Cj3xCL6XqBX87URQ

The desserts were not impressive.  They had a lot of choices to choose from... cheesecake, pineapple upside down cake, custard pie... but none of them were that great.  I just stuck with the vanilla soft serve and oreo chunks.

3445181,2012-11-14,0,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"This is the cheapest buffet that I considered in Vegas, but you get what you pay for. Plus, parking is only free if you get a validation, so remember to save your receipt.

Granted, this place is in the Fremont Casino on Fremont, instead of south on the strip with the better and higher end casinos. I figure that is why this place is cheaper, but the food was not that good and the dining area could have used a good remodeling. Basically, this is in an older casino in the older part of Vegas that is last on the list of where tourists visit.

I also do not recommend getting there at the cut-off point between breakfast and lunch, because there is a several-minute delay in when the lunch items are brought out. When we went there to pay, we were told that we had 2 minutes left in the breakfast buffet and if we paid for that, then breakfast items would be cleared soon and we could not get any of the lunch items. And so we opted for the lunch buffet. Really, is the food police going to care whether I grab breakfast or lunch items?

I went ahead and grabbed a few breakfast items anyway, such as pancakes, bacon, and country-fried potatoes. The bacon had little to no taste, but the pancakes and potatoes were pretty decent. Then when some lunch items came out, I helped myself to those. The best thing there was the chicken breast.

Service is practically non-existent, and we ended up having to grab our own silverware and condiments. At least they took away dirty plates in a timely manner.

This buffet may be cheap and the best in the Fremont area, but that does not factor the strip into account. Next time I would pay the extra few bucks somewhere down south.",ymHWBFAlntT0IZ1KNu4CXQ,0,0,2,yWPy2hy4hmo4kNfV5e-h7Q

The steak night is not a piece a meat sitting in a warming tray. It's s steak cooked right in front of you to your liking. For the $15.00 tab the quality was very good and the rest of the buffet items were tasty as well.
Keep in mind we're talking one or two steaks cooked to order plus dozens of sides for the modest $15.00.
Other Boyd properties offer prime rib buffets as do most of the other
Hotels in town and you can pay all the way up to the $50 plus range.

Let me start by saying that we ate here for breakfast on our first wedding anniversary, circa 1997. I discovered this cherry pastry that I thought about for years afterwards.

Yes, that was 18 years ago but there's a chance it might still be on the menu...right?

We saw a big sign from the freeway that said Free Parking, so we made our way to the outdoor lot. It turns out that you have to pay $3 but you can get validation and a refund at one of the many downtown casinos. The trick is to hang on to all the receipts & slips of paper the attendant hands to you. Keep it handy. We made our way inside the Fremont Casino and saw a sign that club members receive special pricing. Considering the fact that signing up for the card is free, why not? When the cashier handed my husband his new card, she instructed him to stick it in the machine and spin the wheel for a prize.

Guess what he won? Buy one, get one  1/2 off of a buffet. Eating breakfast here seemed to be our destiny. It's tough to pass up $11 for a buffet for 2. 

It was mid-week in October and we were seated right away. Our beverage waitress was very attentive and kept our coffee and waters full. That's where the stars stop for me. The mediocre sausage was cold. The pancakes and eggs tasted like they had been sitting awhile. There was a station where you could order an omelet but it had a pretty good line and I wanted to get on our way. If you find yourself here, that is definitely the way to go.

I avoided the canned fruit cocktail and selected a few pieces of fresh melon. The honeydew was fresh and tasty the cantaloupe was rock hard.

Remember the magical little cherry pastry I dreamed about for 18 years? Gone, replaced by lackluster little dry cinnamon swirls and puff pastries with more air than flavor. I was so sad.

We were told to go back to the cashier to get our parking validated. Remember when I told you to hang on to all the paperwork in the lot? This is where you will need it.

3904428,2012-11-08,0,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"The Fremont Casino boosted that its' buffet is the ""biggest and best"" in the Fremont area.  Okay...that really doesn't say much since it's probably the only buffet in town.

I came here for the buffet since the price was hard to beat.  Buffets on The Strip were charging $11.99 up to nearly $35.00 so at $6.99, I couldn't resist.  Soon the phrase ""you get what you paid for"" kicked in.

First off, I came here right between the breakfast buffet cutoff.  The guy at the counter gave me two choices: either pay $6.99 for the limited breakfast buffet (whatever they haven't put away) or pay $7.99 for the lunch buffet (in which I was not allowed to eat breakfast items).  I didn't fully understand that kind of mindset but just to be on the safe side, I opted for the lunch buffet.

Once seated I noticed how dark, dingy, and outdated the dining area was.  The booth that I was sitting in had rips on the seat and the carpet was pretty stained.  After a few minutes, a server came and asked about drinks.  He brought the drinks to the table and I never saw him again.  In fact if I needed something like utensils, condiments, or extra napkins I got up numerous times to get them myself (*boo*).

It was 10 minutes until they bring out the lunch buffet items and yet I sat there not sure what to do.  Since I paid for lunch, I was told that I can't eat breakfast items.  And yet the time at the paid parking structure was ticking and I was quite hungry.  Since there were still a few breakfast items out, I went for it.  From what was left I got myself a sliver of cooked ham, one slice of whole wheat bread, half a spoonful of country potatoes, and (worst item ever) a very small amount of ""eggs"".  Nothing on my plate was appetizing but the ""eggs"" were just inedible.  It was not real but powdered ""small curd cottage cheese like"" eggs that tasted nowhere close to the real thing.  I had a forkful and discarded the rest.  The bacon was another story...not sure if it was a pig.  It tasted like cheap bacon with absolutely no smoky taste to it.

After what it seem to be forever, lunch items were brought out at 11 a.m.  Again the selection of food wasn't the greatest but I did like the grilled chicken, pork chops, and salad.  They had a ""build your own"" burger bar in which I grabbed myself a meat patty only.  It was fairly good but dry.  Fruit bar was also good but one side of the bar was completely empty and it stayed empty.  If I were to point out the ""shiny star"" of this buffet, it would be the dessert.  Many sweets to choose from and I did like the coconut white cake.

For what it's worth, I got.  It's not bad but it can use some improvement.  The size and variety of the selections can be bigger but I'm not really a fan of absent service and no acknowledgment.

I went up and walked the line to see what they had.  It's not one of the better Boyd casino buffets.  They did however have some rare prime rib and that was my first stop.

I went back a second time and got some salad and other items that are different than other Boyd properties including pulled pork.

The dessert selection is OK.

My husband and I were walking down Fremont Street, when we saw the sign with the prices for this buffet. They were definitely appetizing to our wallets, so we walked in to see what it was all about.

We didn't go in that day because we had already eaten, but we do keep in mind for the next time we came. We ended up coming again, and went into the buffet. We paid under $20 for both of us, and ate very delicious.

Their selection was good! Since it was the day after Thanksgiving they did have turkey and him, but they also had things like fish mashed potatoes fried rice lasagna salad shrimp soup etc. etc. 

We're going back today, because when we went last time we didn't have enough time to enjoy it. This time we're going to sit there and enjoy it!

4014506,2015-11-20,3,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"Mom was in town from Maui for one of her famous gambling 'binges', so since she was staying at the lovely Fremont Hotel & Casino in Downtown LV we ended up going to the Paradise Buffet.  Friday night, Seafood 'Fantasy' night!

But alas, it was all just lackluster.  I'm sorry but I even forgot to take pics of my encounter with this lacking buffet.  I know for many tourists (especially Hawaii folks) just a buffet in general with all-you-can-eat crab legs is an endless wonder.  But when you're an LV local like myself you kinda expect more from your buffet!  Paradise Buffet was just borderline OK for me, not much I could find outstanding.

The crab legs are decent and plentiful at the buffet, but most of them are cold!  I like my crab legs warm, but there is not really any station setup for them to serve warm crab legs.  I don't think you can hand one of the chefs your plate and ask them to steam them for you either.  Wouldn't that be funny!  All I can say is please don't try this.  Do not interfere with an already disgruntled, busy chef.  That's asking for trouble!

Most of the other offerings at Paradise Buffet were lacking as well.  The baked fish was alright, but after sitting under the heat lamp too long some pieces were tough.  Just FYI, if you go on a Friday night, it is mostly SEAFOOD being offered!  So if you're a meat-only type of person this is not your night.  Although they do serve a nice prime rib with au jus, which probably was the best thing I ate that night.  Medium-rare, extra au jus, and creamy horseradish on the side?  Made for some good eating.  But this is Las Vegas, every casino here has some kind of prime rib...it's practically a staple!  

The other seafood choices didn't impress me much.  The fried clams were either soggy or overcooked.  The pasta was eh, just pasta.  And the Mexican offerings that night were NO BUENO.  Just flavorless.  Don't get me started on the sushi that is served RIGHT NEXT TO the soft serve ice cream machine!  Talk about fusion!  Unfortunately the sushi was just plain terrible, dry rice & suspect raw fish.  Even the basic Cali Roll was falling apart.

Besides the prime rib, the only other saving grace at this buffet for me was the sandwich station located at the salad bar.  Yes, the sandwich station.  Make your own sandwich with thinly sliced ham, turkey, or roast beef!  Then pick a cheese or 2!  I think only cheddar & mozzarella was offered that night.  A roast beef & turkey sandwich with cheddar and a ton of mayo helped save my sanity.  It wasn't gourmet, but it was familiar. 

Hardest part about this buffet for me to swallow is that it's like $22 per person, that's with the B Connected players card!  Without the card it's an extra BUCK.  For me the value just wasn't there.  You can go to a local Chinese buffet with all-you-can-eat crab legs and still pay less than you would here.  And you can get Mongolian stir fry included!  And the very same soft serve ice cream machine.

Sorry to say Paradise Buffet, not impressed.  You're not bad, but for the price I would have rather have gone to a Station Casino buffet for less.  It might not have the crab legs but I could have done without them.  But don't get me wrong, the tourists love you!

First off, we were only fourth in line and it took almost fifteen minutes to get in.  They had one woman working at the register, and she kept ignoring the giant line to serve the people coming up to the ""preferred"" line.  She didn't smile and was generally unpleasant.

Then came the food.  In a town where there are buffets with literally hundreds of options, this particular place only had maybe 12 different food selections aside from the salad bar.  The roast beef was cold, the crab legs were so thin there were basically no meat in them and the sushi was lower quality than what you would expect to find at a local 7-11.

Just when we thought it couldn't get worse, the service was something just as bad. After waiting for a refill for quite some time, my cousins wife asked a server for a refill and she responded with ""what do you want?"".

According to the menus that were hung everywhere in the casino that meant that it was prime rib night which I was eagerly looking to.  I also noticed on a ton of signs that is was the largest buffet on Fremont Street which is interesting since the Golden Nuggets the next morning seemed bigger.  As we were walking into the buffet I was quickly reminded of some Rain Forrest cafes that I had been to.  It had those large palm trees as well as some other lush tropical looking plants.

The food at this buffet was just ok.  It actually reminded me quite a bit of the Golden Corral, lots there but no quality to it.  Yes there were peel and eat shrimp and crab legs but they were fairly meager which I guess is indicative of the price here.  They are had a random collection of other ethnic foods including a taco bar, sushi and random Chinese food.  Finally the prime rib.  What can I say about the prime rib?  Was it really prime rib or was it another cut of a tougher meat?  I have never had prime rib with the amount of connective tissue that was in some of the pieces of meat that I had here.  With that being said I really enjoyed the Cajun-esque seasoning that they put on it and I went back for more 3 separate times.  The desserts were really where this place shines as there were a ton of them and what I had was pretty good.  I ended up having key lime pie sans the crust and some carrot cake and both we pretty tasty.

The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  It's not the worst buffet that you can get downtown but its not the best either. I guess it all depends on what you want your price point to be and what kind of quality you want in your food.",4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,1,0,3,9ShrM9VWZ6lC-z0wZb17XA

We were all dying of starvation and heard about the awesome buffets on Fremont street, so we chanced it on the Deuce to see what we could find. We picked the Fremont Casino because let's face it, we were on Fremont street and it was poetic. 

Here we got the champagne brunch and I do believe it was $11.80 with tax. Other people here are saying like $7 but I didn't see that at all, maybe I was too smitten with the words ""champagne brunch."" 

I worked on stocking up for the apocalypse at this buffet. I think I had bacon, sausage, eggs, waffles, french toast, and some fresh fruit for breakfast. After that we digested for a few minutes then I had prime rib, mashed potatoes and gravy and then some ice cream for dessert. Impossible? I think not. The french toast was surprisingly good and the sausage was awesome too. Another big plus was the mashed potatoes and gravy, I know I shouldn't fill up on carbs at a buffet but they were SO GOOD! And let's face it, I got my money's worth any way you slice it. 

They came around for drinks and I decided to make my own mimosa, ordering orange juice and champagne. I emptied my champagne into my OJ and then when I came back from the buffet again there was more champagne in my glass! Thank-you champagne fairy! 

The atmosphere was dark and just funny. It's being paradise and all it was tons of fake plants, but it was so great for a Vegas buffet. We didn't regret our choice at all and we could barley walk when we left. And yes, I would consider that a glowing review lol.

They do tout themselves as a ""seafood"" buffet, but... that seafood wasn't looking too hot, so I stuck to the carving station.

And, of course it wouldn't be called a champagne brunch without the champagne.... that they bring to you in these awesome plastic champagne glasses (not flutes, but the older saucer lookin' ones).

4308573,2013-07-16,3,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"I've never really had a good experience with buffets. Paradise Buffet and Cafe Restaurant reminded me why I avoid them.

Yes, it's Vegas. Yes, they are known for world-class food and excellent buffets. Just remember that NONE of them are located in Downtown Las Vegas. 

The establishment is located in the Fremont casino. It's large and maze-y with roomy booths. The decor isn't vintage; it looks like a 1980s highschool set for Wizard of Oz. There's alot of green.

First off, our waitress didn't know what half-and-half was when we requested it with coffee. She kept pointing to the french vanilla creamer already on the table. I already had a feeling I wasn't going to like this place....

They had a decent variety of food from American hot-dogs and patties wading in gray, hot water to Italian pasta, dried out from the hot lamps to ""Chinese"" stir-fry that could rival any MacCormack seasoning packet available at most grocery stores. I opted for jambalaya, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and beef roast from the carving station. I've never had jambalaya before (at this point) so wasn't sure what to expect; it tasted okay:lots of sausage and my friend told me it tasted like it came from a can. Can you go wrong with mashed potatoes? Yes, even Paradise can! When I attempted to add butter to the flavorless mash, I could only find margarine...Ugh, isn't anything real here? Not too surprising, after all, they didn't have half-and-half... Everything ersatz! 

Fresh fruit and a piece of apple pie for dessert. Pretty sad when the fruit was the best part of the meal. 

Lunch buffet cost about $9. A bargain, one might say, for a ""Vegas"" buffet. All the strip buffets were starting around $30.

There's a reason why the restrooms are located at the exit of the restaurant with large, brightly-lit signs. Now, I love food, and if that food disagrees with my digestion but it tastes delicious, I'm willing to give a little leeway. When I eat a less than mediocre meal and additionally have the inconvenience and discomfort of immediately needing a restroom, I am not a happy camper. In toto, six out of our group of eight ended up in the restroom. The women's bathroom was clean, however, the males in our group recounted a disgusting state of the men's restroom.

Why 2 stars in stead of 1? Although the entire experience was sub-par, there is a possibility our 6 days of Vegas binging finally caught up to us and contributed to our sickened state. Even without sickness, not worth $9.",6IS1bmoc9A8SMgf2mhsxjA,3,2,2,0rCShqRpckDEjLFk1pgbPA

If you're a Hawaii local and you remember the oxtail soup from Kam Bowl/Asahi Grill Keeaumoku, but now you're on a trip to or relocated to Vegas, then this is the oxtail soup for you! Forget about going to the Californian. I mean, really, oxtail soup does not have celery and carrots and peas. 

This is the authentic oxtail soup where the meat falls off the bone. Generous sized pieces with boiled peanuts, water chestnut, mushroom, chinese parsely (cilantro) and a side of grated ginger and two scoops of rice. My only complaint is that the water chestnut pieces are large, rather than using slices. The broth is flavorful and to top it off, it's inexpensive compared to the other local food establishments at other Sam Boyd casinos.

4480969,2017-10-25,0,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"Overall, okay food for the price of the buffet. 

First, we were able to get a discount because we had coupons and ended up getting the specialty buffet for $10 - for that price you can't go wrong with filling up on food. However, the taste and selection? Okay at best. 

We went on seafood night and had called ahead to make sure they had crab. We originally wanted Joe's Crab Shack, only to find out they closed, ugh. Their Crab selection was abundant but tiny crab. The cold crab was the largest but flavorless - soaking it in hot butter was my solution. They had roast beef but looked so deceivingly like prime rib - they even had horseradish and au jus! But don't be mistaken, it was nowhere near prime rib. They say they have sushi bars, but they have a small sushi section - maybe 3 plates of selection. That is definitely not a sushi bar. 

You can order off the menu as well, which we did for my daughter because they said she can't have the buffet  very questionable there but okay. It's very limiting on selection. She had your basic eggs bacon and rice - can't mess that up right? Overcooked scrambled eggs and mushy wet rice, that's just horrendous. She ate bacon and fed her again later, so disappointing. 

Service- the cashier at front tried to charge me for 6 buffets when we had 3. No customer service at all, just a rush through and no smile. Working in some form of customer service means a bit of common courtesy - I know very well it's taxing to deal with all types of people, but knowing what you're signing onto and the fact that you want people to come back. Our waitress was pretty attentive most of the time, no complaints there. 

If the buffet costed more than $10 I would not return again. Regular price is $25, so without a coupon I would not return. You can find many other buffets with better food.

The husband looked puzzled.  I turned to my mom and said:

""Do you think she told her husband about all the cash advances she'd been taking out on that card?  I bet she's so out of control, she can't keep track.""  (evil laughter)

Mom: You're terrible (but she laughed with me)
Me: The apple don't fall far from the tree
Mom: (pause) You're adopted (evil laughter)

I ate turkey and roast beef, shrimp scampi, salmon, and Louisiana style seafood stew.  lasagna, California rolls, peeled shrimp, and a little salad...the healthy part.  I had lemon meringue pie, key lime cheesecake, and a mini eclair. 

Me: Okay, I'm full.

The second funny thing was this little kid kept running around the buffet line and the manager chasing him down to scold his parents.  The last funny thing is the woman who took her sweet time and had to make everything neat on her plate.

Food to eat:  Roast beef and creamy horseradish sauce (be careful it's spicy), hot crab legs and drawn butter, mashed potatoes with gravy, fried rice, oysters, peel and eat shrimp with cocktail sauce and fried chicken.

Food I would pass on: Shrimp au gratin (definitely frozen shrimp), pasta, salad bar (everything was old and wilted), sushi (warm and flavorless), tacos (no just no), cold crab legs (not sure why they were serving some cold) and about half of the desserts that could possible be frozen and defrosted before being put out.

Few more minutes go by and yet another hostess walks by, and I again plead for a glass of water. She stops, picks up the receipt, and says ""you haven't even been here that long, your waitress will be here soon."" She proceeds to go stand by the podium and do nothing.

FINALLY my server comes over, no apology for the wait, no nothing..just a glare at me and ""what do you want?""

I wanted to say, I'd like to eat at a place where the servers aren't bitches, but requested a water and juice. A glass of water was thrown down and juice was served.

Food was marginal. The cook at the omelet bar was friendly, but that was it.

So what attracts the eye as you stroll down through the casinos? All You Can Eat Prime Rib Buffet for $13.00.  Now if that doesn't get your juices pumping I don't now what does.  SO with that said, A group of us went there to give it a shot as we were clueless as to what else we want to try and figured the buffet would give us some options.  We walked into the line and there were quite a few people ahead of us (good sign right?).  The food there definitely matched the price we paid for it.  Now I am not the one to judge solely on a few items and by looks alone so I decided to try at least one thing from each section.  

First the good part: the Prime Rib was pretty tasty.  Not the best Prime Rib, but hey, I can't complain at this point.  It was definitely was savory and I was lucky enough to get it fresh when it came out.  If you decide to eat here just load up on this, you'll be happy...trust me.  The desserts were the next highlight.  The soft serve ice cream rivals that you get from a Souplantation with minimal toppings (fudge, nuts, strawberry in thick fruit sauce) but you can't really mess up when it comes to ice cream.  

The bad part: The sushi can definitely be skipped at this place.  I normally don't have high hopes for sushi at buffets but this one is nestled right next to the soft serve ice cream dispenser and cakes.  Again minimal selection and the the rice that was used was spongy.  I mean..i can take a little stale, but this just felt like I was eating something artificial.  

The rest of the food was below par (tried the fish, chicken, chow mien, and yams)....cannot comment on how it all tastes cause it was all just pretty much the same consistency as everything else.  If you are looking to save a few bucks, get some steak, and maybe load up on juices I'd say you can come here.  But for me, I think I'll spend a little more time trying to find a better eat in the Fremont Experience.",uQo6NDy7akFhFDWS9dpipg,1,1,2,wwEtPO0Wu_rOFYp1-GBtsA

I enjoy buffets immensly. I think it's the idea that I can keep going back to try many things all for one price and I know that that's why I enjoy The Paradise Buffet so much.

First of all, the place is dirt cheap, even by Vegas standards. 8 dollars for lunch anywhere is pretty good, but in Sin City, it's an outright steal. Plus, it's cheaper than Hometown Buffet, slightly more gourmet, and best of all, void of annoying children running around eating nothing but jello and pudding.

While the selection is a little on the low side, the food is actually quite good. The roast beef was rare and flavorful, the mashed potatoes were thick and fluffy, the salad bar was full of green, fresh lettuce and a great variety of toppings for it. They even have an option for your own burgers and hot dogs. 

The atmosphere is defiantly jaded (but so is most of old town Vegas) and yes the waiters/waitresses seem to be on the tired side, but those are things I can easily overlook when it comes to cheap, tasty buffets. You can spend 35 dollars on a buffet at the Wynn or you can drive 5 minutes up to Fremont and have lunch for next to nothing...and keep all that extra money to win big on their cheap tables.",DgKw46Xo1U38zXI7FN5Vsw,0,0,4,NjYZWodOjAWbSpeTDXttRA

We were still indecisive if we wanted to go here or the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio.

It was a decent buffet and we had no issues with it.  

Server was efficient and clear our table of the dirty plates on a timely matter.

Crab Legs were good overall.   I ate a ton of this today.  3 platefuls.  No complaints whatsoever.  But some people might be expecting top tier crab legs or something and be disappointed when they go here......not me.  The crag legs are not cut in half, you do have to work for them.

Got my money's worth and then some. 

Dessert selections were decent and my wife liked them.   

I got some hot food selections to eat too, not too shabby. 

Again, we were happy and satisfied by coming here today.  No complaints.

We've been to the more expensive buffets on the strip which have more selections and choices, but if you were eating crab legs like I do most of the time...then this is a wise spot to go when it's served on Tuesday & Friday Nights.    

Otherwise, if you want a huge selections of choices such as street tacos, ethnic foods such as asian foods, large selection of fruits......go to the pricier buffets on the strip.",s07kSB4LD1Ml9Sj7E7lPpw,5,2,3,SVl4odAOLCeG2T5r1F9oFQ

Not until a friend from Hawai'i who was in town said she heard this is THE place to get the best oxtail soup in Vegas. We'll see. Btw... when rating oxtail soup, I'm spoiled with homemade Jamaican Oxtail Stew. Stew over soup all the way. 

Okay, before I get into the oxtail, come here for the cafe NOT the buffet. 

The buffet is gross and it has limited selection. PLUS, the cafe line is shorter. If you're looking for a buffet in DTLV go to Main Street. If Main Street has a long line (usually Fridays for crab legs, get there before they open, if i'm not mistaken dinner opens at 4pm) If the line is long there, go check out the DTLV restaurants outside of the casino area. New and delish spots opening up. :-) They're walking distance. 

TIP: Usually there's a line and wait at The Cal's cafe (Market Street Cafe), so come here if you want Oxtail soup. 

The oxtail soup bowl - Comparing to The Cal's... Paradise Cafe's has a larger serving for a regular size, the photo doesn't do it justice! More oxtail, more vegetables, nuts (nice touch), more cilantro and green onions. It comes with a side of ginger and two scoops of rice. In some ways it is better. Larger portions. 

Oxtail is good during cooler months, but when it's warm out...the sandwiches & local food are the way to go. Reuben was packed with corned beef but it needed more sauerkraut & sauce. Comes with salt & pepper fries. Flavor and quality is not like the deli but it's decent. For Hawai'ian cafes that serve Reuben's I still prefer The Cal's.

It's small but reasonably priced and offers a fine selection of food. No real surprises, it's what's become the standard buffet lineup of entrees, an omelet/pancake station, and southwestern and Chinese dishes. Sunday Brunch offers some extra seafood (shrimp, crab) and champagne. It's not the good stuff, but believe me, after a glass or two you won't notice.

I was lucky enough to visit champagne brunch with a group of frinds who also like to play with their food. The buffet selection inspired me to assemble a southern-style plate of fried chicken and waffles with a side of fruit that tasted divine. Then I hit the dessert bar. Again, nothing fancy here, but a nice array of cakes and pies with soft serve ice cream also available. Extra credit to the buffet for offering sugar free pies and cake as well.

The best thing about the Paradise Buffet may be the decor. It has the darker feel of classic Vegas casinos, but there is an attempt at tropical lushness with plastic greenery and flowers throughout and a large aquarium at the entrance. The buffet is set off by crystal-accented chandeliers and lighting, the ceiling is all mirrored tile. Liberace would've been right at home here - and I mean that in the best way possible.

One star off my rating for a poor first impression: the restrooms are at the entry and they may be the first thing you smell coming in from the casino. But once you're over that speedbump, it's all good.",c33Z36u5N8h5JgYsnweXlw,2,1,4,p47z_Cn8-qYFWUDRpNrLhQ

Being from Seattle, I should have known better.

Skinny, overcooked snow crab legs with very little meat.  And if you're not going to provide any crab cracking utensils, at least score the shells!  And since they were overcooked, nearly impossible to remove from the shells.  I hate wasting anything that comes from a living creature but I didn't have much choice.  Rest of the food was bland and boring - no better than Old Country Buffet, but at twice the price.

I see that Brent H.'s review below raves about the crab legs, but clearly you've never had fresh Pacific NW dungeness crab - you'd forget all about these skinny little critters.  I guess I'm spoiled, so I won't be going back to this buffet.",x_p_GB6rJ0f1fRj3e51ldA,3,1,2,lKMe6rP3KlMPd6tbwhJVYA

We came on a Saturday night, which was like steak night? I ended up paying ~$20 for dinner-- which wasn't bad.

The interior was like a dark rain forrest. I guess that was the theme?

As for the food, it was decent. It wasn't the besttttest, but it was good. I really enjoyed how the chef cooked their steaks -- on the spot! However, if you like it medium-- GO FOR MEDIUM RARE, just because they tend to overcook it. The sushi selection was limited, BOO TO THAT. As for the rest, it was alright. I did enjoy the PECAN PIE DESSERT -- AHHHH HEAVEN. There was also KING CRAB LEGS AND FRESH OYSTERS. So yay for that. Oh, and they also have smoked salmon-- which was fairly interesting.

As for the service, it was decent; however, I did not enjoy when the waitress took my plate FULL OF KING CRAB LEGS, that wasn't touched :( What a waste of food. Oh, and there were these little flies that were constantly around my plate, which is why I marked one star down. I was definitely a little irritated with these flies-- hopefully they fix this insect problem!

Overall, it was a decent buffet. I wouldn't mind coming back if I was in the area.

The Rio hotel has a ""seafood"" buffet which is about twice the cost of this buffet... But for a good reason - it has hot and cold crab, lobster, fresh juicy oysters, sushi, sashimi, and the list goes on...

The Paradise ""Seafood"" Buffet is nothing more than a standard buffet with fresh oysters and about 3 kinds of sushi added to the menu! It is pretty standard for most buffets to include shrimp and crab legs in their dinner menus. So I suppose if you add some oysters and some sushi in your menu, you're magically upgraded to ""Seafood"" Buffet!

Whoever was in charge of the oysters when I went, didn't rinse them so there was a ton of barnicle pieces and black oyster shell goo all over the place. To makes matters worse, they also stacked the oysters all on top of each other, so you'd be sure to taste some of that crunchy shell pieces and goo. Yumm? The oysters themselves were quite good, but the poor preparation lead me to only eat less than a handfull of them. In comparison, I think I ate about two dozen juicy ones at the Rio. As for the sushi... I think it was just a california roll, a shrimp nigiri, and tuna roll. 

So if you're a seafood aficionado, then be ready to be disappointed. If you're a regular buffet eater... Not bad!",P1zxjNiPpK2D0yMzcmzGVQ,0,0,2,GNohV8dPLQf1tu3EaB0Fkw

On the night my family and I went, the tilapia was mushy yet somehow rubbery and I can't quite rationalize that one. The prime rib was quite tough and my medium rare steak was well done on the top half and rare on the bottom half.

I can only say that, if you want to go to this place, take care of your stuff because they have skillfully thief employee and steal your cellphone or bag and there is no camera that you can prove it.please Believe me, my boyfriend and I went to this damn buffet for breakfast, and when we left the table to bring our breakfast, no one as a costumer was around and only employees and I left my phone confidently on the table, and after two minutes, when I returned, they stole my cellphone and I knew exactly which employee did it. So We couldn't eat anything.

Eventually, the restaurant's management came and she was really relax and indifferent, it seems that every second one cellphone is lost and she didn't even apologize (I think in this buffet it's so common).Summary of the last day of our holiday was very sucked in that city. 

Perhaps this would have been acceptable if it occurred at the downtown but incredible in this hotel and restaurant.

Please, Please, those who Read this to know even the price of this buffet is expensive for nothing, it's not wort it. Don't waist your time, money and cellphone.",cPnZ1AyggSxyfKoJc0QmAA,0,0,1,qE7VLR0GsHU05et3OwBoSQ

My mom & dad like to stay at the Fremont hotel for some reason, and a lot of times that they come here, they dine at the Paradise Buffet & Cafe Restaurant.

The buffet at the Paradise Buffet & Cafe Restaurant is not the biggest, nor do they have the largest food selection. What I can say is that this buffet is clean, has pretty good service, and they do make one thing that I really love...........the FRIED CHICKEN!!!

When I do go here to eat, I always make sure that they are serving Fried Chicken that day. Ummmmm........Fried Chicken! What can I say............they know how to do it right! 
Big Meaty pieces of chicken, fried to perfection, & seasoned just right! If I could eat this everyday without any health ramifications.........I'd do it! :) Lol!",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,16,10,3,sgks0pRUlzcokOnDsgEJRQ

That is discussing! When asked when we paid to go if it was worth the price and of course they say ""yes, its very good"" Boy they are lying!

5836660,2015-05-28,0,sE05glLpll9KPv3dcO79GQ,"We were searching for a place to hold our family reunion that would accommodate a group of around 16 people and give us the food options that we wanted. It was suggested that we check out the Paradise Buffet since others had had good experiences making reservations. I called more than a month ahead but was told that they would not be able to take our reservation because it was Memorial Day weekend, but if we showed up at 4, when they opened, they would be able to seat us together. There would also be an 18% gratuity added automatically. So I said okay, let's do it. 
Our group of 16 showed up slightly before 4. The woman at the register didn't even look up from what she was doing to curtly inform us that the buffet didn't open until 4. We let her know that we just wanted to let them know that we were going to have a large group and wanted to sit together and would pay on the same check. She said we could just wait in line and they'd see what they could do. Grrr...
At four, we all went through the line and I paid for the 16 people (we had collected the money previously.) The total came out to more than I had expected but I brushed it off, thinking that my math had been off somewhere. We were seated at four different tables in the same area, as each table could only hold between 6 and 8 people. 
The buffet wasn't anything special. We were there on their steak night, but the majority of the food was pretty buffet-standard. Pasta, mashed potatoes, chicken, vegetables, desserts, that sort of thing. But the food was good. 
It began bothering me that the price was more than $20 more than what I had expected it was going to be. So I decided to go to the register and ask for another print out of the receipt. When the cashier handed it to me, I found that they had charged me for 18 people, not 16. But they were nice when I brought it up, and were prompt in giving me a refund for those two non-existent people. 
I don't want to give them anything more than a three because it wasn't amazing. The service was okay, the food way okay, and if it hadn't been for that mistake with the payment, I probably would have given it a 4. I hope they're more careful in the future.",BeDfEK3qeIdnmwjnGFa8xg,0,0,3,Hfamz7h35BI87GN0fwu6xA

(see pic) Although it was not worth the price, I guess we were mostly paying for the prime rib which is a decent piece of meat for Old town Vegas.

Terrible old and dingy decor.  Our seats and tables were basically hosed down. It was all wet from someone ""cleaning"" it.  The buffet was scary and I thought I may get food poisoning, so I stayed away from all mayonnaise concoctions.  Prime rib was a dark brown - totally overcooked.  The condiments for baked potatoes were set-up before the utensils, not after the baked potatoes - so I had to go in reverse in the buffet.  Most of the selections were meat.  The salad bar, ugh...The vanilla ice cream was out and there was an array of drip bowls for dripping machine.  The shrimp were a strange orangey brown color and cocktail sauce was drizzled all over the bar.  There was a mess of serving spoons everywhere. The chicken was good.  But I picked a hair out of it. not even a decent dessert could appear here. My silverware was sticky to start.  The chocolate cake tasted like a recycled HoHo.  

The whole experience was simply awful. At $36.00 for two people, it's not even a deal.  

I am convinced all the other buffets on town ship their week old leftovers here to serve.

I feel bad for posting this because some of the servers were very sweet people and I can't imagine having to show up here everyday.  OMG.  Just an awful experience.
