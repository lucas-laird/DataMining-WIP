78483,2016-02-21,0,77AfVfvvjfQXslusY8QElg,First time here and it was so much fun. They played a good variety of music. The dance floor was always full and the crowd enjoying themselves. The staff was excellent too. The bathroom attendant was very courteous. The security was also awesome. Opening door for the ladies. Had a great time!!! Off the strip but must visit if you are in town.,0i_hNh3GHAlHu8-KIDXrDw,0,0,5,-PJtQjosVZqEDuDJm1zgBQ
577994,2017-09-30,0,77AfVfvvjfQXslusY8QElg,I wouldn't really call this a club my friends and I were disappointed when we arrived it felt more of a hookah lounge with a dance floor and a bar. The Dj was okay I have to agree with the other reviews here you will not hear Banda or corridos here. Drinks are a bit expensive though Ladies are free before midnight and guys pay a $10 entry all night. I guess it's an okay place if you're just going to hang out but definitely not to have fun.,KFPLAW-BB2dyh-mScTEjeQ,0,0,2,KGIa-NCOmauiY4fl49IVHw

I sat at the bar and was greted by a very beautiful and friendly batender.  I can't  remember her name, but she chatted with me and made a good suggestion  of drink to order.  This was greatly appreciated since I was there alone. I met a local whom was very friendly and shared  his tacos with me. The atmosphere was great and i had an awesome time.

 I will be going again to salsa night more often.",g7BVhNukAjCVvaWmt7I1wg,6,2,5,quxvqQHACnkSiNPLJuuChQ

884837,2014-08-24,0,77AfVfvvjfQXslusY8QElg,"From NY and was vacationing in Vegas. I was specifically looking for somewhere to dance Latin music on a Fri night. My friend and I tried going to La Casona first but after that wasn't a success we walked down the road to La Jolla: 

Cover: Yes, there is a $10 cover, if that's enough to turn you away, you probably shouldn't be in Vegas.

Drinks: Well made, around $10 - don't remember exactly. Got a free shot just for checking in. Def got drunk that night. 

Music: GREAT VARIETY. The DJ played everything from Salsa, Merengue, Bachata, Reggeaton, Hip-Hop, House, Top 40, etc.

Vibe: There was a good amount of people. It definitely wasn't packed but def not empty. Plenty of room to dance and have a great time. If I had to guess I would say most of the crowd is local but we met a few girls from out of town. 

Overall: Had A GREAT TIME! Danced the night away and would definitely recommend.",SKALy5WAxqfdPeqTorp78g,8,2,5,lAPI16b5rycbEUarwa7WSA
1145601,2014-07-20,1,77AfVfvvjfQXslusY8QElg,"My Vegas-guy co-worker had been chatting up this place at work for weeks, finally on a random Friday a group of work friends went.

I got there around 9:00pm ahead of the others.  The place with pleasantly quiet, except for a few patrons, and I enjoyed the chill atmosphere and the decor of the room while sipping a beer from the bartender.  My co-workers arrived, and we were all starving for food at this point.  In fact, my co-worker who was a former chef said they knew how do to hamburgers well here.  The staff swapped a few stories with my co-workers while we chilled at the bar.  I ordered a cheddar burger, as did a ravenously hungry friend of mine.

After a few minutes, the chef came with metaphorical egg on his face: looks like they were out of freshly prepped beef patties for the night.  A disappointing mistake, but it meant a lot to me that a chef could be both friendly and apologetic and not in the cheesy, corporate ""fake"" way that I've had at chain restaurants.  He offered to prep both of us a special chicken sandwich of his own design with some extras like avocado. I can't ever say to to avocado!  The chicken, bacon, sandwich creation filled us both up.

The bartender exchanged a few jokes with our group.  He introduced me to a new type of rum that I enjoyed (and I am PICKY about my rum too!);  We got to sample a few new drinks they were experimenting with.

Overall?  I loved our service here.  It felt genuine, fun, and relaxed. Meals start around 10 dollars here, and I didn't stay for the complete transition to the night club, though as left a line of girls was forming to join the three or four that already entered. I give the service here five stars. Four stars overall.",9CHQt9-NBEvXX4Wyn3dLMg,2,1,4,z9BFtRmuGxddO_1tgbte6g

I was here was before and it was ok, not the second time around tho, the DJ was AWFUL, no continuity to the music he was playing, one salsa song to one reggaeton to 3 bachata, etc. He had people (his friends I guess) around him making suggestions.

1609211,2017-04-16,0,77AfVfvvjfQXslusY8QElg,This place sux i don't  recommend to go.  It's so expensive and far from the Vegas  strip. Dj sux!   Stay at the strip and find something better.,jsxuSja622lk4ZH7khEc8Q,0,1,1,TLV0E2ftNzvwyMQOrnvZ-Q
1614547,2016-02-04,4,77AfVfvvjfQXslusY8QElg,"To start this review, yes, I speak Spanish and although I am used to Banda and Norte√±o, I also enjoy going to a salsa/bachata club such as this one and the dj mix was pretty good.
It is an interesting mix of things here but the rip off atmosphere was a terrible experience.
First, I called ahead to make reservations or see what the options were. We were told to just come by and not have any issues.

We arrived at this place via taxi and then the bouncer announced it over the radio that we arrived via taxi so that was a red flag already.
From there on, everyone we ran into seemed to want to get paid. Everyone had a comment or story to get tipped or over tipped which felt really abusive.
We tried to look for a place to sit but most of the tables stated that they were reserved. . . well that pissed me off since we were told that we didn't need to make a reservation (and we arrived upon opening).
So in order to get a table, we asked about the bottle service and the waitress looked excited and told me that it started at $185 which is not entirely true as I saw $235 was more like the price she should be giving people. I read the disclaimer on the bottom of the menu and it stated that it included everything as well as gratuities so I thought that was actually a pretty good deal then. She brought the bottle and two juices and a bill for $295? She then also proceeded to tell me that the tip was not included but not mandatory and really pushed to have me tip her. So I found that a bit confusing and misleading. With distrust, I handed her $50 cash and then never saw her again?! There were bus boys that came by rarely to refill the juice but definitely didn't feel like bottle service. it was terrible! But hey, I guess I got a $350 table to sit at.

Because I had such a poor experience, I decided to interview the front area cashier as well as the bathroom attendant for more information on gratuities. . . which costed me $20 to get to talk to them of course. And they told me right straight with confidence that the bottle service already came all inclusive. I then told them about my situation and the story changed immediately to backing up their coworker instead. It was a very fishy night but at least they knew how to band together.

Of course, to end the night, I asked for a taxi. I saw everyone who were waiting for one and everyone who was ever at the front area since I was trying to be a good host to my friend. When the taxi came for us, while everyone knew we were waiting for one outside patiently, I saw a new person that just stole our ride totally not in line for the taxi we waited for 20 min in the cold.
Granted, with my obvious anger, after another 15 minutes, they asked their shuttle driver to take us back to our hotel. We knew how much it costed to get to the club via taxi during traffic hours so we knew not to pay more than that. When he grabbed us at the front of the club, he seemed to be polite and courteous. When he left the club and had us in the van, he started asking me for an ""optional"" $40. I really don't understand this place? Are you guys starving? or are you used to drunk people that you think you can take advantage of? Lucky for me, I was not drunk and recall all of this as well as told him I knew how much it costed me to get here. So then he looked guilty and said to give him what I felt like giving him. What a terrible place with terrible workers.

It was important that I write this review so people who do enjoy music and the Latin theme, keep your wallet in check and watch your bill closely. These guys are thieves.",CrTY-pr1BeFaxys2M7Y-tg,44,0,2,Co7x8XXB4rnu_Z0yWvVJtA
1630294,2016-10-23,0,77AfVfvvjfQXslusY8QElg,"Just got in from nj. I wanted to go to a club, prefer Spanish music. This club is 10-15 min away from the strip.  There were only locals this night. They played only Spanish music. I was really looking for a place that played a mix of Spanish and English music.  The atmosphere was relaxed , clean.  There was a lot of security we felt s Men $10.00 cover girls get in free. Good place to take a date, spouse etc...
We had a great time. I would go again. The only reason I gave them four stars because it was off the strip. We couldn't walk there.",TxMEXGyZpSrr5mG0BvzCSw,3,0,4,nAuTDWnE7__C6hX1vWJC_A

3485001,2016-03-08,0,77AfVfvvjfQXslusY8QElg,"We had first gone to the XS nightclub, since it had a 4 star review. We waited in line for 2 hours and once we went inside it was super crowded, you couldn't even walk or breath passing people. We left within the first 10 minutes that we were there. So then we looked online and found La Jolla. We gave it a try, outside it doesn't look appealing, once you walk inside you see somewhat of a small space, compare to XS nightclub. The bar is on the right side and the dance floor in the middle.

Once we first walked in, we ordered drinks, one shot, one beer, one soda was $28, somewhat pricy. Then we found seats right next to the dance floor, we waited couple minutes to see how the music was, and we actually liked it. Couple minutes later we started dancing, the DJ played good music, a lot of merengue, reguetton, bachata. He also played punta, which to me this is totally new, since no club that I have ever been to has ever played punta, and I really enjoyed it. He also played English music, slow jams, and Mexican music like Banda, corridos, but not so much. So If you're into straight Mexican music like Banda and corridos, you will not hear the DJ play this music much. 

Overall, we really enjoyed the night, we didn't leave the club until 5AM, I love clubbing, and I had never dance this much in a club before but the music was good so we danced all night and had a blast",dOo0gkqDtmnqnFwNIjufIw,13,1,5,ohWszYJWRLitooUHZfV25w

4963898,2015-01-19,0,77AfVfvvjfQXslusY8QElg,"Sunday night they have a live salsa band Orqestra Borinka and they are great! In between sets they also have a DJ. There is no cover on Sunday nights and a dress code is enforced, making it a nice evening out.

The ambiance is nice and there are three different areas for seating so if you want to be close to the stage and dance, or sit further away if you want to enjoy conversations  makes it nice. There are booths and ottomons for seating.

We did not arrive until 11PM and I did not see an appetizer menu. I would have loved some food if they serve that late but was not offered a menu. I ordered a Kahlua and Milk and they were out of milk, the bartender offered to make it with whipped cream which I appreciated the gesture. The drink was a short, and I was charged $12. This price is exorbitant for an off Strip bar, with poker machines. There are drink specials that are posted on the promotional information, so be aware. I will return, however I will carefully order my next drink.
