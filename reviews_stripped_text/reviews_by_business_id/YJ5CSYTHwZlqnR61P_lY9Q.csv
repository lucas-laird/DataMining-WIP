I mean u walk in n the ppl working there are clearly mexican n dont speak the best of english (which is fine), i ordered Carne asada taco and chicken taco... Since when is carne asade little chunks of grizley flavorless meat?? So gross... Everything was gross tasting there. Im not a pickey eater but i couldn't do it, my body wouldnt allow me to swallow all the chewy grizle (gross)... I gave it to my dog n she wouldnt eat it either. The chicken was not as bad but it wasnt good. 

This place was an epic fail, i feel like they have lost touch w theyre culture n what mexican food really is. 
Maybe this is mexican food in vegas (god i hope not). its just whitewashed bland not even close to real mexican food. Im surprised they didnt put ketsup ontop as the sauce. 
Im warning u.... U might vomit if u eat here

Oh ya... even the rice and beans weren't edible for me or my dog, if thats not enough the girl working there was a BI%*H. That is all :(",UT-DXi8_zWr3oC0Chhnu9A,2,1,1,QF4ckXjCmCiy0h-fpkaDmA

411421,2015-11-15,0,YJ5CSYTHwZlqnR61P_lY9Q,"The day my Mexican-born husband (now ex) said the food at Roberto's (Henderson location) was pretty good, I knew it'd become a staple on my ""go-to take-out food"" weekly menu. So, a year ago, when I moved to a location equidistant from two locations (Durango and Rainbow), I knew I was a winner!!! That is, until yesterday (Saturday, 14Nov15 at 5:40pm).

The moment I approached the cashier, I knew there was trouble. Just the look on her face was evident that she wasn't having the best of days...but who doesn't have those kind of days, right? She was ""decent"" with what she said. How she said it needs some work...lots of work. I ordered their ""12 rolled tacos"" special (w/beef), chile verde burrito (which I had to repeat twice) and a mango agua fresca (which she thought I said 2 and asked me to verify - I wanted one large one). She placed the cup in front of me, which was torn down the side from the top but I don't believe anyone standing where she was would've seen that. I asked for another cup, pointing to the tear and my perception was she grabbed the cup in a much more aggressive way that seemed unnecessary, tossed it and grabbed another, in a similar fashion as the defective one. I paid cash, got my change and receipt and stepped aside. After she rang up the next customer, I asked her for the drink as they need to dispense it (where the soft drinks are self-serve). She barely looked at me and said ""ice"". My mistake - this was the first time I ordered one of their aqua fresca drinks so I was not aware that I had to put ice in the cup first. I said, ""oh, ok"" and got my ice. She filled the drink and while I waited for the food, I went to the salsa bar, got sliced cucumbers and waited. I heard her call out for an order that was similar to mine - the burrito was a chile relleno burrito. She scanned the people standing in front of her and we made eye contact but she didn't see who placed this order. So I didn't think anything of it. Another order was called out...she had to call it twice, and the second time, in my opinion, was done in a very condescending tone. But with the attitude that was coming from this girl, I wasn't surprised. That was when I looked at my receipt....there it was - chile relleno burrito. 

Great...now I have to approach this girl again (not just to collect the food). And really, I was ok with the chile relleno burrito. I never had it in a burrito but I was willing to try it. I decided I was going to point out the error and say that it was fine.... I only wish I could have. 

I waited for her to finish with a customer and I said ""excuse me, I wanted the chile verde burrito, but....""  I was given an attitude-filled, overly exaggerated ""No""... you said chile relleno"". She doesn't remember that I'm the one who placed this order but she remembers that I said chile relleno? I almost fell to the floor. Again, I said ""Excuse me? I said chile ver..."" And I got the same ""no"", only this time, it lasted a second or two longer than the first (I kid you not!) I couldn't believe this. I've worked with the public for 24 years and was stunned, no, appalled at the sheer gall this girl had. If she hadn't interrupted me the first time, none of this would have happened. We were literally yelling at each other. There was another man behind the counter next to her who was trying to help and I certainly appreciate his attempt to resolve the issue but little miss attitude was more than I cared for. I said to him that I'll take the food but I'm never going back there. And I know that means nothing to them. One customer, $20, maybe once a week will not hurt them. The only mistake I'm kicking myself for is taking the food. I should have said that I didn't want any of it and I want my money back.

Attention: Roberto's at 8680 W. Warm Springs Rd, my order #1759, was rung up on NO. 643990 Reg 1, ""employeeFE"" at 17:38 (this is on the bottom of the receipt)....you will want to teach this one girl to leave her attitude at the door before she clocks in for work or you may lose more loyal customers like myself. And if she's confronted by ANY customer, she needs to listen to them before responding. None of this, including this very poor review, would have happened if she just listened to me.

Lesson in life: Anyone who starts any confrontation with an aggressive defense is lying just to save face. The way she handled this is a perfect example.",0QcSyp4z6s7ENAZnHJ2mSg,0,0,1,UPo1n25JmAI4JhiZ6Wt8VA

For starters, and my main reason for only 2 stars is the Guac.  It is pretty bad when you can go to El Pollo or Islands and get better guac than a taco shop.  It should be thick and with chunks of avocado not something that almost looks like a was ran thru a blender.

The food itself, is ok but not as good as their San Diego locations.  I have yet to run into someone who is from San Diego and has eaten at the ones here, or people from Vegas who have eaten at the San Diego ones who have disagreed.

That's a first. I got fed up and just took the rest home. I went to bed and my husband ate what was left of the burrito.

I've seriously never seen such a liquified taco. They couldn't even get the subtleties right - i.e. pico or no pico. My stomach as well as my wallet are in much pain right now, and my family is left unsatisfied. If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one!

I told her what I originally ordered and that's when she started to get attitude, like it was my fault she got the order wrong. She than proceeded to ring me up for the tacos. I told her I was not going to pay for them since I had already paid for two meals, of which I over paid for apparently. She than told me she could not let me walk out with another meal without paying for it, and she couldn't take the other meal because I left. I told her I paid for my meal already, I just wanted her to fix her mistake. She continued to get attitude and told me I had to pay for it. I than asked where her manager was, she smiled and said actually I'm the manager. I said this is ridiculous that she wouldn't help me, and it was her mistake. I told her she had horrible customer service and she started to laugh and said ""sorry miss"". I asked her who her store manager was and she laughed again and said he's not in. I said I wanted his name and I was going to tell her store manager about her. She just said that's fine and started to write down the store number and her name while laughing.

The portions and value are there but for me the taste left a bit to be desired. I wasn't able to detect much seasoning in my visit.

Ordered combo plate #1 which is a a beef taco and a cheese enchilada with refried beans and Spanish rice. The rice had to many crunchy kernels and the beans  were not seasoned. The taco was massive and had a nice deep fried tortilla. The lettuce and Cheddar-Cotija blend was fresh and liberally applied. The beef was underseasoned.

Anyway, we get our food plus the usual condiments (salsa, pickled jalapeño, radish, carrots). The corn tortillas were hard on the edges and dry. The pork was also not very tasty. I've had their Adobada before (at another location) and enjoy the marinated, juicy meat. It was nothing like that. Cooked much too long and crisped until there was almost nothing left.

The service is always outstanding and the emoloyees are alway very nice.
Price wise it is  very cheap, this is the only Robertos that I will go to.(all the others are a little off)

The only Negative is they have a lot of oil or grease. They need to let the food drain for just a tad bit.

Enjoy :)",65qB0ibVi_6mMu87ioZR3w,4,3,5,5kDX6Sup_b2C4UooX7SDeg

I understand that people and businesses make mistakes so I called to let them know. The guy who answered didn't speak fluent English so communication was tough but I did the best I could. I explained to him what I was missing from my order and all he said was okay and hung up the phone. I called back to ask if he knew my address and he said no. I told him I paid delivery fees and he hung up on me. I called back and he put the phone down so that it was off the hook and had me waiting for 20 minutes. I called back and the line was still busy. I believe he was intentionally trying to ignore me. Very disappointed and never ordering from Robertos again.,uePKhhh7uTpDiwmZhmFdnw,0,0,1,7PUiGeYob1T-k50ypMjMWw

The cook the meat on the stove top so you get a nice sear/crisp to the meat. I didn't really like the Guac, it's blended so it's very much like a puree. 

The tortilla chips and guac weren't that great. Chips seem to be made in house as it retains a lot of grease. The guac didn't have texture so it didn't taste great together. I think guac puree should be used in different dishes, not tacos and chips.

 Unless youre me, then it's for one. Me. Heh.

My regular order is 3 beef tacos with plenty of green salsa on the side. The salsa is a bit spicy for me yet delicious! Also the horchata here is perfect.... not too sweet, not too watery. I have also fallen in love with the chicken burrito. It sounds like it could be plain but the chicken is shredded and so juicy, and also having tons of onions and peppers leaves me in heaven. Also a fan of a good ol' bean and cheese burrito and beef taquitos.

The prices are very fair too, even though they were raised about a month ago. I believe the beef tacos were $3.05 before and now are $3.35. Not a huge change and I would much rather they raise prices a bit than decrease portion sizes. My only real beef so far is that burrito sizes vary. Sometimes it is very generous, sometimes not, so you never know exactly how much you'll get.

Also a note that Roberto's serves their menudo on the bone. I love menudo but hate eating it off the bone, and once heard some unknowing customer complain to them about how she was eating their menudo and almost chipped her tooth on the bone.

I love Roberto's don't get me wrong but this locations is king for screwing up your order then arguing with you about it instead satisfying the customer. I called a pick up order in today and asked and paid for extra chicken in my enchiladas. I get home and begin to eat and notice that my enchiladas are filled with way more bell peppers, onions, and enchilada sauce than meat. I'm not a complainer and I rarely send food back but there was barely any meat at all so I finished the first one dreading having to call back complaining and/or go back up there for them to make it over because I was starving. When I cut open the second one it was totally disrespectful not only did they fail to give me the extra chicken that they charged me for there wasn't even enough meat to be called an chicken enchilada in the first place. I didn't want to go through the hassle of calling them about something so petty but I did because I felt like I didn't receive $12 worth of food. When I called the woman who answered the phone was super offensive and confrontational. I was very pleasant when I called I didn't think it was a big deal, I was simply letting them know that they should check the proportion of the mixture because the vegetable to meat ratio is completely off balanced. Either she wasn't trying to hear what I was saying or she didn't understand what I was saying because no matter what I said she kept saying bring it back with the receipt. I sent my daughter back up there with what was left and she got loud and ignorant with my daughter and made a scene in the store. My daughter called me and I called back and she told me she's not doing anything because I ate most of it. I asked to speak to a manager and she refused she first told me that he's not going to give me anything because I ate it and then she told me he was walking out the door. I told her then just give me the money back and she said she would give me only $2 back the price of the extra checking. I told her to just give me back half and I would leave it alone. She told me she's not even going to give me $2 back and that she's giving my daughter 2 enchiladas without extra chicken. I told her I don't want any food from that store and to give me half of my money back or let me talk to someone who could. She told me that she's not going to let me talk to anyone else and that she giving my daughter 2 enchiladas and she hung up on me. I have never been talked to like that or treated like that in my life. I'm very respectful and I give respect so I expect it back in return.

After I ordered I went to the little sides bar and got my cucumbers and sauces one of the staff in the back yelled something at me really couldn't hear so I asked if he was talking to me and they both said in Spanish thinking I didn't know what she was saying ""is this idiot deaf"" let's say that would usually throw me off the edge but I let it go because I was in a good mood then when I got my order the drink I ordered wasn't filled and she asked me more like forcefully and irritated by the fact I was there said do I want ice and I said yes not knowing at this location you have to put your own ice then they fill your drink (the specialty drinks like horchata)... idk but I've never done that at a restaurant before so I didn't know the way they operated and her rude stare and acting like I was a ""deaf idiot"" really wasn't helping either. So I put my own ice in handed her the cup she filled my drink and then slapped it down looked like she was going to get a top for my drink and then couldn't find one I guess and helped the next guest without saying a word so I stood there unsure if she was ever going to get me a top for my drink which she didn't and knowing I was obviously an idiot or idk possibly confused at the lack of service she could have pointed me in the direction of a lid or at least said here's your drink b*tch in fact if she would have said here's your drink b*tch I'd probably be more satisfied than her complete ignorance and act of irritation about me being there.
