I'm already planning my next trip to Vegas just to stop in this restaurant for another meal and cocktail.  We had the TLC roll - Tempura lobster and crab with whipped avocado and siracha aioli.  Beautiful and delicious.  We also shared the steamed buns - so flavorful we thought of ordering a second round.  Finally we had pork potstickers, mmm mmmm.  Such an amazing meal.  I also had a cocktail - something Crush..vodka, crushed raspberries, mint and club soda, so refreshing.  It was an outstanding meal and I'll certainly make it my place to dine while in Vegas.  To top it off the restaurant was super sexy and sleek.  Loved that you could view the three kitchens all the way around from these gorgeous floor to ceiling windows.  Lovely lovely.",6eStwrCvyzcCDWVrzSwUzQ,1,1,5,lgjRFg3M-1N416W41DHsTQ
48547,2015-02-15,1,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"We ate here on a Sunday evening in early February only because we were staying at the Bellagio and walked by it on the way to a convention event. It turned out to be some great food, although there were a few service issues. I will say that the ladies working the hostess station were great - extremely friendly.

We were seated at the bar at first since we didn't have a reservation, but the wait was really short - maybe 10 minutes tops at about 8:30-9:00 The bartender was a tad abrupt but the slightly older one who picked up the bill was gracious. I had the ""Jala Back"" since I like some spice, and it was good - I ended up ordering another with dinner.

The naan and dipping sauces that came first were fabulous - the best naan I've had. I appreciate that there was a spicy and a 'regular' sauce since I love spice and my friend cannot eat it. I would have had a whole meal of the naan. We shared two appetizers - the steamed buns and the crab+lobster maki roll. Both were fantastic. The steamed buns were soft and luscious with the correct pickle and sauce. The roll was also great and the portions were perfect. For entrees, I had the Yellowfin Tuna, which was cooked perfectly, and my friend had the special, which was served with dashi and vegetables and she loved. The entree portions were also perfect to be satisfactory but not too big. For dessert, we had the banana with peanut butter ice cream. The ice cream was great - I could have done without the banana. 

Now, the only issues were that 1) the pacing of the meal was off. The whole dinner took almost two hours. I noticed slow service seemed common in Vegas in general, though. 2) We never actually figured out who our waiter was. One guy came to take our drink order, disappeared to get water, and when a lady with water appeared several minutes later, she had no idea that we'd already been asked about it. Then another man popped up with an iPad asking about drinks. The first guy reappeared to take our order, then throughout the meal we had at least three people coming and going asking how we were doing (none of them management), someone dedicated to serving the dishes, and a different person taking our dessert order, and at one point a waiter called my friend - a lady - ""sir"", which he was very embarrassed about. They were all nice, but it appeared disorganized.

Overall, this was a good meal, and although I may not make it a destination if I were staying at another hotel, I have no problem recommending it and would return if I were at The Bellagio.",0c-F2TWIcP8ejWoc5MWajQ,1,1,4,1rBR0PIcmAA3gTUAdyiPvg

60274,2011-02-21,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"When researching restaurants in Vegas, Sensi kept coming up as a highly recommended place - by critics and patrons.  When we called to make a reservation and ask if they would be open to making something vegan (I always ask ahead...  sometimes chefs love accommodating requests like that, other times it aggravates the heck out of them) I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they have a vegan risotto on their menu!  Score!  We were there...

When we got there, the person I had made the reservation with had communicated to our server that I was vegan.  He acknowledged it right off the bat and directed the non-vegan specials to my husband.  Then he told me about the vegan risotto AND how they could swap out the scallops with tofu in the Thai scallops entree.  He then walked me through suggestions on how they could veganize other dishes -- plus, he noted which breads and sauces on the table were vegan.  Talk about going WAY above and beyond.  That's better service than I get in most vegan restaurants.  

I later asked him if he was vegan (he was not).  Some of his knowledge was general and from experience with precious customers and much of it was on the spot from talking with the kitchen and other staff, which was pretty darn cool if you ask me.  I love, love, love when I can go in to a restaurant and really experience it like that.  Eating vegan in non-vegan restaurants usually means settling for the one vegetarian dish that is already on the menu and asking them to ""hold the cheese"".  Not here -- this server, whose name I regret I didn't get so can't mention in this post - went above and beyond to help create a path for me so my experience was as luxurious and enjoyable as those looking at the full menu.

In the end, I had the farmer's salad (delish) and the Thai scallops, swapped out with tofu and it was out of this world.  Those, combined with the wine (they had a very nice wine selection) and great view in to their glass-enclosed fishbowl style kitchen, made for a really, really enjoyable evening.

We would have gotten dessert there if my husband didn't have his heart and eyes on a sweet crepe from the Jean Philippe Patisserie.  :)

I highly recommend Sensi to anyone looking for an incredible meal and experience out in Vegas.  The restaurant is physically removed from the casino area so you really feel like you are getting away from the Vegas chaos for a bit.  This place isn't like many of the pretentious celebrity-chef restaurants either.  It's just hands down incredible food, service, and environment.  When we're back in Vegas, we'll definitely go back.",Sf1rlqqpD1cz9oq8gCGo6w,3,0,5,7RxOCXR40ynyME24lULoUQ

We had 6 separate reservations (a private room had a 1000-ish drink minimum) when we arrived they gave us a private room without the charge and treated us like royalty.  The food was out of this world and the service and staff were top notch.  I would recommend this to anyone.

But you get what you pay for. We scarfed down the pork potstickers like it was our last meal. Seriously, they were unreal. I ordered the Filet Mignon but substituted the peppercorn sauce for the black truffle bearnaise sauce. SUCH a good decision.

The atmosphere is very inviting. For the Sunday night we went, it was very quiet and enjoyable. I love being able to see the kitchen at work with the glass walls in the middle. It's fun to see your food prepared.

Our server was very kind and helpful in our ordering. He didn't pop by too many times, but we were enjoying a quiet dinner to ourselves after a long weekend, so it was appreciated. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place. And if your stomach isn't exploding afterward, I recommend the Ice Bubble--sorbet and/or gelato served in a large ice bowl. You will walk away a happy person.",4BwbB5WDmV_2e-KetUsLvw,2,1,4,BVJvGf50r_LOR8EKncHcnw

214011,2014-01-28,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"I wish I had the option of giving Sensi a zero star review, but since that can't be done. This will be a reflection of a one star review. 

Pros:
- the ambiance and looks/feel of the restaurant (although this can be completely deceiving)
- the naan and dipping sauces in the beginning of the dinner 

Cons:
- the service. Our waiter was completely rude and neglectful. I ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer in the beginning to start off my meal. No where on the menu did it mention that this dish would be spicy. NO WHERE. The dish came and had four shrimps and on the shrimp were ginger and a slice of pepper. Knowing that I can't eat spicy food, I took OFF the ginger and the pepper.  But sure enough, it was spicy. So spicy that I had to spit out the food! The waiter came back to ask us how we were doing and I said that I didn't like the appetizer and it was too spicy. The waiter then proceeded to tell me that I probably shouldn't have ate the ginger and pepper with it and that was probably what made it spicy. I told him I didn't and he looks at me, smirked and took the plate away. 

-our food. I ordered the butter chicken with rice and my fianc√© ordered the special of the night. A bone in steak. My food was bland and I didn't even eat 1/4 of it while my fianc√© liked his and ate most of it. And I took a few bites of his... 

-the service (again). Our waiter checked in on us  ONCE when our food came out and disappeared the rest of the evening. The busboy gave us more attention than our ""waiter"".  We had to ask the busboy for our check and it took 20 mins later to finally receive it. The ""waiter"" did not check in to offer us dessertts. It was my fianc√© birthday and I made note of it when making reservations... I couldn't even order a dessert for  his birthday dinner. 

- aftermath. We went to  watch ""O""  after our dinner. When we were leaving Bellagio, I started to feel ill.. I told my fianc√© this and he said that maybe I  will feel better when we got back to our room. This did not happen. Infact, my fianc√© woke up at 4AM ill as well. We were sick for the remainder of the night. 


I usually don't write reviews, but I was so upset with Sensi that I felt the need to disclose and forewarn others about my experience. I will never go back to Sensi and I will be following up with the food department of Nevada. I've never felt that sick in my life. And for them to ruin our dining experience and then our night? Wow... Spend your hard earn money elsewhere!!!",N_DHUFVvpDiwcAuFIT_4PQ,2,0,1,W9hv7XJyzKcybln_QmdOlg
237424,2013-08-16,1,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"This review is based entirely on the bar service because we decided to remain at the bar to order our entree. 

The hubby and I actually just stopped in for a quick drink on our way back to our hotel room and the bartender was amazing. We ordered his suggestion of a black crush and Plymouth rock. PHENOMENAL!! 

The black crush had fresh muddled blackberries and was so yummy! I don't even really like gin which is what was in the Plymouth Rock, but the fresh blueberries and mint infused within the drink made it taste amaze balls! 

The bartender we had was super friendly and knowledgeable and we ended up changing our dinner plans to come back to the bar after freshening up in our hotel room. We were not disappointed upon returning. All of the bartenders were friendly, and ALL the drinks we ordered were absolutely amazing.",4kNX6J250i1dQpqU--409g,0,0,5,R-Aq9ASmV6BXDvSaMGSnSQ
237743,2007-05-15,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"We all know that when someone says ""Thanks for your patience,"" what they really mean is ""I know we really lagged, and we're glad you didn't yap about it too much.""  I think we were thanked for our patience four times in our dining experience at Sensi: first when we had to wait half an hour to be seated (despite our reservations), second and third involved when the food was slowly making it's way to our table, and fourth as we practically sprinted out to make our show.  And as someone else mentioned, it's an odd location within the Bellagio for such a sleek and sassy restaurant, so it took us a while to even find it. 

Maybe it's because I'm just so darn patient, but despite its shortcomings I really liked this place anyway.  The menu is one of the more unique I've seen, with creative Asian dishes living alongside Tandoori grill items and traditional fish.  Resisting eating my weight in bread topped with some sort of herby creamed cheese, we started with the lobster/ crab rolls, which came out on a fancy block of ice.  I had the scallop/ halibut as my main dish, and while I'm not quite sure what everything on my plate was (pea puree?  raviolis filled with something tasty?  cauliflower??), it was absolutely delicious.  My mama had the Tandoori mixed grill, which came with possibly the most amazing naan bread I've ever had, overflowing with sauteed red onions and topped with chili flakes.  Papa had some sort of steak, an option which literally provided him with a giant chunk of red meat and nothing else.  As I don't eat meat, I wasn't impressed, but he seemed to dig it.  We also ordered the carmelized onion mashed potatoes (a little salty but delish) and the broccoli rabe (a little mushy for my taste), so luckily we were stuffed enough to not care that we didn't have time for dessert.",6-g-qJHCNrdmlz_EMQ4wgQ,2,1,4,exQCB7OaHi2uU3_7IOGQGw

290837,2007-09-04,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"Overall, a good experience at Sensi - probably 3.5 stars but I'll round up because I did enjoy the food.

I went with my fiancee, and she got the ahi trio (can't remember how each piece of the trio was prepared). I do remember, however, that it seemed pretty standard, no flavors that were truly astounding. I got the shrimp tacos, which were absolutely amazing. 3 Little shrimp tacos in a very flaky crust with a great sweet sauce.

Dinner was good. I had some sort of meat combination that had chicken, fish, and steak, combined with naan and some curry. all of it was well prepared and the flavors were clean. The naan was the best part, it was a great garlicky naan that had a really good flavor. Fiancee had the short rib, which was good, but definitely not the best short rib I'd ever tried (she agreed with this assessment)

A couple of bad points - waiters were very courteous, but it felt like the whole meal was a bit rushed, especially given that the restaurant wasn't that crowded (we were done in a little over an hour, and that's because we were taking our time as much as possible). Also, I think the place is a bit overpriced, total bill was 170 before tip, and given that we only had 3-4 drinks with our meal, for what we were served, it just seemed a bit high.",T1l4rxTdwH1OjQnUXtdakA,0,0,4,VbyHuMPkItjC0Ca8xrO8uw
332960,2011-03-23,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"We ate at Sensi on 3/20/11 and had a wonderful experience. From the ambiance, the attentive staff, and the fishbowl kitchen... all of it exceeded expectations. I'm an aspiring chef, well I like to watch Food Network, and being able to watch the chefs in the glassed-in kitchen prepare the meal was like being a kid in a candy store.

We arrived shortly after the beginning of dinner service and the place was pretty empty. By the time we left 90 minutes later, most tables were occupied and there was a large group (conference or something) in what I assume was a banquet room in the back. They were a little noisy but it wasn't too bad.

For appetizers, we had the TLC (tempura lobster crab) roll and the Crispy Fried Shrimp, both of which were amazing. The shrimp were a bit too sweet for my taste, but the wife gobbled them up. The TLC roll was very delicious, and an interesting twist on a sushi roll. It's a spendy treat, however, since after tax/tip you're looking at about 28 bucks a plate, containing 4 bite-sized appetizers. Those good with math will spot the 7-dollars-a-bite price. Totally worth it though!

The bread service was naan with four sauces... yogurt, curry, soy, and sweet chili. Pretty good naan, but part of that might just be that we hadn't had the delightful substance for quite a while. Not bad for free food..

For entree, we had the butter curry chicken and the mushroom ravioli, both of which were great. The ravioli was served with stewed oxtail, and was tasty. Wife liked the curry, too.

Definitely recommend Sensi... We escaped for $125 plus tip: two appetizers, two half-glasses of wine, two (lower-priced) entrees. Go there for yourself!",k8Ij9RW--FvRv0dWF0zwZQ,0,0,5,6mnynSQ3X0ZVj06v79Ke2g

I got the Miso Glazed Salmon, which was the best salmon I have ever had. The salmon was perfectly cooked and tasted wonderful!! It is definitely a place I will go to again whenever I come back to Vegas. 

With that being said the reason I gave 4 vs. 5 stars is although the staff was extremely nice and pleasant the service was slow throughout the whole experience (as an FYI if you have to make it somewhere at a certain point).

535267,2010-07-12,2,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"Overall, eating at Bellagio's Sensi is a gamble... albeit one with reasonably good odds. ""Sensi"" is Italian for ""senses"" although it is mostly Indian food, not Italian. Research SPECIFIC DISHES you want to order as ""sensi"" is also apparently Vegas-speak for ""inconsistent"". Some dishes were serious knock-outs and some were not much better than my time at the blackjack tables.

WTF is so good about the famous ginger ale? It was way too sour -- it tasted like unsweetened lemonade with a heavy dose of ground ginger. Maybe that's how the Italians like it, but I couldn't finish it.

We had several dishes from the prix fixe menu. The naan was good, but it was burnt (yes, literally, black char marks) and kind of unspecial. The cucumber, tomato-jalape√±o and sweet chutneys were tasty. The crispy shrimp tasted disappointingly like any other fried food and the flat iron steak was both unremarkable and inconsistently cooked. But, the chicken in creamy butter curry sauce kicked some serious ass... order it (especially if you like chicken tikka masala)! Beware the wine pairings -- they were good pairs, but by my math it would have been cheaper to order 3oz pours of each pairing rather than go with the prix fixe pricing.

Gotta give a special WTF to the tater tots. F---ing tater tots... seriously? They do not belong. ""Dear Sensi: If you'd told me the tater tots were pakoras I would have LOVED them. You're an Indian restaurant (excuse me, Asian-fusion restaurant), not Denny's. Please edit accordingly.""

Desserts were good, and the gelato/sorbet's ice bowl is a stunning conversation piece. The coconut gelato, according to Mrs. WTF, tasted like frozen Hawaiian Tropic, and not in a good way. The salted caramel ice cream is uniquely delicious.

And yes, fine dining + Vegas = expensive. But the service is attentive and Sensi's prices are not out of whack with other quality alternatives. WTF did you expect?",U29hXtrsUpS6RX2WkvYMbA,2,1,4,07-vjaXKT1-aLta0rbvrSA

First course: Thai coconut and shrimp soup served in a coconut with lemongrass.  The flavors worked so well and took me back to Southeast Asia immediately.

Second course: Kalbi-style flat iron steak served with kimchi and grilled bok choy and tempura bone marrow.  The beef was marinated really well and flavorful.

Third course: Tapioca pudding served with mango lassi and coconut sorbet.  The trio worked really well since you go from sweet to sour to sweet and back and forth.  Lol.

The inside is very calming and cool, and I LOVED how you could look in and see the chefs cooking in the centrally located kitchen with glass. Throughout the meal we even saw chefs running various food items to different kitchens.

We sat down and ordered some cocktails which we loved. I can't remember which ones we got, but they were girly and delicious and super fresh.

The different cuisines on the menu made it a great place to go to try a variety of things. We split the Pot Sticker appetizer (came with 5) and enjoyed them. For $18 the portion was probably a little small but we enjoyed non-the-less. We were nervous about portion size after this so my co-worker and I ordered 2 sides with our meals. The sides were HUGE.

Great hopes, severe disappointment.  Yep, that pretty much sums up my experience at Sensi.

Upon entering Sensi we seated next to a large party of eight and another table that included an infant.  Dozens of empty tables but they plopped us down in that spot.

Tangent: Now, I don't hate small children, I really don't, but I hate being near them in upscale restaurants.  I go to upscale restaurants so I don't have to be near them and hear them scream.  Yes, kids are adorable and are the future, blah, blah, blah, but I am not paying $50 pp to listen to a stranger's child cry.  

Okay, so, yes, the child screamed/yelled/stared at me through the meal and the large party of eight, who apparently never learned the concept of ""inside voices,"" aurally overwhelmed the restaurant's other diners.  This is not entirely the restaurant's fault, however, but they could have handled the situation better.  The noise pretty much ruined the meal.

The food was pretty disappointing too.  My restaurant week menu included the steamed Chinese buns, the grass-fed skirt steak, and the chocolate temptation.

The Chinese steamed buns may have been the worst thing I've eaten in awhile.  The dried-shrimp filling, which was incredibly salty, combined with the unbearably sweet hoisin vinagarette sauce, was almost unpalatable.  DO NOT WANT.

The skirt steak was fine but it was a rather small portion.  It included expertly-made brussel sprouts and spaghetti squash.  I hate brussel sprouts but I loved these!  This dish saved the experience from being an epic disaster.

The chocolate temptation was basically a ferrero rocher candy bar topped with insanely burnt-tasting caramel ice cream.  It was okay, but also kind of gross (the ice cream overwhelmed the entire dish).

We had very little interaction with our waiter but he seemed nice enough.  Not particularly helpful or attentive, however.  I went on a Wednesday specifically so I would get better service (less busy = attentive service, right?), but that wasn't the case here.

Sad to say, it gets 1.5 stars.  The only bright spots were the skirt steak and awesome naan bread basket (free with meal).  Blargh.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,2,0,2,L7FExKkKEZly6JxpcG4Bbg

We had some extraordinary meals there. Maybe it was an off night, but our latest experience wasn't anything close to the Sensi we remembered from not even a year ago.  

Ambiance and decor is still outstanding . . . and one of the few places in the area that is not overwrought with 20-something women in stilettos and men in their saggy jeans. 

There were ample items on the menu that sounded delicious, but in reality did not live up to our expectations. Unlike one of the previous posters, we found the Sensi Roll Call sampler almost too ambitious with a combination of flavors that left a sour aftertaste.  We also had the Sensi Original Noodle. While the combination of the various items reminded us of something along the line of a pad thai or chow fun type dish, it was actually heavily laden with cumin. Oh, how I wish the item description would have said so . . . cumin, while a great antioxidant, is one of my least favorite herbs . . . so disappointed.

The house-made naan bread was stellar . . . I could have eaten at least two bread baskets all by myself! The best part of the entire meal . . .

1033565,2016-12-17,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"ate here this week - i am a local here in Las Vegas - and i am sorry - but the food here was NOT GOOD AT ALL

tasteless, bland, under seasoned, undercooked

i personally had the lobster which was $50 - without a doubt - THE WORST LOBSTER I HAVE EVER EATEN 

that is pretty sad

i ordered it grilled, which came with no seasoning, no butter, nothing - the lobster was incredibly tiny and hard to believe it could possibly be 1.5 lbs as described in the menu - i have eaten lobster my entire life - and have never had one so small or so bad - the egg roe was overkill and still in the shell - the claws had obviously been steamed (rather, boiled) and were dripping wet with absolutely no flavor - even with the grilling of the remainder of this tiny lobster - it was undercooked and flavorless

the side was some sort of supposed risotto - i assume - but it was cold - barely warm and tasted like water - nothing - no flavor and horrible consistency

did not eat

i also ordered the heirloom tomato salad with ""homemade"" mozzarella - there was one itty bitty slice - who could possibly taste if it were ""homemade"" or not?  
at best - it was also just OK
i make a better salad at home with a store bought fresh mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes - that i select - and i serve enough for a normal person to enjoy a small salad plate

the portions are incredibly tiny - this is not tapas - but expect tapas sized plates & portions

lobster:  $50 
heirloom salad:  $16
one drink:  $28

even though i am a local and i understand that food on the strip is exorbitantly priced - i still expect that when we do decide to partake in dinner on the strip, it actually be halfway good for the prices charged

$200 + tip for dinner for us both - we had no drinks with dinner - that would have made it at least $250-$300 - crazy prices for low quality mediocre food 

it was not

will never return 

highly mediocre quality and taste - i could do better at home

the service was NOT ""top notch"" as described - my waiter grabbed my fork with his hand while moving my salad plate (DID NOT OFFER TO REPLACE OR APOLOGIZE IN ANY WAY) and then when i asked what was in the lobster shell (because never in my life have i seen such an abundance of lobster roe) he pointed his finger at my food and practically touched it - IT WAS RIDICULOUS - waiters serving in this environment should have more training, class, manners, and respect for the patrons and their food on their plates

i didn't even like our table - which was next to a hallway with open wood bars where you can hear people talking and heading out for a night of partying.  REAL CLASSY BELLAGIO.  i realize this is a design flaw, but surely patrons paying hundreds for meals expect a little class & privacy to enjoy it

obviously the people posting these reviews have EXTREMELY LOW STANDARDS for food & service 

we do not

sorry - but i really have nothing good to say about this restaurant, and we will not return

1072089,2007-02-15,6,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"It's too bad that I've taken so long in getting around to writing a review of Sensi, so unless you trust my long-term memory, I'd suggest ignoring most of this review and just going with the recommendation to eat here. I mean, even if you only spend one night in Vegas, this is where you should have dinner. And I should know: I went to two restaurants when I was there, and this one was better.

In all seriousness, though, Sensi was my first (yes, of two) introduction to the fancy restaurant scene in Vegas. I'd heard a lot about various famous chefs opening new restaurants here, but I figured rather than Nobu Next Door these places would be more like Nobu Up The Block And Around The Corner And Then Take Your Third Left After The Light. In short, I expected mediocre food at exorbitant prices. At Sensi, neither was the case. 

First of all, I for the most part do not care about decor. As long as I'm not knocking knees with another diner, I feel fine with a chair at a table. But this place is so cool. It's very modern and sleek but in a warm way, which is to say you don't get the feeling that your very presence might be ruining the otherwise super cool atmosphere. There's a lot of smooth gray rock all over the place, and water falling down it. It's clean and pleasant. 

And the food is delicious. We had a tuna three ways to start--raw, raw, raw--and it was unique and very tasty. I say ""unique"" because I have several times ordered tuna only to remember, Oh, right, I've had this a million times before. This one tasted like someone actually put some effort into it. We also had a calamari dish, not deep-fried but the sauteed kind, which is much more interesting to me, which came with this amazing lightly breaded cooked tomato. The combination of flavors was lovely and impressive in that it seemed creative but was not at all overpowering. 

Sensi is some kind of fusion between Indian and Japanese and maybe a few other things. Typically the idea of fusion drives me nuts; when I have a PB&J sandwich for dinner with a side of leftover pad thai, I don't go around saying I just made myself a Thai-American fusion meal. But I think they do a pretty good job at Sensi of making everything well enough so that they earn the right to serve different kinds of foods. I guess we started with Japanese? Anyway, for entrees we chose two different kinds of curry, a red shrimp curry and a chicken tikka masala. The latter was sub-standard, by which I mean that it didn't taste as good as chicken tikka masala at my local Indian favorite. But the shrimp was great--and I don't even like shrimp that much! It was high quality (i.e. it actually tasted like something) and it came in this awesome little coconut bowl (real, I think), and the rice was delicious and we got naan bread that was, as good naan bread is, out of this world.

I don't remember the desserts as being that great, but I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to desserts. If it's too sweet I don't like it, if there's orange flavor I don't like it, if there's chocolate mixed with cherry I don't like it. Probably it's a good idea to skip dessert and just buy some Mrs. Fields cookies on your way back to the slot machines.",K_ACjLFC19kUAAeUXIRrbw,4,5,5,41QgeAOBl2rVZAoUOwB5MA

Our group of 4 had reservations at 8:30pm with tickets to see O at 10pm.  We arrived 15 min early and were seated promptly.  We informed our waiter that we had 10pm tickets and he made sure our meal ran smoothly without us feeling rushed.  

The fresh baked naan with the four table sauces was a nice way to start the meal - highly recommend the sweet & spicy Vietnamese sauce, and the cucumber and yogurt sauce.  Add a pinch of the salt to the yogurt, and it's perfect.  We started with  the salt & pepper calamari appetizer - mmmm mmmm put some of that sweet & spicy Vietnamese sauce on there.  For entrees, we ordered the Miso glazed cod, Spicy diver scallops, and the Roasted Striped Bass.  All the entrees by themselves could earn 5 stars!

A wonderful experience all-around.  Because this is a pricey place, we chose to share four appetizers.  All were exceptional; I particularly enjoyed the pot stickers with a (believe it or not) side of foie gras.  I never would have paired them but they were delicious.  The best, though, was the signature lobster appetizer.  A wonderful mix of components with a fantastic sauce.  The appetizer portions were generous.

They price their wines 'way above usual restaurant markups so we settled for two $16 glasses of $16 Oregon Pinot Noir.

We opted for the lemon drop dessert (I'd anything with lemon on it).  It was a meringue delight.

I ate here on my own one night while my traveling companions are seeing a show. Being a foodie I was looking forward to treating myself to some great food. Unfortunately, the food did not really deliver what I was looking for. The best part of the meal was the naan bread and dessert. I ordered the TLC Lobster Roll and Skuna Salmon as per the waiter's recommendation. 

The TLC Roll had some great flavours going on but the rice was very undercooked to the point that is what hard to chew and very chalky. The filling was great but it was ultimately brought down by the rice. 

The salmon was cooked to perfection and had a beautiful crisp on the top. The first few bites were delicious but the very simple flavour profile got repetitive halfway through and the sweetness I originally loved about the dish started to make me feel a bit nauseous. I wanted a ""wow"" dish and this was just a simple salmon that I can cook myself at home. So although pretty good it was a letdown.

For dessert I had the Chocolate Delight which was great. Not the best dessert I've ever had but the level of complexity in this dessert was what I was hoping I'd have in all 3 courses. It had a great variety of textures and flavours that all balanced each other perfectly. 

I also had a cocktail called The Matador that was pretty good. 

If I had based this review on food alone I would have given this place 3 stars because my whole meal was good but nothing special. Maybe it's because I come from a city renowned for it's restaurants and am used to a higher standard but this was all pretty standard stuff. The big highlight of this place and the reason I gave it 4 stars was the exceptional service. I was checked on very often and the waiters and busboys were extremely cordial. The little truffle box that everyone gets with their bill is also a nice touch that put a smile on all their faces.

They gave us two baskets of their nicely seasoned naan bread that comes with four dipping sauces. I can't remember what all of them were, but the sweet chili sauce was my favorite. Yum!

For appetizer we ordered the beef tenderloin carpaccio that is served on top of horseradish potatoes and sprinkled with pecorino cheese. It was pretty good and definitely different from the other beef carpaccios that I've had before. One of my friends ordered the prix fixe menu which came with the crispy shrimp ( Rice Flake Crust, Calamansi Mayonnaise, Buddah Hand Citrus) for appetizer. We all got to try some and it reminded us of Captain Crunch cereal with a nice citrusy flavor which I liked. I also ordered the Plymouth Rock cocktail, easy on the gin, which was delicious and matched the color of my dress. 

For dinner one of my friends and I shared the Live Maine Lobster and the signature braised short ribs. Both were really good. My other friend ordered the potato gnocchi which came with slow roasted pork, San Marzano yomatoes, mint, and pine nuts. The pork was tender on the inside with a nice crispy outer layer which was pretty good as well. The halibut and spice rubbed chicken in butter curry sauce that other friends ordered looked pretty good as well and there weren't any complaints from anyone.

For dessert the prix fixe menu came with the chocolate tempation (Layers of Silky Milk Chocolate, Nuts & Pralin√© Salted Caramel Ice Cream). Yum!

After looking over Sensi's menu, we quickly picked it.  We got there around 8pm & were seated right away.  The ambiance is awesome & the service we received was even better.

Appetizer:
- Duck confit Steamed Buns with pineapple chutney;  comes with two & were DELISHES!
- Roasted pork jowl w/crispy ear, lime & chili, rice & an over easy egg: on the menu this was labeled ""#betterthanporkbelly,"" so we had to try it.  Be sure to order this when you're there.  

entr√©e:
- Skuna Bay Salmon: miso glazed, mizuna, soy butter & shitake  mushrooms.  This was cooked perfectly!  
- My husband had the Diver Scallops & they were dusted with curry powder w/veggies and rice.  I tried some of his scallops & they were perfect as well.

Dessert:
You can view the dessert menu from their iPad & they provide pictures of all the desserts, along with explanations for each.  We decided to share the Chocolate Temptation (chocolate & hazelnut bar w/salted caramel ice cream.  Imagine a Ferrero Rocher in a bar form & this is what you'll have.  This was a great way to end our meal.

We went to Sensi one night, and it was actually pretty good, despite the usual Vegas hype.  The place is very pretty, with the kitchen open to view behind glass, and rock and granite walls with water washing over them.  

We ate our way through oysters, Kobe beef carpaccio, a green salad (that cost $18! - give me a break), a lovely duck confit and Colorado lamb.  Portions, as noted in other reviews, are small, but tasty. The service was typical Vegas obsequious, including my pet peeve - calling customers ""you guys"".  There was a very long wait between the appetizers and main course, which was somewhat annoying.

1) Service (1 star) - While the waiter was hiding behind the wall, the food runner was filling our drinks and had to go after the waiter each time we needed something. 

2) Appetizer (1 star): Assorted rolls - Disgusting. No flavor, and overpriced. Tasted like something I would buy from Trader Joes.

3) Pita Bread & Dipping Sauce (5 Stars) - The best part of the meal. The pita bread was fresh, and the dips were amazing. Why couldn't the main courses be similar?

4) Tuna Consera (1 star) - Very tasteless. Didn't taste like anything. It didn't taste fresh, or cooked. Something in between. Tasted like sesame seeds.

5) Ribs (1 star) - Took one bight, and left it alone. My cafeteria serves better food.

The porkchop itself was fine, but the various sauces and garnishes made the dish amazing.  The curry chicken dish was equally amazing, enhanced by what the server told us was a spicy mango chutney (that I would have sworn had no mango in it).

I've had this establishment bookmarked for quite some time, and it appears there was a time during which this place was missing the mark. I am glad that it wasn't the case in this instance. 

We had a reservation for 9:15pm, arrived a bit early and sat at the bar while waiting for our table. As far as Vegas fine dining goes, I was not overly impressed by the design or the decor of this place. I like simplistic, but this was overly so and it looked like the furniture needed some updating. We were seated at 9pm and had a great view of the open kitchen. It reminded me of a fish tank.

We opted for the chef's tasting menu ($85 per person) which is is very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. Our server was great... he was like Beetlejuice -- appeared when we needed him, left us alone otherwise. We started off with a bread basket and two dipping sauces, one being of spicier variety to go with the naan bread that was served. It was a bit confusing to me and I wasn't sure how naan was tied into the whole theme of the menu, but I digress.

My husband and I each ordered different things off the chef's tasting menu so that we can sample everything on it. In addition, we ordered half a dozen oysters and also Octopus Crostini which for me was by far the most underwhelming part of the meal. I thoroughly enjoyed the cauliflower soup, the scallop was cooked to PERFECTION and to me scallops are the ultimate test of one's culinary prowess, Tongue & Cheek was packed with flavor and the Hanger Steak was juicy and cooked to perfection.

My only complaint is that toward the end of the evening, the meal spacing became way too long and I was starting to feel too full to enjoy my dessert (Greek Yogurt panna cotta). I think we were getting antsy to get dinner over with and continue on with our night.

The bill was reasonable and the food as well as the service both hit the mark. I would highly recommend the chef's tasting menu.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,9,6,4,-3kA-0cArZpffXFeHi_jeQ

The complimentary bread basket with slices of naan bread and pappadam (fried version) with two dipping sauces (tamarind and raita) was unbelievably good and fresh - like straight from an oven. The other real good dish was the octopus salad - it had the softest, juiciest octopus pieces on a bed of greens and well seasoned roasted potatoes.  The small caper berries gave a nice acidic taste.

The main entrees were decent, but not at the current price point I think.  Miso glazed salmon was flavored well but slightly overcooked, and could have benefited with a side of white rice to balance out the richness.  This made us order a side of fried rice which wasn't too special.  The short rib and butternut squash ravioli was good and colorful, as was the tandoori butter chicken with basmati rice.  Chicken was very juicy - we've had tandoori chicken and butter chicken as separate dishes but never as a hybrid dish!  Both of these dishes were over $30 each though.

For dessert, the pistachio panna cotta was cold, smooth and delicious.  Had complex layers of berries and fruits between the green cream.  Presentation was absolutely beautiful.  

Service and ambiance were great, and I like the open kitchen in the center of the restaurant.  The bathroom despite having only one stall was very clean and sleek looking.  They do give you a free that of truffle chocolates when you leave, which is great.

Would give more stars at a lower price point - since appetizers are almost as expensive as the entrees.  Cocktails are expensive ($14 each), but you can opt for their excellent homemade ginger ale ($6).",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,2,0,3,zS-7-gK5gcJw8YOcV9X_Gw

We seriously considered eating there a second night. Our waiter was a British fella named Lawrence from Alabama (yeah that was interesting) but he was extremely entertaining. He is by far the best waiter we've had at any restaurant. 

The food was so fresh and flavorful. We appreciated that they source local and sustainable foods and grow their own herbs and some veggies. We had the crispy fried shrimp and the crab-lobster maki roll for appetizers. Both were excellent with outstanding flavorful sauces. My wife had the curry scallops which were incredible and not a normal way to have scallops but might be the best when it comes to flavor fusion. The scallops were perfectly prepared. I had the fresh catch of the day which was line caught tuna, on spaghetti squash. It was super yummy and fresh. It was actually more than I could eat. No small plates here. There were baby purple potatoes on my plate too which tasted like they were dug that morning; I know because I grow my own food. For dessert we had two dessert wines. Two white wines with the dinner brought the tab to $200 not including tip. 

The atmosphere was very sensual as the name suggests. The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant with glass panes so you can see everything. Lawrence would explain to us what they were doing in the kitchen. We were placed with a perfect view of everything. 

The night we went (a Tuesday night) was quiet and slow. It shouldn't have been as slow as it was; this might be the best kept secret in Vegas.

We stopped by for an early dinner before our flight out.  The decor is light maple wood along with stainless steel and loads of granite.  Very modern, yet organic at the same time.  

Location was odd, by the Bellagio hotel elevators and bypassing the spa and conservatory area.  Just out of place.  Placement is key and Sensi is like a fish out of water.  

The energy in the restaurant was not like the hip trendy ones, but definitely more along the lines of business casual.  

Sensi translates to the 'senses' in Italian.  It's a fusion of Southeast Asian, American, Japanese and Italian flavors.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  The menu is vast ranging from pizzas to sushi to pasta.  We decided to do family style and mostly appetizers:

Wine ain't cheap here.
Pinot Grigio $12
Reisling $18

Kobe Carpaccio $19 
Slices of thin meat wrapped around a potato croquette and generous shavings of parmesan.  Loved the textures and flavors.  Nice change from the traditional version paired with toast.

Lobster Rolls $20
Presented in a block of ice and stuffed with fresh crab and lobster.  Slightly spicy and delicious! 

Tataki & Tartar $20 
Tuna in disguised three ways: tartar, tataki, and spicy.

Angry Scallops $19
8 pieces of raw scallops trembling ever so slightly before us.  

Malaysian Satay $15
The only disappointment.  Generous portions, but just a little too much cumin and the meat reminded me of ground meat slapped on a stick.  

Chocolate Temptation $10
Cake with fudge on the inside, a milkshake with a chocolate straw and ice cream.  Tiny, scrumptious and delightful.  

You know what I hate about most Asian fusions??!?!  No FREE bread, yeah, yeah it's ASIAN, throw me some free ANYTHING: a bowl of rice, edamame.  Sensi has fabulous CRUSTY bread served WARM.  Heaven!!!  Four different dips for the bread, along with butter and soft cheese.  Sensory overload.  I love options and variety.

1)  The atmosphere is a little too quiet for me.  I mean, it is almost library quiet.  That's a wee bit odd for a Vegas restaurant.  
2)  There is only 1 stall per sex.  This means there is a line constantly...and it wasn't all that clean.  

Other than that, this place is spot on.  The decor is pretty and fun.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  The food is SOOOOO good.  We ordered so many things and I can't remember the names of all of them.  However, everything that we ordered was delicious...not one complaint!!!

The balance of flavors, the service ( our waiter Laurence was so knowledgeable and entertaining), the venue- it's pretty tucked away in the back of Bellagio, but you feel worlds away from everything. Very open and airy, after being in the scorching hot Vegas sun and the smokey casinos. 

We had:
- Blackberry cocktails (with Hangar One vodka- can't go wrong here!!)
- Naan bread: mix the two sauces it comes with, yum!
- TLC roll: very flavorful, a little bit crispy. Delicious.
- Avocado beignets : I've never had fired avocado before, but this was yummy, especially with the tomato sauce they serve it with. 
- Oxtail buns: these were very very heavy but so flavorful.
- Filet Mignon, with sides of mushrooms, fried rice, and broccoli. The filet was good, though a tad dry ( and I order mine medium rare). Mushrooms were amazing. Fried rice also good. Broccoli was a bit bland, but I was so overwhelmed with the other amazing flavors that that was somehow bound to happen.

And when we do, we do it in a big way, Vegas-style, of course.  And on one night, we had to take one of our clients for dinner.

Enter Sensi...this after we've called a few dozen restaurants for a reservation with no luck. 

So yes, Sensi was our last resort and I'm absolutely glad dinner was on company expense because if I was going to pay for it on my own, you won't see me here. 

No value whatsover for your money.

Let me explain, lest my review is removed again for lack of ""first-hand experience"" (yeah, whatever).

Let's start with the menu. Well, it's limited and  a mish-mash of Asian and Italian-inspired dishes, with a couple of meats and fishes thrown in as a after-thought. And, oh, they don't have any special.

The service was lacking or rather we didn't see the server unless we call him. And I won't normally do that in a restaurant. Besides, it's his job to regularly check on his table. Not the other way around where I have to see who's missing something on our party and tell  it to the server. 

And when we're served with what we have ordered, well, I'm speechless. Speechless because I can't really say something about it. And take it as a bad thing. It just lacked some umph. I was really hoping that dessert would somehow save Sensi, but no.

We ordered a TLC roll and a tasting menu for dinner. Because both of us were not very hungry, we decided to have a quick dinner and share everything. 

The TLC Role was pretty good. My recommendation is to get Roy's tasting menu. Everything on there was delicious and well worth the price (about 90 dollars). The scallops, pork chop, donut dessert, and sashimi was all delicious (that was our choices for our tasting menu). 

The service was impeccable. I was just so pleasantly surprised by this restaurant because it was never on my radar, but everything was spot on and delicious. 

The kitchen is open so you get to see them make your food. The nan bread is complementary and a great way to start the dinner.

The one sole critique (very very minor) is that our scallops were over seasoned. Chunks of salt took away the delicateness of scallops.

My friends and I happened on this place one night during our stay for their 21st birthdays and walked up on a Friday night and asked for a table for 6 at 10pm.

We were seated right by the kitchen surrounded by glass at a table with a VIP vibe, seemingly secluded but still in the way of foot traffic.

The drinks were pretty good (blackberry currant seemed to be the favorite, while the asian persuasion left me needing to be persuaded to finish it), but the food was amazing. It's been months since I ate there so I can't remember exactly what was ordered but the curry was perfect, the cod was tasty, the spring rolls were okay, the tartare was not, ... that's really as far as I can remember.

Bottom line: great modern and natural atmosphere, service is attentive while not overbearing (even near closing! what a concept), appetizers aren't the best but the entrees are beautiful both on the plate and in your mouth.

Poutine good, but as a former Quebecer, I prefer it home style (with real curds). My U.S. colleagues had never had poutine and really liked it. Sprouts were just good roasted sprouts.

I've been around the world and eaten at some of the finest restaurants and never have I received such awful customer service. After a so-so meal (they were out of oysters, shrimp, and crab and the kobe beef was ok and a little cold and everything was so infused with ginger especially the sea bass), I came to find that there was shattered glass on the side of my chair and on the floor. 
    How did I find the glass? A few pieces were jabbed in to my hand when I went to get up from my chair. After notifying management who did nothing more than clean up the glass, I was left to pick the pieces of glass out of my bleeding hand. Nothing more was said from our waiter or management. Not even an apology or offering of a Band-Aid. After leaving the restaurant about 30 minutes later and consulting with my dad (who owns a hotel and restaurant himself) I decided to call and speak with Veronica (manager) regarding my poor experience. She was extremely rude and defensive and said that in these situations the only thing they would have done would be to call security to get the glass out of my hand. Appalled that she was not taking this situation seriously, I spoke with her manager only to find that Veronica had lied about my experience stating that she had called security but that I had left before they came. It's an obvious admission of guilt of dealing with my situation when the manager has to lie to her manager regarding this experience.

The Skinny: great fusion asian cuisine and lovin' the bread service (4) service: efficient, prompt and friendly - I want to take the naan guy home!(4.5) value: for 50.10, it's not bad for a fine dining experience but the ethnic food is likely cheaper somewhere else(3).

We've been wanting to try Sensi ever since we had their tasting at Taste of the Nation. My hubby was hesitant - he's not that into East Indian, Vietnamese and Thai flavours (except Pad see-uw... excuse the spelling).

We love the dining room here. The view of the kitchens accompanied by flowing water everywhere, the design is truly lovely.

Anyway, we ordered fried shrimp with citrus, market mixed green salad, butter chicken, skirtsteak with green papaya salad.

But first, let's start out with bread service. Bread service consists of papadums and handmade naan out of a two real clay ovens installed in the kitchens. Although it didn't have quite the same elasticity and crispiness of the best naan I've ever had, it was still pretty darn good. Adding the tomato chutney, I just wanted to take the lovely East Indian naan-making gentleman home with me. (He's really nice - when we made hand signals of how much we like his naan - he sent out another fresh basket for us!)

The fried shrimp was satisfyingly crisp and well seasoned. The market salad was equally pleasurable with the hint of bitterness of the lettuces and acidity from the citrus. Very well balanced dishes.

I thoroughly enjoyed the grilled marinated skirtsteak (right amount of char) and nicely spiced accompanying green papaya salad. The green papaya was shaved so delicately, it looked like glass noodles. Wonderful flavour and textures. The butter chicken was nice along with the rice but it wasn't extraordinary.

Dessert was okay but not exceptional. The chocolate temptation dessert was overly sweet while the caramel ice cream had a very heavy burnt sugar flavouring to it. The tapioca pudding was rather flavourless when paired with that wonderful mango lassi and coconut ice cream.

Value wise, you can likely find each individual components for less else where (I'm sure you can get a decent butter chicken or green papaya salad for less than $50/person). However the service is wonderful and the ambience is amazing.

I would say normally, this place would deserve a 3.5 star. However in light of the exceptional bread service, I'm bumping it up to a 4 star review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,8,7,4,Y-_-zuuRO9514LPUdWzwZA

Sensi is a beautiful restaurant tucked down a hallway in the Bellagio hotel. Four Diamond restaurant = superb customer service + delicate food.  I've had the pleasure of dining in the private dining room, at the bar and in the dining room. An open kitchen sits in the middle of the main dining room so you can watch the chefs at work. Watching them make the naan bread is entertaining AND makes my mouth water! 
Sensi is super luxurious, clean and crafty. Asian fusion restaurants usually scare me, but I'm surprised by how comforting Sensi made me feel. I blame it on the ambiance! Their menu offers various flavors for even the most discerning palates. The lobster (think the one I had was a special of the day because it wasn't on the menu. This was in 2008 though) and any of the steaks =YUM! The portions aren't out of control big which gives you plenty of room to indulge in dessert. House made ginger ale is refreshing and a must for ginger ale fans. OH! The menu changes often. I assume they do this based on availability of product.

You see, we had the Chef's table, next to the kitchen, in this somewhat secluded space for our dinner which we weren't rushing through.  Midway through our meal, P.Ewing himself comes strolling through the restaurant with his entourage, sees that our table is occupied, loses his smile and sulks over to another table that clearly is not as roomy for the big guy.  Sorry Pat.  But when you're celebrating the father-in-law's Bday and one of the guests is the Attorney General of NV, hoops players get the shaft.

The place was on the dark side with lots of earthy materials, rocks, stone sides, etc.  Even the plates and silverware had caveman-esqe flair to them.  The food was good with my wife and I sharing her scallop dish and my rib-eye.  Come to think of it, I think half of our table got the rib-eye so it was pretty popular.  This place has a strange menu with a few things from different types of cuisines.  Some American, some Asian, and I think some Indian too.

We had lunch here, and I ordered the sashimi plate + 3 oysters.  Wow.  The presentation was amazing.  The food, delicious.  My coworkers ordered their special bento box and they said that while everything Japanese was yummy, the ravioli was just so-so.  We also had a vegetarian coworker with us, and he ordered the phad thai and that looked good too.  Different types of noodle than what I am used to with phad thai but it still looked yummy.

You can't forget the naan that came as bread either.  Super good.  Not to mention the home made ginger ale.  YUMMY!

And then there was dessert.  Again, amazing presentation and super tasty.  The 32 degree sorbet came in an ice igloo.

I left her alone that morning to puke it out, sleep it off, or whatever would make her feel better.

Sensi is a very relaxing place with a variety of cuisine.  Indian, Asian, and plain ole American food were all represented.

2- the Negroni cocktail was disgusting. They did replace it for me but they should simply remove it from the menu

WOW. Amazing. There is a guy in the kitchen making the naan all night, I watched him do it. Hand rolled, cooked on the grill. The freshest FRESHY FRESH you could ever imagine. Yes.

Muscles and clams with chorizo for an appetizer. Excellent. 

I had the Sensi noodles - like asian noodles, they come with shrimp and tofu. Excellent and most places seem to get shrimp rubbery, this was amazing. Perfect and tender, and a HUGE portion. Like almost Claim Jumper sized ( if you know what I mean ).  My husband got the lamb, he did not care for it, his portion size was more average.

Service here is good. This is more casual than other restaurants at Bellagio, seems more so than Olives or Yellowtail etc...  but not SO casual. They give you a little 'gift box' at the end of your meal with some really great chocolate truffles in it as well, very nice.

Move on to our waiter, Lawrence; funny, attentive, helpful and just well...again part of the overall charm of the restaurant. 

They place naan down with two sauces, a cool cucumber and a spiced up tomato one I believe - there is an Indian chef making it there while you watch. Our first course was the Summer salad; grilled peaches+apricot, arugula, white balsamic, burrata cheese (ingredients change based on time of year) $15. The cheese melted on your tongue - perfect blend of ingredients nothing overpowering. 
Next came the Thai, coconut, lemongrass soup with morel mushrooms - normally I would NEVER eat a mushroom - I ate all of the (okay, my husband stole a few) - you can eat most of the bowl, the coconut is so tender you can peel it off with your spoon.

Moved on to the gnocchi with vegetables for $17 - lightly browned in butter again, melted in your mouth. We ordered a side of tempura asparagus and this has a tomato dipping sauce! I had a ginger ale with lime that they make there so freshing and after too much red wine the night before - a nice break ($6.00).

Most folks were casually dressed before the 8:00 hour summer dresses or nice jeans with nice tops and sweaters. A few families with children but mostly adults. The music in the background was Sting and such. Table made of natural wood and the background blended as well.

Oh and there is a woman who politely asked if you want your photo. We don't usually say yes to photos but thought okay why not and glad. She did a wonderful job. $20 for small (2 photos in silver fabric frames $45 for large).

The ambiance is great.  Lots of glass, lots of really cool-looking stone (including our massive 7-person table, which was nestled in an alcove which jutted into the large glass-walled kitchen).  Great view of an awkward-looking rendezvous in which a man seemed to be trying really hard to impress his much-younger-looking date.

The food was interesting.  The bread was naan, which came with chutney, tzatziki sauce, and some other stuff I don't remember because it was 2 months ago. Unfortunately, the waiters never bothered explaining that to us--we had to play detective and figure that stuff out ourselves.  In terms of stuff that we actually paid for, most of the stuff I tasted (duck/foie gras potstickers, tataki roll, Thai coconut soup, and short ribz) was outstanding.  In particular, the soup came in a real coconut, which you could scrape off the sides and mix into the broth.  Awesome!  I also tasted the branzino, which one of my friends ordered.  That wasn't as good, probably because it had gotten soggy after soaking in clam broth for 20 minutes before I was able to grab a bite.  That probably wasn't Sensi's fault.

I'm a sucker for anything water-related, so one glance at the sleek, black water walls surrounding this place (the bar is a beauty too) and I immediately begged my boyfriend to bring us back for dinner. Luckily, we were catching Cirque du Soleil's ""O"" in the same place later that night, so we decided to add in a dinner date before the show.

* Ambiance: With black water walls surrounding the exterior, boulder-like walls in the hosting area, and dimmed lighting, it almost feels like you're entering a cave. The inside of the restaurant is very sleek with just a delicate brush of modern Asian flair. I like that the sushi/seafood kitchen and wine cellar is enclosed in a glass room in the middle of the restaurant so you can watch the chefs at work.

* Food: Since we were in a time crunch, we ordered wine and cold sake and went straight for entrees. I was sad I couldn't try any of the appetizer specialty rolls (they sounded divine!), but at least the complimentary hot-and-fresh-out-of-the-oven naan bread and sauces (I liked the Vietnamese sweet chili one the best) were delicious starters.

When my plate arrived - fat, fluffy salmon cuts shimmering in the dim light due to the generous amount of miso glaze slathered on - I couldn't wait to dive in. My boyfriend's Kalbi steak was also delicious and perfect. If we had time to sample appetizers and desserts, I'd feel more confident in giving a Sensi a 5. I was at war with myself on whether we had time to get dessert (luckily, my beau is more practical than I am), but at least they sent us off with a small box of yummy chocolate truffles to munch on during ""O""!

* Service: All the staff members here were extremely pleasant. Top-notch service for a top-notch place! There was also a Bellagio photographer walking around offering to take pictures, and they turned out so nice that we figured ""what the hell"" and succumbed to buying two large photos for $45. There's my ""we're in Vegas, baby!"" attitude talking.

I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're staying in The Bellagio. If not, it's worth a walk in the dry Vegas heat. ;)",To0q4_30dIF2Cc05NW6ROg,2,2,4,J2jhctNmhVW4V8Q7gwjQag
2878221,2011-01-19,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,I tried Sensi the year it opened and was so impressed.  I've made it a point to hit this restaurant every time I go to Vegas and it never disappoints.  It is in the spa tower of Bellagio so slightly off the main path.  I actually just went there again this past weekend and it easily has to be my 15th time there in four or five years.  The service is always amazing - from the minute you walk thru the doors.  And the food is unbelievable and priced really well.  I recommend getting the Naan bread - there is an oven and cook devoted to this.  Yum!  And my favorite dishes are the Short Rib or Sea Bass.  There is a new beet salad on the menu that I just had this weekend that inspired me to write this review.  It has Mascarpone and Feta and is to die for.  My hat goes off to the team there and to Chef Martin for making this place a little treasure.,6Z2gNPEPC3zuKlAJbyzRjQ,0,0,5,Ho75QZHNWk27GOkakRhAFw

The restaurant features Asian, Italian and American foods. I had a grilled seabass special which was incredible. The raw oysters as an appetizer are excellent. 

The sorbet was served in a tulip-like ice sculpture. They let me try multiple flavors and I was literally blown away by dessert.

This is an excellent restaurant, but not sure why it's in the Bellagio as the target market would rather have a Claim Jumper or Waffle House. OK, I leave the Bellagio alone as it does have a nice fountain.

I did enjoy the ""crackers"" that came with the naan though. The desserts were nothing special and highly disappointing. The portions are small, though our waiter claimed that they ""increase with each course"". Pfftt.

Another note about our waiter. We just wanted water to drink and instead of offering us tap water like EVERY other table received at the time, he automatically brought us the $8 Acqua Panna bottle. Sigh. However, I do appreciate that he sped up our courses at the end (I notified him that we were going to be late for our show) and even had a box of chocolates and the check waiting for us upon completion of our meal.

Our server brought us some delicious fresh made nan to start us off. As good as any nan i've had in India. 

I ordered the rib eye steak. My friend ordered the fish of the day which was a sole fish with dungeness crab. We ordered a side of the fried rice as well.

3052317,2008-09-10,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"Sensi:  Italian for ""the senses"" (or so I hear).  And boy does Sensi not disappoint.  

Sight:  Impeccable.  The restaurant is laid out in four different kitchens, plus a dessert kitchen and a bread bakery.  The decor is sleek and contemporary, with natural materials:  light colored woods, large pieces of hewn stone, sometimes rough and natural, sometimes polished smooth, with brushed metal accents and flowing water.  There were many different dining rooms as well, with 6 or so tables in each, so it feels intimate no matter where you are.  The staff is well-dressed and groomed, with clean, simple uniforms.  The plates were all unique, and 

Touch:  The seats were comfortable and the table was smooth and nice to touch, while the appetizer plates had an interesting texture.  The cool soft water of the vanishing edge fountains was nice, and was clearly either distilled or at least purified with salt (otherwise I suppose the fountains would get silty).  Along with the glass and the polished stone, very nice texture-wise.  (Though no one goes to restaurants to feel on things.  Oh well.)

Smell:  Tantalizing.  The first brush is the Indian tandoori, with hints of curry.  The smell of the fresh bread was exquisite as well, and being seated next to the bread bakery was a plus in that department.  The light salt scent of fresh seafood was there, as well as garlicy and buttery hints, though I'm not sure from where, exactly.

Sound:  I can't say that it was the most amazing place with sound.  You hear the typical restaurant sounds of plates and the shuffling feet of wait-staff.  There was either no music, or it was too light to be heard, though the sound of running water was nice.  We talked throughout, as well, so I suppose that that wasn't too big a deal.  It was *not* loud and echo-y, though, as you might expect from the stone and glass used.  I'm guessing the wood in the ceiling and floor helped to damp it, but I'm not sure.

Taste:  I'm sorry while I tear up a little.  The food was very good.  Very good indeed.  We started with cocktails (didn't feel like wine that night, and I wasn't sure what I was ordering yet), but it was the perfect mix of citrus and rum, and I really enjoyed it.   We were given slices of at least 3 or 4 kinds of bread, freshly baked and sliced right behind us, with butter and a chive spread.  It was great.  Next, we ordered Tuna 3-ways, and the Thai Lobster and Shrimp rolls, and they were very good.  The fish was fresh, and had a unique flavor that one could dream about.  The rolls were good as well, but I think a little more cilantro could've helped it along to perfection.  We had a bit of everything.  Lamb, Scallops, Steak, and Lobster (the four of us with one each), and usually you don't share at a fine dining restaurant, but the food was too good not to sample some of everyone's plate. The lamb was in a light and flakey pastry with just the right done-ness, the scallops had the most rich and subtle lightly buttered taste, the lobster was served Indian style, and the steak was rich and full, and the largest thing served there.  I had the tapioca pudding for dessert, and it really is THE BEST as they advertise, the creme brulee was to die for, especially the unique pistachio, and I can't recall was it was called, but the chocolate log was great, and I'm not usually much for chocolate.  Nothing I didn't like at all from Sensi.  When we left, we were given a small box of cookies, a nice touch, and each was very good.

Service (the Sixth Sense):  We were seated almost immediately for our reservation.  The hostess was gracious, addressed the party by name, and slowly walked us through the restaurant to our seat.  The table setting had everything, each person having a bread plate, a water glass, a wine glass, two forks, and a knife.   The wine menu is expansive and much larger than the food menu, with all ranges of pricing (none cheap, though).  The hostess let us sit down, and the three adults put their napkins in their laps, and the hostess put the napkin in the child's lap herself.  
The waiter came by, introduced himself, and offered us choice of water, and promptly took the wine glass from the minor's place setting.  Since we'd informed him of a birthday in the party, that person was served first, and then the waiter would move completely across the table to the lady second (it was clear she'd be first if it wasn't for the birthday celebrant).  All the little touches were there, with the glasses removed or refilled as needed, and when two in the party got up to go to the restroom, leaving their napkins on the chairs, the napkins were quickly removed, and new, folded napkins were left near the place setting.  The steak was not finished during the meal, so it was boxed up in a container, and placed in a stylish carrying back with Sensi on the front.  The wait staff took care of every need, but tended to stay out of your way.  Just how I like it.

Sensi deserves every star.  Recommended.",UIdX_cI1awxvPH7kIFKpXw,0,0,5,jgop6nAOeGbhMdAM8i6L1Q

As many here have commented, the nan bread is excellent. I enjoyed watching it being made, and then I really enjoyed eating it with the divine sauces. We wolfed the bread right down and were offered another basket, which we happily accepted.

The homemade ginger ale is refreshing and different. But it is very gingery. We liked it a lot, but I can see where it might not be for everyone.

The b/f started with the Yellowtail Sashimi, which he described as having an unusual combination of flavors. He liked it but didn't love it. I had the Tomato Burrata as my appetizer, which was WONDERFUL. The heirloom tomatoes were bursting with flavor. The tiny green beans were sweet and crispy. It had very little dressing - I think just salt, pepper, and olive oil, but that's all it needed. The spiciness of the arugula and the sweetness of the fresh basil gave this dish more than enough flavor for me. For those of you who don't know (I didn't) burrata is a cheese similar to fresh mozzarella but so much softer and creamier inside. Yum.

For my main course I tried the Vegetable and Egg Pad Thai. Not very original I know. This was a tad disappointing after my incredible appetizer. It seemed a little bland to me. Nothing special. I've had better Pad Thai elsewhere for a lot less $. Mr. Carnivore had the Tandoori Surf and Turf Mix Grill, which he enjoyed.

Dessert was the Sorbet and Gelato served in the bowl made of ice. I really, really loved this dessert! The presentation is fabulous, and each little scoop of sorbet and gelato was amazing. Each flavor (coconut, pineapple, and mango - I think?) complemented the others perfectly. I wanted to abscond with that ice bowl. So pretty and fun. I couldn't stop looking at it and touching it.

Service was top notch. Atmosphere is beautiful and unique.

So... I really enjoyed the overall experience. Some items were downright amazing (Tomato Burrata app and dessert). However a couple of the things we tried (Yellowtail Sashimi app and Pad Thai) were just OK, which makes this a 4 star review. But a very solid 4 stars.

As we approached the bar, there appeared to be only one bar stool available, so we kind of stood there and looked around for possibly another stool.  The bartender approached us and we asked him if he could possibly get another stool so that we could sit down.  He sarcastically looked around and said, ""Looks like there are no other seats available."" and then gave us a silly smile.  He said it loud enough so that the bar (its kind of small) all looked at us.  Not cool Mr. Bartender.  Here is my note to the manager at Sensi:
*  Inform your staff that customer service is key.  I get that there was not another chair, but there is another way to approach this and make potential customers feel good.
* You never know WHO you are potentially servicing.  I work in radio and if I lived in Vegas, I would put your spot on BLAST.
*  We ended up going to Beso at Aria and had a GREAT experience.
*  take a day to TRAIN staff to be attentive and friendly (not sarcastic)",8ZfXuiTBhqKWvnCAldIUMw,0,0,1,3cG4lh5dVvNOkuHHnFuZBQ

We had a plane to catch, time to kill, and happened to be in the Bellagio.  I don't know why.  But on previous stays, the water feature had been enticing, so we pulled up a couple of bar stools and started a tab.

It seems to me that by the end of the evening, we had ordered just about everything on the menu.  I know that we ordered from every section of the menu, and sampled a version of every pretty drink that the other bargoers had in front of them.  (The bar staff was incredibly personable in a dry, bartendery way.  They knew a lot about a good drink, and had a handle on all the food, too.)

The upshot is this.  I'll try just about anything once.  My husband's Asian cuisine preferences extends about as far as General Tso's chicken, and the word ""fusion"" is like kryptonite.  And HE loved every single thing that we ordered.  I'm pretty adventurous in ordering but picky when eating, and I loved every single thing that we ate.

3497609,2015-01-28,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"Simply put, this is an exceptional restaurant. I was fortunate to dine here twice during a trade show in Las Vegas. The first night was with a large group of people and the menu was Prix Fixe. Most the time you'll think that they're doing this just to get people fed and out-a-here. Not the case at all. Each course was a delight culminating with my main course - the salmon.

The next night was with 1/3 the amount of people and the menu was standard fare. Wider choice. In each case, you'll start with a fantastic mix of naan with tasty sauces. Then the crispy shrimp - awesome! The handmade meatballs are fantastic (and I wasn't a big meatball fan but at this place I am). The crab-lobster maki rolls? Delicious.

The first night I had the pacific salmon with miso glaze, mizuna, soy butter, shiitake mushroom. Simple and delightful. The second night, Jesse the waiter recommended the ribeye. Never had one so good and I've eaten at steak places in both Chicago and New York.

Lastly, the service. Top notch, world class. I was taken care of by Jesse the waiter both nights. He and his support staff handled their duties with perfection rounding out the entire positive experience.

Oh and the ambiance and atmosphere? Hip but not over the top. The kitchen is behind glass and you can watch what's going on but really it sets an atmosphere of energy and movement. The only, if ever so slightly small nitpick is that it's loud. But really, it's the energy that makes it loud as people are simply enjoying themselves.

Next, we had the yellowtail sashimi.  Based on Misti's review, I had to try this and it did not disappoint one bit.  So fresh and so clean...best yellowtail I've tasted to date.  Dip this fresh piece of fish into the light citrus-ey ponzu sauce and wow...

The duck potstickers with foie gras debut next.  The foie gras just melts in our mouth.  So much flavor, so savory, so good.

3552323,2008-08-20,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"My first 5 star review!

Sensi was a fantastic place for a late dinner. My husband and I arrived around 9 ish on a Saturday night, and we were seated quickly even  though we didn't have reservations. 

The atmosphere is stylish and relaxing (appropriate for Bellagio's Spa Tower) and the restaurant itself is beautiful. When we walked in, we passed a tank of tasty-looking lobsters, and once seated we had a view of the kitchen. Even the place settings add to the sleek, spa like decor. The colors of the dining room: muted and sophisticated.

The best part about this was that despite the sophisticated atmosphere, the service was friendly, efficient, and not the least bit snooty. The folks there were among the best wait staff I've encountered in Vegas. 

We started with house cocktails. I can't remember the name of the drink I ordered, but it was strong with a full ginger flavor, and very good ($14, the cost of all the Bellagio specialty cocktails I encountered at the pool, Fontana, the Petrossian Bar, etc.). The server then brought a fantastic little bread plate with several varieties of homemade bread and accompanying chutneys. 

We then ordered the tempura fried asparagus (which I chose after reading the reviews on Yelp) and it lived up the hype. Fantastic! I wish I had some right now. We ordered appetizers and sides for our main course: A fantastic fried lobster dish with mango and micro greens; Duck pot stickers with foie gras on the side; and the Sensi fried rice. All of this was out of this world, truly delicious. If I went back, I'd get the lobster again, but I might get something else in place of the pot stickers ... just to keep it interesting.

After all of this, the  waiter brought us a little complimentary box of cookies. They were tiny, tasty, and in the cutest to go box ever. 

I loved every minute of eating here. Plus, it was at the very start of my vacation when I was still full of optimism and my gambling budget. There may be some risk at the blackjack tables, but not in dining at Sensi! Worth every star.",MubgCQYH8-5fb_z1FuVdDg,2,1,5,sxerCz6SEv-R7N8X2DluuA

I was planning my wedding in las Vegas for this June and Sensi was our first choice for the post-ceremonial feast. We heard SO MANY lovely things about their accommodating staff and fabulous vegetarian options that we could hardly wait. 

I contacted them in February to begin the menu selection process and they got back to me with a decent pace (not as fast as others but I still had 4 months so I wasn't in a hurry). 

So, time passes, I've been in contact with the folks at Sensi for almost 2 months now, and I finally get all the information I need from my family (RSVPs and whatnot for close to 30 people) to make my reservation. I make the call and leave a message. I get an e-mail in response stating that our schedules jut don't jive (I'm about to drop a few thousand dollars on your place and you can't make time to call me?) AND that the restaurant closes EVERY JUNE for 10 days of ""repairs and renovations"". 

In the 2 months that we were talking no one thought to mention that?! Okay, fine, the email said they didn't have the dates yet so I can maybe see how they wouldn't want to frighten me off unnecessarily, but I'd still would  have liked some warning. 

The final straw was when the events coordinator never got back to me to tell me the exact dates they'd be closed this June (the 6th through 16th if you're curious) like she said she would. I had to call the restaurant and speak with a hostess, who had more information than the manager apparently, to find out for myself.

Anyway, I had dinner here a while ago and it was incredible. The food is considered Asian fusion, but they've got a variety of cuisines that are all done very well. What I had (a seafood risotto) is no longer on the menu, but it did leave an impression on me, so that should say something. The sommeliers are incredibly helpful and lack all the pretentiousness that comes with being a wine snob (which, technically, they are).

The service is great (water glasses constantly being attended to, napkins being folded upon your return from the restroom) and the prices match the level of service and quality of food.

The setting is something else. You're surrounded by carved stone and water trickling and have a view of the kitchen. It's best seen in-person as my words lack the beauty of the place.

The night started out all wrong...   We were staying on East Harmond near the newly remodeled Planet Hollywood.   The plan was to drive to the Mirage, grab a parking spot and go see a show there, and then drive to the Bellagio for dinner.  We had reservations at 9:30 PM.   No problemo, right?

Well, driving in Las Vegas is hella stressful, and even more stressful for my stepfather, who drives rather seldom....   Basically this whole drive (or ride, in my case)  was somewhat akin to playing Russian roulette with a dirty ol' Russian gun that misfires one out of every three shots.   Best bet, you may not permanently blow your head off but you'll blow a hole through your head large enough that you'lll retain more than a slight speech impediment....   Yeah, just lovely....

Anyway, so we eventually made it to Sensi at 9:40, some 10 minutes after our reservations.   They couldn't seat us then & there, but they said it'd be about 20-30 minutes..... Fine, I thought, I'll order a stiff martini to calm the nerves after this brutal drive we just had... and we'll eventually be seated.  The bartender was slow and full of attitude, preferring to stare at the cute playboy bunnies who were looking at him lovingly instead of making my fucking martini.   Can't say I blame him, other than the fact that I wanted some liquid medicine... AND FAST!!!

We were eventually seated some 30 minutes later... We ordered 3 oyster shooters for appetizer and, as main course:  1 Roasted Salmon, 1 New York Steak, 1 Day Boat Scallop, and 1 Lamb Chop...   We ordered 2 side dishes alongside that:  mashed potatoes and deep fried asparagus.

As far as drinking was concerned, I wanted to order a nice bottle without freaking everybody out, so I ordered wine # 14437, which, as it turns out, was the Brunello Altesino and it was ripe to perfection... An absolutely perfect wine pairing.

Food was way good, portions were generous, and the wine definitely complemented the food very well.   I ate the lamb chop and really enjoyed it.  The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone.   I tasted my wife's scallops and man-oh-man were they awesome too!  Served with a puree of English peas, it was a delightful dish.   My stepfather seemed to enjoy his steak, and my mother definitely enjoyed her salmon.

Service was wonderful... Shortly after we started our dinner, the sommelier came to let us know we had ordered the last bottle of 14437 but made several other recommendations.   Frankly, we had no intent to dig into another bottle, seeing as the first one was already $121, but still, it was very professional of him to come and let us know.  Our waitress was fabulous...

Decor, very modern and trendy and, thankfully, not too loud.  All in all a wonderful dining experience and Sensi goes into my top 20 in America fo' sho'",jX52sZoojxyYV2viWNyO7A,2,2,5,TPOWp4w4JQJchAZDI9ZbTg

Sensi is a little hard to spot inside Bellagio.  You don't really notice any signage for it on the casino floor and I even asked one waitress where it was and she had no idea!  Just keep walking past the Conservatory of Flowers and Jean Phillippe Patisserie and you'll find it!

The layout of the restaurant is pretty cool in that all of the kitchen stations are visible in the middle of the dining room showing all diners all the action behind the kitchen.

I've done some research before my trip and already knew what I was getting, which were the Roll Call, which is a sampler of all their Sensi Rolls, and their Famous Wok Lobster

Roll Call - Sensi Roll Sampler -- http://bit.ly/ZgsTuz
Tataki Roll - seared spicy tuna roll, tuna tartare, miso ponzu

TLC Roll - tempura lobster & crab, whipped avocado, chili aioli

Ida Roll - smoked idaho trout, horseradish white soy

Green Roll - jumbo asparagus, roasted shiitakes.
I totally enjoyed each roll but I'd have to say my fave was definitely the Tataki Roll.  It was so creamy and delicate and had a nice solid flavor with the tuna and ponzu.  This made for a great appetizer and is a great offering if you can't decide which Sensi Roll to get.  Each piece is a pretty substantial size.

Famous Wok Lobster --  http://bit.ly/11dulIc
Chili & licorice glaze, baby bok choy, fried shallots.
OMG!!  It was exactly like the how the pictures were with the interesting plating of the lobster.  This was amazing and the lobster was cooked perfectly.

Signature Tapioca Pudding with Mango Lassi and Coconut Sorbet -- http://bit.ly/11duonk
This was a pretty heavy dessert with a lot going on.  And everything was delicious!  Probably the best part though was the Coconut Sorbet.  It was so good!  This was a good dessert to finish off my meal since it had right amount of sweetness to counter the savory lobster taste.

After an awesome experience like this, I'm definitely going to consider coming back here again.  It certainly lives up to the high standards of Bellagio's restaurant collection.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,10,8,5,ySIX4oE10Jow2selkkzG3w

- He screwed up our order and forgot my side order of Bacon Fried Rice.  I was looking forward to trying it because it sounded sooo good.  But when it didn't come out with the entrees, I didn't want to have to eat it by itself.

3906834,2011-02-27,3,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"Scene: 02/18/11; at the Bellagio's Sensi Restaurant; Cascading waterfalls and exposed exotic stone walls with bamboo accents -- all grey and soothing and tranquil. Me and Mara G. walk in. Chef Martin Hierling, Executive Chef, just happens to be standing at the hostess stand with the hostesses. Mara G. remembered him from the Grand Opening -- SIX YEARS AGO. They strike up a brief conversation involving a lot of thoughtful agreement, whispering, nodding, and gesturing with foreheads towards me. We are seated with a full-view of half the open kitchen. Dining ensues.

Flavio, our primary server, is super nice. Super nice. We order. Me: Pacific Pear cocktail. TLC roll. Scallops. The cocktail was at once gingery, sweet with Poire William, and a tad bit tart from the sour (house made, I'm sure) and necessary to temper the Vodka. Super yum delicious. I could have easily downed 3 or 4 of those babies. Remember, my blood alcohol is dangerously low. But I didn't. I had food to eat.

We finally figured out what the guy inside the glass enclosed kitchen center was doing. He was lifting naan out of the oven. A basket of it was delivered to our table. Lighter, fluffier naan, crispier flat breads, chunky chutney, cool creamy raita, and tangier tamarind sauce have never been produced on the planet. Why oh why, bread basket, do you exist? Don't you see my waistband straining as it is? You do realize I must eat you, don't you? 

My TLC roll came out. If I say ""omg"" again, it will definitely lose its punch. But this tempura fried roll topped with lobster and crab (get it -- TLC) is definitely worth wearing out an overworked catch phrase of the 2K11. Oh My God! This creation was so good. The splashes of sriracha mayo and creamy wasabi were the perfect accents. I hate to say it, but I love saying it: I cleaned my plate! I probably shouldn't have, with multiple courses coming, but I couldn't help it. So good!

For the next course, I was expecting my scallops. All of a sudden, here comes Flavio with soup spoons. A treat from the chef! Wow! Thai coconut shrimp soup! In a hollowed out coconut bowl displayed on inedible salt on some kind of seashell. Wow! Can I just say this soup is more delicious by leaps and bounds than any Thai coconut soup I have heretofore experienced? Sweet, yet hot from the chili oil. Chock full of shrimp and enoki mushrooms. A little cilantro to top things off. This soup was the dancing water fountain light show in my mouth. (It is quite a stretch, but I am going to have to list this soup in my ""Crab Soup"" list for now until I rename it to seafood soups.) Thank you Chef!

Then the scallops... These diver scallops could have doubled as hubcaps on my great grandfather's 57 Chevy. So huge! Yet so tender and flavorful; and no muscle. Gently seared scallops with sweet soy, sugar snaps, spinach, shallots, and enoki mushrooms, daikon radish, and perfectly steamed white rice (just for yucks)! :)

By now, I am stuffed to the gills. Mara G.'d ordered the tasting menu and had a dessert coming. But I was actually hoping to have time to sit back and savor the last few sips of my OR Riesling. Not.

Here comes Flavio again with an ice sculpture shaped like a balloon with three ice cream scoops inside. A lit candle is in one of the scoops -- INSIDE the ice sculpture. Wow! What a feat of engineering. I blew it out and dove into salted caramel, espresso, and Madagascar vanilla ice cream scoops! (Misty, I was thanking MY lucky stars that all of the servers in house didn't come by beating a huge marching band bass drum and blowing ""new year's eve"" horns singing happy birthday like they did at Farrell's Ice Cream when I was 9 or 10.)

This ice cream was creating a similar experience for my taste buds, though. I have been in love with salted caramel since my visit to Sorella in NYC (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sorella-new-york#hrid:ovqOWowSYIQh4dxm_btJeQ) and I haven't been able to make it to Georgetown Cupcake in DC on Saturdays to get one of their salted caramel happy pills. But this scoop of salted caramel ice cream (along with the other flavors) hit the SPOT! Smooth, sweet, creamy, visually appealing, sexy even. Thank you Chef Martin! Thank you. Wow!

By 2/21, when the fullness subsided a bit, I was thinking of the pacific pear and the scallops. I will definitely return. Again and again. I loved this birthday dining taste sensation experience. Wow!",TOj5yZZEwS3J3fLgo3V3yQ,4,4,5,7CyKYfJ_3c7uz94Bc0JX7g

First impressions are everything and so when the boyfriend and I walked in ready to have a nice belated birthday dinner...we were NOT impressed.

I had a reservation at 7 and so when we approached the hostess we told her we had a reservation she just kind of just told us ""okay, it will be a few minutes"" which was fine, however her tone was as if we were bothering her.  I'm normally NOT picky or particularly bitchy when it comes to service however at a 5 star restaurant at a 5 star hotel I expected much more.

We were finally seated (after seating 5 other parties before us) in the very very very back.  Not a problem however there were a ton of empty tables. My boyfriend even made a comment about how shitty the service was for how empty the restaurant was.

The cocktail menu came on an iPad which I thought was cool and cheesy at the same time.  I had the black crush.  For food we ordered:

Yellowtail sashimi appetizer - SO GOOD with the citrus
Miso glazed Salmon - SO TENDER and SO YUM.
Niman ranch Porkchop - also really good and perfectly cooked

Dessert was pistachio panna cotta...which was definitely different.  It wasn't particularly bad but also wasn't that memorable.  The presentation surpassed the flavor.

Sidenote: the tomato chutney with the naan is TO DIE FOR. I could have eaten it all night long!

Professional, speedy.  Big problem though was the photographer that walked through and strongly encouraged us to pose for photos, then tried to sell them to us for $70.  Huge mistake-- felt very Disney.  Just let me enjoy my dinner.

- Bread (3/5)
Naan, though not particularly good naan.  The spicy tomato sauce that comes with it is quite nice.  

- Tongue & Cheek (5/5), $14
Wagyu tongue and wagyu cheeks... extremely tender and great flavor.  The little quenelles of mashed potato help cut through some of the richness in the beef.

- Pork Chop (4/5), $36
Juicy, succulent pork chops!  It's hard to keep them so juicy so I was quite impressed.  But the other components on the dish were extremely ordinary.  

- Value (3/5) 
A bit on the expensive side, but good food overall.",AsUDg2wZZqkgZzl0kuFvIA,1,0,4,8PDVlgAby-LCR5uFRHA_mA

First, the restaurant itself is beautiful!  The glass looking into the kitchen is very cool, and I like that you can see everything being made.  Our waiter encouraged us to get up and walk around, although I felt a little weird being so voyeuristic.  But let me get back to our waiter, Lawrence, who knew the menu inside and out and really made our dining experience fabulous!  I told him what type of cocktail I was looking for (tequila) and he suggested a drink with tequila, cherry brandy, muddled cherries, lime, etc.  I can't remember the name but it was very good.  My boyfriend had bourbon and they were generous with the pour.

When the naan bread came out, I figured out what everyone had been talking about.  And the tomato chutney... to die for!  I pretty much knew I wanted to try the TLC Roll, because every other Yelper has made it clear it's phenomenal.  Totally right on that front- amazing!  I also had the ricotta ravioli.  The plates were small but great for sharing.  My boyfriend had the filet, and it was cooked perfectly medium-rare.  He also orderd the loaded mashed potatoes, which were really decadent.  We opted out on dessert but were brought a trio of ice cream/sorbet anyway since I mentioned we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  Really thoughtful.  I may still be dreaming about the pistachio ice cream, and I don't even like pistachios.  It was seriously that good!

The setting is quite neat with a combination of unique open kitchen styled environment and a softer water/fountain backdrop. Service is solid with good knowledge of the cuisine. That being said, many of the appetizers were not prepared to standard and even the waiter had to comment that some of our dishes were of poor quality and needed further time to prepare. At that point, he did offer an additional appetizer to pass the time, but should have compensated us on the misstep (remember this is considered a ""higher end"" establishment). Overall, the appetizers lacked creativity and in many cases were just poor (e.g. a version of Chinese buns). That being said, the Naan bread was good and the sauces had some nice flavor.

The main courses were generally Meh. The salmon, crispy skin style preparation, lacked flavor and a unique presentation. I really thought it was a poor dish. The wines were excellent, but I found the Sommelier just OK. He really didn't have a good understanding of the wines but their wine list was varied and had both value and premium selections.

I did appreciate the fact they host children under the age of six. This is a rarity in Las Vegas and should be noted.

4570967,2012-08-12,6,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"We had an amazing one year anniversary dinner here!  I made reservations a few months in advance, since the Virtuoso Conference was taking place at Bellagio this week, and the restaurant closes for renovations next week.  Sporting my new necklace, aptly named the Showstopper, Eric R. escorted me to the beautiful Sensi restaurant.  We had Chef Ellamar's food before at a Project Dinner Table a few years ago, but had never been in the restaurant.  I also knew before ever entering that this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in terms of design.  We were seated in a beautiful room at a table facing the glass kitchen - what a great view!

Immediately, Sanae, the Head Sommelier, brought us Gruet champagne as a celebratory gesture for our anniversary.  We almost had visited Gruet winery in Albuquerque on Monday, but ran out of time!  I decided to go with the tasting menu, and Eric R. decided to go a la carte.  He ordered the Roll Call appetizer, with a sample of each sushi roll (trout, salmon, tuna, and lobster), and the halibut with corn risotto and charred tomato vinaigrette.  My selections on the tasting menu included the kusshi oyster with ponzu and sriracha, roasted octopus, the Thai diver scallop with jasmine rice and bok choy, kalbi marinated kobe flat iron steak with bone marrow and kimchi with mashed potato, and strawberry shortcake with basil.

Our server (I believe his name is Lawrence) was great.  He promised to alternate my courses with Eric's so we could have food at all times and sample each other's.  First, we received the famous bread basket with naan, papadums, cucumber raita, and tomato chutney.  As I anticipated from Misti Y.'s and Bobby Y.'s reviews, we were addicted to the tomato chutney...and refilled the chutney and the basket!  Then, the chef generously sent out oysters for each of us though only I was supposed to get one.  The kusshi are small and flavorful and the sauce was perfect!  Who doesn't love ponzu?  So fresh!  Sanae helped us choose a wine for the meal.  We split a glass of white from Santorini Greece that she recommended, and it was flavorful and easy to drink.

Then Eric received his roll call.  He let me try a bite of one with ikura but I wanted him to enjoy his appetizer, which he definitely did.  He loved the tuna roll.  Next, I received my roasted octopus, adorned with fried capers, roasted red pepper, roasted potatoes, and strands of radicchio.  I love grilled octopus and roasted did not disappoint.  The restaurant generously provided potstickers also, which Eric enjoyed.  Then I received my scallop, which had a chile paste flavor (which I love), delicious charred haricort vert, and bok choy with radish sprouts.  The scallop was HUGE and perfectly cooked.  Then, Eric received his halbut (perfectly cooked also) and it was delicious and moist.

Next I got my steak which was presented beautifully and secretly pre-sliced which made my life easier!  It was very tasty.  We were so full so we got what was left to go, knowing dessert was next.  Besides my shortcake, the restaurant gave us three other treats: donuts, raspberry-rhubarb mousse, and a chocolate caramel dessert.  Wow!  We were so full.  Then our server gave us chocolates and told us the meal was taken care of already by someone else!  It turns out my parents arranged with Sensi to surprise us!  It was such a shock - we were so surprised.  What a delicious and special experience to cap off a year of wedded bliss!

It was our second night in Vegas and my wife and I really didn't want to do a buffet.  After much deliberation about where to go for dinner, we decided to try Sensi.  We remember it as the restaurant with the waterfall with a quirky Prix Fixe Menu.  

We didn't have reservations, but it was a few days before the CES chaos so we were seated withing 10 minutes.  My wife read about the wonderful Ginger Ale, so we decided to give that a try.  Let's just say, we both didn't like it too much.  It was a bit too spicy for a drink, so we both stuck mostly with water.

We ordered from the Prix Fixe menu.  I had the Surf and Turf Beef Carpaccio, the Kobe Flat Iron Steak, and Sorbet.  While waiting for the food, we were served some Naan with sauce.  Usually, we would skip the Naan, but these had a nice crispy texture that we couldn't resist.  

The Surf and Turf Carpaccio was delicious.  It consisted for tasty but not chewy Lobster with a delicious Mustard Dressing.  The Flat Iron Steak was ok.  The Steak and the Bok Choy looked a little lonely on the big plate they serve it in.  I've had better elsewhere, but it was good nonetheless.  The dessert was awesome.

""My Evening at Sensi""

    --- or ---

""Attack of the Insane Drunk Ladies""

Now that I have that squared away, onto the review!  

I had reservations for 1 on Saturday night at Sensi at the Bellagio.  Since I was flying solo, I decided to sit at the bar, which was stylish and contemporary, with lots of granite and dark woods and a waterfall.  Unfortunately, in contrast to the other high-end restaurants in the Bellagio, Sensi doesn't have any walls or doors or other barriers separating the interior of the restaurant from the foot traffic and general pandemonium happening in the common areas -- so my hopes for a serene dinner were dashed before I even started eating.

After ordering a Sauvignon blanc (excellent!) and noshing on the complementary breadbasket of naan and curry-flavored chips, I decided dinner would be the ""Taste of Sensi"" tasting menu.  Here's the rundown:

AMUSE BOUCHE
Salmon cracker with nori crisps, kaffir smoked salmon, and wasabi avocado.  Lovely presentation, but far too salty/briny for my taste.  Not enjoyable.

COURSE #1
Roasted octopus with chorizo, fingerling potatoes, arugula salad, egg yolk, and squid ink aioli.  Similar to the amuse bouche, this dish was beautiful to look at, but all I could taste was salt.  I picked it at, but didn't finish it.

COURSE #2
Alaskan halibut with fennel, sweet corn, broken rice, asparagus, and peas.  Hands down my favorite dish of the night.  The halibut was cooked to perfection, and I loved the texture of the intermingled broken rice, corn, and peas.

COURSE #3
""Tongue & Cheek"" -- braised veal cheeks, smoked Wagyu beef tongue, potato puree, and red wine reduction.  Great flavors and beautifully cooked meats, but I was a bit blind-sided by the enormous portion of very rich ingredients, which seemed out of place in a tasting menu sequence.  I guess I can't complain about too much of a good thing, right?

DESSERT
Greek yogurt panna cotta with honey gelee and blackberry coulis.  SIlky smooth but overwhelmingly sweet.  A few bites and the sugar rush became too much to handle.

While the food was a mixed bag, the real ""highlight"" of the evening (if you can call it that) was being accosted by a pair of insane drunk ladies** (IDLs) who stumbled in from the casino, sat down next to me, GRABBED MY UTENSILS OUT OF MY HANDS, and helped themselves to my food.  Jeeeeeezus H. Christ!

I begged and pleaded with the bartender to do something about the IDLs, but he shrugged and did a whole lot of nothing.  Eventually the IDLs got bored of me and moved on to greener pastures...but my appetite was mostly ruined at that point.  I was hoping the bartender could comp at least part of my meal that had been rendered inedible by the IDLs' creeper-germs, but he refused.  Instead, he poured me a free glass of Sauvignon blanc in a to-go cup, which was a nice gesture, but nowhere near enough to make up for a spoiled dinner.  Needless to say, I quickly paid my check and got the hell out of there.

And thus ends my tale of Sensi -- possibly the strangest and randomest experience I've ever had as a solo diner in Vegas (or anywhere else).

**Footnote: I didn't call them ladies at the time.  I used a much less family-friendly term... You can probably guess what it was.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,7,7,3,XRW7-n0WxM8P7sbC000J8A

This place is a fusion of Asian, Italian, American & seafood, so everyone should be able to find something they like. 

To avoid an embarrassing grabby ""fight for the check"" scene, I asked the hostess to make sure that the check came to either myself or my bf. She took down our names and outfits and promised us the check would be delivered to us. 

Our waiter Flavio took great care of us. I think he has actual magical powers. He never hovered over our table, but he always seemed to appear within seconds when we even thought about wanting something. 

The food was equally impressive. I would definitely recommend the tandoori chicken dish. The presentation was great... I wish I took a picture, but it was too delicious to pause for something trivial like that :P 

Flavio found out that it was my bf's birthday weekend, and he brought out ice cream encased in some ice sculpture bubble. We spent a good 5 minutes ooohh-ing and ahhh-ing. 

When it came time to cash out, and our friends try to slyly hand Flavio their credit card at the waiter's station, he very discreetly said that the check was already taken care of.

When Adam and I spend $100 for dinner, it is an event and a treat. I was sorry, and in fact angry, to see that money go to Sensi.

I had the Tandoori Surf & Turf Mixed Grill and didn't come close to finishing it -- not because I wasn't hungry, but because both the chicken and the prime rib were dry. Our server never asked how I wanted the prime rib done; they must have just assumed that I wanted all the juices sucked out. Sorry, guys. That wasn't the case.

Adam had the short ribs and they were good. I particularly liked the horseradish mashed potatoes. And the bread service that everyone's raving about -- well, there's a reason. It was good.

8pm came and we closed out the bar. We were then told it would be 10 or 15 minutes they were waiting on a table. 25 turned to 30, then 45, then over an hour past our reservation. Every time we went to the desk she advised the manager would take care of us. I felt the hostess should have been more proactive in letting us know what was going on and not for us to come back repeatedly asking. 

When the manager finally came around to us he advised because of the builders/Kbis conventions in town a group had pretty much decided to use their restaurant as a meeting place and had long since finished and were just sitting there and not leaving. 

He did wipe out out bar tab and when we were seated three appetizers were quickly brought out to us. He also personally kept checking in on us. 

Now the good. The service once seated was stellar. The food even more so. I had the roasted chicken and I have to say it was one of the best cooked chicken I ever had. It was such a brilliant white color and moist through out. The steak ordered at our table was equally well prepared. We all said after the apps we really were not hungry and after drinking at the bar and then the apps. We all ended up eating our whole plates it was that good. 

Then the manager sent out desert which was also brilliant.

Although the menu is categorized by cuisine, it is possible, and even fun to order different styles.  Flavors are unique but the menu is so well conceived that they do not clash.  The food is whimsically presented and is contemporary (you will see foam on at least one dish).

The ""TLC Roll"" with tempura lobster, crab, a whipped avocado and siracha aioli is incredible.  The sweetness of the lobster and crab accentuated by the heat of the siracha and balanced with the richness of the avocado.  The salt and pepper calamari, a Chinese play on the usual preparation, is served with a spicy curried tomato chutney and is just good eats.  Finally, don't pass on the duck pot stickers.  Little packets of delicious goodness.

For mains, the miso glazed halibut roasted and served in an incredibly fragrant ginger broth.  Outstanding.  A take on a Japanese classic.  Delicious.  The braised short rib is well prepared (not over braised so the fat is totally gone) but its flavor is common.

I really wish Sensi would make entr√©es from their add on's (Spot Prawns, Sonoma foie, and roasted bone marrow).  I asked on several occasions but...

There are few restaurants with the total creative concept that flows from the design and layout through the complete dining experience, matching the modern approach to culinary art and classic delicious dishes.

We had dinner at Sensi last night, after walking out of Prime Steakhouse 

We have been coming to Sensi for several years. Always have had a great meal here.

The restaurant is hidden in the back part of Bellagio behind and to the left of the world famous Bellagio Arboretum. 

Built around solid granite blocks and open glass, Sensi has an open kitchen central to the dining room where fusion cuisine is prepared to order in view of the guests.

Items range from steak, to chops, seafood, specialty salads and starters, as wall as several oriental inspired dishes. The restaurant provides delicious Naan Bread and an amazing tomato chutney and yogurt for dipping and enjoyment before your meal.

The bar list is amazing with several delicious concoctions, especially good is the Mojito that's made with legit ingredients.

The wine list is unbelievably solid. First Growth Bordeaux, Burgandy, Italian, Spanish, and New World that would rival some of the best steak houses in the nation.

That said, the service really makes the experience. Our server Michael from Long Island has been with the restaurant since the Bellagio opened. A statement of longevity that speaks to not only the economic viability of the restaurant but also the quality of the experience from the standpoint of the staff.

When you have a place that exemplify class, you tend to keep great people who genuinely do what they do because they believe in it.

Sensi has a legit sommelier and wine stewards. 

The place is amazing, I can't say enough good things about it. Price is reasonable, it's upscale but modern with a ton of class.

Top to bottom, if dining is about a total experience for you and not just following the crowds to overhyped food conveyance, you need to add this to your list.

I realize that Martin Heierling is the executive chef, but to recreate this experience, you definitely need to make sure Chef de Cuisine Roy is in the kitchen. After eating his creations, I think he may be the most underrated guy on the Strip. 

When I walked in, I was immediately impressed (and frightened) by the size of the exhibition kitchen. I thought it must be impossible for anyone to manage all of these kitchens effectively, and then I became worried that perhaps the ambitious kitchen would undermine the quality of the food. As you may have guessed, my worries were unfounded.

Little things make me happy, so I could have eaten the naan/papadum breadbasket and homemade chutneys all night long. This alone is worth five stars... my favorite breadbasket, no contest. We consumed so much chutney that we had to get refills, and by the end of the evening, the husband was using the tomato chutney with everything brought to the table, including his steak. I personally wanted a jar of the raita to take home in my purse, but my purse was too small. The flavor was like India in a cup, and India tastes delicious. The papdum were perfect. 

First course: Oysters. One cold, one hot. Time for a confession. This was the first oyster I have ever eaten! I have a low tolerance for seafood, meaning if something is not uber fresh, it makes me ill. I have always been afraid to try an oyster because of this, but the cold oyster with a citrus sauce was brilliant. Somehow I know this isn't your average oyster.

Second course: yellowtail sashimi. When yellowtail is fresh, it may be one of my favorite things in the world, but it is rare to find it as fresh as I like. Needless to say, it tasted like they had just caught the fish. I could have been on the boat eating it. It was that fresh. Not the slightest fishy taste to be detected. 

Third course: Duck dumpling with foie gras. The only travesty here is that there was just one. Even so, it packed a big, scrumptious punch. 

Fourth course: Mini Thai coconut soup with shrimp and boba. Yes, I said boba. The flavor was what every coconut soup wished it could be, but when you add boba? That's just not fair. 

For my main entree, I went with the Thai scallops and the husband ordered the 14oz Piedmontese ribeye. At this point, I was pretty stuffed, but the scallops were buttery and curried, a magic combination. I had a bite of the husband's steak, and it tasted like the stored memory of steak, the ultimate steak, the perfect form of steak to be down right Pluto-esque about it. 

I wasn't sure if I could make it through dessert, but it was hard to resist a tribute to a McDonald's Apple Pie. My husband busted out into laughter. It was that good.

When we left, I said, ""Wow, that was better than Alex,"" and I meant it. I feel as if we experienced the ultimate Sensi experience. It may be hard to recreate, but I think it is worth a try.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,15,5,lKrDtJi3MBmciQ4wEde0Dg

First off, this place is absolutely gorgeous! The decor was very earthy, water here, stones there, and wooden menus. I felt so relaxed, kind of reminded me of a really nice spa. So 5 star for the decor and ambience.

FOOD: You get naan and this flat crispy bread (forgot what it was called) with side sauces of cucumers and/or chutney... the sauce was so flavorful. I liked both sauces, especially the chutney. Embarrassingly, my friend and I liked it so much that we had them pack the sauce and bread for us... no shame, haha.  I ordered TLC Roll and the Scuna Bay Salmon. The TLC roll was very good. It was crispy on the outside and there was avocado puree and chili aioli on the side. The avocado puree was amazing, I was drenching my roll with the puree. So delicious! Also, the scuna bay salmon was cooked to perfection. It was lightly crispy on the outside, but extremely soft, smooth, and moist on the inside. The texture was perfect. After dinner, we did not order any desserts, however; our server (who is amazing) gave my friend and I 2 pieces of truffles each. I didn't really see anyone else get the chocolate? Maybe we were girls or maybe the server pulled some strings for us? Not sure... but the truffles were amazing, so smooth and it just melts in your mouth. 

SERVICE: Very attentive and very sweet servers! I loved their company.",x3ZmjvgHB2-HI6VGTU7z6Q,1,0,5,kIMuZ9HLHo9KlM9Cn6D1Yw

To be fair, Sensi really didn't have much of a chance....not that it tried too hard either.  A meticulous planner, my dinner reservations going into Vegas were mapped out months in advance and my breakfast details planned out extensively.  While my lunches were unscheduled, I generally knew where I wanted to go and generally went there.  When my best friend decided at the last minute that Enoteca San Marco wasn't something he was interested in and suggested ""something asian maybe"" I remembered hearing good things about Sensi and turned to it as an alternative since my buddy had been so agreeable to places like MiX and Alex which weren't really his ""scene.""  Tucked in the back of Bellagio and pretty tough to find, unfortunately Sensi wasn't tough enough to find.

Seated immediately near the admittedly awesome bread prep station, our 'waiter' Jeremy W briefly asked ""sparkling or flat"" and my friend stated flat.  We were brought an already opened bottle of Fiji and two glasses of ice.  When I suggested tap water would be fine, the 'waiter' stated ""Well, the bottle is already opened.""  The bottle cost $8 and was not comped despite our not wanting it.  Approximately ten minutes later menus were brought and essentially dropped off without explanation.  The waiter then returned approximately 10 minutes later with some Naan to go with our empty condiments (every other table was served fresh soy, salt, mustard, and tomato pepper chutney with their Naan...I had to stand up and get my own.  Orders were taken and this was the last we'd see of Jeremy until he delivered the bill.

Browsing the restaurant I must admit the d√©cor was beautiful and watching the chef prepare the Naan was interesting.  After one basket of the delightful and doughy yet crisp bread topped with spicy chutney a non-descript server arrived and removed our basket, later returning with fresh bread.  This was the best service we received at Sensi.  

After around 20 minutes our mains arrived, myself ordering Oven Roasted Diver Scallops with Basil Risotto, Zucchini, and Eggplant and my friend opting for the Shrimp and Beef with Duck Fried Rice.  All things being equal, the food was decent but certainly no better than I've had at far cheaper restaurants with vastly better service.  My scallops were a tad overdone but certainly fresh and tasty while the Risotto was soft yet consistent and contrasted well with the vegetables.  My friend additionally noted his dish was ""pretty good.""  Portion sizes were adequate but certainly not excessive considering the $20+ pricetags.

Another 15-20 minutes passed after the meal and thankfully I was seated close to the server's station where I was capable of filling my own glass with tap water because during that time no on arrived at our table.  Eventually Jeremy reappeared and without asking about dessert or anything else he delivered the check and collected our dishes.  ""Have a great day"" he said.  To be fair, it wouldn't have taken much to be a great day after such a disappointing meal with such lousy service.  The total bill was $56.03 and our most affordable meal of the trip.  No tip was left as no tip was deserved...I've had better service at Denny's.  

The only plus of the meal was that on the way back to the sportsbook and gaming floor we had to pass by the beautiful Bellagio gardens and Jean-Philippe where I ordered the best Tiramisu I've ever had.  Moral of the story?  If you're on your way to Sensi just stop, grab some tiramisu and gelato and watch the chocolate fountain.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,1,2,WvITxTTJ-eZHknQ0ZsvKIg

They brought out some naan and they had four different dipping sauces. There was once specific nutty spicy sauce that was so good with the naan. We ordered the risotto for an app and for $20 bucks it wasn't worth it. It was good, but not worth $20 especially for the portion size (even though we didn't finish it). My fiance ordered the Halibut which was really great and I ordered the sea bass, which was just as good. 

Service was great. The weird thing was that two tables were seated around us and both of them up and left. They were replaced with other people, but maybe the price scared them off and how little choices there are on the menu? Who knows ....

We shared an appetizer of gnocchi ($18). It was okay, I would not order again. The gnocchi was mushy, I felt as though the dish was very bland.

I had the butternut squash ravioli ($29). Delicious! Quite a small serving for the price (5 ravioli). The butternut squash sauce was fantastic.

After playing casino at Bellagio, we were craving for some good sushi and found this place. 

Located inside of the Bellagio hotel.
Well designed, stylish decor and ambience.

Long story short, we thought this was a Japanese restaurant because of the name ""Sensi"" which means warrior in Japanese. We were fooled by name.
This actually was a ""Asian Fusion"" restaurant that serves Asian, American and Italian dishes, not authentic but more like creative cuisines. 

We found that out after seated and ordered our drinks so we had to order some food. They did have some sushi rolls but we don't usually order sushi at the restaurant that doesn't specialize in it, so picked a few appetizers though we really didn't see anything attractive.(since we were craving for SUSHI!) 

Food was nice, I'm not sure which menu it was but I think beef tongue appetizer was tasty.
The server was friendly but was bit pushy.

Price is relatively high but that's how it is at any fine restaurants in upscale hotels so I'm not surprised.

Overall it was a good experience.

I really don't like the texture but that is not a knock on the restaurant, just Kobe beef in general.

Tempura Asparagus???  Yes please!  was so good and the dipping sauces provided were great.  Tater Tots?  At a high end restaurant?  Frozen ones will never taste the same.  These are the benchmark for all other tater tots!

It was a little hard to find as it's tucked away inside the Bellagio, past the conservatory and right before the bridge connecting Bellagio to the Vdara (where I stayed). While waiting for my friend to arrive, I was looking around and really dug the soft, intimate setting and d√©cor. They gave me a cocktail menu on - get this - an iPad! Snazzy!

I ordered the Black Crush cocktail which was the most delicious thing ever. I usually don't finish my drinks (I know...) but I finished this one :).

When my friend arrived, we were greeted by two of the best servers. We weren't sure which was our server since both waited on us, but both reminded me of warm, funny uncles you'd see at family dinners. Just detailed, attentive service! 

For bread, they brought out this delicious garlic naan with the best chutney dipping sauce. So good that I wanted to take some home with me but when I asked, they said they didn't bottle it. Management, if you're reading this, you should! 

Anyway, we ordered the TLC sushi roll to start, and an order of Scuna Bay Salmon to share. We were told the fish was really fresh and it was! 

We even met a couple of nice neighbors next door, two colleagues that worked at Netflix and had a nice little chat with them. Gentlemen, if you're reading this, you still owe me a job offer! ;)

At the end of our meal, our ""uncles"" even gave us free truffles for dessert, which was quite nice as our male neighbors didn't get any! Haha. And they nicely packed bread and chutney for us in a fancy box, per our embarrassing request. All in all, a terrific meal and I would definitely return again while I'm in town.

The setting is very quiet, judging by how our neighbors could overhear our conversation and make conversation with us based on it, but it's okay because I guess that's what happens in Vegas!! The prices are also very reasonable, considering it's inside the Bellagio.

However, I would recommend the restaurant more for couples than a large group as it's more romantic than ""fun."" Just a nice place to have a quiet dinner.

5550882,2010-07-10,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"I'm not much of a foodie. And I'm not a fan of Indian food. Oh, and I don't know much about wine. So how come the Indian-inflected, wine-paired prix fixe menu at this classy spot was the best meal we ate in Vegas?

The three-course prix fixe is $59, and the wine pairing is, I believe, another 30 bucks. It's a treat for sure, but it's a reasonable treat. To be honest, ordering a la carte here would give me pause; it's a whole different price point.

We started with a basket of naan and pappadums, which the server felt compelled to explain. The naan was amazing, and you can watch a chef in the glass-enclosed kitchen making it all evening. This is accompanied by four sauces; the tomato chutney is by far the best, although a semi-spicy sweet chili dip is yummy too.

Husband's crunchy shrimp app was light and flavorful and beautifully presented. I had a bite (for research purposes) and moved on to my market salad, which was a nice combo of greens, excellent parmesan, candied pecans in an unobtrusive vinaigrette. And, holy Gruner Veltliner, Batman--that wine pairing was perfect.

Mains: Husband had the flatiron steak, which he praised, along with the pickled onions and ""tater tots."" My curried chicken came with basmati and raita; the buttery sauce was so good that I surreptitiously dropped bits of naan into the bowl to soak up more. Again, the wine, a shiraz blend with a goofy name, scored big flavor points.

For dessert, we both went for the chocolate thingy that's basically the best Kit-Kat bar you'll ever eat. It came with a scoop of ice cream that was not particularly flavorful, but who cares? The port that accompanied this course did all the heavy lifting.

The service is a bit old-school (i.e. napkins placed in laps, wine lists presented to the gentlemen), but not stuffy at all. I think they have to deal with a lot of tourists who are in over their heads, but they do so graciously. The waiter beamed at our praise, as if he was dying to run into the kitchen and convey the news.

The surroundings are, in a word, gorgeous. The other high-end restaurants at the Bellagio look formal, even a bit overdone and self-conscious. Sensi looks rugged and natural, minimalist but not cold. Rough-hewn stone, light wood, walls of waterfalls, inviting bar, various dining rooms tucked away.

5650403,2013-01-11,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"Sensi is a TRUE treat. My family and I have now had three consecutive, flawless experiences at Sensi and this establishment has now worked its way into my top 5 favorite dinner options in Sin City. 

First of all, the setup of the restaurant is beautifully executed-- four different specialty kitchens (all open and just covered by glass) work together to create quite the memorable experience. On this last trip, we were right in front of the naan station. OH, THE NAAN. Standby for further gushing. (On a side note, I'm always a tad amused at the comparison of the kitchens to a zoo-- patrons at Sensi can just walk around the entire enclosure and watch the chefs at work. A very neat, transparent way to dine!)
The decor of the restaurant conveys a semi-upscale and classy ambiance without any stuffiness or pretentious vibes. Their drinks and desserts are all on display via iPad (nice technological touch). Our water glasses were always full and napkins were refolded upon every restroom break or chef-watching walk. 

Now, the food is really what continues to amaze me here. The table first starts off with a basket of naan (an Indian bread). I am the biggest sucker for naan, and this IS the best I have ever had. This last time, we were given three baskets, and I am pretty sure that I ate probably 80% of each basket...whoops. I was so full once my dish came out but I kept powering through. 
I repeat: THE BEST NAAN EVER. Sometimes, I think that Sensi is worth the visit for this alone. 

The menu is split into four different categories/cuisines, so there is a lot to offer to even the pickiest diner. Some of our favorite dishes:
 
Appetizers:

+TLC Roll: Tempura Lobster and Crab sushi roll. There are only four total pieces, but they are excellent. Served with dabs of avocado whipped cream of sorts and some bite-y aioli. 
+Coconut and Shrimp Soup: If I could eat this soup every day for the rest of my life, and nothing else, I would live happily. A downright delicious coconut broth, slammed with different shoots of mushrooms, large shrimp, and a few tapioca balls (like those in Boba tea). Then, this smorgasbord is put into a fresh young coconut. MMMMM
NOTE: (-)Crispy shrimp: We tried this app, but these were actually a disappointment. Way too crunchy and the only dish we haven't liked here. 

Main:

+Sensi Noodles: The Sensi Noodles are amazing and is a fitting Asian dish to complement any other non-Asian dishes you may order. Served lo mein style with several prawns and a perfect balance of flavors with the noodles. 
+Butternut Squash Ravioli: Talk about a tasting overload! I cannot recall having a dish where so many flavors have been incorporated so effectively yet not taking away from the dish; I have a tough time explaining the dish as there were so many different elements and components making up everything besides the raviolis. Mushrooms, a few purple potatoes, spaghetti squash, etc... all basking in the perfect amount of flavorful cream sauce...I don't know what else I can say to do this dish justice! 
+My dad got the rib-eye on our last experience and woooow, I did not expect this piece of meat to be THIS good. I'm typically not a big fan of rib-eye cuts due to the high fat content, but this one was just right. My dad's only advice was to get half of the normal amount of seasoning on the steak..he said it was a little too salty for him. Otherwise, this had the tenderness of a filet and was packed with flavor! Also, the kitchen cooked it to perfection (medium-rare-plus). 

Dessert: 
+Sensi Ice Bubble: A legitimate ice sculpture bigger than my head, hollowed out and filled with three scoops of sorbet or gelato-- wonderful presentation and even more wonderful taste! I love the mango sorbet and pistachio gelato. 
+Coffee and Donuts: Six sugar-dusted beignet donuts served with a Bailey's frozen cappuccino of sorts. A nice cap on dinner! 
 
We have had a waiter by the name of Laurence every time, and he is simply fantastic. He is a very vocal Englishman, but is exceedingly knowledgeable of the menu and one can easily see that he truly loves what he does each and every day. Request him for some high energy at your table! 

Overall, Sensi is a place I will continue to visit each time I'm in Vegas. Give them a shot, I bet you won't leave disappointed!",qT4Tnxde6kNokU5G4Fhv4A,7,2,5,Oi9YWpz3TBLChi3u2NM7nw

The bread was indian and some dishes were indian too. We thought food was ok, it was definately NOT like the night before. We will never go back. We were hungry that we didnt' even think about looking at other restaurants in the hotel. Not worth the money or calories.",NuJ4aLs-WsWbFw9AfLSISQ,0,0,2,EAkEVZavvegYNItI-D0X6g

5683059,2009-07-07,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"Easily one of the top 10 meals I've had in my life. 

First off, I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. It's quiet and private so you can have a meal and hold a conversation. My boyfriend and I ate here before seeing O. 

I wasn't sure how the food would be. It says Asian Fusion but I would describe it more as having Asian, Italian, and Indian food. I didn't really see genres fused together. I had the prix fixe menu for $60 which comes with an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. This is a great deal since appetizers are $15-25 and the entrees are $30-50. 

For my appetizer, I had crispy shrimp. At first, I was like ""okay, fried shrimp... how great can it be?"" after the waiter noted it was one of their signature appetizers. They use huge tiger prawns which are fried to a crisp. There's a sauce that goes with it but I can't recall what was in it. For my entree, I got the sea bass. It comes in a foam sauce. The sea bass was super tender and fell apart so easily with the touch of my fork. For dessert, I had this chocolate hazelnut bar. Loved it! They paired it with caramel ice cream. All the dishes were artistically crafted together to stimulate your visual senses too!

My boyfriend got the ribeye steak... a huge 12oz steak perfectly seasoned and grilled. He was extremely happy with his meal. We also ordered a half bottle of wine and the sommelier was very helpful. They also give you complimentary naan bread to eat with various sauces.

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fancy place to dine at with reasonable prices! They have a 4 Diamond AAA rating for a reason!!!",T7x7M9xhScyFx1tnawzDOQ,4,3,5,m0s0TjwwBhkEiYktuutcCg
5685190,2013-02-05,1,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"Wow.  Sensi is a great concept - separate kitchens for different types of food.  American grill, seafood, Italian and Asian.  The restaurant, located in the Bellagio, has a clean style that really works - at first I thought all the glass could be antiseptic looking but no, not at all.  The water on the walls is an especially nice touch.  We were seated and quickly met our awesome waiter, Lawrence.  Lawrence knew the menu inside, out and backwards and made a few suggestions.  

We started with samosas for the table that were perfectly prepared with an excellent tamarind sauce.  I probably could have stopped there because we were also given papadums and naan with a sublime tomato chutney and yogurt cucumbar raita.  Three in our group ordered the coconut shrimp soup and haven't shut up about it yet.  Served in an almost entirely scraped coconut you can scrape a little for extra flavor.  The presentation was beautiful and they still haven't shut up about how great the soup tasted.

For dinner our party of six (our exchange student has a friend living in Vegas and she was able to meet up with us for dinner) was all over the menu.  K and N went with the butternut squash lasagna which was beautifully presented and delicious.  The other teenager in our group went with the chicken off of the Italian menu and loved it.  We had one seafood dish.  My friend and I both got the tandoori butter chicken curry.  Wow.  As a lover of Indian food I wasn't sure what to expect.  Mind blowing is what you should expect.  It was incredible - soft and perfectly seasoned and over a perfectly cooked rice.

No room for dessert, as usual.  Definitely put Sensi on your list of places to eat while in Vegas.",zP9HLd5nwdpHXhO2rKXjEw,1,1,5,5eaI_fe_EbojvuhEcgsiuQ
5724683,2013-05-29,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"We must have really hit an off night. I found this restaurant to be absolutely nothing special considering all of the wonderful dining options in Las Vegas.  After reading all of the wonderful  reviews I expected it to be great.  I'm disappointed that I wasted a mail while I was in town on this restaurant. 

It's hard for me to say even specifically what I had to eat because it was that unmemorable.  We were a table of four and started with a sushi appetizer. Nothing special, no great flavors, definitely not a  standout.  I had a steak dish that wasn't great either. The drinks were fine,  and in the beginning we considered ordering desert because we saw the elaborate plates they were being served on.   After we finished our entr√©es we definitely changed our minds and decided to skip it..

This restaurant is pretty damn pricy for what you get.   Unmemorable and over rated.",1t3I8ePVDI7iFeJ4Z5xFAQ,2,0,2,0DsXJQEI1O9gRSdnx_wqOg

Bartender could not have cared less when I mentioned it to him. I did ask him to make me a drink that he called his own and it was good but I couldn't tell you what it was.

I won't be going back. Vegas has far too many restaurants with mind blowing food and service that there is no reason to risk being disappointed a second time here. Waste of Vegas time.",2Nc1W2f-Dyn2_-XGVDhNxw,1,0,2,o35kWJcRb20SSAaFEdM81Q
5792528,2010-11-22,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"I wanted to like this place, I really did, but the crappy service and the mediocre food made it hard for me to.

I've passed this place numerous times and the outside alone already made me want to try the restaurant.  I love how there's water flowing over the sign, it's so zen!  I didn't really know much about the restaurant, other than it was some type of Asian fusion but always intended on trying it one day. The perfect opportunity came up when my BF's bday arrived.  Not really knowing how busy this place gets, I made reservations two weeks in advance for a Thursday night. I let the receptionist know that I am celebrating my BF's bday and that we're first time diners.

Fast forward to my baby's birthday..
I'm driving to the strip and my BF has no idea where i'm taking him for his surprise bday dinner.  I pull into the Bellagio and we start walking towards Sensi.  He is ecstatic and happy as hell because he's been bugging me to go to this restaurant for the longest time.  I approach the hostess and checked in for our 8:00pm reservation.  We were seated promptly along a narrow walkway at a big round table set for four.  This table was placed in a very awkward area and I wasn't comfortable there.  Also, because it was just my BF and I who were having dinner I don't understand why the hostess would seat us at such a big table.  I immediately asked if we can be moved to a different one and she quickly blurted out that there were no other tables and walked away.  I called over a man in a suit and asked him if he could please move us to a more suitable table set for two away from the narrow walk way; he gladly obliged.

On to dinner.  We were greeted briefly by our waiter (forgot his name) and was asked what we would like to drink.  He left after and came back asking us if we were ready to order.  it was our first time here, mind you, and had no idea what this restaurant was about.  Luckily, I took it upon myself and briefly browsed some yelps and learned that they offered a prefix menu.  For some reason the waiter didn't feel the need to explain the concept of the restaurant or offer us the tasting menu.  I asked about it, he pointed it out, and then he walked away.  My BF and i decided to give the menu a try so that we could get a pretty good selection.  We let the waiter know our choices and asked if we could decide on dessert after dinner.  He took the menus and walked away.  That was the extent of the service we received from him.  This other guy, who was such a sweetheart, tended to us, checked up on us, filled our waters, changed our plates, gave us bread, etc.  When dinner was over our waiter didn't even offer us dessert.  I overheard him asking the same guy who's been taking care of us to present us with the menu.  At this point i was extremely agitated because I noticed our waiter taking care of his other tables with great care and attentiveness.  I can't imagine why he chose to neglect us; It wasn't  a super busy night and his section was manageable. 

Anyway, I passed on desert (even though it was a part of our meals) because this waiter ruined my night.  He brought out a complimentary birthday desert anyway for my BF.  I tipped him a little less than 15%, although i really felt he deserved a big fat 0!!! Then I side tipped the server assistant some cash, since he's the one who took care of us.
I was on my way out when the same man who moved us earlier asked how our dinner went.  Boy did my BF and I give him our 2cents!  We work in industry so I cant imagine how a place with a 4 star review on yelp have such shitty service!!!!

The food: It was ok.  I had the chicken curry and i've had better.  My BF had the halibut.  It lacked flavor, needed more salt, and was overcooked.  We had King crab roll which were too big and had too  much tempura breading: not good!  The one thing I really did enjoy, however, was the naan that they give along with the different sauces!! YUM!.  

Over all
1.) service was a 0.  I seriously think he discriminated on us based on age, which is a shame because i'm a damn good tipper!!
2.) hostess was a 0.  I don't see why you'd seat me at a big table, knowing it was a party for 2, and then tell me there's no where else to put us... considering I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance!!! Ridiculous!
3.) Food was alright, i'd give it a 3, but i'm mostly basing this review on service.  So my star rating dropped to a 2.  I'd probably come back to try the other stuff because it seems like they have some interesting dishes.  Just really disappointed with the whole experience the hostess and server gave us.  The manager did apologize and gave us his business card urging us to come back.  He advised us to contact him prior so that he can make arrangements to make up for the horrible experience we had on what was supposed to be a really special dinner; I thought that was a plus.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,3,0,2,vQn41xnYZC1OYlNu96PLqg

5906982,2014-03-28,1,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"This place was really, really disappointing. First off, the atmosphere was similar to a cafeteria. VERY loud, VERY outdated furniture and tables, and smelled like wet mop water. Also, all the waiters were wearing name tags staying what country they were from.. What is this, Disney world? When were seated, we're seated next to a couple who clearly, the woman was a hooker. Very scantily dressed, everything falling out. Not to mention, she was scooping Ice from the water on the table and putting it in her plastic to-go cup.. AND had her shoes off. This is SUPPOSED to be a classier restaurant.. NOT in and out burger!! What the hell am I paying for?!? The service was good, we could tell the waiter was doing the best he could with the poor situation he's stuck in. Ordered the salmon cracker appetizer, talk about gross. Salmon tasted old and more fishy then acceptable. For entrees I ordered ahi tuna rare and my boyfriend ordered scallops. Both seriously overcooked. The scallops were like rubber and my tuna was so dry I could barely eat it. We also ordered a side of tempura asparagus, which was greasy and soggy.. Much like something I would get at a Chinese food take out. PLEASE, save yourself from eating at this restaurant... Especially for the $$$, the place is worse than Applebee's. If you're looking for a EXCELLENT place to eat with an amazing, intimate atmosphere, check out Fiamma at the MGM. Although, pretty sure ANYTHING is better than this shithole.",3mat9M7L3bwONRndUtgZLw,1,0,1,wdUfsOpyR76rHYs5sObjoQ
5920150,2011-02-21,0,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"I thought this place was alright. It was not anything spectacular but I would not mind eating there again! It was a little pricey, which I expected, but I know of many other restaurants I'd rather eat at for those prices.

They start you off with naan, which is a type of Indian flatbread. I never really was a fan of Indian food, but this bread was delicious!! It was served with a variety of sauces and it was warm and fresh out of the oven!

For an appetizer, we had the salt and pepper calamari. I really loved it!! It was my favorite part of the meal and I highly recommend it!

For my main course, I just had the tempura crab and lobster roll since I wasn't very hungry. It was only 4 pieces and it was ok. I kind of wish it was served with soy sauce and wasabi. 

I also tried the flat iron steak which was really good. It was just a bit too salty for me and I love salty food!  And I picked at some mashed potatoes as well but there was nothing really special about it.

One really great thing about this place was the treat they gave my good friend for his birthday. It was 3 scoops of ice cream in a little bowl made of ice with a birthday candle. It was complimentary and it was very nice! and tasty too!

I'm big on ambiance so I consider it in my ratings and I thought that this place was nice. It was modern and clean cut but not too stuffy. The main focal point was the kitchen, which was in the middle of the restaurant behind glass. It was really cool. 

And the last good thing about this place was the wine. I got a half bottle of riesling which was roughly about 4 glasses and it ended up being the same price as two individual glasses.",e9wfoS-pYUNrloa6VZBgNw,0,0,3,fSATZzHacz_wTKDLWZlcdw
5975926,2008-10-21,2,bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A,"Came to Sensi for lunch on my first afternoon in Vegas and it was definitely a good call by my brother in law. He lives in Vegas and says he goes to Sensi about three times a week and now I can see why.

The staff was very courteous and the food...magnifique. The best was probably the sashimi which was so fresh and flavors....omg, words can't describe. We also ordered the Chicken Tandoori. Coming from Chicago with Devon Avenue and it's Indian culture it was just hard to top the flavors but I appreciate the attempt.

We ended our meal with gelato. Salty caramel, pistachio and vanilla bean. Wow..the salty caramel was like a party in my mouth. It was sinful. 

I will definitely hit Sensi up again when I'm back in Vegas.",T4qbZR0VHBPESlB1l7jTZw,2,3,4,6QcE78SJO8zZn4OLb14YCg
