We order them over the phone and we never had any issues with this place . Yeah they don't speak really good English but I don't mind  . my fiance don't speak Spanish  , he always picks up the order and never had any problem . My in laws love them too  despite the fact that they are (white ) No offense upon race comment . I'm Mexican and I love  pupusas and so they do.  It's hard not to ...  Every time they come from CA  we get them .  The place  looks run down but food is great .

1761219,2016-02-28,0,ZcNe9rEAZVObPKFwtM8XaA,"Last week i visited this joint and ordered (2) dozen 'Pupusas Revueltas' which ran me around $26.50 after-tax, We had family visiting from out-of-state and thought it would be nice for them to taste some local Salvadorian food. Something that bothered me however was that upon picking them up, the women behind the counter gave me a rude look and were rolling their eyes at me as if i had inconvenienced them in some sort of way - meanwhile the cashier was laughing at some inside joke etc. I personally didn't care but maybe they should try being friendlier to paying customers since we are the reason their business is open. 

Nevertheless i arrived home and we began eating these Pupusas and they were great, Very cheesy and meaty and flavorful. The curtido included was spicy and had bits of jalapeno which i enjoyed since it gave it a nice kick, I'm not a big fan of having tomato sauce with my Pupusas so i ignored the sauce - I can say that i'll happily continue visiting this joint and ordering more Pupusas regardless of how many stares, whispers or eye-rolling i get :) Who knows maybe next time i'll order (4) dozen and invite the entire family to eat Pupusas. 

See you soon...",-m5GK6m4hQiZwl8fpSJkYA,0,0,4,quqn1v2Yt2L6J_J7k537KA

1920878,2015-12-24,8,ZcNe9rEAZVObPKFwtM8XaA,"Pupusas here are just okay- they have a takeout special for 12/$12 but if you're not feeding an army, they'll run you anywhere from 99cents each (no specified filling?) or $2/each for the revueltas (my preferred flavor). 

Not located in the best area, but cozy enough inside, I found that staff do speak English despite reviews to the contrary. However, 20 minutes to receive 2 takeout pupusas seemed to be a bit much. Oh, and they charge $1 credit card service fee. Order was hot and greasy, but filling was minimal and pupusas seemed doughier? Didn't really care for them, but might keep the $12 bag in mind the next time I'm invited to a potluck.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,9,3,K62XZVmemtgIDMMCiVN0zw

2263302,2011-11-30,4,ZcNe9rEAZVObPKFwtM8XaA,"Since the eastside seems to get all the good pupusa action, I was excited to see a new Salvadoran spot closer to my part of town. I was even more excited when I stopped in and found a menu featuring many central American specialties, in addition to the famous pupusa. To be honest, the first thing that attracted me to this place was its name. I liked the sound of the word ""zunzal,"" and wanted to know what it meant. It turns out to be a popular surfing destination in El Salvador (sometimes spelled ""sunzal,"" but clearly more fun with two z's), and this restaurant shows its beach inspiration with a menu of many seafood creations.  

I was greeted in Spanish as I entered and approached the counter. Standing at the counter, you have a full view of the kitchen. The service was extremely friendly and welcoming, so I can highly recommend this place to anyone, even if you don't possess basic Spanglish skills! I did not try to communicate in English, so if you're sensing a language barrier, I'm sure you can get by with a point-and-order simply by pointing at the menu. Or, even better, lose the intimidation and ask for ""la especialidad de la casa"" and let them cook for you. For vegetarians, I recommend the pupusas stuffed with cheese and loroco. Native to El Salvador, loroco is a little green flower of herbaceous character. It's a veggie pupusa! These are served with the standard accompaniments, a mildly spiced tomato sauce and some quality curtido (crisp, vinegary cabbage slaw). I noticed a few flavors of atol on a specials board and ordered an atol de piña, just to try something different. Very comforting in cold weather, atoles are warm, starch-thickened beverages, often flavored with chocolate, corn, or fruits and infused with spices. The atol de piña was very good, with plenty of pineapple and cinnamon flavor. I would order it again.

The outdated building has housed many different restaurants over the years. You may notice a drive-thru lane outside, but it is presently not in service.  One wall in the dining area welcomes you to ""Gringo's,"" and a neon-lighted ceiling box in the center of the room reminds me of a party room in a 1980s roller rink. There's a TV passing telenovelas and possibly soccer games, in addition to a very loud jukebox full of Vicente Fernandez albums. I was flipping through the jukebox as I waited for my takeout order (say ""para llevar"") when a random selection started blaring over the speakers. Why do these sneaky machines always trick me into revealing my apparent affection for ranchera standards? I feel safe that my closet full of enormous sombreros is still a secret.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,5,2,4,B-A9sMQWfanFBO13chPpvA

3407932,2014-09-28,0,ZcNe9rEAZVObPKFwtM8XaA,Horrible service. There's no menu on the walls or some sort of hint as to what they serve. I had to ask for a paper menu. She looked at me like I was crazy when I asked her for the menu. She automatically assumed I knew what was going on in there which I didn't. Waited about 20 min for 4 pupusas which were okay but not enough content inside. You would think they would invest in the esthetics of their store and the quality of their food rather than the expensive surveillance system they have. The sitting area was dirty you can tell no effort is out in their cleaning and it doesn't feel like they give one crap about the way their restaurant looks. I'm sure if they cared they would be getting better reviews on here.,S0T8URqHW5rrdpTbtHquLg,1,0,2,XLOk7OPhEA2PJotWdm76xA

I know theres sings all over the restaurant saying they make fresh food and it is NOT a fast food place. That's is why the restaurant looks tacky. Anyway, after I asked, she brought me the pupusas right away. So that means, the pupusas were ready she just wasn't giving them to me? Honestly if I wouldn't have asked she wouldn't have given them to me. I was sitting right in front of her I don't know how she have forgotten. I get home I cut the pupusa (beans and cheese) in half and it oozed out with oil. There was sooo much oil it was soupy sitting on the plate. I was so grossed out I threw it in the trash.

Good food would have given more stars if they spoke English. You get a basket of chips and salsa. The sweet sauce in the squirt bottle was good on the pupusa so was the spicy cabbage slaw stuff.

SERVICE:  the place was mostly empty, but service was solid;  timely;  not effusively ingratiating, but perfectly decent

PUPUSAS et. al.:  Enjoyable revueltos pupusa;  the masa did not have the rich corn fragrance that is the hallmark of great pupusas to me, and the cheese was a bit odd;  but the nice crunch outside and lovely goop inside was fun to eat.  Had a chipilin tamale and it was all right.   The slaw that comes with the pupusa was light on flavor, but the weak vinegary/sweet squeeze bottle sauce helped.

SALSA:  I thought the little dish of salsa served with the chips was a highlight - - it is a light, thin concoction, but with onion and cilantro that was so fragrant, I was drinking it out of the cup.

OVERALL:  It was a nice bite to eat;  I'll keep my eyes open for Vegas pupusas that are more aromatic though.",oDftpTXngPupJl4HuVX29g,1,0,3,ZeofDO1VmFVLDkbMTHlpOQ
