I patronized this place twice while I was in Las Vegas once for takeout and came back for a business lunch.  The place itself is clean and decorated nicely and the staff was quite attentive.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  Big Dragon was NOT like most Kosher Chinese establishments which tend to be heavy handed with the sauces and make them too sweet.  The flavors and textures were great when I ate there.

The ONLY negative was the takeout food, it was kind of... soggy as opposed to crispy (which is what I was expecting) BUT that could have been due to the time spent in the to go container.  The food I had during my lunch later in the week was better and was well received by my non-Jewish lunch companions.  

The spicy honey chicken was excellent and so was the beef sizzling something... I recommend them.

As soon as we walked in, the first thing we experienced was this awkward silence (and smell of warehouse furniture) as if they don't get a lot of people walking in. 

The food was okay. Definitely NOT authentic Chinese. More a like a PF Chang's but the quality of Panda Express, which would be fine if it didn't cost $16 for a tiny square plate of beef and black bean sauce or $10 for small plate of vegetarian pan fried noodles. $0.50 cents per bowl for rice and $2.50 a pot for tea. The food wasn't bad and hardly the worst part. 

There was only 1 waitress and she was terrible! Spoke little English and even asked us to spell the dish we ordered to her so she can write it correctly on her note pad. When I asked for a bowl of rice, she asked me 3 times what I meant before understanding ""oohh,  a bowl of rice. How many you want?"" When we first got our appetizer, she gave us 2 small dishes to eat the appetizers. About 10 minutes later, the rest of our food came out, and the waitress rushed us to eat our appetizer, pretty much forcing us to finish the last few pieces of our scallion pancakes so she can take the plate. When we finished, I used my side plate to rest all of my utensils on while I ate our other entrees. She came by and made me take my utensils off the side plates so she can take them. Okay.... While we were eating, we noticed that she got food orders wrong, served the wrong table, was clueless to menu items, and rushed people to eat and get out... which, we did as soon as the check was given to us.

The food wasn't bad, but OVERPRICED. You can get the same thing at Panda Express or Pick Up Stix located in the same shopping center. The atmosphere just felt wrong. NOT Chinese at all. This place is owned by a Jewish family with one young Chinese guy playing manager and a random Asian guy with his laptop at the counter who did not talk to anyone. When we were there, we were the ONLY table that were real customers. The rest of the restaurant customers were friends of the owner because they all had Jewish attire and hats on. Even THEY asked for discounts because of the mistakes the waitress kept making.

We were so disappointed, we couldn't stop talking about how terrible the place was for the rest of the week. I never Yelp. But this was very memorable.. in a very bad way...",x19UXBhoAROtK-9fvKmHsw,0,0,1,Y8SLnpRC7W_U9obYgsdRwg

Based on the other Kosher restaurants I have been too I thought they were better than most. Since we were with a group of people we had a set menu. I would definitely like to come back and try eating here again on my own. The staff was very accommodating to our large group and worked with us to help please everyone in our group.,TqKDnj5_IthGvPCGgN1qvQ,0,0,4,9sY73VwVnhX7yI3ybtJpmQ

The owner needs to be more aggressive about asking the questions and realize that his mashgiach won't mind receiving them.

Pot stickers were awesome, Mongolian beef was NOT what I was expecting, being blanketed in gooey Mu Shu plum sauce instead of garlicky Mongolian seasoning, and onions instead of scallions.  I'd be totally panning this dish, but the texture of the beef was so perfect, tender and succulent, that I forgave any sticky sweet sauce they wanted to put on it.

Orange chicken was really nice, big chunks of meat, very fresh and crispy, and not greasy.  We also got a dish of stir-fried vegetables that were just what you'd expect, plain brown garlic/ginger/soy sauce, tasty, nothing exciting but nothing objectionable.

The guy who runs the place is married to the woman who used to run the old Shalom Hunan in Newton, MA (the good one, not the nasty one that used to be in Vegas).  Hoping to write a follow-up review next year with more stars!  I hope they pull it off.",w0yV8aE6ROzWixLOpu1njg,2,0,3,qQJ_klaNnvt8D6Lp0B_nLQ
3378467,2011-07-23,5,bIkFvvNaJEF3Io50VPQueg,"I'm going to quote the NFL's Randy Moss from the 2010 Minnesota Vikings ; ""I wouldn't feed this (expletive) to my dog!"" Okay, I might not have a dog. But if I did, he would spit in my face if I tried to feed him a bowl of food from Big Dragon.

As a life-long fan of Chinese food, I was super excited to try Big Dragon. When I saw that it was not only a Chinese restaurant, but kosher as well, 
I expected quality meat (texturally) with a high Jewish price tag. 

Simply put, Big Dragon is a fresh idea that fails miserably in execution. The young waiter had absolutely no idea about the lunch specials, the place was dirtier than the underside of a large black hog, the food sucked harder than a prostitute vacuum cleaner (decent meat, bad sauce, small portions), and a meal from the LUNCH SPECIAL cost more than the production of a James Cameron film.

The bottom line is that Las Vegas sucks hard when it comes to finding good Chinese cuisine. At this rate I'm going to have to import a kid from South China and rotisserie him/her just to get my Chinese fix. 

PS - To the owners of Big Dragon, you have got to put 'kosher' somewhere on your front entrance sign. It might help business if people know your restaurant is kosher.",kKbGPQ1Cn-6J1XRkdA50Uw,1,1,2,MNM3EU5XV8VaTSgFN1fxpg
