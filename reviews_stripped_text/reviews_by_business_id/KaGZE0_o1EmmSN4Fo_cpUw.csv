It was about 2:20 pm on Sunday. This is a long Veterans day weekend. We were offered a Hangover brunch menu which was fine. We ordered the steak and eggs dish for me and a sandwich for my husband. I also ordered some coffee, which came in a PAPER cup...!!! This was supposed to be a place that is at least one step above McDonald's, right? I was stunned, because everything else was much fancier, like nice glasses for water, atmosphere and all.. I didn't want to sound difficult or anything, I just wanted a regular coffee cup, but when Iasked for it i was told they had them put away... ???!! I also had no spoons or other utensils on our table, and even after the paper coffee cup was brought noone thought of bringing me a spoon... Had to ask another waiter for it... And even when he finally brought the spoon it never crossed their mind to bring us forks and knives to eat with... Basically, we had to ask for every little thing to make us eat comfortably...The dish took about half an hour to get to our table, and of course, the steak was burnt... At that point we were just so hungry and tired of waiting, that all I wanted was to eat and get out of there..I am not even mentioning the fact that when my husband said he didn't eat pork the waitress didn't offer to substitute it with chicken or something, and ended up charging the same price for a meatless version of his dish.. Needless to say that on a 30 something dollar bill we gave only a $2 tip for the terrible service and food we got. I hope they read this and improve, otherwise they would lose all the customers- there are plenty of places around to eat in Vegas!",3WE_KIJvGueXpeOxRsDM3A,0,0,1,SZILBlU6G4uB3mQV3xXmCg

124276,2012-09-24,0,KaGZE0_o1EmmSN4Fo_cpUw,"How often do two different restaurants open with the same name in the same city? I guess this is a stupid question because I really don't care about the answer, but it surely creates some confusion. This recently happened with the opening of Public House at the Luxor. Somehow sharing the same name as the expensive but superior Public House at the Venetian, the one at the Luxor opened with minimal fanfare a couple weeks ago. Does it hold up as well as the fancy Gastropub down the street?

Public House at the Luxor has a decent but somewhat generic Stations-feeling interior to it; it's very open and clean, but not really as stylized or fun as it could be. It features a few pipes tied back to the beer kegs similar to what you would find at a place like Yardhouse or even the unrelated restaurant of the same name at the Venetian, but they're not quite as impactful. There's a darker, more intimate and inviting bar area as well as a large open dining area. The General Manager came to my table to greet me before my food came out, and mentioned that the official opening of the restaurant was later that night. An early opportunity such as this is exciting, but kind of leaves the venue open to a revisit if the meal is less than ideal so early on.

The menu isn't available yet on their website, or much else for that matter, but their Luxor page mentions 'upscale American Fare'. I didn't really pay attention to anything other than their burger: half pound angus burger, brioche with a choice of a cheese and a topping including mushrooms, saut√©ed onions, fried onions and the like. What came out didn't look too impressive, but the meat had great flavor upon first bite and was cooked more to medium than the medium rare I had ordered. The brioche bun was buttery and good, and the mushrooms had good flavor. The cheese was melted well and coated my entire patty. Speaking of the patty, it seemed hand-formed as it wasn't close to being a perfect circle and had a pretty weird shape to it. Even if it actually isn't hand-formed, the illusion is always welcome. Overall the burger was a bit messy, but this is a somewhat negative connotation that I don't want to apply to this burger as a formed standard looking burger every time gets dull, and the irregular look is a bit refreshing.

The fries sucked; they had little flavor and weren't really hot. They got very hard by the end and had a kind of odd unwelcome texture to them. The best part about them was definitely the chipotle ketchup which wasn't an option given to me by my waiter when asked if I wanted ketchup, but by the person that brought my food out later on with no ketchup in hand.

The burger comes with kettle chips or salad for $12, which isn't too bad of a price for a restaurant directly in a casino, but I hate the fact that I have to pay an extra $3 to get fries instead. That, combined with my iced tea brought my meal to $18.75 very quickly, which is a bit much for what you get. I suppose I could start drinking water and cutting out easily $3-4 with every meal, but I'm sure most visitors to these locations would probably order a beer or something more expensive so it doesn't matter much. The additional money for fries annoys me, but if you're looking for a burger and don't want to leave the Luxor this isn't too bad. If you're willing to walk a couple minutes and spend a few dollars more, Burger Bar is by far the better choice.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,0,3,Dn40vKoaBuyUcIDnbPUdog

There were also some Thai chicken wings that my boyfriend was so in love with that he felt he could not explain them well enough. He has already told about 5 people about these wings, haha. He says he has never had anything like them before. I'm not a fan of humus but the humus bill served us was very tasty. I could not get enough of it. Pasta is always my go to menu item so I really enjoyed the Mac n Cheese. It was the perfect amount of cheese and I love the presentation in the small cast iron skillet. My favorite dish was the meatloaf, which I am also not usually a fan of. The flavors were so delicious and the mash potatoes were to die for.

We happened upon Public House while checking out what's new and exciting South Strip. There were large happy hour signs beckoning us in and, hey, we were hungry and thirsty so, why not? 

We sat at one of the two bar tops (if I recall correctly, they only offer happy hour at the bars and adjacent tables). Service was quick, the food and drinks were tasty and a good deal. 

So, why the 3 stars? Maybe it was an off day but, quite a few people on staff seemed unhappy, particularly with one another and it was pretty tangible, enough so that it affected the experience. Hopefully, this is not typical because we did enjoy the food and drink and, overall the service was fine but it certainly didn't feel relaxed in any way.

We may give Public House another shot down the road but, there are so many great places to go that its likely to be lower on the list.",oiwP8zb5Rm3Ec9c-Yazvfg,0,0,3,3XDGr7XDfol7LRMxby3xLg

The menu was on display outside and we immediately agreed to eat here instead. 

It is a very open restaurant with big screen TVs covering the walls. Our server Rian was amazing! She greeted us immediately got our drinks and started our appetizer (Mac n' Cheese squares!) The fried Mac n' Cheese squares came 5(?) to a plate (I cant remember they were basically gone the second they were put on our table) They came with a buffalo wing sauce and a chipotle ranch sauce. Entrees followed soon after.

I had the turkey burger, with guacamole, smoke gouda, on an onion bun. I opted to substitute my fries for a healthier side salad, My boyfriend had the angus burger with the fries. Everything was simply amazing. My boyfriend complained about his onions (not regular raw onions but a sauteed onion placed under the cheese) I do not hold this against the restaurant because our server had asked if everything on the burger was ok for him, he said yes. I did steal a few fries off my boyfriends plate and they were perfectly cooked in my opinion, extra crunch on the outside without getting the overcooked feel.

She looked at us, wrinkled her forehead and said ""well, i don't know, we are closed."" I asked if we can order take out and she said ""we're closed!!!"" I just walked away because she looked like she was just done with everything.

I will not be eating here, or coming back to try the food. I know it is late, but you don't stand in the back of the restaurant trying to communicate with guests standing at the front register.",8fNL7S316mkkMMPW9RYKYw,2,2,1,ZaNsy8FB_CClN3h01VegWA

It was astonishing how poor the service was, as the place was not even busy. Having worked in the industry, it was difficult for me to leave a poor tip.

Holy Smokes I could drink beer here forever. I ordered my beer and my wife ordered some kind of cocktail. Since we were ready to order our server took our order. We both ordered a Public Burger with Homemade Kettle Chips. 
Within no time, our burgers were sitting in front of us. The burgers looked amazing. The burger tasted like it looked amazing. The bun was toasted just right, not over toasted not under toasted. The veggies were crispy and fresh. The meat cooked just right. I asked for it medium and I go it medium. It had great flavors and was perfect. I ate the homemade Kettle Chips last since they are usually my favorite. I was kind of afraid that they would be soggy, but they were not. They were still crispy. and tasted super good, with the right amount of salt and pepper on them. I couldn't get enough of them, so I ate half of my wife's.

There are definitely bigger, better, livelier sports bars around, but we decided on a bar closer to our room as we wanted enough time to change for a fancy dinner later in the evening. 

The tv screens were adequate, but nothing special. The main screen could use an update, but honestly, we could see the game from multiple angles and that is really what matters. Due to living outside of Washington, we have to stream half the games anyways. 

Since we had a big dinner planned a few hours after the game, we shared an order of the nachos and had a few 22 ounce beers.  The tap selection was pretty basic and a bit overpriced. 

Service was slow, but that didn't matter all that much as we had plenty of time to kill. 

The kettle nachos were pretty good for bar fare. They were smothered with a fondue style gooey cheese and slow cooked beef. Good enough to hold us over until dinner.

All of the staff were really friendly and energetic.

We got two dozen Buffalo Wings for the table and the wings were meaty and perfectly cooked, while the memory of their Buffalo sauce is making my mouth water as I write this: It was delicious. I tried the Public House burger and ordered it medium and it was closer to well done. But the ""three hour onions"" (carmelized onions) and aged white cheddar were delicious toppings. That brioche bun, though! Holy cow that is a huge bun. Delicious, but there was no way I could finish both the large burger AND the enormous bun! My daughter had the Turkey Burger and she said it was delicious. My son had the Philly Cheese Steak and said it was really well-prepared, with the roast beef nicely seasoned, tender and thin, and the gooey melted cheese and carmelized veggies were perfect. They got fries, crispy and well-seasoned hand-cut fries, and I got a side salad (because it's tough to get your veggies in when dining in Vegas).

2653082,2018-06-01,0,KaGZE0_o1EmmSN4Fo_cpUw,"Pub House (In Luxor): A 2018 Regret?

I've eaten here before in 2015, and it was a tasty delight! However, it's 2018, and I understand things change. This time, though, was very different: the menu is SMALLER, and we were told it changes frequently now. So, I went with the ""Cajun Chicken Sandwich"" ($17!) thinking ""surely, that is gonna full me up: it's under 'sandwich/plates'... right?""

Well, color me ""dead wrong"". The person I was with ordered ""The Dougie Sandwich"". Now THAT was a sandwich MEAL (my eyes saw... oh, gods, did they see..)! I got a 5"" x 2"" ""ciabatta bun"" (it's super flat, including the single layer of (pressed?) chicken! I finished my ""meal"" in 2 minutes (10 bites?), and embarrassingly sat there watching my dinner partner pause in the middle of his (proper) meal, exclaiming how huge his sandwich (""The Dougie"") was - AND he hadn't touched his salad!

Why I chose ""pub fries"" was my first regret I wish I could take back, trust me! I sat nibbling on the fries, trying to draw out an additional 20 minutes while my friend finished his meal.

Do i regret this restaurant? At first I was unsure: Things change in 3 years, but not my sense of what the size of a meal is... Sitting across from your friends at dinner watching them eat is just wrong on so many levels.

So, yeah: I was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED on my repeat visit.

3626414,2018-04-24,48,KaGZE0_o1EmmSN4Fo_cpUw,"THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

Ok, so I had just visited the museum, BODIES...The Exhibition, walked around and took pics of the Luxor, the shoppes at Mandalay, and the Mandalay (of the parking lot and window of the shooting 3 hours before the shooting), and my feet were sore, so I found the bar closest to my vibe and sat down.

In retrospect, it all makes sense, but at the time, I was supposed to be at The Cosmopolitan, and was only at the Luxor because of BODIES...The Exhibition, and had no idea about the country music extravaganza, Route 91 Harvest Music Festival.

So, you've seen what I look like, and at that time, I was wearing a semi-casual white dress and heels at the Public House in the Luxor, one hour before the country concert, and I still didn't know about the country thingy.

Everyone around me was wearing jean shorts and cowboy hats, and kept asking me if I was the Dolly Parton impersonator, and all I kept thinking was how downhill the Luxor had become since the last time I stayed there.

The bartender, Chad, came over and I ordered a Bloody Mary and I asked him what he thought was good. He suggested their pulled pork tacos, which I ordered, and they were AMAZING!!

Chad told me he had to go work the other part of the bar, and for about 10 minutes, there wasn't a bartender.

Meanwhile, the six guys sitting next to me, who were there for their friend's bachelor party, and who had previously divulged they were ""in law enforcement,"" (yes, I saw their badges), mentioned they were tired of waiting for their bill, and they were going to just bounce on their tab. I laughed and told them Chad was going to be right back, but whatever.

Then a new bartender, Aaron, showed up, and the six cops paid their bill. I figured that was a good time to head over to the bathroom, and told everyone, ""I'll be right back.""

Aaron, the bartender, told me to STOP, and give him TWO forms of ID and my credit card before he'd ""allow"" me to go to the bathroom. OK WHAT?!?

I'd been sitting there talking with countless guests, just basically stopped six guys from bailing on their bill, and I wasn't going to be ""allowed"" to go pee unless I showed TWO forms of ID and a credit card?!?!

Real classy, Aaron, but whatever ahahahaha 

I gave him my passport, my global entry pass, my Arizona driver's license AND my AMEX platinum card and went pee.

Eventually Aaron left, Chad came back, and I had another beer, and I eventually headed out; not before talking to the manager about the incident, maybe why the Public House has only 3 Stars on Yelp, and discussed social media in general.

Needless to say, the manager was VERY friendly and we laughed about it. 

30 minutes later, 150 people, probably some of the people I spoke with over the afternoon, were shot and killed/injured 20 feet from that bar.

At this point in most of my reviews, I usually tell a little about the history of the establishment, and little tidbits I learned whilst being there, but I'm not going to research the place.

CONCLUSION 

It's a nice place.

Chad's Bloody Mary's were OUT OF THIS WORLD! The pulled pork tacos were super YUMMY!

The TV screens are impressive, as is the bar, and I'm sure there's plenty of turn over in staff. 

Chad and Luis were EXCELLENT bartenders!

The manager was super sweet.

Just make sure you bring ID if you want to use the restroom.

A-ok!!! Truly. Yes, prices are pretty high which made our party search for the items that seemed pretty reasonably priced. It's Vegas and we understand the $$ so no offense to this place.

We all decided to order some of their signature items and they were very very tasty.

1) short rib tacos (3)- it's an appetizer but can be an entree. The tacos are large and in charge. The meat is braised in beer and is super tender. Topped with siriacha and a slaw on the bottom. Order the siriacha on the side that way you have more. 

2) kettle chip nachos- appetizer that can totally be shared. We are talking crispy chips smothered in white cheese sauce and topped with the same braised short rib. So so tasty!

3) filet mignon sliders (3)- thick filets of tender beef, caramelized onions, and blue cheese. I ordered a side of salad instead or fries because I needed to add some freshness. Again, great!

The staff was very friendly. If I was too lazy to come out of my hotel to eat, I would orders these items again!",o9zhrbHlaMhW9-dxxfOy5w,2,3,3,SrO0zNMeGCdjngV35pkwzA

4085378,2013-01-24,0,KaGZE0_o1EmmSN4Fo_cpUw,"This past weekend, we were staying at Luxor and had made plans to meet someone at Public House; it seemed like a nice place and wasn't too busy. Unfortunately, she was sick and had to cancel, but we stayed the course and went there as planned.

When we arrived, the hostess said she had a half booth/half table available for us, despite the fact that there were about 4-5 open booths in sight. I mentioned this, and she said that the server in that section was overwhelmed, and that she didn't want us to have a poor experience. Okay, so kudos to her for being honest; shame on management for being so poorly staffed on a Saturday afternoon in Las Vegas. Reluctantly we did the half table.

We sat there for literally 10 minutes before anyone came to the table. Finally, it was the same hostess that came and poured some water for us, saying someone would be right out.

That should have been our exit right then and there. But, we stayed.

Our waitress was nice, but she called me ""sweetheart"" as soon as she came to the table. Now, I wouldn't take notice usually IF the waitress were older than me, or I was in the South. However, she was young, and Vegas is definitely not the South; it really rubbed me weird. Other than that, she was friendly and took our orders: Steak & Eggs special, for $15 each.

After ordering, we waited. And waited. And waited. The food took forever to come out, with the waitress showing up only once to say that the orders were almost ready. No ""Can I get you anything while you wait?"" or anything. Meh.

We ordered our steaks medium rare. When the plates came, mine was brown all the way through and my girlfriend's was barely pink. We opted just to eat and get the hell out, because the meal was going to be comped off of our account anyway by the M Life folks. However, the food was SO bland and tasteless, we were really put off.

My girlfriend ate maybe 1/3 of her food and I about 2/3 (the hash browns and scrambled eggs were okay). At that point, we were done. Our waitress never came over to ask how everything was once. Finally, she came and without asking, simply picked up our plates.

Here's the thing - if you were a server in a restaurant and one of your guests barely ate anything on her plate, wouldn't you be trained or even INCLINED to ask if there was a problem with the food? Not even a little bit? Nope; nada. She just picked up the plates and left.

In the end, I asked to speak to the manager. It was a young guy, and when he asked what was wrong, I wasn't an ass about it, but I told him I couldn't remember a worse meal in recent memory in Las Vegas. He asked what specifically was wrong, and I told him whoever was in the kitchen didn't deserve to be working there - that we could have gone to McDonald's in the food court and had tastier food. I then explained that I'd ordered my steak medium rare and it was as pink as the sole on my Doc Martin. He said he wished we'd told him sooner, and then I mentioned that would be impossible since we hadn't seen our waitress the entire time we had our food except for when she came to collect the plates. I told him his staff was not good, nor were they intuitive to guests' needs at all - or they simply are use to this and don't care anymore.

The manager was apologietic and asked us to give them another chance during our weekend, and I explained that honestly, in Vegas, where there are SO many GOOD choices of exciting restaurants that there was virtually no margin for this type of horrible service. I was frank, and told him we wouldn't be coming back. At that point, he took the check, said he'd take care of it and walked away; it was obvious that he'd dismissed us and that it was over.

Regardless of whether a meal is going to be comped or not - and there is no way for a kitchen staff to know anyway - NO restaurant in Vegas should be content with this, and no management team should be okay with it. Shame on Luxor too, for not being aware that this is happening in one of their prime food locations.

I wanted to be seated in the regular dining area though and asked if there was a difference between the options at the bar and in the dining area and the hostess said no. So we waited to be seated and he takes us to the bar area in the dining area and seats us there. I wanted an actual table and a server and was not there to drink. When we asked the host he said that they had already put to many people at the tables. Basically left us no choice but to sit there. Also he gave us the late night menu which is a hugely condensed menu and that didnt start until 11 and it was not yet 11 but again made us feel like this was our only option. I ordered with the bartender who was very nice and he even let us order off the regular menu because like i had mentioned it was not yet 11pm. Eventually I got fed up with sitting at the bar and asked if we could sit at a regular table and they obliged but weren't happy about it. We ordered fried mac and cheese, surf and turf burger, and a bacon burger. All sounded way better than they actually tasted. The concept was there but the execution of the food was not great. Everything was dry and just was not great. And for the price was not worth it. I would highly recommend to only go here if ur ok spending lots of money on food that should be way cheaper.

I had no expectations, obviously I know that it's not a high end place, but I don't think that should stop it from being edible. There are a hundred restaurants that I can name that are not high end that are delicious, sadly this is not one of them. 
I ordered the fish and chips. It was a giant breaded fish on top of fries. It looked like a a little wooden paddle. The breading was thick, greasy and dry at the same time. Kind of a weird sensation in your mouth trying to figure out if you are eating fish or if the grease has just congealed into a disgusting blob. 
The rest really wasn't much better. I mean the kids had burgers. How hard is it to make a burger? It must be very hard because the burgers here were like some cafeteria bs.

Our waiter was a fucking zombie. I don't remember his name, but he was dead behind the eyes and slightly creepy. And you have to be pretty creepy for me to think you're creepy. 

All of their signature drinks were on special for happy hour, but every single one of them was some sugary concoction. Figured I'd play it safe and get a mojito... but they were out of mint. He asked if I still wanted one, clearly ignoring the fact that mint is what makes a mojito work so well. I got some blueberry lemonade thing (at my chick's insistence). It was so sweet my face puckered. 

Time for some appetizers! The cheese steak spring rolls sounded great... except that they're egg rolls, not spring rolls (learn the difference, guys!), and they consisted entirely of meat shoved into a fried egg roll. That was it. The picture they showed made them look delicious, what with all the cheese and steak and onions and gooey innards slowly oozing out. This... this was gross.

Immediately we could see that the sense of urgency within the restaurant was poor, it was Sunday at 1830Hrs and they were nearly 50% to capacity, so,.. maybe that had something to do with it . 

We ordered their Public House burger both Medium temp, at $17 each with added bacon on one for $2 extra. Twenty (20) minutes later, no burgers. When we inquired with our server we were told ""the kitchen is backed up.."" and no time given as to how much longer until we asked, then she said ""about 10 more minutes,"" as if that was just the norm. Spoke to a manager and he went to investigate, seven (7) minutes later we were getting our burgers. That's thirty (30) minutes for burgers, oh! and they were Medium Well, not medium (pink all the way through-as was iterated upon ordering them). The food was not only late, it was cooked to the incorrect temperatures, we ate it as we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes.

The brioche buns were very fresh and yummy, the fries were crunchy and seasoned well. 

We requested Ranch to go with the fries and we were told it was 50¬¢, ok that's fine, no big deal. Just to note, if you are going to charge for condiments, the quality assurance for your other dressings should be great, the Caesar dressing for the side salad was oily and runny, hence it was broken (the oil was no longer emulsified by the egg yolks and dijon).

Public House has a great selection of beers and even carries a Gluten Free beer, which I was SO excited about!  As for the prices...I'd say considerably overpriced - $10 for a Guinness draft...really?  I know it's the strip...but we're at the Luxor people, not Bellagio.  A good beer bar should always err on the side of reasonable pricing, because people will absolutely have that 1 or 2 extra if they don't have to cringe a bit for every pint.

We ordered wings and sliders - the prices were a bit bloated here as well, but consistent with any other strip sports bar.  The wings were actually very good, as were the sliders, so no cringing there.  My girlfriend had the steak salad, which was also very good - just be sure to get the dressing on the side, it's loaded with blue cheese and dressing, which can weigh the whole thing down.

What really stuck out was our bartender, Jamie.  She was very personable, had good beer knowledge, and even though the Chargers were dampening my mood, she brightened up our night!

We sat down and waited 5 minutes but there was only a bartender for the entire bar, bar tables and lounge area.  I went to the bar to get the menu and the bartender apologized but said there was a waitress for that area.   We chose what we wanted and there was still no sight of our waitress, so my Hubs went to the bar to order.  In that time, our waitress came back to the lounge area.  My Hubs had been standing in line at the bar for 10 minutes before he got to the front of the line.  When the bartender saw she had returned, he sent him away instead of just entering the order.  After our waitress took our order, the drinks arrived 13 minutes after and the food another 10 minutes after that.  Yes, I was so agitated at this time that I had started a draft review.  Everyone who was there had drinks and there was only 2 other couples waiting to place their drinks.  I'm pretty steamed at this time, BUT they could have redeemed themselves on the food!

We got the mac and cheese squares that everyone had raved about, the philly spring rolls and the kettle chip nachos.  The kettle chip nachos could easily have fed a good 4 people.  I liked the crunch of the chips and the cheese sauce but the short ribs on the nachos were not that great.  I can't place my finger on if it wasn't salted enough but I'll give it to them...the meat was very tender.  The philly spring rolls were meaty, cheesy and crunchy.  Those were definitely my top choice in the 3 we ordered.  The mac and cheese looked great, had a amazing breaded crunch but failed in taste.  My Hubs described it as ""deep fried butter noodles,"" which is spot on.  There was no oozy cheese sauce or cheese flavor at all.  I ate half a square and did not finish the rest.  We ended up leaving most of that dish behind. 

Might be back for the nachos & spring rolls if we are gambling in this casino again but I would definitely not purposely come here to eat.

Note: This review is for the Midwest chain ""Public House "" at Luxor NOT the stand alone at the Venetian.  

To the core of the gastropub, the beer.  Weak selection with less than 20 on tap, 20 in bottles.  Very few unique microbrews or craft beers.  PBR and the werewolf killer reign supreme.

The food; aggressive flavors, lots of fatty, fried goodness, just lacking wow factor.   The best sellers: 

Spicy braised short rib tacos.  Spicy, flavorful, braised then shredded short ribs with siracha and greens served with a side of creamy guacamole and salsa.  Delicious but very wet from excessive braising liquid in the taco.

Cheese steak spring roll (steak, chipotle peppers, jalapeno jack cheese all rolled up in a crispy spring roll skin and deep fried golden brown) gooey goodness but one dimensional even with the house made spicy ketchup.

Buffalo shrimp (breaded, deep fried jumbo shrimp with a bleu cheese and buffalo hot sauce) definitely good eats.  Over cooked and rubbery but somehow welcomed as pub grub.  

Filet mignon sliders.  Nice.  Thick cut pieces of medium well filet topped with deeply caramelized onions and bleu cheese in a sweet but somewhat dry Maui onion brioche.  A-OK.

A great place to catch a game.  Fun and friendly service.  Lots of promotions and a great happy hour.  Foodies may want to look elsewhere for a great gastropub experience.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,17,16,3,liBZ1DX-GfMXW0cot-m12Q

We had a cocktail, the rum punch, which was really good and definitely the highlight of our meal.  He ordered the chicken wings, which was a really big serving and I had the Cobb salad.

The ranch sauce tasted like it was spoiled, so we left it pretty much as we got it.  Overall, the food was average at best., but the drinks were really well made.

I ordered the Asian Chop salad which was very delicious. I didn't order it with chicken but when I received my salad it had chicken on it. And when we went to pay our bill the chicken wasn't added to the bill. I know I probably shouldn't be complaining about that but that's loss of inventory for the restaurant.

I arrived at Public House around 6:00pm today with my brother and husband, ordered by 6:10 and let our server, Charles know that we have a show with Blue Man Group at 7:00pm. We asked the server to bring everything out at once or as soon as the food is ready. 

We ordered Kettle Chip Nachos, 6 pc traditional wings, Cubano Sandwich, Steak Salad and Pastrami Sandwich. We received the Kettle Chip Nachos and Wings by 6:15pm. Food tasted good so 4 stars!!! 

It was about 6:35pm, asked our server if our food was coming out soon, as we had instructed him to fire the order at the SAME TIME, so no reason for such a big time gap. Server said it was coming out soon, our food was coming up next. 

6:40pm.... 6:45pm rolls around we asked for a manager and gave Charles my card to pay the bill. Her name was Patricia, but nowhere to be found. We had two bartenders and our server get her. They all said she would be stopping by. 6:50pm rolls around, food comes out but we didn't not feel that we should be rushed to eat so we sent the food back and signed the check. 

Manager was still nowhere to be found. I previously checked out the Yelp Reviews, it looked like the primary customer complaint was regarding customer service, but still wanted to give this place a try.... Typical of big corporate companies, management doesn't care about customers. To MGM Food & Beverage management and directors.... someone is to blame for carelessness, Patricia didn't want to own up to what happened. 

Lastly, by the time we walked up the escalators to see the show, we were stopped by our server, as he had given us another customers credit card. 

I just checked my bank statement, I should've only been card for the Kettle Chip Nachos and Wings, but was charged the full $81.11. This is NOT what I signed for~ 

I see that from other Yelp reviews that MGM Guest Relations responds to all the reviews. However with what was demonstrated to us today, you have to wonder.... is this just another automated response? The concerns that are expressed and replies does not reflect the management and customer service that was shown to us tonight. Another thought which may be blatant but true... you confirmed to me that each customer that comes through your doors are probably nothing but a number. Complaints aren't taken seriously because you believe that another customer will always be there to fill a hotel room or a dining table.... but consider the number of people collectively over time that may not come back because of your lack of due diligence.",dA0QWjx56wIVbGaL_r52mQ,3,1,1,F--dZDoqFw8vRUWz3cxCTg

We only ended up having to pay tax and tip, so this entire meal cost us about $20. I can easily say this was the best $20 meal I've ever had, especially since a 20 spot doesn't get you much in Vegas. Our original bill was approximately $100, so had we not had the voucher, we probably would haven't ordered all of these items.

Appetizers
-Cheesesteak spring roll - LOVED and for sure my favorite part of the meal! I'm a huge sandwich lover, and this was a great new take on one of my favorite classic sandwiches. I would agree with other reviews in that it's more of an egg roll than a spring roll. Wish there was a different sauce. The ketchup didn't add anything to it in my opinion.
-Buffalo Shrimp: humongous pieces of shrimp in buffalo sauce. Pretty good, but of the two appetizers, I preferred the cheesesteak.

Entrees: 
-Filet mignon sliders. I went with the reviews and ordered them. In my opinion, they were over hyped and only decent. I didn't find them to be worth the $25 price tag had I been paying full price.
-Beer braised short ribs. These were the winner, winner, chicken dinner! So incredibly delicious and tender. They melted in your mouth

Drinks:
-Great beer list, with plenty of choices. Don't remember which one my other half ordered but he liked it.
-Berry Good Lemonade - Stoli blueberry, cranberry and lemonade. Got me feeling reaaaal good.

Our waitress was fantastic. I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a nice shout-out. Sometimes you feel really awkward handing them this piece of paper that screams ""I'm a cheap scumbag"" but she didn't treat us any different and was fabulous. I would come back here next time we're in town, but we wouldn't probably eat as much.

I was going to save this for one weekend during the NFL playoffs but the fridge was empty and it was Falcons vs Lions on Saturday so what the heck.  There were plenty of TV's and a decent place to see a game.  

First appetizer was the buffalo shrimp consisting of 4 breaded and fried pieces of shrimp with a good kick.  My wife loved this and I know we'll be back just for this dish.  I also got the cheesesteak egg rolls after inhaling multiple pieces of these after Misti's CMYE: Bodies event.  They were outstanding and as good as I remember although $3 a piece seemed kind of high.

Filet mignon sliders ($25) were really good.  We both expected just ""ground filet mignon"" but those babies were just straight pieces of tender, juicy filet nestled in between some tasty buns.  I was surprised how good the steak was for being much smaller than your average filet.  

Last and definitely least was the ""French Quarter Jambalaya"".  It was a boring sauce with dry chicken breast with the shrimp being the highlight.  I think a real Cajun/Creole place serving jambalaya would try this and break out in sheer laughter.  

I got the Goose Island Nero Belgium Ale ($12) which had to be north of 9% because I was feeling it after one.  My wife ordered the pomegranate martini ($13) which she said was fine.

You probably will have to get your own drinks, though, depending on where you're sitting. If you like playing the sports books, this would also be a good place to catch whatever game you're betting on and watch your fortunes wax and/or wane, as the case may be. Given that it is in that proximity to the floor, you could also go throw some coins in a machine during breaks after hitting the head as well. The best/worst part of being on the casino floor is saving on cigarettes while still getting that wonderful odor permeating your clothes and it's FREE! Also, it gets loud as Hell between that and the overheads, but loud is par the course in Vegas.

Service staff seemed mostly friendly, but a bit brusque and short (maybe they were mad because they all had to wear matching uniform sports jerseys). I get it; I couldn't do that gig, either, but the big difference is that I wouldn't attempt it. This sort of place, despite the curious art prints on the walls, is really going for sort of a sports pub/party thing and having a bunch of staff dragging down the mood is a bit of a sour note.

I had the pulled pork sandwich and we split some appetizer I don't remember, but anyway, all the food was very good.

Drink prices were typical strip prices. Beer menu lacked imagination and they didn't have a good selection of Hefeweizens or White Ales. 

Service was a bit slow as well. The first night I had to go to the bar to place an order because of no outside server, and the 2nd time there had to wait almost 10 minutes at the bar while the lone bartender tried to cash out accounts and work both bar areas. Understaffed doesn't help create good memories.

I ordered the 14 ounce ribeye steak it came with potatoes and asparagus. I ordered my steak medium rare which it came perfectly cooked in a matter of minutes which I was so thankful for because I was starving. I didn't really eat the potatoes although they were great i really just wanted to devour my 14 oz steak. Which i did in lady like fashion of about a few minutes hahahaha. T-Rex status meat chomping skills.

The waiter was awesome very attentive he kept coming to check on us.

My friend got the jambalaya and oh my goodness that was so delicious it was so flavorful a little spicy perfectly seasoned and just packed full of flavor. I am a steak person so I definitely saying a lot when I love a chicken, sausage and seafood dish. 

Everything in the restaurant was clean and it wasn't too loud in there there were a lot of TV's showing the baseball games. Which I loved. 

The only thing I did not like was the line to some kind of dance night club was right next to the restaurant and there was no separation, which I would have preferred considering the price. But it didn't really make a difference in the level of satisfaction. Also there was no restroom in the restaurant.  Which is standard according to the person I was with but that doesn't mean I have to like it. 

All in all I would come back here again it wasn't really overpriced compared to most restaurants in Vegas and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire dining experience.",pn3Gf1yva_dgWq5xrMol6g,3,1,4,v10qTFVwyk0ew6XlF7j4NQ

The meal started on a high note but unfortunately went somewhat downhill after that.  

Our appetizer of Town Dock Calamari with pickled cherry peppers and a Lemon Caper Aioli that featured really tasty and excellent strips of calamari arrived quickly after it was ordered.  But it took 15 minutes before any drinks arrived at our booth, and slightly over 30 minutes after we finished our starter before any ordered entrees were placed before us.  I also saw a couple that arrived after us receive their entrees first.   

A side of French Fries was very fine.  And, my five medallions of mushroom-covered Tavern Style Meatloaf with pan gravy was good, but I could have used more gravy, the Sweet Potato Mash was not that hot, and the English Peas did not look or taste fresh.  

Other than the long waits for drinks and food, service was good and very accommodating.  Peppers were delivered on the side as requested.  And, homemade Lemonade was good and tasty.  The first-rate appetizers served earlier in the lounge were also on the dinner menu, so, despite a few kinks to work out, this new restaurant shows good promise as a purveyor of memorable comfort food.

Well, where do I start? Our experience was horrible from beginning to end. 

Service was terrible. Okay, I understand MAYBE if you're waiting too many tables, so I am blaming mostly upper management for not scheduling more employees... But wow, I've never received bad service like this in Las Vegas in a LONG time (I am counting the semi higher-end restaurants). 

Everything was slow, slow, slow. The menu looked great, and I was anticipating a great meal. Great looking brunch items, too. I ordered the steak and eggs... I rarely order this anywhere because I don't trust anyone to make a decent steak unless it's for $$$. 

Well, wow. It wasn't pleasant. There was a tangy and tomato-like sauce that was plastered all over the steak. I scrapped as much as possible off of it. Eggs and hash browns were fine, but how in the world can you screw that up. The steak that we asked as medium rare was more like well done. My bf's steak was completely brown, while mine was SLIGHTLY pink. It was chewy, dry, and fatty. 

Service and food was so bad that we opted to speak to a manager. This rarely happens unless we feel the problem needs to be addressed. He was apologetic about the situation, so hence the 2 stars. 

I expected better, Public House. Never again.",1l8-c0409lKevE9RTVsRLA,1,0,2,_PnAGUtG9JWhaXVzfRoKrA

I got the Philly cheese steak sandwich and it was ok. Nothing spectacular but adequate. I think the menu selection is pretty limited and overpriced though. $20 bucks after tip for a sandwich and tip.

The good.    The fries are great. The sweet potato fries and dipping sauce is amazing and the ribs seem to be a must try.

We came here on a Friday evening after work and they had a bit of a wait. We were finally seated and our server was extremely attentive. We ordered some cocktails to start. I ordered the Sin City Sunrise and my fella ordered the pineapple martini. Both were pretty tasty. We started with the shortrib nachos and buffalo shrimp appetizers. They came out quickly and they were both had nice flavor. My favorite were the buffalo shrimp. They had a nice kick and the bleu cheese was flavorful. For $16 you only get four small fried shrimp, though. The nachos were nice. We both enjoyed the shortrib, but I disliked the queso dip. It had a weird texture, a little clumpy and it didn't have enough cheesy flavor for me. The potato chips were a nice touch. 

For entrees, I went with the filet mignon sliders and my fella got the steak frites. The sliders were great. They had full pieces of filet on a slider and they were pretty well-cooked. The meat was a little tough, but still had a nice flavor. The steak frites were disgusting. The meat texture was really grainy and the sauce that it was served with had the worst flavor. We kind of just pushed this dish to the side and shared my sliders since we already had so much food. 

Overall, we had a nice meal and I would be happy to try this place again with another coupon or maybe for Happy Hour.
