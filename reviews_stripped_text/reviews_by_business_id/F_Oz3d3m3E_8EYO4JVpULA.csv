I am a local so when family comes to Las Vegas to visit I always enjoy bringing them here for a nice meal and relaxing atmosphere. I gave my mother a 75th birthday party here on 
10-28-2017, upstairs in the private ballroom the food was delicious and more than enough for the 75 guests who attended. 

Thank you Rhythm Kitchen for excellent food with great prices.",47-uW9p79RGIceGP-wZxfA,0,0,5,Lx9_ZAMcWcOstAA34heryA
