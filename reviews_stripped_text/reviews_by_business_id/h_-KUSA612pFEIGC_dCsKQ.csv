The recent advertising flyer stated $1.99 to add a third taco. At the location, the same advertising said $2.49. When I asked, the manager on duty said ""the flyer is wrong, it is $2.49."" Not ""that's a mistake but we will honor the ad."" I said "" so this is false advertising"" and he replied ""yes it is"". I had to argue with him and point out that he was not taking care of his customers with that kind of attitude. It took 5 minutes of arguing (politely) but he finally said, ""You want that price, I can give you that price."" The amount wasn't an issue, it was the bad attitude that really irked me. He did actually just comp one whole meal so that was good on his part.
The gal at the counter was not happy to be there and it showed.
The food was below the usual standards and just not good. The floor was not clean. The salsa bar had old moldy tomatoes and peppers for garnish. (pic).

2103915,2016-01-04,2,h_-KUSA612pFEIGC_dCsKQ,"I gotta be honest, I was pleasantly surprised with this place. The food was actually really good and the salsa bar was stocked and very fresh! Fresh is a great word to describe Baja Fresh. Well for the items I had anyway. They have a fresh salsa bar, with 6 different salsas ranging from hot to mild, as well as jalapenos, limes and cilantro. I really enjoyed the mango salsa the best. It had bright, citrusy flavors that danced on my tongue. This was nothing like the jarred mango salsa you can find at the grocery store drowning in artificial flavorings and syrups. This was fresh made salsa and it was gooooood. The other salsa I liked was the baja salsa. It was a dark green and had a very good flavor. I stocked up on both of these.

I was in the mood for a burrito or tacos, but the grilled shrimp chile lime salad caught my eye. It's described on the menu as: fresh (there's that word again) salad greens and kale, pico, onion, bell pepper, jicama and tortilla strips, with fresh (and again) avocado and anejo cheese. All tossed in a chile lime dressing. This salad was amazing. The shrimp were grilled nicely, the veggies were crisp and that dressing was light and flavorful. That was a fresh (told ya) and filling salad. I also got a side of tortilla chips and small guacamole for only $2.99. I mostly got the chips to dip in the different salsas, but the guacamole was tasty. I can't say if I would come here for Mexican food, but I will certainly come back for that delicious fresh (haha) salad.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,5,4,3MtTClFKVblltzQoebJlPw
2572500,2011-06-01,0,h_-KUSA612pFEIGC_dCsKQ,Its located inside Boca Park which is convenient (shopping at Target can really work up an appetite) I brought my 7 year old here on a lunch date and I was pretty disappointed. The food is kind of just thrown on the plate and covered in tomatoes. My daughter even said she didn't like it and she loves Mexican food and tomatoes. The cashier was nice but the manager seems to need an attitude adjustment. For a salad and kids meal 14 bucks seems pretty steep considering its not that great. The only plus is shaded out door seating that my dog seems to enjoy. I wont be wasting my money here again and I suggest you don't either.,wrp6Ekew1ohFOBXG3t6zTA,0,0,2,LgRHUiVEMifug1i61xT2Lg

Well, it doesn't take too many visits to Baja Fresh to get to that point. Although they do offer a pretty good selection of ""Tex-Mex"" food, and some really good burritos, the food here is pretty much the same as most of the Mexican Grill style restaurants around town. The atmosphere is nice though, a couple flat screen TV's playing some sports games and authentic Mexican music by artists such as Enrique Iglesias. The prices are about the same as any other similar style restaurant with burritos at about 7 dollars and quesadillas for 8 or 9 dollars. A couple things that I do like about Baja Fresh is that they give you fresh tortilla chips with your order and they aren't stingy with their guacamole, unlike Qdoba.... There's also good seating here, indoor and outdoor. For me, this is more of a place I'll go to when I'm really hungry and in the area.",RxOFmw_i8O3kF4bTdjIAug,0,0,3,ZJIaR4u4kMkpRsbmoctYYA

Salsa's are very tasty and a full salsa bar is available to help yourself.

Buy a large size drink and come back with your cup for .99 refills.

Baja Burrito is good but they always overheat the tortilla so you get a crispy bite instead of a soft chewy bite.  Steak filling was a bit fatty-I don't think I'll be getting this one again.

4014596,2016-07-28,1,h_-KUSA612pFEIGC_dCsKQ,"Solid 3 1/2 stars!

I know Baja Fresh is definitely Tex-Mex but it's not so bad.  Of course it runs the gamut of other similar chains like Chipotle, Zaba's, and Rubio's.  All different, but all somehow the same.

One big plus of Baja Fresh is the tasty salsa bar!  Their salsa bar here is tops, salsa were are freshly made, the bar was clean, and there was quite a selection.  Besides their pico de gallo, their smoky, roasted salsa is pretty on point for me.  It goes with just about everything.  The mango salsa is another one of my favorites - sweet & spicy.

We eat with our eyes, and Baja Fresh definitely provides a lot of color in their food.  Our order looked bright & fresh!  Thankfully our items tasted as such:

-Baja Burrito with steak - melted Jack cheese, fresh guacamole & pico de gallo 
-Baja BBQ Chicken Salad - fresh greens with kale, onion, bell pepper, jicama, tortilla strips, roasted corn, black beans, tomatoes & topped with avocado, then tossed in a BBQ dressing

I had the Baja Burrito with the addition of romaine lettuce, it was big & hearty!  Heavy burrito stuffed with a good amount of steak & guacamole.  The pico was good too, and the burrito was made even more tasty with the addition of extra salsas - I tried a little of each!  Tortilla was warm and freshly made.

Wifey liked the Baja BBQ Chicken Salad, she opted for the dressing on the side.  It was used sparingly and gave the salad a sweet yet tangy kick.  She also liked adding some pico & jalapeno on her salad as well.

The great thing about Baja Fresh too is that with just about any main order, you get a bag of chips too!  Honestly, they make the salsa bar that much more fun.

We haven't visited a Baja Fresh in a while, and I forgot that with their large to-go plastic cups you only pay 99 cents for a soft drink refill on every visit.  I know at home we must have at least half a dozen of them!  I love making me some Coke with fresh lime, refreshing.

Keep an eye out in the mail for coupons at Baja Fresh too, they come quite often.  Our meal was a great deal, I think we used a $5 off $15 coupon.  Lunch came out to only $14 and change after the discount.  Value added!

I like this particular location at Boca Park, it's clean, crowded, and the employees are friendly.

4021151,2016-07-13,1,h_-KUSA612pFEIGC_dCsKQ,"It's OK. They seem fast and friendly. The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is due to the fact that all cooks left the kitchen at the same time while food was cooking on the stove. When one cook came back with gloves still on, not removed and than put a new pair on before touching food again, a female followed. Now I'm super nervous because they went to the back for awhile than a lady at the register put my order in a bag after a few words to the cook who finally came back. This is very unprofessional!! Never leave the kitchen!! Also the bathroom is dirty and disgusting. They don't clean it.

Today though, whoever is in charge of ordering for the kitchen has seriously fallen down on the job. 
Tried to order a steak and shrimp bowl. No steak. Ok ordered something else even though I was really looking forward to the steak. 
Then went to the salsa bar. My god everything was in a liquid state! I even asked what happened to the salsas. The response I got was ""we are out of gum"". WHAT???? So you're saying that the lack of actual mango and veg in the runny mango salsa is because of no gum? The smoky brown sauce is runny water because of no gum? The tomatio salsa is runny because of no gum? 
I thought Baja Fresh's motto is everything made fresh. Why on earth would there be any gum?

4260522,2018-04-06,2,h_-KUSA612pFEIGC_dCsKQ,"This review is for 4.5 stars.

Celebrated ""National Burrito Day"" (yesterday) here, used the promo- BOGO, the code was on my email which was scanned on my cell phone (TIP: get on their email club, you will get coupons). This location is situated in the Boca Park shopping center (facing Charleston), across from the popular area Target store.

We are so glad that this particular restaurant revived from the dead chain of restaurants (we went to the Excalibur location, but that is NOT the same- my food was ice cold, not fresh at all; prior to that, we went to the Flamingo/Maryland because that was the closest one to our old neighborhood, almost on a monthly basis). 

We had our choice of restaurants visit on this National day, but we came here first to eat inside the restaurant; there is outside seating as well, for customers only (ok, we visited another one, for To-Go, you caught us, well, I am pretty sure I did a 'check-in'). Clean tables. (We recognized the former manager from the old location we frequented.) Just a few customers, besides us, but by the time we left, there was a line to the front door. 

I've had a lot of items on the menu over the years (and back when I worked in the area, this is the one we would frequent), the fajitas are the bomb-diggity. I opted for the carnitas ultimo burrito (meat, cheese, grilled veggies, salsa, rice & sour cream), comes with chips, then you select your salsa at the bar (you can also opt for pickled jalapenos, peppercinos, lime slices)- aww, no more mango salsa, which was my favorite, to split with our son. It was a pretty good-sized burrito, I don't eat a whole one by myself, ever. Hubby's favorite is a burrito. He always gets them. Anyhoo, the flavor of the carnitas was on point, not salty, or fatty, either, for that matter. It was delicious, perfectly seasoned. You know when our picky son is ""Mum-mum""-ing, he really wants more (it is the only baby verbage that he uses, typically spoken at Chipotle, usually, a weekend visit). The only ingredient I didn't give him was the onions, like I said, he is picky.  

We will be back again.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,4,6S_2OCFQbUS9WplFWEo0dA

There is usually a coupon on the receipt that expires in 30 days. When I use it my meal only comes out to like $7.00. I also think their guacamole is the best out of all the fast food restaurant's also give you a good amount of chips and guacamole.  It's good for about 2 people with big appetites.

The salad was just romaine lettuce (not that shitty iceberg) with chopped tomatoes and tortilla strips. It was definitely not mindblowing but at the $1-2 range, I can't complain. My rice and beans plate was surprisingly large and in charge. However, the rice was bland but fluffy. The black beans (you can choose either black or pinto) are the real gem; they were cooked perfectly and topped with cotija crumble cheese. Baja offers a salsa bar and most of it is okay. Even the hottest sauce doesn't have that nice fire punch I was craving. The pico de gallo was unimpressive because the tomatoes were unfresh and mushy. But they have banana peppers and jalepenos. And a nice bonus: next door is a Starbucks so you can have a your caffeine midday fix, too! I know I'm judging a Mexican fastfood restaurant based on a salad and r&b plate, but hear me out, rice and beans are a simple staple, and sometimes simple is all I need.",Jk7sjPeIFcaGO3IJOOQ1Pg,0,0,3,0ungFulaCJxy_QVNlQsRsw

When the office manager called back to tell them that they messed up the order and that things were not ready on time like they were supposed to be the person she spoke to was really rude. After stating her complaint the employee's response was "" well what do you want me to do, maybe go to Chipotle next time, I have customers waiting."" SERIOUSLY!! Very rude, very inept. You would think that ordering online would remove a lot of error but it multiplied here. We printed out our emailed confirmation and receipt to see if we were wrong, but everything on there was completely correct so the problem was 100% on their end.  We will not be returning.",l10Uqdj-nzv-kovnG74Cdg,0,0,1,SAG-rcDEva1hzwaJmzCzwg

I loved how light, crispy and airy the shell was!  It had chese, sour cream, and guacamole on it.  It's a very nice size, enough to split it.  I also tried there nachos!  OMG, I love nachos.  And these were enough to share as well.    I It's my new favorite salad and some nachos",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,1,1,4,eUbj303cPkFWJKQeomYbFw

I was expecting less flavor from a fast food mexican joint, but their fajitas at least had some great flavor (at least with some the of their salsas on it). It was a bit loud in their and I'd probably go for Chipolte/Qdoba over them in the future but in a pinch I'd have no problem going to another Baja Fresh.",bKhfZoTppbT2cnnP38wiUw,0,0,3,TqrxrgME2pY8YLvfgea8hA

They're good. I think they use tons of chips and very little chicken.  They could lighten up a bit on that.  

One thing I did notice today was how dirty the floor was. I noticed because cleanliness is super important to me. 

When the restaurant is dirty you're mind tends to wander on the cleanliness if te kitchen and so forth.",oidojaIbfy67N63xP96baw,1,0,3,6MfOwn1J3aTR5mR4cezSIw

5610068,2017-02-01,0,h_-KUSA612pFEIGC_dCsKQ,"I just left this location and will never go back! First the chicken in the Veggie Bowl was burnt. Then I took it back and she told me it's because of the sauces they put on it. I still wanted new chicken so they took it back. They brought me a new bowl and the chicken was good but the rice in the bowl was crispy like it was not done and it was very clumpy! To top it all off, I saw one of the cooks dig in his nose for a while, then started taping the register and did not wash his hands or anything!! My daughter ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was good but the beans tasted a couple days old and the rice was crispy too! The fish tacos were the only thing I ordered that turned out okay. That is why I have 1 star! The worst $27 Ive spent in a long time! I had to write a review! Never again!",4YHQwdA9mFcdc-xolLoWOw,0,0,1,ExUmi5Gl249IWFzQjgQATQ

I ordered a Diablo Burrito with steak and added 9000 jalapenos to it. It was not super spicy which I was craving, but it was satisfying. I tried the mango salsa with the chips which were pretty good. All in all a decent option, but I wish I could find amazing authentic local Mexican food here in Vegas.",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,3,nFjbSwqkfJryKu-O2izBtg
5996271,2016-12-08,1,h_-KUSA612pFEIGC_dCsKQ,"The people who work here are extremely unprofessional. There's a reason why the place is always empty.

I've been here twice: once with my wife, and on the chicken nachos they put way too many beans and not much chicken at all.

The second time is what I'm more upset about. My wife put in an order through Paypal for two burritos, mine being the nacho burrito with NO VEGGIES. ETA to pick up was 10-30 minutes. I get there after 20 minutes and tell them that I'm there to pick up the order, and I'm met with confused faces. Serves me right for ordering in the afternoon and making the employees get off their phones! 

They go to a printer and see the order and tell me that it's going to be a few minutes. Fine, I brought a refill cup anyway. I went to get some lemonade for my wife and once again, the spout for both the Hi-C and lemonade are gunked up and there's no water coming out, only syrup. I tell the person at the front and she holds the button for a few seconds and water finally comes out. Really? 

I get my burritos and go home. Immediately I notice that there are jalapenos in it. Not terrible, but whatever. I opened the burrito to take it out and notice that the volume is almost all black beans, with NO chicken at all. Here's what is advertised with the burrito:

""It's Spicy! Fire-grilled all white meat chicken, Jack & cheddar cheese, vegetarian black & pinto beans, Baja rice, Smoky Queso Fundido, jalapenos, tortilla chips and Salsa Crema wrapped in a warm flour tortilla with your favorite protein.""

Let's go through the list: 

Fire grilled all white meat chicken: NOPE

Jack and Cheddar cheese: MINIMAL

Black and pinto beans: Almost all black beans, little pinto beans

Smoky Queso Fundito: NOPE

Jalepenos: YES when I didn't WANT ANY

Tortilla chips: Yes

Salsa Crema: NOPE

-----------------

Makes me curious if the people who work here are either stupid, incompetent, or just don't know what they're making. Either way, when I pay $7 for a burrito with CHICKEN IN IT I'd like to get some CHICKEN.

I don't know if they get their chicken from Cuba and there's an embargo or what, but this place ALWAYS skimps on chicken. It's baffling.",KQbr-p40xTdlwpkvgL-Kdg,0,0,1,FKLWnZXG85Z-VAfgGIsmOg
