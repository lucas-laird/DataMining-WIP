54369,2012-04-28,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"We very much enjoyed our dinner here but will echo what another writer said, which is that the meal goes very fast...almost too fast.  I wish they would leave another minute or two between the courses just to give folks an opportunity to truly appreciate all the fine favors of the dishes.  The chefs move so fast and announce the dishes so quickly, that some of the meal felt like a blur.  

The only other suggestion I would have would be for them to do a bit more of the preparation in front of the diners instead of just the plating.  Some of the various processes they talked about sounded really interesting, but we didn't get to see that aspect of the preparation, which was a bit disappointing.  I expected that they would be cooking in front of us, not just preparing the final products.  

Other than that, the food was spectacular and the service was outstanding.  When we asked questions about the various dishes, the chefs were more than willing to explain how the dishes were made.  I wish they gave more explanation up front, but I guess some diners are more interesting in the process than others and the chefs are just trying to keep everyone happy. 

Unfortunately, we had some real duds at our dinner - four guys who managed to be late for dinner and then showed about zero interest in the meal.  I couldn't believe how rude these guys were, especially given the cost of the meal.  But the chefs were gracious and didn't seem to mind all that much.

All in all we had a wonderful dinner and definitely recommend the experience.",ZntfzUqjiCNozj-5SyVnkg,3,0,4,kTTv0f65-YYp85JRP6jSDA

This is dinner theater at it's best. It's a 2.5+ hour interactive show in a private room located within Jaleo. After checking in at the hostess stand we were seated at a table in Jaleo and brought complimentary glasses of cava while the previous seating finished. When ready, we were escorted to the back and entered a space beautifully designed by the Rockwell Group and Spanish designer Juli Capella. Two of the walls are lined with card catalogs with several drawers open and holding artifacts that tie into memories from José's past. It's an intriguing space that's equal parts Dali, Pan's Labyrinth, and Alice In Wonderland.

In the center of the room is an 8 seat bar where the chefs create and plate the evening's meal. Much of the actual ""cooking"" is performed out of site in the Jaleo kitchen but the plating is done in front of the diners at the bar. Throughout the evening there was plenty of interaction with the chef's and we were encouraged to ask questions and learn more about the chefs and dishes. It was cool to see them at work.",9KKXXXePl6Ci4TZQRIpR7g,0,0,5,ewmH-WGM2hyrvg5auUbKfg

There were a couple of standout dishes.  Im glad I said I did it.  They need to change their silly reservation system and need to eliminate a couple of dishes to provide more substance to the meat and fish courses and make the experience less rushed.

I'm not going over the food, there are too many people here who have done the food much better justice with pictures to boot.  I just have a bone to pick with anyone who rates this place less than 5 stars for any reason.  You dine here for $250 per person.  The price includes all the described courses of food, accompanying wines, tip, and tax.  If you can find an experience anywhere in the world that comes close in inventiveness, attention to detail in food and service, and sheer volume of food and drink, I'd love to hear it.  Because it's fictional.  There is nothing in the states or overseas that even comes close. Taste is subjective, and each of us may find a fault through difference of individual taste.  I'm a chef from Phoenix, and I feel privileged to have a place this good within a short drive.  If you've dined at E, you've had an experience as close to perfect as I can even define.  I used to dine at Bar Charlie while it was still open, and I've dropped over a grand there for dinner for two without hesitation.

92597,2014-02-04,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"Worst dinning experience I have had of that caliber. We went there three of us here late on a Friday night for our pre-party grub. 

Our waiter, which I'm glad I had forgotten his name already, had the worst attitude. We asked him to suggest items on the menu and he was pressuring to order items he suggested standing over the table, and wouldn't leave until we asked for a couple of minutes. 

The kitchen was out of most items, granted it was a late dinner, but the waiter made an offhand remark about us coming late, and came after we were served to tell us that the item we asked about on the menu had come back to life. 

The food came dry, not at all fresh, and clearly left for at least an hour after it's even made. The tapas were overpriced and the sizes were small even for tapas. 

Most overrated, perhaps the only redeeming factor to this place, which got us in there in the first place is its decorative interior, but don't be fooled, it's got nothing to live up to it.",pLtZ9ns0vTsIwXEHojKeOQ,0,0,1,UFRHD-yipOvkoAbxkMP_jw
135476,2014-07-23,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"E was a nice experience, but not without its drawbacks. There are only 8 seats, but the room is decorated with Jose's touches and it has a warm inviting feel for the dinner. The experience would be ideal if 8 of your friends or family could attend the seating (one at 5:30 and another at 8:30).  We had a nice experience nonetheless with the patrons we were with, although I could see it being awkward with loud voices or people who come in already sauced. DO get one of the gin and tonic drinks! Expensive but worth it. 
 
Word of warning for people who are coming to E for Spanish cooking that is done live in front of you. There is really nothing cooked before you. The chefs that are with you are essentially plating the food that comes from the kitchen. They do a nice job of explaining the dishes and ingredients which strive to be Spanish based although items like the cotton candy, foie gras, and corn nut empanada wasn't particularly Spanish to me. Nor the bone in rib eye at the end of the meal which was good, but a better rib eye at Delmonico's or any of the vast steak houses in Vegas probably would have been better. The chefs are friendly and do encourage questions which makes for good conversation if your group engages with them. 
 
The food was presented with flourish and executed well. Techniques like using a portable smoker for the oyster course and the edible sangria at the beginning of the service was well done. Overall the courses were small; e.g.  the cracker with the anchovy and other spreads.  It was well made and quite tasty but was still essentially a small cracker and considered a course. And while I expect that high end dinners that have many courses don't serve portions more than a few bites, this was the first time we have been to a dinner such as this that we actually could have used more food. Even a bread service might have helped in the hunger dept. They do offer wine pairings for this dinner which were solid. The wines were great and paired well with the food. They were also wines that one can't typically find and the server (Brian) was very knowledgeable. Unfortunately, we were the only two who had the wine parings which made it hard to interact with the others about the parings with the food. 
 
Bottom line, the experience was worth it, but probably not worth the amount of money paid. Don't come to E to experience true Spanish cuisine or expect to learn a tremendous amount about Spanish ingredients. It's more flash and meal execution/preparation than anything which again was really nice, but I think I would have rather had the wood fired Paella's that were being made as you walked into the special dining room. The wife and I got a really nice experience sitting at the main bar in the restaurant watching the paella's being made over the wood fire, interacting with the bar staff and seeing all of the nice tapas coming out of the kitchen after our E experience was over.

202696,2014-02-07,5,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"I lived in DC for 13 years, and dined at Jaleo many times. I discovered é during a trip to Vegas in May, but it was too late for reservations. I had planned a birthday weekend in Vegas with 2 friends, one who was also celebrating her birthday, and another who loves Jaleo and Mini Bar. 

Reservations and allergies/requests are all done by email, but I specifically asked how I could pay the check before it was dropped. I was told by email there were many opportunities to give it to our wait staff in person -- that is 100% true. Everyone is in the same room, your wait staff almost never leave that room, so even if you leave to use the rest room you won't run into them. 

We were asked to arrive early (5pm for the 5:30pm show), which we did, and they weren't quite sure what to do with us initially. They seated us, our waiter explained the drink menu and pairing to us, after a while brought us water, and we kind of sat there before being brought in. I understand not wanting to bring us right back, but for following their instructions to the letter, it was awkward and haphazard. 

Others have reviewed the menu in great detail, and no doubt the ingredients are top notch, the recipes are well thought out, and a lot care goes into the preparation and plating (which is done in front of you). 

Since this was my idea, and I'm a big Jose Andrews fan, I really wanted this to be a five-star experience, however:
 * Our drink orders did not arrive until after the opening cocktail. Personally, I would not use mescal as an apéritif, but that's why it's not called ""John"" by Jose Andres. I tried several sips of it, but I find smokiness of mescal clobbers my pallet. Because I had not finished it, our drink order did not come for some time though the other party got theirs. After 5 courses, I asked the waitress to remove it. 
 * This is a 18-22 course tasting (the menu is adjusted frequently), and I would never expect to finish every bite of every dish. Each time I opted not to finish something, I got a comment or side eye from a staff member.
 * For me, it was too much molecular gastronomy. A little is awesome, a lot is cute, I would guess even Wylie Dufresne would have cried uncle. Foams (and more foams), gels, emulsions, suspensions in nearly every dish was not what I expected
 * By the 5th course, my pallet was overloaded with salt, and I was really trying to figure out how to power forward. I was drinking tons of water, trying everything outside my comfort zone, and when the next salt-tasm was put before me I struggled. By the 7th course, one of the sous called me out in front of my group and the other group of 5 that joined us, which made me incredibly uncomfortable. We turned it into a discussion about the saltiness of spanish food, and she agreed that when she started she was over-salting everything.
 * As I said above, we ended up arguing about the check, which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. Just because it was my birthday, I was not sticking my friends with a $300 per person check when I picked and I wasn't 100% satisfied. 
 * The gratuity for the wait staff is included no matter how small your party is, but you can tip extra for the kitchen staff at your discretion. This put me in a tough spot because I probably would not have tipped the full 20% to the staff because they made me uncomfortable so many times during my birthday dinner, but I did want to take care of the kitchen staff. 

There were many, many high points to the meal. Great ingredients, outstanding preparation. Even with 2 cups of rosemary foam, the sous vide lamb was incredible. The sangria gel shooter (think jello shot) was awesome. The merienda was adorable. Their play on ham and bean soup was tasty. The deconstructed catalan cream desert with an egg on top, that looked like an egg, was a savory pallet-fucker. 

I'm so very glad I did it, but I won't do it again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that wasn't specifically looking for molecular gastronomy + salt + spanish food + more salt. I'll stick to Jaleo proper or Mini Bar when I'm in DC and call it good.",1d818jZbfXFkxAFNVDP9_Q,17,3,3,GsEba2E1g6E2MqvoUz4ZZQ

Tucked in an intimate side room with dishes prepared and plated in front of you, this experience is educational, fun, and tasty!

Most dishes are delicious, and the presentation and creativity are top notch. It takes all the fun from a place like Bazaar, and ups it a bajillion-fold. 

It's hard to give specifics since the menu changes every few months, but rest assured there is only happiness in this place (until the check comes)

I know a common complaint about Bazaar was that not all of Jose's dishes actually taste good. My experience with e' in the two times I went was that most of the dishes taste very good, so....I'd recommend giving it a try if that was your complaint with Bazaar",nuc7NIsBM1UkI6AVpOM8nQ,0,0,5,OQX1YahoSD0LqLMsHYIQ9w
282151,2013-11-17,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"This is not a dining experience. It's dinner and a show. 

My companion and I arrived at 5 for our 5:30 seating. We were given a spot at the Jaleo bar while we wait for the rest of the diners to arrive. We were given a good overview of the drink choices and made to feel very welcome.

It's critical to realize that your experience at é is in a very big way, outside the control of the restaurant. You will be seated with others that you may not know, and you will sit at a communal table. If they aren't such great conversationalists, your experience will suffer. If they are delightful, your experience will be enhanced.

As others have noted, you cannot call and make a reservation. You have to send an email and hope for a reply. Depending on the day, this may take some time.

Fortunately, I was with a good group and we had a nice time with cocktails before we headed back to our dinner.

Clearly, Chef Andrés enjoys a bit of whimsy. The decor is fun and a bit strange. But the food is all business.

Here was the bill of fare: Rebujito, Apple ""Brazo de Gitano"", Nitro Almond Cup, Barquillo, ""El Vermut"", ""Merienda"", Crispy Chicken Skin en Escabeche, Cava Sangria, ""Fabes"" con jamón, Lobster with Citrus & Jasmine, ""Kokotxas"" al Pil--Pil, Whole Lobe of Foie Gras Baked in Salt, Secreto of Ibérico Pork with Squid, Torta Pascualete with Cotton Candy, Créma Catalana Egg, Pan con Chocolate, Yemita, 25 Second Bizcocho, and finally ""More Things"".

Everything is prepared in an exacting manner, and finished right in front of you. The chefs seemed to enjoy answering questions along the way and interacting with the guests. 

All of the dishes were stunning and interesting, even if one or two didn't appeal to me personally. 

This being served in the style of tapas, you only get a few bites of each plate. And while the service was excellent, they do keep up a high pace of service. Under no circumstances should you eat here for a leisurely experience.

Reasons to eat here?
- It's an unforgettable experience.
- The food is spectacular.
- The service is excellent.

Reasons you may not like it?
- Your other table guests are a crapshoot.
- The pace of food service is quick. 
-  Reservation process could be troublesome.

Additionally, the wine selection is excellent. (Spanish mostly, of course)

We got to Jaleo 15 minutes before our reservation, as requested, and ended up waiting another half hour to be taken into the ""restaurant"".  Some other reviewers have mentioned getting a glass of champagne when they show up, we were never offered any.  No worries though, watching everything going on in Jaleo is entertaining enough.  Ended up being because someone else didn't make it; sucks for them.

Some have mentioned that pricing is rather ambiguous, however, we didn't find this to be the case at all.  While we were waiting, Patrick, our server for the evening, explained everything well, gave us the ipad drink list, explained the wine pairings, etc.  I did the Taste of Spain pairing, which was good for the most part, but I found a couple of the pairings odd.  Not sure if it was worth the $130 or not.

The only real gripe we had, and it is a pretty big one, was that the servers made a point of telling us that the Chefs were included in the automatic gratuity, and that we were welcome to leave extra ""if we desired.""  I'm sorry, but that's tacky.  I own a restaurant, and if I heard one of my servers doing this I'd flip.  There's no need for that in a restaurant of this caliber.

When we were told we had the reservation a few days later we immediately sent in the confirmation form with credit card info.  All was set. Then on January 21st we received an email saying that our dinner reservation happens to fall on ""Valentine's Weekend"" so they are going to charge an additional $100 per person. And were we okay with that? So to recap: we followed their rules, made the reservation and then they decided to just change the rules. We're not naive--they will of course easily fill the spot at the new price ($250 per person before the $155 per person wine service.) so essentially they don't have to care whether we say yes or no. There's a line long of folks eager to take our place.

But that doesn't make it okay.  It is unconscionable to treat people like this.  I realize this is Vegas and money is all that talks.

Not to worry guys, it came in the mail just in time and you bet I flaunted that shiny piece of paper around singing ""I've got a golden ticket"" to all my roommates, except this time its not to the chocolate factory, its to somewhere hopefully better.

Fast forward to my arrival in Vegas, after all day of walking on the strip I make my way over to Jaleo inside the Cosmo and they sat me at a table with other fellow diners. We all got some cocktails as the waiter/host explained some things to us on the menu and we all got to know each other a little bit. One of the couples I dined with came all the way from Australia, and I thought Virginia was far...! Some of the options offered were alcohol packages  which I believe were around $100 starting which I decided not to opt for since I was going out in town later and wanted to pace myself. Another option was to have shaved truffle on some of the dishes for an mere...$50, yea I'll skip that and save it for gambling. We went on back into a room and my culinary adventure began...

The room was tiny, and filled with all sorts of knick knacks and odd items but the most prominent thing that stood out was that the walls were lined with mini old school mail boxes and after the head chef explained that this room was supposed to mimic Jose's mind, things started to make sense. From there on we were introducing our palates to the first of many bites and I'll try to sum up the ones that really stood out to me if I can remember their names. 

Branch of the dessert: this looked like a table piece but what it really was, was kalamata olives liquified and shaped into branch type fixtures that were crunchy.

Iberico chickpeas: This looked like a soup but the white, heavy liquid was melted iberico fat and it was accompanied by chickpeas and other goodies.

Beet gazpacho: Think like an ice cream sandwich, but instead of the chocolate buns you have a thicker, almost cardboard consistency outer layer, and inside had a cold paste which felt like and resembled sherbet ice cream BUT everything in here is made entirely of beets and has a beet flavor.

Cheese and Nuts: Really do not know how to describe this one, there was a tiny ball of cheese that had a hard outer shell with tangy sharp white cheese inside and a small spoon of soft nuts. We were told to take a bite of the cheese, eat the nuts, and finish off the cheese bite..at this point you start realizing that some dishes have special directions. 

Cava Sangria: Why order wine when you can have it spherified and placed on a large spoon to have it explode in your mouth? Very soothing and refreshing...drink? 

Live scallops with black truffle: Fresh scallop made to look like kind of how beef tartare is presented to you or a crab cake and topped with all sorts of truffle goodies. 

Chuleta: My favorite dish, the wagyu beef cooked to perfection with a small but filling side of mashed potato gnocchi. This was one dish I throroughly savoured bite for bite. My fellow diners next to me even offered to give me some of their shaved truffle to top mine just because they wanted me to try the amazingness of it all....score!

Empanada: Think pierogi, except made with cotton candy instead of dough, but the cotton candy has no flavor, and stuffed with a cold, buttery, crunchy, popcorn tasting stuffing. Very interesting. 

There were many other dishes during my stay but all in all this was a truly remarkable experience for my taste buds and mind.

Three chefs which finish the courses in front of you and two attentive yet warm welcoming servers. Lots of foams, spheres, sands, and liquid nitrogen fueled by molecular gastronomy.

I appreciate the science behind the food but I found some courses to be unnecessary focused on the flash rather than the food. For example, there was one course where they turned foie gras and truffles into sand. Sand. I understood the concept and enjoyed the juxtaposition of the cold sand with the hot consume but no -- give me that piece of duck liver as is; there are some things which are enjoyable in its purest form.

There were other courses which flavors brought me back to my childhood. There was a 'ham and cheese' bun which reminded me of a cheesy bread I had as a kid everyday. There was also a cotton candy empanada with a salty and crunchy corn filling, which reminded me of what my dad ate while drinking with his buddies.

I was not disappointed.

The way the chefs transformed textures and forms the food comes in was absolutely mind blowing.  Most folks who have reviewed the place has probably written pages upon pages on this, but some of the coolest dishes:

-fabes con jamon - your brain thinks beans should chew a certain way; but once you bite into one of these guys, oh man.  the creamy bean soup that pops into your mouth, mixed with the bacon broth, takes you to flavor heaven.
-cava sangria - cava in a sphere?  what?  even though it takes less than a second to eat, your brain will take a few minutes to register.
-the olives in ""el vermut"".  reconstituted olive juice reconstructed into little boba balls.  packed full of flavor and great accompaniment to the raw mussels.
-barquillo - who would have thought a cream filling made from anchovies and truffles would be so delicious?  wrapped in a paper-thin egg roll wrap, it's crunchy deliciousness in two short bites.

Flavors are all very well balanced and dishes are immaculate upon serving.  The service was also very good - lots of fun interacting with both the chefs, the assistants, and fellow dining companions.  In fact, that's probably most of the fun, was discussing the food and wine with the entire room.  Never really had a dining experience quite like this.

I have two gripes with the dinner though.  Portions are tiny.  I understand it's tapas style and 20 courses over 2 hours so most folks probably would be ok.  But up the size on two dishes say, the iberico pork with squid or lobster, and I would have had a much more ""filling"" dinner.  The next one is really a personal gripe, and most folks won't agree with me.  But the sizing on the wine pairing was insane.  I had 11 glasses of alcohol from start to finish - was insanely wasted by the time the last few courses rolled around.  Maybe I'm just a light weight. :)

Service was excellent. The stars were our hostess and the lead chef. They had such warm personalities and made us feel very welcome. Our meal was presented with explanations of each dish and beverage. You can tell that the staff takes pride in their work and the food. I enjoyed watching each dish being prepared because the chefs are so artful in designing some of the more complicated plates.

One person in our group had major food allergies/intolerances (seafood and various fruits) and had a self-proclaimed unrefined palate. I was pretty worried that he wouldn't enjoy the meal but I think he loved it more than I did! There were a few substitutions made for his meal which still tasted excellent.

Before I ate here, I wasn't sure if 22 courses/bites was a lot or a little. There were mixed opinions online, so just in case, I ate most of what was on each plate for the first few courses. Halfway through, I was already full. To give you an idea of my maximum stomach capacity, it's about the size of a Chipotle burrito bowl (or Barbarito's or Moe's Southwest if you don't have Chipotle near you or know what it is). I was able to finish the rest of the meal but I definitely had food coma afterward. It is a LOT of food. Especially desserts. There are a ton of desserts. Mmmmmm...

My favorite dishes: beet jewelry, gypsy arm, gin and tonic apéritif, chicken oyster, uni mini sandwich, watermelon sangria bite, Freddy Giradet dessert, and fizzy paper.

The drinks were excellent too. I got to try both the alcoholic and non alcoholic pairings. Hands down, the non alcoholic pairings are better, and more memorable (not to mention less expensive). My favorites were the cucumber and beet (?) drink and citrus juice with ""beer froth"" on top.

Definitely one of the most memorable experiences in Vegas.",-6JgeM8-adaxpM_Mtr_ovw,1,1,5,99_Q9C45I4V4tlgXeWTy6g

This is a pricy tasting menu at $250 a person and can twice as expensive with the premium wine pairing.

Of the 23 course we had there were 3 or 4 that really stood out as delicious and would gladly have again.  The rest were good just more towards the unique in their presentation and the science of how it was prepared and consumed and the aesthetics.  This was worth the experience but not something you would do every time you want an excellent dinning experience.

Long story short, I would not hesitate to dine here again on my next trip to Las Vegas. The food is delicious, adventurous, and the service impeccable, especially from Kathleen, who was there both times that I have visited.

There were a total of 9 customers on the night that I visited, all of them very experienced foodie-types who had been to many of José Andrés' restaurants in Washington, DC, to Thomas Keller''s French Laundry in the Napa Valley, and to this restaurant and to that restaurant in this city and in that city, etc. Me, I was diner #9, the least traveled diner there, but I still felt comfortable sitting with these so-much-more experienced diners, who were all very friendly and engaging. That was the the most interesting part of the night: how engaged the chefs were with the customers and the customers with themselves. It was like we all knew we were experiencing something special and were happy to all be experiencing it together.

Food: creative that stimulates your senses. Difficult to describe as the picture does no justice. Seasonal menu. Foodie world techniques in preparation. 

Ambiance- located in Boulevard Tower, 3rd floor in Jaleo restaurant. Private 9 seat bar in back,  very intimate. 

Service- 4 chefs, 2 servers and support staff. Can't complain about ratio to customer to service. They request you arrive 15 min early, seat you a bit after 8:30 then 2 hour food service/ show starts. Chefs are friendly and answers all our questions. 

Value- slightly more expensive/on par with other tasting menus around the world. My 4 star is for this reason, for the price, no drinks yet, timing could have been a little longer.

I wish I could talk more about the food, which was excellent in itself, but the flavors and techniques that were so painstakenly executed by the staff of sycophantic Jose-worshippers were over-shadowed by the sheer pomp of the whole production. The guy sitting next to us that obviously worked at the hotel was clearly there as filler, which is fine- I am all for educating and rewarding the people that are selling your product, but instructing him not to speak was mistake. His submissive energy killed the convival atmosphere that is typically associated with a unique and intimate dining experience with strangers. I expect he was busy taking mental notes for his required Yelp review. 

Overall, the ""Dining Event Experience"" felt like we were on the set of an Almodovar film that was being catered by a Food Network reality show. Somewhere between the writing of the script by the obviously talented Jose Andres, one of the Producers (probably the one with the money) lost the plot.

The Paella at Jaleo, the restaurant for normal people, looked amazing. Next time, I will spend $200 at Jaleo and donate the rest to a food charity.",A7g9ze95__R0NlrcMdHIng,1,0,3,Vp7wy3KE__ig-ShTPWMgYg

The wait staff was very attentive and gave alot of recommendations.  They suggested that each person order 3-4 items from the menu as they tend to be rather small.  I ordered the Salmon with caudiflower and rasberries, Cavier with egg, Codfish with honey alioli, and wild mushrooms with olive oil.  The best dish out of the four was the salmon.  I was cooked to perfection along with the caudiflower and rasberries.  It was a very tasty dish.  The next best entree out of the four was the codfish with honey alioli.  Codfish was deep fried and in a ball (about 6 of them) and the honey alioli dipping sauce was superb.  What made me bring down the restaurant's rating were the last two dishes.  The Cavier with egg did not have as much flavor as I had hoped and was rather bland.  The mushrooms with olive oil also did not have much of an exuberant taste to it.  I should have stucked more to the fish dishes since they were excellent.

From 20 something dishes, maybe 5 were very good. Most of them average.. Some too salty... or bland.. or undercooked...just nothing special, which makes me think about how people would rate the food if it was served at a random place (like a food court or food truck or something).

After my experience at é, the concept I have now is a big mixture of flavors from all the dishes being served so fast and didn't connect. 

So, for the food - I would not recommend, specially for $250 p/p. 

If you want the experience - I have mixed feelings. You should go just out of curiosity, if you consider an ""experience"" watching 2 people use tweezers to plate your food. Because they don't cook in front of you, they just plate. The chef is not creating, he's just performing, but more like a robot.

The worst part is the pace.. Too rushed and on a schedule. I eat slower than most people and servers were literally looking over to see when I finished my dish (because I was always the last one) to start taking the plates away. I could feel their eyes on me!

- if you don't have an allergy then eat everything. Even things you normally don't like you need to eat because I am pretty damn sure you'll like it here.
- talk to the chefs! They enjoy it.

We were both on Cloud 9 and ready to celebrate! I was excited and from what he told me, thought this would be one of the best dining experiences of my life. I would like to start by saying that we were told to arrive at 5:30 sharp. I rushed myself out the hotel room so that I could arrive on time only to SIT & WAIT 30 minutes while a few folks ordered cocktails. I'm not a fan of being told to arrive somewhere sharp and then wait around with nothing to do or eat. We were starving. 

Now onto the important part...the food. Everything was presented beautifully. They get an A for presentation & creativity but an F for taste and implementation. I love soup and appreciate all kinds of soup. One of the courses was a small portion of soup that tasted like hot bacon grease out of a skillet. Another less impressive course was a piece of fish that was the saltiest fish I have ever tasted in my life. I drank a lot of water at the table because many of the dishes were salty & rich. 

A little over half way through, my stomach took a turn for the worse. I had to run to the bathroom which by the way is not located anywhere inside or close to the restaurant. If the bathroom had been any further, they would have gotten a bill the following day for dry cleaning my dress. Ten minutes later, I returned to the table very embarrassed and everyone was starting on dessert. The piece of chocolate that was just served looked amazing but I was forced to run to the bathroom a second time before I could even try it! My fiance closed out the tab and came out to get me. We went back to our room and Thank God it was in the Cosmo because I still wasn't finished with the bathroom business. He felt terrible it was not a good experience for me and I felt terrible he paid so much for it. I'm sure we will be back because we are regulars at The Cosmo.

Some of the stand out dishes:

Chicken oysters on chicken rind - I've never had chicken oysters but this has turned me into a HUGE fan of them. I would have to say this was probably top 3

Citrus lobster - cooked perfectly and the air (not foam, as the chefs can explain if you like) was absolutely delicious. I was scraping at my plate to get every last drop of flavor off of there.

Pork with squid and parsley air - The squid actually complemented the pork really well the air gave just a light touch of parsley flavor

Rosemary wild mushrooms - At first I was confused as to whether we could eat the bag, but don't. They'll cut it open for you so that you can drink up that delicious broth. If I could get this broth, I would cook everything in it. I would even just drink it as a plain soup. 

All of the desserts were just top notch and so creative! Never would have expected a lemon fizzy paper! When it touches your tongue, it almost feels as how pop rocks feel which was pretty cool.

I could go on and on about all of the dishes, but Nelson Q. has already done an amazing job describing each dish.

I will say that there were some dishes I wasn't a huge fan of, but everyone has different tastes. You are bound to love at least 1/3 of the dishes and the staff is extremely accommodating to any food allergies, etc.

I recommend getting the drink pairings, both alcoholic and non alcoholic. I thought they were a nice finishing touch to each little morsel and one of the wines was just so much fun to drink! Who would have thought of pouring wine out of a strangely shaped flask directly into the mouth would be so tasty? Definitely not for the clumsy though.

Even if the don't find yourself loving the food, this place is well worth the experience. If you're making a reservation for this place, you probably already know it will make a dent in your wallet.

You can see the video version of my review here: http://bit.ly/2quA6Wy

This restaurant is located in a hidden room within Jaleo, so be sure to check in with the hostess as soon as you arrive. You'll be seated and brought a cocktail menu as well as a starting appetizer. If you are getting a wine pairing, I recommend not getting a cocktail as there will be plenty to drink later on. 

We had a dish of edible violas and peppers on a baked rice stick (embedded in cocoa nibs) - this tasted pretty bland (like rice crackers). Once we were brought into the actual restaurant, however, the fireworks began!

The dining space is extremely intimate and quaint, with seats for 8 diners and a serving area in front of you. The chefs will plate the food in front of your hungry faces which was extremely fun!

A warm towel filled with Mediterranean herbs (placed upon a white, beckoning hand) welcomed us to the start of our culinary journey. Throughout the 21 course meal, we were brought to various regions of Spain (Basque was especially represented) and traditional Spanish cooking techniques were brought into the 21st century with technological proficiency and precision. 

I won't go into the details of the all the dishes, but they were all amazing to look at, well balanced in terms of flavors and conceptually creative without going overboard. I would say it doesn't the insane ""wow factor"" of something like Alinea, but the food actually tasted better in a blind tasting test. The wine pairing was excellent and they were extremely generous with the pours (double/triple pours of the same wine appeared to be encouraged). I would recommend splitting the pairing if you are in a group as you will quickly get intoxicated as some of the dishes are also alcoholic. 

Highly, highly recommended and would return!

1391733,2013-06-23,4,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"Dear é,
 I love you!

How to:  é  is, as stated by other yelpers, a restaurant within Jaleo at The Cosmo hotel.  Reservations must be made, via email request, a month ahead.  There are two ""showings"" a night, five nights a week, with 8 diners per ""show.""  I feel special!  About a week before your reservation, you receive your GOLDEN TICKETS a la Willy Wonka in the mail.  Such a fun and whimsical touch, that truly did build my anticipation for the dinner.  I couldn't wait to show my ticket to all of my friends who didn't care what I was raving about at all, haha.  So you arrive to Jaleo and present your ticket, then review beverage pairing options before entering the hidden room to dine.

Service & Atmosphere:  Atmosphere so comfortable and unassuming.  The secret room was sort of like being inside Jose Andres mind.  Have I mentioned whimsical yet?  We had a maitre d, one lead chef and her team of three chefs, and I believe two waitresses.... for the eight of us.  Needless to say, I never had a need that was left unmet.  My water glass never half empty and my wine glass always refilled.  My questions answered before I could even direct them towards anyone.  The lead chef was adorable and personable, joking with us and being an amazing hostess.  It's so obvious that every employee was passionate about their work.  The story that accompanied each dish definitely is one of the aspects that makes the meal stand out to me.  By the end of the two hour meal, I was torn- I couldn't possibly fit another bite of food in my stomach but I was so sad to have the experience end.  The service was amazing, the fellow diners were amazing, and the food was obviously exceptional.

FOOD:  Touched on every sense.  The textures, the smells, the presentation, the taste and the background stories for each dish were just so perfect.  23 courses, including certain beverage courses like the kava caviar sangria... sort of the fanciest most amazing jello shot I've ever had.  How will I ever eat again, if it isn't a dish from e?  I don't think I can manage real food anymore haha.  The food was explained as Spanish Avant Garde Tapas; Jose Andres took Spanish comfort food and memories and experiences and transformed them with molecular gastronomy and innovation.  Half of the fun was receiving your dish, trying to guess what it was going to taste like... and being completely (delightfully) wrong.  The chefs are so meticulous, it's amazing to watch and even more amazing to taste.  Some of the food was so pretty I almost didn't want to ruin it by eating it.  You must get the beverage pairing, by the way; it elevated the meal.

I won't go over all 23 courses (they do change from time to time, by the way) but some notable were the:
**Marienda--- it looked like the simplest of all dishes, a grilled cheese sandwich I mean really?  But I took a bite and just wow... So the ""Marienda"" is a play on a sandwich that kids will receive in Spain as an afterschool snack, generally cheese and ham.  The bread was steamed brioche bun, so fluffy the best brioche I'd ever had and the only time I've experienced it steamed.  The ham was iberico, the best ham in the world!  Truly.  And some sort of Spanish goat cheese.  For a dish that looked so unassuming, the flavors popped.  I wanted to order a whole box of these just to take home!  
**Spanish tapas experience all in one.  The idea is that you walk into a bar, you have a cocktail with some olives.  You maybe get some seafood to snack on.  The dish was mussels with liquid olives and orange air.  I'm not even a fan of mussels, at all, but wow it all just made so much sense together.  Liquid olives by the way, are very tasty.
**Fried chicken skin, topped with chicken oyster and thyme air.  The most essential taste of chicken I've ever had, so tasty.
**Other tastes: Chocolate paper with dried strawberries, saffron cream, caramelized baguette, iberico broth, squid ink, cod collar, rare skinless creamy Spanish beans, pork & squid ala plancha, truffle & anchovy cookie interpretation, apple merengue, blue cheese cream, almond 3 ways : puree almond shell, almond milk whip cream, almond dust and caviar, lobster with citrus and jasmine air, salt roasted foie

Exceptional dining experience, I highly recommend.

We were running 10 minutes late so we called to let them know and the person on the phone had trouble finding our reservation. If you're in this boat make sure you say your reservation is for ""é"" as this experience is in the back of the restaurant ""Jaleo"" and the number for both places is the same one.

Once there, they sat us with 4 other nice couples, who were all obviously older than us and a bit more well off (which wasn't a big deal aside from having very little to talk about with them), and took our drink orders as we waited for the servers to prepare the room in the back.

My girlfriend and I both felt that this place was more about the experience, rather than the food quality. After spending $200 each, not including tip, we both found ourselves feeling full, yet empty, as much of the food lacked a lot of substance. There was only 2-3 very small servings with meat in the 20+ courses, and although the majority of it tasted very good and we were full at the end, it was definitely a meal that seemed based around liquids and went right through both of us. We were hungry again after a little less than 2 hours.

Aside from this, my girlfriend did actually get sick with an upset stomach from one of the courses, and had to excuse herself multiple times to use the restroom. This dish included squid and although I did not feel ""sick"" myself, it was the least satisfying of all 26 courses and I could understand why she felt that way. This dish did not leave me feeling pleasant either, and squid from other locations has been fine. We eat seafood often, so we were both surprised.

Service was phenomenal, they even walk you to the restroom. 5/5
Presentation was creative and unlike anything I've ever experienced. 4/5
Taste was good, not worth the money spent but good. 3/5

é is a very special restaurant from start to finish. Every dish is thoughtfully prepared and the pacing is perfect. There were plenty of surprises and special touches like edible branches with flowers that initially appeared to be decorative. And a judicious use of molecular gastronomy: not too much, not too little, but just perfectly right. It's the Goldilocks of molecular gastronomy. And Beautiful high-quality ingredients like kobe ribeye, truffles, caviar, and foie gras come in perfect bite after perfect bite over 20 courses. You will not leave hungry. 

The problem with this dining format, an intimate half-moon shaped 10-seat table, is that the quality of the experience very much depends on the company you keep. And in Vegas, that could be literally anyone.

My husband and I planned this restaurant experience for a year and dutifully emailed to book our dinner at the stroke of midnight exactly 3 months before our anniversary. We were rewarded with golden tickets but it never occurred to us that our fellow diners would find racist comments and vagina jokes polite dinner conversation. To our left were the Texans, a couple who found it appropriate to raise the merits of police killing African Americans (they were decidedly pro) during the aperitifs. To our right were the Locals, including a man wearing a diamond dice ring and his signature embroidered on his shirtsleeve who acted with the level of class not quite even rising to the outfit, including numerous comments throughout the meal about the taste and smell of vaginas. Help us, José! The lead chef attempted to deter the one-sided conversation, but alas, diamond dice ring guy was undeterred and aggressively took over the conversation. And we paid handsomely for the privilege of this company. 

Did this change the flavor of the delightful meal? No. Did it affect our enjoyment of the experience and deter us from returning to é? Yes. We have been to and enjoyed nearly every José Andrés restaurant multiple times; we are José super-fans. But this meal that we were so looking forward to will predominantly be remembered for the wrong reasons. Unless you enjoy your tapas with a helping side of racism and misogyny, if you visit é, I would strongly recommend coming with at least a few friends. The intimacy and shape of the table really forces you into conversation with your compatriots, which could be lovely or disastrous depending on who is there. Despite the perfect meal, I would be hesitant to return without a few friends for insulation. Otherwise, it's luck of the draw.

As you wait for the private room to be prepared, you sit just outside the restaurant at a massive 8 person picnic bench (for lack of a better word). Here a waiter brings you water and asks if you'd like the a glass of the signature Gin and Tonic. I did not personally order the signature drink, but the rest of my party did. A small sip was all I needed to realize I'd made a huge mistake. Take my advice and order it. The picnic table itself is my only complaint on the entire evening. I am ~6'2, and it was very difficult to get in and out of.

The room is dim and warm, and is decorated with all sorts of peculiarities. As you look around, you will have questions. Don't be shy, ask the staff what you're looking at and prepare for some insight into the man behind the meal.

The meal itself was the most spectacular experience of my Vegas vacation. Every dish of the 19-23 courses is prepared by expert hands right before your very eyes. All questions about the food and process are welcomed and answered clearly and concisely. I wish I could provide more detail into the individual dishes, but each is so intricate and so unique it would take a serious foodie mastermind to remember it all.

1) I remember an ""edible sangria"", which came individually packaged and gift wrapped. The sangria had been whipped into a light foam, a bed for the array of fruits that lay scattered throughout. 

2) There was a cotton candy pillow (I forget what they're called), with corn nuts drizzled in a dark (slightly salty) sauce. It was the perfect balance of sweet and salty, and really set the stage for the meal to come.

To make any further guesses at what was put in front of me would be an injustice to the food. All I can say is there was seafood and meats, breads and cheese, treats and delicacies and delights, textures and balance, creativity and simplicity. 

This meal can truly open your eyes to what real food is and what can be done with some imagination. 

If you have any questions feel free to reach out.

At the end of the meal, my buddy (who eats and travels well) confessed that he would have rather had a burger. Personally, I thought a better meal could be found at Andres other spot, China Poblano.

After wandering the cosmopolitian, there were not many options for lunch eats. This place looked decent because it was the only place with patrons that actually had a decent dining room during the lunch hour. We settled on the three course luncheon. We were reminded that the place served tapas like dishes and it was not recomended for sharing. But after receiving our food it was all easily very sharable. My friend and i nibbled on eachothers dishes and felt satisfied after our meal. Another note is that dishes come from several kitchens, so plates come whenever they are ready. Luckily, it was quiet so we got each dish, after we had finished one and it was paced perfectly. 

I loved my salmon dish, it was fresh and it was loaded with vegtables. Something that is very lacking at most restaurants in las vegas. I loved the majority of the dishes were either grilled which was refreshing from the typical deep fried junk on the strip. The meal was satisfying and light. And i felt great afterwards bc the meal was healthy overall. 

I loved the plating. Unique and fun. Ive never been served food in a shoe. But given its the las vegas strip, theres a first for someone. Instagram worthy dishes to make your mouth drool!",Rxmww5nPfQSADXK8B2B7qg,4,5,5,X7E8ojGDU4unEiGWp-N1Ew

It was a special occasion and we (surprisingly my husband included because he usually prefers cheap Chinese food over frou frou stuff) both thoroughly enjoyed the EXPERIENCE.  It was a precisely choreographed dance to put together these pieces of food, a play on textures, temperatures and flavors.  It was an experience with the art of food, and I'm not saying it with any disdain for snobbiness this time.  There were 24 morsels of delicious food - all incredibly creative.

The short and sweet version: Precision.  Perfectly choreographed and executed.  Juxtaposition of Flavors and Textures.  Adjectives that come to mind:  Fragrant.  Whimsical.  Airy.  Crunchy.  Ice Cold.  Salty and Sweet.  Warm.  Fluffy.  Umami.  Crumbly.

1.  Rebujito - our starting cocktail smelled like fragrant roses.  
2.  Truffle Cotton Candy - whimsical, fluffy with the aroma of truffle.  
3.  Idiazabal ""Macaron"" - delightfully crunchy with a cheesy filling
4.  Apple ""Brazo De Gitano"" - Airy on the outside, creamy blue cheese ""espuma"" on the inside
5.  Seta Suprise - Creamy 'shrooms
6.  Nitro Almond Cup - NITROGEN cold (not just ice cold) and smooth on the outside, creamy/briny/salty caviar on the inside.
7.  Barquillo - crunchy shell, aromatic Truffle and anchovy foam
8.  Almejas Al Natural - spherical globules encased with the essence of oyster 
9.  Bocatade Bacalao - warm, buttery brioche, savory cod, umami-licious?
10. Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - extra crispy chicken skin + foam
11. Cava Sangria - Pop!  globule of sangria 
12. Artichoke ""Puree"" with vanilla - creamy, mild, smooth
13. Lobster with Citrus & Jasmine - tender lobster with jasmine flavored air
14. Chickpea Stew with Iberico Ham - globules of essence of chickpea and accents of ham
15. Turbot with Bone Marrow - salty/sweet/bitter combo with crispy bone marrow, turbo fish and coffee grinds
16. Lobe of Foie Gras - savory foie gras combined with fresh orange juice 
17. Secreto of Iberico Pork with Squid + Parsley Foam - tender, squid was a touch burnt I thought
18. Santa Gadea with Cotton Candy - ""goat in sheep's clothing,"" goats milk with sweet cotton candy
19. Flan - creamy, light and airy
20. Pan con Chocolate - MY FAVORITE DESSERT OF THE NIGHT.  Crumbled frozen chocolate sorbet with cream, hints of saffron, crunchy sweet crystallized bread, and olive oil.  
21. ""Arroz con Leche"" - Another well played piece on texture, temperature and flavor
22. 25 second Bizcocho - fluffy cake with lemon cream
23. Air Chocolates - wow.  bitter chocolate and I usually really like dark chocolate 
24. Cocoa Paper with Dried Strawberry - airy light chocolate with tangy freeze dried strawberry bit

$ to Value Ratio:  4.75/5 Stars... This is definitely debatable (my mom may think it's a complete waste of money), but I rated it high because my experience was impeccable (service was top notch, ingredients were top notch)

1709249,2016-11-27,10,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"***Like Jose Andres' other in-the-kitchen-restaurant minibar, e by Jose Andres does not serve food that would be comparable to the country's best restaurants, but it is a one-of-a-kind dining experience***

I was able to dine at the new minibar by Jose Andres at the end of 2012 and it was a very special experience. That renowned DC restaurant is one of the most difficult restaurants to get a reservation given the small number of guests that can dine there in one night. At minibar, all diners sit at a counter in the kitchen where they get to see the chefs cook and plate. It is also a very interactive experience where diners get to really engage the chefs and learn a lot about the craft, technique and creativity that need to come together to make exceptional food.

e by Jose Andres is obviously from the same chef and it delivers a similar experience in Las Vegas. You get to watch the chefs plate and interact with them and you are presented a series of courses that are whimsical and playful and often delicious. There is one key difference though; you are in the kitchen at minibar so you get to watch the chefs cook as well as plate, which you do not get to do at e by Jose Andres.

The food at e by Jose Andres was very close to minibar and even better in some ways. The first taste was a white truffle cocktail with a smoky white truffle topping. The drink exploded with white truffle fragrance and flavor. There was also a meringue sandwich that featured white truffle and sweet butternut squash puree and a melt-in-your-mouth creamy hazelnut cup filled with caviar.

There were other fun savory bites like a crispy chicken skin crisp topped with a chicken oyster and black truffle as well as a toasted cheese sandwich with mini English muffin-like bread.  Shellfish was done very well here. Mussels were served with a very fragrant bisque-like emulsion and great liquid olives. The butter poached lobster (exceptionally moist and soft) was served more like how it would be presented at a traditional high-end fine dining restaurant.

Like minibar, e by Jose Andres serves a classic white bean Spanish soup in a modern twist where the white bean is transformed into creamy puree inside pasta-like pillows waiting to burst. There was also a fun take on foie gras with the foie gras turned into a snow-like powder that combined with sticky caramel and a strong beef consommé to deliver a sweet, savory and rich combination.

There were letdowns though. The lamb shank sounded good, but it was very dry. The cod cheeks featured squid ink and an incredibly rich and creamy sauce made of the cod bones, but the cod cheeks were not that appetizing.

Desserts included what looked like a sunny side up egg but was actually really good custard with caramel and orange as well as a chocolate cylinder, which sat on crunchy chocolate crumble and exploded with thin but intense mint chocolate liquid. Final bites were several mignardises including a very upscale take on ferrero rocher.

Prices are very high, but the dining experience here is quite unique and the service is personable and excellent. e by Jose Andres is truly a unique and theatrical restaurant that is reminiscent of Eleven Madison Park and Alinea, which more than makes up for the food that is very good but not up to the level of the country's best restaurants like Manresa and Saison.

e by Jose Andres is located in Jaleo at The Cosmopolitan. I believe The Cosmopolitan offers complimentary valet parking.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,19,17,5,VVCTqCVcYwvGCQqGri11Iw
1741583,2012-09-09,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"So, I finally forked over the big bucks to dine at E.  And what can I say... a very fantastic experience.  I have dined at Jaleo several times, food was always good, but service was always a bit to Vegas (I'm above all, union mentality, if you don't spend more than $500 tonight I don't need to service your table attitude).

But here at E - it was very relaxed yet refined.  This is the best food experience in Vegas - bar none.  I'm not going to give the full run down - but, I'm already planning to go back in the next few months.

If you are not a foodie, or if you are going with someone that is not a foodie - don't go, you will only ruin it for the people that truly will appreciate this kind of food and experience.  That was my only complaint of the night - food, amazing; service, top notch; ambience, second-to-none; guests - sucked.  There are 8 seats, 2 seatings a night - so the other 6 guests we dined with were not foodies, many didn't eat their food and didn't talk to each other or interact with the staff.  So the next time I go, I'm making sure that I know all 8 people to make the experience that much better.  So, if you never had the chance to dine at El Bulli, have not dined at Alinea - this is your next best.  What a gem for Vegas to have - and very few people know of it.  Yes, you can hit up the mansion at MGM for a 3 star Michelin experience with union servers running bread carts into your chair and have bussers spilling things or you can come to E and enjoy a show you can only get in a handful of restaurants in the world.",r54wxWohaQAav2kurfmwjg,3,0,5,K1XWGoQ5aXMZGAfP1x9u7Q

It's  super fun watching them prepare the food in front of us, with their neato surgical looking tools and whatnot.  Yes, molecular gastronomy is a fading fad now but this restaurant is at least very good at what they do, it's not just fireworks and meaningless pizazz, the food actually tasted good!

1789376,2011-04-28,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"After managing to get a last minute reservation at this coveted place my friend and I were really looking forward to dining here.  We got a Voice Mail confirming our reservation and the dietary restrictions we had (my friend doesn't eat Foie Gras and I stay away from Pork). Our reservation was done on a short notice so we didn't get the ""Golden Tickets"". We arrived earlier and were nicely greeted by a glass of Cava. If this was taste of things to come we in for a treat but didn't over indulge as we wanted to keep our appetite and taste buds fresh and not overwhelmed.  My friend pointed out the interesting name ""1+1=3"" which sorta summarizes this place (more on that later)
We were handed a keepsake menu with a rubberised seal (kind like makers mark)
Frozen Sangria with Grilled Strawberries.  I think presentation was key here with the liquid nitrogen drawing oh and aah from the table. Nice contrast between and warm cold. With a nice a detailed description on why sangria was made that way (doesn't evaporate the alcohol as it remains frozen) I luved the  warm strawberries and might try it myself Sangria was nice at first but I couldn't finish it as I am not big on Sangria.


Spanish Clavel. Again presentation was key here taste was not so much. The white petal made from yogurt didn't add anything to taste the centre flower has nice finish though. 
Beet Jewelry. Looked luvly and the finish was intense. How I would describe the bit of potato chips that are left after you have finished a bag and you get a surprise after while. Not bad  (not the intent I guess but awesome) 

Caramelized Pork Rinds. I had a substitute course here. My friend did like it though and commented melt in your mouth feel. 
Apple ""Brazo de Gitano"". Beautiful presentation. Nice gooey centre. The shell which was fluffy like a meringue had granny apple essence I think and centre was kind like a cheese. 
Jose Taco. I had a substitute course and it was caviar in an asparagus shell. 
Artichoke with Caviar and Quails Egg. I liked this dish and I am not big on caviar. Nicely Balanced.  
Membrillo with La Serena Cone.   Interesting combo didn't care much for it.
Bocata De Calamares could have been favourite dish if it wasn't too much bread and mayo. The uni was the freshest I have ever tasted. This one still made it to the top of my list. 
Ajo Blanco. Modern version of a Spanish soup made from Almonds and Garlic. Deconstructed soup very interesting IMO. My friend luved it I was ok with it. 
Cigala with Roses.  Good dish with intense flavour of shrimp heads. Top Notch. 

Smoky Oysters in Escabeche. Beautiful presentation again very nice flavours. 
catch of the day with Black Garlic. I luved the black garlic as am a big fan of it. Fish was good I think it would gone better with more buttery fish. 
Foie Gras Baked in Salt.  I was really looking forward to this as I am  a Foie Gras luver didn't find it amazing. I guess I am spoiled by a restaurant that is the Foie Gras Mecca in Montreal   
Secreto of Iberico Pork.  I had the rabbit instead nothing special. My friend luved this course.  
Orange Pith Puree with La Serena. Very strong cheese reminded of a something I bought in Montreal. Nice combination. 

Frozen Apricot Coulant.  Nice and refreshing. I luved the shell didn't care much for the interior.  

Apples and Red Wine ""Freddy Giradet"" nice goblets of wine and apples with ice cream on apple purée. 

25 Second Bizcocho. A Cake made in microwave from what I was told. More of technology demo than anything else  

Chocolates.  One was with saffron the other was like the fancy version of aero bar. Nice finish.
We were given a tour of the tiny kitchen in the back and we could see the effort that goes into preparing a 20 course meal. I am not sure they even break even when its all said and done. Maybe its an experimental play ground for the chef.  
I am tempted to give 5 stars but the wine/alcohol selection could have been better. I did enjoy the beer (I first tried it in Vancouver) from Elli  Bulli Chef as it did go well with the course.
The Service was excellent and we were all at ease with each (4 fellow Canucks made it easier for us as well) the chefs even mingled with us afterwards which is a rarity.  
Overall I don't think there were many dishes that stood out but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts going in line with the Cava before dinner (1+1=3).
Its hard to recommend a 250$  a pop meal as value but I guess this one is. Safer than any bet you would make or a show you can see in Las Vegas.",gwIqbXEXijQNgdESVc07hg,5,1,4,D3kqTz4JPCxEoWsadpTWXQ
1789913,2017-11-02,6,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"e by Jose Andres is a unique dining concept where you book online to get a Golden Ticket to a private dining room located in Cosmopolitan's Jaleo restaurant.  They open for business at 5:30pm or 8:30pm, and each time there is room for just six guests.  Its definitely one of the most unique dining experiences we've had, with a team of chef/artists/chemists preparing over 20 small dishes over the span of 90 minutes.  

It was so fun to watch and be able to interact with the chefs throughout the night.  As for the dishes themselves, I'm rating 4 stars overall.  Many dishes were mind-blowingly good and can only be dreamt up by a genius chef.  Some dishes tended to use too many cold (liquid nitrogen) ingredients that we did not care for.  There's also a heavy use of foie gras among the ingredients.

Our favorite dishes:
* This Dungeness crab served in its shell with a rich crab broth
* Wonder Bread - a brilliant mini PB&J sandwich with lemony meringue bread and foie gras jelly
* Braised Beef Cheeks - amazingly tender and served with liquid-filled potato gnocchi
* This walnut-themes dessert with raspberries.  They claimed walnut prepared four ways!
* Cotton-candy empanadas filled with foie gras
* This asparagus dish with foamy goodness and caviar

Least favorite dishes
* Edible Sangria - gives you brain freeze and seems really tart.  
* I liked the seared fluke itself, but found the minced pork and sauce around the plate to be a bit salty.

Definitely a fun experience, and I recommend it if you enjoy watching your meal created in front of you and for interacting with the chefs.

As many have noted, it is a unique dining experience filled with some amazing, creative dishes.  Some of the dishes were delicious, but overall, I came away from it a little unsatisfied.  

When you're given 21 courses over the course of 2+ hours and spending close to 400 pp (after tax and tip), it should be a culinary journey that has a beginning, a finale, and an ending.  I felt that the beginning and ending were nice, but the whole journey was a little scattered, and it didn't have a singular ""wow"" dish that I can say was the epic highlight.  The chef told us that Jose Andres can be often found drinking his favorite gin and tonic while making paella when he is visiting.  After hearing that, I was waiting for paella to be one of the 21 courses, but before I knew it, we were doing desserts.

The chefs and the waiters were great, although I found the hostess to be a little unfriendly.  Overall, I'm happy I had the opportunity to dine at this restaurant, and without a doubt, Jose Andres is an amazing chef.  Do I think it was worth the effort to get the reservation and the money to have dinner here?

They were asking questions and engaging the staff.  We even started the meal smiling at each other and clinking glasses with our neighbors.  Wow, friendly.  

The last two times I have had to hold my purse on my lap, there are no hooks, this time the gal whisked my bag to the wall.  Fabulous, wonder why it wasn't done before.

Fabulous new items:
-merienda, a spin on a traditional sandwich moms pack for their kids in Spain
-clams with reconstructed olives
-'fabes' con jamon, replaced the chickpea stew.  Loved the latter, didn't think it could get better, it definitely has, Iberico ham broth, lardo and reconstructed beans, so beautiful and smooth, because there is NO skin!
-secreto of Iberico pork with squid, super smoky and the pork was salty, fatty, good
-'kokotxas' al pil-pil, fish jowl, you don't need teeth for this one.  Just melted.
-check the round red disc with a golden 'e' stamped, a concentrated raspberry.  Willy Wonka style.

Still iffy: 
-nitro almond cup, I don't love nutty and caviar, too avant garde for my pedestrian tastes
-too much citrus in 1-2 dishes, but it's an option you can add to your bite, I opted out

Wine pairing is $130/pp and they will top you off.  The meal goes by pretty quickly and about halfway through they pour one selection per course, so you should have plenty left.

Beautiful meal, still a little lighter than I would like, but seemed more substantial.  I asked what their guesstimate would be calorically: 1500.  Not bad!!!  Much less than French, due to more creams, oils and little to no butter.  

If you're late, like we were, they will seat you at the end of the table, not what is stated on your ticket.

Our first round of ordering I ordered a dish that never came.. So when we asked about he he was like ""oh, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to put it in""... Then when we said ""yeah.. We do""..  He was like ""oh actually, well the chef wasn't happy with this dish tonight so we suggest you try another dish similar to that"".... Ok.... But it was weird he never told us this.

Next time he said ""we have lobster paella now but later they are making shortrib paella"". We said we would like the short rib paella when it comes out..and then ordered some other dishes. Meanwhile a waitress comes by 15 min later with a plate and says ""the waiter said you were interested in the paella so here is a sample of the lobster paella"". We tasted it and thought ""meh, glad we ordered the shortrib cuz this isn't that good"". Meanwhile other small plates come out and we said ""oh is the short rib paella coming still?"". Then he was like all ""oh I wasn't sure if you wanted it"" and we were like yeah we ordered the shortrib... He's like ""oh but didn't the waitress give you a sample,"". We were very confused.. He said ""oh the chefs decided to go with lobster all night and not do the short rib""...  Ok.... Why didn't you tell us this when we clearly ordered it?? 

So much confusion... So awkward... And so overpriced. The dishes were not that well executed and staff seemed not well-meshed. I thought maybe when we were seated at the bar before our reservation at ""è"" that it was awkward that they forgot about us and we got seated to ""é"" late (even though we were very early).. But apparently staff disconnect is a common theme here....",iMGU922NhQRo_c2QWFJ-hw,1,0,2,aSbHBZOcvpgg-D04-veVCw

We made our reservations about a month in advance thru email, printed, signed and scanned our confirmation, and received our golden tickets in the mail. 

We arrived at the host stand at Jaleo and were seated at the bar, while we waited for the rest of the party to arrive, and made drink selections. We opted to get one cocktail pairing and one mocktail pairing. 

We were escorted into the back room, which is decorated rather ""whimsically"" in a room lined with library card catalogue drawers and a little doll in a cage. It was a little weird, but not off-putting.

The chefs introduced themselves and began creating our first cocktail with some liquid nitrogen. From then on each of the many courses were assembled in front of us and then served ""fine dining"" style so we could all eat at the same time and comment on what we enjoyed about the dish. This was a lot of fun, and really, everything was so good. Some of the standouts for me (and I don't have the menu in front of me, I'll just put it in lamest terms) were the blue cheese filled appetizer, the chicken dish, and the pork dish. I surprisingly also liked the chocolate shavings with the olive oil - which is a combo I would never think would work, but did! Anyway, I won't go into detail with every dish, because I'm sure the menu changes all the time, so you don't know what to except, but it is so worth it. 

The cocktail pairing was not exclusively wine, as usual with most restaurants, but actually included a few cocktails, some wine, a beer and a coffee drink. The mocktail included drinks similar to the cocktail pairing, albeit alcohol, and some things like tomato water, watermelon fresca, and sangria. I thought the mocktail pairing was really fun, and I was glad my husband and I ordered both so we could try all of it. 

The service was impeccable. My only complaint was that I didn't get to see as much ""molecular gastronomy"" as I had hoped, since most of the items were already prepared ahead of time, then just assembled in front of you. Still, worth the experience and the $$$$ you will spend. Left the restaurant feeling satisfied and buzzed. Good times!",XXCS_jLbbOvH5g0JQvey-w,5,4,5,j-46thMkm1XLr19XhzoY4Q

The Golden Ticket you receive in the mail definitely sets the tone for the meal. As soon as you receive the ticket excitement fills your veins, until the day of your seating where you are whisked off to a incredible fantasy land.

Once you arrive the waiters seat you in the regular dining area and take your drink orders, before ushering you into the private dining area in the back. The little room only seats 10 people around the counter which surrounds the chef work space (this is dinner and a show).

Foie Truffles - you can't go wrong with these delectable little morsels, it was the perfect opening since we have missed eating foie so much!

Edible Centerpieces - beautiful looking branches with delicate pansy flowers were great to look at and munch on

Foie Doughnut - I think the best way to describe this is the Homer Simpson drool. It was so cute but so flavorful, a savory little ""doughnut"".

Cheese Cracker - yum! crunchy, savory, and delicate

Potato Glass with Foie - very unique looking dish, the potato glass is like a super thin potato chip

Gazpacho Sandwich - we had something similar to this at Jose Andres other restaurant and this was just as good, the ""bread"" has this delicate consistency that I think is made out of compressed cotton candy

Ham and Cheese English Muffin - this was one of the first cheese courses, it was muffin had the perfect consistency and the cheese was perfectly gooey 

Razor Clams - perfectly cooked and seasoned, also very delicate

Cheese and Nut Caviar - this was another cheese course, the ""caviar"" was delicious

Cava Sangria Bubbles - these little bubbles were filled with delicious sangria

Ibèrico Chickpeas - absolutely fantastic, I also had the additional truffle shavings which really made this dish sing, it was so fragrant!

Scallops with Truffles - AMAZING! The sweetness of the live scallop was pure perfection

Chicken Oysters - yum, definitely the best part of a chicken

Squid Ink Crusted Fish - perfectly cooked fish, with a light smokiness from the squid ink

Wagyu Beef - again with the extra truffle shavings... this is how beef should be served! Perfectly tender and bursting with meaty goodness

Cotton Candy Dumplings - these were filled with corn nuts, it was fun to watch the chefs put these together

Créma Catalana Egg - a delicate dessert that looked like a perfect sunny side-up egg

Assortment of chocolates - you can never go wrong with chocolate, especially the cute Forrer Rocher served in a Cartier box

This was a fun and tasty experience, the hubby and I loved being able to chat with the chefs and somalia. And since it truly is dinner with a show, the price is actually very reasonable. A definite must try in Vegas!",4bQp5jnqpoQpNfxMg1y_xQ,4,4,5,uL9O-sRDT5E-ksuDyAJJRA

From start to finish, we are all taken care of intimately as the team puts on a mesmerizing performance that deserves rounds and rounds of applause. Many restaurants these days pride themselves in ""molecular gastronomy"" cooking techniques. Yet many of them either fail to make an impact in terms of ""wow factor"", or fail to make the guests feel satiated, intellectually or physically otherwise. Other times, the restaurant may create such cerebral dishes that diners feel hard to relate. Worse yet, some restaurants charge exorbitant amounts just to ride on the hip bandwagon but fail on all accounts. In this respect, é by José Andrés truly hits it out of the park by creating a modest (though by no means cheap), thoughtful, whimsical and playful menu. Not only do I feel full, but I also get to peer into the culinary philosophies and experience the technical precision of the great Catalan chef. Most importantly, I can relate to many of the dishes served albeit them presented in groundbreaking ways. This meal is truly a spectacle. I will wait till the menu changes substantially and come back to wow myself in due time. Until then. (6/8/2017)

I had never heard of è before and a friend invited me saying her original guest canceled. I've never been happier with a dinner invite I accepted. 

As I'm sure you've read/seen at this point you do receive a golden ticket about a week before your reservation slot. (I did not because like I stated I was a guest of my friends reservation). 

We went on Wednesday November 4th for an 8:30pm reservation. We arrive at 8:10 my friend shows the golden ticket securing our reservation and we were treated like royalty from then on. We were kindly seated at a table with the other patrons we would be dining with while our server goes over beverage options with each couple. 8:30 rolls around we are promptly escorted to a secluded room away from the noisier section of the restaurant. We are seated at almost a hibachi style seating where the table holds 8 people and 2 smiling chefs standing right in front of you. The chefs explain that we will be dining on a 22 course meal all of which are influenced by the country of Spain. 

The chefs begin preparing and plating right in front of us. They also encourage conversation amongst the other people dining with us and with themselves. It was truly amazing to see these chefs plate everything right in plain view, like watching masterpieces of art being assembled just for you. There are 2 waitresses in the room the  entire time that always made sure our glasses were full and our eating spaces were immaculate. They also bring you new silverware after EVERY dish and a warm hand cloth after any dish that requires you to use your hands. I did also let them know the night before that I can not eat sea food and they had delicious substitutes just for me. 

The food was truly nothing I had ever seen before. From peanut butter and jelly empanadas, to gold dusted ferrero rocher, to gelatin balls filled with alcohol that burst in your mouth, to a delicious mini pizza. While most of the food was so tasty and avant garde, I really do feel like the food is more for people with a very expensive pallet. While I have dined at some of better known restaurants in Las Vegas, I have never dined somewhere where the portions are super tiny and flavor combinations are so unique. They had a dish of a beet gazpacho between beet crackers that nearly made me gag at the table. 

With all that being said my friend paid 450$ for our dinner and I left 100$ for the tip. The experience alone was well worth the money. They also give you a souvenir envelope with all the dishes you tried and let you sign their guest book. A night out at è should definitely be something you add to your bucket list.",gnRJLFH4rmB1DTu985Thzg,1,0,4,9FzbQtTxA6XUvOq2pgnT5Q

Whenever a restaurant refers to itself as a ""show"", I fear that it will be significantly more pretentious than necessary. Well, they were right. It is a show. An amazing show. They captivate you from the moment you go into that small 8-person room. They introduce you to your chefs for the evening, who are so talented and creative. They start off making a tasty drink with liquid nitrogen. I didn't do the wine pairing, but it looked fun. I ordered a glass of wine, and I kept getting refills, which I didn't get charged for. The waiter may have felt sorry for me b/c I was there alone, as most people there were with their significant other. That's okay... at the end of the night, you feel like you're friends with everyone you sat with. 

Every bite of food was amazing. Even something as simple as an olive in a spoon exploded in your mouth. I loved the bone marrow in the phyllo cone (and I'm not even a big bone marrow fan). I wish they had foie gras on the night I was there though.   A lot of liquid nitrogen used and a lot of foam. My only complaint is that there were more sweet flavors rather than savory ones. I would have liked it to be the other way around. Also there was no red meat (only fish and pork) on the night I was there. I would have liked some red meat. But the food was all incredible.

2092955,2012-07-10,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"Although the noise level is somewhat high for a date, I thought it was still alright to take one there.

For two of us, we ordered about seven dishes, which filled us up pretty well.  As some of you might know, the food here is tapas style, served and proportioned as appetizers.

Like China Poblano and E, they still manage to stay creative with their dishes.  I remember our potato wrapped chorizos were served in what looked like a bowling shoe.  We also tried the seared scallops, which seemed to really soak in a nutty taste from the pine nuts and the dressing they used with it.

Out of everything I tasted though, the best of them all were the oysters in lemon gin and tonic.  Amazing.  To tell you the truth, I'm not really a big fan of oysters.  Unlike it's shellfish brothers, they manage to retain a strong, ocean taste regardless of what you do to them (and really, there's not much many like to do to them so as to preserve their raw state).  But here at Jaleo, they manage to have the lemon alchy mix to subdue the putrid ocean taste.  

Sorry to all the oyster enthusiasts- if you like your oysters as raw tasting as possible, then don't order it from here.  Everything else though, is good to go.",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,1,1,4,RAI84816551D6ZVCMgMG_g
2106196,2013-04-29,11,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"I arrived on time for my reservation, coveted golden ticket in hand.  I was - understandably - giddy with excitement for the night's intimately exclusive molecular gastronomy show.  

Within the first few courses, I was eating truffled cotton candy sprinkled in gold leaf out of the palm of José  Andrés' hand - literally.  Or at least, a cast replica of it.  The eight life-sized replicas, admittedly, were a bit creepy when all lined up along the bar.  

The real show-stopper of my night was the salt crusted foie gras, which made its grand entrance on a cutting board hoisted over Chef Cody's shoulder.  That's right:  one fattened duck liver, cooked beneath a thick layer of salt.  I couldn't help but to squeal in delight when I saw it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't convinced that salt crust is a fantastic way to serve foie gras, and though it was still delicious, I can name a dozen other preparations that I'd have preferred.  Also disappointingly, they did not cut the foie gras tableside, but rather, took it back into the kitchen to crack the salt shell, cut and plate.

Which is to say, they are not cooking in front of you.  Much is done in front of the diners, but the cooking, for the most part, is not it.  Mostly, its the finalization steps and the plating.  The dirty work takes place behind the closed kitchen door.  

But that's not the reason for the four-star review.  

The evening started on a sour note when the host/captain seated us in the waiting area with the other guests who were to be sitting at the chef's table that evening.  They gave us water to quench our thirst while they discussed the drink pairings of the evening.  I happily nodded in agreement when asked whether I would like to participate;  so did some others.  Soon after, he showed an ipad to the gentlemen sitting at the end of the table, and asked whether they were interested in pre-dinner cocktails.  One of my party members glanced at the menu, then asked whether the host had anything to recommend.  I waited patiently.  After the gentleman decided on his beverage, the host was gone.  

Knowing me, my dining habits, and the fact that I would also like a cocktail, my dining companion handed me the iPad, where I browsed Jaleo's beverage offerings, then made a request when the host returned with my friend's drink.  Without blinking an eye, this guy asked me whether I could wait a moment, as in ""a few minutes"", I would be seated with the evening's first alcoholic beverage pairing in front of me.  

I was confused.  

I asked whether a ""few minutes"" meant less than the amount of time it takes to make a drink and have it brought to the waiting area.  He corrected himself and said that I would be seated ""shortly,"" and should not fear my immediate thirst.  

At this point, I turned my body in my seat toward the captain, looked him in the eye, and asked, ""are you saying I shouldn't have a drink because it really IS a huge amount of alcohol we're getting tonight, or is it because of my size, gender, or ethnicity?""  I look at him expectantly.  

Host comes to a dead stop.  He tells me he'll get me my drink immediately.  And he does.

So here's the thing.  I've done the tasting menu thing pretty regularly.  I've always done the alcoholic pairings - and in some cases, will even spring for the reserve tier offerings.  I mean, a sommelier's pairings is generally the optimal way to bring out all the flavors the chef intended in his tasting menu.  Nobody has ever denied me a pre dinner cocktail, or not offered me beverage pairings when they were supposed to, or has ever treated me differently than any of the men in my party - in spite of my size, and the generalization that asian females can't handle their liquor.  This was certainly a first for me.  

At the end of the night, after I'd consumed all my drink pairings, including the porron and pre-dinner cocktail, and paid my own ~$450 bill, I smiled happily at the host, then gleefully said to him, ""and look, I'm still standing up, all on my own!""

Then I was off for the night, wandering my way through Vegas for more booze...",V82pSScoeQ9vddeZQWxPeQ,2,4,4,KbCV_tYq-nkqS5nIrSeY_Q

You immediately know this will be an evening of creativity and innovation.

The culinary adventure starts with a hand towel wrapped around lavender and rosemary.   

Two chefs plate the food in front of you while they describe the dishes.  They are more than willing to answer any questions (and we had lots).  The drinks were served and explained just as each course was served.

Gin & Tonic - before dinner drink at Jaleo

Edible Sangria

Cotton Candy 2.0 - Cotton candy empanada with foie gras! Great tasting and fascinating to watch the preparation.

Beet-kini- A grilled cheese with beet ""toast"".

Imperial Gramona Cava served with a porron - A fun way to get into the spirit of the evening

Coca De Recapte - It seemed early in the meal for a couple bites of meat, but it really worked. 

Merienda- A very light cheese stuffed bun that makes a really great bite.

Tio Pepe En Rama Sherry - This glass of sherry really reminded me of our last trip to Spain.

Oyster and Oyster- An oyster is smoked at the table and paired with a chicken oyster on the crispiest chicken skin.  

Pescado en Adobo - A great bite of fish 

El Vermut- Mussels with vermouth sauce

Priorat Natur Vermut - An interesting Spanish grape based vermouth

Cava Sangria - An incredible demonstration of spherification with a cava based sangria!

""Fabes"" con Jamon- Another demonstration of molecular gastronomy around the concept of fava beans.  It needs to be experienced.

Acustic Cellers Blanc - A wonderful blend of Spanish whites

Spanish Pulpo - This octopus tentacle is visually stunning!

Kokotxas al Pil Pil - Codfish Jowls

Berroja - A completely new Spanish wine for us. A great pairing for the flavours of the courses.

Mushrooms en Papillote - Mushrooms steamed in a plastic bag.  When cooked they cut the bag open.  Another dish that words cannot fully describe.  

Vinaredo - I got rich apricot flavours from this wine

Chuleta - Australian waghu. Awesome flavour! I was able to get one of the bones to chew on. 

Emilio Moro Malleolus - This temporillo was a perfect match for the strong beef flavours!

Torto Pascualete with Cotton Candy - Pressed cotton candy with flowers

Molino Real mountain wine - I loved this sweet wine with dessert

Crema Catalana Egg - A surprise.  Visually and textually pleasing.

After Eight Timbal - While inspired by ""After Eight"" this is a fantastic improvement based on a chocolate drum

Ron Cremat - This ""burnt rum"" beverage is allowed to burn down to create a fantastic rum coffee drink.  

Ferrero Roche - This brilliant bite is inspired by Ferrero Roche and served in a ring box. 

Yemita - It was like a one bite lemon pie.

Everything from the cocktails to the appetizers to the main courses to the desserts were interesting, beautiful and delicious.  The plating was so intricate and impressive to watch, and the staff were all so friendly and willing to answer questions and tell stories.  

I was a little bit nervous about my nut allergy, which can be challenging at restaurants... but that was unnecessary.  Just be sure to tell them in advance on the questionnaire that they send you, and they go out of their way to accommodate.  I thought perhaps I'd have to miss certain courses or have parts left out of dishes, but no... if there was a dish that they couldn't do right without nuts, they made me a completely different, special, nut free alternative.  Sometimes I felt bad because mine looked even better than everyone else's :)  It was so nice to be able to sit back and relax and know that my allergy was being taken seriously.

I should also mention that we shared one of the drink pairings, and this was fantastic!  Several wine pairings, a beer, and a couple cocktails at the end.  The drinks really highlighted each of the flavors - it was pretty amazing.

Reservations aren't too bad to secure. It's a nine seat restaurant with two settings a night: 5:30 and 8:30 pm. You just need to email them within three months of the date you prefer. You do provide your credit card, so be sure to cancel at least 48 hours in advance or else you'll be charged the cancellation fee. I think it would be a fun idea to book all nine seats with your friends. It'll feel like you have your own private chef since it's basically a single table in a small room.

You and your fellow diners are seated around a half circle table behind the bar at Jaleo. Everything is plates in front of you and the chefs are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. They were all so nice and friendly! 

There were 20 courses and they were all small plates. I love tapas because it allows you to experience more without getting too full. For a two hour dinner, I actually didn't leave too stuffed. I love how they combined cotton candy with foie gras and corn nuts in a dish. Genius! My favorite dish was the grilled ham and cheese sandwich, aka the merienda. The bread was amazing and I wish I could eat this every day of my life. Other favorites include the morels en papillote, fabes con jamon (fava beans), and the after eight timbal (think thin mints with liquid gold and rum painted of top. Gorgeous and delicious)

The drinks are on point as well. Sangria was very smooth- best I ever had. There is also a beer- lemonade drinks with rosemary. Definitely unique but light and refreshing. 

The bill for two with sangria and a cocktail came to a little under $550. A service charge is already included but you can always tip more if you would like. This place is a hidden gem, especially since it has a semi-secret entrance. It is also the sister restaurant of Minibar in DC.

Lots of sherry based cocktails, if you are into that.  My husband had the Spanish golden and the sangre y fuego, and he enjoyed both of them very much (each $11).  

And the sangria.  The sangria is awesome.  $17 for a half carafe.  A pretty good deal and it will knock you on your ass. Unfortunately you cannot order it by the glass so just be prepared to share or get drunk.

But enough about the alcohol.  The food is amazing, too!  Our server, Patrick, recommended the sopa ajoblanco ($10) and I have to admit it is the best chilled soup I have ever had.  Cream based soup almond and garlic soup with crab meat and grapes.  It sounds weird, but it was a terrific flavor combination.   Our server also recommended the hamburgesa de Iberico ($14), which is a grilled pork burger served with a cream sauce.  So tasty.  I think my husband inhaled this one.  The croquetas de jamon Iberico also very tasty and served in a cute little fry basket.

The paella is also excellent and changes daily.  This time they offered the lobster paella.  Big pieces of lobster and the lobster flavor permeated the rice.  The menu is confusing but it can be ordered in a single serving for $28.  

Desserts were excellent. Olive oil ice cream with grapefruit was another great suggestion from Patrick.  The flan was also excellent.  The desserts are $9 each.

Service was impeccable.  

Excellent tapas joint!  Great décor and lots of fun!  Check out my picture of the bull in the wrestler's mask.

We also had the non alcoholic beverage course, which was intriguing.  Instead of wine and beer pairings, we received specially made non alcoholic pairings.  Especially good was the cucumber juice margarita with spicy pepper and the pineapple upside down cake juice.  Very interesting.  

The staff were excellent and attentive, and even genuinely interested in opinions and thoughts about each item, so as to continually improve the experience.  Overall, for $250 each it was an excellent deal, as it included the tip and the tax and beverages, which puts it ahead of many similar restaurants.  No complaints other than we were a little late starting at 8:45 instead of the prompt 8:30 that was indicated.  Also, the reservation form specifically said NO CAMERAS, but that was not true.

Is the meal pricey? Yes it is. However you do get what you pay for. This is one of the most difficult restaurants to get into in the US if not the world. So therefore a high price can and should be expected. If you are one of those who are going to complain about the price, then you probably have no business being at the dining table for 9 lucky recipients of the golden ticket.
If the price doesnt scare you away, be prepared for a culinary experience that is unparalleled. You will dine on rare meats, fish, truffles galore. You will witness  craftsmanship in the food preparation and will taste the science behind extremely complex flavor profiles.

Do. Not. Waste. Your. Money. Here. Just don't. 

The price tag on this meal is insane. It's 250.00 a person not including tax and tip. And the food while very pretty has few impressive ingredients. No delicious cuts of meat. One piece of meat and one piece of fish in the whole meal. And those were tiny. We dropped 1,000 for three people and we found ourselves hungry and eating again two hours later. 

The plating of the food is beautiful and it's fun to watch them prepare the plates. Problem with the food is that it lacks any soul. And for this kind of money you would expect some aged meat or lobster or something rare and delicious. Nope, none of that here. It was disappointing. 

The service besides the plating of the food is pretty bad. Again you would think they would treat you like kings. They don't. 

Lastly don't even think about celebrating a special occasion here. They will do nothing for you. In our case, we had two birthdays and we could have gone anywhere to celebrate it and we came here. And they knew. At least wish us happy birthday! So thumbs down for special occasions. 

Nothing about this experience other than the plating is special. So do yourself a favor and go spend the money at a beautiful steak house or get an incredible sushi meal. You'll have money left over for a show and an entire evening on the town.",eigZw_Tn4TWJPSZ9UO9Auw,31,10,3,pTvwceGs133aHaD9UpwTRw
2379521,2012-07-29,9,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"OMFG!

This was by far the most expensive and memorable meal of my life. My wife and I dined here about two months ago. We shared the drink pairing. Two meals and one drink pairing came to $666. Though dare I say it, it was TOTALLY worth it.

I love cooking and trying new foods. If you do, too, this is totally the place for you. You will love it. If you're not a foodie and not into unique cooking techniques, you'll probably find it overpriced and won't fully appreciate it. That being said, it was the perfect place for me.

There were four couples in our sitting. None of us knew each other, but we all seemed to be the same basic type. Foodies who make pretty good money but aren't exactly rich who are willing to pay for a one-of-a-kind once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.

We all LOVED our food. In fact, at one point the chefs left to get something from the kitchen and one of the guys said, ""Good, they're gone. Now we can lick our plates."" We all chuckled but all highly considered it. No one wanted to waste one single drop of deliciousness.

I would say my favorite course was the chickpea soup with iberico pork. The ""chickpeas"" were filled with iberico pork and chickpea broth. It was amazing. I had never had iberico pork and instantly fell in love.

I am not a fan of desserts and there were quite a few served. However, I have to admit that I liked every single one of them. My favorite involved olive oil, cocoa powder and mascarpone or something similar. We were instructed to drag our spoons through the olive oil and into the cocoa powder. Sounded weird but WOW!

My wife is a connoisseur of flan and said that hands down e's was the best she had ever had. I don't care for flan, but I had to agree this flan was delish! 

I could go on and on about every single course. But lots of people have already done that, and it would be very hard to truly do any of the courses justice.

Aside from the food itself, the other awesome aspect was being able to watch the creation and plating of many of the courses. Everything was done with such care and perfection. The chefs used droppers and tweezers to carefully add the most delicate items. I was in awe throughout the whole dinner and was envious of the chefs who get to work with such great ingredients every day.

About midway through the dinner, the chefs told us to look behind us. When we did, we saw none other than Jose' Andres. He was in town for Uncork'd and stopped in for a moment to see how we were all doing. We all expressed our amazement at everything we had tried thus far.

When we finished our meal, I saw Jose' sitting at one of the tables in Jaleo. I asked one of the waiters if it would be okay for me to go up to him and ask for his autograph. He said that Jose' was being interviewed by a food magazine but should be done shortly and I could wait at the bar and approach him once he was done. I did so, and once his interview was over I was able to catch him before he went back into the kitchen. He autographed my menu and my wife took a picture of us. The people from the food magazine were still around and their photographer snapped a few pics too. It was a perfect ending to a perfect night.

I mentioned earlier that this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. However, I can't imagine never going back. Maybe I should change that to a once every 5 years event. Or if I get a big raise, maybe once a year. Even my wife who usually gets upset when we go to higher-priced places as she thinks it's not worth it (and that's with a bill about 1/6 of e'), said that the meal was totally worth it.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,19,16,5,8rU9UpFmrqXMHHzcYHyAGA

We curled up in delight at the feet of these talented chefs as they took us on a colorful, tasty, most satisfying journey through the mind of José Andrés. If you're at all socially awkward the opening act is a little unnerving. Out in the main dining room before you are spirited back into the small private é dining space, you are sitting there staring at 6 strangers, but once the drinks start flowing, you quickly feel at ease, especially at the hand of the attentive, expert & friendly service. The chefs are all introduced and as you watch the sausage made, so to speak, you are encouraged to engage, guess, ask questions.  Our favorite courses were the iberico ham/ pan con tomate surprise, the tiny pizza-inspired cheese taste, the braised wagyu beef cheek, the inspired Uni con lardo, and the clam escabeche. We both loved the flan-based dessert with bonus points for the After 8/Fresh Mint bouquet presentation. For me, the only small quibbles would be the very large orange slice in the House Gin & Tonic (rendered the entire drink as Orange Soda, though it was visually arresting) & the 1st deconstructed sangria (icy/puckering/hard on the mouth).  We were blown away by the quality of ingredient on display-- yes you're paying top dollar here, but it's not just caviar, it's sturgeon caviar. Not just truffles, French Burgundy truffles. Not just beef cheeks, wagyu beef cheeks. Not just jamon, but Iberico de Bellota .

Having tried most of the fine dining restaurants in Vegas, I thought i'd seen it all til i was pleasantly surprised with a shiny golden ticket in the mail!

When that fateful evening arrived on Saturday October 13th, I was like Charlie waiting in eager anticipation to finally visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  Truth be told, I wasn't quite sure what was in store for me but i had a feeling it would be something good! 

In fact, as soon as we stepped into Jaleo, we were cordially seated at the bar and kindly given the drink menu for the evening on a handy iPad! Since I was feeling celebratory, i decided on the wine pairing with my meal and  as soon as our server found out it was my birthday, he gave us a glass of cava on the house! Now that's service IMO! 

After that, we were escorted to a dimly lit and intimate private room with a semicircular bar surrounded by wooden card catalogs housing Jose Andre's eclectic tchotchkes, which he apparently collected from his travels around the world.  At this time, the chef introduced himself and proceeded with a brief explanation of the evening's events.  Without a moment to spare, the chef and his skilled staff worked feverishly on the first dish. Liquid nitrogen began to billow over the counter and within moments, we were presented with beautiful bite size pieces of food art. About 20 or more dishes followed in succession, each skillfully crafted to engage and amaze!

I must admit, I arrived with high expectations, but the chef and staff at é definitely did not disappoint. It was a truly unforgettable experience that was filled with intrigue and spectacle. An intimate showcase inspired by traditional Spanish dishes, masterfully executed by the talented chef and staff. é is bar none one of the most interesting and enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had in Vegas!

We have eaten at Jaleo several times, so we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for further instructions. Let me insert here there receiving our golden tickets in the mail was too much fun! While enjoying our drinks at the bar, the host for e came to greet us and instructed us to wait at a table for 8 for the remainder of our dining party. There are only 2 seating for e per evening, and only 8 people per seating, so we were intrigued to discover the remainder of our party.

We were pleasantly surprised! We were hoping that we wouldn't be eating with pretentious, annoying people, and our fears were allayed as soon as we met the rest of our group. They were a group of 5, 4 women and 1 man. They were all from the midwest and had just arrived in Vegas due to a severely delayed flight. They couldn't have been more pleasant, and it was really fun to eat with them. The appreciated delicious food, to be sure, but they were also really down-to-earth and fun. This is a huge part of the dining experience at e to be sure-who you eat with could make or break the experience.

When all of our party was assembled, the host to us to the back on the restaurant and to the left, where the small room that is e was located.

A highlight of the whole experience for me was drinking cava the traditional way out of a Spanish drinking vessel. So much fun! Every small dish we sampled seemed to be better than the last. From iberico to foie gras to lobster to Jose' famous ""air"" that seemed to be a part of many of the dishes, we feasted like queens.

Live Scallop

Wagyu Ribeye

As many who frequent this website know, é is moderately difficult reservation to make based only on the small intimate dining experience that seats 8 or 9 people at a time. They have two seatings a night--doubling your opportunity to get in!!!...but obviously still very limited. I first reached out to them several months in advance. They weren't able to take my reservation at that time as it was outside the three month range, but they shared the reservation process with me. Later, when the date was now three months out, I emailed them and found the method practical and easy to use.

I was thoroughly impressed with é by José Andrés. The food is playful and whimsical at é. The setting reveals a jovial look into the mind of José Andrés. The experience is an affair uniquely encountered...an event unto itself. I'm not sure I would recommend é by José Andrés if you rarely dine at this price point...admittedly, there are better options if it's just about food and service. Then again, I don't know if there is a Vegas food experience I would rather participate in annually more than é.

I had initially made a reservation at Sage (Aria) since I had seen some good reviews regarding that place.  But then I realized that I had always wanted to try a molecular gastronomy restaurant.  Since Las Vegas is a great place for foodies like myself and my girlfriend, I decided to google molecular gastronomy in the area.  And voile!  E by Jose Andres.  That meant I didn't have to fly all the way to Chicago to eat at Alinea (although i still would love to try that place).  Also, E costs 1/4 as much as Alinea, so it's a steal either way.  

Must say that I was quite stunned when E's website only had a picture of their symbol and an email address through which you make reservations.  I had read that you used to have to make a reservation 1 month in advance but more recently, it looks like at least a few months in advance.  I had only started looking at this option at the beginning of January for a reservation in the middle of January so I knew my chances were slim, but I still sent in a request.  Luckily enough, they had 2 seats available for when I was there!  Scanned and emailed my credit card information and my seats were reserved.

Now on to the experience.  When you arrive (they request you to be there at least 15 min early), you are seated near the bar and presented with a list of cocktails and wines on an ipad.  They give you the option of getting the alcohol pairings for the meal or just ordering a la carte.  We opted for the a la carte since we were there for the food and not the wine (plus it costs almost as much for the wine pairing as for the food so for us, it probably would have not added that much more in terms of enjoyment).  

Once it was show time, we were taken into a secluded and rather well decorated room with a semi-circular table, around which were 8 seats.  The sous chef was waiting there for us and gave us a brief introduction.  Then, they began rolling out ~22 courses (I still need to count the pictures) right in front of our eyes, using various molecular techniques.  One technique which prevailed through multiple dishes was the process of making purees and/or drinks, modifying it with some natural substance and then dropping it into a bowl of liquid to form identical spheres of liquid.  This was prepared at different temperatures to show that it was stable not only at a low temperature but also relatively high temperatures.  The first one was a cocktail enclosed in a rather large sphere and presented in a soup spoon, and another was a pureed white bean, enclosed in small spheres and presented in a shallow bowl of broth.  

Overall, the experience was both exciting and educating.  They allowed us to ask any questions we liked about the processes they were using.  The portions were just right and we never felt like we were waiting too long in between courses.  We did not feel hungry at the end and were very satisfied with the meal.  Some of the memorable dishes were:  Truffle-flavored cotton candy, enclosed cocktail, turbot with deep friend bone marrow, and saffron-flavored ice cream with chocolate shavings.  One of the drinks that was paired at the end was their gin and tonic.  Everybody was raving about it so we tried one.  IT WAS AMAZING!  I never liked gin before, but the balance of this one was so nice and not too overpowering with the gin.  They used a large round sphere of ice so the surface area of the ice was less and would not end up diluting out the drink as quickly!

Anyway, I could write way more.  there is just not enough words to describe how awesome the experience was.  Great company, great food; what more could you ask for?  Would definitely go back.",vzAifyq6-IWBXbImGtyfRA,4,1,5,DRuxcQVns9xo3uoduuWyvA

Service is unparalleled: from the promptly-returned emails to make this reservation a reality to double-checking that no food preference was overlooked, I was wowed by Kathleen's efficiency & attention to detail. 

Presentation: Nine coveted spots. A secret back room in another one of José Andrés' restaurants. It all serves to give the illusion of exclusivity, when in fact $195+/per person and a fairly flexible schedule gets you a Golden Ticket...literally. Chefs plate & create in front of your eyes, & a few dishes are served in boxes that need to be opened -- who doesn't like to be surprised? 

Food:
* Timing was more fast paced than I anticipated, but no complaints, I can throw down 20+ courses in just under 2.5 hours! 
* There was no shortage of appetizers/small bites & desserts, but I felt there weren't enough main courses to be able to compare their handywork to other prix fixe menus I've tasted. However, from what I sampled, many of é's courses were only in the 3-star range (i.e. the ""merienda"" ham & cheese on brioche, lobster course, chicken oysters on crispy chicken skin, etc,.) 
* Relied heavily on foam to flavor, & airy things like cotton candy for texture, which didn't particularly impress me, however, I understand that keeping bites light is a must in a multi-course to-do. 
* Stand-out courses were: the cheese course, which mixed pungent sheep's milk cheese with brown sugar elements; any dish which involved piqueo pepper as a sauce or emulsion; the ""mushrooms en papillote,"" which was simple, but uniquely presented; and the last dessert course called ""more things,"" which were four sweet bites that popped, crunched, or fizzed. Also, really loved the non-alcoholic pineapple upside-down signature drink.

Yes, it was expensive - but I loved it with wine parings (you will get a lot of alcohol - so, don't drink too much - if you are not heavy drinker, you will be wasted at the end ).

I just learned about this place about a month ago (guess I was living under a rock) and wasn't even sure if we could get in because reservations begin 3 months in advance. Their reservation is by email only and it's a convoluted system of waiting, automated replies and some paperwork. I felt like I was undergoing a difficult job application. After a couple of weeks, they replied that they had a last-minute availability the week of my husband's birthday and I snapped it up.

So if you manage to get this far, é is located at a back room inside Jaleo at The Cosmopolitan. It only seats 8. You will be seated at a bar to witness as each dish is plated for you. Their menu consists of 20+ small plates is said to be influenced by Spanish and Basque cuisine with creative bites like an Empanada of cotton candy and foie gras and a white sangria bubble that bursts in your mouth. Food reimagined that fools your senses with unexpected flavors and texture. They can offer alternative plates for people with allergies or special dietary needs when mentioned during reservation but I feel that it might lessen the experience. The service is very attentive as you would expect from a place that anticipates you to shell out a lot of dough.

We opted for wine pairing with our meal and it included a variety of wines and liqueurs from different regions  in Spain. While it was a great idea at the moment, the wine pairing made our after-meal experience not so pleasurable. It's definitely not for people, like me, who are not used to drinking and mixing a lot of alcohol -- unless you wish to experience one of your most expensive hangovers. The wiser choice for me would've been sticking to a gin and tonic.

I love it for the excellency, the passion, the inspiration, and the meaningful connection of a shared experience with someone you love...é by José Andrés was the perfect execution of them all.

My love (David V.) planned this night for 3 solid months for my birthday in order to secure a reservation...since they only have 2 seatings for 8 people at each time and as a result are in high demand.

We received 2 golden tickets mailed to our address, along with confirmation of our reservation. It felt just like being in Willie Wonka...only this wasn't a movie...this was reality, and I felt like the chefs were taking a slice of José Andrés' mind and translating it to us personally. 

21...I say it again, twenty one courses, beautifully prepared and presented course...with wine pairings that would impress a sommelier...masterfully showcased for us and the other 6 patrons by chefs Michael and Nick. And Suffice it to say, they executed in line with José Andrés' reputation--with love and pride like they owned the place themselves. Other than my dinner partner and the food, one of the things I loved the most was the conversations with the chefs...we talked about our favorite local joints in Vegas and they described their journeys as chefs up to this moment. As Golden Tickets go, I was throughly amazed and delighted with the concept and delivery at é by José Andrés. 

So...if you need to impress someone, or just want to indulge yourself, set the alarm to remind yourself to wake up and make a reservation 3 months prior to your occasion to é. If you do, you will be so glad you did.

On a side note, I posted photos of the wine, but my love will post photos of the food if are interested in seeing more of our experience.",doGsaahbqD7ePHP19UsDsg,22,19,5,I0y_8WM7KoqXm4CDaDJx3A

I won't bother running through the 26 dishes we had here since the menu will constantly evolve and part of the fun of dining here is the surprise factor.  

Just know this - you won't necessarily like all the flavor combinations, and this may not be the most 'delicious' meal ever, but it's one of the best combination experiences out there.  Having been to Saam at the Bazaar in LA, I would say this meal blows that away in terms of creativity and intimacy.  You are served at an 8 guest bar by Chef Cody Jeffs, two assistant chefs, and 2 servers.  The courses come in succession and you will find yourself with a smile on your face through much of the night I'm sure.

The only complaint with our experience, which I was willing to overlook in my 5 star review, was the coordination of the experience when you arrive.  The actual room for é by José Andrés is within Jaleo as most know.  When we arrived with our golden tickets (sent a week before), we got a bit of a confused look from the Jaleo hostess.  After a short wait, she was walking us to a table to sit down and review beverage options when she realized we had a party of 4 and not 2.  This was strange since my reservation was for 4, our tickets said a party of 4, so how could she not know?  Anyways, with Jaleo being jam packed at 8pm, she said that there actually wasn't a table available to accommodate us and we had to find seating outside and someone would come find us.  She pointed us to a general seating area outside of Jaleo where there weren't even 4 seats together.  I wouldn't have been so annoyed if the emails from é  didn't specifically ask us to come early.  For the price and experience that is é , they really need to figure out a better way to welcome their 8 guests.  I fully understand that the 5:30 show was probably still wrapping up and that Jaleo was at it's peak when we arrived, but there should still be a system worked out by now that would be a much warmer welcome at this stage.

Again, the experience once inside made me forget about my initial annoyance.  This is a great dining and entertainment experience and fits perfectly with what Vegas is all about.  I will definitely be looking for an opportunity to go to minibar in DC after this experience.",-eQGJR-tbTOJQ5uEISh57w,1,1,5,Cc78wd4aaSvwh1DWnWyy7A

Started with frozen Gin and Tonic, hated gin, but I love it now.   Where E feels better than all, is that you have a host that takes you thru the dinner and wine/cocktail/beer pairings.  The atmosphere was so comfortable that the entire evening was an event as opposed to dinner.  At anytime you can talk to the people plating the food, and talk to the host, and they felt so comfortable with you as their guests, it was like you were at your friends house for dinner.   The only pretentious thing may be the other diners and with groups of 8 only twice nightly you should be in good company.

Furthermore, when I returned to the latter in subsequent visits, they were relative disappointments as well, compared to the first two dinners I had there , back in 2005 & 2006, when it first opened. That was before Robuchon sold out like all the other celebrity chefs, and started opening branches all over the globe, moving his best people onto the next new venture, once the latest one is established!
Not to digress further, I thought the 16 course dinner @ e' was poorly conceived and executed! They should either have two seatings, like they do, and serve only 10 courses, and may be charge less, to attract a wider audience, or settle for one open seating like Robuchon does, or at least did, and charge more to cover the cost, so one can really slowly savor the nuances of the 16 courses, assuming they are deservingly of it!
At e', while the 16 course dinner lasted well over 2 hours,  you feel like you are being herded around like helpless cows, moving from one course to the next, with hardly time to savor the individual dish, before your taste buds got overwhelmed by the next. On the latter subject, I did not think the courses were that creative and memorable either. As one of the other reviewers put it well, they aimed to be exotic and unique, but failed in being delicious at the same time! 
I had better dinners at Bazaar, Jose' other franchise at LA, for one third the cost, and come out each time more satisfied. Better yet, you will get even better service and more creative, bolder dishes at Michael Voltaggio's Ink, who was the chef @ Bazaar, before he decided to leave to write his own culinary chapter .
If you are stuck  in Vegas, and yet want to be pampered with a truly great dining experience, accompanied by superlative service, then my vote has to go to Pierre Gagnier's Twist @ the Mandarin Oriental!
In conclusion, e' is not bad, but you can simply do better, for the sake of your wallet or taste buds, or both, not to mention the pursuit of mere simple dining pleasure, by going elsewhere!",0pOtdueu5TpKd4Amf06WwA,2,1,3,EN59Q6MwE0vUmX0ezShm3A

Therefore, when we came here the second time, we kept our expectation low feeling like they would not be able to do any better than the first time. Somehow, they were able to wow us again with almost a different menu! Some of the dishes from 2011 were just creative not tasty for us. In the 2012 version, we had absolutely no complaints on every single dish. I usually don't write reviews unless the dining experience is really good or really bad. E is for sure a winner and we re looking forward to go there again once they change heir menu again. Bring your date there to impress.

3218166,2012-03-15,3,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"I'm so very torn on how to review Jaleo. Yelp! When will you give us half stars???!!!

I think 3.5 or 3.75 is more accurate for me.  I've been here three times now and have had vastly different experiences in terms of service and of food. I wouldn't go so far as to say the place is inconsistent (although that wouldn't be a surprise as it is in The Cosmopolitan-the Kings of Inconsistency), but the food flavors and preparation are vastly different from dish to dish. The price is sometimes off-putting for what you get; it is Vegas though...

If you go for dinner and want to order wine, the server will leave his ipad-wine list with you; it's cool. I still like someone who can discuss wines with me a bit more than our server could.

To keep it light and casual, Jim G. and I grabbed some snacks in the bar a couple times. That's how tapas is really done in Spain, anyway. Two different bartenders on the two nights we went. Both were cool, although one was slammed (and apparently short-staffed) so he was not the kindest; service was fine though. 

During our dinner visit we tried the Monkfish: I strongly suggest you stay away from this dish!!! One of the best dishes I've had ever was monkfish in Paris, so I figured I'd give this dish a try. Oh My! It was fishy, it was sour-ish, it was not good. I mentioned that to the server; he was uninterested.  We also tried some paella; it looked so great cooking at the Paella station that we had to. I didn't think it was that awesome. It was done well, but the flavors were uninteresting to me.

Things that are good/ok:
Gambas al Ajillo: Hard to do this one wrong; nice garlic/butter sauce
Huevos Fritos con Caviar: If the egg were a bit less cooked and there was a dash of additional flavor or texture, this might have been perfect.
Canelones de cerdo: Pork and Foie Gras canelones with bechamel sauce. This was good, but again, I expected bolder flavors. it could have been amazing, but fell short of that.

Ultimately, my review of Jaleo isn't stellar. What I do like is the energy in this place. I like the decor. I like what the Chef is trying to do. I think a lot of people will enjoy the less-than-traditional ingredients and the attempts at bold flavors. It's a blessing and a curse that I've eating amazing meals in fascinating places; I expect a lot. I would still prefer to be smashed up against a bar with slightly warm wine or Mahou beer enjoying the bold flavors if tapas in Madrid than in any of the US restaurants where I've tried tapas. They try, as Jaleo does, but the food still leans a bit too American for me. 

You see why I'm torn? Temper your expectations, and I think you might like it a lot here =)",-lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw,3,2,4,J3t4HVc6TosXTW9LdWATkg

The food was more unique and interesting than delicious. The drinks piled up on each other so instead of being paired they became muddled together over 3-4 of the courses. Yes, the courses! 24 of them actually. Many just a single bite.

This should have been a 3-4 hour experience but was crammed into 2 hours and 15 minutes because they have to fit a second seating in. Seatings are at 5:30 and 8:30.

We have had the tasting menus with paired wines for each diner at Picasso at the Bellagio and Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The food, the taste, the time given to enjoy and savor, the opportunity to compete the course and accompanying drink really were perfect. Dinner at each was all of four hours. You were not rushed and each distinct presentation were really outstanding. When the course and drink were completely finished, we had time to appreciate what we just enjoyed before the next course and pairing came. Dinner for 2 at Picasso was $600. and $800. at Joel Robuchon. We walked out without any doubt that it was worth the money. An obscene amount in today's world but extremely memorable.

To be honest, I was disappointed in é by José Andrés. The presentation was really great but not as engaging as it could've been. The chefs could barely be heard and the courses were not really explained in a manner that you felt you could grasp. We had to ask over and over what it was that was being presented. We felt rushed and the courses came too quickly. If we had 4 hours, maybe the experience would have been savored more. Instead it was a jumble and a muddle of tastes and drinks. I really did not feel that the meal was worth half of what we paid mostly because of the timing.

If you've had some of the chef's tasting menus at the other stellar places in Las Vegas, then try this. If not, it would not be at the top of my short list due to the excessive cost and the rushed feeling.",bvGrZggjxWlmNgG8OrQMaA,20,3,3,9GA6WNn7TGP4m2I117O58A

We really enjoyed the way you check in at Jaleo, and are taken back to a separate dining room with a counter for only 8 people.  It's creeepy dark but not too dark to take pictures which they allow.  One of us did the platinum pairing and one of us did the other pairing.  Guess who the lucky one was?  If you're going to try something once, and you can swing the extra for the platinum, it's so worth it.   I tried some amazing wines that are rare but such an experience.  The presentation of each dish was like a graceful performance in a fancy show.  We were mesmerized by each small plate.  The cocktails they slip in throughout the meal are crazy!  Here have this ball on a spoon, bam!  You just had a cava mojito with a hint of lime....what?  
We relished every dish and every sip of this meal.  
It's hard to explain all 24 courses because it's not just flavor, it's a feeling, experience, mood altering, seeing is believing show.  Truffle cotton candy?  yum...

3350079,2012-01-11,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"We came for dinner on the Friday before Christmas and it was a cool experience. First of all, you can only get a reservation by e-mail at midnight PST 30 days before you want to go. Those are a lot of rules for eating in Las Vegas, but it was worth it. There are only 8 seats and we were able to get 6 of them. The whole experience is 3 hours and it was pretty cool.

We started with a frozen gin and tonic, which had a weird flavor. There was lime and citrus but the gin and tonic were frozen into an ice ball. Snacks were up next and the first dish was called Flower, which was a raspberry purée and petals made of raspberry. It looked cool and tasted cool and was served on a plate that was shaped like Jose Andres' hand. Then came the beet ring, which was a very delicate ring that had beet flavor with gold specks on top. I'm not sure what would possess someone to create a beet ring but it was good. My favorite snack was the Chicaronnes, which were honey glazed and perfectly crunchy. 

The appetizer portion of the meal was next. The first dish was called the Gypsy's arm, which was a green apple and blue cheese meringue. The meringue was light and fluffy but the blue cheese and apple were tart. Then came the nitrogen almond cup, which was topped with caviar. They then served crispy chicken skin with escabeche sauce and topped with thyme foam. The skin was perfect and the foam was thymy (which is probably not a word but should be). The jamon Iberico topped with caviar was salty, fatty and great. The meat was perfectly cured and with the caviar, it was a great bite. The coolest looking appetizer was Ferran Adria's olive. It was an olive purée with a membrane on outside and olive liquid on the inside. The final appetizer was the bocata del calamari, which was a fried uni sandwich with cucumber. The sandwich was delicious.

Our next molecular alcoholic drink was a white sangria made with cava that came in a membrane. It reminded me of the olive, except alcoholic and very strong.

Next our show moved on to the dinner portion of the menu. We started with an artichoke purée, which were artichoke hearts topped with black truffles and an artichoke purée. This dish was good, but the truffles were amazing. Next came the lobster, which was fresh and cooked perfectly and served with a side jasmine foam and citrus fruits. The chickpea stew had a rich and fatty base and had chickpeas made of chickpea essence with a membrane on outside to make the essence into a chickpea shape. The mushrooms in paper were served with rosemary foam, white truffle topping. There were chanterelle and porcini mushrooms cooked in a rich and creamy broth, topped with rosemary foam. This dish was great. Next came the turbot plate. The turbot was cooked perfectly with crispy skin on one side and tender fish. There was also bone marrow in puff pastry topped with caviar. This was an awesome compliment to the fish. Next came the salt baked foie gras. When I ate it, I thought to myself, ""This is how food should taste all the time"". It was perfect. The last main course was an Iberico ham steak with squid a la pancha and parsley air. The pork was chewy and had a nice taste. The squid and sauce were great.

Finally we had the desserts and cheeses. The cheese was called torta de la Serena and was served with toasted bread and a sweet sauce. Next we had flan with oranges and ice, which was a light dessert as most of it was ice. The oranges were bitter but the ice added texture to the dish.There was and edible flower and a caramel on the flan. There was a panko un chocolate, which was crunchy, creamy, bread and chocolate together. The arroz con leche was cold rice pudding with a sticky outside. A great treat was the chocolate truffle, which was chocolate on outside but truffles on inside. This was pretty light and very tasty. Finally we had the 25 second bis coco, which was light and springy and the citrus paper which was crunchy and sour.

The meal was expensive, the service was spectacular, and the setting was intimate. If you get a reservation, you should go. It is worth every penny.",hOzOTyBQHk4WXmiTGaOy4Q,3,0,5,oVUz5f1OXaLi9KpFps3Guw
3356449,2015-09-24,3,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"All in all, a great experience with food that tasted good. Not everything hit it out of the ball park, but everything was packed with flavor. So many times you get a tasting menu at a fancy schmancy restaurant, and you end up feeling like you are tasting concepts rather than good, flavorful food. There is none of that here. While there are cooking techniques that are more avant garde, this isn't the sense that you walk away with. Instead, you get a sense that these techniques were used to augment the flavor of the food rather than to demonstrate technical proficiency. The standouts of the night were the vermouth mussels, black cod that was served with a fantastic sauce and the wagyu ribeye (which is likely the best steak I've had outside of a proper steakhouse and seriously makes me want to try Bazaar Meat at the SLS hotel) but likely you will have a different experience when you go.

My wife and I shared one wine pairing which featured Spanish wines which went well with the meal. Being a light weight, even sharing one wine pairing left me dazed with my ears ringing by the time I left the restaurant. So, if you are a light weight, it may not be the best option for you.

We had previously tried Jaleo (inside which é by José Andrés resides) and were not very impressed (even the paella seemed lackluster), but we were very happy with the meal and experience here. Yes, it is on the expensive side of things, forcing us to subsist on bread and water for the ensuing two months, but you do get a view of Spanish food through the mind of Jose Andres. I would recommend bypassing Jaleo, going directly to é and then learn to really enjoy stale bread afterwards (butter, ketchup and mayonnaise go a long way toward revitalizing that leftover bread).

A word of caution, however. We were in a sitting where everyone seemed to want to demonstrate that they were ""foodies"". One woman could not stop commenting how everything was the best thing she has ever had, all the while trying to drop hints at how much she knows about food and all of her previous conquests. She even did her best to replicate Meg Ryan's scene from When Harry Met Sally when she was eating the ham and cheese sandwich.

I brought the item to the managers attention and they profusely apologized and gave me 10 coupons for free meals. Ok cool. At least they tried. 

Just had dinner at é tonight. Before I rant - the chefs, the service was attentive and friendly. The ambiance was interesting. However during one of the courses - which was a cheese and ham mini sandwich - I bit
Into this scrumptious piece and pulled a piece of plastic from my teeth. Must be my luck in Vegas. The staff apologized and told me that they would take care of me in some way. 

Fast forward - I spent over $800 on dinner plus wine pairings for 2 and I did not see any service to reflect any apologetic gesture. Not a smack on the staff but if we're supposed to be treated to a magical meal - this was definitely not it. 

Most of the latter courses were salty and not refined - i wouldn't have minded the saltiness but to spend that much without any gesture to apologize for a basic mistake by a high end restaurant is rediculous.

We got the wine pairings with it, which was probably unnecessary in hindsight. None of the pairings were bad, but they were not memorable either. 

One thing to note is that the meal is served in private room on a bar counter. It makes for good direct interaction with the chefs and fellow diners, but if it's not the environment you are looking for, this may not be for you.

A place where food meets art, and every night, one of the best shows in Vegas starts.  Chefs take the place of performers, and the kitchen becomes the center stage.  And only those who posses a golden ticket may enter....

é by José Andrés

A ""restaurant-inside-a-restaurant"", the mastermind behind this culinary curiosity is none other than superstar chef/restaurateur José Andrés.  Part genius, part madman, he is a master at creating new flavor combinations and re-imagining classics with the use of space-age gadgets more suited for the lab than the kitchen.  

Guests are not just entering a room, but an exclusive sneak peek inside Andrés' mind.  If one were to ever wonder how a mad genius' mind would look like, this would be it.  In Andrés case, his mind is a larger-than-life card catalog - filled not with the Dewey decimal system, but an eclectic mix of amusing and whimsical objects that have shaped and influenced Jose Andrés culinary vision.  

The show begins literally with the offering of José's hand by the night's master of ceremonies Chef Cody Jeffs.

Created from a mold of Andrés' actual hand, in the ""palm"" of the life-sized appendage is a delicate ""clavel"" flower whose billowy petals are shaped from dried raspberry puree. 

Eating is just part of the fun.  The real performance is watching the team of skilled chefs masterfully assembled all twenty-two courses.  Like a carefully orchestrated routine, everyone knows his or her part.  Foams are whipped, and liquid nitrogen flows freely as dish after dish is put together right in front of the guests to see.

With only eight guests per seating, the ""third wall"" between chef/performer and audience disappears.  Guests are not merely by-standers, but encouraged to interact with the chefs and ask questions.

Good food, of course, should be paired with good wine, and here the experience is just as interactive...especially served from a porrón - a Spanish drinking vessel that requires a little skill or else, if not careful, the drinker could be drenched in wine.

I was anticipating this meal weeks prior. In order to get reservations you need to send an email (reserve@ebyjoseandres.com) up to 1 month in advance. They only serve 8 people per seating and have only 2 seatings per night (5:30pm and 8:30pm).  About a week prior you should receive your golden tickets for entry to the ""show"". Trust me ,it won't disappoint!

The staff is extremely friendly and well trained. On arrival we were quickly greeted at the entry of Jaleo restaurant. The host, Stephanie, explained the drink options, and left us while we went through the wine menu ( on an iPad). Once our drinks were ordered, she escorted us to a private room where a semi circle table of 8 seats is located. During the meal you enjoy watching the Chefs plate your meal! This is quite an experience, especially because they use many Molecular Gastronomic techniques. The chefs are very precise and meticulous with every dish. In additional to the chef there are 2 additional servers who take care of removing plates after every dish, refilling water, and switching out wine glasses. Service is excellent! Everyone is very attentive and knowledgeable about the cooking methods and wine pairings. There were so many tidbits that I cannot possibly remember everything they told me.

While dining I definitely suggest you try on of the paring options. They have a non-alcoholic pairing ($55) and a traditional wine pairing ($110). Both are very interesting. My mom get the non-alcoholic parings and they very cool. Many of the drinks try to mimic actual alcoholic drinks! I personally ordered the regular wine pairings and though it was a amazing. My favorite was drinking out of a porron (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porron), which was definitely a unique experience. Even if you choose not to do the wine pairings, don't worry a couple drinks are included in the meal. In fact, everyone got two gin and tonic drinks which were prepared very differently.

The food was amazing. Overall there were 20+ dishes. I'd have to say everything was very good. A few of my favorites were the lobster, the iberico ham and the mushrooms in cream sauce. While the food tasted very good, a HUGE part of the experience is enjoying the plating and unique cooking methods. The chefs are very talented and are familiar with cooking methods which are not traditionally taught at culinary school. One of the chefs, Mia, even said that she has learned cooking methods at E which were not taught at the Culinary Institue of America. One of my favorite methods was Spherification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherification), in which the use a calcium and an alginate bath to form spheres from liquids. These liquid spheres resemble caviar, but are filled with a flavorful burst when eaten. It is techniques like this that make this a truly memorable experience.

E is one of my top dining experiences. I'd say overall I enjoyed the food at French Laundry more, but the show at E is like no other. Alinea uses some similar cooking techniques, however at E you get to enjoy watching the chefs preform the art of plating!",3hWhXTkU83jsm3jIA-rkIg,7,6,5,hYPVC1ozqP0kQT5F-47ArQ

Their menu is always intimidating because of the number of dishes available, so instead of debating which to order we opted for a tasting menu. Similar to an omakase, we left the decision making in the hands of our waiter and the kitchen, although we mentioned a couple specific items that we wanted. Our waiter said it would be about $50 per person for the food.

What followed was a gluttonous feast of about 13 dishes plus two desserts that were almost all amazing. Our meal consisted of:

Pan con tomate (2 orders) - toasted slices of crispy bread brushed with fresh tomato
Three queso (2) - cheese platter
Jamon serrano (3) - 18-month salt-cured ham
Espinacas (2) - sauteed spinach, pine nuts, raisins and apples
Bruselas de jamon (2) - warm brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and serrano ham
Gambas al ajillo (2) - shrimp sauteed with garlic
Pulpo a feira (2) - boiled octopus with potatoes, pimenton and olive oil
Mejillones al vapor (1) - steamed mussels with bay leaf, lemon and olive oil
Calamares tinta (2) - seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onions
Carne asada (2) - grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit
Codorniz Catalan (2) - grilled whole quail with apple puree and pinenuts
Ensalada Malaguena (1) - traditional salad from malaga of Spanish cod, oranges, potato and black olives
Paella Iberico (1) - made with the ribs of Iberico pigs
Flan (1) - classic Spanish flan with espuma of Catalan cream and oranges
Pan con chocolat (1) - chocolate cake with hazelnut praline ice cream and salted caramel sauce

The spinach dish sounds simple but the flavors that they were able to coax out of those common ingredients was unforgettable. Even if you're not a fan of those leafy greens chances are you'll love it. Other favorites were the mussels (much better than the previous time I had them), quail, and the squid, a dish as beautiful as it was delicious.

I could probably list all as my favorites because each was well executed. Some caught our attention with bold and complex flavors while others were more subtle, yet just as refined. It was an excellent mix that showcased the ingredients and the chefs' skills. The relaxed pace of the meal (about two and a half hours) gave us plenty of time to appreciate each dish and try plenty of cocktails and sangria.

After it was all said and done, we walked out spending about $120 a person (including alcohol, tax and tip). For an outstanding meal on the Strip that's more than reasonable.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,7,5,gbCHWSVIjTBdYvoXhcoX7w

We started our night making our way through the plush and glitzy Cosmopolitan lobby and casino. We definitely will need to come back and check out more. When arriving at Jaleo we told them we had reservations at E, which is the restaurant within the restaurant at Jaleo. 

Being 1 of 16 dining there that night (two seatings of 8) their attention went immediately to us. The last group was still finishing up so the manager brought us a nice bubbly glass of Cava while we waited. That nice touch was a great sign of what to come. 

After our table was ready we were escorted back with the other 6 to our table hidden in another room behind the bar. As we were led through the packed Jaleo dinning room we got a lot of those ""how are they getting that treatment"" looks. We arrived at our half moon shaped bar with a swanky and modern feel. 

This is where the AMAZING service started. Flat or sparkling? My first thought is Vegas's finest will work for me because I'm not a water snob, but then I realized everything is included I went with the sparkling. We were introduced to the staff and I enjoyed the casual environment making it easy to communicate with the chefs as they prepared the food in front of us. The service throughout the night was just perfect and I think I enjoyed that more than the food! 

So here is the deal... 
$250 includes about 20 courses, wine pairing throughout, tax, gratuity, and oh yes your choice of water   ; ) 

Time to get on the 2+ hour food and wine train! 

Unfortunately I do not have the details on the wine, but know I'm more of a wine snob than a water one and the wines were mostly whites and on the sweet side. Not my cup of tea but it may be yours. 

The food... 
- Frozen Sangria with Grilled Strawberries: Very strong but really refreshing 
- Beet Jewelry: Sweet and salty beet ""ring"" in a jewelry box. Cool idea and a nice balance of flavor. 
- Caramelized Pork Rinds: Need I say more. If you like Pork Rinds you'll love them, if you don't we'll love them! 

BATHROOM BREAK STOP THE PRESSES! They literally stopped serving, escorted me to the bathroom, and waited until I returned. Good thing I'm fast! 

- Jose Taco & Artichoke with Caviar: Jamon Iberico (best ham in the world from Spain) in a ""taco"" with caviar. Paired with caviar and quail egg on a mini artichoke. One of the best of the night. 
- Other stars of the 20 dishes: Smoky Oysters in Escabeche and the Secreto of Imberico Pork. 
- Biggest disappointment was the Foie Gras Baked in Salt. Such promise and I almost never push away Foie Gras but this one was bastardized with a bunch of orange type juice poured on top. 

All in all I enjoyed the service more than the food. Most of the dishes were on the sweet side and didn't have a balance. Of course that is up to the individual's taste and for the price I will be a harsh critic. 

This place is definitely worth a try. At a minimum for the cool and fun experience alone. The innovative food will not disappoint and hey enjoy you are in Vegas!",0QdwQLVxZpgy9Qb2Qakflw,6,5,4,nJbEtA3MqkCnQutg9uLC_g

This is a prime example of what you look for when you really love food and want a different experience. I could wax poetic about all the nuances and details of this but whats the point? It was freaking amazing and an experience that I am so very glad I had.

Here are some of the details - to get a better idea of things you just have to look at the pics!

Edible Sangria - great but this was probably the lowest point of the meal - but perhaps that was by design?

Beet and Machengo Cheese
Cheese ""stone""
Spanish Pizza
""Wonder Bread""  with Foie Gras and Black Truffle - this was one of the best!!
Iberico
Cava white sangria spherification _ another truly mind blowing bite!
Iberico Lardo
Asparagus Esciveche air surf clam salsa verde
Dungeness Crab and Spanish soffritto with crab broth
Foie black truffle and Kishu Tangerine
Fluke
Foie Gras cotton candy Emanada - LOVE!!!!
Hazlenut creme ricotta snow and honey glee with brioche crouton
Walnut creme fraiche grape, strawberry creme.

The wine pairing were flawless and very much Spanish.

This is not at all an inexpensive meal. For two with wine pairings and tip it is over $1000. It doesn't freaking matter. If you are a food nerd or are just looking for a really great experience, you have to get this!

Two of the other really great parts to this - when you check in, you are brought to a private room to wait for the rest of the party and for the kitchen to be set. You sit back have a drink and get to visit with your other diners. When you are brought in the service ration is 6 to 8!! 4 Chefs and 2 Servers for 8 guests! It is really really special!

It was a great ""show"" and an amazing meal and I would do it again for sure! Also, it helped having a really great group of diners and made the overall event more fun!",lBd6FqA-nBgMovYDL3SsyQ,13,5,5,VsU9ovPGaehIMCiRXHCBZQ

Jaleo, Zaytinia, and Oyamel are good and fine, but I wanted Fine (yes, with a capital F) dining at a José Andrés establishment only because I know what he's capable of.

Enter: é by José Andrés 

With reservations ready a month prior (through email only), you're mailed a golden ticket (http://bit.ly/1g047aD) with which you present to the hostess upon arrival. When everyone else is present, you're taken into the back room to be fed. In this space, it's just you and seven others. We opted for the beverage pairings (because duh) and began the adventure:

+Rebujito (a perfect way to begin the meal: a nitrogen-frozen orange blossom ice cube in a manzilla sherry. Refreshing!): http://bit.ly/1hAphqE
+Apple ""brazo de gitano"" (a light, melt-in-your-mouth, airy meringue filled with blue cheese): http://bit.ly/1kPzWjy
+Nitro almond cup (a liquid nitrogen-frozen cup made from marcona almond purée, filled with an almond foam and topped with caviar): http://bit.ly/1kSC9cW
+Bar quillo (a wafer cookie tube piped with a ""whipped cream"" blend of truffles and anchovies. Weird, but good--like everything else we were served): http://bit.ly/1ouuogW
+""El vermut"" (clams with liquid olives that exploded with briny deliciousness): http://bit.ly/1isOBD7
+""Merienda"" (basically a ham and cheese sandwich that I'd have no problem eating 76 of): http://bit.ly/1isOCHc
+Cono de la serena (opted out of the crispy chicken skin en escabeche [http://bit.ly/RrCFr8] and was offered this cheese and quince paste cone. That cheese was STUH-WRONG. Whoa.): http://bit.ly/1ouuuoF
+Cava Sangria (the perfect palate cleanser of booze that bursts in your mouth): http://bit.ly/1obgZwY Shots! Shots! Shotshotshotshots!
+""Fabes"" con jamon (white beans and ham in a clear broth with two different types of garlic on the side of the bowl that you scrape onto your spoon with each bite): http://bit.ly/1obh041
+Lobster with citrus and jasmine (ran out of catchy names there, eh, José? Poached lobster with jasmine foam): http://bit.ly/1srpnIo
+""Kokotxas"" al pil-pil (cod jowl in a squid ink sauce): http://bit.ly/1j7n2uE
+Rosemary wild mushroom en papillote (opted out of the foie gras with poop-smear [http://bit.ly/Rvj7BL] and was served this deliciousness; essentially mushrooms in its own sauce. It was heavenly!): http://bit.ly/1s7ITaB
+Secreto of ibérico pork and squid (ibérico ham with squid in a parsley foam. That squid was divine): http://bit.ly/1qj8rWM
+Torta ta pascualete with cotton candy (liquid nitrogen-cooled goat cheese soup, with a compressed cotton candy wafer): http://bit.ly/1isOYNX
+Créma Catalana egg (Spanish crème brûlée topped with an egg yolk, puffed rice, candied mandarin orange bits, served with honey): http://bit.ly/RrD24M
+Pan con chocolate (Frozen chocolate powder, sweet bread, olive oil, and salt. Tasted exactly like a dark chocolate cake. 1. Drag your spoon up the chocolate, through the olive oil, 2. shovel into your mouth, 3. take sips of the Ron Cremaut, AKA boozy coffee): http://bit.ly/1jl5Zdw
+25-second bizcochi (spongy deliciousness. How did they make this in the microwave?! It was so soft, I wanted to give it kisses before chomping down on it. Is that weird? That's weird.): http://bit.ly/1obhgQA
+Ferrero Rocher (a random medley of chocolates, including an awesome fizzy chocolate.): http://bit.ly/RrD0tZ

The experience begins with a Golden Ticket delivered to your home. Once you arrive at the restaurant, Jaleo, inside The Cosmopolitan, you're taken back to a secret dining room and seated at a semi-circle table. You meet the chefs and they tell you what to expect. Then the fun begins and you get to watch them add the final touches to each inspired course as it comes out. 

No detail is overlooked!  Food is served on a miniature couch, in a pizza box, inside a ring box, on a fan and more. At the end of the meal you're presented with a menu so that you can fondly remember each course that you just enjoyed.  What a grand experience!  For two foodies like Phil B n I, this was truly a slice of heaven!

I'll echo all of the other stellar reviews.  We nearly missed our reservation due to a flight cancellation and subsequent flight delay.  I kept in e-mail contact with e throughout the day to inform them of our situation.  Luckily we cruised in with just enough time to start with the first food course (missed the first beverage course, the gin and tonic).  

My favorite courses were the artichoke puree, the chickpea stew with iberico ham, the turbot with bone marrow (the bone marrow might be the richest, most ""umami"" flavor to ever exist on this earth!) and the rosemary wild mushrooms en papillote.  Desserts were awesome - loved the bread pudding and the flan!

We both ordered the alcoholic pairings but in hindsight, I would've done the non-alcoholic and shared with my husband so we could have tried more.  A few of the diners at our time did this and the NA drinks looked pretty cool.  I'm not huge on sherry so that was a little weird for me having it early in the meal, but I did enjoy the other pairings.

Only negative is that we weren't given a whole lot of information from the chefs about the dishes until we asked - like, they would almost just state the very basic name of the dish from the menu and nothing else, leaving out major components that we would have to ask about (i.e. - what is this green sauce made out of, what's in the bottom of this pasty).  Once asked they provided the info, but it'd be nice to have a little more up front about each dish.

Definitely go if you can swing it!",Xbwn5FyUSQRdHGkdbQXTcQ,4,1,5,eVHP-NIXeBsDDoeGgwg_YA
3663067,2013-05-30,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"I loved the Bazaar by José Andrés in Los Angeles, Ca and my fiancee thought it would be a nice surprise to reserve an experience here at é by José Andrés. I must admit that I was glad to experience and was amazed by the technicality and the attention to detail that must be placed into these dishes. At some point I was getting a little anxious to try the dish since it took awhile for them to prep each dish. Overall, I prefer Bizarre (before the foie gras banned in Cali) over é just because the dishes had more spectacular flavors. This place is a must try since you are getting a 2 in 1 package (performance and meal). 

After we arrived at the front desk of Jaleo, they sat us in the Jaleo restaurant until the group of 8 people that we ate with all arrive and then they walk us into a small intimate hidden room. The  room has a half circle table with chairs facing toward the center where the chefs prepare the meals. One main chef speaks to you throughout the meal and answers any questions about the dishes or anything else. 

23 Dishes experienced: (favorites***) (fyi - your dishes might vary a little if you do not drink alcohol)

rebujito/limonada - similar to other drinks at other José Andrés restaurant, where it is prepared in liquid nitrogen, the drink tasted like a slushy

truffle cotton candy*** - self explanatory but truffle enhances the cotton candy

idiazabal ""macaron""*** - almond flavor goodness

apple ""brazo de gitano"" - looks/feels like a foam cylinder which taste like apple

nitro almond cup*** - delicate dish that must be gobbled up in less than 1 min or else it will melt in your hands, this dish has caviar in the cup

barquillo

mejillones in escabeche - muscles in a foam sauce

""merienda""*** - ""afternoon lunch"" that is made of bread and strong goat cheese

cripsy chicken skin en escabeche*** - piece of chicken skin fried and topped with foam 

cava sangria/sandria - sangria encapsulated in an egg shape or watermelon with juices

artichoke ""puree"" w/ vanilla - artichoke in the shape of a meatball with delicious puree

lobster w/ citrus & jasmine - self explanatory

""fabes"" con jamon"" - puree of beans that is encapsulated in a thin sheet with ham broth

""kokotxas"" al pil-pil - codfish throat with squid ink 

whole lobe of foie gras baked in salt*** - delicate way of cooking foie gras where you can hardly taste the fattiness of the foi gras and I prefer pan seared foie gras since it brings out more flavor 

secreto of iberico pork w/ squid*** - pork shoulder from porks that build 40% of body fat from eating acorn, the crunchiness of the squid tentacles complemented the dish well

torta pascualete w/ cotton candy - strong goat cheese flavor with sweet flavors

flan - orange flavor incorporated with the flan

pan con chocolate*** - my favorite dish of all time, the salt added to the dish was a little too much but this simple dish  with ingredients (cocoa powder and olive oil) that have not been cooked or modified with temperature just comes together in your mouth to make an mouthgasmic experience

""arroz con leche""*** - sugar cone with rice and milk

cocoa paper w/ dried strawberry - self explanatory

25 second bizcocho

With this being said...let me say that Jaleo did not disappoint! The food was delicious and truly met all my expectations. While at é I was offered an amazing wine, which I was disappointed was no longer on the menu. BUT... Nelson our server presented me with an equally amazing glass of white wine and my disappointed was quickly turned to complete satisfaction. We also ordered sangria which was filled of so many refreshing and crisp flavors. The sangria is a complete MUST have! Now on to the food. 

Not really a fan of bruschetta but the Pan de cristal con tomate has me rethinking my dislike of soggy tomato sauce on a over toasted bread. This was such a fresh, crisp and clean tasting tomato sauce over a perfectly toasted sliced of bread which I enjoyed with manchego cheese and this pairing was perfect. We did a few cheese pairing (equally delicious), the vegetable paella (which I was not to excited about but surprised was DELICIOUS), and pollo al ajillo which went perfect with the vegetable paella. The Mini pepito de ibérico are nothing less than addicting! We started with 2 and then 3 and then we had to stop because we could have ordered 12 more. Perfect little sliders with so much flavored packed into each bite. 

Yes, many may complain about the menus prices. But I would argue that point by saying you get what you pay for. The food is great and not one complaint here about the prices.

Started off with one of the best gin and tonic drinks I have ever had.  We then ordered a series of tapas and was once again delighted course after course.

One slight criticism, we ordered the Jamon Belotta Fermin and it was sort of a dump of sliced jamon all mangled together. Still tasty but the slices should have been laid out for easy eating. No big deal but worth mentioning in case management is reading.

Finallly, the night came, I really couldn't contain my excitement for what was about to happen. We were led passed the bar area into another room. It was very quaint, dark and had a Spanish vibe to it. We were introduced to the culinary team. Cody, the sous chef was really good at explaining what dishes they were plating, and what we could expect when tasting the food. 

Out of the 20 tastings, a couple really stood out for me, #1 Lobster with Citrus & Jasmin, #2 Secreto Iberico Pork with Squid. My favorite dessert was the Pan con Chocolate. Two of my least favorites were the Foie Gras and the Fabes con Jamón, both were so salty I didn't finish either one.

There was a couple that showed up 20+ minutes late for dinner, so we thought maybe they were trying to make up for that time, but not cool to punish the rest of us. 

Reason for my 4 star rating? Everything was good, but it definitely wasn't mind blowing. Dinner, wine pairing and tax and service charge came to $416 a person. It just didn't match up. I didn't think what I had was worth it. Like I said, I didn't leave mind blown.

Reservations used to be tough to come by, but now manageable if you reserve on Tock a week in advance. Seatings are either at 5:30 or 8:30 pm. Over the course of 7 years, the small intimate dining experience has expanded an extra seat to accommodate 9. They still try to make it feel super exclusive by mailing you your golden ticket (a la Willy Wonka). 

Guests await their dining experience at a communal table at the front of Jaleo. While waiting, the waitress alerts us that the flowers in front of us are actually edible. And thus begins our food journey: Branches of the Desert treats us to kalamata olive stick branches with edible wild flowers. As soon as we finish munching on our branches, we are quickly whisked away to the back of Jaleo where we are seated around curved counter. We have front row seats to a kitchen stage that will soon play host to a night of molecular gastronomy and a little magic. The room is filled with library catalog cabinets, amongst other things, representing the mind of chef José Andrés. We start with a hand that offers us a warm towel filled with rosemary and other herbal scents. 

Appetizers come out at a rapid pace starting with a play on sangria, made flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Entitled ""The perfect bite,"" it features a cocktail of cherry pearls, fresh mint, red wine sangria, and compressed watermelon. Each plate is delicately and meticulously created with forceps and precision tools. Next comes a trio of cheese courses, appropriately named: beet rose (beet and manchego rose on a walnut raisin wafer), stones (Idiazabal cheese glazed in jamon iberico fat and rosemary oil), and a Spanish pizza margarita ( San Simon crema, freeze dried tomatoes). Each one is inventive, ingenius, and technically perfect. Next comes perhaps my favorite dish of the night: Wonder Bread (apple meringue, foie gras, strawberries). Decadent foie gras mousse and strawberries sandwiched between two meringue shaped like white bread is a play on PB&J. 

After this, the meal becomes a blur. I could go on and on, but I will highlight some of my favorites after the Wonder Bread. This includes:
- Uni and Lardo 
- ""Esparragos Escabeche"" - Holland White Asparagus, Escabeche Air, Sasanian Royal Oseitra Cavia, Frozen Egg Yolks
- ""Txangurro a la Donostiarra"" - Dungeness Crab with Spanish Sofrita, Crab Broth, Toasted Panko Bread Crumbs
- Foie Royale
- ""Fricando"" - Australian Wagyu Beef Cheek, Pine Nuts Praline, Morels, Gnocchi
- ""Empanada"" - Foie Gras and Corn Nuts 

The desserts were mind-blowing:
- ""Miel Y Mato"" - Ricotta, Honey Gelee, Hazelnut Praline, Brown Butter Croutons, Walnut Cream
- ""Intxaursaltsa"" - Walnut Cream, Fresh Cherries, Walnut Praline, Strawberries and Cream
- ""Flan"" - Vanilla Custard, Bitter Caramel, Orange Syrup, Spanish Snow

By the end of our meal, I was left amazed. The menu and everything about the experience was magical. The courses were whimsical as they were technically perfect. I don't often praise fine dining experience as I'm usually left hungry and shocked by the sticker price, but this is one dining experience that was worth every penny.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,18,12,5,GycrpIh4u4k5tu-9VxisBg

Arrive at your predestined time and through a curtain you go into a dimly-lit room lined with cabinets filled with fanciful items of your imagination.

Two chefs, a couple cooks, and servers all work around an open counter to serve a small semi-circle of guests in what seems like a nearly even staff to diner ratio. 

The atmosphere is quaint yet unexpectedly casual as the wine unwinds, and you become fast friends with your neighbors. The chef will also answer questions as she assembles your dish.

The food carries an artistic and experimental element. Some have been deconstructed then constructed, liquefied then emulsified. Familiar flavors will take on a new textures that play with your perception.

As with all art, not everyone will have the same taste; as with all experiments, not every trial will be successful. One of the dishes, squid stuffed with chicken confit, was the single saltiest piece of food I've ever tasted. The main course, ribeye with asparagus, was disappointingly safe and had a piece of sinew I could have lived without.

The dinner totaled at over $800 for 2 with wine pairing and gratuity, but it's hard to place a price on an experience this unique.

Last night's experience was just as good or better than my first time.  There were some dishes that were the same, but many were different.  Sitting in the private room with your fellow diners, watching the chefs put together the courses and watching their meticulous plating work is an incredible experience.  We had only 4 diners last night because the others couldn't keep their reservation due to airline delay.

One of the dishes that I especially like is the dehydrated meringue filled with bleu cheese and topped with praline cream.  This was served both times I was here and it is superb!  One thing new last night was the foie gras baked in salt.  Exceptional when it was served with the citrus juice.

Another dish of note was the crispy chicken skin with two chicken oysters.  Wow, such thin, crisp chicken skin and the wonderful oysters on the skin.  It was a delicate pick up to eat.

One final dish of note, although they almost all are, was the ham and bean soup.  The ham flavor is in the broth and the beans are three large beans created from three kinds of deconstructed beans and reformed into these luscious, soft gems.  Wow!

For anyone who wants to have an exceptional meal, make your reservations via email and do go.  It is pricey, but remember, it is both a show and a great meal all in one.  I'll wager some lose more in a couple hands of blackjack than they'll spend here.

Planning ahead is required, btw. There is no dropping in on the restaurant or phoning in for a reservation - you need to email them directly and hope they have a spot for you. I've been a few times and have never had a problem but just keep in mind that you need to take care of business many weeks/months before you arrive in Vegas. For your troubles you will receive a Willy Wonka-esque golden Admit One ticket in the mail which is nice little touch.

After pre-dinner drinks in the more casual Andres establishment you will be escorted back to the dining bar. There are only a handful of seats per seating and everyone sits at the bar while food is prepared in front of you. It is easily the most fun chef's table experience I've ever had. The overall irreverent and playful tone of the evening also is a huge plus as you won't have to feel self conscious showing ecstasy with your food like you would a stuffier restaurant

The food is mostly phenomenal with a combination of new dishes and a few e classics. Each time I've been there they've had the foie gras donuts which are one of the more surprising treats you'll ever consume - when you take your first bite you'll be expecting something with the taste and texture of a Hostess chocolate donut but instead you'll be treated to some of the melty-ess, savoriest foie gras ever. As great as those are they in no way compare to the other fun foie gras preparation, the cotton candy empanadas; these fluffy, sugary and ever slightly rich delicacies were among the most amazing things I've ever tasted. The clams I've had here have also been among my favorite bites ever, with a slightly vinegary brine that is so much more delicious than I'm making it sound.

What's not to love? I do have to say that each time I've been here they've made quite a spectacle of the wagyu beef course (bringing the giant cuts out for display beforehand) but it's always been a cut below just about every wagyu steak I can remember in my head. There are also occasional dishes that don't work as well as the true standouts - in particular I was not a huge fan of the whole baby octopus!

This said, those are relatively minor complaints on an otherwise spectacular experience. Definitely spend an evening at e if you can hook up a reservation and afford the price tag!",vLQ86H5evCeXqQSoxx_sPQ,7,3,5,SXUBalYMxztcfdMO99xuZQ

Finally, I planned in advance and went on August 22. It was fun and delicious - I would go back - but not as top-notch as it should be for the hype and the price. Also, there are a few things I didn't like about the experience, explained below.

The meal is served in a small dining area back and to the right of the bar. Eight people sit around a small kitchen, where some prep-work is done. I didn't like how dark it was - clearly this was done for mood, but it went beyond the typical mood lighting and was made it difficult to see everything that was going on. I am also not sure how I felt about the seating arrangement. It made dinner conversation a bit awkward (you pretty much don't feel comfortable talking about much other than the food in front of strangers). It was fun to be able to see some of the prep, but the truth is that most of what was done in front of us amounted to plating, pouring sauces, squeezing filling into tubes, etc. I have been to other molecular gastronomy restaurants that do much more theatrical table-side ""shows"" than this restaurant did in a kitchen set up for it, so that was a bit disappointing.

The food was the definite highlight! There were many stand-out courses (like the salt-crusted foie gras, although the portion was tiny compared to the huge mass they brought out to show us before taking it back to the kitchen to cut!). They gave us a lot of really interesting combinations, like chocolate and olive oil, and other savory/sweet combinations - even when the combinations didn't quite work, they were really interesting (but most of them really worked!)

A tip on the beverage pairing: get the lower-end one. I usually do just because I don't think I'm refined enough for it to make a huge difference! However in this case, I was really happy I did. One of the champagnes was served in something similar to a turkish coffee pot - the ones you lift way up high as you pour. We were instructed to do the same as we poured into our mouths. One person at our table ordered the high end pairing, and they served his in a regular champagne glass!

One final complaint: This is nitpicky, but when they brought the bill they made a point of telling us that service was already included (20%), but that we are always allowed to leave more, and it is always appreciated. I always think it is so tacky when they do that! The service actually was really friendly, but that turned me off. (I will note that the service was a bit too formal for my taste, especially when you are already sitting around a kitchen. They plated the dishes and then waited for more waiters to come so that they could serve everything at the exact same time. It seemed to be the opposite of the vibe they were going for.)

I would give the food four stars (delicious, but definitely not as good as other restaurants in the same price bracket, like Alinea), but the overall experience three stars. I would go back.",C2RTNSaPYu_TKvpHxN41YQ,6,0,3,PAKH3aKQNgRTyZuCxsEx6A

Every dish was beyond delicious.  I recall having thoughts like ""This is the best bean I have ever had!"" or ""This is the best calamari I have ever had!"" or ""This is the best ___ I have ever had!"" dish after dish.  Molecular gastronomy is fun, and it takes food preparation onto a whole new level.  I still highly recommend é based on the complexity of flavors though, not based on the creativitiy of the foams, alginates, and other chemical reactions I cease to understand.

Some of the other reviewers commented on the fast pace; I thought the pace was great.  For me, I just want to EAT, so I do not want to wait forever between courses.  For 19 dishes, it took us about 2 1/2 hours to finish.  The couple next to us got the additional wine pairing.  I can see that they were a little rushed to finish chugging their drinks with each course.

My only feedback for é is to talk more about the ingredients and preparations to the guests.  The chefs plated in front of all the guests, but did not explain anything until they finished plating.  During the entire time, all of us were silently thinking, ""What the heck is that now?!""  To make the dinner more interactive, it would be great that the chefs do a little more teaching.

Uni slider - I love uni. You should too.

I noted this to the chefs who were cooking for us that day and asked if any of them started their career just for gastronomy. None of them did. I think this is an important element.

The atmosphere is incredible. The room is cozy and whimsical, and the food is presented with the perfection of a well-choreographed show. I won't go over the whole menu, but some highlights were: 

- the most perfect gin and tonic I have ever had - José's signature drink. It has a compressed ice cube in a perfect sphere, which still hadn't melted by the end of our 3 hour dinner, as well as lemon rind, a lime wheel, juniper berries, and the most imaculately measured top shelf gin imaginable. It was amazing. 

- Freeze dried foie gras with a warm, delicious broth below. The foie gras was so rich and creamy, that when served cold, it was like ice cream. We were encouraged to drag it through the warm broth below, which was the most fun, delicious combination ever. 

- Cotton candy empanadas with foie gras and corn nuts - This was our first bite, and we just knew things were going in an awesome direction. Sweet, savory, creamy, crunchy, awesome. 

- Lobster and citrus, I don't remember the details, but the lobster was perfect and tender, and there were little segments of different citrus fruits to pair bites with. 

- Sangria preparations - the first was our édible sangria - whipped to a thick foamy texture, and dotted with encapsulated sangria, freeze dried raspberries, orange zest, spearment, and liquid nitrogen frozen peach puree spheres. So. Much. Fun. 
The second sangria was an encapsulated cava sangria with pear chunks. You let it slide into your mouth, and it would burst instantly, filling your mouth with a full gulp of sangria. Each diner let out a little cry of delight when the bubble burst, because you can't really prepare yourself for a sudden super-gulp of sangria.

- Lamb soue vide - melted in your mouth. 

Really, everything was amazing. I could do the whole list. BUT it's also worth mentioning that I was able to appreciate menu items that I normally despise. I HATE mussels, but ate three of them at é - and disliked them significantly less than I have in the past. (It's a texture thing) I'm also not a big fan of oysters, but their encapsulated presentation was fun. 

The ONLY note that I have was that I was a little confused about the bill. There is a ""service charge"" of almost $200 for four of us. When the bill was dropped, the server said something about the service charge, but mentioned that we could leave extra for the cooking team. What does that mean exactly? Do you tip again? Does the cooking team get a part of that ""service charge?"" I was totally confused. I snuck a peak at how much my neighboring diners added and followed suit, but I'm not sure if it was enough. 

But anyways, NOTHING was disappointing. I will absolutely be back. The team does an outstanding job, and I sincerely doubt that I will ever top this dining experience. But that doesn't mean I won't try :)",dktCjJYFYroBsuqUGiU_tA,5,2,5,9NU0jMMxeUqBj3kCWguh9g

A tapas restaurant secluded behind the bar of the Jaleo restaurant, on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan.

From the moment you are greeted at Jaleo, where you check in, you are celebrated as a winner of the Willy Wonka golden ticket holder.  You are seated in a table near the bar where you can order a drink, while waiting for the remainder of the the guests to show.  

When all of the guests arrive, you are escorted to a room behind the bar, where there is a food bar where you can see all of the food preparation.  Think of it like seating at a sushi bar where you can see the food prepared.

The staff is busy preparing their first of 18 or so tapas dishes. My wife is an omnivore, but I am a vegan.  They do NOT prepare vegan, so I opted to attend as a vegetarian, which they will accommodate.  Overall, my wife was far more impressed with my food than her's.  There were some subtle substitutions, but the vegetarian looked very similar to the omnivore's dinner.

My favorite dinner drink is a Tanqueray Ten gin martini. So when they completed the meal with a frozen ball of gin as the special guest of honor, I was thrilled. But unfortunately, it was much too sweet for a man who drinks straight alcohol.  Never-the-less, it was a memorable night and one that will not be soon forgotten.

With the meal and the alcohol/wine pairing, dinner was $903.  So, not a happy meal price but a wonderfully, incredible experience.

If you really want to celebrate that special night, here's how to get in.  Send an email enquiring about dinner.  They in turn will give you an email address to send your request 30 days out.  We are in Central time, so at 2 am Central, 12:00 midnight Las Vegas, I sent the request.  The next day, they sent a PDF file to fill out with the participants names.  You fill it out and fax it back to them, along with $195 charge per person.  You put your credit card information on the sheet you are faxing back to them.

Be committed, because you can lose your $195 x 2 charge (if two people attending). But if you're serious, you can be seated.  Plan your trip around the date you want eat e by Jose.",dFD2cL4olBwrDIazw3aS0g,5,2,5,lx072AfM1tlIL49Do76AUQ

It was awesome how there is only a select few of people who go into this little room where you are in front of the chefs who prepare each dish to you. I was amazed on how creative they were on making the food. It was a lot of fun and I highly recommend this place if you are a foodie and appreciate things like this.,j26yxl5XnDOPRGxNNaRanQ,0,0,5,lTajMLDPIZEQY16GiahwtQ

4261705,2015-05-11,2,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"I recently created a unique food bucket list. This place allowed me to cross some items off my list AND provided me with an extraordinary dining experience.

So with that being said, I told my boyfriend about this place ages ago. The good guy that he is, he made reservations 3 months in advance to take me here for my birthday! When the reservations were made, we did not know that it was going to fall on the weekend of Mayweather fight. So, the place was crazy and the other 7 people we dined with were actually there for the fight and were from out of town. 

When we arrived, we were seated at a table to go over our beverage options. As far as the alcohol pairing, we opted out of it. I honestly did not want my taste buds to be under the influence in any way. As the meal progressed,  I saw that the other people at the table seemed overwhelmed with alcohol at times; sitting with 3 glasses and needing to catch up. So I was very happy that we just stuck with water, because I went to eat, not to drink. 

 Here is what my courses were comprised of since they can change:

*Drunken Truffles - presented in a box, these fluffy balls with a dusty exterior were interesting. But honestly, thought the flavors were too much. 
*Branch of the Desert- edible rice cracker centerpieces in cacao nibs. That was so cool and quite tasty.
*Foie Doughnut - this made me think of those fancy dog bakeries were the treats look delectable but actually do not have any sugar because they are for dogs. It was like that because it has sprinkles and you think it is going to be sweet but instead it is savory. It was an interesting dish. 
*Cheese Cracker- I have made these at home before. Nothing too extraordinary but still delicious. 
*Vidrio (potato Glass with anchovy butter) - I really dug the salty anchovy butter and smearing it on the potato glass as the glass itself did not have much of a distinctive flavor. 
*Beet Gazpacho - sort of like an ice cream sandwich. Very unique concept but the beets were too overpowering, so I gave up on this earthy dish. 
*Merienda- a touch of gooey ham and cheese on the inside. My favorite of the first grouping. 
*Clams in Escabeche- foamy clams that I really enjoyed.
*Cheese and Nuts - this was another cheese course, the hazelnut ""caviar"" was delicious and the cheese had a hard sugary exterior. The cheese was deliciously stinky and the scent stayed on my fingers the rest of the night. 
*Cava Sangria - sort of like a jello shot in a ball form. Super fun!
*Ibèrico Chickpeas - very home-style/hearty with the warmth of the soup and little pieces of Iberico. 
*Live scallop with Black Truffles-my favorite of the night! The scallop melted in my mouth and the paired so wonderfully with the earthiness of the black truffles. I could eat this every day if I could. 
*Squid with rosemary foam- beautifully plated. Not always a huge fan of squid personally, but out of the squid I have tasted, this was the best. 
*Fluke with squid ink flakes-the fluke was cooked perfectly, and it was interesting to hear that the squid ink is made into a flakes to create a crust for this fish. 
*Wagyu Beef - delicious and I loved that they had two pieces on the plate, as one of the smaller pieces was more marbled and I died eating that buttery piece. The potato gnocchi was also a perfect accompaniment. 
*Cotton Candy Empanada- such a fun concept and neat to see them come out with a pile of cotton candy. Crunchy surprise in the middle of it made it fun. 
*Santa Gradea-a dish with soft cheese and I believe frozen pomegranate seeds. So much work went into this dish for plating and was then scrambled all together. 
*Créma Catalana Egg - a dish with soft cheese that looked like a fried. I dipped my spoon into all of the individual parts to test separately and realized that you really needed to scramble it all together to get the piece to taste delicious. 
*After Eight Timbal- my favorite of the desserts, as when you cracked the barrel of chocolate, a minty liquid flooded out and mixed with the bed of granola-ish stuff. Once it was all mixed together, I dug it. 
*Ferrero Rocher- a delicate little piece of chocolate with amazing presentation in a box. The chef said that it is one of the most difficult dishes to make of the night. 
*Burnt rum drink- it was awesome watching them still and set this drink aflame from the start of the night. Warm and served in a delightful little teacup!
*Yemita- cute little lemon drop
*More things- collection of little things with a small piece of chocolate, a wafer type thing. I was so full at this point that I just took little bites of these desserts. 

Overall, it was a brilliant dining experience. All of the staff were efficient and professional. Even if I did not particularly enjoy some of the dishes, I still loved watching them plate the dishes and talking to the chefs about the dishes. I was also pleased to discover some things that I want to get my hands on again such as more live seafood and more Wagyu beef!",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,11,7,5,Cw64T7P1DSnCkKZjedPblg

As others have stated, the food is indeed inspired, beautiful, and playful but it is really all about the entire experience that makes e so unforgettable!

Stephanie is fantastic, along with her crew and all the participating chefs.  It was one of the first times that I have dined somewhere so upscale, yet so unpretentious.  The ""bar"" setup allowed for great conversations between the 8 diners, really lending to the whole communal experience that Jose Andres enjoys.  

To sound simplistic, this was incredibly fun.  Yes it was expenisve and is exclusive, but once you are there it doesn't feel that way.  It is just so very enjoyable and relaxed and mindblowing all at the same time.

In short, it was well worth emailing at 3:01AM EST to assure a spot at this table.  I would (and will) do it again the next time in Vegas.",y9AnCv8mnbp4DOisBWuVeQ,1,2,5,M9AFXCiwqKLpv_Twoj1K4w
4339940,2015-11-06,2,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"e by Jose Andres is an absolute must if you are a foodie that wants to experience all that is Jose Andres in a setting that is intimate, yet non-stuffy. Tucked behind a secret curtain in the back of Jaleo, a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, is an intimate 8 seat only restaurant that will transport you to one of the most unbelievable culinary experiences you might ever have. 

It starts with the reservation. You don't call to make a reservation. In fact, they don't even have a phone. You have to email them, usually months in advance to secure  a spot in one of the 8 coveted seats. When you finally get a response, you pre reserve your seats, by filling out the reservation request, and prepaying with your credit card at the time of reservation. I don't think they actually charge the card, but the reservation policy is if you cancel within two weeks, there is a 50% charge, and no shows are billed at 100% so be sure you are aware of that. About a week before, you will receive your Golden Tickets, a la Willy Wonka style and you bring those as your admittance to the restaurant. I'm sure you don't really don't need to bring the tickets, but it's a fun touch and goes to show that they really don't take themselves too seriously.

When you arrive, you are seated in Jaleo, and the host comes over to give a quick explanation and to take drink orders. You may choose the wine pairing ($125) or choose from individual glasses of wine (about $25 each) for the dinner.

You are then escorted in and sit around the 8 person table. The venue is quite unique and sort of a speakeasy in the back of Jaleo, tucked behind a curtain. The venue has interesting items like an apothecary wall and items that were hand picked by Jose Andres. You then sit around the kidney shaped table to start your experience.

About 20 courses comprise the 3 hr evening and come in rapid succession. We started with a sangria cava that was an encapsulated ball that when placed in the mouth, exploded with flavor. Throughout the night, course after course was served , each on its own unique plate and masterfully prepared. The evening was as much a show as a meal. You got to ask questions, interact, and come away from the meal fully satisfied, wanting more more. The meal is pricey, about $500 for two, so not an everyday experience, but if you are looking for something unique, special, and out of the ordinary, keep this in mind.",OnINcVI4QaneN9XnMUuvsA,15,8,5,60VTNO9N7TVcV7nOeyCikw
4346867,2013-06-04,5,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"I'll start with a cliche...""words cannot describe how good this place was""....but I'll try anyway. 

You have to get a reservation ahead of time. e does not have a website--more like a landing page with an email address. We were fortunate enough to get the 5:30 time slot during the busy memorial day weekend. It made me nervous thinking that we would somehow miss the reservation--since there is a hefty cancellation fee--so make sure you can go!

We got our golden tickets in the mail--that made us feel very special. 

e is a private room in Jaleo--a Jose Andres restaurant in the Cosmopolitan. When you check in, they ask you to wait near the bar of Jaleo where you get an iPad menu to select cocktails. Then they direct you into the back room--which is big enough for an 8-person bar seating area. Everyone has an intimate view of the chefs assembling the dishes. 

Yes, it's expensive at $200 per person without drinks, gratuity included. But this shouldn't be compared to a regular dinner. It's a dinner and a show with exceptional service. There are two waiters for the 8 diners--that's impeccable service. Despite the price tag, it's not a snooty atmosphere by any means. The chefs talk about the dishes as the assemble them--and we asked lots of questions. It was so refreshing to be around fellow food nerds. 

Not to mention the food is phenomenal and utterly indescribable. This is what i would think of as advanced molecular gastronomy (although they don't really like that label). They play with your senses--and whatever your seeing in front of you doesn't taste like what you'd expect. Everything is inspired from Spanish cuisine. Every time I ate one of the 20+ courses, I said ""oh my god!"" My favorites were the courses that incorporated cheese--dessert was a bit of a let-down after all the wonderful courses before it. But still very good. You do get full towards the end, but you can take your time. 

Just prepared to be surprised. I highly recommend it --think of it as once-in-a-lifetime experience.",cMGqPwOONbJn3t8tcrPseQ,10,4,5,2-LT5MSavDA2GbFrqJXZPw

First challenge was finding the restaurant - it's located on the Level 3, Boulevard Tower (closer to the strip) and you check-in at the front of Jaleo by Jose Andres. To get to the room for é, you actually walk through Jaleo to a room in the back. However, before heading to the room, there's a special table area where all of the é guest gather, get drinks and chat while waiting for all guests to arrive. There were centerpieces on the table that ended up actually being edible and was the beginning of the é experience! Good thing I didn't play with the centerpiece....! The entire dining experience at é in the special room was great because we got to see everything made/constructed in front of us. We saw how they pressed cotton candy into dumpling shells, the detailed arrangement of each item, etc. The experience was great, the price was reasonable and there were some special items that I will always remember - like the ""raindrop"" sangria that was served on a plant leaf where you had to bring the leaf to your mouth as if you were in the wilderness drinking morning dew drops.

So, from my online research, I thought you had to make a reservation no earlier than midnight one month in advance, so a couple nights after I discovered this restaurant online, I set my alarm for 2AM CST (12 AM PST) to make a reservation by email, as they take emai reservations only...later found out they changed to three months in advance, so I pretty much could have called the night I discovered this gem. Oh well, it was worth it! I was giddy like a little kid when I got confirmation that I got the spot! ( to be fair, I am often giddy like a little kid over random things)

Ambience: It is in a secret room in the back of Jaleo, ummm that obviously makes it cool, no seriously, it was pretty much the coolest space/idea ever... Only 8 seats at a high top bar, with 2 seatings per night, which automatically gives it mega ambience points due to the underground exclusivity of it all... I felt very special to have gotten in, not to mention you get a golden ticket when you are ""awarded"" a seat at the ""show"" 

Food: There were 24, YES 24!! courses, and some were literally a bite or two, but oooooh ahhhh, it was excitement overload, as you get to watch the chefs create, plate, serve, explain every single intricate component and course, WOW, and it is very interactive, you can ask questions and meet the people you sit with since it is so intimate, the space you share with the other guests is more like eating at one big table with new friends...

Obviously too many courses to list, so here are some highlights:

Caramelized Pork Rinds: sweet, salty, porky! what a great idea :)

Nitro Almond Cup: liquid nitrogen is used to turn marcona almond puree into a little cup shape w/ almas ara caviar inside, so delicious as the ""frozen"" cups starts melting, and the richness of the marcona almonds (one of my favorite snacks on the planet!) melts, and you get the saltiness of the caviar, genius!

Turbot w/ Bone Marrow: Well the fish was great, but the standout was the little tubes of fried bone marrow topped w/ caviar. Oh my, this bone marrow melted in your mouth and was heavenly... I wanted more of them!

Wild Mushrooms In Papillote: you see a little pouch, and wonder, what ever is in this pouch, and then someone cuts the pouch, and this smell emerges, ohhhhh shiz it's morels!! YUM, earthy, creamy, morels, so tasty

Flan: orange flavored crushed ice sprinkled on the plate with a few mini baby flans, together, they created dreamsicle magic in my mouth and I liked it

Pan Con Chocolate: Who knew olive oil and chocolate would be so fab together, apparently Jose did, and of course there was a salty element to tie it all together, it was very unique and tasty

Arroz Con Leche: Heavenly rice pudding action in a caramelized cone thing, I know, my description doesn't do it justice, but hell, there were 24 courses! I can't remember all the details, but this was crazy good...

I didn't get the wine pairing, as it pretty much cost the same as the meal to do, OUCH, but I did try Estrella Damm Inedit for the first time, and it was super yummy and has become a regular purchase from my local Whole Foods, this beer was created by Ferran Adria to be paired with fine food... and that it does...

Still, I must be tainted from going to SAAM only a five weeks prior because I keep thinking it wasn't as good as it could have been. I honestly prefer SAAM. For the same price as é, you can get an even better tasting menu that lasts twice as long. 

While the goodies at the end were nice, I didn't get the beverage tasting list, which was disappointing as I really liked the muscat wine for some reason.",PWP2exy9dNqwnmEeKv5QtQ,1,0,4,xEKy0Awf2seS0cGJu-ZSDA

I was there with my fiancé and 6 others who I met drinking this dinner.

We didn't not do the paired menu which comes with different wines along with each dish. I'm not a wine person so I went with my good old cognac. It was an experience of a lifetime.

No, it does not lead you to the Wizard of Oz or to a Chocolate Factory, it gives you an opportunity to spend about 2 hours enjoying a chef tasting menu from Jose Andres and his peeps! One of a few secret society like tasting that you kind of have to dig a little deeper than an Open Table restaurant search.  Not very marketed or promoted but definitely a spot for foodies to enjoy.  

The reservation process was very easy, yet unconventional. These days, you Open Table, or call in the RSVP but here, you must email them details of your party and date. There are no phone numbers, just email correspondences. They have 2 seatings per night, 5.30/ 8.30, and only 9 spots. Yes, 9! It's a chef tasting so they like to make it intimated and small, which is definitely what you want.

We couldn't make the initial RSVP and they were happy to change it but since there is a pretty decent waiting list, unless there are replacement guest that can attend in place of you on their waiting list, you will be charged a cancellation fee if you do not provide notice within 14 days prior to your confirmed reservation.  

We arrived early around 5.15, per emailed instructions. There was no secret knock, no secret password, no secret handshake, no funny chicken dance we needed to do, we just checked in with the smiling hostess/ host at Jaleo and were seated at a holding table with the rest of the nights' guests.  After exchanging pleasantries and the usual introductions amongst everyone, the one of two hosts of the evening prepared us with drinks instructions and what to expect throughout the evening.  He briefed us on the wine/ cocktail pairing options and the al e carte drink menu available throughout dinner. Around 530, the host escorted us to the room in the corner of the restaurant, inconspicuous to everyone else, where all the magic happens.  

The décor was beautiful, you are surrounded by what seems like tea drawers. Red was the key color, slippers dawn the ladder leading to, perhaps the yellow brick road or the chocolate factory, but who knows, and who really cares, you're about to be fed!  Nine high top chairs around a bar like counter where Cody Jeffs and his 2 other sous chefs prepares 19 bomb-dot-com courses for you. A cast of Jose Andres' hands greets you with a lavender wet napkin to prepare you for dinner.  In the next two hours, you are transported to Spain.  After a brief introduction of all those involve, we start. With all 19 courses, Cody, prepares in front of you and narrates each dish. In order to get through all 19 dishes, they are amuse like portion, which is perfect to not overwhelm you.  Your respective pre ordered cocktail/ wine is served during dinner and you do is sit back relax and enjoy.  Any and all questions food related or person for the chefs are welcome, crude humor and banter is encouraged, especially when you've had a coupe of drinks, it's to be expected.  Just keep in mind, since there are only 9 stops, try not to be a douche.

The menu is not changed very frequently, although minor adjustments can be made. Despite the menu not being made public, they will cater to any and all reasonable dietary restrictions, just let them know. To enjoy the entire experience, I won't disclose the menu, you're just gonna have to go and check it out! Word to the wise: UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIES, JUST EAT EVERYTHING THEY PUT IN FRONT OF YOU!

From host, to the service staff to the chefs, the experience was perfect! The attention to detail, impeccable. The company was the best part. The food was.. let's just say if that is what they eat in Spain, I will be moving to Spain.  Sure, everyone's taste buds and preferences are subjective and you may not like foam on your plate, or like things that blow up in your mouth, or fancy cook yet runny egg yolks, or can pronounce 'kokotxas', or enjoy frozen foie gras, or even drinking truffle mist, you will have a wonderful experience. For those who are not 'sweets' people, I promise you will enjoy those 5 dessert courses.  There is nothing to complain about!

Definitely sign and comment on their guest book at the conclusion of dinner.  You will be part of more than 9,700 guest that have experienced this awesome food journey that started 3 years ago.  Who said there was no culture in Vegas, I just spent 2 hours in the middle of the Strip across the street from Paris, next to Bellagio, learning about Spain.  After a couple of drinks, I'm just glad they did the math for you at the end: $198pp, plus drinks, plus taxes, plus gratuity/ service charge.  And yes, if you live in the US, they will send you the Golden Ticket. For those who do not, you will be presented with you are the end of dinner along with menu, that everyone receives, of all that you had. 

Thank you Jose Andres, thank you to the serving staff, thank you to Cody Jeffs and his fellow sous chefs for an awesome Hump Day dinner, and an awesome experience!",dPMW-BVUPFT5r3MgDK3l2Q,9,7,5,t9caFIMacfFbCDSn_taG6A

I was lucky enough to get a last minute reservation in this restaurant for eight people. Last night I emailed the restaurant with the hope of a last minute cancellation.  I received my email this afternoon and I scored the ""golden ticket.""

The evening was a 24-course meal from ""snacks"" to the more heartier dishes to ""cheese"" to ""dessert.""

The process is you go to their website and send a request in for a reservation. They they email if you're in or not for dinner the evening of your request.

I checked in with the Jaleo host who remembered me calling in just yesterday to find out if there was availability at e.  I was then told to sit at the table as the server asked if I wanted any beverages during the meal.  I went with a bottled flat water for the evening instead of going with the beverage pairing knowing my meal would cost so much.

We sat for a few moments then asked to enter a small corner private room in the back of the restaurant. You walk in and there is a u-shaped bar with the centerpiece being the food preparation area or the ""stage"" of our show.

We were all brought a cocktail to start our meal. They the show began for a little more than two hours. There seated with me were three couples who were as passionate about food as I am.

Not only was each dish interesting in texture and flavor, the restaurant felt relaxed and special.  Our group of seven, were seated a bar facing an area where the chef prepared each of our courses.  There was one surprised after the other with each dish we received.

Service was very attentive and friendly. The chef was very patient to answer all of our questions that evening.

I highly recommend this special experience to anyone who loves food and is looking for something unique and different.

We loved the social touch in dining with 6 strangers in a private environment. The chefs plate every dish in front of your group so it has some kind of Japanese prep. touch. Loved it!

4482229,2011-08-12,1,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"This was truly a show and dinner in one, all the plating for the 22 courses are done right in front of you by the 2 or 3 main chefs, quite an experience!  Our hostess Stephani was great and seated us in Jaleo and gave us the lowdown and let us know about the drink parings, non-alcholic (~$55 -5 drinks), alcoholic (~$110-9 drinks), and there is a complete wine list you can choose from before dining.  Or you can opt for just water.

I got the non-alcholic pairings, some were kind of unique, but it was a letdown after I saw all the cool drinks the alcoholic pairing people were getting.  Get the alky pairings if possible!  There was this cool drink that you drink from a spanish Porron (some special bottle) looked really cool.

Anyways onto the food & show.  We were seated at 8 person, I came with 4 of my friends, booked 2 months in advance.  You get golden tickets maybe 1.5 weeks before your reservation date, they are nice and shiny!

Started off with a special chilled/slushy gin and tonic, made with some liquid nitrogen type techniques.   It tasted pretty good, got some alky although I didn't get the alchoholic parings, nice I like it already!

I could go through all the dishes, but I posted pictures of all of them.  I'll go over my favorites:

Beet Jewelry-  Beautiful presentation and it tasted delicious, they sprinkle some gold dust on top or something.
http://s3yelp3-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/ODHNmKhaeo5IwGFHFaGH1g/l.jpg 

Jose Taco- Basically a slide of Jamon de iberico de bellota (high end sliced ham from Spain) served wtih caviar on top

Rosemary Wild Mushroom in papilllote- delish mushrooms in a creamy sauce

Secreto of  Iberico Pork- more of this imported pork from spain, not sure what part of the pig it is, but its you get nice juicy thick chunks of it, kind of like a steak.
http://s3yelp3-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/2zKCVPru5p_1-VFarc0mWw/l.jpg

There were so many other delicious dishes, they used the spherication technique liberally, a few dishes used it, giving you the explosion of liquid in your mouth.

The desserts very unique and innovative, saffron chocolate, some sponge looking one with gold dust, chocolate they put in some liquid nitrogen or something to get very unique texture to it.  So much to say but I suggest you go and try it yourself.

Seeing all the meticulous work required in plating and presentation was quite a show and I ate it up!  I think lots of the food you can also get at The Bazaar in LA, for you so-cal folks.  Special thanks to Mia, one of the chefs, she was great and had a smile the whole time.  

Thanks again to the e staff for the great experience!",wucy6stQAKlzKR5hKKDLig,4,3,5,TQFHeL8FyYhensUl_zFhNQ

Getting a reservation can take up to three months-- or so they say. :P They do have cancelations all the time, but be prepared to change your flight (like we had to) to get there for the 5:30 pm slot, which is the unpopular slot for obvious reasons. You have to email/fax them a credit card authorization form the night before by 6pm!

The manager and servers were kind, gracious and super organized. They allowed us to keep our baggage in the wine room because we had to rush from our delayed flight straight over the restaurant.

I understand that each menu is different so no point in going through what was good and what wasn't.

I have to point out the beautiful artistry involved in their presentation of the food. From the handmade plates (some were from Crate&Barrel--no shame in being honest) to desserts served in jewelry boxes, each course was a delightful surprise to both sight and taste.

Our chef was very nice. The whole atmosphere was very casual. We chatted about everything from the dishes, culinary secrets, to how ""Dexter"" and ""Breaking Bad"" ended. The intimate setting allows for the guests to interact as well.

Let's talk about price.

It's just under $600 for 2 people, including tip and tax. We opted against the wine pairing $130/person and I'm glad I did. 

So, why the 4 stars?

Maybe I'm being lame (or harsh) but I honestly thought I would see the chef prepare the food but that really wasn't the case. You watch the food being put on the plate. That's it. My hubby and I love to eat at bar counters where we can watch the chefs prepare the food. We like to see dishes that we didn't order and observe how dishes are made. We're also both interested in processes (of businesses) and like watching the product be made. That was not the case here so I was slightly disappointed.

4567905,2014-12-01,2,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"So here's my deal with this place. The service was shit on Thanksgiving. There weren't that many people, but plenty of workers and servers. I don't understand why it takes over 15 minutes to place an order. I don't understand why it takes 40 minutes to get the food out. No one poured us water until we're about to leave. Getting the check took over 10 minutes, and getting the card back was another 15min. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!

The food was not mind blowing, and the paella had an odd bitter stinky taste for the chicken and rabbit, but it was still good. The veggie paella I can do without and I wanted to cancel that order because it took 35 minutes to come out. I literally spent hours at this place waiting for crap to come out.

The fennel salad, don't bother, the apples were too sour, it doesn't compliment the overly dressed fennel. 

The scallops were not bad, but damn were they small and expensive, only comes in a pair!

The mini sliders were not sliders, they were button size, super tiny for $8 each.

The roasted cauliflower was good, though throwing some mushrooms would have been nice.

I was disappointed with the service, and the food does not compensate it either.
I thought about 2 stars, even wrote them a note about 2 stars, but now I'm thinking about the way they treated us, and how rude and unfriendly they were, 1 star. You guys really did not deserve a tip at all.

To me, this is more about the whole experience than it is about the food (I don't want to be negative, but don't go for the food.. go for the service, the experience, and the interaction with the chefs).

4593216,2015-11-02,1,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"Ever since that memorable dinner at é by José Andrés a few years back, I've been itching to return to the Cosmo's finest Spanish dining destination -- Jaleo, located in the Cosmo dining district on the 3rd level.  I recently joined a friend for dinner at Jaleo, and it was a fabulous experience from start to finish.

We arrived a little early for our 8pm reservation, so the hostess let us wait at the bar, where we each tried one of the bartender's recommendations (Berroja white for me, and a gin and tonic for my guest).  It was a perfect place to soak in the vibrant, upbeat, bright interior.  It's a nice change of pace from the darker and more overtly sexified dining destinations elsewhere in the Cosmo dining district (STK and Scarpetta come to mind).  

After we were seated at a prime two-top near the front of the restaurant, I decided I wanted to have a dinner experience different from the ultramodern, molecular gastronomy-heavy experience at é.  Our server recommended the ""Jaleo Experience"" -- a traditional tapas-style prix fixe feast for 2 for $55.  I was sold right away.  It's a mountain of amazing food at a reasonable price.  Here's the rundown of the dishes, all of which were perfect for sampling and sharing:

1) Pan de cristal con tomate fresco -- classic-style fresh tomato on bread.
2) Jamón ibérico de bellota Fermín -- ham from Iberico pigs with crunchy crackers.
3) Manchego flor de esqueva -- tasty sheep (Manchego) cheese.
4) Tichi's gazpacho -- cold gazpacho soup with tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers.
5) Cono de atun -- cone of tuna tartare with piqullo and sesame seeds.
6) Pimientos del piquillo rellenos de queso Caña de Cabra -- piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese.
7) Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo'  -- bacon-wrapped dates with apple/mustard sauce.
8) Paella de pollo -- classic-style paella with chicken.
9) Escalivada catalana -- fire-roasted red peppers, eggplant, and sweet onions.
10) Chorizo casero con puré de patatas al aceite de oliva -- crispy chorizo with potato purée and cider sauce.
11) Pan con chocolate -- chocolate custard with caramelized bread, olive oil, and brioche ice cream.

There were so many highlights to this meal that I don't even know where to begin. The pan con tomate was so fresh and vibrant.  The jamón ibérico was rich and decadent.  The gazpacho was tangy and creamy.  The paella was a wonderful mix of flavors and textures, from the perfectly cooked chicken to the crunchy rice.  The chorizo was fatty perfection, on top of some of the silkiest mashed potatoes I've ever had.  The dessert was sweet but complex.

The recurring theme was olive oil.  There was olive oil in virtually every dish, which tied the courses together in a beautiful way.  Olive oil even featured prominently in the pan con chocolate dessert -- and let me say that olive oil + chocolate is a fabulous combination that I'm eager to try again ASAP.

Service was fantastic too.  In addition to our main server, there was a veritable small army of people bringing plates in and out, and refilling our water at a moment's notice.  Not too shabby since the two of us were a pair of low-rollers sharing a single and inexpensive tasting menu.  

The verdict: Jaleo lives up to the stratospherically high standard set by é.  For a traditional Spanish meal, you just can't do better -- whether you're in the Cosmo or elsewhere.  Nicely done, Chef Andrés!  You made me swoon big-time!",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,3,6,5,L8xwRjHKa5ftp04BriINhw

I enjoyed every single dish except the fish jowls, which was a little much for me.  We did do the black truffle add-on which made each dish that much better.

Despite my skepticism that it would be much beyond a standard tapas menu with perhaps a few special dishes, I ended up wowed. It was a fantastic meal - we ordered a couple of the chef's specials and were not disappointed. Not everything we had was a ""wow"", but enough stood out that it was memorable.

I think part of the experience also depends on the other diners. The chef was very focused and the other diners were friendly but not too chatty, so it was a quiet meal. It would be nice to come with a group of friends so you can enjoy the experience.

I think what makes this a different type of meal than your average expensive restaurant is that it is actually an experience that requires some participation.  

The seating is small (max of 8 people, my dinner had 6 total) and intimate.  Including myself and my SO, there were 2 other couples, and none of the pairings knew the other.  Our chef (Cody) started pretty even-keeled, and we didn't engage right off the bat.  So if you are quiet and don't feel like engaging, your shyness will reverberate through the room.

I think the type of person who would enjoy this experience the most, or the proper way to enjoy it, is for someone to spark up conversation with your neighbors, the chefs, and the servers.  That energy will carry through the room, get everyone going, and make the night a very different experience than you would get at say Robuchon or Guy Savoy.

So if you don't really like talking to strangers (and can be honest with yourself about it), maybe you're better off spending your money at some of the other blowout restaurants in Vegas.",c_HdvOYbDHfcd5KtM6wY4w,13,4,5,HjWHq1rieGyCQcMOVV6t7w

We didn't do a wine pairing. The food was phenomenal and the presentation was pretty epic. I am not going to go through all 19 courses as I don't see the point as the menu changes. You leave this place not feeling over full (like you can with French Laundry), but content. The evening consists of a head chef and some helpers. The chef explains what they are serving and the others help them prepare it. Then, they present the food to you all at the same time (note: they don't actually cook any food in front of you, it gets cooked in their main kitchen, they just put it all together). You're free to ask questions as they prepare the food and make comments. This is definitely an ""intimate"" dining experience which would be wonderful to do with a group of close friends.

OK, I guess things equal out in the end.

Yeah, this isn't an everyday kind of meal place. It's a special occasion, once-in-blue-moon-and-if-that-moon-were-rich-and-crapped-gold-in-your-lap kind of place. We didn't care though. It was my birthday and my wife wanted to see me happy. She sure enough saw me grin through the foodiest douchebaggiest experience of both of our lives and my wife rules.

I won't go into too many details since most Yelpers have repeated them ad nauseum. My dishes were pretty similar to most others with the exception of the ever-changing ""Catch of the Day."" (Ours was turbot for the record.)

The chicken skin was memorable. The secreto of iberico ham rave-worthy. But it was the ""chickpea"" stew that made me actually swear a series of expletives into my bowl. I believe I was quoting the celebrated poet Lord Byron when I muttered into my bowl, ""You've got to be fucking kidding me"" and ""I'd eat this shit off of Bin Laden's bloated, decaying corpse.""

There are only eight seats, sidled up to a high-top bar. I think that a diner's experience would depend heavily on their surrounding companions. Fortunately, after a few courses (and some flowing wine), we all warmed up to one another. Jose Andres is famous for encouraging diners to play with their food and play we did. Observations were made and notes were shared. ""What did you think of this?"" and ""Could you taste the jasmine in the foam? So did I!"" 

One of us had the vegetarian option and she described in detail her obviously different experience. My glutarded wife requested the gluten-free option and she did the same for the others. I and one other had sprung for the full alcohol pairing, but after the ninth pairing, what seemed to us a cogent and eloquent discourse in which we deconstructed every layer, aroma, and lovingly created component for our dining companions was most likely, when I think back on it, a couple of guys who sounded like the Hulk and Cookie Monster trying to read a restaurant review out of Parade magazine. None of us cared though because we had a ball. Yes, your individual experiences may vary, so I hope for your sake, you get a fun group.

The service was professional and precise. The staff introduced each meal and fielded questions. They were upfront when needed, stayed in the background when not.

A few final notes: 1) You get to take home a menu, which answers the question, ""How do all these Yelpers remember what they ate to put in their reviews?"" 2) You also get to keep your golden ticket. We actually never received ours in the mail, but they made sure we walked away with a couple. 3) the coffee is not part of the meal. You'll be charged for it. Nothing in Vegas is free, yo. Stupid coffee. 4) If you're on an iPhone, good luck checking in. Or doing anything on that phone for that matter. This restaurant exists in an AT&T blackhole. If you're meeting friends afterwards, make sure your plans are well-defined beforehand. 5) We never got to sign the guest book. In fact, this last note is my only gripe in an otherwise perfect night. Guestbook, man, guestbook! How can I prove I was there?! I mean, other than the pictures. And receipt. Oh and the menus and golden ticket.

Obviously I wasn't expecting anything e-like, for an order of magnitude cheaper, but I was expecting it to be pretty tasty, which it was. I'm also rating it based on getting there for happy hour - I'd go with 4 1/2 stars if I could, but I was solidly pleased with the meal, so 4 seems low. But definitely without the happy hour prices, I'd have been a lot less pleased. Happy hour right now is until 7, and only at the bar, so not very useful for bigger groups, but excellent for a group of 2. Amusingly, I kind of feel like sitting at the bar likely gave us *better* service, since you have a bartender keeping a constant eye out for your satisfaction, plus the bartender is the most likely to be knowledgeable about the drink list. The service was solid. 

For food, we shared: 

* Their take on patatas bravas, $6 for happy hour. Solid, though my favorite tapas place back home still does them better, I think. The sauce was excellent; the potatos were decent, but I like them a little crispier. Good price though, and decent portion for tapas.

* Their take on calamari, $6 for happy hour. Also a good portion, not over-fried, and I could tell the calamari was quite fresh, but it was a little salty, and the sauce was a bit bland. Happily, we had leftover patatas bravas sauce, so I used that instead. 

* An amazingly delicious flatbread (on the menu as ""coca con escalivada""), for, yes, $6 for happy hour. The bread had the perfect consistency, and topped with a super flavorful tapanade and that same delicious light crema type cheese that was used in a few of my favorite bites in e - just without the caviar and stuff ;). I'm thinking about popping back in again today for another one of these. 

* One item not from the happy menu, because their happy hour menu is sadly fairly small - I was going to try the paella, but when we were there, the paella choices were vegetarian (boring!) or rabbit and chicken (sounded exciting, until I learned that rabbit in paella is mostly bones, which no thanks), so instead, I decided to try something unique, their ""paella"" of toasted noodles with seafood fritters (rossejat). It was actually surprisingly substantial for $20, and delicious, though I felt for the price, there should have been a few more of the seafood fritters than we got. Still recommended, though, if you want something a bit more unique. 

* Two glasses of two different bartender-recommended vermouths, $6 each - I was a *huge* fan of the ""priorat natur blanco"", and, again, will likely be back for today's happy hour before we leave tomorrow. Also a $4 glass of authentic dry apple cider - a bit too dry on its own, but went great with the food. 

So, I'd give it maybe 3 1/2 stars for the menu with everything at full price, but 4 1/2 during happy hour. But happy hour is totally long enough that's not too much of a caveat. ;)

Edit: I totally did go back the following day. Got another flatbread, which was just as delicious, also tried the ""jaleo bramble"", which was omg fantastic (if you like rosemary). Also tried one of the ""cones"", the tuna, which... was cool, I guess, but 5$ and super tiny. You'd need to eat about 25 of them to be full, so not as recommended. Kinda tasty, just, tiny.",7PHHxsjyk7I7oM6ENxwZZQ,3,1,5,3vSnCph6ylKZpP2IQrfsxQ

Luckily, we were able to get the Holiday version of their menu, as their theme revolved around truffles that came in via Italy just less than 48 hours via Air Force One (just a slight exaggeration there).  But it was pretty damn fresh according to our sous chef.

It was 19 courses of what was easily the best fine dining experience I've had in my entire life.  Hell, by the 6th or 7th course, I was already sold.  

Of the 19 courses, I'd say that my favorite was definitely their ""salad"" course which consisted of black truffle dressing over foie gras powder.  Personally I'm not a fan of greens, but that was easily the best salad I've ever had.  And what stood out the most was that this was an modified course.  There was supposed to be peanut butter here as well, but due to my peanut allergy they were able to make modifications to any courses that had peanuts or nuts with no questions.  Simply wonderful.

I want to try and make an effort to get to Minibar and Jose's other establishments  when I have the time and money.  But for now, I'm definitely pleased.",bdZLmvZg7ibzD0YbLfru6A,3,2,5,n3EB6KSPt0rkRPJyJQxszw

4960761,2011-09-23,1,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"Let me start out by saying that I'm not a huge fan of Jose Andres' restaurants in general, but this is the best of the 3 i've tried (Jaleo & Bazaar being the other 2 of his restaurants I've tried).  The experience is very unique.  They send you golden tickets in the mail, which you present for entry in front of Jaleo.  They escort you to the private room of Jaleo, where it's ""bar style"" seating.  There are only 2 seatings per night, with 8 people per seating.  The decorations in the room are supposed to represent Jose Andres' mind and each dish is inspired by something from his past/memory but with a twist to it. Cool concept. (For example, Jose Andres used to eat calamari sandwiches w/ his family at the beach when he was young, so he used that idea as a course, but thought it would taste good with uni (aka sea urchin), so the course was a sea urchin sandwich instead).  Of course the waitresses explain this narration to you...I didn't make it up.. 

What's interesting about this tasting menu compared to other restaurants is that they mix in ""alcoholic drinks"" as a course...and there are quite a few of these alcoholic courses.  The first course is ""gin & tonic.""  Let me tell you, for a light weight, this thing is STRONG...and made me buzzed on my empty stomach (haha).  22 courses total, all presented very intricately.  My favorites that stood out were: crispy chicken skin in escabeche, apple brazo de gitano (this meringue cylinder filled with light cheese-melts in your mouth), and a white ""soup."" called Ajo Blanco.

Each course looks very beautiful, but not every course tastes as amazing as it looks.  For example, the desserts at the end were only ok.  Some were better than others (best was apples & red wine), but the finale was disappointing.  The finale featured this sponge (not much flavor), fizzy paper (light, crunchy w/ citrus flavor), and chocolate air.  I did NOT like the chocolate air at all.  It was light in weight, but when you bite into it,  it's dense. The flavor isn't that good; it reminds me of stale chocolate.  Not a fan...took a bite..did not finish it.  My friend seemed to like it though, and ate it for me.  

As for alcoholic pairing, I didn't do it, but I saw others do it.  It's A LOT of alcohol.  You definitely need a high tolerance to consider adding it (or maybe share one pairing between 2 people).  The non-alcoholic pairing is not worth it.  The drinks didn't pair that well with the food and some of the drinks weren't that good (they looked pretty, but not that tasty).  For example, they had this watermelon spice drink...I don't know about you, but i like refreshing drinks..this one tasted funky and left a spice kick in my mouth...no bueno.  

Overall, great dining experience.  It's like watching a show when they prepare your food.  The total experience lasts about 3 hours.  If you have a low tolerance like me, you might even leave buzzed (one of the desserts has rum in it & is STRONG).  Definitely fun & unique, but in terms of food quality overall, it's just good, not amazing.",53EWBX2QGISTDZJ1NZfyrA,3,3,4,L3z3qXSAL6rwzPCFeTLHwQ

The creativity and execution of each of the dishes was perfect, and I really enjoyed myself watching the chefs prepare each of the plates and make the dishes come to life. 

There were many favorites that night. I enjoyed the foie gras chocolate tart, the squid with rosemary foam, the edible sangria, the scallop with black truffle cream and black truffle shavings, the cotton candy with foie gras filling, the wagyu beef, etc. In fact every dish deserves 5 star on its own.

I was particularly impressed by the potato sheet that was served as a side along with the black truffle gnocchi along with the beef. I thought it was a sugar glaze initially, but was completely mind blown to learn that it was made with potato.

4994916,2012-05-24,4,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"On making reservations:
It can be ambiguous and quite a challenge. It took 2 trips to Vegas for the stars to finally align for me to finally be able to get in. They have 2 seating a night and they seat about 10 people inside a separate room in Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan. You must email them exactly one month in advance at midnight Vegas time, which means if you are traveling from the east coast set up an email rule to send your email at 3:01AM. Also have several dates and times that you are available to increase your chances of getting in.

On the dining experience:
I dined here on a Sunday evening after a monster weekend in Vegas. This is definitely a social experience with the other diners sitting around the bar style seating. I felt just as comfortable dining here solo as I would with a date. About half the group were actually solo diners. Our group was young, funny, and very social. Don't feel pressured to do the wine pairing, although I heard it was excellent only 2 or 3 of the diners in our group did it. Plus we were greeted with a glass of champagne when we sat regardless of whether you ordered the wine pairing and one of the dishes was, as I would describe it, a large sangria caviar. So there is enough alcohol served if you wanted to drink light.

On the show:
The show here is the two chefs in action. Most of the dishes have been prepared somewhat in advance, but they are assembled and discussed right in front of your eyes. Some of the dishes came off like alchemy. Feel free to ask any questions you want, they are happy to discuss the dishes in detail. The 2 chefs/wizards said it takes 36 man hours to prepare for each service.

Normally I would go into detail about each dish but there were just too many and you don't have a choice in what you eat. You just get to try everything. The dishes ranged from good to amazing. I've been to a handful of places that I would say had better food, but the presentation and creativity at work here is unmatched. On my visit it cost $199 + tax, I was told there was no tipping even after insisting. If you are interested or curious about molecular gastronomy then it is worth the visit. If like me the high price is tough to swallow, do what I did, look at it as a great Vegas show instead of a dinner you won't regret it.

A lot of time and energy had obviously gone into the preparation of the dishes and the quality of the ingredients were of a high standard, but the overall flavours and palatability were lacking throughout the meal. For example, foie gras baked in salt sounds like a great idea, but when it is served concerningly rare and without an adequate sauce to foil the richness of foie, it falls flat. On the other hand, I cannot fault the abilities, service standards and personable approach of the chefs, the sommellier and waitress. I suspect the exclusivity of this location as a result of the limited capacity coupled with the neverending supply of new customers based on the Las Vegas location will keep seats filled, but I suspect few, and most certainly, I, will not be returning to e.

In fact, the planning for our trip was largely built around dining here.  We had made reservations almost three months in advance for the 5:30 seating on Wednesday.  é only offers two seatings (5:30 and 8:30) per night (Tues-Sun) limited to eight people per seating.  It was a fixed, 20-course menu with optional drink pairings.  Yes, it was uber-pricey.  We had the drink pairings, which made it even pricier.  Fortunately, I was able to cash use all of my Identity points (the Cosmopolitan's players reward program) to offset some of our meal's cost, which made it considerably less expensive, but still far from cheap.   Upon checking in at the hostess stand at Jaleo, we were taken to table in Jaleo's bar to wait for the entire party for the 5:30 seating to arrive.  Once everyone was there and 5:30 rolled around, we were taken through a door into é's small, somewhat unconventional, dining room where the diners sat at the counter like at you would at a small diner or coffee shop except the chefs behind the counter were more akin to artisans crafting works of art.

We appreciate fine dining, modernist cuisine, and in full disclosure, we were very familiar with José Andrés and the cuisine served at é having eaten at his original minibar, a similar concept restaurant in DC.  é, in my mind, was a far superior experience compared to minibar.

Arrived promptly at 5:15 and was escorted to a communal table where a waiter will take your drink orders.  We had planned to bring our own wine but the shipment didn't make it in time from napa so we opted to try their sangria.

Located within Jose Andres' Jaleo, the counter seating was probably the only minor annoying thing about the night.  The chef expedites right in front of you and you're served as a group.

That Catalan is the source of excellent food, refined here, but still deeply satisfying in that provincial kind of way.  That whimsy also makes for a fun experience.

Enjoy the whimsical surroundings (Jaleo houses the legendary E, it's decor is an extension of that dining space, a foray into the mind of the chef).  Be prepared to sample molecular dishes alongside the traditional.  Most importantly, share some food, spill some wine on your face from the porron and have a great time.

Tip:  Order in flights (keep a menu).  Dishes are tapa style.  Ask your server the number of pieces on each dish.  All can be adjusted for the number in your party.

Tip:  Keep to Spanish dishes.  Steaks, lamb, pork can be had at Bazaar Meats, pure molecular gastronomy for E.  Save room for a paella.

To start, nice selection of cured meats (opt for the  chef's selection for the best variety).  Nice selection of cheeses however having the cheese as part of another dish is the way to go.  The Cabra goat cheese in endive with pine nuts and Clementine oranges is incredibly creamy and refreshing with a great acidic touch.

Don Bocarte Anchovies are excellent.  Canning Spain's great seafood is what Don Bocarte is about.  The whole fillets have great texture and salinity and oddly brightened by the olive oil.  Trust me, this isn't the stuff you spoon out of a can in college desperation days.

Gambas al ajillo (shrimp cooked in a garlic tomato broth).  The shrimp, plump and juicy.  Its sweetness accentuated by the acidic tomato sauce.  Garlic adds a creamy richness and gentle earthiness.  The crusty bread that accompanies it is the perfect way to sop up the goodness.

Grilled octopus is stunning.  Thick leg, tender with perfectly blistered and blackened skin adding a pronounced but pleasing bitterness.  Zesty olive oil mixed with a sweet onion puree adds sweetness.  Good as any.

Paella is the specialty and a must.  Cooked over a wood burning fire that imparts a gentle smoky bitterness.  The chicken and mushroom is excellent.  Tender, free ranged, thighs and an assortment of wild mushrooms amidst a rich mixture of moist, well flavored rice.  A streak of roasted garlic, lemon and olive oil supercharged aioli adds the richness and acidic peppery zing that has you yearning for more.  If you're lucky, and it's being made, ribs of the black footed Iberico pig or chicken and rabbit with tender green beans is a must order.

Service is very friendly and efficient.

Excellent wine list focusing on Spain.  Good by the glass selection.  Solid sherry selection and flights.

I compared the food to my prior night dinner at Joel Robuchen I have to say food wise JB was the stabs out but the experience at e is still not to be undermined.",TkToy_vQXQmseminhFS8tw,0,0,4,dN4S2VMJk8VRoSpZTSUefA

I'm Customer #3339! Yes, each guest that dines at this restaurant gets their own number.  Makes you feel kinda special I guess.

We got lucky with getting reservations here exactly a month in advance so it must've been meant to be :-)  Each seating only seats 8 guests; 2 seatings a night. 

I've been to Alinea in Chicago few years ago so I knew what to expect.  I think I may have actually enjoyed e by Jose Andres a slight more maybe because it was more interactive and intimate experience because you sit in a curved table watching the chefs semi-prepare your meals. 

The amount of prep work the chefs had to do to orchestrate the 20+ courses was quite remarkable.  The details and intricacy of each dish was impressive. (astericks tagged next to dishes I really enjoyed)

        1. Rebujito - alcoholic drink they stirred up and topped with foam reminded me of this drink I had at the Lobby Lounge at the Modern (formerly called Edition) hotel in Hawaii. 

        2. Spanish ""Clavel"" - beautifully shaped into a flower and served in the palm of Jose Andre's hand. Tasted like candy
        3. Beet Jewelry - they said to eat it off your pinky finger like a ring. Dusted with gold. Tasted like beet chips with a savory sweet taste. *
        4. Caramelized Pork Rinds - ehhh wasn't too into this

        5. Apple ""Brazo de Gitano"" - light airy texture and sweet. we were confused why it seemed like it was starting out with ""dessert"" like courses.

       6. Nitro Almond Cup - wow, this was genius. It looked like half an egg shell with caviar and cream in it. The chef said to eat it quick because it will melt so I put the whole thing in my mouth. Quite a surprise. **

       7. Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - not a chicken skin fan but this was quite delicious. tender chicken on crispy skin topped with foam.

       8.  Jose Taco - caviar wrapped in proscuitto - nothing special, it was as you could imagine.

       9. Olivia Sferica Ferran Adria - olive juice in a bubble so it pops in your mouth and tastes like an olive. they process to make this sounded quite intricate. 

      10.  Bocata de Calamares - similar to the sandwich but of course with a twist. It had a huge piece of sweet uni from Santa Barbara. **

      11. Cava Sangria - a SHOT of alcohol in the same bubble like thing as the olive.  whew, woke me up!

      12. Artichoke ""puree"" with Vanilla - it looked like sato imo (small japanese mountain potatoes) but it was little artichokes. never had anything like that. It was in a nice dark sauce with lemon foam dressed on the side.  

      13.  Lobster with citrus and jasmine foam - MY FAVORITE! I love lobster and jasmine so pairing the two was heaven. The dish was beautifully plated with citrus segments.**
 
     14.   Chickpea stew with Iberico Ham - this was a pretty dish you just wanted to just stare at and not eat. This was a favorite amongst the entire table. It was like a delicate cream stew with garbanzo dumpling like things. 

      15. Turbot with bone marrow - the moist white fish had a crispy skin and was complimented well with grounded coffee grinds on the side. The chef was raving about the bone marrow filled pockets but it was nothing special for me.

      16. Rosemary wild mushrooms in Papillote - wrapped in a cellophane bag, this was like a mushroom soup with scents of rosemary, then topped with foam again.  One of the guest had a substitute of veal cheeks since he doesn't like mushrooms so we were all quite envious of that dish.

       17.  Secreto of Iberico pork with squid - loved the pork and sauce. This dish once again topped with some green vegetable foam. *

      Still not over yet....can't forget about the desserts!!!

     18.  Orange Pith Puree La Serena - spooned goat cheese plated with sauces and thin piece of bread.

      19. Flan - beautifully plated with four small pieces of flan and flowers and mint with shaved ice in the middle drizzled with caramel. I enjoyed watching them making this one.*

     20. Pan Con Chocolate - was the least attractive dish but what a treat, my favorite dessert course. top looked like it was sprinkled with dirt but it was chocolate cake that melts in your mouth. Layers underneath had crunch which gave it texture to the creaminess of the dessert.**

     21. ""Arroz Con Leche"" - arroz con leche in a cone made with melted sugar, kicks of citrus.*

     22. 25 second Bizcocho - they said it took only 25 seconds to make this cake like volcano in the microwave. similar to a chiffon cake, very light. Dusted with gold.
    23. Fizzy paper - crispy paper like candy but wakes you up with the strong citrus flavors.
    24. ""Air"" Chocolate - just like the name, airy chocolate, one that was bitter dark and the other yogurt flavored.

Yes we felt like we ate enough food that could last a week in our tummies but the memories would last for a long time.",XLmCXdAuKhm105fOIc71hw,18,6,5,EVx4P9Fd7F4DYB7smAQeMA

The small room seats about 10 and is an inside look into the mind that is Jose Andres. The service was fantastic, and they were great at answering all the questions. Specialty cocktail list was ok, but the wine pairing was showcased. They start you off with a nice amuse bouche, a small sphere that pops in your mouth (little bit of alcohol). They did fail to mention that...

The food though was really solid all the way thru the maze of courses. Some of the misses thou in my opinion were the rock cheese concoction, as well as the sangria sorbet. There were however a lot of dishes that i still think about - iberico with espuma of tomato, the 'toast' with persimmon jam, the crab, and the cotton candy was really cool and delicious. 

Overall what a unique dining experience with some excellent bites. You might not leave super full but I was very happy with the total amount and the quality and variety. I would like to return in the future.

5252891,2016-03-03,55,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"I have no idea where to start with this review. I don't know if I went to dinner, a magic show, a Luminati meeting or was drugged and shoved into a room with 8 other people eating quarter sized pizzas and miniature furniture pillows. 

One thing I do know is I was sitting at a bar like structure for 2 hours and only had 2 cocktails. WTF? I had to have been drugged!! 

This is one of those once in a lifetime meals that will make you wonder what the fuck just happened. I really didn't know what to expect when we arrived. We checked in at his Jaleo restaurant where we were shuttled to a table to wait with 8 other anxious diners/showgoers. The staff were on it making sure we had cocktails (could have been drugged at this point) and within a short 10 to 15 minutes we were led to the secret room. 

My Mom taught me back in the day not to trust situations like this, but my girl felt good about it so I was all in!! The room was just big enough to fit 8-10 diners, couple chefs and a couple wait staff. Really cool decor from a corset lamp to a wall of drawers that had a hidden door to the kitchen. 

As we all sat down, I tried to figure out which diner was weakest in case shit went bad and we had to sacrifice one of us. I had a couple in mind so I was feeling a little better. The chefs entered like gladiators entering a ring for battle. Let's get ready to rumble!!

Round one of this 20 round battle started out with a bang! A cocktail! Now this is my kind of dinner.  A frozen Sangria that was like dipping dots for booze goers like me. As I was eating my sangria my mind went to that happy place, no longer thinking about sacrificing the lady from DC. 

As the rounds rolled on my senses really started to get twisted. Flavors, colors, smells, ingredients and textures were all getting turned upside down. I no longer could guess flavors from the look, smell and color of the dish. 

By far my favorite round was the spanish pizza! The bite size pizza packed more punch and flavor than the best 18"" pizza you could get in Phoenix (Yeah Phoenix has the best pizza in the country) 

This is just a part of my food trip I was on: 
Potato Glass with truffle puree 
Skate with truffle air (I don't even know what that means!)
Flan
Raspberry Rosewater sorbet on goat cheese with a mint branch meringue (Can't make that shit up)
Australian Wagyu Ribeye with flourless gnocchi
Beet Tartar (Loved it, duh)
Spanish Tuna Belly (Like a party in your pants)
and another 12 or so other courses!!!

After the 2 hours and 20 courses came to an end I fully appreciated what an amazing trip my 5 senses went thru. Jose Andres and his amazing staff of chefs really have something special going on in that little room in the back of Jaleo! I still don't know how they got my boxers off without me knowing!! JK, that happened at the Chinese restaurant behind the Orleans, my Mom was right about not trusting that situation!!",NWuFF7-HjYE9dvt_xGbEhw,49,39,5,vNH8dJlz0dP2VxLF0OrmLw

After 21 courses, I was equally enthralled and sated. The theatre aspect is spectacular but the food truly astounds as well. There are too many hi-lights for me to recant. (Look at the pictures) The only negative takeaway I can see is the pace is simply too fast. You barely have time to savor a plate before the next offering arrives. I would have liked more time to figure out exactly what, and how in the world that was that just blew my mind. 

Just get yourself a golden ticket and enjoy the show, and the food!  Simply and un-simply spectacular. Bravo Jose.",KgvrFBLnBZMkI_19khRkQA,0,0,5,CJ1vwRkH-jIJ-OVga6-EEQ

After the thinkfoodgroup stiffed me last minute on a minibar reservation I had every reason to boycott their restaurants for all time yet given the strong reviews of the restaurant-within-a-restaurant é by Jose Andres at Jaleo I simply could not resist the temptation...especially when I learned that Jose himself would be in town at Christmas when the restaurant was hosting a truffle-centric extended tasting for five days only.  Pricey to be sure, part due to the luxury ingredients and part due to the location and exclusivity, this was one of those reservations that required a signed contract and pre-payment and the sort that came with great anticipation...it even came with a golden ticket just to get you in the door...and it was worth it.

Without a doubt one of my five best meals in 2012 the eve of Christmas Eve bled into the early hours of the 24th as I sat with one other man from Arizona and a family of six from the Carolinas as Andres and his team sent out twenty three courses of elegant, fun, and mostly delicious cuisine ranging from a meringue of squash that disappeared like a magic trick in the mouth flooding the palate with the intense perfume of truffles to a thick slice buttery foie gras rendered refreshing though the use of citrus juxtaposing dark chocolate.

Presented by a kitchen of four acting as both chefs and servers while the maître d made his way around the room pouring exotic wines (a $200+ pairing) for my dining partners and unlimited bottled water (a mere $8) for myself service throughout the experience was truly exemplary - each dish with a story and inspiration described at length and timing impeccable.  Surely adding to the meal were the strangers with whom I dined, the wine taking its toll and everyone joyful in the season, and no more so than when the kitchen passed around a porron before dessert - myself missing a few drops at the beginning but performing admirably while some did far better...and some FAR worse...as everyone laughed along.

Having enjoyed thinkfoodgroup's food in the past but generally not the service é by Jose Andres turned out to be everything I'd hoped for; a truly memorable meal that warrants both the price and the praise - a rarity in fine dining, particularly in Las Vegas.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,3,5,W30STYp_CPaNy5OJRbXrCQ

The food was delicious and I loved how there was a lot of interaction between guests and chefs. I wouldn't be able to pick one favourite dish but, there was one in particular that didn't excite my taste buds--it tasted bitter(theone you had to soak in the liquid). 
 
The group of people we sat with were older and very interesting to say the least. Yes, we all love food just as much as you guys and no we don't have sugar daddy's. FYI.

I came across this Minibar esque restaurant via some advice back in May (btw I ate here in May), from my brother.  Since I have been at almost all of TFG's resaturant I wanted to try this tasting bar tucked behind the Las Vegas Jaleo.  I had concierge call to get me a seating so I did not get to enjoy the wonderful golden tiket to make you feel like you are about to enter Willy Wonka's factory.  But all the wonderful surprises made up for that small detail.

This sea urchin sandwich still makes my mouth water...I also really enjoyed the super crispy chicken skin that came out.  This squid cracker was exceptional and I have to admit that all the dishes were perfect.  The desserts with the minute pound cake inspired from Albert Adria was also a little treat.  

To make the experience even better Jose Andres was in house that day, and came around to check on some other guests from Spain.  It was good to see him that day and made the experience even more enjoyable.  

The price tag is a little high but if you have a chance to get the reservations then I would definitely suggest going and savoring the unique dishes from Spain with the avante garde preparation.",N4tc7CY17z2UwwVea9X5Ow,1,2,5,kq0tOZUDkk0_TU69FxD1dg

To be fair, here are a few positive adjectives that describe the overall time we spent at e: creative, friendly, intimate, knowledgeable, team work, and dedication. At the end of the day though, shouldn't all restaurants have the attributes I just listed? At the end of the day, OVER RATED! OMG! I read all the Yelp reviews below that gave this place 5 stars and thought ""WOW, this is going to be amazing, I can't wait"", and instead, we walked away with, ""WOAH! We paid almost $600 for THAT?! What a joke!"" Later that night, we went to Aria where we were staying and ordered a plate of nachos and fries that was 5% of the cost and much more fulfilling. 

You may ask, ""What about the experience""? Well, if you've never been to a ""classy"" restaurant, paid for $75 for a nice steak, had a nice glass of wine or seen the Food Network, then I will say it again, over rated. Yes, the staff is amazingly coordinated, top notch and its a fun place to watch the staff at work, but I'd rather go to a Cirque show.  There are hundreds of restaurants in Las Vegas and on the Strip and this place would not even hit my top 20 list. 

Of the ~18 dished we had, I remember having one bite of a really nice piece of steak. The funny thing is, they actually showed us the entire cut grilled and we thought, shoot, what is that 10 oz, we can eat that whole thing, but instead, we got one slice each. The freeze dried sangria (1st dish) was a bit weird but interesting.  The beet pita with brie cheese was different but not something I'd prefer and would rather go to a cheese bar.

We made reservations a week prior to date we wanted and were lucky to get in. They made it so hard to give the credit card to reserve the time because they don't take phone calls and don't respond to emails on Mon and Tues. Maybe they think this process adds to their mystery and exclusivity. It's more inconvenient and annoying than anything and who really cares about a golden ticket and piece of paper that says you ate at e, not me. They asked us to arrive 15-30 minutes in advance to our seating and in the end sat us 15 minutes AFTER our seating time.  When you arrive to the Cosmo hotel, no signs or anything to tell you where this dungeon is- we had to ask about 4 people who worked at the hotel and then finally found it at the top level in the main Jose restaurant.

And be prepared to sit in a dark room with random strangers who may get drunk during dinner with their pairing and start having unwanted conversations with you.",ZH-nYIEvpqKvQkinr_Lmpw,14,6,3,DMXo2kY6MUH6ExJvs40FzA

Their reservation and email information is also easy to find so I'll let you do that on your own too.  What I will tell you about is an experience that no foodie should miss if they have an opportunity to get to Las Vegas.

Let me start with getting a reservation.  No frustrating phone call every day at X time, just send a nice email and you can go back and forth with the wonderfully helpful staff until you arrive at a date (I'd book the date first, then plan the rest of the trip so if you don't get the date you want the first time out, it doesn't crush your plans).  Every interaction with the entire staff through the entire experience is wonderful, they really do want you there and it shows.
 
When we arrived we were greeted like we were the most important people in the world.  We waited at the bar for the other guests to arrive, and were given the wine list to browse through and discuss before the 'fun' began.  Once all the guests had arrived, they gathered us and led us into the room, yes it is a separate room.  They attempted to have us sit on the end (one of our party has a food allergy) however the couple that entered first foiled the plan, no worries, Stephanie managed to instantly alert the rest of the staff to the switch up so effectively we didn't even catch the information being relayed.

Each item you see, touch, smell, or taste is purposefully though out, every single experience your senses have during your 2-3 hour time at E was planned.   The room is meant to represent the inner workings of Jose's mind, I'll let you enjoy that on your own, I am sure everyone gets something different from the room.  Suffice it to say that it is both artsy, comfortable and functional.  The seating is in a U shape, but not too tight, finally we have a bit of room to be comfortable in (ever eat at Mini Bar, or Table 21?  You'll know what I mean).

The food, ahh the food.  Did you get this far and think I would say it sucked?  Heck no, it was amazing.  If this is your first experience in molecular gastronomy you picked a great place to start.  If this isn't your first MG experience, welcome, I think this will make your top 3 in the United States. 

As a DC native I always want to see our local restaurants be the best, and we do have the precursor to E here in DC, by Jose` Andres even.  It pains me to say, but yes, E was hands down better than Mini Bar in everything from making a reservation, friendliness of staff, the actual space for the experience and the food itself, was all better at E.

9/??/2011

This restaurant is loud, festive and fun. If you want a quiet and subtle dinner, go sneak a sandwich into a library because this place ain't for you.

This restaurant is also my favorite restaurant in Vegas, taking over the esteemed spot that my beloved Rosemary's Restaurant held for a while (before closing).

What is so great about this place? The food, drinks, service and decor. Did I miss anything? It was fun.

Jaleo is a Spanish Tapas restaurant, so you'll be ordering multiple, small dishes consisting of flavorful servings from the mind of Jose Andres. This wonderful guy might be Spain's greatest ambassador to the world since Fernando Alonso tossed his F1 career in the trash by going to Ferrari. But I digress...

We ordered a number of dishes (mostly the GF's favorites, because a happy GF is a happy GF), and enjoyed the offerings more than any restaurant in recent times. And by enjoyed, I mean ""got a kick out of what we had.""

Dishes that we enjoyed:

- Pan con tomate with Spanish anchovies: The GF loves anchovies and these white anchovies were a knockout. She wholeheartedly approved of this dish.

- Spherical Olives: Molecular gastronomy right here. It looks like an olive, but it's not. Think of a thin membrane that contains the most intense olive juice you will ever experience. Explosion of Olives as soon as you pop one in your mouth.

- Selecciónes de embutidos: A selection of cured Spanish meats. Nice!

- Canelones de cerdo y foie con bechamel: (From the menu) ""Pork and foie gras canelones with béchamel sauce"" - lots of flavor but I wish it was larger so I could indulge myself more. I could've just ordered two dishes and been content, FWIW.

- Croquetas de pollo: Chicken fritters that we demolished in no time.

- And my favorite: José Andrés' Gin and Tonic. This is the Ultimate G&T I've ever had. The nice thing is that I'm ""almost"" able to duplicate it at home w/ the following:

A shot or two of Hendrick's Gin (required - no other Gin will do)
One entire bottle of Fever Tree Tonic Water (you can find this in Honolulu at Tamura's)
Three Juniper Berries (find them in your spice shops)
A sliver of lemon skin with NO PITH. 1/2"" by 2""
A thin slice of Lime
There's one more leaf that I never got the name of. It wasn't Mint or Shiso but I don't use it at home (whatever it is)

- There were a few more plates that were rather good, but I was pretty bulletproof by that time from the Gin and Tonics. So I can't remember what we finished off with exactly.

Tip: Ask for Donny as your server - extremely knowledgeble, funny and observant. The manager John was very excellent and attentive as well, along with our female server on visit #2 (sorry, I missed her name but tipped her well - she was great too!). They treated the GF and I wonderfully on our second visit a few nights later also.

If you haven't noticed, I really enjoy great food with the GF. And nothing makes me happier than knowing she's having a great time at a restaurant. Jaleo is the restaurant that made she and I the happiest, and we will always make it there when visiting Vegas.

I hope you have as much fun as we did.",wP0Mo9UfG3NlwfQeaGUVVg,4,2,5,4ZIAMPctJvelWb6R5SKx1w

We arrived at Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan and were seated at a temporary table where we waited for all of the other diners to arrive.  Once everyone was present, we were moved to a small private dining room and seated at a U-shaped table for nine.  The inside of the U was a table where the chefs would plate each course of the meal.

All of the food was excellent, but for us the highlight of dining at é was definitely watching what was going on inside the U.  We were very impressed by the precision and creativity each of the chefs deployed for each course.  All the diners were encouraged to ask questions about the food and presentation, and we certainly did.  Our questions were warmly received and eagerly answered.  Chef Josabelle in particular seemed very welcoming of our questions, and we really enjoyed being able to interact closely with her and all of the other chefs.

My review:
Probably one of the best restaurants I've eaten at. I've tried multiple 1, 2, and 3 star Michelin restaurants and this one gets 4 stars! Better than Alinea, Per Se, etc.

The exclusivity of the room in the back is just outstanding. The staff are very courteous and make the food in front of you. They're quite attentive, considering the room only fits 8! 

As for the food, I recommend you just look at my pictures. I cannot describe each and every piece of outstanding food I ate. It was not only visually pleasing, but delicious. 

You leave the meal very full - which is amazing since most high end restaurants want you slightly hungry so everything tasted good. The wine pairing (Tier 1) worked really well with the meal. There were stronger/weaker wines, unlike most wine pairings at fancy restaurants where they all taste roughly the same.

The golden ticket is a nice touch, and created a truly memorable experience.

I'd love to come back next time I'm in Vegas... if I can get another golden ticket!

Areas of Improvement:
If you come early, you're forced to sit with the group at a table looking at each other. It created weird conversation for 30 minutes where we really did not care to talk to each other. They try to upsell you on the wine pairing through group pressure, and the $55 truffle upgrade. Since they ask it in a big group, if you don't move forward with it, you may seem like the ""poor"" one out. We were going to get it anyways, but we could sense unease with a few guests.",sILEA5_pp6-wrV2NOhcx0Q,11,3,5,8mgcr155AYv8-0Zm65rSzA

Obviously it's a very different experience than most of his restaurants with only 8 seats and the sheer exclusivity of it adds to the experience itself. 

I have to say though that for me, e is the pinnacle of what JA stands for -- AMAZING food, a unique and unfortgettable experience and service bar none. 

I'm not going to get into every dish we had as every review above and below me has already done that plus the menu changes constantly so your meal will differ from mine anyways.  I will say that every dish that came out was even more amazing than the one you just had and thought couldn't be topped. I can't even pick a 'favorite' as almost all of them were my favorites! 

My least favorite (if there was a least!) was actually the salt encrusted roasted foie gras. I've never had foie gras prepared this way and have to admit I definitely prefer it sauteed or pate style. Don't get me wrong it was okay but roasting it seemed to mellow the fg tasted which for this fg-lover is the last thing I ever wanna do. ;-)  

The amazing food aside, everything else about e is spectacular. It really is like watching a show unfold in front of you with the Chef preparing almost everything right before your eyes. I also love how the servers and chefs coordinate to serve every diner at the exact same moment. The timing is truly amazing.

I'll do my best not to wax poetic here (and slobber all over the page), and others have done a fine job of that, already. I'll try to condense my thoughts and let the pics do the talking.

So roughly speaking, the professionalism, visual and sensory appeal of both the meal and setting, along with personalized feel of the whole meal were amazing. It's intimate, procured, and showy; and I loved it. This is obviously not much of a money maker for Jose Andres' at $200/seat but what it lacks in direct bottom line it surely makes up for in mystique, hype, and respect. 

I highly recommend the drinking flight for some amazing Spanish procured wines. Word of caution to the light-weights, you might want to skip this and be able to actually remember your meal, as they pour generously, and the last flight of the actual meal (not the drink pairing) is a stiff gin tonic. 

Get your reservations as close to 2 months in advance as possible, as there's very limited seating at their two times daily.

Yes I put off writing this review for an embarrassing amount of time, but the wait is now over. é was one of my first bookmarks - If you haven't been, there's a good chance it is one of yours too! Seriously, how can one not be intrigued by a $195 per head price tag, a dinner seating of only 8, reservations a month out, and the ever famous Golden Ticket!?!?

So what can you expect when you visit é? A captivating experience like none other! The presentation was phenomenal! For me, it was a tasting menu of flavors and textures I couldn't even have dreamed of! Every single thing I tried seemed better than the last, which I'm sure was planned! There was such showmanship in watching them prepare each dish. It was interactive both with the chefs and with the other 6 diners; they encouraged questions and photos, but no flash (thus the dark photos).

I still don't know how to express what a marvelous experience I had, other than to say that $594 later, instead of feeling raped I left the restaurant already wanting to schedule my next visit back! (I still need to do that... any takers?) I can't say that any single thing on the menu was to die for, or that any one thing was the best thing I'd ever tasted, yet every taste was enjoyable. Many might feel a price tag like this should leave them in a food coma, or a state of euphoria - é may not do that for you, but it is an all-out experience that I felt was worth every penny.

The menu has likely changed a bit since my visit, and a listing may not mean a whole lot to you so check out my photos. Being that I went to é nearly 10 months ago, I can't recall every detail of every dish, but highlights of my experience were:

The Oyster & Oyster - WOW what a presentation!! One oyster was smoked under a glass dome, and both were strikingly different in taste.

The Morels en Papollote - we were told these mushrooms are only ripe and in season for 1 or 2 weeks a year, so I felt this was an absolute treat to get to experience! What great timing, and oh so delicious!

The Cava Sangria -this was literally an egg-like tasting served on a spoon. You broke the egg for a burst of sweet flavors in your mouth. It was a refreshing palate cleanser.

The Ferrero Rocher - which was served in a tiny red box, like a ring box almost. You opened it up to find a small golden ball, which felt like a gift, and tasted as such!

All in all, the menu was well rounded, each item with a menagerie of flavors. 16 or so courses with lots of meat of various types, light bites, and plenty of decadent desserts! As other reviewers have stated, there are several options for drinks. We opted for a carafe of Sangria which was wonderful, but I think next time I'll elect for a drink package, they are a bit pricey but I personally regretted not doing it - go big or go home!

The experience ended with your bill arriving in a beautiful presentation box (looks like a book). We received wax sealed copies of the night's menu along with their souvenir golden tickets. We were then asked to sign their guest book and were given a bookmark marking the date and guest # we were, so we could look it up again on our next visit.

Overjoooooooooyed!  

Sangria 2015: Frozen red wine accompanied by little bursts of fruit presented in a half bottle to be scooped with two little spoons.  This must be how Willy Wonka gets bombed while watching reruns of ""Friends"".  It was a terrific ""beverage"" to start the meal.    

Spanish Pizza: I love burnt cheese like nobody's business.  These geniuses of food made it the crust for heavenly bites topped with Andres' fantastic ""Jamon"" and ricotta cheese.  How much would a full on large pizza like this be?  $1000?  More?  Unreal.  What is it like to be the duke/duchess here?

Beet Gazpacho:  Appearing like a fancy French pastry sold at Jean Philippe, the intense flavor was pretty eye opening, not easy for an Asian guy :D  That they even pulled this kind of richness out of a beet, one of the most non-offensive, unassuming vegetables ever (the Greg Kinnear of veggies?) is beyond me.  The sorbet-like quality was surely a big reason. 

Iberico Chickpeas:  This gave me the satisfaction and entertainment of every Vegas show I've seen in the last year all in one bowl and in less than 5 minutes.  Through the spherification cooking technique, the garbanzo beans had an ikura quality to it where they would pop in your mouth with only slight pressure.  Mixed in with the rest of the ingredients (I may have blacked out due to culinary ecstasy when the chef explained everything), the explosion of tastes in each spoonful was otherworldly.  I was the last one to finish as I wanted to savor every bean to its maximum potential.  

""Empanada"": Foie Gras cotton candy gyoza.  Formed, pressed right before our very eyes and eaten by hand, the combination of the fatty duck liver, light candy sweetness and Corn Nuts (?!), was an incredible mix that floored me.  Sign me up for 100 of these.      

Brandida Bacalao: Salt fish chicharron topped with truffle.  The fish air foam the chef delicately placed on top of each our pieces was like a fairy godmother granting wishes.  Light, airy and amazing, this could have probably been finished in two bites.  I ate it like a rat and managed six.  Are the employee dinners anywhere close to the magnificence of this stuff?  I would wash dishes for free.

Fun, creative, and extremely delicious, I'd gladly go back in a heartbeat.  If forced to choose, I'd go with é over Joel Robuchon considering the similar price point and for overall entertainment factor, but you couldn't go wrong with either for a dinner and show all rolled up into one.

5551321,2017-02-16,18,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"You know, it is with great disappointment that I sit here and still feel the way I did when leaving E, which is man did I expect far too much and receive far too little.

The setup is perfect for me. I am in the best possible way a snobby pretentious pos. So, a sealed off room in the back of one of my favorite Vegas tapas restaurants that only seats 8 people and comes with 21 courses and costs $250 a person should be a slam dunk for me.

I tried to rationalize it over and over. Oh that dish was pretty good I guess. Oh I'm sure I won't be hungry by the end Im only on course 10. But as time went on it dawned on me. There is a food experience out there that I legitimately believe is all style no substance and that is E.

Im not going to bother going through the 21 courses. Suffice to say a course at this place can be something as good as a great small piece of ribeye to a single piece of cheese to a single gummy worm made with something acidic enough to burn my throat. 

Issue #1: I was left hungry. Contrast this with Robuchon, which I have been to here in vegas and costs nearly twice as much, there is no chance I'm left hungry there. The meal is sized perfectly. But at E it almost feels as if considerations such as hunger were thrown out the door. It's not a meal it's an experience they say. To that I say f*ck off.

Issue #2: The dish quality ranged from great to pretty bad, never something amazing, and frequently something that I just wouldn't want to eat again (reference gummy worm above). Perhaps it was the edible alcohol courses that I found lacking, perhaps it was the feeling that a few too many dishes were frozen with liquid nitrogen, or maybe it's just that to be this experimental with a dining experience there will be some hits and misses. And that's what it feels like. Contrast to Robuchon where maybe one 1 out of the 16 courses I found to be meh, E had perhaps 10 that I would say I have no desire to really eat ever again. I'd eat the ribeye over and over, the asparagus and caviar, the cheese, some of the deserts, but thats about it. The gimmick of plating in front of us is cute but I have a feeling it's designed to appeal to the uninitiated, the tourists who think Vegas should be dinner and a show. I'll take better tasting dishes and no pointless plating display any day of the week.

Issue #3: Group seating is a downfall. I didn't think about it going in even though I should have, but my hatred of other people became even more increasingly clear that night. One lone attendee who would not shut his goddam mouth, speaking as if he was a restauranteur even though he was my age. He was capable of ruining the experience by himself, and he did. This, though, falls on E, they made the decision to make it a group experience and there are consequences.

Here's how I look at it. Jaleo, the main restaurant where E is housed, is tremendous. The dishes are great, well portioned, and of an exceptional quality. It would be nearly impossible for me to spend $250 on food in the main restaurant and not keel over. Which makes the point for me. If the main restaurant is better...and cheaper...and I don't have to listen to annoying little sociopaths, why would I ever go back to E?

The answer: I wouldn't.

5589852,2018-04-12,15,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"é in Las Vegas was probably the most intimate dining experience I've had. You share a chef's table with eight total diners in a private room tucked inside Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan. We shared our seating with five guys at a bachelor party and a solo diner. For a bachelor party, our dinner mates were ironically quiet!

When we arrived, we were initially seated at a high top in Jaleo with our fellow diners. They presented the first course at this time - edible branches made from liquified kalamata olives, presented like a centerpiece. 

My husband took the liberty to also order a plate of the best jamon -  jamón ibérico de bellota fermín and some pan de cristal con tomate. Excessive I know, but I indulged in it as well!

After we finished our snack, we were led inside the é private dining room. The first thing I noticed was the interesting decor - one chef said it was like a snapshot inside Chef José Andrés mind. See my photos for the creepy doll and some heels going up a ladder!

Upon seating, we were given a hot towel in the mold of José's hand. We kicked off the meal with some wine by the glass and watched the 22 course performance unfold over the next two hours. 

My highlights:

Wonder Bread - This looked like a simple mini sandwich, but the bread was actually apple meringue with foie and pear filling.

Uni & Lardo - This was one of my favorite small bites, as I love anything uni. Though the thick, crunchy base was a tad overwhelming to the delicate uni.

Asparragos Escabeche - Such an intricate and memorable dish to watch them make. It was also one of my favorite tasting - I loved the bright flavors and texture contrast.

Txangurro a la Donostiarra - The simple crab meat was enhanced with a rich vial of crab broth and some crunchy bread crumbs for contrast.

Platija - The fluke over a bed of chicken course was pretty to look at but uncomfortably salty for my taste.

Fricando - wagyu beef cheek, gnocchi, chanterelles, pine nut. This was my favorite of the savory dishes. The gnocchi had a surprising texture that reminded me of popping boba! The chanterelles were so delightful, and the beef cheek was nicely tender.

Desserts - The three plated desserts satisfied my tooth nicely - great presentation, layers of flavor, and texture contrast. The modern take on Intxaursaltsa (walnut, raspberry, hazelnut) was especially enjoyable.

Overall, I thought the chef's table at é was a good experience but quite robotic with no real standout dishes. Perhaps the presentation was so intricate that the chefs had to focus on plating at the cost of diner interaction. It was missing the level of engagement that we experienced at the modern chef's counter at The Bazaar by José Andrés in LA. My favorite chef's table service to date was at Playground 2.0 in Orange County - a winning combination of exceptional approachability, enthusiasm, and education.

After our 22 bite-sized dishes, we weren't hungry, but we were craving something more hearty, like the paella from Jaleo. We put ourselves in the server's hands, and she surprised us with the Paella Mixta on the house. As we sat at the Jaleo bar and dug into the paella, this hit the spot unlike anything else from é. As intricate and fun as é was to watch, it was missing soul, which the paella had. Sometimes simpler is better.",qNVAPkw1aNyNKGiJzmgWZA,27,24,4,CXhQ2s8wSZwG6DNeAf2SkA
5601683,2018-04-30,7,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"Actual rating 4.5.

Since my last review Jaleo has become one of my family's go-to restaurants, especially if we have to think of a restaurant on-the-fly. It is a reasonably priced restaurant for Vegas standards (read: still expensive for tapas elsewhere) as my siblings and I were able to try a wide variety of tapas and still pay $52.95, including tax and tip. We ended up getting at least 2 plates per person.

The key is to get an even balance of tapas. This should include some carb and a bit more non-carb items. Ideally it should also be part vegetarian, part seafood and part red/non-red meat but this can vary depending on the party. Our party felt happy with our selection.

With our parents dining elsewhere we were able to be a little more experimental with our selection. There were some staples along with some new items.
- Pan de cristal con tomate ($12.50). The Catalonian version of bruschetta using a bread with lots of holes due to carbonation. The result is an excellent starter as the bread doesn't fill you up as fast. The tomato paste is light as well.
- Salmon tartar with salmon roe cones ($5/cone). Pricey for such a simple cone but it is so well executed it's one of my favorite appetizers at any restaurant. More appropriately an ideal amuse-bouche but not complementary.
- Squid with aioli and piparra peppers ($22). The squid doesn't have much breadcrumb topping. It's also quite light. The piparra peppers are similar to pepperoncinis except thinner. It's less spicier than jalapeno.
- Shrimp and lobster fritters ($14). Considering it's a fritter it's not anything too fancy. Though small, it provides a burst of taste in that one fritter.
- Grilled Merino lamb with rosemary sauce and honey aioli ($25.50). The weakest selection of the bunch not necessarily due to taste but merely because rack of lamb is not necessarily limited to Spanish cuisine. A good rack of lamb tastes the same no matter what restaurant you go to. 
- Patatas bravas ($11.50). They serve the carb-heavy tapas last. This would be the weakest tapa for taste simply because the potatoes aren't crispy, which is essential to a patatas bravas preparation. The brava sauce makes the potato soft so it has to be crunchy to be able to hold the sauce. Will skip this in the future, but I'm disappointed because patatas bravas is one of my favorite Spanish tapas.
- Chicken and wild mushroom paella ($25). The best paellas are simple. I was happy about this presentation because the dish was still hot when served and the chicken portions were generous. Rice was served al dente.
Normally a dessert would be ordered here but ever since Milk Bar opened one floor down we just opted for dessert there because it's so renowned. 

Jaleo is best suited for small group dining due to tapas best for social dining. Might be too pricey for party of 2 unless you really splurge for their ""é"" dinner-in-a-show experience, a unique experience even for Vegas standards. Either way you can't go wrong.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,10,8,4,rCC4IJ-UGLQ6F-AHCDZQcw
5611341,2015-07-05,0,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"This place is amazing, in the conversation for best meal I've ever had.. You should eat here. But there are a couple of practical details that you should know before dining here.

1. If you get the truffle upgrade, you really only need one for two people (they are $55 per person). They shave a fair amount of truffle onto the courses that get them (ours had two truffle-enhanced courses), and it was easily enough for me to just spoon half of the shavings onto my wife's plate and still enjoy them. So, if you're dining with a date or a friend, save yourself $55 and just get one upgrade between the two of you and share.

2. Don't do the wine pairing ($130 per person). After doing wine pairing at a number of restaurants of this type (the multi-course dinner-as-theater tasting menu), I've come squarely down on the side of ""No wine pairing."" Places like this tend to overserve you on the wine, and while that sounds awesome (hooray! lots of booze!), really you just end up drunk which makes it harder to enjoy the intricacies of the meal. Here, after serving you basically an entire bottle of wine per person, they cap it off with a cocktail for a digestif. As an alternative, you can buy spend $130 on ONE bottle of something you like and two cocktails without too much trouble. That's plenty of alcohol for this meal (I like getting tight as much as anyone, but if I'm going to spend a bajillion dollars on a meal, I want to be present for every second of it. That's just my preference).

Do those two things, you'll save around $200 on the bill and you won't be missing out on anything that anyone else at the table is experiencing.",T0fiFS4_jLJZXLNS-DpkOw,2,1,5,eLt-Etd1myPfrIqDjQAwgQ

My favorites were the frozen sangria, the crab and the beef.  There was an asparagus dish that was amazing as well.  I had the Spanish wine pairing and while I didn't finish all of the wines, I would definitely recommend doing the pairing.

Also, they were very accommodating to me and allowed me to change my reservation from the early seating to the late one. 

I wouldn't recommend this for everyone because if you are a person who likes to only eat items that are familiar to you, this would be a miserable experience, but if you are a little adventurous and willing to try new things, you will not be disappointed.",FnuAuyrkQ1gdWi-Vil5B9Q,1,0,5,R7ORa9yqcNc4D9aKTWyazA

The dining room is small and intimate with seating for only 8 guests. Walls are lined with unique art and card catalog drawers which are actually functional for the staff. 

There were more courses than I can remember. Each dish is elegantly prepared in front of you as if you are watching a foodie cirque show!

If dining as a couple or even as friends I suggest getting one of each: the alcohol and non alcohol paring to compliment your dinner. The non alcohol beverages were incredible!

5677033,2014-10-04,4,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"Wow. Just wow. My friend decided to treat me out to E for my 21st birthday (I'm a lucky girl) as Jose Andres is my favorite chef. After being mailed our golden tickets in the mail, we eagerly went at 5:00pm for the first seating (5:30pm). They only have two seatings each night of 8 people- so a total of 16 people per night. Reservations must be made months in advance to get the seats you want as it is difficult to score the perfect ones. They first sat us outside at a communal bar/ table with the other 6 people, and give a brief introduction of whats to come (20 concept dishes that Chef Jose Andres has created) and what kind of pairing you want. Having been to Jaleo before, I was extremely confused as to where and how E could be so well hidden. But alas, it was right next to the bar on the left back corner, and the hostess had the door open for us as we walked through. 

Upon being seated, we were immediately given a warm towelette wrapped in lavendar that was placed in a mold of Jose Andres' hand. The chef of the day, Alex, explained to us that everything in the room had a story to tell- such as the uneven ladder with shoes which symbolized the girl who got away, to the doll trapped in the cage- the one who didn't get away. On the sides, there were ingredients that have inspired Chef Jose Andres throughout the years. 

We got the regular alcohol pairing which came with wines, moscato, vermouth, gin and tonic, sangria, and more. The La Tomatila (i think thats what its called) is an amazing tomato water infused drink- must order! I dont even like tomatos that much but damn was this good. All of the dishes are plated in front of you, you are free to ask as many questions as you want, an explanation is given for all the dishes, and everything is served at the same time- service at its best.

I would go into a detailed description of everything I ate, but that would only ruin the surprise for future guests. I will however, give a gist of what I ate and let imagination do the rest~ 

Edible Sangria that came in a Styrofoam box 5/5

Cotton Candy 2.0- Cotton Candy Dumpling with Foie Gras Mousse and Hazelnuts 6/5 (best thing all night)

Beet-kini- dehydrated beet manchego cheese sandwich (Chef Jose's version of a grilled cheese, the perfect bikini for summer) 5/5

Coca De Recapte- sausage and foie gras? crisp 5/5

Merienda- after school snack that kids in Spain got- basically a bun stuffed with goat cheese (I hate goat cheese and this surpassed my expectations) 5/5

Smoked Oyster and Chicken Oyster- Definitely unique and extremely different. 4/5
 
Pescado en Adobo- Codfish stick- the fish is much thicker than regular deep fried fish, not enough sauce for me. 3/5

El Vermut- Mussels- 4/5

Cava Sangria- sangria jelly in a spoon that bursts in your mouth. 5/5

Fabes con Jamon- Jellied Fava beans in a thick rich broth- not a big fan of beans, but wow. 5/5

Kokotxas al Pil Pil- Codfish Jowls- first time trying these, pretty chewy but delicious. 4/5 

Mar y Montana- sea cucumber stuffed with pork. really interesting take on this dish. 4/5 The lady next to me asked the chef if the sea cucumber was a fish or a plant....

Mushrooms en Papillote- Chanterelle Mushrooms- smoked in a plastic bag and when cooked, the bag is cut for you to eat. wow. This presentation... 5/5

Chuleta- bomb but small piece of steak. I was so full at this point but still amazing 5/5

Dessert- 
Pressed Cotton Candy with flowers and creme underneath- best dessert I have ever had. I wanted like 10 of these. 6/5

Jellied egg yolk- with some cream. again, super impressed. 5/5

Rum and coffee- this one takes 20 min to prepare, so you see a lady stirring the drink while it is on fire at the side for awhile. 5/5

Chocolate cylinder that cracks open with liquid inside and crumble.. most delicious chocolate dessert ever. 5/5

Ring Box with Hazelnut Ferrero Roche type chocolate- 5/5 

The last dessert- it was okay. Dont remember it much. 3/5

Mignardises- the four treats on the dish were so good- I couldnt choose what to finish first. 

Anyways, I felt so repetitive talking about how amazing all the dishes are, but thats the truth. Everything blew my mind away.The intimacy of the room and the environment made this experience unparalleled to any other dining experience I've had. Not only was the food and drinks on point, the service and decor only added the cherry to the icing. The only complaint I have was one of the guests, who made a huge deal of everything she couldnt eat, not finishing, and requesting substitions. At the end, you receive a book where you write a message to Jose Andres, and a bookmark saying what number visitor you are (11,788). You also receive a menu to take home, but it doesnt say much- just the title of the concept. Total came out to be around $900 for two (including tip), as the alcohol pairing was pretty expensive as well.

Their email address is reserve@ebyjoseandres.com. We requested a specific date and gave 2 other dates/times as backup options in case the first reservation wasn't available. They email you back to let you know which date they can accommodate and you must email back a reservation form. The cost is 195/person. The cancellation policy is as follows: 2 week cancellation prior to reservation to avoid a cancellation fee. Less than 2 weeks and you will have to pay 50% of the total cost of the reservation. No shows incur 100% of the total cost of the reservation. So if there are no reservations available, I would recommend checking 2 weeks before your desired date in case there are cancellations. We also received golden tickets in the mail, which was cute, but not needed for check-in at the restaurant.

The actual restaurant is located behind a curtain inside Jaleo. It's very intimate and has bar seating layout. Each dinner seating accommodates about 8 people and you really are sitting directly in front of the chefs, so you can see every dish they prepare and ask them questions. We had so many dishes that there's no way we could remember them all. At the end, they provided a small take home menu showing each dish we ate that night.

A wonderful tasting menu of Chef Andrés' avant garde Spanish cuisine.  We were served 20 small bites and 5 wines over approximately 2.5 hours.  My favorites were the Apple ""Brazo de Gitano"", José Taco, Bocata de ""Calamares"" and my slice of the ""Whole Lobe of Foie Gras Baked in Sea Salt""

It's not cheap - $250 plus tax/person - but this price includes food, wine AND gratuity.  They have two seating per night at 5:30 and 8:30, and only 8 diners per seating so the experience/service is unmatched.  And while I don't make enough money to call anything 250 bucks an absolute steal, compared to many other high-end restaurants in Vegas I wouldn't hesitate to call é a bargain.

If all you care about is getting as full as possible for as little cash as possible, the Cosmopolitan Hotel has a wonderful buffet one floor down which I'm sure you'll enjoy more.  If you love interesting, innovative, delicious food, and are willing to pay for some superior ingredients and service, é is an experience that shouldn't be missed.

Start with a cocktail /spanish wine as you take in the ambience that's Jaleo, with background shouts of 'Paella!' Then take your seats in José's private room with his card catalog of chotskes. 

They're very accommodating to food allergies. But if you're vegan, kosher, dairy free, you're out of luck. (Besides, you're in Vegas. Kick the diet to the curb for a few days and burn off calories at the craps table). Everyone else prepare to taste anything from a peanut butter wonder bread, to hairy crab, beef, scallops, uni, edible sangria and more. The menu changes to their whim. We had a few dishes that were different from our visit 1yr ago, and a few favorites (hello ) that's kept on the menu.

We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our reservations as suggested and waited at Jaleo. Our waitress assisted us in making suitable drink choices which would please our palates and paired well with dinner. We were then taken to a private cozy yet comfortable dining room where a team of chefs awaited us. They introduced themselves and recited love sonnets about Chef Jose Andres from the beginning to the end. 

Food - I may just not be fancy enough of a foodie to truly appreciate and really ""love"" this place as so many other reviewers seem to. It was hands down the prettiest 20+ plates of food that I have eaten in my life so far - no doubt! Every dish that came out was more creative and visually appealing than the previous. Even the serving plates were gorgeous and unique. The entire experience was thoroughly enjoyable despite the average $400 person price tag (adding drinks). 

But you know when you eat something and as soon as your plate is finished - your tongue, brain, and tummy are all sooo happy together that your only thought is ""Damn, when do I get this in my belly again??""  For some reason, I didn't feel that way towards a single plate. Everything was great to have once, but there was nothing I would crave to have again. 

Despite having said that, I still suggest that if you're on the fence about trying this place - totally go for it!! Its honestly a dinner AND a show. We eagerly awaited each upcoming plate the entire time like giddy kids who were waiting to go on the next ride. 

You also get to ""people watch"" very closely since you dine at one large table. A woman practically scolded her husband quite louldly on the apposite end of the table for leaving a couple specs of caviar on the plate and called him a ""sinner"" with all the seriousness in the world.

I'm a vegetarian with an egg allergy, and a teetotaler to boot, but é was able to accommodate me. Unfortunately for any vegans hoping to show up here, they mentioned that they probably could not accommodate a vegan, so I'm sorry, vegans :( I guess dairy is pretty integral to a lot of the food. Anyhow, as such, my menu was a bit different from most of my companions (although another member of my group doesn't eat any seafood outside of seaweed, so she also got some of the same replacement dishes). For instance, instead of the foie gras donut, I got a truffle creme filled donut (super tasty, because I love truffle). They did a pretty good job with the vegetarian stuff, although vegetarians should probably be aware that they don't seem to consider gelatin a non-vegetarian food--I was served a gummy as part of the ""more things"" course and asked about the gelatin, and they said yes, it contained it, so I gave it to Mr. Piano. 

Favorites were probably the roasted pepper and truffle dish (a replacement dish for one of the seafood items), the raspberry paper (replacement for the gazpacho sandwich), the truffle donut (replacement for the foie gras donut), the spherified drink (rosemary lemonade instead of sangria on account of my inability to ingest alcohol without intense pain), the cheese & hazelnut dish (esp. the hazelnut spheres), the olive branches, the almond milk frozen foam dish, and that delicious little raspberry disc on the ""more things"" fan. All of my substitution dishes were really tasty, and I was really happy with the use of truffle on my dishes, which really make you feel like you're getting your money's worth (a rare feeling for those who dine vegetarian). I also kept the adorable pizza box the cheese crisp pizza came in; I am a sucker for miniature things :P

It's also fantastic that they have some actual decent non-alcoholic drinks! The non-alcoholic sangria is really wonderful (I had two glasses, because I am a glutton), and I also really enjoyed the Shirley Temple with house-made grenadine! The rosemary lemonade, which I got a shot of in my spherified drink course, was also lovely and I hope to be able to recreate that one, at the very least, at home.

Everything here has a touch of luxuriousness and a lot of detail (including things like the golden tickets). The staff, who move like ninjas to clear away plates at just the right time, were really kind and personable when not being ninjas (and were otherwise as if they weren't actually there). The kitchen staff were really lovely about talking to us about the food, what goes into making it (some of it is pretty complicated or requires a lot of specialized equipment). The dishes are hand selected, and the presentation of many things (like the ""pillows"" arriving on doll couches) are very particular and really neat. This really is a must for a foodie who likes to know how things are made or wants to make similar modernist/gastronomy stuff at home.

I did not have to pay to eat here; and as such, money is not the reason I'm unhappy about Jaleo.  But, I couldn't IMAGINE if I DID pay to eat here, for how SUBSTANDARD they are.

Even DISREGARDING MONEY, this place is a joke & a failure.  When you consider money, it becomes absurd. 

Food portions are smaller than bite-size ($10 for a piece of cheese the size of two fingers).

You WILL leave hungry, unless you are anorexic.

Worst of all, the TASTE/QUALITY of the food is below-average.  For example, the paella was a scoop of OVERLY SALTY and greasy poorly-made rice, with three tiny (bony!) pieces of dry meat.

Drinks -- gin & tonic -- tastes like a regular ""gin & tonic.""  LMAO.  But the bourbon drink was better, at least.

Service -- our waitress gave us bad vibes.  She was unhappy.  SUPER ANNOYING.  She would ask us questions like ""everything ok?"" while we were talking (interrupting us).  Then, she would be gone for a long time, and we'd have trouble getting basic things.

Decor -- really lame.  Not interesting.  The only interesting thing are the kitchens, because of the BBQ & fire.  Too bad what comes out of them sucks! :(

I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE this place, but it's such a failure.  Unless they change things drastically, it won't be there much longer than a year.  Mark my words!

In the casino, I saw a small group of people put down somewhere between $30,000 to $40,000 on a roulette table (at one time), and then losing it all, with one roll of the wheel.  But you see, that didn't disturb them, and I know why:  roulette is clearly a game of chance, and they knew that.  When I chose to gamble at whatever games I chose, I went into those situations knowing it was just that -- a gamble.  But, dinner at Jaleo:  disappointing and frustrating!  Because the bottom line is, the food is NOT GOOD, and the portions are tiny.  Thus, I left hungry and disappointed.  I'd even have eaten bad food because I was hungry, ha ha.

It's amazing how you can go to Burgr and get a world-class burger that is completely fulfilling and incredible for, like, $14, but at Jaleo, the tab goes into the HUNDREDS for just two people-- just for appetizers and simple drinks.  (Remember! -- I didn't have to pay for my ""experience"" there).

There are lots of great reviews for Jaleo, but remember:  ""If a thousand people say a dumb thing, it's still a dumb thing.""  In my case, I have no connections to this place, and no reason to give it any specific rating.  I'm just being honest.  

I know that, being human, most people are blinded by advertising and their high expectations, and are therefore biased.  Also, most people (at least ones I know), find it conflicting to realize they didn't like some food after they pay hundreds of dollars for it.  I'm not trying to put them down, but trying to present insight (and understand for myself) where there are so many GOOD reviews for this place.",WFcDOsTSZwOHE77H_bL1fA,3,2,1,09517lTxGkOjm-FWCOPXyw

We were greeted at the entrance of Jaleo where we waited for our meal to start at a small bar table. Our first course came in the shape of edible branches with flowers on them. Very unique, though not really tasty. Once we head into our dining area, we noticed a very oddly decorated room full of filing drawers on the wall. The dining area was like a sushi bar and very personal. The chefs came out and introduced them selves and told us we can ask all the questions we want went eating. Each course is very unique and time consuming to make. They play with flavors and texture like nobodies business. My favorite was the scallop with the foie gras and the miracle bread. Absolutely a science of cooking. There were quite a bit of courses so I am baffled that some reviews say they were still hungry after the meal. My guess is that if you need to eat something with substance every meal, this may not be for you. Each course is very well thought out and very tasty, but they are small and are more for tasting than to fill you up. Personally, I feel like the whole meal was more than I can finish and I eat big portions.",heS-e0DVgZ-qIbs5P91dRQ,0,0,5,ENyJFTggWQgmG2AKXzlckA

The food was incredible from start to finish.  I appreciated how you incorporated modern techniques and whimsical presentations without sacrificing traditional, classic Spanish flavors.  I also loved the look and feel of the room.  But the highlight of this meal was not the food, nor was it the room.  It was the lead chef who presented the meal to us.  I cannot remember her name, but she is the short, bubbly, brunette who is from Puerto Rico and previously worked at Bouchon in Las Vegas.  Her passion and enthusiasm for your food is infectious.  I have never met anyone who loves what they do more than this chef.  I don't know if you've ever had the chance to see her interacting with diners, but she is an absolute natural and you should make sure she is a part of the E family for a long, long time.  

Thanks again for a wonderful evening.",BNQ2ZTmK13yfvFEbGfhLLw,2,2,5,uFGuBmQpLpFZp03KYNuFpg

I'm giving 4 stars because it is REALLY loud and pricey.  

Food is delicious.  We didn't have one thing that we didn't like.  Loved the gin and tonic oysters as well as the mussels.  The best mussels I've ever had.  (the ones with broth)

Drink menu is interesting as well.   

Don't think you'll be able to have a nice quiet chat with your dining companions.  CRAZY loud in the restaurant.",UQhaNSBjUqax4JJcq1lyoA,1,1,4,KFrAemRH4wFKT0YQt1_mAA

I found out about this one of a kind place through a friend and started to research more into it, long story short I decided to set a reservation.

Reservation: I felt the reservation process was not as bad as some say it is, all I did was sent a list of dates that's feasible for travel to LV from Cali. I waited a week or two and received an email with an available date! I followed their directions and booked right away. The reservations are made usually almost 3 months out, gives us a sufficient time to plan our travels.

Food: Absolutely amazing! This is fine dining so expect a tiny dish, but the food art and concept is aaaaamazing, every chef takes their job seriously and the work put into it shows immensely! all the chefs are cute and good looking too! lol. On a serious note, the chefs are there to answer your questions, and will educate you using scientific food facts and vocabulary. I loved it!

Overall: The whole experience is a show in itself, I want to do it again just to try their menu as it changes. They do keep 5-6 main dishes and change out the others every quarter. For the price, I feel it is absolutely worth it, for it is a one of a kind experience from the food, the art, presentation, and the room that you are sat in!

*note: this place can only sit 8 people at a time, there current schedule is 530pm and 830pm wed-sun. They are working on adding an extra day.",tuDL8ANfWb68fC9Hc-CNxg,6,4,5,LvGjLBHG3M9ycst2AIUlsg

the food is definitely delicious though and credit definitely goes to the chefs for executing such creative dishes. special standouts to me were the fried chicken skin/oyster and iberico pork dishes. I even tried uni and caviar for the first time! while i enjoyed both and im glad i tried both, i hate to say it but i dont think i have a palate for fancy food like that haha...i really recommend getting the alcoholic pairings for additional ~$110 per person. I think i got 9 or so drinks with the pairing in addition to the already included alcohol dishes on the menu.

The customer service at E is what really impressed me though! from start to finish, it was an awesome experience. after initially sending in my reservation email...I received a response, sent back my form and got my confirmation back within 48 hours. Got my golden tix a few days before my dinner and i was ready to go! upon my arrival to Jaleo, we were escorted to our dining room and the E team is so wonderful, friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Even though the meal is $160-ish a person, the staff didnt make it feel stuffy at all. it was a very casual, relaxed atmosphere and they encouraged us to ask questions and conversate amongst ourselves. 

Stephanie, Mia, Lisa, Alfie (sp?) - thank you so much for a wonderful time! i learned so much, tried so many new food/drinks and had an amazing birthday dinner! is truly a once in a lifetime experience especially since i don't think Justin B's credit card liked that dinner total ;) haha",HO35wso-psqx0GF--QSwGA,4,4,5,5c2LjfHvVERBXCpfQG7GQg
5961838,2017-05-30,4,mvyVz0gm3gdPVGg3M-o75g,"é by José Andrés is not only about the food, although the food is incredible, it is truly an experience. Reservations used to be next to impossible and the restaurant recently switched to a ticketing system. With a much high level of commitment, availability for busy Memorial Day weekend was good even one month out.

We booked the 8:30 timeslot and were excited to be taken on a journey. There are only two seatings a night, each with 8 people. We met the others outside at Jaleo and enjoyed our olive branch snack. After chatting a bit, we were taken into the private dining room. The seats were arranged in a semi-circle around the area where the chefs put together each course.

There were over 20 courses and each one was full of love and creativity. I'll spare you the descriptions of each course and point out a few standouts.
-The cheese bites at the beginning set the tone for the meal. The black/white ""pebble"" was rich and stunning.
-The PB&J was so cool. The bread was light and the ""B"" was a foie gras spread with the ""J"" being fresh raspberries. I had never seen a dish like this before. It was so good.
-The crab course was delicate and balanced. Crab meat was served in a crab shell and broth was poured over.
-I have a soft spot for Santa Barbara spot prawns. This course was raw and featured the freshness of the beautiful shellfish. It was my favorite course.
-The largest course was Australian Wagyu cheek with potato gnocchi and morels. The meat melt in my mouth and the lightness of the potato gnocchi paired well with the meatiness of the wagyu.
-Cotton candy empanada - This is such a cool idea. I bet you've never seen anything like it before.

The meal was $320 per person including tax & tip (no drinks) and it was well worth the price for a memorable experience. The interaction with the chefs was so cool and you could tell that they love what they do.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,10,4,5,ExvrD7YyDSvtzZSo7YZesA
