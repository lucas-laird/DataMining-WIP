The food is amazing, everyone was helpful, and then I don't know what happened.  I tried to order something very simple (Hummus w/Ground Beef) and 2.5 hrs later my food didn't come.  Then they tell me they are closing and can't deliver my food now but they are sorry and I can call back and speak with Alexander and get a discount.   Then I call back and the owner is someone else, Julia, and they don't know what I'm talking about.  So all in all I'd say I'm never coming back here again but it was good while it lasted, kinda like a relationship in your 20s - Anthony",LNHbhiHdvrjGPJfDEWVwcw,2,0,2,SNWQLNgpOCJTus2k8E6qsg

We ordered Hummus w/ Meat, Carne Asada Fries, Chicken Fingers, a Chicken Burrito, piece of Kiss Cake and piece of Russian Cake.  It took 90 minutes, the food was ALL cold and flavorless, what little we ate of it.  They didn't send any bread with the hummus and the driver said the kitchen was closed and there was nothing he could do to help, so we didnt' open the hummus immediately.  Well, when we did open the hummus, it was ROTTEN.  The meat had mold growing on it, it smelled rotten, it made my nephew vomit from the smell of it.  I wouldn't let anyone eat another bite of the prepared food for fear of food posioning.  I did think it would be safe to try the cakes, but the Kiss cake was freezer burned, so I didn't even try the other cake.  I contacted Eat24 and sent them the photos of the hummus and we were given a full refund.  Its just shameful to send something out that you know is rotten....the smell alone was so strong that there is no way they didn't know it was bad.",pHUaTI-n_eZg8M_Nu8WMdQ,0,0,1,mZMVtGVxAF1MAWSSRfGCww

289092,2015-05-24,0,pcG0vJiTtDcTb0y3pKFUZQ,"Meh, meh and meh... I really had hope for this place but it started evaporating as soon as I saw signs on their door: ""18+ only"" and ""No weapons allowed"". Was that a joke or they really are having issue with minors shooting guns there?

After looking at the menu that was listing Russian, American,Mediterranean and... Mexican food I had a feeling that they are really struggling with their culinary ""identity"". Russian food choices were pretty standard (borsch, pelmeni and vareniki) but after some hesitation I've ended up ordering chicken lula kebab. Unfortunately that was an utter greasy disappointment that I could barely eat. Everyone seems to be raving about their potatoes which I found to be absolutely nothing special too. 

Decor looks like the place came out of 90s time machine. 

I really think most of the 5* reviews are either fake or produced by employees and their relatives. 

I still think that the place has a potential and if they want to attract more (American) customers (read - not just sketchy looking middle eastern men smoking hookah) they can easily do it by:
* simplifying the menu to just have Russian and Mediterranean food.
* change the decor... it's just a complete disaster right now
If that doesn't happen this Dacha will end up bankrupt before we know it... you can sustain business on just vodka drinking parties. It was a lunch time on the weekend and we were almost the only customers.

Otherwise if you want to have a decent kabob head out to Kabob House for now (heck... at least they don't charge any extra for the salad and their meat is done right)

Verdict: Not coming back unless I get paid to eat there.

PS. Kids are not welcome there either. They didn't even have a high chair available :/",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,5,1,2,nu0jB2S9ytB33quVoD5jMA

Got some beef stroganoff, cabbage and beef pirojki (bit of a false cognate with pierogi; these are more like phyllo pastry turnovers), stuffed cabbage (prefer the ones I make at home, but that's more a style thing than a quality one -- these were good), and vareniki (which is an order of pierogies).

Definitely recommended as a change-up from the usual pizza/wings/thai/chinese takeout selection. Just as stick-to-your-ribs though.

Came in late at night, again to blasting music and flashing lights. It's telling that every single one of their customers opted to sit outside on the patio. I noticed that the regulars weren't ordering any food. Menu has added American and Mexican food options like burgers, nachos, and burritos. I understand that they're trying to pull in more business, but it brings to mind the ""jack of all trades, master of none"" phrase.

We ordered four dishes: cabbage pirozky, vinaigrette, julien, and the Olivier we fondly remembered from last time. The pirozky were the only item that were okay, and they were not made in house. The vinaigrette tasted like a basic salad of pickled vegetables. There was minimal beet in a dish that is supposed to be beet-based. The julien looked like a soup in the menu photo but what we received was like a personal pizza, topped with mozzarella and mushrooms. It's hard to find those flavors unappealing, but that is NOT julien. They apparently cannot make the dishes on their menu.
As for the Olivier? It was flat-out disgusting. It looked congealed, as if it had been sitting out, exposed to air, for hours. Flavor was completely off and just bad. We took one bite, and immediately asked for the bill.

As for the service? Our server was a very sweet lady. But she knows nothing about Russian food. We voiced our concerns and she reported back to the kitchen and owner, but no one ever came out to speak with us. Our basic order took 40 minutes, and we were the only table ordering and most of the dishes were premade. To top it off, a group of regulars brought in a blow up doll in with them.

1817859,2015-03-08,2,pcG0vJiTtDcTb0y3pKFUZQ,"You have to be kidding with this place.  This is a Bulgarian-run operation with a bunch of people who have absolutely no clue of how to run a pleasing and appealing restaurant in this city or this hemisphere for that matter!

When we walked in there were few people there so we asked for one table in particular but we were told if just became RESERVED so instead we had to sit in a both where one side was about 6 inches higher than the other and the other side had no seat backs, rather a bench type seat.  Interestingly enough, the ""RESERVED"" table that we asked for was still unoccupied upon our departure.

Inexplicably, the rave reviews on Yelp were what convinced us to try to this place.  Many reviews praised the Chicken Kiev, which was quite unfortunate because we were told that they were OUT OF 'CHICKEN FRIGGING KIEV!  

The waiter, nice enough really was in over his head.  There were two different types of potatoes (plus rice) available with the entrees and he TRIED to explain to us that they were both the same dish now because at one time there WERE two different types of potatoes but they eliminated one of the two options but NEVER changed the menus to reflect that.  You can have potatoes or potatoes! Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!

He told us the Greek Salad ($9.95) was more than big enough for four people.  Wrong!   It was barely enough for two people.  He brought it out with a serving spoon on other utensil to distribute its small portions.  I guess they use their hands in Bulgaria.

The music in there was quite loud and we asked if  they could turn it down a bit.  The waiter said probably not because they were going to have a party soon and that was the desired volume.  Only later when we escalated the issue to the owner did they turn it down a little bit.

I ordered Chicken Kabob, with the now unitary potato choice.  My wife too.  The ""kabob"" on a skewer concept was sadly eviscerated here, replaced instead with an open slab of chicken with lots of chunks of heavy duty, 30-weight potatoes to fill out the plate.   Carb city!  I asked the owner what happened to the skewer and the expected veggies on it?  He said this is a ""different kind"" of Kabob.  Get over it!

My friend asked for some gravy or something equivalent to put on his pork dish.  He was expecting something warm but instead was given a bowl of what looked like ketchup and nice and cold to boot.  That is Bulgarian gravy!  

I must say that the food tasted OK, but there was nothing great or memorable about it..  It was like something your neighbor made and invited you over for..  Eh?  OK, and that's about it.

The Russian beer they served was quite good.  Total tab for this food-fest - a paltry $115.60!

I really don't understand all the great review here - I REALLY don't!   ...and really it is not to be considered a ""Mediterranean"" restaurant, in spite of the Greek Salad.

Only the good beer saved this place from one star.  Uh, no, one star it is!

Anyways they do sell drinks here and I haven't tried their food, the place is kinda small kinda hard to dance in oh but they do sell hookah ! So if you like hookah by all means entry is free but the talent sucked sorry guys",EYwvNonD5kUGGNRTGjAAHA,1,0,1,Edv4zv8zlFbfAeuQ7rquKQ

We turned around and left, as we were leaving saw this person (a man) look out the door as we must have woke him.
The place was very dingy and dark and very un-inviting.  I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that all the 5 stars are trumped up.  I wouldn't go back if it was free.

When we showed up the inside was absolutely empty with loud music and reeked of hookah smoke so we asked to sit outside. We were seated next to a group of Russian speaking people that as a typical eastern europeans are, were very loud and obnoxious. But thats fine, I am from Ukraine it I'm used to that type of behavior. But this was just bottom like offensive. These guys were on the porch, in front of us, behind us and literally stood right above our heads. They were talking and yelling so loud that i couldn't hear what my girlfriend was saying. All were chain smoking in our face. Some of them were drunk. And the curs words they were using i haven't heard in the past 11 years since i left Ukraine. Anyways that was only the beginning. Because of all this happening around us and now they were trying to engage in a conversation with us we decided to eat and get out as soon as possible. 
I asked our server for two waters. She came back with water and lemonade. I asked her to switch the lemonade for water. She came back with another lemonade. I asked the second time to switch it for water. Guess what?! She cam back with LEMONADE the third time. At that point i thought maybe she doesn't speak english so i said in Russian ""Do you guys not have water, why you keep bringing back lemonade""?! To which she answered ""NO we don't"" then laughed and ran away. At that point i was sitting with my eyes wide open thinking WTF did just happened. 
Trying to get out of there i just order one of the most expensive things on the menu which is shrimp just to get our Groupon money worth it and my girlfriend got chicken with potatoes. They bring out 7 shrimp. I repeat 7 medium size shrimp in cold sauce for $20! no rice. no salad. just shrimp. Thats it. Ive never paid that much for so little. 
This place really needs someone to watch over it and make sure things don't get out of hand like it did that nigh. I feel like it just needs someone in charge. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because my girlfriends chicken and potatoes was pretty good which we both ended up eating.",J5PGAMGpKuQVN0amz1ddFQ,5,2,2,yYQ4sLUv2xELAnj2FwEb0A

Our waitress was number one way to close to us leaning on our chairs and tables. When she wrote down our order she put her notepad on the table and wrote it that way. Have you ever been a server in your life? No one does that. No one. We asked for two waters she brought out one water and one lemonade. We thought she misheard us so we asked again. She brought the same cup with the same lemonade. Finally we thought maybe she doesn't understand English so we spoke in Russian and asked her for water NOT lemonade and the stupid girl brought lemonade again. So I asked her does she mr understand or what is going on? I said do
You not have water. Tap water? She said no in Russian and walked away. What a horrible start. Then we paid for a $20 shrimp platter with 7 pieces of shrimp and sauce that tasted like crap. Such a poor experience! How do you run out of water? How do you not understand English OR RUSSIAN when I ask for water? Here's a tip. Have water for a restaurant do not ever tell a guest you run out of water. Water is free unless it's bottled. Did your water dispenser break? If so have the professional to explain why your bringing out lemonade when we didn't ask for it. Do no lean on chairs and tables and be so close to me that I feel you breathing. That's disgusting, understand body space. Do no put your notepad on the table so I can see you writing. Servers NEVER do that.

When I heard about Dacha I was excited and went there to eat. The service was good, very clean inside and even the music was enjoyable.

The reason for the two star rating is because of what happened with the food. The food itself, Russian stew and Russian salad, was very enjoyable. I pretty much ate it all. However, about two hours later I started getting sick and by nighttime I was vomiting for hours. 

I'm used to eating this food from the family and I have a strong stomach (have not vomited in 12 years until now).

Pork Steak, very good, but not a very good value. Stroke'in'off, very good, but I am no expert, (on the dish anyway). Service, excellent. Putin really beat them into shape. Decor, 80's/90's, this is where it is stuck and this is where it should be, excellent. 

A couple of gripes. Rice..on my most recent order they had transitioned from some of the most outstanding wet long-grained rice with butter and green onions to a super dry jasmine with just green onions. Please switch back! It was seriously the best rice I had ever eaten. Delivery, although they know it is a cash pay, guy shows up with three $20 bills as all of the change he carried.

It's also tucked away in a really ghetto shopping center where the Parking lot is filled with the local mini mart's sketchy shoppers. I honestly didn't feel safe and I've been to all kinds of places in not to so good parts of town. 

So, the food... It was descent. Wouldn't say it was exceptional. Honestly the service and atmosphere ruined the meal. The dumplings were bland and oily. The chicken schnitzel was okay and the potatoes were okay as well. 

Honestly, I won't be going back though I don't live far from here.",BpJWttiu9h5cgxtVkQZGXw,1,1,2,tzooWCBWnNQXHSpVcKg3zQ

Delivery takes less than an hour and all items arrive warm and ready to eat. 

Pricing is very reasonable given the excellent quality of the food. 

So far we've tried the Stroganoff, Schnitzel, Hummus with Ground Beef, Chicken Salad and Vareniki. Every single dish was AMAZING, perfectly prepared and full flavored, this is the best food I've had in Las Vegas so far. 

Can't say enough nice things about Green Dacha Grill and will definitely be a regular customer for a long time to come !",mLHTZOplA7-a2HJty0envA,1,0,5,uHIjYa8jWoQUCxwyy0ysOQ

The Green Dacha passed with flying colors!  The borscht was right up there with my mother in laws recipe!  I said right up there Olga, put down the bat! Pelmeni was great, potato salad was very tasty and beef stroganoff will make you lick the plate when no one is looking!  My favorite dish was the khachapuri...it could be its own food group!  Can't wait to go back and try the blini, drink more Baltikas and try the home made Napoleon!  Alex was our waiter and he was awesome!  If you're already a Russian gastronome or just want try this hearty fare The Green Dacha is definitely the place to go in Vegas!",FPbo46Fc3pKrSMlIn_hv7Q,1,1,5,CPR5rqmcPxZceIZiRAEoMw
5634476,2015-05-10,0,pcG0vJiTtDcTb0y3pKFUZQ,"I came with husband and toddler to try out restaurant. The first thing we noticed on the door was two signs, ""No one under 18,"" and ""No weapons allowed."" I got concerned whether or not this was a restaurant and hookah bar, or just a hookah bar that would not allow the toddler in with us. Luckily, the waiter told us it was alright to come in with the child. While getting sat down, the waiter told us the restaurant did not have any booster or high chairs. We knew would have to hold the child while eating which would be uncomfortable, but were hungry and decided to stay. There was another table being served besides us.

I was seeking Mediteranian food and found this restaurant on yelp. The menu was a book with pictures that don't show the description that well. I ordered the steak skewer plate which came with potatoes, even thought the steak skewer in the picture on the menu looked burned. It was around an additional $2 to add salad to the steak skewer and potatoes. I didn't get the salad because usually other places include the salad with the dish. The plate was around $13. 

There was a Mexican section in the menu. The pictures of the Mexican food did not look Mexican. There was also a Russian and American section. 

The steak and potatoes tasted good. The cons were that I did not get full because the portions were not proportioned adequate. The plate presentation was plain.

The waiter was friendly, but I felt unwelcome in the environment due to other environmental factors, as well the restaurant not feeling family friendly.

The environment did not match. It's a open seating area that looks like a big cabin that has an industrial looking ceiling with a small chandelier in the center, with decoration that is from Spain and Middle East, with traditional and Tuscan furniture mixed up. 

I noticed that restaurant had a list of alcoholic drinks served on each table, probably for the hookah population. On the list, there was a drink called wet p****. It was definitely not kid friendly. Luckily our toddler cannot read or ask questions.

From reading the previous reviews written, I agree with the previous review written on March 8, 2015. If this place is going to be a hookah bar and restaurant, it needs some work. I question if the other reviews are authentic because they sound like they are promoting the place and all gave this place five stars, which misled me.",1NbFusAiFMOLT1vOUyVr8Q,0,0,2,prERKZrgD7l89IQVw3K36g

The happy hour specials are also at convenient times for dinner, bringing the cost of booze down to better levels. Try the Baltika 6, it's a darn good beer!
