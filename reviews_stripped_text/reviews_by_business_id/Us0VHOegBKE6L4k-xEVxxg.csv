When we ordered they messed up the order, they brought us a dog instead of the fries we ordered. Then we ordered 2 dogs and only rang in one. The Euro fries were too salty the Hawaiian dog was good though. Our experience here was bleh hopefully next time we'll have a better visit.",Lg7rYNdwfHOPY2wOdbWKIQ,0,0,3,Ap0kU4IyCc2CxlDL_Aiidw

We're used to getting good food truck dinners but both were fantastic.  I couldn't finish my fries so toasted them in the oven for breakfast.  Still great the next day.,SYuOpfwKGnwxlcUebpSnnw,1,0,5,CawA4vKBimLwBI8uyURwtA

Saltier than the salted fries! Not sweet the way Korean Bulgogi is supposed to be! Unreal! Unacceptable. Will never eat their food , truck or restaurants!",y4ANw37GqdBEFv1Qe09EAQ,0,1,1,T5BTHnjLgV4TreRl_xQ69g

1521440,2017-03-21,1,Us0VHOegBKE6L4k-xEVxxg,"Sooooo good! This truck came to my work one day during lunch and I couldn't pass it up! Food trucks are always a hit or miss because of how expensive they can get. This was definitely a hit for me!

I ordered the Euro Special fries and they were so delicious! I'm not a big fan of bacon (I know I'm weird!!!) but oh my, the bacon made these fries taste extra delicious! That was all I ordered and it definitely filled me up as my lunch meal! 

I really hope they come back to my work again so I can try more of their stuff! I've been to the original location before but a food truck is always more convenient when it's right at your work!",KLUvRyRDUftXgFvUx50Kyg,1,0,4,NFoPlJOXE-Az2X6zsm4zQg
1661905,2014-09-28,0,Us0VHOegBKE6L4k-xEVxxg,"Walked out of my favorite bar during First Friday and this truck was just a few steps forward.  I immediately expected a Korean-Mexican fusion given the name ""Buldogis"" sounding close enough to bulgogi and we were post drinking hangry.  This is so much more! Gourmet hot dogs and an eclectic menu pulling from Korea, Mexico, Thai, and balanced with some American comfort.  My friend and I shared the carne asada fries with bulgogi, it had sliced jalapenos and this amazing sauce.  The spice did not disappoint and the food brought up some culinary nostalgia I wasn't expecting.",hDzgJUST9jdBrtnUK5085w,2,1,4,tE4qAuPiMV_wQhfPQgXtBA
1697032,2017-06-22,0,Us0VHOegBKE6L4k-xEVxxg,"I had brought the food truck out for an office lunch of about 60 people.  Boyzie (owner) was very helpful via email and easy to work with.  I had a previous not so great experience with another food truck, so I was hesitant to try it with a strict one hour lunch period again.  

Boyzie ensured me they would be able to get all the employees fed within the hour and recommended cutting down some options in the menu to save time. I took pre orders from staff and sent it to Boyzie the week of the event.

The truck got here super early (around 10:45am) even though lunch wasn't until 12.  They were able to get set up and my first group of 20 got their food right on the dot at 12pm (what I requested for).  The rest of my staff had all their food before 12:40pm, with record timing.  

The hot dogs were super delicious and the fries were AMAZING!  The guys that came out were fast and super friendly being that it was about 107 degrees outside.  

Thank you again for making this so seamless for us.  We hope to use them again soon.",4pKD9hx5AU9-dG6JrOsXbw,1,1,5,r-nljIc3yXDf3F7mtKa2Ig

I have waited and waited and waited to try this and finally the day came. The line moved at a steady pace which of course is key at a food truck. I tried the Euro special fries and Hawaiian hotdog. I highly doubt I could have made a poor choice, but I like to think that I definitely made the right decision.

Both were exploding with flavors that were over the top. The pineapple salsa on the Hawaiian was sweet, but not so much to the point that it took anything away from the pork butt. The pork butt on both was well...as good as any pigs @$$. Phenomenal choice of ingredients, friendly staff, and a well put together gourmet meal from a food truck...easiest 5 stars I've given in a wow.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,1,1,5,P0YPKEbuoEU7lT9glGB9iA

However, I was pretty disappointed by their Bahn Mi. The description made it seem like a fun mix of a bunch of different, but harmonious, flavors: spicy, salty, sweet, savory...but that all fell flat. It was messier than it was tasty, in my opinion... Luckily, the Euro special fries made up for it! Yeah, I'd eat here again, but if that happens, I'll probably just stick to their fries...",ImnJ5KKaWWNjj1E9kEArmQ,0,1,3,2okdadCQKO_ZS_aAcnmoYw

The place was busy we ordered a chili cheese dig and Hawaii dog. They were super delicious. The French fries nice and crisp. The food is fresh and prepared wonderfully.

That said, I'm no expert when it comes to gourmet hot dogs, but Buldogis served up a very VERY good one.

Anytime we go where there is food trucks I look for Buldogis, if Buldogis isn't there then I usually just won't get anything. The euro fries are fire! My favorite is the Hawaiian dog, Everyone working for Buldogis has always been great in the food trucks and in the restaurant. My favorite hot dogs forever!",7VsihmrVZJzUSL_VqjEfzA,0,1,5,2diPwBhWVNflr-8c4hHM2Q
4427287,2016-10-07,1,Us0VHOegBKE6L4k-xEVxxg,The price goes up if you would like a veggie dog inside one of their regular hotdogs. They just make it up on the spot too. Be prepared for the worst experience and something that isn't even as good as hotdog in a stick. What a waste of money and it took ten minutes.,E6k_L6ngqiaI1l5R2bs8Fg,0,0,1,YQxve9xfnC51yov9Pq0CNg
5139406,2014-01-10,1,Us0VHOegBKE6L4k-xEVxxg,"The same ol√© Buldogis we all know and love!

We ordered some of our favorites, such as the Banh Mi Dog and the Euro Special Fries.  The toppings and taste are what you'd expect...excellent!

The only difference is the price...Most everything is a solid $7, which is a little less than a buck more than the brick and mortar shop (factoring in sales tax).  Well worth it considering the convenience of the truck.

If you see this truck nearby, it's worth the stop!  Some of the best food truck goodies you'll find :)",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,7,5,5,YPByg0tVVz71W2BoZ6CnlA

My expectations for this place was high and they did not fail to meet my expectations. I got the banh mi dog with an order of euro fries and all i can say is WOW! The pork belly bacon really complimented both the hot dog and the euro fries. The sauce was so flavorful and had a nice kick to it. The slaw had a really good taste to it. The sausage was juicy. All i can say is buldogis makes some freakin' tasty hot dogs and i would definitely recommend them to all my friends.",21conwnVxvgYTdbLLFGfzA,0,0,5,ep0VIHSKdD_zp3I2jkO7bg
