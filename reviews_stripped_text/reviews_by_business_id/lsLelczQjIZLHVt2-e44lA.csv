It was fresh, the dressing was better than expected and for a miserable dieting person like myself, it was nice to have a healthy portion of a healthy meal.

I must say this place brought me back to my 40th birthday when we went to Hawaii. The moco loco was awesome. The burger was well cooked to medium well. The gravy was very tasty.

From the simple lightweight plastic chairs and cheap tables, to the under-designed back bar, to the cheap vinyl flooring, you can quickly observe where they tried to cut costs. And as for that back bar, walking through every space in this property you will notice that this architect must not give much thought to bars as a whole as they are seriously lacking presence. Their breakfast, lunch and dinner menus all have some similar items, but vary slightly based on the expected meals for their time of day. While some of their offerings sound great, based on both my experience and a majority of the reviews online you shouldn't expect much.

Of the few burgers offered on their lunch menu, I went with the Ogden Burger: fried beefsteak tomato, avocado aioli and frisee. What came out looked like a bit of a disaster, and I'm surprised the chef allowed a bun like that to leave his kitchen; it had gaping holes, was completely dry and overly flaky. The generic pre-made and possibly frozen patty had no decent flavor, ok char, and was cooked close to the medium rare I ordered. The fried tomato was totally dry and not great at all, and there was a random unlisted piece of bacon that showed up just in the middle of my burger. The avocado aioli was nowhere to be seen on this burger, and could have helped counter some of the dryness to the bun and tomato.

My fries were completely generic and not great at all; cooked well but had no decent flavor or originality to speak of. We also ordered the meatball skewers as an appetizer; the meat was far too dense, under-seasoned and not great. The roasted tomato and provolone fondue sauce wasn't good, and the garlic bread wasn't quite bread and not nearly garlicky enough. This meal just failed in every aspect. Like I said, I'm a big supporter of all things downtown, but when they're of such poor quality for the cost, I can't stand behind it. $10 for those meatball skewers is insane, and charging $15 for this burger should be illegal. If you're drunk at 3am on Fremont Street, this might be a cool atmosphere, but even heavily intoxicated I couldn't see myself willingly spending that kind of money in this restaurant again.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,1,1,EhG_zjlKzuL5-Da6ZB88Fw

258896,2014-03-10,1,lsLelczQjIZLHVt2-e44lA,"My friends & I stumbled upon Stewart + Ogden after the Color Run a couple of weeks ago. We had to get our parking validated at the Downtown Grand & didn't want to wait at other places nearby (Pizza Rock had a 45 minute wait, boo) because we were starving!! Besides, it looked like it had good potential: cute-ish decor (blue/turquoise booths & chairs with silver chandeliers), there was no wait, & as a diner/bistro there is something for everyone. 

I built my own omelet which includes 3 eggs and 2 items of your choice, along with house potatoes. Any additional items are $0.80 each. I decided on spinach, mushrooms, sausage & swiss cheese. It was smaller than expected, but okay - I mean, you can't really mess up an omelet, right? 

Now - about everyone else's food: 

- Ogden burger (tomato, bacon, aioli, onions) with a side of fries: the waitress put the plate down & then asked if there was bacon on the burger. There was not, so she said she would come back with it. .. um, okay? 

- French Dip sandwich with a side of fries: my friend totally did not eat the bottom parts of her sandwich because the au jus was spilled all over her plate & made them super soggy. It looked like her sandwich was swimming in it. 

- Saimin: this is a noodle dish with char siu pork, spam & egg that my friend liked. The huge bowl this noodle soup was in came on top of a plate - which had a layer of soup on it. 

I was so confused!! Obviously, they acknowledged all of the things that were wrong: missing bacon, au jus spilled on the plate, & to be careful with the bowl & plate of saimin but still sent these dishes out. It was pretty sloppy service. 

Lastly.. PAYMENT. What a headache!! Usually with groups, the group or the server will ask for separate checks. We missed the waitress asking us that in the beginning, but thought that letting her know what amounts to put on each card would be okay, but it seemed like she got upset & reiterated that she asked us if we wanted separate checks in the beginning. She then said she would have to separate the checks to take payment and it would take a few minutes. It took over 30 minutes. Yes, we felt bad that she had to separate the checks but we all tipped her because of that. 

With all the other places you can eat in DTLV now, I kind of wished we sucked it up & waited to eat somewhere else.",8kblFESkorfP00ryDTBuRQ,5,3,1,p07eoDfaevSJAkC0Q7GPRw

For example, I stood NY the front station and started wondering if they were a 'seat yourself' place or were they even open? I knew what I wanted because I had lots of time to see the menu. The grave steak & eggs are now $7 rather than the $5 I saw earlier this week. The steak was okay as far as thickness and degree of cooked. But it was small overall and too much black pepper for my tastes. Not worth $7. For that, I will go to Tuscanny and Marilyn's. Now, the biggie. I ordered a side house salad. The dressing came out. Then the waiting game started. My steak, eggs and potatoes came out. At this point I HAD to ask. The 'relief' waitress snapped that she had it.

679253,2014-11-16,0,lsLelczQjIZLHVt2-e44lA,"I wanted to like this place. i've been here before and I loved it. It's a complete train wreck and they're going down in flames, fast.

We asked for a table of three and was told it would be about a 15 minute wait. i was perplexed as to why there was even await since there were plenty of tables sitting empty on the inside. I should have taken this as a sign and left.  Two of my friends got drinks at the bar and walked around the Grand before I received a text saying that our table was ""almost ready."" 

We were finally seated and it took an extra 5-7 minutes for someone to come and take a drink order. Long enough that we were ready to order our food. After that, we were lucky to see our server, or any server actually. 

After waiting a really long time for our food, our drinks and beers needed to be refilled. The only time I'd seen our server (most of them, now that I think about it) was standing in a corner having a conversation with other servers. I had to flag down another server to get our drinks refilled, who couldn't even do that. Her response was, ""I'll get your waiter."" That couldn't convince him to pay a visit to our table.

Our food finally came. I ordered the calamari and the spinach artichoke dip, my friend ordered a pasta dish and tater tots. My calamari was frigid cold, and my spinach artichoke dip was so hot it burned my mouth. I was perplexed as to how two dishes that came out at the same time could be so different in temperature. I ended up sending the calamari back. 

There was a knight in shining armour in this place though. The one guy who delivered the food to our table (who wasn't our server, surprise surprise) actually asked if he could get us anything. We asked for refills and not even 30 seconds later, he's back with the drinks we wanted. I'm being generous with two stars just because of this guy.

Foodies should flock to this place for innovative offerings which give you a chance to have a superb culinary experience combined with prime people-watching as the casino scene plays out in front of you.

We went with the buffalo wings for the appetizer and they were right on the mark.  Not a ton of heat, but clearly the emphasis was making the sauce rich and flavorful.  The chicken was moist and tender.  I read they are doing $9.99 all you can eat wings on Wednesdays, and I will totally be back for that.  

My girlfriend and I shared two entrees:  the short ribs and the steak frites.  Both awesome.  

The short ribs were fall-apart tender, with a really nice crispy sear that added texture and taste.  The meat was like eating my mom's pot roast as a kid (that is very high praise) but sauced with a savory gourmet touch.   Well-served with mashed potatoes on the side to mix with.   

Also loved the steak frites.   Wonderfully grilled steak, correct temperature, and not over-seasoned.   The bernaise is a must and takes the dish to a whole new level.  The fries are crispy and tasty with just enough parmesan cheese baked on.  

The cherry tart was awesome for dessert, and the menu had loads of appealing choices.  I'm getting the butterscotch pudding next time.

Service was solid too.  Really attentive and friendly, but didn't bug us or hover.

Seriously, don't sleep on this place.  At most downtown casinos, if you're looking around for food, say hello to a Subway or a McDonald's.  Do yourself a favor.  Cash in some of those chips and treat yourself to something special.",2Q9yOPeaS2EsLFne4ECrlQ,0,0,5,lqnyMsouDVYzYMD7L02YSA

One of my friends did order the red velvet pancakes & said they were very good. The spinach frittata was a hit with two of the ladies- especially the ricotta? That looked like a scoop of butter. The breakfast potatoes were very good but I was amazed at fresh squeezed juice for $3 with free refills! I will admit I wasn't fond of the really green cucumber juice (a bit bitter, maybe too much peel for that green color since flesh is so lightly colored? Bummer that my friend ordered the last watermelon juice they had available. The grapefruit & orange were very good though. Server said they also have carrot & lime which I didn't see listed on menu. We were seated on time, though not early even though I had called days earlier for a reservation. That was not an enjoyable call- they don't have a direct line and the person who answered the phone could not hear me because of all the noise on their end & kept making me repeat myself as she was trying to make a breakfast reservation at 10pm, luckily after 5 minutes she handed the phone to someone else who resolved everything quickly & easily. Our server was funny & attentive and had no problem giving us separate checks even though we forgot to ask that in the beginning. 
We were lucky enough to be in a separate area from the main dining under our very own beautiful chandelier which I would have loved to take home with me. I'd have given them 10stars if I could have that chandelier & forgiven the exasperation from the initial person trying to take the reservation. I will go back in the summer so I can get some of that watermelon juice - can't beat that price, except to make it myself.",vMYKQeuuC9py7VkRCdAquQ,0,0,4,iKJS8UcE1zX4QAZFeLCckA

We were seated, drink orders taken (water) and drinks delivered. That's where the good ends. Our waiter comes to our table so we can order, I ask how big the nachos are, he proceeds to tell me the size, but then he says he wouldn't get them if he were me because they're not good. Ok? So we asked for a minute to look over the menu again. A couple minutes go by and the waiter and 2 other servers start arguing over who has what table and why right next to our table. When we were done looking at the menu again we stacked the menus up at the edge of the table. The host noticed it and picked up the menus , the waiter did not, even though he walked past our table at least 10 times. We then hard him say to another waiter that we needed to hurry up because he was about to be off. Another 5 minutes go by and he still hasn't looked at us or been back to see if we were ready to order. So, we got up to leave, as soon as he sees us get up he says ""you're leaving"" I answer yes and he says ok, that's it, no attempt to see why or see if there was a problem.

As I looked over the menu, I decided to try the seared salmon which came with a scoop of rice along with broccolini and a tiny carrot. The salmon was cooked well. It tasted great because there was pepper and salt on top of the salmon. The rice was perfect. The broccolini had butter melted on top. Delicious meal. It was the perfect amount of food.

The first day I had a standard eggs and bacon and toast breakfast and it was all fine.  The bacon was particularly good, but the toast was cold and you have to put your own butter on and you know how butter on cold toast works out.  Bummer.  The second day I got the lemon ricotta waffles and oddly, it was also cool, temperature wise.   Not sure what's up with not serving the food hot... could be a server issue or the kitchen, but it was disappointing.  Both had good flavor, the waffles came covered in blueberries and other berries, kind of half fresh and half sort of a compote.  A little odd, but not bad.

Considering it was 2am the server Chanel had a great attitude and was knowledgable when asked questions. You have to be sweet but tough to work this shift in Vegas on a Saturday night.

I have stayed at this hotel many times since it's open last fall and never felt drawn to eating at what was called Stewart and Ogden ( now going by S+O). While I loved the decorations, it felt as if the menu was trying really hard to upscale when this hotel sorely needed a solid coffee shop...even the Bellagio has one.

I was pleased to see a lot of smart changes being made at this hotel to bring in more people-- some at S+O were apparent through hotel advertising. They offer a prime rib special late night breakfast for $4.95 and such to bring in people.. Everyone loves a good deal in downtown. 50% off regular menu for locals ( not the discounted late night menu though) 

So to the good. I ordered some hot water and lemon- not so much cheap and protecting my throat. The late night menu is small but I liked that they had 2.95/3.95/4.95 and 8.95 options. 

Meatball sliders with fries: 3.95  solid little dish that is tasty and flavorful. My only comment and my server agreed was that they need more marinara sauce. I know the chefs job is to keep kitchen costs down but you don't want a dish to be cheap and feel cheap... That said 3.95 gets you just the order of fries in some coffee shops.

Taquitos: 2.95 they looked a little sad upon arrival but once you got past the lame lettuce garnish they tasted good... Especially since I ate my sliders first so they were sitting for a bit. I sorta ordered them as an after thought just to see how the food was at 2.95. My recommend is that the chef serves it with the pico de gallo and maybe a small salsa of some sort...

Creme brûlée: 4.99 Chanel offered and I was curious from the little sign that said desserts $3 and up.It was fresh and the berries added a lot to it.  I heard it is a fave with many guests. Solid portion for sure.

Wrap up: as I carouse around vegas I am much more likely to end my evening at S+O now that they offer late night. All the tables around me seemed happy. Remember that late night always takes a little longer but the quality of food was way better than that late night stop at jack in the box.

The manager came by our table to say hi, which made us feel welcomed. Overall, we were satisfied, but I don't think I am going to be a frequent loyal visitor.  Things I would suggest improving if I was management: include drink menus on all tables (I wanted to order a drink, but didn't know what the specialties were so I ended up ordering a diet coke), make the portions larger (mac n cheese was more od a side dish), more additional signature items on the menu, and include some breakfast dishes (I'd love to come here for a latenight omelet).

The chicken breading was savory the chicken soft and juicy. The waffles were fluffy inside with a nice crunch on the outside. The potato hash echoed the same as the waffles.

I enjoyed it so much, I brought a coworker of mine to dine with me since I had talked up my previous experience (March 2015),

I ordered the same dish & felt a little disappointed. The chicken had plain breading - no flavor to it & the chicken was a little bit dry.

I'm the kind of person that is willing to give this experience another chance. Perhaps it was a new chef? Or someone's ""off day"" in the kitchen.

Side note: my coworker on this trip didn't enjoy her biscuits and gravy, she had 2 bites then stopped eating. She didn't like the gravy, she said it tasted funny. I tasted my gravy and agreed.

I went back again last week with 2 coworkers this time, in hopes that S+O will redeem themselves from my last experience. 

Sigh...

It was even worse...

The chicken were pounded thinly, yes it did have the savory crust but because the chicken was so thin, it wasn't juicy on the inside, the two pieces of chicken were more like crackers, very crunchy and hard to cut into. 

I was so disappointed but our waitress was so kind she even agreed and let me know they changed from the nicer thicker chicken pieces to these smaller cuts.

My 2 coworkers felt their meal was ok but nothing to talk about.

I will look elsewhere for my chicken and waffle cravings from now on.

Will I return here again? Probably not for myself personally, but I know my company does business with the Grand that I will be on the premise for events and functions but the food will be something I won't take part in.

I hope they find consistency and fix this situation soon. This is a young restaurant there's still hope for them and though I won't eat here again I wish them success.

...now I heard from my coworkers that Hash House A Go Go has chicken and waffles! Keep watch for that review!

Now, it's just slightly bette than your typical Downtown casino bistro/diner/all-purpose restaurant.

Walking in from the casino floor I was a little surprised by how small the place is. The marketing photos make the place look so much bigger. 

Hoping that Chef Harrington brought a similar fried chicken recipe to the one from Central, I ordered S+O's platter ($14.99). What arrived soon after was 4 pieces of bland chicken with a thin, somewhat course, breading that lacked any visual cues of seasoning. The meat under the breading was quite juicy, so they get points for that. The steak cut fries and coleslaw weren't bad either. 

It will be interesting to see how their menu evolves with the kitchen changes and the consolidation of their now closed Asian restaurant into S+O.

Talked to the manager -- the same manager as before -- and he again offered to comp it but I said no and left.  Oh, and I'll note their menus still haven't been fixed -- they still only list half of the ingredients in some dishes.

The base is not an English muffin but two slices of green tomatoes, breaded and fried, topped with lump crab meat, and topped by two poached eggs and a remoulade sauce that had a nice zing.

The tater tots were good, a huge portion big enough for two people.  The bread pudding was good but it is over rated from the other reviews on yelp.  The custard part of the pudding soaked to the bottom part of the bread, making it a bit soggy and the top of the bread pudding a little hard.  The bread pudding wasn't bad but it could have been so much better if the consistency wasn't so varied.  The ice cream was actually pretty good, vanilla bean, good flavor.

Enter myself and two co-workers. We work close to Downtown and we stopped in at Stewart & Ogden for lunch. We were on the clock so we hoped service would be quick and there wouldn't be too many people. Luckily we came at a good time because there weren't many people there.

Ordered:
Ahi Tuna Sliders with Tater Tots: Grandly awful. The bread, although looking pretty was dry as a bone and tasteless. It was like cardboard. The teeny pieces of ahi tuna were so freaking salty I could barely stomach them. The slaw inside was unmemorable. The tots, while brought out warm and crispy were also REALLY SALTY. Just an overall failure of what could be a really great dish. They should take a moment and go have the Ahi Tuna Sandwich at Yard House to understand what these sliders should really taste like.

Tomato Bisque (by both my co-workers): They said it was good, and the presentation was really cute with little goldfish crackers.

Side of Fries: Salty. TOO SALTY.

Caeser Salad with added on Chicken: The salad looked blah. My co-worker had to ask for extra dressing, because although it was mixed in, there wasn't much. The chicken was dry and she said the Romano cheese had melted under the heat of the chicken. They didn't even bother to give the chicken time to cool a bit before throwing it on her salad.

Decor is odd. The yellow IKEA like chairs really throw me. They should be replaced to go with the rest of the restaurant which is like, ""chic diner"".

The problem is in the kitchen though. Honestly I would have sent my food back had I not been limited with time and on the clock for work. The food is simply not good.

4590847,2014-09-17,0,lsLelczQjIZLHVt2-e44lA,"This place just cannot get it together.

I have tried every one of the many reinventions this place has undergone in their very short existence and every time it is just a mess. From that time the sloppy, unprofessional, and consistently confused waitress dropped an entire tray of drinks on our table, to the time the greasy pervy dude waiter spent the whole length of our visit creepily hitting on one of my co-workers, this place continued to disappoint.   My latest adventure with them was no less frustrating and I guess I only have myself to blame. 

Lately I had been hearing some good things about the newest menu, specifically the new Chinese food section, and I made the foolish decision to give S+O another try. That was my first mistake   A few friends and I walked over on our lunch break to get some carry-out to take back to a meeting. We browsed the new menu (it's looked promising!), placed our order at the bar, and waited a reasonable 15 minutes. 

We hadn't ordered anything special or complicated (no ""extra this"", ""none of that"", etc.) and as such just did a quick count of the boxes to make sure that we had the correct number of items.  That was my second mistake. I should have known based on past experience that this place was a mess; I should have checked inside the boxes.

We walked back to work and proceeded to unpack the order only to find that one of the large Styrofoam boxes inside did not contain the dumplings it should have. What was inside you ask? Was it something that could be conceived as an honest mistake? Steamed buns instead of dumplings perhaps? 

Nope. 

2 pieces of toast...

I am not sure which of the non-breakfast items we ordered they thought the toast would complement, but whatever the thought process, they were wrong. Now at this point I was annoyed, but I hadn't yet lapsed into full black-out rage yet... That came later.

After splitting one of the other orders amongst ourselves (the food was pretty okay actually) I tried to call the restaurant to see if we could just have the price of the dumplings refunded to the credit card. After 3 attempts to get through (for some reason the operator at the Grand really thinks ""Stewart and Ogden"" sounds like ""reception desk"") we finally got through to the restaurant only to listen to the spacey hostess repeat a confused ""Hello?"" into the phone about 6 times before she hung up on me.

A few more misses from the hotel operator later and I was able to get through again. I told the hostess that I had called a few minutes prior and was hung up on, she giggled and said ""Yeah, our phones are old""...Not the ""sorry ma'am"" I was hoping for but c'est la vie.  I explained what had happened (DumplingGate) and asked that the card be refunded.  She informed me that she was unable to help me, but took my number and informed me that a manager would be calling me back.  Now at this point, if you are guessing that the manager promptly called ma back, apologized and fixed my issue, then you have not been paying attention. Why would you think that, don't you know a pattern when you see one?!

Yeesh. 

No, what actually happened next was nothing...Infuriating, unsatisfying Nothing. No call ever came, no solutions were offered. I all I received was this quietly simmering rage. 

On the plus side, I think I finally learned my lesson about this place.

So to summarize, if you love an unpleasant experience coupled with some pretty okay food, then you are in for a treat. If not, I suggest that you lunch elsewhere.",aNhISO-gYnRgl80o5YmoXg,0,0,2,u2MOruDTZz7eJsdEm34LHQ

We came here for dinner, & due to a major hangover I ordered the Roasted Chicken (less grease, less chance of worsening this hangover). Our food came rather quickly considering there was only ONE waiter for the entire restaurant.. But! They fell short on food quality. My chicken was not cooked thoroughly, and was still veryy pink/red on the inside. And there was even some blood on my mashed potatoes from the uncooked chicken. If I thought that was bad; My broccoli florets still had the rubber and around it, and I almost ate it! This also signified to me that they did not clean my broccoli well, and this was bad for business. On a much lighter note, I did let our waiter know, & they did take it off the bill, as well as sent over someone to apologize to us for the chicken dish. Phew! I was just glad to get that off the bill, because there was no way I was going to pay for that few bites of chicken that I had and NOT complain. Kudos to them for making it that much easier on them and myself. 

My mother ordered their salmon dish, & the salmon was still kind of raw. How raw? It left the rice extremely moist! It was edible, but not very good. My Dad and sister barely ate their food, & just took it in boxes to go.

The second time that I came here it was for breakfast. It was just me and my Mom. I ordered the cinnamon bun waffles, and my mother ordered the apple raisin oatmeal. Our entire wait time was almost 45 minutes! This included 15 minutes for her to take our order after being seated, 25 minutes to get our food out, and 5 minutes to eat it.

On the menu the Cinnamon bun waffles are supposed to be ""one of the best"", and it was farrrrr from that! For one thing it was BURNT, and very hard to eat. Secondly, the frosting was stuck to my plate like glue, and was very unappetizing. Third, the dough tasted a lot like the Pillsbury crescent roll packaged dough..

Working downtown gives us the luxury to choose from an array of restaurants and eateries. Working downtown for a while means I've had the opportunity to visit a lot of places, however, I've never been to Stewart & Ogden. My friend said this place was awesome and we should try it. Aside from the OK reviews on Yelp, I wanted to check this place out for myself.

When I approached this joint, the first thing I thought of was luxury. At first glance, this place looked like a regal diner, with very prominent focal points around. One of the first things you'll notice is the checkered floors, the old century type chandeliers and aesthetically designed ceilings. Booths and table tops accented with sky blue gives the pop of color while also helping to build the luxury look. When it came to the service, it was more casual than the look. Our server's name was Tey. He was accommodating and did start a little bit of conversation with us. What I liked about him was that he did give us our space during our meal. Thumbs up for him.

For lunch I decided to get the Ogden Burger for $10. I wanted something filling and the name obviously attracted me as well. This burger is cooked to your temperature, topped with grilled tomatoes, bacon, shallot aioli and fried onions. The burger was definitely the star of the show. It was cooked at the medium rare temperature I requested and SUPER flavorful. It was perfect seasoned and really made the burger that much better. I also loved that they included thick cut bacon. The saltiness of the bacon also enhanced the flavor. To me though, the aioli and tomatoes got lost in the mix, didn't even notice the tomatoes until the end. Overall, it was a great burger and packed with deliciousness. For my side, I chose the tater tots and glad I did! Another great hit, super crispy, not too oily and one things for sure: the chefs know how to season their food!

I've been raving about my seasoned burger since I visited this place. That can only mean one thing: I'm definitely coming back again soon! They serve breakfast as well, so that a good excuse enough to return. I'm glad that I didn't follow the overall Yelp rating. I thought is was a little better than just OK.

Located in the Downtown Grand and named in homage to immigrants Archibald Stewart and Peter Ogden, the appropriately named ""Stewart + Ogden"" Café has been the source of decidedly mixed reactions since its 2013 opening but having recently retooled the concept and the menu under the direction of Michel Richard protégé Todd Harrington I finally decided to see the restaurant for myself, an old friend in town coming along for a five plate jaunt through the restaurant's sweet breakfast selections plus a pair of desserts.  Served by Scott as trendy tunes floated overhead amidst a deluge of chandeliers it was to great coffee and friendly service that we were greeted just after the restaurant's 7am opening and seated close to the bar the it was with a simple request that courses were paced out in decadent progression, none less than good and a few truly exemplary over the course of an hour with coffee never less than half-full.  Beginning with a single savory before for moving to sweets, homemade biscuits would prove fluffy yet well-buttered beneath thick spiced gravy and although perhaps an odd pairing with a slice of ""The Best"" carrot cake, I actually preferred the biscuits as the cake itself was excellent while the frosting was just a bit too sweet.  Moving next to a far better use of the carrot cake batter, cast-iron skilled pancakes with light cream cheese drizzle would prove light and every bit on par with those at MTO Café while the similarly topped Red Velvet stack would prove the best I've had to date with light cocoa tones filling the a fluffy batter bronzed by the griddle.  At this point already impressed but expecting great things from what would follow given Harrington's Crème Brulee French toast at Central it was with a trio that the meal wrapped up and with the waffles truly harkening a crunchy yeasted cinnamon roll it was the nearly molten bread-pudding and complex, custard style French toast impressed most - the later begging for a little umbrella given its island influence and crispy coconut topping juxtaposing creamy cookie butter and bursting berries.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,1,4,DYktXlf_G5QKFHI1waEdIQ
5323543,2014-08-27,0,lsLelczQjIZLHVt2-e44lA,"We were staying at the Downtown Grand, and if you have a players card you get $3 Cheeseburgers at this place (normally it's a good $10+ more). Not sure if the $3 deal was a long standing special or just for the month of August...but of course we had to try it. Especially when you're just tired of walking around and you just want to eat in your own hotel. 

The restaurant itself is cute, modern and clean. The regular prices are bit up there, but I see what they're trying to accomplish in this place. It's suppose to be a more upscale ""bistro"" type setting, but it really is kind of odd to me because its the Flagship (and ONLY) restaurant of the casino open at all hours. They really need a quick and cheaper options for food in the casino, IMO. They did add a $9.99 prime rib dinner which looked really good and huge. Which is smart to do because when in downtown LV, you cannot pretend to be a Bellagio and price your food that way, I don't care how new your casino is. You have to know who the clientele is. But on that note, the clientele at the Downtown grand were pretty much like me...we got money to spend but come on! Give me a $3 burger special! =) 

At any rate. Service was really good, it's a nice sit down experience. The restaurant was not terribly busy at 7pm on Weds night.  Our burgers were good (juicy, generous with all the fixings) and we ordered a side of tater tots and Cesar salad as well. All was good and tasty.  I really liked my Cesar. 

If you're staying at the hotel, this is a safe bet to try if you don't want to go anywhere else. Definitely get a players card so you can get the deals.  Would I come out of my way to just eat here? Not sure I would as it's Vegas, there's so many other ways and places to spend your money but if I'm in the area, sure. I'd give them another go.",ZmWLeLU_bGrNiqBVAGo-eg,1,0,4,B1QfDLGCZt1OE_R-nE_cWw
5385125,2014-08-18,0,lsLelczQjIZLHVt2-e44lA,"Ate here last week. I had heard good things so thought we would give it a try. Was less than impressed. We were sat at a both near the kitchen entrance and it felt like there was a constant parade of servers and bus boys going by. Very distracting. We ordered a ham and cheese omelette and chicken and waffles. The omelette had one small, thin slice of cheese melted on top. It was overcooked too. For $11.49  I would expect a more generous helping of cheese. Not one measly slice. The chicken on the chicken and waffles was good but the waffles were very dry. My second cup of coffee was poured from a carafe and when I tasted it, it was cold. I had to flag down the server and ask for a replacement. The diner is not busy, has nice decor but is pricy for what you get. For what I was charged I would expect more generous portions of higher quality made with better care. I can go to any coffee shop and get the mediocre fare I was served for less cost. 

All in all its a nice place with potential. Hope they can fix the problems they are having.",35vuYenuJP_4qsqyNPcu8Q,0,0,2,Kk77JkzcjYE9GQcxPwsbsw

I was intrigued when I first peeped the new signage while under construction from the open area of the Gold Spike.  I love how downtown LV is transforming right before my eyes.

Anyhow, a co worker of mine told me about a place called Stewart and Ogden, named after the other two roads running parallel from Fremont.  The menu provides some fun facts about Mr. Stewart and Mr. Ogden as well, referencing their polar opposite attitudes and peculiar relationship.  It was Xmas eve and the first time we didn't head back home for the holidays.  Almost all the good spots were closed.  We initially tried to hit up Container Park until we learned that they closed early for the holidays.
 
It was real quiet and wasn't quite what I expected, especially since my co worker is a foodie extraordinaire, which boggles me why she is not on Yelp.  I was expecting something more intimate and not just another casino diner.

Well beggars can't be choosers.  I ordered the pub cheese, but got served the...calamari instead?!?  I never order calamari, been over it since, the 90's???  The wifey ordered the tomato bisque, which was ok but not impressive and tasted like a stick of butter was dropped in it.  When asked what we want to drink, I am pretty particular, so asked what's on the drink menu.  The answer was...""there is none.""  Okay fine, so I asked what whiskey, bourbon or scotch was available.  Unfortunately, the waiter was probably new and unfamiliar with the offerings.  Eventually, the most exotic thing closest to what I was looking for was a McCallan 12, doable I suppose.  

The decor weird was wierd, kinda like and old time, early 1900's feel, only open in a casino.  I never quite enjoyed eating in a cage where everyone can watch you and blow some second hand smoke flavoring into your meal.  But, like I said, trial and error is the nature of the best when trying out new places.

Overall, the place is obviously in its prenatal phase and perfect for the slot player taking a break from 12 straight hours of max play.  Otherwise, I would probably opt for the Chinese spot next door or with the other places in downtown.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,1,0,2,BDr9jQTq9D-kqg47-Hhh2Q

 Granted, a biker wedding party ascended in them with zero notice and another giant party of 8 stumbled in right before us.
 But...we were in a giant hurry as well and had we been quoted 40 min instead of 20, we would have simply waited until after our event to eat. Honest! And all would have been well!
 Instead, it turned into two stressed adults nervously checking watches and phones every two minutes, tapping feet and utensils, and two kids, told to shovel the food into the to go containers upon arrival. A disaster.
 Now the food- I liked the prime rib special at 9.99 a lot! Hated the creamed horse radish, I want the real stuff, but oh well. 
 One kidlet ordered the OMG burger, I was desperately hoping to snatch a taste, but he inhaled all of it. Must be good!
 The second offspring ordered the chicken and waffles. This is seriously an acquired taste. I hate mixing sweet and savory, so I'm basing this on taste of chicken breast alone- meh, very meh. Dry and not flavorful, though big portion. 
 Altogether- passable for coffee shop food.  Good prime rib value.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,3,2,3,T6U4TB1EnfnL3NZx26PUVg

The only thing I can say that is bothersome is the fact that if you're a non smoker as myself you can smell the smoke pretty strong at times because there are slot machines on the other side of the wall that are open air (no windows$"") to the restaurant so if someone is using a machine the smoke comes right in to where you're eating.

Got in just before the graveyard shift menu kicked in (1 a.m.), so we were able to score the OMG! Burgers. A pleasant surprise for Fremont Street, and well worth the $10. Topped with bacon, tomato, your choice of cheese, fried onions, and an accompaniment of French fries, it's easy to see why it garnered such recognition. A grease monster loaded with bacon and onions, reminiscent of a back home, sophisticated cure to the common hangover. My only complaint throughout service was...the service. At most there were four tables dining in, and the server still needed help.  Slow service, and a lack of attention to the customers was apparent. Not to mention, attempts at dry sarcastic humor by our waiter fell way short, even for these Dick's Last Resort fans. ""We're all out of burger meat"". Really?! A second away from walking out before he decided to let us in on the childish gag. Anyways, food was solid, the OMG!

We had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was 3/4 empty.  Then, after ordering, I was presented with a Baby Spinach Salad without any dressing on it at all.  The Buttermilk Biscuit Croutons were very good, but the dish just did not come together as a whole.

The fairly large shrimp in a Shrimp Cocktail were meaty and cold, but not that tasty.  And the Horsey Sauce accompanying this app was just too mild.  When my entrée at length arrived, its diminutive appearance was quite underwhelming: two small fillets of Pan Seared Trout with Cilantro Rice, cut carrots, and Sweet & Sour Cabbage that was not juicy and neither particularly sweet nor sour.  The trout tasted better than it looked, but it was just average in quality.  

Service was very inattentive, and there was a long break between preliminaries and delivery of the entrees.  Seating was comfortable, but the whole vibe was more that of a coffee shop than a casino's featured restaurant.  It would be pretentious to call what was served to my party of four ""fine dining.""  

Reportedly a new executive chef is now in the kitchen, and some new menu items are already being phased in.  But I highly doubt that I will be back.  Even at a special January promotion price of 50% off for locals with a Downtown Grand My Points player's card, I did not feel that I got good value for my money.
