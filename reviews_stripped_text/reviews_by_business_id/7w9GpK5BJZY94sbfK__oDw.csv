78979,2013-08-03,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,Best pizza I have ever had. Talked to the manager/owner that I'm allergic to gluten and he said he'd order gluten free dough now. I'm so happy I can eat this delicious pizza without gluten pain!,7tQmLbRYI6Sq3drH3hhlqg,0,0,5,AHtkcpRF0POSCsMonQJdbg
404187,2014-08-24,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,Really good food.. They messed up on my order which took a little long not to long . I asked for a sausage pizza and they put pepperoni instead.. I told them I didn't see any sausage and he said it's there it's under the cheese. I said no it's not and the lady in the back said she messed up but they said they would fix it. They did and it was excellent. Also have good chicken wings and the mozzarella sticks were really good! Great price I would eat here again. If they didn't mess up I would have gave them a 4 star rating.,uzCzsLxPjBSSYBN88Z5GDA,0,0,3,LqcD5cnYBoBEZrYz_t9QnQ
574813,2013-04-17,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"Love to get Pizza at Moes!  Cheap and the owner is the friendliest in town.  Seems like he works 7 days a week, because hes never not there.  We get the $10 Carryout pizza special, freaking delicious.  As for the other non pizza foods, there just ok.  The burger is huge and good but the fries are always kinda soggy.  The hot wings are good but suffer a little due to the over-complicated taste of the sauce. Maybe too much seasoning? The baklava is made on location and is freaking delicious.  Will come again and again.",5XMkhq_xbycJYlOtsSwCEA,1,0,4,QvzureuMGZjkM6xpVAiGFA
707758,2011-02-06,3,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,I've read many raving reviews about this place but found it to be less than good myself.  It kinda tasted like frozen pizza dough(its not) and my cheese was barely meted.  I prefer my pizza to be nice and bubbly on top.  I give it two stars because the owner was super nice and gave us extra toppings for free.,23Y5byjolCLNmsHFCQQtXw,0,0,2,-tfHRWI4Dz7SgJNS2Yh2eQ
1127981,2014-08-27,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,So after living in this area off and on for a few years finally decided to give this place a shot and wow I had been missing out the pizza was amazing and I loved the chili cheese fries and I think that was the best tiramisu I have had in a long time......the owner took our order and is one of the nicest people I have met and you can tell he takes pride in his food....he had just made a batch of baklava and gave my husband and I a piece to try while we waited....I hate nuts but I would have eaten another piece of that,8RfFlYmt2sooZbfqjXgIyQ,0,0,5,s8Arx4NTFh4jo1DC_sbYfA

1803323,2015-05-06,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"The edges of the pizza were burnt. Not just browned but def burnt. My daughter liked it, but then again what child will not like a pizza!? I was not happy with it and will not order again. Prices are good, but seems that reflects the quality. The cheese did not taste like real cheese... Tasted like an imitation cheese.",ltyYc01GxxJIML5EZ8cWcQ,0,0,2,jtm3M_bQMd2BE7QuBKFvCA
1858759,2015-06-21,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"This is my second (and updated review) of Mo's. 

I have now ordered 5 times from Mo's and all in all, It's pretty darn consistent. Pizza is solid and the sides are as well. Last order, I got the Anti-Pasto salad. It had to be 3 pounds. I was shocked. Usually you get 3 leaves of greens and a slice of bologna. I was impressed. Think I might have spoken to the owner last time I ordered. He asked if I had tried the Baklava and I had not. So I ordered a piece but he said he was sending 2 cuz I would swear it's the best ever. It was pretty amazing.

Look, Mo's is not Spagos an I get the impression from many of the poor reviews that they were either expecting Wolfgang Puck to ring their door bell OR they are used to factory pizza from Papa John's.

DO NOT LET THE PRICES FOOL YOU. Mo's is pretty darn good. Gonna order again right now.",C9KbGKrby4tIx9Qp3KwVpg,0,0,5,fyXXzLnHfLPkR9hlLFfCsQ
2445822,2012-06-01,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"I tried the $5.99 large 16"" cheese pizza special here yesterday and it wasn't bad for a pizzeria located in a gas station. I honestly didn't catch which kind of cheese was used, but it was garnished with herbs which gave it a good taste. I will go back here when I feel like a pizza again since I live close to it. The menu also included the extras like pasta and burgers, I'll try one of those next time I go along with the pizza.",SmS3lS6Xlttc1hi3Qbwf-Q,1,1,4,YW_8U04kqAZSPNhl_eQo_w
2498977,2015-02-09,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,MO is awesome. love the little family business.  When I first moved to the neighborhood I got it like every 3 days lol. My fave is a large 4 topping and a double cheese with fries.  It's more then enough and my daughter loves the burger. FYI the baklava is amazing and homemade.,VQxqHWzdo5nb9y0_i4BAQg,0,0,5,qW9W6pFuoMPC2USKkKv7bw

3023158,2013-07-28,1,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"Pizza is like sex.  Even if it's bad, it's still good.  That pretty much sums up how I feel about this place.  The pizza itself wasn't too bad.  I liked the garlic stuff they put on the crust.  I was disappointed that they screwed up my order and instead of pepperoni and garlic, I got pepperoni and olives.  They didn't even apologize or offer to give us a discount or anything.  We also tried their chicken fingers which were alright. Nothing special.  You could tell they were the cheaper ones.  For the price though, I'd go back again (2 med 2 topping pizzas, 5 fingers for $15).",zbRjeEkON8EXFk_VrcTAiA,0,0,3,IjmRWHgJPxjOx3mjQ_Mfxw
3488887,2012-06-03,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"I love Mo's, been here plenty of times and it never has disappointed. The pizza is great and well priced, good extras too including the Eggplant Parmesan dinner. Also, the owner is really nice and goes above and beyond for his customers. I recommend trying it out, and not for just the pizza. Everything there is made there except for the desserts which is fine with me. He does make the baklava himself though.",mxfz2-70ItUmD1ivFdjX4A,0,0,5,yGLkLZXVgs01reZ7lTsV8w
3786429,2013-08-18,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"They first time I ordered delivery from mo's pizza I spoke directly with the owner. I asked "" what do you recommend"" 
  he told me 
   ""listen I opened up a pizza place to make great pizza, you tell me what you like & I will make it happen"" 
 I've tried 
 Pizzas 
    Meats pizza (ham, pep, sausage ext.)
    Cheese
    White pizza with chicken and jalapeño 
    Hawaiian   
Fingers 
    Hot & mild
Salad 
   Greek 

All of my pizzas have been soooo tasty! The garlic and cheese is always fanatic. My favorites have been the white pizza with chicken and jalapeños & the Hawaiian. My girlfriend doesn't even like pizza but she says Mo's is just something different.
  The chicken wings are ehhh.. Personally I doubt I would order them again but this is a pizza place not a wing stop. 
 The Greek salad was good but my only complaint was that it lacked the Greek olives and side dressing. I will order this again.
  
That being said, when I can order a salad & large pie for under $20 I couldn't be happier. I have food left over and it's extremely good. Ive ordered from mo's at-least 10 times now & only see that number continuing to grow. Stop with the pizza chains and support a local pizza shop who truly cares about making a good pie.

3835010,2014-12-08,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"We ordered from this place for the first time. We ordered 2 hot dogs, a western bacon cheeseburger, an avocado burger, and a pizza. Let's start with the hot dogs....they were BLACK! And covered in ketchup and mustard.  I would have preferred that on the side. The bacon on the burgers was turkey bacon! If you are going to use turkey bacon on your products you should inform your customers so they can decide if they want that bacon! The avocado was brown and looked old. I hear the pizza wasn't bad. Pretty sure we won't be ordering from here anymore.",ZvCfEZOJ0Mlsh9vg67-ntw,0,0,2,mrBMw9QtMZ1V9agctKoCQA

4577464,2010-10-07,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"This place is a little hard to find at first its inside the shell gas station. But do not let that detour you. Pretty much every thing there is awesome. Prices are awesome too. The 16"" one topping pizza is 7.99 it really reminds me of the pizza places back east. It just has that look and feel. Pretty much every thing there is made there so its not just a bunch of frozen stuff. Plus Mo the guy who owns it is the nicest guy ever he really puts forth the effort to get to know his customers and to remember them. 

Also they have home made baklava that is .99 a piece

You really cant go wrong with Mo's.",3DjTbhg_HndAxtRnRBt0aQ,5,0,5,5a8K0syGqEcqm-wLqdR6qg
4896451,2015-01-12,0,7w9GpK5BJZY94sbfK__oDw,"Just Got my pizza delivered. Took more than a hour witch is disappointing. I was excited about trying this pizza since I never had it before and got there flyer at my door and because of their cheap deals.... Just to start off got wings spicy and teriyaki. Disgusting. Spicy was salty and teriyaki burnt with no flavor. Horrible. Pizza was even worse. No flavor and nothing but chesse. Not really any meat.
I should have cancelled my order in the beginning when the lady who took my order had no customer service skills and was a Rude lady.

Do your self a favor dont waste your money. I wasted $30 and didnt have more then a slice. Just tossed it in the trash and got In and Out instead. Very disappointed and irritated. Wish I could give No Stars!!!

And to top it off me and my son and my friend areor sick to our stomach. Gas, diarrhea, Stomach pain, my son vomiting. I just cant believe this restaurant horrible. I will be complaining tomorrow to the owners. F this place.",6WyR4VPo_kxUMLQ3r3JeWw,1,1,1,dgFKjK-FVeqO9VOObD2UhQ

I've been so many times since I've been introduced to Mo's that I really can't recall what I had the very first time. I'm a plain Jane with my pizza toppings but I can tell you that the crust is amazing!! Whatever toppings you desire, you should be very pleased. I'm a huge fan of the pizza because it has a homemade touch to it. It's like walking in someone's kitchen and having them cook for you in their home. The baklava...AMAZING!!! I've never been disappointed with any of my orders from here and the prices even due to inflation are still a great bargain for what you're eating. I can't get enough of this place and still haven't tried their breakfast yet.",ymwuG7mqMGC3FXD3wYT1kA,0,0,5,gDvVtL6l6lMjzY20TwvcMQ
