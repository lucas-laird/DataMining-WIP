I've traveled to New York, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Portland (Or), Vancouver BC and other cities. The crab cakes could be called salt cakes. My pot roast was overcooked, dry, bland. Of the 8 friends we dined with, none finished their meals (they got the $40 sampler). I will probabably return to stay at Tropicana, but wouldn't eat at Biscayne again, even if free. We blew $50+/person, save your money and eat anywhere else.

I mentioned this during checkout and recieved a follow-up email. I expressed what I've said above and never heard back from them. Seriously, go to the Grand Luxe @Venitian for better and less expenseive eats.",wEdGaovHTWudypJP2w0BCA,1,0,1,GvuU86lcfNjAu7qnsA7JFw

One of us had the tasting menu, which was wonderful, and a great value, along with a nice quality taste of wine with each course, and the other had steak and lobster, which was amazing.
Would definitely go again.  Food was delicious, service was very good, and the room was stunningly beautiful.

The onion  soup was amazing and I ordered the sea scallops for an entree with asparagus for a side dish. The sea scallops were perfectly cooked as well as the asparagus. The scallops came out with a small side of succotash which was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the NY steak medium. It was cooked perfectly as well. Two pretty great entrees. The service here is great. We made reservations and had to switch it at the last minute. The staff was very accommodating.

The restaurant is located up the escalators on the 2nd floor from the main entrance. The d√©cor is elegant and simple. The ambiance was ruined a bit by loud passers by going to and from the pool. Inside, the service was superb. Often times, when you go to places that are nice and expensive, the service is subpar. I should preface that my husband and I are not ""fancy"" dressers, but we like good meals. So we are often given the ""can you afford this"" treatment. Not here, everyone was very friendly and attentive and the server happily made recommendations. We started the meal with this yummy pretzel bread and my glass of wine. For dinner, my husband had the burger and I had steaks. The steak was surprising large and well cooked, served with mixed veggies (a little harder than I prefer) and four sauces to choose from. The burger was also very big with two patties and served with fries. With all the food, we had little room for desert. I would highly recommend this place for excellent service and similarly excellent food.",FZ4XboVDAqszcLEtIknb2Q,3,0,5,Zid4PNlno_H7i8QwWBRgTw

they tasted nothing better than $10 a pound  supermarket bought steaks  , i mean like kroger  not whole foods.. steaks were. $55 each.. baked potatoes and some vegetables were extra (the nerve) total bill for 2 steaks and 2 drinks , over $160.00

Rating: Five stars

Service: The pre-dinner service at the bar was disappointing.  The bartender left the bar and spent 10 minutes visiting tables to chit-chat rather than tending to several customers who were waiting.  The manager had to become involved.  The dinner service was much better, but the overall service experience was disappointing.  The service brings down the overall rating.  Rather than being a four or five-star restaurant, this is a three-star restaurant.  No one offered to comp the drinks.

Customer service was amazing, greeted at the door, always attended to and a special thanks to Miriam for being friendly & patient with all of my special food requests.

Steak was overcooked and served cold. 2. Waitress never checked on us or helped with anything (she must have known her 18% was in the bag). 3. I have reason to believe the food given to us was either old or spoiled. My fiance has been sick in the room since.

Anyways, other patrons had a great 50$ deal with wine pairings this was excluded from our coupon... They were also given exceptional waitservice because the waiter wasn't guaranteed any tip....

The restaurant was empty during a dinner hour on a holiday. It should have been our first red flag, will never go to Tropicana or the half price ticket place again due to the scam involved. Beware tourists!!! They will scam you for subpar service and poorly prepared meals. In comparison we goto crab places all the time in Chicago which are even further from a coast that would supply seafood and we are always satisfied or astounded by the quality.",t6gPlKaWCthDEDux9Myx7w,3,0,1,pkpnHC4ng4-nYpgt4AFrxw

859077,2012-04-12,0,rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg,"It was a very nice surprise. When you think of Tropicana you think old, smoky and 1970's, but things may be changing (at least it has for this steak place). 

For a starter we had the short rib mac & cheese bits. This was done well and an excellent start. tip : Save some of the wine reduction cheese sauce for the pretzel bread, it's a good combination as well.

I had the surf & turf for $69.00. It was a 6 oz filet with a Australian lobster tail. The side was garlic mashed with chopped shrimp. The steak was cooked perfectly, the lobster was maybe 8 oz and was also perfect (the waiter had said that the tails this week were larger than normal and he was spot on!). The garlic mashed with the shrimp was awesome. I don't EVER recall shrimp in a mashed side. Great Idea.

The wine list was good to great. It has a list of 25 current wine releases that can be had for $25.00 per bottle. So you don;t have to over do it on the wine if you don't want to. We opted for another Napa cab that was a little more than $65.00.

The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. 

Most reveiwers could easily give this 5 stars but for me it's  4 due to some of their clientele wearing jeans, t-shirt and flip flops ( but that's vegas for you).

Total bill before tip was $213 (1 appetizer, 2 dinners, 1 side & 1 bottle of wine).

You will not be disappointed.

We will definately be back. ( we've eaten at Charlie Palmer steak @ 4 Seasons in LV, so we know a great steak when we have 1)",f892l8yJkPJcTcqQgDeSsw,0,0,4,vTaj0zXtrsoKQsM0tq_qkg

So I went last night (Sunday) with a friend and the service was top notch. The hostess was down-to-earth and friendly. The service was well-paced throughout the meal and her menu recommendations were appreciated. 

We couldn't decide which app to leave out between the crab cakes, scallops and fried green tomatoes. She steered us towards the seafood. The crab cakes were light with little filler and quite appropriately crabby. Scallops were seared well and served beautifully with a bit of sauce and bammage. We both commented on the stellar presentation and execution of both dishes.

Our waitress also knew her steaks. I wanted the grass-fed NY Strip, but she said the Prime was also grass fed but had better texture and flavor, as the grass-fed wasn't on the bone. My friend had the filet. Both were ordered and came out medium rare. Very juicy, very flavorful. Both of us said it was the best steak we've had in years. It blew away the NY Strip I recently had at Philadelphia's top steakhouse (that was a 45-day dry-aged Strip also on the bone). 

For dessert we shared the deconstructed banana dish. They had me at ""boat of chocolate.""

Service was outstanding, but the actual food?

The steak was disappointing. Overpriced for this quality. My boyfriend and I both ordered steak (He ordered Kobe Beef, I ordered Texas Wagyu), and it was bland and just failed to meet our expectations. Also the meat was overly fatty.

The House salad was nothing special. I've definitely had better salads. 3/5.

We also ordered the Pan seared scallops. They melted in your mouth with the perfect amount of seasoning. Wow, it was so good. 5/5.

I ended up not eating my texas wagyu steak. I got it to-go to bring home because I didn't want to waste it after paying $50 for it, but I ended up throwing the whole thing away after I got home. 

I'm not sure how a restaurant at this price point wasn't able to deliver really good steak. The steak was forgettable, but my experience wasn't! We saw Bill Gates eating across from us, so I guess I'm happy I ate here :) Top notch service here, but the food is average at best.

1739855,2011-01-17,7,rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg,"Five stars? Whoa. This place was great. No, this place was perfect. A five star review says two things; the food is breathtaking and the service is impeccable. Biscayne is located in the newly renovated Tropicana Hotel and is hidden in a secret hallway that even Batman himself could not find. Seriously, we had to ask three different hotel employees where the hell it was. The headache to find the place was definitely, one million percent worth it.

My best friend was turning 21 so we did what most Americans do, we took a weekend trip to Vegas baby! When we checked into the hotel (Tropicana) I shamelessly shouted out that it was my friend's 21st. The lovely front desk attendant then notified the manager and he gave us a free $200 credit to their in-house restaurant; BISCAYNE! How awesome is that? We originally had reservations at a different restaurant but we changed the date immediately (duh) when we were given this free credit.

As I said before, the restaurant is pretty well hidden. We had 9pm reservations and we didn't want the $200 credit to go to waste so we stuck it out and kept searching. After finally finding the entrance we were a solid fifteen minutes late. It took us about thirty minutes to find it (and we were staying in the same hotel). Jeez. When we got there we were seated immediately even though we were late. To our surprise the place was completely empty. Usually I take that as a bad sign and become skeptical of the quality of the restaurant. That's exactly what I did here.

When we sat down we were given our table bread, butter, and water pretty quickly. The table bread gave us three choices, but I only tried one, a soft pretzel. My god. I've had a lot of amazing table breads in my day, but I think I can safely say this was the best one yet. We actually loved it so much that our sweetheart waitress gave us four of them to take back to our rooms after the meal was over.

To start, we ordered a couple appetizers to split between everyone. We got an order of kobe beef sliders (with tilamook cheddar cheese) as well as lobster bisque (with poached Atlantic lobster). Is it weird that we ordered one lobster bisque and passed it around the table? Don't judge. It was amazing and had huge chucks of lobster in it. I'm not going to lie, but I definitely had more than anyone else at the table. Score one for Kevin. The sliders dish usually only comes with three (there were four of us at the table). Our server asked us if we wanted to add just one slider to the dish so everyone gets their own mini burger. I thought that was nice because most restaurants will require you to buy an entire second order. The burgers themselves were great. The beef was juicy, but not greasy, and the tiny veggies complimented it perfectly.

Biscayne is primarily a steakhouse, however I'm not a steak fan. So much in fact that I would definitely be blacklisted if I were to live in Texas. But I'm okay with that. Anyway, my eyes went directly to the ""sea"" section of the menu. The two things that stuck out most to me were the halibut and the salmon. Someone else at the table ordered the halibut so I decided to get the wild Atlantic salmon (with chipotle pineapple yogurt sauce and seasonal vegetables). The chef prepared that salmon so perfectly that I purposely wasn't given a knife. As soon as I cut into the first bite (with my fork) I could tell how amazing it was. The pineapple yogurt sauce was fabulous as well. Usually fruity sauces can overpower and ultimately destroy the flavor of the fish (in my opinion) but this was done perfectly and the amount wasn't overbearing whatsoever.

To go along with my seafood obsession I got a side order of lobster mac and cheese. Whoa. Just... whoa. I honestly can't write a review on the mac and cheese because the written word cannot do it justice. Lets just simply say that it's a must order. You're welcome in advance.

For dessert my friend got a birthday dish (complete with candle). It was key lime cheesecake. Being the nice guy I am, I put aside my cheesecake fetish and only tried one tiny bite. I didn't want to completely devour my best friend's birthday cake even though every urge in my body was telling me I should. The one bite I had was just enough to add it to the five star rating.

Even though Biscayne is hard to find, I'll say again, it's completely worth it. I want to personally build a brick wall in front of it so it doesn't get revealed to the general public. I even thought about purposely writing a horrible review so people wouldn't want to dine here. I'm selfish, and I want Biscayne all to myself. But being only the second to write a review I owe it to the chef and wonderful staff to give them the glory they deserve. Now I can't think of a catchy way to end a review that gives so much praise so I'll give it my best shot...

-Sushi appetizer
-The day's special which was a Texas Wagyu New York Strip
- Seafood pasta.

I also had a Sazerac cocktail which was also underwhelming.  The drink was heavy on the absinthe, overpowering the rye.  The sushi could have been more fresh and the rice in the rolls and nigiri was rock hard leaving me to believe it was premade and stored in a fridge.

As for the entrees, I would like to believe that I've had at at least enough Wagyu to have a decent handle on it.  The steak we had was probably the toughest Wagyu I have ever had.  It was cooked at a good medium rare which I prefer but I definitely feel like it should have been more tender.  The cut also seemed less then ideal.

The seafood pasta was not as bad.  The scallops were good, shrimp was also big and tender.  However the lobster tail was way overcooked and super tough.

The first night I came to Biscayne I ordered the started seared scallops with asparagus. The scallops were beautifully cooked and the sauce along side was a delicious combination. I also shared the caesar salad with a friend. I saw on yelp they give whole leaves of lettuce so I had them chop up the leaves. The salad was a little too overdressed for me, but it was still good. For my entree, I ordered the smaller filet mignon. It came with brussel sprouts which were delicious, as for my steak, though I asked for medium-rare, the outside looked dry and kind of unappetizing. For dessert, I got the key lime tart. The plate presentation wasn't very elegant but after eating such a heavy meal, it was nice that the tart was light and fairly cleansing.

The second night for dinner my grandparents ordered the seasonal oysters. They were so good! Not slimy or gritty at all! Some were a little small but others were fairly well in size. For my starter my grandmother told me to try the eggplant lamb tacos. The salsa that came with the tacos was delicious, but sadly the tacos themselves were too oily for my liking. I also ordered the french onion soup, it wasn't too salty like many can be. I ordered the crab legs for dinner and they were pretty good. Nothing super special but what I like most is the fact that they cut them open for you. No need to get your hands dirty from peeling out the meat yourself!! And for dessert I ordered the apple tart-thing. It's like baked apples over a phyllo dough chip served along side caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. The caramel sauce with the ice cream was great, but the apple tart itself wasn't super good. I rather have an apple crisp like dessert instead.

Finally on my last night here, I started with the lobster bisque. Usually, I like my bisques, but because this was a lobster bisque, it was REALLY rich and salty. If you like rich foods, I suggest getting this. I then got the shrimp scampi, starter. I didn't realize it came with a lobster sauce, so great MORE rich food (I hope you hear my sarcasm). My aunty ordered the shrimp scampi the day before with a lemon butter sauce (which is what I should've asked for but forgot), her's looked delicious! So by the time my entree came, I was already filled with soo much rich and heavy foods. I ordered the seared scallops for dinner, that's SIX fat scallops cooked to perfection. I sadly could only eat 2.5 of them, I felt terrible for wasting them but I just couldn't fit anything else in my stomach.

I wouldn't normally pick a Biscayne because it's inside Tropicana, but figured it's RW so why not take an adventure and check out Biscayne at Trop since it has been recently renovated.

Made reservations and we were sat right on time. For a Monday evening this place was pretty busy... when we left about 3/4 of the tables were occupied.

We had 2 folks waiting on us.... and they were pretty good.  Our water glasses were never empty which gets points in my book.

Ambiance:
Upscale, Casual
The dining room chairs were oddly comfortable.
Lots of white and light colors accented with tall colorful vases.
Seems like it would be a good place to have a nice, power lunch... except that you do have to walk through the entire casino and go upstairs.

Drinks:
Their regular mojito was not good... .watery and blah.
Their ginger mojito however was flavorful and fresh. You do need to like ginger though.

Bread:
Ok...not super great .... IMO the pretzel bread crust was weak and salty but the insides were nice and soft. The other bread was a multigrain roll... again nothing super fabulous.

Conch Fritters:
Light and Fluffy!  Not greasy at all.  This was a surprising find. (Not on the RW menu.... we saw them and had to try them.)

Eggplant Chicken Tostada:
So GOOD!  The eggplant was thin and fried in a light batter... topped with shredded smoked chicken with a mango pico type salsa and bits of goat cheese on top. Really great flavors that strangely work together.

Shrimp and Corn Chowder:
Light, Sweet and Savory!  Not creamy and Not heavy. I wouldn't normally order this so I'm glad this was on the RW menu.  It was a good summer soup.

Seabass (Bronzino-sp?) with fancy sticky rice and a side of baby veggies:
A bit on the fishy side but it was a good fishy...not a bad fishy. And paired with the sticky rice was a nice compliment and complement.  :)

Coconut Sorbet:
Silky, Smooth and Creamy.... not overly sweet and not heavy... a great light dessert.

Overall.... I'd say this was a Good Find.  :)",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,0,4,W1MsBgscm9qoTvNcwPMdTg

We had a 3 course meal starting with (gigantic) shrimp cocktail or yummy crab cakes. This was followed by an iceberg wedge salad or lobster bisque. The main course was a choice of tenderloin, roast chicken, roast snapper, or rib eye. I had the tenderloin which was one of the best I've ever had. I had a bite of the snapper which I've never tasted before and it was prepared well - I would definitely try this again here. Dessert was a key lime tart and I added a cannoli cream wedding cake which was yummy for being made in Vegas! All of our guests sampled everything chosen and they each enjoyed the food. We were all happy and stuffed by the time we left. 

Not only was the food good, but the staff was on point for the event. Some of our guests were late getting back from the chapel so we started dinner late. Although we had to wait, the staff made sure we had drinks. Hector took care of us and made sure our dinner progressed smoothly.

I would definitely go back to Biscayne the next time we're in Vegas.",25Nnn0KIfxOnCPlkcoXLGg,0,0,5,vmowG7uMlKRImCzMlFnlHQ

We were staying at the Tropicana, I found a Groupon for Biscayne ($72 for a Groupon that covers $118 worth of food), and they were on OpenTable for a last minute reservation.

Our server, Alex, was a little slow to arrive at our table due to the needs of other tables, so someone else came and got our drink orders and table bread while we were waiting. Once Alex was there, we couldn't have asked for a more attentive or helpful server. We told him we were in a hurry, so he put our order in right away. He was also happy to oblige when I asked him to bring the check as soon as our food came out, so we would be ready to leave when we were done eating.

Our drinks were refilled promptly, Alex checked on us before our dinners were out to tell us they would be out in a couple minutes (he knew we were in a rush), and kept to his word and delivered them 2 minutes later. We both got the Biscayne Signature Chopped Salad, which I loved - my wife thought it was a bit light on poached shrimp and crab meat, though. I got the 18oz Rib Eye, and it was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of marbling for my tastes (I like the fat, but not when there's a lot of it). My wife got the small order of King Crab Legs (they have a 1lb order, and a 1/2lb order). The meat was very good, and she felt like there was enough there to satisfy her. I think if I had ordered it, though, I would've been reaching for more bread after finishing my entree.

4 stars could've been 5 if the prices were a bit lower. The Groupon made the price right about what I would normally expect to pay for the meal we ate - $100 or so after tip (no alcohol) for two of us.",WVy4ppddT2HXXfjzUrv1qA,2,0,4,bLzwincX2BH5WbIgh2EYXw

I had a Groupon which was $69 for $118 worth of food.  My boyfriend asked for their most romantic table and instead of the open booth at the window overlooking the pool we were put in the center of the restaurant.
It was somewhat busy, as Saturday nite but not filled so shouldn't have been a problem.  
Waiter was a little slow on service thoughout. Previous waiters were very attentive and responsive, this one was not.  We ordered wine and then a full dinner with sides knowing we were going over the price of the Groupon a bit.
The 'Chopped Salad' was basically a plate full of garbanzo beans, a little bit of cucumber, olives and Italian dressing...not much of a salad in my experience.  French Onion Soup was great, though, with a delicious little 'grilled cheese' sandwich that was 'the bomb'!
We both had the 8 oz Filet, medium, which I've had both times before.  My boyfriend's was perfectly cooked and seasoned, mine was med rare once I got 1/2 "" into it...waiter never appeared to see how they were so I ate the outside and left 1/2 of the steak on my plate.
Sides, though, were delicious and plentiful.
My main complaint was that the service was sketchy, steak was very undercooked and when the bill came there was the auto tip of $30 which...if the service would've been good isn't a problem but when it's like it was I really resent that 'auto tip' that many times allows the service to be lacking.

The buttermilk dressing and bacon served with the salad was decent but a little underwhelming. The grouper with mango salsa was cooked well and was tasty. We did have some issues with the filet, which we asked for medium-well, but it came out very well-done and tough. Our server's assistant apologized and brought us another filet which came out medium/medium-rare. A little undercooked for me, but the taste was decent and it was very moist.

Need to put in a LOT more effort to convince people it's truly ""all new"", not just new decor.  But they certainly don't go the extra mile to achieve that.

I know this isn't a review for the Tropicana, but it's relevant, because you have to go this hotel to go to Biscayne and the hotel is a big factor any time you're choosing a restaurant in Vegas.  I had a $50 dry aged rib-eye and $20 crab cakes.  Both were fine, I had no issue with either of them.  But if I'm going to pay that price, I expect the product to be exceptional, not fine.  There are so many awesome restaurants in Vegas, located in much nicer hotels, I can't imagine why anybody would choose to go here, unless they had to stay here... and as I mentioned above, I don't know why people would stay here, with so many other quality options.

I can't complain about the food, but the lower rating is for the price and location, which don't justify going here.  If I want to spend money, there are dozens of better choices.  Otherwise, I would be equally satisfied with a great steak over at Ellis Island for $8.

We made a reservation and were seated on-time, and in a great spot by the window.  Someone came over to inquire about water preferences, and came back promptly with them.  Our waiter, Alex, shared the iPad wine list with us; I didn't see Moscato by the glass, inquired, and he was able to make it happen (his choice was great too, one of the best Moscato's I've had).  We placed our order, with a few customizations, and all were fulfilled perfectly.  

Ambiance - It's a nice looking place.  Not too fancy, not too casual.  It's a bit of an odd location, between the conference center and the players club, but we had a nice view of the pool deck below.

Service - As mentioned above, the entire wait-staff was spectacular.  Our drinks were kept topped off, our waiter made great recommendations, we devoured the bread and they brought more for us.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure we had an enjoyable experience.

Quantity - Ideal portion sizes on everything.  We both ordered different steak options, and were pleased.  We split the fingerling potatoes, and there was more than we could finish.

Quality - Quality was good on all items.  Perfect choice of wine (Moscato) made by our waiter; both our steaks were delicious (mine was a tad undercooked for my liking, but not so much that I didn't still enjoy it); my wife had her steak well-done, and the chef prepared it expertly, as it was still tender.  The bread with aioli spread was delicious!  

Value - The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star review.  Not that this place was over-priced, as everything was pretty spot-on (all the above categories); if the prices were a tad less expensive, I would make this a ""must visit"" location every time I was in town.  $45 for a high-end steak is not unreasonable (for special occasions), but a bit more than my wallet can handle with any frequency!

Overall - We both really enjoyed the meal, and have made a mental note to come back next time we're ""in town"".  We enjoyed every course/dish, and the service was spectacular.

The bread and nice little spread that comes with it were tasty. We shared one drink and it was well prepared. I liked the amuse bouche that came before the meal, very nice touch. We both started with the Biscayne house salad. I loved the unique combination of flavors-hearts of palm, crab, grapefruit, tomatoes and topped with a flavorful dressing. I had the prime rib which was prepared just as I requested. My husband thought his steak was well prepared and tender as well.

We arrived for our reservations and were seated after a short delay.  When we arrived the wait list was 2 hours long so make sure to make a reservation.

We started off with the shrimp cocktail.  These were some of the biggest shrimp I have seen on a cocktail.  We were served 4 shrimp.  We were not told the size but they looked like they may have been U-8's (more likely U-16's but they were huge).  They were served with two sauces both of which were excellent.

Out next course was a wedge salad.  Their wedge salad consists of three separate salads: a traditional wedge, a wedge with fried pepperoncini, and one with nuts and a dark dressing.  All three salads were pretty good.  

For our main courses we opted for an 18oz bone in ribeye and an 8 oz fillet, both cooked rare.  The side was the mash of the day (lobster mash potatoes).  The side was excellent.  Both steaks were pretty good.  The ribeye was overcooked and came out medium rare.  The filet was cooked properly but was a little tough.   

NOTE: The menu states ""Our steaks and prime rib are upper 2/3 choice Angus beef"".  This means they serve the top 1/3 of Choice beef.  Therefore they are not selling Prime beef but rather good cuts of choice beef.  The difference was noticeable in both steaks.  The Ribeye had larger pockets of fat as oppossed to more spread out marbleing.  The filet was tough for a filet.  The dry age on the Ribeye was excellent.  I really enjoyed the Ribeye and would give it a 7 out of 10.  The filet receives a 4 out of 10 because it was tough.

The service was really phenomenal the entire meal.  Ken explained everything and was a true pro.

The meal was reasonably priced for a nice Vegas meal  With that being said, for $40 to $50 a steak they should serve you Prime beef.

       - Decor - The decor is very clean and simple. It makes me feel like I'm dining at some beach paradise.
       - Service - The service was prompt and friendly.
       - Food - The entrees seemed dry and lacking in flavor. On the other hand, the appetizers/sides were delicious.
**Ordered**
       - $15 Lamb Eggplant Tacos - Lamb Taco with goat cheese and a breaded eggplant as the shell. It was probably the best thing about the meal. It was delicious and innovative. It could of been something out of Iron Chef (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg?select=4KtY00KWU99393RcV5kq9g#nwFUiPRKUBmXRaaUH95j9w).
       - $47 18oz Dry Aged Rib Eye - It comes with A1, Bearnaise, and a red wine sauce. Even with the variety of sauces, I thought the steak was bland overall. I usually like a more seared crust with a juicy interior. Unfortunately, ordering it at medium rare, I got none. It seemed more medium than anything. The meat was marbled nicely, however none of that flavor made it into the meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg?select=BZiMi51artxWJmBmAA_ymA#BZiMi51artxWJmBmAA_ymA).
       - $38 20oz Prime Rib - The prime rib also seemed very plain and overcooked (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg?select=XA17AEURnEE5YxYSWSrSdw#XA17AEURnEE5YxYSWSrSdw).
       - $10 Lobster Mac & Cheese - Probably one of my favorite lobster mac & cheeses. Large chunks of lobster improved the masterful taste of this sharp cheesy dish. The crispy flakes on top add a great texture to overall creaminess of the mac (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg?select=1DV1BO7WI3n1h8L3QMO_aw#1DV1BO7WI3n1h8L3QMO_aw).
**Recommendations**
       - I have mixed emotions about this place. I didn't enjoy the main entrees we got, but loved the appetizers/sides. In the end however, I don't think I can recommend this restaurant since you can't really have a dinner on just appetizers/sides.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,3,1,3,ahQ5HjYJq3y7Z5U8K6Wqdg

Our dinner was fine and the bread and dessert were good but for $33 fish entree which came with a garnish and was just a grilled piece of fish (you choose the sauce) and $10 for a side of mashed potatoes I think you can do better.

We received a complimentary h'orderve that consisted of a thinly sliced baguette on the bias with chocolate drizzled bacon on a Chinese spoon. First off, I learned in my culinary training that if you are to put an h'orderve on a Chinese spoon it must be able to be eaten in one bite...the h'orderve we received, I believe, did not work well this this concept.  We ordered the bacon falafel appetizer that came with the mango chutney. Overall, the flavor was decent, but my taste buds told me the mango did not go well with the falafel and perhaps this appetizer would be better off as an entree item. For my entree, I got the Kobe beef hamburger which came with 2 patties...the beef was very dry. The ciabatta bread did not go well with the Kobe beef because the bread was dry and no mayo was available...I couldn't find the waiter on time to ask for some mayo.

I had a lovely beef carpaccio.. the beef was perfectly shaved and served with capers, some very tasty buttered and toasted bread. The olive oil was drizzled on a bit too thickly, but overall this was a really nice dish. I ordered scallops for my main course and the waitress asked if I wanted the entree size or the appetizer size. She said there are 3 scallops on the appetizer and 6 on the entree. I was glad she told me and I went for the appetizer. It was the perfect size. The scallops were really big and cooked very nicely, they were served with a nice light sauce and some grilled asparagus.",rsQ8-0wabCe0IsB55gnwtA,0,1,3,z3FNny30qPnbE-6bJ2y9Eg

For the most part, it's how I'm feeling as well. No matter how much they try to fancy up the Trop, its still meh at best. 

Ambiance:3* 
 You do feel like you are transported to Miami when you walk in. However just like any other in casino steakhouse, the ambiance is ruined because there are hotel guests dining in whatever they rolled out of bed in.  

Food: 3.5*
The bread was not warm when it was served to us. I know its not a deal breaker but if you are charging  on the high side of $40 for a steak, you can at least give me fresh bread!

Lobster Bisque was awesome! It's a no brainer for the GF to order. I usually stay away from it because most of the time all I can taste is butter and no lobster in it. This version was almost like lobster chowder, it was nice and creamy and loaded with lobster meat.. 

Charcuterie Plate was ok.. I was drawn to it due to the exotic meats on it. Duck, elk, bison and wild boar. For a mix of wild gamey meats, all of them were very mild and lack any flavor. 

Meats
I had the aged ribeye. Bonus points for actually giving me an aged steak (just in case you cant tell the difference, aged steaks don't bleed) I ordered it as rare as they could serve it, and it came out just as I requested it. Bravo to the grill master on that however, it was lacking a good crust or any type of seasoning. I'm not asking for a super seasoned steak but a little salt and pepper would've gone a long way. The steak was accompanied by a trio of sauces that helped out but none of them wowed me.. I just expected a little more WOW factor at $49 a steak. 

The lady ordered a NY strip (med), it came out on the med/well side so needless to say it was on the dry side. 


Service 4*
I came here with the premise that the service was mediocre based upon previous reviews. I must say that our service was on point. As soon as we were done with a course, the bussers were there waiting on us to clear it for the next set. I felt a little rushed however it was nice knowing that they were attentive. We never once had to ask for water and we were check on at a regular basis. 




 As mentioned at the top of the review I am mixed on this one. The service, wine and appetizers were great but the main dishes left more to be desired. I had a groupon for $100 and still spent another $130 on top of it. For that much for 2 people I expect to be wowed and blissfully numb from the food. I left satisfied but disappointed at the same time. 


The only way I'd recommend this place is if you had a dining voucher from the hotel.. For the same price you can go to STK, Flemming's or Gordon Ramsey's and be amazed....",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,5,0,3,jAT__WHUSZIGxkL4lGaO9A
5919459,2015-04-29,0,rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg,Used a Groupon here.  Food was average for a steakhouse.  Not the restaurant's fault at all but we sat by a window and there were several moth's that were irritating.  Didn't get in the food or anything and wait staff was good about getting rid of them.  Just that time of year. Good prompt service and I would recommend if you want an average meal.,avzSlU2FEb5y8l5qd0nhPA,0,0,4,evTxWQIQWQWb_GiitIk_iw
5948139,2015-05-31,0,rbDqCV2g23K3ZrTxmgoNBg,"I've walked past this restaurant about 100 times in the last couple of years.  We always stay at the Trop( I get a great rate) and since it was our anniversary the day after Memorial Day, we decided to eat here.  Also, a groupon came up with an additional 20% off.  So, I ended up paying 58.00 for 118.00 worth of food.  Let me tell you, my bill was EXACTLY 118.00.  Not sure how I pulled that off. 

The groupon said that it was for 2 salads and 2 entrees worth 44.00 each.  When we sat down, the server Ken said that we had 118.00 to spend, we didnt have to spend it that way.  That was a lot better for me because my spouse and I usually share a salad.   

So, first up the bread.  NOT A FAN.  It was sliced and toasted.  Made me wonder if the bread was leftover from the night before and they just toasted it to freshen it up.  Toast is for breakfast!!    They did give us a tomato concasse, but we passed on that because we're not fans of raw tomatoes.  We asked for butter and it was hard as a rock.  Not cool with that either.  They could have at least softened it up a bit. 

My spouse wasnt feeling salad, so I had a bowl of the shrimp/clam chowder.( 13.00).  It was really tasty, lots of big shrimp, but the flavor was definitely more clam than shrimp.  Here is the thing, because I've had weight loss surgery and can't eat that much, I ate a few spoons and wanted to take the rest home.  Nope, they have no To Go containers.  Seriously?  I feel like every single restaurant should have To Go containers.  I asked Ken to ask the bartender for a cup and I'd throw some tin foil over it.  Yep, I bring tin foil on my trips.  You never know when you'll need some.  

I had the scallops and my wife had the sterling silver 8oz filet.  They asked her if they could butterfly it, I suppose because she ordered it medium well. 

We split a ginormous  baked potato( 10.00).   We actually only shared half so we took the other half home.  It came with all the fixings, butter, sour cream, chives, bacon and cheese.  

Both entrees came with a tiny( about 1/4c) side of fresh corn and edamame. 

For dessert we got the Key Lime tart and the deconstructed banana cream pie.  Both of those were just FAIR.  The banana cream pie was basically whipped cream, roasted bananas, a little sprinkling of some type of crumbs and some choc. sauce.  It needed a custard for sure.  The key lime pie was so frozen pie with an artificial green color.  The filling was too hard to enjoy the flavor.  We also asked about the ice creams/sorbets and was told they were not homemade.  Seriously?  If you're going to charge 10.00 for ice cream, it should be homemade. 

The entire meal I was seeing everyone get an amuse bouche except us.  When the bill came, it was on the check that we received it.  I told Ken that we did not.  He was going to give it to us, but that was kinda strange so I said NO.    I also mentioned that it was our anniversary when I made the reservation on Open Table.  It was never acknowledged any way what so ever.   

The service was ok, not overly attentive.  Maybe because we werent drinking?  I dont know.  I've had much better service at R Steak and Seafood( sadly gone) and Envy steakhouse.  

They also ad a required 18% service charge on the 118.00.  I don't think the server deserved 18%, but you're stuck.  

Final thoughts. 

Only eat here if you can get the Groupon for 58.00.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,8,3,3,Z49F9r58AU5tkUANhIIiVw
