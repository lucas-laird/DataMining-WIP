The first time i went i thought it was great they had shrimp scampi, alfredo sauce, etc but the line was just horrendous. just went again for lunch and it was gross.  Y'know how your first bite is supposed to taste the best?  It already tasted bad.  The liver steak was disgusting; hard, overcooked, and just a peculiar taste in general.  The asian food was gross, mexican food was alright, and the southern style food was just too fried for me.  The only hot food i enjoyed was corn and the mini steakk burger with grilled onions.  However, i did enjoy the fresh salad bar and the ice cream bar.  All the cupcakes and cake had way too much icing on it, and i love icing!",2J1HhwWULZASkyx1wUCAJA,0,0,3,Y72ODywxtfrusjDmQiGrNg
32531,2015-08-09,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,Food was good and lots of variety. Didn't like that they don't have a military discount.  There are a lot of military folks here that could benefit from it and feel appreciated at the same time. Also didn't like that the manager would not honor my sister's medical condition and allow her to take her plate of food home without charging  $5.99/lb. It was like double charging for her food. She could not eat the piece of chicken or the piece of steak that she put on her plate so instead of wasting the food she wanted to take it with her for later. Called the manager over to discuss and show her the medical certificate and the manager refused to let her take it without charging for it again. Otherwise it was good and deserved a higher star for food quality but for the reasons stated I will not be returning until they start to appreciate their military community and take better care of special needs customers.,xNjxB0JRilHp_lNsP-RyuQ,0,0,2,mKYM3aM1_5jOlUnLmOaOrQ

It took only about a good 15 minutes to get in and be seated. Anyways, let's get to the food review. Food was plentiful and ongoing, never had to wait for them to bring it out. Quality was good, service wasn't bad. But...the downside was, most items were extremely salty! Would I go back?

Most regular customers would agree with me that it is one of their signature dishes. No buffets in the LV can come close to the distinct flavors they have created. Unfortunately my latest return to GC has been a disaster! The line was long with just one cashier. But she was quick n efficient. The wait wasn't that long as I might have imagined. But when I was given a table n set to eat. That is where the disaster begins. Trash were all over the serving area. Most of the popular dishes wasn't replenished fast enough. And no one had a clue about the new Scallop BBQ skewers that were suppose to served which advertised on their website n storefront. When I saw lots of people was leaving impatiently. It should have been a red flag for me. But I was just too royal to leave before getting a taste of what I came for.

The problem with his location is the wait. Unless you have a tactical deployment plan with your friends to help secure a place in line, wait until they open another location or you can catch a window of opportunity.

We showed up around 2pm on a Friday, and there was about a 30 min wait.  The weekend prior was roughly about 2 hour wait. 

Once you're actually inside, the line moves quickly.  They also seat you rather quickly as well. 

Typical buffet fare, I think the highlight would be the Grill area and anything that comes out of there. Also the desserts are quite plentiful with various options like Cotton Candy.

I would come back, but not until the hype settles down.",Fv3vlDlAhThO8oIPR8oauQ,1,0,4,X9qNppL3SKDvAcqm7dodLQ

Foods I liked: The pork steak is pretty good but really salty. There is something called the fish...pasa?? Next to some guacamole and pico de gallo. It was good with both. Mashed potatoes and poultry gravy was good, but if you go wrong with mashed potatoes, you might as well quit now. Cookies and cream ice cream!

Foods I didn't like: I stopped eating the orange chicken a few bites in, as well as the lo mein. Their strawberries for the fondue machine weren't very fresh nor big. I was going to put the buffalo wings in the precious category, but they didn't make the cut. I got three pieces because I love wings, but only ate two, and the second was more because I wanted I give it another try instead of wanting to eat more. It tasted a little sour (might be because of the sauce??) and was not warm. Or hot. Little colder than lukewarm. Not cute. Their coffee is mediocre - not good, not bad - but not good enough to make it into the ""likes.""

The tables are pretty cramped, and the soda machine is in the entrance where very one waits to get in. This is pretty inconvenient for people who want refills, but sometimes the servers will stop by and ask if you want one. I just make my brother get refills for me c: they also have a cotton candy machine (not self serve) and a chocolate fondue machine with skewers, marshmallows, cookies, strawberries and Rice Krispies if they haven't run out yet. Feel free to help yourself, but be warned that the chocolate is kind of runny so make sure you're not dripping on the way back to your table.

Basically, the food isn't terrible, but if I want to stop eating while I'm eating...that's pretty bad, especially because I'm not a picky eater.",0Z5pwWSdfUJGtL4fOKuD6Q,1,0,2,P817QNMKagyg9p82Tiar6A

1. The front of the restaurant had a lot of trash...and it wasn't a windy day...first impression.
2. As you walk in you pick up a plastic tumbler for your beverage they are brown and not the color of the plastic brown...stained. They should just buy the brown ones. And the plates should go also...presentation goes along way.
3. No one greeted us and since it was our first time (last) visiting it would have been helpful to be informed of Golden Corrals process. Normally you pay before you get your drink...weird.
4. As we were looking for somewhere to sit...that was difficult because the floor was dirty, rolls stuck in the leg of chair and crumbs at more than one table and around the serving stations (it wasn't too crowded to do a quick sweep)...no one had a roller broom (Wal-Mart is across the street). 
5. Then we had to find someone to wipe off a table, she didn't touch the seat that had crumbs, did it myself.
6. The DEAL BREAKER...we went to the back section by the waitress beverage station to visit with friends. We were HIT with that sour SMELL when a restaurant hasn't changed the water they are using to wiping the tables with for some time...Golden Corral please put a cap full of bleach or   hydrogen peroxide in your water if you aren't going to change it! That smell makes it hard to enjoy your food, our friends has sinus problems that day...lucky for you!
7. Before we could get out of the parking lot we were both feeling sick to our stomachs. Yes we should have ran at the front door, but we were trying to support the community.

375402,2013-04-26,1,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Okay so here's a review for this place:

First off I see a lot of people complaining about the level of children in this place, and to all those defending the kids, yes I totally understand this is a family buffet and there's a lot food aimed towards children, but even as a young adult myself, I also kinda have to side with the complainers here. I didn't have a problem with the level of children, but I DID have a problem with how some of them acted around there, it wasn't even the smallest kids, but kids around 6-10 years old that were the most irritating. I cannot tell you how many times they would just cut in randomly and take food, or touch food and not take it. The worst was when I was about to pick up the utensils to grab the last garlic bread some kid came up and took it with her bare hands! I mean uh parents of these kids can you at least take a little effort in how your kids act when going out? Yes their kids, yes they don't care about others but COME ON, I REALLY don't want your kids touching food I'm about to eat thanks, and I'd also like to grab the food I waited in line to get next, but whatever, it didn't bother me that much to a point where I wouldn't come back solely because of that.

BUT minus the kids, which really isn't too much of a big deal, I really liked this place. They have a really great varieties of food, and most importantly, they know how to do it right! Nothing tasted off or anything you'd expect from a typical buffet. And yes, they do have steaks at this buffet! They aren't the best steaks, but they're still better than most places. I honestly don't think there wasn't one thing I got here that I did not like. 

The best thing about this place for me, which totally made this place ever better was their dessert section! One of the BEST casual buffet dessert places I've been to. The flagship dessert item here is their large chocolate fondue fountain! It is amazing in every way you can dip rice crispy, marshmallows, sugar cookies, and also strawberries! They also have real ice cream besides your typical frozen dairy sludge that melts in seconds, and also which totally took me by surprise, they make cotton candy freshly made! 

Overall, I really enjoyed this place, its so much better than Hometown in every way, the food was excellent, and that's why it deserves 4 stars. The only other problem besides the level of kids, which regardless still won't keep me away from coming back, is their setup when you first walk in, you get your cup and drink before you pay and then you kinda have to stand at the register with a soda that will probably be half finished before you even reach your table. The line wasn't too bad when I got there, about 10 -15 minutes, and for the record, you WANT their to be a wait especially for a buffet! Why? Because that means people are constantly getting food meaning things will be replaced more often and therefore fresh food that hasn't been sitting there under a heat lamp.

The selection looked ok.  I tried the fried chicken which was nothing special. The pot roast was lacking flavor. The sirloin steak was very tough to chew and overcooked. I asked for rare and was given medium. The teriyaki steak was also overcooked. The sauce was ok. The bourbon chicken was tasty and was the clam chowder.  Their salad bar was ok but the tomatoes and onions should have been diced. The side order of lobster tail was a 3 oz tail. This was the best thing on the menu.

530246,2012-11-09,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Yeah, ok, got there just before a hugh line started for lunch.  Dinner is impossible.  Sorry not willing to wait an hours for dinner.  So as far as the food goes, it a little better than Hometown, and the price for lunch $8. and some change was not too bad.
I did notice that breakfast is slightly higher by about .50 cents but still under $9.  Not sure why.

But here's the review on the food.  The steak, which everyone is  supposedly coming here for is a chuck steak, generally about $1.99 per pound in the market, generally we (butchers) make ground beef from this and sell it at $3.99 per pound.  So its tough and chewy.  So when I initially saw it, I was surprised they would be charbroiling it.  I love charbroil, instead of pan or griddle fried.  But not to be disappointed, they threw the cooked steak onto the flat griddle to continue cooking and cutting the steak into smaller strips.
Not only does this double cook the steak to well done, but also make it drier and more tough.  Total waste of meat.  I liked the hamburger sliders, but too much bread for such a small piece of meat (another filler).  The sausage looks good, but tasted like cardboard filler inside,  I didn't like the texture, it didn't taste like a sausage.
The meatball in the spaghetti tasted better than the sausage.  The meat lasagna was also good, but any pasta is again fillers.  Can't go bad with the Fried chicken, but the fried shrimp was more breading than shrimp.  As Chinese food is concern, I wouldn't touch it.  Looks and taste worst than Panda.   Mexican food, look like something from Del Taco, the Carnitas looks extremely fat and greasy.  Too many good and cheap Mexican restaurant in the area to want to go here for mexican foods.  Same with Chinese food too.
Not into salad, if I wanted rabbit food, I would go to Soup Plantation down the street, its cheaper.  
Drinks is expensive as far as soda and selections.  Hometown you can get your own whenever and whatever you want.  Here's it is more limited.  After your initial selection, your waiter/waitress gets your refills.  They are always around but it harder to change your mind since you don't see the machines and the selections.
Dessert is not bad, cookies, cakes, chocolate fountain, fruits, but unlike other buffets which general has only softserve ice cream, GC also serves real scooped ice cream which I prefer.  They also have cotton candy which the kids definitely love.

Would I go back? Yeah, probably once a year.  Its not our my list of favorites.  Just like Hometown.   Just keep your expectations low, and you won't be disappointed.",ofUurEpUr7BBORlQR8qKXA,0,0,3,mjEaKbyL-PKnLywaETDRrw

I was ignored several minutes while standing at the  omelette station by the employee  Eva that was in charge of it . The Manager (Tomas) was also behind the counter  so I asked him, did they make fresh eggs? He replied yes, so I stood there waiting patiently for Eva to ask me what I would like . The entire time of me standing there, she never looked up and gave me any eye contact even after me trying to say good morning and addressing her by name. The next thing I know another employee whom I assume was on their lunch break walked up to the counter. She immediately acknowledged him, start speaking in Spanish and started making  his omelette. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt. I thought maybe she didn't see me so I stood directly beside him. She completed his omelette gave it to him and turned around and walked away.  At this point I realize I was being blatantly ignored, so I turned to look for the manager that I initially saw behind the counter. Before I could say one word  planning just to ask him if Eva spoke English he goes into a rant saying ""we're working here ,working here"" This is a new promotion...I guess referring to the omelette station that I didn't had no idea was new or old . I was in such shock the next thing he said to me was so what kind of eggs do you want? At that point my appetite was ruined I felt disrespected. I looked for my dad who was just about to sit down to eat his food and told him to leave it. Then asked the manager immediately for refund. After realizing his mistake he tried to apologize but was too late. I then name and he just gave me a card with no response I asked his name again and then he blurted out ""Tomas"" this is no was to handle A Dissatisfied customer. The problem would've easily been resolved had he said the station was not open, when I asked him did they make fresh eggs.

http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/golden-corral-opening-las-vegas-207-new-workers

The following Tuesday, the page was revived, and at this writing has two reviews, total.  LVGC, the real one, has its own page (you're on it now)--the heading's only difference is that it contains a phone number--with 38 reviews.

Incredibly, what might have caused the original error was a picture posted on 4/22/12 of GC Industry, somehow slugged ""Golden Corral, Las Vegas, NV,"" unaccompanied by a review.

I waited about 2 months and went back for lunch. Time to get to the cashier was now reduced to 40 minutes, not much improvement in food or service.

After another 4 months I was ready to try again. No line whatsoever at noon - went right to cashier. Food quality is now average (a tremendous improvement), and while service was mostly inadequate I had one server who was quite good. With Vegas being a buffet city Golden Corral is more for locals - I think I can now safely recommend you won't be disappointed - as long as you don't have high expectations. The best part of Golden Corral is that you can choose to eat healthy here - salads, vegetables, etc.

If you want a better Golden Corral (of comparable size) experience, drive down to Lake Havasu City, where there's always an franchise owner on the job - schmoozing with the customers, overseeing operations, and making sure the food is hot, fresh and plentiful.",3IJBR4zpeHtYxzRFuBMCxw,0,0,3,gjQK1jsa-Q8gk77eP7xH_w

I've never seen this before, but you get your drink while you are in line.......before you pay.  Thought that was odd.

We were looking for somewhere to sit.  The downfall for them is they were not clearing off the tables fast enough.  There were so many tables that needed to be cleared off.  After a while, I guess the evening shift checked in and they got to work on the tables.

So many selections for food.  The food that I picked was good, seasoned very well.  During dinner hours, I can understand how it would get so confusing & congested with the lines.  I also noticed they had an allergy alert sign for people who are allergic to nuts.  That was good because that applies to me.  I find I always have to ask when it comes to certain foods.

So what's this place have? All sorts of meat. They also have a salad section, but the workers there look pretty lonely because who craves salad at a meat buffet? The dessert section is also pretty nice. I appreciated the scoop of mint and chip ice cream, and many people partake in the cotton candy post meal. 

Getting down to the nitty gritty: I'm a rib guy, but the ribs were just average here. When an entree is great, you are already planning on getting your next portion while eating your current portion. No such feelings here. 

The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC. One thing about the steak though:  

I don't know if the steak chef is color blind, or if he simply does not give a flying caboodle. On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate. I could swear my plate was mooing back at me.

Also, if you aren't familiar with buffet culture...the clientele can be a little eccentric. If you generally don't see strange people in public, that's because they are all here at GC. 

Yes the quality was better than Hometown. No the quality was not better than a Vegas buffet/Morongo buffet. For the price of entry, I'd say you come out a little bit ahead if you plan your meal right.

Right when I came in, I was pumped, everything looked brightly lit, enticing and delicious.  There were so many stations ranging from breads, to ethnic foods and even a grill station with fresh steaks.  Reason is I was so stoked and amazed when doing a quick survey of what was available was probably because I was comparing it to Hometown Buffet, of which I am a regular patron, and the selection here was certain more extensive.

All I can say is that even though there was a lot of variety, no one thing really blew me away.  Things that stood out was the carved Turkey, Calm chowder, fried Catfish, Bourbon chicken and the steak, which was a hit and miss cause it was usually over cooked and tough.  Other than that, everything was pretty average, but what do you expect for $11.99 a person?

Leonard W and I always see commercials for Golden Corral and even thought about stopping by Victorville next time we head to Vegas, but what do you know, a Golden Corral opens in 626!

We got there around 11:20am and we were greeted with this loooong line out the door.  Turns out this place also serves breakfast so there's a crowd since morning.  The outside portion took a good 20 minutes before we got into the door, thinking that we are getting closer to food, but reality slaps us in the face and the line actually curls a few times like at Disneyland before you head towards the register to pay!  Finally, after a total of 40-50minutes of waiting, we were seated and we began to explore the buffet.

There's a salad station, Mexican, Chinese, Southern, grill station, small seafood section, and a big dessert section.  The standouts for us was definitely the Mandarin Chicken and the fried chicken!  We loved the Mandarin Chicken because it isn't drenched in sauce and they actually stir fry it with Chinese fermented black soybeans!  It adds a different flavor to your normal orange chicken and we ate a ton of those.  

Now, the fried chicken was ridiculously juicy.  Good seasoning on the outside and we thought that only the dark meat was gonna be juicy, but even the breast meat was awesome.

After those two items though, we didn't care too much about the others.  They had pork chops for lunch instead of sirloin steaks.  They also had sliders but a little inconsistent.  Our first sliders were great, but sliders after were all overcooked.  Pizzas, pot roast, chicken fajita, cajun fish, and fried catfish were a few items that I tried and they were all alright.

The weirdest thing on the menu was fried chicken gizzards.  That was... interesting.

Didn't try much of the dessert, but the cookies were extremely buttery (yum) and they got some legit legit mint chocolate chip ice cream!  Of course, there was the famous chocolate fountain but kids were hogging up that area so I didn't bother with it.

Service was a standout.  Our server had this Southern hospitality-quality to him and just from watching him interact with other tables, I can tell this guy is gonna get a lot of tips!

For $8.29, it's not bad at all for buffet.  It doesn't include a drink, so if you add a drink, it costs about the same or a little more than Hometown, and I gotta say, Golden Corral is waaaay better than Hometown.",LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,9,6,3,JNCsOUOXkB0e476pSnYoCA

Well, all I can say is they're lucky the servers were so kind because if they weren't they'd have one star. I got a slice of pizza just because it's tradition for me to get it at buffets and wow! It was completely uncooked? The dough was slimy and was not cooked at all! I was disgusted! Okay, fine. Bad pizza. Not surprising with buffets. So, I go to get some shrimp and bite down on something that feels like a rock. The lettuce was pretty gross and old, so that wasn't very good either. The soups tasted old and everything else wasn't any better. Finally, I got dessert and blegh. Again, everything was stale and old. Very sad. I won't be coming back, but props to the great service!

1368265,2012-08-23,1,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Okay I know I never write reviews about chain restaurants but for Golden Corral, I'll make an exception.

I am writing this review for 3 reasons:

1.  Southern California does have any Golden Corrals, so this is an entirely new experience.
2.  Every time I drove by, there is a line out the door - so it must be good right?
3.  I love buffets.

First off, the wait on a Wednesday night was 45 minutes at 8pm. Talk about a wait.  People are all pushy and stuff in line too. I think people we're all headed the same place, why be rude?  

It's around $12 per person, which is a good price.

So we finally get in and the place is filled to capacity.  I scanned all the offerings and I gotta say there wasn't much.  They had an extensive dessert area but I was more interested in what I was having for dinner.  Off the top of my head, here is what I saw:

1.  Popcorn shrimp
2.  Fried Fish
3.  Steak fries
4.  Pizza
5.  Meatloaf 
6.  Pasta
7.  Ribs
8.  Ham
9.  Salad bar

It was okay quality. The popular stuff was often left empty.  I tried some of the things I listed and it was okay tasting after having to fight with rude folks cutting in line or just hogging everything.

I guess what people really like here is that they offer steak and its supposedly cooked to your desired temperature [which it wasn't].  The portions given were about 1 inch by 3 inch rectangular piece.  I know it's hard to satisfy the masses but having to get up multiple times to piece together a steak got annoying.

The staff was actually really nice. I really don't know how they deal with the crazy, rude and greedy clientele. I think I'd have a headache each and every day I worked there.

All in all, it wasn't worth the wait. It's similar to Hometown buffet.  I'd rather just go to some cheap Chinese buffet locally.",GhnqHTT1vKkLc0Z1rGsQ1A,4,1,2,bFKc7fbI9VwCv2ui1l66Wg

But my favorite thing to eat.. what I have multiple plates of would be... Their yeast rolls. Yessir, YEAST ROLLS. The softest, fluffiest pillows of bread heaven.. paired with their whipped honey butter. I would pay $8 just to get unlimited amounts of that bread. 

Everything else though is A-OK. Nothing special but like I said, a good change from what I am used to. For the price, you can't go wrong. Especially if you end your meal with a big cloud of cotton candy.

1432822,2013-06-28,2,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Ok.  I've read a number of the reviews, and the first thing to say is - why would you go to a buffet and then be disappointed it's a buffet?  I mean. . .duh?
Oh, so your friends/family/someone else's fault dragged you here!  So what?  It's a buffet?  You had a choice, you could have said ""no!""

The first time I went into a modern style buffet (wasn't a Hometown, but same concept), I knew that it had been conceived by a military mess NCO.  This is mess hall food. Food cooked en masse for a lot of hungry people at the same time.  When you cook eggs by the case, you don't get that personal chef touch, so you can't expect that cooked for you taste.  And so it goes for the rest of the food.

The bottom line - if you want a nice, quiet setting, with food cooked to your order, then DON'T GO TO A BUFFET, ANY BUFFET!

As buffets go, this is the best at which I've eaten!

The quality of the food and cooking is better by far than Hometown or any other in So Cal.  The selection is better and wider, and you actually can get steak cooked basically to order.  All you can eat steak, for $14!  It's not Claim Jumper or Outback, but then it's not $35 either. 

The cleanliness is about what you would expect for a place that's constantly filled to capacity most of the day.  So far, each time I've been the seats and tables are wiped off and clean, and the plates, cups and utensils have all been clean.

The negative - well, the only problem I have, and it's the sole reason for four stars instead of five, is that although they make regular announcements over the speakers that children must have an adult with them at all times, they do not station employees to monitor the counters to enforce that rule on all the people who don't monitor their kids.  So small children are often getting their own food, and demonstrating exactly why they shouldn't be.

I even had a small problem yesterday afternoon. It was a minor issue, but the manager handed me his business card with a coupon for a free dinner on my next visit.

My recommendation: if you're looking for a nice sit-down restaurant, go somewhere else - but if you want an all-you-can-eat buffet, this is the best!",WXcyuWLa1MKyLLk93lVslQ,5,2,4,sGf63brvZnAH4exfqB7KxA

In addition to the long line to get into the restaurant, you gotta wait for them to refill half of the food items. I mean, you see tons of people working yet they're not really doing anything. The items at the salad bar was edible. Most of the food items were below average, they were either tasteless or were overly high in sodium. The lighting was harsh and the whole time I felt like I was in a cafeteria.

Tables were placed very closely to each other that there was barely any room for people to walk by. Even the skinniest girl would have to walk sideways and still brush past my shoulder.

The only thing worth praising about was our attentive waitress who seemed to always pop up at our table at the right times: when our half-empty cup needed a refill, when our plates were emptied, when we were done with our meal and she asked if we needed coffee to go with our dessert.

Other than that, I wouldn't give this place a single star if there was an option for that.

~I will start with dessert because this place now has a triple fountain!!! There's the chocolate wonderfall fountain, and they now added a white chocolate falls and a sweet caramel falls. Dessert is fun here!! You dip strawberries, marshmallows, apples, and rice crispies in any of the fountains. The only drawback is that I never have room for any other dessert after indulging in any of the chocolate or caramel fountains, Ugh :(((

Tip: if they run out of strawberries or other items for dipping in fountain, ask them for more! They ran out of strawberries at some point, and I asked one of the ladies in the background to go and put some more! Practically another bucket of strawberries came out after that! 

Now for the real grub (highlights) :

~chicken wings - These literally fly off in seconds (they don't call em' ""wings"" for nothing :P). Keep an eye out for this one because the vultures will be sniffin' around :P

~Fried catfish is good - better than most places out there. The batter actually stays on the fish, and it is crispy too. The fish does not taste muddy at all.

~pot roast - Another popular item here. I went back only to find this empty on several occasions.

~Grilled steaks - you can choose how you want your steak done. However, I didn't exactly get my steak medium rare the first time around. Other than that, it's not a bad steak!

~Fried chicken is decent, and so is the clam chowder.

This is mainly American/comfort food, but there are some Chinese and Mexican items as well. There's also unlimited salad bar, some BBQ items, and the usual kiddie food like pizza.

Kids under 12 are only $5.99 which includes all you can eat real grub, dessert and unlimited drinks. Yes, even the soft drink is included in the price. That is one heck of a great deal. If you have a kid that knows how to take advantage of buffet, then bring em' down! My son can eat!!

Kids 3 years and under are free. Kids 12 and over will be charged adult price. Adult pricing is $11.99, but does not include soft drink. Fountain drinks are $1.99. But that's OK with me and my spouse because we prefer to drink water at a buffet instead of gassy soft drinks, that way we have more belly room to grub!

There's always a line here, and I do mean ALWAYS!!! We actually waited for only 20 minutes, so we got lucky.

The line was really long it took about maybe 20 to 30 minutes to wait in line they do allow you to get a drink while in line which is weird because I thought they would ask you what you want bring it to you and give you the refills each time they come by your table but I had no problem with that as I was thirsty especially being in that long line. As for the price it was fair for 2 people $22.95 the place was packed so half of the time it was hard getting any of the food you wanted. The food though was good not great I adored the fried chicken although it was too greasy from my taste but still good. Pizza was real good it reminded me of shakeys pizza and it had the same quality taste to it the fries were good too almost a step up from fast food fries.  The cheese bread was delicous and the baked chicken was good tasted about the same as the fried chicken so really no big difference from each other.  The dessert was good I got the red velvet cake and they have 4 different kinds of ice cream which is nice I didnt try the chocolate fountain but next time I come here I might give it a go. Other then that this place was good nothing to write home about I would still come back as I enjoyed the food and the customer service which I left out was amazing as the server kept checking on us and asking us if everything was okay I like that kind of service.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,0,0,4,c0y3gbFmf-Yh7w-A18BVgw

When we found out one was here in Vegas, we were happy to go again...but now we will never be back. This place was awful. Pretty much every bowl on the salad bar was dirty and even the cleanest bowl still had food residue. When I went to the station to get a plate and some silverware, the very first fork I pulled out had dried, caked-on food on it. The knives were covered in white film and I it took pulling about about 5 knives each  before my husband and I found some that were clean enough to use. The food was also terrible. When I took a bite of the grilled zucchini, all I could taste was the bland taste of the oil that it was cooked with. The BBQ baked beans tasted scorched. The baked chicken was tough and not very good either. My husband had eggs which he said were tasteless, and he couldn't even eat the biscuits and gravy because it was too salty. If I spend upwards of $30 on a meal for two people, I expect to be able to get clean silverware and food that actually tastes like food instead of oil. My husband said that he was glad that it was just the two of us tonight, not only because the cost would have been much higher, but he would also have been embarrassed to bring our friends to such a sub-par restaurant. We will just stick with going to our favorite buffet at the casino for locals...It's cheaper, the food is much better, and the drinks are free with your meal!",gCh6P_A6t7XbXUdAFkBCzA,2,0,1,79R22BDxgwdj47v0QBwnGw

Luckily, the day we went, the line wasn't bad so our wait wasn't long at all! Prices for lunch is about $9, which is pretty inexpensive for a buffet. I was actually surprised at their food selection - they offered a lot more than I imagined!

Salad bar was fresh, and they have fresh ingredients all lined up like a mini grocery store behind the counter for you to see. 

The hot food was okay - despite some tasty sounding dishes, the food itself was pretty mediocre. Nothing terrible, but you get what you pay for.

Dessert was average too - nothing that stands out... except for the fondue fountain and cotton candy! The chocolate I took advantage of for myself. I'm not a huge fan of cotton candy, but kids go nuts over it! So I took one for my little cousin, and she loved it.

Regardless...you wait in a long line(I'm assuming due to it's cheap price) and you can get a drink...I prefer you not to get a drink because you don't even get to refill it yourself and it's like 1.99 which is alright but flagging down your ""waiter/waitress""just to get you another drink is kinda missing the point of Buffet? Anyway I'm not entirely sure on the drinks price but I think my friend paid around $11 for his lunch and soft drink so sounds about right.

Regardless I don't find any of the dishes memorable as they all tasted either too bland or too salty. I honestly don't know if i can really complain about it cause you shouldn't expect much but yea. The memorable part for me is that dessert you get to have cookies and cream, pecan, and 2 other flavors of ice cream and it's unlimited so that's something to look forward to even though it's not the best ice cream you'll ever taste but it certainly beats having only vanilla and chocolate ice cream all the time.

1555428,2013-04-15,4,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Let me first say we have been looking for a reason to drive up and try this, because we have eaten at several GC's in Nebraska when we go for vacation each year (Omaha, Bellevue and Lincoln locations), and it is really a nice place to eat. We have always been surprised at the selection of fresh fruits, veggies, and nice meat options they had, so we figured the CA location should be better, even yet. We did see the reviews, most of which are not so hot, but, decided we would go check it out, and weigh it against the locations we have been to and enjoyed.

1) SALAD BAR - The leafy items (lettuce, spinach, etc) were mushy, and soaking wet from what i assume was water, but, they ended up being soggy and pretty much not edible(i believe its pretty hard to ruin fresh lettuce, and spinach, isn't it?)...Sad when it was simple salad fixings.....Definitely ZERO stars of 5 here.....HORRIBLE!
2) MEAT/VEGGIE OPTIONS - Although these were not horrible, they were horribly disappointing. By this i mean they were simple, basic, and nothing really special that we couldn't have gotten at other buffets. Sadly disappointing. Maybe 2 stars of 5 here.
3) TASTE- This may have been the biggest disappointment of them all - There were 2 options. One was so salty you could barely stand to eat these items (this was chicken, potatoes, Mexican menu, etc)...Just horribly over salted!, The 2nd option, was bland, tasteless food - Like they forgot to add any seasonings whatsoever?? Again, this would rate a ZERO of 5 stars in my book.
4) CLIENTELE - While you expect some big eaters at these type of buffets, i have NEVER seen so many 200 lb women, and 300 LB Men, eating like a bunch of wild rhinos, like this was the first food the had seen in a week....It was a disgusting site to say the least. Not to mention trying to get to the food with them in front of you, they were scooping, eating, burping, etc...I don't want to make fun of anyone, or be rude, but, what we witnessed here, was a horrible scene, and if i could rate this at a negative, i would.
4B) CHILDREN - I don't mind well behaved kids at a restaurant at all, but, there were kids running wild all over this place while we were there. If you weren't careful turning around after putting food on your plate, there would be a kid running by knocking the plate out of your hands, or they were in the line in front of you touching, and tasting the different items......I listed this as 4B, because a lot of the kids i am talking about, were with the food shoveling adults from #4 above.
5) DESERTS - This is where i would have to give a pretty good rating - They do have a large selection of deserts to choose from. After dealing with most of the negative items above, i didn't try anything, i just wanted to get the hell out of this dump before i barfed. My GF decided she would go have a couple of strawberries dipped in the chocolate fountain - Guess what, not a strawberry to be found, and we are in the peak season right now for fresh strawberries, and they are dirt cheap at all of the local super markets.....Disappointing to say the least.

SUMMARY - We will NEVER go back to this location for as long as we live. We went last Friday at about 11 am, trying to avoid the long lines, and have some fresh menu items, before everyone got there for lunch, but, that plan sadly failed based on the above notes. I was more than disgusted leaving this place on Friday, but, i did want to think for a few days before reviewing. You may think my review is mean, and over stated, but, i assure you this is what we experienced at this location. When we weigh this location against the many locations we have visited in the Midwest, this place would barely rate as a garbage dumpster in comparison.

If you do decide to go here to get your grub on, i would say you will get your moneys worth, if you can stand to sit and eat with all of the issues this place has. I would suggest entirely different management, and possibly many or all different chefs, because this place couldn't have been a bigger disappointment, and this is coming from someone who's first stop after the airport in Nebraska is Golden Corral! All of this was on a weekday at 11 am, so i can only guess what its like during a real rush hour, or weekends.....

My real rating would be 1.5 stars, but, i gave it 2 just to be kind - certainly does not deserve the 2 stars in any way.",2eHr8zDmzMET0pWuWUmHqQ,5,2,2,ibfpcMmCrEz-tYHpgimvmQ
1555797,2012-06-01,4,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Located next to BJ's Brewery Restaurant and Mitsubishi Puente Hills Car Dealership. The parking here was pretty difficult, since this place is still new. Due to the new opening of this place, of course, be ready to wait in long lines. The wait time for me was about thirty minutes, so not too bad. However, once inside, the aroma of all the foods made my tummy rumble. 

Anyways, let's get to the foodie areas:
1. The Greenhouse Area-Spinach (wasn't as fresh...had some dried up spinach in there), lettuce, organic mix, romaine lettuce, various dressings, cucumbers, half sliced tomatoes (very watery...what happened to cherry tomatoes in salads??), cranberries (sweet and fresh), raisins, canned fruits, fresh fruit, tuna salad, coleslaw, southwest salsa (not as good as the pico de gallo), devil eggs,  various soups (chicken and veggie soup...chicken was dry and the vegetables had no flavor), baked potatoes, etc. 
2. The Wok Area-Popcorn chicken, fried rice, orange chicken, fried noodles, egg rolls, etc. 
3. The Grill House Area-Pork chops, steaks (where was it?! Only saw pork chops), kernel corn (not too sweet, but fresh), green beans (tasted like it was from a can), mushrooms, brussel sprouts, carrots, mini burgers (DRY! Hard to devour...and the bread was soggy), fried chicken, buffalo wings, tacos (stale), chips (stale),  tortillas, quesadilla, nacho cheese (spicy con queso was a bit powdery, but enough spice), etc.
4. The Piazza Area-Spaghetti with marinara sauce, spinach and artichoke dip, different pizzas, cheese breadsticks (hard to bite through and too much oregano!), lasagna, pot roast (tender, but dry and no flavor), mac and cheese (watered down and tasted like powder), corn on the cob, meatloaf (tasted ok, the sauce was better than 38 Degrees Ale House and Grill), steak fries, mashed potatoes (watered down and tasted nothing like potatoes...), etc. 
5. The Lighthouse Bay Area-Popcorn shrimp, tilapia (moist and flavorful), fried cod (breading was horrible, the cod was dry too), etc. 
6. The Bread Company Area-Hot and steamy rolls, cornbread (jalapeno cornbread...tasted like cake...not good), and cheese biscuits (dry, but tasted, ok).
7. The Dessert Area-My favorite area! What more can you ask for?! Assortative cookies (chocolate chip cookies was a bit salty), molten lava cake (moist and the chocolate just gushed out), various pies (chocolate pie was horrible..avoid this at all cost!), chocolate fountain (not the best chocolate, but it was ok), rice crispy treats (warm and not stale), brownies, marshmallows, frozen yogurt, hand scooped ice cream (oreo ice cream didn't taste very good, but the rainbow sorbet was great!), and cotton candy (my super favorite, nice and fluffy with loads of flavor)! 

The service here was not great. The table that they sat us with had leftover food and drink stains. They hardly cleared the plates, so they piled up quickly. Sanitation wise...zero. They used the same wipe for everything...

Overall, I would not recommend coming here...Only the dessert area was good...I wish I went to BJ's Brewery Restaurant instead...

Note: It's true what they say...""You get what you paid for."" So my expectations for this restaurant wasn't high to begin with...first and last time I'm coming here.",VDnD3RKPGjIA66cAULW9iQ,4,2,2,g-2x3EOwRYMezkSS_lIdxw

It was maybe about 2pm or so, and we were going to grab lunch. Driving home to Walnut, we see the line wasn't too long. It was about a 30-min+ wait to get to the front to pay and get our drinks (yes, the drink dispensers are at the front before you pay) and not too long, we have a table to begin feasting. Don't worry about refills, the waiter/waitress working your section gets those for you.

I'll give them props for variety, there's PLENTY to choose from to eat here. American food, Asian food, Mexican food... I love the fried chicken here, pretty darn delicious. The garlic cheese biscuits were pretty good too. Want to liven up your boring Caesars Salad? Head to the baked potato section and throw a couple of spoons of chopped bacon pieces! Lol! Bacon makes everything better, right? I like the hush puppies (and I sure miss a local Long John Silvers, sadface). All-you-can-drink horchata and agua fresca de jamaica. The only Asian foods I tried were the fried rice and egg rolls... The fried rice is a disappointment - let me tell you, Panda Express does better fried rice compared to this, and Panda's is a heavily Americanized fried rice. Steaks are cooked to order, and you see people preparing and cooking! Pizza and garlic cheese breads are alright. I love house they made slider mini burgers. I thought the ere pretty dry, the chocolate cream pie was ok, not Marie Callendar's quality. Cotton candy, and the scoop-able ice cream seem to be hits, from long lines. And people can't get enough of that chocolate fountain.

Lunch wasn't too bad for about $8+ a person. Don't let the wait drag you down. If you have a big group, might have to split up to get faster seating. I can say for sure that the food was better than what Home Town Buffet has... They have some serious competition/quality to go against.

I came here today around 2 oclock with my mom because she wanted to see what the restaurant was about since there's always a long line. Thankfully, there was no line around the time i went. Well to begin with, i didnt like the fact that you had to get your own fountain drink before you pay. People were literally shoving me when I was still pumping my soda. As for the price, I paid $8.95 plus $1.99 for my beverage. I was honestly excited about this ayce lunch. When i got my first plate of food, I already knew what I was in for. The food was bland. Popcorn shrimp was okay. French fries were stale, at the same time as being saturated with oil. mash potatoes taste like they came out of a box. friend chicken was alright. The pot roast was probably the best selection i made there. It was soft and flavorful, although there were a bunch of fatty pieces hanging on the meat. The enchiladas tasted plain and it was dry. Really? yelpers are gonna give this place 4+ stars? the food was so bland. everyone was lining up and rushing each other like they havent ate in years. everytime i turned around, i bumped into someone. Oh, that reminds me. The SALAD. what the hell? how can you mess up salad? the lettuce werent dry enough so when i added my dressing, it got all watery. the ranch didnt taste exactly like ranch. it tasted like watered down ranch. horrible. even my younger brother was like ""what the hell, how come this doesnt taste like ranch?"" The dessert selection made it seem like dessert heaven. Too bad it only looked good. It was so sweet. the chocolate brownie tasted off. I dont know, I cant explain it. It just reminded me of the chocolate brownie that they used to serve in middle school. Carrot cake was sweet too. I liked how they had real ice cream instead of the regular soft serve machine. The butter pecan was so sweet, it literally made my tooth ache. I swear, all the desserts were so sweet. After eating it, I sipped my soda and I couldnt even taste it anymore. the cotton candy was hard. i was the first one to grab one when the lady put fresh cotton candy up. i ripped a piece off and had to tug on it like a mothereffer.   its supposed to be soft and melt in your mouth isnt it?!?! i cant even explain how much i regret coming here. after i left this place, i got a massive headache, probably from all the damn sugar i ate. everything in here is NOT healthy. i shouldve gone to olive garden. overall, this place sucks. its a knockoff version of home town buffet.

I am not a fan of ""All you can eat"" restaurants. I hate Hometown Buffet and Sizzler. I barely even like Vegas buffets. The reason why I don't like buffets is either the quality sucks or it's way too expensive.

Well, Golden Corral wasn't that bad. For the price, the quality is pretty good. The price is roughly $10 or less and there's a variety of the usual buffets foods like meats, pastas, breads, mac n cheese, etc. But the quality is pretty good considering you are only paying $10 or less. Their desserts are really good too. They don't have your typical vanilla/chocolate soft serve but instead it's even better! They have cookies 'n cream and hazelnut ice cream! 

The lines are long but if you are hungry and patient, it will be worth it at the end. 
I don't plan on coming back in a regular basis. As mentioned, I don't enjoy buffets much. I rather eat elsewhere and get better quality foods.

It wasn't anything too special or too great. Overall, it was moderate to me.

Likes:
- The variety of food that they have, much more than any other buffets I've been to. They have foods from Chinese, Italian, American, Dessert, Salads, Fruits, etc.
- Cotton candy! Brings back childhood memories haha
- The ice cream section was pretty neat because you can actually pick from 6 flavors & they have an employee that scoops for you

Dislikes:
- Although there was a lot of variety, they were all pretty bland & flavorless to me.
- The pasta was OKAY... not enough flavor
- The steak was pretty tough, hard to get it down my throat (don't get dirty.....)
- The mini hamburgers were cute but the meat was pretty burnt, so I felt as if I was eating charcoal :\

Both times, there was a line extending out the door, and it took about 30-50 minutes to get to the table. As for the food, my favorite is their tropical sauce steak, and grilled to order steak. Medium rare ftw. Their lasagna and meatballs are top picks, also. 
They have a mexican section, italian, asian, salad, meat, dessert. Good guac and salsa, I don't recommend the asian dishes, italian was nice. 
I know it's stupid to have fries and fillers at a buffet, but man their fries are good! 
Super thick and scrumptious with ketchup. 
Their pot roast is way too salty.
Moving on to dessert, their watermelon and fruits are almost always empty. 
Chocolate fondue! Its decent, the strawberries were pretty rotten at one point, gross.
They should get bananas. 
The usual super sugary pies, and cakes, cookies. 
Nice ice cream, bad fro yo. Tasty banana cream pie. 

A nice part about Golden Corral is the service. All the waiters were nice, and attentive. They offer complimentary dessert and coffee, refill quickly, and take your plates away with a smile. (:

anyway, the food is okay, there is a line for pan-fried/grill fish. and their steak was whatever.. everything here is average or below average...

my friends raved about this place and i had really high hope for it. and of course i was disappointed because there is a line everywhere and the food wasnt as great as expected

i think my review for this place is biased because i was expecting a lil too much for a $10 buffet. i've been wanting to go back and give it a try one more time",vAHGr1t-syGFnmEZWHLKJA,0,0,3,oUYjobgRMJ5ZrT9clPSI8A
1611764,2017-04-24,1,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Went here on Sunday 4-24-2017

Went with my family and parents.

First stop was the ice machine you get your drinks when you walk in. Big clump of brown ice fell into my cup. I remember ice machines are one of the worst things restaurants neglect. Bad sign off the bat. 

Food was okay. Didn't have anything particularly bad. Sat in the back so we could be in a booth. The restaurant was very busy.

Service was friendly and dining area was moderately clean. 

There was an altercation between two females near our table. Lots of yelling and cursing. My baby was asleep so it was just an annoyance. Other families got up and relocated due to the foul language. Others stepped in to diffuse the situation. The servers stared at each other dumbfounded. It was apparent they had no instruction for this type of situation. Bad management. 

The second time the yelling started the servers took notice and decided to ask? what was wrong. Still no management to speak of. Finally a supervisor came over and just stared from afar hoping the situation would not escalate. I commented that the management would do nothing as they did nothing to that point. The yelling subsided and everyone dispersed. 

The third time one of the females came back and started yelling. A group got up and migrated to the middle. Drinks, food, and even chairs were thrown. There was mass hysteria. The female was getting jumped by three others and being pummeled. A few employees stepped in but for the most part the patrons broke up the fight and separated the group. It was only then did I see a sleepy looking manager waddle out from the back. He had a bewildered look on his face as if he was upset to be summoned.

My parents had their backs to the altercation but were terrified. At first chance we evacuated the restaurant. My mother was literally shaking. My baby woke up during the fight and didn't have a chance to eat. It was an awful experience. After it settled down I expected assurance from management, they didn't bother to address their diners. The original people that threw the fist punch continued eating. It was a disgusting display of poor management and apathy. I didn't want to eat there to begin with but rest? assured we are done going there. 

*On a side note. The food wasn't awful. Steak was pretty good. Everything else was mediocre. For the price I'd rather of gone to a casino. Also my server was great. She was actually one of the few employees that jumped in to stop the fight. 

TL;DR dirty ice, people got in a fight and management did nothing, food was okay, my server was great",A26nJ0dRzTfToH9Dd4087Q,1,2,1,EpnCbttRv9-SPaJdpFgTSg

1618654,2013-04-15,4,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Well, first of all to all that complain about the place; get real and pull your head out of your asses, you are entering a southern style $12 family buffet. It is a FAMILY buffet, of course there will be kids roaming around. Don't want kids roam around in a buffet? Then dont go to a buffet!!! How hard is that to understand? Second, this particular place is the only golden corral within 100 miles. Feel free to drive to bakersfield or outside san diego if you dont want to wait in line! Also, it is a buffet, people can do what they want when they are waiting for the table (eat if they want). To the crazy lady that says this will spread germs, How will this spread germs? Are they picking out food with their hands? Or are they eating with their hands after pick out food with a tongue? To the guy that expect perfect steak that you ask for; you are asking a grille guy that is cooking 30-40 steak at one time. Some times he gets it right, some times he doesnt big deal?! If you want steak cooked right, buy a grille, get some usda choice steak from costco and cook it yourself! 


Now onto the reviews after ignoring the haters.

I have been here three times and it has never dissapoint. You learn to give the waiter/waitress more time as it is a busy place. My suggestion is to visit during the week days and NOT WEEKENDS if you dont want to wait an hour in the line.

Food: i will only talk about why people come here, which is steaks. i am a steak guy, you learn to ask the guy for the steak you want instead of for him to find one for you. Keep in mind this is buffet steak, not your expensive restaurant sitdown steaks. Over cooked or under cooked? Ask for a new piece instead writing stupid review like some negative reviewer here. 

The other must have would be the texas style toast! Absolutely awesome and reminded me of the great toast i had in Houston once.

As for the rest of the food, it is for you to find out what you like.

Tips: want to save some bucks? Go in before 4pm for early dinner and you can pay lunch price and still have steaks after 4pm.",QSiE8Lu_ILRCEGdq0LnkHA,3,2,4,PJGv-eZVY1EaT98xHiMK6A

It took about 15 minutes to zigzag through the line, which is pretty good considering we got there at 5 pm, and we were seated within a minute after paying at the register.

Our server Thomas was fantastic, cleared the used plates quickly and kept the drink refills coming without having to be asked. The lines for the food were very reasonable, and the food quality was very good. The fried chicken was surprisingly good, very moist inside and crunchy outside, not all dried out like some other buffets serve. All in all, it was a very good experience.

My only hope is that they do well enough to realize that they would benefit by opening a few more locations here in Vegas, as it's honestly a bit of a burden for those of us who live on the west side of town to fight the traffic to get there.",w5p02wAC5NXh0iwV2zHvSQ,3,1,4,Ehpl8gIWO05LWk-UkI15Ew

The lines here are freaking ridiculous. I happened to stop by here once on a weeknight after shopping with my family at around 8:30PM. There wasn't much of a line, so we were able to try this place out. 
The next few times we tried coming with more family members on a weekend...just ridiculous. The line goes out through the door. If you didn't know, you'd think it's Black Friday again. 

This place is slightly better than Hometown Buffet, so I'm giving it three stars instead of two. I'm basically comparing this to other American buffets, not those Chinese ones littering the region. 

I drove by once when it was raining. Guess what? The rain doesn't deter people from coming to this place: people lining up outside, drenched in water, waiting to dine at this place... It's not like the Dalai Lama is dining here. If he did, he would've gone to Souplantation instead. He's a monk after all. 

I suggest coming here either very late or very early. It's not worth waiting for an hour or more. This is just a good place for a once or twice visit, not a place to frequent.",q-oO2CHizwlU2f1HO9FrHw,1,0,3,iy7FyEyMGyZL2b69p2POMA

1665758,2013-06-26,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"I spent a few years in the south (FL/GA/SC), Golden Corral has always been a favor for me when I am craving for fast, cheap and AYCE southern comfort food. Once, or even twice a week is normal for me.

After returning to Cali, I have been craving Golden Corral for as long as I can remember. Before this one, which I can safely say is the ONLY one in the entire LA-basin opens, I have to either go to Victorville or across the border to Kingman, AZ to get a fix.

Before you continue reading my review, I'd like to state I am limiting my review on few items that I consider Golden Corral signature items. I will somehow briefly touch on the other subjects as well to make this review as fair as possible.

I went to the buffet on a Sunday afternoon, as soon as I arrived in the parking lot and saw the line, I actually turned around and went ""LOL NOPE"", then head home. 48 hours later, I was there. No line outside the establishment, nor any waiting inside as well. To put it bluntly, try to visit if on a weekday before lunch/dinner rush if possible.

Most patrons found the drinking fountain provided before you even pay is intriguing. However please be aware, in the south when it's hot and humid outside, the first thing you want to do as soon as you step into a Golden Corral is to grab a cup, fill it with ice and sweet tea, chug it down and sigh in relief. As for the tea they provided at the fountain? I can say it's pretty close to what they provide in the south.

My first plate include southern style cabbage (how much I wish it was collard green), pot roast, mac&cheese, corn bread and some fried chicken pieces in different sauces. The only thing that was close to what I had back in the south was the pot roast and the cabbage. I was very disappointed with the corn bread. I guess it's just difficult to make southern signature item in Cali. Mac & Cheese was alright, and the fried chicken pieces were actually pretty good.

My second plate consist of meat loaf, fried okra, chicken wings (which they advertised on TV), bourbon street chicken over rice. The meatloaf is slightly better than what Hometown Buffet offers. The chicken wings? Well, I'd avoid them. Not they are bad but the fried chicken pieces I had on my first plate was WAY better. The fried okra... I can tell the okra was frozen then thawed improperly before frying. As for the bourbon street chicken? All I can taste was salt and seasoning. No flavor was detected at all.

My last plate had a piece of fried chicken drum stick, more cabbage, a piece of fried catfish and a hush puppy. The fried chicken is pretty much spot on, except too salty. As for the catfish? Surprisingly decent. It is going to be frozen fish but they were able to keep the flavor and the seasoning identical to what they offer in the south. The hush puppy? Well, it was sick as a dog, in a bad way.

I didn't had any dessert. I know even though the offers are pretty close to their counterparts in the south, but for sure they were baked back there. So I skipped the dessert all together.

The biggest problem with most of the food there is WAY TOO MUCH SALT. I'm aware the southern cooking are ""heavy"" compare to the rest of the country, but the amount of salt and sodium in the dishes are just way too overwhelming. 

Yes there are kids there, they do run wild, but as some of you said, it's an affordable family buffet, kids are going to be present for sure.

As for the size of the restaurant? It's about average of other Golden Corrals, at least the ones I've been to. Oh and their layouts are almost identical.

Services? Please, give the servers a chance. They have very limited walking space and clearance to work with, while avoiding running into their fellow coworkers and patrons, as they trying to clean up plates and refill drinks as fast as they can. Treat them as how you want to be treated.

Cleanness? It's par. I'm sure the health inspector will frown upon certain things, but you can't expect it to be spotless when there are nothing but constant foot traffic. They do trying to make it clean though. Notice the hand sanitizers at dish stations and a wrist-hook at the restroom doors.

Hype? Well there are some hypes associated with Golden Corral. Then again being the only one around and offers a great price, it's going to be busy.

Bottom line, this Golden Corral is below the par of other Golden Corrals. However compare to other chain buffets? It still kicks the other places in the groin with the price-to-food ratio.

Will I go back again? Only when I'm craving some cheap southern comfort food.

If you want something different with your buffet offerings in the LA-basin, give it a try. Pick a off-peak day and time, and try some southern stuff, instead of the other dishes other places are making (if not better) as well.

The only thing that's missing is the hot and humid thick air brushing against your face when you walk out.",N7dQCxjrZDb0KS6hfAsULA,3,0,3,hZoFzJjs02ytoLuIS0gA9A

They have a huge selection of foods that range from Mexican to American and stuff in between. 

Nothing I tried really stood out to me other than the steaks that were made to order. That was I think the highlight of my whole meal. I like how you can choose how you want it cooked and it was not tough like some steaks. 

Honestly it's better than going to a hometown buffet and the reason we chose this place cause there's always a bunch of people and for trying it out it was okay.

We first tried a Sunday night around 6:30pm and there was about 1 hour wait and decided to come back on Thursday night at 6:30pm and there was a 30 minute wait.  

For a little less than $12 for dinner, (no drink) it's okay.  Yes its one notch better than Home Town, but they're not that hard to beat.  It is busy so you have to be careful with bumping into kids especially.  Some parents allow their kids to run full speed through the restaurant.  

When we got in, they did a quick wipe down of our table but they needed to use better table wipes cause it reeked a bit.  With the heat and amount of people in our section, ventilation was also not that great, which had a little bit of that smell you get when you're waiting in a DMV.  

As for the food, they don't know how to cook steaks.  My med-rare was med-well.  They just cut slices off the grill not letting steaks rest... which loses all their juices.  It's a sirloin so probably doesn't matter anyways.  
Pork ribs are a huge hit or miss.  Don't get the end pieces because its pork jerky, very overcooked.  Only the center bones are descent.  
Fried fish, onion rings, and chicken noodle soup were way over salted.
I liked their fried chicken...then again I just like fried chicken almost anywhere.
I did enjoy the salad and fruit area, which probably isn't anyone's purpose to coming to this place.  Watermelon was sweet and freshly cut.
Hand scooped ice cream was a bit on the sweeter side for me.  
Hand spun cotton candy was nice.  I can't remember the last time I've ever had that.

1741903,2014-01-05,1,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"I just visited this newly opened location yesterday. I used to love going to the golden corral in marysville washington, when I lived there, so I decided to try this newly opened location. The line of people waiting to get in was almost wrapped around the building. In the parking lot, I had to dodge sticky messes everywhere such as discarded half eaten ice cream cones, and cotton candy. The place is only just opened and the parking lot is all sticky and filthy. Nice. had to wait 40 minutes to get in door, and another 20 minutes to get to the cashier. The atmosphere was overcrowded and unpleasant. The cooks could not keep up with the demand from the hungry animal customers, and most serving pans(troughs) were either empty, or running empty. my wife got a piece of fried chicken which was raw and uncooked on the inside. (apparently the cook did not leave it in the frier long enough. The food was mostly not that good.
   One thing that annoyed me was that every 2 minutes a server would be hounding me with questions like ""is everything alright? can I get you anything? 
  Some might consider that to be good customer service, but I like to be left alone to try and enjoy my meal. I dont like having 2 or 3 servers constantly hovering over me while I eat. After the 10th interruption , I finaly got a bit rude, and said go away already. 
  Another thing that kind of sucks is that they charge you an extra 1.99 per drink, on top of the buffet price. I can go to several buffets where the price is 7 to 9 dollars and the drinks are included. The servers at other buffets do their jobs, and for the most part, and leave you alone to enjoy youre meal. If you plan on going to this place, one way to beat the system is just bring youre own bottled water.

2 for $20 after 4 pm on Mondays to Thursdays. Oh lord. Someone save me from myself. When I first stepped in I saw a huge buffet, much bigger than Hometown which is comparable, but I think Golden Corral definitely has the edge.

There is better quality meat and food, and the desserts are also pretty good for what they are as well. I love the cotton candy. They also get great fatty points for the Horchata. Service is good, and the place is fairly clean as well.

1767136,2013-09-02,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"It probably could have been a good experience if the place wasn't such a zoo. I mean, having lots of customers isn't a bad reflection on a retaurant, but at a buffett, it really puts a damper on things when you have to wait in line for every helping of food. And I went at 4 in the afternoon on a weekday! I waited maybe 15 minutes just to get in; when I left, the line was much much longer. Not to mention, with so many people, it was really loud (not in a fun TGI Fridays way), an it was hard just to move around (which you have todo a lot of, since it's a buffet).

The food was comparable to the median quality of Hometown Buffet; I've gone to HB and had better food at times, and worse at others. In other words, not terrible, but not that good. They had some special offerings (pan-seared seafood and steak), but if my experience is representative of the norm (which according to many reviews it is), you probably won't get to try them. This is because they make just one small pan at a time, each one taking several minutes. It' like you get the worst of both worlds: you have the wait of a sit down restaurant, except it's a buffet so rather than sitting at your table and having someone bring it to you when it's ready, or even having a number called, you just he to stand in line while they cook and hope you'll be able to get some.

The one thing waiters do bring is your drink, and as one reviewer said (it may have been on Google Reviews), you practically have to beg for a refill. Seeing as how you're at an AYCE buffet full of salty fried food, having them more on top of refills (or having self-serve drinks like Hometown Buffet) would be a big help.

Overall, I had a very unhapy experience. I would like to try this Golden Corral again sometime, but I am hesitant. Some things can be improved (drinks being self-serve or at least refilled reliably), but if there is never a time at dinner (lunch has limited menu) where the line isn't out the door and the place more like a corral than a restaurant, I'm not sure what can be done short of opening a second one nearby.",18HLzNNJVmbYKGVsIsGY5A,0,0,1,LLOuCXWqxtEV9OF_Igdtsw

We've been bombarded with commercials, but we haven't had one of these places any closer than Hesperia.  Of course people are going to want to rush the place when it's new.  The same thing happened when a Sonic finally opened in Duarte.

Anyway, I have absolutely no complaints about the food.  The steak was on point!  The service was great for the amount of people present.  I sampled a little bit of everything, but I think the shrimp and steak alone are worth the wait.

...now let me address a few other things. How the hell are you going to complain about endless steak?!  ""Oh, it's too greasy....oh, it's too fat."". Your cheap ass came here for the Ultimate 2 for $20, and you know it.  If you want a better cut, go to Houston's or Ruth Chris or something.  Pay that ridiculous price.  Also, the decor...who cares?  Come on, it's a buffet, not an art gallery....or maybe you prefer the Norman Rockwell pieces at Hometown Buffet.  Lastly, don't judge the crowd.  Yeah, I admit, there were a lot of cholos and hynas present, but everyone seemed so polite and patient.  Nobody got ghetto in line or inside.

I really enjoyed the food and my experience.  I will definitely be returning...maybe after the lines die down a little.",I8PZaI5b1d4XJmIjZ0kVnQ,5,3,5,-1PO-ZwadKkBukgosa3--w
1821118,2012-08-06,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Ever since this place opened up, the lines have always extended all the way out pass the door. So I was never able to give this place a try.  That was true, until a couple of days ago. My siblings and I finally decided to give this place a chance and see what all the hype is about. When we arrived, we were happy to see that the line wasn't long!

Before paying, you have to get your drink first which I felt slowed down the line. We grabbed our cups and my sister's cup had a lipstick stain on it!!! That's disgusting and makes me wonder how well they wash their dishes. She told one of the employees about it  and the employee had nothing to say. Not even an apology. We reached the cashier and she charged all of us with senior discount by mistake. A mistake we only caught after we had already paid. We were led to our seats, and the first thing we noticed was the foul odor coming from the area where the employees refill drinks for you.  The odor made our experience eating here so much more worse. 

The food here is extremely mediocre and salty. Listen up folks, if you have diabetes, or high blood pressure you better run for the hills because this place puts a whole lot of salt  in their food and a lot of sugar in the desserts. And for those who continue to eat here, you better be careful!  I am disappointed by the quality of the food. With this buffet, it's quantity over quality. It's not about how good the food tastes, but  how many plates you can eat. I honestly could not finish the food on my plate because it was THAT bad. 

Take my advice, don't waste your time or money here! It is spent better elsewhere. I know, ""You get what you pay for."" but that doesn't mean the food has to taste terrible.  The only reason I even gave this place any stars is because of the senior discount.  I would not come here again!",rR2JEjY10nSC_D-LIKSaKA,7,0,1,7HF_kFR-582fNEsnTML8-w

1883261,2012-09-10,1,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"We decide to give this place a try as we always saw these ridiculously long lines whenever we passed by.  I didn't expect much after reading all the Yelp reviews and the price is cheap for all you eat. We came at 11:00 am on a Sunday and waited about 1/2 hour to get to our table. The place was packed!  Price was 12 for food, $2 more for a drink and $2.48 for a to go cup. 

I have to say the salad bar is pretty good.  It doesn't have the variety of salad toppings like Souplantation but definitely a decent selection. They just don't have iceberg lettuce only, there is spinach and mixed greens. They have grilled chicken to top your salad. So you can get a healthy meal here. 

The cooked food was overall okay. I got the steak which was too dry and no flavor. The ribs were okay. The enchiladas were decent. 

The desserts were good. I liked their cookies and cream ice cream and the cotton candy. I didn't try the chocolate fondue as I was afraid that kids may have stuck their fingers in there.  

Service was good overall, many hard working people, but they have a couple of bad apples in the bunch. 

The only major change they need to make is how you get the drinks. You first get your drink right before you pay, but the ice was falling on the ground as people were getting sloppy. Then if you a refill you have to get a server get it for you.  They should have a drink dispenser got customers to get their drink.",OJqyJUK3QfRdcHCWI5njjg,2,1,3,ziX9hquMZcMhMi3WzpPl0A

You are complaining about the line too? REALLY.  ARE you that SPECIAL that WE arn't allowed to come so you don't have to wait in line REALLY!  Wondering why the line is so long and redonkulous! They've been advertising GOLDEN CORRAL on TV for soo long and we have all checked to see where is it and the nearest one was in Hesperia (on the way to vegas).  I don't know about you but the service i received was top notch even though I came on a Saturday and yes I've waited for 2 hours! And yes I've waited in line for steak (cooked the way you wanted) BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT SPECIAL THAT THE RESTAURANT would restrict the amount of people coming in just because you do not want to wait in line.   Just like any buffet there are it's pros and cons. AND HOW DARE YOU OR HOW CAN YOU COMPARE THIS TO HOME TOWN BUFFET OR EVEN SAY HOMETOWN BUFFET IS BETTER.  For the most part it is a open kitchen you get to see what the chef is cooking.  Everything is pretty clean considering they were running at maximum capacity.  The Grill was the best part. You get to see the open flames in front of your eyes while you chose the cut of steak you want, fried chicken was good too.  I'm not a very picky eater sooo everything that i have tried was pretty good to decent to me. NOTE AND REPEAT THAT I'VE TRIED. THAT MEANS I HAVEN'T TRIED EVERYTHING!  Shrimp was good not over cooked just perfect.  The dessert ahh the DESSERT! COTTON CANDY, Chocolate FOUNTAIN, HAND sCOOP ICE CREAM REALLY YOU STILL THINK HOME TOWN IS BETTER?  I MUST BE A FAN BOY no i'm not im just speaking the truth.  1 star docked off for food being a little bit too salty along with some dessert for being ultra sweet.  (i havent had the salad bar yet)  1 star docked off for the salad bar being too healthy (im just kidding) now you see how redonkulous some reviewer sound like? 

Other notes
If you buy soda you fill up your own soda in the front and bring it with you to your table. the waitress/ waiters will refill your soda.  
The workers eat where the customers eat it didn't but me bug it might bug others.

1924399,2012-05-29,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"So I went to this place for the first time with my wife on 05/26 in the evening. I usally go to Home Town buffet. Before I start, I would like to mention that I can't eat any meat (except seafood).  These are my true and honest findings;
-- The wait time from the moment I got in the line to when we are actually seated was 1 hour and 15 minutes!!!!!! No, I am not joking!
-- Place is extremely busy and kind of congested inside at some of the ""hot items."" Watch out for running kids, people walking extremely fast with plateful, and the going crazy looking servers.
-- Forget about someone picking up the phone to give any information probably because they are so busy I guess! Do all your findings before you go!
-- The dinner buffet was $11.49 per person. Drinks not included. Extra $1.99 for drinks or $2.49 for an upgraded drinks. Kids under age 3 eat free but limited to 2 per family! To go boxes are available for $4.79/lb.
-- When you enter inside, you will see glasses, coffee mugs, 32 oz. cup, small size paper cup, soda fountain, some specialty drinks etc. right before you pay. This is extremely confusing and not so right design/concept. People coming in after long wait outside getting confused on if those drinks are free or what. If not free, then some of us (not reading the price board yet) are thinking if it will be covered in the buffet price. If not then some of us are thinking if this is the only chance we have to decide if we want soda and if so, the only chance to take it otherwise we will not be allowed later!
-- It is at the register you realized that those sodas are not free, they are extra, and the upgraded soda of $2.49 is for the 32oz. soda cup. The reason for extra charge is that you can walk out of the place having full cup of soda compare to the other regular glass soda price whic you can't take!
-- The main grill place (hot item) where they are serving steaks, chicken, seafood items is right when you enter inside after payment. Now that is where it is extremely congested and crowdy. Poor design I think!
-- The chocolate fountain, cotton candy, and the ice cream, another hot item place, is also situated at very congested and crowdy place. This is because it is where the plates and utensil station, also located for that side of the restaurant people. 
-- Floor and even some of the tables were very dirty. Restroom was OK in terms of cleaning aspect. 
-- Almost half of the dished doesn't have name tag on it! This make people like me extremely hard to know which items might have meat in it or not. Yes, there are people behind the counter to ask but they look extremely busy and had to ask twice or even thrice for them to answer.
-- The Asian guy at the seafood is extremely rude and unfriendly. Watch out for him. I wish I noted his name down. Anyways, it is confusing at his station because the instruction board says to choose between Tilapia or Shrimp., choose sides, and then finally the sauce. For a newbie like me, I thought I have to say all this to this rude chef. Later, I realized that his job is just to give you the meat part and then right next to his station is where all the sides are, again, without any name tag on it!
-- Some of the items were fresh and some of them aren't. 
-- Only few Chinese cuisine choices.
-- There should be more fruit choices other than strawberry as well as pound cake needs to be available to dip.

Overall, I wasn't too impressed and not sure if I will come back again!

A herd of hungry people, food on the floor, food on the tables, lines for MORE food. Don't expect a peaceful meal. This place doesn't cater to that. Cheap prices and plentiful food. No wonder Golden Corral opened up near Rowland Heights. Asians love these gimmicks! =P

And with all that being said, the food quality here was good and the desserts were very plentiful. Not your standard buffet desserts. 

Steak, sausages chicken etc. All the poultry and seafood (fish and shrimp)  were pretty fresh. The fried shrimps were huge! The breads were great too. I didn't want to fill up on those, but the cheese biscuits and the corn bread was delish. Dessert! Pies, cupcakes (red velvet!), bread pudding, chocolate fountain, cotton candy, ice cream, soft serve, whoa.... And the workers kept pumping these out. Fresh. 

My only real complaint is the layout. The station with all the meats (the most popular) was right by the entry way where people were paying and waiting for their dining tables. Sooo crowded with the lines and the people walking through. There really should be more room. Especially if people are carrying plates of hot food. 

Save your calories and drink water. I think you can ask your server for a glass of water once you reach the table. Golden Corral tries to lure you to purchase a drink since the drink dispensers are right next to the cashiers. I got the sweet tea. And it was sooo watered down. Drinks are $ 2.50 and is added on top of your dinner price.

Definitely got bang for my buck here. $10.50 for an adult at dinner (not including drink)! Service was nice and helpful. Even with the chaotic environment.",ZjTzwlXBbg6-I4vtXTLHHQ,6,3,3,SDnwURBhhvMlIsISMCUl4w

We get in and pay, it's kind of annoying that you can't just freely get drinks while you eat. You have to get your drink before the check out and they refill it for you at the tables which sounds like a good idea but service was so bad.

There was an Asian station, a Mexican station, Seafood? The Grill, and possibly an Italian station? There was also a small breakfast selection where I got some crispy and delicious bacon. 

The line for the The Grill was long, because they are serving up steaks. You don't even get a whole steak, just a small piece and they are stingy with the pieces. I was really disappointed in the steaks because they were soooo gristly. The whole bottle of steak sauce could not give this steak flavor. I had a baked potato and a small salad and was done.

Granted, there is a lot of variety of food and can cater to many different tastes, though not sure about that Asian section, but overall the food was okay. Nothing in particular stood out. For a group of 14, they were quite accommodating and the wait was not too long.

Parking was okay, because our dinner time was around 8 pm on a Saturday. Once the line heads into the door, there actually is another ""s"" like shape before you get to the cash register. But before you get there, they do have a drinking fountain and etc set up, which I do find quite odd because there are no instructions as to whether or not the clear cups are for fountain drinks only or if they can also be used for water. A lot of us had never been here before so that confused us quite a bit as some people only wanted water and no soda. We ended up just using the cup and filling it at the water station near the cash register. The tap water did have this weird taste to it, I guess it is because it really is ""tap"" water. If you want a refill of anything, you'll have to flag down your waiter, which can be quite taxing at times. 

I only went for the mid-section of the buffet which consisted of corn, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, fried shrimp, steak, and etc. I did not go anywhere near the salad or the Asian section. The dessert section did have a lot of variety and it's nice that they have a ""baker's corner."" The fountain section was a bit confusing as there were barely anything laid out next to the fountains in which we can use. The lines also were sometimes confusing as people would line up at certain areas only (steak) or etc. The plates also were not very clean, I could feel some grim on there. Overall, I do not think I would ever come back here again. Definitely not worth the wait. The workers were really nice and our waiter was very attentive!",WySpcMX0PnyFl6nf1HZ-pQ,1,1,3,dsbkM7X0gliNc6uM5acRYg

It cost us around $120 for 7 of us to eat at dinner time. Definitely going back. The only reason why I am giving 3 stars is because of the issue below. I went here on a busier day. At the table next to us was a larger family and by the time they were done saying good byes 3 children were on the ground literally rolling around. There wasn't a server in that area for quite sometime that I noticed. On their way out the children were still on the ground and rolled out the section before the mother attempted to pick them up. This is a total liability, someone could have really gotten hurt. I get it, it is not fine dining and the parents should have kept a closer eye on their kids but the servers/management should have kept a closer eye.

First of all, parking isn't a problem, plenty of lot room. I'm surprised why they didn't just expand the restaurant and use up some of that parking lot room.

Food wise, home town buffet would be crying. This gave me a slight memory of vegas buffets but I personally felt the quality wasn't all there.

First time to a GC & was pleasantly surprised.  Everything was really fresh & flavorful.  The ambiance is better than Hometown as it is bright & colorful.  I loved that there were people manning the stations instead of someone running around to refill the food.  It feels like an extended Souplantation.

Here are some highlights of the meal:

Fried chicken was perfectly fried & flavorful
Fried okra was really yummy
Cotton candy was fun to eat
Sweet tea is good but a lil too sweet
Mini slider was perfectly charred

I will say that it's good value for money...I mean, $10 and you can eat pretty much anything, including steak?  Yeah, even the old fat kid in me approves of this.

The quality of the food is slightly better than Hometown Buffet, and there definitely are more options.  But for all the hubbub about the steak, I didn't think it was particularly impressive.  Guy cooking it doesn't even know how to cut it.  In general though, the food is good for a buffet and I have no complaints.  Also not a fan of how they structured the steak line...it's pretty much right in the middle of the seafood section.  Can get confusing.

Their dessert bar was awesome, they had 6 different flavors of ice cream, chocolate fondue with strawberries, frozen yogurt, cookies, and pies.

Yes, the line is ridiculously long (we waited an hour) on the weekend and probably wouldn't have stayed in line if it wasn't my niece's b-day.  You're best bet is to go on a weeknight.

Food: imagine Hometown Buffet but way better. from the looks of thing everything here is super fresh as in they make it themselves. from the bread to the pasta. I would recommend getting the steak first cause if its busy, which is an always, then there will be a long line but the line moves pretty quick so no worries. and plus they have a freak load so don't worry about them running out of steak. their soups are pretty good too. i myself like clam chowder and this is some good chowder. Fresh bread every so often. everything seems like its cooked on the spot.

Oh and their dessert is pretty darn good. its not something to talk about but hey they got their own chocolate fountain so that's a plus. and they also have ice cream too which they scoop for you so you know that no kids or adult would be sticking they nasty ass fingers in them

oh and their drinks are not self refillable. you have to ask your waiter/waitress to refill them. that's OK. 

Service: i got to say for a busy place their service is pretty darn outstanding. our waiter introduced himself very kindly. Very attentive. since its busy it was a bit hard getting his attention but we did get his attention so that's a good thing. They cleaned your tables as quickly as possible so that's a plus.

* every time i would come back to the table all the plates that we done were no longer there, so they did an exceptional job*

Location: im glad that they opened one somewhat near where i live cause before it would either be in San Fran/San Diego which ever it was and another would be at the border of mexico and California. So yea good place.

side note: you get the drinks as you are waiting in line. water and soda are in the same cup but you get charged less for the water. iono if they will notice you getting water and then refilling it up for like sprite or something.

 Last night my family went to for the Specialty night Wednesday is steak and wings.  I was disappointed they only had one flavor wings and I don't like spicy food.  So I had to pass on that.  But I got rave reviews from other people abut the steak.  I liked the Meat loaf and fish and the fried okra.  Still all in all plenty for everyone to find something to eat.

No more going to the strip for a buffet when you can go here for less and better variety.  

I still give it two thumbs up.  And they also do birthday parties and have a room to accommodate you group.  I had one there for my daughter this year and everyone enjoyed it.

2277550,2012-05-01,4,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"I expected Hometown Buffet, so I was hugely pleased by some aspects, and largely disappointed by others.  Overall, it was great.  I'm worried that the pros won't last past the first year, though.

I went weekday afternoon (before 4).  It was under $9 a person, and then another $2 if you want a drink.  It costs a bit over $10 for dinner, but they are doing a M-Th 2 dinners for $20 deal, I believe.

First impression: the most frustrating opening set-up I had ever seen.  The have no space between the cash register, drinks, and wait to be seated area.  It is a cheap buffet-- you are going to get huge groups and families.  The cashier told me to get my drink, before he rung me up, but I couldn't reach the water that was all the way in the front because there was a party of 8 waiting to be seated, there.  Cashier eventually let us through without getting our drinks first, but that meant we had to wait until the waitress noticed we had two empty cups of ice before asking to get us more drinks.  

I understand the concept.  You want people to choose their drink as they wait to pay, and sip while they wait for a table.  Then you want the waitress to bring drinks to ensure water customers don't try to fill up at the drink bar.  They did it wrong, though.  There is not enough space to breathe at the  entryway, and there were two cashiers and two parties (mine only had 2 people in it).  That is sad.

SALAD Bar: OMG better than Souplantation!  They have such fresh veggies, refilled all the time, manned by a couple of attendants.  They do not have the variety of Souplantation, but they have some options Souplantation doesn't have.  I got baby spinach with slices of fresh tomato, crisp bell pepper, slices of onion, pickled jalapeno, guacamole, and salsa.  There were like 3 types of salsa strewn about.  It was awesome.  Then I got a deviled egg on the side (just a hard boiled egg with paprika, it looked like).  You can see the supermarket fresh produce sitting near the salad bar.  I was impressed.  I expected this to be a mainly meat buffet.

The MEAT: Don't get me wrong, they definitely have meat, and it's grilled in front of you, and you can get fish or shrimp cooked to order to eat on its own or add to your salad, pasta, or what have you.  I got the steak.  They are good about having medium rare.  It's not that overcooked under the lamp stuff you get at other buffets.  The steak was really fatty.  Half my piece was fat.  I had to wait in line for it, too  =(  I recommend you ask for double what you want to eat, just in case.  The steak is kind of tough, and slightly on the salty side.  The BBQ chicken was delicious.  It just fell off the bones.  The fish was pretty good and tender.  The sides for the meat are good, too.  They have a bell pepper onion medley, sauteed mushrooms, onion rings, and what not.

The Prepared dishes: There were some good prepared dishes.  I recommend the Bourbon Chicken.  It's well seasoned.  Everything I tried was average to pretty good.  I was happy.

The DESSERT Bar:  One thing about Hometown is I avoid the dessert bar like the plague.  Or I might get some soft serve.  I tried the desserts here, though.  They have ice cream, and soft-serve.  It is your generic ice cream (kind of tastes like Ralphs/ Kroger brand cookies and cream).  They have a cotton candy machine!  It was fun.  They have okay desserts.  The red velvet cupcake was still warm when I got it, unlike the disgusting overpriced POS I got at Sprinkles a few weeks ago.  AVOID THE BROWNIE AT ALL COSTS.  I nearly chipped my tooth on that thing, it was so hard.  The fudge was softer.  They also have a chocolate fountain, and some fruit, marshmallows, or cookies you can stick in it.  The heart cookies were cute, but they were out by the time I got to it.  It wasn't meant to be.

After having had both lunch and dinner here I think I can say this buffet is a better version of hometown buffet, but nothing THAT special.  Maybe I've just been spoiled by all those Las Vegas buffets.

What I don't like about the place:  First off, I don't like having to start off at the drink machines and carry my drink while waiting in line.. then carry my drink all the way to the tables.  And then when at the table, when I run out of soft drink/coffee/tea/water I need to flag down a waiter in order to get a refill.  Why?  Because once inside the actual buffet, the only dispensers are operated by servers only. fail.  Second, the actual buffet area is poorly designed.  I never know who is in what line because often times lines fuse together.  Third and most importantly.. A lot of what golden corral advertises on t.v. is not at this restaurant.  perhaps because this is just starting out?  But i felt the selection wasn't as great as it should be.

What I do like:  Even though a lot of items go fast, all you have to do is let someone know, and they'll be nice and try to replace that item as quickly as possible.  The servers are friendly as well as the buffet staff which makes for a nice dining experience.  Food is what you can expect of a standard buffet.  Some items taste better than others but nothing is going to blow your socks off.  Just decent food for an okay price.

All in all, would I come here again?  Sure I would but probably at the same frequency that I visit someplace like Hometown buffet which is really 2-3 times a year if even that.  There is no reason that people should be dreaming about golden corrals anymore.

The clam chowder was pretty good too.  Their foods are very decent and I really enjoyed it.  (I'm very picky)  

The desert section was pretty good.  They have scopes of ice cream provided to you.  I tried the cookie & cream, it was soo good.  The best thing is they have cotton candy for you in just seconds.

My husband had been to one in Tennessee and told me about how they made steaks to order and it was this great food for a decent price. The Las Vegas location did not have the steaks and I found the food only adequate (except the fried chicken which was very good). I'm rating it low because the furnishings we're so cheap and not clean. The silverware had soap stains and was so light weight they felt meant to be thrown away. The plates seemed like dollar store quality. The carpets, tables and chairs were just as cheap. They did have a fun looking desert section with a chocolate fountain and fun things to dip in it. There was a cotton candy machine but it didn't seem to be being used. The bathrooms were nicely tiled but it was not clean in there. The employees were beyond polite and the best part of the place but I just can't seem to get over how cheap the furnishings were. It was like being in a large Jack in the Box seating area only worse. I would have rather had plastic throwaway silverware then the cheap dirty metal ones provided. The cost was affordable. We were there for the 7.99 early bird special.

My BF was there earlier and waited in line so I was lucky I didn't have to wait that long. We came on a Friday night around 6 and the place was super packed already. It took us about 15 minutes before we were actually seated. Dinner was $11.30 Monday-Friday and $12 over the weekend. Drinks are an additional $2.

As for the food...they have a...
Salad bar:  Salad bar was okay. Nothing special about it. You can create your own salad with any topping you could think of or they have a pre-made ceaser salad. They also had 2 different types of soup that day, chicken noodle and chili. They also had your typical potato salad/mac salad/ and stuff like that so nothing really stood out about their salad bar.

Mexican/American/Italian/Asian food: they had a variety of different types of food, but none of them were too my liking. I'm not a picky eater. I'll try everything once, but the food was just...boring to me. They had your typical orange chicken, kung pao something, quesadilla, onion rings, pasta, fried chicken, pizza, fried shrimp, and more.

Grill area: around the grill area they had toast, fried/popcorn shrimp, stuffing and of course the steak. My BF got a steak on his first plate and it was cooked just how he wanted (medium rare) and it wasn't dry at all. He liked it so he got another one and that one came out super dry that he couldn't finish it. But the steak in my opinion wasn't that good. It didn't have any flavor on it at all.

Desserts: they had pies, cakes, the chocolate fountain, cotton candy, and ice cream. None of those things really stood out to me either. I had to get a marshmallow covered in chocolate though, but the strawberries were so tiny and didn't look appetizing at all. Ice cream of course is always good and I've never seen a buffet with rainbow sherbet so that made me happy. And take the cotton candy before you leave!

Service:
It was good actually. Better than most buffets I've gone to. Plates were taken away pretty quickly and drinks were refilled when we barely drank half of the cup. Seeing how crowded the place was, I was pretty surprise with the service.",TXGr6gc0jCSJhbgTMmfsqg,1,0,2,elwnkYNYmMHDUQW_Dma7vg

This place has it's Pros & Cons.. 

The WAIT:
     A quick tip if you're debating about coming here.. If you want to enjoy it on a weekend or holiday expect a massive line (extending outside and snaking through the parking lot) I went here once at 11am with co-worker whom paid.. at that time there was no line. However, returning the next week at 1:30pm on a Sunday and the line extended further that i could see into the parking lot. NOT WORTH IT! Go to hometown buffet if you're that hankering for a buffet.. no line.. ever..

The SELECTION:
     It's a good plethora of mediocre foods that will have something for everyone. If you want to taste the majority of the world's cuisines all on one plate, you'll like this golden corral. Much better than hometown buffet. Plus, the serving area is always clean.

The FOOD:
     Well, Las Vegas has spoiled me on buffets, sadly. However, this food isn't too bad. Here are some things that were quite lack-luster but overal all it was decent. The food rarely sits out long due to the hungry hordes of people whom devour it as soon as it comes out so no worries about old food. 

My Opinion:
     This Golden Corral is alright. It is nothing I would write home about or punch my grandma over, but for a buffet it would a pleasant experience. I would come here again? Sure, as long as the line to get in wasn't longer than a ride at disneyland.",MwWlCxfuK9R64x50D0i8jg,3,0,3,2Sl8ZeSoSwwBnQGz3t0Rcg

The price for the dinner buffet is $11.99 somewhat okay, but you have to pay for the drink separately which will run you about $2.39 cents. So, our total check was around $31 and some change. Not bad, $15 - $16 dollars for two people. 

Pros: The food was okay, there was a lot of people during that time so you had to make sure to get in line to get your food. The steak was probably the best food choice I had here second to that was the fried chicken. 
Cons: The place is dirty and the restroom was 10 times worst.  Could have anyone picked up a broom and swipe some of the dirt and food on the floor? We apparently sat on a table where no server was stationed. So we had to get our own refills and we even had to tell one server to pickup our plates.

2429932,2012-10-18,1,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Yep, 3 stars that is what they deserve. Why? Because, it's not like ""OMG DELICIOUS CHEAP FOOD"" but ""hey this is better than Hometown Buffet"" type of food. Be prepared to wait if you go for lunch or dinner but the customer service are pretty quick about trying to find a spot for you. Grab your drinks first before you pay is a bit awkward because there is a cash register while you are holding your drink, and you are standing in a messy crowded line waiting to be seated. 
Food is decent. They have everything you can think of. They have seafood (fried), Mexican, Chinese, Italian, pizza, different types of meats (turkey, chicken, beef [cooked the way you want], ham), a very nice salad bar (which no one really touches) filled with different types of greens, meats (bacon, salami, pepperoni), croutons, nuts, and dressing. Small soup bar which had Calm Chowder and Chili. Finally, they have a large dessert bar which has cookies, pies, cakes, fruits, a cotton candy machine, ice cream, and the chocolate fondue which you can dip either a marshmallow or a strawberry. 

Even though they do have a large variety of foods, I think depending when it comes out will determine the quality of food after all it will be sitting under a heat lamp. 

Do not expect the food quality to be GREAT but edible. The Turkey and meat can be dry. Ham can be salty. Chicken will either be salty or savory. Fried items can get hard or greasy. Chocolate fondue does not use real chocolate as it had that cheap no-name brand chocolate flavor taste and the cotton candy quality was lacking as the texture was rough and hard. REAL cotton candy melts in your mouth and when you touch the cotton candy on the stick or bag, it should feel soft, fluffy, and soft not rough, hard, and pebble-y. Like I said before, it's not top notch quality food but a decent place to come grab a meal with your family (that's picky about food) on a weekday / weekend. 

Props to the customer service. Even though they were busy, they were not rude even though you can tell they looked annoyed at the crowd, they refilled drinks, and constantly kept the area clean. From the staff in the back/ kitchen wiping the bars to the front cleaning tables and vaccumming the floors.

I really had high hopes for this place because I saw their commercials all the time but the closest Golden Corral was like in Apple Valley which unless I'm on my way to Vegas I will not visit and even on the way to Vegas I wouldn't stop here. So here's the deal. Don't waste your time in line. There is nothing inside that is worth going in. The place is over-hyped and overrun by some of the ghetto-ist looking people in my life. I don't know if it was just my luck or what but in an area that is mostly Asian there was a fairly large population of cholos there. Its what I imagine a prison cafeteria would look like if decorated by Denny's.

 The line for the steak is long and it was a tough piece of cow. The salad bar didn't seem fresh and the dessert area was kind of messy. The seem well staffed but people are pigs. That's what it felt like too, like cattle herded to the trough. Maybe that's the Corral part. What really grossed me out was when I got some fried shrimp and one fell out of its bin on to the steam table. I left it there because it should be tossed. No longer edible right? Nope. A worker with bare hands tossed it back into it bin. Freaking gross, glad it didn't hit the floor. Never again! Bathroom was dirty too.

Anyway...in the final analysis, I can say with confidence that it is better than every Las Vegas hotel buffet costing less than $40...and yes, I frequent them all.

Seriously good selection of items, some of my favorites:  Deviled Eggs, green bean casserole, quality steaks (note: Grill chef will prepare two-stages past whatever you request unless you're on top of him!), sautéed mushrooms, various kinds of really good chicken and the whole chocolate waterfall thing.

All three times I've been there (Weekends 3, 4 and 5pm) it was CRAZY crowded, which surprised me on the 3pm Saturday visit.  BUT, this has the excellent effect of ensuring that all of the food is quite fresh.

If your idea of a good time or celebrating an occasion at a unfriendly, dirty, disgusting establishment, by all means (I won't come here again) :(.

With this being the only location in Las Vegas, I anticipated a long line. We went on a Sunday late morning. The wait time was 15-20 minutes. It helped that the drink fountain is located in the area where you wait in line. The cashier was friendly as was the host that was seating us.

With it being a busy location and time frame in mind, I was disappointed. The restaurant is set up buffet style.  Certain areas were messy, and where people had spilled items all over the serving trays, workers were not fast enough in keeping the trays looking clean and tidy. (a quick glance and wipe down would take 10 seconds, but many of the workers stood behind their stations, not moving or double checking anything).

My son and I were about to dig into the mashed potatoes tray when the worker quickly swiped up the tray to scrape the tater remains into another full tray of taters, without so much as a quick smile or 'hold on one second so you can get fresh taters instead' acknowledgement. We just stood there with the serving spoon dripping tater remains, our mouths agape.

Had my husband been reviewing this restaurant instead, I would guess that he would give the place one star. More than once, he came back to our table with a disappointed look, once because the ranch dressing was out, and twice because the dish that looked most delicious to him kept running out, and the worker at the station responded in a less than friendly manner when he had asked what the wait time would be. 

Another observation and in no way affects the rating I gave this place: restaurant patrons are RUDE. They cut in line to serve themselves something. Or, they let their kids run up to the dessert area to dip their desserts into the chocolate fountain, which results in splatters, spills, mess, and kids shoving each other. It was hectic!


PROS: desserts and chocolate fountain and cotton candy are my favorite. CONS: employees can SMILE and acknowledge their patrons.",jWNooyYAuHWUpxnZGTRpeA,9,3,2,SekT5iESK1aQxSyqD7wBXw

I pass by the City of Industry Golden Corral every time I travel into Los Angeles. And it's always busy.

The one other word that really comes to mind about my visit to Golden Corral is SODIUM!!! Boy, everything was really salty. To be honest, the food wasn't bad for a place like this. I had the buffalo chicken wings (pretty good), the bourbon chicken (not good), fried chicken (good, salty), roasted chicken (good, salty), steak slider (dry and too hard of a bun), Southern style fried fish (fish was tender but soggy cornmeal breading), fried okra (same problem as the fish), and the pork steak (very good but salty).

Overall, I'd say it was better than I would have expected. It sure reminded me of a Sizzler meets Home Town Buffet on Steroids!!",OmRCx3406Jk_5969ONBdqA,2,0,3,DYr34pRH0p5oUfZCDyzvGA

Although if I am being all the way honest, I am a bit mad they put it on the east side. Come on, the ghetto will travel for a $12 buffet I promise. But at the same token, the lonely ol' east side that I grew up on needed some good food. Hopefully when you dine, the crowd will be a bit more pleasant. 
My bf and I decided to try it for lunch (please don't tell my kids). Our total was under $20, so instant score in my opinion. They also offer sweet tea. Double score.
You wait in line to pay, and get drinks before reaching a cashier. Somewhat silly because if the waitresses aren't up on game, it is a bit hard to get a refill. Plus, it holds up the line a bit. For lunch the selections were not bad at all! Pasta, pizza, meatloaf, fish, fried chicken, a few Asian choices, and a small salad area. The desserts section was big, but the chocolate fountain didn't look all that sanitary so I skipped. It is a perfect height for kids (with no sneeze guard) to walk right up and stick their dirty little, bug eating, butt picking fingers right in it! And I watched plenty un-supervised kids do exactly that. Don't take this the wrong way, there is a sneeze guard, but not if you are under 4 feet tall! The ambiance really reminded you that you were eating on Charleston and Lamb and I was really hoping they would avoid that. But honestly it was the people eating, not watching their kids, getting every possible bang for the buck they could, that set the tone. 
I will return, mostly to let the kids try it. We will see how that experience goes and then decide if I will continue to dine.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,1,0,3,3Co2KBIZbRFNdsz-XIvlnw

Don't get me wrong. Golden Corral is by no means a place you would expect to get 5 star cuisine... but for the price point, I think it's totally spot on. From what I'd heard from others, I was expecting worse than Hometown Buffet and luckily, we got that, and then some.

Really enjoyed the salad bar, very fresh and good selection... and the cheddar biscuits- totally reminded me of Red Lobster's version. Some of the items were hit or miss. Mini sliders were a total surprise hit for us. Stick to the basic American comfort foods like fried chicken, meatloaf, mac and cheese, etc. and you'll be just fine.

2592500,2012-07-24,1,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"First off this is NOT a 5 Star restaurant, nor does it endeavor to be. My rating is in comparison to other casual buffets. 

I've been to more buffets then I care to admit, including many Golden Corrals while traveling around the country. 

Honestly, I'm not sure what all the negativity is about. The store is kept very clean, especially considering the volume of customers. We got there around 3 on a Wednesday and there were no lines, but it was already crowded inside. The food is good quality (better than many of their competitors) and there's a large variety to choose from. The Mexican and Chinese food are not their strong points, but still add to the selection. The salad and desert bars are very extensive, featuring cold shrimp, strips of steak and crumbled blue cheese and chocolate fondue, cotton candy and hand scooped ice cream, respectively.

I truly think that all the bad reviews are just written by people who dislike buffets, which is fine, but that being the case why would you go there in the first place and then complain about it? If you like buffets this is one of your best bets. With the quality and selection offered it's hard to believe lunch is just over 8 bucks, which is probably why the line is often out the door. 

In all fairness, there are some downsides. The crowd is a pain and doesn't exactly make for a relaxing meal, but they keep the food well stocked and the lines moving as best as they can. I'm not crazy about the buffet set up where all the food is in a row as opposed to the various scatter bars. It's not as convenient and creates line ups. I really don't care for having the drink bar at the counter before you pay. It takes longer to check out and it's tiresome waiting for the overworked staff to bring you refills. I never order a drink as it costs more and they only serve Pepsi products--ick, but we were low on water several times. 

In short, it you're looking for an affordable meal with a variety large enough to please your whole family, then this is the place for you. If you want a quiet meal, with stunning ambience and gourmet food it will most likely cost you over $10.  :)",Pg6jhSiF6sBTMe3m8bZ9Sg,4,1,5,KH5KlSjFuJOfdq-CDI4JbQ
2599679,2012-08-02,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Finally a Golden Corral near home!~ I have eaten at the one up at Bakersfield, and that one was very good. So now to try this one! 

Line is long of course, and prices are cheap for a decent buffet (better than Hometown Buffet!!!). Instead of my GOOD/BAD kind of review, I will pin point each station, as all of them have their positive and negative aspect. Itallian and Chinese were skipped cause they're my frequent eats at home.

LINE: I expected a long wait as it was up Central Cali. When it got to the inside of the place for the line, it was way too stuffed once you get to the cash register. There was barely any room to move an inch. They really need to fix this, especially some of us are carrying drinks in our hands. 

SODA FOUNTAIN: Lots of variety, and a little messy. 

SERVICE: Pretty attentive at some points, and sometimes not so much. I feel like they shove a waiter/waitress to one area, and just only one waiter/waitress per area, and this place is pretty big. It took awhile to get a refill of my drink cause our waitress was nowhere to be found. She had to take care of the whole side of the room :/ Plus, when we arrived, we notice she also was in charge of cleaning the floors. So they need more staffing and not skimp out or put a soda fountain available for customers to get themselves, cause a lot of people were needing refills and getting upset (no no, not just me).

BREAD: Good selections. I really enjoy the buttery cheese biscuits! they're almost like the ones from Red Lobster ^.^ 

SEAFOOD: I didn't get to taste a lot since they ran out most of the time :[ So I stuck with popcorn shrimp.

MEATS: Well, I wanted to try a bbq slider or steak slider, but it keeps running out @.@ 

MEXICAN: I should of skipped this! At the other GC, I made a fajita and that was enjoyable. In this station, I tasted the enchilada, and it was bland and weird. I guess cause I'm so used to my bf's mom's authentic Mexican cooking. But what really turned me off was their tortilla chips. They're so thin and tasted like paper. Why had they not use corn tortilla?!

OTHER: They have sweet baked potato and that was delicious, and OH! real bacon bites for it! YUM! Like actual bacon, not the red hard rock fake ones. I also like their bourbon chicken a lot.

DESSERT: My favorite of course. The chocolate fountain, cookies, ice cream, and cotton candy~ BUT for that line for ice cream, it's so disorganized :/ kids and people are cutting in front! And you don't even know if the person in front is going for the swirly ice cream machine or the scooped ice cream.

So my expectations were a little high on service and organization, cause the one up Central, is superb than this. Since the place is crowded with lots of fellow diners, it may be a battle to get your favorite dish at each station. Hell, I didn't get to have some fancy fish or them sliders ;_____; and was really dying for a refill on my drink several times. And I wish some employees smiled :/

It was pretty bad. All the food was cooked wrong or seasoned wrong it seems. I will just list them out! lol

 - regular bacon. Like no flavor at all. Just bland. I don't know how this happens. Just crispy pork strips. Didn't really taste bacon.
 - deep fried bacon. The batter was so damn salty! It had the crappy bacon in the middle and this terrible batter.
 - county fried steak. Not cooked right. The batter was like falling off. The steak was alright, I don't think it was round steak. Way to salty.
 - the ham cubes. Just tasted bad. what glaze was that!
 - Hash browns. Not crispy at all, no flavor. Maybe get some salt from that batter for the bacon.
 - biscuits and gravy. Gravy, no flavor and runny. Biscuits average.
 - breakfast sausage. No damn flavor man.

They had the normal fried chicken, and the normal desert bar. Random mexican food. 

French toast was good. Apple and orange juice (though apple juice seemed super sweet).

Overall, very sad. I like their lunch (sliders and liver n onions baby!). The breakfast food is very bad to me. They need to step it up.

I will never come back here for breakfast!

I will make a trip for lunch again though )",xcLozuEqx7OJjdc2wU3sBQ,1,0,1,JXDNGdIoHDBhjWVgt_jUdA

The price was a little high for what they offer. I mean this is Vegas the home of the Buffet. They should have really up their game to compete here. 
The place was busy but the wait wasn't that long. The food was just ok. It was nothing  we couldn't had got in any buffet on the strip for half the price. For a new building the place looked like a dump. I think they were trying to show case the freshness of the food but the piles of boxes and other things just made behind the buffet looked cluttered and unkempt.  The poor server was doing his best but he couldn't keep up the mess that people were making and leaving behind. 
The dessert section was lacking it was like a buffet  set out at the nursing home with lots of little cookies, jello, and puddings. There was nothing there was would make you go wow.

2607451,2012-07-02,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Since I have never been a big fan of buffet places outside of Las Vegas, my expectations for this place were not very high. After driving into the parking lot and saw that the line was literally out the door and nearly half the length of the building outside, I was hoping that there would be a reason why all these people were standing in line to eat here. Maybe this place would be better than the cafeteria-type food I was expecting...

We had a party of 8 and only 7 had arrived, but the cashier was nice enough to let me pay for our 8th person so they wouldn't have to wait in line to join us inside. This place has very few tables for parties larger than 4, so we were seated at 2 adjoining 4-person tables. It was a Friday night and the place was CROWDED. Each of the various stations had quite a line, but I made it a point to try a sample of each place.

The salad bar and dessert bar were both pretty standard, with the dessert bar featuring novelties such as real ice cream (as opposed to a soft-serve machine) and cotton candy, as well as a chocolate fountain. The fresh breads section was fairly good. I enjoyed the garlic cheese biscuits and my friend said that the yeast rolls were great too. 

Most of the other food was rather normal or sub-par. Not very different from your run-of-the-mill Hometown Buffet in terms of quality, and with similar selections. The steak line was pretty long, but the cook would only serve ""rare"" or ""well done"" even when asked for medium rare or something else. The well done was overcooked and the rare was very rare. A lot of the fried food, such as the steak fries, fried shrimp, and fried chicken were good, but a lot of the other times, such as the mac and cheese, corn on the cob, and veggies lacked flavor and just screamed ""frozen food from Costco!"" Not cool. I'd skip most of the ""ethnic dishes"" as well unless you don't mind the lack of authenticity or good taste in general. 

Since the place was constantly busy, it was understandable that the restaurant was a MESS. Our table must've had lil kids eating on it before us, because the seats and underneath the table were covered in crumbs and leftover food. Not a big deal for me, but moreso for our resident clean-freak. 

So overall...
The good: The service was great and friendly. Props to the cashier for seating us without our entire party being present. Service was great. Our server was friendly, quick, and courteous. One extra star thanks to Brittany for her great service. At $12 for dinner, you can have a ton of food on a relatively low budget. 
The bad: Most of the food was very average, and some of the food was just not good at all. 
The ugly: The place is very busy and always seems to be packed, so be prepared to wait if you coming during a busy lunch or dinner period. Messy and crowded. Has the ambience of a cafeteria.",o7zuV1hU1T6-hMBdGF1lBQ,0,0,2,e2tWrS3_iQh1wUtkYmqi6g

Until yesterday.

I decided to come back for the Lunch Buffet. For $8.49 per person plus $1.99 for drinks, I thought it was a really good deal. Plus, we didn't have to wait in line at all, just zoomed right in. This was around like 2pm-ish.

Some of the dishes that I thought were alright include Macaroni and Cheese, Mashed Potatoes, Lasagna, and Popcorn Shrimp. 

I thought the ice cream was the best part. There's multiple flavors like Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, Butter Pecan, and Rainbow Sherbet to name a few. They serve you by the scoop. There's also a self soft serve machine. 

I've had cotton candy on the first visit and I learned quickly that it's not something I should end my meal with. It's super sweet and I didn't want to move afterwards.

The service was okay but could have been better. It took us a while to get our drinks refilled. Had I known I would've overfilled it to the brim before we paid. It also took them a while to take our plates away. Luckily, we didn't fill up the table or that would have been a nightmare.

The booths aren't all that great. There's cushion on the bottom but nothing but hard wood on the back so.. just don't lean back. I guess that's their way of saying ""We don't want you here that long...""

I don't know if I would come back. I mean nothing really stands out except the fact that it's super cheap.

So yeah overall experience at the Golden Corral wasn't very golden at all. I'd call it the Silver Roundup or maybe even the Bronze Rodeo.",r-udHOpqo67mPjaL_A99Rw,16,16,3,tl7KRS_k_nYiguYQU927-g

If you're a woman and weigh less than 150 pounds and you're a man and you weigh less than 185 pounds, you are not allowed to write buffet reviews. Seriously.

Maybe Yelp should include a ""Do you weigh more than 150/185 pounds"" as an additional tip if you eat at a tapas-style restaurant? 

Enough ranting. All I can say is that Golden Corral is a slightly more expensive, but higher quality (in terms of food) buffet than Hometown Buffet. I like Hometown's seating arrangement better with it's ample amount of booths whereas Golden Corral seems satisfied to be primarily tables to get the customer in and out. As with all buffets, only order water as a drink so you can chow down more and don't forget to bring cash to tip the bussers/drink servers because there's no option to tip at the register.",yRuIpAQyvKaDUV717fQpJg,2,3,5,99ZCTQjWfQaxhE9pHogFCQ

Dessert is good but it depends on what you get and how full you are after killing yourself with steak(which is pretty good especially made to your preference). Everything else that is not fresh made (i.e. chinese food, the non-fresh fish, hush puppies) tastes like ones from the mediocre buffets. Worth the wait? not really. Come back again? maybe after few months. To me, it is just for try, not for once a few weeks. Price is CHEAP though!",4wOmX6YjnO_GnGrQg2GtaQ,0,0,3,IG6yROvzhD7PkG6GyqxJlg

I gotta give GC some credit for their concept is pretty straightforward. With hundreds of buffets all around Vegas, another one isnt gonna hurt right? After having dinner here tonight because of my father in law's birthday choice, I would say the A-OK rating of 3 stars was pretty much spot on.

So before I relay my experience, let me get the necessities out of the way.
ADULTS
Breakfast: $8.59 Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays only from open to 11 am.
Lunch: $8.59 Mon thru Fri 10:30 am to 4 pm.
Dinner: $11.89 Mon thru Sat 4 pm to close. Sun 11 am to close.

CHILDREN
Ages 3 and under free. Limit 2 free meals per adult purchase.
Ages 4 to 8 $4.79 
Ages 9 to 12 $5.79

SENIORS 60 AND OVER
Same as adults but $7.99 for breakfast and lunch. 
Dinner is $10.99

None of these prices include drinks which is another $1.99 for a plastic tumbler. $2.50 for a large to go cup. Water there is no charge. So remember, the original price is just for the food. So dinner turned out to be a little over 15 bucks per adult because waterjust aint gonna cut it.

Every day there is a different theme so for monday it was seafood night. Sorry peeps, crab legs aint one of them. You did have popcorn shrimp, breaded shrimp, breaded white fish, breaded clam strips and stuffed crab. None of which blew me away but at the same time was not bad meaning it was edible.

Of course the the main feature was the grill area where sirloin steaks were being grilled. Kudos to the designer of the layout for all GC's because of the fact that you can see and smell what was being cooked on the grill. Surrounding that grill area are sides that you would typically see accompanying main entrees like sauteed mushrooms, onions, green peppers, etc.

Just to the right of the grill are where most of the items people start forming lines for like mashed potatoes, fried okra, all the above seafood items, and lots of others that you just have to see for yourself. One section that is guaranteed not to have a line is the salad bar section. 

If you refer to my one plate of food, I pretty much got a little bit of everything I wanted put together. Some key notes to mention. The only things that really stood out for me were the yeast rolls, the fruits in the salad bar section, and the dessert section. 

The yeast rolls are some of the best I have had in while. They are good by themselves but when you put a little bit of butter on them, man watch out, I can easily eat 3 of those without even blinking.

As for the award for the least amount of attention goes to the salad bar section. Yeah, I know, nobody really goes to a buffet to eat salad. You would be surprised though. I thought some of the fruit and vegetables they had there were pretty fresh and crisp. The actual veggies that you can put together to make your own salad can almost rival Sweet Tomatoes or Soup Plantation for you Californians.

The dessert section is commendable for it has a wide selection of different forms of sugar for you sweet tooth individuals from ice cream, soft serve, cotton candy, rice crispies, marshmellows, etc.

Notice I didnt mention the chocolate waterfalls. They had what looked like caramel, white chocolate, and milk chocolate. I know it all sounds like a good thing based on description and actually seeing it in person is awesome too but here's where the skidding sound comes in when you see a car slam its brakes. As I was looking to see what items to select and maybe dip in chocolate, this little kid comes out of nowhere picking his nose, sticks his finger into the chocolate waterfall, and proceeds to put it in his mouth. It happened so quick that I dont think anybody else saw it but me. Only problem is that when I replay it in my head its in slow motion so I get the full effect of what he did.

So take heed in my dessert experience, I wouldnt wanna go dipping anything in the chocolate for you dont know what unknown thing is floating around in there. Also the bathroom only has two stalls and has 3 urinals. You would think that a buffet would have the same amount of stalls or at least more because of the fact that its a buffet. Bottom line is that you get decent food selections at a decent price. I would rank this place a notch above Home Town Buffet.

Cousin Amy loves Golden Corral and raved about it.  So we had to try it at least once.
Finally we pass by and didn't see a line out the door.

Came on a Wednesday, around 1:30 and while crowded, the stations weren't swamped with people.
We were able to get in right away, so we decided to give it a shot.

No surprise, the hubby had a grand ol' time.
Lots of things for him to try.

For us diabetics, it's a trial.
It was torture to bypass all the good stuff and stick with things that wouldn't make my glucose reading skyrocket later.

Very kiddie-friendly!
Lots of what I heard a little girl happily refer to as ""brown"" (fried) food and even cotton candy.

Our server, Chris, was great.
He should be working at a more formal restaurant!

Mixed reactions here.
The hubby would love to come back, but he'll have to find someone else to accompany him.  Once was enough for me.",Tuq59VSdqnCmotr_910JoQ,9,7,3,2AjYqvY9PzEJtYzl94lXuw

I do have to say that their dessert table is quite extensive and was very tempting. I would say that is the best thing about the place.

Service is fast, friendly, and courteous!

When you first enter the buffet, there is a fountain drink station. 50 cents extra if you want a to-go cup. There are the standard sodas, fruit juices and teas, but also Jamaica & Horchata. 

We quickly went in to seat ourselves and the servers leave a cute name-card on your table so you could know who they are. Nice touch!

There was a fresh fruit and salad bar, yogurt, cereal bowls and milk, a station where they prepare custom omelette, make your own waffles, and other standard breakfast foods: eggs, potatoes, hash browns, etc.

I got 2 plates of food:
Hash browns, scrambled eggs, bacon, quiche (very light & creamy), ranch potatoes, breakfast pizza (no tomato sauce, just scrambled eggs, bacon, & sausage; pretty good!), deviled eggs, french toast, and apple turn over.

For pancakes (they have chocolate chip & blueberry too), waffles, french toast, w/e you can add strawberries, peaches, more berries, powdered sugar, cinnamon, syrup, etc. 

After this we had dessert! For the chocolate fountain there were skewers to pick your own chocolate dip foods. There were: macaroons, strawberries, truffles, rice krispies,  a heart cookie, marshmallows,etc. I also swiped a red velvet cake cupcake!! Before I left, I also took cotton-candy stick to-go; I felt like a kid again!

There is also a to-go option. They give you a box & you can fill it as much as you want, & it's $4.59 a pound.

Will definitely come back for lunch & try out the rest of the menu. Great for price & quality.",T6fk18hJADtrVTRoqBKd1Q,14,2,4,3haM3-SKN3Ih9drv81-j9w

I think even if you didn't have children with you it would be uncomfortable. they attract a loud, disrespectful, and inconsiderate kind of clientele, as my family and I couldn't even hear each other of how loud and obnoxious people around were. Managment seemed to be ok with that type of behavior. We had to fight our way to our table of how packed and unorganized things were.

I got a green tea, and I saw Hochata, so I got a second cup for Hochata. As we were paying I asked the cashier, were the drinks charged individually, by that I meant was I being charged for two drinks instead of one drink, she said it was included in the price, I took it as I can drink anything I want for ONE price. Later on, I checked the receipt Hochata was charged separately for $2.49. If I have known I had to pay for Hochata, I wouldn't have got it. They should have a sign informing the consumers regular soda drinks one price, otherwise there is a charge for the rest of the drinks, we were not charged for coffee, not sure if it was included in the price of the meal.

That was just the only complain I had, but everything else was excellent. The wait staffs were very friendly and very very tentative. The food were hot,  very tasty and very fresh too. They actually made the cakes, grilled the chicken and pork chop and chopped the salads at the front so the food were very fresh. Over all GC is way much better than HomeTown Buffet in every way.

I will now dine at GC than HTB. If the service and the food maintain at this high standard, I will definitely come back again and again, I have been waiting for a Golden Corral restaurant in this area ever since I saw their adds a few years back.

2898775,2013-12-22,6,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Golden Corral, you finally made it back to Vegas!   

I have to admit, I'm a fan of this standardized, controlled, family buffet, but this location is still undergoing growing pains of a new business. and it shown on my visit today.  Maybe, it's unfair to compare this location to the one in Hespria, because that location been open for awhile, but this is what the Las Vegas location need to strive for to earn my next star.

I believe Golden Corral has earn a reputation of being a pretty good family buffet value around the United States, and their streaming fountain became a great niche for them.   Even though, Las Vegas is still the buffet capital of the world, and has some of the nicest buffets on the planet.   You would think, why would Golden Corral come back here?   Well, if you think about it, there was room for Golden Corral to comeback to Sin City, because of the ever increasing prices and the steep nose dive on food quality at some of our casino buffets; and this alone has made it simple for Golden Corral to re-enter the market.

Upon pulling up onto the parking lot from Lamb Blvd, you could see there was a pretty long line going into Gold Corral lobby, but surprisingly the wait wasn't too long at all.   Like all Golden Corral, you would get your drink before paying for your meal, and head into the dining room.  This is where the stars start falling down, because of the mass chaos that going on in this restaurant

Like all first week of a business, you'll see a overstaffed of employees, but there was no real control of the workers in this restaurant.   My waitress, Deborah, a nice older Mexican lady was the only person that was working in my section, and no one was helping her at all.  From what I notice, Deborah was handling nearly 12 tables, and she was doing a heck of job, but watching the others around her was almost unbearable to watch.   It seems like that five minute huddle of the six bussers, who were hanging out near the drink station had a better agenda of not helping anyone.  Come on guys, let get with it, and help each other in this restaurant

I was kind of bummed that this location didn't have my warm bacon dressing for the Spinach salad, and not to mention the kitchen staff wasn't moving quick enough to restock a few items such as mash potatoes, fried rice, and sliders.  On a good note, the fried chicken and peanut butter fudge was pretty good.   Come on Golden Corral, get the warm bacon dressing or I""m never going to come back to this location!   That alone makes me come back to you!!   

I""m sorry to give this location a three star rating, because they need to earn the fourth star like Hespria.    I'll be back in a couple of months, and hopefully this location will have worked out the kinks by then.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,17,4,3,VzOjt79IxKyuuyouLXIQvQ

The line wasn't too bad, however they could have easily got another cashier  and took the line down immediately.

The place was thriving and crowded however not too crowded where it was irritating. This ofc was on a monday night. 

There are so many food choices my head hurt haha.

They didnt have roast beef, any kind of ribs. They did have steak, chicken fish and anything else you could dream up. even two kinds of cheese sauce for awesome nachos or cheesy potatoes.

They had an awesome bread rack with rolls plumped glazed and soft from heaven! I could hear Angelic waves of music when I saw them.

I got too full to even enjoy desert. I did get one bite of red velvet cake down. They have a chocolate fountain, ice cream all kinds of pie and cotton candy machine.

Will go back on a weeknight only. Don't want to deal with any lines. They really need to make that system better.",KuSa-rzOQF3rnqpsvGaZ5w,2,0,4,dfo8ptiEQVFFXcuON05kKQ

Am not gonna  bore you with a lot of small details about the visit , i just want to tell you about the so called "" FOOD"" 

The buffet presentation was great, lots of great color in their food and a large variety. 
two thumbs up for the Dr. Pepper soda.
I couldn't wait to try the Pot Roast and mash potatoes/w gravy.
the pot roast was ok but had a starchy taste. 
The mashed potatoes were GREAT cafeteria food it reminded me of the Sears dept store in Los Angeles, Ca off Soto St. back in the late 60's early 70's.
the brown Gravy had me burping for a few hours, yes i kept tasting it HOURS later.
the cheese bread was cold and dry  
OMG, THE MEATLOAF was actually NO MEAT AT ALL it tasted more like soy and fillers... NO BUENO !!!! its more like MUT loaf if you dare give it to your pet. 
fish in sauce was BLAND, BLAND , YUCK
the breaded fish was deep fried 10 minutes too long ! Not edible.
I had to actually SPIT OUT THE GUACAMOLE in a napkin, ITS NOT AVOCADOS its green but NOT AVOCADOS. I REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS. very GROSS !
deviled egg had paprika sprinkled on top but the nicely whipped egg yoke was BLAND, BLAND, BLAND NO SPICES AT ALL.
clam chower was watery and salty and NO CLAMS , it looked like chowder humm
if you LOVE ENCHILADAS like i do OMG be in for a surprise... their filled with
NACHO CHEESE SAUCE !!!!  Whos idea was this !!!!  REALLY PEOPLE @ GC ! 
I took a picture of my plate and you can see that id only took one bite from everything i was TRYING TO EAT.  and the napkin that was on the side of my plate was food that i had put aside because i didnt want the yucky stuff on my plate. 

This was my FOOD EXPERIANCE @ GC... 
PEOPLE , JUST KEEP DRIVING !!!!
I never liked Hometown Buffet and i cant stand Golden Corral. Sizzler is ok..

Ok so heres the boring stuff if you care to continue reading my review.

The waitress came to our table and  ask ""hows everything "" and i spoke up and told her that this was NOT what we had expected she could seen that look in my face and said, i cant do anything about it but i will get the manager...
The manager comes to our table and gives us his ""song and dance"" about ""US""  being the first customers EVER to COMPLAIN about HIS food. (obviously he had his guard up before he came to our table) he bragged about how HIS customers have complimented him on HIS food. Hes sooooo surprised that our palate was different from others  ( HUHHHH really dude)  but hes absolutely right about that WE KNOW THE QUALITY OF GOOD FOOD ! 

This place is for people that dont care about Real Flavor in their food and for the most part i cant help but to think that people that like this slop "" DONT KNOW HOW TO COOK"" 

I cant comment on the other foods only because we didn't dare  go back for another SLAP TO THE PALATE !  
We were in and out of their so quickly , it was like being on an episode of  THE TWILIGHT ZONE..
It was indeed a frighting experience.

 Its taken me longer to write this review than the actually time we were their . 

The manager gave us a refund, but its not posting as of yet  in our bank account.

Is it possible to give a restaurant NO STARS?

I've gone to this restaurant a few times since inception at the Puente Hills Mall location and the more I come to eat, the worse the customer base becomes and the more disgusted I get.

While people were standing in line to be seated, they have already started eating with their hands - that means that bacteria they have on their hands will transfer to the serving spoons when to go for their seconds, thirds, fourths....  Then there's these people who are so happily thinking how cool it is to hold their strawberries before sticking them to the chocolate fountain... AGAIN, it's called ""spreading germs, people.""  The staff sees these issues and don't correct or replace the food.

Okay fine, you got me - even I love the chocolate fountain and cotton candy, happy? Best part of the place.

But need to bring up a few cons:
- Dear GC... WASH YOUR SHIZ. ALL OF IT. I MEAN IT. plates, silverware, cups - everything, gross gross GROSS, all the time. I usually have to go through 3 or 4 plate selections before I find one without a speck of old food on it. get Kanye and his golddigger to roll up their sleeves and do the dishes in the back... they'd probably be better than who you have now.

- the whole 'get your drink before you pay' thing is so annoying. it slows the (always endless) line down, makes it hard for people to hold a drink while digging through their purses for money, and makes it hard for the waiters to have to refill the drinks FOR you during your meal. 

Tips:
- if you want to go for dinner and not have to wait a half hour or more: aim for 6 - 6:30pm. Any later, and you might as well end up in the line for Space Mountain at Disneyland.",l8tv4Qp4z6kqv5kH27mVNg,4,1,3,NYii1PRyysmRnjS_UtHidQ

These ads were on some of the channels on Direct TV and was wondering why show these if no one can go to GC?  I figured one day they'll open one up locally and they are only showing commercials getting us ready to go when they open.  Driving on the 60 freeway to Fry's Electronics I could not believe my eyes, saw a GC billboard saying they are open in Industry.  Instantly I knew I had to go. Oh yeah I have a friend in Miami who goes to GC all the time.  So he said how good it was and when they opened here it was another reason to go.  Don't have to go to Miami for this! 

We tried to go one evening but there was a line about 40 people deep out the door so we skipped.  Well today we got to go for lunch.  Line about 30 people deep out the door but we said let's go any way.   Took about 30 mins to get to the register then we sat down.  

Was it all I expected?  Yes, I loved it so did my friend.   I saw some negative reviews, I didn't read them but from the lack of stars it's obvious some people didn't like the place.  Well the price was right and the food was great.  The employees there were very nice and helpful.  I can't see why I would not go again.  It's worth the wait in line in my opinion.   There is a good variety of food and deserts.  The fried chicken is perfect.  Golden crispy on the outside and really juicy inside.   I could go on and on about the different dishes.  I suggest you guys just go and try it out.  It's way better than Home Town Buffet.  What HTB has on them is they have an Icee Machine but so what, I love Icee but you know what the GC is far superior so I'll stick to GC.  HTB used to be really good though but over the years it started to become of less quality as it was years ago.

The location/place:
It is pretty large inside this location. As soon as you walk up to the door, you can smell the food from outside. When we arrived during lunch, the line was out the door, and it was packed inside. When trying to get your food, it is difficult to navigate due to the high amounts of people walking around. Overall, other than the crowd, it was clean, and the seating was pretty comfortable.

The food:
The food is really good. Everything was fresh and tasted great. They have a salad bar, meat area, and dessert area with three fountains. They have a chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel fountain. They have strawberries, marshmallows, and other things that you can dip into the fountains. They also have ice cream and cotton candy. I like the great assortment of desserts rather just the same stuff that they have at the casinos. 

The best foods that they have are the lasagna, rotisserie chicken, steak, roast beef, pizza, and the ham. Most of the food is good especially for the cheap prices.

I've been here twice so far on weekdays so I usually don't run into long wait times like others have said. The latest I've waited was 30 minutes. The second time I didn't wait at all. Service here is usually great and the waiters are pretty nice and attentive. 

Anyway, for the price you're paying, the food here is decent enough. I actually like the steaks here since I can always ask for the part of the steak with the most fat on it. Yes I'm a fat-ass but damn it, a medium-rare steak with a lot of cooked fat is like heavenly to me in terms of flavor. Also, the fried popcorn shrimp and fried jumbo shrimp are pretty good. Especially covered with the tasty gravy meant for the mashed potatoes. Did I mention I was a fat-ass? I think there was a fried fish dish they had there that was pretty good as well. 

I would avoid the Asian and Mexican style food since they're really really bland compared to the American style food. Honestly, that stuff is probably greasier than the fried chicken and shrimp they have. So eat American here. 

Protip: As two of my friends found out, there's a good reason why cotton candy is suppose  to be all cotton like: when you crush cotton candy into a ball and eat it, you'll probably get diabetes from the massive influx of sugar into your system at once. Also, chocolate covered cotton candy isn't all that good either as my friend figured out.

I realize however, then when you try to crossbreed a southern buffet chain, with California-type restaurant quality standards....things can get a bit awkward.  Imagine Honey Boo-Boo shopping in Beverly Hills....you get the idea.   I would imagine that much of the food and atmosphere decisions come not from the owners of the specific franchise in the City of Industry, but from the Golden Corral corporate office, who makes decisions based on their own standards of what is acceptable to serve.

FOOD:  I don't know if I have seen such a juxtaposition in a buffet - usually I find buffet food to either be all great, all terrible, or all mediocre.  There were some GREAT choices here....Hush Puppies (rare to see at a buffet!), Texas Toast (which I could just eat all day long), sauteed mushrooms, Bourbon chicken, all different kinds of salad options, hand scooped ice cream (also very rare to find in a buffet!), the chocolate fountain (with surprisingly good tasting chocolate!), and even cotton candy (especially great for the kids).  Now the bad....all of the Chinese food options!  I am not one who has particularly high standards for Chinese food, but dear Lord!  Do you know the expression ""chewing the fat""?  Well - now you can!  Just put some of their Chinese chicken options on your plate and start chewing!  The low quality of the Chinese options is surprising to me, especially since this buffet is located in a community heavily populated with Asian Americans.  This is what makes me think that food decisions are strictly made on a corporate level.  Avoid the Mexican options too.  We here in Cali know our Mexican food - and you can't call this Mexican food.  I don't know what kind of food you would call it....

ATMOSPHERE:  Of course because it is a buffet, we know the atmosphere is going to be (1) Crowded and (2) Loud.  So that is completely acceptable.  The buffet area got a little hectic when the steaks were coming out, and the people started lining up.  Even that was acceptable.  However, the booths had absolutely no cushion, so you are just sitting on hard plastic.  (Maybe this is to discourage you from staying too long?!)  Ouch!

SERVICE:  A+!!!!  The guys and gals that work here in such a stressful and busy environment sure have a great attitude!!  Everyone was so friendly and attentive, and service was given with a smile.  Our server was prompt refilling our drinks, and clearing our plates.  And not just our server, but every server in there had the friendliest dispositions!

I see so much potential in this place, but unless they can break away from their food quality products/standards set by their corporate office, they will just be mediocre.

SUGGESTIONS:  This place can be very crowded, with a line that can stretch out the door on the weekends.  Go early in the week (lunch if possible, but dinner is fine too) to avoid the crowds.  Oh yeah, be ghetto and bring your own bottle of either Tapatio or Sriracha chili sauce - you may need it, since much of the food lacked so much flavor!",47xz0CWxtPfdbTWjfreyKA,3,0,3,by3IL7pYb-4_gTayPuPpeA

1. Download onto google excel the menu/nutrition facts from their website. Highlight what foods have more than 2g of transfat and avoid (which is basically the hash brown and the entire pastry section)
2. Go early (around 10am) and there isn't a wait. 
3. After you pay, run into the omlette line and immediately get one. Get lots of spinach, onions, mushroom, bell pepper and some ham. Asked for EGG WHITE. Tip the guy making the omlettes. He works hard and is really nice. 
4. Get some side food: melon and cantelope.... and limited amount of bacon and breakfast casserole thing.... get some chocolate and regular milk
5. Go back to the table and eat omlette. Get back in line and get a second omlette.

I recall the curiosity as a kid. Some buffets seem to have lost their touch, this one, reminds me of the buffets I ate at as a child.

I came during the lunch hour, which, judging past reviews seems like the best time to come here. My wait was 10 minutes or so, the food was fresh and hot, as good as it can be for its style and genre, since it is not Wolfgang Puck.

I saw most or all of the foods depicted on their website.

Highlights:
--Cotton candy machine
--ice cream cone area
--Chocolate Fondue machine
--Areas labeled as Italy and Asia, a huge fruit and veggie salad bar.
--I enjoyed the chicken skin on the fried chicken, pork chops and brownies

Silly me, I did not see the fries, I also was too full to try the chocolate strawberries and the Mexican food.

Place looked clean, service was efficient and no issues today.

This is modern Americana in unlimited portions, nothing fancy, no foie grass, valet service, plate presentation or all of that. For what this is, a modern American buffet, I rate this pretty high. If I come back in the evening and the wait or quality is lower, my rating will go lower too.

I like to eat American, so I will be back.


Rick Derringer 1985 song ""Real American""

I like to eat American, pie for the plate of every one
I like to eat American, give me a slice, give me some fries!

When it has greasy fat and it goes with fries
After a juicy steak, give me apple pie
If you heard my friends, they say super-size
They want chicken wings, give me juicy thighs

I like to eat American, pie for the plate of every one
I like to eat American, give me a slice, give me some fries!

Flavor is strong so I write this song
Line is feet long but not a furlong
Buffets ring a bell inside of me
Hunger is what keeps, all of us yelping

I like to eat American, pie for the plate of every one
I like to eat American, give me a slice, give me some fries!

In Texas they have Golden Corral everywhere its no biggie.  However, people here seem to think its a really good place to check out.  

My advice is don't go unless you have 2 1/2 hours to waste.  On top of that its so annoying because 4739827432798 kids are running around unattended, making all kinds of noise.  The food wasn't even that great, I only went there thinking that they might have something different offered.  After finding out this location is like every other Golden Corral, I was very disappointed. 

The steaks were very hard to eat, after trying to insert my fork to begin cutting a piece.  The fork bent and felt like putting a fork in a piece of rubber.  The difficulties made my experience even worse, especially because 5 kids kept bumping into my chair and yelling in my ear.  I actually had to tell the parents to control their kids.

I don't care how inexpensive it is or how many people said it was delicious.  Because in that area there are plenty of nice restaurants with no wait time, and will fill you up the same way for $30 which I paid there.  The pasta was disgusting, the sauces were not even right.  There were a couple things they did well, everything that was a fried food and all the chicken.  

I would stay away from this place if your not trying to eat salty or greasy.  Because a lot of the dishes are heavily seasoned and very greasy.  The worst was the Spanish rice it was too salty to even digest.  Hopefully they improve their quality of the dishes, it shouldn't matter that a lot of people line up to eat there, and the restaurant is super busy.  The food & service should always be good regardless of how many people show up.

The staff does as much as they can it seems with the herd of people who line up and wait minutes and nearly hours just to walk in to the restaurant. Yes, this place is loud and can be messy but the atmosphere of the restaurant is due to the customers. Customers who are loud, who are uncivilized & whom allow children to roam free like loose cattle. Can give low stars on this account

As for the food it's better than the average buffet locations around. Remember this buffet food which is made in front of you for the most part unlike other places. Can't expect 5 star dining from a buffet restaurant.

Overall if you want to just hang out and possible wait a while to enjoy better than average buffet food come to this location. Expect the noise and rowdy crowd and expect to walk in to a buffet line.",YtNhdKd9qDCnqViC_ewM6Q,3,0,4,WBml4j5sCPOz3UzUy8SlFQ

I really like the ambience of the Golden Corral in Kingman, Az. But being that I live in Vegas/ Henderson and this is the only one out here I decided to come give it a try. Big mistake. Omg! When we first arrived they told us to seat ourselves. Mind you, we, as a group of 10. So we found an area in the back to fit maybe 6. I told one of the hostess that we needed another table to fit our group. His  response was ""well I just got here so you'd have to find one yourself and pull it to the your table"" ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! I DONT WORK HERE!!! I wish I could have gotten his name but his back was to us the whole time I never caught a glimpse of his name tag . He was an awful hostess/server whatever you want to call them. He never came to our table to check on us. Maybe he thought we weren't going to TIP HIM. I know how some small minded ppl think. Wrong!! I live here, I work here and I TIP here sir!! He kept going all around our table to the next tables. Finally we called another young man who happened to be passing by us to see if he could assist my family with our needs. I.e water, hot sauce, more juice etc. His name was Damarlo. I remembered his name because it was noticeably in my face plus he was so nice and so helpful. From that point on he was at our service. He did explain that he was out of his area by assisting us but he would be more than happy to help. He didn't want to step on anybody toes. There is NO TOES to be stepped on because nobody is helping us!!! It's all about customer service. We have elderly and children with us who needed attending to. Isn't that what our other hostess/server  job was to do? I didn't see where we could get the drinks and other things we needed from for ourselves. 
Back to attention at hand. The place is dirty as far as the floors and they half clean the tables once a group leave. Our table(s) were filthy. You know, the tables we had to seat ourselves at. I guess they wanted us to wipe them down ourselves too which was not happening. 
Tons of kids running around all over the place. You can barely walk to get your food without tripping over someone's kid. There's NO STRUCTURE what so ever!  And to add insult to injury they have the nerve to have girls making balloons for the kids as if the place isn't crowded enough. I can't lie, being that they were there I had to have balloons made for my kids too. It was only fair. That was totally by default. So at my already overcrowded area/table I have a balloon girl making animal balloons for my kids plus another 15 kids (from a whole other area of the place) pulling  and tugging on her to make them a balloon. Talk about HECTIC!! 
After our supposed to be server/hostess noticed that someone else was helping us with our drinks and other needs, he had the nerves to come ask us if we needed anything! Nope! You did a great job at ignoring us. 
I was so glad to leave this place I didn't know what to do. I definitely won't be going back, well wait.....Maybe if they build one in Henderson I'll give it another try. But until then... they won't get my business.",3tTWs8g4pDQZqpjJC8ktuA,2,0,3,5LhBFDZA8K3zcxpANljLzQ

First you drive past about 40 day workers in the home depot parking lot adjacent to this location to then park and stand in a line of people that goes out the entrance doors.

Then when about 10 people possibly the day workers from home depot meet up with the groups in front of you and you state you need to go to the back of the line and wait,as stated in the sign next to their face they reply with Que? As you finally stop arguing with the day workers and packs of their kids whom neither can articulate any form of response you walk in an see the elderly not being accommodated accordingly and the hombres and kids entering thru the exit doors so they don't have to wait in line. You get to the registers where you see families claiming the ages of children. Policy was great for 2 little kids per paying adults.

- such a mess! hard to find a table that wasnt full. it was just a loud crazy place. a very hectic experience

The line wasn't too bad before 6pm but after 6pm the place just got backed up and people were eating like the end of the world was gonna happen, Mayan-style!

The steaks here are very good for this level of AYCE.  The chef cooked mine about medium rare and it was a good medium rare.  It was so good, I came back for seconds.

The bread... omg... the bread rolls here are made fresh (I think all the bread are) and the honey butter is to die for!  The butter on the fresh bread is amazing.

I also tried the fried fish and fried chicken and its made Southern-style and it was pretty good.  It makes Hometown Buffet's like frozen food.

Overall, there is a freshness and quality that exceeds Hometown Buffet by light years.  It is as good as any AYCE buffet I've had at some hotel in Vegas.

The only problem I had here is that drinks have to be served by your waitress.  The problem with that is its so busy here and the poor waiting staff is just swamped.

It looks like they don't staff enough waitresses to get you your drink refills so it does take about 10 mins before they can get you your refills.

There was a wait of about 45mins for an odd hr lunch at 2:30pm, by the time you get in, it's about 3:30 ish. After the long wait outside in the sun, you still have to wait inside to get your food! It was so crowded inside and the food was not even good. Sorry to say that Hometown buffet is even better than this. 

They have basically the same type of food but this place has a ice cream station, grill station with steak and shrimp and fish (dinner only), cotton candy, and chocolate fountain. I can't believe that i didn't like anything there. The grilled pork chop and steak had no flavor besides the taste of charcoal, it doesn't even taste like it's been seasoned with salt. I got my piece medium, it was pink inside but the whole piece was still dry..why?? 

The best was probably the cook to order shrimp and fish at the pasta station for dinner. The pasta was soggy and wet, yuck. The shrimp and fish were ok, but come on, it's just sauteed with butter and cayenne. They only give you a very small portion at once. So if you want more, you have to wait few mins, and if there is a line, then good luck. 

Dessert, there is an ice cream and cotton candy line. Good luck on waiting b/c they scoop it for you. The line never dies down and they will scoop out the tiniest scoop of ice cream you'll ever see, so if you want more, go wait another 15 mins in line. But i say don't bother b/c it's not even good, as well as the chocolate fountain. Maybe my taste buds were already messed up after all the food i tried, so nothing was good afterall. 

For that price, i would pick Souplantation or Hometown over this anytime to prevent starvation and anger. And if you really want to see what the hype is all about, go in between lunch and dinner hrs so you can try both menus.",_dirj6bkyaMEm8uKMLcaYw,5,1,1,T1DrVvWla5ZkWG2MAeknNA

What are the chances that all of the vegetables on a buffet line would actually taste good?!? 
   After that on later visits, I've tried their other foods.  Their pot roast is really good.  I have enjoyed their different special items (on 1/23 they offered peach waffles).  I love their sweet potato casserole.

Golden Corral in Las Vegas has been months in the making.  Previous to this one now, the closest one is in Hesperia, CA (which I have eaten at and reviewed).  Silly me for taking my family to this new establishment on grand opening weekend!  Damn.

The line was LONG.  Like all-you-can-eat crab legs long.  We were standing outside for a good 30 minutes before we even reached the door.  Then it was another 15 minute wait through that line to get to the cashier.  By the time the family and I got to the front we were starving!  

I do realize coming on an opening weekend has its ups and downs.  Boy were there a lot of downs this day.  The place seemed to be beyond capacity, all tables were full of families dining.  With this, tables seemed to be pushed even closer together to accommodate more folks.  Our next table neighbor was literally no more than a foot or two from our table.  Talk about close quarters!  But we managed to make due.

Lines for the entire buffet were crowded.  Bad, but food was being replenished at a furious pace.  Good, because freshness helps.

After getting your silverware and favorite color plate (go ahead - blue, green, red, yellow) help yourself to endless amounts of food.  It's not much different than your average buffet in Las Vegas, and the quality and quantity ends up being right in the middle of the pack.  Think - better than your local Chinese buffet, but not up to par like Wynn or Bacchanal.  

There are three main sections in Golden Corral:

-On the left is the salad bar 
-On the right is the dessert bar
-In the middle is your main dining

I'll give them credit, their salad bar is pretty big for a buffet.  I found all the makings to make a decent Chicken Caesar Salad as well a Cobb Salad.  They even have bleu cheese crumbles!  

The main event at Golden Corral is good.  They have a good variation of food on their dining line.  You have foods that go the spectrum:

-American
-Italian
-Mexican
-Asian

With American you get your fried chicken, macaroni & cheese, catfish, and grill items like steak and cheeseburger sliders.  Yes, sliders!  This is my main reason for coming to Golden Corral.  Those damn sliders.  They are made of ground steak so the quality is actually very good.  I could eat a plate of these and a salad and be a happy man.  Line up for them though, they usually go very quick!  That day the tray was constantly being replaced, and halfway through our meal they ran out.  Good thing I stocked up and grabbed one for each family member!  And an extra two or three for myself...hee hee.  The catfish was also pretty good, fried fresh so they were crispy and not too oily.  I also enjoyed the fried chicken, as long as they were either leg or thigh pieces.  The breasts are a bit on the dry side.

The other food areas were just OK.  I didn't carb out with the pasta or pizza from the Italian station, and the items in the Mexican station were a bit bland.  Really, Golden Corral, you need to improve your Asian station!  Just like the one in Hesperia, not all Asian food has bean sprouts!  Ugh.  But at least your sesame chicken dish was decent.

The dessert area seems to be the biggest attraction for a lot of folks, especially kids.  Come on, cotton candy?  Are you serious?  The only other buffet here that might decide to offer it one day would be the Wynn (the buffet of fancy desserts).  So yes, everyone and their Mama had a cotton candy at some point of their meal.  Another big thing at Golden Corral is their highly advertised chocolate fountain.  In fact they have three:  milk chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel.  Great, have your kids dip candy in more candy...can you say DIABETES??  Oi.

I do keep it simple on dessert there, I like a scoop of ice cream (yes they have Breyer's or Dreyer's) and their banana pudding.  So easy but oh so good.  Who knew?  

Prices at Golden Corral hover around other buffets in our area, $8 range for lunch and $11 range for dinner.  We went on a weekend and hit some kind of all day dinner period so we paid the dinner price.  It was nearly worth it, but the crowds really detracted from the experience.  Hence, the 3-star rating.  I will be back, but probably not for a while until the lines die out a little bit.

But good show Golden Corral!  Welcome to the buffet capital of the west!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,16,4,3,Z7U0LUTCSiA2QmQQPDqm-Q

Was a major let down.

There was a crowd out the door which was fine, took us about 30 minutes to get seated. No Problem. Waiter was very nice(which is I gave a bonus star).

The food however was a complete letdown. It was cafeteria quality at best. The salad bar was decent but I would warn people away from the shrimp topping. 

Sadly quality control is pretty substandard. We noticed some funny tastes and when we inquired about it we were told that all fried food shared the same fryers & oil...really added a gross fishy taste to everything that was fried. 

I guess the biggest draw here is the steak seeing as when we left the line was wrapped all the way to the desert bar. Funny thing is, the steak wasn't that great.

Other than the sirloin steak, everything was the same. Guess it was chicken night: chicken wings, fried chicken, roasted chicken, bbq chicken. And of course the ever wonderful side dishes:  corn, mashed potatoes, gravy, Brussel sprouts, spinach and smoked ham (which were Sandy, they should have washed the spinach several times). Salad bar with the normal sides and the desserts with ratchet kids poking the chocolate fountain. 

So I asked the gentlemen working the grill for a medium rare steak. No surprise there, he pokes and prods, but to my dismay when I get to the table and slice into the low grade steak, again a perfect medium well. I know this place is in the east side of town and it shows in customer service and the integrity of how they make the food. I didn't even want to touch the plated desserts knowing the fact these ratchet ass kids stick their dirty ass fingers in the chocolate, who knows if they sucked on the pineapple and tossed it back in the bowl, cause quite honestly, that's what it looked like. I just decided to stick with butter pecan ice cream, I mean who wouldn't, it's enclosed so the person who works the dessert station has total control of serving!

Other than the fact it was raining outside,  and an older gentleman knocked out into a seizure, dinner with the family was okay. Our server, a bit on the slower side on picking up dirty plates and refilling drinks, understandable that there were 8 adults, 2 teens, a child, and an infant. And a couple other tables to service. But half the time, our server wasn't even seen. Knowing the fact this is Vegas, with the large selection of better buffets to go to, it wasn't my choice to come to this ratchet restaurant, for that price of $15 and some change per person, I'd stuck to the strip, Main Street Station isn't bad on Saturdays.

I always get mac n' cheese from any buffet and it was ok, I liked how i can faintly taste the cheese. as other places it's just like a watered down cheese. The chicken was nearly tasteless to me.

I grew up in the South so I'm partial to Southern style cooking, and Golden Corral is THE place in town that can get me my fix when I'm craving old fashioned pot roast, fried chicken, boiled cabbage and green beans. They prepare and season their veggies in the true Southern style and they are pretty darn close to the ones my grandmama used to make for Sunday supper. That's why this place brings back warm memories for me and that's why I love it. 

I've dined at Golden Corrals all over the country, and the one here in Vegas is one of the good ones. The food is always tasty, fresh, and the restaurant is clean (especially for a lower end buffet). As long as you don't come here with unrealistic expectations about fancy food and five star service, you won't be disappointed. Are you going to get James Beard Award quality steak? Food Network worthy desserts? No, of COURSE not! But you ARE going to get down home country cookin' that will warm your belly. 

It can get crowded at peak mealtimes but the line tends to move quickly.

This was the first visit for all of us. We were a party of 5, and arrived early because people told us the line was long and we should plan on waiting a while before being seated. We walked in the door with a big sticker that said ""We're glad you're here"" and there was not a single person ahead of us. Walking up to the register I would have expected a greeting along the lines of ""Welcome to Golden Corral"". Instead the cashier snapped ""You have to get your drinks first"". 

I understand that some buffets do not include the drinks, and I am OK with this. But I do not appreciate being misled. I also don't find this to be a friendly greeting. We paid and stood by a sign that said ""Please wait to be seated"". After waiting for some time the rude cashier finally told us we could take any seat we wanted. (Note to other diners: Signs here don't mean that much)

On the way to find I table I couldn't help look over the food, and was happy to see hand scooped chocolate chip mint ice cream and hot fudge. ... Let the dinner begin ... Again I will mention that the food was good. The service, however, was terrible. Drinks were never refilled, plates were never cleared. I was wondering if we picked a table without a server assigned to it, but there was ample staff working. 

Looking at the employees I noticed that nobody smiled. Not a single employee seemed to enjoy their job. This was a terrible place to work. Waiters and waitresses pushed their way through customers. Customers are nothing more than an inconvenience to the staff.

OK, time for Ice Cream!!! I stood at the counter, but the single employee behind that counter was rolling some balls of dough. Her back was to us and we could not get her attention. Yes, once again, customers are nothing more than an inconvenience to the staff. I gave up on the Ice Cream and went to the chocolate fountain. There was a single green strawberry and the chocolate was foaming. (I'll pass on that).

The cookies were good. A second trip to the ice cream bar was a waste of time, as there was more bread dough to roll.

Of the 5 of us, two people said they would come back despite the poor service. Myself and my date felt differently. We agreed never again. The 5th person was indifferent, saying ""I could take it or leave it"". Seeing how 60% of the Golden Corral's new customers have no plans on returning, I now understand why there was no line at the front.

In the restroom there is a sign that states: ""Employees must wash their hands before returning to work"". This scared me, as we already determined that ""Signs here don't mean that much"".",Jql0kDX77dWUZcRzGjPXLg,3,0,2,OXzODrLQJ5OKUHKx8ARYHw

After waiting in line, you walk in and pick up your drinks first - be warned: they cost extra - then you are directed to your table. The seating areas are rather cramped, so if you're a mommy who still carries around the carseat carrier, you might want to think twice about bringing it in with you. 

The food here is good because they have a pretty large variety. The salad bar is way better than at Hometown. As for the main courses, they offer things from Chinese spring rolls to Italian lasagna. I was confused by the spinach dip near the pizza. It's there, but the chips you use to dip into it is on the other side of the buffet. They could need some more organization with their food placement. The dessert was ok. The ice cream isn't all that special. It's like regular ice cream. They have the chocolate fountain as advertised, and they even have a cotton candy machine. Overall, the dessert isn't anything to get too excited about. 

The staff is nice and friendly. It gets pretty busy, so they run around trying to get everything guests ask for. They are also good about picking up the plates you're done with so you never have a pile of used dishes taking up space on your table. 

Overall, Golden Corral is just the new ""in"" thing that everyone's jumping on the bandwagon to try. It's just like when BJ's first opened. Eventually people will get tired of it and it'll be just another restaurant to choose from for Saturday night dinners.",IjhQ9EsxlgYLF3n_nLPyfg,4,2,4,f3Gi78FHcC--6411DFEvLg

I went a little before 4pm (Saturday), avoiding the dinner rush, and all I can say is I have nothing to complain about.  The only thing even slightly annoying was that they were apparently changing out the cash register drawers when I got there, and the registers were unattended for a couple of minutes, so I had to wait.

I didn't use the restroom; the rest of the facility was reasonably clean (especially for someplace so busy). Tables were being cleared constantly, and the floor was swept twice while I was there.

If the staff weren't overly friendly, at least they were courteous and competent. More than anything else, they looked tired. I'd guess anyone who works at GC works harder than at a similar-sized casino buffet.

Everything I had today was good.  Fried rice was better than last time. All the fried items I had were very good, especially the Southern fried fish.  The woody bottoms hadn't been trimmed off the asparagus, but other than that they were fine. I also had salad, fried chicken, mashed potatoes & gravy, hush puppies, BBQ ribs, mac & cheese, and a coconut creme tart.

I can't say I was disappointed, but this buffet definitely didn't meet all the hype that has been going around.  It's better than Hometown, but a pale comparison to many Vegas buffet like people claim.

The pot roast, shrimp dishes, and meatballs were good.  The rare piece of beef I asked for was actually well done side piece with a tad of red on the cut portion.  It was sort of dry and okay at best.  The desserts were too sweet, but I did enjoy the chocolate lava cake and the carrot cake with the frosting scraped off.

I heard that their food quality went down a lot as of late and it's pretty believable.

Gone would be the days of contemplating a drive to Kingman AZ or Hesperia CA to dine at what looks like a really great place.  Having now been twice within two weeks (against my better judgement), I can honeslty say I am let down.  I remember going to a Golden Corral as a kid.  It had the best baked potato bar around.  I can remember my family being so upset when they went out of business in SoCal.  This, however, is not the same Golden Corral I remember from back then.  It is just your average every day run of the mill over priced buffett with chceap food.  Not that it is all bad.  The salad bar is solid and seemed mostly fresh.  And the Ceasar dressing is on point.  The hot food though, hit and miss really.  The Bourbon Street chicken was perhaps my favorite dish of the night.  The orange pork was alright as was the sesame chicken but neither were anything worth writing home about.  The egg roll was small and chewy. The lo mein was made with the same noodles as the spaghetti.  That kind of threw me off.  Neither were the kind of noodles I think they strived to be. The meatloaf was smothered in ketchup the way my mom made it when I was a kid so that was nice.  The green bean casserol was good if for no other reason than it was covered with fried onions which happen to be one of my favorite snacks.  My dad and step-mom spent a few minutes discussing the sausage with bell pepper and onion trying to determie what kind of sausage it was.  The sign said it was Italian sausage.  If it takes two people immersed in conversation for five minutes and a third party to finally look at the sign to know for sure what it was, it was probably not the best representation of that food.  On to dessert, the bread pudding was awesome the first time I went while the cobler was not worth more than two bites.  The second visit had the bread pudding looking so horrible I just moved right past it and onto the pies. I got a slice of apple pie.  The apple filling was fine but the crust was not good.  It lacked flavor and the texture was dry and crumbly.  Not flakey likea good pie crust should be.  As for the chocolate fountain that seems to be like a signature of the chain, it seems very unsanitary.  You have this recirculation of liquid chocolate that sees children coating more than their desserts.  I saw hands going in there too.  Furthermore, these desserts are taken out of the restaurant leading to food sticks, food and stickiness all over the parking lot.  It was more sticky than a movie theatre floor.  My dad has said he will not be back and I have to agree.  In a town full of buffets, there are better quality options with better prices.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,3,2,vkLs5G7D0Pi0Tzdh2DDXpg

The long wait before you can even enter the restaurant could be a big dealbreaker for a lot of people, we waited for about 25-30 mins before we got seated, not bad at all.

The crowds inside the restaurant itself could drive a person insane, you want personal space, not in here, there is no personal space at all, everyone is in your face and walking in front of you, back of you, side of you, stepping on you, it's a mad house in there.

If you can get over these issues, the food is really good and there is something for everyone, you cannot go wrong. So much to choose from, it was awesome, I loved it.

Things you can do here:
--------------------------------
* Check out the choco fondue and cotton candy machine
* Eat the larger fried shrimp nearer to the Salad bar, than the popcorn shrimp found with the rest of the seafood selection
* Sit on the left side of the entrance if you have bladder problems
* Stuff yourself so much you can't grab Half & Half afterwards
* Celebrate your birdday here -- practically every table was doing it!
* Marvel at how packed the large restaurant is, and question whether the economy really is in a recession currently

Things to skip here:
--------------------------
* Haggle out of paying full priced $11.79 weekday dinners (+$0.20 on weekends)
* The Sirloin steaks -- I thought I was gnawing on a thick slab of beef jerky with a smokey aroma
* Expecting home-cooked, baked-from-scratch food -- The clam chowder tasted like it was heated straight out of a Campbell's can

The line got even longer as we waited. Crowded, hectic and large restaurant. Clean bathrooms. Good for large parties. Didn't have problem with parking.

Food: Almost everything I had was below average. For example, the orange chicken at panda express is better than golden corral. The person cooking the steaks was an amateur. Salad and fruit wasn't as fresh as souplantation. The only decent things I had was the pot roast, chicken wings, wheat buns and cookies and cream ice cream. A lot of their foods have trans fat. That is unacceptable. I made a list from the nutrition facts on their website and avoided those foods.

Service: Good and frequent. There was always a few people asking us what we wanted to drink. I prefer if they just have the soda machines out and we can help ourselves. 

Overall: I won't be coming back. Similar to home town and debatable which one has better quality. I'll stick with souplantation. We paid 13 per person and the value wasn't there.

(Just a warning, maybe some of you have not seen that yet.) Large parking lot. You pay before entering the dining area. You sit where you choose. Lots of tables and booths too. We came for breakfast.

Ok, it was better than I expected, but because of reviews here (average 3 star rating) and what I had heard from many other people who've been before, I didn't have high expectations (although my in-laws like it, but they don't dine out a whole lot, either). I can best liken it to a typical casino buffet, except with a chocolate dipping fountain. We went for breakfast on sunday, and it was rather empty at the beginning, but I did notice many patrons were of the bigger set (sorry, I am being honest). Towards the end as we were leaving, there were more and more people.

I didn't eat the mexican food or salad bar (pretty decent selection) because I didn't feel like it that morning. I am pretty picky at these types of buffets anyway (asian buffets included). I had the biscuit and gravy (don't get the ones sitting on the trays, rather get the ones laying on top of other biscuits; I didn't eat the bottom layer because it was tough). I also had the hash, eggs, a third of my husband's made-to-order omelette (that was good, but tends to be a little greasy), and a fried egg that my MIL gave me (they also do fried eggs, that is neat!). Our son had the ham and banana nut french toast with strawberry syrup. I don't know why there was no regular syrup option; all I found was the sugar-free bottles of syrup. Hubby had the potatoes, said it was really good, but the omelette was the best thing there (except the onions and peppers were pre-cooked and greasy). There is a dessert station: bananas, box cereal- two choices, rice crispie treats- cubes, mini carrot cake muffins, and hand-dipped ice cream. At 10:30 am, the macaroons were taken out. (Certain items get released at certain times.)

Juice (clear cups) is included- Minute Maid Apple Juice, Orange, Passion Orange Guava (POG), and another one but can't recall it right now as I am writing up this review. Red cups are for water.

There are a lot of choices, from stir fry to steak (cooked to order) to pot roast (holy cow- to die for) to cotton candy to orange chicken to pasta... pretty much something for everyone. WAY better than any buffet I have ever been to. My favorites were the steak, ham and pot roast. Least favorites were the bourbon chicken and the peach cobbler. 

The service is great too. Once seated, our waitress came and chatted with us a bit and was on top of refilling our drinks and taking our plates the entire night. 

A lot of people have a problem with the setup of the place, especially the whole wait in line- get your drink- pay- get seated thing... it really wasn't that bad. Actually, with how attentive the wait staff was, not being able to refill your own drinks wasn't an issue at all. And the line, especially near the registers, IS hectic... but only because it's really crowded and busy right now. I'm assuming that will die down and it will be a lot easier to handle.

Cons
-They don't have the bbq wings they're currently advertising, which was the whole reason we went there. We went during dinner hours, when the website says they have them, but they didn't. I asked if they were going to bring them out, and they said no.

-Girlfriend tried getting a well-done steak. The guy kept telling her to come back in 5 more minutes, which she did 5 times before we left without ever getting it.

-We had to wait in line for an hour and 20 minutes.

-The food was a slight step up from Hometown Buffet, but there wasn't much that you couldn't buy out of a box at Walmart.

-Total cost for both of us was $30 (2 buffets + 1 drink + tax) We should have just gone to Wingstop, where $30 would have bought us more than all we could eat, plus sides and dessert.

First of all pricing, is no great feat. at $11.99 + $1.99(Drink) you are looking at the same price as a buffet at one of the casinos... We knew this going in but people said that it was ""Southern Comfort Food"" so we should try it. 

Everything that they have at this buffet, except the chocolate fountains, is found at any other buffet in Las Vegas... for a better price and quality as well.... Their food is typical of a regular buffet and besides their chocolate fountains, nothing stands out. 

You seat yourself during the slow periods and then get seated during busy times. Alot of their items were out as well throughout the buffet including their deviled eggs and the pizza was empty every time we got up to get some.

4451580,2014-04-08,8,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Golden Corral has graced Las Vegas with its mediocre buffet in a city that is known for every casino, on just about every block, that has.... a buffet.

My husband and I decided to throw in the towel and try this place out. After months of seeing the parking lot full to the brim and lines out the door, we saw it wasn't TOO busy on a Saturday afternoon.

First impressions: You get your beverage before you pay, you are herded into the establishment like cattle, and lo and behold... you enter complete and utter MADNESS.

Pros - Selection is decent. Desserts are plentiful

Cons - Food is mediocre, the place is too small, and it is a mad-house. 

Apparently the Golden Corral does not do a good job telling its guests to corral their CHILDREN. Although there are signs posted that say, ""Children must be accompanied by adults at all times."", this suggestion is thrown out the window. Children run rampant in here without parental supervision, knocking into people, plowing their way into buffet lines. The adults here aren't any better. There's no rhyme or reason to how people get their food, there's no lines to speak of. It's an all-out brawl fest -- almost.

Cleanliness is an issue. My husband and I searched for a table and could not find a decently cleaned one, we had to wipe one down and remove dirty napkins just so we could have a place to eat. We also watched as a family with two small infants allows these children to sloppily plow through food and fling said food all over the floor - it was gross.

Overall - never again.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,15,4,1,lxzu3fBdSSC-3-stvCJ38Q

The food didn't please my palate. Perhaps I've been spoiled by Asian buffets. Even though we were seated near the chocolate fountain, I didn't dare eat from it. There were just so many people. Just too many people for my comfort and I felt a bit dirty eating there. Both adults and kids are so messy dripping or dropping food on the floor. The staff were quick to clean up any messes. The quality of the food was ok, almost like hometown.

I liked the strawberries because they were very sweet and I ate them by itself. Most of the stuff I tried was ok. Perhaps I would give this place a try again in the future, but at lunch time. Going there for dinner is expensive.",Itn_l0c5vKhnOlyESDOr3w,1,1,2,Vvz-bcRAT3mJcHkXtMrBqQ

After waiting for an hour, we finally arrived near the end of the line where I can grab my strawberry soda. After paying my cheap admission price of ~$12, I was eager to start my dinner with hopes it would be decent given all the hype. 

10 minutes later, I ate raw canned corn which were half cooked, a piece of steak that was rock solid when suppose to be medium rare, chow mein which tastes far from even mein, and lukewarm broccoli. It made me really appreciate the other bad buffets I have been too. This is by far the worst buffet I have been to. 

The floor was grossly dirty. Pieces of bread and meat lingered all over. Parents were letting their kids roam free, dropping ice cream and strawberries. I even saw a kid pick his booger out before using the same hand to grab a corn on the cob. Needless to say, I lost my hungry appetite FAST. 

The salad bar was not any better. The lettuce was not in cold temperature. The dessert section was mediocre with plain peach cobblers. Not worth the drive. Now worth the wait. Not worth the price. Just not worth it at all.",o2b3y3m4-sT4jUllCn2-oA,21,10,1,_1OaWo3MedRq-FfJVZmOqQ

4535218,2012-10-07,2,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"I hesitated about a week after coming to write a review on this place to let my thoughts kind of process. In conclusion, I feel my experience here wasn't anything that wow-ed me, to be honest. I heard about this place when it opened, but steered clear for the entire time because I heard horror stories about how atrocious the waits and lines were.

I came here last Sunday for lunch around 11 something and there was a line that snaked outside the door, ending just outside of the shaded covering. The wait continued inside to the registers and I would say in total...the wait was about 45 mins or so.

I had heard raves about how Golden Corral was comparable to a Vegas buffet and how it kicked Hometown Buffet's ass, etc, etc. And I felt that with the crazy lines this place had brought out when it first opened (and still, even a few months in with its opening), that this place had to have some sort of majestic charm.

To be honest though, I felt the fare offered here was alright. Definitely not on the level of a ""Vegas buffet"" as I had heard early on (although there are small things here and there to note). The interior design faintly mimics those of Paris Buffet and maybe even The Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood (you know, with the faux windows, awnings, and separate stations/buildings), but that's probably about it in terms of appearance. Now granted, the food wasn't bad or anything (there are even some small things that make Golden Corral better than Hometown, such as the corn here, which is plump and juicy) - overall the food is by far better than the quality Hometown Buffet serves up, but it's nothing that'll blow you away. However, I do like that there are some special things here, such as the machine cotton candy and coconut macaroons, and also the steaks, which are cooked right in front of you by a team of chefs - all these small things bring that higher-end feel (or ""Vegas feel"") to Golden Corral.

It's hard to say whether I'll be coming back or not. I used to love buffets so much when I was a kid, but I think growing up, I've come to be quite indifferent about them. Even with this review, I feel like something's missing - I'm not disappointed, but I'm not too impressed either.  I just don't know. I guess I'm just not the kind of person who'll want to wait in a long line for food anymore.

Service was great tables were cleaned up quick. i was surprised to learn you have to ask for drink refills but wait staff were on it quickly.
As mentioned in another review the people that frequent here, and I must say any buffet place, can really turn off your appetite. Coughing kids running around grabbing their own foods, loud large parties taking up to many tables, food hoarders pilling hefty servings on one plate. Seems like GC is just putting to many people in too small a place.

4635057,2013-08-05,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Finally made it to a Golden Corral... and found out that one of the reasons it's called that is because you're corralled into line just to get in.  Seriously, even though we showed up after 1 pm, we had to wait 30 minutes!  Sheesh!

We paid the lunch price ($8.99, not counting drinks) - if anything, most of the food was worth the wait.  I LOVED the Bourbon Chicken, the Sweet and Sour Pork, and their fried chicken liver and grilled beef liver, as well as the garlic cheese bread.  The dessert bar is also worth checking out - any place that has cotton candy and a chocolate fondue fountain as dessert options has my stamp of approval.

The negative two stars are for the size of the place - it feels very cramped - and for not being able to fill your own drinks.  Then again, the wait staff do a great job checking the tables and refilling your drinks (Chinese buffets, take note).

Overall, with more options than Hometown Buffet, I can see why Golden Corral is quite popular (especially as it appears there aren't many locations in So Cal).  Worth going to again... just maybe not on peak periods.",btKT25J7WJoWB1tPvF7ugw,3,3,3,bnPThV3NUM56p31be0wucQ

That's not really saying much though...both buffets are pretty crappy but let's divulge into greater detail here about Golden.   The fried shrimp, onion rings, and fish were pretty decent.  Looking through the batter, the shrimp were actually de-veined! That's pretty awesome for a buffet.  The fried fish was the typical southern type breading much like the one you can find at Boiling Crab.  The fish obviously wasn't as fresh but it tasted good enough with a shower of tartar sauce. AS for the steak, it's not super high quality but it does have a good charred off the grill taste to it.  You can request any sort of temperature depending on the supply on the grill.  I want to say for $12 dinner price, eating just the steak and shrimp is already a bargain.  The same meal at Sizzler's is probably $12+   I also tried some of the ribs, fried chicken, ham and everything was underwhelming.  Most of the these foods tastes typical cafeteria style with a mass produced sense of flavor and texture.

Did I seriously just write that? God I'm lame.

Anyway, this place feels like it's trying to be like a Vegas buffet without the glitz, the glamour and the drive to Vegas. Unfortunately, GC has also left a bit of the flavour and taste behind in Vegas too. 

I really shouldn't knock this place too much though. The food is fairly decent and some of it can actually taste kind of good (rice pilaf). Some of the other stuff is kind of under cooked (the bbq chicken). 
There's almost a smorgasbord of food-- almost that is.. 

There's the usual mexicanish station, the asianish station, the italianish station and the actual salad bar that always remains empty. 
There is also a chocolate 'wonderfall' and desserts that are too dry to eat. 

I feel like I'm being harsh, but in the end, I did give the place 3 stars-- It really wasn't THAT bad. 

Oh, well, I almost forgot to mention the crowds. This place is jam packed beyond capacity it feels. There's tons of people running around trying to stuff their faces with fried whatevers and cake. At least in Vegas you have people who can somewhat afford to drive out and go on a vaycay where they aren't so terribly rude. But over here, you are swarmed with people who just want to eat and if you don't get out of their way, they will eat you. Seriously.

Other than that, the server we had was sweating bullets from running around and trying to clean things up, refill people's drinks and do whatever else he could possibly do. Poor guy. He deserves a raise!  I think his name was Chase. Anyway, he worked his bootay off running from table to table and did his best at handling who knows how many tables. His service alone would make me bump this place to 3.5 stars/5 maybe even 4. 

Overall, this place.. I mean.... if you really want to experience it, I say go for it. But don't expect a spacious dining experience where the food is outstanding and the chairs are comfy.

Plus you get to go home with a bag of free rolls which are delicious with butter and heated up! :) Our server was very pleasant and cleared our table when needed as well as refilled our drinks upon request. The only other problem I have is the cashier in the front who talked to us like we were five. I can clearly read ""red cups are for water"" just fine. She explained that to us like we couldn't understand English or something. Well, maybe you should put a bigger sign propped up some place rather than have a little not post it size note on the table where the soda machine sits.

4890417,2013-01-02,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Let's get this straight, it's a buffet.  You don't expect 5 star food at a buffet.  If you have been to any buffet, chances are there will be a line, this place is no exception.  You do want decent food though at the very least, which means roughly 3 stars.  The price point, the quality/freshness, and some items, namely the steak, make the place a good deal at about $12 for dinner.

Off the top of my head and what I could remember they had fried chicken, mash potatoes and gravy, some kind of sesame seed carrots, green beans, pepperoni and cheese pizza, french friess, meat balls in marinara, spaghetti, fresh grilled sirloin steak, carved turkey, carved ham, bbq chicken, quesadilla, refried beans, guacamole, butterflied fried shrimp, fried shrimp, rice, fried rice, egg rolls, jalepeno muffin, corn bread, dinner rolls, sweet sticky buns, potato salad, pasta salad, salad bar whatever that entails, chocolate fondue, pies, a cake, cotton candy, soft serve ice cream, and regular scooped ice cream which I think was rite aid/thrifty's brand.

So again, for $12 dinner, it's a good variety that will get you full.  With so many people eating here, the food is constantly fresh.  The sirloin steak is where it's at if you want to get your monies worth.  Topping the meal off with cookies 'n' cream ice cream makes this place a-ok in my book.",9bRBCyXjy_KDNyshDpG3ew,3,0,3,VTf8eJoXSr5z4yts5Bytww

   We visited this location on a Saturday around 6pm. Normally I know its dinner time and its going to be a bit busy I can deal with that. But this place needs to do get their act together.

   The management/owners really need to get a clue on how to run a business. I saw more shirts just standing around and being useless then I have ever seen. The older lady who I presume is an owner just runs in circles. Her staff has no guidance at all. Tables full of trash floors dirty and people having to get up and get their own drinks, as no one is doing anything. the place is somewhat busy but one or 2 people doing anything. I can not tell you how many times someone walked by us and didnt even take our trays. but would look right at them. 

   Took for ever to get drinks refilled, and again the managers just standing around trying to hold up the building or something. Or off chatting with people instead of getting the staff to get the jobs done.. The only people working seemed to be the cashier and the cooks.

4922353,2012-05-20,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"This is one restaurant where its popularity makes the dining experience hectic and frustrating despite the great food.

Before this one opened last month (April 20, 2012), I went to the one located in Hesperia, CA, 65 miles away from me. It was just as hectic during dinnertime because it was the only one located in the central part of Southern California, so consequently, everyone from LA had to travel there to eat. Now that the Industry restaurant opened, all the LA customers now go there instead of Hesperia, giving that restaurant a little more breathing room. With the Industry location now being the only LA County one, it is naturally going to be crowded until they build more locations. People need to be aware of this and plan their time accordingly... best time to go is around 11am, and around 4 PM, before the crowds really show up. Forget it if you go there at dinnertime on the weekends. You could conceivably wait over an hour to get in. The line outside gets quite long.

The design of the interior is the same for all of the Golden Corrals. Various stations include salads, soups, Asian, Latin, Grillhouse, Italian, Breads, and Desserts. The BIGGEST problem that Golden Corral needs to address is its Grillhouse. The line waiting for the grilled meats can get quite long and the people block access to the Italian section and desserts. I think they should reverse the direction of the waiting line and place them in a roped off stantioned area to give people access to the rest of the food while the people in line get their steaks and fish.

The food itself is tasty and tastes the same as other Golden Corrals which is what makes people come back.... you get the expectation of the good food and in that regard, you are not disappointed.

Ironically, the general manager of this location is Robert Sheldon, former GM of the nearby Hometown Buffet when the food USED to be good. After Mr. Sheldon left to go work for Golden Corral, the HTB food has been steadily going downhill and I personally feel that this GC will be the death knell for the Industry HTB.

EDIT:  My prediction came true... Hometown Buffet closed... In its place is now an Asian Hot Pot style restaurant.",4VQvh-1LCGprldPcFkcjug,3,0,4,gAY4hXK19oS28ukqaChQ2g

Their seafood is cooked to order although too much butter is used in the sauce. Their steaks are grilled to order too so you can get either medium rare all the way to well done. The food is very fresh. The desserts are high quality too and there is a good diversity to them. The price is not bad for dinner at $11.49 (not including drinks) for so much food diversity.

A few of the reviews talked about the place being dirty. The only areas that were messy and dirty were by the tables of people who didn't know how to keep their stuff on the table. The staff is courteous enough to wait for them to finish eating before sweeping up their mess. So the mess and the dirtiness can only be attributed to the messy people that go there otherwise the place is clean. It got really busy and full quick . The  trays they put out are not so big and not so deep and with the amount of people that come in you can be assured that everything is hot, fresh and has not been sitting there for hours.
The other reviews compared Golden Corral to Hometown Buffet, in ways it is by the type of food they serve. There was nothing there that was exciting. The usuals  spaghetti , lasagna, fried and BBQ chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese the usual All American diner stuff. The difference between Hometown and Golden Corral is bigger selection and quality. The biscuits are 3 times the size, the BBQ chicken are leg quarters instead of small thighs. The dessert  selection is huge and the servings are big. 
The food tasted good it wasn't bland  but it is also wasn't different. The cakes were too sweet but they had many to chose from. I was looking forward to the steaks, wings and the chocolate fountains. They didn't have the steaks or wings when I went. The fountain presentation was not as cool as I imagined it to be.

Soda or tea is about $2.00, and I think dinner was around $15. After you pay, you tell the lady how many people are in your party, they direct you over to your table, and then you begin to gather your food like the hungry animal that you are.

They have a variety of items, the steak is grilled in front of you and you tell the chef how you like it, medium rare actually came out medium rare, which was pretty good for a bland steak. They have hot wings that are pretty good, but the garlic hot wings tasted exactly like the regular hot wings, not sure if the chefs just dumped it in and hoped people thought they were different. The pot roast and meatloaf weren't bad, they actually have murals showing you their cooking process. Fried chicken was semi dry, but it was cruncy. Chicken noodle soup was good, but barely any chicken, and they never refilled the clam chowder.

5112180,2012-10-05,1,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Mark this as another chapter in ""What were you thinking???!!!!""   This was our third time to the Golden Corral.   The last time was in Hanover, Maryland.  As tourist in Maryland, we were full of crab cakes before we ate at the Golden Corral.  So this time should've been different.   Wrong again!   The coworkers took me to Seoul Garden in Tustin for my birthday lunch.  Seoul Garden is a buffet.  The coworkers and I ate so much, that I was still full from lunch at dinnertime.  But, the wife and daughter needed to celebrate my birthday.  I was thinking Osaka Seafood Buffet, but, with me being so full, I thought Golden Corral was a better and cheaper choice.  I am not sure if it was a good choice.  

The Good:   The Cashier.  I told her that I wasn't hungry and that she should give me the Senior discount.   She did.  The fried chicken was good.  

The Bad:  The steak.  I asked for rare, and got medium.   I tried again, and got it raw.  Also bad was going there when you are not hungry and wasting $11.  The waiter forgot to bring us water.   I had to ask him twice.   

The Ugly:   The disabled lady that my wife saw take two bites out of a biscuit while waiting in line, and decided she didn't like it, and puts it back with all the other biscuits.    It is weird to see that I am one of the skinniest people in the Golden Corral (and I am not skinny).  Even though this place is owned by an Asian, as evidenced by the incense that they burn outside in the front planter, and the plants with red ribbons given as a gift for their grand opening, they really should'nt be following the Golden Corral's recipes for Chinese food.   You can't serve imitation Chinese food with so many Chinese restaurants in the vicinity.

The last two visits to the Golden Corral have been a waste of time and money.   I may have to give them another chance.  

If you come on a weekday before 6PM, there is no wait.

There is a good selection of food items, and they usually change up the featured dishes every so often and include specials during the holidays. 

I have been here several times, and haven't been disappointed. My favorites from my most recent visits are the BBQ chicken flatbread, Smokehouse BBQ pulled pork with choice of 4 different BBQ sauces, my fave sauce is the South Carolina vinegar!!!  

On the weekends till about noon or 1pm they have breakfast items and an omelet station. I usually go here on Saturday and Sundays. 

TIP: Come in during that time so you get a choice of both, breakfast/brunch and lunch items! 

There are a lot of options and you can easily craft your plate to fit low carb or Keto diets, or at least be Keto friendly. I've shared some photos of my Keto friendly plate creations. 

Great service here from almost all the employees except one. He's been rude on several visits so we avoid sitting in his section. 

I can't wait till they finish the Henderson location! It would be much closer for me.

First of all their selection is great. Feel like eating a salad? (Who are you people anyways?) A steak? Chinese? Mexican? Italian? Sea food? They got you covered. 

If you're like me and make a beeline to the steaks, I'm happy to report that they're delicious. Comparable to Black Angus and they're a steak house.

They also have all kinds of bread, desserts, ice cream and the famous chocolate fountain. 

Service is also excellent. Our waitress was very nice and friendly. 

Overall a great experience. I just wish they were closer to me (they're about 30-45 min away). On second thought though, it's probably better for my waist line that they're not.

I'm not sure what possessed us to do this.  Maybe the long line inspired some mysterious image of deliciousness waiting to reward our patience.  Sadly this was not to be.  

To add insult to injury we had to wait another 20 minutes after walking in the door all the while enduring a gauntlet of sodas, iced teas, and juices BEFORE finding out at the cashier that it's extra.  And to throw some salt on that wound it's Pepsi.  

Once inside you would imagine being grateful to get off your feet but the harsh lighting and the crowded spaces has all the ambiance of a maximum security prison cafeteria.  Don't make any sudden moves.  

As others have stated the rice is mushy.  All the fish related stations were way too salty.  Tartar sauce was the standout.  Steak was actually ok but it is SO GREASY.  It's sitting in a pool of grease and then it's flanked with big blobs of fat to boot.  

The way the food is arranged creates the illusion that there is more variety than the other behemoth buffet chain but it turns out they string out the food so only one side is accessible meaning more people have to crowd around and wait and there is actually probably around the same variety.

Bottom line: don't let the long lines fool you.  You're better off going elsewhere.   Seriously.",-27rekPBmkhUhoMMxXDXJg,4,1,1,RHsIhKi9D4rR-O5y5t_FdA

5321984,2014-02-14,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Went to Golden Corral tonight at the recently opened location in Las Vegas.  I had never been to a Golden Corral before and didn't know what to expect, although I had done some research before hand.

My wife and I wanted lunch as to avoid what we figured would be a large dinner crowd, so we arrived about 2:30.  It was quite busy, with a line at the cashier stand, however the line moved quickly.  The major bottleneck is the beverage station, it slows forward progress as diners fill their glasses.  As long as you're going to have servers that re-fill your drinks, you might as well have them serve the initial drink to avoid the delay at the front door.  

The price was good, I'm used to two-for-one deals at the casino buffets, so it was weird paying for both lunches, but the pricing was reasonable.

We were able to find a table with no difficulty, as it was seat yourself at that time.  The restaurant was clean, and tables were bussed frequently, with no piles of dirty plates or napkins cluttering the tables.  

The food was very good, some items were a little bland for my taste, such as the mexican dishes weren't as spicy as I would have liked.  The meatloaf was a hit for me and my wife, which we consider the best meatloaf of any buffet.  The steakburger sliders were very good too.  

We were very pleased with how often the food is rotated, I didn't see any old or dried out food on the buffet line.  We had to be careful when eating because the food was very hot, which is a plus!  I also like how you can watch the food preparation as you're eating.  It's nice to watch them cooking as your eating so you know the food is being handled well, and prepared fresh.

The desert area was very good as well.  Although it's hard to get to the fountains because of the volume of people trying to use them, it's almost always wall-to-wall people at the desert counter.  I can highly recommend the hand scooped ice cream too.

Lastly, everyone, even the other diners, were very friendly.  Everyone was observing proper line etiquette, and excusing themselves.  Not jumping in line, waiting patiently.  Such a nice change from buffets where the norm is the ""entitled"" elite who think they run the world and you must allow them to cut in front of you and in general ignore you.  It's nice to be seen and to be acknowledged and to use the people skills our parents taught us.  Oh, and there were a lot of servers, buss persons, and staff keeping everything running very smoothly.

As long as things stay the same at this location I'm quite sure it'll remain our favorite buffet in Las Vegas.",fsLjz-J6Wqim0AR-hKFX4w,9,0,4,8cR_ffWKya_qnqX_du9OBQ

There was no line at 8:30 in the AM. Price was only $9 for all-you-can-eat buffet. Everything was pretty good. 

Here's what I ate and I'm proud of it:
Fresh waffle
fried chicken (there's two kinds, get the one with the smoother looking batter)
smoky sausage 
grits with brown sugar and butter
oatmeal
eggs
fresh fruit
slice of boysenberry pie
coffee

Does not mean I took fat ass portions of each like some patrons were doing then wasting the food to go up and get other items. That's just disgusting and irresponsible eating practice. I think etiquette and portion control is out-of-control. The amount of wasted food is incredible at buffets. 

This place was decent for the price. It was probably a better experience since my grandparents are in town and my brother was here telling interesting stories. My family rocks!

Tried to get dinner a couple of times during evening but line was out the door. $8.50 for lunch $11.50 for dinner and then add fountain drinks for additonal $1.99. One of friendliest staffs you will come across. Won't be a regular for me, too many other places to eat at in Vegas. Food is well prepared and displayed. Easy to over do it here and you will be surrounded by by those on a mission to get their money's worth. Seating is a little ackward and cramed together. It has an industrial or chow hall feel but the creew keeps it neat and clean. Worth checking out at least once.

I HATE buffets so much!!! I only go to one when we have our ""family dinners"" at one. I dread going to HTB because the food sucks...it seems like it's been sitting out all night and day...my mom yells at me when we would go to HTB and I would just make a salad. LoL.

Anywho....we went to GC and I liked it. So much more to choose from and food is actually hot!!! The fondue is to die for...I limited myself to 2 chocolate dipped strawberries!!! I had to or otherwise I would be like Homer Simpson and stick my whole face under it! 

I was confused about the drinks at the entrance (before you pay)...not sure why they do it that way but it seemed ok. The servers kept coming to our table, my drink was never empty...and they actually have DR. PEPPER!!! SCORE!!!! 

The only thing I didn't like was their ""chinese food."" The chicken was way too hard!!! And their management sucks...and so do their ""rules."" Your whole party has to be in line to get a table. If you're missing one person from your party, they will not seat you, or they will seat you but not give you a spot for the person(s) missing from your party. And you cannot ""pre-pay"" for other people in your party. Ugh! This sucks for huge Mexican families who are never on time...like mine! LoL. 

Bottom line...I would go back to this buffet joint. Nice....veddy nice....",kkQ9FMBJssaaVARSyB5SIg,7,0,4,0RaSi8I3gNdUEm_As3avVA
5511444,2012-05-08,2,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"I had to see what the hype is all about, with the line out the door every single night since it opened up a couple of weeks ago.  Going in, I didn't think the Corral would live up to my expectations.  Coming out, I decided it didn't, and I will not be returning.  And to be honest, if I had to choose, I'd much rather take my money over to Hometown now that it will be less crowded OR starve. 

We arrived five minutes to 6, and the line was already out the door.  We waited a good 20 minutes before we made it to the cash register.  We were able to take advantage of the 2 for $20 special.  The promotion starts after 4 pm, Monday thru Thursday.  The third person had to pay the regular price, eh, no big deal.  We were seated fairly quickly after we paid.  

Food was just okay, maybe slightly better than HTB, but not by much.  That cotton candy machine brings a nice touch to the dessert station, but it is super sticky that I did not bother with it.  Everything else was overly sweet.  

Service was just okay as well.  Our server forgot to refill my brother's soda, and she never bothered to ask if I needed refill with my water.  I think the drink station should be made accessible to make things easier for all of us.  

I can't say I was too disappointed with this place as I didn't have high expectations to begin with.  So if you go in with that attitude, then you'll be alright.",hHP_kNRp793DIOfkqCHVNw,3,1,2,by94AHQLg7vVCB4LcZ8Dkw
5512916,2014-07-08,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Like many of the other reviews, we saw the commercials and heard great things about Golden Corral. So today we were committed to try it out. When you first pull up to the restaurant, there are day laborers relaxing under the trees because the Home Depot is right there. No big deal. The second you walk in, you are hit with the realization that you just walked into the lions den. Ghetto is the only word that comes to mind, and it's not even a fair understatement.  Ratchet people everywhere.  Then, for someone who hasn't been there before, you have the fountain drink station before you even talk to anybody. So we asked the cashier for instructions. She said to get either the disposable fast food type plastic cups with lids and a straw or use the reusable cloudy plastic cups... I went with the disposable solely because of the area and uneasiness I felt. So I end up paying $25 and some change for my wife and I. You seat yourself. Don't wait for someone to come and seat you to a table, you will be waiting for a long time. When I asked the cashier where the straws were, she told me that the waitress will give them to you when you sit down at a table... I'm sure this is to control people from walking in, grabbing a drink, and leaving without paying. Again, very ghetto. So we go and start looking at the food and to my pleasant surprise,  all of the food looked fresh and rather good. So we start filling up our plates with small portions of everything they had to offer. Everything my wife and I ate was actually very good. Surprisingly enough, the pizza was really good and I had extremely low expectations due to the quality of pizza being served at casino buffets. My wife really enjoyed the pot roast. We ended up having two plates of small portions each and everything except the chicken fajitas was awesome. Skip on the chicken fajitas... Trust me. Then we move on to the desert section, my favorite part. Everything looked extremely well plated and delicious. I had some of the soft serve ice cream, the banana pudding, and a piece of white cake with strawberry flavoring. Very good. All in all, the food is better than every casino buffet in my opinion. I am born and raised in Vegas and have eaten at most, if not all, of the casino buffets and they just don't compare. Why 3 stars? Solely because of the environment.  The cashiers are all ratchets, the cooks are ghetto and can be heard cussing and street talking behind the cook line. Very unprofessional.  If they could pick the entire building up, dump the people out of it, and transport it to say summerlin or even a little farther west, we would definitely go back. If you're a female,  I suggest not going by yourself or at night. Wish they would open another one in a much better area, they would have much better workers and guests. When your business is in the ghetto, you have ghetto guests.",5QGBCJ1B3Adva7ocoWPRXw,0,0,3,12L0mMQ4xNFfThuGC6Pj3A
5514447,2012-09-24,10,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Let me start with the silverware- they're not clean! Luckily they had packaged disposable forks, knives and spoons.

I usually don't eat steak because I like it dry and burnt, surprisingly it was cooked right to my liking, no pink baby. That's probably the highlight of my meal. That and the freshly baked yeast rolls. So yummy, you don't need the extra butter to mess it up. Green beans  were canned and overcooked. The fried chicken didn't have enough flavor. The shrimp had too much breading, and the fountain drinks seemed to be on their last leg. I now know why kids hate Brussel sprouts, they were horrible!

I almost forgot, the cheddar cheese biscuits were good. I love chocolate, but sadly their chocolate dessert offerings from cakes, pies and the famous chocolate fountain did not do it for me. Of course on the way out, who can resist the hand-scooped ice cream? I had the Butter Pecan, so creamy, I was so happy I left room for it.

5516509,2015-06-06,8,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"I'm not a Golden Corral kinda person- I was raised on ""classier"" (read: pricey) places, so I've been a bit of a restaurant snob. However, being a snob means you miss a lot of great places. Some are great for their atmosphere, others for the service, others for the food- or some combination of these. When I came to Vegas I was a bit disappointed in the places that get lots of stars and praise. Even my non-snobby partner has been sorely disappointed in the seafood and soul food places we've visited. 

Today we tried the Golden Corral. I'd been to one in Ohio and don't have a lot of good memories- except for the fun company I was with. I expected low quality fare and general unpleasantness. I was pleasantly surprised. 

Now, the atmosphere is nothing to write home about. The money here is not being spent on decor and dinnerware. Or bathroom maintenance. It was crowded as heck tonight, but this allowed a lot of people-watching, which is fun in a place that attracts such a wide range of humans. I like seeing people enjoying themselves. There were lots of young children, toddlers and some babies with parents and grandparents. 

I've been to several buffets in town, on & off Strip. I'm usually disappointed in the local casino buffets. The food isn't well flavored and the desserts all seem to come from the same bland supplier. Little of the iconic fare, like Mac & cheese, taste anywhere close to authentic. 

Golden Corral has them beat by a mile. The food tastes like your grandma invited the family for dinner, and then stuck her FOOT in it! (some of you will know what that means). Fried chicken the chefs weren't afraid to season properly. Buttery mashed potatoes with a few lumps instead of being perfectly puréed to death by machine. Crispy hush puppies and fried shrimp. Whole catfish! Well, without the heads. Even the fried calamari tasted good. 

Now, grandma does make some greasy food- but those hush puppies! Perfectly fried. I'm not into the slightly sweetened hush puppies but I forgave grandma and went for more. The fried okra was very good with no nasty okra-ness (it's okra, after all). 

Parents seem to let their kids run around here- something I haven't seen at the casino buffets I've been to. I saw one young girl skipping through the crowd while innocently holding a steak knife, point-side up. 

Dessert was more creative than other buffets. A chocolate fountain with humongous, sweet strawberries on sticks to wave underneath. Marshmallows and macaroons are also available.  They had the standard soft ice cream, cookies and cake slices, but they also had real ice cream, sherbet, and freshly made cotton candy. All the food was fresh, by the way. 

Anyway, we hung out for over two hours because we had time to kill. Our server was excellent (hey, Nickie!) and we tipped her well to make up for the measly $2 tips she was getting from others and the time we spent. I can honestly say I was comfortable, had a good time, and actually enjoyed the food.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,14,6,4,0phE-HM_0oYq48pPic0x2A

5551798,2014-04-14,0,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"Immediately upon entering the building, I was turned off by two things:  1. You have to go through a line with rails like an amusement park.  2.  As you approach the register..still in line.. you have to get your drink at the fountain.  It ends up the people drink what they initially filed up, then trying to go back you fill their cup again.  It was definitely annoying.

I was happy overall with the food.  A few highlights include the salad area & grill.  The salad area has tons of variety, and everything looked fresh.  I was also happy with the steak, as it was cooked to order on the grill.  

My  only problem with the food was the catfish.  While the taste was okay, it was thin & bone-in.  So by the time I pulled the meat away from the bones, there wasn't much left. So I felt it could've been served better.  

I agree with everyone on the cleanliness & service.   Getting refills on drinks and used plates cleared was a problem.  We could never seem to find out server; and other empty tables had plates stacked up for a while before they were cleared.

Food on the floor stayed there almost the entire time we were there, and the ""clean"" dishes & silverware had spots.  Sure, it's a buffet and I dint expect much, but for a place that is supposed to be a step up, I'd expect a step up.

Basically thats all GC is , an improved upgraded version of hometown buffet.
For around the same price, becareful at the door where they have beverages, they do charge for it.( a big more if you decide to grab the to-go cup as well)

Service is way above hometown buffet as they come by regularly , seem very sincere about serving and making your time there as pleasant as possible.

They do re-fill your drinks for you , unlike hometown which you do yourself.

The Golden Corral offers tasty food for a very generous price. It's about $15 for all-you-can-eat dinner and a drink. For my drink, I got the sweet tea, which I thought was delicious.

I was really impressed with the quality of the food. For the price we paid, mostly everything tasted great! The fried chicken was really juicy, as was the steak (mine was ordered medium well). Everyone wants steak though, so be prepared to wait in line for it. They had a lot of variations of chicken, (fried, rotisserie, BBQ, teriyaki) but I only tried the fried chicken, which was crispy and fully of flavor. The BBQ pulled pork was pretty good, too. I also liked the mashed potatoes and gravy. For dessert, of course I got the cotton candy! So good and a very generous serving. 

As for my dislikes, I didn't care too much for the Mac n cheese; it was undercooked. The corn was seasoned well, but slightly overcooked; it was rather mushy already. I tried the pot roast, and it was still really dry despite it being doused in gravy. The southern fried fish was much too salty. 

My biggest complaint would be with the lack of cleanliness of the facility. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but her apron was really gross. Something was smeared across the front of it and it was crusted on there and looked extremely unappetizing. Normally I would be embarrassed to comment on that, but it really was not the greatest start to my meal to see that. Also there is a lot of trash and crumbs scattered all over the floor. I want to be understanding of them because the place is always reeeeally crowded, but it was simply unacceptable for my taste. It honestly made me feel a bit uncomfortable.

They don't have a military discount *sad violin noises*.  I've been to other GC's that offer it but this one doesn't.  Just sucks cuz' there's a military base right down the road and on FRICKIN MEMORIAL DAY they didn't even offer a discount.  Minus one star.  

Have you ever seen feeding time at a pig farm?  Where the farmer pours slop out of a bucket into a trough and the pigs are all clammoring to get it?  That's kinda what it's like here, except great food. Super duper crowded and a rough crowd.   

I had one of the best steaks I've ever had here yesterday!! It was about an inch thick and perfectly cooked, charred on the outside, and didn't even need a knife to cut it.  Sooooo good. Worth the $12 alone.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,9,3,3,nyN9ztvZdj7d63mBj3nerQ
5725757,2012-07-25,2,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,"that's right, 5 stars.  now, BEFORE you go judging me, thinking I've only dined at places where you hafta pump your own ketchup, understand I'm not saying it ranks up there with Nobu, Ruth's Chris, or Chicago style- anything.  what I AM saying is that for the price, you CANNOT beat it!  

I'll admit at first I was considering passing on the idea because there was a line out the door with, well, ""buffet people.""  you know the type.  but buffets will always hold a special place in my heart; on special occasions, my dad used to take my family and all my friends out to the local spot when I was a kid; it's been very nostalgic ever since.  I know I'm not gonna get a bone-in cowboy steak cooked Pittsburgh style or a miso-blackened cod, but I think it was always the variety that I found appealing.

and at most modestly priced buffets, that's all it is.  very, VERY average food that looks like it should be served in a nursing home, with a crowd to match.  but this place was different.  yes, there was a line, but I soon discovered why!  the staff, while constantly busy and moving about quickly, was surprisingly courteous.  to whomever I asked a question, they stopped what they were doing and was very helpful.

now the real test - the food!  my first plate consisted of the usual supsects - mac 'n cheese (good), pizza (meh), fried chicken (surprisingly good), and a baked potato (decent).  overall, I was pleased with the first round, and the things I didn't like was not because they were cold (like most buffets), I just didn't care for the recipe.  and that's the thing about this place - the one upside to it being so packed is that the food never sits too long!

the second plate was even better - although I'm extremely weary of trying anything ""Asian"" at a buffet, I plated some of the teriyaki steak, which turned out to be very flavorful!  the lo mein was good, and even the sweet 'n sour pork was tasty!  skip the fried rice though.  another scary thing is that they asked me what temp I wanted my steak.  I had to hold back a scoff, but when I cut into it, I was surprised to find it was a true medium!  way to go GC!

then I stumbled on to two of my favorites - the seasoned hush puppies and the jalapeno cornbread.  they became my undoing.  I had another round of those and the piping hot, crispy fried chicken and I was DONE.    I was pretty disappointed I had no room for dessert - they had a good selection of cakes, pudding, cookies, and I was really curious about the chocolate wonderfall, but thankfully the cotton candy didn't take much space.  I left feeling the familiar post-buffet-shame, but this time, at least there was with a smile on my face.

overall, I spent $15/person for not only the incredible variety, but it was GOOD food!  plus I love that it was broken down into stations ""the grill, the wok,"" etc.  it was like a less pretentious version of Vegas.  they even had the cooks dressed up and preparing fresh produce by the salad station!  this place went above and beyond, and did not disappoint!  jalapeno corn bread, steaks cooked to order, tempura-battered onion rings, 6 flavors of ice cream at a buffet?  who does that??  def will be back, with reinforcements!",DQjTeu4ugtr7xktgN7yWHw,5,0,5,JRiTMc7OKk5h_UiEVAKY7A

NOTE - A lot of the stuff during lunch is limited, but for $8 bucks I really couldn't complain.  The salad bar had a few empty trays so they were missing a lot of the fresh fruits/veggies you'd probably get during dinner.  Additionally - the middle station only has chefs grilling the following meats 1) steaks, (2) mini slider-burgers and (3) liver (ran of fish when i got there).  I was hoping they could make full sized burgers or ribs or something, but nothing during lunch.   The steaks were a little too salty tho.  

You can get other stuff like Asian foods (orange chicken, some stir fry stuff, fried rice, etc), general Mexican food like enchiladas & build your own tacos, and pizzas.  The desert section is pretty nice w/ lots of ice cream goodies & cotton candy.  Service is good too - they constantly refill your drinks and stuff.  

I feel like people who are in buffet's automatically drop 15 IQ points and revert back to caveman status. It's like a freakin' zoo inside man. People will try to cut in line just to get their steak man; some people will bring 5 plates and grab 5 steaks at the grill, there was a mob of kids cutting just to get some cotton candy!  Crazy stuff goes down here man.  

I'd like to come during dinner to get the full experience.... (and the full experience means dealing w/ the 'herd' of crazy people lol).   

But still... 8 bucks for cheap eats lol.  I'd be back haha.

TIPS:
-lunch specials are $7.95 Monday-Saturdays
-Check your utensils when you eat. Not all of them are clean. Some of the desert bowls near the ice cream machine were dirty too.",pzwPuIDTpsd_ykGJ0CtuCg,4,0,3,PtO9leiVRTiDE_-N0kpaZQ

Golden Corral is a league better than Hometown Buffet; and while not as amazing as some of the Buffets in Vegas, if you aren't actually in Vegas, then this is the next best thing. Extremely worth the money, especially coming with friends or family. Which is my only nitpick is that this place is too small! There seems to always be a line out the door during any normal dining time every day. The crowds leak into the buffet sections, and kids run around all the time.

Or why is there even a line at all?  It's not even exactly that cheap either.  This place is really disgusting and unappetizing.  I only ate here because my parents had a semi-decent experience their first time so I thought it was worth a try.  Horrible mistake. 

Atmosphere:
Tons of people and kids running everywhere. I think it has to do with being located next to Speedzone and Round One.  This place is no where near being upscale or anything.  It's an American self-served buffet that lacks the aesthetic feature.  Even the dinnerwares are horrible. The dishes are not made of porcelain but probably clay with a glazed outer layer.  This produces many visible scratches which makes it look like you're eating off something you get at a 99 cent store.  I bet some of those glaze particles got in my food as well.


Food:
Been to Hometown Buffet before? The food at Golden Corral is only slightly better, but only just by a hair.  They offered a bit more variety such as steak, buffalo wings, popcorn chicken, chocolate fondue, and cotton candy.  Sounds appealing, but they are not good at all.  All the food there are practically frozen food which were reheated.

To add more insult to this place, I found a RAW shrimp in my popcorn shrimp!  (I have uploaded a photo in their page).  And I already ate one too!  The only reason I was able to find out was because the outer bread shell cracked when I stabbed it with my fork.  Imagine if I hadn't.  Also I can't really complain about this since it's a buffet and not individually served restaurant.  Even if I did, they probably wouldn't do anything about it anyways.


Service:
Slow service here.  We got our drinks after we finished our first plate.  I mean it's not like we're asking too much.  I think it is just common courtesy to get our drinks right away when we first got our tables.  It should be their first instinct.  I can understand that this place gets pretty crowded so they might have just forgotten.  But, I still find it a bit unacceptable.  I wasn't expecting great service anyway since it's a self-served place after-all.


I advise people to NOT eat here if you are looking for something decent to eat.  However, if you want to get stuffed, then by all means go here.  Just don't expect to be mind blown.",2h3i5-0tc9OxNBZyt00OaA,1,0,1,WV1-51yvPOup_7RpILucsg

Anyways, this place is always crowded with family and children. I mean most buffets are pretty loud, but if you're looking to stay away from a mass amount of children then try not to go here.

The food is alright. It's your basic buffet food - nothing really sticks out. They have your salads, soup, Chinese, American, etc. I did not enjoy the pasta here. It was too bland for my liking. The only good thing I had was the steak. I asked for medium well and it came back medium well with a lot of juice to it. They have a dessert section mainly targeted at candy like M&Ms and gummy worms. They do have a chocolate fondue fountain, but I stayed clear from that because the area was a bit too messy for my liking.

The part that grossed me out the most though is the workers cleaning out the food section with the same towel. You see them cleaning the section where the sauce from the pasta spilled and next thing he's over there cleaning the Asian section with the SAME towel - smearing food across.

5953662,2013-03-09,2,pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,This was my first time. I went with my family a party of 7 and first it was soo crowded the line was out the door. I felt like cattle in a barn. Once we got closer I saw there was another line inside it was loud and hectic. Needless to say we got out of line and went somewhere else. Didnt want to spend my Friday night at a Zoo,2JyjSBwHY792qwIZqkYbTA,3,0,1,P5PsxQLHsauBS5OOyLwfdQ

Manager said that this location is diff from that on tv. The steak was good. Waitress was friendly and always available to fill my drink. Over all, ok. Don't think will be back.",tvrOCQni3Vt_BtN03XQAbg,1,0,3,FY3Jol2LXmkmqR67sBVPqQ

One of our group volunteered to wait in the line while the other person helped park and get me inside. They have no disabled  accommodations.  The person in line was going to buy the dinners for all three, but was rudely told that he could only buy his own meal because the other two people in the party were not in the line.  This forced me to wait in line because it was their policy. They would not explain their policy or offer any suggestions

This  is vegas and fortunately competition from the casinos offers cheaper prices and much better service for guests. I suggest that retired and disabled persons just not patronize this place. I won't go back for sure",QSmrtX9PHOUzmKYaBVmaWw,2,0,1,Al3JzRaLGgIjeQbjM37bFQ
