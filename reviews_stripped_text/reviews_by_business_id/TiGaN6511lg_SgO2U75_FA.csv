It just so happens that YOU over filled my drink and it spilled. But I won't let your poor interactions with your customer navigate my day.  The one star rating will let my people know;),qnGzH1SV5FrLiHTmWDch0Q,0,1,1,o8AWzahgYpagB0zBdEdjvQ

And  that is not all, they charge for refills, unlike other subway's or other sub places. And also their meat has a weird taste. But my sub was okay, but a bit dry.",uKxQnerQhJqbwlm--xoU9g,0,0,2,XRPt8r-sns5ZBGUF1RfBAg
3171797,2014-03-06,0,TiGaN6511lg_SgO2U75_FA,I stopped in for a breakfast sandwich which is normally $3.25 at every other subway I have visited. Here it was $6. Absolutely insane. The sand which was fine-nothing special (is it ever at subway?)  and the staff were kinda rude when I asked why the price was so much more vs everywhere else.,ZWea39UHu_hy6gsg2KWAhg,0,0,3,kLrY6mSlSng2r6yxO9NOpQ

3909618,2011-11-24,0,TiGaN6511lg_SgO2U75_FA,Prices were higher than the ones here in SD and the sandwich wasn't that good.. I actually got a 6 inch and I only finished about 1/2 of it and had to throw the rest away. Soda refills were NOT FREE! wth??? kinda ridiculous...,2wc4Krfm3D_yGjz37XUtow,0,0,3,1GygwHaz0LUSpDV140hHiQ
