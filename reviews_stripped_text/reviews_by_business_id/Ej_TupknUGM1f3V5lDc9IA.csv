1606575,2015-04-29,6,Ej_TupknUGM1f3V5lDc9IA,Pretty good waffle from a truck. I have found them in the Ace Hardware parking lot and also near Costco. Some waffles costing $8.50 is a bit much but the waffles are cooked right and the toppings are fresh. Last week I had one that was chocolate filled and it was good but the waffle wasn't as light as it is without the chocolate inside. They have a punch card so after so many you get a waffle free. The girls working are friendly and they make the waffles to order so when the line is long it might be about a 10 minute wait. They have a fair amount of toppings if you want to create your own waffle also.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,11,10,4,oRF7gOW0fy3pquJIlnbb4A
1757307,2016-04-22,9,Ej_TupknUGM1f3V5lDc9IA,"""Love at first bite"" is scrawled across the outside of the truck, and it's a pretty accurate assessment. I had heard good things about this brand but gave up getting to try the product since they are from out of state and only come to town for annual food truck festivals... but last weekend, Chris V posted a photo of their waffles on IG with an alert that they were here for the day! 

Naturally, I dropped everything and headed over. The truck is painted in a cute and eye-catching desert theme with hearts, and the service is as sweet as the treats. At the staff's suggestion, I ordered their most popular waffle, the Red Wonder (Biscoff, fresh cream, strawberries and raspberries, $9.50). I was delighted by the temperature contrasts of the fresh, warm waffle and cold, thick cream. The cookie butter was a nice touch of savory to balance things out, and the fruit was fresh and plentiful. It was so good I joked about coming back for another..

Three hours later, I returned for the Lemon Berry Love (lemon curd, cream, raspberries, $9.50). The waffle was light and chewy, and the cream was cold and fresh, but I didn't enjoy the flavor of the lemon curd as much as I'd anticipated. My BF preferred this one to the former, though. 

We have a few places in town that specialize in waffles, but none do them as well as Waffle Love. I wish they came to town more often, but for now I'll just have to appreciate them as an extra-special treat when they roll into town!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,15,4,LltCONzT3w7d92tKtDSvWg

Seriously, I dream of these things- especially the Nutella Love with strawberries and raspberries. They are very filing and don't get soggy even if you save some for the next day.

When they announce a stop at a NW location like Centennial Park, I'm there. I've even enjoyed these tasty waffles in the truck's home base of St. George, UT. They were parked across the street from Kneaders.

I like to keep the toppings to a minimum and enjoy the flavor of the Li√®ge waffle. I'd prefer if the pearl sugar caramelized more on the waffle's exterior, as that's what I really love about this Belgian treat. The chocolate filled waffle is my favorite. They use chocolate batons traditionally baked inside pain au chocolat, so it's like a decadent chocolate croissant waffle. The whipped cream is good, but the full scoop is overkill and I use less than half of that amount.

If I'm looking for a heavier dessert, I'll order the cinnamon roll-inspired Cinnalove or the Red Wonder.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,10,7,5,A6BCTSLvh2O2ZpEcIN5vmg

I didn't get the new iPhone 7 because I wanted the Apple Watch, which I got. I only have so much money in my budget for apple products. Two things that I like: apple products and being on a budget. 

I use my phone a lot. I'll kill its battery around mid afternoon and will have to charge it again for the rest of the day. I use the battery up because I am all over social media, and I don't follow waffle love, but my sister does. She likes and shares their posts with everyone, me included. 

She had shared a post about waffle love coming to your house and making you breakfast. We thought that that was a great idea for a birthday party. We contacted them via the website and then sent them an email. We didn't really connect with them until we called. I recommend calling instead of using the website contact form or emailing them. 

Placing the order and figuring the cost was easy. They send you the breakdown of what the toppings cost and you choose how many you want. We chose whipped cream, biscoff, Nutella, strawberries, raspberries, and caramel sauce. It came out to about $10 per waffle. 

They show up with everything: table, table cloth, waffle iron, plates and utensils, dough, and all the toppings that you chose. 

The cook sets it all up and makes the waffles. We added the toppings that we wanted and ate delicious waffles. 

Waffle love is great, and it's even better when they are made fresh and in the comfort of your own home. I don't think that I'll ever eat them at their truck again. I was spoiled with the in house service. Jk. I'll go to the truck again.",wlfaJzgFW6Iazr2P95UBHg,0,0,5,o2UPwX7H3sOjPjWGVTV3hQ

3517948,2015-02-28,30,Ej_TupknUGM1f3V5lDc9IA,"Waffle Love was in the Ace Hardware parking lot (Bluff St and the Blvd) and I had been wanting to try them, so I did. The girl who helped me was cheery and helpful. I was trying to figure out the menu and explained it was my first time, so she suggested I try the ""Red Wonder"" which has strawberries, raspberries, biscoff cookie spread and whipped cream. I thought it sounded good and went with that. Wait time wasn't bad since there wasn't a line. There was actually another waffle truck there that did have a line, but I have heard good buzz about this waffle truck and wanted to try them instead. My name was called when my order was ready and it looked delicious. 

When I got back to my car, I noticed that I got the wrong order, but it looked good so I just ate it anyway. There were no raspberries and instead, just strawberries meaning I got what's called on their menu ""The Works"" instead of a Red Wonder. The ""liege"" type waffle was good! It was the right crispness on the outside and soft inside. I appreciated the amount of strawberries they put on it and the biscoff cookie spread had a nice flavor that stood out not too much, but just enough to taste great with the waffle and other toppings. I'm glad I got to try this truck and look forward to tasting some of their other creations in the future. 

The waffles start out at just $3.49 which make a great snack for the young ones and the price changes with each topping you add (add-ons range from $1.16 - $2.09) if you want to go custom and create your own waffle. I checked their Facebook page and noticed they have $5 waffle specials often, so make sure and check FB or their website to see what the special is that day. It wasn't advertised on the truck the day I visited, so I missed out. I was given a stamp card so after I buy 10 waffles, I get one free. Nice!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,37,34,4,eHHHLYelwafexcDdCzYY9Q

4107117,2018-01-07,7,Ej_TupknUGM1f3V5lDc9IA,"Perhaps it's a bit ironic to review an old favorite to start off a new year, but it's definitely an overdue review of a new era for my favorite food truck.

Waffle Love is a chain that originated in Utah and has grown to several brick-and-mortar locations and food trucks across four states. They became popular after their appearance on Food Network's The Great Food Truck Race a few years back - or at least that's how I first heard of them. They caught my eye when they made their first Las Vegas area appearance at the Great American Foodie Fest soon afterward in October 2015. I ordered a Red Wonder, and it was love at first bite.

Last year, they relocated this truck - formerly based in St. George, UT - to the Las Vegas area. There were some growing pains - or hiring and moving pains, to be sure - and they were working without experienced managers/employees of Utah, some of whom had become familiar faces when they brought down the truck to attract new fans and satisfy old fans' cravings. Fortunately, they seem to have found their stride and are delivering the same awesome product as before.

That addictive product is the liege waffle, a delicious treat crafted fluffy dough studded with pearl sugar (well, not so much in the savory waffles) and topped or stuffed with a variety of sweet toppings (aside from the savory grilled cheese, which is spectacularly gooey and comes with an addictive tomato bisque). The Red Wonder ($7.88 before tax), for example, comes with Biscoff cookie butter, sliced strawberries, raspberries, and a heaping scoop of Waffle Love's signature whipped cream. That cream is heavenly and is easily my 2nd favorite in town (formerly my favorite until a certain French cafe emerged somewhere on the West side of town).

They also are known to offer a lesser-known ""croissant"" dough, which is flaky and somewhat layery. This was only an occasional Utah import before, but I'm thinking that they might have it available regularly. Thanks to Amanda M, I learned that they had this dough on hand this week and tried it with the weekly special ($5 w/ tax), which was the Biscoff and cream this go-around (aka Red Wonder for non-frugivores). The dough definitely holds up to how I remember it from times past.

Locations vary but almost always include weekly stops in Henderson and elsewhere around town - check their Instagram (@wafflelovevegas) for the most updated locations. Also, make sure to hang on to their stamp cards. You'll quickly fill up the 10 stamps and earn a free waffle if you're even half as much of a fan of sweets as I am.

Waffle Love is still my favorite food truck in town and perhaps anywhere. Barring certain medical conditions, I can't see why you wouldn't try them out and fall in love too.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,9,5,khAfikzHw5M0uk7hmPKggw

4380342,2018-05-11,0,Ej_TupknUGM1f3V5lDc9IA,"The only downfall of checking into a mobile food truck is that you can't check in sometimes. I tried Waffle Love at an event in Henderson and when I tried to check in to get a free topping, it told me I was too far away. After waiting 40 minutes in line to order my waffle then waiting another 10 to pick up, I finally sat down to try this delicious carb.

My first order was this grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. When I ordered it, I though the waffle was going to something similar to Kellog's Eggo Waffles. Beware! If you order this waffle it is sweet! The waffle itself had a sweet base to it and when you bit into it w/ the cheese it didn't mush very well. It left me with a weird taste. Imagine you're making a grilled cheese with sweet bread. It was not to my liking. The tomato soup was very chunky. Like most, I like to eat my grill cheese dipped in tomato soup, but it gave it a even  more awful taste. I probably would've enjoyed this more if it was a plain waffle with cheese and soup. 

My second order was a churro waffle. Now this waffle does not need at topping. So even if you can't check into yelp, you'll survive. OMG the churro waffle taste just like disney land's churros. It was loaded with cinnamon. Surprisingly, when you ripped apart the waffle, the cinnamon didn't fall off where you just eat the flour. If you are a fatty like me then you should definitely order a side of whip cream because it is worth your calories and out of this world!!

No need to search anymore at city fairs or disney land to get a churro. Just find this food truck and get the churro waffle. I guarantee you it will taste the same and you'll be more satisfied!",-RA9NLalwmRTOX_8UMHnVQ,3,1,4,CQegHJefqXssHML23oBymw

Digging into the back-story only after indulgence, the now-franchised company starting off in the face of one family's adversity and growing by leaps and bounds to cover five states and several Trucks as well as Restaurants, Waffle Love is said to be built on the principals of ""faith, hard work, and community"" which seem about as good a foundation as anyone might want from a company.

Encountered while browsing the vendors at Last Friday: Just Add Water Street in Henderson, a wide variety of places including Hot Dogs, Pizza, Wings and more on display, it was immediately on seeing a truck called Waffle Love that eyes widened, the hand-painted design and colorful menu listing Waffles with any number of toppings like a beacon amongst the blas√© and the friendly folks inside happy to answer questions or make recommendations.

Proposing ten Specialty Waffles ranging from $4.64 to $7.88 plus bonus options for customization with everything from Chocolate Filling to housemade Lemon Curd, each Waffle made in the traditional Liege-style with sweet pockets of Pearl Sugar riddling the Batter, it was after a few minutes indecision that two selections were made, the total of $18 including tax and tip at first seeming a bit steep until each tray was handed over with the Waffle golden and plenty of well-presented ingredients on top.

Served with particularly flimsy plasticware, the heft of each Waffle and Vanilla Ice Cream hard-packed to stand up to frying making such tools unwieldy for cutting off individual bites, it was with a little bit of effort that first tastes of the cleverly named ""Dulce de Liege"" showed well with Cinnamon and Sugar plus Nuts adding a good crunch to Salty Caramel while the ""Red Wonder,"" named for its two types of Berries, was equally delicious and a bit more easily shared with a smear of Cookie Butter and Whipped Cream.

****  With such shops on nearly every street in Brussels or Bruges it is sort of surprising that Liege Waffles have taken so long to make an impact in America, but save for the cutlery and intrinsic issues of ""Food Trucks"" Waffle Love is doing Belgium justice with its product.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,5,4,wZiVKuB9pSJNofd1VzReLw

We had the Big Red and found it exceptional, the waffle was the star.  Thicker and more chewy than I have had before, all good. Top that with fresh strawberries, raspberries and whipped cream. 
The service was all we could ask for, smiles and warm courtesy.
The only reason I didn't give WL 5 stars is pricing. $8.75 for a great waffle on a paper plate, had us enjoying the fare but questioning a return for more. This is working for the owners/loyal customers and bless them for it but two retired folks on a limited income find this too spendy.",yl475__-pMHZhoV99B_EKw,1,0,4,hmhHVog3NRso1kdaXBd70g

I'm giving four stars because the waffles take a long time to cook and if there is a line you can be waiting for a very long time.,uWUSZpCC_i_KYdo8xDZYbg,0,0,4,yJxx0pyuGlhT_cgRpQMdBA

I wish I could bottle that scent and wear it! Though...that might make me hungry all.the.time. The guy taking orders was super personal and helpful and our orders came out quickly (luckily, since our mouths were watering!). There were so many tasty sounding options but my friend and I opted to split the Sunshine which is garnished with lemon curd, strawberries and whipped cream. Omg, this must be what heaven tastes like! I only wish I didn't agree to share it!",atLaTfIk1efrcO71SEixJw,5,4,5,gfT_oZdQIVlI2iewZYOrBg

We ordered the waffle with lemon curd and strawberries. The flavors were great. The lemon was perfectly tart and the strawberry was ripe. It was a little on the pricey side for what it was but I left that go since everything is always overpriced at these events. Everything was cooked well and it was plenty enough to share between my fella and myself, so there's that. 

If I ever came across Waffle Love again, I'd show them some love and have some more waffles.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,14,12,4,zKewyVUG4afmnEbEaxoETw

I opted for their nutella and strawberry on a waffle, which included a dollop of whipped cream. It was truly scrumptious and satiated my sweet tooth. The people working in the truck were nice despite what I'm sure was a challening evening, feeding thousands of people.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,2,2,4,zrpR8GA-nw_g4XdAlYhNhA
