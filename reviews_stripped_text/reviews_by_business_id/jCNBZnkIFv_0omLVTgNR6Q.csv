While the food was on par with any other Indian restaurant in town, the portion size and price did not adequately reflect the quality of the food. Indian food is a great lunch option mainly because of its price, size, variety, and healthiness. I ordered three dishes and three bottled waters for the whopping total of $80 (including tip).

It was a good experience . You get to see flights land at the airport across the strip while you eat . 

I ordered the chicken vindaloo and lassi which was well prepared. I didn't realize that  the curry actually comes with complimentary rice and hence ended up ordering more naan's than necessary.

The food, well the food was awesome. The chicken curry, definitely hit the spot and the spices left my mouth tingling in every right way! 

As awesome as the food was, what really took an already fantastic Indian spot to a whole new level even for Vegas terms, was the service! Mani!

I called at 1:45am asking if they're open (hours posted say 3am) and they said kitchen closes at 2:30 which is fine I said we will be there shortly. Arrived 2:05 sat down and waiter said kitchen might be closed and I said I was the one that called and he said it's up to the chef. He said they might only be able to do takeout and I said ""No"" and he came back and said it's all good and we ordered. (He was very polite and friendly during this whole ordeal). We ordered right away we were starving, and food came out 15-20 min later. I was worried they were just going to microwave the food to get us out as fast as possible but nope! Everything made fresh you could tell. The cheese naan is absolutely the best naan I've ever had AMAZING! The eggplant n peas veggie dish off the top flavorful! The butter chicken, tikki masala chicken and shrimp vindaloo were all great and the rice was perfect. Awesome Indian food our favorite so far in town (I have to say we've had better tikki masala chicken other places but theirs is really good too) We will be back!!!!!

My date and I split the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Malai Kofta.
Both were exactly what we expected, though low on the spice scale - even though we asked for a 4 out of 5.

The Nan was really fresh and hot. So often if feels like it's been sitting under a heat lamp. Here it felt like it was right off the tandoor. 

Not crazy about the overhead lighting - even though they've gelled it in pretty colors, it still feels harsh. 

However, the view is pretty awesome. We watched a storm roll in over the strip, and that was worth the price of the evening.

The one criticism I have is that it's a little hard to locate, being on the second floor, next to a hookah lounge, and the signage could be much clearer.

But once we arrived it was wonderful all the way.

The menu is a little overwhelming with so many delicious choices. [Nice problem to have!] I literally could eat here 3 times a week for 6 months and never have the same thing. 

I ended up getting the spinach paneer and a lamb curry. Wifey, a picky  vegetarian, got something just as delicious. And she was able to enjoy the paneer, too. I'm carnivorrific, but I could eat Indian  vegetarian forever and be happy.

And THE VIEW! It's really cool being across from the airport on the second floor. I couldn't stop watching the big ol' jet airliners landing and taking off.

Even the ToGo containers are the best, those little Tupperware bins that won't leak on the way home and can be used again and again.

We ordered off the menu and did not eat the buffet in hopes of fresher food. 

The garlic naan was burnt. The center had been rolled out to thin and was charred to a crisp. No garlic flavor. 

The chicken dish we ordered was wrong and had to be sent back. The redo was just as bad. 

The vegetable curry was mostly  frozen vegetables tossed in with some fresh bell peppers and onions in a nondescript yellow sauce they called curry.  

The basmati rice was over cooked and dry. Normally you get light fluffy long fragrant grains.  We got the opposite. Small broken grains of poor quality overlooked dry rice. 

Service was poor. There is no organization. We had three different people trying to take out order which would sound like s good thing. But when you ask one person a question or dietary requests and someone else takes your order it leads to mistakes. 

Location: was this an office space before? There is no real entrance to this restaurant. Just a series of hallways and if you figure out the maze you get rewarded with poor quality food.",_UwZg-ztV7gc9u0zsRSHxA,2,1,1,a8juHfSq_Etkl-TH8UtiMw

We showed up at 12, in my opinion what should be height of lunch, and expected the freshest hottest food, sadly we were disappointed. The food was good amazingly flavorful and everything, but it was not hot, not cold either just warm. The tandoori chicken was dry as though it was reheated from the day before. I also didn't care for the lamb. Being that I'm not completely familiar with all Indian food I rely on the labels. There were some, but not enough and asking the staff didn't help because the person I got was less then capable of communicating clearly. 
All that being said I have gone for dinner and had hot delicious amazing food. The chili chicken is wonderful. As well as paneer tiki masala and samosa chaat, vegetable pakor. I didn't care for their bhurtha bharta but it wasn't bad.  have so many things I still want to try!!",YGWbKXxOQs6oG8qZdtm49g,0,0,3,aJMLy92uhpSHmbcjhX9jPA

This is the perfect place to have brunch in the afternoon and a lounge drink at night. The owner, Raj has such great hospitality and they also have live music that was relaxing to my ears. 

The Indian spice level for the buffet is perfect but the dessert ""gulab jamun"" was too sweet for my taste. It's a fried dough ball sugared with sugar syrup!

I must have ordered 4 things off the menu and they kept coming back and saying they were out, with 10 to 20 minute breaks inbetween each time. So, after waiting all this time and being out of everything we finally left without having dinner. For this adventure we sat in the Hookah Lounge portion. Thier hookah was terrible as well. Super harsh.

After dropping one of thier managers off while driving for Uber, she talked me into trying them again. The second time my date and I sat in the restaurant section (same waiter as first time). This time amazing service and delic
ous food. Thier Naan is my only complaint, tough and boring. One of the best Aloo Gobi I have ever had. 

If I had to rate this place on first experience it would be a 1. If I based it on the second experience 4 to a 5 (I love Naan so it disappoints me)

1899206,2016-05-04,1,jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q,"I went here for lunch today and all I gotta say if that it was bomb!!!  So why the 4 stars? I minused one because the ladies bathroom was in very sad shape. There were 3 stalls and all three were filthy and no toilet paper....:(

Now onto the nitty gritty....:)

Ambiance was very nice. The restaurant was clean and the tables were set up nicely and the view of the planes taking off and landing was great. The only drawback is the location. The entrance for the restaurant is on the side of the building and the restaurant is upstairs.  There really are no signs pointing to where the restaurant is located. So as soon as u enter.... U see a small lobby with stairs to your left right next to an elevator. But no signs as to if the restaurant is upstairs. Go upstairs!! :). When u go upstairs u will see some red signs saying restaurant and lounge and for the life of me I can't remember the third sign....:( follow the hallway under the red restaurant sign and u will start to smell the deliciousness!!! Follow your nose!! :) (4/5) 

Service was impeccable! There was only one large table of 6 ppl when I entered. I was told that I could sit wherever I wanted so I chose a booth and I was served with water and iced tea and mango lassi which were the drinks that I ordered. :) the ice tea and water were your run of the mill.... But mango lassi was delicious! Perfectly creamy with just a hint of the yogurt and just perfect for putting out some of the heat from the dishes. My water glass/tea were constantly filled and they came and touched my table constantly to make sure I was good. (5/5)

Food.... They had a great selection of sauces.... I'm normally not big onto the sauces but I saw a green sauce that reminded me of this salsa Verde I had back home in Texas... Of course it did not taste like what I remembered but the green sauce was delicious nonetheless! It had chilis, mint and cumin I think.... All I can say was that I just wanted to eat it up... So good with the vegetable samosas....I just didn't want to stop. Lol. I skipped some dishes like the rice and the French fries. Why load up on carbs when there were so many other flavorful carbs like naan coming your way.... Puhahaha

The saag paneer was done right. So flavorful and so balanced. It was delicious!!! The chicken tandoori I did not touch as there was a customer there before that kept on going back to the buffet line with a half full dish and that's what he was grabbing and it looked like he had touched the tongs to his plate of half full food.... I couldn't be sure but I wasn't going to touch it. I wished the staff working there would have said something about using a new plate every time. I guess I figured that everyone knew not to bring an old plate but just to grab a new one??? I'm guessing not. :/ I digress.... Back onto the food...

They had salad which I skipped... For obvious reasons as there were more flavorful things waiting for me. :) there was another curry dish with chickpeas in it... Forgot the name but it was good as well. The chilli chicken was very tender and full bodied and delicious. The butter chicken like the name implies was like ""butta""... Very very tender almost melt in your mouth deliciousness!!

But my all time favorite dish was the coconut potato and to think that I almost passed this one by. The coconut flavor balanced out the curry flavor... It was so creamy and yummy!!

Overall my impression was that they are trying very hard to please and the good speaks for itself. The chef came out of the kitchen to check on the food a couple of times as I was eating there...I appreciate that. :)

Will I be back? Heck yeah!!! :) I can't wait to come back and try the dinner.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,6,4,4,IBRmozGL7KqlGGb0k8vHZg
1903612,2017-04-09,1,jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q,"Honestly I don't understand all the glowing reviews. It's an Indian restaurant  in the airport district with an unappealing second floor entry, sitting alongside hookah up bars and low end restaurants. That was a warning sign but I thought Vegas reviewers know their secret places. Not the case. 

As far as the food goes, you could do much better in a run-of-the-mill Indian buffet restaurant than this place. I was there for dinner, and prices for basic vegetarian entrées run well over what I would pay in high-end places in DC metro area.  The samosa chickpeas had cheap oil fried samosas and canned chickpeas with powdered spice.  The naan disappointed with its low end flour.  The potato cumin had burnt cumin seeds taste. The dal makhani had honestly been cooked for half a day it seemed.  Maybe this is appealing to first timers and folks not too familiar with Indian food.  But anyone who has tried mainstream Indian or cooks at home and understands fresh, whole spice taste of any cuisine would know better. 

The waiter was a good natured guy. I wouldn't ding the service. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

The lighting was off with a stark tube light shining above and two endless looped Indian entertainment of second rate Bollywood.  But even novices know decent ambiance. This place disappointed. 

I'll venture out to say many of the reviews may be gamed.  It was a sad start to a spring break in NV/AZ.",LyFOwQKXjtESmc4IhDtahA,0,0,2,3cPI5Z9L6CNY0U5Uqo3RdA

Watching her geek out over the planes was almost as good as the food itself. The restaurant-bar-lounge is somewhat hidden in the second floor of a business park, but well worth seeking out if you enjoy Indian cuisine.

Their menu is expansive, opt for something beyond Butter Chicken and Tandoori dishes- though they likely do those just as well. We shared the Lamb Rogan Josh and Shrimp Saag entrees, with basmati rice and garlic naan. Dishes were amply portioned with flavorful sauces and a nice heat, and the proteins were fresh and juicy. If you enjoy the kick, upgrade to spicy!  

The service for dinner seemed overwhelmed even before they got busy, with items forgotten, check errors, and a delay receiving our food.

The service was really horrible, they should just get some new staff. We went in for an evening snack and light dinner. The first person who came to take the order was staring at us as if ""why are you guys even here"". We were around six folks and since we just ordered snacks and light dinner I suppose the number of items were few and he was not pleased with it. The service just got worser from there, they never came near the table when we needed something and since it was evening the sun was shining right on our faces and the guys didn't care. They just stood far off near the kitchen and it was difficult to get some attention and close the window curtains. 

To top that when we ordered tea they brought cold tea whereas the item was supposed to be hot Indian tea. Again we had to get their attention and the get the tea re heated which took like 10 minutes, one of us just drank the cold tea not bearing to wait to get their attention ( we had order 2 tea and both were cold).

The rest of the food items were good for which I would have given a 4 star but the service was just horrible.

Amazing service - This place has a great staff that really knows how to take care of their customers.  My friend and I spent quite a bit of time talking with the owner who is an amazing and very interesting guy.  Service is super fast and very attentive.  

Great food - There is a reason why all reviews rant and rave about the food at this place.  The menu has authentic Indian cuisine done to perfection.  I definitely want to stop by here for lunch to try their Lunch Buffet.

Hookah - If you are a hookah person this is among the top three places in the valley.  This is the only one that I know that will serve hookah in a quiet, intimate atmosphere where you can go and enjoy the hookah with friends or on a date and don't have to worry about loud music and a bunch of underage kids.  Also the only place in the valley to serve all glass hookah for the price of what you would usually get a regular hookah for.

Looking forward to trying the lunch buffet before/after my next mid-day flight at McCarran.

Mint and Mt. Everest have some serious competition in Pure! For the last couple of years, I've been declaring Mint as the best Indian in the city, now I'm definitely not so sure. Pure could very well be the hands down best in town!",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,3,4,5,_-uGRnKjZVjhCigIIdmUTw

We got an order of ""lamb rogan josh"" which contained lamb chunks cooked with yogurt, onions and spices with basmati rice. We had a choice of choosing the spice for our lamb. We chose mild spiciness and it was a good kick. We also originally chose ""chicken tikka naan"" but the person preparing our food got our order wrong and gave us regular naan instead. So to go off on the lamb rogan josh, it tasted very delicious and fresh despite it being delivered to us from a 20 minute drive away. There was enough sauce from the meat to drench into our rice, making it perfect to dip our naan bread into.

2532895,2018-05-13,0,jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q,"The short version:

Food - excellent
Service - very good
Pricing - reasonable
Ambiance - quirky, but pleasant
We will be back

The details:

Food:
appy - vegetable samosa - well blended ingredients inside and crispy outside - excellent with the brown sauce on the table
appy - lasoni gobi - tangy, spicy, and cooked perfectly
appy - aloo tikki - the spices in the patties went wonderfully with the chickpeas on the side
bread - garlic naan - fresh garlic on naan, enough said
bread - cheese naan - gooey cheese in naan, my kid loved it
entree - channa masala - spiced perfectly and had a nice texture
entree - butter chicken - tender and buttery
entree - lamb rogan josh - it melted in my mouth
entree - chicken tandoori - the dish was perfectly cooked, which can be a real challenge with tandoori dishes
drink - mango lassi - cool, sweet, and smooth
drink - sweet lassi - it was ok, i preferred the mango
drink - coffee - satisfying
dessert - kheer - my little one ate the whole thing and smiled the whole time

Service:
we were seated quickly, our drinks and dishes arrived quickly, we were offered excellent suggestions for food, and my water glass was never empty.

Pricing:
It was very reasonable for all the food we got. There were 5 of us, we got all the things i listed above, plus a Taj Mahal beer and 2 Sprites, and the total w/tax was just over $120 + tip. Full disclosure, we had a groupon, so we got a few dollars off, but I did not include that in the total for my review. We were all stuffed and 4 of us have plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Ambiance:
Like I said, quirky, but pleasant. It's set in with a bunch of office/industrial park kinds of places and it's on the 2nd floor (there is an elevator and ramps outside, so it's accessible). The table settings are semi-formal, seats in the booths are comfy, there are colorful lights set into the ceiling by the bar, the walls are full windows, some facing the airport (you can watch planes take off) and some facing the strip (lots of lights, which is fun), a small spot for live music, multiple TVs on and muted (some on Indian channels, some on the hockey game), and it's attached to a hookah bar (totally separate area, so you don't smell the smoke or even see the hookahs from the restaurant - I walked through, though, and it has a very relaxing vibe with another wall of windows - if I smoked a hookah, I would enjoy that space). The musician that they had playing, Miko, sounded great, was very nice, and played jazzy versions of a wide variety of pop type tunes. He didn't take a break for the whole 2 hours we sat there, so I definitely tipped him, too.

The final judgment:
We will be back. I enjoyed the experience.",besiA1REWgLKsWGZFLdpBw,0,0,5,k4FTnNjs7jBzIm6Vf9Wrpg

The food quality is so fresh and the best part is they have hookah lounge beside the restaurant so you can have hookah as well as food.
The best part is they play cricket on big TV and I'm big fan of cricket. Have a big bar you can sit and have beer which is available on tap, watch football if you are a football fan.

The basmati rice fried rice and white rice was very good. Love to soak up the excess curry with it and dip the garlic naan bread. 

The views from this second story restaurant are amazing as it overlooks the airport runways and excellent views of the strip. Could be a great place for a New Years party as you could see the entire show!

Good :  good place to eat and watch the tarmac where planes were taking off and landing.

Found this place on Yelp with good reviews and I thought it's a nice location away from the strip. The view of the airport and strip in the background is beautiful, our server Mani was great and the food was delicious. I have a friends from India who have spoiled me with authentic dishes, so I've been dissatisfied with most restaurants I've been to where the dishes are too salty for my taste. Indian food can be, but I don't eat a lot of salty foods. This place seasoned their dishes perfectly. Not greasy or salty.

I ordered the dishes I love for Michelle to try: Navaratan Korma (creamy veggie cashew dish), Palak Paneer (spinach and Indian cheese), dishes came with basmati rice and we ordered two types of naan - garlic and a naturally sweet one (forgot the name) with figs and nuts.  

When we were seated, we were immediately served with water, asked for drink order and server returned with a complimentary variety  of chutney and Indian 'crisps' like chips (forgot the name for it!).  Finished off dinner with traditional Masala Chai. It was Michelle's first time trying authentic chai. She loved it as I do.

We were satisfied with our vegetarian dinner. No bloating from salty Indian cuisine is a plus. Will come back again to try their lunch buffet and other menu items!

 In addition, they have live dinner music - Mr Montgomery played some smooth jazz reggae fusion that night.  They also have hookah at 7pm in another room.",PiDPwcqd01Wt07dEQIG1kg,3,1,4,dX16a8vQaSWgX8n95y_92Q

We were given some complimentary papadam to start, which also came with mint and tamarind chutneys. Service was friendly. I will say that it took quite a while before our food came out, but I suppose they make everything to order.

Unfortunately, the portions were not the biggest, so even after two entrees and an order of garlic naan, my brother and I were not full. The garlic naan was a decent size (four pieces) for the price though, and the eggplant and chicken dishes we ordered were very flavorful and tasty. 

There was also live music when we visited, which was nice.

3449721,2017-04-25,2,jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q,"Okay, the fact that this restaurant is located across from the airport on the second floor allows for pretty nice views -- the Strip skyline in the distance peppered periodically with planes making their descent into Vegas. I'll round up a star for that alone. You can ponder the logistics of aviation while waiting for your complimentary papadum and chutney. (The minty green sauce is better than the red.)

The entrance is a little odd. You walk in through some double doors, either take the elevator or stairs, pass the hookah lounge, and make a turn at the long hallway. We went on a Sunday evening. There were about two other tables there. One of them consisted of tourists, clad in Vegas memorabilia, and the other was an Indian family, so that's a good sign. 

I got the PALAK PANEER ($14) while my dad got the LAMB KARAHI ($16). Both came with Basmati rice, but it was merged onto one plate (could've used another scoop or so). We also got an order of the garlic naan, but it was served kind of cold. My entree was the palak paneer, which is my favorite Indian dish. I barely ate a third of it and got full. No one thinks you can get full off of pureed spinach and cheese cubes, but those spices and seasonings do their job of pumping up the flavor. I didn't try the lamb because I'm not a fan of gamey meats, but my dad said it was good. So there you go.

Service was mediocre. Our two waiters didn't seem too friendly. Also, it was Easter and so I called ahead to make sure I could use my Groupon and the lady had said yes. When I tried to redeem it, one of the waiters was adamant in declining it. (In fine print, it states not valid on federal holidays, but Easter isn't a federal holiday.) He replied that he had not been accepting them all day. Well, I guess those grouponers got swindled. He ended up redeeming mine after I explained I had called in to check. There was a lady bussing tables that day and she was the friendliest out of all them.

Overall, Pure Indian Cuisine has a great location/view, worth checking out with the Groupon. I'd stop by again, but it's not my favorite. There are plenty of Indian restaurants in the city deservedly vying for your visit.",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,1,3,4,P0hQjMugH3ak5gGseGcIuA

Kabuli Naan $4.00-bread stuffed with cashews, pistachios, raisins and dates.

This place is located in the back of ""Fresh Kabob"" which is facing Sunset Rd. It's on the second floor so you have to take the stairs or the elevator. 
As soon as I walked in, I was wowed by the view of the runway with the plane taking off!!
I was welcomed by the waitress, Nikita. She was nice and sweet.
There are so many different curries in the buffet area. From vegetarian ones to chicken ones to lamb ones!! I tried everything and they were all delicious. The chicken was tender and flavorful. I liked ""Navaratan Korma"". It's cashew nuts pasted curry. Nice sweet taste but a bit spicy. It was delicious with their garlic naan. 
I met a guy here that explained me about all of their vegetarian curries (How nice!). He said he's a vegetarian and he comes here every week. So, if you are a vegetarian and love Indian food, you still have a lot of choices you can eat at this place!! Vegetarian friendly.

Walking into the downstairs of the building, you wouldn't guess what you're going to find in the upstairs. It's kind of shady feeling, and normally I'd have taken one sniff of the lingering cigarette smoke and walked out. However (and thankfully), once we made it upstairs and figured out that it was NOT in the hookah place next door, it was quite a relief to see an airy, clean restaurant space to walk into. 

There are big windows where you can watch the planes take off and land while you have your meal, and enjoy the sun (or lights). 

The food. Yes, the food. Definitely some of the best we've had in the city, especially for a very reasonable $12.00 lunch buffet. 

The salad fare was standard stuff. I wish I'd taken pics of the rest of the buffet, but I was too damn hungry to remember..LOL. 

After taking our drink orders, the waitress brought a combination basket of plain and garlic naan to the table, that was obviously right out of the oven. It was thicker/more doughy than I personally prefer, but still very good. I like it thinner so I don't fill up so easily, and also to sop up the sauces better. 
The palak paneer and butter chicken were the standouts for us. Perfectly creamy and lots of flavor. The spinach was slightly spicy, just the way it should be. 
The vegetable korma was also well flavored and not bland. The chicken tikka was rather dry, but the fresh batch they brought out was just fine. 

There were a couple of other chicken dishes that were tasty as well, but my favorite dish hands down was the curried goat. Lots of flavor layers and decent chunks of meat amongst all of the little bones. (why there always are so many in goat meat, I have no idea...I don't recall seeing micro goats with micro bones everywhere..lol).
That was really that only purpose for me to have any rice at all on my plate...just so I wouldn't lose that yummy sauce! 

Service overall was pleasant. Our water glasses were kept full, though we did have to ask for more naan, and it wasn't busy when we were eating. 

The rice pudding was good, nothing unusual though. The mango ""custard"" was very sweet, cloyingly so for me. I'd never had it before, and a woman diner warned me about the sugar and how it was more to be used in small amounts, like a dip . It was not custard like at all in presentation, more like a somewhat thin pudding consistency. Maybe that's standard, I don't know, but just throwing the discrepancy out there. 

Anyway, we found the place to be worthy of a review, and we will definitely return once I can risk the million calories again :-)

**UPDATE**:  Upon making a second trip here, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. The quality of the first visit just wasn't there this time, and so, I'll likely continue going to Mt. Everest instead as they are quite consistent, and very accommodating there. My initial review was 4 stars here, and I've adjusted it down to 3.",xq0Zx_HDVPDqyOF5FP971w,2,1,3,JIJut64LDN4RudVESkqslQ

I came here with two friends yesterday for the lunch buffet.  The price as mentioned in reviews is $10.99 which includes naan.  After we were seated, we just chatted for awhile catching up on  news (OK, gossip) each one of us had to give.  A young woman from the restaurant came by and told us politely that we could go to the buffet anytime we wanted.  She held off ordering naan for us until she saw us go to the buffet.

One of the first things I chose was the papdi chaat.  This is the first Indian buffet that I remember serving any kind of chaat and it was very good!  I also tried the pakora mix, mutter paneer, and navaratan korma.  Everything was very good.  As we were starting, the server brought our garlic naan and it had a great garlic flavor.  For my second plate, I got some butter chicken and more standard Indian fare.  For dessert. I got a small bowl of mango custard and one of of kheer.  Both were delightful.  

Service was very good.  Our water was refilled several times.

I found a Groupon offer for Pure Indian Cuisine and saw that my Yelp friends had given it good reviews. So of course I had to try it. My Groupon offer was valued at $30 so I had to get a few items from the menu. Darn the luck. I tend to plan my adventures out so I knew going in what I wanted to try. I diverted from my path slightly. 

To start, I was brought the customary papadum and sauces. This was some of the best papadum I've had and the sauces were very herbacious and HOT. Well, not overwhelming but they woke up my taste buds.

On to my order, I knew for sure I wanted to try the homemade Indian tea, vegetable samosas and garlic naan. The tea and samosas came out first. I was expecting a hot tea. This was not hot. Nor was a iced. I suppose tepid is the right word. A tea with cardamom and milk. It was fine just not what I had in mind when I ordered. I was offered a refill but I declined. It wasn't necessary. The samosas were pleasing to the eye. A good size and crisp. Lets not forget hot and fresh too. The potato and pea filling was on the dry side so I spooned some of the leftover papadum sauce onto them. The naan came out with my meal.

For my entree I ordered chicken korma. I changed my mind from chicken jalfrezi which was a departure from the Punjabi chicken I orginally wanted. Either way I was getting something I had not tried before. The korma was a perfect choice. Indian food has such remarkable depth of flavor which is why I love it so very much. This was no exception. The sauce was rich and creamy with a subtle hint of nuttiness from the cashews. It was so soothing. And the chicken was tender. Of course I had to spoon it over the rice which on its own was stellar. Some of the best rice I've had any where regardless of cultural origin. Long grains of seasoned rice that I could make a meal of by itself. Finally the naan. I ordered garlic naan and there was no small amount of garlic on it. It was loaded. The bread thinner than I am used to. And more charred to crispy. Perhaps more authentic than the chewy pizza crust style I usually get. It was different but good in its own right.

At the end of the evening I spent $28 of the $30 voucher I had. Not bad. Plus I brought home some leftovers for lunch. Score. I got to see the planes taking off and landing. And I was called ""dah-ling"" by my waitress with the ever so slight New York accent. All in all it was pretty good meal that left me full and content.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,3,4,VCLh6m1wk9w9uxYN0XzrCw

You can taste the love in the way the food is seasoned to perfection. One of their best items is the Chili chicken which is usually a buffet item on Fridays. Buffet items consist of 4 different meat dishes in addition to 6 vegetable type dishes:

Goat curry - standard dish
Butter chicken - standard dish
Chicken Tandoori - standard dish

Navaratan korma - standard dish
Palak paneer - standard dish 

Let's talk about dinner, of course it turns into fine dining and is brought out in splendid Indian flavor.

As a repeat customer I've found myself making friends with other repeat customers.

The gang at Pure Indian Cuisine go out of their way to make your visit a memorable one so that you come back and it works. Go visit you'll be glad you did!!!",u-lPzJNjkHrcJ_GHhuS73w,2,1,5,UD6SIKvVg7b4aZXRuj9a1A

In my opinion, the portions were small and the price was high. $17 for maybe 10 pieces of meat in the chicken tikka masala. They also gave us 2 plates of rice for 3 entrees. 

The service started off ok, but towards the end we were neglected. There was a Yelp coupon for a ""free samosas with the purchase of 2 entrees"", we were unable to click on the coupon from an Android and iPhone so the waiter took this opportunity to ignore the deal. When we showed him that it wasn't pulling up, he said he would look into it. He never did... 

We were a party of 3 adults and 3 toddlers (2 year olds). The toddlers didn't order any additional food from their menu, SO I guess they made up for the lost revenue by adding a 15% (large party) gratuity to our bill. I had added a take out order to my bill and the 15% was added to the take out order.

My wife likes the food here, the few times prior to this visit the food for me was good as well.  Normally we've had one of the female servers who do listen to customer needs and made sure the kitchen made my food properly.

On this visit however, after several dishes were served to include the rice and we started eating, I immediately noticed an issue.  We called the waiter over and asked him if there was cinnamon in the rice and/or anything else?  He said yes.  Really??? Cinnamon in jasmine rice as well as other dishes?  We all looked at him in disbelief stating we told you there was a cinnamon allergy.  His response?  You've been here before for the lunch Buffett, did you eat the rice and other stuff that time?  Really?  You don't deserve to be working here.

Our response...we asked what dishes on the Buffett had cinnamon that day and they took the time to ask the chef.  As I was headed out the door to try and get medicine to counter act the allergy, I noticed the girl staff yelling at him for not checking and taking this seriously.  It was a very rough night that came very close to the ER.  He's lucky he's not facing a law suit, he was just rude and did not care.  My wife says he seemed to feel bad and took 10% off the bill and gave her free desert, really?

Checked Yelp for the hours of operation & fortunately enough, they close at 3am. We kinda got lost on which building in the complex it was because it was dark out and the sign they had outside wasn't very visible unless you're really looking for it. 

The restaurant is upstairs, where we passed by a hookah lounge (which I believe has the same owner as the restaurant). Came in and was greeted by the staff. The guy let us pick our own table, especially because there was only one other table there at the time. 

They provide an appetizer of thin bread with a green and brown dip. I personally preferred the brown one for the crackers/bread. We ordered: 
Chicken Tandoori - it's a big ""appetizer"" which we ate as an entree. Try it with the green dip that came with the thin bread appetizer 
Chicken Masala - great with rice. All their entrees come with rice. It's $3 more for each extra order of rice. 
Both our orders were definitely five stars! They were delicious and full of flavor. The two were plenty for the both of us. 

I appreciate the most: the view of the restaurant. I enjoy watching the planes land, so the view was great.Especially at night. There was also live music there and an open bar.

4759798,2016-10-21,0,jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q,"Indian cuisine is an interesting category on Yelp. I feel as though a lot of non-Indians in certain parts of the U.S. really haven't experienced truly outstanding Indian food, so they don't have much of a frame of reference when reviewing Indian restaurants.

If you ate at Pure and felt you had great Indian food, then you're going to be truly blown away when you finally do eat great Indian food. You didn't have it at Pure though.

As someone who's lived in India and also eaten some of the best Indian food in the U.S., I continue to be extremely disappointed by the quality of the Indian food offerings in Las Vegas. Overall, Indian cuisine lags far behind many other ethnic cuisines in the City.

Pure is somehow a 2-3-star restaurant with a 4.5-star rating on Yelp, which is very misleading in my opinion. Many of the curries, which should be more distinctive, are just slight variations of the chicken tikka masala, which is average.

I've had 4-5 of their curries, including the butter chicken, korma and vindaloo, and all were average at best. If I had to pick one, I'd go with the butter chicken.

The quality of their naans and rotis is poor. The samosas were average. The soups were not authentic. 

If you eat at Pure, notice that there's an Indian banquet hall in the same shopping center that attracts large numbers of Indian clientele, yet very few Indians eat at Pure. Indians do not like to pay a lot of money for mediocre Indian food, which is unfortunately what you get at Pure.",c-YbKFuw-vhEOBLad_NMBA,4,0,2,AWz05bTvnssofOM44Ts_Qw

I called GrubHub who called the delivery driver and then The restaurant. The restaurant admitted they didn't send it and would credit me for the missing rice from the 4-5 items. My credit given is $3.24! I guarantee if I ordered 2 sides of rice my total would be more than that.

Location: easy to get to on Sunset Rd about 5 minutes east of the Strip. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor over looking the McCarran runway. Kind of cool of cool to watch the planes take off and land. As the sun goes down you can get a decent view of the strip. Their signs aren't the most prominent so being able to notice it while driving by may be a little hard. They are directly above a Kabob restaurant.

Ambiance: very clean and and nice looking. kind of open with a lot of windows. We ate there for dinner an got there before sunset. They had shades pulled down on the west side to keep the sun out of our eyes. The only drawback as it started to get dark outside was their light. Although there isn't much they can do without spending a ton of money but they utilized the fluorescent lighting in the ceiling. Most of the fixtures were covered with blue panels but there were a few that weren't. One being right above out table. Which turned out to be bright and obnoxious. They might want to use a warmer type of lighting. There was a man with a keyboard playing live music which was quite pleasant. I'm not sure how often he is there. 

Food: we ordered Chicken Saag, Chicken vindaloo , garlic naan and rice. The Naan had a great flavor and slightly thicker than normal. The Vindaloo was awesome. I think I might have ordered it a little too spicy but I was able to handle it. The Saag was the best that both me and my girlfriend had ever had. The naan seemed to be very pillowy and fresh. All in all. Extremely good food.

Update: we went back a few days later because we wanted to try the buffet. All items that I tried were delicious. Especially the Butter Chicken and Palak Paneer. The chicken tandoori was slightly on the dry side but flavor was very good. And there were other delicious items that I don't remember the names.",06X7m5d7om3RbCsyQhRNDQ,1,0,4,smsIT9Shm2szBLwjm2VTlQ

There was a large family there that kept cutting in and out of the line like it didn't matter at all so it was chaotic, coming up for seconds etc. so that lessened the experience. The food was pretty decent. I would try it again but prefer not to deal with a similar experience in the line for the buffet.

Both dishes tasted excellent perfect combination of Indian spices and flavors. They certainly lived up to the level 9 heat level as my nose was running halfway thru my meal. Only drawback is that they only gave us one small saucer of rice to split for both of our meals but the waitress was nice enough to give us a little more rice complementary upon request.

Service was good. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out in a reasonable time but it wasn't busy in there when we were in there so it's hard to tell how they perform when busy. Otherwise, nice place to visit if you want some Indian food.",WGxjLdUht8OqCQGFPOmFdA,0,0,4,e61_HE5V7_WoDXCl2Wl-MQ

The service we had was impeccable! Everyone was great but especially our server Mani who was incredibly attentive to our needs throughout dinner. Very friendly and helpful!

We started with some drinks and samosas. Then we moved on to some tikka masala, vindaloo and garlic naan. Everything was excellent and nice portions which is important to me since I love leftovers!

Pure Indian Cuisine on Sunset is definitely a hidden gem with an amazing view!  Pure is on the second floor of the building, directly above Kabob and across from the McCarran airplane viewing lot on Sunset.  I was taken back to my youth, when my parents would bring us to a restaurant called the Flight Line that also overlooked McCarran's runways...couldn't tell you a thing about their food, but watching the planes come in and out really stuck in my mind.  Pure on the other hand actually made me forget about the planes and focus on the amazing scents of Indian spices wafting through the restaurant and the pleasant anticipation rumbling through my stomach.  Rohani, our server, welcomed us warmly and seated us near the windows overlooking the East/West runway along Sunset.  He started us off with Indian beer, Taj Mahal & Flying Horse, both very tasty lagers and a great way to cool off the curry!  Rohani suggested the Lasoni Gobi as an appetizer (sautéed cauliflower) which didn't sound all that earth shattering, but when it arrived and the munching began, three words came to mind...Ah May Zing!!!  It will be very difficult for us to try another appetizer the next time we go, as we won't want to miss out on this wonderful dish!  We went with Lamb and Chicken curry along with Muteer Paneer and the garlic nan bread.  My nose thought it had died and gone to heaven when every thing arrived!  The presentation was very nice and I can't say enough about how savory and unique the flavors of each dish were.  The lamb was tender and juicy with the curry providing a tasty backdrop with a multitude of flavors that never outperformed the star of the dish.  The chicken curry was also up to the task and I literally had to stop myself from licking the bowl of the Paneer!  The nan bread was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and bursting with flavor.  Needless to say, we didn't have any left-overs to bring home, which sort of sucks now since writing this has got me seriously jonesing for more!  I see many more trips to Pure in our future.",FPbo46Fc3pKrSMlIn_hv7Q,1,0,5,NXnuozDJZSKWawBou9yTkg

This is niiice!"".  Not having luggage really does make all the difference.

Entrees for dinner are a couple of dollars more than other places, but they do make up for it with slightly larger portions and some seriously delicious fare.  Their version of chicken korma was fantastic.  The nutty cashew flavor was definitely amplified and those occasional hits of raisins were like lapdances to my taste buds.  

Even though our other entrée was billed as ""Palak Paneer"", which is supposed to be all spinach, less creamy, and no garlic, the server informed us that they used saag for this dish.  That was fine by us as it was still very good.  I appreciated the slight coarseness of the greens and the firmer than usual blocks of paneer.

The first time was for a wedding and we pre-ordered some snacks including samosas, various pakoras, and chicken tikka. We placed the order about a week in advance, and deposited half. When we showed up to pick up the food at the agreed time, they told us that the food wasn't ready and we would have to come back in 1 hour. No big deal - we came back and got the food. When we came home, we realized that they didn't give us our full order! Since we were already an hour late, we just let it be. 

The second time, we only catered 50 samosas. We prepaid in full about 3 weeks before the event. When I showed up to pick up the samosas, they didn't have it ready and told me that they didn't even have the normal samosas, and instead only had the tiny triangle ones and will give me 150 of those for the same price I paid....those triangle ones cost $4.99 for a pack of 100 and they were trying to charge me $50.

Had to keep asking for bread and refills on drinks. That's a pet peeve of mine, with good service you shouldn't have to ask especially since the gratuity is automatically charged.",meRvDvEWtvDcHyJsgLbK9Q,0,0,1,UF-rBGu9GU2xuKS8MQdCpg

We were seated and a few minutes later we were greeted by a slender gentleman and asked if we'd like anything to drink so we gave him our drink order and asked for his recommendations since it was our first time and he said everything is good. So I asked if he's eaten here and he said yes, so I asked what is his favorite and he said everything. Not very helpful at all. So me and my friend asked for more time. As soon as he left, the guy performing leaned over and suggested the Chili Chicken. So the guy came back and we ordered the Vegetable platter, Chili Chicken, Shrimp Tandoori, and Garlic Naan. About 5 minutes later another guy comes by and asked to take our order so we asked him what he recommended and he said the Chicken Tikka Masala so we asked him to change out the shrimp dish for the masala.  He was able to do that. The platter wasn't that bad, it came with various options. The main dishes were another story. Both recommendations were more than satisfying. They were packed with so many flavors that all worked well together. The garlic naan was soo good and if you dipped it into the masala sauce it was more delish. 
 
When it came time to pay, we gave them a gift certificate for $100 but our bill was only $60. They took the gift certificate which was won at an FBI fundraiser and came back and said they can't accept it because someone had wrote in the restaurants info and their GC are different. They claimed anyone could come in and just write it. First it came from the FBI? Second what the restaurant didn't disclose themselves but we found out after some research was that the restaurant changed ownership in the past year. The manager didn't even come out to talk to us and explain. We had to ask the server what the problem was and lastly, it makes us the clientele feel like you're accusing us of scamming the place or lying. So after that interaction, that left a bad taste in my mouth.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,14,12,3,eGejjcTWDe4wqfckJEdxhw
