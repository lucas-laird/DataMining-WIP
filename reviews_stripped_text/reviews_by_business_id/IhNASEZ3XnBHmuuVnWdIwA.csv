Hands down some of the best boba we've had and Houston is no joke when it comes to our boba. One of the employees was nice to answer our questions and gave her recommendations. We decided on taro milk tea (made from real taro) and a combo of the hokkaido and Okinawa milk tea. Both request to be half sweet with boba and wow, we were impressed instantly. Our taste buds were satisfied and tea was strong enough but does not hinder the other flavors. Definitely a high recommendation for anyone in Vegas to come check this place out.

267583,2016-01-05,2,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"First of all, this is long overdue. Ever since I found out about Brew Tea Bar in Sept 2015, they've been continually providing over the top boba drinks as of this review (Jan 2016). Usually places lose their touch after a while, but not this boba joint.

From someone who's had boba drinks from San Fran, LA, Hong Kong, NY, I gotta say, this place is comparable to places like Purple Kow, Sharetea, Cool tea bar in SF, Half and half in LA, and Gong Cha from when I had it in HK. What the heck, I'm going to say its better than all these places. Why? Not because their boba drinks are the best, but they provide the best service and tailor to your taste.

Service: This place stands out for its service. Other places may make boba drinks just as good, but I've never had this much great customer service, even when they are slammed (which they constantly are). They always ask you how much sweet you like in your drink, and if you are not satisfied, they WILL remake it for you. They know the recommended amount of sweet to add so it's always the right amount. They always know my name when I enter the joint, maybe it's because I frequent them too often :)

Drinks: They offer a latte style, which they add cream on top of your drinks. Normally you see this at places in SF, but BTB does it just enough so that it's just creamy enough. They also can top your drink with sea salt and/or Matcha powder. They also have grass jelly, it's a secret menu thing. They are also serious about their herbal teas, with tea leaves like Chrysanthemum, Ginger, Rooibus, Hawaiian Paradise, etc. They steep it on the spot, so it's not premade or artificial. Their honey boba is always warm and chewy. If you get a cold drink with boba, you'll notice the bottom of your drink is always warm because of the boba.

Back before BTB, my go to places for boba were Icy Juicy and Tea Station. The drink needs to have a hint of tea, perfect sweetness, and chewy boba, that's all. Other places were good at one point, then became hit and miss. BTB has now filled that void and has not disappointed yet. They also have dessert crepes if you feel like something else besides boba. Louie makes a bad a#* crepe.

Recommendations: Oolong latte (green mountain, half sweet), Matcha Green tea (half sweet), lychee peachy (no sweet), Brew milk tea (half sweet), mango latte (half sweet), Okinawa (half sweet as well), Ginger and Rooibus herbal tea, Taro slush topped with real taro",IegXTpaLReHvm2PSH7sGZw,2,2,5,kR_-KQJfnOZGvRiMFiEjGw

Our drinks were speedy, so there was no waiting for them a long time.

370917,2016-01-17,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"I love how they have sea salt coffee/jasmine tea here, it's the first in Vegas!

At first, I didn't think this place was that special. The sea salt drinks were okay, but they can't be compared to places in SoCal. But after going there a few more times, I started to really like their coffee latte, though I still think SoCal is better, but since I can't go as often now, this is as good as I can get within 5 minute driving distance.

Come here at least once a week during my work days, and order the coffee latte, keeps me awake for the rest of the day. 

Their honey boba is the perfect texture. There were a few times that the boba was too soft or too hard, but hey, I come here like 50 times already, and 2-3 times of inconsistencies is really not bad at all.

I also like how they use real taro in their taro milk tea, the taro taste is much more subtle than the powder version, but at least I know this drink is made with the real thing. I know they started making it with half powder and half real taro because some people didn't believe it was a taro drink because the color is not purple... so if you want real taro, ask for it, they will make it with 100% taro.

Just tried the Hokkaido/Okinawa mix with honey boba, perfect combination! I love Hokkaido milk tea, but sometimes it's just too creamy, but if you mix it with Okinawa, it's just perfect amount of creaminess and tea flavor. 

Also, a great plus is... you can adjust the sugar level! I don't think they explicitly state that, but I always ask for less sugar, and they have always made it the way I wanted.",UKn1PEDDL8SbsQwSnA8O_g,0,0,4,TypJ0OLU2NCFmt1U4QRteg

399464,2017-10-26,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"There hasn't been much said about this place that hasn't been said already. Brew Tea Bar has cemented itself as the premier boba spot in Las Vegas. Every local knows of this spot and the simple design of it's cups is recognizable anywhere around the valley. There's even people who come from other states who make the journey to try the teas and boba here. I remember growing up in Vegas Boba wasn't really as popular as it is now. The go to spot was Volcano tea and they had the very basics. Being Taiwanese I've been to Taiwan many times and Taiwan is of course the birthplace of Boba. It doesn't get any better than Taiwan. I used to come back wishing there was something that could match the incredible flavors found in the far east yet volcano was the only and best option at the time and I had given up on any hope of finding something better. Fast forward a few years and it's my first visit to brew tea which was a couple weeks after opening. I was greeted by a helpful  employee who broke down the menu and popular items. I proceeded to get Hokkaido milk tea cause it sounded cool and with my first sip I discovered a flavor that seemed to be lost to me since childhood. I finished my drink and proceeded to come back 4/7 days that week. 

Service: Top Notch. 100%. The owners are always there in the trenches working alongside the workers and every employee there is personable and friendly. They take their time and give every guest the attention they need while also being able manage packed crowds and busting out drinks in record time. I never have to worry about a long wait even if the line is out the door as their efficiency is proven and I'll know i'll get my order in no time. They always invite you to ask for adjustments if necessary and they do it with no questions asked. There's also a reward system where if you get 10 drinks the next regular sized one is free which is great as it's always good to reward frequent customers. And personally I've abused this perk many times over. This place didn't become the go to spot in Vegas off of it's product alone but coupled along with it's excellent service brew leaves just as much a lasting impression as its teas. 

Teas: Everything here is good. You literally can not go wrong as long as it's something you'd normally partake in or enjoy. Even stepping out of your comfort zone at times leads to pleasant  surprises. The tea is fresh and the ratio from sweetness to ice is all customizable so you can get the perfect flavor profile. I can't stress enough how refreshing these teas are. The boba is also made fresh everyday and contrary to popular belief boba making is an art and to get that perfect texture of softness and chewiness couple with the right temperature with the teas is work of art and brew masters it. And of course the sea salt cream is absolutely addicting and can make an regular drink that much more enjoyable. It's a savory treat as you taste it little but little as it mixes with your tea and at the end it's just all there to be engulfed. The ultimate guilty pleasure. 

Crepes: The crepes here are all handmade as well and although it doesn't follow any traditional techniques they are still delicious and it's a perfect accompaniment to your drinks especially if you're hanging out with a group of friends. Personally I love the aroma that surrounds this place when the crepes are being made as it's definitely a inviting yet delicious scent. 

This is the closest thing to Boba found overseas and everything about this place is top notch. I come here at lease once a week if not more and I've spent many hours here sitting with friends and hanging out. They've been open for awhile now and yet the quality has never gone down in the slightest sense. If you ever wondered what the best boba place in Vegas is this is the place. Hands down.

447695,2016-01-02,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"First things first, this is the best boba place I have ever been to. Coming from California that's quite a bold statement, but it's so easy to justify.

Me and some friends stumbled on this place just browsing yelp looking for a place to get some boba. Little did we know that we would end up stopping by every night for the next 3 days. 

The first thing you notice right off the bat is the service. The staff that are making the drinks are extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the drinks and will encourage you to let them know if a drink isn't up to your standards so that they can remake it.

Some notable drinks I tried:
- Hokkaido Milk Tea - Supremely creamy. Would taste amazing with some egg pudding.
- Okinawa Milk Tea - Like the Hokkaido but slightly less rich.
- Taro Milk Tea - FRESH taro, excellent milkshake-like texture. Doesn't feel like drinking sand. 
- Mixed Fruits Tea - I think this was mixed with orange juice and lime? Really nice and refreshing tart flavor. They recommend getting this with aloe.
- Jasmine Milk Tea - Very fragrant tea. 

Honestly I don't think you can go wrong. All of their teas have really superb tea flavor that lingers throughout the drink. You can adjust the sweetness of the drinks, but even the 100% sweet isn't a sugar overload like most places. They only list a few toppings on the menu, but they have a lot more. The honey boba had excellent texture and chew. The grass jelly has a good amount of herbal flavor. The egg pudding is subtly sweet and has great texture as well.

Even if you are staying on the strip, I would highly recommend that you pay a visit  to this small establishment. It is definitely worth it.",5EQnJI0p5Jnu0Bjhj4aaQw,2,1,5,21PP1I1ZR2Msrs9oUTQPAQ

When I first came, I got the Hokkaido Milk Tea with boba, and egg pudding: perfect combination. It was flawless, also lactose free, and when the drink was delivered the drink maker made sure to say ""if anything is wrong with it, let me know and we'll adjust it for you!""
Second time I went I got the Hawaiian Paradise: only comes in large, and when I asked the order taker if it could be made a milk tea, she explained in detail why this drink should not be made a milk tea. At first I was confused when the drink was taking a while, and when I was going to get up to ask about it, the order taker actually pointed at a pot that was brewing my tea, right in front of me. The drink is amazing, and semi-citrusy, not too bitter, kind of like a perfect bitter.
Finally the last time I went, which made me want to make a yelp to review them, I got a coffee milk tea. Never had anything like it. Super unique and different. Boba goes well with this milk tea.

DRINKS: The Cantaloupe Green Tea with Lychee Jelly and Boba is my go to drink here. It is rare flavor to find and I love it. The most popular drink here between my friends and family is the hot, cold, and frozen taro milk tea. Everyone who has had it love the fact that their are actual taro pieces in the drink. Their specialty teas are highly recommended because they brew it to order.

FOOD: Their ice cream crepes are extremely popular for those who aren't in the mood for a drink or just want something different. You can watch them make it right in front of you!

ATMOSPHERE: This boba shop is cleanly decorated and has few seating. It is always busy and fun. The staff is well trained. They are all really friendly and are concerned whether or not the drinks are made to you liking. They are diligent and all have the recipe down.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,11,10,5,n65yhvYQ4XRxgZ_WAOMT-g

1058843,2015-09-16,1,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"I have to admit, I can see why BTB has such a high rating. They exceed your expectations and more. 

The customer service was just WOW. I was blown away. I came in not knowing what I wanted but that was quickly changed after the cashier helped me out. I have to give a shout out to Sou and Dennis. You guys rock! You guys got me hooked onto everything!

The drinks were out of this world. Or at least this country. I recently visited Taiwan (birthplace of boba) and had a lot of different boba. BTB was the closest I can get a taste of Taiwan. The boba itself was soft, warm, and sweet unlike other places that are reminiscent of pellets. The drinks were so fresh. You can taste the quality in all of them. 

I needed a quick picker upper since I had a long drive back to LA. So I decided to get their coffee. I was torn between that or the sea salt oolong. Sou mentioned that I could actually get sea salt coffee and that hit the spot! 85 has nothing on them!! This coffee had it all; it had the punch, the creaminess, and sweet/savory aspect. I would definitely recommend any of their tea lattes any day of the week. 

Their Hokkaido Milk tea was better than most places. It had just the right amount of sweetness where the condensed milk doesn't overpower the flavor of the tea. But my palette is different than yours so if your drink is too sweet you can actually change it, free of charge. Of course that goes for any drinks on the menu. 

I can't wait to go back! Definitely worth the drive. Keep up the good work guys!!",rArsYXbKmpuaZBdnpVcCQw,1,1,5,FVgpef5wHmVnpDDSrjd1pw

The staff are all very welcoming, friendly, and EFFICIENT. Although it gets super busy and crowded with lines out the door being it's a small shop, don't let that discourage you from ordering because they are quick. Brew Tea is the best boba shop I've ever been to in Vegas. I would even go far as to say Brew Tea would top any boba shop's in Cali as well. One time I was surprised to bump into a girl-friend of mines who was in town from the Bay Area, and I haven't seen this girl in over 6 years. She obviously heard great things about this place. 

My Go-To-Drink: Hokkaido Milk Tea (has a creamy rich milk taste). SO ADDICTING (tears). I like to substitute mines with Almond Milk as a non-dairy option. 

Try it with boba or egg pudding topping. Can I just add that their boba (tapioca pearls) are cooked to perfection!It never gets hard. It is always soft even after it sits in the iced drink for 20+ mins. That's hard to do. Can't forget their famous Sea Salt Cream they add on top. Ask for a little of it as it can overpower your drink.  

Other goodies I liked: Mango slush, Mango Green Tea (hot or cold), and the Sweet Crepe's... yesss.

Everything is just perfect. My only wish is if they could take over the empty unit next to them, so there's enough room and tables to hang out at. *Cross Fingers*",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,1,1,5,6L081wiGLXhP8xvaqjWLfw

Taro slush, Honeydew, Hokkaido, Oolong Honeydew, Mango slush, Sunset on the Beach, Oolong Latte... all the flavors have been very pleasant. I go here quite a lot.

The boba is timed, fresh, and made to perfection. They throw out their unused boba and only serve fresh. 
Their boba is sweet, soft, and chewy, just like it SHOULD be! If you want hard, stale, old boba then go somewhere else because you obviously don't know what boba is. 

The egg pudding is just right. It's soft, sweet, and holds its consistency. The flavor is definitely there!  Other boba tea shops try to make it but failed. Other boba tea shops in Vegas make it too liquidly bland where the pudding breaks apart and dissolves into the drink. That's just not right at all.

Have you tried their crepes? Loovvveee it!!! Seriously check this place out!",_UUmslYG8Y-IYFf8rHl0Ww,4,3,5,kChNjTDhXaIRbhIexy3n2g

Brew Tea Bar is in my opinion the best option for boba and asian tea drinks available in Las Vegas. I've only been there twice so far so I've yet to see if they have their off days but as of right now both of the beverages that I've had were great AND cheap.

The service is fantastic. They have a 100% guarantee that you will enjoy your drink and if not, they will make you a new one. All of the employees are kind and knowledgeable of their menu.

I think my only gripe is that the venue is so small. I like loungey feeling cafes similiar to the places they have in California where you can just hang out and chill.

Went out of town and was busy after coming back so been on a 2 1/2 week hiatus from coming here. Upon entry... LOL they still remember my name XD why me D: Lol 

So this time around, i got to try the rose milk tea. Less sweet, more tea flavor requested ! just like how i like it ! Their milk tea base is already good, now with rose added to it. Its just as youd imagine how rose would ""taste"" like from its smell. hard to describe for me XD 

My friend requested a custom drink for herself. Strawberry milk tea. Strawberry isnt a fruit that would come out so well and easily done when mixed with milk tea. Either you'd get it diabetes style with tons of sugar and powder and what not (yep a lot of people do this) or you'd mix with a syrup/jam or even fresh fruit. to be honest, i forgot what he did but as their way of style goes, they'll keep remaking it until you like it. 1st one was more ""sour"". true to a fresh strawberry taste ""breaking through"" the milk tea taste but as requested, less sweet. Pretty good. Has a nice strawberry flavor with its unique ""sourness"" but not masking the tea flavor either. He came around with a 2nd one for us to try. i guess he was experimenting with what he had. He tried to make it less sour with a stronger tea flavor. yeah indeed he did that but we thought the 1st one was more ""Strawberry characteristic-like"" XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,4,5,_aOLRcvbc4fUGQzHQLpxKg

Pros

Brew Milk Tea: I always like to try out an original milk tea from each new place since its sets the baseline for comparison. Overall they did an excellent job on a basic drink and it's one of my favorites from their menu. 

Lychee-Peachy Green Tea: refreshing and not overly sweetened beverage. Ask for it less sweet or non sweet to enjoy the natural flavors. 

Tea Latte: tried the jasmine and oolong black tea which are delicious! My favorite drink so far from BTB is their smoky oolong latte which has a bolder flavor. Their version of the sea salt cream is velvety. 

Service: the owner and the rest of the staff were very friendly. They make an effort to make the drink as to how you like it. 

Cons:

Boba: my only dislike was their boba which was more on the hard side. It didn't have the chewy and soft consistency and it was a bit bland on the taste. 

Overall, BTB fulfilled my cravings for milk tea while being away from home. Hope the great quality of drinks stays the same when I return.",-pzlhxN6-DtuvpX4blnTxw,8,9,5,sPPOnff0Xe62KE9gSmHbMQ

A specialty that Brew Tea Bar serves is the milk tea latte: a tea of your choice as the base infused with sea salt creamer. It might sound a whole lot of weirdness at first, but give it a try! I personally loved the black tea latte. I've also tried their passion fruit green tea with less sugar and Hokkaido milk tea which were both good.

First off, their service here is amazing, and they make every attempt to make sure your experience is pleasant. They're not as attentive as before, but they have definitely gotten a lot busier, so I completely understand. 
Although they may not explicitly tell you, you can customize your drink to make it less sweet or even take on the option to mix flavors. I do think their drinks are on the sweeter side, but just let them know you want it less sweet, and you should be good! My go-to drinks here are jasmine latte with boba and the rooibos tea with herbal jelly. There are still a few drinks that I have yet to try, and I do plan to try everything..but I always end up getting my favorites! Crepes are also really good. I would recommend getting one yourself and not sharing. My boyfriend and I got one to share and devoured it in 3 minutes..
So why 4 stars if I love this place? Mainly because of inconsistency. I've noticed my drinks taste different sometimes, and the consistency of the boba can vary. However, it doesn't bother me too much. Their place is still new, and I believe that a few more months can fix that problem.",uuscKYelhweXn_fLVtcf5A,4,2,4,BNhU5YY3XzMm6iMZo5rqsQ

I also love how the employees remember me and my boyfriend! We come here so often that sometimes they give us a large instead of a regular drink, which is AWESOME!

1600405,2015-07-30,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"Honestly i was about to give up bc i've taste tested a couple of their drinks (hokkaido milk tea, mango slush, rose milk tea, caramel milk tea) and though they were all decent, none of them fit my personal taste preferences. That's not brew tea's fault though. 
Then lord, sweet looord i tried the oolong latte with sea salt cream. Coming from someone that loves a good strong tea, I can't describe the taste other than heavenly. They don't use any of that powder crap that other Chinatown establishments use, and you can definitely taste the difference. I ask for less sea salt cream because I think their standard serving of cream at the top is a bit too much and can overpower the tea after you mix it. 
The jasmine latte also had a wonderful fragrance. However, the jasmine tea and the sea salt cream don't go together nearly as well as oolong and the cream do. My go-to drink is now oolong latte - i freakin love it. 
I order my drinks without boba because though their boba is decent, it's not as good as Kung Fu Tea's in my opinion. A bit too chewy and not very sweet.

1609799,2016-02-16,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"Brew Tea Bar is one of the newest boba additions to Las Vegas, and its location is convenient to those who do not want to drive down Spring Mountain. They sell crepes which is different compared to other boba shops that sell fried snacks or meals. The shop itself is small and tends to get cramped when there is a rush.

SERVICE
Very customer friendly, but one time I was trying to receive an adjustment on my drink and it took 5-8 minutes because an employee was talking to a customer (maybe a regular). Most of the time they are attentive and will make adjustments to your liking.

DRINKS
I find it interesting that they make their drinks in a blender compared to a shaker. 

5/5 Okinawa Milk Tea with boba (reminds me of a regular boba milk tea from Hawaii). 

4/5 Sea salt jasmine green tea with boba extra sweet (stir the sea salt into the jasmine for a delicious finish).

5/5 Chrysanthemum tea is freshly brewed and very refreshing (may want to get it extra sweet). 

1/5 Hokkaido Milk Tea, I did not enjoy because it was too creamy and milky for liking. 

0/5 slushies, every time my friend has ordered a slush it was too watery like a milk tea (maybe that's just my preference). 

CONCLUSION
Nice addition to the boba shops in Vegas. Friendly employees and a great place to study.",SNHHpdXqxZFMBTTbKsBrAA,1,1,4,R3aHupVDikBrHnym0x95Mg

Thoes are the first two words that come to mind.  
Perhaps once a week I like to enjoy a boba style milk tea, and for the most part they're all good. At least with my regular spots.  However I steered clear from this particular place for a while because the similar business that owned that suite before was ran by yahoos and were slower  than a cold syrup. 
Though recently I gave it a shot because im lately noticing a high flow of traffic into the establishment than of course there's the extraordinary amount of positive reviews and rock star ratings. 
The menus have a great variety. Surely something for everyone, and they're very simple to understand.  The staff though is very impressive as far as making you feel extremely welcome, and they've been more than happy to describe their drinks when asked.  The best part is that the staff is consistent with their positive tone in customer service.  
The business has been open for several months yet still carries a very fresh and clean appearance. 
There always seems to be at least 3 employees and they know how to put their work in first before fun.  The amount of time it takes to turn out drink orders is on point and their crepes may obviously take a bit more time but when you see the presentation you know exactly why. 
It's too bad I didn't check it out sooner as it's nothing but satisfying from entering the joint and all the way to the point when you're popping the lid and crunching the creme stained ice within thoes last hard to get bobas.  I now go every time im within that business center, and that's a lot. Check it for yourself.",J8BZWFTwwwcgNXpFqAaksg,1,1,5,TB-GUEWAwd1FccMGCIeq8w

I haven't tried too many others because I know I like those so I want to stick with them. I think I should try new ones next time and be brave. I haven't been here for at least 3 months because of my recent no sugar diet. I came once and tried no sugar and I sweeten it myself. Sorry, but it wasn't good. I've decided substituting here doesn't work too well. So instead I come less often and get a drink with less sweetness. It seems to work better that way so I can enjoy my drink. 

Louis is always exceptionally friendly, nice, and cares about his customers. He remembers what I like which is amazing with all the business and customers he gets. Don't be afraid, ask for them to fix your drink if you don't like it. I'm positive they want you to like your drink and they always ask if I like it which I appreciate. I've turned many people on to BTB because it is good stuff. When I used to come more often I wasn't sure that I didn't taste the ""tea"" as much and I tasted more milk taste. I'm still not tasting as much tea but I do understand that the balance is important. I've tried their tea without milk and its strong and somewhat bitter which is not bad as opposed to weak watered down tea which is not good. I would be curious to try some teas without milk in the future to lessen the calories.

The taro I believe is made from flavor powder but don't take my word for it. The scoop on top is for sure real taro and that was really good.,NdIsA48xd2qMnZbjqSC5Vg,0,1,5,urnwgbsjlZWhR39jfZZL4w

I did a search on Yelp one day at work to see which boba place was the closest and that's how I discovered this place. It's now become a weekly visit to get my boba fix. 

The milk teas are my favorite and they can even be a meal replacement for my quick lunches. They are creamy, sweet and full of flavor, especially if you add things to them like honey boba and the newly discovered sea salt cream which took my drink to the next level. It all may sound a little weird but it's not and everything works so beautifully together creating a very luxurious tea time experience. 

The folks who work here are super nice and greet everyone immediately as they step in and they even have a rewards card! Buy 10 teas and get 1 free. This is a really nice touch! 

My favorite drink is the Hokkaido (tastes like milk & honey), and they also have a great Thai tea, oolong, matcha, jasmine and almond. Lots of great choices & the only one that was too strong for me was the rose milk tea. 

The tea house itself is tiny and super contemporary. I love it's charm and I've become a regular here. Looking forward to experimenting with more options and trying more flavors.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,37,36,5,UIWnLe_ZhXVPkRgsMBlDHw

1773324,2017-03-01,1,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"Updating my review after coming here regularly (well try to) for about a year and a half now. I have been to many other bubble tea places in Vegas and this place is still my favorite spot. The drinks are ALWAYS consistent no matter who's working. I never had a single drink that I didn't like or had to make any adjustments to my drinks. 

I have waaay too many favorites here but my new favorite and go-to is their iced Yerba Mate tea w/ sea salt cream half sweet (thank you Mara :)). I'm not sure how to describe their mate but it has a distinct and earthy taste. Another tea recommendation I have is their Oolong tea (the black/smokey one over the green tea one). If you want something sweet , you can never go wrong with their classic Brew milk tea , Hokkaido or Okinawa. Their mate is quite caffeinated but their cold brew w/ sea salt cream is very very good if you want coffee. It's similar to Vietnamese iced coffee but not as sweet. I absolutely love their cold brew because it doesn't give insulin dump like coffee you get from other places.

They have the highest quality tea that is made upon ordering (none of that powdered stuff). When a place has over 800 reviews and still maintains a 5 star rating that's really impressive. I can't wait for their new menu to come out too. I'm always willing to drive the 20-30 minutes just for their drinks here :9 Brew is the best.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,5,3,5,LMsjt7Mx_VQnE6Lf4RiJ0w

They also had this ""if you dont like it, well make you another drink np"" policy. After some experimenting, I found MY drink. I came across it because this girl had a peculiar looking drink in her hand and I had to be nosey and asked her about it. BLACK TEA LATTE yall!

So far I have tried the jasmine tea with sea salt cream as the manager recommended and I vouch for that. The second time I visited, I tried to compare their honey green tea with kung fu's, about the same but Kung fu tea is still better by just a hair. Next visit I tried the Hokkaido milk tea, not sure how it was supposed to taste like but it was good. My recent visit I wanted to try their ""brew"" milk tea. I had one problem here, that it was nothing unique about it. If it had a nick name for their milk tea, it should have been something I have never tried before, besides a regular milk tea. But overall it was good still. My girlfriend tried the mango green tea, a bit sour but it is what to expect from a mango drink. 

I love the customer service, they always have smiles on their faces and helpful to what you may want. Also they ask you if you need any other adjustments in case you don't like it.

LEAVE because they close eventually, you hate tea (they have coffee?), or prefer impersonal service.

Since day one this place has been packed and for good reason. South Rainbow has serious Spring Mountain Rd (Chinatown) needs that businesses are starting to fill. Good tea and boba is priority. Enter Brew Tea Bar.

The menu is dominated by tea that needs to be brewed when you order it. Hey, it's in the name! This means total control over the quality of tea per cup goes to the crew and they have it down. Consistency is high, flavor is always well-rounded. Every aspect of your drink is adjustable. Sweetness, ice, and even a re-do if you're not happy with it. They want you to be happy with your order so don't be shy if something isn't to your liking.

My favorites, in no particular order:
Jasmine anything
Hokkaido milk tea
Taro anything
Lavender tea
Coffee milk tea

Of course, there's boba. It's made a bit on the softer side. Egg pudding. Crepes with ice cream. Iced water, too, if that's your thing. Seating is limited so half the time you may need to grab-and-go.",jaEDhTO1Xy6qzxdruF25Tg,3,4,5,s3aeEyRYVUtw6N5OsdkQSw

""Hey you haven't treated me to BTB is a long long time...I want some BTB NOW!!!""

I don't know if your taste buds ever yell at you... But when mine yell...i tend to listen... Cuz you know... My taste buds have always made my tummy happy. :) And a happy tummy for me means that I'll have a have an overall happy day... So off i went to BTB....:) Cuz well i gotta have happy taste buds right???

Service had not changed! It was great! I got greeted right away and offered a menu which i didn't need... Cuz well...i get the same thing... The Brew Tea milk tea with egg pudding(best egg pudding in Vegas)... And the taro slush(gotta get the fresh taro scoop... So freaking amazeballs)... Don't get me wrong... Every other flavor that i have ever tried has been fantastic. I told them no i didn't need the menu and i placed my order. Some of the staff has changed but it was awesome that one of them that has been there since opening remembered me and greeted me by name! Maybe it's cuz i suck at remembering names... But that just totally blow my mind! That i haven't been there in almost 6 months and he remembered!  Service(5/5)... In other words service is always outta this world!

The tea and the slush...omg... So freaking good. I was worried that with Kung Fu tea opening across the street that they would have some competition... But i don't think so. I went there just cuz i had to try them... But they don't compare to BTB.  I feel like BTB is like the gourmet tea place for adults that want good tea flavors and Kung Fu Tea is for the kiddies that just want to look cool.

To first start about our experience the service, we received exceptional service from who I can only assume is the owner or manager of the place. He was very friendly to us, making small talk and emphasizing that we can keep coming back to ask for adjustments to our drinks until we're completely satisfied. I hear this from many people at other boba shops, but there is a different kind of vibe you get from him where you can tell he truly cares about you having a good experience there. He even came up to us after we tasted our drinks to make sure the sweetness level was fine, since it was something we were unsure about when we chose it to be less sweet.

As for the drinks themselves, we got the brew milk tea and the jasmine milk tea. Both drinks were done very well! We got 75% sweetness, which my friend thought was good, but I think I'll go for 50% next time because I thought it was a little too sweet. We can't say anything about the boba, though, since we didn't try it.

Overall, it was a great experience. It was significantly better than several places we've tried in Southern California, so kudos for satisfying our milk tea cravings while we were away from home. We recommend anyone in the area who need their milk tea fixes to come here.",oUuKrzCjFruVVtCW8NOjJQ,1,1,5,Ju6_-gXdmZ5bZiguLHddRg

Anyways, I believe that Brew Tea Bar is THE absolute go-to place for the best milk tea boba in the city. Every time I get boba, it's just the right amount of softness and squish (except for that one time where my friend and I got the very last batch of boba). I've tried a variety of their milk teas, but my absolutely favorite is the Hokkaido Milk Tea. One time I even told them to surprise me with a milk tea (which put some pressure on them haha) and they ended up giving me Coconut Milk Tea. I'm not usually fond of coconut, but the drink was gone before I knew it. One of the great things to note about their flavors such as Taro Milk Tea and Coconut Milk Tea is that they use /real/ taro and /real/ coconut, which is probably why I really enjoyed the Coconut Milk Tea!

As for brewed teas, I've only had an Iced Rooibos Tea (I forgot how to spell it) w/ honey, which I have become addicted to lately. Each brewed tea is brewed with loose leaf tea and customers even have the option of taking a whiff of the tea leaves. I'm not sure if this goes for all brewed teas, but my drink was only available in large.

I'm also very fond of their sea salt lattes, but one time I had a drink that was ridiculously salty and I didn't really think to tell them about how salty it was until I mindlessly drank half of my drink; however, Sou wanted to make sure that my drink was enjoyable and he ended up replacing the entire drink. KUDOS even though I felt bad for drinking half of the drink already. Customer service is definitely an importance at this establishment!

I wouldn't recommend coming here to study due to the limited amount of space for seating, but it's possible if you're studying with at least up to 3 other people to avoid one person to a table for 4. The staff is extremely friendly and have been personable for my regular BTB experience and I'm really glad that they chose to open up their business in Las Vegas even though it's a bit of a drive from my home.

BTB is not a huge place but the vibe is very welcoming. Menu can be a little difficult to see on the board but laminated menus are available too. I love the natural color used inside!

Their regular sweetness is 4 pumps so I tried 4 for my first visit and 2 for second. 4 pumps may feel a little too sweet so some as they use honey boba too. But the ""Latte"" I added gave it a good amount of saltiness and helped with the sweetness! Their ""Latte"" was very different from what I am typically used too. A lot more saltier than a lot of places I know. I like it though. I love salt! 2 pumps of sweetness almost felt like there was no sweetness, but the tea was still great.

First time here I order the Rose bud tea and even though it looks so good and so pretty I wasn't a fan. To me I felt like it had a weird fermented taste or kimchi flavor. I know sounds completely crazy but then again that's what I thought. It had honey in it but the flavor was very vague. Then I came back to try another drink and was excited about the sea salt foam. I ordered the Oolong green tea with foam and honey boba. When I got it I was thrilled that it had good tea flavor chilled but the boba itself was not that amazing. It was pretty bland and lacking honey flavor. For the most part the boba was cooked perfectly I just wish it was a little sweeter. The foam was a nice touch but I guess it didn't really impress me much. 

I will definitely be back and ask for my drinks to be more sweeter to see if that will make a difference but for now my take on the Brew Tea Bar is that all the drinks their starts of very bland.

I always go with the large sized drink fruit (Passion Fruit, Lychee, Mango, Kiwi) green teas + honey boba. They would even ask if the drink tasted okay or if it needs to be more or less sweetened. Had a lot of stamped cards accumulated to get me free drinks after!

Pros
-Management and staff provide Excellent customer service because you can see the sense of urgency in every staff, they always offer to change your drink if Unsatisfied and EVERYONE smiles. 
- regardless of long lines out the door.. the team works together very fast and on top of every order.
-Jasmine Milk tea is my Favorite here. You can really taste the fresh brewed tea, cream of gold, perfect sweetness and they DO NOT charge you for No Ice (like Lofttie Cafe does.. Dumbest thing I've heard). 
- boba is perfectly sweet with the right amount of chewiness.


Cons
- I am a big herbal/grass jelly fan.. however not a fan of How Brew Tea makes it. A few chunks of their Grass jelly gives a very Weird Gritty Unpleasant texture, while some others are normal and smooth. I wish their grass jelly was cut into much larger sizes, more light and very Very soft (Like Kung fu's herbal jelly)

Regardless.. their drinks are addictively good Because you can taste all the fresh goodness that goes inside of it.

2. Awesome customer service!!  When they give you your drink, they always tell you to taste it to see that it is to your satisfaction!! :)  It always is, but WOW on the nice customer service touch!
3. Fast!!! There is likely to be a line for drinks this great but hold your thirst, it moves fast.  They are efficient and fast at crafting brewteafully yummy teas!!
4. The owner is so nice and genuine! Talking to him, you can tell this is his passion; a true labor of love!!

Been coming here since they opened and I wish them continued success!!!  :)

I absolutely love the Hokkaido Milk Tea here, also had the Thai Tea as well and I was definitely pleased with both. The Hokkaido Milk Tea is smooth, creamy and sweet. I have yet to have Milk Tea like this anywhere else and maybe this has to do with the sea salt cream in their drinks, whatever it is it keeps me coming back. 

I went here with my fianc√© here during the weekend at night and it was pretty busy but they were still very fast and attentive. The workers are also very friendly.

I also love the fact that you can order crepes here, I did not get to order one while I was there but I definitely want to try one during my next visit.",KHt4wF6kXQZTAZ485SIv6g,0,0,5,feF_ZbV9VrQEwkdflijTnw

2330367,2016-04-29,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"best. boba. ever! small place located in a plaza with albertsons. plenty of parking. there's usually a line on weekends, so be prepared to wait! 

was visiting vegas with my boyfriend for the weekend. on a suggestion from his manager, we decided to try it out. i love the casual feel of the place and how they have their menu on chalkboards with their prices next to the size. 

what can i say? a place with 400+ reviews and it's STILL a 5 star business on yelp? how much better can you get?

the teas are definitely on par with the teas back at 626. my first drink was the lychee peach green tea and it was amazing! not too sweet and you can still taste the flavor of the tea. my boyfriend opted for the lychee green tea and it's one of the best he's had. the second time i came in, i opted for lychee green tea with lychee jelly while my boyfriend got the mango lattee tea. the mango lattee tea was definitely something we've never had before. the cream on top reminded us of a hokkaido cream. definitely something to try out! 

service is awesome. if you don't like the tea or the tea is too sweet for you, they're willing to, not only fix the drink, but also make you a brand new drink. i've heard of places remaking the drink, but have never seen a place make a brand new one. definitely some brownie points for that!

10/5 chance that i'm coming back when i visit vegas again. and no, that wasn't a typo ;)",I-JDoQIFZy2HP9TNWCMdQA,0,0,5,q566M98Sd1Erswlwy_FvWg
2332517,2015-08-14,1,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"Talk about ""Hot New Business"" yelp style. Not often get into the whole boba drinks but every once in while get my boba on. Brew Tea Bar forget the boba (not literal sense because every time stopped by added boba) truly about the Teas. Boba balls are by itself the bomb. I love that not only generous with the amount but the texture and flavor of the boba. Tea not something I normally drink more of espresso or sugar coffee drinks get at Starbucks. Brew Tea Bar opened my eyes to another world and really the best part is lot more refreshing then coffee. The endless amount of flavors that can choose from besides you can come up with your own combination. The styles from the milk teas, my favorite the sea salt creme (not idea what it is but all I know is creme layer on top, and once stir around makes the world go around in perfect tea harmony), or slush. Think missing one other style. As you can imagine am sure there is something for everyone. The guys are extremely knowledgeable about the Tea they serve very impressed. They can even break down history lesson if you want. My first visit tried the Mango Sea Salt Creme. I mention earlier talk about refreshing drink! It not only had the right amount of mango flavor but add the Creme it was divine. I associated more like Thai Ice Tea with the Creme but at WHOLE another level cause Mango much more refreshing and more addicting. If you like sweet drink any of the Sea Salt Creme only way. 

My second visit tried the Berry Lovers Crepe. Talk about all giddy for Crepes. I went with my roommates for desserts after dinner. My roommate was telling me never seen me more excited about food. It been long time recall having good crepe. The pictures saw on yelp looked amazing. I watching the gentlemen put together the crepe fresh, every step putting on the fresh fruit, whip cream, nutella, and then the kicker green tea ice cream. It really was seeing artist painting his mona lisa. Truly looked that good had no idea the best way to attack it. I was in awe of it. The flavors was unreal good. The combination of nutella and green tea ice cream. Never thought of or think would be that addicting. It was beyond addicting was the perfect marriage of flavors. All the fresh fruit the strawberries, blueberries, and think bananas. No bruises on any of the fruit, all looked hell of fresh, and each one tasted sweet. The Green Tea Ice Cream you would have to add on. The Green Tea Ice Cream is by far the best Green Tea Ice Cream ever had in life. I asked them if could order scoop of it by itself the next time. It super expensive stuff they could not afford sell it by the scoop. I can understand why cause the depth of the ice cream unreal. Never had one that strong of green tea flavor but yet perfect balance nice creamy and still taste like ice cream. The portion size if great. My roommates shared one while I eat whole one myself. I made room for dessert. lol. I also ordered the Taro Slush with boba wash it all down. The scoop of fresh Taro on top really nice touch and tasted awesome. I love the color of the Taro in drinks and the Taro Slush not only looked the part but tasted the part. If looking for filling drink the Taro Slush is the way to go. Between the crepe and Taro Slush. I could barely stand up for all the food/drink., 

My third visit tried the Coconut milk tea. Talk about Haupia! It was the perfect liquid Haupia drink. So so so refreshing. 

Only draw back is the place is small so when it gets crowded no place sit down. The decor is pretty plain outside of the cool Brew Tea Bar sign. I enjoy the asian style tables. The way they display all the base teas in glass jars. The fact that can see them make the crepes. Cool. It perfect entertainment for the kids. The whole staff at Brew Tea Bar is super friendly, know their Tea, and by the second visit all within same week the guy remembered my name. They have stamp card program ten stamps the next one free.

The place is small and often busy, which isn't my favorite atmosphere, but they run the line pretty fast so even when it's busy so it doesn't take forever. 

Even if this was really close to me I think I would avoid it as my ""main"" tea place just because of the crowd. I don't disagree that it may be the best tea house in Vegas but I think the degree of separation between the best tea and the second best is so small that it would be unnoticeable to the casual tea drinker.

We found Brew on Yelp (duh) and I was excited to see what the commotion was about. Service here is stellar; Sou (I'm sorry if I spelled that wrong!) saw us staring at the menu and came around the counter to suggest some drinks. I decided on the Okinawa milk tea (brown sugar flavor) with boba at normal sweetness, and my boyfriend got the mango green tea at normal sweetness. We also got the classic crepe with whipped cream (bananas, Nutella, strawberries). As we waited for everything to come out (and it wasn't much of a wait despite the crowd), Sou let me sample the lychee jelly and the pudding (I'm coming back for a tea with that jelly in it!) I could go on and on about his customer service skills, but let's just say that we felt welcome here. 

Both drinks were phenomenal. The mango green tea was floral and flavorful, and my Okinawa milk tea was yummy and balanced. Boba was soft and fresh. The crepe was stuffed full of fruit and was good as well. 

They have stamp cards here- free drink after 10 beverage purchases...it's not going to take me long to fill that. Will definitely be back to try more things...like maybe tomorrow...heh.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,2,4,5,MywD0KIIgX5WXLJeuTFsSQ

Drinks: their specialty is Fresh Brewed Tea. However, they also have smoothies and coffee too. Their smoothies are not from fresh fruit so do 't expect healthy fruit drinks.

The little bit of taro deliciousness they put in the drink just puts it over the top! True taro taste, great soft and chewy boba... like I said, I need to take one of these drinks back to the Northeast and show them what real boba is like.  

My sister asked the guy at the counter for a recommendation and he advised her to get the Okinawa, which wasn't anywhere on the menu. She ended up getting the Hokaida milk tea for our brother and testing out the Okinawa with salted cream. Of course I had to sneak sips... the Hokaida was mellow, but we both fell in love with the Okinawa. It tasted a lot like taho, you know, that Filipino hot silken tofu dessert doused with brown sugar or honey syrup hawked by street vendors back in the homeland.  This was the drink I had to have on my second visit the next day.

This place gets 5 stars for its awesome drinks. It's those little details--the scoop of taro, that indulgent sea salt cream-- that really makes this place stand out among other tea places. I think they need a bit more room inside as it seems to get quite crowded, but really it doesn't detract from the drinks as most people grab and go anyway. Also, great work with going techy with the iPad system. I thought it was genius they did away with the paper punch cards and went digital.

The reality is, BTB is really the complete opposite of really bad and I'm probably going back sometime this week, maybe even tomorrow.

Almost everything I've had here has been very very good. I've had the taro slush with fresh taro a number of times. I've had the okinawa milk tea with boba, high mountain oolong latte, and a few of the other slush or milk teas. They have a good variety to select from. They're tasty and refreshing especially in this 100+ temps Vegas is giving us. Just ask for recommendations or just point at the picture that looks good. They also make crepes if you're not feeling a drink though I've never had them here yet. Get a rewards card for your frequent visits.

They're easily one of my favorite spots if not my favorite. Pretty much you have to go if you haven't gone. The location is small with only a few tables and its almost always packed.

I originally gave them 4 stars thinking they were just another decently good boba place. I thought they were just another place to grab a drink and go. I thought they were just small competition for my previous go-to-spot for boba.. I thought wrong..

After a bit more exploring their wide variety of drinks on their menu, and a few long and exhausting study sessions there (thanks UNLV).. I discovered there was more than what I knew about boba. There existed things like real taro slushes that don't taste overly artificial, or Okinawa tea that doesn't jip you flat on the jasmine green tea flavor. 

Brew tea bar also offers the ""love your drink or we will remake for free"" deal (not that I ever had to have a drink remade). Staff is also 24/7 friendly and welcoming. Their crepes are fresh and about half price of competitors, and their clean interior and free wifi makes it an ideal place to study (not like other boba cafes that play a strange playlist of Korean pop mixed with mainstream radio hits on max volume and reek of second hand smoke, yuck!).

My go to order is Okinawa tea, with sea salt cream, and boba. Their ""normal"" sweetness level is perfect when paired with the sea salt cream. The tea stands out, but then you get this creamy saltiness that's such a unique flavor. The boba is the perfect texture and flavor. 

I've had a sip of the Hokkaido and it taste like the White Rabbit Japanese candy in liquid form. It was a little too cloyingly sweet for me, but I could imagine it being good if it were toned down a bit.

I've also had the cold brew with sea salt cream and must agree with many other reviews, that it is indeed delicious. If I were able to come earlier in the morning, I would definitely order it more frequently. 

While I appreciate the optional scoop of real taro on top of the taro slush, it's not something I would order again because the drink started tasting watered down about halfway through. Not going to knock the place for it though, since tea really is the main focus.

Sea Salt Cream!...Honey Boba!...Cold Brew Coffee (if you arrive early enough to try some)!...Milk Teas & Tea Lattes made with excellent quality teas!...Fresh, real ingredients (like real Taro!)...Egg Custard Pudding to add to your beverage... Brew Tea Bar goes above and beyond most spots in town. The reasons are plentiful to believe the hype. You can knock their seating or their line, but simply put, Brew Tea Bar is the best in town for Tea Lattes, Milk Teas, and boba in general.

It's a menu worth exploring. I would confidently order from any section and anticipate enjoying a good drink, but if you're looking for a place to start check out one of the following:

Oolong Latte w/ Sea Salt Cream (I prefer the smokier variety of oolong)
Hokkaido Milk Tea (Shout out to my Buddy Ethan for turning me on to this one!)
Trio Slush if you're in the mood for dessert 
Taro Milk Tea made with ample pieces of fresh taro
Silver Needle w/ Lychee if you prefer an elegant and subtle tease of light, delicate flavors on your tongue 

Their customer service is excellent throughout the ordering process and after as well. Like other good establishments, Brew Tea Bar is willing to re-make it for you to get it exactly how you like it (less ice, less sweet for me.)

They are easily the best in town for Milk Teas and Tea Lattes. If you're all about the fresh fruit smoothie/slush you may still want to make a trip to #1 Boba or QQ. I usually don't understand the eruption of 5 star reviews that seems to accompany so many places the last couple of years, but at Brew Tea Bar it is entirely earned.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,19,18,5,azYNffI0fK0jDDqIM2oPVg

As expected, the parlor was quite crowded with plenty of patrons sitting at the tables and hanging out with friends. Their selection of teas is cutely written on chalkboard menus, divided into fruit teas, lattes, milk teas, and smoothies. Behind the counter, there was an army of people making drinks, working in an efficient assembly line that had orders being completed at a rapid fire rate.

I really wanted to purchase every single flavor there, but deciding to rein in my over-excited sweet tooth, I chose the ""Brew Bar"" milk tea with egg pudding in the large size at normal sweetness with light ice. I took that first sip and instantly understood why Brew Tea Bar is so popular.

SO FREAKIN' GOOD! The tea was nicely roasted with a slight bitter undertone that was quickly blanketed by the sweetness of the creamy milk. The one thing that really impressed me though was the egg pudding. It had a delicious custard taste and a slight sweetness as well. Normally egg pudding just adds texture, but not the one here. It was absolutely addictive!

My latest obsession has been with rose green milk tea, so I was pretty excited to see that on the menu. Ordered that half sugar, and I was a little confused at first. The first few sips tasted like lychee to me and it threw me off like crazy. After a few more, I can taste the subtlety of the rose. My drink was a little too heavy on the milk, but that's okay. I also had a sip of my friend's almond green milk tea, and I have to say that was a lot better than my drink.

However, my boyfriend who is super picky with food enjoyed their Hokkaido milk tea a lot. He said it is very different than anything we had in the East Coast. It was too creamy and too sweet for me.

I also ordered sea salt oolong tea. I enjoy the salty foam, which is the best I have ever tried, but the tea itself wasn't strong enough for my taste and also very sweet.",PRS05ZXa4fdu9ziWNMfpdg,0,1,4,b2xVx9By9MZKAPWRB7r60w

I know teavana and Argo tea has all these crazy tea combinations,  but they pale in  comparison.  I had a got hokkaido. It had all the caffeine I could ask for, the the rich velvety creaminess of a latte, and the warm fuzzy feeling you get when you have a delicious cup of tea. The service was fast and friendly.  The space is a little small, but was very clean and well kept. My only complaint was that it was so far away from Planet Hollywood hotel, which was where we were staying at.

As soon as we walked in we were greated from outside the counter by Louis where he shook our hand and took us through the Menu. He went over every single drink and what tea brews were in it and what each thing meant. Here they informed us that they make all the stuff from fresh fruit and fruit juices (not syrups), Tea is fresh brewed with real ingredients. The BOBA- BOBA was the best boba I ever had. Super soft, not chewy and soaked in honey. 
They have the best policy: IF YOU DONT LIKE IT, THEY MAKE YOU A NEW ONE- levels are changed for sweetness and how strong the tea is. 
We ended up getting the Black tea Sea Salt Cream and the Taro Milk Tea. 
TARO MILK TEA: 5 stars- def recommend!!!!! I have to say, I usually get Taro Slushy, but the consistency of REAL taro that was so fine, gave a little texture as well as great taste, didnt even need the Icy consistency of the slush that im used to getting. 
The Black Tea Sea Salt Cream- heavy cream, salted with thick black brewed tea. Delicious. 

They also have crepes here which they make fresh with fresh fruit. 

Location is small with 5 tables and we came at 8pm at night on a Sunday, there had to be at least 15-20 people in line.

Service 3/5
We came in with our dog and the girl the counter asked us if it was a service dog, we said yes. Then she asked us if she could see some paperwork (which lawfully she is not allowed to do) and if we couldn't provide it we'd have to sit outside. She mentioned to see paperwork again, luckily the one table that was outside just freed up so we sat outside to avoid her having to keep asking. 
However, the drinks came out fast especially considering how busy they were. They also added sweetener to one of our drinks after I asked because it wasn't sweet enough. 

Drinks 3/5
We ordered a jasmine tea and their popular Hokkaido, both with boba. Took the first sip of my Hokkaido and all I can say is that it was kind of basic. Tasted like any standard boba milk tea you'd find at tea station, volcano, half & half, etc. The boba was soft and chewy which was good but tea wise it wasn't anything special. Also can't say I liked jasmine because no matter where I get it it tastes like I'm drinking lotion. But my friend who did get it was not impressed. 

Overall our experience was underwhelming. Maybe we ordered the wrong drinks? If I'm on this side of town I might ty it again, but can't say I'll go out of my way to grab boba from here when there's a great karate inspired boba place near my house that also welcomes our dog ;)",exrhmN7te3DWgay2m6fZBw,1,1,3,uhMeEJPxBTrBIOZW5rDSPw

Sou recognized me from my previous visit and said.. Oh hi! You're having coffee this late?! It's really strong. I told him I'm going shopping, soooooo I needed my second gust of wind. He said ooooookay and reminded me how to mix my drink with the sea salt creme. I mastered the mixing motion down and was proud to show him my twirl. See.. see.. 

Thinking I could handle this drink, I, fearlessly gulped half of it down before leaving the lot. It was that good. I'm not much of a heavy coffee drinker, but the bitterness out shined the sea salt creme.. ending with hints of caramel. There was a pleasant balance between the strong coffee flavor and the sweetness of the creme. 

Silly me was bold to ask for a large size! I felt my veins being fueled with caffeine as I drank away. I should've listened to Sou. I felt like I took one of those dangerous fat burner pills way back in the days. It gave me this jolt.. so extreme that my heart couldn't even keep up with its beat. My eyes were wide open. I was spasming out. 

I tried to calm my loony self by going to a bookstore, but my eyes were in a frenzy, they couldn't keep still in reading a page! After it was all absorbed and done.. I felt eminently exhausted. Holy caffeine high!!! I'll never do that again :P

Verdict: Best boba milk tea, ahh-mazing customer service and clean, simple decor keeps me coming back for more!

""So you like milk teas huh?"" Why yes, yes I do. 

""Now do you enjoy people that make you feel good--who always remember your name and greet you as you walk into their store?"" All day, every day!

""And does a well-kept store, something that's easy on the eyes and has a great layout make you want to be a frequent patron of their fine establishment?"" Mos' definitely!

If you can relate to any one, or possibly all of these questions, then you know that great minds think alike and it's no wonder that everyone loves Brew Tea Bar. 

The fun and always cheerful three amigos--Sou, Dennis and Louis--are the OG's of this popular boba spot and can be found managing and working with their awesome crew [shoutout to Jessa and Julien and the rest of BTB krew!], that they've put together since the doors first opened. 

I won't go in-depth with their menu as they've got a TON of reviews that can tell you just how amazing their drinks are, but I will say a few quick things. Their signature ""brew"" milk tea is a go-to. Okinawa milk tea is sweetened with brown sugar so try it less sweet and boom--that's money. Taro milk tea and taro slush are always on point. And my new favorite; try an Oolong milk tea made with almond milk, less sweet and bam--hallelujah!

To all other boba spots that are popping up around Vegas:
Brew Tea Bar is the pinnacle of what you should strive for. 
You don't need a massive menu; it tells me you don't know how to make one thing great. 
You do need ""other"" milk options; some people have allergies and some just don't like milk.
Smile and greet your customers; basic customer service 101, but I feel like most other places failed that class.

Until next time: Stay BrewTeafull Las Vegas!

Thier topping add-ons are typical, but the one you should try is definitely their Sea Salt Cream!!! I just love how it enhances the texture and flavor of my drink. 

HOKKAIDO - Wonderful with sea salt cream! This is my husband's #1 drink here. The crystal boba and grass jelly are both really good with this drink. It's super creamy and milky smooth,  but it also kinda reminds me of drinking heavy whipping cream. The fat kid in me loves it though! Rated: 5/5

OKINAWA- Also wonderful with sea salt cream, crystal boba and grass jelly! This is my favorite drink to order. It has a great balance of tea flavor and a milky, creamy body. It's not watery at all which I really appreciate. Rated: 5/5

SEA SALT CREAM COFFEE- It's just so good. Rich coffee flavor with a fun salty & creamy twist. This drink is a life saver when I need an extra pep in my step. Rated: 4/5

JASMINE TEA- First impressions I thought the jasmine tea & the sea salt flavor in the cream was on the light side. A tad stronger flavoring on both would be ideal. Rated: 3/5

2706881,2017-06-03,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"UDATED REVIEW: Great place for drinks! Probably the best of Vegas. Came here for drinks and dessert after lunch with family. I ordered their HokiOki, which is half Hokkaido and half Okinawa milk tea mixed together, less sweetened. BEST MILK TEA ORDER EVER. The sweet Hokkaido milk tea balances the more bitter Okinawa milk tea, creating a unique flavor. I have never had anything like it, and will try to order something like it here in California to see if it's just as good. 

GOODS:
-great atmosphere: place is nicely decorated and gives off good vibes; great place for small groups/catch ups; they recently renovated the place and it looks great!
-quality: their drinks and desserts are GREAT quality; the drinks aren't watered down, and are well made; you can choose your level of sweetness, so you can have your drink the way you like it; they also give light ice as a default
-friendly staff: ready to answer your questions, and are all so happy to serve you 
-FREE WIFI! :D 


NOT-SO-GOODS:
-limited space: it can get packed, especially during the weekends/hot days, so finding seats might be a challenge; place is also a little small for how popular it is

I highly recommend this place for locals and/or for those who are visiting the area. I live in Southern California, where food and boba drinks are made pretty well.

I ordered the Taro Slush with boba and lychee jelly. It was amazing! The slush even came with fresh taro on the top. The cashier asked me how sweet I wanted it, which I think is a nice consideration. I also decided on a crepe with my favorite type of ice cream in it: green tea. It was delicious!

I got their regular size Cold brew with Sea Salt cream and Boba...and my friend got the Hokkaido with Sea Salt cream.

GET THE LARGE! (We would've went back in line to get another one, but the line was long).

SEA SALT CREAM? Who thought of this brilliant idea? 

They also had crepes (which looked delicious) and other fruity drinks. Other toppings, other than boba, for your drink as well.

The boba is perfect: not too chewy or hard, slightly sweet but not overwhelming. My favorite milk teas are the Hokkaido and the Caramel. The Hokkaido isn't too sweet and has a creamy flavor. The Caramel is more on the sugary side but the flavor is rich. 

The iced teas are always refreshing, but sometimes a little too fruity and similar tasting to each other. The flavorings tend to dull out the tea taste. For their coffee, it's pretty strong so caffeine lovers rejoice! It's good with the sea salt cream.

If the drink is too sweet, they'll change it for you and vice versa. It saddens me that no one mentions that in their review. ""Their drinks are too sweet in my opinion"", well, did you even ask for it to be changed? Most likely not if you're leaving a 3/4 star review.

I was introduced to BYB by my love and instantly became a huge fan. I only order Taro Milk Tea with boba, an extra scoop of fresh taro, and less sweet. You want to mix it well with the thick straw since the real Taro sinks to the bottom. I love boba in my drinks, and BTB's boba is simply the best around--always fresh and fun to chew. Brew Tea is perfect as a dessert, or it can even be used to kill your hunger.

As Phillip T reviewed, this place runs like a boy bands well harmonized song...it doesn't matter how long the line might be, the staff are composed and ready to welcome you with their gleaming white toothed smiles. I have never had any unsatisfactory boba, but in case you do, they will remake your drink until you are satisfied...isn't that wonderful and doesn't it give you a little peace of mind?

They offer a stamp card to appreciate loyal customers like myself...after 10 stamps, you will get one free. 

So do you love milk tea? Then come get yours at Brew Tea Bar...and I'll see you there!

We ordered the regular size (I think it was 16oz and I believe the large was 20oz) cold-brew coffee with sea-salt foam and a Hokkaido milk tea. The cold-brew was just sweet enough and had a unique flavor I have not seen at any other coffee place. I wish it was easier to find on the menu, though. We had to ask about it by name. We included the sea-salt foam on top of the Hokkaido milk tea as well. The flavor was amazing and it had a perfectly creamy texture; however, we'd probably order it a little less sweet next time. 

Half-way through our drinks we knew we had to order a Berry Lover crepe with green tea ice cream. If you've had an Asian-style dessert crepe at any other place (like Crepe Shack) they are very similar. A perfect amount of nutella complimented the ice cream and tart berries. 

They also have wi-fi, but only a few tables so I don't think it would be the perfect place to study in the evenings.

I was dragged here by a gf who loves Brew Tea and after my 3rd visit, I didn't want to come back. I never really found a milk tea drink that I liked from here despite adjusting the sweetness down. I told Sou I didn't like their milk tea, Hokkaido milk tea and brew tea so he suggested jasmine milk tea, less sweet. I told him I would think about it and he went ahead and made me a sample! I was immediately hooked. 

The jasmine milk tea is STRONG. It has a very strong tea taste to it, which I love. It was aromatic and perfect in terms of sweetness. Thanks Sou, I can't wait to be back!

Their Hokkaido milk tea is on the sweet side, so if you don't like super sweet I would recommend adjusting it down to a level 3 or even a 2.

We have been experiencing that normal crazy heat here in Las Vegas and I thought what better way to cool down with some tasty Boba Slush! Obviously I wasn't the only one with this great idea to stop by on a hot day as they were pretty busy! Space and seating is limited so you may or may not get a table lol.I have always loved these types of places because of the uniqueness in the flavors of the drinks. The southwest side of town is getting a bit spoiled with all these fantastic small businesses opening up! 

One thing that always stands out to me when a new business opens in the neighborhood is the vibe of the whole business. When I walked inside I was greeted by multiple employees and even offered water because of it being so hot.  Since I this was my first time I let the cashier know and asked for some of the local favorites! Ahhh this is when I agreed on the ""Sunset On The Beach"" which is a mix of Strawberry, Passion Fruit and Peach! Delicious would be an understatement I'd say! Super refreshing and not too sweet! They have obviously mastered the whole Boba Slush thing. That can be a common problem with other places is that they either make these Slushies too sweet or not sweet enough!

3167893,2015-09-03,3,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"If it wasn't clear already, BTB is definitely the place to be! I'm not sure if there's any numbers to back it up, but they've got to be one of the fastest reviewed placed in Vegas this year. Only 2 months in to being open, they've gotten well over 100 reviews, and nearly every one is positive. Rightfully so though. My check-ins will show I've probably been here way too much, and we've already started working on our 4th stamp card. I imagine that's nothing compared to some people though, as this place is almost always packed!

Aside from having an excellent product, BTB has some of the best service you can find in this city, by far. Sou, Louis and Dennis are not only extremely passionate about their product, but are dedicated to providing outstanding customer service. It didn't take but a couple times of us coming in here before they knew all of our names, and remembered both mine and Deegan's drink. I know for a fact they are seeing a bunch of people everyday, so little things like that are what people are going to remember. They may not be from Vegas, but they are making this a locals spot like no other. 

As I mentioned, we've been here a lot and been able to try a good amount from the menu. There are a few things though that I really can't stay away from. The cold brew is absolutely delicious, and BTB is definitely not afraid to make it strong. I've gotten it on it's own to take home, and while it's not the best by itself, the addition of sea salt creme makes it incredibly addicting. Thankfully I don't have near the sensitivity to caffeine as most do and can down a large one of these, with less ice of course, no problem. I like the bold coffee flavor that has virtually no bitterness from being cold brewed, and the addition of sea salt and honey boba makes for what I think is one of the most perfectly balanced boba drinks in town. 

That's not to say there other drinks aren't equally as good though. Deegan's favorite drink is the Hokkaido Milk Tea, which is extremely creamy with a caramel/toffee flavor. Their Okinawa Milk Tea and Coffee Milk Tea are two of my other favorites, and I'm even more of a fan of their other Lattes, specifically the Black Tea and Oolong Tea varieties. 

So far, there hasn't been anything I've tried that I didn't like. And if that just so happens to be the case with your drink, it won't matter much as the guys at BTB will remake it for you anyway. They proudly stand behind their product 100% and if you don't like what you got, they will either adjust it, or get you a new drink without blinking an eye. 

If you're not a fan boba or tea fan, BTB also has fresh made to order crepes. You can watch your crepe being made right after you order it, and while we've only tried one, the ""PB"", it was delicious and recommended. It's packed full of peanut butter, banana and strawberry. The crepe is light, sweet and is even better with an iced cold tea alongside it. You can also customize your crepe like you can the drinks, and make it just how you like.

Whatever you come here for, you're likely to leave satisfied. And if you haven't been here yet, you are definitely missing out!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,9,6,5,2SPJtqin8xA8fgyu4ZMP-w

For the first time ever, I'm envious of boba in Nevada. Never thought I'd see the day. Trying out Brew Tea Bar was a really refreshing experience and I'd like to try more of it in the future! I'm definitely going to come back, maybe even more than one time on my trip here.

I ordered the Smokey Oolong Milk Tea (?). I don't know the exact name because it wasn't on the menu.

OOLONG MILK TEA (5/5)
- 50% sweetness, less ice
- A very interesting dark, roasted flavor
- Didn't really like the boba, too squishy
- A great oolong tea

The staff was very helpful as well. The cashier, Angelica, was really nice and helped explain different menu options! When I asked about the oolong teas, she laid out all of the options for me and helped me choose a drink based on what I normally like. Really appreciate that!

   I have been to this location on several occasions at different times of the day.  What I have noticed that sets therm apart from their competitors is they always seem to have 3 people behind the counter.  Regardless of how long the line is to order things move fast and in a orderly fashion.  The other Boba place near me is a one person show.  Since coming here I haven't went back to the other place.  
   Quality is another big difference.  The ingredients and the amazing flavors of their drinks is also a big difference.  The Taro slushy is very tasty but add in the scoop of taro they add and it is in a class all by itself.  I had the Matcha slushy the other day and it was perfection.  They have a sign that says ""If you don't like your drink we will make you another one"".  It is impressive they take such pride in what they serve.
  The staff is always friendly and smiling.  You can tell they love what they are doing.  They definitely know how important customer service is and they do a fantastic job!   Additonally, they have a loyalty program that after 10 drinks you get one free.  Their prices are very reasonable and comparable to their competitors.

**2016 Yelp 100 LV Challenge #5**

I understand that i have already written a review for this place... but it is a new year & the fact that they have kept their reputation on keeping everything up to par is like a BONUS in my point of view. Definitely will have to compare maybe in about 10 years again, but when a business can keep consistency for a year is a plus in my eyes.

I had to finally try a CREPE here.... & they have made it apparent that i no longer have to DRIVE all the way to CALI to get what i want anymore, at least when it comes to Boba Tea & crepes that is....

CLASSIC CREPE W/ ICE CREAM $5.95 - as i eat this GINORMOUS crepe while writing this review... it is just mind blowing to me that i have finally found a place that makes it the way i like it. Of course the original way of the crepe is the way they make it (soft shell) but i asked them to make it CRISPY so that i could have that nice toasty flavor along w/ a little CRUNCH at the beginning. Each bite has a little bit of EVERYTHING... literally even if you were to roll out the crepe.... you still get a piece of every ingredient! I'M OBSESSED!! O__O

JASMINE MILK TEA $4.50 - They make it just the way i remember when i had my first BOBA TEA drink from 15 years ago when places used to use actual tea leaves to make drinks instead of powder!",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,11,8,5,RkRTsPYx3AMeEdhzwPqx2Q

My favorite is the Brew Milk Tea and my husband gets the Assam Tea.  Both with boba.  The boba is always just right!  Now too soft and it too hard.  

I have also gotten the crepes quite a few times, did I mention I come here a lot?  And the crepes are delicious too!

Best Customer Service!

What I've tried: 
I'm a creature of habit so I rotate between the Taro, Okinawa and Strawberry Milk Tea.
My friends, who are also regulars, get drinks with Sea Salt Cream or Taro topped off their drink and they almost always comment on how the toppings always compliment the drink. So try to get those toppers as an added bonus if the drink suits it!

Some things to keep in mind:
**The texture of the boba is usually soft and very chewy.
**You can customize the drinks to your preference (Sweetness Level, Amount of Boba, etc). If you don't like what they served you, you can Always ask them to readjust it.
**The place has very limited seating
**They have Digital Stamp Cards: 10 drinks = 1 Free Drink (You still have to pay for the toppings), you will need to give them a phone number to log your stamps in their system.
**You can customize the drinks to your preference (Sweetness Level, Amount of Boba, etc). If you don't like what they served you, you can Always ask them to redo it.

3245523,2018-01-04,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"I'm from the LA/626 area, so to be honest boba places don't impress me often. Brew Tea Bar was a great find, and lived up to the expectations I had from their reviews. In terms of LA area boba, I would say Brew is comparable to a cross between Ten Rens (they also use real tea leaves) and 7 Leaves (the consistency of their drinks reminds me of 7 leaves). 

I had the Lavender milk tea with boba, and it was exactly what I expected. Their boba is also well made and nicely chewy. While most places let you adjust sugar levels and ice amounts, Brew Tea Bar also let me choose what kind of sweetener I wanted (fructose or honey). I ultimately went with honey, and the 75% sweetness was perfect. If you like lavender honey ice cream, I would recommend this drink. The rest of my family had Thai tea, Hokkaido milk tea, a hot High Mountain Oolong latte, and a hot Jasmine tea. The Thai tea was a bit sweet, so I'd suggest adjusting the sugar levels on that one. I'm personally not a fan of Hokkaido milk tea, but my sister really liked it. My mom and my grandma do not like sweets, so the 50% sugar was good for both of them. 

While their drinks were good, what really impressed me was the service. They have a 100% guarantee, so they will make you a new drink if yours isn't to your liking. At first, they forgot boba in my mom's drink, but they added it as soon as we asked. The lady that helped us was very nice, and gave my grandma extra boba at no additional charge. I also appreciated their efficiency as they started making the drinks while we were ordering. Overall, I would definitely stop by again the next time I'm in Vegas.",AO_MBxn9mF1AonAMPA1SxA,1,0,5,KTJZScSw-Rnn3sgjOqYepw

We had to come back after being mesmerized by them the first time.

Today I came with my senior staff all the way from Vancouver, BC. Brew is a destination place, and I definitely plan on coming back again during this trip. 

Today between the five in our party, we ordered:
-Coconut/taro mixed slush with sea salt cream, which I changed to taro milk tea, which I didn't like, so they remade me a jasmine tea with half sugar, aloe, and sea salt cream (it was AMAZING)
-Hokkaido milk tea x2
-Okinawa milk tea
-Coconut milk tea 
-Ginger tea with boba (this was my second drink, which I took to go)

Everything was made fresh and completely customizable (if you have read any of my other reviews, you know that this is important to me!) and the service is top-notch (and this!). We went around 2pm on a Friday and it wasn't too crowded at all.

I believe the total was around $23 for the first five drinks (a steal, if you ask me), then another $5+ for the last one. Tipped $9+ since the service was so on point and one of my drinks was re-made from scratch. 

Then, one person in our party discovered he had left his wallet at the shop. After we went back, we learned that a table of teenagers had found it and turned it into the Brew Tea staff, who were holding on to it. Everything still inside, including all the cash. Very impressed. More tips for this awesome, honest service. Of course we also gave $20 to the teenagers who turned it in. As someone whose lost his wallet more times than I care to admit, I was very appreciative of how this was handled, as it could have easily ruined the trip for my staff member and our whole team. Props for honest bubble tea drinkers. 

One of the best bubble tea places period. And I've been to a lot, in the Bay Area, Vancouver, Taiwan, and China. 5 stars!",55-ljACsplhRb6Rkaxk62w,5,4,5,K97EVSq-rzwq-9oV6GV6yg

Ambience: A 

Clean, minimalist, hipster. All words that come to mind when you step inside. Parking is a breeze, and far enough away from the strip to avoid the drunks and crazies. Nothing more I would ask for. 

Service: A

What other boba place will remake your drink entirely if you don't like it?? Also, the guy who helped us was able to briefly, concisely and articulately explain the differences between each drink. There's nothing worse than having to listen to some long drawn out explanation of how great the food/drinks are like some of the other places I've been to...

I've had plenty of boba in my lifetime. Quickly's, Tapioca Express, Ten Ren's..the list goes on, but there hasn't been a place that has really ever wow'ed my pants off besides Brew. Girlfriend ordered Jasmine Milk Tea with boba and you can actually smell the jasmine fragrance from the tea in each sip. On top of that, the boba was the perfect QQ consistency as well as perfect sweetness. If this were Harry Potter, Brew Tea Bar would definitely be Gryffindors.

The menu is relatively small in comparison to menus you find in the LA area. The drinks though are great. I got the lychee peachy green tea with boba. It had the tea flavor I love with hints of the lychee and peach. If you don't like your drink, just tell the drink maker and they can adjust it for you.

Problem I typically have is that either the drinks too sweet or the boba is too sweet and hard. This place is great.

The very first time I came here, they told me to make sure my drink was 100% to my satisfaction. It was a bit on the sweet side for me but they happily fixed it for me. I'd have to say the boba was too hard the first time, but after the next few times I've gone their boba just gets better and better.

My personal favorite is the Okinawan Milk Tea. It has like a brown-sugar taste to it and has more flavor (to me) than my second favorite there, which is the Hokkaido Milk Tea that has a more caramel taste. Can't forget the tapioca...their tapioca is alway the right amount of soft and chewy and makes the drink even more enjoyable.

If you go earlier in the day it's usually not too crowded, but usually from like 3pm-until closing, I've never seen it not slow. Despite how busy they get, they still manage to get the drinks made very quickly and I never have to wait more than like 2 minutes. If you're ever in Las Vegas/South Las Vegas and want your boba fix, this is definitely a place to try!

I'm so glad I did. First off, I'd like to commend the staff for being so incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about all the drinks on the menu. Because it was my first time there, I was recommended the Hokkaido milk tea since I prefer something creamy over tea-tasting. I added the boba and the drink altogether was just the right amount of sweet and creamy. Really like the honey taste to the boba!

I also ordered the cold brew with the sea salt cream, an off-menu choice that was recommended when I asked about the cream itself (it sounded pretty good--I'm really into combining salty and sweet). Another great choice! Iced coffee is my go-to when I want to wake up a little, and I really like that hint of saltiness in the cream. I recommend this to anyone who's up for mixing up their regular iced coffee preferences.

Lastly, I got the caramela crepe with whipped cream since I was getting hungry. It looked pretty and tasted great, too. :)

I should definitely start saving some gas money to make more trips here. Now I totally understand why people keep coming back and why everyone keeps telling me to go. Cheers!",SpS3R3ws2qcGcyy4GUIRcw,0,0,5,EB99mir0d4zIECpHTRKhIQ

They call out your tea by your name (from getting it on your CC, not sure if they ask for your name if paying cash). I sipped it to check sweetness and it was fine so I walked out.

I can see why it's hitting all those red stars on yelp. They have a huge range of flavors from tea to slush to choose from.

I Order three drinks, served real quick considering there were probably 20 people cramped into one little tea shop. As soon as you walk in you can feel the atmosphere light up with friendly ongoing people having a good time with their friends and sipping on some bomb tea. There are a few tables and seats where you can chill and a small bench for you to wait for your drinks. 

I had the chance to try the mango slush, it's 30 degrees outside in Vegas right now. Delicious and the bubbles was delightful. Awesome would be the best description for the mango slush. No one can say it was awful, because I think it's near perfect. 

Secondly I order a crepe, very inexpensive. 3.50$ base plus ice cream 1.00$ and .50$ per topping. Nothing can really go wrong when your crepe is under $7 bucks. Praise the brew tea god for making a huge delicious crepe for so cheap. Topping that pairs with my mango slush, 10/10 a good time. 

I highly recommend anyone who hasn't tried brew tea to try this spot! First order your perfect crepe with extra Nutella and then try the slush or tea. Either is both great. You can not go wrong, trust me it's very delicious.",Vd24R1OnKzw8WjHLrrDTtw,1,1,4,uYe47l-1XSSV7kCAVfU_Kw

The menu is pretty standard - iced teas, latte teas (aka sea salt creme), milk teas, slushes, fresh brew teas, herbal teas, and sweet crepes.

Jasmine Latte (regular, $3.75 + $0.50 for Honey Boba): OMG this was like freaking top notch SGV quality drink. In fact, this sea salt drink put other SGV boba places (Nest Tea House, etc) that serve similar drinks to shame. Simply a refreshing drink (not overly sweet) and pearls had right sweetness and chewiness. I am not joking around - it was hands down one of the best sea salt drinks I've ever tried. I guess the only problem was too much foam, so it was really hard to suck all the remains pearls.

Taro Slush (regular, $3.95): Before I left Vegas, I actually came back to Brew Tea Bar for a second round. When you order this drink, cashier will ask whether to leave real taro on top of your drink and you almost have to say yes (unless you don't like real taro). I never had a taro drink like this ... powdered taro slush combined with a small chunk of real mashed taro. It was the best of two worlds - you can taste both powdered taro (aka fake taro) and real taro all at the same time! Personally it was the best powdered taro slush ever, period.

Dude I think i will start to make a detour to Brew Tea Bar whenever I am in Vegas. Learn to appreciate this place because you will not find many high quality boba shop like this - not even in Los Angeles & SGV (I can only think less than 3~5 out of 50+ boba shops in LA that are just as good as Brew Tea Bar).",rQLEfpfSjVK-3dBmIMKZDA,2,3,5,7qR8Nq9mFsnIxU4HFP05cw
3524661,2015-11-21,9,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"This is my go-to boba spot despite the fact that it is about a minute drive for me lol. I go here pretty often and some of the workers know me now which is pretty cool since they take the time to remember frequent customers and their service is one of the best I have seen. 

My first few experiences with this place wasn't good because of things like diluted milk teas, running out of boba, etc. but I kept coming back since my friends had positive experiences. I finally found my favorite drink which I highly recommend trying. The Okinawa milk tea with the honey boba is one of the best drinks I've had and they just pair so well with each other. It tastes sweet (but not too sugary) with the right amount of milkiness and tea flavor. If you prefer a more creamier and sweeter drink, then go for the Hokkaido milk tea which is also pretty good. Another drink I recommend trying if you are a matcha lover is the matcha milk tea which is pretty good. 

I ordered the sunset smoothie which tasted alright, but what threw me off was how the fruits were all blended together to make this light orange (cantaloupe looking) color. I am used to seeing bits of fruits in my fruit based drinks or at least different streaks of colors. This wasn't a big deal, but the drink was pretty sweet so I won't be getting that again. For their taro milk tea, just be prepared for a grittiness since they do use real taro! I didn't know that when I first got it and was really surprised lol. I have been used to the powder stuff so the texture was unappealing to me, but if you do love REAL taro, be sure to check it out! I also ordered the honey milk tea which I didn't like because it was diluted, but I may order it again in the future just to see if it does taste good. The rose milk tea is pretty good, but be warned since it is strong in the sense that it is really floral (think perfume or something along those lines). 

I generally don't like to request a drink fixture or remake because it makes me feel bad, but the workers here are really nice and willing to make the drink until it suits your taste. Yesterday, the cashier was really proactive in asking my friend and I to taste our matcha drink before leaving because she said there were some hit and misses with the production of it. It tasted pretty diluted compared to the other times I've been there and she immediately requested it to be remade with more matcha which made it perfect. 

I know it's a long review, but I hope it helps you guys get a sense of this place. If you haven't been here yet, be sure to check it out! Feel free to message me if you want to know about other drinks I've tried from this place.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,10,10,4,FRk0jS96NCXltj7DiIx5lw

3535502,2016-01-14,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"Finally there is a boba place close to my house - and it's one of the best! 

Depending on the size of the drink and how much is added to it, the prices for a tea ranges from $4 to $7, which is pretty average, but I'd like to argue the tea people get at Brew Tea Bar is the best deal one could get for that price. The drinks here are incredibly consistent in their impeccable quality and taste. The boba always tastes like it was freshly cooked and is the perfect type of chewy, and the jelly is delightfully smooth and sweet-ish. A definite 10/10 for the drinks. (Personally, I absolutely adore the Hokkaido tea. It is just the right balance of sweetness, tea, and paradise.) 

The customer service here is superb. There are usually at least two staff members in the front of the store to answer any questions and to take any orders. All staff members are extremely knowledgeable and attentive to their customers' needs. They will patiently explain the difference between different types of teas and provide a tray for larger to-go orders. I wish the boba cups were sealed when I get them as a to-go order, so spilling wouldn't be as big of a worry when I zip through the city, but else than that, I have no complaints. 

I'm so glad I don't have to drive all the way down to Chinatown to get good boba anymore. It's a brew-tea-ful thing. Ha ha ha... But seriously. Go. You'll love it.",lYdIJrjX-QgOhQfsvTQlOg,0,0,5,eYz3x5xMpe8wpomu-KDn6Q

I don't know the gentleman name, but he was super friendly and knew we were newbies.  He gave us the menu and explained to us the items and recommended the Hibiscus something tea to my hubby since hubby didn't want anything with milk.  I was going to go with Jasmine Latte when I heard the cashier said ""Hi Debbie.""  So of course, I asked Debbie what she wanted and made that 2.

I tried Debbie's ""Large Smokey Oolong Latte with Honey, Less Sweet, No Ice,"" and it was yummy.  I didn't mix it initially so that I can try each component on its own.  The smokey oolong was good, the sea salt cream was interesting, and after mixing them all up, it was delish.

Three drinks came out to be $20, and so worth it.

As soon as I walked in, I was immediately greeted and the guy at the cashier asked if it was my first time there. I was offered an explanation of the different teas. Then a girl came over & he tells her to give me some samples. 

Upon trying the bobas, I asked what is popular and she suggested Jasmine Latte with Sea salt creme. I addded boba to it. She says they use honey instead of sugar.

It took only about 2-3 minutes for my tea. It was unique, earthy but was perfect, not too sweet and definitely not bland.

.......HANDS DOWN!

Brew Tea is the type of business that knows what it does well, and does that as well as possible. 

Who: The staff here are very friendly and efficient, and will happily remake your drink if you it was made wrong, or if you're not a fan.

What: They serve boba drinks in various ways (Tea, Coffee, Slush, and Milk Tea.)

Where: Southwest side of town off of Rainbow and Warm Springs (In the same plaza as Albertsons)

I've yet to have a drink here that I didn't enjoy. 

Some of my favorites include: Coffee Latte, Taro Slush, Hokkaido Milk Tea, Rose Milk Tea, & Strawberry Milk Tea.


Price is reasonable.

10/10.

TIP: They have various sweetness levels, so keep it in mind. I tend to favor ""half-sweet"" (50%) or less sweet (75%) over having it regular.

Also, get a stamp card! Once you go here, going here 10 times won't seem difficult at all.",wWhllrw0Y_Dl5rHEUDUdww,1,1,5,lZEyRaOc3yaUG7WFYjJTzQ

I'm sure Brew Tea Bar can attest to the truth of that statement. They built a quality product in a city overrun by syrup, powders, and low quality tea. Now their little shop in the Southwest area is JAM packed with customers after only being open for 2 months. Word spreads quick when you're good and as friendly/helpful as their crew is. 

I like the simplicity of the shop because the focus is the product. The ""Fresh Brew"" are my favorite because they're brewed in a tea infuser and bring out a lot of the aromatics! I started becoming so addicted to the fresh teas that I bought my own infuser so I wouldn't be broke ha. 

Other than the fresh brew my side chick is their cold brew coffee with the latte foam. I only wish they opened earlier so I could come by in the morning to live through another treacherous work day.

I really don't know what else there really is to say, I feel like all my fellow 5-starers covered it all. Obvi you should try the sea salt cream that everyone is raving about, but if that isn't your thing then go for their regular teas, they definitely won't disappoint. 

I think what actually keeps me coming back is the consistency of their boba. You know those nights when you're craving a late night boba treat after dinner or something, and you finally get your hands on a nice flavored milk tea or tea, and then life is basically ruined when that first chew of boba actually takes a bit of work? The worst. Yea well don't worry because the boba is consistent af here. Soft and chewy all day e'erday. 

Service is always on point. Staff is very friendly and always willing to make adjustments if needed. They also serve crepes which I've never tried but often see people indulging in. Probably the only negative comment I could leave is the lack of space for sitting. Honestly not even a big deal unless you want to order a crepe and eat it there. There's about 3 full tables that could sit 4, 1 or 2 small tables to sit 2, a bench for take-out orders, and 1 table outside. Ok, that actually sounds like a sufficient amount of seating...but this place is really popular!

The boba is fresh and comparable to Kung fu tea's boba, which is soft and sweet. The owner also told us that we could change the flavor until we were satisfied, the service was amazing.

First I got oolong latte, which was really good. The second time I went I got the caramel milk slush which was so yummy! I mixed it,which made it not too sweet for me. (The caramel milk slush at Tea Station is WAY too sweet for me, so I was excited about Brew Tea Bar making theirs more subtle). The third time I went I tried the hokkaido milk tea, which made me hooked. I've been ordering that since then.

Besides the drinks, I haven't tried the food yet. The place is always spotless clean, they have cute wooden tables and chairs, and their customer service is excellent.

* The taste of the flavors: Awesome! (Hokkaido is my fav)

* The prices: Awesome!

* Their willingness to let customers create their own drink combining different flavors: Awesome!

The only con would be that since they get so busy, you sometimes have to get your drink to-go since there may not be anymore tables & chairs. I hope they can expand =)

Other than that, taking it to-go is no prpblem!

Everything was of course, delicious. This place has the best Taro (slush and milk tea) in the Vegas valley. The brewmasters are able to adjust sweetness and the amount of boba you want in your drink. 
What really got me was the customer service. I walked in with a napping toddler in PJs and a grumpy preschooler.

My ultimate favorite drink to get is the 
- Lychee-Peachy with 0% sweetness! It's such a refreshing drink on a hot summers day. 
My next favorites would be;
- Jasmine or Oolong latte. Brewed tea topped with sea salt foam. Their sea salt is amazing! 
- Taro Slush with REAL taro is another favorite. Real taro on top?! Delicious!

3781010,2017-01-07,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"Without a doubt, Brew is the best place to get boba in Vegas.

Their signature honey boba is fresh, soft, and slightly sweet. I'd recommend it in pretty much any milk tea. My absolute favorite drink here is the iced taro milk tea, which they make with REAL taro. If you ask they'll even let you try a spoonful of the taro they make it with. (If you really like taro you can order it as your topping instead of boba too) It's fantastic! I've never cared for taro milk teas anywhere else but this one is something else. When its cold outside, I recommend a hot Brew milk tea with boba or one of their Latte Teas which have sea salt creme. I mostly order milk teas, so I'll also recommend the Okinawa (brown sugar), Matcha (green tea), or the Brew milk tea. 

The milk teas at Brew have a stronger tea flavor than their competitors and that's what I like about this place. Kung Fu (a different boba place) is comparable but their drinks are creamier and not as strong as Brew. I definitely go out of my way for Brew sometimes, but for that taro milk tea I'd say its worth it.

They have great people here. Even when the line is long, you're always greeted by friendly faces and they make the drinks quick and fresh. The atmosphere here is really vibrant and high energy, but I wish the interior was roomier. There's only three or four tables where people can sit and then a bench where you can wait for your order. Not too big of a deal because most people just get their boba and go. There's also tons of parking available, which makes boba runs here less stressful than the places in Chinatown. Don't forget to get a stamp card! You'll get a free drink every 10 drinks/stamps.",ETGRhvDSYHw-hoz2nA_ewQ,1,1,5,P_gTVOxqfboYy-pJaqPo2g

The interior is very nice, simple and spacious. I was greeted by the cashier who immediately gave me some suggestions. I went with the Jasmine Green Milk Tea. 

Got my order and told me to try it first to see if I would like any adjustments made to the sweetness level. It was pretty good! Still not Kung Fu Tea good but just good. The flavor reminded me of QQ boba's green milk tea. The boba on the other hand was nothing too special. It tasted very bland and was too chewy for my taste. I would give the drink 3.5/5 stars.

So in conclusion, the I'm glad that there is a good boba place in the South West area butttt Kung Fu Tea is still my number #1 boba love. Idk man, I think it's that awesome boba shaker they have.

You choose from Lattes, milk tea, slushes, tea, and even crepes. 

I came here with a friend to work on a computer project, so she decided Brew Tea. If you're the type to find a sport where you can sit alone or have privacy for your own personal business, this is not the place for that.(go to Starbucks or something). This place is more for group seating. 

I was recommended by the cashier to try their ""Brew Tea"" milk tea. I gotta say, it's your average milk tea.. but you can customize your drink that fits your taste buds. I like mines with light Ice, 2 scoops of sugar and almond milk as a substitute. I even had to buy their crepes because the pictures make it look so delicious and big. I went with the classic Nutella, banana and strawberry crepe with vanilla ice cream for a buck more. It sure was big!

So far, I didn't find anything unique, but when I do try out some more items, I'll be sure to review it. I recommend Brew Tea for your go too Boba/Teas",lUGiHH2La_BuHoBrR1aGlg,0,0,5,BY165WcxIRqjpRdzF2U2BQ

Although it is pretty far from me (Henderson), I was out on the west side of town and  decided to drop in for a refreshing snack. The shop itself is very quaint with several tables and chairs to socialize. Unfortunately, I don't think this is a great place to study (which is something I'm still looking for in a cafe)

I digress. There is a very extensive menu that I was overwhelmed at first, especially with a growing line behind me. The worker manning the front was very patient and helpful! He went through a couple of his personal and customer favorites and explained what their Hokkaido and Okinawan milk teas were. 

I opted for the Hokkaido milk tea with boba and also got to try my friend's Okinawan milk tea (brown sugar taste) One sip of the Hokkaido and I had flashbacks of Japan! It was quite enjoyable but a little too sweet for my tastes. I'll opt for a less sweet version next time.

It's a win when you walk in and there's not some sort of line. I started coming here for the Cold Brew coffee, literally the best when I need a pick me up. Make sure you mix the coffee (you kind of just twirl it in a circular motion since they don't have the typical sealed top) I recently have been getting the taro slush, it has real taro on top. I like to mix it in and you get taro chunks. If you don't want an overwhelmingly amount of sweet, I recommend to get it half sweetened, trust me it's still a good amount of sweet. If you're feeling like you need a little extra definitely share a classic crepe with ice cream. 

The drinks on the board isn't their only option. They have another menu that has twice the drinks. So, if nothing looks appealing to you, definitely ask for that one. 

They recently switched their reward system to one on their POS. But good news folks, if you still have your paper stamp cards, it can be transferred!

Glad I came though, milk tea was as good as friend had recommended. I tried the brew tea milk tea w egg pudding and he jasmine latte with honey boba. I was surprised that I actually liked the brew tea milk tea better Bc usually I'm a fan of jasmine milk tea. The egg pudding is not your usual egg pudding. It's smooth and you won't taste any of the powder bits that sometimes bad quality pudding comes with. Honey boba also just the right amount of sweetness and chew.

JMT -- For all my OC heads, this place doesn't compare to 7 leaves but it has some real potential. You can taste the tea, brewed just right. The boba was definitely on point, cooked with a perfectly firm shell and ooey gooey inside. Really impressed overall but thought the kind of jasmine tea they used could be better.

Hokkaido Milk Tea -- Easily the best Hokkaido Milk Tea I've had to date. A thick, creamy tea with the distinctive toffee caramel accents. It's a really heavy drink so be careful with the add-ons! 

The location is a bit off the beaten path, especially for out-of-towners, but it is undeniably worth the trek.

With all the hype on yelp and my friends raving about this place, I immediately jumped on it like a fat kid on a cake. After giving this place few more visits, my verdict is: it's not that great.

SERVICE
Service is consistently amazing here. Dennis, Sou and Louis really goes the extra mile to make sure you are happy with your drinks. It is nice to know that customer satisfaction is their number one priority. Two thumbs up for their service.

DRINK
When you are handed a drink personally, they tell you to let them know if you need any adjustments. Even though their willingness to adjust your drink is appreciated, I find that drinks are not that great when you have to keep making adjustments. Or when they offer many options and varieties of drinks but you only like one drink. 

I have tried their oolong latte, jasmine milk tea, hokkaido milk tea, cantaloupe milk tea, sunset on the beach slush and black tea latte so far. Out of all the drinks I did get to try, I only ever liked and will only order their jasmine milk tea which is sad to say. Their drinks just never really blows my mind like every other reviewers says. 

Too picky? Possibly. It's all a personal preference? True. But all the high praise and rave about this place is ridiculous to me. It's overrated. 

Let's talk about boba. Boba is inconsistent. It's on the softer side, sometimes too soft and mushy. They use longan honey for their boba which is nice, but can get too sweet. Honey from boba will dissolve in drink. Perhaps asking them to rinse the boba is a good choice.

Personally after trying +5 drinks, I can safely say this place isn't really my cup of tea.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,8,6,4,ZDqh3LdQ-w52Ms1xOt5UXQ

4034514,2018-03-16,0,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"What sets this boba shop apart from the others? Their service. Their drinks are standard.

First and foremost, I'm a boba addict. I've been to so many boba shops, in so many different states. Whenever I'm on vacation, I venture to a different boba shop every single day. Boba is life.

The drinks at Brew Tea Bar just didn't blow me away like I thought they would given their Yelp Rating. Their drinks are made the exact same way almost every other boba shop does.. with the exception of their fresh brewed teas (but who really gets that anyways ?). 

Since so many people raved about their taro smoothie, i ordered that on my first visit. I watched them make my smoothie, which was essentially just a whole lot of powder (which is standard). But for some reason, I was expecting something more since people rave about their quality ingredients. Artificial powder is a quality ingredient now? Okay then. After my smoothie was done blending, they added a scoop of fresh taro on top. The smoothie was okay, a little powdery at times, the fresh taro was more of an afterthought. It just tasted like every other boba shop's taro smoothie. The only taro smoothie that has blown me away thus far, had fresh taro blended into the actual smoothie and very little powder.

On my next visit, I decided to try another one of their more popular drinks.. their take on the sea salt jasmine green tea. This drink was better than their taro smoothie. The tea was strong and the sea salt added a nice flavor component. What sucked about this drink though, was the fact that I wasn't able to evenly distribute the sea salt cream. Since Brew Tea Bar uses the lids you can pop off/on, and not the completely sealed ones most Boba shops use.. it was hard to get it mixed. I had to just swirl my cup and my straw to get it going. This was a little frustrating.

Overall, Brew Tea Bar is good. I just don't think it's out of this world like everyone else does. Their drinks are normal and tastes similar to a lot of other places I've been to. But they definitely have the best service out of everyone.",sDjxEhVVwvVYFYv1rOFUfA,1,0,4,FFH1U8hxEZIp2M5cOquy4A

The prices are very fair! I think it's actually the perfect mix of a good price, a unique product, and pleasant service.

I recommend getting a crepe and adding ice cream or any of their milk teas. They offer honey boba and egg custard as an alternative to regular boba for a small charge. 

I am giving them a 4 instead of a five as my friend got her drink way later than mine. I truly understand that some drinks take longer than others, but a big rush got taken care of super quick before hers. Probably 12-16 drinks.

I'm usually picking up a caffeinated concoction before work, and while it's not always at BTB, i'm never really content with my drink because other places make it too sweet when i specifically asked for adjustment.  A hint of sweetness is ok, but anymore than that is irritating.  These guys knows exactly how to make my drinks, and on the first try too!  

The tea here are STRONG because they are built to order.  I am so pleased that i am never tasting just milk in my drink (or sugar.)  I haven't ventured off too far from the classic Oolong or black milk tea, but the ones i have tried were delicious: Taro, Hokkaido, and Caramel Milk Tea to name a few.  

If you're looking for something different with a little more body they have Sea Salt Cream.  Pairs nicely with their Cold Brew Coffee.  Outside of BTB i've only had Sea Salt Cream at 85¬∞C, and i find theirs repulsive because it has way too much of a bite. BTB's version is softer.

Our order of 8 drinks was done in under 10 minutes. A 15+ person line popped out of nowhere after we put our order in and they chipping away at it quickly. Great work everyone, truly impressive.

Drinky Drinks: I love the Matcha Milk Tea Slushie with Boba and it was fantastic. Great ingredients and not too sweet.  I'm still amazed on how perfect the slushie was considering how fast is was made.  The synergies are on point and it shows in the finished product.  They offer to re-make your drink if you you're not satisfied but I don't see them doing that very often.  High quality drinks and  

There's a couple of tables available to sit down and enjoy your drinks.  I'm always on the go and it's good to know that Brew Tea Bar can get me out of there quickly with a great drink.

4108244,2015-08-26,8,IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA,"After my multiple return visits, I've reached an increasingly obvious conclusion: Brew Tea Bar is the best milk tea / boba establishment in town.

I finally made my second visit last week on a weekday evening. They had an astonishing four people working at the time, which the subsequent ""dinner"" rush proved necessary. I chose the Hokkaido Milk Tea (default sugar level) with egg pudding after my friend mentioned enjoying this drink (albeit with boba too). The drink was a sweet treat with a flavor that's often described as caramel and toffee. The egg pudding was a silky custard that took on a lot of the tea's flavor. It had a great complementary texture as well, and it's one of the best egg pudding add-ons that I've had. I'll probably shy away from the Hokkaido unless I'm feeling especially dessert-y, but I see why others like it.

My third visit was after Sunday night dinner at a nearby restaurant. I finally went for the Jasmine Latte. It comes with sea salt cream, as all their latte drinks do. I didn't write about sea salt cream much in my initial review, but it was a difference maker here. It added a subtle but noticeable counterpoint to the subtle sweetness and the strong tea flavor. Jasmine milk tea is one of my favorites because the jasmine flavor is one of the ones that isn't masked as milk tea, and its presence lingered in every sip even after the ice melted. As a combination of a classic flavor in jasmine and a less common accent in sea salt cream, this marriage is my favorite drink here up to this point.

Today's visit cemented my decision to add a fifth star. I decided not to get a latte again, instead selecting ""The Brew"" milk tea with honey boba. Any namesake item should be great, and this drink really is. The overall flavor is somehow richer than a typical standard ""milk tea"" (as opposed to ""[insert any word here] milk tea"") and the sweetness is balanced as I've come to expect here. A standard milk tea at these kinds of shops is sweet, but The Brew has a relatively restrained sugar level by default.

I also now consider the honey boba here the best in town as well. Not only did they demonstrate consistency in the texture, but this also was the first time I've tasted a ""honey"" boba and actually associated the flavor with honey, perhaps due to the great drink that it accompanied. One last but important note is that they were happy to fulfill my request of adding less ice than usual, and that gave me a sense of higher value and less watering down toward the end of the drink.

With excellent teas and toppings, plus the safety net of their satisfaction guaranteed policy, Brew Tea Bar is almost certainly the best of its genre that Vegas ever has been blessed with. It's even comparable to the top places in California, so both locals and visitors alike should go out of their way if they're fans of these types of drinks. If a taxi ride is necessary, I'm sure there's other places nearby that would help justify the expense.

(UPDATE 9/5/15: Been back a few times. Earl Grey latte has a rather special flavor, one which real Earl Grey tea enthusiasts are aware of, I'm sure. I wasn't, so this seemed just a little strange to me. I prefer my Jasmine latte, as well as the Oolong latte that I tried tonight. They have a smoky oolong, which is a black tea, and a High Mountain oolong, which is a green tea. I ordered the latter and enjoyed the lighter taste, although I still prefer the Jasmine.

I also tried a passion fruit green tea recently, which came too sweet and forced me to use their awesome customer satisfaction policy to lighten the sweetness while strengthening the tea flavor. The result was good, but not as good as their lattes. And speaking of that policy, somehow an Okinawa milk tea w/ boba was added to my order tonight. They refunded it entirely, no problems, multiple apologies. I'm not sure how that happened, but I was glad not to be stuck with the calories.)",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,7,5,rjgLeUQ3J0y_M44vJuilRg

If there's one negative thing I can say about this place is that it's always freaking packed. Luckily we've arrived before the next wave of humans but damn, the lines mean parking is kaka and the last time we went here, there was construction happening in the lot which lessened the number of spaces already but if there're always people, it's always busy, there's a reason why.

The shop is small, but there a few tables you can sit at.

My friend got a coffee boba drink which turned out to be a little too bitter for her. The staff overheard her and quickly fixed her drink to make it sweeter. 
The milk tea I got was the best milk tea I've had. I also ordered the famous Hokkaido milk tea. The milk tea is very heavy on the milk flavor and has a light tea taste. It tasted like milk mixed with condensed milk. It was good, but I prefer the plain milk tea. 
But the best part of Brew Tea Bar is the BOBA. The boba is slightly sweet and has the gooey-est consistency I've ever had in boba.

Located not too far off the 215 from S. Rainbow, you can find this establishment in the Albertson parking lot on the left by the haircut place. 

Setting: Keep it open and free of cluttered, a lot of businesses particularly Asian ones forget this. Often attempting to endorse as many products as they can, Brew Tea Bar keeps it simple which is a golden guideline for me. Basic menu categorized as Slush (Reg: 3.95, Lrg: 4.95), Latte Tea (Reg: 3.75, Lrg: 4.75), Ice Tea (Reg: 2.85, Lrg: 3.85), Milk Tea (Reg: 3.5, Lrg: 4.5, Fresh Brew (Lrg only $4.95), and crepes (4.95). I wouldn't recommend this place to study or get work done due to the limited space and how busy it can get here. 

Service: Very accommodating and willing to make any adjustments to drinks. Talk about taking an initiative to keep the customer happy. 

Drink: I opted to mix the hokkaido and okinawa milk tea which was a great idea (thanks to the yelper who left the tip). Server had told me that it was sweet and adjusted the sweetness for me. 

Overall: I'm looking forward to new locations, keep up the concern for customer satisfaction and Brew Tea Bar will become prevalent on every street corner. Nice work guys!",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,7,3,5,hDe_DSoJypFd_tT1iCHIgw

SEA SALT CREAM! Where have you been all of my life?! Who knew that could make an ordinary tea turn into something I dream about at night. I am forever changed and will never be able to have a tea latte without it!  

So far I have tried the ""Brew Tea"" Latte with Sea Salt Cream and the Okinawa with Sea Salt. Must say the Okinawa was a tad too sweet for my personal tastebuds but I am thoroughly addicted to the Brew Tea Latte w/ Sea Salt Cream. My fianc√© loves their Jasmine Milk Tea, he constantly compares every Jasmine Milk Tea he drinks to his favorite one at Chatime in NYC and Brew Tea Bar gets his seal of approval. 

If you are looking for fresh fruit boba drinks they really don't have much in the way of fresh fruit at all. I get it... they specialize in tea! I only mention this because I have a 7 year old who loves Real Strawberry Slush w/ Boba and while we love getting our tea there they don't have fresh strawberry for her. It's made with a syrup. This is essentially not a big deal for us because we still go but something to note if someone in your group happens to like real fruit boba drinks.

Oolong Latte: a mix of smoky, bitter, and sweet that has you begging for another sip. I was very intrigued by the flavors. You also get to watch your tea steep for a couple minutes to get the strong flavors. It takes about 5-10 minutes for this one, but a little extra love goes a long way. 

- Milk Tea 
So many many to choose from! All look familiar except Hokkaido and Okinawa. If you're looking for something creamy, go Hokkaido. Want a bolder tea taste? Get Okinawa. My personal favorite is the Okinawa by the way. 

The service is impeccable too. You can ask for your drink with any amount of sweetness and ice before AND AFTER getting your drink . So far, everything's been spot on for me, no adjustments necessary! But it's nice to know they'd go out of their way to make the perfect drink for you.

The drink I had was exactly what I like, it was amazing.  It was a real treat.  Luckily Lindsay C. asked so many questions and tried so hard to figure out what I would like.  The Oolong Latte with the smoky roasted Oolong (they have two types of Oolong) was delicious.  The boba was cooked perfectly and was soft and chewy and sweet.

They use fresh Taro to make their Taro drinks and I got a few tastes of that.  It was pretty good, but taro isn't really my thing.  For people that like Taro, I recommend you try one of their taro drinks.

They have a few tables where you can have your drink and your crepe if you order one.  They also have a bathroom and drinking water.

The dude that helped us really went out of his way to make sure we liked our drinks and that he could make something else if we didn't.  They all had names on the back of their shirt, but I forgot what his name was.  We talked to at least 3 different staff members throughout the visit and they were all helpful and nice.

Anyone that rates this below 4 stars is trippin.  The product is great and so is the staff, if you had a below 4 star experience, you should go back and give them another try.",GVXIGDbs9RGJWfKNbAmruA,0,0,5,hEAMnqRpgLzEH3wDLtz2Rw

My coworker and friends I bring here LOVE their drinks and prefer it over all the other tea places in Vegas (ie: No1 Boba, QQ Boba, Tea Station, Kung Fu Tea, Icy Juicy, Jackie Bee).

I always get The Brew Milk Tea w/ boba. Their boba is super fresh and slightly honey-tasting. This is my favorite drink there. I also order the Jasmine Green Tea here. Their teas are never overly sweet, and you can always make sweetness adjustments if you like. After your drink is made, the workers want you to be 100% happy with the drink! 

The Osmanthus was super refreshing as welI! I told him Tea Station charges about $7 for the same drink, so knowing Brew Tea makes it here for about $2-3 cheaper and 5-stars tastier makes them a winner.

Since the day I first walked into Brew Tea, I knew I'd get addicted.
The aroma of worth hit me upon entrance, let's break it down:

Setting/Service:
It's a little ways away from main Vegas spots (i.e. the Strip, Chinatown, Summerlin, Henderson, etc) but it is definitely worth the drive. 
The shop itself is fairly small with minimal seating, but they have a bathroom and that is important. The staff are all super friendly, and they are exceptionally fast at making drinks, even if it's a huge order!
 
Drinks:
HOKKAIDO MILK TEA W/ SEA SALT CREAM & HONEY BOBA,
I think my friend told me it's about 1000 calories, but is it worth it? HELL YEAH.
Warm perfectly-textured boba, with the perfect amount of sweetness and flavor, that every time I get the chance to come here, I'm double(sometimes triple)-fisting out the door. 

*hint* get a stamp card and start your addiction to delicious boba!

Overall: A+
I don't think I can get boba anywhere else in Vegas, Kung Fu used to be the go-to but Brew Tea has taken the crown, so now whenever I'm in vegas, I'll be there. Thanks Brew Tea!",j_uVP3k5doZ0NALMZq_6hA,6,6,5,FELJ2bFBsTOE3PARvE6Naw

I came here to do some quick work on my laptop and to say I was pleasantly surprised would be serving this place no justice. Looking at a menu as variety heavy as they have of tea options can be as overwhelming as a foreign language could be. But then, the cashier (Catrina, I believe) asked if I needed help. Trying to be an adult, I said no. Totally disregarding my declination for help, she forced some suggestions on me anyway. And, of course, they helped. 

I ended up grabbing a ""PB crepe"" which disappointed me at first because it's topped with literally 3 slices of strawberries & 3 slices of banana only... but then I cut into it and it was STACKED with them. And peanut butter. And ice cream (worth the upcharge). I've never seen one so fat before. 

I ate it outside because this place was popping like a madhouse and the only table outside was the only one that opened up and I pounced on it. I ordered it to go when I saw there was no table, but they saw I found one and made the order for here just to be thoughtful. They have mini cups of water that I didn't see at first until I inquired, but they insisted on giving me a large water anyway. They are like the mom that you tell you want only one scoop of food and they throw two scoops on your plate. That's a mom that loves you.

Needless to say, I have high standards for good boba and Brew Tea Bar is dare I say, better? Looking at other 626 Yelpers - you're right, the place spacious enough for waiting; but is not designed for hanging out, studying, playing cards, etc. which nearly all the 626 boba places cater to. However, this is not a problem for me though as I usually take my boba to go.

BUT BACK TO THE TEA. We got a Black Tea Latte and Jasmine latte, both with boba. The tea tastes fresh and not powdery. They adjust the sweetness to your liking and if you don't like it - they'll remake it! Extremely helpful and personable staff that answers any questions you have. They didn't make me feel dumb asking about their drinks because it was my first time here. Will definitely be back and extremely glad to have high quality, yet affordable tea.

TIP: If you get boba in your tea, ask for ""less"" sweet. The honey in the boba adds natural sweetness which may be ""too sweet"" for some.",nw-xhnHsse5BHZK886laKQ,2,1,5,5nh3lNsqFIgOGRbgY3iCaw

It is great knowing that they will remake your drink or make you a completely different one if you didn't favor it.

FINALLY LEGIT BOBA IN VEGAS. 

It's been so long since I've had good boba in this town that I've pretty much filed it as a lost cause. Boba seemed like a faint memory, something I would just get while on vacation back ""home home"" in the Bay or in LA. I stopped thinking about boba as part of my daily life. (Heartbreaking I know.) 

Brew Tea has reawakened my love, making me feel things about boba I haven't felt in years lol. 

1. Sea salt cream - about time this became a boba shop staple. Put that ish on everything. 
2. Honey boba - perfect consistency and sweetness, pleasantly bouncy
3. Milk tea - from Hokkaido to Okinawa to regular milk tea, they're all rich in tea flavor.

Currently addicted to the cold brew coffee with sea salt cream.

For the first year and most of the second, I was obsessed with their Smokey Oolong and High Mountain (Green Oolong) Tea Lattes with their signature Sea Salt Cr√®me. Still very good drinks, but for the last few months, I've had the appetite for something lighter. After trying a few drinks, I have my new go-to beverage: Iced Mango Passion Fruit Green Tea with Boba (Less Sweet). It is refreshing, fruity, and so satisfying. This is absolutely my favorite dessert!

Ruben's favorites are Sunset on the Beach Slush and Cold Brew with Sea Salt Cr√®me (Cafe Latte) and though not my type of drinks, they are so good and I love sneaking a couple (or a few) sips.

Their crepes are also really good. I love the Caramela ($4.95) with fresh banana, caramel sauce, and slivered almonds, plus a scoop of vanilla ice cream (+$1). So delicious, you almost don't want to share it. The bad thing is that I can't indulge in a crepe and a boba tea together as it's much too sweet. It's a tough decision as they're both so desirable (but, of course, boba wins 99% of the time).

They still have their rewards program, but they've traded the stamp cards for electronic stars! The program is registered under your name and phone number and you receive a text message when you achieve a reward. Ten drinks equal a FREE Regular drink (upgrade to Large for $1).

It can get reeeally busy and pretty crowded (especially after school), but service is extremely quick (and very friendly)!

With 1242 Reviews and a 5 Star rating, I knew that Brew Tea Bar had some serious boba game. The people of Yelp had clearly spoken. 

I stopped by today and I was throughly impressed. 

From the minute I stepped into Brew Tea I knew that I would not be let down. Of course we were greeted the second we walked in. Someone behind the counter observed me staring at the menu and handed me a handheld menu with a smile. 

As I browsed the many different options that same friendly person who handed us menus asked if we had any questions. The big question for me was if they were able to substitute the milk with soy or almond milk. The answer was yes, they could. The popular menu items were also pointed out to us. 

I settled on the Okinawa Milk Tea, at the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers. 

My Okinawa Milk milk tea was AMAZING. The tea itself was so flavorful. I didn't mess with the sweetness level and it was perfect for me. The Boba was fresh, the perfect boba texture and consistency.

The staff that work the tea shop are knowledgeable and helpful with their recommendations and descriptions of all of the tea offerings. I ordered Roobois tea without bubbles and half sweetness. It was amazing!!! I had never heard of this specific tea but after hearing what it would taste like, I decided to give it a try. It was so good!! Slightly nutty, slightly sweet, and just perfect in every way. After I got my tea, I heard that this tea place actually specializes in their milk teas, so definitely give those a shot if you are unsure of what to order.

-jasmine latte: not a huge fan. This is their take on jasmine tea with sea cream. You can taste the sea salt but the cream is SOO overpowering that you don't taste any tea. At all!

My favorite is the Hokkaido milk tea, less sweet with all the fixings.  The boba and jelly are the right amount of chewy.  I've tried other drinks that were good but I keep coming back to that one.

The owner is super nice, and recognized me and chatted me up when I ran into him outside of his shop!

This was the first shop that popped up on the list of suggested places to go to. We figured it had plenty of 5 stars and plenty of reviews. I mean come on, as my friend stated, ""Not a lot of boba places have a 5 star rating"".  So we decided to go. 

This is a small shop. We were lucky that we missed the loooong line that followed us after we ordered. I ordered my usual - iced Thai tea with pudding. Generally the pudding is too hard in most boba spots but this one was soft and pretty tasty, not too sweet. The Thai tea itself was also not too sweet. I really liked it. The boyfriend ordered the passion fruit slushie and he really liked it. I wish I had the chance to taste it but I was really enjoying my Thai tea drink.  Oh and the prepped the drinks pretty fast so you're not waiting around for awhile. 

The only thing about this place that my friends and I weren't too keen about was the cashier. She didn't offer us the frequent buyer stamp card.  She also stamped the one card that we shared only 4 times even though we ordered 6 drinks. When we inquired why she did that she gave some statement about it's not in their policy and then she said something else but we couldn't hear it. Our friend even told her that she lived there and that it's her card but the cashier didn't want to hear it. She wasn't mean or rude about it, it was just a really weird situation.

Their drinks range from slushies, latte teas,  iced teas, milk teas, and fresh brew. My mom had gotten their Hokkaido Milk Tea (75% sweet) with boba and I had gotten their Brew Milk Tea (100% sweet) with boba. They gave a generous amount of ice (not too little/not too much) and their drinks were AMAZING! We had also gotten their classic crepe which contained nutella, bananas, and strawberries. It was delicious and I would definitely recommend! :) Quality drinks and food so you won't be disappointed coming here; no wonder why they're straight up 5-stars!

Now I want to give a shout out to one of their workers there because she was the sweetest person ever! I asked between three milk teas that caught my interest and she thoroughly explained each with precision. She was more than happy to help my mom and I! Fun fact: they offer military discount!

I just tried the place a little over 2 weeks ago and I am completely in love with this place. I have already filled out my first stamp card. 

Let's talk about the owner and the staff: They are the nicest people I have ever meet. The owner really knows his tea as well. He makes suggestions and allows for changes to your tea if you don't like the way it tastes. 

The tea itself: Okie so I really am into trying different things. They have a lot of teas the peak my interest. However, my favorite (and something that I can never get enough of) is the Hokkaido tea with egg pudding and boba. IT'S SO YUMMY. Although, it is more cream based since the tea is based of a Japanese toffee cream. If you are more into the flavor of black team I recommend the Okinawa tea(my sister's favorite). However, something that I like is the owner recommended to mix them together. It was still delicious. I just love creamy stuff though. Rose tea is also another one that I really enjoy.

I feel as though there isn't a bad thing on their menu and they really care about what the costumer likes. (Like I said if you don't like it they will remake it for you)

Also, something REALLY COOL is you can add the sea salt foam to your drinks. Which is AMAZING!!

The atmosphere/ambiance of the place is so cute and welcoming. It's got a kinda contemporary japan feel to it. I love the tables and sets. There is seating outside. The place is kinda small but at the same time it has a cuteness too it. I enjoy sitting there and being able to do some work on my laptop as well. Its just a very chill environment that can also be intimate and great for friends gathering together.

I've tried a couple of things. Their ""The Brew"" milk tea is simple yet the best milk tea ever. Their cocoberry is really good, if you're wanting to try something different. It's basically coconut and strawberries. It's nommy. Mango slush is an all-time classic. I just also love mango. Right now, their Thai milk tea is my absolute go-to. I've literally been craving it every single day.

Brew also makes specialty crepes and they are so good. This is such a good dessert spot just for these crepes. They have a couple of them on menu but I believe you can also make your own.

They're always consistent. I've never had an issue of my drink not tasting right or boba not being fresh enough. If there is an issue, it's nice that they give you an entire new drink fixing it.

We ordered the large brew milk tea with boba. After one sip, I was sold. Tea flavor is strong and delicious, not overly sweet at all. Boba was just the right chewy consistency, not too soft or hard. I'm sooo glad my boba search is over in Vegas! I'll definitely be going here from now on to get my boba fix :D

Oh I just wanted to add another thing, I also really like their crepes. We built our own crepe, we decided on getting a plain crepe with vanilla ice cream, whip cream, and strawberries and bananas. It was beyond delicious and huge! I love how they layered/wrapped the crepe with a ton of bananas and strawberries. And absolutely LOVED how they gave us such a generous scoop of ice cream for just an extra dollar. Most crepes I've had, the amount of ice cream was always smaller than the amount of whip cream. So for about 5 bucks for the amount of crepe you get here, is sooo worth the price!",bBxm5CRxNuj1EJpQ4Go0bA,0,1,5,u5Oi3QraGGWu6Lo5xetjXg

We also got the Hokkaido milk tea with sea salt cream which would be a good one if you like something thats on the richer side. This was a solid hokkaido milk as it was brewed tea. I don't know whats going on with boba spots in town using a premix that tastes kinda like herseys syrup - it's gross. 

Hubby and I shared a caramel crepe with whipped cream, bananas,nuts. It was a well made crepe with the right texture and right topping to crepe ratio. Probably one of my favorite crepes I've had recently. 

Other than the quality and taste being here, customer service is top notch. The girl who was at the counter was helpful with guiding our order choices.

This place is crack...literally. When I'm not here I'm thinking about my next ""fix."" I secretly have a paper menu at home that I mark which drinks I want to try and which ones I've had. One could mistaken it for a ""hit list"" if you will. 

What a perfect combination of great customer service and delicious drinks. From my experience, other similar establishments have little to no customer service whatsoever. At Brew Tea, their customer service really shines. Sou, Dennis, and Louis are extremely knowledgeable about their products and will do their best to help you find a drink you'll like. They really go the extra mile here to make sure you're satisfied with your drink. If you don't love your drink, they will make you something else. Don't be shy and don't feel bad. They can tell if you don't like it! Even if they are busy, they still do their rounds to see if you like your drink. They also insist those taking their drinks to-go to taste it before they leave. 

Drinks tried: 
Slush: 
Taro slush - The best in town. They use real taro along with the purple, artificial powder stuff we all know and love. This drink is really balanced and not too sweet! 

Cocoberry - Basically, a Miami vice minus the rum. Too sweet, but if coconut and strawberry are your thing. Go for it. Adjust the sweetness and this might be someone's perfect poolside drink. 

Milk tea: 
Taro - You can taste the real bits of taro! Same great balanced taste like the slush. I prefer the slush because I like the thicker consistency for my taro drinks. 

Okinawa - A brown sugar based milk tea. Some of their drinks can be on the sweeter side. I originally ordered this less sweet, which I instantly regretted. I had this one re-made to be 5 of 5 sweetness level and loved it! 

Caramel - Perfectly, sweet. Added egg pudding as a topping. Great combo. I think that the caramel milky slush with egg pudding would be a great combo as well.

Latte: 
Side note: their lattes are topped with sea salt foam. The salt is really delicate and not salty at all. It enhances the flavors of the drink, especially the sweetness. My two cents, taste your drink before you mix it all up!! Some drinks may taste better if you let the foam seep in as you drink. Even a light mix is good. I stare when people shake up their drinks aggressively. It's like dude, did you taste it yet? Whatevs, to each their own. Anyways, I find if you play it safe you can achieve a different experience with each sip.

Black tea - Black tea lovers will love this one. This is a winner in my hubby's book. 

Oolong - We opted for the roasted version, which gave it a nice smoky taste. Our taste buds will stick with the black tea latte or the cold brew coffee. 

Mango - This one is a skip. It is one of the sweeter drinks. Mango is sweet and the sea salt makes it sweeter. If you love mango, adjust the sweetness level on this accordingly. 

Cold brew coffee - Best. Drink. Ever. The coffee is strong, smooth, and balanced. No harsh, acidic coffee here. I enjoyed this in three phases. First couple sips, I drank the coffee and left the sea salt foam alone. Amazing. Second phase, I mixed some sea salt foam in it. Wow. The sweetness of the coffee was elevated. Last phase, of course is when it is a yummy, homogenous concoction! Too bad this place is out of my way. I would love this before every brutal 12 hour night shift! 

Last but not least, let's talk balls. You know the dark, chewy stuff some of you like to sip on. The boba or tapioca pearls at Brew tea are of the honey variety, which means they are sweet. Not sure how I feel about the honey boba here. Right now, I think it is due to inconsistency. Honestly, most of the time I order drinks without boba. There is a place in town that I have a love/hate relationship with. ""KFT"" has the best boba balls in town, but I really dislike their drinks and customer service. HA! I said it. 

Must try their iced teas and herbal teas next! 

Suggestion: Seating! Currently, there are 3 tables that seat 4 each and a bench for people to wait for their drink. When it is busy, smaller parties don't have a place to hang out. Any possibility to add a bar top counter to the wall up front with some cool bar stools? I know, I'm reaching here...",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,13,11,5,l8jNcaufBdh9cbao6NZgrg

Admittedly not the biggest boba fan before, as of late I have become quite the boba monstah and have been alternately going between BTB and my original preferred place Kung fu tea. BTB has quite the edge for me now due to the outstanding service I get from Dennis. He's always there to guide you thru orders, helping you figure out what you want and offers suggestions along the way. Even in times when choices are questionable, he'll oblige and always tells you their disclaimer that if for whatever reason you are not satisfied with your drink they'll remake it until you do. Sou is just as awesome, top notch service always with a smile and aims to please. It amazes me that they remember regulars and their orders because there's quite a lot of us lol. That to me is personalized service and that's what sets them apart in my book and truly deserving of the 5 stars! Thus my loyalty lies with the BEST!

I have since tried Hokkaido milk tea which is like drinking dessert, not in the sense that it's a sugar overload but that it's creamy and decadent, sweetness is customizable of course! This last time I tried Earl Grey with sea salt cr√®me and that my friends is a winner! I have found my favorite drink, although I still have quite a lot to try from their menu, the possibilities are endless here with the combinations you can do! Another big plus compared to KFT's limited flavor customization due to their franchise limitations. The boba has been consistently great which leads me to believe that my taste buds were probably out of whack on my first visit lol. I also got a Strawberry Banana slush for the kids to share, that was a winner in my book as well. I'm not sure if they used powder or real fruits, it didn't taste artificial to me and was quite refreshing actually.

The place is phenomenal, a smorgasbord of Latte Teas, Iced Teas, Slushes, Milk Teas, Fresh Brews. The teas are naturally made which means you get more flavor and their is less added sugar.

Almond Milk Tea - Creamy almond milk mixed with brewed tea.

I've been coming here since they first opened and as far as fresh brewed tea they are the best in town! 

This is a long over due review, as many others have stated (& with 700+ positive reviews) you know they serve amazing quality tea and drinks! The customer service is always 5+ stars, always friendly, fast, welcoming and goes above and beyond. Everything I have tried here is delicious. 

My favorites: 

****  My #1 Go To: Lavender Fresh Brew -- I LOVE LAVENDER. This is my fave drink here. As far as I know this is the only boba place in town that serves fresh brewed lavender tea and without sugar. It smells divine! Especially when HOT! All the flavors and aroma fill the space you're in. I recommend getting a little honey added, but if adding honey boba I recommend no additional honey. 

- Caramel Slush with egg pudding and boba! SO GOOD. A must try. 

- Cold Brew Coffee Latte - Cold brew is delish with sea salt cream! 

Tried: 

- Mango Latte - is really sweet compared to the other drinks. I recommend getting 50% sweetness. Still love it. 

- Jasmine Latte - 25% sweetness - I didn't like it at this sweetness level (the flavor wasn't there) so I recommend getting it with a higher level sweetness. I'm watching my sugar intake (diabetic) so I appreciate the fact that I have the option to adjust sweetness levels. 

- Rosebud Fresh Brew - I couldn't taste anything with this one. Not bad. 

I've tried their other drinks but don't remember the name. All their drinks are not overly sweet like some other tea places. The great thing about this place is if you don't like your drink let them know and they'll make you a new one. They want you to leave happy and satisfied! 

The Brew Tea Bar cravings are real. It's like crack. So I have to pace myself with this. 

I hope they consider multiple locations around the valley, one in Henderson please! :-) Aloha!",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,12,11,5,PAE13Py3cz1ApwHPN34zIA

I'm so surprised this is my first time coming here! I really admire how you can get the option of which percentage of sweetness you'd like, i got mine 70% less sweet. 

The parking location/plaza wasn't bad, I came here around 8-9pm so the business around it were either empty or closed so there was parking in front. The store inside has an adorable nature woody themed to it, and it was a really relaxing environment. I wouldn't recommend it for students to study here because it's a bit nosy with people talking and music. And it's a bit small so finding tables can be hard if it's crowded too.

The staffs are ALL so welcoming and super duper fast paced! Customer service is key and they are efficient. They make the drinks so fast and always keep busy. When i went there was a line and all the tables and chairs were taken, that just shows how amazing their drinks really are. No wonder why they have such good reviews on yelp because this place deserves it! 

I literally have a note pad on my phone of the drinks i want to try next time i go! (Next up.. tea, slush, and crepes!!) Hehe I also LOVE how they offer a loyalty star and for my opinion they have more option choices than normal boba shops variety wise. 

What we tried was.. 

Coconut Milk tea: Not too sweet, perf. coconut flavor not too overwhelming and refreshing 

Taro Milk tea: The REAL DEAL, you can taste the blended taro in this, NOT POWDER! 

Hokkaido Milk tea: (FAVE) sweet latte vanilla flavor 

ALL the drinks have AMAZING CHEWY tapioca balls (boba) i'm always so picky if my boba is too hard or isn't flavorful and theirs is sweet, soft, chewy & perfect!

Back home, nearly every corner had a decent boba shop. Moving here to Vegas really sucked...I couldn't find decent boba. Most places either undercooked their boba or overcooked it and the places who had good tasting boba had bad tea. It was a struggle for the first few months that I was here.

Thankfully someone introduced me to brew tea and I finally got some decent boba tea again! They cook their boba perfectly how it should taste. It's squishy and chewy but not soggy. As for their milk teas I've tried a variety of different drinks and they've all been good to me. I would say some of them are sweeter than others but it's nothing too much. I recommend ordering 75% sugar your first time (especially on the Hokkaido). Never order their chrysanthemum tea with no sugar unless you know what you're getting yourself into. I also tried their sunset beach drink but I was definitely not a fan of that.

My go to drink here is the taro milk tea or slush. This drink has taro bits in it and the the slush has a scoop of taro on top.

I also really enjoy the almond milk tea here but i feel that is an acquired taste for some.

Their Japanese matcha tea is good and has just the right amount of sweetness and matcha

A drink that I love from this place is the Okinawa with boba, I always come to Brew Tea just for that specific drink. I have also tried their crepes, which is good as well. This spot is popular for friends hanging out and for people to study. 

Once you enter the store the cashier will be to your left and depending on the day they may or may not have a rush. Once you place your order and pay you wait to the left side where they will bring out your drink. If you chose to sit on a table they will run it out directly to you, which I appreciate! Each time they gave me my drink they'd always say ""let us know if something is wrong and we'll make arrangements on your drink."" It's rare to find a business that cares for their customers and does not hesitate to make things right. At other boba places that I have been to when they get our order wrong they question you or tell you ""yes you did order that drink [that way],"" and you're left with feeling as if you have no option but to take what is given to you... Fortunately, not at Brew Tea, YAY! 

The only thing I don't like about this place is the lack of tables and space during their busy hours. Price ranges depending on what you want, two large drinks with boba costs me about $11. Also, they have stamp cards just ask for it.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,1,1,4,dJ40CYPc_GixA38mkqvvpw

The milk teas are so smooth and with the perfect amount of sweetness. I thought I would have to adjust the sweetness level but it was so good.. no need!

I usually order their Honeydew Milk Tea/Slushies and have no problem with them. Lastnight was the first time I ordered a crepe though. I had the Classic ($4.50); strawberry, banana, nutella. They have whipped cream and ice cream as optional add-on's as well but I opted out. I also decided to be adventurous and NOT order the same drink. So I ordered a Strawberry Latte (no boba) and that was a mistake... But I'll get to that. 

The Classic Crepe was pretty good. The texture of the crepe was perfect; wasn't cooked too thin or made too thick, and the size of their crepes were definitely large enough to share as well. The Strawberry Latte was a mistake. I ordered it hot with no boba. There's some kind of cream that they put ontop of the latte that gives the latte itself a really weird inital taste. But it also has a weird AFTER taste that's not too pleasant in my opinion either. The strawberry flavor just tasted extremely artificial.

Yes, I have decided that Brew Tea Bar is officially THE #1 spot for milk teas and flavored teas. THE NUMBER ONE. Take it in, think about it, and don't argue with me. 

After my initial review, I have returned to Brew Tea Bar a few more times to try a few more things. They now have sea salt coffee. THEY HAVE SEA SALT COFFEE. And you know what? It's pretty damn good and it's also pretty damned strong. Need a lift? Oh, this will give you a lift. This will give you more than a lift. This would get you jumping! Their coffee is strong yet not bitter or acidic and it is BEYOND smooth. It's delicious! Whenever I drink their sea salt coffee, I feel as though I've drank a red bull. IT GIVES ME WINGS. It's just unfortunate that they don't open that early so I can't get it before work... booooo haha! 

I have also requested a strawberry green tea. They don't have it on the menu but they definitely have the ingredients to make it. Most places make their flavored ice teas quite sweet so I had them add notes: more tea flavor and less sweet. I believe there was a miscommunication for my order so when I got it and tasted it, I wasn't really sure what I was drinking. It tasted quite weird. No tea flavor and no fruit flavor. However, they remade it, got it right, and it was perfect -- wasn't too sweet with immense jasmine tea flavor. It was perfection in a cup. 

Brew Tea Bar also doesn't back down from a challenge or any difficult customization that you have in mind. Strawberry milk tea. People don't drink it for the tea, people drink it for the sweetness! Well, I'll be DARNED. But it's okay. Sou was up for a challenge so he gave it a go. I needed it less sweet with a noticeable tea flavor to go along with it and he was definitely able to complete this challenge. Tons of tea, strawberry, and no added sugar. Done. A little tangy due to the strawberries with tea flavor. Yup. Done. I'm good. 

I am typically afraid to order fruit based milk teas in other places because: if I don't like their regular milk tea, I'm probably not going to like any other milk teas that they have. But it's okay, Brew Tea Bar has got you.

I'm secretly hoping one of them slip up because CONSISTENCY lacks here in the valley. None-the-less, from the first time we tried Brew TEA up until late...they prove to be consistent. I'm never once worried about who is working.  

My previous post we had the caramel milk tea and strawberry black tea. We certainly have moved on from that and our official go-to drinks when driving across the border (joke) are the taro slush & their Okinawan milk tea w/sea salt cream (if you've never been be sure to add that in your drink). Just pure deliciousness I tell you. Honestly, while the Taro milk tea is good...I say if you opt for the slush version you will be a million more pleased. Trust.

They don't have 5 stars for nothing nor are they a fluke... and I'm still dreaming of a Brew Tea bar up I. The North/NW end. Sigh. They have secured our hearts! Lol

I don't know if it was because I always ordered the wrong things, but every boba I've tasted before was just average, common like every other boba flavor out there. I guess you can say that I didn't understand the hype about the place. 

Then I found out you can customize drinks. Haha silly me for not knowing that. The real beauty of this boba store isn't the drinks on the menu, but the flexibility they have to customize those drinks into something really, really special. 

Based off of my friend's recommendation to give Brew Tea another shot, I ordered the Hokkaido Milk Tea w/ sea salt. At first sip, I was just blow away. So tasty! It leaves sweet and slightly salty flavor in your mouth that keeps the drink from becoming boring. You can practically drink the whole thing and be unsatisfied due to the sole fact that you just want to drink even MORE. 

In the meantime, I'll scour on Yelp to look for more customizations that are really popular. And as for now, I definitely understand the hype. 

I'm giving a shoutout the owner for his amazingly attentive customer service. Upon entering the shop, I was handed a menu to easily pick what drink I wanted to order. When I recited my order to the cash registrar, he began completing my drink so that it would be ready by the time I finished ordering.

If the drink isn't to your satisfaction, they'll keep remaking it until it is.  Too sweet, too bitter, or if you just flat out don't like it, take advantage of this offer and get something else.

Sou was definitely the star of the place. He was friendly to the guests before me and so smiley. He made recommendations to get both lychee and egg pudding at no extra charge to mix. I conceded and WOW. He offered condensed milk and I can't stop drinking this wonderful drink. Perfect consistency, flavor, and size for price. He made the drink to make sure it was exactly what I wanted and ensured my boyfriend if he didn't like what he ordered, he could replace it. Wow.

Although i'm not a fan of actual boba, I love getting milk teas, smoothies, hot tea, etc. Brew Tea's menu consists of all of the above and every drink that I have tried has been amazing. The staff are always super friendly and they make sure that if you don't like your drink, that they'll remake one for you. Sou is the best and I can always ask for his honest opinion on drinks that i'm deciding on choosing. Another plus is that they have a stamp card which I'm sure everyone else loves. Aside from drinks you are also able to get crepes and can customize one if you would like to do so (they're just as good as the drinks)!

MILK TEAS
If I'm craving for a milk tea my to go drinks are a rose milk tea, hokkaido milk tea, and matcha milk tea

LATTES
One thing about their lattes is that you can add sea salt creme to your drink! The black tea latte and jasmine tea latte with sea salt creme are both my favorite drinks out of the whole menu.

FRESH BREWS
The chrysanthemum tea is my favorite out of the brews. I have also tried it as a milk tea and it was good (if you like light drinks). You can customize any of these brews to be a milk tea, but you can always ask the staff if they think it will taste good or not!

Screw the original brew milk tea and the Hokkaido milk tea! It's all about that Okinawa. Tastes like Asia. I also like their cold brew coffee with sea salt cream and the strawberry milky slush.

The drinks are not watered down. It has a nice sweetness to it when you first take a sip and you can taste a kick of the tea towards the end. That's the best way I can describe it. You just gotta try it out to know what I'm talking about. I like mine with with egg pudding. With the combination you can taste a double kick to the drink.

I ordered the Hokkaido milk tea with sea salt cream and boba. I got it 50% sweetness since I read another Yelp review that said the drink is like 1000 calories and I got scared. I'm also not a fan of super sweet drinks. They told me that the sea salt cream is supposed to make it less sweet as well, but it still ended up being too sweet for me. I'll go 25% next time and recommend anyone that's not too huge a fan of sweetness to do the same.

Their boba is sooooooooooo soft, probably one of the best textures and consistencies I've ever had. But some people may actually like it chewier. If you let the boba sit for a bit before drinking, it'll harden a bit.

I have surveyed many of the tea houses in the 626 in Los Angeles, and this place is just as good as the top tier places. I tried the honey green tea at half sweet/less ice with grass jelly and it was spot on. The green tea had a nice deep brew flavor and the hints of bitterness came through with the grass jelly. Apparently, they make their own grass jelly, so no canned products here. The sweetness level was near perfection and I was able to savor that genuine honey. Yummy! Service was superb. Solid boba tea house in LV. My only downside, if any, is that the location is somewhat far from the strip - maybe a 10-15 min drive.",LniV8mGWGuWLoJ96dhNVIw,1,1,5,RrEc9v31p0TqBlgiaM67-A

It was fabulous. Nice selection of milk teas. Beautiful, fresh tasting brewed tea flavor, just as the name suggests. Boba was soft and chewy, amazing texture and flavor. I went with the Okinawa milk tea which is milk tea with brown sugar. A bit sweet, but 50% sweetness was perfect.

Long lines, but quick service. Moved through the line quickly and the drinks were made efficiently. They have a few tables to sit at and free wi-fi. Sign up for their rewards program - after 10 drinks, you get 1 free.",DqKKPT9KYXiyJJsWGXRUhA,4,2,5,RSv48U8B5ssgdRrydPHyYw

From the moment I walk inside, I feel happy. My go-to drink is the Taro Slush. It's lightly sweet and the most beautiful shade of purple. It's blended to creamy perfection and topped with fresh taro. I go boba free because I am simply not a fan. I'm always greeted warmly by the staff who are like a machine. They have waves of busy times, but all the time, so don't let the long line intimidate you. They move fast and know what they are doing.

My latest trip I was tempted to order an actual tea but wasn't sure what I wanted. The girl at the register was super nice and took her time with me while I pushed myself out of my Taro Slush comfort zone. I ordered the Peach iced tea and added the Sea Salt Cream. It sounded good at the time and it was a pretty tasty combo! I probably wouldn't order my personalized creation again but I was a big fan of the tea itself. The sea salt cream is heaven.

I wish the menu was a bit more descriptive but that's because I get ordering anxiety sometimes (you should see me at a drive-thru). Anytime I have a question, the staff at Brew Tea Bar will make sure I'm taken care of.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,24,27,5,iWTJrRN9hSl61IICHKQZgw

Super reasonably priced! Same price or lower than other boba places.

Boba: 5/5
Perfectly chewy ^_^

Drinks: 5/5
I've only tried their slushes and milk teas and they're both SO good. I looovveee their honeydew and mango slushes.

Customer Service: 5/5
They have the best customer service. Their drinks are pretty sweet, but they tell you when they hand it to you that they'll remake it if it's not to your liking. They're incredibly friendly and also super attentive to every drink order.

Awesome service. Awesome location. Awesome boba.

My only issue would be that every time I've had drinks, they've always been more on the sweeter side. Like I'm drinking straight up sugar. I love that they do the, if you don't like it you we can change it for you, type of thing, but I don't know, just too much sugar.... I feel like it should be the right amount of sugar/syrup every time you make something. Other than that, their boba is super tasty and the right texture. I love that they give you a good amount.

If you don't like your drink they'll happily take it back and make it according to your taste. However, their boba is sometimes too chewy but it doesn't seem to bother me.

They have a secret menu, but only has one item which is a Cold Brew Coffee topped with their Sea Salt Cream. There is no bitter taste after you drink it and the cream adds a new flavor to the original coffee.",EdRyABUBJODhytoYWHmD8w,1,0,5,bwbG2hXtooFgLCWgjkdsbw

Anyway, the taro milk tea is my classic favorite as it's subtle in sweetness but the blend of honey boba really accentuate the flavor. Pair with egg pudding and the kick is even more flavorful. I can't ask for anything better in Boba.
