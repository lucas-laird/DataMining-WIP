445430,2012-04-18,1,oQwadWTYQWahuj9N-68yPA,"This place was a last minute decision to fulfill my craving for honey walnut shrimp, one of my favorite Chinese food entrees. I was actually on my way to a different establishment when I found this place.

When I arrived I was a tad skeptical. The place was empty and it literally looked like there was no one inside. Had it not been for the bright ""Open"" sign in the window, I would have put the car in reverse and left immediately. I walked inside to find the cashier sitting at one of the tables, dabbling on her laptop. She was very prompt and got up quickly to greet me. She handed me the menu and after a quick page through, I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp ($9.95).

It didn't take long for my order to come out (standard Chinese food 10 minutes). I waited patiently and surveyed the establishment. I had to give this place only 3 stars based mainly on my surroundings. The table was a little sticky and the lighting was terrible. I don't think it would be an ideal place to eat, maybe just take out. When my food came out, I thanked her and headed home to try out their version of the tasty seafood dish.

The portion of the dish was a good size and it was pretty good. It was definitely sweet like all the other Chinese places I've been to, but this place added a different touch to it. When I bit into a shrimp, not only was it sweet, I also tasted a hint of lemon. It was such a nice change especially with a dish like Honey Walnut Shrimp. Usually I can eat a handful of the dish and get sick of it because it's overly sweet and too creamy. The lemon in this dish offset the sweetness and it wasn't overwhelming. My only gripe was that the walnuts weren't candied. I enjoy candied walnuts with my Honey Walnut Shrimp because they tend to be crunchier and it serves as a kind of ""after the meal dessert.""

If I was in the area again, I would definitely try another one of their dishes to make sure I didn't just get lucky and pick the one delicious entree. Dining in? Not so much. Take out? Without question.",53hTHxGUy7AC8Oz7BE7-3g,3,1,3,j6ZiqtjKmlVztgRP8M7IYg

I literally live across from mandarin express, and have always been skeptical about giving it a try. Parents were in town and suggested Chinese food for dinner. I was extremely lazy that day and figured I should try mandarin express since it was only seconds from my house.
  
The place is very small, and looked closed because they never have the doors open. Don't get discouraged, and try it! I was actually surprised at how good the food was. Since the place is not busy, they make everything fresh right after ordering. Along with great food, I found the lady there to be very nice (she's not too fluent in eng, however she was very nice).
  Will be going here from now on to get my Chinese food.",WPeEOH4f2C69SqKdntAmcg,2,0,5,VdukvQege4chWPtuIZaGTA

3424581,2012-11-16,0,oQwadWTYQWahuj9N-68yPA,"""I love this place for take home Chinese food. Nothing beats it. I usually order Hong Kong Noodles or Singapore Noodles and their crab ragoon or fried wonton are really great. This is comfort food for me. The people who run it don't speak much but they are very friendly. Not the best decor to eat in, but taste great on your couch in front of the tv.""",mrWU_dit9BB5gXDIY0moyw,0,0,4,Y-2l9iICoGYUNxWl-S2hug
4394787,2012-12-19,0,oQwadWTYQWahuj9N-68yPA,Seriously this place is good. I've tried 5 dishes and all are good. Everything is made right in front of you in the wok. It's cleaner and doesn't leave you feeling like crap after. Good find. Mom and pop ran. Way better then panda could ever be and way better tasting,oTNCeMxaeTkJJjgEOE57GA,0,0,5,LPzGi7YJwffPvXAHUjP4Jg
4491229,2012-12-27,0,oQwadWTYQWahuj9N-68yPA,I wanted to go to Rice Trax but they were closed so we came here . They share the same parking lot so we didn't need to go far. I ordered the Orange Chicken which was made to order. It had that crispness that I love served with some tasty fried rice. I was happy with my order but my brother wasn't happy with his beef steak. He said there were too many veggies and not enough beef. I like that they make everything fresh.  I didn't see any food under heat lamps which I thought was a refreshing change.,48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,0,1,4,a0gHQ-D-N6aphV9YqPeoTw
