I only waited for about 7 minutes, but the fact that the employee that the bartender was speaking to watched me sit down without acknowledging me or letting her know I was there was a huge turn off. He waited until they were done with their conversation before letting her know I was there.",CMhX-uga2DKFkR_HK8935w,0,0,2,ojsTPxYAShxz1hnWBvRJ4A

They definitely put love into making their food and you can taste it! On top of the love they put into the food they have specials for a few days of the week! $5 patron margaritas!?!! You can't beat that. Our first time here we ordered burgers. I ordered the chili cheese burger. My guy ordered the bacon and egg burger. I've had my fair share of those so I opted for something different. This chili cheese burger was was fresh and juicy! It had just the right amount of messy! The chili was the perfect amount and you could taste all the ingredients. The French fries were stars all on their own. I tasted these fresh out of kitchen fries and thought to myself:""now this is how French fires should taste!"" Cooked to perfection! 

Another day we ordered the tacos which were 3 for $6. All I can say is the fish tacos are some of the best I've had. Crispy, delicious little morsels they are. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I am not a fan of cole slaw but these have it on top and omg it's perfect. Again fresh ingredients you taste in every bite. The bartender suggested the social smash. It has bourbon in it and it's delcious. I had 3. Let's just say I was feeling very nice afterwards and leave it at that lol!

Lastly I want to mention the atmosphere. The TVs are HUGE! I couldn't decide where to watch what because there are so many TVs! You can sit at the bar, at a table on the outskirts near the casinos or sit cozily in a booth on the outskirts of the place and still see as many TVs as you want! This place is a must if you are staying at the palms.",N35brXkpfZ1E38AlqndKnw,1,0,5,5uPY94_f4pxNHPLswk9Bgg

But don't walk by me 10 times without a curtesy nod or something.   Geez.  30 minutes for a beer.  And now it's been 30 minutes since I requested a menu, haven't seen it yet.  Get rid of cutie pie with the big cans and get 2 bartenders who can work together as a team.  Beautiful place.  It's the only complaint I have about the Palms.  Everything else has been great.  
UPDATE: had the carnitas tacos.  TERRIBLE!!!
Dried out and over cooked.  Like splinters of wood.  I took a picture showing some pieces I just had to remove from my mouth for fear of chipping a tooth. Saw the managers and executive chef hanging around like observers of a new opening.  The bar would be better served if they helped fill a few beer glasses and hand out some menus.  I hate to write such a bad review. But it'll make you better.  Hopefully.  The Spanish girl is doing a good job covering for everyone.",rLXrZcv9BmTaL9doyt91WA,1,0,2,uLKURzEFh79haFwIBlCThQ

We were treated poorly and the fact that the guy that asked for the channel to be changed was white and the person I was with and other patron was not seems A little suspicious imho",8bvIZsde0tkR5QyQUU-lBg,0,0,1,gULeIwcEVkAMjYWLXQAoJg
5015431,2017-09-10,1,KrcXBdIlqJ4tiaWNqketug,"Not sure why this place only has two stars. The hostess and servers were very kind, and nice enough to seat us immediately. We ordered the fish and chips, carnitas fries, honey Sriracha wings, and the sticky balls for dessert. There was 3 servers, including the hostess, who checked on us during our visit. They were busy and managed to check on us frequently. We waited about 10 minutes for the food, and it was hot and fresh. The honey Sriracha wings were definitely my favorite. The sticky balls were like a lightly fried dough drizzled in caramel with vanilla ice cream. They did have several different football games playing. I enjoyed myself and would recommend this place to others who were looking for good food at an affordable price.",njU6H3n1xYVOM8Ucx-95rg,1,1,5,f7TKW15PoM9ZG0wxAn-dzQ
