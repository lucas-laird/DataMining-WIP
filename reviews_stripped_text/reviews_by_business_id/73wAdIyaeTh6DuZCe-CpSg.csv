I'm confuse why it's listed as $$$$ on here because salads are like $8 and not expensive at all.

1424925,2018-03-29,0,73wAdIyaeTh6DuZCe-CpSg,Delicious! So happy to finally have good takeout in the neighborhood- probably the BEST babaganoush I've ever had! The shami Kabob was so flavorful and the potatoes you get as a side were so good I wished I asked fo an extra side of them. The gyro meet was also one the best I've had- nice thick cuts full of flavor & you can actually taste that they use lamb not like some of the others out there. This is definitely my new go to place for good Mediterranean takeout.,srrkoH9n-ZUXb_uTUu3VHg,2,0,5,fE0PZEpwpoaR4E5c6160jw

1516599,2018-04-25,1,73wAdIyaeTh6DuZCe-CpSg,"Just got back from this place, so I wanted to write a review as soon as possible, because it was terrific!

My wife and I were looking for a kabob spot for lunch today and Yelp, once again, came through! This place popped up as a hot and new place, and since it's so close to us, we decided to try it. I have to be honest with myself though, being from LA, and having a plethora of Middle-Eastern options, I wasn't optimistic at ALL about this place, but I'm glad my wife was steadfast with her decision to come!

My wife got the #16 - Gyro Platter, but substituted fries and bread for all salad. I went with the #29 Combo Kabob, where you can pick three kabobs ($3 more for lamb or filet mignon). I chose the chicken thighs, ground chicken and beef kabob. I also asked for my side to be all salad, rather than rice (sorry for the crappy pic, there was a shadow cast on my plate cause of where I was sitting, and I was too lazy to move over, lol). 

The chicken thighs were by far my favorite. If you like chicken thighs, you'll love their chicken thigh kabobs! The salad was also great, especially because the dressing it comes with was so unique. David (the owner/chef), called it a chutney, but the flavors reminded me of Persian-style-torshi (think, pickled veggies), that's been turned into a salad dressing. Amazing! They were out of their Shami kabob, which I equate to koobideh, so I can't wait to go back and try that out.

David was super nice and welcoming, and Stacey who was front of the house, was very friendly and prompt. Great service!

I'm super ecstatic that this place is so good and so close! WIN!

1670573,2018-04-25,0,73wAdIyaeTh6DuZCe-CpSg,"Amazing! Ignore the photos posted this place is legit good. Some background...the hubs is Persian and we eat Persian food very often, kabob is a weekly thing. We've tried a ton of places. We ordered the gyro plate with salad and did the 3 kabob sample entree so we could try everything. The Shami was sold out so next time for that choice. We picked chicken thigh, ground chicken and beef (should have done lamb but always wait to see quality of the meat before picking that). The chicken thigh was the best I've had ever, cooked perfect and juicy, highly recommend. They serve the plates with a green chutney (torshi) that is crave worthy and I wanted to buy a separate tub of it, must try! This shopping center doesn't get a lot of foot traffic so let's keep this placing going strong.",6e3oMOiqlSKX6kaEgoDjSw,1,0,5,wCVXIuU8Br56uJ7gntrnEQ

1828173,2018-06-07,0,73wAdIyaeTh6DuZCe-CpSg,Mediterranean food is one of my all time favorites and we have a lot of places here in town that serve it.  Most are just average but the Kabob Kitchen is one of those gems that you are lucky to find when you take a chance.  I tried the chicken Kabob and Gyro salad.  Both were excellent and the price is so low that I worry about them being able to stay in business.  The food is way better than the price would indicate.

I ordered the gyro platter which comes with salad and fries. Grandma ordered the lamb kabobs with salad, a side of fries and a drink. Total for everything was around $32. The food is cooked to order so it did take some time for everything to come out. 

The gyro meat was very good. It is a mix of beef and lamb with all the right spices. The pieces were nice and thick. The tzatziki sauce on the side was tasty, but I wish there were more of it. Grandma's lamb kabob was delicious. It came with a side of chimichurri that I would have drank if no one was looking. The fries were just fries but they give you a decent portion.

For starters, we ordered the hummus. It comes with pita bread, but we ordered extra because we were both eating it. The hummus was great and the pita bread was also really good - and tasted extremely fresh.

I ordered the gyro wrap. It was very good, but the meat was a tad spicy. The price point was great for all the food you receive.

My fiancé ordered the chicken kabob plate. It came with a side of hummus (which was delish!), pita bread, rice and of course the chicken. The chicken was flavorful and cooked to perfection.

I will definitely be coming back.",m-R9m15HgUJkEMIJeaR2dw,0,0,5,D9hWk-bvyF2l_qSe06UitA

Walk in, go to the counter and order, then pick your seat if you're dining in.

I asked the lady at the counter when this place was opened, she said a month ago. The menu is on the wall but if you need a little time, you can also grab one of the menus from the counter.

She told me 20 mins for the order. While I waited, I noticed the place was brightly lit with nice paintings on the wall. There are 7 tables and 2 booths.

I ordered Bulgarian Kabobs $14 and it came with a small side of salad, 2 small pita bread, rice and a potato dish similar to curry. The kabobs were tasty and well seasoned.

I also liked their Sambosa $4.95, two deep fried wrap with potatoes, ground beef, peas etc.

It was a tab bit more pricey than my other favorite place but I am happy this place is much closer to where I am.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,3,1,4,tz8yeHf0dw4HhSwk8xpxbQ

Second off, she picks up her cellphone and starts texting in the middle of my transaction. The menu states with an entree it includes rice OR salad and bread. I read the menu wrong, my fault. I asked her ""does this come with a salad?"" She says .. ""um, i guess I'll get you one."" She didn't answer my question, and gave me some serious attitude. I went back online to discover I actually read it wrong. I would have been more satisfied not receiving the free salad, and being told politely I read it wrong. Ha!
