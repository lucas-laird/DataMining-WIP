I can't claim to be a connoisseur of Hawai'ian food, so to say I've experienced better, I'll have to say that as a generality.  Better quality, quantity, and priced food is out there.  For what it is, it's not bad.

I had the combination BBQ plate for a sampling.  It included some thinly sliced beef, ribs, and chicken along with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad.  Really it wasn't as much food as that may sound, but reasonable.  The ribs very obviously came from a cheaper, older animal, and the chicken is all dark meat (so make no delusions of it being healthier).  Basically they were all thin cuts to quickly grill, sauce, and serve.  So in terms of expediency, I'll give them kudos there.  Oh, and don't expect anything more out of the cashier other than giving your order due to that language barrier I oh so enjoy (seriously).",0c0d6-jwJoAlwMVcOowEQg,1,0,2,D6yNMmL6OzhOwE558dhCQA

It's also a notch down from L&L's and you may just feel like you're settling. I took off 1 star because every time I call an order in they usually say 10 or 15 minutes until it's ready. I tend to always get there in about 20 minutes and tend to wait at least another 5 or 10 minutes for them to bring me my order. I took off 2 stars because I had over easy eggs during one time eating there and one of the eggs tasted differently than the others.

That made me worried that nobody really ordered the Loco Moco.  Maybe they were busy defrosting the hamburger patties still...  

The food itself was actually not bad, not great.  Beef patties, eggs and gravy over white rice.  I would get it again if I was craving it, which is once in a blue moon.  i noticed they had malasadas which i will try next time.  I also want to see how there combination bbq plate is.

Now, not to sound judgmental (but, in actuality, totally judgmental), but I've found Hawaiian places with pictures of the menu items on the wall to be total letdowns. ""Meh"" city, you might say.  So, I had few hopes of a satisfying meal at Lulu Hawaiian BBQ.  

But, the food turned out to be really good!  The Lau Lau plate was perfect, not overcooked at all.  The quality of the fish was also excellent, the perfect blend of fatty and lean.  I also enjoyed the macaroni salad as it wasn't too caked in mayo.  I would definitely get this again and again and again...

We love Hawaiian food and eat it wherever we can find a restaurant.
So sad to write this review because I don't want to give up on Lulu's yet.
Poke and curry is something I try at every joint I go.
But this place, I don't know...it isn't hitting the spot.
The last two times I've gotten the curry it was either too salty or not enough gravy but the thing that kills me is they bread the shrimp for the curry. It tastes like left overnight shrimp from the walnut shrimp. My last and I really mean my last order was full of hunks of breading that didn't even have shrimp in it! For the price I paid, I'd like some shrimp!!!
The breaded part isn't even the deal breaker..it's the fact the shrimp breading was so salty and then you pour an already salty curry sauce on top...nope. Just nope. 
I was too hungry, and decided (against my better judgement) to PICK the breading off maybe 6 small, dry as all hell shrimp...now I'm hangry because of this and can't even bring myself to eat the curry sauce and rice.

In an effort to grab a bite before a work event my partner and I stumbled upon this place. We had no idea what the hell we wanted to eat and Lulu won our vote simply because of proximity. The only thing we needed to see was Spam musubi on the menu and we felt safe to proceed with our gamble. 

Our order consisted of two Spam musubis, an order of kalua pork and some kind of a grilled BBQ chicken plate. After reading that the only difference between a small and large plate was the number of scoops of rice and mac salad we decided that the small would do just fine. 

When the food came out we were quick to realize that something was lost in translation and we received pork of some kind, but definitely not kalua. Time was tight and we decided to roll with the error and when all was said and done it was a-ok. The chicken on the other hand looked like it had been run over by a truck. In fact it didn't look like chicken at all but rather a piece of county ham. This plate was the weakest of the bunch and thank goodness the mac salad and musubi reeled me back in a bit.

This is a side keep in mind! Nonetheless I pay it because it is really good (totally recommend). Lastly I get their spam musabi this is the average going price of $2.50 I believe.

Located off 215 and Decatur, on the opposite end of the parking lot of Walmart is a decent size Lulu Hawaiian BBQ place.  The place did have a lot of parking, of course being across the street of a Walmart parking lot, you can basically park where you want.  It is a clean restaurant, a bit confusing at first but we were sat at the booth.  You can also order to go if you like.  They even have catering options as well.  

The food selection is good, the food itself is decent.  Doesn't really remind me of Hawaii, but its close enough.  I did like the egg, rice and spam, which I really like.  The wife got the loco moco, which didn't really taste the same in Hawaii, but it was edible.  I had a few bites and it wasn't that bad.  

The service seems to be on the quiet side.  They did say hello, but after that, the only thing next was ""May I take your order?""  Its not rude in a sense, but kind of lacks that service feel.  Especially if we're the only people in the restaurant.

Delivery costs $2.00 and the food typically arrives within 30 minutes. Out of the few times we ordered from Lulu, the food has never arrived hot, but warm. 

On two separate occasions, I've ordered two different meals.

Chicken Katsu Curry (no rice, just mac): Portions are huge! There were plenty strips of breaded and deep fried chicken that were crammed into one takeout container. Some chicken strips were tender and some were a little tough to chew. Because I opted for no rice and chose to keep the mac salad, I received a separate container filled with mac salad rather than a small scoop.

Seafood Platter: Comes with breaded and fried shrimp, mahi mahi, and scallops, except I didn't receive any scallops. The shrimp looked very well-done; its color reminded me of deep fried onion rings. Even though it looked cooked, the inside wasn't. I still got a taste of raw batter. The two pieces of mahi mahi were the frozen variety found in the freezer section of a grocery store. They were pallid and appeared they had been warmed up rather than fried.

4014517,2015-09-25,4,f9cIbhLyBz_qTEfMLfwrrQ,"I'll give it a solid 3 1/2 stars.  Not bad for non-Hawaiians!

Was itching for some local food that day & wifey said that L&L wasn't going to cut it.  And Aloha Specialties at The Cal was just too far away...plus we were hungry.  That's how we ended up at Lulu Hawaiian BBQ!

I've never been here before so I was of course skeptical.  Walk inside and whaddaya know?!  Chinese owners!!  Are we back at an L&L clone?  Now I was super skeptical.  Not that you Chinese folks don't know how to run a restaurant (though many of you have had your Chinese restaurants featured on Channel 13's 'Dirty Dining' segment, shame shame) but man, why can't there actually be more local Hawaii people running a Hawaiian BBQ joint?  It just makes no sense to me!  And the ones that do, are the best ones!

Lulu Hawaiian BBQ overall is average, edible for the most part.  The ordering scheme and menu is similar to that of L&L and Ohana Hawaiian BBQ here in Las Vegas.  Hawaiian 'local' food in mini or regular size plates.  On this day I was craving a best-seller back on the Islands...Chicken Katsu.

The little one and I both ordered regular size Chicken Katsu plates.  Wifey ordered one of their daily specials, the Sweet Chili Chicken plate.  Our orders were out within 10 minutes, so at least the service there is fast.  But taste, oh taste, that is another thing!

Serving sizes for regular plate lunches were on par with other establishments.  Meaning for a Hawaiian BBQ, it was a lot!  Two full scoops of steamed white rice on each plate, a bunch of chicken pieces on each too, and a big scoop of macaroni salad on the side in a separate container (nice touch to avoid it from getting warm).  Our Chicken Katsu plates also had a side container of katsu 'sauce' (I say this loosely).

But the taste of the Chicken Katsu just wasn't there!  Lots of pieces of chicken but no flavor in them!  They were fried just right too, golden brown.  But were virtually tasteless.  No salt, no MSG before or after frying?  Even with the katsu 'sauce'...which come on, is basically ketchup mixed with Worscestershire sauce, sugar, and maybe some applesauce at this place...was not helping.  A real katsu sauce is fruit based and complements the fried food!  Lulu Hawaiian BBQ had a WEAK sauce, not my favorite.  This is why most times when I go to a Hawaiian BBQ place here, I often bring my own (yes) katsu sauce in a bottle.  You'll be amazed what a katsu sauce like Bulldog or even Kikkoman's can do for your chicken katsu!  Sooooo much better!

The Sweet Chili Chicken plate was not a favorite of the wifey either.  It was basically fried chicken pieces covered in bottled sweet chili sauce.  It was too sweet, and again, chicken wasn't seasoned properly!  Guys, please salt & pepper your chicken before cooking!  World of difference.  Wifey really couldn't finish all of her plate lunch.

For me the best part of the meal was the all-important macaroni salad.  At least Lulu Hawaiian BBQ got this mostly right.  Macaroni was cooked well, still cold, was creamy enough (without being too heavy), and had the right component of just some shredded carrot in it.  But...light on the seasoning!  Not enough salt.  After adding some of my own is came out just right.  Then I went and did my thing and added a healthy dose of cracked black pepper, a dash of soy sauce, and a little splash of Tabasco!  Oh yeah, eat that sucker up!

And what is with these Hawaiian BBQ places adding BOBA on the menu?  Is this your Chinese kicking in?  It's just so strange, keep it simple and offer Hawaiian Sun drinks!  Although we did give in and got a mango boba for the little one, a bit pricey at like $3.50 a cup.  But, it wasn't bad, the boba was actually made right.

Value was decent for a Hawaiian BBQ joint, I may be back to Lulu for Chicken Katsu again one day when we are on that side of town again.  But from now on, I will bring my own katsu sauce!

I'm not a fan of Mac Salad so I won't give an opinion on that....

The dumplings were umm GROSS is the word. The breading was just too much and it wasn't even cooked all the way. The inside meat was tastless - yeah that was not good. We sent it back and they gave us Fried wontons with a ground chicken filling. The fried wontons tasted better but still rather bland to me.

My friend ordered the Spam, eggs and rice plate. She liked her food but we both agreed that it's hard to mess up anything on that plate. Thank goodness Spam is full of flavor on it's own.

The Malasadas were OK - weird aftertaste after eating the second one though.

The spicy chicken looked good in the picture on the wall and speaking of walls the hibiscus painting on the walls were cute but all in all I just don't think I'll have any desire to come back - L & L is just closer and tastier!!!",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,1,1,2,kpgHDuYODGvsmHeYQtEhww

This was my first time here for lunch.  We walked up to the counter.  The cashier handed us menus.  We stood there a while looking at the pictures on the menus.  The cashier said we could go sit down and she would take our order.  This was fine since we were the only ones there.

The difference between the mini plate and the regular plate was a scoop of rice.  Their menu prices need to be updated and they need a website.

The server/cashier came to the table to take our order.  We ordered the mini Garlic Shrimp plate, mini Kalbi plate, a side of egg rolls, spam musubi, Thai BobaTea, and Taro Boba Smoothie.

The Taro Smoothie came out of a machine, like the kind for a Slurpee at a 7-11.  The warm boba melted some of the smoothie.

The entrees came in To Go styrofoam boxes with plastic utencils.  I don't enjoy eating food in a restaurant out of styrofoam boxes

The Spam Musubi was the best part of the meal.  The spam was well seasoned and the rice was still warm.

My friend ordered the mini Garlic Shrimp plate.  There were 4 shrimp on a bed of lettuce with a scoop of rice and macaroni salad.  She said it was okay.

My 2 pieces of kalbi was tough and very fatty.  It was difficult to cut it with a plastic knife and to keep it from cutting the styrofoam box.

I saw a picture of Malasadas on their board.  It showed a big clump of sugar on top rather than being rolled in granulated sugar.

We took a hiatus from this place after what seemed to be new management then decided to eat here after a Costco trip. The chicken katsu was good, typically. However. The menu at the time said fried mahimahi, and it wasn't mahimahi. I had to ask what kind of fish it was in which they told me it was Swai. Sorry, that fish tasted like it was defrosted then frozen then defrosted. I'm not a big fan of Swai to begin with, so I was turned off. I couldn't even finish my food. 

I started picking off my son's food in which he had the bbq beef/Teri beef. The beef was way too tough considering these are just thin slices. Flavor was all right. Also, on another trip they were offerinf this lunch special, think it was called Sweet Chili chicken, for 5.95 or something like that...it had a really weird flavor to it. The flavor was reminiscent of drinking water from a hose. There was this weird metal, tap water flavor that wouldn't go away after each bite. It looked good, the price being cheap, made it look good to try. Wouldnt order that again. 

Overall, they don't have anything on their menu that would make me say, hey...Lulu's tonight? It'd probably be the spot to-go to save a drive, and if all the kids are desperately and annoyingly hungry for Hawaiian food. Good thing they know how to hold their stomachs.

It was the thinnest piece of chicken I have ever seen for katsu.  It was tough, over cooked and it hardly had any chicken.  It was a lot of breading and a thin piece of chicken thigh deep fried.

I am sure the owner won't like this review, but this place has to do better.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,4,0,2,hHIOAGJcWfpivgWzMfv6wQ

The only thing I didn't care for was the macaroni salad, unfortunately; it just tasted of mayonnaise solely. They have great prices on their Lilikoi Passion Fruit drinks as well, a favorite of mine that is generally very expensive per can.",iz2ZzPzXyPfyYCBIveYnZA,0,0,5,oWE44quGN2sMPXDo3enYZQ
