I got their 'OG' poke bowl which is a basic tuna, rice, and seaweed salad bowl with some ponzu. It was $12, and my fish had a ton of bones in it and was drowned in so much soy sauce I could have been eating tofu and not known the difference. 

Overall I'm pretty bummed that I spent $12 on what was mostly just a lot of rice swimming in sauce. I might go back and try their acai bowls, but definitely don't order their poke.",wkKnzTG93gutdDWJpjwDQQ,0,0,2,sSF_wIFHgmyzJF957LyNeg

The second time, I called ahead to see if they could start making my order because I was running late, and they didn't start it until I got there. It's not like other poke restaurants where everything is out for you to pick and for them to just scoop. Everything is frozen or prepackaged or something, and they sit there slowly unwrapping it all. However, I got an OG this time and it hit the spot. So, about a week later, I got another one. I paid $13 to take a bite and have the grossest flavor ever in my mouth. The fish was bad and I couldn't eat it. I'm not sensitive to those things at all and eat sushi all the time, by the way.

1617465,2016-06-30,9,1diuAK7FMn93WxlK-ndJhA,"This spot was formerly Bowl of Heaven, and in it's current incarnation has the same interior decor and a similar menu- with the addition of poke bowls, which I have not yet tried. Business caters to the surrounding UNLV students, offering a student discount and keeping a current summer hour schedule (M-F closing at 4PM, closed weekends) that makes it difficult for anyone else to patronise the business. 

The Ocean bowl was just alright- in the future I'll probably stick to the Hula bowl, which is more of a classic version with strawberries, bananas, and coconut on top. The Chocolate Dream was not my thing at all, berries + chocolate = no me gusta, also very heavy on the granola for some reason. 

 Service leaves something to be desired. Came by at 3:30 on a weekday, half an hour prior to close, and the chairs were already up so dining in wasn't even an option. Staff said the bare minimum for my transaction, could be friendlier. 

TIP: Go big or go home. Spring for the $10 large bowl, the regular barely had any acai once they put in the granola on bottom and fruit on top!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,18,3,W9lBQs3l3mvSQpsa0M7cmg

Not as demented as it sounds since they have a poke bowl menu. I went with the Wicked Tuna Signature bowl ($11) with ahi tuna, cabbage slaw, ginger, edamame, cucumber (lots and lots of cucumber), and togarashi sauce. I got it with a base of brown rice (lots and lots of brown rice). While the tuna tasted fresh, I felt it was way too heavy on the sauce. And the rice/cucumber to protein ratio was way too heavy on the rice/cucumber. It is a pretty small restaurant. So when they turn on the blender to make someone else a smoothie, conversation in the whole restaurant has to stop (and that blender is going often during lunch hour).

2018424,2016-11-12,0,1diuAK7FMn93WxlK-ndJhA,"I have been coming to this place since they opened it, and to be honest I love the açai bowls, and they have this rewards program that after 10 you get one free. All ingredients are fresh and all of the bowls taste delicious :D I really crave them for long, since my schedule doesn't always match their hours, :( that's not the reason they got 2 stars. The first disappointment was a day a couple of months ago that was closed 2 hours before the closing time with no sign of closed for... or we will be closed. So I thought ok probably I just didn't got the memo. But apparently they function like that however the fuck they want without warning. I have never had the greatest customer service which is okay with me I don't mind, people don't have to smile to me all the time. So with all that said I went in today for my addiction; ordered my PB lover açai bowl, a smoothie for my hubby and two up stream poké bowls.
1st issue: They didn't had salmon. But in my mind I was ok no biggie let's do it with tuna but the same ingredients on that dish. Ok problem solved, the girls told me my total; forty something with cents. I remember my change was supposed to be 8 dlls with change. And I try to pay with a 50 dollar bill.
2nd issue: Oh we don't accept any bill larger than 20 (WTF?). I thought I would make sense if I wanted to pay a piece of gum with a 50 dollar bill, yeah sure doesn't make sense. but I said -well you only have to give me 8.something for change so... and she called another girl (which by the way they were going to close in like an hour and a half and they had like 5 girls there, and still took forever to give me my one drink and bowl, I know spoiler) -to tell me that it is their policy and they cannot have a 50 dollar bill in their register, to what I ask - where does it said that? (because of course how am I gonna know all the policies in all the local places I go without a written warning or note ;p) and she answers - oh nowhere but they are very strict with that policy and they told us... I just had a $20 and a $10 in my wallet. I mean what type of business doesn't want money??
3rd issue: They didn't solve their problem. Instead I got asked to go change the bill to the business next door, that guess what? they sell poké bowls too, and took my 50dollar bill. There they literally send a customer to another business, unless they're affiliated which I don't think so.. 
It's a depressing review because I was (probably still am) in love with this place, but it keeps hurting me and taking me for granted:'(, it forces me to learn to live without it, or look for something else.",jk6QvlA1oppyAP8YdhzSxw,2,0,1,_Nyy9ZjxpbX6ZBNUyzVOSA

Next time I'll get the kids size because they really filled the regular size up and it was almost too much to finish.

2547321,2017-04-06,2,1diuAK7FMn93WxlK-ndJhA,"On their 'contact us' part of the website this is what I said, I think it gives good insight to my experience:

I'm quite upset after my latest experience at bowlology. I had been previously told by several employees at several different locations that the chocolate chips were vegan. On the morning of April 6, 2017, I decided to switch things up from my normal order of the PB lover no honey, no bee pollen. I asked for the chocolate dream and to confirm once again that the chocolate chips were vegan. The employee then went to the back to double check. I greatly appreciated this as a strict ethical and health conscious vegan. However, I am upset that this whole time I had been consuming these chocolate chips without the knowledge that they contained milk. I then asked the employee if I could submit a request for you guys to offer a vegan chocolate chip and she said, ""I don't know, we can tell corporate but it's just hard because vegan stuff usually doesn't taste good."" You can imagine by taken back by this, my jaw dropped and I was left in awe. How is it that at a supposedly ""healthy kitchen & juice bar"" your employees, a. Don't know which products are okay for customers with special dietary restrictions and b. Have the audacity to say vegan things don't taste good... it is crucial that in a supposedly healthy establishment you have educated, charismatic, and helpful employees. After my experience talking to this lady, I felt uncared for and not like a valued customer whose needs had been fulfilled. I hope the ""corporate"" team is able to do something about the discrepancy with the lack of vegan chocolate chips as well as the poor customer service.

Thank you",EPiN5n0GcJTzUMTixFIZEQ,0,0,2,q17AfWKkx5p-Mvi1oZlmUA

Slightly pricey but I am willing to pay for it since you know you're getting good quality fresh fruit.

According to my young & adorable friend this place is very popular with her sorority sisters. In the spirit of sorority girls everywhere (too old to have that experience lolol) we both got acai bowls!

My friend got the Hula bowl & I got the Chocolate Dream both in regular size. The serving size is huge & costs about 8 bucks. They were both more or less the same just that hers had coconut sprinkles on top & mine had chocolate chips. Each bowl was filled with delicious strawberries, bananas, granola, & of course the acai base. I couldn't finish the entire thing because it was so much sweetness but overall I thought it hit the spot, especially since I lugged all of my books across the street from UNLV to get here & it was a pretty hot day. Perfect dessert spot for someone who's looking for a slightly healthier dessert choice. It seems like they serve food here as well. They do have an easily accessible parking lot in your typical Vegas style mini mall. Poke shop, tacos, & other restaurants near by if you want more dinner type foods first. 

I will say that if you want to chat with your friends, don't come here on a busy day or take your bowl to go because we couldn't hear each other talking while they were blending them.

This is my second time coming to a Bowlology in a different location and the quality was consistent. Last time, I got the Rise and Shine and this time I got the Ocean. I personally feel not much of a difference between the two bowls. 

I always get the Pitaya here, which is dragon fruit compared to the açaí, and I like this because it's less sweet. The regular topping comes with a generous portion of granola, which I personally don't like so I now ask for less granola. I also don't feel the honey adds much other than extra sweetness which I feel that the bowl doesn't need. 

Overall, I like the blended fruit portion of the bowl, but I would suggest switching up the toppings and adding more variety. I would love to see toppings like mango, raspberries, and peaches. I also think it would be yummy to have soaked chia seeds incorporated into the bowls. 

For the quality and what you get, I do feel that this place it a bit overpriced since a small is roughly $9 before tax and $12 for a large but I would definitely come back here if I'm in the mood for a relatively healthy treat.",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,3,1,4,tPyUsnOeScESdHQMiQn5oA

Acari bowls here were nothing special. I have tried a few of the acai bowls, the Ocean and PB lover to name some, and nothing really stood out. The acai bowls were very watered down and bland. I also expected a lot more acai/pitaya. Most of my bowls were packed with granola. Not to mention that there is not much consistency and I finished my acai bowls very disappointed.

Service is lacking, as well. Employees did not seem like they wanted to be there at all and were quite rude to me and many customers I witnessed ordering. Very big turn off.

Will maybe come back to give this place another shot if I am in the area. Maybe I will try a poke bowl. Hopefully by then their customer service and food quality would have gone up.",Nv3PWqYZ47GQuG0p8u4uQg,3,0,2,jjvLPbgqswyjzewNrLquMg

I stood there for a little, looking at the menu, and she just stood there looking at me. Lol. I felt so awkward. Anyways, I felt so awkward standing there so I just asked her if they had a plain acai bowl. She told me about the makai bowl, so I decided to go with that. She explained that it was a couple scoops of acai. Got my acai bowl not even 5 minutes later and was so impressed because it came so fast but also thought it was weird... I didn't even hear any blender go off. 

So I tried this acai bowl and goodness. I wanted to just throw it away. When she said scoops of acai, I didn't think she meant they just plopped frozen shiz in a cup and put a couple of toppings in there. I do appreciate the unfrozen fruits. I also appreciate that she asked me if I was a student & got a discount. What irks me about that tho is that their bowls are fricken expensive. $7 something (with discount, so technically more) for a not so great acai bowl.

PB Lover:
I have a go-to Acai bowl in places that serve Acai bowls: Acai bowl with peanut butter. So, I tried their PB Lover. It has Acai, chocolate mylk, peanut butter, strawberries, banana, honey and chocolate chips. It was pretty similar to BOH's PB bowl but with the addition of chocolate chips on top. I asked for 22g of protein to be added to my Acai bowl and I was told they only have 11g. Seriously? So, if I wanted to pay extra, I still can't get another 11g? 4/5 for the Acai bowl; 1/5 for the lack of logic/math skills.
