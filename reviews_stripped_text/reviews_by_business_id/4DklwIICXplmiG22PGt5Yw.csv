Even the review that is posted on the wall in the restaurant says at the bottom ""nothing really great"". The small portions are a direct relation to the reason the prices are low. It's like ordering kiddie meals.

The reason they even get one star is because the owner is very friendly, but she needs to know that her brother cannot cook and he needs to find another gig. 

I ordered the Penang curry and spring rolls to go. The rice paper of the spring rolls was not closed correctly and it came apart as I was picking it up (see photo). The Penang was tasteless and watery. all the four small bite sized chicken pieces were bland and felt like they were thrown in there at the very end.

I cannot fathom how people can give this restaurant anything more than a 1 star. I know the owner is nice, but this is a restaurant, and quality of food is what i'm rating.",yVmLZ8fBqo9vAnoj5I9mfw,2,1,1,0sQT37cgU2LUp0HNqrYpkA

Sabi's kitchen is a thai restaurant that has just recently opened that was opened by Sabi and her brothers. They are still fixing the place up , so it's not all fancy - but it doesn't need to be. 

Walking in, it was very small. Only a couple tables, and a room on the side which looked like it had a couple of couches in it. 

It was pretty damn good. I had the pad see ewe. It was a little on the sweeter side for me, but I still finished the whole plate. It was well seasoned and the beef wasn't tough. Vegetables were cooked good, the noodles were fantastic. 

My friend ordered the panang curry, which also did not disappoint. It had a good spice to it, and did not skimp on the chicken. 

As for the prices, it was very cheap. It was good food for the value. The customer service was also pretty good. Sabi was very friendly, and ensured us that everything she serves there was made in house and also that all their ingredients are fresh. I'm happy that this place is so close to my place. I will for sure be back. 

They did mention to us that they are having a tasting event soon, and I will probably post it as an event once more details are received.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,1,0,4,Pco0Liz6EHAULre2YH9L4w

The curry is the best I've ever had.  We ordered five different dishes and they were all very, very good which surprises me because usually not all of the the food is good at other places. Sabi took our order. She was very nice. The place is very small but cute and clean which is very important to me. You can tell that they have great pride in what they do. Thank you Sabi for making our trip to Vegas a nice one.",kCilWIoGpEWMOjZlBJbwTA,2,1,5,A7tOmzaAqO037TsPOI2Mbg

The owner Sabi came and took our order and was very pleasant to talk with. The food was made fresh and when they brought out eggrolls instead of the dumplings we had ordered, we told it was no big deal that we would eat the eggrolls. She ended up making us the dumplings and bringing those out for free! The cost was good, considering it's close proximity to the strip. Yay finally a cheap place for lunch!",GfwHukEfGxfBGQfmGQIiCw,1,0,4,ltxMZipOV7fnfw0NTDyupA
3483227,2012-09-20,2,4DklwIICXplmiG22PGt5Yw,"I read the review about this place from fellow Yelper Joel M. and thought I would give this place a try.  We ordered pad Thai ($5.99), Thai fried rice ($5.99) and the red curry chicken ($5.99) to go. The fried rice and the red curry chicken were quite tasty but the pad Thai lacked flavour and it was all clumped together.  Not sure why this was, could it be that there wasn't enough oil in it (I asked for less oil) or was it missing some sort of sauce?  I don't usually order pad Thai so I am not sure what was missing in it.  The lady was nice enough to give us some free spring rolls to go and Thai tea to drink while we were waiting for our orders.  

Although the portions were a bit on the small side, nothing really to complain about because their prices are pretty darn cheap.  I think this place probably gets most of their business from its surrounding industrial community during lunch time.  I was told their grand opening is on Oct. 5 and they will be BBQ-ing outside of their restaurant from 6 pm to 10 pm.  You can drop by and sample their food at that time.  Go ahead and check this place out if you are in the neightbourhood.  

3.5 stars from me.",cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,3,4,3,JoARJ3EvHnQppIJfqVER1Q

4547865,2012-05-27,0,4DklwIICXplmiG22PGt5Yw,"Awesome food, awesome service and LOW PRICES.  So far the best panang curry I have had in Las Vegas. Thai food you would cook for yourself if you were a bomb Thai food chef.  The mint chicken, pad thai, fried rice, chicken satay and garlic chicken were great too. It was nice to be served by the owner who also had a hand in making the food. I was also told that they will be getting a delivery driver next month. 

IF YOU ARE GOING HERE... the building is on Arville, but the restaurant ENTRANCE IS OFF HACIENDA with its own driveway and parking.",0Jh-fguxui34YLu1mwpJow,2,2,5,eA1kHNDjXydrHd3CnzavUQ

Every time we go in she is working on something new and homemade and gives us a free taste of her new dishes.  She was working on some home made ice cream last time we went. SOOO GOOOD and a really cozy place to eat in.",6_uj2MDVazz4pedsEgfMdQ,0,0,5,tnCX_nyjjCm4enDApFZpfw

5834121,2012-08-03,6,4DklwIICXplmiG22PGt5Yw,"Talk about a small place with big thai flavors, this is where you want to be for thai food. The owner, Sabi, is very nice and friendly and keeps her kitchen clean. Sabi dishes out some of the best thai food in Las Vegas. Prices are low & very affordable by anyone. Serivce is very good and fast. I am a chicken pad thai fanatic and a pineapple fried rice guy. So, I chose those items to eat. 

The pineapple fried rice was delicious and seasoned well. Rice was not mushy, had the right amount of curry and all the ingredients mixed well. The chicken pad thai is my favorite thai dish and Sabi sure knows how to cook it right to satisfy my taste buds. Not salty and seansoned to perfection with a little sweetness and the right amount of spicyness. Food tasted great and fresh. Winning!

Okay, make sure you don't pass this place up. If you are near Arville and Hacienda or not near, stop by for a legit Thai food experience presented by Sabi.",29DWe8SD_RCeZ_A6ihxnhQ,11,9,4,wv-YLoSGXNqAkwkN6H0Csg
