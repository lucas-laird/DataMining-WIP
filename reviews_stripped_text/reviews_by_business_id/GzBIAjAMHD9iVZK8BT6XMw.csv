Being ravenously hungry, I went back for seconds and got a steak taco and added rice, cheese, Pico de Gallo and topped it with an over easy egg topped with Green Ajo sauce.

It was my first time in Vegas. AWESOME SAUCE! As we roamed the city, there came a point where we needed food. Turns out you can't just live and thrive off booze. One night I was just going to be content with going through a drive thru at Burger King but my friend insisted on no. 

Him - ""why would we eat the same ol stuff we can get at home? What's the point of that?!""
Me - ""I just wanted to coat my stomach some more.""
Him - jumps on Yelp

Best decision EVER! This place has hands down some of THE BEST tacos I've ever had! The chef and the other gentleman who I assume was the owner were both super friendly. There were so many options to pick from as far as what to put on your taco - tons of salsas, veggies, egg or fried cheese. All the ingredients are fresh and cooked right in front of you. 

I had a chicken taco with onion, cilantro, an egg, guacamole and fried cheese. Amazing! And even though we were the last customers of the night, they didn't try to rush us and made sure to check on us. I so wish they were closer to Chicago!",9jPLe2Rn7D37Z7AvmNgMmQ,4,7,5,PqGtUnvLONfX-CsHUct0cA

This place literally put the most love into my slow roasted pork tacos.  They scrambled eggs to add, grilled cheese on a plancha to add (OMG!) and had beautiful home made salsas.  The owner(?) took his time explaining and talking with us about them and they were a work of art.  I would venture to say that these were the best tacos I've ever had.

1694628,2018-03-14,2,GzBIAjAMHD9iVZK8BT6XMw,"I'm a quasi-fan. Love me some tacos, burritos, bowls, and really all the things. Flavors here generally on point, ingredients are consistently fresh, and serving size is--again for the most part--generous. Nice fresh melted cheese, crispy tortillas heated on the grill, and organic soda options. Yeehaw!  

Still, Tacos Huevos has some improvements to make if it wants to transcend beyond this perfectly average vote of mediocrity. Its shortcomings are also consistent, from the first time I went shortly after they opened, to today, some months since that first experience. They include these two pressing points:

-- Confused waitstaff, and inhospitable priorities. Today there were something like 4-6 people in for lunch, my group included. Somewhere between their order and mine and the folks behind me, a called-in order was placed. All staff began processing this order while those of us who were physically present, in the restaurant, stood there watching this dance with no one acknowledging us, let alone taking our orders. And no one seems to have a fixed position; it's just a free-for-all with staff jumping from grill to line to register and back again. No wonder they're confused about whose orders were taken, and not. Looking at previous reviews, this has been a problem since at least October of last year. May be time to rethink things, have a staff meeting?
5-10 minutes passed before the owner glanced up and inquired. Meanwhile, my friends were halfway through their meal. Things were not so busy that your present customers should be ignored for this long, and not after months of time to iron out kinks in the system. 

-- Pricing. On the average, especially with the typical serving size, prices are fair. There are a few shock points, though, so beware. Mine came after ordering a chicken quesadilla, a bargain at $5.75, but was rung up at nearly $9. Why? The added tiny-tup of guacamole, maybe 1.5-tablespoons worth, was $1.95. Outrageous. 
Forget gold bullion, put your money in guacamole. 

A friend wanted iced tea, but they had run out. No effort was made to fix this. Maybe later? It's iced tea. And there's no one here. Come on. 

So yeah, decent food, but the weird pricings and constantly confused staff always leave me wanting. Wanting better. And by better, I mean average customer service. For less.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,7,3,3,PbVTTXWUt8fsTd3zpDaQoQ

Came here for breakfast because I was looking for something new to try comma was pleased to find that it was in the space where the old downtown Crown & Anchor was(which honestly didn't fit the vibe of the arts district). 

I love that they are a farm-to-table taco place that serves everything with a choice of an egg. It was a tiny bit hard to order but I'm sure they will work out the menu and ordering issues and have a full staff as we were there very early in the morning. I got two different tacos, chicken and pork,  a side of fried rice and beans, with an egg on top. Taco's were amazing,  and they make their own tortillas! the egg was cooked perfectly. And I mean perfectly . That's super important.  The star Of the meal was the house sauce.  A creamy green sauce.  Good on everything!! They have awesome sodas organic sodas and Stellar ambience. I highly recommend and I really hope this place sticks around",qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg,2,0,5,hBa3HhYMwFm2Eh15JGOAbQ

We just happened upon this incredibly inviting little restaurant. We were greeted by the owner. He gave us the history of his restaurant and made me one awesome taco salad. They were doing an art event in front of their space that night and it drew an eclectic yet inviting crowd. It was awesome be in such an inclusive vibe. The food had great flavor and was awesome quality. Give them a try!,RYOrHOoiQMEpba-ruXGSwQ,0,0,5,geywtDnMgGjxXwdP2uy46Q

However, if you find it then you've found what might be the best burritos in Vegas (and that's hard to do). I'm not a big egg guy so I didn't add some of their namesake to the dish, but I did get a big slab of melted and slightly browned cheese, which was incredible to say the least. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful with this initially somewhat confusing setup, but it's worth every second and every penny. The prices were actually pretty good, especially considering how much you get there, and the restaurant was very clean. The decor is a little eclectic, pulling some of it's style from the clubs around it. This was probably the hardest thing to leave behind in Vegas; to me and my food passion it was just as memorable as The Strip.",GgoJmc-X9hwte8tc9X6C2w,2,0,5,oy0_OGH7QSjntM-to_L5sQ

Eggs in the name means breakfast is available all day- my pick is the scrambled egg tacos with potatoes and bacon or sausage, but whatever you get, add melted cheese on top and a side of their green ajo sauce (creamy avocado). The tortillas are freshly made for that extra touch of awesome. It's a great way to start my day! Bonus points for having vegan and vegetarian options.

That said, staff are friendly but ordering system is disorganized- it's a cafeteria style made-to-order line but it's unclear who takes the order, makes the order, and rings it up, as staff are constantly moving between roles leading to forgotten items and payment delays.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,16,4,vBPwlwjMc--Byt2zUKnWNQ

We had the vegetarian burrito. I highly recommend getting an over easy egg inside. They even grilled the shredded cheese before putting it into the burrito and the crispiness that this created along with the grilled golden flavor gave the burrito a very unique flavor. I would highly recommend the organic soda, the cherry creme soda was our favorite. Fresh, flavorful, and filling! Definitely discovered a new favorite place to visit when in Vegas and already craving the burrito!  Extremely kid friendly as well.

When you're on a budget in Vegas, it's hard to find food places with large enough portions while maintaining that budget. Moreover, it's even harder to find food that tastes edible. Tacos Huevos is your gleam of hope off the strip. My $7.75 chicken burrito is enough to fill up the most avid eaters

The food is pretty spectacular for its price. As the name suggests, basic orders of tacos, burritos, bowls and the such come with eggs. This, along with their melted cheese and homemade tortillas made my meal spectacular. 

The interior is also a welcome surprise compared to the rather rundown area around the restaurant. Definitely a trendy stop that had care into its design.",KpV_19ifP7X15s4IK47x1w,0,0,5,8ZqRnzk60U_3me7akHnO1w

I am not sure what the hype is about because it's definitely A-OK. I ordered a rotisserie taco and slow cooked & smoked pork taco; both had cilantro, onions, mild salsa, and some sorta of cheese.

The only pro was that they were generous with the amount of meat so I was full with 2 tacos.

SERVICE
It was empty on a Saturday afternoon, so I didn't have to wait to order. The same girl who took and made my order also checked me out at the register. She was nice, made suggestions, and tried to engage in a convo so I appreciate it.

4186626,2018-01-26,0,GzBIAjAMHD9iVZK8BT6XMw,"I loved the concept here. Loved the interior as well. Place has a really good vibe. 

We ordered 3 street tacos, two chicken and one pork. They made the tortillas right then when we ordered. That was fun to watch, as there is a window into the kitchen. Then there is the toppings station where you can opt for different things such as cheese, sour cream, etc. We chose for the original street taco toppings of onion, cilantro and salsa. I chose the medium, green salsa. 

It is cafeteria style in a sense, as you take your tray of food down the line, and then over to the register right behind you. There are some really great looking organic sodas such as blood orange, ginger beer, cherry cream and others. We opted for the regular selection of sodas this time. Not feeling adventurous, I guess. 

I was really excited to try my chicken taco as I was told that it was made with rotisserie chicken. The tortillas were sturdy and tasty, and filled with a lot of ingredients. Although very moist, the chicken was extremely bland. All of the flavor came from the toppings and the tortilla. My husband had the pork taco and said that it was really flavorful. I might try that next time. The medium salsa was actually on the spicy side. Lots of flavor. We got the chips and salsa as well, and opted for medium and hot as our two choices of salsa. The hot was definitely made with habaneros, and was hot. Both were very fresh and had good flavor. 

I really like this taco place, and would love to come back for more. Really good value here, as everything is FRESH. Everyone working there was pleasant as well. The place was clean, so all in all this was a nice find.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,7,3,4,LMkFWQ3TTtiqlqmL4PeXlw

5186775,2017-12-22,1,GzBIAjAMHD9iVZK8BT6XMw,"OMG!!! All the other Yelp reviews are correct...THIS PLACE IS BOMB!!! I took my son to TH for lunch and we each had the pork tacos. Holy crap. The pork is so juicy and tender I thought I'd died and gone to pork heaven. The melted cheese was incredible and the other toppings delicious. The Ajo Sauce is great...not spicy, but so flavorful. Next time I'll get some of the hot salsa on the side to kick up the heat.

There are two types of both rice and beans. I chose the traditional Spanish-style rice and the refried pinto beans. My son got the black beans. All were really good. Next time I'll see about some chips and salsa to put a bow on the meal.

The Tractor Sodas are great. We don't typically drink soda, but these were worth the caloric splurge.

All in all, we LOVED this place! Plenty of convenient parking in the lot next door (by Artifice). Not hard to find at all. It's in the Arts Factory on Charleston and Main...East side, ground floor, enter from the courtyard. Great vibe. Excellent service! Amazeballs food!! And a cool, swanky atmosphere to boot.

5227977,2018-01-15,4,GzBIAjAMHD9iVZK8BT6XMw,"Tacos Huevos was recommended by Stefany V as a meetup spot for the first Yelp Book Club of the year.  While I was the only member in attendance on Saturday, I was far from disappointed.  

I don't come downtown too often...parking worries me.  I can never seem to find a spot to park that doesn't involve paying to park.  

Imagine my delight, then, when I arrived at Tacos Huevos, and found ample FREE parking!!!  

TH was super easy to find, and there is plenty of seating, both inside and out.

I walked in, and was greeted by Chris, who I found out is the owner.  He went over the menu with me, after discovering that it was my first time in.   

The set up is kind of a Chipotle/Subway style ""build your own"" spot, with a la carte options as well.  

Saturday, I opted for: 
a   slow cooked and smoked pork bowl, and 1 street taco:  steak.

The bowl comes with rice, beans, meat, and whatever toppings you want. 
I got mine with a scrambled egg, a ton of salsas and veggies, and a little sour cream.  

Let me say:  this was HUGE.  Like...I should have only ordered the bowl, because I was stuffed after eating the taco and a few bites of the bowl.  But I pushed through.   
The pork was super tender, flavorful, and amazing.  If you know me, you know I'm not usually a fan of pork, but for some reason, I just had to try this.  I'm really glad I did.  

I also had a steak taco, with onions, cilantro, and some melted cheese.  The cheese is totally worth the 35 cents extra.  SO delicious!!  The steak was good, nice and tender.  

I also had a margarita.  Because tequila.  It was also delicious!  

Chris showed me the selection of organic sodas they offer, and let me know that you can get a spiked soda with organic tequila, vodka, or...something else.  I tuned out at tequila.  Next time I go, I'm totally getting a spiked blood orange soda.  

Service was extremely friendly.  The food was phenomenal.  The place is clean, bright, and open.  Prices are totally reasonable, especially given the downtown location.  You most definitely get your money's worth here. 
They also offer vegan options, and desserts!

5279260,2018-02-13,12,GzBIAjAMHD9iVZK8BT6XMw,"Located in the suddenly rejuvenated Arts District and offering ""Unique Mexican quick serve Cuisine"" it was for Breakfast on Saturday that a visit was paid to Tacos Huevos on East Charleston, the spot originally noticed thanks to its raucous patio after a disastrous dinner at Mingo Kitchen empty save for one other couple at 9:30am.

Open for ""Breakfast, Brunch and Brinner"" per the website and luring in Instagrammers by way of Yassss Yolk Porn and Savage Cheese Pulls, the fenced-patio yielding entry to an L-shaped space with counter and kitchen to the right and a sort of Mexican Steampunk dining room to the left, it was while standing back assessing the situation that a pleasant Hispanic cook stood waiting and happy to answer questions, the menu admittedly a bit confusing to those who haven't previously examined it closely.

Suggested as an alternative to ""boring breakfasts and drunken Taco Bell drive throughs after a kick ass night in sin city"" as though this was some sort of challenge, the offerings in reality more akin to Chipotle with Tacos, Bowls, Burritos, Salads, Tostadas, or Nachos offered as a base to various Meats and Protein-substitutes plus unlimited ""healthy ingredients"" that make one question whether fresh = healthy in 2018, it was after a quick bit of mental math and judgment of the days plan that three Tacos, a Burrito plus one Dessert and Coffee were ordered at a total cost of $32.20 before tip. 

Requesting half of the order for dine-in and half packed to-go, though parts of each were tasted in the dining room while still hot, it was while Dessert was being prepared that Tacos topped with flavorless Rotisserie Chicken, Steak and smoked Pork were found to be largely indistinguishable from one another beneath melted Cheese and a fairly standard list of Toppings, the over-medium Egg served sloppily on the side really serving no purpose even though the website suggests ""eggs and tacos go together like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera""...which apparently means together but separate with the later prone to affairs?

At this point figuring it safe to further poke fun at the online hyperbole, the ""idea that subtle infusions in Mexican food can have a profound impact"" probably a bit high-brow for Quick Casual, it was turning attention to a forearm-size Burrito that the best of Tacos Huevos offerings was discovered, the chopped Sausage featuring a smooth grind and nicely matched to a fluffy Omelet, Cheese and Corn while a $9 ""Nutelladilla"" suggested for two or more was easily finished by one, the sweet Spread plus Butter and Cinnamon-Sugar becoming nice and crisp beneath Whipped Cream and a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.

**1/2:  Not particularly 'bad,' and certainly more fresh or unique than Rubio's, Baja Fresh or Chipotle, Tacos Huevos would be well served to know its role and focus on seasoning its Meats rather than coming up with odd hooks that likely won't do much but annoy ""discerning patrons.""",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,7,2,cNV2W38zo7UTgsnIduQXPA

The beans are great with a little cotija cheese sprinkled on them. The Mexican rice is very good too. The guacamole has a tiny bit of tomatoes so as not to ruin the fresh flavor of avocado. The tomatillo salsa is awesome an not too spicy. So so good. The chips are made in house too.

The other red salsa was a chunkier salsa with better flavor.

The meats are packed with flavor, everything is easy to customize and there is so much space. The patio is huge and fun to sip margaritas, and the inside is well air conditioned so you'll be set as things start to heat up. 

My favorites are the pork or breakfast burrito with bacon. You can add an egg to your burrito and I go for over medium. Whites cooked, yolks runny. The melted cheese option is amazing. 

I love this place but service is always slow. It's never quite busy enough to justify more staff but there isn't any rhyme or reason to how you order and then get rung up. It's still really confusing. 

Work in progress. But delicious and well on their way to a five star experience if they can work out some more ordering kinks.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,27,23,4,3RBnaTOrbSG_qlNql_QCNg

The service was slow it took about 20 minutes from start when I ordered my food to when I actually paid for my food.
I ordered the carne asada tacos meal with the rice and beans. 

The only thing lacking from this restaurant is a sense of urgency.",5bI67_CVxFy8PPL7E3BLqw,1,0,4,mNjIxe8XxycHR8CylUG2aQ

Chicken burrito and steak tacos with fried and scrambled eggs  added melted cheese and just about all the fixings for an excellent meal. Don't forget the house cilantro dressing Everything is fresh and flavorful right down to the organic tractor soda (cola with cinnamon and vanilla). The two guys inside were eager to help us out for us first time here which makes for an even better experience. Be sure to try the soda! We enjoyed our meal on the patio, see you again soon!",ce1uphSN7v_zNIF0Gxu_3g,1,1,5,IjAiZM3XxDoRbIV-rAYI2A
