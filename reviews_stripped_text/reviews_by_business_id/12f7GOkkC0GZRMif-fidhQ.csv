130179,2011-05-10,2,12f7GOkkC0GZRMif-fidhQ,Dead and should have closed wks ago. Our group of 8 thought it would be fun to eat at the Nascar Cafe. Because closure is only 5 days away they are out of everything. Two of us ordered $12.95 Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches but the meat was so salty we could not eat as they almost burned our mouth w/salt. When we complained the waitress brushed us off completely. I asked for the manager who said they did not add salt to anything and it must be their supplier. We were not offered any alternative. Flatly told us they would not make any adjustment at all in the bill. At $13 I could have had a nice lunch at many places. DON'T GO THERE!  P.S. 2 of our group were nauseous and 1 actually sick all night. Coincidence?,wef1zAZ4hEbhLIftQ5xqZg,0,0,1,X-rfWY2JP96qenE_SuzXEg

They've got Newcastle which was cool and the food is more than decent.  It's a bar, they're going out of business and it's the Sahara so why does everyone on here expect EXCELLENT food?!  Come on you've either never been to Vegas or you're just flat out ignorant.  The wait and bar staff are both very nice and didn't have a problem separating my checks for alcohol and food (I have to expense the food only).  A lot of people complain about the rules of the B3 Burrito but IT'S A COMPETITION EATING CHALLENGE!  You're not supposed to share it, Adam Richmond didn't pull that business...of course he didn't finish it but some people have!  If you can't man up and eat this massive burrito yourself, just order the 1 pounder bet you can't even finish that haha.  Saw another complaint about being forced to eat it at the bar, once again, it's an eating challenge it's meant to make a spectacle of whoever is eating it.  You really think you're going to eat a 6lb burrito quietly over in the corner in Vegas?  No sir.  Anyways, I stayed right at the Hilton GV for 25 days and I frequented this place because I knew they were shutting down along with Sahara soon so I wanted to get my time in, especially since it's so close.  Don't believe every review you see on here, check it out for yourself and get a Sahara cup to take home cuz on the 16th of May, you won't be able to do that any more.  Check out the BLT I loooved it!",-wQQ8qG9F-zwX5-941OwQA,0,0,4,keaI-UsERSmsXDR1yUiJVw
581573,2010-02-16,1,12f7GOkkC0GZRMif-fidhQ,"Oh boy. I cant say one good thing about this place. Thats really sad. The service was horrible. Is this one of those restaurants that encourages bad service? That sure is what it felt like.

We waited patiently for our table and were seated after 45 minutes. That was ok, as its not their fault that their were packed. But then, we sat there with no menus for 15 minutes. We tried to get the servers attention but they did a really good job of avoiding us. Servers were just walking around and werent really making themselves useful. Finally, my sisters boyfriend walked over to where the menus were and brought them to us himself. 

Ok, at this point we are a little irritated, but its nothing that can't be fixed with I dont know...an apology, acknowledgement of their crappy service, or good food. However, we got none of the above. Heck, we didnt ever get a smile.

We sat there for a total of 25 minutes before they decided to stop by our table to take our drink order. At that point we were also prepared to order our food. I tried ordering the 6lbs burrito which is what we came here to try. But, I was told it was for competition only and I couldnt order it unless I was competing. i asked if I could just pay the $20 for the burrito, but was told I couldnt. So, I ordered the small version of it. We ordered chili-cheese fries, jalapeno poppers, and the polish and italian dogs. I also ordered beer and birthday shots, but I never got the shots, which sucked because it was my birthday and our last opportunity to celebrate as a group in Vegas.

Anyway, the burrito was really gross, tasted really processed and just plain nasty. How can you screw up a burrito? No flavor at all except processed cheese...ugh! The fries were burned and the dogs were too. 

It was just a crappy experience over all.",XyvqSGddR1f7WUjF2hjWiQ,3,0,1,IHmoUOzf70JLn_x_peigUQ

The story: Darling is a huge NASCAR fan so we made the 3 mile hike to Sahara from Paris.  Showed up at 8pm on a Tuesday evening and the place was pretty empty.  First impressions were that everything is dirt cheap (Especially after Excalibur and Paris.)  I ordered the two hot dog entree with curly fries and chili for $8-9.  The fries came out naked but I mentioned it to the server and he promptly returned with two huge tubs of chili.  They were really good (both at the restaurant and as a cold midnight snack later) and very close to Jack in the Box curly fries.

I was unfortunately only able to finish 1 hotdog and a few of the giant mountain of fries (think McDonald's Super Size).  Our waitress was really warm and sweet.   She took the initiative to offer me a box and bag, lids for all my sauces/dressings/chili, and a set of plastic cutlery (probably realizing we were going home to a hotel room.)  And somehow she managed to do all of this without seeming pushy or tip-grubbing.  We felt really really taken care of and left the establishment in a great mood, which helped lead to an awesome Vegas night overall.",szrWOJgBJ6lFD5dH97eMIw,0,0,4,wUM-OefERexOjFNphXP8oA
1415261,2011-01-02,1,12f7GOkkC0GZRMif-fidhQ,"The Nascar Cafe delivers exactly what you would expect from such an establishment. We walked in and seated ourselves as there was no one at the front desk to help us. The hostess arrived eventually and explained to us that our waitress was on ""an errand"" and would be back in 10 or 15 minutes. As we waited with no service and not even a water, we took turns guessing where our dear waitress may have absconded to. Perhaps she was running off to buy cigarettes? Maybe a trip to pick up her child from daycare? Who knows what urgent errand could have been so pressing as to drag her away from her important job as a waitress at Nascar Cafe. 

Eventually another waitress came up to the table and introduced her sunny self with a ""Did you want to order something?"" How pleasant. We were charmed. Unfortunately we did order the 180 oz. Beer Tower. This took approximately 30 minutes to arrive at our table. However at 34$ it was a great deal and we were reasonably pleased with the new acquisition. However this pleasure was most assuredly derived from the thrill of waiting 45+ minutes and FINALLY having something show up at the table. I will say the Tower itself was grimy and looked as if it had never been washed. 

After about another 20 minutes of watching waitresses and staff members walk by our table, our waitress with the mysterious errand showed up. She was actually very sweet and a solid B+ server. Things had begun to turn around. We managed to corral her and place our order. Jalapeno Poppers were fresh-tasting, piping hot and exactly what you would expect. No complaints here. We polished them off with gusto. Of course at this point we were starving. The food eventually arrived about 30 minutes after the appetizer and it was nothing special. Not noticeably bad but nothing to write home about either. Clam Chowder was thick and tasty with almost no actual clams present. 1 lb. ""Baby B3"" was full of toppings but nothing you couldn't get at a standard Mexican place. Coleslaw was surprisingly tasty and crunchy with a nice amount of dressing. 

We were looking for a fun, kitschy theme-restaurant experience and got the worst version of this industry staple. We will never go here and again. It may be the absolute worst service for the least amount of pay off we have ever experienced.",8Wk2Yf9fC_hITZyBwEUZpg,1,0,1,TpfQQMpi42MUv6J4M-Dh7g

We went for lunch during a break between seminars at a convention and they service was abysmal.  The place was not very busy, but it took 5-10 minutes after being seated before a server showed up.  I got the fish and chips (they shouldn't call curly fries ""chips"") and the fish wasn't bad, actually it was pretty good (saved the review from a single star).  There was a mountain of curly fries that came along with it that I didn't feel I even put a dent in.  When we got the bill, our server disappeared for over 15 minutes, and we ended up tracking her down at the bar and asking if we could please pay so we could leave.  She then asked the bartender to take care of us and she went back to the kitchen.

Food was ok if you like a pound of curly fries served with everything. Mine was ok, ordered fish and chips but looked like the kind you buy at the frozen food section. But I was so hungry I ate them all. 
Prices seemed overly high considering the wait time and the quality. 
Also, had some crappy service from the nearby arcade people after buying some ride tickets for virtual nascar, had to get a refund after waiting an hour there.

1762912,2011-01-16,7,12f7GOkkC0GZRMif-fidhQ,"It's our first day in Las Vegas for my best friend's 21st birthday. We spent a solid five hours walking down the Strip, mingling with the crowd, and popping inside the casinos/bars. While walking to the Sahara we both felt that untimely rumble in our stomachs. It was that rumble that happens when you're about to die of hunger. While walking through the casino we stumbled upon the Nascar Cafe and I immediately remembered it from Man V. Food. Adam Richmond attempted the B3 (Big Badass Burrito) Challenge. It's a six pound, twenty-four inch burrito. When we walked inside we passed the window display that proudly presents the challenge in all of its glory.

We told our server that we both wanted to attempt the challenge. We then told him that we knew we weren't going to finish so we didn't want to make a big deal about it. He then told us ""We have to make a big deal."" Awesome. We were then escorted over to the ""Challenge area"" where two tables we waiting for us (one had a Man V. Food cover displaying the challenge).

After about ten minutes of waiting and sweating bullets, out of nowhere we were blind sided. We heard over the loud speaker the voice of our server. Great. ""Attention everyone! We have two men that are attempting the B3 Challenge. They have ninety minutes to finish a six pound, twenty-four inch burrito. It's made with four extra large tortillas, shredded beef, beans, rice, jalapenos, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, chives, olives, nacho cheese, and covered in an enchilada sauce."" Whoa whoa whoa! My friend and I were then bombarded with all of the other diners gathering around us, taking tons of photos, and joking about how crazy we were. Then came the burritos. My god. They were ginormous. No, wait, ginormous doesn't do them justice (see photos).

The pitchers of water and seemingly minuscule forks were all we had to help us tackle these mammoth burritos. For the first seventeen minutes we ate continuously. After that we had the feeling that Adam Richmond describes as the ""food wall"". We couldn't take another bite. Now remember, we have ninety minutes to finish the entire thing. After these first few minutes we took about four or five bites before the time ran out. Even those bites were near impossible to swallow. The ninety minutes seemed to fly by though especially because people were constantly coming up to us and asking us about the burritos. Each and every one of them were in complete amazement in regards to the size and also at our sheer stupidity for even trying to complete the thing. We were also constantly bombarded with flashes from the tourists' cameras. We were almost like celebrities!

After the ninety minutes were up, we held our heads in shame while also holding in our puke. I don't mean to be graphic, but it's definitely justified. Our server came by and handed us our shameful T-shirts (The front says ""Certified Weenie"" and the back says ""I was defeated by the B3 Burrito"") and again, our picture was taken. This time it was different though. It wasn't a passing tourist or one of the many people cheering us on from the bar (thanks guys if you're reading this!). No, instead it was our server taking our Wall of Shame photo. Ugh.

The burrito itself was actually really good. Although the shredded beef and enchilada sauce were pretty salty. This review is slightly biased because now every time I think of the burrito I get sick to my stomach. The experience, the meeting of tons of random strangers, as well as the millions of laughs we had during the ninety minutes is definitely a 5/5 star rating. However, the burrito itself is only a 1/5 rating. The burrito was extremely tasty and a normal human-sized serving would probably have a higher rating. But as I said before, just the thought of the burrito brings back my shameful failure as well as the nauseating feeling I had for the rest of the day.",aYM006S1U0VwX9ZTjR3KQg,5,4,3,lpcw_uvgNJD_rnxGoSYVsA
2057294,2010-11-16,1,12f7GOkkC0GZRMif-fidhQ,"What brought my group of friends out to the Nascar Cafe was the Man Vs. Food show on the Travel Channel. We were watching it while getting ready and deciding where to eat in our hotel room. It so happened to show Vegas spots and a burrito sounded good at the moment so we took a cab out the the Sahara and then to find out that our guy friends weren't able to order the huge burrito to eat at our table.To our disappointment, they told us that they would have to go up to the counter and eat it there.. YEAH where EVERYONE in the restaurant can watch. Very awkward. So no one ended up doing the burrito challenge. Most of us ordered the burger and curly fries, which was okay, pretty big portions of everything, curly fries were good, sadly better than the burger itself. Two of the guys got the regular sized burrito which was decent, and better than expected.

Beware: we asked for ranch sauce thinking it'd be on the house, but they charge for it, I guess like any other restaurant... especially in Vegas.",x1paA3aUHJTurbtFkBSOGg,1,1,2,kzIDX5X24AvKi31hjtlt6A

How could you pick this place?

**Back to the Review**

When you first walk in to Nascar Cafe you will see a line. You will hear little murmurs like ""Wow, I can't believe I'm here..... MvF"" ""blah blah B3 or Big Ass Burrito"". Two things come to mind when you see this place... Is Nascar really a sport? King of the Hill just came to life! I was waiting for some to say Propane and Propane accessories, but someone did say my favorite Hank Hill line... ""I tell you WHat"". I felt very very very out of place. Arlington, Texas is alive! I'm surprised I was not mistake for Kan. Okay Okay. I'm being harsh in a joking way of course. I did not drink too much Hater-aid and no one was raciest towards me. I apologize for being a little bitter... but please read on.

After a 45 minute waiting with very very impatient people behind me, I was finally seated. Yeah! This is a long time to wait with only maybe 3 small parties in front of me. I did not see any burritos on the menu. What the deuce? I wanted a 1 lb size of the B3. (I found out later you can ask for it, thank you yelp) Instead I ordered a guacamole bacon burger. A Carl's Jr commercial was never more dead on! While eating a ""fancy"" 13 dollar burger I was wondering why I wasn't eating a 4 or 5 dollar Carl's Jr burger instead. Portions are big but even if I was drunk, I'd much rather hit up the cheaper local Denny's. The curl fries were slightly better than the burger. My friend ordered frozen buffalo wings. Okay, she didn't mean to get them frozen, but they came out almost that way. The chef did replace her half pound order of wings with a fresh HOT plate of 1 lb of wings. Nice up grade for an honest mistake. I tried the wings... Too bad I'm a wing specialist. The wings were hot on the outside, but still slightly under cooked on the inside. I didn't notice this until the wings became cold over time. Come on how hard are wings to make? 10-12 minutes in a fryer and add maybe 5 minutes more if frozen. My burger fell apart while I was eating it. Not in a good mouth watering way, but in a nasty way. If this ever happens to you, that means that the bread is older and the meat was not cooked correctly. I'm not sure how it was cooked... Maybe grilled, baked and boiled?....

The PROS... There's always a bright side. Despite the slow slow service. My server was actually nice and in a good mood :). I appreciate that. The employee was dragging his or her feet and clearing dishes like they were the bomb squad. I heard a customer say, ""They should fire everyone and hire new people."" Thank you to my server. I applaud you :). This place is seriously Nascar Heaven with millions of TV playing only Nascar (and one soccer game). Or the opposite of heaven if you aren't in to Nascar. I could only image what Top Gear has to say about Nascar and driving in circles. 

I wish I never set foot inside of Sahara or Nascar Cafe again. If you are a guest of Sahara, I do think you should give this place try. Call me crazy, but the quality is kind of like cafeteria food. Its not great, but its decent enough that you could eat there. I think my review is a tad bias and if your food is cooked by a different chef than today I'm sure you will be fine. Thank goodness I didn't get sick. I'm writing this from my Wynn Suite and I know tomorrow is another day. Hot N Juicy and Hash House A Go Go are next. I think I saved the best for last.

Really, that's the only reason to venture to the Nascar Cafe... that and if you're already in the Sahara to take advantage of $3 blackjack.

I ordered the BLT - man-sized portion.  Not gonna lie, the man-sized portions are enough for at least 3 people - 2 if you're really hungry.  Sadly enough, you have almost half left over and don't feel like it's worth saving, AT ALL.  My friends and I had so many curly fries and half-sandwiches left over that (even in our drunken munchies stage) we didn't dare touch again.  

They are definitely NOT vegetarian friendly.  My friend couldn't order ANYTHING.  There wasn't even anything that you could ask for without meat that would still be semi-decent.  

One of my friends decided to do the B3 challenge that we saw on Man v. Food.  6lbs of burrito, filled with beans (lots of it), shredded beef, guacamole, sour cream, and just a lot of shit basically.  You get 90 minutes to try.  If you do - you not only get the burrito for free, but you also get unlimited rides at the Sahara rollercoaster.  Not my idea of fun, but an interesting novelty nonetheless.  I thought that the food challenge would be more exciting, but it wasn't, and I was almost relieved when my friend began to heave because it meant we could finally get on with our Vegas trip.

So my hubby got stuck with bud light. Then I order a hot chocolate. She walked around the corner still stirring it. Yuck tastes like chalky water. So I send that back and ask for a pineapple juice. They lady once again comes around the corner, this time licking her lips. Hands me my drink and says yeap that's good. My husband and I look at eachother. So I grab another straw and yep it's good but kind of hard to mess up pineapple juice. 

Now to the food, no untensils no condiments, had to ask for everything! 
So I ordered a short stack of pancakes (2) with a side of ham. Pancakes were just ok, I can do bisquick better. Ham steak was cooked on the same grill as the regular steak so had a charbroiled steak taste. Yuck.
My husband ordered a chicken sandwich which came with curly fries. He truely believes the fries were frozen and the chicken sandwich too. He ate it but only because starvation kicked in. Which I would have went back to the BACKSTAGE DELI @ THE LUXOR_yum!

All of the tables in this part of the Sahara were not $10....they were a buck.  $1 blackjack & roulette....... and penny slots.  The funny thing about penny slots here was that they only take bills, not coins.  OK, so I thought it was funny.

4260433,2010-09-23,0,12f7GOkkC0GZRMif-fidhQ,"This review is for 3.5 stars, all things considered. This is one of the places (casinos) in which my mom can use her points to pay for the food (essentially, a comp) so we just take care of the tip. This is a better place to eat in this casino (the caravan cafe's just ok), except they don't offer milkshakes on the simple menu (my nephew loves milkshakes). I should mention that we did eat here once before because my MIL worked at the casino for so long (before coming here somewhat regularly with my family). 

This is a popular crowded place so there will always be a wait for the food. Service depends on your server- we've had both ends of the spectrum. Gratuity is automatically added when you have a party of 6- however, when my toddler nephew was counted as an adult, the manager took it off. There are two prices listed on the menu- club holders get a discount. Fun atmosphere for Nascar fans, with many tv's all around for the spectators.

Here's the skinny on the food: the clam chowder bowl is enormous- big enough to share, the philly cheese steak is very messy to eat (on the gloppy side), the burgers are iffy (sometimes not cooked as ordered), the nachos is perfect for a large group to share- ginormous (ordered it once and it didn't even look like I ate it), the fish and chips- large portions, fries tend to be on the excessive side, the onion rings are pretty good and served in a stack, the chicken fingers (not heavily battered, BTW) can be ordered in two sizes. There is a really good appetizer combo that is nice to share with a crowd (Group Food Idea: nachos & appetizer combo). The burrito is as huge as it appears on ""Man Vs. Food"" (my sister was on that episode, for a few seconds)- didn't have it, but seen it many times- many people lose.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,3,crzxApcDRSA6-2vYi9xX1Q

I decided to bring my son here for some video game fun and a bite to eat. When we arrived a B3 challenge was getting started and a crowd quickly gathered to take photos and videos. Before we left 2 people had tried and failed the Challenge.


We ordered some soft drinks to start. (they serve PEPSI) but the popular drink seemed to be the 180oz Tower of Beer. Almost every table had one.


The menu is just bar food with American & Mexican options(Burgers & Burritos). We ordered Chicken Fingers and a MONSTER 1 pound BLT sandwich both with fries.


It took awhile for the food to come out and when it did it was not impressive at all:(


The chicken fingers were clearly overcooked. They almost snapped they were so dry and crisp. NO seasoning and The fries were cheap frozen fries with no salt or seasoning.


The BLT had ALOT of bacon but it was the cheap stuff not fully cooked NOT crisp like a BLT should be. VERY little tomato and lettuce -definitely disproportionate to the sandwich and the bacon-mayo(GROSS!!!) The fries cheap frozen curly fries with NO salt.


Just plain bad bar food and VERY pricy-$35 for 1 adult 1 kid. Neither of us ate 1/2 our meals and the service was sketchy at best.


NOTE: The B3 challenge ONLY cost $20 if you FAIL + you get a T-shirt. IT would be worth it if the FOOD wasnt so damn BAD:(",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,8,4,1,gyuQ2a5OjIsee8IJWz_pJQ

The only reason my friends and I came here was so we could try to convince one of our friends to try the B3 Burrito challenge.  It's 6 lbs. of burrito that needs to be consumed entirely within 1.5 hour, otherwise it will cost a bit over $20 to pay for it.

So needless to say, we were all stoked when we entered.  The decor was decent, and the menu itself was really limited to American bar foods, and is definitely not vegetarian friendly (my friend ended up getting the pineapple chocolate covered fries, which surprisingly works).  Our server was genuinely nice and welcomed us warmly, but unfortunately, the rest of our experience really sucked.

1. The food took over twenty minutes to come out.  The restaurant wasn't even that busy, so I didn't get why it would take so much time.
2. Once we got our food, we realized 3/4 of  the curly fries we ordered were no longer appetizing.  Something about them made us really uneasy to eat them.
3. The burrito challenge took us over thirty minutes of waiting because not only does it take 15 minutes to prepare one, but some douche took our friend's spot and started eating the damn thing, even after coming later.  Our server apologized, and we definitely sent bad karma along his way (he didn't succeed btw, not even close).
4. Some snobby group of middle-age men kept talking smack about our friend during his burrito challenge.  Booo.

The food was expensive and not even good.  We threw all of our fries away, and ended up just watching out friend tackle the challenge.  Unfortunately, he was owned by the burrito, but for being hella hungover and ending up throwing up in the nearby trash can, he got a lot further than the guy that took his burrito.

HA!  Karma sucks huh?  Oh well, at least my friend left with a hot pink weenie shirt.  He's forever in Vegas now... unless they decide to revamp this restaurant.

In short, only go for the burrito challenge commodity (which btw, is pretty gross from what my friend said... shredded pork = no bueno).  Although one star for the kind waitress, you were pretty tight!",mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,1,0,2,ev9XLHQCahDpidH9AKt68A

Located in the back of the Sahara Hotel and Casino, one has to wonder when they get business here.

Trying to grab a quick bite before our show on a weekday afternoon, only a handful of parties were present.  

Standard cafe fare like burgers, pizza, salads, etc.  

We got the Spinach & Artichoke Dip, ""a creamy, cheesy blend of artichoke hearts, spinach, onion, parmesan, a hint of bacon and tortilla chips.  Served in a sourdough bowl."" for $7.25 and the Nascar Burger, ""a classic Black Angus 10 oz juicy flame-broiled burger."" for $9.25.

First off, the spinach & artichoke dip were tasty, but too small of a portion for the price.  And I wasn't too fond of the soft sourdough bowl - what's up with soft bread?  On the menu, it says, ""place in the center of the table and dive in!""  Well, it's definitely not big enough to share.

We asked for the burger to be medium well, but it came out more well done.  There's a problem when you can't even get the burger right.  It had a decent flavor it in though, and it was also on a soft bun too.  The fries had a deep color that reminded me of Arby's curly fries, but without the seasoning.  

Service was a bit slow, not on our waitress's part, but on how long it took for the food to come out.  (Were they killing the cow in the back?)  The place needs some better lighting, maybe they are trying to save on the electric bill because I found it to be too dark for my tastes during the day.

Overall, spend your money elsewhere.  When you're hungry on the strip, don't get sucked into bad casino cafes 'cuz you'll feel even more ripped off.

So I ordered the Fish and chips for $10.00. The dish has four halibut-fillets battered with beer and cooked to a golden brown with a side of curly fries. Nothing too fancy about the fish dish.  I also had two Cranberry and Vodka drinks for $8.00 each. The price of the cocktails seems questionable. I hope the bartender uses good vodka for my drinks. 

The bar also have a special on a 144 oz pitcher of beer starting at $20.00 for domestic beer and more for imported. With a huge selection of beers, I might try that one day to along with that B3 burrito, in which many of you are disappointed that I didn't try.

Think about it: It's like you would be consuming a small child.  You know what?  Scratch that.  It's probably best that you don't, as it's a little creepy to conceptualize.

But since the Sahara is closing, I figured that I should be open-minded and give it a try.  They specialize in ""Big"" food.  Six pound burritos, one pound burgers, stupidly huge beer towers.... You get the point.

I ordered the hot open-faced turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes.  Wow.  Really?  That thing was GOOD.  Like really, really good.  Paolo D. looked at my plate and told the waitress ""I'll have what he's having"".

They also serve 1 pound versions of their child-sized burrito (I had to put THAT image back in your head, didn't I?).  I think I'll be trying that.  Of 4,000+ people to take the burrito challenge, apparently only 34 people have ever completed it.

So I've been ""Pfft, whatever"" about this place for years, and it's sad that I only discovered the food here a month before it closes, but I'm glad that I got over myself enough to try it.

The food and service doesn't warm anything. It makes my heart return to its cold, frigid Boston temperature. Soon, I will remember that I'm sitting in one of the worst hotels in Vegas, in a cafe with a namesake that stems from the worst sport in history. Not even the four guys competing in the 8-pound burrito contest will make me smile.",WUbg61aynUeETjo3AL3pIQ,1,0,2,M6i6UfGzBdQIPfQaMzSt2A

Love Mexican food? Think you can finish a huge burrito, the size of a baby, in 90 min? You are probably thinking what?!! Yep, its like I said, a 6 pound Big Baddass Burger. Do you think you could be up for the challenge?  If you eat all of it in 90 min, its free, but I am sure you still have to ""pay"" for what you eat, and might get sick!  I saw one guy start his venture, but shortly had to leave after. Did great a pic of it :)

Love beer? Order a 120 oz maybe it is beer stick. Choose your fav beer on tap and share with your friends, or try to do it all on your own. 

Fun places, didn't get to try the food though :)
