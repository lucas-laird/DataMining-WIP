I felt gross being served from this place and that's without even mentioning the drink counter.  There were old cups all over the counter, soda spilled, no napkins, Lisa and pretty much everything. The floor had dirty lids and a ketchup packet. The other trash can, ""the clean one"" was full to the brim. The table were in disarray, some with chairs and others looking like people left bits of chewed food around. I don't eat CJ often but after today and these ridiculous prices...$12 for bacon western??....I won't be back and I'll be sure to share my experience with everyone I know. I wish y'all luck as a business card it's gonna be needed
I wish I could show the pictures I have, just bad.

This is one of the few, though I don't know just how late they stay open (at least through midnight). We were satisfied with the burgers and drinks. Their fish sandwich is unnecessarily spicy. I don't know if it is this restaurant's job or the airport's job to clean the trash bins, but whoever was responsible obviously hadn't emptied them in many hours, as they were overflowing. Personally, I would have preferred Popeye's if (a) I knew where it was, and (b) I knew it was open.",MnYfi2DODiZkLIwJFuwB2g,2,2,3,oknuPEnnFI94QeS9u_TQwQ

My kids asked for water and the old guy cashier with the glasses shouted '1 dollar for the cup' don't eat here. The cashiers are so rude and didn't pay attention on their job instead just keep chatting in the back counter!,THI7orwAlsM4gIB17Aw5yw,0,0,1,NlvcwVBlbkeXOlodbO289A

Perhaps the manager who was standing around doing nothing could've taken an order. Extra star because I haven't had Carl's Jr. since I moved back east.",-GKEFg_92pp0q842clS_Jw,0,0,3,ucpuQzA2aZAvtVvYNFwkZg

Once we ordered the meal came in quick but again kitchen staff messed up on my boyfriend's order & refused to give us ranch because ""they needed to charge for the sauces."" For the next trip to the Las Vegas Airport they need to add more food variety in each terminal.",4cwDJEAysnK9hBJQ73Hacw,0,0,1,GLjHmVNelagddWqqeWuSFA
