85452,2015-12-31,0,RO1h2JPbvp0QeqSHDJbeKw,"I love chicken wings. So I ordered the 8-10 piece wings. 
The flavour of the chicken wasn't bad. 

However, 2 out of 9 pieces of my wings weren't cooked throughly, as in the chicken was still pink and still had blood running through them. I walked up to them and showed them, with no intention of getting my money back, just wanting to let them know that it was raw and to cook it a bit longer in future for the next person who orders the wings. I own my own business so I know things like this can happen. 

To my shock, the employees there told me the chicken was cooked and not raw. Getting a bit wound up that they think I'm lying or something, I picked up the chicken with my fingers and opened up the wing and the drum even more to show them it was still bleeding. They said it was just the blood line, that it's happened before and that no one has gotten sick. (Are they trying to tell me raw chicken is normal and that this happens all the time?) I said to them 'can't you see the chicken is bleeding?? I'm just here to let you know for next time'. Feeling infuriated at this point I asked for my money back. No apology, no nothing from Anchor Bar staff. 

Will NEVER be returning.",jjpiLy7KllK4XgmDczn10w,0,0,1,PEvXvnrySZnTTGyOTXfe2A

2393093,2015-12-31,0,RO1h2JPbvp0QeqSHDJbeKw,"Anchor bar is popular for being the fine chaps to of had invented the buffalo wing.

They have a large multitude of flavors you can choose from, both on their French fries or wing sauce. I ordered the combo and got lemon pepper flavor for the fries (choose from lemon pepper, salt and vinegar, Cajun, or regular) and chose teriyaki ginger and sesame  honey for my wings.

The wings itself is pretty juicy and not overcooked at all, and the combo comes with a lot of food. Their teriyaki sauce was pretty interesting and had a slight spicy kick to it that I really enjoyed. If you ask too, they'll let you get a pick and you can try their sauce before you order if you are indecisive.

The bar seating sort of makes things easier if you want to be able to get a refill on your drink and keeps you out of the way of tourist traffic walking through the casino, so I suggest sitting there instead of in the food court area.

Our cashier was also pretty cool at checking up on us and attentive, which I wasn't expecting for a food court slash casino bar type restaurant, or whatever you want to call it..?

The entire combo was about $19.76 which was pretty pricy for chicken wings and French fries but you do get a lot of food for what you pay.
Pretty in short, Its good to try, but I still prefer cheaper options myself for the quality food you are getting. But if you are in the area, anchor bar is a must try for the wing connoisseur.
I'm sure i'll come back and try it again.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,0,0,3,kWruTdjey6pmopfSjdbRaw
2480189,2015-08-24,2,RO1h2JPbvp0QeqSHDJbeKw,"Pretty cool little location, they are located in the food court area of the Venetian but the way they have their store setup it makes it feel like a little wing bar. They had some sauces out to try and see what you would want, but would only let you sample 2, thus limiting my ability to choose wisely which sauce I wanted. They only have 8 or so, so its not a huge selection, but the ones I tried (3 total, since I tried 2 and ordered a different one) were just okay. 
I settled on their medium buffalo, and since I had babies to take care of I opted for the boneless (against my normal preference) to make minimize messy fingers. It was fine but not as spicy as I thought it would be considering the mild was the one I tried and assumed it would have been a bit more spicy than that, but really that's just preference and didn't affect my review. 
The chicken was just okay, and at least 3 pieces had some unpleasant gristle in them, and though I cant be certain, they just sort of seemed to be frozen chicken bites like the ""Anytizers"" ones or something. The sauce itself other than not being as spicy as I thought was pretty good, but I prefer my wings to be quite saucy rather than just lightly coated and served sort of dry, and there was no leftover pool of sauce left in the basket. They also had a strange after-spice to them that sort of lingered strangely in the back of the throat that I didn't care for. 
My wife settled on the ""Chicken cheesesteak"" which I think they should have just called ""Chicken Philly"" or something since a Cheesesteak implies specifically that there is steak in there, and though I was not confused by this or expecting anything, and it was laid out well on their menu, but I guess that's just a suggestion, as the name is like an oxymoron. 
All that nonsense aside it was quite good but a bit small. It came with grilled onions and they were very tasty and well caramelized. Both entrees also came with a side of seasoned fries which were good. 
The service wasn't anything special, and the girl at the coulter was a bit awkward and shy, so ordering was difficult. I also ordered 2 extra ranch sides  (which cost $1.50!)  in addition to the one they give you with the wings, and when I got my order she asked ""Ranch or Bleu Cheese"" and I was a bit confused since I was the only customer she had helped all day (we walked up right as they were opening) and so I confirmed ranch and she gave me just the one. when I asked for the 2 more she said they are $0.75 each... hmmm you really forgot about that from ringing me up then only standing there with a blank look for 5 minutes since? 
Anyway so I said I had already paid for 2, so after asking to see my receipt she gave me one more now making my total 2 (in case you aren't following I should be getting 3 total) then I said, yeah I need one more, and again confused she said it would be $0.75, so I pointed out on my receipt I had paid for 2 and she said I had 2, so I asked ""doesn't the meal come with 1? then she got it!
Overall ity wasn't bad, it just wasn't great, and I probably wouldn't ever eat here again, just because it isn't worth the time or money (it, like everything in Vegas was pretty pricey).",p_6-Q9uAqn3i8NLjudkJ1A,0,0,3,QDCBMn1BpQD_WH4fcqbVsg

Food venues inside casinos - no matter how casual - are usually overpriced, so when I stopped by I was delighted to see that they offered a good amount of boneless wings at prices that weren't terribly inflated over, say, what you might get if you were to drive into a regular Las Vegas community. The wings were just a tad excessively breaded for my tastes but weren't bad at all.

Let's face it, being in Vegas can lead to lots of eating, particularly unhealthy eating at that. While boneless fried chicken wings aren't healthy by any means, this venue was still a decent way to get a good amount of protein fast and inexpensively.

We also shared the kale salad. It was good - it had blue cheese, cranberries, nuts and a raspberry vinegarette. My only complaint was that they should chop the kale up a bit more. There were some huge pieces that required some additional tools to not be overwhelming.

I took it back to the counter and asked what the flavors were, and the woman I ordered from initially said Terriyaki, but then realized I didn't order that flavor, and changed her answer to Chipotle. Needless to say, it was overly saucy. And on top of that, they added all the wings together, so the Honey-Ginger wings were doused in the flavors of the other wings. They obviously should have separated the two flavors of wings. At the end, I didn't even want to finish the last of the wings.

4872912,2015-09-18,0,RO1h2JPbvp0QeqSHDJbeKw,"First of all, I love chicken and chicken wings in general. Now, I place wings in two categories, either they're flavorful and moist or crispy and spicy. Now there is a small percentage where there is a fair medium and I think I found it. 

First, the wings are big, almost to that ""certain the bone is cracked somewhere inside from supporting all this meat"" size. Chicken I've only had from a Tyson brand wing, but then there's the flavored sauce that has a ""tang"" to it when I tried the ""hot"" with bone option, (they serve boneless too). The fries feel like an afterthought, not crispy or too soft, they are delicious but I expected some crispy fries and they removed their chipotle option which I thought might have been interesting. I choose the salt and vinegar but tasted nothing on the latter half.

The trick on the combo meal is how you eat it. Choose from ranch or blue cheese and if you don't mind the celery sticks, just put em' on the side to justify your self conscience choice that you at least had a veggie in your presence. Now, here's the trick. They hide a pool of ""awesome"" sauce for your fries under the wings, because that's where the good stuff is at for the floppy carb potatoe sticks called ""fries"". Dip em' and soak them up while you enjoy the wad of chicken on each chicken bone. Enjoy!

Food is fast served and delivered to sit down or take on your way like any awesome hangover nursing spot or grub place on the strip. Take some time if you're close by and enjoy this spot and the typical bar with original ""license plate"" aesthetic that somehow fits that ""diamond in the rough"" spot. Wing it up and try a beer on tap or three.",et7-6PTY_O4mlEqw94q5gg,0,1,4,UFuz0mMxvOccEZgENborjA

I only needed 2 napkins and if you have been to the original that should tell you something...I suggest getting your wings elsewhere,lTil3fDQ6lfRI45iTIxWpg,0,0,1,eH4uStUh_4clBI-JzKf_Gg

Mind you all I read some of the reviews prior to coming and I didn't let it deter me... I wish I had listen, it was slightly better than flavorless... Will not be returning. Also, they are stingy with the sauce, the lack of sauce could be contributing to the lack of flavor. The fries with Cajun seasoning was on point though.",p7_sJUPcljGYXmPZifVFLQ,2,1,3,Kc5YoZBmY-KlSI9SYVBpcQ
5161310,2015-10-15,1,RO1h2JPbvp0QeqSHDJbeKw,"As a lover of wings, I had to pay a visit to the place that created the original buffalo wing.

They are located in the food court of the Grand Canal Shoppes inside the Venetian.  They only have bar seating, but there are other tables around the food court.

When you first sit at the bar, there's a contraption on the countertop infusing bourbon with mint. They use it in their Southern Comfort drink which is pretty good, and this is coming from someone who doesn't drink bourbon.  Their Pineapple Express (16 oz/ $9) is a rum based drink that was more my style. It tasted like pineapple soda.

For a snack, I got a single order of wings and it was enough to share between two people.  A single order ($12) comes with 9 wings and you get a choice of two flavors.  I went with lemon pepper and mild buffalo.  Both were tasty.  The lemon pepper is a tangy zesty dry rub.  The mild sauce had enough heat to tingle my tongue but I could still enjoy the flavor.  

These were some of the best wings I've had.  They were meatier than your average wing and the flavors were on point.  The only problem is that there isn't a location closer to where I live.",c_HRWeQtTIyT1ICK09C6FQ,5,2,5,2zDFJoJY5x3iw0R380iDdA
5446589,2015-07-25,0,RO1h2JPbvp0QeqSHDJbeKw,I was thrilled when my wife told me she saw The Anchor Bar while she was wandering  around the Venetian. I couldn't wait to try it & I was not disappointed. I ordered a double order of hot wings & my wife got the Anchor Strips & fries. My wings were large & perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside & juicy on the inside. My wife enjoyed her Anchor Strips & the fries were great as well. Perfectly seasoned & crispy. The only criticisms I could have was I was not a huge fan of the blue cheese and I wish the wings had a little more sauce on them. I tend to like more sauce so that is just a personal preference. I would just ask for extra sauce next time.,yujZWE_uZn41f5-677Gvjg,1,1,5,2zxQSWARpS3jGPZe8MiWUQ
5507149,2015-11-24,0,RO1h2JPbvp0QeqSHDJbeKw,"We just wanted something besides a buffet for dinner, so I found out that the Anchor Bar was close to our hotel room. It was a chance to try the original chicken wings, and we couldn't pass it up. We've had Wingstop, BW3, and other wing restaurants. And I have to say that the Anchor Bar wings are the best I've ever had. 

I ordered the single combo with a drink. That was 10 large and meaty wing pieces with a lot of their seasoned fries. You can have your choice of 2 sauces, and there are 3 different fry seasoning you can choose from. I tried the hot and teriyaki sesame sauces, with the AB seasoning on the fries.

My wife had the breaded chicken sandwich with hot sauce and fries. We immediately saw that one order of fries would have been enough for both of us. Both of us thought that the hot sauce wasn't really very spicy, but we are use to spicy food. The sauces did have good flavor and the wings were fried to perfection.

The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because they had my wing order ready minutes before the sandwich order. So my order had to stay under the heat lamb and wait. My wings and fries were still of a good temperature, so it wasn't that bad. If I could, I'll give them 4.5 stars. And they're open till midnight.",NYLtjcCRiJ3YaPXbGfFdAg,0,0,4,vj7gBnA2tR1KBeZOiX_96A
5601667,2015-10-12,7,RO1h2JPbvp0QeqSHDJbeKw,"Chicken wings are one of my ""secret"" cravings - I'll usually prefer them to other foods they're associated with (aka pizza). A good chicken wing, however, is hard to find as there's not a balance between the chicken and the sauce. It's quite a statement to proclaim that an establishment serves ""the original Buffalo Chicken Wing (tm)"", and ""the best wings in the world"". 

Anchor Bar continues the tradition of East Coast favorite chains first finding their foot on the West Coast (Shake Shack, White Castle). They are located in the Grand Canal Shoppes Food Court inside Venetian|Palazzo. They have limited seating in the actual counter but there's plenty of seating in the food court. When the No1DP and I were there they had samples of their boneless wings.

I got the Original Anchor Bar (Buffalo) Wing (medium spicy) with seasoned smoky chipotle fries and a Pepsi ($14.50).
- Portion size was big enough for two people. Unlike chicken wings I've eaten that comes as a traditional side for pizza or sold in grocery stores, each chicken wing was a fatty mini drumstick. The No1DP said that had he known the portion size was that big he would've been happy to share my combo.
- Anchor Bar is the only business to do a chicken wing right, equal portion of crispy chicken wing skin and sauce. Usually a chicken overwhelmed with sauce is trying to hide the quality of the chicken. Each chicken wing was cooked properly.
- Celery sticks were thin but crisp.
- The bleu cheese sauce isn't strong and is made to complement the wings, celery sticks and fries.
- Fries, though adequately portioned, needed to be more crispy. This is the reason for the -1 star.

I had over half my food left so I gave it to two homeless guys camping out in the bridge that connects the Palazzo to the Wynn. They looked like they needed food more than we did.

If split between two people it comes to around $7.25/person so I would recommend this as a suitable cheap yet delicious lunch/dinner option in the Strip. They also serve other flavors of bone-in, boneless wings, salads and sandwiches for people who want to make their meals more interesting.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,10,10,4,JB9LRdcXGErcnEY-EkD0Hg

I planned on getting wings, but when I saw they had another specialty sandwich, Beef on a Weck, I wanted to have it again. 

Staff wasn't overly friendly, but it is essentially a food court in Vegas.  

Fries were good and so was the Weck bread.  However, Much of the beef was chewy and really inedible and had to toss out much of the sandwich. 

While I did not have them, the wings looked good.  Just stay away from the Beef on a Weck!!",bibGC0_tz-a9VyxoBYTQiQ,1,1,2,kEJKbIvdn_-qG_6Fi8a-Zw

Why not a 5 - star? The service was slow during the time I went on labor day. It took over 45 minutes to get my food - who wants to wait that long for food in Vegas?",WfePuaS_iXGNGU6bfDe3JQ,2,1,4,ZQE73kpbYakI6Nz6rxhcFg

We are seriously spoiled to have Anchor Bar and all of the other east coast specials in Vegas. You can literally relive my east coast eats tour without leaving the city (making list soon) Amazing!
I got a large 1/2 bbq and 1/2 hot to share with the family. Man, the wings were just like I remember them..
Large crunchy chicken wings sauced perfectly, not like the mushy tiny chicken fetus wings you get at Wingstop. Nothing beats the original; nothing...

I hate to make a 5* review so short but it's all you need to know.. 
This is the only place in my book to get legitimate buffalo wings in Vegas from now on.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,3,3,5,QlNeCMG2UHnUa30__amy7A
