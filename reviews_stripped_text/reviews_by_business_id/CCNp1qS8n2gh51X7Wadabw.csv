We were sat right underneath one of the TVs, which had its volume turned all the way up.  If it was played through an actual sound system and not the TV speakers, I don't think we would have minded, but we used an IR blaster phone app to turn the TV off, because they wouldn't turn the volume down for us (despite multiple requests and assurances that it would be taken care of).

I couldn't tell what brand of tortilla chip they used, but it was likely Mission, albeit a bit stale.  The salsa, for what it was, wasn't too bad.  Definitely not fresh-made.

To drink, I got the house margarita (since it was half off), and it was watered down.  The ice used was very fine but not blended, and drank like the crushed ice from a 7-11.  They don't have pitchers of margaritas, which was a bit of a disappointment.

The menu has *very* similar options to the restaurant next door, and from what I can tell, they are both supplied by the same kitchen.  Nothing really had much flavor in terms of appetizers (we had the ""tex-mex"" eggrolls, chicken tenders, and buffalo wings), with the exception being the last item, which were surprisingly decent.

For dinner, I got the chicken salad, which consisted primarily of shredded lettuce, with hints of the other ingredients.  The pickled jalapenos were pretty tasty, and they went light on the dressing, which is how I like my salads.  The chicken was the primary problem - lukewarm and very dry; not just overcooked, but ""overcooked and left out for a few hours"" kind of dry.  A coworker had the same thing as me, and experienced the same problem.

My other coworkers all ordered some variant of the Mexican food that this place offers, and had nothing great to say.  A Chevy's will make better Tex-mex than what they had here.

In short, the food ran us the price of a middle-lower-end buffet, and was definitely not up to par.",O6_FMmBrJtOeRt_y3jbSjg,2,0,1,d7OcnZppUX_5iecl5yfITA

Menu isn't huge, but has a great selection of appetizers and main course meals. 
Start you off with customary colorful chips & salsa - we ordered the guacamole which came out on a bed of lettuce and was enough to satisfy 6 people...Nice helping! :)
I had the Tortilla soup which was to die for and I highly recommend it! 
Main course was the carne asada enchilada. It was comparable to the carne asada you'd find in a California mexi stand. The red sauce was not too spicy and had a great flavor to it. 
For desert I had the strawberry cake - YUM...but didn't compare to the banana burrito...Holy cow that was good! 
Prices were average and the staff were very friendly and on top of things - Glasses were never empty. They have tvs all around playing awesome 80's Motley Crue videos the whole time! When dinner was over the whole family was treated with a complimentary airbrush tattoo.

The ""restaurant"" is tucked away into a small corner of the hotel next to the Paradise Cafe, and arguably it exists within a corner of what was once part of the Paradise Cafe. It appears as though someone went on Storage Wars, won a locker full of pictures of Vince Neil and figured that opening this ""Cantina"" was the only way to recoup their fifteen dollars. If you've eaten at the Paradise Cafe, imagine if the walls were painted orange, adorned only with dozens of pictures of Vince Neil, as Motley Crue music videos played in an endless loop, and you have Vince Neil's Cantina. The menu is more or less the menu from Paradise Cafe with random Motley Crue song titles assigned to random dishes. The staff was friendly but the food was not good. The fries we got were not seasoned and were undercooked drastically, and the chicken tenders were also not seasoned.

My friend had the taquitos and had the runs all night.  Another friend had the Fried Eggroll appetizer (can't remember what it was called) and it looked good and was told it was decent.

We were pretty much the only ones in there and one of the servers insisted on sweeping up the carpet right next to and under our table.  Wtf? You can't wait until AFTER we leave??

That was amazing! 

But that's about where it stops. The place was pretty dead. Although in fairness to them, it was 5 p.m. on a busy holiday weekend (conference championship games),so it's not like anybody was in Vegas. Yes, I'm being facetious about that. I was actually kind of bummed it wasn't more happening. 

I also went back there for late-night happy hour after the Rock Vault show. Why and the heck is this place not next to the theater where the Rock Vault show plays? Talk about poor planning. I mean, Rock Vault, Vince Neil. What am I missing here? 

Instead it's tucked down a long hall way. Which might be for the best. Because the food isn't great. I have suspicion it's just Smart and Final boxed Mexican food being served. Although, that might be mean to Smart and Final.

My experiences here haven't been terrible but they definitely could use some improvement. My biggest gripe is with the service. There is NEVER  a host or hostess standing at the front and we ALWAYS have to go looking for one to be assisted. The employees standing at the bar will even see you looking for someone and still won't greet you or come over to you. I guess they have adopted the ""that's not my job"" mindset. This is so odd to me.

The actual wait staff is decent here, and are always prompt with refilling drinks and honoring whatever requests you may have. They do take forever drop off and collect your tab, which is my biggest pet-peeve at restaurants because when I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go. 

The setup of the place is really roomy and is arranged well. The booths are comfortable and the tables and chairs are always clean. They have these pretty cool decorative fans on the ceiling, and--much to my disdain--they have Motley Crue videos playing on every TV screen in the joint. Shoot me, now. 

The food is pretty average here. I've had the carne asada wet burrito, chicken enchiladas, beef & chicken taquitos, beef & fish tacos, chicken tortilla soup, and chips & salsa. They all hit the spot and left me satisfied, so no complaints about the food. I am not picky when it comes to Mexican food but apparently, other reviewers are. lol.

The prices are ""meh"". For what you're getting, everything should be under $10 but you're looking at more of the $11-$20 range, which kind of irritates me everytime and makes me reluctant to even order. But it's Las Vegas and everything seems to be more costly here everywhere you go.

They have tv monitors ONLY playing Motley Crue's live shows with TONS of flashing lights. It was really annoying to see it in the corner of my eye, in front of me, EVERYWHERE as I tried to eat.

Our waiter was really nice and accommodating. The chips and salsa were pretty good! Warm crunchy chips, and not bad salsa. 

I got the pork enchiladas $13.95- and it was yummy. Very cheesy, and a good amount of everything. It was inhaled. 

My mom got just a bean and cheese burrito, but she didn't enjoy it very much.

My dad got tostada plate for $12.95 and he really enjoyed it. He loved the guacamole, but I actually thought it was kind of gross. LOL.

By dinner time we were too tired to go anywhere else so gave this place a shot. Unlike others, we were actually greeted immediately and seated. From there on, please trust the other reviews and go elsewhere. At 6 on a Sunday nite the place was a ghost town with only 2 other tables seated and Motley Crue music videos blaring. I get the Vince Neil connection but this was over-the-top annoying. Our server was good, very attentive, which frankly we expected with the lack of other customers. Food was very blah. As others noted, chips and salsa were right out of the grocery store, fish tacos were fried/microwaved, and beef ""machaca"" tacos were just cold mushed meat. Ugh. We were tired, it was food and no one got sick so I guess it ended OK. Overall, stay away from this restaurant and more to the point, the LVH in general.

Arrived about 8:30pm on Saturday night and the place was completely DEAD. Food was okay. Drinks were good. Weird deco/theme going on-- it is Vince Neil's resto, so there is rock decor-- pics and guitars on the wall-- but there is also tropical themed carpet, asian inspired chairs, weird vinyl over hard wood tables. More like a hodge podge of different restos all thrown together-- in speaking to our waiter the name alone has changed names/owners three times over the last few
years. Wow. So sorry to be so honest, but in my opinion it is very ugly inside and there is a disconnect between the overall theme (rock) and the decor. If I were Vince Neil I would not be proud to say that this is my restaurant. Overall, just plain weird. Would not recommend.",JI5X-rG7LvLJQeFG_eQTsA,2,0,1,b4UO3bHtbI4OKHMKXyI47Q

I filled up on the chips and salsa, which I thought were excellent and the waiter refilled the chips without even asking us.

5148090,2014-05-07,0,CCNp1qS8n2gh51X7Wadabw,"Let's preface this review with acknowledging the fact that I am a big Motley Crue and Vince Neil fan.

That being said... I was disappointed and quite unimpressed with my experience at Tatuado.  The hostess was confused and uncertain of her job.  A server stopped her while she was escorting us to our table and was quietly ""yelling"" at her while pointing and gesturing (I wanted to say ""Excuse me... Can you wait until she isn't WITH a customer to do this?"").  Our waiter was ""ok"", but also seemed a little dazed and confused.  

The food.  Well... Guacamole was all right, I suppose.  Chips were semi-stale, and the sour cream was a little too warm for my liking.  Everything seemed pretty generic from the Chicken Nacho appetizer to the Enchiladas, and Buffalo Wings.  Margaritas were pretty standard, except with Vince's tequila from his Tatuado branding.  

This is definitely somewhere I wanted to experience being a fan, but it is also a ""one-and-done"" for me.  I wont be returning unless some major shakeup happens and the reviews for this place become stellar over a period of time... and I will keep an eye out for that as I have seen stranger things!  

Vince:  Your music is great, your tattoo shop is damn good... why not hire a more competent management staff for your restaurant to keep up the quality?  #Disappointed.",l680vffdpqZ_1kSaEYjAwg,1,0,2,tmwQR4FtyBGlRgfPoa27ag

I ordered a bowl of the vegetarian soup which was delicious I would definitely order it again. My bf ordered the chicken enchiladas he enjoyed his dish as well.
