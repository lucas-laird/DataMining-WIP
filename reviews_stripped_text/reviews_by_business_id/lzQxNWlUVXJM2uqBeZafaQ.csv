550494,2018-01-09,0,lzQxNWlUVXJM2uqBeZafaQ,$8.17 for a pathetic amount frozen yogurt.  Didn't bother with topping...probably would have been $12.  Should have turned around and left when they said the price,HktpxyNS2B2E4tFts6Qh-g,0,0,1,k5_eCgJ4aqaLl8NTvXWKuA
1392922,2018-06-09,0,lzQxNWlUVXJM2uqBeZafaQ,"This place is decent for some frozen goods, especially late at night because it's open late. I love Las Vegas. Usually if you are craving frozen yogurt at 11PM, most places are closed but not here!

They also sell crepes here. I got the strawberry Nutella crepe which tasted pretty decent. Anything with Nutella tastes good. However the strawberry felt a little frozen. 

If you want to stuff yourself with some sugar, come to this place. It is located right beside the food court.",_VYRVjNzmRsLt8FndO23IQ,0,0,3,twHQyvjru0jJ6ugCDPsWQQ

Opted for the classic Nutella strawberry crepe. Tasty! They sell frozen yogurt here too and my friend said it tasted pretty good.

They also have the option to spike your drink with some alcohol so that's always a plus. However I didn't need to because they offered to give me a drink voucher at the sports book after I made a few bets.",1rGlT3YeoKMsF01fEEZhPQ,0,0,4,yddyORoN3s0a3FNC_J8BGQ

Wanted to order a crepe, and was given the ""oh we already cleaned the equivalent tonight and won't be making crepes the rest of the night. What?!? Closing time is 90 minutes away. I would understand within 15 min of closing, but 90 minutes?!? Absolutely ridiculous. What kind of business are you running?!? Took my business to Crepe joint in Paris instead!!! If your staff doesn't want to make crepes, they are ruining your business. Just sell fro yo only then!",NOG_yNwOMpDLpzbOF5uIdg,0,0,1,j6OE9YN7BQtrSC1t-x4Qcw
2431743,2017-04-09,0,lzQxNWlUVXJM2uqBeZafaQ,"So far this is the best frozen yogurt I've had in Vegas! I've tried the cheesecake and vanilla flavors which are both so good! It actually tastes like creamy yogurt, and not as artificial as some other places.
Theres lots of seating here, so if you dont wanna walk around and eat it you can sit down and relax. I love the staff too, they're always so nice and friendly!",bP_yim2oJZya_OZF9s4HUw,0,0,5,BVKXhTZkiukQohReEBNPeg
3161684,2017-12-27,0,lzQxNWlUVXJM2uqBeZafaQ,I know froyo has a lot of sugar but the flavors at this place have a ton. At that point just get regular ice cream. Also the topping selection is not the best.,Fnbdhvy2C82yBWH_ZI9caw,0,0,2,lXMGiZN2ZcDJX9i9HUM_QA
3241723,2016-12-12,13,lzQxNWlUVXJM2uqBeZafaQ,"Clean, bright, inviting.  Froyo, crepes, and caffeine!!! Smoothies and shakes too... Feeling like sugar?  Well here's an option.  While looking for Hexx Chocolates - which I couldn't find - this place crossed my path.  Heck yes please.  I didn't pay attention to what was in the crepe I ordered.  I just got it cuz I was feeling touristy and the crepe was called the New Yorker !  It was great...just gotta watch my strawberry intake :P.  Cafe Mocha was perfectly hot, sweet, and creamy.  Was a really nice breakfast for lunch.  Look they're open at 8am.  Hope guests know they exist at this location.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,19,20,4,YMQ7CQkl9cKkx7kUmn2wrw
5034916,2017-12-12,0,lzQxNWlUVXJM2uqBeZafaQ,"Most expensive and worst yogurt ever. Very disappointed over the quality. $8 for a small yogurt that was mushy and hot fudge that literally looked like old play dough! My husband ordered a fresh juice and like his, but still way more expensive than even nektar!",BFukGtNa_8ziL5hFEjenxg,0,0,1,CtBH_lj_F2-wuuTl7SnHCw
5351192,2017-11-09,0,lzQxNWlUVXJM2uqBeZafaQ,"Stopped into this smoothie shop before checking out from Ballys. 

Located in the basement of the property in a food court. The food court is located steps away from the properties sports book area.

Ordered an Acia Blast smoothie. This business offers quick bites and fruit dishes. A healthier alternative to some offerings in the food court.

After a short wait the order was ready. Chilled, flavorful and sweet. This smoothie was a great choice.

I might have had a few small brain freezes from drinking it so quickly. 

Would recommend this as a great morning smoothie option and an especially yummy treat on a hot Nevada day.",Egv8MOT_0py6Bb5TAF56Pg,0,0,4,2PDQZZ9OC6xp2zb5X78BwQ
5660858,2017-11-11,0,lzQxNWlUVXJM2uqBeZafaQ,"It's frozen yogurt, frozen blends drinks, and other deserts.  So what can you expect?  Very good.  Especially late at night in Vegas. Hits the spot.  Located right next to the food court and sports book in the lower level of Bally's.  And if you want a frozen, icey, spiked with liquor beverage, they have that too.",7JRfhqAFaSP4Ix7jCQBsIw,0,0,4,k8nthULiSPHyNoRAedCrnA
