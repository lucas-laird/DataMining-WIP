Honestly I eat a bagel once every six months but I do stop by here per husband request which has been about five times the past 1.5 years.

They are nothing compared to NY but they are better than Fresh and Easy/Smiths kosher...not even sure what to compare them to. They are not those thick doughy things from Trader Joes, but they are not like the Bagel Cafe places either.

They are light a almost crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. Boiled but maybe prior frozen? Can't figure it out.

As far as having eggs in them, none of them do EXCEPT for the egg bagel that is clearly marked. 
She told me that they don't use those crazy dough conditioners (human hair or duck/chicken feathers, yes that what most generics use!) so these bagels are actually vegan. 

The service here is always very nice, the lady is always eager to help.

I just wish that here in the medical district area/Alta loop they would step up their game because they could get A LOT of business. For petes sake the Starbucks next door does millions a year! and that's sad.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,7,4,3,h40RGgoizmipQ1vF9ghHzw

Maybe there are consistency issues, but the two bagel sandwiches I've had here have been solidly fresh and tasty.

But if we're focusing on the bagel itself, they're misshapen with oddly large holes. Good chew, fresh taste, and a few different varieties of schmear available (strawberry, scallion, jalapeno, and more). I tend to stick with Asiago, Everything, or Onion bagels, and those have worked out fine for me. The bagels here aren't bad, but they're not going to take you on a mental trip to the Big Apple unless you also drop some acid.

I still think your best bet for a large, perfect bagel is the Bagel Caf√©, but in a pinch this spot will do for breakfast or lunch. Favorite pick is the Empire State, but I sub scallion cream cheese for the mayo and add sprouts. I've never tried the gyro part of the menu.

When I first moved to Vegas and began working, I needed to find a solid bagel place that is close to my office.  New York Bagel Deli & Gyros popped up on my Google Maps.  I was skeptical at first...a bagel and gyro place rolled into one...in a relatively shady-esque, crowded strip mall.  Hmmm.  Unfortunately, there was no other bagel place nearby at all, so I decided to give it a shot, and I'm sure glad I did! It might not be the best bagel I've ever had, but it sure is the best bagel place I've been to in Vegas so far! They have a solid assortment of bagels and a variety of sandwiches and spreads.

There's a huge poster in the entrance that advertises their $3 special for bagel with cream cheese and coffee. Bingo! I made my way in to divulge in their special. The dining area isn't anything extravagant, it's just what you need with lots of tables and chairs. Walking up to the order stand, I was quite disappointed to see that three-fourths of their bagel selection wasn't available. It was 10:50 AM so I wasn't sure that they just sold out of everything earlier in the morning or if they don't offer a large selection as listed. I opted for a simple blueberry bagel with cream cheese. 

Unlike Einstein Brothers where you can see the preparation of your food, this place has a huge wall from the order stand to the cashier's stand so preparation isn't visible. Whatever, I figure you can't mess up a bagel with cream cheese. They toasted my bagel (I didn't ask for this but I think I'd be annoyed if I didn't want it toasted) so that it had a nice crunch. But the bagel had absolutely no flavor. Blueberries? Nah, this bagel had me scratching my head wondering where the blueberry good ran off to.

They serve regular coffee as well as vanilla flavored coffee. Their vanilla coffee was pretty good, can't complain about that. 

As the name states, this place serves gyros and deli sandwiches. Their ""New York"" bagels didn't impress me so I'm not sure if I'll be back anytime soon to try other items on their menu.  Sad face.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,2,0,2,Ji8_hqJ7DEJWAgNjgk8XoA

If I'm being honest, there are better bagels in Las Vegas. For me though, bagels and cream cheese make up the entire package completing the experience, and NY bagel bakery has probably the best cream cheese I've ever tasted.  Like many of my reviews, my opinion is affected greatly by the hot and spicy options available at a given establishment. The jalape√±o cream cheese offered here is perfect. Just spicy enough to provide a great kick without compromising the fresh taste of the already delicious cream cheese.

Despite what I said about better bagels elsewhere in Vegas, these are quite good. You can tell they make them fresh and the flavor and consistency is the way a great bagel ought to be. 

There's a large sandwich menu for breakfast and lunch and they even have salads. I haven't tried anything except the bagels but given the outstanding quality of the food, I'm pretty sure I'll try it someday.

I used to go to Einstein's bagels but this place has better food and the prices are even a little better. The guy who owns it is an awesome dude as well, been coming here for years now. Often times I just go in and ask him to make me whatever he feels like making, which is easy for me cause I like all food, and end up with the best sandwich I've ever eaten for like 8 bucks. (If you do that be sure to leave a good tip!) Favorite place for breakfast or lunch, these guys are rad.

My goto breakfast sandwich is like the mushroom swiss breakfast bagel with added veggies, plus sundried tomato cream cheese and bacon on an everything bagel. So basically all veggies in an egg omelette with bacon and the sundried tomato cream cheese really kicks it off.

I think it is quite popular in the mornings, because when I arrived around Noon a majority of the bagels were all gone. I noted they sell day-old bagels bagged up for $3 a pop. I will consider coming back here for those, maybe on a Friday so I can take them home for weekend breakfasts.

Pretty simple gist to this place: bagels, bagel sandwiches (lunch and breakfast variety), plus they do a gyro sandwich and a gyro platter. I went for the gyro sandwich. I mean, it was OK, it wasn't the BEST gyro I've had, nor was it the worst. I am thankful they didn't completely douse it in tatziki sauce. 

I think you may want to contemplate this mantra before coming here, ""You get what you pay for."".

4655089,2014-10-26,4,L6kFtq-C4dJJZJGk5Q8vRw,"3.5 STARS for a NEW YORK BAGEL SHOP in BRIGHT LIGHT CITY

  The New York bagel is a part of my heritage. Unfortunately my heritage is on the other side of the continent. The next best thing to paying at least $800 round trip to fly between Vegas and New York plus parking, car rental, and taking time off is to patronize a Big Apple bagel shop in Bright Light City. New York Bagels does a good job of bringing me to a New York State of Mind. 

  The New York bagel is as rare as a snow blizzard in Las Vegas. I only know of three New York style bagel shops in Vegas. They are Bagel Cafe, Harry's Bagel mania, and New York Bagels. 

  Recently I have left Vegas for a New York bagel experience on three ocassions when I was in the area of Springs Preserve. On each occasion I ordered a different bagel sandwich. In three visits I'd experience a delicious toasted poppy seed bagel with lox, tomatoes, onions, and cream cheese, a toasted poppy seed bagel with egg salad, and a toasted sesame bagel with bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. The lox sandwich is my favorite. I love lox on a toasted bagel. Maybe it is a biased taste that brings me back to my elementary school years sitting with my grandparents at the table enjoying a lox sandwich breakfast. Biting into the lox sandwich brought me miles and ages away from Rancho at Charleston. My second favorite sandwich is the egg salad. Biting into the Bagel overflowing with delicious egg salad brought me back to my twenties, enjoying breakfast in a New York bagel shop. And the BLT brought me into the adjacent Starbuck's to enjoy the sandwich with a cup of Starbuck's coffee. The New York bagel shops never served premium coffee. This one is not an exception. The Coffee is decent. It is nothing that has a bad taste  like it came out of Lake Mead or a premium taste like it came from Starbuck's or Einstein Bagels. Einstein has New York beat on coffee. Anyways a delicious bagel sandwich and Starbuck's is a great marriage of sandwich and beverage. 

  New York Bagel is a self serve bagel shop unlike Bagel Cafe. There is a menu board on top of the Bagel case. The majority of sandwiches with a coffee will come up to less than $10. When you decide on what you want, you tell the friendly person working here your order and a few minutes later it is ready. There is sufficient seating in New York Bagels. There was never a dirty table in the room. At the corner is a rack where people are free to read the local free newspapers. 

  Just like my New York Heritage, I am a bit vocal. I will state my minor complaints slash constructive criticism. To start off, there are some sandwiches with the corresponding prices are omitted. The Bagel potpourri scent that I am accustomed to in the New York bagel shop is missing here. The bagels are not as soft, warm, and in all honesty as delicious as the New York bagel shops of yesteryear. The side item that is omnipresent at the New York bagel shop is air here. I used to love the slice pickle and potato salad or macaroni salad that went with my New York bagel sandwich. I enjoy taking a few bites from the sandwich then the potato or macaroni salad. This is like having a hamburger without fries. My ultimate vocal is addressing the fact that the Bagel case was in want of critical varieties at noontime on Sunday, October 26, 2014. My fellow New York friend wanted me to pick up either a pumpernickel or salt bagel. Both of them were out. 

  New York Bagels is one of three bagel shops that I currently know of that are as close as Las Vegans will get to the New York bagel experience. Under the neon of Bright Light City it momentarily brings me across the continent to the Big Apple. With that said I support a part of my heritage by bestowing New York Bagels with 3.5 stars.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,3,4,3,C6Awg-4krCjyYSu_4YR0Pg

My office gets bagels every Friday for the staff.

That is why we stopped getting bagels from here for our weekly bagel day.  It is clear that the person making the bagels does not know the way to properly make a NYC style bagel.
