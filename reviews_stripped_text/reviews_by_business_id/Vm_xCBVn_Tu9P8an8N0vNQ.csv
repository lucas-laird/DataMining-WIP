My bf and I have been here about 5 times and always get great service! The prices did go up though, but that's understandable because of the oil leak. 

A lbs of shrimp is $12.95 
a lbs of clams was $11.95 
Soft shell crab $9.95 same

The service was awful:
~ waiter forgot our ""Cajun"" fries
~ our order came out with at least 10 minutes between everyone's dishes
~ the waiter's English got shaky when we asked which flavor our shrimp were and complained about a mix up

Although the shrimp are bigger, they don't compare to the bag of goodness the waitstaff delivers at the REAL crawfish place! Hot and Juicy is worth the wait...don't waste your time wit bad imitations",AcXyWMvw0n7e-_AucJrnxw,1,0,1,pAB8TfR8o3gdxAqPxffUvQ

I REEEEEEEALLY wanted to like this place.  I like to mix up my routine and not just go to one seafood restaurant all the time (Hot N Juicy Crawfish) HOWEVER, I would not come back here, even if someone paid me to.  I ordered my usual mild crawfish with all seasonings and got a bowl half full of frozen (the legs and antennae were all broken off) crawfish.  There was no seasoning, just some water at the bottom of the bowl with limp onion pieces.  I asked for a side of spicy garlic butter sauce and that helped a little bit but does not change the fact that the crawfish was not fresh.  The corn that came with my crawfish had no seasoning either and tasted like it was old or had freezer burn or something.  Bleh. I also ordered the large fried shrimp which granted were actually pretty big but sadly not battered??  The fries were just ok.  I will take my Texas born and raised self over to Hot N Juicy where even though it's not real ""louisiana style"" it's still flavorful and infinity times better then this place.  I also got a 10% off discount I guess cuz it had just opened when I went but yea.  Thanks but no thanks.",PQ6-FZpUn2oFLyBGvdiG3w,0,0,1,XacJWFl8-15bePPnHP81NQ
808458,2010-08-21,0,Vm_xCBVn_Tu9P8an8N0vNQ,"We came here with an open mind since there are many negative reviews about this place and we want to be our own judge.

Unfortunately, just like most reviewers here have experienced.  Don't waste your money and time here...go to Hot N Juicy.   Everything is better at Hot N Juicy EXCEPT their soft shell crab basket is a little better than HnJ.  

Service:  They don't seem to know what you are talking about.  We asked about the market price on one of the special crab, the answer was, ""I don't know what the price is... plus we don't have it anymore anyway"".  10 minutes later.. saw another table that came after us ordered a bunch of those crab.  Asked for a Sapporo, never came, finally came, but a different kind of beer, and said they don't have Sapporo or most of the beer on the menu.  One main dish (cajun clam) came out when we were about to finish the whole meal.  

Food: Shrimp are big...but tough texture and seemed very overcooked. Plus their items (shrimp, clams) didn't come in a bag like HnJ, so flavors aren't mixed and steamed together.  Corn and potatoes are on a separate plate with 0 flavor.  And the corn was cold in the middle like some other reviewers were saying.  

Overall, we came in with an open mind and walked away disappointed.  We want this place to be good and do well, but they didn't deliver.  Staff was friendly, but not very good at servicing people.  

The only good thing about this place is it's on restaurant.com, so we were able to save $50 off by using the certificate.  Didn't have to pay very much for the unpleasant dinner.

I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about, but this place is by far better than Hot n' Juicy.  He/she must've been drunk that night of their dining experience.  

The service was excellent--the staff were all friendly.  And hey, they DO speak English!

The restaurant was very clean and even the restrooms.  I've been to other crawfish restaurants such as the Boiling Crab and Hot 'n Juicy where their restrooms were disgusting and infested with germs that you can breath while eating your yummy-goodness food!  This place was cleaaaaaan and their restrooms actually smell nice.

I took one star out because I still prefer Boiling Crab over this place.  And they have this intense lobster-colored painted wall that makes it difficult for the eyes to adjust.  Also, their spicy-ness factor is a couple of levels higher than normal.  I can usually take a Medium (at most), but the Mild was already spicy enough.  

I really recommend this place.  They hold up to the Hot 'n Juicy competition because Cajun Crawfish's foods are BOMB and JUICIER!

Our waiter did forget our order also and your food comes out a few minutes apart not the complete order.  The soft shell crab was greasy and yes the corn on cob overcooked. The crab legs with garlic and butter was so salty that we left it. Coupons are a good way to experience something new..that a hint and read reviews first. I was sadly disappointed.

Our server brought out the sodas, but my Blue Moon was no where in sight. She comes back a few minutes later to tell me that they were out of Blue Moon...so disappointed already.

What we ordered:

2 lbs crawfish - 1 lb house special sauce/1 lb garlic butter sauce
1 lb shrimp - garlic butter sauce
snow crab - garlic butter sauce
sweet potato fries
extra corn/potato

The crawfish was ok. The corn was cold on the inside. We didn't get our potatoes. We told our server that we didn't get our potatoes. She came back a couple minutes later to confirm that we did not get our potatoes...wtf?!! She goes back to tell the manager again and returns to tell us that they are out of potatoes and stands there for a minute without saying anything. I said, ""it's ok"" and she finally walks away. The sauce with the shrimp was good, but the shrimp were over cooked and tough. The crab legs come and they are not pre-cracked for us. I have to flag down a server to ask for crackers. 

This place has been open for a while now...why are the servers so inexperienced? Why do they not have potatoes or Blue Moon on a Friday night? If you don't have potatoes, shouldn't you tell the server to ask the customer if they would like something else.

The flavor of the crawfish is truly there.  The shrimp were massive and delicious!  I loved the seasoning on the blue crab!

I've been really hesitant to because eating crawfish is so much work for so little reward, but my girl friends from Canada were in town and they love crawfish so I decided to take them.  Mind you, I WAS going to take them to Hot n Juicy first because everyone talks about it, but it was a 30-40 minute wait, we were all hungry....we weren't waiting.  So we headed over to Canjun Crawfish.  No wait, sat down right away.  You could tell it was a family own business, it was very odd atmosphere.  LCD screens throughout the place showing sports and other channels.  Paper menus like they printed out on their computer, but you know what?  Who cares! The food was awesome! 4 girls ate 10 lbs of food!
3 lbs of canjun clams (mild, the shrimps are HUGE!) 
1 lb of shrimp house special (medium)
6 lbs of crawfish (garlic butter - didn't have much taste) (2 lbs cajun mild) (3 lbs of house special medium)  the house special is canjun + Garlic butter.  

A few days later i was craving crawfish at work so i googled the restaurant and found out they did take out, ordered it 15 minutes before I got off work, by the time I got there it was all ready for me.  

Atmosphere isn't the greatest, but if you're with  bunch of good friends, who cares?  It doesn't have a dirty feel when you walk in.  You know how when you walk into some restaurants and you're just feel gross and everything just feels dirty?  Not this place at all.  Picture a wharehouse feel with long tables and chairs.  I was a bit disappointed when they didn't have crab, but hey whatever, we made do with what they did have.  Definitely looking forward to the next time.

07/23/10:  Need to revise my stars and my review.  Went here with a bunch of friends that had never been.  My first experience was awesome, but this time was very disappointing.  Went with a group of 5 ppl, we sat down, ordered and waiting.  1 friend joined us a few minutes later and ordered.  Food starts to come out, the person that came late finally gets his order....the person sitting next to me looks around and says where's my food?  Called the waiter over and asked him where his order was.  Waiter says, you didn't order anything.  I made a comment, he sat down with us and I distinctively heard him ask how hot was the hot while he was ordering, how can you get the guy that walked in late's order but not his? He offered to put the order in right away, but my friend was already pissed.  One friend ordered the shrimp, it was way overcooked.  Mine didn't taste the same as it did the first time, so I called the waiter over and he said they changed the recipe to not be so soupy.  I was like but that's why I liked it?  Long story short, we all left VERY dissatisfied.  I to this day get blamed for a crap dinner.",0CRdDT9v9kNDDQ69AIqwZA,1,0,2,cpKrYwtZAYLRY4sPoPAvZQ

At first, I wasn't too happy with the fact that they didn't have the mayo.  My bf has a sauce that he makes that uses mayo as one of the ingredient to make the best sauce ever to dip those little crawfish tails into.  However, after tasting the crawfish, no sauce was needed.

This place definitely has different flavors than that of HnJ, but I love it!
We (the two of us) ordered 4lbs of the medium house special and 2 lbs of the medium house special shrimps.  They were all so FRESH and flavorful.  I was never a shrimp kind of girl, but this place made it so yummy, that I actually prefer the shrimp over the crawfish!

My friend and I used a restaurant.com coupon, which saved us $25 on our $35 bill, so could we really go wrong??
We ordered the shrimp with the house special sauce (a mix of garlic butter and cajun sauce), crab legs in garlic butter, a potato and corn. The only complaint I really have is that the corn seemed over-cooked and looked... well... over-cooked.  Otherwise, I have no real complaints. Now, at places like this, the shrimp is served with its head. Seeing the faces of my food has never been a sought after experience for me, but... eh...  Here's to new experiences.  Once de-headed, the shrimp was good, albeit just a hair over done.  Still yummy in its garlicky-spicy sauce.  The show-stealer, though, was the crab legs.  DELICIOUS.  Have you ever licked the OUTSIDE of a crustacean?  Yeah, that good.  This sauce was out of this world!  Butter, garlic, garlic, garlic.  I believe I took a butter bath.  One of those experiences where you look up afterward, shake your head a little and try to remember where exactly you are.  

So, perfect?  No.  Worth a try?  I would definitely say yes - especially if you choose to bathe with the crab legs in garlic butter.",sM0FJN2NfXBmPjOgz7tv-g,3,1,3,EHq4-8X1V6pIElmwG7CB4A

Decided to go here instead of to its competitor Hot N Juicy Crawfish because this place accepts Restaurant.com coupons.  Specifically wanted the cajun clams, the fresh shrimp, the crab legs.  Got there around 8pm on Sunday, for the fresh seafood, all they had was the clams, the blue crabs and the dungeness crabs.  They had crawfish but those were frozen (and not as good as the fresh ones).  

Ended up ordering a pound of cajun clams, the calamari basket, the butterfly shrimp basket and an order of sweet potato fries.  The cajun clams were awesome!!!!  The other stuff was just OK.  Total bill (food & tax) came out to $40.  With the $25 restaurant.com coupon, the total amount spent was $19 (This amount included the tip already).  Not a bad for some good seafood.

Gotta admit, we went over to Hot n Juicy Crawfish first but they were so busy and had an hour wait that we decided to go to Cajun Crawfish as a backup plan because we were really looking forward to havin' some Crawfish and we were HUNGRY so we didn't want to wait for an hour. I used to love Hot n Juicy, we used to go there when it first opened, when we'd be the ONLY patrons in the establishment... But ever since they were on Man vs. Food, we practically have no desire to go there because of the f'n wait!!! But enough about them, this is about Cajun Crawfish, my bad... 

We were a little hesitant because we had expectations about our Crawfish considering we LOVE seafood... But we kept an open mind, our motto is ""We try it once, if we don't like it, we never come back"". 
We were greeted right away and the staff was really nice. As we were waiting for our food, I decided to Yelp the place on my phone. Unfortunately the reviews were no bueno but again, we kept an open mind and my husband reminded me of our motto. It's a small restaurant but they have the capability to accommodate large parties. We ordered Crawfish and crab legs. Some of the reviews mentioned that the Crawfish were small, it wasn't the case the night that we came in, there was a mixture of big and medium sized ones. I LOVE garlic, that's why I was always a fan of Hot n Juicy but I always hated how I'd smell like garlic for days, no matter how many times I wash my hands, lemon I use, or how hot the water is when I clean my hands... That wasn't the case here, there was enough garlic flavor but not so much so that I'd smell for days, which was AWESOME because we were meeting up with friends after wards so I didn't wanna smell like I was swimming in garlic! Which, BTW, I didn't! 

I don't see too many negatives about this place, even though there are a lot of negatives, but we have returned a couple times after our initial visit... Except maybe, they can work on their decor? I kind of feel like I'm at a generic Chuck E. Cheese with that rinky dink mural, no offense CC!

Ordered - 
1lbs Crawfish -Medium House special style
1bls Shrimp -Mild house special style
1/2 Dozen Blue Crab

First of all, the Crawfish was right on point.  And what I mean is that the flavor is IN the crawfish meat and not disguised by 1 gallon of liquid flavoring. (Unlike other places)  Btw, I'm ordering mild next time.  LOL

Secondly, the Shrimp.  IN-CRED-DIBLE!  Huge as S&%T.  Like Shrimp of viagra.  Not none of this frozen walmart bullc$#p they serve you at other places.  (ehhmmm....Hot N Juicy)

Thirdly, Blue Crab was pretty good as well.  They sprinkled it with some spicy crack that made you want more even when your mouth was blistering hot!

I have to admit that this place needs to work on faster service.  But its better than waiting an hour at .....ehhhmmm.....""other places""

I would definitely recommend this place over.....ehmmm.....""other places"" especially if you don't mind NOT eating at a place that paid to be on TV.

4974450,2010-01-25,0,Vm_xCBVn_Tu9P8an8N0vNQ,"I'm all for a little competition in the crawfish world - but Cajun Crawfish is definitely not up for the challenge.  I was super hesitant with all the negative reviews, but still kept in open mind.

It's a large restaurant space with additional seating in the back around the corner with TVs abound  However, it's a pretty sterile environment, blame it on the high ceilings.

We started out with two pounds of Crawfish ($9.99/lb) with their House Special seasoning and Medium spice level.  (They have a warning that says their ""spicy level is two levels higher than normal"".)  The Husband did ask ahead of time if the crawfish was big and fresh, and the waitress said it was.  She also pointed out the tank in the back so we could have a look.  (I did walk over there to take a peek and noticed they had lobster and clams in the tanks too.)  You also get one side of corn and potato for order two pounds or more of crawfish.

When our order arrived in a silver bowl, we noticed a difference right away.  This wasn't the way we wanted our crawfish, and that was our mistake.  The Husband asked for some lime, salt and pepper to make a dipping sauce, but that couldn't help this crawfish.  Sure, they were large, but they were also dried out.  There was no head juice to suck out at all.  When you break the head off, you can tell there's something wrong immediately.  And the sauce in the bottom of the bowl is this watered down concoction of something or other.  I don't think it's as fresh as they say it is, the ones in the tank are just for show I think!    

The staff were friendly, and really anxious to refill our beverages.  But it couldn't make up for the sad crawfish.  We left after our two pounds and headed up Spring Mountain for Hot N Juicy Crawfish instead.  

We didn't order the famous shrimp that gets all the ravings, but did see some on someone else's table, and they were large indeed.  But then again, this restaurant is called Cajun Crawfish, not Cajun Shrimp. 

I did ask if they had any grand opening specials (especially since other yelpers mentioned it), but we were told they weren't offering them anymore.  However, I did notice an ad offering a discount on beverages just the other day.   Oh well.

Overall, Cajun Crawfish doesn't measure up for good crawfish the way I like it.  Sorry.

5496887,2009-11-23,7,Vm_xCBVn_Tu9P8an8N0vNQ,"It takes a lot to seriously make me hate any dining experience. This place did just about everything it could think of to make me wish I never used an iphone app to find it. 

I went to Vegas this weekend to enjoy UFC 106 with some close friends. After Forrest Griffin made me happy I decided to top off the evening with something like The boiling Crab or the Crab hut. I used my friend's iPhone to find the nearest spot for us to indulge in some Cajun goodness. We got in a cab and hurried over to Cajun Crawfish. We arrived to find the place almost empty. We were sat and the waiter returned with our drinks. We ordered our usual and waited for about 15 minutes only to have the waiter return to our table to tell us they were out of corn on the cob....whaaaat?? ok ok ok...I can deal with that. But then we waited about another 30 minutes only to be confronted with the most flavorless crawfish and shrimp I have ever tasted in my life! Our potatoes come and they have no seasoning anywhere and are waaay undercooked. We sent the potatoes back to be cooked longer and they were still under cooked when the waiter brought them back. We ordered some steamed white rice and even that was horrible....how do you screw up rice? The sausage was undercooked, the crawfish was over cooked and lacked any flavor except spice. the shrimp was ok at best...a tad over cooked but still...ok. We tried to tell the female waitress about the potatoes and the rice only to find she doesn't speak English, so we were then stuck playing charades with the girl. After we were finished with our disaster of a dinner...we asked for wet naps. The lemon scented ones tend to cut the fishy smell out of your hands. Guess what?? No wet naps. 

We agreed to call it quits for the evening and head back to the hotel. We asked the waiter to call a cab.....after asking every employee in the joint ""Do we have cab number?"" we decided to make use of the iphone once again and called our own cab. 

We waited outside for our cab and noticed the sign for Cajun Crawfish stated ""Grand Opening"". Well, I don't know about ""grand"" but I guess the place is new. So here is my advice to the owners....shut down for a week and visit The Boiling Crab in LA area. Notice the flavor, the decor, the hospitable service, the flavor and the flavor or their food. Then come back to Vegas and regroup. There is no point in owning a below average establishment like this. When you have visitors that know what their food is supposed to taste like and visit your restaurant with certain expectations....they are just going to leave seriously unhappy and are going to tell all their friends about their piss poor experience. Not trying to be mean...but Cajun Crawfish is way under par. 

Cajun Crawfish failed to deliver...in EVERY way possible. I will not go back and I will make sure that no one I care about makes the same mistake I did by going here. Waste of time, waste of money and there was a risk of food poisoning with the whole undercooked sausage thing. It's clear this place doesn't care about the quality of their food....looks like they are just happy enough to be open and have anyone walk through their doors.

The waiter told us that they had a Grand Opening Special of 20% off entrees and a buy one get one free soda, with free refills.  For the drink, try the Sweetened Green Tea.  Not too sweet and compliments with the spicy seafood.

The special of the day was dungeness crab.  We didn't get it as it was $14.95/lb.  Instead we ordered 3 lbs of shrimp in a medium sauce, house special style and the catfish dinner.  We also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, some rice bowls, corn and bread.  I agree with Andy R.  OMG - the shrimp were huge from its head to its tail - as big as the distance between your thumb and your index finger!!  The shrimp were as thick as your thumbs!!!  They were indicated on the menu as Gulf Atlantic Shrimps.  I think they were just huge Tiger Prawns.  Make sure you order some rice and some bread to sop up the delicious sauce.  The sauce was unfortunately too little but we managed to sop up every little bit of sauce.  The sauce had roughly chopped up onions in it.   The rice was so fragrant; I think it's jasmine rice.  Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm!  We wanted more shrimp so we ordered another lb of shrimp, this time with spicy sauce.  The spicy sauce this time had a bit of kick in it and it tasted better.

The waiter was very helpful, pleasant and quick to serve.  

Would we go back?  Sure, for that size of shrimp and the spicier sauce!

Take advantage of the Grand Opening Special of 20% off entrees.  It really helps!!!!",EsOu51dW3UTDJTApBxwz2g,11,2,4,I7o0qeT5IjlXKYzOGRucmQ

We had been to HnJ several times in the past, driving right past Cajun Crawfish (CC), due to previous poor Yelp reviews. We're glad that we took the chance, and would definitely come again.

12 of us rolled in around 9 p.m. (this place is open until  midnight on a Sunday night).  We were seated right away in the back area, near the Karaoke and the dart boards.  A fish tank was present, storing live crabs and crawfish.  The kiddies got a kick out of watching them swim about.

We ordered what we would normally order at HnJ--2 lbs crawfish each, medium or spicy, house special sauce. I changed it up a bit, getting a fresh dungeness crab. I was surprised and pleased to see that they grabbed a crab from the tank--nothing like fresh seafood.

The wait time was short, and the food piping hot.  The broth used to season/spice up the offerings was more souplike, rather than pasty like HnJ, and very flavorful.  Dipping the Cajun fries in the soup is a must, as is dipping the corn and potatoes into the broth. We asked for separate bowls of just broth, and ended up pouring most of it into the bag of leftovers that accompanied us home.

Complaints:

The chicken wings and chicken tenders did NOT come with fries.
The darts are pretty beat up, and lost their fins midflight.

Pretty minor complaints, i know, but thought i'd throw it out there.

We initially went in with HnJ on our minds.  If you seek to compare the two, there is no comparison--they are just different, with different flavors.  If you go with an open mind, and just expect good, flavorful seafood, you'll get it at Cajun Crawfish.",jfG6Tgnw3xFfIOaSZakSUQ,7,1,4,bewRaX3tVsXGHYkBtax9Ow
