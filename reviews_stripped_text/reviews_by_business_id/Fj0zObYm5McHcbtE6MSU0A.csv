45613,2015-01-30,0,Fj0zObYm5McHcbtE6MSU0A,I orders the family dinner A and had it delivered . It says $23.95 but once you get done it's $31.95 plus tip . I was very unhappy with the food . The chow mein was greasy and tasteless with huge chunks of purple onion and what look like tiny thin strips of lunch meat in it . The orange chicken has pieces of red pepper skin and was horrible . The Kung Pow chicken had mushy over cooked veggies in it . Also has egg flower soup which I did not even bother to try . Over all it was not good at all . Worst Chinese I've ever had . Was so let down about the chow mein . I hope they read these and change there food .,gowY3sV2WP5xWLY939nzTA,1,0,2,Z6CGSPAOrvICex1Tk_GrmA

446281,2014-06-28,1,Fj0zObYm5McHcbtE6MSU0A,"We order from here frequently and the food is pretty consistently good. Lately, the food has been piping hot and fresh. It doesn't taste like someone's incorrect order was reheated and stuffed in a to-go box. Sometimes you order fried rice from a restaurant and it tastes old, dry, and looks way too dark. I'v e never had that problem here. The combination fried rice is a staple in my household.

I love the green tea smoothie and original milk tea. The boba pearls are hit and miss. Sometime they are smooth and chewy perfection, sometime they are hard and gritty on the inside... Try your luck if you enjoy boba, when it's good, it's good!

I tried the curry chicken, but it was mostly quarters of green bell pepper and and white onion floating in a very thin, almost watery curry sauce. There were literally two nickel sized pieces of chicken in it... It was so ridiculous that I'm sure someone didn't stir the batch well or something, because I wouldn't have expected that type of entree to be passed off on me here.

Try the mongolian beef, hot garlic chicken or shrimp, green bean chicken, kung pao chicken or shrimp, combination fried rice, Taiwanese mei fun, or bbq pork.",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,3,0,4,Mif7wdeNvATcbNFe7a6U8g

However I can understand if in other people's eyes it's a 4 star and it's good to them, then it can be ranked highly. Maybe they didn't have the delicious Chinese food I've had in my life. To start, the chicken satay was so dry and tough. The egg roll was thick with that overwhelming thick wrapper filled with a ton of clear noodles. I didn't care for the taste either. The fried rice was bland and they gave me the wrong one. The waiter said it was his first day. The fried veggie tofu dish wasn't bad. I didn't care for the overly sweet & sour chicken. The service was lacking. They never checked on us.

I've been coming here for so many years and every time I walk through that door they greet me with a kindness I don't experience from many places. 
    Some of my favorite dishes to get there are the Singapore Noodles ( amazing curry flavor with pork, chicken and shrimp), the House Chicken ( a nice house sauce they use with a little bit of a kick), combination fried rice (pork, chicken and shrimp, ordering it extra spicy is the way to go though), cucumber salad ( very flavorful, but they put a lot of sesame oil if you're not into that) and the snap pea and shrimp is very light and filling. They also have very cheap lunch and dinner specials. For dinner they have about 8 items to choose from, which comes with a beverage, egg roll, fried rice or noodles and a soup all for $7.99...can't beat that. As for the boba drinks, they are very good!

Also this time (3rd or 4th?) they gave us a menu and this makes it easier to order next time. Our go to when we're lazy :) or especially craving boba lol





My boyfriend and I ordered a honey peach and honeydew slush, two spam musubis, and it was more than $10 we got free (2) egg rolls. The ordering was easy on the app and it took about 30 minutes to get here which wasn't bad. 

Honey peach slush just tasted like regular peach, didn't really taste any honey. My boyfriend liked it though

Honeydew slush tasted great, kind of wish we asked for boba. :(

I personally prefer the spam musubi to have equal spam and rice but this was okay, it had more rice than I liked but then again it's personal preference. 

Egg rolls had vegetables in them, crunchy, dipped them in the sweet sauce 

Will be ordering slushes w/ boba or the milk tea next time!",b-3F8GtMVzkeNZnafutc6Q,0,0,5,Utu9C6FajZRmOhQLi3X-1g
3489699,2013-12-29,1,Fj0zObYm5McHcbtE6MSU0A,"This is some of the WORST chinese food I have ever consumed.  I don't say that lightly.  The service was good, and the place was clean.  The food was simply terrible.  Orange chicken was essentially chicken nuggets in a syrupy, Tang colored, gelatinous substance.  The fried rice was not fresh.  The egg rolls reminded me of the ones you can get a Sam's club, not good.  If you need cheap crappy food, this would be the place to visit.",1zLY8lLAfUGvgIJjRH6Icw,3,0,1,UVWjVlzBKJh4bw0is41mYg

The coconut milk tea was good and I can't complain about it. But this place can not prepare boba for shit. The boba was so hard in the middle and they sweetened them as well. You are adding them to a sweet drink, more sugar on the boba is the last thing you need. The boba was actually sweeter than the watered down smoothie actually. I am willing to still try their food one day but if you are looking for good boba on the east side, don't stop here.",5v6LjnZ5rzl-ZBNvuMezSQ,0,0,3,OyxtA98UfPakB0lAXlZVQA

I had decided to give them a try based on the menu having thai food as well as the standard other choices. I was thoroughly impressed with the food. I ordered on (http://eat24hours.com) and they have coupons on there as well as no minimum amount spent for delivery. The prices are fair and the food is really good. I've had the eggrolls, the crab rangoons, and the Shrimp Pad Thai. Also, it normally says 45 minutes for delivery, but they show up within a half hour. The delivery driver is also very friendly.

4276870,2015-07-14,0,Fj0zObYm5McHcbtE6MSU0A,"Our absolute favorite Chinese/Thai place to eat on our side of town. I've been a patron since they were Express Wok but they've certainly come a long way! It's such a relaxed atmosphere every time we walk in and the woman who's always there (working her butt off) is always so sweet. They have a great dynamic in the kitchen, you can hear them communicating and even watch them because you have a clear view of the entire kitchen behind the register. They get the food out pretty quickly and always warm. Everything we've tried has been top quality and had amazing flavor, Boba and all. They even have things on their menu that you wouldn't usually find outside of China Town. They have new and interesting specials every time we go in and we can never walk out of there without getting something to go for later. We order so much they've given us free appetizers  on numerous occasions. If you're looking for great food for a great price you should go here! My only complaint is I wish they were open later, but I get it. :)",SUxMV1DpLvEIVQY5ecnD_Q,0,0,5,fxbhM_7GtKkdt_DL6zqqKQ

When I walk in the door I found out that all the staff are chinese so they better know what they are cooking right? Well they do.

We have since tried this place twice and I can honestly says to you that they have one of the best chow mein in the eastern area. The shrimp dishes however left a lot to be desire. First of all their honey walnut shrimp are not the real authentic honey walnut shrimp and on other occasion we found that the shrimp are smelly which means not fresh.

Other than that, they have great orange chicken and general tsos chicken. We love their kungpao dishes as well. Nice and friendly service, great deals and absolutely worth a try if you are happen to be in the area.",gm20Rasn38z5xdnd7_iM4g,0,0,4,fhj35hJtodTseCX4HmuLcw

I've eaten a LOT of Chinese food and this is literally the BEST I've ever had!! The prices are easy on the wallet, the service is wonderful, the place is super clean, and the food is to die for. This will be a new favorite spot and I would drive across the city just to eat here.
The portion sizes are generous for the prices too. The lunch specials are great. They even substituted for me because I wanted sesame chicken. I decided I didn't want the rice so instead of giving me the small portions they just upped it for me. Got a big plateful of chicken and chow me in, more than I could eat. The soup of the day was free, and we even got drinks. Walked out of there feeding two people for less than $15. 
I instantly was texting everyone I knew to come try this place out. Fantastic. I can't get enough!!

Been to this place half a dozen times already, taking everyone I know. It's our favorite place by far. My family drives across Vegas just to eat here. I'm in love with this place!",8fpiTkK4MO5jJIXHFV4t5Q,3,2,5,Fu7tQ8CBhGUgkLP1byvA6Q
