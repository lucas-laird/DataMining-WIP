You could taste the sub roll was homemade and fresh as well as the pizza dough. The white American cheese made the Cheese steak really tasty.

I recently had Grinder's cater our weekly business lunch and man did they deliver. Ordering was easy and they priced it perfectly. We had them bring 16 pizza's and 8 orders of wings. The pizza was perfect!  In fact, many of our employees made it a point to let me know that they loved the pizza!  They also said the wings were perfect... I love that they loved it. Makes it much easier to repeat the order in the future. 

I think I'm going to try some subs next time. 

As for pricing, I can tell you they are at the lower end of our weekly budget. These guys will work with you!  Can't wait for a couple weeks to pass so we can do it again!",piS8TYFOYnBYoYT4B5_x2w,0,0,5,JjmiIuw2vOybeMEtxA6TMQ

The crust was doughy. I couldn't tell you what the sauce tasted like because the cheese was incredibly thick and we did not order extra cheese. The pizzas were not cooked long enough, it was cooked long enough to melt the cheese but not to give it any color. The meat was limp.

No apology. No coupon. No attempt to make things right. They didn't even offer to make my food again. They just told me to sit down and see if the driver ever brought my food back (after it rode around town for a while getting cold and nasty).

Romans 10
8 But what does it say? ""The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ""Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame."" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.""",vxrdGO5QVQkRfIU-ds2uyQ,1,0,3,ZOrCIDLevUGpo5CqZ-cjKQ

Upon arriving we were greeted by the chef and sat at a table. The menu was simple but varied. 

We started with the calamari appetizer. The chef made it in the kitchen while we watched.  It was served with some lemon slices and some marinara sauce. I liked it with out the sauce. It was that tasty!  It was not at all greasy and had the perfect amount of flavor. 

Next we ordered a creation I like to call the back room pizza. We got a large red sauce (you can choose red or white) pizza with banana peppers, cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, tomato, spinach and topped it with Ricotta cheese.  When the chef delivered it, it looked like a work of art. You could tell he enjoyed making it.  The dough is a perfect balance between thin and thick. We like our pizza well done on the bottom but not overly cooked and Grinders delivered!  The first bite and we knew we had found a great pizza place!

The food was great, no complaints. The fries were better than McDonald's and in the same style... only without all the chemical additives. The 1/2 sandwiches are large enough that you' think they were WHOLE. So skimping here. The pizza was good too. Not too greasy.

My wife loved her B.L.T.. The beer was on point. There are a lot of activities and things that go on here so it's cool to stay tuned in.",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,2,1,5,w1a9fArdGxxHVVTHuqAv1g

As soon as we walked in the door, everyone behind the counter literally stopped what they were doing to look up to say hi and welcome us! 

Our server, Modest, gave us some of the best service we've ever had in Las Vegas, hands down!  Unfortunately, Las Vegas isn't necessarily known for its service culture, however, we felt welcomed like family, and Modest's easy-going affability made our experience truly memorable!

The Caesar salad was great; awesome Caesar dressing that tastes like it's made in-house. The pizza was phenomenal. We had bacon, onion, extra cheese. Flavors were fantastic, perfect ratio of sauce to ingredients, and the crust was cooked perfectly; not too crispy, nor too doughy! 

The overall feel of the restaurant is laid back and perfect for the casual night out we were seeking, the service is top-notch, and the food was fantastic, so we most definitely will be making it one of our regular dinner spots!

The one owner, I wish I knew his name, asked if we had been there before. We stated we had not. He went over his menu with us. The menu is small, but that is ok, I prefer that over a million choices. 
We chose a seat in this nicely decorated restaurant. I liked the feel of it. There was plenty of space between tables, a nice bar counter area. Very clean place.
We chose the cheese steak sandwich we got the whole sandwich and split it. It came with French fries. My husband also got a slice of cheese pizza. He also ordered one of the craft beers. 
The pizza beer and my soda came out fast. 
My husband enjoyed his slice. He stated great pizza. 
Our sandwich soon arrived and even half was huge. The fries a great size portion of golden crispness. 
The taste of the sandwich was delicious. I prefer American cheese on my steak sandwich that with the onions and wonderful bread, made a hearty meal. The half was too much for me. The sandwich could easily feed three people.
The owners were so kind explained all of the events they will have. We talked about we are all originally from.

The cheesesteak was pretty terrible. No flavor or taste at all. It was a slice of cheese melted on the bottom of the white bread roll and onions with unseasoned meat. No peppers or anything. I thin the salt that should have gone on the sand which was instead given to the crappy frozen French fries. Seriously, I had to scrape the salt off the fries and couldn't even finish them.
Also, my husband ordered a soda and it was flat and the syrup was not distributed evenly so I think the machine needed recalibration. But they did give him canned soda instead so that was nice of them.

I have always wanted to check out Grinders since right down the road from my house. My roommates have been there once and told me it was solid. Cheese pizza was on the menu so figure talk about the perfect timing. My first impression was kind of interesting set up cause really not much personality in the interior design. They do have one big widescreen hangs above the open kitchen area (if dine in can easily see anywhere), couple stand up chairs or lounge area (great spot if want see them do there magic making some pies, calzones, or whatever else on the menu), they had stand up refrigerator that they keep all the drinks (there nor fountain drinks it all by the can or bottle), and decent amount of seating for small restaurant. 

The cheese pizza got the large size to go. It was pretty good. Honest not much that goes into cheese pizza or ways that can mess it up. I have had bad ones just fyi. At Grinders the cheese pizza was solid. The crust was nice. It more think crust style pizza. The price you definitely get value for the size. 

The service was nothing but five stars. The gentlemen that took my order was friendly, positive vibes, and attentive. They also have free can of soda or drink that comes with check in. I found it little odd that he was like make good review..yay. It almost like they were not going honor the yelp check only if I do a review.

Myself and friend found this place cross from the my house . I have yet to find pizza that compares to my childhood NY favorites but this ranks among the best in Las Vegas. It's on par with pizza rock and is far bette than metro in my opinion. I don't care people who talk bad . I believe my self. Do you ever find yourself eating a meal that in just too good to waste with idle chatter? You just dig in and don't allow for interruptions until your done ? This was that! 
Our service was also outstanding. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. He gave us the perfect amount of attention. Before we last he made us aware of all the weekly specials and invited us back. Given the great food and service. 
We will come back for sure!!))",G61SZ9e2DgTtWUtgNNJHyw,0,1,5,NW_Mz-JbS31w2ALX4_q7TQ

We felt welcomed as soon as we opened the door. Warm friendly smiles and awesome aromas.

Modest was our server. I could write this entire review just about her. Loved her. 

We shared a Ceasar Salad, Chicken Philly and a Pizza. So much food, but so good. 
The Ceasars was pretty basic, but tasty. We both really enjoy the Philly and such a bonus that it was chicken. It was flavorful and on great bread. The pizza was NY style. Big slices that packed flavor and a great dough. Plus, you can buy it by the slice or pie and custom make!

Definitely will be going back.",emYBy7RoGURebNrG991pLQ,2,0,5,4QTf8L9TB0T0Tl8AxfR3-A

The pizza is really good! The dough isn't overly chewy, it's soft and tasty. I also tried the cheeseburger sub and it was just as good as all the reviews I read. I personally think that burger sub could also be made with pizza sauce and some onions and/or peppers and be awesome as well. The bread, I was over hearing, is made in house and with filtered water (I believe). It sounds as though every ingredient has been thoroughly thought out to include only the highest quality. I did pizza again today but only because I needed to get back to work. There are a couple other sandwiches I really want to try and because I'll be stuck on the same project for the next sixteen days, I assume I'll have plenty of time to try those.

Here's the thing: the guys working in there were completely friendly and helped me get in and out within the thirty minutes I was afforded on each occasion. The price was right, the place is nice inside, and my overall experience was just really good. I've driven past for months without a thought simply because previous tenants in that spot weren't my favorites but I'm glad I made it in.

I found this spot while searching for pizza and wings on a Saturday night. We arrived, ordered, and it took them about 20 minutes to get our food ready. Not bad, right? Also, it was the gentleman behind the bar that took our order and he was very polite.

We ordered pizza (large pep and sausage), wings, and calamari. The pizza was good. I was especially hungry at the time too, so that might affect my judgement, but it was good. It was a lot thinner than I usually like though. The wings were the best thing we had. Great flavor, but will definitely get soggy if left in the wing sauce too long (ours started to after just 15 minutes). I'll ask for wing sauce on the side next time. 

The calamari was the worst item we had. I love calamari and I have had it at almost every restaurant I've been to that serves it. First of all, it was soggy. Second of all, it tasted like it had no salt or pepper on it. It was just so lackluster and disappointing, especially since this item was raved about on Yelp reviews.

All of this came out of ~$45 and it was not worth it. Unfortunately, I probably won't go back. Maybe they were just having a bad day?",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,5,3,2,jqDQiMPdcw-GdNHm44YDlw

Figured this place would work because not only was it very close but it was unknown, so it wouldn't be too busy on such a popular pizza day. Ordered the Greek with white sauce. Amazing!

That was the beginning of February. Two months- only two months later- and they have changed their menu. They only offer individual slices or 16"" pies. They have changed everything to be cheese plus toppings. I believe it's new ownership/management. Otherwise it's at least new employees. I get that it happens. I do. So I swear the single star isn't just because of that. The single star is because when I called to order the employee could not understand me and I couldn't understand him. It's not just a thick accent, it's another language. And no attempt to put a different employee on the phone. So instead of a quick call, my husband has to physically drive over there to attempt to order in person. He gets there and calls me while attempting to order. I can hear that it's the same employee. My husband can't understand what he is saying either. He and the man have to use their arms and hands and point to attempt any communication. This is not appropriate, and definitely not functional. Put someone in the front of house who can communicate in English. That's all I ask.",75JufaPBXeYNxw8Ql7FyEw,2,0,1,oGGInZiYVJOOV1WfNKm4tw

My wife and I were in the Spring Valley area on Friday night, and she was in the mood for a calzone. She was browsing through their pictures, and she noticed that they only had calzones with ham and ricotta cheese. She wanted to confirm so she called in and the employee that picked up said that she can put whatever she wants inside the calzone. Hmmm. She also asked what kind of cheese it comes with, and oddly enough, he said it comes with mozzarella, not ricotta. Ok, we were hoping this guy was right, because he was also really rude and tried to rush us off the phone. So my wife ordered a calzone with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese, and when we arrived at the store to pick it up, the person that was making our calzone (looked like he could be the owner or manager) said that they are only accepting cash, because their card system is down. Wtf. When I asked him if they had an ATM machine, he looked at me all dazed and confused like I'm a foreigner in his country. Dafuq bro? No speak English? And seriously, you couldn't tell us this over the phone before we got to the store?

So listen, not only did we have to draw out cash and come back, but they made the calzone incorrectly. So intuitively, as soon as my wife picked up the calzone, she checked to see if they got her order right, and what do you know? It was a calzone with ham and ricotta cheese like in the pictures! LMAO. The rude worker who picked up the phone earlier said that they only make it with ham and ricotta cheese, and he denied of receiving any request for pepperoni and mozzarella cheese in the calzone. So you're gonna lie to us and not even apologize? Oh and also, the owner/manager just stood there, and told his employee to just forget us. WOOOOWW.

I mean I know delivery is expensive but that should be a crime to charge that much. Whatever, we patiently waited for our food and bit the bullet. When the food came the salad was missing the grilled chicken which is annoying because we were still charged for the grilled chicken. The mozzarella sticks were cold and the cheese inside was hard as if they had just come out of a refrigerator. The wings were breaded but soggy so it felt like you were biting through wet bread to get to the actual meat.

Everything is super fresh, great quality ingredients and the bread is made from scratch in-house daily. It's one of those places that's SO good you eat waaaay past the the point of being full! LITERALLY. 

I typically go with a traditional pepperoni, but if you're looking to live a little TRUST ME  and order the white pizza with spinach, garlic and ricotta. You won't be disappointed, it's ridiculously incredible!! Their pies are so huge I took the rest of the ""personal"" size home and (don't judge) had it for breakfast the next day. STILL DELICIOUS! Today I asked for a ""healthy"" pizza and wasn't disappointed. Perfectly toasty crust, hearty veggies and the most magically proportioned balance of cheese and sauce. I'm a happy girl! 

For the days you're not feeling pizza, you HAVE to try the pork sub with sautéed spinach and the cheeseburger sub. Both will make your head spin. Cheat day favorites for sure, especially since they offer beer and wine now. Perfect spot for happy hour!

Outside of the incredible food, the vibe is great too. It's like the Vegas version of Cheers which is pretty cool. You walk in and are greeted by a team that seems genuinely happy to be there, the owners are friendly and welcoming and there are already a ton of regulars who are greeted by name as they walk in.

On top of the roll already being hot, after the cheese was placed too, the ""cook"" placed it in the pizza oven to melt....again the sub should be cold!  Cheesesteak was cooked in a frying pan, not sure if they even had a flat top to cook on. Fries were not good at all. The calzone was not too bad, however pineapples looked like they were approaching the end of their freshness. Ketchup bottle was on counter, empty. They knew this because we were given packets with our order. Not once were we asked how things were or checked on.

4595749,2015-03-21,0,DTz6gFeWmdvSEIFGjXpIgQ,"I read about this place several months back on Vegas Chatter.  My Eureka moment, was, ""Wow this place is right down the road!"" Russell and Rainbow.  What a gem this has turned out to be.  Rick and John are the proprietors and like other posts are in fact from Philly.  They have taken this transient strip mall and made it a stopping point for your Spring Valley travels.  (The Euro deli a few doors down is great too).

More impressive is they have made it a very not Vegas feel.  Both men and staff, shout out to Modest, are very pleasant and give that back home pizzeria, where you can take the family for a sit down dinner.  It can also double as the after school hang out for the local high school as a slice of pizza is very reasonable.  

I was in there last night and come to have found out they have grown their taps from 2 to 6.  Don't forget to check out the chalk board for their promo bottle for $3 it can be a great value.  For all you other yeast folks in the form of bread not beer, they make their own dough and gives the bread for the sandwiches and the pizzas that added texture that you seek from places back in the Midwest or East coast.  John was a bit of mad scientist and explained to me one night how the played with the mineral levels to get the water they way they needed it to make it work,  Something Capriottis used to do, but no longer(spoiler).

4729972,2015-12-24,2,DTz6gFeWmdvSEIFGjXpIgQ,"Lemme tell ya something...  Grinders is freaking fantastic, and exactly the kind of local entrepreneurial eatery that our city needs more of, as boring/crappy/corporate chain after chain invades Las Vegas.  I drive past every one of those soulless merchants of prison food to chow down with the good people at Grinders!  This is authentic, tasty, and inexpensive food from some dudes that grew up in the Philly area and know their stuff.  And by the way, if you are giving a 1-star review to a place that averages 4 and 1/2 stars based on well over 100 reviews, there is a very good chance that you are an idiot, a hater, or both!  Now, on to some highlights:

(1) yes, the name of the place says ""Pizza Lounge"", and the pizza is very good (although as with any pizza place, it's always best to order a fresh pie - they make a great 6-slice personal size - than the slices sitting under the heat lamp), but look closely at the first word in their name...  ""Grinders""!  What does that mean?  That, my friend, is a sandwich (like a sub) that is heated in the oven, and comes out toasted with melted cheese.  Mmm, mmm, good!  I personally recommend the Italian, the pork (with spinach sautéed in garlic), the meatball (when available), and of course, the cheesesteak (try it hoagie style with lettuce, tomato, & mayo).  And to the genius who complained in his review that the sandwiches are $11 (the same food connoisseur who suggests that you go to a corporate chain instead), that is for a ""whole"" sandwich, which is beyond ""mega"" and way too much food for most of us reasonably-sized people.  All you need in this world is a half-sandwich (comes with fries), and maybe a tasty little half salad beforehand.  Do the right thing here.

(2) this place takes it craft beer seriously, and is one of the few restaurants in this part of town which devotes 4 of their 6 tap handles to a changing array of craft beers from great breweries such as Ninkasi, Alaskan, Founders, Joseph James, and others.  Plus, they usually have a couple of good craft beers in bottles in the back if you ask nicely.  There may even be a secret underworld craft beer society growing here, but I am sworn to secrecy!

(3) the game day football specials here are outrageous.  If I remember correctly, we are talking about $5 personal pizzas (eating a whole one will more than fill you up), and 1/2 price draft beers.  You don't even need to care about the football game that's on the TV, just come in and have a great meal & a craft beer for cheap!

(4) the folks who run Grinders are a really great group.  This is their business, and they are totally immersed in it, and will do anything to make sure their customers are happy.  Those couple of ridiculous bad reviews (I especially like the one from the Elite Yelper who basically said that the service & all the food was very good except for the calamari, but still gave them only 2 stars, and complained that $45 was too much for the mega-feast of large pizza, wings, calamari, etc. that they ordered - time to go back to Chuck-E-Cheese, cheapskate!) really do upset and affect them, and they work tirelessly to make improvements, though I suppose you can't please everyone.  The sheer amount of ""regulars"" that I see in here is proof that if you come in a few times, try a few different things on the menu, and chat up some of the friendly staff, there is a good chance that you will become a Grinder yourself!

Peace out, and if you see me there, maybe I'll buy you a pint of craft beer!",sg3wRRtKMfugbO7A3AX4Ew,3,1,5,8JkzWlqFoqBEU1h3Jj_2EQ

I bought 2 slices of pizza, one was an anchovies, mushroom and the other was pepperoni. I had to eat both slices of pizza with a fork and knife, because they were collapsing when picked up as the bread was extremely thin. Finally, maybe it's just personal preference as I usually enjoy pizza with gooey cheese, but the cheese on the pizza slices I had were actually kinda lumpy and so I ended up leaving a lot of it on my plate.",eFaJ-ThUZQllC2JStexldw,2,0,3,7t4d7Y3HspCLE5S9Q3osIA

While we were waiting, other customers left because they weren't even greeted- until they were walking out the door. The cook/cashier/server was seriously overwhelmed. The music was annoying and loud, as were the TVs. One monitor was blasting kids cartoons, the other was set to a Spanish channel. Pizza finally came 35 minutes after we sat down- and we were the only ones in the place. The pizza was just ok, if I were rating the pizza alone I'd score it a 3 out of 5.

The owner was friendly and I had a good vibe about this place and thought we would get taken care of but once he left with his family we were basically treated poorly by the people inside. We only had 30 minutes and for 3 sandwiches it took them 45 minutes to make. They guy who took our order seemed to be in another world/out of it. He was slow at taking orders and his customer service skills sucked. We said we needed it to go and ignored us while continuing to put it on the plate. I really hate complaining about places but I felt like I needed to be honest. I was even willing to overlook all of that until we realized that one sandwich wasnt even what my friend ordered, one of us didnt want fries and got it anyways, and for the amount of money we spent we could have gotten much better food and service elsewhere. We even ordered what they recommended which was the Philly. Literally the worst one Ive had in Vegas. I was going to give this place initially 3 stars just because I knew the owner in the past as we hung around the same places together and knew mutual people but once it got to the point where it affected our food and time for lunch, there was no fixing it. Also I was told by my co worker that when he tried to go back and give them another chance, which was my suggestions because i was hoping that it would be a better experience to write a positive review - that he had to go order food else where because there was a woman dealing with a baby and then without washing her hands started touching and doing things in the kitchen/behind the counter.",eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g,2,0,1,_M7s-lI7LUkOOAli-wOTZg

As stated other reviews, the owners happen to be from Philly, which is already a good sign in of itself. For the weary (like me) they offer a $5.99 deal of two pizza slices and a drink. I ordered one slice of cheese and one slice of sausage. And they weren't bad at all! Non-greasy, thick but not too thick, and quality ingredients.

The ambiance was a little bit too mancave-ish for my taste, but the decent food and service allowed me to grin and bear it.

Pros:
Yet another decent pizza shop in Vegas.
Great lunch special. 
Friendly service

Cons:
Ambiance has too many shots of testosterone.

I the appetizer was calamari. It was perfectly crisp and the marinara dipping sauce was flavorful. 

The cheese pizza was on a thin crust and it was garlicky (vampires beware) and delicious. :) 

The restaurant is small. It has maybe about 10 tables. It's cozy. The tables were covered with white table cloths which I thought was awesome. Every-so-often somebody would walk pass and ask us if we were doing okay or if we needed anything. 

And the bathroom was very clean. I have nothing negative to say about this restaurant. Keep up the great service.",xIDeQWZwRYl-TFlaxft8Wg,1,0,5,pNtjr-SJVFWsne0wN8JE8w

I can't wait to try the pizza which I've heard is amazing as well....  Fast delivery as well",dB0nYdXblxcNxCHq0sr48w,1,0,5,Ub0GpYlIcyH4zqwWKS-vQQ

You can hear yourself talk but it's not a boring vibe. Had a fresh, crisp Caesar's salad & the pizza was tasty. Heard the beer on tap quite good as well. I will definitely return!",zmMhcNY6vNw5vaU0O-Evrg,0,0,5,_U4lZOkPu0DQsWw77VgPog

The owner John was super nice and took the time to explain the menu and some of the favorites. They have some unique bottle and draft beers if you are looking for a more eclectic selection of drinks. 

The decor was very cool with a very artsy vibe. He explained that every 90 days they feature a local artist and they display all of their work, with a tie to a charity. Love that! 

Food was served promptly, everything was delicious, with the breads made in house daily. Husband LOVED the pork sandwich, my cheesesteak was great and usually the bread falls apart but since they make their own bread it was not only tasty but held up well with the grease from the sandwich. Then the desert came.. Tried both the cannoli and the zeppolis, and the zeppolis were amazing! Definitely would recommend.",nGYWMsfUofP3cWmzuW8fWw,2,1,5,Hbs8NYyfLE-82M0xernoEg
