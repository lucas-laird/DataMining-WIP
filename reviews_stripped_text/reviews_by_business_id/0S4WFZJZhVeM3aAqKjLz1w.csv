Our servers were very attentive without hovering, we got a bottle of wine, which they kept chilled at the bar for us. We got the lump crab & artichoke dip, which was delicious, and a very ample portion, so much so I opted for a salad and soup for dinner (pathetic I know while at a steak house, but the boyfriend let me try some of his steak). The wedge salad was pretty standard, good dressing, but had 2 pieces of almost whole bacon, not crumbled. The French onion soup was fabulous, cheese was nice and crispy on top, and a good amount of onions. The boyfriend got the Ribeye, perfectly cooked to medium, and nice grill marks and a juicy center.

The food was pretty average. The lobster bisque despite the hype was merely OK. The crab cakes were good. Our steaks were cooked properly, but again, were really nothing special. 
They couldn't serve me a witch doctor (supposedly a specialty drink of theirs) because they were all in use at the nightclub. What, special glasses or something???? I didn't understand that very much. Anyway, that was a con and we both felt the prices were too high for the quality presented. 

We did walk out on the roof top and the view is amazing so that was a plus.

To the hostess that greeted us when we walked in.  To the beautiful table we had (we were on the West side so we looked out to the mountains)(if you want to see the strip views - ask for the East side or a view of the strip) Regardless ALL views at the top of the Rio are fantastic!
Well JOHN our waiter was WONDERFUL.  He was tentative, funny, informative about all items on the menu and I am so glad that we had JOHN as our drinks, bread, salad and our main course was served superbly!  After we received our drinks (and before our salad) JOHN suggested we go out on the balcony of the Voodoo Lounge and check out the view.  WOW it was amazing!  we sat out there with our drinks for about 20 minutes.  Taking photos and just enjoying the spectacular sights!  JOHN let us kow that if you eat dinner you have access to the Voodoo Lounge all night.  We told him we had Penn & Teller tickets - so he told us to come back after the show and enjoy the night in the Voodoo Lounge.  How cool is that?  Free entry to a club in Las Vegas.  WOW!
As soon as we walked back to our table - JOHN served our salad.  JOHN was on the ball!  Boy, I sure hope Voodoo Steak realizes what a gem JOHN is to have as an employee.  We finished up our meal.  All unbelievably cooked to perfection.  I had the salmon and my husband had the rib eye.  Baked potatoes for our sides.
Well we knew we had to leave soon as the show was soon upon us.  We didn;t want to go.  We just wanted to stay up there all night.  So back down that fabulous elevator and onto the show.
What a great night!  Penn & Teller we great and a huge THANK YOU to the RIO Hotel for entertaining us!

Regardless of the Vegas premium you pay for some of the finer restaurants, this place is straight up not worth it- period. Yes, it's 50 floors up and looks great at night but all of that is haunted by below average appetizers, over priced wine (seriously over priced..), and some of the saltiest fare one can purchase. I'm not going to rail every dish but some notables or warnings would be to avoid the coconut shrimp (laughable..could bounce all the back up from 50 floors), lobster bisque (I've had better from the grocery section), and the Voodoo Caesar salad. I will say that the Caesar reminded exactly of the tray of salad you can get at Costco with a little siracha mixed in, might try that at home..

195051,2014-02-13,0,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"Husband and I came here for dinner prior to seeing Penn and Teller.  This wasn't our first pick in places to go but due to logistical issues we thought it would be best to eat at the Rio before the show.  

We made a Wed night res (that morning) via open table.  The res was early, due to the show time, maybe 630 ish.  We did get a window seat with a wonderful view without requesting it.

We arrived on time and were seated promptly.  We started with sangrias and French onion soup.  The soup was ok, little too much meat flavor (maybe lamb?) for my liking.

For dinner I had the lamb dish over pasta.  It was ok, but very fatty meat.  Husband had the filet.  He requested it med rare with horseradish crusting.  It was cooked more to med well.  The horseradish was really not a crust as much as it was a thick horseradish sauce on the top.  We shared the fingerling potatoes - they were fantastic.

Took a bit of time to get the check but the staff seemed very busy, so I give them a pass offer that.  Other than that, service was good and servers were pleasant.  

The best part was that we got a surprise 25% off the check when we showed out show tickets.

Overall, great view, ok food, good service, and the price isn't so bad if you get the 25% discount.  I would not recommend for dinner, but you should go to the bar, have a cocktail, and take in the view.",2PgCHL32hthUinNdXG9Rfg,1,0,3,rbaIdS-59opghFQSZIp4ew

It's nice sometimes, to sit down and enjoy your meal without someone coming to your table every 5 minutes to ask if everything is ok.  Here, they have class and trust that their food is good so no need to ask continuously.  The atmosphere is romantic and the food is delicious.  We started with the Lobster Bisque and the French Onion Soup.  Then had entrees that simply melted in our mouths...the Menage a Trois was to die for....a filet so tender, lobster tail and shrimp with creamy potatoes and veges.

333536,2017-05-25,1,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"Had the worst experience in terms of customer service tonight. Went in with my family to have a nice dinner but literally got treated like trash. 

Our server was Jose and our reservation was at 8pm. My mom ordered a rare New York steak and when the meal came, she cut it in half to see if it was cooked right. The steak looked more like a medium-medium rare. While waiting for Jose to come around, my mom took photos because despite the mistake, she appreciated the steak. When Jose finally came around, she mentioned that the steak was not rare and instead of just simply taking it to the kitchen, he said, ""Well it's been about 30 minutes already since you've had it"" first off, it wasn't 30 minutes, more like 10-15. And he was NEVER around! 

So he finally agrees to take it to the kitchen, and when he brings it back, he brings the SAME steak but now it's cut up into 4 pieces basically saying that the chef insists this is RARE. Not only that, he was rude enough to say, ""I can bring you a raw steak if you'd like"" basically insulting us as customers. 

And even through all this, my mom still tipped the waiter which I wish she didn't. But then again I wish we never went here at all. It's unfortunate since we stay at the Rio often but this experience was by far the worst I've had at a restaurant. On top of that, it was my aunts birthday we were celebrating and it just became the most disappointing night out in Vegas we've had.",lOp9e8CRy9ODP_iibNu-Ww,1,0,1,SkUBoJ3x3HGguJS__-BOXg

My husband and I are young and not big drinkers, so we're no strangers to having restaurants assume we won't tip well, but the staff at Voodoo really took that to a new height.

To start off, we had a 6:00 reservation and weren't seated until almost 6:30.  Wouldn't have been a big deal, except that three or four couples who arrived after we'd already been waiting for almost twenty minutes were all seated before we were.  Not sure what's up with that when they tell you that they can't hold your reservation for more than ten minutes.

Then our server, Christian, came over to introduce himself, and from the first words out of his mouth, he was brusque almost to the point of rudeness and, frankly, just seemed pissed off to be waiting on us.  I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, since it's the night before Thanksgiving--maybe he was bummed to be at work the night before a holiday--but I could hear him interacting with the tables around us, and he was friendly and talkative to them.  He sounded irritated every time he spoke to us, was flat-out rude when he came to bring us our check and get us a to-go box for the food we couldn't finish, and remained just as rude and impatient when we paid the check and gave him a good tip.

I loved their food, but being treated like I'm an inconvenience because someone assumes that being young and sober = being a shitty tipper kind of ruins the dining experience for me, especially when I'm eating at a fancy restaurant.  It would have been nice to be able to go out on a nice date with my husband without being treated like second-class citizens for being in our early twenties.",yGqGPf1P4N6FMbdrmBnc9A,0,0,2,llXhYDXjRZAq7GmQQFS4mQ

658062,2014-10-20,0,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"Short Version:  Atmosphere is great along the view of the strip from the 50th floor.  Our waiter, John, was extremely nice and attentive. Food was excellent.  Star entree of the evening was the dry aged rib eye steak cooked medium.  Nice redness to it, buttery texture, and VERY flavorful.  I also liked the Chilean sea bass, with its soft texture as well.  Filet Mignon was good, but just not great.  Lobster tails were cooked nicely.  I would recommend the lobster bisque as well.

Extended version: Rio's automated reservation system was frustrating.  After trying multiples times to get through, we figured no one would man the phone until 5 when they open.  We called back and asked for a Saturday 6:30 pm reservation for 6 plus a baby (kids definitely allowed, so that's a plus) but were told only 6 pm was available, so we took it.  The dumb thing was that at no time was the restaurant more than half full, even by the time we left.  And two of the big tables next to us remained empty the entire time.  You get to see the view from the elevator ride up.  There's only three available stops: ground floor casino, 50th floor restaurant/zip line, and 51st Voodoo Lounge.  You can go on to the balcony while waiting for your food to look at people riding the zipline (purchase your tickets before coming up) and the beautiful view of the strip.  You still have a good view from your seats though.  
The wine by the glass selection for a steakhouse wasn't good at all.  I counted three cabs total available, one of which was Kendall Jackson.  That's the one thing I don't like about Vegas restaurants.  It's not about what wine goes good with your menu, it's more about who's giving you the best deal.  I would've loved to order a bottle of Honig cab for $86, but there was only one other casual wine drinker.  I ended up with a glass of Stags' Leap Petite Sirah for $17, which paired well with steak.  I wish there were some better cabs available by the glass.
For starters, we had the cocktail shrimp (it was good, not easy to mess up simple shrimp), artichoke dip (also good), and coconut sugar cane shrimp (I forget the name of the sauce it came with, but it was excellent).  There were no entrees really for a kid, so we ordered a bunch of sides to split: French fries (minus the Cajun), Mac & Cheese (hold the truffle, oh well), asparagus (good), and potato puree (hard to mess up mashed potatoes).   
The dessert menu was a little disappointing.  We saw online before we got there that they served a dessert fondue and chocolate lava cake.  But they recently pared their dessert menu down to five things and ice cream.  We ended up getting cheesecake (definitely below average) and bananas foster (presentation was better than it tasted).  
One drink ($4-20), one starter ($15), one side ($8), one entree ($40-$76, ribeye is $46), one dessert ($10) will set the average person back about $100 before tax and tip.

The service had a lot to be desired.  I ordered a glass of zinfandel from the wine list.  The server made a point to (rudely) make we aware I was ordering RED zinfandel.  I'm 42 and was dressed appropriately for a nice dinner, so am not sure why he felt the need to let me know my $20 glass of wine was red -- not pink.   The fact that he thought that I he apparently thought I looked like I should be ordering pink zinfandel was insulting.  

My husband asked if they served any mocktails and the waiter gave us a completely blank look, even after we explained what those were.  At the restaurant we went to the prior night, the waiter had an entire list of mocktails available.  

When I ordered a 2nd glass of wine, I asked for the house cabernet.  The server corrected me -- saying they don't have ""house"" wines.  I clarified that I wanted the featured wine that is on the front page of the wine menu.  In my experience the ""featured"" wines by the glass are generally considered house wines.  

In other server notes, our water glasses were never refilled, my empty wine glass (1st glass) was never removed, and our dinner was delivered before we were done with our appetizer.  

The food was very good.  My husband had the trio and I had the scallops.  Both were great.

When I made my reservation, I requested a table by the window, which was honored. 
We started out with the oysters. I personally do not eat oysters, but the other three people in my party do and they were so impressed that they ordered a second dozen. I ordered a crab cake and it was wonderful. It had a crispy breading around it and inside was wonderful shredded crab meat. Delish! I will say that we brought two bottles of wine from our wine collection at home and the corkage fee was an extremely reasonable $25. 
For the entree, we all ordered the Land and Sea Ménage a trois.  Filet mignon, lobster tail and grilled shrimp. Amazing. We all cleaned our plates and also had a side of creamed spinach that made the ""non creamed spinach eater"" eat his words. 
We ended our meal with the chocolate cake and carrot cake. I was skeptical of the carrot cake because it contains walnuts and pecans and I do not care for them, but they were almost undetectable and the cake was perfection.

After looking through their website, we selected the Voodoo steakhouse and made reservations.

Ambiance
Mixed bag here.  The restaurant is reasonably nice and the view from the 52nd floor is outstanding.   The only real negative I have is that the restaurant's website clearly states that they have a dress code but the restaurant seems to make no effort to enforce it.  Seated next to us was a group with backwards baseball caps on and next to them were 4 guys in shorts and t-shirts.  I realize that I am old and so stuff like this probably matters more to me than to most people but my feeling is that if you are going to advertise a dress code then people will use that information to help make their decision whether or not to go there.  If you have no intention of enforcing it, then that seems like false advertising to me.

Food
We started with crab cakes that were dry and burnt to the point that The Empress did not want them.  We then moved to bisque for me and a salad for her, both of which were average.  The main course was lobster thermidor for me and sea bass for Milady.  She said hers was just okay but I was really disappointed in mine.  There was no thermidor sauce that I could find and it was really bland.  Dessert was also pretty average.  Definitely not the quality of food you would associate with the kind of place they are trying to be.

Service
Bad.  We perpetually could not get drink refills because our waiter would disappear for long stretches.  Even then, simple things like offering The Empress some pepper to take away some of the blandness of her salad were overlooked even though he did it for the table right next to ours.

Overall
As you can see from this review, we were pretty unimpressed with the place.  One thing I will add is that I thought it was very low value.  We each had only one drink (because we could not get anyone to get us another one) and still ended up spending almost $200.

My wife and I were lucky enough to visit Voodoo Steak on the night after our wedding. It was our first dinner out as husband and wife. We also had the good fortune to be seated in Sam's section, and Sam provided exceptional service all night.

To start, we ordered an appetizer and a bottle of wine. After Sam brought over the wine and poured us each a glass, he invites us to go hang out on the outdoor balcony, overlooking the Strip, while the pork belly with apple and caramelized onions was being prepared. We did, and Sam came out about 5-10 mins later to let us know our first course was ready.

We came in and ate our delicious pork belly, and some tasty starter bread.  It wasn't long before my 8 oz. filet mignon with garlic buttery scallops came out with my wife's seared scallops.  We also ordered truffle mac & cheese. All i can say about them is ""Wow.""  My mouth is watering just thinking back.

As we finished up dinner, knowing our story, Sam provided complimentary champagne flutes. Classy move, much appreciated. We ordered some tasty coffee ice cream to finish the evening, and we left full, extremely satisfied, and impressed.

As we told Sam, we'll be back for our anniversary next year.",VUatcI8qj9bsH_0nKHemvA,1,2,5,JhprckHuwowI5lD8EY1uww
1571862,2012-07-08,0,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"Went here the day after the 4th of July. My cousin had never been to Vegas before and I thought what better way to get a view and a good dinner all at the same time.
We bought a voucher at the 1/2 price tickets booth that gave us 25% OFF the entire dinner incl drinks. 
Our reservation was for 7p and we were seated promptly at that time. We got the prized table by the window as well. Too bad a storm rolled through the night before, the windows needed washing.
 When we called  to make a reservation we were told the attire was ""smart casual"". I guess that means, in America, anything goes but ""wife beaters"" and swimsuits. I couldn't believe the liberties other diners took in the  dress department. I'm not faulting the restaurant, that's just the way it is these days.

Anyway, we started off with the Witch Doctor Sampler, included were rock shrimp, mini beignets, coconut shrimp and a lone crab Cake. The portion was just right for two to share. The quality of the shrimp was decent, cooked just right but nothing about the sampler stood out, the dish was served surprisingly cool.

My Scallops, on the other hand, were perfectly cooked, tender and succulent! Yum factor quite high. My cousins 8oz Filet was a real treat as well, ordered med rare (as it should be ordered) came out just perfect. She almost didn't need  a knife to cut it.
 We ordered the side of Ragout of mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, asparagus and bacon. Another good call!

All in all, we were quite satisfied with the service as well as the meal, and blown away by the view. (Only with this was a revolving restaurant).

We saved $45.00 by using the voucher and that also got us into the Voodoo Lounge upstairs for free. You have to wander upstairs even if its just for a few minutes to take in the rooftop view.

Next time I would love to sample the buffet, I've heard it is also very good.",x-WSaKNoVPOhis9E14lNeg,2,0,4,N_1hxsZnjVDqUwdtkzypzg

Due to a food allergy, we informed our server that we needed our sides to be gluten free.  We inquired about the green beans with shallots and almonds and the lemon aioli asparagus as they seemed like they might be harmless.  He told us he didn't think there would be a problem with those sides, but would double check just to make sure.  He never came back, so we assumed it was fine.  When our food came out, we were served plain, dry, barely warmed up asparagus and green beans.  We asked what happened and he said the almonds in the green beans were brushed with flour and the aioli sauce had flour in it so he had them prepare it without.  While we appreciated that he was looking out for the allergy issue, we asked why didn't he come back and tell us this so we could decide on different sides that were gluten free as the main reason we wanted to try those sides were because of the flavors, not just to be given plain steamed vegetables at $11 each!  His response was to just turn and walk away, never to be seen again until he literally threw the check on our table.  We then called over a manager who comped the vegetables and offered us another glass of wine, which we declined.

1722114,2015-01-12,0,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"Let me preface this with the following; I am from Calgary Alberta. We know a bit about beef in Alberta. My butcher in Calgary hangs meat for 14 days then wet ages it for a further 14. I then buy an entire Canadian Prime strip loin and they hang it for an additional 14 days for me. This is perhaps the best beef on earth. We do not have corn fed beef, we have grass fed, barley finished beef that is amazing in quality. The fat is white and these steaks are marbled almost to a Wagyu standard.  

I know how to cook a steak. I lightly season the beef and then sous vide cook it for at least 2 hours at 130 F. I then sit the beef for 20 minutes and finish it a cast iron pan that is nearly glowing with heat. These are fork tender steaks of the most astonishing flavour. 

I have eaten beef all over the world and honestly think this is the best. That said, I acknowledge that U.S.D.A. Prime is also awesome beef.

The steaks at Voodoo don't come close to this quality.

While the room is nice, the view great, and the ambience very good, the kitchen and service are nowhere near where they should be for this level of expense.

And expensive its is. Four of us racked up a 600 buck tab with a fairly good wine selection. We did not order the standard issue 'American' giant slabs of meat, just nice 8 or 10 oz fillets. We had Lobster Bisque and a Caesar Salad for starters.

The Salad was pedestrian at best. The Bisque however was truly great. 

Of the four steaks two were very over cooked, one was very undercooked and one was missing a topping. Zero for Four is not a great way to start a meal.

After refiring the meat and sorting out the topping the cook was fine. The meat, less so. Two of the steaks were dry at medium. The rare steak was bland and the medium rare was mushy.

I was amazed that a place billing itself as a steak house could be so incompetent and cooking steaks. The joint wasn't all that busy, the service was uninformative and lax. The kitchen is a bit clueless.

The wine list is unimpressive and overly expensive. Almost zero good Bordeaux to be had.

Okkk. The food. Expected decent... Whatever food. That's what we got. Not going to elaborate too much bc there's really not much to tell. 
Everything is OOOOKKKKK!

Check out my photos. 
Food looks much better than it taste. Presentation was fab but I rather get something that looks like shizzz but tastes great. Just sayin...

Right outside the rooftop, they got that skyline zip thing. Handful in the group went. Think it was $30 a head. Two in a seat and you get zipped back and forth. The whole actual zip time was about a minute. 
An experience. 

Final thought...
If you are stuck here, this is probably the best restarant in the hotel.

That's a lot of superlatives but there are times when you come to Vegas and are ready to spend money for the ""Vegas treatment"" and are disappointed.  That was NOT the case here at Voodoo.  Everything here was just what we hoped for on our 1st night of our trip.  

She had the ménage e trois and I had a seared tuna special and their lobster bisque.  Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing!

In one word ugly, brown painted wall with a few wire voodoo figures, same old beat up chairs with stains on the fabric and wood that is all chewed up, I don't know who hired the designer , must have gone to home depot and asked for redecorating idea. There is nothing voodoo about it , the old decor was fun and different, this one is just different for the sake of not be the same but very badly done and done cheap. Then the setting, water stains on the silverware and bus boy that pour tap water into my glass with bottled water in it, I guess job training cost too much also. Then the food, well that is the tiniest and worse $48 fillet I have ever seen and the asparagus side dish was so tough and fibrous that only the first inch can be eaten, the rest would make a nice hammock cause it is tough enough to. My so call lobster thermidor was a total joke, I guess they decide what that is, no cognac in the sauce, no re bake in the shell with bread crumbs on top, and two tiny claw meat and the rest is crab!!!! This is the most pathetic Lobster Thermidor I have ever seen covered with a mystery salty sauce that have nothing to do with the dish other than to cover up the cheap ingredients. BTW in case they actually read this stuff at the RIO hotel, this is what Wikipedia's  definition of lobster is. Lobster Thermidor is a French dish consisting of a creamy mixture of cooked lobster meat, egg yolks, and cognac or brandy, stuffed into a lobster shell. It can also be served with an oven-browned cheese crust, typically Gruyère. The sauce must contain mustard.  Then after dinner got even worse, I left my cell phone there so I figure I call the restaurant to ask them to hold it for me. well the hotel computer only wanted to know if I want a room and when I got the operator, she send me to restaurant reservation , they send me back to operator and round and round it took all of 35 minutes...35 !!! then they tell me the restaurant is close and call security, security said call lost and found but they only open till 6 , on a Saturday in a casino they are open till 6!!!! I was more than disgusted with the entire system that have not the slightest notion of customer service in mind, they actually ask me to have my credit card ready when I was on hold for the operator.......this has turned into a low class , customer is just a walking credit card to them kind of a place.

It was very cheesy, lots of onions and was made with a nice beef broth, also delicious. There were about 10 appetizers on the menu and it was a tough call which to order, they all sounded great. 

Bread basket of LOTS of assorted warm rolls arrived with a great deal of butter arrived at the table and I hate to admit it, but I tried a couple - yummy, they were good! 

Great menu selection and it was hard to choose, but for my entree I had a 8 oz filet with a side of creamed spinach, it was rare, just the way I ordered it and it melted in your mouth it was soooooo good. My sister ordered the ""Trio""; steak, lobster and prawns. The steak was a nice 4oz, the lobster was a nice size, but the ""prawns"" looked like shrimp....they were certainly on the small side, she received two and I was lucky enough to get one. Very delicious and buttery tasting, even though they were on the small side.  It came with potato and vegetables and they were kind enough to eliminate the potato and add some more vegetables. 

For dessert sis had the creme brûlée and said it was just great, I did manage to get my spoon in there and taste it, and yummy was that good! 

We received our discount using total rewards which was outstanding, and my great sister picked up the tab! It is a very pricy menu and the majority of entrees come a la carte. 

All in all, service was great, food just wonderful and view from the top was stellar!!!! Even got to hop out on to the patio and it was really nice, small breeze and perfect for some photos of the city.",QfCfgc5PyNVwd_DgPzmeuA,1,0,4,O97CNf2RS2191qfg_GOXOQ

Here are the issues.

The host didn't get our jokes. She was kind of a stick in the mud. 

There is a holding area for the elevator. There was literally what looked like a gurney for moving people around and weird ""voodoo"" like decorations on the walls. We got in the elevator of horrors, which was not air conditioned. The view outside was great, but not at 140 F. 

When we got into the restaurant, there was a weird lion/leopard/Africa them to the chairs, but a decidedly French/American menu. We had a nice view.

Our server forgot my order of truffle mac and cheese and there weren't really truffles in it (they faked out on me when they finally brought it). My lobster bisque had a skin on it by the time it came out, my sidecar was average.

One saving grace was the basket of bread brought out. It had the parmesan flat crisps and they were quite good. 

We were also charged for water. Tap water.

If you want a view, hit this up at night for the club. It seems better suited to that than as a restaurant.",Gxu8g6IDK5pbM_9ReT8Hmg,2,1,2,ItQZ2TlH5uxz1jNdf0PyVg
2759166,2015-11-13,0,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"Ok, more like 3.8 stars. I ordered seafood at a steakhouse so that was probably my mistake. :-( My boyfriend and our other friend both ordered steaks and were in loooove. They tasted pretty good! I just wasn't in the mood for a slab of meat.

I ordered a lobster pasta, and it was just.. bland and a little disappointing for the price that I was paying. It wasn't bad, it just didn't taste amazing either. Some of the lobster pieces were overcooked and rubbery feeling. The pasta itself had little to no flavor... Again, my mistake for ordering seafood at a steakhouse.

The view though --- gorgeous panoramic views of the strip. They have a patio area that you can go out to and just enjoy the view, take some pictures, and hang out with your drinks. That was probably the best part about dining here. 

Our server was also great and very friendly. He was quick to get us the things we needed and to correct any mistakes.

2807783,2018-03-10,0,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"Wow, I just realized that I have never gotten around to reviewing Voodoo.  How could I have done that when Voodoo is one of our favorite steakhouses in Las Vegas, and has been since even before we moved here in 2015?  My bad!  My wife and I have been here several times, and we have never been disappointed.

At a steakhouse, I tend to go straight for the steaks - usually the rib eye or the filet.  Each of these cuts has its own bugaboo at high end steakhouses - sometimes the rib eye has too much fat and gristle in the cap, and sometimes the filet has a nice sear but the texture is a little bit mealy.  Neither or these problems has ever reared its ugly head at Voodoo.  Meanwhile, my wife tends to order seafood, and she has always raved about her meals at Voodoo.  I notice that the one recurring problem that tends to pop up in most of the negative reviews here are about the halibut being overcooked.  Neither of us has ever ordered the halibut that I recall, but there sure are plenty of other choices that are first rate.

Now that Alize has closed its doors, I think Voodoo has the best view of any restaurant in Vegas.  Not only is the view fabulous from every table, but you can also take a quick stroll out on the deck between courses and enjoy the panoramic view from there as well.  I have also been pleased with the service every time; I can't recall ever having had a problem.

The fact that the Rio is a little bit off the Strip not only contributes to the view, it also makes it easy to get here (at least if you're a local like me, and are driving).  Prices are definitely high end, but not off the charts.  And, unlike the restaurants at most Caesar's properties, the online menu here actually lists prices.  (Menus that don't list prices are a pet peeve of mine, so I appreciate that.)  So, with the great food, great view, and great location, Voodoo is a perfect place for a celebration event, or just a high end dinner.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,1,1,5,BLaUUxGhC608HoHf4TybCg

I will make this short and sweet. 
I understand we technically got there when the restaurant was closing but they still decided to seat us even though they initially turned us away but since we were a large party I guess they saw dollar signs. 

Our server seemed annoyed by our presence and barely checked on us during the meal. For the prices of the meal I expect to receive 5 star service and it was more like 1 star.

The food here was just okay - we ordered the spinach salad, lobster bisque, 12 oz fillet, lamb chops, side of mushrooms, and the duo chocolate Carmel bomb cake.

I would not recommend the spinach salad ... Olive gardens salad is waaaay better!  The lobster bisque was very good, but it fell well short of being great or excellent.  The portion size of the lamb chops were amazing, probably the largest portion of lamb that I have ever seen, but one was of the chops was overcooked, plus they were bland - thank god for the mushrooms and the dipping sauce on the side!! The filet was just alright ... I have had both better and worse.  The mushrooms were probably the best lol

The service was just so-so ... It wasn't amazing, but not horrible.

The first thing to comment on is the view-- it really is gorgeous and adds to the allure and fun of dining at a place like this. If you and your significant other are both into steaks, I think this place is a great choice just on that basis alone. It offers a refreshing atmosphere that really seems to take you away from the mundane activities of daily life. But I digress..

Service is good here. The hostess didn't glare when she saw our groupon and I appreciate this seemingly small fact. The waiter had a fair understanding of the menu and offered a number of suggestions based on our preferences and experiences with previous steak houses. Cheaping out, we neglected to order an appetizer and went straight for the main course.

My girlfriend ordered a veal with pasta dish. I don't recall the name, but it was respectably good. The pasta was light and had the distinct flavor of sauteed shallots throughout it, and I am certain it was cooked with a certain amount of wine. The veal was incredibly tender--probably the softest I have ever had at a restaurant. What sets this place apart is the quality of the meat; the waiter was sure to point out how very particular this establishment is about the meat here and where they get it from.

I decided to order something from their prime section, which includes a delicious looking wagyu cut that I will have to try next time. I instead opted for a 14 oz flat iron. I rarely order flat irons simply because most restaurants don't even offer them. Only a high quality cut is worthy of being served at the fine dining level. 

After much thought and internal conflict, I chose the Truffle Mac n' Cheese as my side.
It was incredibly rich, and full of flavor. Not like the stuff you can get at Lucille's barbecue, as this offering had a much more distinct taste. However, it was every bit as good, if not just a bit different. You can really appreciate the different cheeses in it with each bite, but like I said it's really heavy. I wanted to finish my steak so I decided only to eat half of it and saved the rest for an enjoyable leftovers session.

The steak itself was impressive. I was not expecting to enjoy a cut like flat iron because it is categorized below rib eye and new york in terms of quality. However, because it was prime beef I really was able to enjoy its flavor and thick consistency.

3967574,2014-08-30,7,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"*** Review is for Restaurant Week August 2104 Menu ***

I was to the VooDoo Steal restaurant about 10 years ago but hadn't been back since.  Restaurant Week gave me the impetus to go for dinner and to check out the new zip line attraction from the patio.

You have to check in on the second floor of the Rio's Masquerade Tower and then ride the glass elevator up the side of the building to the next to top floor.  The restaurant was almost empty at 5:30 when I arrived.  

I was seated quickly at a window table facing the Bellagio and other south Strip properties across the freeway.  I was soon brought menus--I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  I ordered an iced tea which was soon at the table and I got a nice basket of bread.

For the first course, I got the classic French onion soup.  It was a good rendition of this soup that I haven't gotten in quite some time.

For the main course, I ordered the flat iron steak extra rare.  It was a little too cooked for me but not enough to make me grimace.  The cut by nature is not the most tender steak cut but it has a lot of good flavor.  The red wine reduction added to the good beef flavor.

For dessert, I chose the assorted ice creams.  In this case, there were three dips of ice cream, pistachio, coffee, and vanilla with some fresh berries.

Service was very good.  My empty artificial sweetener packets were removed from the table as soon as a server or busser walked by.  Iced tea was refilled before my glass was empty, and plates were cleared in a timely manner.

After I ordered, my server told me to enjoy the patio and that I should feel free to take my iced tea outside with me.  This gave me a chance to take some photos and to check out that new zip line.  When I went back in, the server said he'd start my order.  This happened on my first visit years ago, and it's a nice touch especially for tourists who want to get photos of themselves with the resort corridor hotels behind them.

This was a good meal but it's not a place I'd regularly visit.  It's nice now and then for the view, but there are better values closer to home.  But we all have to be tourists in this wonderful city and this is a good way to do it!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,10,3,oEhUWgcR_SpjDfHTLeKOFA

The atmosphere had a cool vibe that led up to the name but none of the decor wowed me. It was a panoramic view of the strip (well ours was part of the strip). We were seated right by a window which was great, but the beauty of  seeing the strip was ruined by a huge glare. 

We both ordered the Filet Mignon. I ordered mine medium and it came out more medium well, which i didn't mind too much. I could eat steak everyday if I could, but theirs wasn't as tender as filet mignon should be. Their filet mignon was decent. I also ordered their truffle mac and cheese and I must say that was rather delicious! I would come back for the Mac & Cheese alone. 

As for service goes... it was probably the worst I've received from an upscale restaurant. I agree with another reviewer about the service being terrible from a certain waiter.

She apologizes to us, she had recommended this place. In conclusion, for a high end restaurant that is charging a high price to other comparable steak houses  in other casinos, this was a failure. Service is slow, not cooked to preference, & confrontational when questioning. It ruined my experience and any other possibility of doing business at the Rio.

We started with the Witch Doctor Sampler which we inhaled....my favorite was the zucchini beignets.  

We had the sea bass, braised veal, pork chop, and the bone-in ribeye.  We had no complaints...they were all equally delicious.  We had the dessert trio and a chocolate mousse cake for dessert.  They were fantastic too.

The only complaint we had was that we were not informed beforehand that we were limited to 2 hours for our dinner, and that we could get discounted prices on our dinner by presenting the rewards card for the Rio.

I mostly chose this particular steakhouse because of the rooftop bar with a nice view of The Strip. It's nice when friends and family are visiting to find a place with a nice meal and also a nice view.

We all started with a drink to enjoy with our meals. I ordered a red wine that was very good and my brother loved the IPA he ordered. My husband's Sauvignon Blanc was not good. The bread basket had salted rolls and pretzel bread. The bread was okay, but not great. The tapenade served with the bread was very good.

My meal was the Voodoo Menage A Trois. This included a six ounce filet, lobster tail, two giant prawns, and mashed potatoes. Everything on the plate was great with the filet being the stand out. Next time I'd probably just get a filet. My brother ordered the filet and really enjoyed it as well. Our side of Whipped Potatoes was creamy and delicious. My husband ventured out with the Duroc Pork Rib Eye and really enjoyed it. This meal looked more like a platter with a large serving of pork, mashed potatoes, and some roasted peaches. We were all very happy with our meals. 

Our waiter was friendly and attentive. He was on top of drink refills and making sure we had everything we needed. The waiter also encouraged us to check out the rooftop bar area with the view after we placed our orders. It was a nice spot to take some photos and take the view of The Strip in. 

After making my reservation I remembered hearing that the Rio has a locals discount for some of their restaurants. I checked out the website and found that VooDoo is 25% off with a local ID, Total Rewards card, and the printed coupon from their website. What a deal!

Our server was friendly and attentive.  He handled our large group well.

I started my meal with the VooDoo Style Wedge Salad.  It is a slightly different take on the wedge.  You get the standard wedge of iceberg covered in crispy cured lomo, bacon, and Maytag blue cheese.  The twist comes with the orange vinaigrette they top it with.  It is a solid salad.  The citrus makes it a little unique.

For my main course I ordered the 12 oz. filet mignon.  The filet was prepared exactly as ordered.  It was tender, juicy and flavorful.  They did a very good job seasoning it as well.  The black pepper gave it some bite.

We ordered a few sides for the table.  I tried the Confit Fried Fingerling Potatoes.  They were solid.  They may be a bit salty for some, but I was happy with them.

This is not a cheap meal by any means, but it is inline with most quality steakhouses in Las Vegas.  The views are worth the trip at least once even though it is off strip.

Anyway, told the waiter and he tried to insist that the steak was medium - excuse me sir, I KNOW the difference between medium and medium well.

Made reservations a week in advance and was seated fairly quickly when our group arrived. I noticed it was pretty dark in here but I guess that's the atmosphere they're going for. 

Selection was decent. I didn't do family style with others because I knew there would be at least half meat choices so I ordered a crab cake to eat alone, something light before a night at XS. Lol.

PROS: As most say, the view of the LV Valley. They have a nice deck where you can go out and lounge and take in the view. 

The service was nice and efficient.

Everything tasted good, but nothing rocked my socks so much I would have to come back for it. My husband really enjoyed his ribeye, and he's hard to please. So you get a whole star added to your rating for that. 
Truffle Mac and cheese was also tasty.

There is a 20% discount if you show your Penn & Teller tickets.. Which you'll need because...

CONS: it's much too pricey for the quality! This is fine dining prices but Outback Steakhouse quality dishes. Yes, it's plated nicely and yes the restaurant is pretty, but you're not going to get a unique flavor explosion here. It's good, just nothing to write home about. 

The Witch Doctor is a giant and cool looking drink but it's $31! Buyer beware. The price is not on the menu... That should have been our first clue. 

My $13 salad I could have thrown together at home. It was mediocre tomatoes, bitter lettuce, crumbled soggy burrata, and a light drizzle of balsamic. Ehh. If you're a fine steakhouse, please use high quality produce, cheese, and balsamic.

Although I am deeply saddened they eliminated the Heirloom Tomato salad which was the best in the country, I understand things have to be changed up sometimes.

Not comparing to the amazing bread they used to serve, but a pretzel roll puts this at the ""bar food"" level not the $60 per steak level.

A bread basket is standard for all parties and service was friendly and efficient. I noticed a party next to us of over-sized drinks that looked fun but I wasn't drinking that night so I can't comment on the alcohol. 

My friend had the filet mignon and I had the scallops. Both were perfectly prepared and plated. I was very impressed with attention to detail. We also ordered several sides large enough for sharing. The lobster mac and cheese was okay although not as good as other posts suggest. However, if you're not worrying about carbs, worth a try. We also tried the green beans and the spinach.

5014132,2016-02-01,0,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"Many years ago the Voo Doo Lounge was one of my parents favorite restaurants and they ate here every time they came to Vegas.  Since then several new hotels and restaurants have popped up and although the RIO is a nice hotel it's definitely now one of the older ones and so is this restaurant.

I was more than excited to try this place, I was with a few co workers and since we were staying at the RIO, it made sense to have dinner here this evening.  For drinks I enjoyed the sangria which was fabulous followed by a glass of red with dinner, I've heard the witches brew drink is amazing but I was with my boss and co worker so I didn't want to get too crazy :).  The food and the service unfortunately I wasn't impressed with.  I felt very rushed and I really like to sit back and dine for hours upon end at a nice restaurant like this.  I also thought it was extremely expensive, now I don't mind paying $40 for a salmon dish as long as it's truly mouth watering and the side of veggies isn't just 2 pieces of cauliflower.  The one thing I'm picky with is the temperature of food, I like my food piping hot, I don't know what it was this week but everything I had was just warm.

I ordered the salmon dish, the plate was cold so obviously the fish went cold quickly, I even heat my plates in the oven at my own house when I'm cooking myself a hot meal.  We also ordered a few sides including the mushrooms and asparagus which came out 10 minutes after our meal, it would have been nice to have our sides with our meals.  Again these weren't very hot either and by the time they got to me and onto my cold plate they were freezing.  My salmon was okay, nothing special compared to any other piece of salmon I've had, I enjoyed the mushrooms, the wine was good and I have to say the one thing I enjoyed the most was the cracker/pita bread thing that came out with the bread when we arrived.  We didn't have dessert and because we said no to dessert the next thing you know, plates are cleared and the bill is on the table and we were out the door.  One trick I've learned is to always accept a dessert menu as it saves you time from being so rushed out.

The view is gorgeous and the rooftop upstairs is beautiful and a great spot to have your a picture taken but overall I'm just not that impressed.  I think so many other amazing places have popped up since the hype of the VooDoo opened.  I'd go back if the prices were a bit lower, portions were a bit bigger and my food was piping hot!",YTOJTDWe41RQlaaQUxwHKQ,4,3,3,N-C_mDosRdn9xcdwglUfQQ

We went to celebrate his birthday but u would never guess it was his birthday since the staff ignore the fact that I told them . The table next to us had free desert for her bday. Anyway we ordered. 20oz ribeye with a salad , soup and asparagus. Our salad and soup came out right away but the steak came out like 45 minutes later. We asked for it to be cooked medium and when it finally got to our table it was cold and medium rare . My husband refused to eat it saying he was full . I know he wasn't so I sent it back to Cook some more . Once it came back nice and warm the steak tasted ok. Not worth $58 dlls but just ok. Our waitress offered us desert for the inconvenience and when the bill came she charged us for the desert. We didn't say anything cause we didn't want to look like cheap skates .

They gave a basket of breads: a raisin wheat roll, sourdough roll and some parm lavosh. I had the prime 14oz flat iron steak which was nice n juicy. Some sides like broccoli, fries and some mix consisting of potatoes, onions, asparagus n bacon. Everyone ordered different items and it seemed all was good.

The Shrimp Cocktail was yummy - the sauce was perfect. Both of my girl friends ordered their scallops with grits and mushroom. I ordered the crab and lobster pasta salad with cream sauce. Jay ordered their Filet, another friend ordered Rib Eye and Salmon. Jay's filet was overcooked - he asked for medium rare and it came medium. It was more cooked than he and I liked. The scallops were delicious - melt in your mouth! Loved the flavor. Our friends liked their salmon and Rib Eye. Mine was disappointingly ok - the crab was cooked a little too long so it was a little rubbery. There wasn't much cream in the sauce and just needed more flavor. We were starving so no one bothered to complain. We also ordered sides - asparagus, truffle Mac & Cheese and French Fries. The asparagus was too al-dente for my taste, loved the Truffle Mac & Cheese and of course, you can't possible go wrong with Pomme Frits!!! Their selection of bread was good as well.

Not classy at all. First off, you are not greeted in a professional manner. No, instead they automatically assume you are going to the club on the 51st, level even after checking on your reservation. 

You then have to take an elevator. Where another hostesses asked if you have a reservation. I'm confused did the hostess downstairs not just call? 
Then we were told to wait, so we did....... plenty of open tables, plenty! 
We were then ushered to our table underneath a fluorescent flood light. Where the rest of the restaurant is dim like the nature of a steakhouse. I did asked to be moved to a not so spotlighted table. We were given menus and told our server would be with us shortly.
Now, at this point and time it has already been 30mins since we arrived. 
Our table attendant came over and asked if we would be drinking wine, I replied I do not know yet. Which at that time he then sighed, and removed all the stem wear from the table. So no I guess the answer is..no we will not have wine. And poured us water, then hastily left. 
During this whole time our new table was by 7 boys, yes boys not men. 7 boys in shorts t-shirts and baseball caps. All loud, and eating with no home training

Our server finally made his way to our table. We both placed orders to start with the steakhouse French onion soup, and we would order after looking at the menu some more. He came back not 2 mins later. ""So what else will you be eating"". I replied, that we were still deciding. 

During our soup wait our server was so I'm patient and impolite that he kept bombarding into the back of my chair like a bull. 

Finally 1 hour after our reservation started we finally get soup. Burnt over salted, tasted like from a can. French onion soup. I refused to eat mine and sent it back. My husband starved at this time ate his. 

I wanted nothing more than to go!!!! 
Asked our server for our check, my soup was still on it....

We will definitely eat here again!",3AsIgaYLJjGmHyumt5oGog,1,0,4,RkGZmv4KqYeT_UfUxYrgWw

While extremely pricey, it exceeded my expectations. Ribeye extremely  tender, scallops melted in my mouth. Asparagus seasoned well. Other guests enjoyed lobster, filet, rack of lamb and chicken. 

Great view of strip although it is an off strip hotel. Waiters tended to every need. 

Dessert was top of the line as well.

Check it out",OEc95EqjUMsc-5gxBXkb7Q,0,0,5,9c4_fwWTT1w7PjWIgeu99w

Absolutely blown away by Voodoo Steak and their level of top-tier food and service. The view from on top was amazing, and allowed for access to the outside deck and photo ops at The Zipline. The braised veal cheek appetizer was phenomenal, and the perfect lead to what was one of the best 12 oz. filet mignon steaks I've ever had. My wife's lobster was spot on, and served with a drawn butter which could undoubtedly be described as glorious. Every dish was cooked to perfect medium/med-rare, flawlessly seasoned, and paired brilliantly with complimentary accoutrement. A side of the intoxicating truffle mac 'n cheese was the perfect (and only) way to complete what was for us a fantastic dining experience.  Our dinner plans for future Lost Wages trips have instantly been compromised, as Voodoo was one for the memories.",li5pwULg5kwUf7CjN7uvCA,3,3,5,SnXfXlFDxV6kfELA3jCqqg
5837409,2012-11-26,1,0S4WFZJZhVeM3aAqKjLz1w,"With Groupon in hand, we at last made it to VooDoo Steak with another couple,  Bread was good, but butter had to be requested twice.  Classic French Onion Soup was exactly that, with a thick cover of melted cheese and well-caramelized onions.  Initially our server mistakenly brought Coconut Shrimp to our table instead of the Shrimp Cocktail we ordered.  But when the switch was made, the Shrimp Cocktail was excellent, with large shrimps resting on a bed of lettuce.  A Caesar Salad was peppery but good.  Appetizer, soup, and salad all came together, but we had enough time to eat all the preliminaries before our entrees arrived.

My entree of an 8 oz. Fillet Mignon with Red Wine Sauce was medium rare as ordered, and very tender.  Additional requested Bearnaise Sauce was not listed on the menu, but was cheerfully supplied, and very good.  The large Baked Potato accompanying the steak was properly prepared but did not contain enough chives to my liking, so the manager brought me more.  Sauteed Wild Mushrooms further enhanced our enjoyment of the meals set before us.

It was somewhat noisy near the top of the Rio's Masquerade Tower, from conversations at adjoining tables.  But our excellent view of the Strip far below easily compensated for this.  And, a delicious slice of creamy, old-fashioned New York-style Voodoo Cheesecake served with fresh berries topped off a fine meal.  A bountiful assemblage of fresh blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries was strategically placed on top of and wedged around the generous portion of Cheesecake.

4-1/2 stars on this lovely night!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,4,3,4,AWLnDyQLS1z7JlGNzacA9g

Well, the popovers are really good. Dinner was not as good as the popovers, frankly. Went for a good steak on the recommendation of friends. They raved about it . When I next saw them I told them  we didn't go rather than tell them it was not very good. Service was average, something I notice happens in the better restaurants in town if you don't order drinks or a bottle of wine to start. As for the steak..? I think the term is ?..fuggedaboudit. Wife's filet ordered medium was really rare, sent back to return well done. She couldn't eat it. Mine was medium rare but  nothing I would go back for. If I remember, bill with tip was about $170. 
 We DO really enjoy their recipe for popovers, though. With a steak on the grill from a supermarket nearby.",gxJ3-CHMs9V9cdsvFrphcg,0,0,3,k2YFXat0SSLnBCIMzmttxg

We ordered a couple of Prime Ribeye steaks for $58 each and some green beans,  I wasn't expecting Nirvana but what they actually served us appeared and tasted like like large cheap sirloins I'd pay about $7 for at the market.  Another peeve was that they were barely seared.  I would have been happy with a properly cooked mediocre grade Ribeye.  We left very disappointed.",Ijz1ba7l2THimb4YOkNyrA,0,0,1,Enbk1tx6X2rhOna47i9GEA

No wait when we were checking in for dinner. The views were amazing. As far as the food- we had the Mac n Cheese- yummy. Asparagus was tasty and we had the Australian Wagyu Steak (we shared the steak and the side were family style) OMG it was delicious, flavorful, well seasoned and cooked right. We shared all 3 items and were stuffed.. Forget the desserts, no room. Yes it is pricey but the quality of the food was well worth the money- you only live life once so enjoy it!

Kudos because you have my loyalty at this point. The most delicious lamb and couscous dish hands down, appetizers and drinks to die for and dessert menu is very fun and beautiful to look at. I can tell whoever is in the kitchen really enjoys food which I appreciate because I do too.

Service is meh. Very relaxed maybe even borderline unprofessional but you can't expect great service from a union establishment. Restaurant decor is dated but I'm not that shallow. I'm there for the food. When I went there there, almost everything I wanted from the wine list they didn't have. But a lovely view to have when you do end up getting a drink. I would consider this a hidden gem in Las Vegas.",RArQt74He3Ok8asTRUw2FQ,3,1,5,-FfD5wyX9rI3SKJOhmekng
