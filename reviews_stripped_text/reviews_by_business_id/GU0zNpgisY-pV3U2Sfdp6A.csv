128920,2013-06-22,0,GU0zNpgisY-pV3U2Sfdp6A,"One of my favorite places in Las Vegas. First and foremost I am not the biggest Vegas fan, don't care to live here and am beyond terribly homesick for Cleveland. 
So I was happy when I discovered there was in fact a ""Cleveland bar/restaurant""
I will say it could be a bit more Cleveland in there, it is sort of a Cleveland/old Vegas hybrid. Of course this is my biased opinion. They have enough Indians, Browns, Ohio state stuff on the walls but could be more. I was once in a Steelers place (cringe) and I don't think the actual city of Pittsburgh was as pro Pittsburgh as that was.

Anyways the food here is really great. Being Italian my self I am overly particular about my sauce. There are few restaurant sauces I'll eat, This one is pretty good though, it passes. 
The garlic cheese bread is amazing, the meat balls great. The pork sandwich is really great, actually pretty damn good the next day too.
Last time we went my son got the pizza, it was just fare, seemed like a premade crust.
The kids do get free ice cream though.
As for dessert, the fried dough is very good and the cannoli came looking like it should have its own zip code.

All in all this place is a favorite of mine and until I can do the impossible and convince my L.A. born and raised wife to move to the 216, it will do.",DlTo09jeWhfkhWcEYatihQ,1,0,4,PKmuvbrrNsmPsC6kTwIuTw

The Boulevard was one of my favorite places to come have a drink, play some video poker, and enjoy some delicious Italian food. Since Vegas is a smoking friendly city, the bar is completely separate from the dining area which is smoke free. You can eat up at the bar if you prefer as well.

The food is great and moderately priced. They have an excellent hand tossed pizza. I'm quite picky with my pizza and was pleasantly surprised. My favorite is their white pizza with a garlic and olive oil base. If you come on a Friday you must try their clam chowder. It's made from scratch and is probably one of the best I've had and that's including my trips to the east coast. 

If you're in to sports, they have you covered with many TV's showing the games throughout the bar and even in the restaurant area. The owners are from Ohio and have all the Ohio sports team memorabilia displayed throughout the bar and restaurant (only downside being originally from Michigan!)  

The Boulevard is open 24 hours and after midnight most of the food is 50% off. Breakfast is good here as well. It's right across from the South Point casino and the Grand View timeshares so it can get pretty busy here, although I've never had to wait to be seated.

At first, I didn't want to come here because a big sign said ""Smoker Friendly:, and I dread smelling smoke and smelling like smoke. That would've been a big strike and one star lost for me.  But strike one never happened.  When we got there at 7 PM, we were the only ones in the smoker friendly patio with no one smoking. The hot sun was setting and the comfy shaded patio was great for post meeting gabbing.  

We had just come from South Point casino, and saw some gorgeous ladies serving drinks at the casino.  Here though, you have two regular guys in T shirts serving drinks.  That might've been strike two, but strike two never happened. What they lacked in beauty and finesse, they made up for with their very good service. We started off with some drinks - their 6 beers on tap included Sam Adams, Bud, Bud Light, an ale, and Hefewiezen.  This wheat beer was smooth and citrusy, and went well with the crispy Calamari in beer batter and antipasto type appetitizer someone ordered with sausage, cheese, and marinated veggies.

We went inside to have dinner.  It was comfy in the front section where we were with minimalist decor. As a group, we had a limted menu to keep things simple. We had a choice of sirloin steak cut thick, chicken Marsala - which is what I had, a pork, and shrimp fettucine.  The Marsala was delicate, slightly salty, with a light brown sauce surrounding tender pieces of chicken.  The steak was beautifully and correctly cooked, but slightly dry and probably could've used a dry rub.  It came with a baked potato and veggies.  No one in my table had the other two dishes.  

The spaghetti that came with the chicken dish was also beautifully presented, but I didn't care for the bland flavor.  IMO, it could've used more Italian seasonings like oregano, rosemary, thyme, and garlic.  That was almost strike three.  But the simple salad and warm bread along with the good entree prevented that.  And, after I tasted their tiramisu and heard about their creme brulle, that someone else ordered, my palate waked up...unlike our brains which by this time, was ready for a night cap after a 5 minute walk across the street to the hotel.  The multiple strikes and star losses never happened, and overall though the spaghetti was a miss - the service, dessert, chicken marsala was very good.  I'd give it 3.5 stars rounded up.",eteU71BreWIONFxtIsCP9Q,6,5,4,xXVOQBf2coZygrxDVSI_ZQ

I tend to judge everything by the quality of their Caesar salad...
This place has a pretty solid Shrimp Caesar salad. Shrimp cocktail, should be more al dente but in a salad, grilled shrimp should have some Grill on them. But the Romain, fresh. Not a fan of pawning off provolone as parmesan but the lettuce was that clean and the dressing smooth and evenly coated.

When I asked what the bartender recommended that was flavorful he said ""I'm not going to do your job, read the menu and let me know what you want."" 
Yup, the bartender made zero recommendation, was rude and made sure that I wouldn't be coming back.

Her suggestions were spot on.   That food was some of the best bar/pub/restaurant food I have had in a long time.

The bartender also brought out a basket of bread and butter for me :-)
The pasta was honestly excellent! I ordered an IPA as well that was delicious.
I then received a text from a friend who was about to be at my house and I had to head home - the bartender brought me the cannoli I ordered for dessert, the check, and to-go boxes very quickly and I was out the door in no time! I ate the cannoli back home and it was DELICIOUS! Finished the whole damn thing.

We couldn't find the barbecue place we wanted and ended up trying Boulevard Bar & Grille as a last resort, mainly because it looked kind of dull on the outside. We didn't expect much at all.

But inside it was super clean with smoke-free air and lots of big screen TVs. There's a Cleveland sports bar theme and the members of our party who live in that area recognized several Cleveland high school pennants on the wall.  

Our party ordered two of the pizzas, the pork ribs, a salad, and a couple of desserts to eat and beer and cider to drink. Our server told us the pizzas would take an additional 20 minutes to cook and would we mind waiting? We said no problem -- as it was nice to know of the delay before we completed our order.

When they arrived the pizzas were incredibly huge, nice and hot. The pizza eaters in our party said there was a good blend of flavors in the sauce and it was just all around good. 

The pork ribs were out of this world: the meat just fell off the bone, very tender and not fatty at all. Definitely the best I've had in a long time.

The fries that came with the ribs were crisp and hot and the serving was quite generous.  The salad was a basic dinner salad with a good dressing. 

The desserts we ordered included creme brulee, which was extremely well done. The crust on it was perfectly done--I mean, it was PERFECT. Spumoni ice cream was good, too.

We also ordered the homemade fried dough... my god, did that smell good. I didn't eat any but our guests who did said it was nice and hot and tasted divine.

Looking around, we noticed that this place provides live music by local artists and we really wished we were going to be in town for the next event. 

Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and most efficient. I always check out the bathrooms (because I think their condition is a good indicator of the cleanliness of the kitchen) and they were ultra clean. 

Overall, this was the best meal I'd had in our couple of days here in Vegas and I would definitely go again, definitely recommend it to everyone.",54LLCsswtNr7By8k8VRyqQ,2,0,5,tpC82sCxrVVuczzNSrMTLw

Everything at the South Point casino was closed when I finished up, and my friend and I were starving. Enter, Boulevard Bar & Grille.

Surprising, to say the least. I have no idea why I ordered an omelette, but I did. It was really delicious, fluffy, and full of veggies. My friend went with the eggplant parmesan sandwich, and I wished I had ordered that instead. Really, really delicious. For bar food at 3am, this place is excellent. The bartender was wonderful; he offered menu suggestions and was super accommodating. I wish I could remember his name ... 

If you're at South Point, there isn't a HUGE selection of wonderful food inside the casino, and this place is simple to walk to. Open late, and the food is still fresh. Can't complain about that!",m9y1phkwqdOmilZyuH8_wQ,2,0,4,1FqkYuYJq566lIG4OnQcgA

We walked in and were ignored by the bartenders for a solid 5 minutes while we wondered the bar trying to find seats to eat at. Once we sat down though we were informed sharply and insistant that we don't have a server. They placed the menus and silver wear as well as salt and pepper on the bar and stepped away insisting they were coming around but then why wouldn't you just walk with them. 

next the menu. nothing special on the menu nothing i really wanted there was a eggplant bruchetta but i am not ordering italian items from a not italian resturaunt (i am a italian i trust the proper food in a bar to be pub food)

Ordred the boulivard steak sandwhich it is supposed to come with rib eye in it. Well it didn't the cut was new york strip. While it was cooked and seasoned well it was not a rib eye and god awefully hard to chew i bit in to the sandwhich and couldnt tear it i chomped on it and tore and broke the bread and lettuce and tomato and never made a dent in the steak. 

My father in law got the same experience. We knew it was strip be cause all strip cuts have not only grissle but Tough parts of fat on the edges. Ribeyes dont.

Mother in law got a burger and ordered it medium and came out well done. 

wife got chicken tenders and they were stock freezer resturaunt supply fingers. The only thing that came out good my wife like light breaded chicken fingers so 1 point for this place. 

We all were half way down our drinks by the time the food came and were not offered refills at all. I finished my drink and got my self the refill. We were not even offered a refill until we were litterally about to leave. my morher in law ordered a teauilla and oj. We tasted the silver tequilla but a oj that was concentrate and very little of it.

check came out to 62.49 i think. But with lousy food and service i don't even tip normally, but i wasn't paying i normally ask for a manager to but i was told to ignore that and write the yelp review. we tipped $6 for the ticket and when we got to the car the waitress followed us out and demanded to answer why we tipped $6 and we only thought. Really? after what we told you and only argued that well we dont get the wrong product in.

we definately won't be coming back in and John Taffer needs to visit this place and raise hell.",aeWEL1qemudI-jQEm2hIyw,0,0,1,xIYUsPKW3aC7aUjpRYbTCg

The parking lot was full . A good sign. Went into the bar and the bar was fairly busy. We sat down at a table in the bar area. Wasn't sure if we had to approach the bar to order. We waited a few minutes and there didn't seem to be anyone working behind the bar. All of a sudden we saw a customer leave who had a little dog with her. Then a couple employees went running out following her. We said ok something's not right here. So we waited a few more minutes and somebody decided to wait on the customers. Most were waiting to pay up on their bill. A couple got another drink and not once were we acknowledged. So after a total of 15 minutes we decided to leave. Will be a long time before we try this place again. Management or the owner needs to monitor this place to see what's going on. If that was the management there that night then we don't need to check out this place again.

We tried a mix of foods. For an appetizer we got the garlic knots. They come on a plate loaded with garlic butter happiness and a side of marinara sauce. The garlic smell alone drove me wild! The New York Style Pizza has a delicious real cheese blend, but the sauce lacked any real flavor and the sausage was bland as all get out. The same went for the lasagna.

I used to recommend the Italian food to everyone and they loved it but at a certain point it seemed something changed and it didn't have that WOW factor it used to. That obviously has been corrected cause the meatballs I had were fantastic and my coworkers absolutely loved the cavatelli and Italian beef sandwich. Owner Flore continues to be proactive and cordial as he comes to every table assuring everything is to standard.

But if you are wanting something in south vegas, without it being in a casino or loud noisy area, I like this place.  It's fairly non-descript, it looks more like a biker hang out than anything but it's not.  It's like a sports bar but with good food.  I've had the pizza, which is just ok but some of the pasta dishes were pretty good and they give you large portions.

We could see by the number of cars in the parking lot that there must be something good here. The family environment made it feel like I was a local.  The best part was that one of the owners (casually dressed in shorts) visited each table asking how we liked our meal.

Crispy Breaded Chicken with perfectly cooked Spaghetti and wonderfully flavored Tomato Sauce.  I had the Insalada Caprese. This was the most revved up version of this salad I've ever had! Along with the traditional Tomatoes, Basil and Fresh Mozzarella, it had Salami and Assorted Olives!  A great combination of Flavors!

  Last night, this has all changed. I ordered the penne with shrimp & the chicken francaise to-go for my fiancé & I. The wait on the food was ridiculous just for me to get home & discover the food was pathetically prepared.
   The penne & shrimp pasta had a ton of pasta, little shrimp & hardly any sauce on it to the point I had to prepare some sauce at home just to stomach it down. The chicken francaise was dry & the lemon white wine sauce was broken & inedible. I wouldn't even feed my dog this garbage.
  The bartender, Jack, was extremely inattentive as I had been gambling a decent amount of money & still charged me for the garbage I brought home. I would never recommend this place to anybody.

This is a good place to watch sports, especially if its Ohio based sports as there are many Ohio sports novelties decorated around the restaurant. 

Although each meal averages from anywhere around $12-18, it is well worth it. It is a dark and quiet restaurant during day time, but I'm sure it gets packed and loud when there's a sporting event going on, unfortunately I went around brunch time when nothing was going on.
