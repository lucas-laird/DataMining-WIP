Speaking of the floor, there was food and trash strewn all over the floor, and it looked as though it had not been mopped in some time. The drink counter, much like the floor, wash trash strewn with bags, napkins and straw wrappers, though there were no straws available. This should have been my first clue, but I needed something safe and quick to eat, and chose McDonald's though I haven't eaten in one for quite some time. Sadly, I regretted my decision to stay and order shortly after receiving my food. The fries were barely lukewarm, and the burger (a McDouble) was dry and had obviously been sitting around.

She says 1.08 thank you, I said no no excuse me a couple of times and she wouldn't come back to the mic. I pull around and I get to the window and SHAY is there and I told her what I ordered a Carmel frap and she said Oh, our frap machine isn't working. Now I know my limits so I just drove off and decided to call and complain. SHAY answers the phone, I tell her that it would be nice if the put a sign out saying that their frap machine is down she said that's not her job and at this point was going to let me speak to another supervisor. Mary gets on the phone and calls me HUN and says that they are not allowed to put signs out that their Manager ANDREW has to do that. I asked how long the machine has been down and she says about a week. WOW Really?????  I told her how rude SHAY was and my time is just as mush if not more valuable then theirs because I was on my way to work, they were already working. And they want 15 bucks an HR. REALLY?? I called cooperate and spoke to Wyatt. Wyatt apologize said that was uncalled for he was just made aware that the machine was broken this morning and I said well you know they're lying to you or they're lying to me and that's not good either which way he said he was on his way there now I told him I was going to post on Yelp and Facebook He asked if there was anything he could do to prevent me from posting,  I told him I'm not doing this to  get free things I just want? 
good decent service. I was going to let everyone I know not to go to that McDonald's he kept trying to give me free stuff I didn't want it he apologized again and said he would take care of the situation. I will not go back to that McDonald's again at all this isn't the first time I've had problems with them and it always seems like they would rather give stuff away then FIX THE PROBLEM I'd rather spend the extra money and go to Starbucks on the opposite corner to get my coffee frap.

2759561,2013-10-29,5,WM33kyvA8XfiL8lk2I2vcA,"It's about time they re-did this place. I mean, how many McDonald's that are out there that are just straight up drive thrus that are wildly popular and successful? None if any. 

So why this review for a chain? Well, since it's new I wanted to check it out and get my McRib grub on since it only comes around every so often. You would think the service would be nice just like the building but here's where the needle on the record scratches off the vinyl.

First thing, I get in line behind one person that is waiting to order their food. A couple minutes go by and finally after the just the one counter person calls out somebody's order, he takes the person's order that is in front of me. So after that order, he leaves to go get it ready while I'm standing there waiting to get my order in. Btw, this was lunchtime around 11:30 so there is a line already forming. You would think that there would be at least 2 to 3 people at the counter for the lunch rush but no. This one guy was doing the same thing over and over again.

So I finish meal and throw away my mess. I go to the bathroom to wash my hands. I come back out to get a refill on my coke. This employee refilling the soda lids asks me if I have my receipt so I can get my refill. I reply saying that I just got done eating and just came from the bathroom. The receipt is in the garbage. He says I can't get a refill. EXCUSE ME? DID YOU NOT JUST SEE ME SITTING AT THE VERY TABLE YOU JUST CLEANED? So I got my refill after the guy says he was gonna report me to his manager. I said go ahead so I can complain about the bad customer service. He just stood there and continued to refill the lids for the soda. I should of said, ""Do you know who I am? I am Roger T and I'm a Yelp Elite damnit! You better recognize!"" Lol.

Anyways, just because it's a new building does not equal to great or better service. Next time, just give me my damn McRib and I'm out!",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,5,4,2,8DhoStNqhUrsnHdoegBy2w

They went from a classic drive-in setup where you place your order at the window and dine in your car or in their outdoor seating to a true ""McCafe"" complete with faux blue chandelier, ultra-modern bathroom doors and interior decor, and bright high definition animated menus which would make Marty McFly (see what I did there?) wonder if he set the wrong year on his Delorean going from his mother Lorraine's time in 1956 to 2016.  There's a service monitor that displays the order number brightly and service was prompt and courteous.  I ordered Le McRib with a side of pomme frites and sweet tea (or as I may one day learn to call it, liquid diabetes) and in a simultaneously comforting and disturbing way, all items tasted identical to how I always remembered them.

Electrical outlets for your electronic devices to be plugged in for charging are located on the ceiling, restrooms are completely monitored, you have to asked workers working the register to electronically let you in, not good if you have a ""emergency"" and the food server is busy helping others.  By the way even the soda fountain machines is also closely monitored, you have to ask the workers to press a trigger button to let you dispense beverage and ice.  

While I was finishing reviewing this place, I saw a lady struggling to enter the females restroom, I kindly pointed the situation to the manager who happens to be working the front register.  Same lady asked to be let in, in response the manager said just push your way in, what a dishonest manager.  The restrooms don't have signs letting customers know to ask to be entered in, 

Going back to the soda fountain, if you don't want people helping themselves get free refills, a suggestion is to relocate the soda fountain behind the cash register counter so you as an employee can better monitor for people askin for a refill and charge them for it instead going back to push the trigger button to allow people to dispense beverage.

Any who the coffee was not fresh and I didn't eat nor drink my coffee. I went back after my appointment and told the manager that I want my money back. No one was in line and they took forever to refund my money! Like really? Retrain your employees how to crack an egg!!",tFLFrEjD9omSqs0gqSYxvA,0,0,1,ORAUJOFdHSCSCju3sDDJKg

I had to go and ask for them and when I did everyone had an attitude when all I asked for were napkins. I was standing there waiting to even get someone's attention so I had to ask and when I did the girl with the braids in a ponytail was snobby about getting me them and I was even hesitant to even ask for my strawberry jam but I did anyway and of course they were out of strawberry jam. We ate in I kept hearing customers ask for napkins because they were not stocked and some older gentlemen told the guy with a long hair in a ponytail that the napkins were out and he said he would stock them in a bit and I kept listening to constant people go back and ask for the manager and they would get even more snobby about it. Of course after I was done eating I was already thinking what the bathroom looked like so I just wanted to wash my hands and puddles on the floor. Where the paper towels were looked broken I had to pull out the roll to get a sheet. I couldn't even tell if there was a manager on duty because  nothing was being managed and no one was stepping in to fix anything. It was a bad experience especially when everyone working has a bad attitude with customers asking for something. It's simple just stock everything real quick so you won't have to be backed up with everything all at once, so that everyone is happy.",KKMzDMKUAXRiS5Nizm-z-A,0,0,1,qOu1QhPegXY6CgeGSF0Dcw
