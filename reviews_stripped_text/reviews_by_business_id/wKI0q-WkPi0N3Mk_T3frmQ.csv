""$6.75 ok for you?"" the man behind the counter asked me.

""The menu says $5.99,"" I replied.

""Oh, okay,"" he said in a disappointed tone of voice.

(The menu board did say $6.75 for an entree and TWO sides, which is not what I ordered.  If the man had asked me if I wanted to upgrade to two sides that would have been one thing, but that's not what he did.  He was just trying to negotiate the price on a national chain menu and charge me more.)

Then the woman didn't give me a fortune cookie - and she received reluctant to give me one when I asked.

I don't know what in the world was going on with them, but my fortune cookie said I'm surrounded by silent love and friendship so it looks like I won out in the end.",EuU-EAc3kPbvU6XIvpZfIg,0,0,1,hgEK0ttnfvqmgI8QdoZQyQ

If you're a tourist visiting, I'd say ""c'mon, you can do better than this!"" not to disparage the quality of the Panda Express franchise, but it's a chain fast food restaurant that isn't that cheap.  Your all-in price with a drink is going to be around $10.

Spend a few more bucks within the Red Rock Casino and you can get into the buffet which has the same Chinese food, and greater diversity without limit (all you can eat and drink).  Also, the cafe in the Red Rock has deals like a T-Bone steak for $10.

However, if you like reliable, consistent Chinese food, and like Panda Express, this is going to be a predictable experience that won't wow nor disappoint you, just deliver what you come to expect.

We were staying at Red Rock, and decided to take advantage of their food court. From our hotel room, it was a bit of a haul to get to, but otherwise was pretty convenient, with the usual gamut of chain restaurants - like a Panda Express.

Got two combination plates (and some wontons) to go: a plate of fried rice with orange chicken and Beijing beef (not that good), and a plate of with chow mein (those noodles are wayyyy better than I remember) with mushroom chicken and broccoli beef.

We feasted on the Americanized Chinese grub in our room - there were no leftovers. Sometimes all you need is slightly-pricey, greasy food to keep you fed, and Panda served.",6s-g2vFu12OemhiK3FJuOQ,8,7,3,2f0UkeJARn1LKwg0ya1InQ

In ordering food it was specifically asked if they have grilled chicken with nothing on it.  The woman whom clearly spoke broken English said yes, nothing on it.  I asked again, there is no sauce or seasoning on the grilled chicken and she confirmed it.  So, I ordered steamed veggies and the grilled chicken.  Upon sitting down the chicken smelled very strongly of sauce.  I brought the bowl up to ask yet again to someone different and was told there is nothing on it but the chicken is soaked in a sauce.  WHAT?!?!  What part of nothing on it I was told means nothing except sauce.  At that time we requested a refund since it couldnt be eaten.  We were told no....wtf, you lie to me about how your food is prepared and then refuse to refund my money.",evvs7fnYmcqumK-YWVNwDA,0,0,1,xr9hwKlc9mTjoc4VVMiQKA

Please have your employees check the correct order before giving it to the customer.  Several orders got mixed up and we ended up receiving the food of the guy behind us. How hard is it to follow the line? And why does beef and broccoli only come with three pieces of beef?

4484731,2013-09-25,1,wKI0q-WkPi0N3Mk_T3frmQ,"You want real Chinese food?  Go to China.  On second thought, that might be a little too exotic for the faint at heart.  In which case, what you want is the American version of Chinese food.  So if you find yourself at Red Rock on a Wednesday evening and stop hitting ""Repeat Bet"" long enough to realize you're hungry, a trip to the food court may be in order.  And that's when, faced with an array of less-than-exciting choices, you could decide to dig in to Panda Express's offerings.

Sure, you could pay a few more bucks and get the same - or better - quality Chinese food at the buffet, but then you'll pig out and hate yourself in the morning.  Or sooner.  While Panda is overpriced for what you get (Note:  most of the food court places seem to have raised their prices recently), you can choose to eat less of it.

I used to order the two-item combo plate, but it really was too much food for me, so I've switched to the bowl.  Last time I got a new item - Angus steak and shrimp - and it was actually pretty good, though I didn't notice that it was a buck extra because of the shrimp.  So that little bowl of food - with way too much rice, but enough of the main, was over $8 with the tax. 

Still, it was a passable alternative to starvation, and the diversion actually saved me a few bucks at the machines.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,0,3,xjH9vdEQZx-elPiqcL7VWA

5907824,2008-12-13,3,wKI0q-WkPi0N3Mk_T3frmQ,"Panda Express is one of the quick serve outlets inside Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa. We intended to use our half-price coupon for the Feast Buffet but were startled to discover a humongous line (Saturday about 11:39).  Do people really wait an hour just to get into a stinking buffet? Are they giving the food away? (No! It's $10 for lunch!)

We made our way to the food court, where you can also choose among Fatburger, Villa Pizza, Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill, Capriotti's Sandwich Shop and Tropical Smoothie.  

We wanted no part of Fatburger.  You pay $10 for a meal (more of a snack) that includes a skinny burger similar to the dollar menu at other chains. You get approximately 15 fries.  

We settled on Panda Express. It's marginal Asian-style food, not really good but usually not bad. It vaguely reminds you of eating in an actual Chinese restaurant. It's the kind of choice you make when your original plan goes wrong and the chaotic casino environment jams your brain. It can foul you up even when you're not gambling.

They botched our order and overcharged me. I had a hard time getting them to straighten out the overcharge. I get the impression most Panda employees speak little or no English.

It doesn't help that the food court is located in an extremely noisy part of the casino.  It's not surprising they fouled up the order. It's hard to hear anything. Red Rock is vying to be the noisiest casino in Vegas. After a while the hellish din leaves you numb.

What you do manage to hear is the annoying grating sound the metal chairs make when they scrape against the tile floor.  What genius thought that would be nice?  Every few seconds it's ""screeech! screeech! screech!"" from people moving their chairs.  

I say skip the food court unless you enjoy eating in a noisy, stressful environment. I don't know why we didn't go to the Grand Cafe. You can get a decent meal there for about the same money.",PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,2,3,2,xWTd9MrYDYi40bdFUxauLA
