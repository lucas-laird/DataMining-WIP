I've tried it twice just to be sure and was disappointed both times. Taste was just off on what seemed like everything. Lacked flavor and breaking was by far too too much on the deep fried dishes. I have tried the combination rice, chow fun, sesame shrimp and sweet and sour chicken. It's in a great location for business since its in medical district and with a vas menu I'm sure it does great but the food quality was just poor for me",WMhgjmJPSuTFL381tVEZRg,1,2,2,RGUVxBB6j9lX3tcZ7k7b6Q

If you are looking for someplace fancy, don't come here. Think Hunan Homes in San Fran or most of the SF Chinatown places. This place is just classic. The old lantern lights on the ceiling are cute and I love the horoscope Year of The ____ table paper place mats.
Yes you get packaged fortune cookies with your bill.

Here are a few of our favorite things:
Vegetable moo shu. Wow. Flavor is on point to traditional smokey yummy. Shredded love. They are already rolled up for you. Four large to an order. We love these as an app.

We get the vegetable egg rolls which are actually crispy spring rolls. (Her regular egg rolls have egg wraps and meat inside them.) Crispy and piping hot they will burn your tongue, be careful :)

We usually just stick with water (it's tap) but on the chilly days we get a pot of hot tea. 

Our favs are vegetable fried rice (we request no egg). Heavy handed on the soy sauce this wok fried favorite is packed with baby corn, broccoli, snap peas, carrots, sprouts, and they are all hand cut and fresh. No soggy veggies here. The portions are large and cooked steaming hot to order.

Vegetable chow mein is my husbands favorite, he requests no bok choy because he doesn't care for it. Once again packed with vegetables and piled high on the plate.

Garlic fried rice (hold the egg) this item that we order is not on the menu. It is super duper yummy and loaded with garlic and flavor.

Singapore style spicy noodles. I have been craving this ever since I had it at Veggie Delite (theirs is too greasy) and I was excited to know that she could make it with vegetables only. It's spicy but not even a medium spicy to me. That's ok because it's packed full of flavor and piled high with vegetables. 

One time we ordered a lightly spicy gravy sauce item called Ma Po Tofu and it was good. That comes with plain steamed rice on the side. This item is super saucy. Not sure if she has brown rice but prob not. 

Lucy knows what we like and even remembers no egg no meat no bok choy on the items that we order. She calls us sweetie, honey and darling :) she is a real gem!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,9,6,5,ViHfj-iiT1TYBo0HS4gVmQ

The food isn't what it appears to be at all. It LOOKS LIKE big portions. THEY AREN'T. 
Unless you like just coating of your food and just the wonton skins in your dumpling soup.

  The wonton dumplings in the wor wonton soup is literally just a balled up wonton, wrapped in a wonton. Not a veggie and or meat stuffing wrapped in wonton, but A balled up, empty wonton, inside another wonton wrapper.

Im uploading a photo of the sweet and sour shrimp with pineapple and peppers.  The breading to Shrimp ratio is so ridiculous its laughable.  I'm pretty sure the first few pieces eaten were JUST breading.   Shrimp Not even half the size of my pinky finger, and I'm a small person.  

I'm nearly offended rather than just appalled at the price to food ratio at this place.  20 bucks for the 2 items and they were ""fake"" in a way. 

Un stuffed wonton dumplings. 
And the tiniest shrimps in batter that makes them look 7 times their size. Unnecessary Scaming BS.

You're ripping people off and you know it.
Abserd. Don't waste your time here there's way to many places to eat in this city for this kind of RiffRaff.",6pcPiptsnDu3-thUAu1Ncw,0,0,1,_BL8Y6YQrnUg1ee0mDTGPA

My partner having previous knowledge of GWCR, brought me her for a quick lunch-to-go.  At first I did not think I was going to order anything, but the lunch specials are super cheap!  My partner picked up the tab, and for the both of us, lunch was just a little under $13 bucks.  This is cool...bit after a short hop back to the office, I was solid at the quality of lunch.  It traveled well and the ingredients were fresh.

Unassuming.....I thought of this over and over.  I wanted to eat at the restaurant.  It sort of encapsulated the Chinese restaurants of my youth.  The lighting, the decorating, the happy, happy.

I would return with others for a lunch meeting a few weeks.  No complimentary hot tea or little crunchy sticks, but no matter.  The service was friendly.  The food was quick and tasty.

I got there early, a few minutes before they opened and they were kind enough to let me in to order for a Playoff party however, the chicken both Tso & Orange tasted old, recooked, dried out and the worse thing is many of us ended up with very bad diarrhea.

I'm so disappointed because every time I go there I always spend $40 and up and to have people getting sick (including me) was so embarrassing and to waste my money by having to throw food out was hard because all my pennies count.

Some co workers ordered takeout  from here a few weeks ago,and sparked my interest.  Of course, I had to check out some Yelp reviews,  and my mission was set.  I decided to venture out tofind this hidden gem and surprise my daughter. I'm so glad I did.  The food is delicious! 

The location  is right on Charleston in a strip mall near the Medical District . The exterior has a huge mural of a brick wall.  Drive slowly so you can turn before you get to the corner,  or you will have to double back (I learned the hard way). 

The interior is clean,intimate and quiet. Its  not  a fancy, formal  place, but it is comfortable. The staff was very friendly and patient.  They answered questions about various dishes and explained portion sizes. I felt very comfortable and welcomed.  Service was really quick! There we're several tables dinning in and one person ahead of me who ordered takeout,  yet my order  was ready in about 10 minutes. 

I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken which came with steamed rice ($8.10) and 2 orders of the Spring Egg Rolls ( 2 for $4.10). The portions are huge.  The Egg Rolls, which we loved could easily  be cut in half and shared . The chicken was also family sized.  I'm  thinking the Combination Plate  might be better if your  not sharing with anyone or if your not into leftovers. 

My daughter loved the Sweet and Sour Chicken! I wish this location we're closer to my home, but I will  gladly venture back to try more on the menu.",RuID0Cs3Q3FLkkKVfPzHFw,2,1,4,HrKJdSPtTvkM6RuyYtMgog

Upon looking at the menu, we were pleasantly surprised at the pricing of dinner entrees ranging from $6.75 to $9.75.  After digging into the plates of food (generous portions!), wow...the food was really awesome!

The Egg Drop soup was tasty, Great Wall combo fried rice was delicious, the Mongolian beef was outstanding, and the beef chow fun was killer!  The only item that was good--but not great--was the Kung Pao chicken...it seemed kinda sweet and lacked the spicy red chili peppers.

We will definitely be going back again!  I'd like to next try out the Egg Foo Young...I just have a feeling that it will be delicious like the other dinner entrees!

The good: very generous portions. We ordered 4 dishes. Each could easily have fed 3 people. Leftovers galore!
The meh: food is pretty standard Chinese fare. Not great, not bad but just what you'd expect.
The bad: do NOT expect timely service. I called to place the order at 6:00. Was told 20 minutes. Arrived at 6:20. The cashier/waitress/ owner searched for our order-receipt and I paid for it. She then handed it to the cook, who proceeded to prepare our food. 18 minutes later I was walking out of the restaurant. I know this because my wife and dog were waiting in the car with the engine running. Thankfully, she turned the engine off at some point so we would have enough gas to make it home.

Service wasn't that bad. The waitress came by frequently to check on us despite the growing number of people starting to show up for lunch.

I ordered a small bowl of vegetable won ton soup and a combination egg foo young. Enough to make 3 meals out of that all for $13 and I eat a lot so that says something hahaha. 

The wonton soup was yummy. The part I was excited about was the egg foo young. I was excited because not many Chinese restaurant cook it where everything is cooked w the egg and then gravy over it. Most place cooks just the egg and mix the other ingredients w the sauce which makes it not good. So I was quite happy when she told me it was cooked traditional style. 

The restaurant is nice and quiet. Not crazy busy. I did go around 12:30pm-1:30pm. Most people were just leaving or they came in after I did. 

The lady that took care of us is super friendly. It has a mom and pop vibe to it so I'm going to assume she is the main one manning the front. Super sweet lady.

Their fried rice they serve with it, tho you can't beat the prices on their (lunch special) is a little bit on the plain side, no scrambled egg in it even..I noticed.    But at least they dont use broken rice, which is a big plus for me. That seems to be almost the norm here in Chinese food in Vegas. Not even China town is any good after you've tried Chinese in Miami, New York? Their vegetable spring roll was on spot though!         The plus here is the hostess/waitress She truly makes the experience, bless her heart. Very warm and always strikes up a conversation. This is the (only dish) I haven't really liked too much. All the other ones have been Bomb so far!!! It's worth your trip to this place, it's in a centralized location in Vegas with old time prices that don't break your bank $6.10 Lunch Special, guys.........",v4WB-qGb4mSIOilHK6i-xg,1,1,4,UE_2Jtr8oBxhCP5Jlur7jg

We sat ourselves and our drink orders were placed.  Lunch special was $5.95 which included an entree, fried rice, and an egg roll. I ordered the veggie chow mein and egg drop soup. The food was very bland and wasn't that flavorful. Service was attentive and prices were reasonable.

Today, my co-worker (who noticed I was sick) ordered me their sweet and sour soup. It was delightful.

Not the greatest, most authentic Chinese in the land. Great prices, good service, and it does the trick.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,5,2,3,aC0qTl5dpw6WR1rna79d4Q
5445358,2017-06-25,0,yBxzqKXHhvNVaFnEOd4f7Q,"We have been searching for a good, decent Chinese food place since we moved to Vegas over a year ago. We have been up and down China Town, spring mountain road, several times trying to find one place that was edible. We have not returned to NY of them.
We came across The Great Wall of China while we were going to our physical therapist.  The only thing good about therapy was finding this great hole in the wall. 
We make this a weekly stop now. Great food served hot and fresh by the nicest lady in the world! She has made us feel like family now.  
We have tried several items on the menu but my favorite has been the garlic chicken combo with fried rice, egg rolls, and egg drop soup to start. The egg drop soup is by far the BEST I have had anywhere.  It is very thick and flavorful!!!The man's favorite meal has been the Mongolian beef. The meat is tender and flavorful, lots of meat, not all vegetables! 
If you are looking for a great Chinese place to eat with great prices, served hot and fresh...give The Great Wall of China a try!!!",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,0,1,5,lkQyawArZbR9bl2NrPpZxA
5445436,2015-01-25,6,yBxzqKXHhvNVaFnEOd4f7Q,"If you are pretentious, stuck up, or  a snob; please do us all a favor and stay the hell out of here. This is probably one of the best kept secrets in Vegas and we locals really don't need you wanna be food critics ruining the name of an absolutely delightful local eatery. This place would be a perfect candidate for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and we sincerely hope Guy Fieri never finds it.

After living in the Southwest for nearly a decade, we despaired of ever finding anything resembling edible Chinese food again. However, the human determination to continue a hopeless quest eternally endures.  After driving by this place several times, we finally decided to give it a try several months ago. When we pulled up, my wife looked at me and said, ""I am not sure I want to go in here, it looks scary."" My response was, ""I am hungry, we'll go in, look around and if we don't like what we see, we can leave."" Well, we almost left after going in. Gordon Ramsay or Robert Irvine would burst a capillary looking at the interior. Which to my way of thinking meant ""Good Eats"" were on the horizon.

So, we sat at a table that was made from the petrified forest (not really) and in chairs that Jackie Gleason probably sat on while he was performing here in Vegas. It appears that this is a true Mom and Pop establishment. Mom runs front of the house and Dad cooks.
We were brought our menus promptly which at first glance looked like the standard fare we have grown used to.

My wife ordered the Won Ton Soup (there are multiple varieties) and I ordered the Egg Flower. (There is an odd property that it seems is only possessed by the Chinese Wok and can only be accomplished by a Master Chinese Chef and that is making liquid hotter than boiling without evaporating, so take care.)Our soup was brought to us with those ridiculous looking chinese soup spoons, which I now know are designed to keep you from giving yourself third degree burns.  I was about to get my first taste and was preparing myself to reach for the salt/pepper shakers, when much to my great delight, I discovered that neither was required. The soup was seasoned perfectly.  (To date, we have had the Egg flower soup, the Won Ton Soup, The Shrimp Won Ton Soup, and the Beef Noodles soup. Do yourself a favor, before you die, try the beef noodle soup. But tell everyone watching you eat it that it is terrible. If they taste it, you will not get to finish it. Seriously, it's that darn good.)

For the appetizer, we ordered what the menu describes as ""Spring Egg Rolls"". I could dedicate an entire review to these tasty delights. First off, they are not Halal or Kosher, they contain pork. You get two with an order, and they are not your father's egg rolls. These are amazing. These egg-rolls are huge and unless I am mistaken, they are tempura. When they bring them to your table, they are cut in half. One of these is the equivalent of two anywhere else. They come with a lovely yet subtle sweet and sour sauce. Every time we order from here, we get an order of these, and my wife, who hates egg rolls always eats one of them. This is the only appetizer we have ordered.

For the main course, I ordered the tangerine beef (which to you philistines, politically correct eaters, and those with general eating disorders is the beef equivalent of Orange Chicken). Our hostess was quick to point out that this dish is spicy. I was skeptical.My wife ordered the Chicken Chop Suey which is a Special Dinner Combination Plate. I must stop and interject at this point, there is no Duck on the menu. If you will notice, the letter f is not in the word duck. This means there is no F in Duck on the menu. Don't ask, she will not be happy with you. Back to our regularly scheduled review. A little while later, our wonderful hostess/waitress/phone answerer brought out at least three metric tons of food. The aforementioned tangerine beef was spiced to perfection. Just enough heat to dance on my taste buds but not hot enough to make me break out in a foreign language, get the hiccups, or need to be immediately taken to the ER.  My wife enjoyed her chop suey, however I cannot fully remember her comments as I was in the throw of mouth-gasms. 

While there was enough food for us to take to an orphanage left over, we decided instead to be selfish and keep it. We brought it home and ate it again the next day to similar delight. 

On a side note, when we ate in, fortune cookies came with the bill.....

Since our first incursion to this well kept secret establishment we have tried the following main courses as well:
Mongolian Beef, yes, spicy and tender. However, you must love onions.
The Great Wall Fried Rice- accept no substitutes. This is a meal unto itself.
Moo Goo Gai Pan which was plentiful, flavorsome, and had a good variety of vegetables.
Shrimp Chow Mein. They do not short you on the shrimp and they are cooked perfectly.

When I came for lunch, there was only 1 server who was also the cashier. The set up was terrible that I had to walk by in front of people while they were talking face to face with each other, or leeching all around to find my way out the door.
Anyways, she seated me at a table that wasn't even clean, because the booth section I asked to sit at wasn't open at the time. A couple mins later, a gentleman sat at the booth, and she decided to move me over to the booth section. Yay! It was close a min ago, now it's open!
I ordered hot & sour soup (L), and beef with broccoli (came w/ rice). The soup came after 15 mins od waiting. 5 more mins (20 total) passed by, and still no beef w/ broccoli. I went to the front & asked her when my food would be coming. She was surprised that I asked for my beef/broccoli to come at the same with the soup. (I supposed she expected me to finish the soup first then she would have brought out the main dish? Mind you I ordered a large bowl of soup, not a cup like at Panera Bread).
A few mins later, she brought me the beef w/ broccoli. She commented that everyone else was waiting as well, so she actually did me a favor, I guess?
As far as the quality of food was just terrible. The hot & sour soup was mostly liquid. No meat, no mushrooms, no shrimp, etc. Hot & sour soup from ChinaOne would be 10x better than the soup here. Mind you she didn't bring out the soy sauce (You must add soy sauce; otherwise, you just taste the vinegar. I was too afraid to bother her!!!! The beef w/ broccoli was very plain. The broccoli was old, I could taste it.
I will never come back here again. I would not recommend this place if you take someone out on a first date (even if you were so broke), or you might not get a second date. LOL!",yfOThLCMhjoCn3AD8VmHoQ,1,0,1,Ls62Naei-OBQo3anEdmB5A
