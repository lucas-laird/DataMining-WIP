Both my husband and I often eat at Burger King when we travel so we pretty much know what to expect price wise.  However, this Burger King is simply price gouging by charging upwards of $12.00 - $16.00 or more per combo meal - the same meals for which we normally pay $6.00 - $8.00 and sometime less if there's a coupon - which, by the way, they won't take even if it is on my app. Is it legal to price gouge to this extent? Who knows, because I've spent the better part of the day today trying to get some answers from Burger King corporate and no one seems to care enough to even talk to me.  Yes, I know this is an airport and not your corner drive-thru but seriously?  If the service was great and the staff friendly it wouldn't matter so much,  or if the eating area were even clean, but none of that applies here.  This location should be reviewed for it's staff and absolutely for its pricing.

9.50$ for a burger? This isn't an Angus burger I'm paying for. 5.20$ for chicken fries isn't as offensive to my wallet. But 15$ plus for the combination seems obscene. You want fries and a drink with that? Add another 4$+ per order and that's probably for the smallest options. Don't even get me started on their bottled waters.

What really grinds my gears was the service. The cashier was fine, she got the job done and quite efficiently. She also was dealing with some customers who were asking her the prices on every item on the menu and did it without losing her mind which I commend. My issue and the reason I am giving 1 star is because of the other 2 out of 3 in the back. 

Service is the biggest thing for me. I will tip extremely well if the service has earned it. This isn't one of those types of establishments but that's just an example. Anyways the hefty young kid decides to overlook my place in the chain and help two people behind me beforehand. I watched as the lady (the 3rd person) made the exact same sandwiches one after the other (3 in a row) and he (the hefty one) packaged each and gave it to people after me.

This seemed to be the theme for me today, terrible service. 

So I see chicken fries I ordered sitting there, ready to go and just waiting to be paired with my burger. He continues to ignore it and give the matching burgers to numbers 87 and then 86 and then I asked (you have 85?) And without turning his generously proportioned body around, said yeah just a minute and continued to chitchat with his smaller counterpart. Ugh. 

Without turning around he reaches his arm back and plops my order on the counter. Ugh. That coupled with the high prices, would have resulted in -3 stars but I can't go lower than 1.",9D7pKuioWzigvboVqIcftQ,1,1,1,5GSMD1F8WCbEJSo2ocCb7g

I was about to order them separately but she suggested I order a meal and she could simply swap them and it would cost me a little less. Never heard of that one before. My chicken sandwich and onion rings were good. Well, four stars for the service. The food is pretty much the usual.",5ux19sySAIQwau4p9nJtPQ,0,0,4,EexBMFR-4als6zgf0fA1BQ

5523270,2017-04-07,0,vLpm63d_fxnbtiZTlbrQDA,"People, this is an AIRPORT food place, so YES IT WILL BE MORE PRICEY THAN YOUR LOCAL CORNER fast food place. This should be expected when you're eating at the airport. 

I needed to get lunch, and yelped a few places in terminal 3, and none had good reviews. What I looked for in reviews was Bad food, poisoning or stomach issues, and burger king didn't have any of those bad reviews, so I decided to give it a try. 

Cashier was just fine... She's just doing her job, as a cashier in an airport fast food place, give her a break. Imagine how many people are complaining to her about the prices, and obviously she does not have anything to do with it. 

My Whopper was served fast and tasted very good. Fries was good too, which is often a gamble with fast food places. 

I approve this place... Better than buying a cold cardboard tasting sandwich for $10 at any other food shops in terminal 3.",msdArKXn2Iqz9LiA4o0JPg,0,0,5,E-7NpW6aNdEEVYJMguN42A

Compared to some of the crap that you get prepackaged in the refrigerated cases, I welcome BK any time, vs an old tuna sandwich.  Service during breakfast was ridiculously quick.

I guess they make enough profit from the $5 bottled waters and overpriced meals. Also, their ice machine ran out.

As all places in the airport, this place demands $13 for a meal. Not a huge fan of the crazy markups that are at airports and thus gets a 2 Star. Service was fine, but the staff that gave your food seemed a little annoyed all the time and she never acknowledges when you say thank you. The cashier was a good friendly guy however.",vpKztzVtUop4A3QzVmHXFA,0,0,2,lUdyJUuYHKPlQv86RZOBuQ

Not only have they almost doubled the prices of almost every other Burger King as well as expecting you to pay tax, but they don't even have the full menu. Despite being unhappy about the price, I opted for a substitute, that should have been good- it had onion rings, bacon and BBQ sauce.  My bun was a bit burnt and the flavors all bland. Not worth it at all.",qghfakCHOlL3hvUwbnuZVw,1,0,1,8o-9FqZpqYH-riwqSeq5Hw
