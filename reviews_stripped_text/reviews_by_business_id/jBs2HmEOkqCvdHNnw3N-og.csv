It was incredibly busy and loud but he was still timely and checked up often, we never had to try and get his attention. I don't think he was an employee of theirs but there was also a gentleman going around making and giving out balloon animals/shapes, he was absolutely terrific with my nephew and even had me laughing, he was definitely the icing on the already amazing cake for this experience.",nKMqwYrCCzkfnrUZ4GSc1A,0,0,4,rA2RqZB-H2P6_ObL8UR_RQ

I ordered the fiery ghost pepper burger with a side of garlic herb fries. My girlfriend ordered the new BBQ pork burger with a side of regular steak fries. Her daughter ordered a kids pizza and a side of fries. 

It took a while to get our food but not terribly long. None the less both my fries and my girlfriends fries were cold but we were so hungry we just decided to eat them. My girlfriends daughter didn't get her pizza at least 15-20 minutes after we received our meals. So Cassandra offered to bring her out some fries while we waited. By the time her pizza came out my food along with my girlfriends was cold as well. 

When we first ordered our meals we asked for 2 sauces for my girlfriend and myself. It took us asking Cassandra 3 additional times to finally get some dipping sauce 20 mins after receiving our already cold food. 

My girlfriend was not pleased with her BBQ pulled pork burger. It came with pickles after she asked Cassandra to have them removed. And I never received my garlic herb fries. Over all this was a tough Sunday evening experience, I'm moving to this area and I really hope this isn't the normal service because this is my is one of my family's favorite places to eat.",0jFMI6DgIswPtLjFkwCqzg,0,0,1,WOp77E6OenzDVgANuKUxWA

But a lot of the clientele, at this location anyways, hasn't. The majority maybe have their drivers license, maybe. (Families w/ kids. Lot's of families) But there I was, the biker couple, the lesbian couple, the funny retired couple, even my nextdoor neighbors (with their new born) were there. You too could be there!

Sunday late lunch, early dinner.

Sit in one of the 5-6 booths in the Bar Area! Much calmer. There is also the bar itself. 3-4 TV's for ""The Game"" so you can hang out and scarf your burger and beer (or cocktail). I recommend the 22oz. draft beers. They also have a couple ""Bottomless"" non-alcoholic Limeade drinks. All you want for $3.99. 
 
Stuffed! The folks I was with are eaters, and still the portions did their duty. Chips w/ warmed Artichoke & Spinach dip. Towering Onion Rings served like a Fisher / Price toy. http://www.fisher-price.com/img/product_shots/71050_d_1.jpg?1216605372668  Ahhhh 'comfort food"". Burger was fine. Bun was a bit hard. I scarfed it. But it is a $9 burger, could be better.
 
Didn't get into it. But I hear the steak fries are endless, as in All you Can Eat. 
And then the dessert menu arrives. NO WAY!! Next time.

Red Robin. A higher end Applebee's. If that means anything. The crew did a fine job! Cooking and presentation were great. Service was genuine and attentive. They did take care of us. Probably will of you too. Hours: Sun-Thu: 11a-10p, Fri-Sat: 11a-11p

3 starts because of the service! The kid crowd almost lost that 3rd star though.

Take 95 to W. Ann. 
West of 95, first turn is Centennial Center Blvd. up aways Cross W. Tropical Pkwy, continue about 50yards turn left. Red Robin is off to the left back side of lot. The roads out here are a work in progress. These directions should be fine though.

Oohhh my goodness....my brain can't think because it is SOO LOUD IN HERE!  Now I remember why back in the days I would bring my baby here.  Because no matter how loud she screams no one notices. LOL  I think its so loud that you actually have to yell to communicate with the person you are with so its all an ugly vicious cycle. 

Sunday afternoon we decided on a burger-lunch and thought it had been so long since we had been here.  Now we remember why. hahah The waiting area was full but must have been for a large party because our party of 2 got seated right away.  Every seat in this place was full.  Tons of large parties full of families and friends!  Maybe the after-church crowds as well.  So much I forgot about this place-not a frequent favorite just for the fact there aren't too many healthy options here.  If you can control yourself they do serve salads.  I'm just not sure how healthy they are since I'm not the one who can order salad with a menu that has fantastic pictures enticing your blurred and echoing thinking.  

We were literally seated for less than 5 minutes when our waitress came to apologize for the wait.  Wait?  What wait?  Very nice girl but a little ditsy.  I don't generally go for burgers anywhere.  I usually opt for the grilled chicken for a healthier choice.  Today I was going all out.  Here's what we ordered:

Whisky BBQ burger - slightly greasy bun, topped with a juicy on the inside burger with crispy onion strings and a smoky bbq sauce.  Yes I didn't go for the lowest in calorie/fat option.  It was pretty great though.  I had to cut it in fourths so I could actually eat it in a nice non-messy way.  My once a year indulgence didn't fail me...er-until just now.....SHOW STOPPER....  Might I say how disgusted I am now that I looked at the nutritional value of this burger....Oh my freakin gawd......1138 calories 70 grams of fat!  HOLY SHIT!  My hour workout that night didn't even put a dent in that!  (not even funny right now) Sniff sniff.....Tear.

to continue....BF ordered a regular cheese burger with mustard and crispy onion strings.  He said it was the best he's had in a long time.  He ordered a side of coleslaw and loved it.

....and don't forget the ""bottomless steakfries""...its what they advertise on TV.  ...and I am not even looking at the nutritional value of these! God help me here!  I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of steak fries but I ate a few anyway.  I've seen other reviews about the seasoning on the tables.  Nothing (at all) special to me.  The fries are dry anyway and the seasoning doesn't even stick.  So ""eh"" on the fries. Maybe I will substitute them next time-FOR SALAD (disgusted still).  BTW we didn't need bottomless as there were plenty that we didn't finish....Thank God!

Customer service is outstanding.  The manager checked on our table several times.  Drinks never ran low and our server was super attentive in the midst of her many other tables.  I am often amazed when someone can juggle all that and still be pleasant and attentive.  I know.  Yes agreed...that's how it should be.

Overall the place is fun, loud and perfect to bring your really boisterous family and friends to clog their arteries!  Enjoy THAT would ya!  =)",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,9,7,3,WOXf0T7kjRVBtMBSu3_kAg

I don't think I've had a worse tasting guacamole bacon burger. 

We made a to go order. I arrived a few minutes after the scheduled pick up time (approx 30 minutes after we ordered), waited an additional 30 minutes to get the food. It's a 5 minute drive back to my house and in the 7 minutes it took to drive home and unload, all our food was stone cold. I'm pretty reluctant to believe that it went from piping hot to stone cold in a matter of minutes. It honestly tasted like it had been left sitting & waiting for the 30 minutes I waited to even get the food. 

Overall, everything was highly unimpressive. My mom and stepdad ordered the simple burger and both said it was just okay. Huge disappointment to pay $10 for a burger comparable to something you'd get from McDonalds or Wendy's. 

And then my guacamole bacon burger. I'm not sure why they say it has guacamole in it, I couldn't even taste it. I could barely tell it had guacamole on it. The bacon was subpar. I asked for pickles, they weren't on it. And again, it was stone cold by the time we got to eat it. Not warm in the slightest. Completely cold. Which is odd since I've ordered take out often enough to have experienced that it doesn't usually get cold after less than 10 minutes. 

Overall, it was a complete waste of an hour and $50. I wish I had just run to the grocery store and gotten stuff to make burgers myself. Not only would we have eaten sooner, but it would have tasted far better. Also, since it appears no one from the restaurant actually checks the Yelp reviews, I plan on calling the restaurant and sharing my experience. I will update with what they say.

UPDATE: I did call & speak with a manager. She was very kind & listened intently as I explained my experience. She offered to send a gift card to cover the cost of our meal so we can try it again. She did say that it was unusual for food to be cold & acknowledged the long wait. I very much appreciate the gesture and we will try it again. I will update my review after we try it again. Since the review was about the food specifically & not the service, I won't be changing it at this time. But maybe when we trying it again.",hN5gz8s11EXRuxkKG7q-Zw,1,0,1,w9lKTsjyWBw8xPQJ3D0AbQ

Ordered two ""tavern double burgers"" as that was the special they were running.  Is it my imagination, or are the burgers tiny now?  For a double-patty hamburger, both our entrees were more along the size of a White Castle burger, the wife correctly pointed out.  We left the place after an appetizer, two beers and two burgers, and we were still hungry.  It was an oddly upsetting feeling.

And if you've been to a Red Robin lately, you've noticed the little tablet computers mounted at each table, that allow you to see menu items, pay your bill, play a little game and GET A $2 ENTERTAINMENT FEE added to your bill.  Yes, for the privilege of trouncing three anonymous strangers at a trivia game, I was charged an extra $2.  Mind you, there is NO warning about this charge when you play the game.  That is unacceptable.

Sautéed 'Shroom (4/5): Requested a little pink, I like a juicy burger! It was pretty good, I just wish it was seasoned a little more. You know a burger is da bomb when you don't have to add much to make it taste good.

I always order the Bonzai Burger with a vegetarian patty. I love the flavors and the burgers are pretty big. In fact, I always cut mine in half as soon as it arrives and put half of it in a to-go container (after all, I filled up on fries!). The meatless patty is standard, not a house-made concoction, so not much more than what I could cook at home.

I really like that they encourage family socialization with chalkboard activities and I like the ability to order and check out using an iPad at the table. Best of all, I like that you get a free dessert when you come for your birthday!

I had the chicken and waffles special since I was not in a huge mood for a burger and I wanted to try something new.  The sauce they use does not really match with what I would have wanted in a chicken/waffles dish/sandwich.  It was a runny spicy kind of sauce, I would have thought it would be a creamy or ranch like sauce.  It wasn't.  Then came the larger disappointment, the waffle was cold, dense, and not appealing at all.
I came in later in the evening after working all day, so I really wanted to sit at the bar, but the bar and the seats were messy.  The entire bar area seemed to not to be clean.
Nothing to really brag about that $12.99 sandwich other than a $5 sandwich from other fast food joints.",4K4Hhmcd_KXgYI3RXT6lTw,1,0,2,fON2c1EMbtgCWLyco7GNWQ

At this location I might not be able to recreate the 90's but the quality and the bottomless fries remain the same.  No longer is their any tarter sauce but a cornucopia of sauces.  One my most recent visit, I indulged in a garlic dipping sauce-MY NEW FAVORITE.

This location can get busy at times but is well worth the wait.  I have found the servers to be on point.  My drink is never empty for long, my fries always keep coming and it is never with any attitude.

First off they have great service and are very friendly, we got seated immediately as we were over 21 and went to the bar area. We got the short stack of onion rings (6 rings) and was a lot for me and my lady. The ranch and ""secret"" sauces are great compliments to the onion rings which were hot, crispy, and a good flavor. I had the collossus burger with fries and my lady had the bleu ribbon burger with a BOCA burger substitute and broccoli.  Its great to see that red robins offers the likes of BOCA burgers and gardenburgers as substitutes at no extra cost!  The wait was minimal and the food arrived hot. The steak fries are awesome and the broccoli was also great, especially being bottomless made it all that much better! My burger (collossus) had a burger, brisket, grilled onions, and two types of sauces from what I was reading and it was great! Nice burger flavor, the brisket was tender (could have used a little more brisket but great non the less) the onions were sweet and caramelized to greatness. The colossus was a definite win!! My ladies bleu ribbon burger with a BOCA burger was awesome!! The BOCA tasted very mild compared to a regular burger so the flavors of the supporting ingredients (onions straws, steak sauce, chipotle aioli, lettuce, tomatoes, and bleu cheese) really stood out and had a big taste profile which would almost been forgotten with a regular beef burger. It has been 6+ yrs since ive had red robins and im glad to say that the product is the same and they still have great burgers.

We were excited walking in- he already knew he wanted the Whisky River BBQ burger with sweet potato fries. 

Cons:
1. We were seated at a visibly dirty booth. I used my hands to sweep the crumbs off the table and seat before the hostess put down the menus and didn't offer to wipe the table down or seat us elsewhere.
2. Service was slow, it took us over 30 minutes from the time we put our order in to receive an incomplete order. My boyfriend got through half his burger before his fries came.
3. The cheese on both of our sandwiches was coagulated on top of the meat and my bun was really soggy- must've been sitting in the window for a while.
4. The bathrooms were a little dirty.

Pros:
1. Most of the food was good; onion rings and vanilla milkshakes especially. 
2. Regular fries come bottomless (we usually upgrade our side though).

All in all, we probably won't be back to Red Robin for a while- if I had another choice for burgers (in this case you have at least 2- In-N-Out and Smashburger) I would probably head there. There's a certain expectation of service for $40 at a burger joint, and RR was severely disappointing this time around.",lluNN1aQlFN7NQQ2BxFBUQ,4,0,2,pL6twrctNxIY46q1XiI52Q

I've never thought the food was that great, but the shakes are awesome and the kids used to like it. Going in there now is the utmost test in patience and tolerance.  The service is horrible (more because they seem understaffed than because the servers are inept), and there are fewer menu options and higher prices.  The number of kids in there and the noise level will drive you to drink; but not there, because the glasses are dirty and the manager will tell you that boogers on the glasses are just scratches.  Oh, and the bathroom is disgusting. If there is no soap and the trash is overflowing, then I'm not sure any of the employees are going in there let alone washing their hands.

BF had the Prime Chophouse burger with horseradish sautéed mushrooms and I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger with onion straws.

The boxes include instructions on how to reheat the fries so that they will be just as good as you would get in the restaurant, and they include packets of the Red Robin seasoning.  I would have given this experience 5 stars but, we also got the pretzel bits with cheese as an appetizer and they were so salty I couldn't even eat them.

THE 2 BASKETS OF FRIES HAD 8 FRIES INSIDE OF THEM EACH. MAYBE 9 AT THE MOST. So after we quickly make the 16-18 french fries disappear, we ask our waiter for more fries and refills on our drinks. He then refills our lemonades (that taste even worse than the previous glasses) and brings out 2 more baskets of bottomless fries. This time the baskets have 7 fries each now. And thats the last time we see our waiter. We get our food from different servers. 10 minutes after we recieve our food, the waiter brings us the bill without even asking us if we were going to have dessert. Very poor  customer service.

We werent even done with our food and he drops the bill on us. My brother ordered bottomless rootbeer floats and had to track down the waiter to get his refill.

shoot they aren't kidding with that commercial are they!

Came here for the 1st time with family. There were about 6 of us. It was lunch time on a monday. Wasn't too busy but there were about 5 waitresses working. 

Can I tell you that 4 of them were gathered in a circle by where the food comes out just chit chatting. I was getting pissed standing there by the hostess' stand while the girls were chatting about their weekend. I literally had to speak up and say ""excuse me!"" Normally im not so straight forward, but hey, i was 5 months pregnant, starving and obviously my hormones were raging. Not the person to mess with FYI. Minus one star.

We were sat immediately after my comment and I turned to my husband and said if we get one of those girls I'm going to scream..

Luckily for all the other patrons in the restaurant we were given another waitress.. one you could tell was working her ass off. WTG! Now i was a happy camper! She quickly got us our drinks and asked if it was our first time or  if we had any questions.

Looking at the menu I quickly knew I was going to have a hard time choosing. I was stuck between the mouthwatering chicken sandwich. Another with bacon and onion straws or my favorites caesar salad & tortilla soup. What made it even harder was that the 1st two choices came with unlimited fries. You heard me... UNLIMITED FRIES! Thats a pregnant womans dream.

Knowing that my hubby was getting a burger I opted for the salad and soup and figured i'd be a ""naughty"" girl and steal some of his fries. I mean, shoot they're unlimited so why not.

While waiting for our food, I turned and OMG those 4 people were still just standing there talking.. I was about to ask for the manager when i noticed a manager walking over to them and scolding. Dang! about time. They only cost the company an hours worth of pay!

The food was delish. Fries were always warm and seasoned to perfection. My salad had freshly cut lettuce and enough crutons for my hearts desires. My tortilla soup was perfect. I asked for extra cheese and sour cream. hey, im pregnant, im allowed those extra carbs! And it made it so rich and thick. Mmm, mmm. 

Our waitress continued to give us fantastic service. our drinks were always full. Fries always on the way. Ranch for our fries too. My party and I left happy and full.

I was with my daughter, foreign exchange student and adorable granddaughter. She was arguably not as adorable as she could be that evening as she was very hungry.  Our server, a very polite young man, promptly brought her chocolate milk.  As he set down in front of her he mentioned that he would bring two baskets of bottomless fries.

I took my granddaughter to the front of the restaurant to get a free balloon and walk around the foyer and came back. No fries. Eventually I saw our server and flagged him down. I asked him for crackers, fries, anything. . . 

He was apologetic and kind and brought fries.  They came at the same time as our entrees.  My granddaughter had the grilled cheese sandwich that came with fries.  She picked one up and immediately let fall back to the plate because it was hot.  That seemed acceptable and normal, but when I picked up my fries from my cod burger they were not hot.  I immediately began feeding her my fries.  I didn't get to eat my cod burger until we got home but I really liked it.

It was a family driven atmosphere with balloons, kitschy wall adornments, and a large fiberglass bird mascot in the dining room. Kids were welcomed with crayons and a small arcade. The kids menu was colorful and the menu was largely fried and burger based, and it was great. 

Unfortunately, times have changed and Red  Robin is going through a ""modernization"" of sorts. Gone are all the movie posters and even the fiberglass bird mascot. Now it is trying to be hip, cool, sleek and modern. Even the balloons and crayons are gone. It is trying to be a higher end gourmet burger place that seem to be the trend in the USA. I am not happy about the change and miss the way it used to be. 

On my last visit to the Red Robin in Centennial Center, the decor was modern boring. The kids menus were photocopied in black and white, and crayons were not offered. Service was not as quick as it used to be, though the food quality was the same as I remember.

Went here because I am a member of the Royal Club which means you are entitled to any burger on their menu for free for your birthday! How's that for being a member? I highly recommend you join their club so you can cash in on this birthday deal. Just go to their website: www.redrobin.com and sign up.

What I got was the Berserker Burger which was inspired by the movie Wolverine. It is a flavorful combination of zesty Aioli, Sriracha Onion Straws, Spicy Pickles, and Cheddar Cheese on a Brioche Bun. This burger is for a limited time only so get it while its still available! Of course, with any burger that you choose, you get their signature bottomless Steak Fries! Don't forget to put the patented Red Robin fry seasoning on there as well.

Service was good. We were greeted right away and was sat down. Our server came around and got our orders. I made sure to let her know I had the free birthday burger. I know some places when you get free stuff the quality of service tends to go down because of the big discount on the overall check. Our server did very well and I tipped her like I never had the free burger so she really deserved it.

The only thing that made me subtract a star is that when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, there were paper towels all over the floor. I notified a manager and they said they will take care of it. After finishing my meal which was about half an hour later, I went back to the bathroom again to wash my hands and it was still the same.

When I asked them to fix my meal, all they did was take the burger back to the kitchen and wipe the sauce off with a napkin. The worst part of that is not only the napkin debris on my burger, but they didn't get all the sauce off. It was terrible.

We were supposed to get ""bottomless fries"" and my wife went her whole meal without getting fries. They put 6-7 fries on her plate initially then we waited about 15 minutes before we had to chase down the ever so rude waitress and ask her if we could have more fries. 

My daughters mac&cheese looked more like soup than mac&cheese.

Terrible service from our waitress Holly T. and the food sucked as well. They did nothing to fix my situation or make sure I was satisfied as a customer.

On top of the rude service, wrong order and dirty looks from the staff, I was overcharged on my bill.

The place was pretty empty, not surprising since it was only 11am and they just opened. We were seated and given water. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder to share since we didn't want to get too full before the burgers came. The waitress brought it out in two small cups, which was very nice. The soup was light, but very flavorful and pretty yummy. Each cup came with a small piece of bread that went perfect with the soup. 

My boyfriend ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger and I ordered the Pub Burger.  Both orders came with bottomless steak fries.  We also ordered peach tea and freckled lemonade, both were bottomless as well.

The Pub was okay, nothing too great. The Guac Bacon Burder, however, was mouthwatering and the steak fries were very savory; I probably had mine refilled like 3 times.

Red Robin is one of those places you go to as an adult to grab a beer and burger without thinking about it.  We went over the weekend for our first Red Robin experience and was pleasantly surprised to see how crowded it was.  I assumed that, based on the number of seats taken that it would be a great place to eat a burger.  I also noticed that majority of the patrons were families with small children, so the whole beer and burger thing may be a tad of a stretch, at least for the crowd I saw.

We ordered the classic with cheese and some steak fries, a mint shake and one soda.  The shake comes with the mixer container still half full, which was nice for the five dollar price tag, and was a fairly good shake.  Standard, nothing mind blowing or amazing, but good.  The burgers came out really fast, and I was happy with the short wait.  They were wrapped in wax paper and came in baskets, which was nostalgic.  To top it off, they were huge!  I couldn't wrap my mouth around one, for some reason.  Still, once I took the first bite I was satisfied but not pleased.  I expected their burgers to somehow be different, more authentic or genuine in taste, but I didn't get that.  Although a good burger, I could get the same one for less somewhere else.  Overall, good burger and fries (especially since they are endless refills), but nothing that I'd go back for.

Great service, good burger and shakes, and fun little games in the lobby.  Hey--those kids were ga ga over the burgers, so I guess they're doing something worth while.  For me, personally, it was okay but I won't be back.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,2,3,E86BBpjEEQAAJaVm17BxWg

For my party of 2, it was about 20 minutes. They take down your number and text you when your table is ready so you can leave if you'd like. It was cold out so we stayed in the waiting area. I liked that there was plenty of seating and a chalkboard for kids (and adults) to draw on. 

The host, Jorge was running around bussing tables and seating customers. Although he was super busy, he was very nice and helpful. We were seated in a booth in the bar area. Our server was the bartender so she wasn't as attentive as I'd like. Understandable though as she had to make all the drinks and serve people at the bar.... but there were only 4 people at the bar and her other table already got their check. Service was pretty slow but she was nice enough. Our food took over 35 minutes to come out and it wasn't hot.... Not sure how long it sat on the window but someone should have ran it out for the bartender. 

I ordered the whisky bbq burger and it was pretty good. Cooked medium, just as requested. I did wish that the cheese was melted though. The cheddar cheese on the burger wasn't even slightly melted at all and it was lacking in veggies. Other than that, if you love bbq, I'd highly recommend it. Fries were also cold but I love their unlimited steak fries regardless! 

Not the worst experience I've had at a Red Robin but not the best either. I'll probably ask to sit in the regular dining area next time or sit directly at the bar to get better service.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,1,0,3,cl4nRB0e0yED62hK8GWKKA

I did order the Banzai Burger, like I always do, as well as a Baily Irish Cream shake and a coke. I love pineapples, so the pineapples on the Banzai burger is always a plus, it just gives that fruity twist to a burger. The Baily's Irish Cream shake is always good, I usually finish that, before I even get my burger. Since I usually finish my shake before the food gets there, then ordering a coke is always a good thing, since you get free refills on coke. 

The place itself is very spacious, and I like that you can move around, with out hitting a table or some one. The staff was really nice and right there, when your ready to take your order. Also I like the fact that they come around to check on you, to see if you need refills on drinks or fries.

3085638,2015-12-25,0,jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og,"The service here is absolutely incredible. I was seated right away around 4PM Christmas Eve evening.

Right away I was given a menu and an order for my beverage. The server told me about their rewards program and how to use the Ziosk module at the table. The Ziosk can be utilized to order drinks, desserts, shakes, and even call the server when the server is not present. It can also be used to pay the bill with a credit/debit card, and even has gaming capabilities for 1.99.

I started off with the shorter stack of onion rings that came with ranch and what tasted like BBQ ranch for dipping. I was given 6 onion rings, all of which were not too hot but satisfyingly warm. The only thing I did not enjoy would be that the onion rings were too large to dip into the dipping cups, so I would either have to cut them with the knife or fold them. Other than that, the onion rings were flavorful and easily some of the best onion rings I have had in a while.

I ordered a grilled caesar salad, which did not have a picture in the menu, so I would think that it would be a chopped up salad with croutons and dressing. However, what I was served was a medium-small head of romaine lettuce cut in half what was lightly oiled and grilled with a slice of lemon. The halves of lettuce were garnished with dressing and Parmesan cheese. The crouton was a bias-cut piece of French bread that was toasted. My first thoughts were, ""How am I supposed to eat this?"" Initially, I ate the salad with a fork and knife, but found it easier to just grab the root of the lettuce and munch away. Not a bad taste at all! It was something that I was not expecting but was still satisfying.

The Nacho Crunch Tavern Burger was a great burger, but it did not live up to its name. Not once did I have a ""crunch"" while eating this burger. For a moment while consuming this burger, I wondered if they had given me the correct order. I upgraded my fries to garlic Parmesan fries; did not taste garlic nor Parmesan. The extra upgrade only made the fries dryer. I had another order of the same fries and they still tasted dry. Not as much flavor as I had expected.

For dessert, my server gave me the birthday sundae for free after asking me if I like ice cream. This was rather nice, I thought. The only downside would be that the spoon used for the sundae  could not touch the bottom of the sundae bowl; I ended up scooping the chocolate at the bottom with my the tip of my knife. I also had the Freckled Lemonade cake, which was very sweet and full of flavor. It was so sweet it almost gave me a headache, however. It was still quite delicious and totally embodied the essence of their Freckled Lemonade. One thing I would like to say would be that I order the cake through the Ziosk, but it did not come until I had asked for it.

This was a very memorable experience. It was not perfect at all, but from how I was treated, it makes me want to come back for another visit. Red Robin is an excellent restaurant. Their service has dramatically changed from when I first visited them years ago. Although the food was not as good as I thought would be, the service was incredible. I'm sure if I come again I would give them their fifth star. Come to Red Robin for an unforgettable, gourmet burger experience!",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,0,0,4,6vF5KcdSoCY3_4V-fMKcwQ

For whatever reason, they remodeled the whole restaurant and took down all the cool movie posters they had on the walls. Even though there's less there, it feels more cluttered now. The tables are so close to each other that your basically sitting inches from the people next to you.

Usually, the food isn't horrible. I've always had a soft spot for their steak fries. When they're done right, they are so good and you can't beat the perk of ""bottomless"" fries. This time around I went with a new burger on the menu, the smoke and pepper burger. I don't know what they did but it was terrible. The first bite I took, I felt like I literally just ate a spoonful of salt. It wasn't very hot either and the bottom bun was soggy so I think it was sitting for a while. 

We usually only come here when we have a group and no one can decide what to eat. It's been a while since we've been there so I can't be sure but I believe they raised their prices too.

She told them that she'll take them right back. She walked away for a minute, then came back and took another family instead that seemed to be waiting outside. Which is annoying, but I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt. If they were here first, they should be taken back first. Another hostess, an older woman, came and asked if we have been helped. I said no we have not. No further acknowledgment. She was stumbling through some menus when a new couple entered and said ""I got a text that said we were ready to be seated"" she then took them back right away. Still skipping over myself, and the couple that was here before me. Both of us were upset. When a third hostess came, she took the first couple back. My Fiancé and I were now the only people in the front room. And still, have not been helped. Finally the older woman came back.

At this point, we are peaking out the window to see if there was a wait at Olive Garden. But we were in the mood for a burger and we thought that maybe it's just busy. We FINALLY got seated and the place was not very busy at all. The food was good, which is why I am giving them 3 stars.

I tend to get the banzai burger, but I have tried the Ramen Burger (which was surprisingly tasty), and recently the Wedge Burger which is a protein style. I got the meat with no pink this time, which sadly I think does take away from a juicy flavor that is attained when there is pink in the meat.  They have a poutine which I've had twice. The first time wasn't too memorable, but recently had it and it seemed tastier. But definitely seems fattening!

The service has been great both times we have come here , friendly staff and even the manager has come by to chat with us both times as well. This is fine and dandy , but service needs to be good along with the food , and that's where i had to lose some points on. 

The first stop i ordered the new ""special"" which is the big bacon burger. I asked for BBQ sauce on the side , medium cooked burger.  My wife ordered the patty melt well done ...    When we received the burgers , they were opposite.  My wife received the medium and i received the well done.  We could have sent them back , but at that point we just wanted to eat ( we had an appointment to get to ).  The well done burger for me... had way to much char flavor. 

The second time my wife ordered the same thing , well done again ... came out medium.  The place was packed and it took quite a while to get our food , so once again sending it back was not an option. 
I was not in the mood for a burger that night so i tried the fish and chips along with a side of their clam chowdah ! .  The chowdah! was actually quite tasty , thick and had nice sized chunks of clams in it.   4 star .

Red Robin has a great selection of burgers and chicken sandwiches and their Vegan/Veggie alternatives are adequate for even the pickiest eaters. The bottomless fries with multiple dipping sauces is a great touch and the burgers are juicy and delicious. My only gripe with the burger itself is that it was way too messy and basically fell apart in my hands. Not sure if it was the soggy bun or the 2 lbs of sauce dripping out but it was an inconvenience and happens every time I eat here.

Mainly visited Red Robin since we hadn't been there in quite a while.  With so many burger joint options out there you can see why!  Red Robin does offer some tasty options though on their updated menu.

Wifey ordered their beast of a burger, the A.1. Peppercorn - gourmet burger topped with hardwood-smoked bacon, pepper-jack cheese, A.1. peppercorn spread, tomatoes, and crispy onion straws on an onion bun.  Sucker comes with a steak knife skewered right through it!  Wifey liked it, except she's still not a big onion fan, even if they come battered and fried.  I took a bite and thought it was good, the A.1. peppercorn spread having just enough bite & tang to go with the spicy pepper-jack cheese.  Onion straws gave it great texture, the tomato added some freshness, and the bacon was nice & salty.

I ordered the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double - double patty combo of ghost pepper sauce, pepper-jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and fried AND fresh sliced jalapenos!  The Tavern burgers are known as their 'value' menu burgers, they are a smaller patty on a smaller bun.  So this burger even though small, packed quite a bite!  The ghost pepper sauce had a real big kick, but not so hot that you wouldn't enjoy eating your burger.  The fried jalapenos were a nice contract in texture, and went along great with the fresh jalapenos.  Tis spicy!   

Of course at Red Robin the big appeal is their dang Bottomless Fries that come with each burger you order.  All you can eat baby!  Carbs be damned!  Now you actually have your choice of bottomless steak fries, sweet potato fries, or BROCCOLI.  Yep folks, broccoli.  And I, as your fearless Yelp Elite, went this route.  Wifey got steak fries so I could always share with her.  Me?  Wanted to cut back on them calories so I opted for the green.  But beware!  That broccoli serving comes in a measly bowl which may have only 5-6 florets of broccoli in them.  I literally ordered 6 servings of broccoli throughout the course of my burger.  SIX!  It was actually yummy, steamed, then with a sprinkle of Red Robin seasoning by yours truly.  I will say this, too much broccoli will make you burp (from both ends).

Overall not a bad meal, par for the course of a burger chain.  But Red Robin burgers are a bit pricey, wifey's set me back near $12, and mine was around $9.  Most times I would rather opt for a burger joint like In N Out or Five Guys.  Save money, save calories!  Okay, with Five Guys fries...maybe not.

This is a huge burger chain and they know what they are doing!  It isn't a fancy place, but it is a very toddler/kid friendly restaurant.  This is great since my mini me is very much a toddler and gets into everything these days.  It is a very comfortable place for families to go, as well as to grab a tasty burger!

The menu is mostly fantastic burgers, but it seems every time I go there are even more options like salads, chicken sandwiches, fish options, and even pastas.  I have only had the burgers and the fish n' chips and have loved every bite.  You really can't go wrong with any of the burgers, though my faves are the Beresker, A1, and the Bleu Ribbon burgers.  Yum, yum, yummy!  And a little bit of drool too.

Now for the best part about Red Robin....Bottomless Steak Fries!  The fries here are amazing, especially with the special Red Robin Seasoning.  I love these fries and probably eat at least half of my body weight in them every time I go to RR.  

They also have a great loyalty card that you can sign up for.  Every 10th burger/entree you buy is free, you get a free burger during your birthday month, and you get a lot of freebies throughout the year.  And it is all free.  I love free!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,6,6,4,Mwhj_xZqVqe2BEb5kU7ivg

Ironically, burgers were not the primary reason I went in to Red Robin last week.  It was Cinco de Mayo and I really wanted a margarita and some Mexican food.  My dreams were quickly dashed when I passed up on two restaurants because of the corwded parking lots and busy mad house dining rooms.  I saw the Red Robin next to the Michoacan restaurant and figured they would have a bar that could serve me up a margarita and would perhaps not be too busy.  My hunch paid off and I got my margarita and dinner with little wait.  Since I was hoping for Mexican food and that is not he specialty of Red Robin  I went with the next best thing and ordered a guacamole bacon burger.  It did not look like much when it came out to me but you really cannot judge a book by its cover.  This burger was superb.  the guacamole was there and delicious without overwhelming the rest of the burger components. I was able to taste each topping as well as the awesome beefiness of the patty.  I could taste the char and it reminded me of a 4th of July backyard BBQ.  Oh, the memories that came flooding back to my mind.  All with one simple bite of a burger.

4655250,2014-11-11,9,jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og,"THIS RED ROBIN FLIES ABOVE 3.5 STARS

   The Red Robin came to life in Seattle many years ago in 1969 as a gourmet burger restaurant. From that one restaurant, the Red Robin has flown across the American and Canadian landscape landing in several cities to take the casual dining customer under its wings. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, Red Robin has treated customers to an upbeat casual dining experience featuring a menu of gourmet burgers, specialty sandwiches, appetizing adult beverages, and dessert. In recent times, the Red Robin is soaring above some of its competition with thier bottomless fries. 

  Over twenty years have flown by since I last visited the Red Robin back in New York. I remember enjoying the food, but Long Islanders at the time did not take to the Red Robin causing it to relinquish it's space in the Smith Haven Mall to TGI Friday's. Twenty years later and last week, my brother and I were walking around the new-sprung Downtown Summerlin and took notice that a Red Robin is arriving the second week of November. So, yesterday after my brother and I left Floyd Lamb State Park (or Tulle Springs), it was in the top of my mind to have dinner in the Centennial Center Red Robin. And that is what we did. 

  When we walked into the relatively large waiting room, the attentive hostess let us know that there was a booth or table in the lounge, which is one of the two rooms in the restaurant, that she walked us to. The lounge features a bar and two large screen monitors that were at the time of the visit showing the NFL Green Bay verse Chicago game. At 9 P.M. on a Sunday the room was as quiet as a robin. 

  The pages of the menu displayed several burger sandwiches including the gourmet burger. My mind was set on fish and chips. These days I have been in the mood for fish and chips. Red Robin did not let me down. The three pieces of breaded fish had the right texture and crunch. The fish was the way I like it. I'd squeeze the lemons over the fish before dipping them in tarter sauce. But where was the Cole slaw? If there was that delicious Cole slaw that many restaurants serve with fish and chips, this red robin could of been flying above four stars. Where they scrimped on the Cole slaw, they were generous with the bottomless fries and Coke. Our easygoing waiter Landon was on the eight ball with the fries refills. He was kind enough to give us a portion to take home. The fries exceeded my expectations. In all honesty I thought they would be filler. The Red Robin bottomless fries is both quantity and quality. The fish and chips with bottomless Coke was worth $19 when you add in the upbeat atmosphere and good service. 

  Just like a red robin, the sky is the limit for the Las Vegas casual dining customer. The fact that I plan to return to Red Robin is testimony that they are doing something right. As I write this, a Red Robin is about to hatch in Downtown Summerlin by mid November. In a few weeks or less, I see a sequal Red Robin dining adventure in their newest location at Downtown Summerlin.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,11,3,90OU8IVqD0iUxKLsxUvm2w

For starters, I ordered a chili cheeseburger and bottomless fries and my friend order a bacon cheeseburger with the bottomless fries. The burger was good but messy, that's expected with a chili burger though. I liked the flavor of the burger and the chili. My friend enjoyed her burger too.

The fries could have had more seasoning but it was nothing the house seasoning salt mixture couldn't fix. I like the bottomless fries idea. They were hot and fresh and the just kept coming and coming.

We didn't order an appetizer because there was too much to choose from. The waitress asked if we wanted some fries while we waited. That was cool! I much rather have fries over bread.

Now back to the beginning, the waitress took forever to get to us. She walked past use multiple times and most times she didn't make Eye contact. She kept saying, one moment guys. This was even before we ordered drinks.

After about 10 minutes, she came over and took our drink order. She then left again. She came back after just a couple minutes and dropped off our drinks. We were ready to order, but she said, ""one minute guys."" She kept passing us over and over. She was taking orders for other tables. Then she put their orders in and came back to us.

She asked if we wanted appetizers. We told said, ""No"" and then she asked if we just wanted some fries. We said, ""yes"" to the fries and it only took a couple minutes to get them. She sat them down and was off again. She came back after 3 or 4 minutes and thanked us for our patients.

We ordered and it took us maybe 7 or 8 minutes to get our burgers. We wanted more fries within that timeframe, but the waitress went missing again. We just had to wait until the food came out. It took us like 12-15 minutes to eat and she didn't stop by not one time.

I thought I was being smart when I used the machine thingy on the table to request that the waitress stop by. I felt so stupid when she passed us time after time, even though the red light was flashing on the machine. Also, while waiting, we decided to order some dessert. I ordered using the machine, since the waitress was no where to be found.

She finally stopped by. I asked if I had ordered correctly and she looked through the machine, turned off the blinking light and told me yes, my dessert order was in. I asked for more fries at that time, and I didn't see her again until she brought the fries and dessert out, at the same time, it took maybe 6 minutes. We finished everything and got the hell out of there.

Like I mentioned before. The food was good, but the service was hell.

Not bad, but not the best I've had.  I had a couple of discrepancies with the burger; the burger came out well done when it was ordered medium, and the egg was broken and overcooked.  The onion ring and fried mozzarella sticks appetizers were also OK.  I was not in love the appetizer sauces (marinara and tangy campfire).

The staff were super friendly and the restaurant had a playful family atmosphere.  Although it wasn't addictive I would definitely choose to eat here over a lot of other chain competitors.",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,1,1,3,hJHPVEd8Xg0WB7rGUhA6ug
4808872,2014-06-13,0,jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og,"Red Robin is a family favorite for us. I am a fan because they have a nice menu selection and they always seem to move quickly from the initial wait to be seated, if there is one at all, to getting your food.
I also like that they have had the same menu since forever, so you always know what to expect, and then of course, you just can't beat bottomless steak fries! My hubby always orders a basket of fries right when we are seated and then he just keeps them coming! This always keeps the kids busy and happy and it beats having to order an appetizer! I will say, I do miss the old baskets and the way they would wrap the burgers, not so much down with the new motif of everything now, but the food is still the same so I can let it slide. 
Another bonus is having the Rewards card because you get a point every time you order a meal, and at 10 points you get a free meal. That adds up really quickly. Plus you get a free meal on your birthday and you can register the kids for free birthday meals too, and that's not to mention all the bonus coupons and freebies they email you!

I went here last night for a kid's birthday party. Parking was scarce because there's a lot of other restaurants sharing the same lot.

My friend made reservations for our group and we got seated 20 minutes later than our reserved time which gave us time to pick what we want from the menu. We got seated and we've been ready to order but the 2 servers were not and some of us got asked for our orders twice, while the others in our group got completely skipped - lack of communication and coordination.

The servers read our orders back to us and everything was correct. I got the Whiskey River BBQ Burger no tomatoes (since it causes an anaphylactic reaction) with a side of onion rings A few minutes later they came out with our food. They were giving the wrong food to the wrong person. The server called out me food ""Whiskey River Burger no tomatoes with side of onion rings"" so I raised my hand to let them it was mine. And what did I get? A burger with tomatoes and a side of onion rings. I removed it from my burger and want going cause ruckus - I'm not a lawsuit-crazy type of person should I end up in the hospital but that's something they need to be very careful about.

A friend of mine is vegetarian so she ordered a veggie burger. They gave her a lettuce wedgie beef burger with bacon! The whole table waited for her to get the right burger but it never came and we were all famished. We were halfway done so my friend got up and talked to a different server about her order. When she got her food, we were done eating.

I will first start with the hostess. She was friendly and professional, but when we asked to be seated at a booth, we were placed in a completely packed area. Everybody in the restaurant was all seated in the same spot. There were many open seats available, but for what I assumed was convenience to the waitress we were all packed in like sardines. I finally asked my waitress if we could move to another part of the dining area.

We ordered an appetizer of onion rings. When the girl brought our onion rings she set two plates on the table and one of them had some type of red substance on the edge of it. I set the dish outside and moved on. The substance was still wet by the way. I didn't want to risk getting sick. Maybe it was old ketchup or maybe blood, haha kidding, but maybe. 

Our waitress was polite and did her job as usual. During our meal we had a few dirty plates and sauce containers that we needed removed from the table. The busboy approached the table multiple times asking if we needed anything. He even touched the dirty dish for some reason and then let it go and walk away. The dishes were obviously stacked for removal and sitting at a small table that should have been addressed.  I think if the customer has to ask for dirty dishes to be removed from the table it puts them in an awkward position.

Moving on from that, I ate my pink in the middle burger and then asked for the check. I had ordered my burger well done or at least with no pink. I did not want to cause any more static for this waitstaff. I just wanted to leave at that point.  

The waitress then brought out my bill. Wow, every time I come to this restaurant I always tell myself never again. I paid $40 for two people to eat. Two burgers,two drinks, and one stack of onion rings-40 dollars. I know it's not cheap to provide quality food these days. Food prices have risen in the past few years, but, this is ridiculous. My wife and I were doing the math during the car ride home and figured the onion rings cost $10.

So like I said, I don't like doing negative reviews but this had to be said. Red Robin charges a huge amount of money for a low quality product in my opinion. I don't think I will be returning here anytime soon.",alhJ0sQ8_pslnKlyMHyKFg,0,0,2,L-WW0_5Wac4ZIA-9FwdKbA

Once we were seated, the hostess was very kind and explained basics to us (who our server is, you need anything, etc. ect.). It didn't seem to take long for our server to get our drink order as well as our food order. Again, the restaurant was slammed!!!, and thou you could see it, the staff did a great job at being attentive to their responsibilities.

One concern we had was our food would get cold waiting, but that did not happen. When the pay tablet didn't work, the manager was quick to help us out.

In Conclusion, I know I didn't mention much about the food as I believe its well known, however, I believe that the service was some of the best I have experienced in some time at this restaurant and was really impressed.",nPDFmoDt6hKkb7TbDHLGVQ,0,0,5,xV3b4550R9tgQYuzkvavbQ
5471014,2013-03-22,0,jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og,"Meh is right. This place is way overpriced for the food you get, and service is never very good. Which is slightly understandable since EVERY time I go here, no matter when or why, it is packed. I hadn't been here since high school, when I didn't care about anything but eating junk and hanging out with my friends in the few places that teens could go to. It's a great place for that, for when you are a kid and have money to burn on low end food.
The biggest gimmick they have is their 'types' of burgers. It seems that they have a mass amount of patties in the back, all the same, but they throw different things on top and call them gourmet burgers. For 10$ or more each. Yeah, you get 'bottomless fries' (which are, hilariously, in an actual bottomless cylinder) but that is only if your waiter/waitress is around to notice you want/need more. They give you a hand full of tasteless steak fries. How can one make fries so bland? There is a reason they give every table a giant shaker of seasoning. 
I got a Gardenburger. Which is, a Gardenburger you can buy at the store. They also serve the vegan Boca patty...also bought at the store. You can sub any veggie patty for any type of burger, but really, it doesn't make a difference.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,3,0,2,m4S_YhJBHb1jRyjILNx9Bg
5513417,2013-08-05,3,jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og,"Maybe I'm saying this is a 5 star experience because I was a little ""toasted"" when we showed up here.  We were next door at Michoacan for their Sunday brunch.  So, we decided to sit in the bar and hangout a little longer.

There was ample seating in the bar and they had a booth that fit the 6 of us perfectly.  I wanted to get rid of my buzz and there is nothing better than a milkshake and fries to do that.  I ordered the cookie shake and it was great.  $5 for the shake and extra in the tin.  Our waitress was great too.  She checked up on us to make sure everything was okay.

The only problem I had with the place was the urinal.  It was about a foot off of the ground.  I think it's a test to see if you're sober or not.  If you piss on your shoes then you have to wait a little while longer before you can drive.  I was good to go!",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,5,4,5,ltXZqSrnW-eEYGEKPLJa2g

It had to of been a half hour and only 3 people from my party got their food. No one else got their food we waited and waited. I'd say about 50 mins later our food still didn't come out. We finally called a manager to see what was taking so long. Our waitress apologized tons saying  she had no clue why the kitchen was taking long. Finally the manager told us our food was pushed to the side, forgotten and got cold. She had the kitchen make fresh meals for us and our dinners were on the house. While we waited they kept refilling our fries. The manager apologized again and again. We felt bad for our waitress because it was not her fault and she did take care of us and noticed something was wrong as well as the manager. They handled the situation well. Though I would rather have food out on time and pay then wait and starve to get a meal on the house. I wish I could remember our waitresses name.

I was seated rather quickly as I was alone at the bar and the service wasn't fantastic but it was decent.  This review is more about the food since that was amazing.   The burger was perfect.  I ordered a blue cheese burger with crispy onions on a onion bun.  It wasn't the premium but there was no lacking in flavor because of it.  Because I'm very finicky about my sauces I ordered the BBQ on the side and it was actually delicious on the burger!  The fries I ordered the first time were well done and really crunchy without being burnt.  However to be less difficult I ordered my refills regular.  Apparently the birthday burger comes with fries! As I was not aware so that was a pleasant surprise.  Now since I received the burger and fry my bill came to a whopping 0.00 which was disheartening because I wanted to tip and I didn't have cash :(.  The waitress had to ring up a slice of cheese $1.49 to make it happen so if you go remember cash and enjoy! Red Robin is awesome.,crOnL6IXzIRxzOO5j8kRSQ,0,0,4,sA24qvcFx_ssyyOtM80dZg

Food took over an hour to get even a side. Then when the food came only 2/3 of the order came with like 3 fries on each plate and to top it off that was the extra .99 cents garlic fries, and my burger and fries where so burnt I only took two bits and boxed it and tossed it in the trash at home. They even took food off our check but ended up leaving a two part check combined into one check with the other party's food all for free while I was left with burnt garbage that I paid full for minus my birthday burger. What a great gift from red robins. This is the second time here and they where both terrible.

My girlfriend got the Sriracha burger for 6 bucks and it was twice as big as mine. A Jack in the Box gourmet burger is better is better then this place.

Brian P. likes to come here thanks to their rewards program so I've tried everything from their salads to their burgers. While everything tastes fine, there's nothing to write home about.

My biggest gripe is how cramped everything is. I can't cross my legs at the table without blocking the flow of traffic. Staff were bumping into me while I was seated. The tables are just way too close together. Luckily nothing spilled on me. 

While I'll probably get flak for this, as a non tattooed person, I'm going to mention it. The staff looks wrecked here, which doesn't instill confidence in me. If you wanna tat your face, cool, but cover that up for food service. Neck tats, breast tats, back tats and sleeves that are hanging out. Why are staff wearing clothing that shows of back tats and breast tats in a restaurant? This isn't Coyote Ugly. The tats and lack of grooming  standards looks unkempt. 

Service is okay. Refills of water and bottomless items are hard to come by so meh, this place is just ok.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,1,2,9jxw9pJzIoZxL3Nq_OOgEA

Even though we order our dessert on the tablets that are on each table, we still have to place the dessert order as soon as we receive our burgers, or else we will be waiting for at least 10 minutes after we are finished. -1 point for that and the 20 min wait to be seated.

It took over 40 minutes to get our food and when they did bring it, it was only for one person in our party. The food was tasteless!!!  And the burger was over cooked. I asked for medium and got well done. The patty was unseasoned.  A little salt goes a long way.  My sisters grand daughter got the Mac n cheese and it had no flavor at all.

Our waitress that we started with told us that she was being sent home. But she stayed and served the table next to us for the remainder of the night. Our waitress was good, and the food was good, which is the only reason they got 2 stars. The bathrooms were also filthy and the trash probably had not been emptied in hours.
