The tempura shrimp appetizer was appropriately prepared and came with a delicate but flavorful plum sauce. The entrees were the standouts, though. My wife's Panang beef and my Chili paste chicken were both outstanding. Service was friendly and prompt.

I ordered the Tom yum shrimp soup (which is the only thing I always order in other Thai restaurants) so I know exactly how it should taste and look. When I opened the container you could clearly see how old the mushrooms and the shrimp were, even after seeing that, I gave it a try, but you could still taste  the mushrooms were super bad and old.. Just plain disgusting. I would never bash a business for a minor thing. But this time I felt disrespected and yes, that's how bad was it!

I went in on a Tuesday for their sweet and sour chicken special and boy was I disappointed.  Although the only  waitress did a decent job of serving a small rush of 6 tables, the food was sub par.  The food was cold and tasted rather old. The chicken seemed as if it had been cooked and held in the warmer and the vegetables were not crisp somewhat wilted. The only thing that seemed hot was the sweet and sour sauce. I'm not sure if it was because the server took to long to bring out our food or if it was just my luck but I was let down. I may have to try this place for their dinner hours, hopefully it redeems itself.",-gesMiUw6i2ZTNQQ2TPJqg,0,0,1,ZTBhVrYNQNTUGtwxfB3PwA

I have lived so close to MK pretty much all of my life and never knew about them until my girlfriend and I just found them on yelp.  Mikki is just so friendly and genuine and her level of service was amazing.  This place is just such a hidden gem.

We had the green curry with chicken which had bamboo shoots, eggplant, and I believe spinach.  It was rich and creamy and had a slight mint after taste which was refreshing (I'm not a big fan of mint in food so this is saying a lot lol).

We also had the kai prik pao which was their fried chicken in a sweet chili sauce.  We just had it mild but I'm assuming that you can get it Thai spicy if you want.  This dish was off the charts! I highly recommend getting it. The two dishes paired nicely with the crunch and spice from the chicken and the smooth, creamy-ness of the curry all over steamed rice.

It's a definite must try!",vXP12a772Htr-PnFebiMUg,6,2,5,Yze3M7b3Xit4trV6SnQv5A

The food. Just. No words. So I love Chicken Panang Curry. This is the only restaurant to ever get it right. The chicken was all breast (meaning no fatty pieces at all), they actually included the lime keffir leaves and the bell peppers are always fresh. Everywhere else I go, there is always stuff missing or too much weird stuff added that changes the flavor. It's a damn shame. They sure had a cult following.

2594078,2015-05-28,2,YOZgLDLNLAe2nP1sw5inYw,"When it comes to 5 star rated Thai restaurants on Yelp, I pull no punches and go straight for traditional Thai dishes that never seem to satisfy my at most places.  One of those is pork Raad Nah (Lad Na), and that is what I ordered at MK today.  Well, that and crab rangoon of course, my white guy guilty pleasure.  

The crab rangoon was pretty good, nothing special, but yummy nonetheless.  The wonton was on the light and fluffy side, but otherwise uninspiring.  The cream cheese and imitation crab filling was well done, although a little fishy tasting from the imitation crab.  The sweet and sour sauce was a typical recipe, light in color and sweetness, and a little more tart than others.  All around though a yummy enough appetizer. 

The Raad Nah both impressed and disappointed.  Disappointed that they don't serve Chinese broccoli, but impressed by how good it was.   I think that maintaining fresh Chinese broccoli can be a big PITA for restaurants, especially one that might not cater to an Asian community (East Charleston).  So, I get that.  The Raad Nah came with American broccoli and sliced carrots, both of which were fresh and not overwhelming in flavor.  I think they were stewed for a bit to achieve that, but they weren't soggy in any way.  The gravy sauce was excellently prepared, although maybe slightly too thick for some traditionalists.  I enjoyed the balance of flavor and the thickness of it though.  The noodles were perfect, big thick flat noodles all stuck together in a dense mess.  That's how Raad Nah should be!  Big slices of pork that were tender and juicy topped the dish off.   If only this was served with Chinese broccoli!  

I plan on going back to this spot to try their curries and stir fries.  Fantastic service, great food so far, that's a winning combo for a Thai restaurant in this neighborhood.  Give it a try!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,4,2,4,bcytjTp6Zz9MQR0E08V4rw
