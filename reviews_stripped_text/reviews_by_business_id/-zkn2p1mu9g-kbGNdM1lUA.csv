The seaweed wrap was so tough that I couldn't take a proper bite. I was also surprised that it was hot, which was super weird. I would up dumping all the filling into my container  and trying to eat it  like a rice bowl. The tofu was good, but broccoli was cooked within an inch of its life, the greens were limp and the wonton ""crunchies"" were soggy. WTF is this even?",dPDJEpociZjk7ANdn_qNqQ,0,0,2,MYpyWhzvH97tRdR834IGMg

3281958,2017-10-07,1,-zkn2p1mu9g-kbGNdM1lUA,"This place has probably 30-40 different menu items, and I tried the chinos locos beef burrito. The meat is billed as chinese/mexican fusion, but honestly it just tastes like a more flavorful shredded beef. The side of fried rice was forgettable, but the burrito was above average. It had plenty of meat and good flavors. Plus, they cut the burrito in half which is nice. 

Others at our table tried the angry mexican tuna bowl and were equally satisfied.",WBlYjZLVlduMWq7_C1-P7Q,2,2,3,Hs0xb1I2bij2HfdR0vXbQQ
3416160,2018-01-03,0,-zkn2p1mu9g-kbGNdM1lUA,"So far, I like this place for the variety of food on their menu.  It has almost everything I like from RAMEN, to SUSHI! All in one spot and so very close to me.  So far I've had their Won Ton Soup which for a cheap price, I can add a side of Ramen to go with it.  The broth was a little salty for me but still good. I've also had their Pork Belly and Beef Ramen which were also good.  Hits the spot during cold days.

Another thing I do like, is their portion size for the price.  I like the containers that some of the to-go food come in.  Very durable.

I'm not a fan of their ""orange chicken.""  It doesn't come close to the traditional kind of orange chicken.  The chicken was breaded with very limited coating of that orange chicken flavor.

The crab ragoon to me tasted like it was all cream cheese, and absolutely no crab.  

As far as their sushi go, I wasn't to impressed with it.  Definitely not up to the standards you get from a sushi bar.

Taco salad was edible.  I do like how sturdy the shell was.  

So with that being said, Happy Eating's!",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,1,1,4,OpvowFN8b3QcQmkivLxj1Q

Maybe we gotta try something else next time",CPK8Qf91TGM03iNlE_aAFA,0,1,3,2PoQ3md5-7GpaQ0b-Ux2Yg
3583642,2018-03-12,0,-zkn2p1mu9g-kbGNdM1lUA,"Great French fries! Great iced tea! Terrible burger. When it was handed to me it looked like it was going to be so amazing (presentation was really good), but it was soooooooo greasy (I even took it apart to dab some grease up with a napkin) that I started feeling queasy and I swear I could feel my arteries clogging up, and couldn't finish it. There is juicy and then there is greasy. This was greasy and it tasted like the grill top, it's really unfortunate because if it had been wayyyyy less greasy it would have probably been really good. Sorry probably won't go back and if I do I won't be getting a burger. Service was very friendly however.",vg5nkkwchEPASXDSQsNHwg,0,0,2,avHqSOBJxkl447ABWZkptQ
3667610,2017-11-21,0,-zkn2p1mu9g-kbGNdM1lUA,"This place isn't horrible, but it's not great either. I've given this place a couple of tries.

Spicy beef ramen was very bland. No flavor and not even spicy. I actually ended up tossing it in the trash.

Carne Asada fries were pretty good and because i liked the asada.. i tried the carne asada nachos. I barely touched it.. stick to the fries.

I tried the carne asada burrito and eggroll today and i wasn't impressed. The rice in the burrito really kills it but i guess you can order without it. The eggroll was so so.. nothing amazing. The side of veggies were very oily. 

My friend had the steak quesadilla and jalape√±o poppers and she liked it but you can't really mess up a quesadilla. Overall.. i think I'm done going here. There's a lot of other places that i know are better.",LCVGvYcIJNTyCrSTPnDbMg,1,0,3,1N-W6EJbUjNAIyvSoCW8Dw
4252044,2018-01-22,1,-zkn2p1mu9g-kbGNdM1lUA,"If you're ever in downtown Las Vegas during the day, you must stop in and grab a bite at this place. They have a huge menu with lots of variety, including lots of dishes that have a Mexican and Asian fusion. I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito which was simply delicious. If i could, I would've ordered ten more haha. They also have a great salsa bar that has about seven different salsas to spice up your dishes if you're looking for a little extra kick. The service was great. Our food was made fast and was piping hot so you know they started making it as soon as it was ordered. The staff is very friendly and there's lots of tables if you're looking to dine in instead of taking your food to go. Also, prices were reasonable and our food portions were massive. Definitely a great spot to come to whenever you can.",KJRQUJEkWVebUImqc4vW_Q,4,3,5,XD8_tZ6vlscGDirvdHSPGQ
4307889,2018-02-07,0,-zkn2p1mu9g-kbGNdM1lUA,4 stars because I haven't explored much of their extensive menu. I did try the Asian chicken salad and it was great. Dark leafy veggies and fresh toppings. You get your money's worth. I advise calling  ahead to avoid the lunch rush hour.,Js05qch9z95YXBlnNwWGgw,1,1,4,JKRH4R7raypcddmGPD80MA

5200973,2018-01-29,0,-zkn2p1mu9g-kbGNdM1lUA,"1st time here...for jury duty.  Large menu, maybe lots of good choices.  However, I ordered a vegetable ""sushi burrito"", not impressed.  Should have realized it would be seaweed wrap, not tortilla...taste was fine but seaweed could not support content, stuck to paper and was nearly impossible to eat without disastrous mess.  Sticky white rice was huge amount, vegetables few and disappointing, tofu was two or three small pieces.  Taste was OK at best and they appear to have ONE hot sauce if you want.  Unsatisfactory lunch and too expensive.",c70CaRDtF6NlrucdxG6GjA,1,0,2,c1W0ArYEy-t9jW8gSHFNsg

I would have ordered online, but the last time I did that when I went in to go pick it up, they said they never received the order. Food is delicious, but I think I need to stop trying so hard to eat here.
