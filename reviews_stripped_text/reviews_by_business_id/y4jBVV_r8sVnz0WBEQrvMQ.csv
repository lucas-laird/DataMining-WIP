215297,2016-05-03,0,y4jBVV_r8sVnz0WBEQrvMQ,Today was our first time in and we loved everything about it. Our great experience started with our server savanna. She greeted us almost as soon as the hostess put down our menus. We told her it was our first time and she seemed excited to give us all of her recommendations. I'm fairly picky about cocktails but she was able to suggest some based off of what I asked. I got the Anti berry and it was so good! I love when the staff knows the menu well. We ordered the carne asada fries and a breakfast flatbread. Food came out quickly enough and it was all delicious. The music they played was even good! Our server kept our table cleaned off the whole time and was very thorough even though it seemed a bit crowded. At the end of our meal we paid and got our receipt that includes a coupon for 20% off our next meal. We will be back!,2Pl7xznxcSiUSr-Hk1hrkA,1,0,5,gSga8NgUtU7KdX3x-u5rkA

The place was practically deserted, but in fairness the foot traffic out front on the Strip was very light.  So of course we were eagerly greeted and seated.  Our bar service was quick but then we only ordered beers.  We watched the wait staff as they worked the few tables and noticed the staff all just going thru the motions, quite robotic. No interest in the job or the customers was shown, pretty much blank faces.  One waitress had a trailer...apparently a trainee.   The only signs of life in staff was when they conversed with each other. 
    But for the lack of interest in customers displayed, the food this night was pretty good.  The calamari arrived fairly quickly, crisp and tasty.  The Fish & Chips were prepared well and quite good. The Cincinnati Chili 3-way was tasty tho a bit mild. For heartburn sufferers like me it was just right but for spicier-loving tastes it might not appeal.  Those would be better served with the same at Steak n Shake which has more bite. 
   Overall we enjoyed the visit and plan to return, but hope to see a more engaging staff on hand next time.",awc9UwCGo3LMwcPaS121-A,1,0,3,mLpsln1c5zZkObFnBq_x1g

Here is the bad: When you check in they give you a free appetizer for writing a review. Cool. You have to show them the review before they remove the appetizer from your bill. I guess that's one way to keep your reviews high, unless of course you go back and share your real experience later. The service here was really slow. The kicker was there was no one inside.

2084438,2015-10-15,2,y4jBVV_r8sVnz0WBEQrvMQ,"Pete Rose has opened up a new bar and grill in the Hawaiian Marketplace on the Las Vegas Strip. The Grand Opening was last night, and I was so lucky to have been able to attend. Pete himself was there greeting customers and taking pictures. I had the opportunity to meet this man and shake his hand, and I have to say he is extremely kind and humble. 

The atmosphere is definitely a sports bar. Over 32 HD TV's surround the bar as well as each booth. You definitely won't miss a minute of the game should you choose to watch them here. Tons of Pete's memorabilia, including signed balls, bats, jerseys and tons of pictures surround the dining room. This place is huge, with over 250 seats inside, as well as a patio outside for additional seating.

The staff were helpful and friendly, coming around often to check on us and make sure drinks were filled and plates were cleared. The manager even stopped by to check and see how we liked everything, and told us that everything is made in house, and you can tell they really take pride in their food. 

All the food I tried was tasty. I wasn't super hungry, and luckily there were were plenty of appetizers to choose from, including nachos, wings, flatbread pizzas and house made soups. Entrees include burgers, salads, sandwiches, ribs, and of course Cincinnati chili. Since I was eating with a few people, I got to try many different items and they were all great. I really enjoyed the lollipop wings, with housemade ranch. They come in buffalo, thai chili, salt and pepper and bbq flavors. I also enjoyed the ribs. They were meaty and fall of the bone tender.

For dessert I had white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, made with fresh whipped cream and raspberry puree. So yummy. The pricing wasn't too bad either, for a spot on the strip.

She made a beer suggestion based on what I liked and drink suggestion for my wife! She was on the spot my wife's margarita was perfect and my beer was perfect.

Now the best part was the Executive Chef came out and asked how was everything and I asked what I should try on his suggestion and his response was ""Perfect, I'll send something out!"" He sent out Cincinnati Chili Cheese fries and Fish tacos. 

If you are a chili fan expect a different flavor This chili is on the sweeter side of chili but it was a great change of pace. The fish tacos were perfect, not dry and dressed well I didn't have to put anything on it.

3719429,2015-10-29,3,y4jBVV_r8sVnz0WBEQrvMQ,"Food is below mediocre. Very disappointed. I saw a lot of good reviews I had high hopes. 
So here it goes
A. French  onion  soup had very little guryere  cheese  on it and overly  salty. 
B. Calamari was soggy and small portion for price they charge.
C.  Nachos were dry and the pork meat was dry and chewy.  I hardly saw any cheese on it. Came with small scoop of  generic guacamole(defiantly not fresh) on top of nachos.
D. Bottle of beer was almost $9.
E. Poutine was bad. It was rather cold when it got to table.
F.  Burger was OK. French fries came with burger was good(Big one piece curly fries, very different )
G.  Shrimp skewers were overly salty. But the grits and the Mexican shaved corns came with entrees were good.
H.  Clam chowder soup was good. Very thick and hearty.
G.  No wine menu.  Just white or red  house wine.
Over all experience  was I probably won't  come back. All the food came to table warm not hot. 
Outdoor seating is awesome with looking at Las Vegas Blvd. But the music they play is rap and it's not PG rated.",AsYBFmnMZMm9FOJi6o0seA,2,1,2,XMeb9TRdCdqFBPXKAOTHlw

Great location on the strip and perfect for people watching.  We were seated on the patio and glanced over the menu. I knew exactly what I wanted, just  basic breakfast with eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast. So simple, yet so hard to find in Vegas. Brian went with the lox and bagel. The service was not the best, but wasn't horrible. Overall, it was priced well, especially for the strip, and the food was really good.",8a0GHVSVs3rSRtNIIR4rlw,1,0,4,ScrCweGWnAUGKCRasVPzxw

Hey I hate to be this person but yalls ginger ale is outta syrup so I need a new drink. With mad attitude she says I'll have someone check on that. Shit you not stood up there 10! Mins with the same fucked up drink. So then a regular walks up and ask for what I'm drinking the bartender was so nice to him and got to making his drink right away! As if I didn't order that and get a fucked up drink, so now she sees me and I have to remind her again, now she seems mad at me and gives me maybe a tablespoon of Jamison in my damn ginger ale! Did I mention the drink was 10 dollars, so I paid 10 dollars for ginger ale and a drop of Jamison, will never be back and will tell people to save their money",jQt240D2smW4yH7eG1tJYg,0,1,1,XsCCkKWUjaBTAdteQdmpTg

The other person with me had a burger and it was over cooked as well! Sent it all back and left.

Steven the Buser was very friendly and smiling and very attentive came right away to the table and took my drink order. My server Charmaine greeted me with a warm smile and  suggested a few appetizers that were her favorite I choose the Spinach Artichoke Dip it was very good. For dinner I had the half rack of ribs it was so good. The service was outstanding and everything was fantastic, I never had to ask for drink refills Steven was definitely on top of everything and Charmaine checked on me a few times to make sure everything was good. She asked if I would like dessert but I was so full that I said I will be back and the overall service from everyone was outstanding. I will definitely be coming back.

We ordered the giant pretzel for an appetizer.  They do not lie, that thing is HUGE!  We would both recommend trying it.  The next time we stopped in, we went for breakfast.  We are originally from the Midwest, so biscuits and gravy is a staple for us.  Their biscuits and gravy is absolutely delicious.  Again, we had great service.  Everyone there is so friendly!  The third time we went was to watch an NHL game.  We asked if we could sit inside and near a TV with the game on.  The hostess was so nice and gave us a choice of two tables.  Again, the food was great and the service was terrific!  Our waiter was joking around with us, the manager stopped and sat with us for a little while to talk.  Even if you are not a Pete Rose fan, you need to come in and check this place out!  The ceiling is decorated like a baseball, which is just neat in itself.

I recommend the carne asada fries. It was made to perfection for us. & the serving was pretty big for sharing with 2. They even have a all day happy hour list .",IfQLSB1tBlxsyaf3BBMY5Q,0,0,5,or_y8Gb3dcC9i_O6XR8-4g

He was so livid with an attitude when he approached our tables I was in complete shock! We spent 2 hours here and only had 1 drink not because we didn't want more but because we couldn't get a server for the life of us. The manager needs a different profession.

The service was just awful. We waited so long for my little cousin's shrimp, his mom never got her fries or her soup, our drinks went dry frequently, the bill was a mess and included the tip for a party that was essentially 5 adults and 2 children. We weren't a difficult party. We didn't make any strange requests. I don't know why this was so difficult. 

The ceiling was painted like a baseball. That was cute. Naturally, there are tons of TV's so it's a great place to watch a sporting event. The chairs were comfy, but didn't move well on the floor. 

The food was only mediocre, so that coupled with the very poor service means I won't be back. Bummer. Pete Rose, your namesake deserves better than this poorly run establishment.",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,4,0,2,QQkL_O-xLlIUPCh5p8dE0g

I asked what baseball games are showing since the World Series has just ended and there are no games, she responded back with all of them.
Highly disappointed to call a bar that is considered a sports bar and even has the word sports in the title and have the person who answers the phone not know what games are on, what season games are being played in, or no names of teams if you ask if they're going to be on TV.   
Based on this phone conversation with the person at the front, I'm definitely skipping this place. I can understand the other reviews about poor service and overpriced drinks.
