The stuff was hot and fresh, and the people were nice. I liked the chicken a lot. Wedges were kinda thick and biscuit wasn't my favorite style. 

Online ordering was easy. 

I might skip the sides, but I'd pick up chicken again for sure.",gDmAxtID6dyGkzmrVTNDDQ,1,0,4,xIW-b2AFykfLo3e6SFyL0Q

I was a little hesitant about ""gas station"" fried chicken at first but once I saw nothing but 5-star reviews (albeit only a handful), I had to try it. 

The chicken is hot and crispy - extremely flavorful, especially when compared to the industrial, greasy chicken that is sold at the chain fast food chicken joints. 

If you're in Vegas and have a fried chicken habit, this is an absolute must visit.",wtUwOPxCsF0vflZSmd1Okw,1,0,5,Nt-32PpAzNa8dAv76IXm8w
2712902,2018-04-19,0,D43BEY4TgoMW4yi9Nz0ysA,This place was a very unexpected surprise.  The price is great very affordable that's for sure.  The customer service is wonderful all of them were very nice and friendly.  The guy behind the counter seemed to know everyone and by name.  It gave you a great little neighborhood vibe.  The chicken was nice and crispy and cooked all the way through had great flavor not dry at all.  The only thing is that your can taste and smell the oil needed to be changed.  Other then that I would recommend trying this place and I will be back also.,wntAO2E7_7S9vPibfcwx5w,0,0,5,9ZFOKQnRBEwLMDQLQ6ijvg

Saw this place was nearby where we lived, and we were in a KFC-type mood but didn't really want to go there.  KKC turned out to be a way better decision!  The fried chicken is excellent and extra crispy as expected (my favorite) with a little bit of spiciness in the aftertaste.  

The potato wedges were great too and my wife loved the jambalaya side.  I have to try the mac and cheese sometime too!  Plus the honey biscuits are really tasty afterwards.

Don't be thrown off that this is in a gas station.  Seriously, check it out, it's an excellent alternative if you aren't feeling KFC/Popeye's.",h0doro2zV5ffcIAqhRNVNg,3,0,5,SsVI8eWFJQNyUytGmcv96Q

4702583,2018-03-21,1,D43BEY4TgoMW4yi9Nz0ysA,"I don't always eat fried chicken/foods, but when I do, I eat Krispy Krunchy Chicken. You would not expect some bomb fried chicken from a gas station but damn this place kills it for sure, I have tried every piece of chicken they sell here and they blow any fast food chicken joint away. It's Cajun style seasoning so if you into some good Cajun batter on your chicken this place is for you. 

You can tell a good fried chicken place from how juicy their breast pieces are and I must say this place is consistent on the way it's made because the 4 times we came here the same guy was cheffin' it up. Ohh did I mention how extremely bomb their biscuits are? Ohhhh myyyyy gooooodness this biscuit is so bomb. The honey butter glaze is so good and seems to deep into the biscuit just enough, prior to this I used to like churches biscuits but this place beats it by a whole lot, you wouldn't want to eat any other biscuit again from a fast food joint. 

The Filipino aunty who seems like she runs the gas station counter and the chicken joint, reminds me of the aunties back home in Hawaii so it's pretty down home I must say. Just get down here and sample these chicken pieces, you will not regret it.",Fuekh1vNrATMHlE5k2NFMg,4,2,5,MERYAxB8PT3aiJLCPutXVQ
4826745,2018-06-18,0,D43BEY4TgoMW4yi9Nz0ysA,I love their Cajun tenders and fries.i just wish they would give more sauce.they only gave me 4 sauces for 25pcs tenders.,u6Xgu_607d8tdwiX7Plurg,0,0,5,f2b27yL2LwJUknAkbKu8jw
5902237,2018-02-16,0,D43BEY4TgoMW4yi9Nz0ysA,"I was introduced to Krispy Krunchy Chicken many years ago when I was living in Phoenix. It is best known for being crispy and crunchy, as the name implies. It is made from fresh and not frozen chicken. Better tasting than KFC, Popeyes, and Churches. When I moved to LV almost 6 months, I was disappointed there wasn't one here... Until now.

The honey butter biscuits are to die for. They are flakey, buttery, and sweet. The chicken is well seasoned and juicy.",MhMijIAVx1Is_WYIMTHn6w,8,4,5,TDdse1_rdrc9WSUcEsXJJQ
