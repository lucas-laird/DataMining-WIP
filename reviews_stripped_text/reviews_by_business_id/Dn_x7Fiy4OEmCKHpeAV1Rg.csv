And, all the wait staff are so friendly and it feels like genuinely care about their clientele.  Great people, great food, clean friendly atmosphere.  You gotta try it if you haven't already.",Lz_-lxBvIuYJJpEtkjoGlQ,0,0,5,F2VdMLUXGvskhprQHLNSbQ

They have multiple fantastic bartenders and the food is better than you would expect. I personally like the chicken tenders as they always come out super fresh and cooked well.

Prices are good. Try it out",c_ZJTqZFVMMjhfw437fI8A,0,0,5,Uxn64NdXt2a3NsX-wJXqCQ

I've spent hundreds of dollars on their slots before , been going there for 3 years now, you guys say its dirt cheap but i guess my money was not good enough for the bartender, i wish i knew her name but i know its not Ciara she's awesome, i  dont have a problem with stone house i just have a problem with that new bartender .

2907837,2011-05-09,0,Dn_x7Fiy4OEmCKHpeAV1Rg,"Great bar close to the Nellis Air Force Base. It's on East Craig Road just after the I-15 if you're heading south on Craig.

The food here is cheap and really good. My favorite is the fresh made potato chips and spinach dip! 

They have graveyard specials under $5 as well and that are delicious!

On Saturdays, I like to come here for Karaoke. It's not fancy, its down home kinda bar. There's a couple pool tables and a couple video games, and slots around the bar. The drinks here are DIRT CHEAP!!

Summary:
FOOD, DRINKS and if you love to sing, definitely a place to go and sing as many times as you like since it's not a crowded bar. This is the kind of bar, where a group of your friends can come and pretty much feel like you own the bar!",pkq41Qh9yGOI_4pwdVmmDg,1,3,5,Sbe3-BqLirOFiZbMy6tE5g

4554226,2018-06-08,0,Dn_x7Fiy4OEmCKHpeAV1Rg,"Hm, what's there to say? It's a seedy dive bar with cheap drinks, a smokey smell and decent food. My company sponsored a happy hour here recently after work and this was one of the closest options near by. There's really not many bars around the Craig & 15 area so compared to another local joint with worse service this was the better option. 

The drinks were super cheap, we spent around $300 total for 20 people in a 2 hour time spend which I'd say is not bad. I did like that they had three olives vodka available in multiple different flavors & their bloody mary was decent. For food we ordered a round of things including nachos, mozzarella sticks, wings, and french fries. It was pretty standard bar food, but it tasted alright. 

I can't say I'd come back again unless it was a company type event. It's not really my scene and I'm not too fond of the smokey smell lingering on my clothes afterwards.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,6,1,3,3nkvss4_Gp3x17S45h_zKg

4950587,2017-07-22,0,Dn_x7Fiy4OEmCKHpeAV1Rg,People who go here don't use Yelp. It's the epitome of a trashy dive bar. Be careful that your car doesn't get broken into in their parking lot. Food sucks. They serve expired food. Bartenders are dull and morons. How is this place open?,KDzi9XBzZGYq8_mmgcwrBA,0,0,1,8Q5Gz0-XnaUvYSdsv0mSmw
5118843,2014-01-26,2,Dn_x7Fiy4OEmCKHpeAV1Rg,"Ok, my review may not be the fairest, because this is where I wound up rather than my first through fourth choices - all of which had insane wait times. Still, my buddy pointed out the fact that there was a bar around the corner that had a decent steak special. Why not, I figured. 

While the steak was decently seasoned and cooked and the fries were pretty good for French fries, the vegetables seemed to be the same California mix that I get from the freezer section. Down to the cut of each floret of cauliflower. Still, I've seen worse slapped down onto a plate in my days, so it could have been much, much worse.

The major detractor for me was the nachos. Wherever I go, when I order nachos, I expect generous portions on the toppings, fully (or at least mostly) melted cheese and plenty of pico, guac, and sour cream on top. Aside from a few black olives, jalape√±os, and half melted cheese, the toppings were non existent. The pico (one little plastic cup, probably less than an actual scoop) and the sour cream were in cups to the side, and there was no guacamole to be found - they don't have it. Add this disaster to a plate of overly salty chips and you have a very disappointed guests. 

Oh well, the waitress/bartender was really friendly and on her game, gaining this spot an extra star in lieu of a good meal.",YNtH9vbkgMxFcDaeMh8rew,1,1,2,Nr8KsIxuNIcetfuoYsObRA
