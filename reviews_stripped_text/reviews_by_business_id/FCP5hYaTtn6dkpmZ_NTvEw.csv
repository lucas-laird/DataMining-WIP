It has good variety of sushi, salad, even Korean kimchi items.  Hot food is ok. and desert is not bad neither.  Also, has a few fruit items.

Overall, it is much better than any of the casino buffets, specially after last night's experience at Wicked Spoon.

We were totally satisfied with them. but they close at 8:00 pm for dinner. hence you should come before 7:00 pm otherwise, you would not get what you want. I highly recommend it to sushi buffet lovers who have ever tried Todai or Minado. unlike other sushi buffet, the owner and the chef is real Japanese.",-qdXeUFtdz8o7f7M3sQPhQ,0,0,5,jllRttJhazTFN2DdPLrQEQ

They have decent sushi. However a lot if had mayo and was made with cooked fish (I'm not a big sushi eater so I can't really judge their selection). 
Salads were good (but ... if you want salad - go to salad bar for $6-$7).
Deserts are pretty good but when I saw a big cockroach right on a food counter and told about it to a pastry girl she kinda looked at me ""whatever..."" - good thing that I've noticed it by the time we were getting dessert and I don't bitch too much when I go eat with my g/f :)

Makino's is a fun place to go and they always have a good selection of food and it is well stocked.  The food just doesnt sit around for a long time so it is fresh.  I LIKE the sushi there.  They use good ingredients and they also vary the combos.  If you do not see what you are craving you can ask the sushi chef to make you a Hand Roll.  

The Tempura is a highlight for me.  I would get the udon but that is a little too much food for me.  :)   Maybe it is the economy but I have noticed some things disapearing like the creme brulee.  But all in all, we have never left the place hungry.

457569,2008-08-02,0,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"Overall, it is better then Todai, but the business hours have changed in a weird way.  It was either changed to meet the lack of business or to just control labor, but regardless it seems funky.

Service was good the wait staff picks up the plates at a decent rate.

Red bean ice cream is great, the young lady or young man serving it was grumpy as hell, that is one way to control your food cost. Make the customer feel like crap for having you scoop ice cream. Here is a better Idea, get rid of the Human Ice Cream scooper, and save the labor cost.  The customer will be happy to scoop their own ice cream, and not have to deal with the grumpy face. This can be a plus for business.

Sushi was of decent quality and there is a fair amount of choices.

Oysters was also a fave.

Not a fan of the cooked Japanese food, so it was mediocre at best.

Hand-rolls was also good. These guys smile at least.

Desserts deserved to be deserted.

The sushi is very acceptable, when you add in the salads (varied and creative), the soup selection (fresh greens, tofu w/ broth added when you get it) and the hot seafood/veggy dishes, the place is a delight.  I think if you concentrate on a single item and rate Makino's per that item, you miss the old 'sum of its parts . . . ' maxim.  It really applies here.  The atmosphere is busy (it is a cafeteria to use the old parlance) , but very clean, and very glass and chrome sharp.  A nice selection of desserts also.

I can understand why you'd be tempted. Like my man and I, you are probably looking for a Vegas-style buffet experience without the prices of the Strip. The reviews on here don't look too bad, and it seems worth a gamble.

But don't do it. Not only is the fish not fresh, nor prepared with care, even the cooked meals seem off. I was avoiding rice at the time, so didn't eat much sushi, focusing on cooked dishes instead.The green mussels and scallops dish  tasted good at first, so I had some more. Once it started to taste not-too-good anymore, it was too late. I was tasting it for it the next 18 hours, the same length of time that my stomach was queasy and unsettled. Literally left me with a bad taste in the mouth. 

The only reason I can see to go here is to eat the most seafood, raw and otherwise, that you possibly can for the most inexpensive price possible. Which, when you think about it, is probably just a bad idea in and of itself.",A261Aw231jooJ4npKcUajA,2,0,1,NXHMn9xnQ-kMF-0y7Nxn-Q

959217,2010-09-06,0,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"The Japanese buffet located inside the las vegas outlets is definitely a good bargain.  I came here for lunch upon arriving in Vegas, and was starving with a big appetite.  I immediately went straight to the sushi bar.  They have a large selection of rolls; most are filled with crab meat, eel, avocado, or spicy tuna.  The rolls were pretty good, but I felt like out of the 20 different varieties of rolls, they only used like 5 different ingredients plus a mixture of various sauces.  What I didn't like was the imitation crab meat they used in the rolls, it just tasted so fake and Americanized, I wish they would use real crab meat.  The sushi selection of raw fish was limited, the scallop sushi was fresh and tasted excellent, the salmon was also pretty good, and the eel sushi wasn't bad.  However, the rest of the sushi wasn't spectacular; they only had like 10 different varieties of sushi, which was a tad disappointing.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the sushi rice they used for the rolls and sushi.  A lot, and I do mean a lot, of all-you-can-eat sushi places, lik Todai for example, serve crappy mushy rice...which makes the sushi just taste awful!  At Makino they use pretty good quality sushi rice, and I was quite surprised, it just makes the sushi taste so much better!

 The shrimp and vegetable tempura wasn't bad, and they also have Udon noodles which tasted pretty good.  They didn't have a whole lot of hot entrees, I tried the beef sukiyaki, which was okay, the friend chicken wasn't bad.  I was surprised that I didn't see beef teriyaki; they only had chicken teriyaki...Maybe they serve that for dinner.   I wasnt all that impressed with the hot entrees, there just wasn't a whole lot of variety, the food tasted ok and better than most ayce buffets.  The dessert bar was disappointing; most of the dessert just didn't appeal to me, and didn't taste good!  Even the ice cream was disappointing, how could they go wrong with green tea ice cream!?  Well I think they make their own ice cream, so the ice cream was just bland with no green tea flavor at all, very disappointing.  They had a decent amount of fresh fruit selections, which I liked and most where sweet!  They also have a chocolate fountain where you can dip your strawberries or other fruits in...great idea, bad execution!  The chocolate was a tad watery and didn't ""solidify"" even after letting it settle for 5 minutes.  

 Overall this place is a bargain for a all-you-can-eat Japanese buffet, the lunch price is $17 for weekends, but be careful because drinks cost extra!  It's $2 for drinks...which I found odd, since most buffets offer free beverage.   So if you don't intend on drinking a beverage, opt for water and fill your stomach with extra food!  The sushi selection could have been better, but they use fresh ingredients and the rice was excellent! The hot entrees could have been better, the tempura was probably the best thing.  I would have liked more variety.  The dessert bar was disappointing, but they had a large variety of sweet fruits.

My hungry family and I were really looking forward to enjoying an Asian/sushi buffet (a nice break from the hotel buffets), but only to be let down.   We arrived at Makino at 8pm.   The hostess gladly led us to a table.    It was now 8:10, after getting my kids washed up before eating and getting them their food, when an announcement on the overhead speakers stated to get all the food you wanted to eat because they were putting the food away in 15 minutes.   It was a mad dash for the food.    They immediately started covering up the various dishes and putting them away.   We really didn't have ""time"" to get what we wanted.  When we complained to our waitress, she just shrugged her shoulders and the hostess avoided making eye contact with us.  Needless to say, it was a very bad experience.   The hostess should have mentioned this at the start, but I guess since business was slow, they were desperate for the money at the expense of customer satisfaction.

1294706,2012-01-04,1,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"What's there to say about this place ... 

A lot would be the appropriate answer. $15.95 Mon-Thur Lunch and $24.95 Dinner. And basically a dollar more for every thing else.I've been going to Makino for years. Let me re-literate that YEARS. I used to go to the one on Decatur and Flamingo and even then my young taste buds quickly acquired a liking to the magnificent sushi.

Their lunch is such a steal. $15.95 really? C'mon man. You know that's a steal. 

First thing is first I always start off wetting my appetite by constructing the perfect udon temura shrimp bowl. Does anyone have a napkin I feel myself drooling.  I get on those little pre-constructed bowls of udon seaweed and a few other odds and ends and add some green onion red chilli powder always a must then 3-4 strands of delicious tempura shrimp. Lastly I pour in the broth either Tempura or the other one and believe me it's a taste sensation that your taste buds will have and will probably never recover from. 

On the right side is their large marathon long of sushi. It starts with nigiri and I always always get the tuna topped with looks like onion fried garlic and a bit of a citrus flavor. The ika or for youse who don't speak Japanese Squid. Always a good indicator of a sushi place. It should be crisp white and not too chewy. A giveaway that it has been sitting out too long. 

I make my way to the sushi rolls of which there are many. And i always go for the tempura dragon rolls they make. I can't say enough about there tempura shrimps it is absolutely delicious. At the end is there large vats of ginger wasabi lemon and house made spicy soy sauce for you to dip there sushi in. 

Now, on the left side is the hot items. I usually for go the fried rice and chow mein they are not exactly winning anyone over in my opinion. But they do have good seabass in a garlic butter sauce that is specatular. Soft not too fishy and warm. I always go for clams if they have. And i believe they got rid of it but they did have these large jumbo shrimp that was baked with cheese and split in the middle. I miss those. What else makes a good sushi place better? Dessert DUH! 

They have a chocolate fountain with assorted fruits for you to enjoy and other nice little one person treats like cheesecakes, creme brulee and little custard filled croissant looking things. 

After walking around the shopping mall and getting tired c'mon in and continue shopping waddling around. 

The service is always excellent and they are very attentive. Waitresses do not need to be called over just to pour your drink.  And everything is neat clean and typical Japanese decor.",8rXvP1F3XWxcXZwk3MUgFA,0,0,5,aDdFy3_QxQEssKLLPqgJ3g

And so the quality of everything seemed to suffer too.  Poor sushi chefs.  They were probably undermanned and couldn't keep up.  

The prices were not really cheap either but oh well, I guess I might try it one more time on a normal day since many people have raved about this place in the past but on my visit, it was definitely way below average....

Seriously, I love sushi in more coastal and metro cities like SF, LA, Boston, so I'm a bit wary of sushi in a desert like Vegas.  But after my last 2 visits to Vegas where we intentionally avoided the hotel buffets,  Makino was on my list.
The sushi was ok, but avoid the maki hand roll.  Nasty!  I actually nearly choked on it. Turns out it was the stem of the avocadoactually  in the roll! 
Other than that, the tempura is excellent as well as other Japanese dishes.  The desserts are excellent too.  The chocolate fondue fountain and the unique signature parfait desserts are worth saving room for.  
Would I come here again?  Hmmmm, maybe.   I would rather check out the one in LA or go back to the one in Hawaii.  I think it's a challenge to do an AYCE sushi place in Vegas.

They also offer other hot foods, like udon, tempura, fried rice, chicken, etc.

It definitely taste a lot better than Joe's sushi. The albacore sushi was pretty good too and the other ones are just whatever. 

Personally I thought the hot food were pretty bad. There wasn't really one item that I love. They were either nasty or nothing special and I wouldn't try to get it again. I also tried the udon which wasn't that great to me. The udon was pretty nasty which disappointed me. 

The thing I did love about it is the fact that i can get unlimited amount of Shrimp Tempura. I am never satisfied from Japanese restaurant when they only give you 1-2 shrimp tempura but this place did allow me to get 10+ shrimp tempura. hahaha that was one good point to me.

I also like the fact that they provided 4? different kind of ice cream. I'm pretty sure they were all bought but if i can get unlimited amount of red bean ice cream thats gonna make fat and happy. 

Also didn't try the other desserts(cakes except the shaved ice) because it didnt look that great . Don't try the shaved snow...it was absolutely nasty. -_- I do enjoy the fruits since they give the chocolate fountain where I can tip my strawberries into it. I love strawberries without and with chocolate. :)

Anyway I would say this place is probably 2.75 but i must say for a buffet i thought the sushi was quite fresh. I really do enjoy the salmons that are actually fresh.

I've worked in the food industry and when you say that you close at 8:30, it doesn't mean that you stop accepting customers at 8:15 or even at 8:25.  You accommodate those customers as they still bring you income, turning back a party of 6 is a lost income.

It had different variety of rolls (california, dragon, rainbow, philadelphia rolls to Makino original rolls) and udon noodles and sukiyaki and salad, and great dessert selection.  Yes, that's what the AYCE is all about, and all for only $13 back then.

Well, now that they built this chain at the mall where my family loves to visit almost everytime we visit Vegas, I started going to this Makino and I have to say, good 4 stars for the outlet mall.  It's $16 or $17 for lunch ($25 or $26 for dinner which I'm not sure if it's worth it for difference of crab meat and shrimp) ...
While sushi can be improved more on better tuna and salmon, this place is so popular so it goes very quickly unlike some other sushi bars on big hotel buffet on the Strip.  They have beef sukiyaki, shrimp tempura (oh btw, I love to put at least 4 or 5 shrimp on the udon and pour hot noodle soup to make my own tempura udon- it's soo good, try it when you visit next!).  The server was very friendly and quick to bring water or drink (the same lady served us 3 years ago is still here so they must make the employees happy too), and it was very satisfying meal and nice break from shopping.  

Yes, it can be better as a restaurant like good old Makino but I don't know many other malls that has a decent sushi restaurant like this elsewhere (besides Japan) so I'm still a big fan.

They also had beef that was kinda hard.

I have to say this was definetly the best spread they've put out in all the times I have gone.  The sushi selection seemed larger with more kinds of rolls and it all seemed a lot fresher than previous visits while the hot food also seemed to be fresher and of a higher quiality with more time spent on presentation.  

Deserts continued to impress... I don't know if they are rotating the food out better or if it's just higher quality product but all of the cakes and puddings were moist and for the first time the cream puff's weren't rock hard and actually contained a ton of what tasted like fresh cream instead of just mostly air like on previous visits.  

*Only downside on this otherwise amazing visit wasn't really the restaurants fault but the rather large woman sitting at the table next to me saw some people she knew and proceeded to stand up and invite them over.  Now there isn't a lot of space between the tables already and between the people she invited over and her fatness they actuallly started to lean against my table and she even stepped back into my chair with enough force to lift two of the legs with me in it more than once and didn't even offer an apology.*

I would've liked to see more seafood dishes, as in king crab legs, oysters, and lobster. (Or maybe it wasn't being served when I went?) 

What sets this apart from other seafood/Asian buffets I've been to before is the chocolate fountain. If it wasn't so rude I'd take a spoon or a bowl and use that to cover and dip my strawberries instead.

Let's get one thing clear... people don't go to Japanese buffets for the sushi.  The sushi is fresh however has an assembly lined look and taste. The selection and prices is why you would venture into this restaurant. The price has gone up over the years but the wide selection of food including crab legs, seafood, teriyaki dishes and the sashimi are impressive.

In fact, I secretly took the noodles from one bowl and put them in another because one ""serving"" was essentially equal to only 2 bites.  The tempura shrimp tasted great (but how can you go wrong with tempura shrimp?) and I had some stir fried noodles.  For dessert, I got a scoop of green tea ice cream (they also offer other flavors, like chocolate, strawberry, etc.).  Overall, an ok experience but not really worth the $16/person in my opinion.

We dragged our feet inside and plopped down on our seats.  Get our drink orders in and venture to the food.  Not that much going on as far as quantity goes.  I grab some udon and do some surveillance on the sushi.  The set-up looked like a busted up lip.  What a mess!  Some people are just vultures, I tell ya.

Some say I'm way too picky with my sushi.  You want to know what I tell them?  Too bad.  I'm telling you anyway.  I tell them to eat fat bowl of sh%t, straight up.  Besides, my otosan (father) was a sushi chef way back when.  So there.  Suck a fat one, you haters =)

Anyways, the stuff looked like you would expect from an AYCE sushi dig.  Only it's better than any of the stuff that I've had from a buffet on the Las Vegas strip. Man, have you guys ever tried that sh%t?!  That stuff tastes like an uncooked potatoe. The udon was better than I expected.  I threw in some tempura in it, because that's how I do.

To top it all off, I had green tea ice cream.  Only, they gave it to me in a cone.  I've never had it any other way than in a bowl.  So that was kinda weird.  It wasn't maeda-en stuff, but it was aiiight.

This place is better than Todai, that's for sure.

We got there right when it opened & were seated right away.  The first thing I did was head to the sushi station.  Everything was really pretty & colorful.  They have the cute long rectangular plates (the ones that rolls come on).  I got a bunch of different things from albacore, shrimp, spicy tuna nigiri & spicy (lots of chili) beef roll.  

Then headed over to the other stations.  Everything was well categorized, fruits, desserts, sushi, hot food, salads..

Then we sat down to eat.  I was a bit disappointed :(  The fish was not fresh, kinda slimy..  Not good.  The food was either bland or not very good tasting.  

There were a few things I got that tasted okay:  beef sukiyaki was good with the enoki mushrooms, chicken gyozas, seaweed salad (the prepackaged one), shrimp tempura (one of the better items!  very crispy & freshly fried) but the tempura sauce and  fried noodles have no flavor.

Some of the desserts that were actually pretty tasty included the blueberry mousse, green tea cheesecake, cookies n cream moose (but it was still kinda frozen), white choc with raspberries (yum!).  The choc fountain was cool to look at, but didn't taste good.  :(  too oily...

The service was average.  The dirty plates weren't on our table too long and we got refills whenever we needed them.  If the food was better quality, I would give more stars, but it fell flat.  

There are many better buffets out there.  It's very similar to Todai (as it is the same owner).   Makino had good value for the variety.  It was $17 per adult for lunch.",dMvs7AzNmnXweaZ6SJlNrw,3,3,3,Wu9KAboqIebBn6g3axHDog

The service was good.  The waitresses were fast, efficient, and attentive.  They brought us water right away and were happy to split the bill 8 ways (not like it's really that hard though, its all the same price for everyone).  

Anyhoo, onto the food.  There were so many different kinds of rolls; some really hit the spot and others just didn't cut it.  The fish was fresh enough for my liking, and the albacore was really good.  Their udon soup noodle bowls were surprisingly good with perfectly Q noodles, which is saying a lot because I am very critical about the Q factor in my noodles.  I love their Red Bean ice cream and the chocolate fondue fountain.  The hot foods were just average, nothing worth raving about.

Dessert is secretly my favorite part of buffets, which is why I deducted 1 star for Makino's fail on dessert.  Don't get me wrong, there is a vast selection of desserts available, and I got excited just looking at all the different selections.  And damn, did it look good.  But. A big But.  Looks can be oh so deceiving.  After getting 1 of each dessert to share with my friends and I (so that we could first get a sample of everything to see what we liked), we didn't like any dessert.  Not one!  All of the desserts tasted very stale and lacked any flavor whatsoever.  I was very disappointed.  But I just ate my feelings away with the Red Bean ice cream and the chocolate fondue fountain.  They really saved the day.  

So bottom line, come here for the variety of rolls and sashimi, the udon, and the good service.  But don't be expecting a lot from the dessert.   It's a good price compared to other buffets on the strip, just be careful because I definitely got food coma driving back to LA from Vegas after conquering this bad boy.",k0FKn68kcbmz2ycSUL-4Yg,0,0,4,fmXz0aHHLg1et-DPbNL-Cg

Was in Vegas this past weekend, and we decied to go to the outlets.  We got a late start on the day, so by the time we were done shopping, it was already time for dinner (yeah, it was that late of a start).  My friends' fiancee had been craving sushi so we decided to check this place out.

We got there just as they opened, which was nice because everything out there was fresh.  They had 15-20 different types of sushi/nigiri to try, udon soup, tempura, other types of salad, and some hot entrees which included ribs, teriyaki chicken, pasta, sea bass, and other entrees.  They also had a decent variety of dessert (creme brulee, ice cream, chocolate fountain, fruits, etc..).

This is your classic example of quantity vs. quality.  For the money (23.95 for dinner, 14.95 for lunch), as long as you can pack it down, you'll get your money's worth.  The quality is about maybe a little better than what you'd expect for all you can eat.  I felt bad for my friend though- he hates seafood, and the non-seafood entrees weren't that great.

The miso soup was crazy too. It came out of a vending machine like a beverage dispenser. It must have been turned down on the mix to water ratio because it had almost no flavor.

We have been to the one on Flamingo years ago and didn't really like it then. We received a gift certificate from a friend and thought we would try it again because she seemed to like it and she is Japaneese. After about 15 minutes we just decided to go pay and not risk getting sick after trying bites of different items. It wouldn't have been a big loss since the gift certificate covered the majority. When paying, we told the front desk that we thought it was disgusting and they didn't seem to be surprised and actually didn't make us pay. They tried giving the gift card back and I had to decline LOL. If you care about the taste and quality of the food you eat, this is not for you.

2810154,2012-07-27,0,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"While travelling for the first time in Las Vegas, my family and I found that this places was the best buffet in our price range. The sushi rolls where very delicious with an extensive amount of teriyaki and salads, but no sashimi. Still, the place is relatively clean and feels like how most buffets in Vegas should be like, but are not. 

The kitchen staff is very dedicated to serving the best Japanese cusine has to offer, with bits of tempera shrimp in and excellent udon broth. The wasabi fish egg rolls also offered a unique taste I thoroughly enjoyed. That said, along with the prices range, this place has the best sushi chefs in the area.

Unfortunately, not everything could be perfect. Though the staff of chefs creating masterful creations behind the open counter did their job very professionally, I could not say the same about the waitresses. As one of the many Asian-American families eating at the restaurant, my family noticed how there were frequent stares from the busing staff. They were very discourteous by talking behind our backs, as I noticed how they stared waiting for us to leave. This is because as travellers we wanted to stay for a bit to rest, but the staff probably wanted us to leave quickly for more room even though there were plenty of spaces left. I am disappointed by the waitress staff, not the food or the kitchen staff. 

One more thing, the chocolate fountain I believed was gone is actually back and very tasty.",mps5TmKUEzKmP8gU3jK2SA,0,0,4,PLz2d-qjHbNR4CxNxCkWlw

2895621,2012-09-15,1,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"This was pretty good AYCE sushi, although I have to say that this rating probably is more truly teetering between a 3.5 to 3.75.  Part of the reason is because they do put some tuna sashimi out.  However, they were iced (as they should be) but they were not thawed out all the way so you were eating a tuna ... half popsicle sorta.  It wasn't that bad, but that's the best way to describe it.

The sushi itself was great.   I agree with some of the reviews where they tend to overdo it on the sauces for the rolls.  However, they do actually hand make the rice squares so they're packed in unliked some AYCE places where they use the rice square maker for nigri sushi.  It looks great until you pick it up and it falls apart on you.

I can't speak to the other side of the house (hot foods) since I usually don't even go towards those, but it looked pretty good.

Overall, this place definitely scores decently.  Could use a little TLC on the sashimi end, but overall it was a hit, especially after an afternoon of shopping.",cviyGIyg_hAa8_BZ9FIFRw,2,0,4,sycidSb4kLn_zDMJQOivyw

That's right folks, I could have swore I got the H1N1 virus, otherwise known as the swine flu, Friday afternoon when I was having diarrhea at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets Friday afternoon.

It all started just a few hours after my family and some family friends had a nice lunch at the Makino all-you-can-eat buffet in the mall.  Then, I would find myself running to the restroom on a minutes notice; never more than an hour a part.  The sad part was, we had already bought tickets that morning to see the show LOVE at the Mirage for that evening.  In addition, we had bought tickets for Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian for Saturday evening. 

The Beatles LOVE show would start at 7pm.  As we all got ready at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club, I kept getting sickier and strong nausea feelings came over me.  When we got downstairs to wait for the valet, I knew it was coming.  I ran to the lobby restroom and filled their sink.    I told the reception afterwards, and they were very nice about it and said they would get housekeeping to clean it. 

I made it to the show, but as you can imagine, I saw little of it.  Most of my time was spent in the bathroom there.  Thank goodness, LOVE had restrooms inside the theater. 

To make a long story short, after the show, my gf got sick.  Once back at the HGVC, my parents both got sick with the same symptoms I had.  My sister got sick two days later.  Once everyone got sick, I had a good feeling it wasn't the flu I had acquired, but rather food poisoning for the Makino Restuarant.  The food poisoning probably was due to bad food preparation.",r8K_otRpn0pWnhwL5pHcNA,0,0,1,TslzcWaXQKXCO948k2B4og

Located at the Premium outlet in downtown.  Its in a nice location, for tourist to come and have a good buffet.  Wasn't fond of the garage being a bit tight, when it comes to coming in and out of the garage.  But, that's one of the things I didn't like about the area around Makino.  The other thing that bothered me, is the fact, that they didn't really have a place that's shaded near Makino, except the food court which is further down the way.  Going during a scorching hot day, and no breeze, basically you want to get into the department store just to get under an air conditioner, before moving on.  

But once inside Makino, its a very nice setting, very spacious and roomy.  It does have a place for big parties.  It has one side for sushi and one side for regular food, like teriyaki and steam rice.  All of that, close together on a corner of the restaurant.  Of course I had  my fair share of sushi and teriyaki, as well as so much more.  I loved it!!!

The staff was very nice, even though we did came with a big party, they seem really nice and helpful.  Made sure our drinks were full and gave us extra napkins when we needed them.  

Now if you like sushi, teriyaki and the thought of it being a buffet.  Then this is the right place for you.  If your going on a scorching hot day, I would suggest not to wear to much clothing.  But the fact that we were coming from a baby's baptism, it was kind of uncomfortable going out in the sun, with a button up shirt and tie.

They had a station w/miso soup or udon soup.  The miso was a little on the salty side and had cucumbers in it for some reason.  The udon soup had lots of enoki and shitake mushrooms so the broth was slightly salty but still good.  You can add tempura crunchies, green onion and chili powder to it as well.

Cold Appetizers include salad, cold glass noodles (very vinegary) and other things.

Hot food includes :  pork tonkatsu (very good!), fried rice, chow mein, seafood noodles, sea bass, stuffed cod, bacon wrapped zucchini, beef teriyaki (dry and tough)

Desserts come w/fruit (little dry) an actual chocolate fountain to dip marshmallows in, different small jellos, pies, mousses, cakes and a guy serving ice cream in cones, including green tea which was really yummy

the sushi is on par with onami and todai, which i agree with.  so it's good but it's still mass produced and not a real authentic experience.  but we are in vegas the land of fake and make believe.  the food is not fake but it's not custom made like a real sushi bar.  granted you are also not paying the same price either.  i will say the sushi is made fairly well and doesn't fall apart too easily.  the selection is really quite good, some totally raw stuff, some cooked sushi, and also quite a few rolls as well.  

it also has some hot foods, teriyaki beef, poached salmon, tempura-ed items as well.  some miso soup, udon noodles, with the broth being dispensed from a machine that keeps it hot and pours out just the right amount for your bowl.  the dessert area is also quite good as well, nice selection of stuff to choose from.  some small cakes, jello, ice cream and pastries as well.  all in all a good time to had by all but the most pickiest of people.  

waitstaff is pretty attentive and come around pretty often.  drinks are replenished quite often.  tables are cleaned and turned around pretty fast, depending on the need.  otherwise the waitstaff is pretty much invisible.

This place is really an enjoyable place to eat.  It's hard for me to give anyone 5 stars but this place really deserves it",nT9alA4GvQEcpviGMm1jtQ,1,0,5,iGoLbnoTELVxuK-aOrQoGg

I've reviewed the other Makino down on Decatur back in the day when the place was really great in my opinion.  So I'm gonna keep this one a little short.

Wow Makino, what has happened to you lately?  You used to be the place to go to for some decent AYCE sushi.  I mean you still are decent, but is that the main goal?  To be decent?  No plans to exceed expectations?  Come on Mr. Makino...I even saw you in the restaurant the day we ate there!  My kids were in awe!  Mainly because they thought you were gonna break out in a knife pose at any second!  Gotta thank those commercials you ran a few years back.  Makino!

I enjoy other sushi places around town, but I go to Makino for the easy layout of cool sushi and hot dishes.  Your sushi section is A-OK on a good day, but can you please back off with so many things looking like a darn 'California Roll'?  More sashimi please!  And sometimes the quality is a bit meh...sometimes the sushi looks like it sits for a bit too long.  These are things that can be easily fixed though if Makino was a bit more vigilant with maintaining quality standards.  

Little secret about Makino, you can also ask the sushi chef on duty to make you a hand roll!  They hardly ever put them out on the line, but ask and the chef should be happy to make you one.  But, alas the pickings are slim.  I was only able to get a California hand roll (hmpf, really?  OMG),  spicy tuna hand roll, or a veggie roll.  Ask for a simple salmon roll and you get a ""Sorry, salmon only for sushi"" response.  Figures!  Expand the hand rolls (somehow this sounds funny) and you would get some happy campers back to your establishment.

I do rather enjoy their hot foods selection most times though.  Their noodles are good, and I love it when there is teriyaki steak on the line (new tray and fresh!).  But I love, love, love it when Makino has sukiyaki to eat!  Oh man, that is my special treat!  I love me some sukiyaki!  I make like 4 bowls of the stuff, a side of sushi, and I am a happy man.  Needless to say I get a little disappointed when there is no sukiyaki on the chow line.  Why Makino, why did you install one of those lame miso soup machine stations!  It is whack!  It pisses me off when I see this machine in the Rio buffet, and it still pisses me off when I see it here at your establishment.  How hard is it to make miso soup??  I feel like I am at 7-11 making myself a cup of hot chocolate!  Get rid of the machine please and bring back the large pot that when I open the lid I can get a minor steam burn.

Desserts are a bit on the bland side too, might need some updating there.  I enjoy the cute little bite-sized portions though, leaves you a lot of room to try one of everything.  And the chocolate fountain?  Getting a bit cliche, don't you think?  If I see one more kid pretending his finger is a marshmallow or pineapple chunk...I'm gonna scream!  Which is why I normally proceed to settle for a scoop of red bean or green tea ice cream.

Seems this Makino now serves a ton of folks on the charter tours, lots of Chinese folks coming through daily for lunch, then spending their money on multiple Coach bags by taking advantage of our weakened dollar.  Guess a restaurant's gotta do what a restaurants gotta do to stay alive.  Thankfully, the servers at Makino are quick, polite, keep your drink filled, and clear out your plates in a fashionable manner.  I guess they expect the turnover!

Mr. Makino, please turn your restaurant baby back to higher-end sushi dining!  Although I will graciously continue to go back to your decently priced $16 for lunch until then.  That is all!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,0,3,BObM9cf9XBnu9umF7Gn6YQ
4024666,2009-07-18,6,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"Ahhhh..Makinos.... My first initial favorite sushi buffet!  (Too bad you are in vegas otherwise I'd be there once a week!)

I know that real sushi fanatics don't believe in sushi buffets, but for huge fusion sushi fan like myself, Makino's is heaven.

First of all, the price for lunch is about $14, and Dinner will run you about 20.  I think the weekend pricing  is like $17 and $25 respectively.

Sushi selection... it's got everything you would want.  Various types of California roll mixes, simple nigiri sushi, and other tasty variations of fusion sushi that you can indulge all you want as long as you can stuff it!  I can't tell you what my favorite roll is because the sushi chefs gets creative all the time, so everytime I went, it's always something different!  

For those non-sushi fans, they also got a very nice hot dishes.  The tasty selections includes traditional shrimp/vegetable tempuras, fried oysters, steamed white fish, white wine clams, BBQ riblets, Fried rice and Yakisoba.  All are very tasty!  So you definitely will not feel left out if you are not into the raw fish deal.

The dessert section is ok... all the cakes and sweets taste generic (as if they were taken out of a box from trader joes or something), but they do have the bomb red bean ice cream which I always have some at the restaurant, and have to have a cone to go as well.  But you will have to ask for it (that is the only problem because it's not self serve)
Lastly, for those that craves sweets, there is a chocolate fountain that you can literally dip anything into  (If you believe in spider roll covered in dark rich chocolate.. I guess go right ahead.....)  But you can definitely dip as much as your heart desires!)

This location that I'm rating (in the  LV outlets) and the off the strip location (Decatur) to me taste comparable.  Therefore, either one you go you should not be disappointed.  However, just remember that this is a buffet, so for those hard core sushi fanatics, please leave the mindset of having the top notch fresh sushi like you would at a $200 a night sushi restaurant mentality at home so you won't be disappointed, but just enjoy how much you are paying for such tasty creations drawn up by Mr. Makino.",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,10,9,5,rTyzxuuJ6ewj0Ts1xXINjQ

I can't say much for the rest of the food for me not eating seafood or sushi.

Service was quick. Every time I got up from the table, my plate was gone when I came by. And my drinks were full every time they got empty.

DO NOT EAT THE SASHIMI. The fish isn't high enough grade to enjoy by itself. The salmon and the tuna I had was actually tough instead of metling in your mouth. It LOOKED good though, but I guess looks can be deceiving. The rice isn't really that good and sometimes has been sitting out so long that it's a bit hard. Overall, the sushi was alright. I've been to a few AYCE sushi place and this is on the lower end. I think Todai is better.

The udon noodles were good, the soup was a bit weak though. It tasted too water down.

The desserts was sadly lacking. The flan was too hard (not soft or creamy at all) and the fruits weren't that sweet. 

That being said, this place is 17 bucks on the weekend. That's pretty cheap anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way here, but if you're near the outlets and feel like sushi, this is an OK place to go.",gABvk6IN4ajT52jCTUlfhA,0,0,3,OY8vgTWRIdiB50yRAqM2Og

This Makino is conveniently located within a shopping complex - the Premium Outlet (yes, girlfriends. This is like a garden in heaven!) So you can eat up and then work out the food by walking and shopping. Or, the other way around, whichever. 
Anyway, oh yes, almost forgot:  the food. 
This is a buffet Japanese seafood style. Plenty selection of sushi, sashimi, seafood salad etc. Selection extends to hot food and some non-seafood and hot food. They have miso soup and Udon. All self serve.  Good election of desert, and they even have Chocolate Fountain!!!! 
Quality is decent. And for the price you pay for seafood buffet, I'd say this place beats those pricey ones inside casinos. $22 for dinner will get you a large variety, satisfy your cravings and get full.

Who knew the desert would have good sushi? I stumbled on this place while I was at a convention in Las Vegas. I was sick of hotel and fast food so I goggled the closest sushi place that was off the Strip. Makino was one of the first places that came up and it was at an outlet mall. Since I had time to kill, I decided to have lunch there then do some window shopping. For the price, quality, and variety this place is awesome. They have a wide range of sushi, sashimi, tempura, chicken teriyaki, seafood, & other popular Japanese dishes. If you are an AAA member, stop by the customer service stand and get a coupon book. You can get a free drink which is a 3 dollar savings. Keep in mind there is a 3 hour window to eat at Lunch and Dinner (this is to keep the sushi & sashimi fresh). There's also usually a Japanese tour group that comes thru, but it never affect any waits. This is definitely one of my favorite Japanese places. 

A little about my credentials:

I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,1,2,5,FtFFu6t3sMnmBq4xkqHzqA

Hot Entree's: I didn't even touch this, SUPER SUPER Greasy. You could see the oil bubbles. This wasn't Japanese hot dishes more like Americanized fast Chinese Food. 

Sushi: It wasn't fresh at all I'm guessing because they make it then its left out till someone grabs it and they love to pack on the rice, ONLY great thing about this place is they don't care if you eat the rice or not. So I had myself a lot of shashimi. 

Soup/Udon Noodles: There was a small area were the udon noodles were already pre-put into bowls and all you had to do was fill the bowl up with soup. The soup lacked flavor, the noodles were were out so long they dried up. Also no good. 

Desert: Their selection of deserts were very limited and mediocre, Sorry Mr. Makino I guess I was expecting more? The only exciting this about their desert selection was the fondue chocolate fountain (which was a mess) chocolate splatters every where. On the floor on the counter every where. Also the strawberries were half frozen still so the warm fondue chocolate quickly turned cold once it touched the strawberries. I like my chocolate strawberries either hardened or warm and melty

The place: First off this place was disgusting, when I first walked in I couldn't help but notice the floor had bits and pieces of food all over it. When we sat down our table was still wet, I'm assuming the waitress just finished cleaning the table from their previous costumers. Then I noticed the towel she used to clean our table... it also had bits and pieces of food on it...which she then used to wipe another table...

What stands out about Makino's is that the quality of the food is very good. Many buffets serve large varieties, but low quality food. But this is not the case at Makino's.

You're always seated quickly and courteously, and drinks are served just as fast.  The sushi is super fresh and consistently filled. My faves are the rolls and nigiri. I always stock up on the salmon and tuna. 

The hot food section's pretty good, too. I stick to what I recognize, like the teriyaki chicken, steamed vegetables, tempura or fried rice. Once they had some very yummy tonkatsu. Desserts are also fresh and tasty. I love the ice cream and fruit.

The place is clean and there's always lots of clean plates and utensils so you're never left walking aimlessly around the restaurant hunting down a fork. The bussers always clear your table of used, empty plates with the quickness. Amazing since there's usually so many tables to get to! They're also super accommodating and sweet.

I really liked their service. The waiters were all very attentive to my table. We would finish only about half of our cups of drinks, and they would quickly come by and refill them without us having to ask. So there was actually never a time where our cups were completely empty. They got rid of of our used plates very quick also. Which made me glad because we woud have enough room for more plates of food :]

I went at lunch with my brother and mom on a Monday. So lunch cost about $16. So with everything they offered, i really do think that their price was reasonably good.

They had a big variety of sushi considering they are a buffet. Beause all asian buffets that i have been to that did serve sushi only had a small variety. So i really liked that about this place. 
Their sushi also tasted very good in my opinion (and i've eaten a ton of sushi in my lifetime)
I absolutely loved that they had shrimp tempura, because i could eat all of it as much as i wanted! Their tempura sauce tasted good too.
I didn't taste their udon noodles, but i did taste their udon soup, which tasted really good also.

I didn't get much of the other food that wasn't sushi, but the ones that i did eat were pretty good. Nothing too special, but ok none the less.

They had a wide variety of dessert also. Suprisingly, i was able to get a taste of each and every one lol I'm not a big fan of fruity desserts, so i didn't really think their desserts were all that poppin. However, if you do like fruity desserts, then i think you will love them. Their chocolate fondue was ok. I've had chocolate fondue from other places before and after the chocolate covers the fruit that you chose to dip it in, the chocolate should harden a little/dry up in less than a minute...however this place's chocolate fondue didn't do that, so i think they used the wrong type of chocolate or something...?
So my favorite dessert was the cheesecake. (omg i LOVE me some cheesecake! :O)

Overall:
-service was great
-alot of sushi, which tasted good
-their normal food was okay
-alot of dessert, tasted good

5049744,2013-01-22,1,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"So the family was in town and wanted to hit the outlets so they chose to have Makino as a convenient choice. I've never been and never really interested in going simply because ready made sushi doesn't appeal to me when there is a abundance of AYCE here.  I was surprised to find the place was packed to the gills. There didn't seem to be a extreme wait, but my family was already seated when I arrived late.

I was surprised the hot food was rather decent.  The steamed seabass and the grilled up swordfish was cooked well and tasted fresh. Teriyaki steak, pork katsu, grilled octopus was alright as well. Make your own udon bowl was not bad as well.  I was not fond of their soggy tempura, spicy sausage or stuck together gyoza. I didn't try the beef sukiyaki or chicken teriyaki and that really is just it for entrees. I was surprised that the selection wasn't more though. I got seaweed salad and hijiki salad from the cold area. The salad area is mostly prepped salads than a DIY toppings and greens salad bar.

Sushi was overall alright and you really can fare better at a all you can eat, made to order place. Mackerel, pepper tuna with hot sauce were good. Spicy crab and masago nigiri was acceptable .Clam, squid, tuna was okay..not horrible but not great and depended on which tray you got from.The inari was also  something I liked. Rolls were mostly California roll variations and sauced... Some with raw fish rolls sat out for a bit and was horrible texture so I spat it out. The one plus is that I can skim it off some of he rice and not eat it all or not eat the gross ones.  The problem is some stuff sat for a little bit like the squid which makes it not as appealing when the fish gets warmer and the rice touching the plate gets too cold, reminiscent of refrigerated grocery sushi. Come when it is busy, this is not a place to come during a slow time as that means low turn over on the food! 

Dessert wise, their green tea and red bean ice cream is good - not too sweet and smooth. There was sesame crisps that I crushed up and strawberries I sliced to top it off and make it better. They have a chocolate fondue which is rather kitsch to dip your own fruits and marshmallows in. To me, its just a glorified chocolate syrup fountain that looks cool though and wasn't that tasty. I took bites of random cakes and all were just meh so I didn't eat it.

Service was okay. My water was filled once I told them I was new and didn't have a drink. Our plates were stacking up towards the end though.  

For Sunday lunch at $18.95 its probably a more affordable than Todai that is similar of a concept, but compared to a AYCE sushi joint it doesn't do the job for me. I wouldn't be eating here if it wasn't for family being Filipino that love a buffet and it being convenient to our day at the outlet. I don't really see any other time I would come back either.

Firstly, the sashimi was improperly sliced.  Sashimi-grade ahi, pre-frozen or not, should NOT be cut into cubes.  Sashimi needs to be sliced a certain way to properly enjoy the raw fish.  Trust me here, properly sliced ahi feels texturally better in the mouth and even tastes better.

The entrees weren't all that great either.  Much of it was not new at all, some of it had been sitting there for a while.  Oh, and the chocolate fountain was on and all, but there was nothing to cover in chocolate.

I came here today for lunch and the price was about 16 bucks and drinks were 2.50 so for two people that came out to be a few bucks shy of 40 dollars and that's excluding tips. 

I tried every one of their rolls which didn't have names titled to them and they all tasted a little sub par with a lot of places I've been to. It just didn't taste that fresh or popped out once entering mouth. It doesn't happen that often where I feel a little let down by the food. 

I order tea also by the way and all they give you is a pack of tea and hot water. Is it just me or is this the norm now? Most places I've been to they serve the tea ready to drink.. all you have to do is wait for it to cool down. 

I also had their katsu pork which tasted old with no crunch left in it's life !! How sad to die without honor !! 

It felt a little dirty when you see imitation crab meat mixed in with the cucumbers.. unless that's what they intended to do. Correct if i'm wrong but shouldn't the veggies stay isolated to themselves. Eeek !!

My boyfriend and I went there for his friend's son's 1 year old birthday party.  Who knew people can choose to have their birthdays here.  I shouldn't be too surprised as anything goes in Vegas.

The rolls and sushi itself were overall pretty high quality, maybe not the best that one could offer but it's good enough for me to enjoy without fail. Aside from that, I did also enjoy the other dishes like the Beef Teriyaki and the Sukiyaki Beef; it's good but it's .. buffet quality good. The Sea Bass was very good though.

Service was apt and kind. Took away the dishes whenever they saw a finished & empty plate and refilled on drinks without asking.

That light bulb in my head shined bright when I heard we were heading to an AYCE sushi place (+ more). 

This restaurant, located in an outdoor shopping mall/outlet in Vegas made me yearn for sushi as I saw their sushi display. They had other sections, such as, a soup section (miso soup, etc), hot foods with mussels, noodles, etc, but all I cared for (besides dessert) was just  sushi.  Everything looked good, but there weren't any labels of what exactly each sushi was. Luckily I had an eye for sushi, being that I LOVE sushi, and was able to distinguish what each roll had. Everything looked fresh.. or so I thought. 

As I sat down, I devoured, well, tried to devour each roll. I couldn't eat everything from each piece of sushi because geez, there was SO MUCH RICE. C'mon people, where is my fish?I didn't pay for rice! I literally had a pile of rice chunks on my plate, just so I didn't get full off of rice. I need to make room for other things like dessert! Plus the fish didn't feel or taste fresh at all. But I guess that happens when you're at an AYCE sushi buffet +more. If you've been to Todai, then Makino's is like or perhaps a little bit better than Todai's quality of sushi. I honestly don't think my $16.95 (wkend lunch price) was worth it. But I did eat it any way, and managed to eat some of the tempura shrimps they had, which weren't that bad. 

The best thing that this place offers, besides good service, was their dessert! Yes, there are cookies, mini cakes (that are what ever), but they have GREEN TEA ice cream.. and drum roll pls..... RED BEAN ICE CREAM, one of my favorite flavors, EVER! Oh man, I felt like I was in red bean, green tea heaven. I have never in my life been to a place that offers all you can eat green tea and red bean ice cream. NOM NOM NOM, is exactly what you heard after going back two times to get more of it.

Yes people, this is the buffet to go to when you are in Vegas if you are craving for Sushi. You will get a great value when you come here for lunch, I believe it was around $16. Many of the locals come here and sure enough, I love local places.

I remembered they open at 11:30am. It's okay because you can roam around the outlets nearby if you come early.  The cut rolls here are top notch. The cold appetizer bar has the usual edamame and tofu and sometimes beef tartar?? What a bargain! 

Your hot foods consists of the tempuras, the chickens. What I usually get is the clams in this butter, ginger broth. OMG, it is SO good (and yet so bad for you). I finish with the green tea ice cream. You will need to ask the person behind the counter to get it.  There's no sign for it so you will need to ask.

5361293,2012-12-09,0,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"**Summary**
       - The only other buffet is Todai (in Planet Hollywood) and I think that place is way over-priced for the same quality.
       - vs AYCE - The main difference between Makino and AYCE Sushi places is that everything is laid out buffet style vs you ordering things. This allows you to see the rolls/nigiri that you might want visually before ordering. This is probably a better choice for the less sushi seasoned.
       - Quality - The quality of the fish has always been decent. Compared to AYCE places, it'll probably be in the upper half. With that said, there are a lot of poor quality AYCE places in vegas.
       - Sashimi - They have sashimi for their dinner prices. It won't be entree quality at a straight sushi place, but it's decent.
       - Nigiri - They have all the normal nigiri and hand rolls in a section. You can ask them for special hand rolls too.
       - Rolls - Their rolls are very colorful spread out as they are and seem like they have a lot of variety. However, most of the rolls are very similar. If you're looking for something different, AYCE places would be more suitable.
       - Hot Foods - They have a large assortment of hot dishes like tempura, noodles (udon and sukiyaki), chicken/beef teriyaki, that cheesy thing inside a shrimp shell, etc.
       - Desserts - The desserts are great. You have crepes, ice creams, tarts, creme brules, and their own chocolate fountain.
**Pros vs AYCE**
       - You can sample everything and aren't constricted to ordering half rolls.
       - It is very friendly for sushi newbies since they can see all the foods before they select them.
       - The hot foods are more in variety.
       - The desserts are better and have more choices.
**Cons vs AYCE**
       - The sushi level in both quality and innovation is lower to the better of the AYCE places.
**Price**
       - $16.95 Buffet Lunch 11:30am-4pm Mon-Thu
       - $18.95 Buffet Lunch 11:30am-4pm Fri-Sun
       - $25.95 Buffet Dinner 5pm-8:30pm Mon-Thu
       - $26.95 Buffet Dinner 5pm-8:30pm Fri-Sun

5553381,2010-08-09,2,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"If you're a hardcore sushi fan (like me!!!) but want to go quite easy on your wallet, you gotta have your stomach ready for Makino, either the one in the LV Outlet Center or at the Decatur/Flamingo intersection, whichever is more convenient to your ""stay.""  Oh, and don't bother going here if you're only down for non-seafood meats; they barely serve them..

In terms of sushi, why I love having this type of AYCE because they definitely have a diverse array of delectable rolls (hand or cut) and literal sushi.  Because there were sooo many of them, and not every one has a label indicating what kind of roll it is, I cannot say which one is the best ^_^.

Among other things, they have yummy udon and ramen, and their dessert was grand.  The absolute must-gets are the red bean ice cream, green tea ice cream, crepes, and chocolate-covered strawberries (well, unfortunately I didn't see this one nor the crepes in the LV Outlet Center..).  And for dinner they offer the snow crab legs; sure, they're tasty, but it's very easy to notice its okay quality especially after eating the ones at Studio B Buffet or the Bellagio Buffet.

In the end, my critical suggestion to you Yelpers and readers is to go for lunch instead of dinner.  The only difference besides the $9 gap is that for dinner only Snow Crab Legs and oysters appeared, which is why I actually ate more of the legs than my sushi on previous visits, plus you're better off getting those and pay your money's worth at the buffets I just mentioned.  And, in my opinion, I like the one in Decatur/Flamingo location better, b/c they somehow have more sushi variety than this, but I'll totally understand if you dine here during your shopping extravaganza =).",jQYIE9bjrh9EP-B5FXpqPw,3,3,4,A7OTX68MPpRMAv5chJOZEA

I dunno maybe it was the time that other people went that made the difference. I got there at 11:45am about 15 minutes after they opened. The sushi was great. Yeah it might not be the same as an upscale sushi restaurant (I've been to China Grill at Mandalay, Nobu at Hard Rock), but for what you pay it's definitely worth it.

On top of all the great sushi they have, there is also some great desserts. Cheesecake, red bean jello, green tea jello, red bean ice cream, they have a chocolate fountain with marshmellows, pineapples, strawberries, cantalope, honey dew and oranges.

My soda glass was never empty, and my plates when they were done were cleared before I got back from getting seconds.

Overall my experience there was great and I would go back again. Meal for lunch came out to $19.13 - breaks down from $15.95 for lunch plus soda $1.75.",zzGcw1Zam6mLzUO3ZMC0TA,3,2,4,5NmMfjLIOgCmldqLyz3AbA

Everything in Makino is solid in terms of quality (for a buffet) in terms of sushi, crab legs, cooked food, desserts.  More importantly, it's convenient, there's no wait, and very affordable compared to buffets on the Strip!

The place could use a bit more variety, but what they do have is good.  The turnover was high enough that I don't feel like anything was sitting there too long.  All in all, a tasty dinner for $25-$30 bucks.  :)",dVHL4K-c50SgSDkawlZeVw,0,0,3,7NUoRjI2N6UufwuQD1uQxQ

Desert was filled with fruits, a chocolate fountain, different cakes and cheese cakes, creme brulee, the makino special (jello, fruit, strawberry topping, whipped cream, caramel drizzle).  Everything was pretty good.  My favorite was the Makino Special.  Overall, I'd eat here again.

Came here this past Sunday for lunch with my bf and a few of my gfs.

My gf suggested Makino for lunch. After briefly looking at the reviews here on yelp, I knew not to expect anything special.

Food was just ok. Mushrooms were raw that day. 
Only thing I really liked was the green tea ice cream.

About $20 for lunch AYCE.

I've been to a handful of AYCE sushi joints in LV and this is on the bottom of my list.

We went for lunch and everything I tried ranged from good to excellent. They even have chocolate fondue for dessert! I am already planning out the next time I come back here, that's how good it was to me. Plus, the lunch prices are very reasonable for an all you can eat buffet.

5918691,2010-09-20,0,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"Summary - Not bad AYCE sushi & seafood buffet + premade desserts (including chocolate fountain) for the price.
This particular Makino is located in the Premium Outlet (Downtown area), close to where the I-15 meets the 95. With busloads of tourists and locals looking for bargains at the outlet shops and working up a good appetite, it is usually packed during lunch and dinner. The restaurant itself is fairly large, and can usually accommodate the crowd without long wait time, although this is partially due to the tight arrangement of the tables and chairs.
 
The waitresses are all Japanese from what I have observed, which is a good thing for authenticity, and are usually very friendly and do their best to look after the customers. The sushi bar of course is mostly staffed by non-Japanese chefs/cooks that prepare the sushi rolls and nigiri menu. As the sushi and the rolls are prepared and then presented for the customers to serve themselves buffet-style, there is pretty much no interaction with the sushi chefs.
 
Overall, the food is okay and the price is cheap. The menu features both cold and hot foods. For the sushi, the fish is not the highest sashimi quality, but still good enough to serve raw.  But avoid food that have been left out awhile, because fresher is always better, especially when it comes to sushi.  The menu offers most of the typical nigiri sushi items san the premium items (uni, toro, etc) and different variations of sushi rolls garnished with different sauces.   Their hot entrees feature the regular lineup of items at most Asian buffets, such as teriyaki beef/chicken, pot stickers, fried rice, baked clams plus scallops on shells, seafood dynamite, grill salmon and more. In terms of variety it offers way more than the average diner can sample on a single visit.

For what it is, Makino is highly recommended. Just be sure to arrive early and not close to the restaurant's closing time, because the crew starts cleaning up and will probably be out the door if you take your time trying to eat right up to closing time.

5986581,2010-09-02,0,FCP5hYaTtn6dkpmZ_NTvEw,"If you don't want the cigarette smoke that comes with a casino buffet, Makino is a good option.  Just don't expect the prime rib or turkey carving stations that you normally see at buffets.

The food is Asianesque, if you didn't know, with freshly made rolls/sushi, udon on tap, numerous salads, and a whole bunch of fried goodness.  We went on a very busy day, which helped with the food rotation.  Service is good, drinks refilled in a timely manner, and plates cleared frequently.  The dessert row has lots to choose from, including shave ice, ice cream, and a chocolate fountain. The fresh fruit selection is good, featuring kiwi, strawberries, melons, and grapes.

Good choices for kids, decent sushi selection. Makino does a lot well, but i can't think of anything here that was GREAT, hence the 3 instead of 4 stars.  I've been here numerous times, and will continue to eat here when out of towners request it.",jfG6Tgnw3xFfIOaSZakSUQ,0,0,3,2ZJ66HIknzpWKGDbpp2VHw
