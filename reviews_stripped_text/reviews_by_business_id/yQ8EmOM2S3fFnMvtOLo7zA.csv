First of all, they provide really friendly customer service - this place just has a good vibe.  Also, their produce section is great - fresh shipments comes in every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  They also carry some items that I haven't seen at any other Indian market in town, like this Mangalorean specialty called kori roti (a kind of thin crispy rice bread).

Initially, the store was a bit disorganized but they have done a good job organizing the place. We try to go midweek as they get fresh veggies on Tuesday and Saturday(I think!)

Almost everything is available here and the owners are very customer oriented and quickly help us find anything we cannot locate ourselves.

They have a delicious aisle full of indian snacks available in bags(the alternative to the potato chip). As well, you can find different varieties of indian bread-naan, tandoori roti, parantha etc. as well as deserts. i've also seen ethopian injera bread being sold here-though never tried it!

I do find that their pricing for some items is a bit higher though.
Overall, a decent place to pick up indian groceries close to home.",g6pwf1E-CylnZQRoaZGGdw,1,1,4,9oEfRrDucCzdcS52eO2kGQ

I could just wander and smell the spices in the air for hours.  For the record, I am not of Indian decent, but I am a minority and grew up eating ethnic cuisine in whatever hole-in-the-wall restaurant my grandfather could find and this market brings back old memories of a man who traveled the world many times over.  I've been shopping here for years and they have a little bit of everything, but my staple is a 10lb bag of authentic Basmati rice.  As others noted, the shopping center is sketchy but I always go at night and have never had an issue.  The employees will answer any question you have so don't be afraid to ask--they can also tell you the days when they get fresh produce.

I used to shop at their previous store which was much smaller and as I was driving thru Tropicana and Maryland parkway, I saw that it's a HUGE grocery store now. I was so excited to try it out, it probably one of the biggest Indian grocery store I have visited.

They have practically everything you need!! From all types of basmati rice, flour, lentils, fresh vegetables, frozen foods, Indian snacks and sweets and lots more.

The big disappointment was that so many items in the store had no price tag!! The entire section of frozen foods, naan, roti and vegetables had no pricing on it. Please put a price tag on all your merchandise. When I asked one of the store member the price for frozen naan, she said she had no clue and you find out at the register!! 

At check out the man charged me for 2 bags of frozen drumsticks when I had only 1. I brought it to his attention and he gave me a terrible look and fixed it, no apology!!",jZUpqurVtlrN2QrgLxQzZw,4,2,3,0RgnNidAF_H_aYuKeDXg8A

The spice selection is fantastic and for the most part, organized. The produce is pretty legit. Lot of ""unusual"" items like dragonfruit, and fresh okra. Get creative. Google their uses. You'd be surprised.

Lots of different rices and flours for any carb-friendly palate.

If you do a lot of Indian grocery shopping, and you find that this store is missing an item, tell the owner. He'll have it there by the next day or so. Excellent customer service.

One last note, check out the snack aisle. All kinds of amazing stuff. And most of it is buy 2 get 1 free. Can't beat that!!",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,7,2,4,rEmG8mb2E099W2mlZvpuRQ

Some of the food items are fresh, but the prices tend to be bit higher. Overall, if you don't want to drive to the other side of the town, than this store is a alright option for you to shop at.

Right west of India Market is another shopping center that is extremely similar, except for the fact that this center has no open businesses. This confused me at first, but quickly discovered India Market was located in the next door shopping center. I personally would not come to this area again at night time. It was a little sketchy and I rushed myself into the store. Inside are small, cramped aisles of snacks, bottles of sauces, tons of rice/grains, produce, and frozen foods. It was packed with people too! Nonetheless, the man and lady at he register were quick to help me find what I needed.

4520414,2013-10-02,5,yQ8EmOM2S3fFnMvtOLo7zA,"India Market has been located in this plaza for almost 10 years now. My family has been shopping it since I was a small boy. There's definitely been a lot of expansion and change to the entire store and its customers. It has evolved from selling products only Indians would purchase to products that attract a lot of local Ethiopians as well. What started as a small Indian store ran by a husband and wife has since expanded into the neighboring spaces in the mall. The demand has definitely soared over the years, especially since it is the oldest Indian market in Las Vegas... fyi there's only 1 other major one in Vegas.

The store itself is located in the back end of a rather aging strip mall on Maryland Parkway and Tropicana near the UNLV Campus. The physical facility definitely shows its age, a large canopy sign with black font reading ""India Market"" covers the top of the entrance. As you enter the store the first thing that greets you is the end of the checkout counter. The store is decently size, ~1000 - 1250 sq ft. However it is immensely packed with gondolas stuffed with product, only 3-4 ft of space between each aisle. I can say with confidence they probably don't pass ADA requirements. The densely packed store is filled with many different cuisines from the heart of India; they sell lots of products, produce, and groceries from many different regionals of India. I know when I'm running an errand for Indian groceries; India Market always seems to carry what I'm looking for. 

India Market is definitely home to many staple ingredients, and foods of Indian Cuisine. They have everything any anything from turmeric powder, basmati rice, lentils, and spices all straight from India. What's also great about India Market is there wide selection of Indian beverages and brands straight from India. They carry it all, from mango juice, litchi juice, aloe vera juice, and imported sodas such as limca and thumbs up. If that doesn't take the cake, they also carry freshly made Ethiopian bread! India market really does do a great job bringing in all varieties of ethnically diverse foods from India and Ethiopia! To put it in to a percentage, India market probably carries ~80% ethnic/specialty foods versus your typical American foods. Of course the other 20% consists of regular American soda, and groceries such as lettuce, onions, peppers, etc.

The Organization, arrangement, sanitation, and merchandising are completely different that what you would expect at an American grocery store. Since the shop is run like a mom and pop, it's definitely nothing hear the corporate American model. As I mentioned earlier the store is decently sized for being located in a strip mall, however it is packed like a maze with gondolas and freezers linking the floors. The store is clean and bearable, it's by no means filthy or dirty but then again it doesn't come close to a traditional American grocery store. Likewise, there's very minimal merchandising, the store is sectioned by small hanging signs, but there's no order to the madness, if it's a spice section be prepared to find turmeric powder next to cumin seeds.

In a nutshell, go into this place with expectations of a mom and pop shop oriented towards Indian's and you'll definitely get the experience. This place is PACKED with different India products... sometimes it feels like they imported the entire store from India.",WHpHghXp9EkIHyljDgjNeA,13,3,4,C5JCgRLFh7ZLIuY1vDlg1w

Gopal's India market is a family owned business and carries a wide variety of that desiness that we all crave. Over the years, this place is small compared to the new Indian markets that have opened up, but in no way is this place inferior to the others. If you can handle narrow spaces & a multitude of Indians/Arabs/Ethiopians...then this is a convenient market that houses your Shan/MDR/National/Ahmed spices & desserts, your daal & chawaal (rice), frozen foods & one-minute khanas, and the fresh veggies!

5199254,2010-03-26,5,yQ8EmOM2S3fFnMvtOLo7zA,"Usually if I am talking about ""Indian"" it is closely followed by ""buffet,"" but if you like Indian food and haven't tried the prepackaged Indian meals, I highly recommend giving them a try. They can be extra helpful when you are not the cooking type or when you are on the road. Whenever my husband travels, he takes a suitcase full of these little boxes of curry meals!

In Atlanta, we had a rather large Indian grocery, but when it came time to track down the boxed meals in Las Vegas, we weren't sure where to go. We went to a couple of places before arriving at India Market. The aisles are overflowing with Indian specialties and goods in every nook, corner and crevice. I am confident they have every major Indian staple or specialty item that you could want, but most importantly for us, they have an entire aisle of prepackaged meals. They were cheaper than the other Indian grocers we visited, and the staff was more helpful. They provided us an overview of all the different brands. They even had a brand we had never seen: Haldiram. It has quickly become our favorite brand.

The store is a little cluttered, and I can't attest to the quality of their other selections (that would require that I cook!), but given the friendliness of the staff, the steady flow of customers and our satisfaction with our ready to go meals, I think the store is a little Indian gem.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,10,7,4,qxaOfdt3jIGS2XlthvEpsg

The one thing I didn't like about the store was that the items didn't seem to follow a pattern.  Yes, the aisles are marked but the same item can be in a different aisle or shelf.  Example, we were buying lebnah/lebni and I saw a few brands on one shelf in one door but as we walked down there was another brand (the brand I like) a couple doors down.  Also, this place just opened so some of the items don't have prices.

The best part about this store is the staff.  They are helpful and informative.  Sometimes I get shy about coming into a place like this because even though I have eaten the items and know I like them, I don't know the names of them.  Ask any member of staff and they will help you without talking down to you or making you feel like an outsider.  Also, I believe them to be pretty honest.  While we were looking at the sangak and barbari bread in the front, the guy at the register saw us and told us that the sangak is fresh from California but the other bread was from Friday (it was a Monday) so we might not want to get it.

We got our orders within maybe 10 minutes, and the prices were reasonable considering the portion sizes. They serve burgers, wraps, curries, and quite a few other things. From what I understand everything is vegetarian.
