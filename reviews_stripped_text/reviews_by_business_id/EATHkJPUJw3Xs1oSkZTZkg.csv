Ordered excellent Honey Ginger Salmon, should've asked for Brown Rice....halfway through found a gnat alive nesting into the meat...for the waitress in time so she saw it too...3rd restaurant I've found a live gnat in last 2 years in Vegas...what a disappointment....hopefully the pies aren't affected...",Sw9SnSWl6czwotWfco-O5Q,0,0,3,CNVOdVZr7fzFDREKs4xjWg

Came in after 2pm the next day as instructed, only to be told there was a mix-up and that 2 people had ordered boston creme pies, however they only made one. Needless to say someone else had already picked up the single pie. Extremely disappointing!",ayOp6qKdplAs2ByKyAYiug,0,0,1,bUZc1QFu6RpX0mYkw00buA

We ended up eating breakfast here and unintentionally forgot to pay our bill. We also left the diner without realizing. Despite our mishap, the manager followed us and kindly reminded us of our unpaid bill. MAURICIO and CODY were very professional and didn't make us feel uncomfortable at all. It's just the best customer service you might ever get from anyone. You guys are the best!

We were stuck a few more hours and so we also had lunch here. Again very nice people, great food & the best customer service! I definitely recommend this place to everyone.",eFOoPNHmbZNLgTH1x_nF0A,4,0,5,-MvRnDM0FWrHHOLHzO0Yxw
