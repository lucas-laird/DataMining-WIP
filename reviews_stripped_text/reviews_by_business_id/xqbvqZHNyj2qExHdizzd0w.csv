Pinakbet was not impressive at all - too salty with betsuelas instead of sitaw plus talong ang kalabasa. There was no okra and ampalaya. Too much bagoong. 

Service needs improvement. We wanted to order halo-halo but hubby needed to stand up and walk to the counter to get the server's attention.  This is also a short order restaurant not fast food or AYCE buffet so be prepared to wait for your order.

We ordered drinks after our meal which was served 45 minutes after and waited 25 minutes while she chatted to people at the registrar, eventually we gave up and asked for the bill only to find we had been charged for our drinks that had never arrived! When there are only four tables needing served I was amazed at how little attention we were payed, I don't even think she smiled at us once. Plus the attitude when asked(VERY RUDE) Despite having said it before, I will definitely not be going here again.

First let's talk about food. The food here is pretty darn delicious. I can name a handful of dishes that make the trip to D'Pinoy Joint worth it (sisig, nilaga, bistec, sago gulaman, palabok, bikol express, and etc.).

The food is like how I would imagine my Lola (Lola=Grandma in Tagalog, the official language in the Philippines) would make it. Since she doesn't live anywhere near me, it was a great comfort food.

Second the atmosphere. The restaurant is small, cozy, and feels like you're in a distant relatives home. 

Then theres always a singer on stage singing songs in tagalog, which is pretty nice. Live performance and a meal that tastes homemade is amazing. 

Third the service. The waitresses and waiters are really kind, attentive, and polite. Which really is great, because in some Filipino places the servers have an 'I don't wanna serve you' tone in them. 

Overall I really do like this place, a taste of home if you may.",F6nqIdCn1AKJaZ_R3OAiKw,0,0,4,6i9ApK3g8r7pHreiRnzxNA

No follow up is made after the food is served. No refills for your water unless you call the server's attention which usually takes 15 minutes by the way. No Hi, Hello, nor thank you's either. Major major attitude and makes you feel that you're begging for their service. There was an instance when one on the owners CURSED and PUSHED one customer out of the restaurant. Whatever the reason maybe, this is deemed inappropriate especially in this kind of business where customer service should be prime. Definitely not coming back to this place again.

Adobo Rice w/ chicken- $7.99, 4 stars, alright 
Crispy Pata - $14.99, 4 stars, not enough meat...
Pancit Canton/Bihon - $7.99, 3 stars.  Too wet
1 scoop rice - $1.25, just in case adobo rice is too salty
1 Halo Halo Overload - $5.99, 5 stars

I liked that none of my orders were super salty.  I've had many Filipino restaurants where food was just doused in soy sauce or salt. 

Portions - 4.5
Value - 5
Service - 3.5.  Friendly, just not attentive enough, too lax.  Wait was 15 minutes and reasonable.

I was given really dry tocino, over cooked longanisa, and over cooked lumpiang Shanghai. I also asked for my eggs to be sunny side up, but that too was over cooked. I couldn't really taste anything from the tocino and longanisa. The best part of the meal was the Halo Halo. 

Maybe other dishes would have tasted better, but I was pretty disappointed with what I was given.

So we went here for our saturday dinner.. the interior looks good, it's like a newly built fil resto along flamingo rd.. so we asked our server and she told me that they've been there for quite awhile..
My husband was craving for pork sinigang and I was craving for pork sisig (both pork but vacation is not the right time for diet, fyi.. hehe) After serving it.... here are my reviews..

pork sinigang - if you know how the authentic sinigang taste like.. it's supposed to be ""sour"" and the taste of ""fish sauce"" and ""tamarind"" are supposed to be there... it's also a real plus if they do it with pork belly ""liempo"".. so glad that they actually mixed it perfectly!

pork sisig - they have what I was expecting! Served it in a sizzling plate with raw egg.. omg!!! and the aroma was to die for!

My husband was eyeing their halo-halo since we started so we ordered it even if we're both full!
It has a good presentation.. alot of mixed fruit and an ube ice cream with pinipig for topping! He told me that it lacked sweetness.. but I don't like it too sweet..
..a plus for me too when we're all done and on our way to our ride until I saw our server running after us holding my shades that I forgot.. kudos to you girl!

We ordered the Platter for 4 and an oxtail soup since the platter did not come with a soup. We were given a glass of water each and a bowl each for our soup. We were given the appetizer ""Okoy"" first while waiting for the rest of our order. When the rest of the order came, there were more ""Okoy"" in it. 
We ran out of water, the first glass that was served was never refilled. Our soup never came too. So we decided to take the rest of the foods home. Since no one was checking on our table, I stood up to ask for our bill. To the lady cashier and probably the owner, I mentioned that our soup never came. She inquired on whether I really put an order. I said there are bowls on our table for the soup. Then one of the guys said in Pilipino that I should have waved to get their attention and told them that our soup wasn't brought yet. Thinking to myself, I am not running for an office to be waving. Besides, their staff should anticipate our needs rather than wait for us to call their attention. Anyway, the lady tried to find out who took our order. After finding it out, he asked the person to come over. The guy that took our order came and asked if I ordered the soup. I said yes and that's why the bowls were brought to our table. Then his cell phone rang. Instead of finishing our conversation, he answered his cell and walked away talking on the phone. To make things worse, I was charged for the Okoy which was supposed to be part of the platter. The cashier said she would give us the refund but it took already more than 5 minutes and the refund wasn't brought to our table. We then decided to leave. On our way out, the lady waved at me asking me to wait for my money. I just looked at her and we all continued to step out of the restaurant.

So being 7$ for 12 smaller then a 3 year olds index finger is just not worth it sorry. It's nothing to go outta your way for but it's there if you want different foods. Keep in mind there are a lot of Filipino restaurants in Vegas.",iYT-uAL8_RKvVRIR4wThQg,2,1,3,J5AndYeik6P8qDUfW3-1YQ
2368463,2017-08-19,0,xqbvqZHNyj2qExHdizzd0w,"So, I live in the Northeast and am pretty much the only token Asian in my rural community. With a Caucasian husband and the nearest (read: only) Asian market almost an hour's drive away, I don't often get the opportunity to eat rice or my favorite Filipino food. Of course I pig the hell out when I visit my family in Vegas! I arrived on Wednesday earlier this week, and my mother and sister brought me to this place.

Service was quick and friendly, and the location seemed to have lots of space and seating. Cost was reasonable, considering we ordered tons of food. We ended up ordering lumpia shanghai, torta, dinuguan, tosilog, kare kare, and daing. Entrees weren't humongous, but they were of a decent serving size that we were able to share and eat family style. I thought the food was really good, with the except of the torta, but that was my mistake. In my head I really wanted fried torta, (feggplant dipped in egg and fried), but I didn't read the description carefully and ended up getting steamed eggplant with chopped tomatoes, onions, and mango. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it was a dish that this girl could manage at home in the boondocks. Like I said, if I'm going to eat Filipino food, it better be something I don't know how to cook or get easily!

Aside from the torta, everything tasted great. I think the shining dish was the dinuguan--really fresh and flavorful. The reason I gave this place 4 stars was because there were so many flies! Was it meant to be part of the atmosphere? Going for the authentic Filipino food stand feel? I don't know, but having to swat at flies every two seconds wasn't the dining experience I wanted to have while enjoying my Filipino food.",-f0hp6yAYrcqxTNnPXzmyA,1,0,4,1d1hE9Bn1yyAQouLSHu6ow

Ok so EVERY time I've gone my food is never fresh and hot. 
The kare kare is always cold! Wth???? It's so sad because it'd be amazing if it was actually hot!
The chicken adobo is super greasy and just bleh.
I had some other beef stew dish and man, the potatoes were so old! They were squishy and not cooked and old! The bell peppers were not cooked and the beef was like mush. Like it was all just old and reheated. 
The fried chicken skin and lechon kawali are ok. They should be since they're just deep fried....
The service just sucks. 
Their kutsinta is very blah. The garlic peanuts are good.

2505715,2015-04-09,11,xqbvqZHNyj2qExHdizzd0w,"I'm always up for trying new restaurants especially in Vegas! This place was recommended to us by my aunt and uncle and I was excited to try out.

The menu here consists of various appetizers (ranging in prices from $5.99 to $12.99 and consisting of favorites such as lumpiang shanghai, chicaron bulaklak to non-traditional shrimp tempura and fish balls), noodles (all priced at $7.99 and include bihon, canton, miki, malabon and spaghetti) and beef, pork, seafood and vegetable dishes ($6.99 to $12.99 in price).

My party ordered a lot of seafood dishes and I am not a seafood eater so my review will mostly be on the non-seafood dishes that I tried. 

I first tried the kare kare. Their oxtail kare kare is $12.99 and comes with oxtail cooked in creamy peanut sauce with beef tripe and veggies. The dish was small in size for $12.99! I liked that there were a good mix of veggies and the oxtail was pretty good as well but there seemed to just not be a lot in this dish. The portion size was small for the price. 

The other dish I got try was a little bit of the shrimp tempura. I  tried the veggies from the shrimp tempura and was fond of the batter that they had. It was slightly on the sweet side. This dish was also $12.99. 

Lastly I got to try was the pork binaggongan with eggplant. This is lechon kawali sauteed in shrimp paste topped with fried talong. I normally don't eat shrimp paste but decided to just try this a little bit and it wasn't bad. The shrimp paste was not too strong in flavor and the lechon kawali was nice and crispy. 

Tastewise the food was good but i think the dishes were fairly small for the prices. This place is kinda pricey and I would've expected a more generous portion. 

As for drinks, I chose to get a sago gulaman. Theri sago gulaman came with a lot of different ingredients. It had baby sago and red and green gulaman. It was a very pretty drink with a decent amount of sago and gulaman but needed to be more sweet. It was a little on the bland side.

Kathy helped us when we arrived.  She answered all of our questions the best she could.  Even speaking to her on the phone to add more food later on, she was very helpful and efficient.  

We ordered 3 trays of everything.

Tonkatsu: their special version of Lechon Kawali.  Probably the best lechon Kawali-ish that we've ever had.  It stays crunchy even hours later.  It was a hit.

Chicken curry: flavorful and popular at our party.  People kept asking who cooked it.

Inihaw pork: I'm guessing they're ilocano, because this reminded me of how my ilocano family would serve Inihaw pork.  Cut in chunks and mixed with tomatoes and onions.  Pretty good but wished they cut the meat smaller.

Pork Menudo: really good.  Everyone liked it.

Lechon: yes, a whole roasted pig.  We were apprehensive about ordering a lechon during this party because all the other lechons  we've ordered in town have been nasty.  Since it was a special occasion, we pretty much bought it to make our food presentation better lol.  Luckily, it tasted really good.  Didn't have that nasty, pig smell.  Skin  was super crunchy and the meat was tender and flavorful.  

Overall, I'd have to say they earned their 5 stars from me.  I hope to have the same great experience next time.  Wish they were closer to southern highlands.",LgFDWZTLi1w9OGi5BtKORg,5,0,5,viSUrYvM1KewEao4ygPZJQ

We arrived a little before 9pm and I asked what time they close, the server said 10pm. Ok, an hour is good. I specifically said party of 6 and the hostess (with no eye contact) led us to a table in the middle of the restaurant. Instead, I requested to be seated in the corner somewhere where my family and I can freely talk and catch up. There was only one other family there but still, this is what I prefer. We sat down, at a table perfect for 6 and she asks if it's ok that she doesn't put the tables together. I'm ok with that, since our table could accommodate all of us. Then when my other 2 sons arrived and sat down, she asked if there were 14 of us, I said no, there's 6...She then comments, under her breath, ""kanina pako dito"" not finishing her sentence. I heard this but decided to ignore her cause I don't want anyone spitting on our food. I did feel like getting up though and leaving but it was late and we were hungry.  Minus stars for that already. Your staff is what people see when they first enter your establishment. Your first impression to which she has failed you. You guys on Yelp should already know that I'm not picky, I'm fair and reasonable. But I expect service with a smile and some eye contact, that's pretty easy right? 

The server on the other hand had a better personality. He took our orders, made suggestions and was quick getting our food out. We really tried to enjoy our dinner but it just wasn't working out. 

1. Egg rolls- I only ordered 1 but when my 2 other boys arrived they were all gone so I ordered another one. Egg rolls are egg rolls but I would not be craving for theirs. 
2. Vegetable lumpia- my son who's enjoyed every vegetable lumpia he has ever tasted made a comment that the vegetable cuts were too big. He had one and he was done. When usually, he eats them all. 
3. House special fried rice- it was nothing special 
4. Sizzling Sisig- my 11 year old ordered this thing I called the splattering Sisig. Why? It went straight for my son's eye. That plate was way too hot. 

Look, I'm gonna cut this short. We ordered okoy, Bicol express, kare-kare, tocilog and bulalo. Our total was $121. My boys can eat, our whole family can. But we just didn't enjoy the food here. I asked for a to-go box and the hostess came up and just set it on the table. No offer to box up our left overs even from the server. Wow, the food wasn't that good and the service was even worse.

So we waited to get our food, then one of our orders was the pinakbet. Well, a friend of mine and my mom said that as they took a bite of the calabasa (squash), they noticed that it was spoiled. So we asked the waitress, that the pinakbet was spoiled, so she took it back to the kitchen. Then the manager came out, and asked what was the problem, and to mention she didn't apologize first of all. We then told her that the pinakbet was spoiled. She then defensively stated that everyone orders it and they didn't have any problems. Then my mom said, it's the calabasa, and you need to try what you served us. So the manager goes back into the kitchen, and comes back out. Her excuse was that it was accidentally mixed with something else. Again no apologies, she started to walk away, we told her that to just take it off our bill since the last dish haven't even arrived yet.

We ordered a side of shanghai egg rolls which came with a side of sweet and sour sauce.  These came out fast and piping hot.  They were good.

The lunch special I ordered came with two entrees and a scoop of white rice.  We tried their pork adobo and 'lechon kawali' (fried pork belly).    The adobo was delicious, a great balance of soy sauce and vinegar.  Nothing overpowering, and the meat was very tender.

The lechon kawali was amazing.  They really pack the serving bowl with the pork belly so you are getting a lot for your money.   

This by itself could have been enough for my wife and I, but I wanted to try the shrimp-paste (bagoong) fried rice.  This did not really compare to the flavor you get from the version at Goldilocks' filipino restaurant but it was ok.  I poured the adobo broth and it gave it a really good flavor! =)  The fried rice comes with chopped tomatoes, chopped mangoes, and pork pieces mixed in.

We ordered the pork tonkatsu, binagoong fried rice, fried bangus, crispy pata, and friend chicken skins (yes, I said fried chicken skins). All in all, the food was really good.

-The pork tonkatsu was tasty and moist. Not tough at all. 
-The crispy pata was really good, wasn't over fried, and had a lot of meat on it (bonus points). I'd go so far as to say it's the best crispy pata I've had here in Vegas.  
-The binagoong fried rice was just okay. I was expecting a lot more flavor. 
-The fried chicken skins were good, but I could only eat a few of those at a time because they were so high in fat and cholesterol. My body was literally screaming at me to stop eating them. 
-I didn't eat any of the fried bangus, but the people who did said it was good.

3075203,2018-05-17,0,xqbvqZHNyj2qExHdizzd0w,I ordered takeout from D'Pinoy Joint on a Thursday afternoon. The first time I called nobody answered but they picked up the second time I called. I never really eat Filipino food but a handful of times at my friends house. We ordered a little bit of everything to try everything. We ordered the pancit bihon! A 10! So yummy I would order this again and again. Next we ordered the Shanghai lumpia with ground meat and it was a 10! Last we ordered the lunch special of the chicken adobo. It was very salty and had a strong flavor. I didn't like how the chicken skin was still on there it freaked me out. I would give it a 7. Taste is awesome but texture not so much. We also ordered the melon drinks with melon shavings inside the drink. I really liked our experience and would definitely be returning for the pancit!,qEjm0_ivRn8WlfJipeFAgg,0,0,4,ebBh0b81NPKKfViknHBJjw

The waitress was so aloof and didn't even notice that we were dissatisfied when we told her not to box up this dish.  What's worse is that they declined to remove this item from our bill, considering this our fifth or sixth visit to this place.

I recommend  the following:
1.okoy
2. Fish balls
3. Adobo rice
4. Binagoong rice
5. Sisig na bangus
6. Lomi. 

Tried and wasn't impressed with their:
1. Dinuguan
2. Letchon kawali
3. Beef stik(steak?) The one with onions
4. Pinakbet. 

The one I recommended are one of the best I have tasted, and have ordered them more than once and the flavor has always been on the spot. However- the 3 star is not about the flavor, it's for the poor customer service.

Everytime we come here we only always few interactions with the servers and the one over the counter. Servers seems to not care about the customers, they just want to deliver the food and that's it.

A thing we should try to avoid being a culture like this is PLEASE DON'T WASTE FOOD.  Leftovers for the next day.  Now that's one thing I learned not to be picky about.  As I've also learned the flavors sink in.  And how does it do with baked fish?  Oh eat that right away!  Don't want your fridge to be stenched.

Food was good though.  My auntie makes the best dinuguan however.  Their kare kare was A+.  Between the two, I'd play safe and introduce the peanut butter stew to newcomers.  Now if you've got a Chef Andrew Zimmern appetite, I'll dare you on the dinuguan.  For you fishy health eaters, go with the baked fish.  Be prepared to learn and eat with your hands Filipino style.  Fish is a kamayan food in our culture.

I have to say walking in we got a few stares too many.  I have heard that if I were to ever visit the Philippines, people will know I'm foreign by sight, scent, and attire.  Well we're not in the Philippines!!!  This is Vegas there are many Filipinos here.  Why did it still happen?!  One thing I can't stand is feeling uncomfortable while dining.

Adobo fried rice - I love adobo fried rice, but I was so disappointed, the meat was shredded so much I could barely taste it, there was so much oil left on the plate after and it didn't really have flavor!

Cons: Parking is a bit funky since they are at the end of the building

I recommend: Pancit bihon, binagoongan (bagoong) fried rice, beef bulalo (soft beef soup), melon juice

I've just moved to Las Vegas so I'm on the hunt for Filipino food after leaving my favorite place in San Diego behind. I chose this place because they have a website with their menu online! I'm hoping that they will add pictures to every menu item on their website so that my mom and I can let our stomachs and eyes order for us :). We called in our order and drove about 20 minutes to the restaurant. We showed up the day before their Grand Opening so we missed the restaurant when we drove down the road (they have a nice bright sign now though, so you can't miss it)! We were promptly greeted and our food was brought out right away. 

My mom loves to talk so we enjoyed a fun conversation with everyone. They got us to try the melon juice and halo halo and I'm glad they did. The melon juice is like a shredded melon boba :). They add shaved ice to melon juice with shredded melon at the bottom. Super yummy- especially on a hot day. My mom and I couldn't agree on the halo halo though. I like simple halo halo while my mom loves ""loaded"" halo halo with tons of stuff (like the cup is full of beans and jellies and fruit) and D'Pinoy's halo halo is definitely more simple (maybe about a quarter full). I loved it but I'm sure my mom will ask for more fixings in hers next time. The Philippines might seem like a small country but there are many regional differences. Some people just prefer things a certain way because of the region they grew up in. 

We ordered several things including lumpiang shanghai, fried bangus (milkfish), beef kaldereta, chicken curry, pancit bihon, binagoongan fried rice, and beef bulalo. I loved their pancit but my mom didn't care for the tofu in it so I took it all :). The chicken curry has bones but the chicken is very soft and will fall right off it. The beef in the beef bulalo is super soft and absolutely delicious. The binagoongan rice wasn't what I was expecting (it has mangoes and tomatoes on the side- never seen that before) but it was absolutely delicious. Very unique and very tasty! Everything was very good, very soft, and cooked very well. 

Unfortunately, we were missing one thing in our order and didn't notice until we got home (oops)! The place isn't that close to us so my mom called back and told them what happened. They were very apologetic and promised to make it right when we return. And we WILL return! I want to try the pork tonkatsu, dinuguan, sinigaang, and the sizzling bistek!

Wife ordered pork and I got fish and a couple of sides.  We have been here before and taken to go with minimal issues but today.  WHOA BUDDY!!
1) I will compliment the food as the fish even for a Sunday was really fresh and meaty and moist.  Just had to take out the bones but it is what it is.  The pork belly was fine and quite a lot of it as needed a box to take the leftovers home.  
2) Service-- Not only EPIC but TOTAL FAIL!!  Walked in and the (host) did not even smile at us but at least offered to let us pick our own table.  Not once even when seated did we get a smile from her.  Maybe having to work on Sunday sucks but we all do that in Las Vegas one way or another.  Multiple times did my wife have to raise her arm up to get attention and she even noticed that the guy in the cooking area tapped a waitress with the impression of *Hey,  they are calling you over*.  The table next to us with a large group had to do the same thing.  She even had to get up once to go get them to give us an extra plate so I had something to put my bones on.  Talk about unfriendly service.  I knew that once I gave my card over to pay,  this was going to take another 20 minutes to get done so I went up front and signed off everything.  I had to actually tell the cashier/hostess ""Excuse me."" because she was so engrossed in watching the TV that she did not even notice me standing there trying to hand her the check.  

Oh,  and did I mention the numerous flies that kept buzzing around our dinner.  I know that sometimes they get in through the front door and that is fine but I counted at least 3 by the window I had to close to try to trap them(pointless but at least better than nothing).

4271885,2015-07-29,3,xqbvqZHNyj2qExHdizzd0w,"Have I found a Filipino restaurant that I'm finally excited about?! Shockingly, yes!!

I grew up eating traditional home made Filipino food, so I definitely know what authentic is. Now that I'm older and live no where near my mom or my aunt, I crave the dishes I grew up eating. I'm always hesitant to eat Filipino food at restaurants because it just doesn't taste the same. Surprisingly, my non-Filipino BF was the one who found this joint and took me here. And I'm glad he did.

They have a large menu with pork, seafood, chicken, beef and pancit dishes. They even have the breakfast 'silog plates that Filipinos know about. Here's some of the things we've tried so far:

Lumpiang Shanghai: little fried egg rolls that are a staple to the Filipino culture. Crispy and freshly fried!! 5/5

Tortang talong: grilled eggplant omelette. Just like my mom used to make! A little oily, but it was rich and tasty. 5/5!!!!!!

Crispy Pata: deep fried pigs feet. This is why Filipinos have high blood pressure. It's crispy and full of that fatty flavor that we love. 5/5

Pancit palabok: a little too much sauce for my liking, but still had that good smokey flavor and the little crunchy pieces of chicharron. 3.5/5

Sizzling Pork Sisig: pieces of pork belly and pork mask sautéed with onion, sweet peppers and jalapeños topped with a cracked egg. I usually don't opt for sisig, but this was full of the flavor and the egg added a richer flavor. 4/5

Oxtail Kare Kare: oxtails simmered in peanut sauce with tripe and vegetables. Kare Kare is my favorite dish of all time, so I was a little underwhelmed. It wasn't peanut-ey enough for me. But I liked that they put the vegetables on top so they wouldn't get mushy. 2.5/5

I've been satisfied with what we've tried. This definitely fulfills that Filipino food craving. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,12,5,4,zhdqCOKxxTwvsM2n9gT8ZA

When you first walk in, the joint really makes you feel like you're in a restaurant in the Philippines. We waited a little bit but then the waitress came over and seated us. They quickly took our drink order and said she would be back to take our order.

The wait time from when you place your order to when you actually receive your food is about 45min or so. Not that this is the waitress' fault or anything. They just opened and are severely understaffed. These girls were trying as hard as possible but with only 2 of them running EVERYTHING, they could only do so much. We were not the only ones who had this issue as some people appeared irritated and were complaining to each other. When the food finally did come out, this is what we thought:

Lumpiang Shanghai: They were over fried and lacked filling. I think we would prefer to have less of them for more filling and flavor.  Seasoning was a little bit low as well.

Crispy Chicken Skins: These weren't all too bad. A good unhealthy treat that came out after our entres did. Same with the lumpiang(we ordered them as appetizers).

Pancit Bihon: They messed up this order for me and gave me a combination of noodles instead. No big deal but it wouldn't have made a difference. I know pancit is supposed to be oily but no flavor on meat or noodles. I had to add salt and siracha in order to taste something,

Combination Plate: This wasn't horrible actually. We got the chicken adobo lechon kawali served with rice. Tasty but the lechon was kinda tough to eat. Too hard actually.

I wanna say that this bad service was only due to the staff being overwhelmed and that if I come back in a couple months or so, they will have figured things out and gotten their flavors in order. Here's to crossing my fingers!!!",j97PtHlFcx7jhmV_1eQdtw,3,0,2,eeBf3bVLookZDq1jjBHfDg

Ordered 3 items I was interested in ordering for catering to share. 

Pork Tonkatsu - basically lechon kawali like...yet there is also lechon kawali on the menu so I wonder what the difference is. Either way, the pork was tender and had pretty crispy, but not too crisp it's hard, skin. Very solid stuff. 

Miki Bihon was very close to how I would make it at home. Good flavor and very generous portion that didn't skimp on meat and veggies so every bite had a bit of everything. 

Lumpia shanghai was pretty decent. They were about 2 bite sized and came with a dozen in a order. Very crispy, hot and not greasy. 

The place had a steady flow of customers and was pleased that things came out pretty fast, fresh and hot. Filipino cuisine isn't really the best known for speed and tend to be slow service typically. The server we had was a younger guy and he was friendly and checked on us pretty well. 

I'm not normally one to be really into a Filipino place, but not only was it good, I think what made is slightly better was their style of cooking seems closest to what I'm used to (my mom is from the Quezon region) than any other place I've had so far. I appreciate all regions, but theres something more satisfying when it's closer to Lola/Nanay cooking. Filipino food is one of my fiances least favorite Asian foods to eat out only because he hasn't had very many good ones, but he really liked this too. 

We will be coming back soon and if it's consistent to boot then it may be the only Filipino place I'll be going to on a regular. I think I will be hitting them up for catering trays.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,6,4,GhaHMq2nYTQx0wOmp8zcbQ

We were advised to place our orders 2 hours in advance (via telephone) for our party of 10.  When we were seated at our reservation time, we didn't have to wait long for food. It was fresh and served at a good temperature. 
We ordered a lot of food, including: pancit, pancit palabok, lechon kawali, BBQ sticks, Kare Kare, binagoongan crispy pata with eggplant, and pinakbet. All tasted fine, but of course I've had better versions elsewhere. The stand out dish was the binagoongan crispy pata with eggplant. It is a deep fried pork leg that is super crispy and fatty. The sauce is really tasty, it is bagoong, a salty shrimp paste. Definitely, not your typical everyday Filipino cuisine. This cholesterol, sodium filled dish is best saved for special occasions. 
I was most excited for their halo halo after I saw photogenic photos of it on social media. I was disappointed in overall flavor and presentation. I've had better with various versions of halo halo within Seafood City. 
Overall observation, many diners there were part of tables 6+ and even there is a separate room for overflow/party use. The service is pretty good too.

Surprisingly unknown to two Filipino friends and one Chef who fancies the cuisine, while another alternatively touted the restaurant at 6820 West Flamingo Road as one of the best in town, it was with five friends and their children that a long table was filled in D'Pinoy Joint at noon on Saturday, the experience both hit and miss as relates to everything from the environment to service and food.

Owned by immigrants to a city known for one of the most rapidly growing Filipino populations in the United States, their goal to serve authentic tastes of native cuisine to those familiar and first-timers alike, D'Pinoy Joint features a sizable menu chock-a-block filled with Pork and other meaty options, most portions appropriate for sharing with a banquet space offered for those hosting parties up to sixty or more next door.

Oddly decorated to say the least, half of the restaurant featuring scenes of daily life or traditional dance in the Philippines while the rest is a mish-mash of aquarium fish, motivational posters and spiritual things, it was several minutes after seating that service was eventually flagged down for ordering, a total of twelve menu items selected and delivered with what must have been at least six cups of rice.

Certainly not fine dining, plates dropped off without descriptions and water glasses more frequently empty than not, lunch began with a duo of appetizers appropriately delivered before several larger options, the crispy Lumpaing and spongy Fish Balls each served scalding hot from the fryer with sidecars of Sweet & Sour Sauce, both readily sharable amongst the group though neither were anything different from what might be found at any local Dim Sum spot.

Making the mistake of adding un-fried $5.99 Garlic Rice to the complimentary mounds of white stuff, the only difference a shake of dehydrated powder and a teaspoon of toasted Cloves, larger plates began to arrive fast and furious just as appetizers were finished,  the Tortang Talong far more flaccid than one might expect with a substantial coat of oil while the Eggplant served beneath a hunk of deep fried Pork Hock was substantially more delicious amidst thinly sliced Jalapenos and a thick smear of funky Shrimp Paste.

A bit surprised at how flavorless the Mongo Guisado was, particularly as the smell was particularly off-putting to more than one at the table, far better bites were found in the Sizzling Pork Sisig and plate of thinly sliced Beef Chuck, each emitting an aromatic plume of steam on arrival while the Kare-Kare was easily the best plate on the table with bone-in bits of Oxtail juxtaposing soft Beef Stomach in a Creamy Peanut Sauce.

Ready to drop a bill without suggesting dessert, the wait staff seemingly ready to be rid of patrons at 1:30pm even though the room was less than 1/6 full, it was with Ube Halaya ""sold out,"" or not yet delivered, that three alternatives were selected, the Halo-Halo a typically bizarre mash-up of crushed Ice, Fruit and starches while the Mais Con Yelo and Puto Bumbong were far more attention-grabbing, the former essentially a Cream Corn Sundae served as a Shake while the latter was something like Taffy in its texture beneath the sweet/savory juxtaposition of Coconut, Granulated Sugar and toasted Sesame Seeds.

Overlooking the somewhat-expected service issues and décor that seems oddly out-of-place, D'Pinoy Joint offers a good look at Filipino cooking in an environment built for sharing, the majority of the food quite good and said by respected sources to be relatively authentic to the Island's traditional cuisine.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,9,3,IdWCrv4yRdHR9w6f0obH9Q

5319748,2016-05-07,8,xqbvqZHNyj2qExHdizzd0w,"Filipino food isn't the healthiest thing you could eat but is it good? Yes! I'm half-Filipino so, I think I have the right to be a Filipino food snob. My mom, lola (grandma), and my titas (aunties by blood or my mom's friends) were all cooking machines with an arsenal of fresh ingredients, serving Pinoy dishes at the rate of 5 dishes per minute. Their main goal in life is to feed everyone...all the time! We have family in Manila that frown upon karaoke which is why you won't hear me on the Magic Mic - not that you would want to anyway! LOL.

If I'll have heart disease/ diabetes (which are common among Filipinos), it better be worth it. They have lechon kawali, crispy pata, kare-kare, lumpia, lumpiang Shanghai, garlic rice, adobo, halo-halo, different kinds of pancit, laing, toci/tapsi/longsi-log, etc. People have complained about the lack of circulation and the heat in this place - something I cannot relate to since my family gets me food to-go for me. 

Lechon Kawali:
Fried pork belly. It's a bit confusing how they have ""tonkatsu (fried pork belly)"" on their menu - this might have been a lost in translation moment. The skin is crisp and simply delicious. I didn't like the sauce it came with which I think is made in house. I prefer Mang Tomas. 3.5/5

Lumpiang Shanghai:
Fried egg roll with meat and veggies. This is one of the Filipino party staples. You dip  it in sweet and sour sauce and hear the crunch as you chomp on lumpia. Their version is not greasy at all which is an absolutely good thing. 4.5/5

Chicken Adobo:
I can only eat my mom's adobo. She's the only one who makes it the way I like it. People get butthurt when I don't like their version but oh, well...
We ordered this for my friend who does not eat pork. However, they gave us pork adobo. My friend was left hangry and bad times were had by all. 1/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,8,9,3,rubtThUzkt4N2bRA5hhI1A

The food was pretty good, too. The presentation of the food is what made it even more appetizing. It reminded me of my Tita's cooking every time we would have a potluck. I had the sizzling bistek and the kare-kare.

The bistek was so good. It was perfectly marinated (but could use a little kalamansi) and had the perfect tenderness to it. It's the perfect pairing with the caramelized onions and steamed rice. The kare-kare was cooked perfectly, too. The meat was so tender and slid off the bone with the tripe not being too rubbery, and the gulay (veggies) had the perfect crunch and green color to it, so I know it's fresh and not overcooked. It also had the creamy peanut-buttery taste to it, just like a classic kare-kare dish should have.

We had no intention of eating or drinking it here just did not want to leave it in the heat out in the car. I guess if I stuffed it in my purse or bag they would not make it a point of coming to our table to charge us for bringing it into their restaurant even if we did not open it or drink it. They told us they would charge 0.50 each for the items we brought in even though we did not open any of it. We were surprised but accepted the fee. My son later asked for a cup of ice and at first they refused then later return with the ice in a soup bowl?  Seriously?? Poor customer service and greed at its best. Never mind that we purchased a large meal for three, they still needed to profit off a bottle of unopened coke I purchased earlier from a gas station. Your service sucked and your food was NOT worth it. Left a bad taste and bad first impression!
