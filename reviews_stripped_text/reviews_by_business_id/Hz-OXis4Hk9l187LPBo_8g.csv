The guy saw me finally, but stopped along the way to have a conversation with someone in the back. He finally got to the counter, I ordered my salad, paid and waited about 5 minutes. I reviewed my receipt and it said I ordered a chicken Cesar salad when in fact I ordered the BBQ chicken salad. So when my name was called I confirmed the correct salad the gal grabbed my receipt and explained they don't have a button for the salad. Ummm... Okay, a simple yes we made the BBQ salad would have been more than enough. I opened my salad to find bacon , I personally don't eat pork so picked it off which took off almost all the BBQ sauce. The salad did not have a description, and BBQ ranch salads are my favorite so I know they don't normally come with bacon otherwise I would have asked for no bacon.

They had combo meals which include a sandwich, chips and a drink. You can customize your sandwich by picking out the type of bread. 

I decided to go with the turkey bacon sandwich on wheat bread, regular potato chips and a small raspberry iced tea. After we place our order, she calls you by name. She ended up getting my hubby's name. The cashier gave us our chips and drinks. All we ended up waiting for was the sandwiches. 

We grab a booth and waited. Our sandwiches took only 10 minutes to make before we got them. As I opened up my sandwich, I thought the bread was interesting. It tasted and looked more like a cross between a biscuit and English muffin. It was thick like a biscuit but crunchy on the outside. It was filled with turkey, bacon, cheese, tomato, mayonnaise and shredded lettuce. I didn't like the shredded lettuce because it kept falling out of my sandwich. It definitely was good. Very filling. The chips were similar to lay's potato chips. I enjoyed drinking my raspberry iced tea. Food overall was okay.

Onto the food: I ate the breakfast quesadilla with sausage. The tortilla was a bit too flaky and broke too easily when I tried eating it. Sausage was a bit bland so I'd switch to a different add on next time. The quesadilla itself was large so worth the price I paid. 

Service was unimpressive. Cashier seemed like she was in a bad mood and it took them close to 10 minutes to get the food made. I categorize this place as borderline fast food so close to 10 minutes is pretty slow.",mjl4t9a5UVBdHmMZ2MrTuQ,1,0,3,-onP2evKPmdOYURawpZ4hw

5108314,2018-05-01,1,Hz-OXis4Hk9l187LPBo_8g,"I absolutely love Schlotzsky's. My office mate back in Rochester, MN introduced me to this fast food place years ago. The problem was that the closest one to us was in Apple Valley, an hour away and just shy of Minneapolis. We did a quick trip up there and I was in heaven.

Since then, I get excited when I see a Schlotzsky's. I bought an original sandwich on my plane ride home from Denver. This time, I was thrilled to find it in the food court at Excalibur.

I tend to get the original sandwich, which is like a kicked-up assorted sub, but much better. It has lean ham, salami, lettuce, red onion, black olives, three different cheeses, and a special sauce that is so good. I don't normally love olives, but will eat them when I get this sandwich. This detail also speaks volumes! I also love the French dip, which steers you away from salami and gives you yummy roast beef. The kicker is the pretzel bun that is perfect.

My friend was sitting down and resting her feet. I placed my order and waited patiently. I'd say about five minutes later, I got my meal. I brought it to the table and sat down to eat.

My original sandwich was yummy. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. I washed it down with a fountain drink.

I'd definitely come back to get my sandwich fix.

Schlotzsky's has always been a family tradition and we bring their food home to California for the whole family. The food has always been amazing, of course we had never tried this location. The management and service was so terrible. They give Schlotzsky's a bad name. They messed up on our order 3 separate times. On our way back to California we stopped in Barstow and quadruple checked our order and noticed that they had messed up again.

First off, I don't believe that anyone should have to check their order even once. However, my fiance and I always check at least once. By the third time I think any competent person should have gotten the order right. Fortunately I will give one manager Bahmin props he did refund us for one sandwich that was never given to us.
