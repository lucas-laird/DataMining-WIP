The music was insanely loud for the small amount of people in the establishment. The portions were to small in my opinion. The flavor of the food was really good. One thing is they turned the lights off completely & the only viewing light to eat was DJ lights which I didn't like. The decorations were nice around the place. The service of our waitress was excellent as well. This place is great for people who like drinking beer. They have many options of drink mixes.,JL7dtBmlpeaYqaR1io8A8A,1,0,3,6yuYAK2sNnX0IZPfIPM4kg

Filth, rodents, bugs, rotting food, and almost anything you could imagine. They just featured on Tv as one of the filthiest places they've ever seen.",Wui7Qobwx-HpOyA8YExT8g,1,0,1,jM36vgDDt3bNK1CbIFdiaQ

Definitely the service was good, she was very attentive and friendly and the food was not bad for the price we paid.   

They have lunch specials for $6.99 that come with rice and beans.  The price is not bad for the amount of food that you get.   

I wasn't a fan of the chips that came with salsa.   I love coming to places where the chips are freshly made and these tasted like store bought (which nothing is wrong with that, but I love the authentic fresh chips) 

If I were to come back I would definitely come back for the mangonada.   I love mangos and add tequila ... it's a win win for me!",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,2,3,4,N0F7gVAXeWjF9p5tNvYr3Q
