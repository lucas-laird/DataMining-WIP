273789,2011-11-10,0,KuZJcLIe3r0zO0x5TlmsKw,i like the 99cent Wednesday chicken taco special. it's a very authentic experience to me. if you are a pretentious kind of person you won't like it here - better stick with high end restaurants and pay a lot more - being pretentious comes with a price.,CtKVUMeZq4AgQ1EDUSaO9w,0,0,3,zY6FqXNKYp45yqFJ0xWxaQ

The last three visits sucked. The carnitas were hacked up, dried up, hard, greasy, and had that clear look that meat gets after it's overcooked and then dries out on the counter. I guess it's needless to say, the meat was flavorless as well. The adobada was hard, greasy, and hacked into tiny, tasteless granules of meat. The rice was dry. The beans were so dry, you had to scrape the top off to get the bottom bland portion.

There used to be two men behind the counter (one very handsome : )) that did an exceptional job with the food. They were friendly and humorous as well.

The two women that I had seen on my last three visits were just and dry and bland as the pitiful food...They knew that they were passing off crap. I'd have to agree with Nick R. on this one.

They can be a little stingy with the guacamole but what Roberto's isn't? My only complaint is the service and wait times. I wouldnt recommend you go out of your way for this one but it's nice to have in the neighborhood for those tired nights.",1JNqTTHm6m-4TcM6rL9vrw,1,0,3,q47RdfWrNVjrIKrCc6aBtA

It seemed kind of dirty which I unwisely ignored initially...but then I got my burrito which tasted kind of dirty if that makes sense.  Best word to describe this place is sloppy.  The food isn't fresh nor are the salsas...overall a big dissapointment b/c I saw this place all over Vegas for weeks and I was like hmmm i gotta try that before I leave it MUST be good..unfortunately NOT...oh yeah and it made my bf sick so we def won't be back...  :(,BBUQCUL0S9XeD5xqUOVp4A,1,1,1,Ze3J5KFXlnbOrTWPx1snIA
1833768,2018-02-28,0,KuZJcLIe3r0zO0x5TlmsKw,"I love me some Roberto's. Their rolled tacos are delish! Especially covered in cheese, sour cream, and guac! The chicken and beef are equally as good, although I may like the beef a bit more. Their taco salad is super yummy, but the juices of the meat tend to make the bottom of the taco shell bowl a little TOO soggy, which is a bummer. The quesadillas are yummy too, especially with a side of rice and beans. I gave this location a 4 cause they tend to be out of something almost every time I go, but that doesn't take away from the deliciousness of their food.",FTjIHMSeXJDRTO0QHOoTiw,0,0,4,Cuyq24Dow9IXvJxNHry79g

Alejandra (at least that's what she said her name was) should NOT, under any circumstance be in any area involving customer service. She is extremely rude and obviously does not know or hasn't been trained properly in resolving  simple customer issues. I understand that maybe no one within this company cares that they lose my business, after all it's just one customer. It's just a shame that one person can ruin what I assume the original owners worked so hard to accomplish.",9wcRWOCi7aTqzR8d-7r4jQ,0,0,1,u0OR4PX0mxrYZ1PalPulvg

Roberto's used to be my go to late night eats b/c it's right down the street from my house and the price wasn't too bad for a huevos rancheros plate.  But, the quality has dipped a bit a couple of months ago but, somehow, I keep coming back hoping that maybe they would magically improve like in the beginning.  But, it's the same everytime.  The only thing I like about this Roberto's is that they usually get my order right and the workers are nice, but it still pushing me over to Rivas for some better eat and the refillable fountain drink machine.",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,0,0,2,NAeKroXoZn3pRU8lDzUxAQ

Don't be alarmed by the bullet-proof glass behind the counter, the neighborhood may not be the best, but the staff are always friendly and the food hits the spot.

What I like about the carne asada fries here is that the fries and cooked perfectly!  I took an order to go and usually fries get soggy by the time I get home.  The fries were so crispy and delicious despite the mound of sour cream, guacamole, salsa, carne asada, and cheese that was piled on top.  I devoured the whole thing and every last bite was just still as good as the first, with that nice crunch.  

Another thing that I like about this location is that they have the salsa pre-filled in little cups so you just have to tell them the amount you want before they give you your order.",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,5,4,4,TL_ALuvdNdzseymLxoSv1w

We can always count on a delicious Super Nacho to hit the spot. The staff knows us and know how we like our Super Nachos and NEVER give us any problems with our unusual requests! Kind of bummed they charge for the Horchata refills now but it's all good. It's understandable since people like my family can down like 3-4 cups each in one sitting.
