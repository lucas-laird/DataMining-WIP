All you can eat salad, soup and desserts for a little under ten bucks, seems fair to me. The soups and desserts are forgettable, but the salad ingredients are always fresh (and that's the main reason I go in the first place).

The place is seat-yourself... most of the time. Sometimes they get lunch rush'd, but they do the best job they can in these situations to get everyone into seats as quickly as possible --even at its busiest, I've rarely waited longer than a few seconds for them to find me a seat.",UYACF30806j2mfbB5vdmJA,0,0,4,UEmVfS26SQYxAMfV7aynag

This place has great salads selections and you can make your own too.  The soup selection is great too - Broccoli cheddar, New England Clam Chowder, Chicken noodle, Chicken and Lime, Cream of Mushroom, Chili and Tomato soup.. they had more but I don't remember them all.  Pasta salad was good but wasn't too many too choose from.  

Now for the not so great, pizza was soggy and inconsistent with some pieces no having any cheese. The toppings for the baked potato don't have the proper spoon to put them in the little cups causing me to get sour cream all over my fingers.  Muffins /cornbread not that great bland tasting.  The dessert is just frozen yogurt with toppings and puddings.

I really wanted to go recently for their chicken pot pie soup which actually did come with a biscuit. The soup was delicious except for those stupid peas. (sidenote, I HATE peas). Their pastas are never anything special. I feel like they have no flavor. I do wish they had the rosemary potato soup year round, though. 

I grab a ton of their wonton happiness salad. I think they used to add chicken to it, and they no longer do. I wish they would add wonton strips to their regular toppings. I do love their feta cheese, so I pile that on!

This location's soups however, looked crusted over as if they've been sitting still for a while. I find it very concerning that besides the fresh piece of pizza bread I got, that most of all the other food that should have been warm was completely cold! The salad bar is pretty comparable to the other location other than the fact it's hard to reach certain toppings due to their set up.

I only wish Sweet Tomatoes' other selections were as good.   The soup is severely hit-or-miss.  While I appreciate that they're creative (hello Chicken Dijon), generally the execution is poor. Dessert is always good, but, you can't really go wrong with warm brownies and soft serve.

I'd rate this location as the least preferable in Las Vegas.  It's smaller and has fewer pasta selections than Henderson or Best in the West.  It does have outdoor seating but it's generally unusable because: (1) It's too hot; and/or (2) It's too windy.

I really don't like how you're forced to pick out a salad before you pay(I was worried you couldn't go back to the salad bar, but you could so it's all good). The price is decent enough until you ask for a drink and you have to pay more than $10.
My favorite salad was the Chicken Wonton Salad, mostly because I'm a sucker for Asian-style salads. Once I was done with my salad, I hit up carb-city with the pizza bread and cornbread muffins, which pretty much totally negated the healthfulness of my salad, and that pizza bread's pretty damn addictive to boot. The soups are delicious though, I couldn't stop getting bowls of gumbo. 
The dessert section was boring to me, but you really shouldn't expect that much out of a soup and salad place to begin with.

Found a booth, placed my salad, and headed to the soups and pastas. The soup was very watery. Not the consistency of what I'm used to - not sure if this is a Sweet Tomatoes exclusive or if this Sweet Tomatoes just always has watery soup. Even the chili was watery... 
They also had focaccia - a pepperoni focaccia and some roasted veggie one with thyme - both good however the bottom was soggy.
Overall not a bad experience. There was some opportunity in execution of the food but I would go again...

When I go here I am in and out usually less than 40 minutes, because you pretty much just grab what you want and get down to business, no waiting to be served, and it's relatively small inside. So, if you want a quick but healthy meal, this is a great alternative.

Food is fresh and there is so many variety of toppings, you can't really go wrong and will make the prefect salad to your liking. I prefer to make my own, over their pre made selections. I always get a coupon before coming here. You can get them sent to your email, or they can easily be found online. 

I love their iced and green teas. Soups have good variety as well and hot food bar is always great but consist of lots of carbs...so I tend to make that very limited! It can get a little busy in there, and you feel like everyone is almost bumping into each other and can get a little hectic, so that is annoying sometimes. One time someone (an employee at that) did literally bump into me hard and I dropped a small plate of food. No bueno.

Other than that, sweet tomato is a great healthy and quick eatery.",P5neFGzLzxsvFLFEhxKx3w,0,0,4,0FEob-Cp4vCaHVMdLTN__w

There really isn't much to say about this place that hasn't already been said. It's a salad buffet joint. You start out by creating your own salad. All the fixins.

Then, you have a nice selection of soups. Something for the vegan and carnivore alike. There's also a potato bar.

My favorite section is the little pasta section where you can get some Mac n Cheese.

Nothing here is gourmet, so leave your fancy palates at home. 

Sweet Tomatoes is just a fun, chill place to have a meal. Simple. Fun. Fast. Also, this is the same chain as Souplantation. A joint I used to frequent when I lived in Los Angeles.

If you are one of those weirdos who likes to bring your diet to a restaurant, I suppose they can accommodate you. Pile some raw vegetables on your plate.

I'm always careful at a buffet to make sure that I watch what other people do. I guess that's because I'm in the food business. While there the other night, we were behind a family with several little children. I'm really glad that they were on the other side of the salad bar. Everything they touched should have been thrown away. They had their hands on every utensil they could possibly touch. Later on,  I observed one of the little girls picking food off the spoon and putting the spoon back into the macaroni and cheese  I informed the girl working behind the counter what had just happened. She did change the spoon but I'm not really sure what else that little girl touched. And who knows where her hands were before she touched. Couple minutes later a little kid licking his ice cream cone held his freshly licked ice cream cone over the sprinkles and proceeded to spoon sprinkles over his freshly licked cone. Disgusting! Now all those sprinkles that didn't stick to his freshly licked cone have his saliva on them. I also observed another child take silverware  out of the bin, touch  every end that you put in your mouth and then put it back into the silverware holder. What were the parents doing? Absolutely nothing. I can't imagine that they did not see any of this happening. They allowed their children to act like animals in a restaurant. Food was all over the place. I will hold Sweet Tomatoes responsible for not stepping in and doing something about all the things these children did wrong in a food establishment that is a buffet setting.

My carnivore soul might have been burning when I walked through those doors, but, an all I can eat salad bar, c'mon now!

I was thrilled to find a place like this as they're nearly extinct in Minnesota (except for some lunch places downtown, and Qcumbers I believe). The process was a bit confusing at first. I stepped in, and BAM, salad bar right there, no explanation of what to do, which was kind of strange. So, just grabbed a tray and some plates and went at it like a mad man.

Prepared salads, very good. The broccoli salad was a nice, prepared caesar salad was solid. The ingredients were fresh and a work was always changing things out, which was great to see. I did have a slight concern for the eggs. I'm not sure if it was just the prep method of what looked like grinded together, but, getting them onto the plate was like dropping a ball of mashed up, clingy tofu onto the plate. I'm thinking it was just because they weren't sliced, but, ground together... which was odd to say the least.

I grabbed a couple of the muffins, because, how could a man pass up a muffin? Blueberry was VERY good. Apple Cinnamon, totally forgettable. Flavor was a mix between cinnamon and baking powder. So, skip that.

Soups... blah. Tasteless. The chicken noodle was extremely blah. Others, nothing worth even noting, even the Thai Shrimp & Udon Noodle was a total miss and tasteless. 

Didn't go for the pastas or baked taters, wasn't feeling the starches. 

My last comment, because I'm a meat eating monster, very little protein options available for the salads. Some eggs and cheeses, and that's about it (soy beans maybe too, can't remember totally). But, I ended up taking some boiled chicken from the chicken noodle soup and throwing it in the salad, tossing with the red wine vinaigrette and enjoying it that way. 

Will that stop me from going back or wrecking a few plates of greens next time? Heck no!",SU-iAuGsoDnws0oFG4VO8A,0,0,3,IKA-wA459qPdRh7Bgl90ow

The selections were slim past the salad bar, most of the dishes were empty or close to empty and my biggest complaint is the ranch dressing,  It was thin, unflavorful and just plain awful, which completely ruined my salad.

They have other soups that changes throughout the season, good variety of creamy and brothy soups, there is a little something for everyone. 

I honestly just come for the soups... soups all day long!!",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,0,4,8o2sJDAJZ538xNYFurdFlw

I was rushed to get food for lunch but really wanted a salad and decided Sweet Tomatoes sounded like a good option. I'd never had the food here before but had heard good things.

I get to the restaurant and these two kids with their parents are being kind and holding the front doors open for me as they are entering, so I quickly hustle in behind them. I get behind this family and they take FOREVER in the line (they've got kids, I get it, I'm okay with waiting) but I wait for a long time. Finally it's my turn to pay. I'm getting the food to go so they hand me the to-go utensils, lid, and bag. I'm putting it all together and the employee tells me my price. I try to hand her my credit card and she says, ""We don't accept credit cards."" So I ask if they take debit cards. ""Nope, only cash."" So I asked her why they only accepted cash. ""Credit cards machine is down. It's posted on the door."" Now I followed the family in through the front doors and didn't see anything posted, no employee at the front was greeting anyone warning us that the machines were down. So I ask what I should do with my food and they just take it and throw it away. 

I go to the front door and yes there is a sign, and it's about 5x7 inches small. 

So now I've wasted a bunch of time waiting in line and have to get back to work. Missed lunch. So I'm pissed. Yes they had a warning sign, no I didn't see it and no one told anyone until you got to the register. 

So now the garbage really enjoyed my food, I'm starving, and I'll never attempt to go to this location again. 

Excellent customer service......",-ZNkP7z19VeIF0ykouI_RA,0,0,1,xSKzV1a2riBXoeUbp5uSIA

I am a carnivore and it did not bug me one bit that there are no meats here. I loaded up on Caesar Salad and Chinese Chicken Salad to start. Next the Broccoli and Cheese Soup was OUTSTANDING. I then tried the Chicken Albondigas and they were amazing too(only meat I saw). We were kind of in a rush so it's awesome that it is buffet style and you can get your own food and drink.

In addition to salad, you can supplement your veggies with soup, pastas, and desserts (think homey cobblers, brownie bites, and muffins).  Sweet Tomatoes is definitely ""cafeteria casual"" and its clientele is compromised of young families, vegetarians, and seniors (my observation on several visits).  While I appreciate the freshness of the produce and prepared foods -- turnover seems to be very quick -- I think that the price is a little high for what you get (about $12 for one adult dinner without drink), especially since there are hardly any protein options (beans in the salad area, cheese in some of the pastas, and chicken in the chicken noodle soup consist of all the protein offerings).  However, for my pickier friends who just can't decide on anything and who want to eat healthier, I'll typically suggest Sweet Tomatoes.",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,2,1,3,D4c7k3sAN15oAozDI0nXXg

The things I like is the simplicity of the buffet nothing too crazy but simple food, fresh, and really not lot of unhealthy food on the menu. It all starts with the obvious the salad bar first thing hit before even pay and sit down. The selection of salad greens great (choose from head lettuce, organic mix greens, romaine greens, and one more think fresh spinach), and two prepared salad ceasars salad was one of them. The toppings is pretty diverse from raw vegetables, pasta salad, garnishes, and something NEW never notice before have premium topping that  can add too salad for price (honestly none of it looked that great too just ify spending more plus still the soups, mac/cheese, and more things the menu not even checked out yet). The salad dressings over ten different ones too choose one. Me generally italian dressing guy or creamy italian dressing. Once done with the salad get seated unfortunately being holiday ended up waiting ten mins at most. Still not that bad wait. The manager very friendly, and made the short wait go by easy.

The soups range for four too five usually vary from day too day. Most part there all pretty solid soups. I had the chili and the creamy mushroom soup on this visit. Both of the soups were good and hearty. Nice and hot perfect on cold day. The cornbread I LOVE it. Between Famous Dave and Sweet Tomatoes could be in cornbread bliss. I ended up getting four pieces of it!!!! The mac and cheese is good. It little on the running side which prefer more thick and cheesy one. Still works for me. The pizza is good but this visit ran out of room. 

Another thing enjoy about Sweet Tomatoes is there lemonade. It says house made so assume the obvious. I enjoy the strawberry lemonade! It nice and refreshing perfect compliment with nice salad (light, hearty, or any style you choose). Not super sweet just right amount. 

The price is very reasonable and if looking for light buffet Sweet Tomatoes is the way too go.....",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,3,4,P8dIisJvahCAnDjmCyckTg

2241230,2014-07-22,2,mmbXj7CmjGbH-wR3j6cD0w,"It's not that I don't like Sweet Tomatoes, I still do. If you asked me a year ago I would've said it was 4 stars but now that they've raised the price a few times since then, it's not really worth it to eat here anymore unless you get a coupon which are usually available in the newspaper or via email if you sign up for their e-club. I came here last weekend and was shocked to see that the lunch price was now just under $10! For a salad buffet? WTF

The benefits to eating here are that you get to build your own salad from an extensive line of veggies, toppings, and seemingly homemade dressings. There are also pre-made salads and pasta salads but none are usually very good or worth eating. I usually try a couple but then end up grossed out after a couple bites. Once you get to the end of the salad bar, you select a drink and pay for your meal. 

In the dining room there is a soup, pasta and potato bar where you can choose from about 6-8 different kinds of soup and also load up on extra carbs like breads, pizza, pastas like mac & cheese, and baked potato with various toppings. I usually just go for the soup and breads so I can't comment on the others.

There is also a dessert area adjacent to the soup bar with fruit, pudding and soft serve ice cream. The only thing worth eating here is the tapioca pudding and ice cream. I even realized on this last visit that these 2 things are even better mixed!

Overall Sweet Tomatoes is a good place to go pig out on food you think is healthy, but really it's not...unless all you get is plain veggies. I used to love coming here (and their other locations) but now the pricing is just getting out of hand. Is food cost really up that much for a bunch of veggies and soup stock?

Customer service was great but the food was horrible. Talk about carb central. The options for the salads were great, and fresh. Just very unconventional that you have to walk all the way out to the front of the restaurant to get more salad. The soups were flavorless, and watery. The chili had no flavor, and the chowder tasted of pure sweet corn. More like a desert than soup, yuck! Said potatoes in it but I saw and tasted none. There was ""pizza"" if you could call it that. Just tasted like a bread stick.. And not a good one at that. The pastas vey flavorless and cold. The sauces were dried to them which meant they'd been sitting under the lamp a while. The only thee option was a baked potatoe. Which were dry and over cooked. Fail.

The corn bread was good but that's about it. Especially paired with the sweet butter

Only desert was ice cream and these midget cones. They were so small you couldn't put ice cream cause its fall off.

The one on lake mead is ten times better and I will tell everyone to stay away. 

For four people it cost us 50 bucks. It's crazy it's ten a person not including your drink. I would have rather had mc Donald's or Taco Bell.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,7,4,1,7ngBhcFXsru06AoWxRQOOQ

Today was pasta night so they had three types plus the cheese tortellini soup which I enjoyed, and of course they have four in-house made drink options such as the Arnold Palmer, lemonade, strawberry lemonade, and unsweetened raspberry (not too sure if it is) tea. You have to save room for dessert because they have soft serve, toppings, and cobblers.

After my healthy plate was devoured...ventured to the hot food line next and enjoyed a bowl of spaghetti and some macaroni and cheese. Grabbed a mouth watering cornbread and some of the honey whipped butter to smother it. The focaccia bread was good as well as the thin slices of pizza. To be a little sophisticated I grabbed some sour dough bread and ripped it up, then went to the salad bar and got a plate of olive oil and vinegar with cracked pepper, mmmm gotta love dipping bread in that mixture. One of the seasonal favorites was a coconut muffin, oh my so good had to end the meal with another. I tried some chicken noodle soup and then found two more cornbread on my plate somehow. Good food still fresh even before they close.",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,3,2,4,5zZX1vXg2_JXkc-6Ai6E4Q

My fiance and I went here on recommendations from Yelp. Seeing both high and low ratings, we figured we had to see for ourselves.

You walk in and immediately have the full salad bar option. The dressings could have been labeled better (mismatched labels), but after pointing it out to a clerk it was quickly fixed. The hot line had a few tasty breads, including a dessert option and BBQ pizza option. The drinks really impressed me. They had the normal Coke products, but also a few coffee types, tea, two lemonades, a virgin hibiscus sangria, and strawberry drink. 

As for their soups, there were 7 options when we ate. I tried the Claw Chowder. Not the best I've ever had, but solid recipe. Supposedly you can suggest new soups online and they'll be in the store within a few days.

Overall, great for a varied lunch buffet, especially at a terrific price ($11 at time of writing), but not the fancy restaurant you'd go to for an anniversary",3xnkxd4L_npONbLsqQGKOw,0,0,4,V4MQ0ZQ9hc6NnYjCXfUK3Q

The first time I went here I was very confused because it's a big salad bar with the registers at the end. You load up and then pay. Rather than the typical Vegas buffet style of pay, then plate.

I suspect someone at corporate paid a psychologist a lot of money to decide that, because even though they are very friendly, I feel awkward about walking past them again to get more salad. ALSO, there is a ton of food behind the line - potato and pasta and a dessert bar, all of which is included in the meal, but the temptation is to avoid the conflict by loading up on lots of salad and thereby not eating any of the hot food. It makes it difficult for me to portion it out properly, is what I am saying.

You grab a tray and plate, build your salad masterpiece, then grab a place to sit and enjoy.  The veggies are always fresh and there's a wonderful variety of soups.  Several of the soups are seasonal, so be sure to watch for changes in the line up.  There's also a small assortment of pastas and breads to complement your salad.

If you sign up for their e-mail list, you also get coupons every week as well as notices when they make a change in a featured soup.  They also offer a discount for active or retired members of the military.

2741662,2014-01-27,3,mmbXj7CmjGbH-wR3j6cD0w,"Ok, so here is my obligatory review only because I go here more than I want to. I am a carnivore so this place is definitely not on my top places to eat list. I have 4 main reasons why I come here. 1 is because my wife loves salad. 2 and 3 because my two kids love mac and cheese along with the chicken noodle soup. Lastly, 4 because every so often I over indulge in having some kind of meat fest whether its a large Ribeye or at a buffet like Korean Barbeque or Brazillian so I tend to feel kind of guilty. So salad is in order.

So if you ask me where and what to eat, I will  never mention this place ever. 
But for you salad eaters, I can see why this would be heaven for you. As soon as you step foot in the place, you grab a plate or two, throw it on a tray, then off you go to the long buffet bar full of all sorts of vegetables.

Then you pay and you're off on your merry way to go find a table or booth to sit down. If you join their email club, they send you coupon specials and promos. Also, if you look in the newspaper, every now and then they have 2 for 1 specials. When its really packed, you have to wait for a host to find you a seat.

Once you sit down, you have other choices like different soups, breads, pasta, etc. Every month they usually have different themes like lemon month, which means a lot of the items have some kind of lemon influence like lemon cake or pomegranate lemonade fusions.

Some random info: They have these card thingies at your table that indicates if you took off to go get more food or if you are done so the bussers know whether to clean your whole table or not. These guys are the same as Soup Plantation in Southern California. Dont forget dessert! They have frozen yogurt you serve yourself!

So from my point of view, my family loves it here, which makes it ok for me.

You get in line, fill up your plate with either a pre-made salad or make your own. Then you pay and grab a seat. I find this place to be odd because I'm the type of person who likes to scope out a buffet before deciding what to eat first. At least let me pay then check things out. But to grab a salad, pay, then get more food seems like a bizarre process.

All the food is average. Nothing exceptional, but a few items I would eat again. A couple of the pre-made salads were decent. The cornbread and chocolate peanut butter chip muffin were also good. The focaccia was decent, pastas were below average, and baked potatoes were tiny. They've got chocolate and vanilla soft-serve ice cream with some toppings to mix in. They has some sort of low-fat mango mousse which was not good.

The place is clean and the bussers were quick to pick up used plates. It's a family-friendly restaurant and relatively inexpensive place to eat, but pales in comparison to real buffets around town.

It's a myriad of unlimited salad items, endless soups, unlimited fountain drinks, and an infinity of hot carbs.  These restaurants have a monthly theme where they utilize in-season fruits/vegetables to create special dishes aside from their already existing menu items.  February's theme was potatoes (ex. cream of potato soup, potato salad, etc.).

The West Flamingo location is the newest Sweet Tomatoes in the area and even boasts outdoor seating that overlooks the great I-215 (also a great view of Home Depot).

SALAD
Fresh pre-made caesars, pre-made cold pasta salads, pre-made broccoli salad, etc.  The salad bar also boasts tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, cauliflower, and tons of other veggies!  For the chef salad fans, they have feta and cheddar cheeses, hard-boiled egg, croutons, and a boat load of different salad dressings.  Grilled chicken is extra $.

SOUP
I've never really been a fan of their soups even though I've tried many of them :-\.  Each restaurant has about 3-5 different soups.  

HOT BAR  
Mac and cheese, Iike theirs because I like Kraft.  Perfect for the kiddies.  They also have at least one other hot pasta but don't ask me, because I stick to the Kraft.  While you're up there the have hot potatoes that you can load up, different bread sticks that are pretty yummy, and muffins!  OMG the blueberry muffins are to die for.  Put the honey butter on them--euphoria!

DRINKS
Unlimited of course, just like everything else.  They offer Coca Cola products and also have different iced teas and juices.  Mix and match you crazy barista!

DESSERT
I always stuff myself on the blueberry muffins, so I never visit the ice cream.  Yes, I said ISCREAM!  Dreyer's chocolate and vanilla, soft serve, if you will.  The sprinkles and chocolate sauce aren't just for the kiddies either, go ahead, I won't tell.  Don't forget the hot cobbler!

I came here for the first time with my mom on a lunch date after receiving some coupons for $6.99 lunch via email. 

Apparently I was so excited to just eat that I forgot to get a plate when I walked in. I went straight to the salad with my tray and when I was just about to place the pile of salad onto my plate, I realized I didn't have one! I almost dumped the salad onto my empty tray. I looked over to my left and saw my mom cracking up. That's how much I love Sweet Tomatoes.

Great salad and soup selection. I was very happy to see they had tomato soup when we went (my favorite).  The people at the salad bar are always fixing the tongs and making sure everything looks clean. The bussers are on top of their game as well, cleaning up plates the second they detect you are finished. 

The dessert section is never really amazing, but come on, you're there for the soup and salad. If you really want a treat though, you should grab one of their chocolate chip cookie bags, soo tasty and freshly baked!

All in all, I love this location. I'll be back many more times!

They also have corners for pizza, soups and dessert selection.  You can get as many as your hungry belly desire. Vegan options available as well as some gluten-free ones.

There are many friendly staff walking around cleaning your empty dishes, refill the bar and etc.

I have been a great date for my young friend and we had a fun time eating here.  Would I come back?  Maybe.  But if you need quick and inexpensive lunch or dinner, this might not be a bad option.

Kept very clean and tidy. Tables bussed fast, plates removed often, always sweeping and wiping down the counters. Bathrooms been good each time.

Plenty of parking even though it can get packed in here on weekends, maybe a 10 minute wait at worst if crazy busy. May be easier to exit out the back to avoid a needed u-turn. 

I'll be back for sure! Maybe I'll see ya there. Enjoy!",2YiBYO8n32upYTJnpWgqLg,5,4,5,u4OgYDB7hhUVXtMRpL_w8Q

So he asked me yet again because we went off track trying while ringing us up. I said ""No, we're good.""   He replies, ""OKAY, I was JUST asking.."" I looked at his confused as I thought I was more than polite about it, my rply was "".. and I'm just saying."" with this smile on my face.

They had ran out of seats! 

So we had to stand around for 10 minutes with our food on our trays until there was an open spot.

Compared to their Rainbow location in Las Vegas, this place is pretty small and that's too bad because their food is very good... Just didn't like the wait. It would've been nice to have been warned by the person at the front door before we started down the salad bar.

Lately, however, the quality of the food has diminished. The salad leafs are not as fresh and crisp. The pasta is getting progressively watery. Sweet Tomatoes has much more business and the last time I went to Sweet Tomatoes was the first time I actually had to wait to be seated.

This location is one of the smaller ones I've been to, but still has all the expected foods. It is a simple square dining area, with high ceilings, and is bright and clean. The salad bar was organized a bit differently than I am used to; it was a more condensed layout with small square bins in a three-rowed grid, instead of the linear, one or two-level bins at other locations. The drink cups (both beverage and water cups) were also laid out for you to take on your own instead of being behind the counter. 

As for the hot food area, it was also a bit smaller than I was used to, with fewer muffin selections but the standard variety of breads, pasta, and soups. It's ""May Flavor Fiesta"" month, so I noticed that there was horchata as a beverage option and even horchata muffins! I was pretty excited about those.

I did notice that there weren't that many soup bowls and they ran out twice during my meal. Also, there has always been clam chowder (one of their signature soups) at all the Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes locations that I have dined at, but there was no clam chowder here! It's okay, they still had my all-time favorite chicken noodle soup.

As a whole, this is a solid Sweet Tomatoes location, but the portions are just smaller than I am used to (probably this store just doesn't have the volume of diners that I'm used to). Employees that I interacted with at the cash register and collecting used plates were all very friendly though, and they were pretty good about regularly wiping down the counters.

In the end, after having dined at Sweet Tomatoes and Souplantation in various cities and states around the country, I have yet to find one as good as the one in my hometown of Tustin, but I still recommend coming to this Las Vegas location for a satisfying meal!",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,3,2,4,mG_KQcHmoL367a2tDHiMMQ
3459528,2010-08-18,0,mmbXj7CmjGbH-wR3j6cD0w,"The girls at work love this place and since I love them,I go to Sweet Tomatoes with them for lunch. The location on Flamingo is new and so the restaurant is clean, well organized and spiffy. Sweet Tomatoes is supposed to be a salad bar experience. The moment you walk in, there is a long line of salad fixings: prepared salads, greens, veggies (beets, corn etc), beans, pasta, croutons, dressings. After you fill up your plate, you pay for the meal: almost 9 bucks for lunch. Not too bad considering you can have unlimited goes at all the food. Towards the back of the restaurant there is the prepared foods sections: soups (about 5/6 daily), pastas, breads, baked potatoes, drinks, muffins and dessert. 

Although Sweet Tomatoes is always referred to as a ""salad place"" it's really not somewhere you want to go if you're in any sort of a diet. There is just way too many carby, cheese laden foods that unless you have self control (I have none), you're going to have a calorie fest. 

Having said that, these are the things I like about Sweet Tomatoes at W. Flamingo (besides the above-mentioned spiffiness of the restaurant:

1. Service - friendly wait staff, staff that clear the empty plates in a jiffy, general efficiency of the people who work there
2. Labeling - They label their prepared dishes as ""vegetarian"" and sometimes even ""vegan."" The website does an amazing job of letting you know what type of prepared foods each location has. Visit the site before going down to your Sweet Tomato experience
3. Creativity - Props to them for trying. They had Asian Week this week and they've tried to have Asian inspired soups, noodles etc. Ummm...they had tofu available for ""Asian Week."" I nearly went to heaven (until I saw a piece of what looked like ham in the tofu container - see my statement on separation)
4. Soups - They have 6 soups and 2/3 of them are always veg/vegan
5. The Garlic Focaccia Bread and Cornbread with Whipped Butter - Mmmmmm. 

Cons:
1. Taste - Honestly, nothing blew me away. The garlic focaccia and cornbread were the only things that came close to it. The soups were quite bland, the prepared salads were tasteless and the brownies were dry and tasted like diet food. With a menu of about 30 items, it's pretty incredible that there was only 2 items I liked
2. Separation - Not sure how they could get around it, but they have meaty items with vege items in the same area and you do see some cross-contamination
3. Crowd - This location was packed. Took me about 15 min to get from lettuce to spinach due to the 2 perfectly coiffed women in front of me deciding which green to eat
4. Marketing - For a restaurant to claim that it's healthy and promoting veggies there is a lot of artery clogging options available. Tell it as it is. Salad here but lots of comfort food too

All in all, Sweet Tomatoes is a decent option for lunch and probably would make everyone in your group happy. But don't be fooled into thinking that eating here will make you the next Twiggy.",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,0,0,3,tauzVVTYioLD87b3LsGcfA

Went online and found a coupon, it was a special of $6.99 for up to four people during lunch. Four people and two drinks for 32 something, not bad.

What I like:

- Get your salad first then pay. 

- Pretty decent variety of vegetables, dressings, and toppings, nothing ""premium"", but it was only 6.99 ($8.50 normally).

- A variety of soup selection, different strokes for different folks yo.

- Friendly staff. The cashier told me to go have a seat and he'll bring me my receipt. Never brought me my receipt, so when I questioned it, he gave me a meal voucher. Problem solved with no headache!

- Patio dining! I have not seen this at the other locations that I have been to. I didn't take advantage of it today because it was hot, but when the weather cools down, it would be pretty cool to watch traffic pass by while munching on my croutons.

- WARM brownies and frozen yogurt were available. Great for ghetto pizookies.  

What I didn't like: 

- It took a bit for the plates to clear.

-  Drinks are a bit pricey ($2.50?), at least its all you can drink.

There's also a fair amount of soup to choose from. And I really like that they don't just serve the same food all the time. They always have new soup choices each week. 

The place is clean and the food is pretty good if you're trying to be healthy. It's really sort of a hit or miss but I do find myself coming back here a lot. Mostly cuz they have chilli. Did I mention you can also make a baked potato?",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,2,0,3,FDmAJH1vp-n43wAkxevBhQ

It's not expensive at lunch time and we definitely ate our money's worth. My only reason for not giving five stars is that perhaps there could be a segregated area for families with children. It was just a little bit hectic and I nearly got knocked off my feet several times by children running loose.

The salad bar was great as usual. I seen a sign for garlic dressing so I put a little bit of what I thought was that on my plate. I tried it out and it tasted like Caesar dressing. They might need to change the sign for that. 

My boyfriend and I thought the breads were kinda dry and a bit stale. Not as great compared to the Rainbow location. My favorite soup is the ginger soup because I like to add chicken from the noodle soup and put green onions in it with a bit of salt and pepper. Simple but I really like it that way. It's pretty much like the Hawaiian dish chicken long rice but, not lol. They had the sign for ginger soup up but below was this vegetable soup with small meatballs in it. Kinda disappointing. I didn't bother to try it. There was a new soup that I've never seen before called, Sriracha Udon. It was ok, kinda salty and the noodles were overcooked. 

Dessert was ok. The ice cream was really light which I liked. The brownies didn't look very good. I didn't see a whole brownie in sight. And there was a sign for lava cake but I didn't see any. They should think about refilling the food a bit faster. 

Overall, this trip was just ok and kinda disappointing. At least the service was good. The employees always came by to pick up the dishes.

Sweet Tomatoes has everything you could possibly want to make the salad of your dreams. Personally, I like having some of their already made Caesar salad, as well as making my own salad on a separate plate. They also have at least 4 or 5 soups, two different types of pizza, pasta,macaroni and cheese, a build your own baked potato station, two different types of muffins, and a self-serve ice cream machine (possibly yogurt, I'm not sure now that I think about it). 

The soups, pasta, and muffins change every now and again. My guess is that it changes based on the season. The staff is usually friendly, although I remember having an issue once and the lady behind the counter pretty much blamed me for it.

Sweet Tomatoes is my go to spot when I want to eat healthy after a work out.  I love their salad display.  They have everything you need to make your salad nice and hearty the way you like.  They also offer extra options at a small price such as tofu, chicken pieces, and edamame.  I think those items shoule be free though because it's already quite pricey here in the first place.  But then again, it is a buffet so I can't complain.

1 star = for their salad display as described.

2 stars = for the honey whipped butter; it's so good!

3 stars = corn bread muffins they always have.  And their limited offered Chocolate Chip muffins are soooooo good, I can eat like 7 in one sitting.  Their Banana Crunch muffin tops are super good too!

4 stars = for having different items; it's never the same except for their regulars but it's nice to have some twists every now and then.

The Lemon Cream Pasta with capers sounded good but it was odd tasting- maybe too much lemon?  The desserts were in shambles which was likely due to the many young children serving themselves without adult supervision.

Coming from Southern California, we have Souplantion rather than Sweet Tomatoes but they're both pretty much the same thing. So I expected it to be the same as its SoCal counterpart in terms of service and quality. 

Granted, my mother and I came at the end of lunch rush and as expected it was a bit busy. So I understand if the buffet lines weren't cleared up. There's a constant inflow of people and it's hard to keep wiping after them. But the thing is that half the trays and plates were wet. The damp trays didn't bother us as much but the plates were a tad bit gross. We shifted through a couple plates to find a dryer ones and even then, our food had an after scent/taste of dish washer water. 

The service and food were fine. Our busser occasionally checked up on us to take away our empty plates. The food was fresh, of course. The blueberry muffins were perfect today! The muffin top had the right amount of crisp while the inside was very warm and fluffy! If only they had Clam Chowder :'(

4259387,2017-07-24,1,mmbXj7CmjGbH-wR3j6cD0w,"I recently joined the email club (*my offer was expiring soon) because I was wanting to try restaurants near home. This one's in a shopping center filled with other area restaurants, but it's a small ST location, compared to the Henderson one and the Rainbow/Best In The West one. (Parking was ample.) We visited yesterday for lunch, and it was crowded; there was a 5-10 minute wait for seating. (One diner decided to get her salad to-go, which was a couple bucks cheaper than dining in.) There is lots of outdoor seating, but noone was out there in the middle of summer. 

You start off with a tray and plate, gathering your salad and grab-and-go drinks, before you pay. Some seasonal items (different offering for lunch and dinner) were the BBQ Chicken Salad, which was excellent. Our son's was $3.99, and it came with a drink, so we got him the apple juice box. Once we got our table, Hubby got more items at the soup side (chicken noodle- thick noodles!, sweet potato---so yummy, & shrimp bisque) and I got some bread sides (lemon muffin---I had two, bread slices (two kinds, cheesy garlic), cornbread- tastes like jiffy) and red grapes- sweet, for the most part. I saw the baked potatoes with all the fixings, but I skipped it (maybe next time?). Our son's a picky eater, but he loved the chicken noodle soup, croutons, pickles, grapes, cheesy bread, and pasta salad. He ate pretty good. He even had a mini ice cream cone and nearly finished it. Ice cream choices are vanilla, chocolate, or swirl. Toppings are caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, chocolate cookies pieces, and sprinkles. 

TIP: get a little bit at a time, to taste test the item, then, go back for more, if they are your favorites. 

The staff was nice, though, they were very busy. It was nice to get our used plates and bowls removed, while they came around with smiles on their faces. As soon as tables were empty,
 the staff was there to quickly clean up the tables. (And the food stations were getting attention, too, once the line shortened.) We were seated next to the bathroom, which was a very popular spot, second to the food stations. The rest of the restaurant looked clean. 

Back to the seating and main dining room of the restaurant. It's kind of a tight squeeze, people passing through the aisles had to wait for others to pass, as it was basically a highway on foot. Hubby said they messed up with the overall design of the seating. I agree. Maybe it was just super busy because it was sunday lunch time, and we kind of got here a little later than our usual stint for lunch. The customer base was mostly families (about 90%). Maybe next time, we'll get here earlier than yesterday's visit.  

If you use the promotional coupons it can be pretty reasonable for your family to eat here (at Stations casinos, our toddler son is full price; it's not worth it to bring him there because he's a picky eater). I'd say that this is better than a typical casino buffet and better than Golden Corral, in terms of quality, but you should like eating salads. (Of course, this is not a meat-based buffet. For meat, you cannot beat Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao.) So, like any buffet, there are good items and bad items, you just gotta taste it for yourself to judge if you like places like this.

I really thought that since this is the closest Sweet Tomato to us in the Southwest coupled with the fact that it's across LVAC that they would've made the restaurant bigger, which, they did not. It seems smaller and a bit cramped, even the entrance way was a lot smaller than the other locations. Who knows, my perception of the place could've been affected by the fact that it was super-D-duper packed with human beings.

We went on monday night to this location since we happened to be in that part of the valley and it was past dinner time. So we used one of our coupons, making it 2 dinners for $23 total which included the overpriced drinks. I think they should make the drinks part of the meal price. 

What I hate about this new one, the way the salad bar is designed, it's almost impossible to get the middle items without crashing into the glass. This would work great for neanderthals, since they had super long arms. Or monkeys, since they can reach further than some of us humans. So to get some olives, you have to bend down and reach as far as you can, meanwhile your face is almost in your salad, and your hair probably is too. 
Bad concept.

The restaurant is smaller, and I much prefer the Rainbow location or the Stephanie street one. 

I have never had a problem with any of the food exacting revenge on me before until the mushroom soup on monday night. My husband and I both had the same salad, side salads, side dishes, except we both had different soups. He hates mushrooms, but I love them. The soup pot was full, and I couldn't figure out why no one was eating it, and I got a cup. 
Everything was great,we enjoyed our meal, and 5 minutes after leaving the restaurant, I felt uncomfortably too full, bloated and felt like I'd better get to a restroom pronto. So stopped at a fast food place, and made it in the nick of time.
Let's just say it was a rather gross unpleasant experience, one that I do not wish to relive in any way, ever!!!!!!!  And I will never ever eat at that location ever again for any reason. I will stick to the Rainbow location or the Henderson one if I ever go there again. Right now, I am afraid to.",WK1cwhEcprays8Pual4b8g,1,0,3,TRVdUry8nKgqd0SxRIwcpw

I did notice that some of the items were fresher at this location, which may be because of the size. Not as much room to have things sitting under the heat lamps.

I knew about this relatively new location for a while, but it was my first time here. I really like the spot. It seems like a bunch of places have suddenly sprouted up around them, from Yogurtland to Sammy's Wood-Fired Pizza.

As for Sweet Tomatoes, you probably know the deal. As soon as you enter, you're faced with the salad line. You pick up a tray and a plate (or two), construct your salad, and pay at the end. This location seems to be a little different in that they actually seat you. At every other Sweet Tomatoes I've been to, you just seat yourself.

I have never had a bad salad at Sweet Tomatoes. No matter what ingredients I add, it always just turns out great. This occasion was no exception. I think you can go back for more salad, but I usually don't. To be honest, their post-salad items aren't always amazing, but I come here for the salad anyway. Anything else is just a bonus.

They usually have at least one great soup. They are made from scratch daily and there is a wide selection. I guess February is potato month, so on this particular visit, they had baked Sweet Potatoes. Yum! Yum! Yum! I didn't have any muffins on this visit, but those are usually great too, especially if you pair it with something from their excellent butter selection.

By the way, where else can you get a freakin tiny ass ice cream cone? They don't actually serve ice cream, but they have a frozen yogurt machine. You really have to be careful with those tiny cones because they fill up almost instantly!

It is after paying that you can bask in the unlimited supply of pizza, soup, muffins and non-fat frozen yogurt in the interior of the restaurant. 

Great options. We kept heading back to the soups - Mexican Meatball soup for Candy and cheddar brocolls/potato leek for me. For once, I could take in mouthful after mouthful without feeling too conscious (or too bad) about the calorie intake. Clean atmosphere.

The staff generally looks like they are trying the best they can, but it's usually a little messy and gross all over, with shortages of half the stuff.  If you're actually really trying to be healthy, stick to the salad bad (you can go through more than once, you know) and the broth-based soups -- and skip the bread and other high-carbs, the cream-based soups, and the soft-serve.  But a lot of the stuff really isn't all that healthy, and it's hard to find stuff with protein.  I keep hoping they will try harder to put more gluten-free and less heavily-processed choices.  It still reminds me a little too much of the salad bars of the 80s with all the ""comfort junk food"".

Price for two dinner buffet with drinks was over $31. So our expectations were a bit higher after we paid.

Pepsi products only! The ice cream was disappointing as was every single soup option. We felt like the overall presentation was pretty dirty, and the food quality was lacking.

We followed someone to one set in the front and it was locked. After walking to another set of doors, an employee decided to let us in. Seeing we were lost, he could've explained the beginning of the line. We arrived just after 4 when the price increases from lunch pricing to the dinner rate. I wouldn't mind if the bar were fully stocked, but it wasn't. There were several empty bowls. I dressed a mediocre salad, set it at my table and went off to check out the soups. The station was messy. I sampled two soups - the curry bisque and the mushroom. Both were really salty. I didn't think the curry complemented the bisque whatsoever. The mushroom reminded me of my Campbell soup days. Oh, I forgot.. You have to pay extra for your self serve fountain pop. The price has slipped my mind, but I remember it being not at all worth it. I opted for water. So then you can have dessert, because you will have room in your belly.. There's a soft serve station with minimal fixings.. Then beside that is random additional desserts..that day it was rice pudding and a chocolate lava cake. Sounds delish, but I'd stick with the soft serve.. So then I see people leaving tips. Hmmmm. I've been to buffets in which a server will get you drinks, and that is deserving of a tip. But to tip someone to take my plate away after I leave? Since when do we tip busboys?

And forgetta bout all the fancy schmancy restaurant options on the Strip for a minute. You must check out Sweet Tomatoes in Summerlin!

I grew up in sunny San Diego eating at Soup Plantation with the family on Sunday mornings after church. It was always a treat! A quality salad bar and soup buffet for less than $10 was such a great value and still is!

Now, Sweet Tomatoes and Soup Plantation are related. Soup Plantation was founded in San Diego and is headquartered there. As they expanded, it was decided that any location outside of Southern California would be called ""Sweet Tomatoes.""

The Salad bar buffet at Sweet Tomatoes (Soup Plantation) is one of the largest around. I'd say it's even bigger than what you'd find at buffets on the Strip. The first selection of greens are pre-mixed ""Salads of The Day"" like Caesar, Oriental Chicken, or Strawberry Kale. Further along, fresh raw greens and various vegetable add-ins are filled to the brim. Never a shortage. There's always a wide variety to choose from too - something for everyone. It's amazing how everyone flows through the same line and ends up with Salad creations that are so different from each other! Finally, top those plates off with your favorite dressing, croutons, seeds, fresh pepper, etc. They have disposable cups for extra dressing or toppings. So, fill 'em up!

After your salad is made, pay at the register. Check-in with Yelp for 15% off! And if that offer is no longer valid, they also honor military discount.

After paying, an attendant will escort you to a table. Once you're settled in, visit the Soup bar! At this location, there were 8 soups available to choose from. Clam chowder is my go-to. But then, because it's a buffet, I'll go back to try other soups in smaller portions, like chili, chicken noodle, minestrone, etc. And they're all homemade!!

Speaking of homemade, there's also the Bakery for fresh yumminess like corn bread, blueberry muffins, and focaccia. As well as the Pasta station for fettuccine or penne.

Finally, if you still have room for dessert, there's a fresh fruit bar, soft serve ice cream, and more!

Overall, Sweet Tomatoes is a great restaurant. Perfect for large families with small children, too. Kids just love having the freedom to make their own plate as well as the full-on permission to get up and out of their seats to grab more veggies and soup! They might even surprise you with a special-made sundae. Win-win for all! :-)

Oh how I wish Sweet Tomatoes (Soup Plantation) had a location in Hawaii....",1maoJPTlgljLxbKFJb0qIg,10,12,5,45TrNOINXhLxIGBvgzLYuA
5033223,2011-08-07,0,mmbXj7CmjGbH-wR3j6cD0w,"I had been eyeing this restaurant ever since I moved to Las Vegas, but always seemed to go under my hunger radar. Finally, after three years, my husband and I decided to check it out. This place is a buffet, which we had not anticipated. It looks like a cafeteria - though a nice one, for that matter. If you are looking for Vegas' signature buffet staples (crab legs, prime rib, endless shrimp, and stale pizza), you should not visit this place. When people say this is mostly for vegetarians, they are not kidding. First, there is a hefty salad bar, with build-your-own and pre-designed options. I tried the Asiago Ceasar Salad. It was absolutely delicious, I have to say. Not at all what I expected from this place. The dressing was tangy, mustardy, and the pieces of lettuce were not soggy. I went back for seconds. Then, as I tried to figure out what to have next, I realized that salads and soups were basically considered entrees. So, I tried the Dijon Chicken soup, and again, I was pleasantly surprised. It was full of flavor! I also had seconds. Then I saw my husband helping himself to some ""chunky chicken noodle soup"", and I decided to try that to. The thing is, that soup was lacking in flavor (only chicken - huge chunks of it - and noodles...no veggies). So, I filled my cup half way with Dijon Chicken soup, and topped with Chunky Chicken Noodle soup. Great combo! 

We also helped ourselves to some of what they call bruscetta, though they look like pizzas. They were pretty good. We also tried their honey-wheat bread, and sourdough bread, both of which were very good. For dessert, I tried the chocolate lava cake, which was too sweet and not at all tasted like it was made with ""good"" ingredients. The blueberry muffins, however, were quiet tasty. 

At the end, you sort of feel stuffed, but not really. I mean, you basically had little to no protein, and you're probably going to crave some a while later. If you're watching your weight, this is a great place to visit. They have all sorts of coupons, and I sort of felt like the only person ever to pay full price for dinner (about $27 for two adults' dinners, and two endless fountain drinks). I am definitely coming back here, coupons in hand, given their proximity to my home, and the surprisingly great flavors they offer! However, whenever I wish to fulfill canrnivore cravings, I would definitely skip this place.",p6jBxxG6TA5mAD6slTQ6sQ,0,0,3,foZkBs8p2uuxQ3vTGUDUAg

Plus, let's put it in perspective.   Here you get unlimited salad in freshness, lots of selection of salad stuff, dressing, toppings.  Over at wendys or Ihop you get one salad bowl. If you tried to make it at home, it'd probably all spoil and go bad considering all the ingredients.   Spot a coupon you can get away with lunch for 10 bucks.

The pasta was cold and bland, and the bread products (except for the cornbread, which was quite tasty and moist) were reminiscent of lumped sawdust.

What separates this from other locations is service above all. I had planned on grabbing dinner here with a friend, and was waiting for her inside. In the five minute wait, I had been kindly attended to - conversations ranging from ""How are you doing?"" or just chatting about random topics. Never have I experienced staff so cordial and attentive at another Sweet Tomatoes. Another difference would be the modern decor - completely different from the country stylings of other locations.

The food is nothing spectacular other than its freshness. Ever since living in Seattle, salads have become at least one meal out of the day. So coming here satisfies that requirement.  Not only do I satisfy my salad fix, I engage in carbohydrate overload with all the delicious breads. Oh, but then there's the strawberry butter hidden away above the baked potatoes.

Not that he needs to be on one considering he's the healthiest person I know in this entire world.  He is a firm believer that eating only vegetables and fruits will give you a longer life.  

In a lot of ways, I have started to think the same way.  Maybe because I started watching too many documentaries regarding the exploitation of meat and how hormones are commonly used in the growth of all animals.  But, I still love the taste of meat and can't completely remove it from my diet completely.  

To please my stepdad, I took him to Sweet Tomatoes.  Once we walked through the entrance door, I saw the long bar table filled with different salads, and vegetables.  I also looked at the price and it said $9.89 per person and $2.39 for unlimited drinks.  Altogether, we paid almost $27.00 plus tip for two people.  We got our trays and placed two plates and then filled our plates with the salads and vegetables we desired to eat.  I thought we could come back for seconds or thirds with salad, but that's not how it works here.

After seating ourselves, there's another bar with a small assortment of pizza, breads, one choice of pasta and steamed vegetables, baked potato stuff, and a large variety of soup.  There's also another station for drinks and dessert.  

Since the advertisement was buffet style, I figured there would be more variety to choose from.  For anyone choosing to eat buffet, it's ideal to eat at a casino and pay a little extra.  The only good thing I can say about this establishment is the freshness of their vegetables and fruits.

The salad bar seems weird in that you fill it up and then pay. Rest assured, you can come back as much as you like. The premade salads were pretty gross, but the fixings for the DIY salad were decent. Nothing premium like avocado (and they make you pay extra for chicken! What a ripoff!). However, I was pleasantly surprised by the fun veggies they had - jicama, zucchini, butternut squash, etc, all shredded for your salad eating pleasure. 

Fountain drinks are pricey at $2.49, but they did have Coke Zero!

I tried a bite of their chicken coconut soup (my typical fav at Thai restaurants) - it was really gross. My coworkers cauliflower soup looked equally disgusting. 

For dessert I had a small bowl of their sugar free mango coconut mousse. I can't fault them for it tasting REALLY artificial (it was sugar free after all), plus it's cool they even offered something without sugar. The sundae bar looked pretty great if that's your cup of tea.

The greens look ""green"" and fresh. The items are replenished in a quick manner and are bright in color. We eat with our eyes first and I loaded up on all of the vibrant colored items.

Came with my cousins on a fairly early Monday for dinner. No line at the salad bar - everything looked fresh and the workers were preparing salads every so often so that the bowls were never too low. Everything about the salad bar is pretty much the same as back home EXCEPT for the fact that they have blue cheese crumbles here! It probably doesn't make a difference to most people, but I LOVE blue cheese, especially when they serve their grilled cheese focaccia dippers. 

Lots of tables and booths - I don't see this place filling up with too many people like other locations, which is nice. The drinks and desserts are located conveniently next to each other while the pasta, soups and breads are a few steps away. 

Another big plus is that they have chocolate chip cookies here, something they no longer serve back at home. Great for ice cream or brownies. They also have mini ice cream cones and a ton of ice cream toppings (sprinkles, Oreos, nuts, etc.) - enough to make me a fan of this Sweet Tomatoes!

I haven't encountered any of those problems at this location.  It's super clean, it looks great, there are generally less people, and the food, and service is awesome.  They even have patio seating!
Something I didn't know before is that you can also do take out.  You can get a box from the cashier, fill it up, and take it to go.

On a side note, their Sunday breakfast (every Sunday 9-12) is very disappointing. I've been trying to make time to check it out, and now that I have, I wouldn't recommend it.  The breakfast foods are just really blah, and the selection isn't all that.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,2,0,4,dFw6bHUpZPMnOthD3xDnng

Its great that they always change up the menu w/ the different themes every couple of weeks..some hit..some miss but there's no other restaurant I'm going to get such a huge dose of veggies like this place.  We always get coupons in the mail here which make it even better.  

I always get 2 plates when we go in.  One for the specialty mixed salads and the other where I just pile on a bunch of veggies etc.  I never bother w/ the breads/pasta section and usually get a couple of soups w/ the turkey chili and chicken noodle being my faves.

It is until you get into the main room where breads, soups, pastas and cake await.  It takes willpower not to overload on the carbs and calories.  Still everything is tasty and the kids love it too.  They have great variety for both food and drink.

My only beef with this place (other than there being no beef), is that they charge a fee for about a dozen ""premium"" toppings including chicken, mandarin oranges, etc. Nothing special but I would rather pay $1.00 extra for the meal than $3.99 extra each time I want a few pieces of chicken to go with my salad.  And the worst thing is you have to pay everytime you get a refill even though the rest of the salad bar is free refills although seriously, how would anyone know.

This particular location is not as clean as one would hope and the staff is less attentive than expected.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,0,0,3,u86yQPb-rTAb1vu8NQ0EUg

You've got salads, pasta and soup and dessert. It's about $12pp so that works for a family of 5. Kids were pleased with the food. The only difference for me is that Soup Plantations I've been to have more selections/varieties of food. But overall, I knew where I was coming so it was what I expected.  The desserts there were not for me but they did have a few different things.  They had ice cream/frozen yogurt machine which contained Peach Cobbler ice cream (not good to me lol), they also had brownies and a chocolate moose type dessert.

It's mostly salads and more salads and desserts and ice cream. There's brownies and bread and pizza stuff, too. I'll probably have to come back again for a more accurate review, but I was pretty satisfied and I'd definitely come back again. 

Eating here would be enough to satisfy you for the time being but you'll get hungry soon enough. I ate a lot more than I thought I could eat, but some of the salads + the right sauces were really good.

We got our plates and everything cleared pretty fast and they'd come around and take our plates when we were done so service wasn't an issue.. especially since it was buffet style.

Now I am actually wanting to go back again soon  .
I hope nothing changes by the time we go again.
So many choices when you don't eat meat.

This is a smaller location than most and is funny how it is set up with the salad bar near the front entrance. Anyhow it was super clean and the nice and cool air conditioning was a super treat for it being such a hot day outside.

We really enjoyed the items they had to offer especially the fresh strawberry lemonade in which we could have all we wanted.

This is a buffet/AYCE establishment and they boast that everything is homemade.

What we had:

Salad
Chili
broccoli and cheese soup
baked potato w/cheese, sour cream and chives
cheese bread
sourdough bread
macaroni and cheese
pasta (cold)
pasta (hot)
blueberry muffins
cornbread
strawberry lemonade
dessert chocolate frozen yogurt sundae with hot fudge and caramel


We really enjoyed it, the food is good however I grew up in San Diego where we had the soup plantation which was Amazing with quality food!

We will be back for sure because my sweet husband really liked it more than he thought he would.

The only annoying factor is that the table next to us was filled with staff eating on their breaks including the Manager. They were loud, laughing and goofing off which turned me off a bit.

The staff who clears plates off of the table was not on their game. While we ate dessert we still had our plates from our meal still on the table stacked up. The Manager walked pass our table several times as well and did not seem to care as he was more interested in hanging out with his staff who were on breaks eating hanging out in a booth.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,4,2,3,BVoHW-G6wigCoAGixvk-WQ

The bathrooms are always clean. There is always someone walking around cleaning and making sure everyone is ok.

They have high chairs (believe it or not some places do not )

And their food is never out on the line . They always restock. We have never had an issue here. The only one bad thing i would say if I had to is that if it's really packed and there is nowhere to sit . They still let people come down the line and grab their food instead of stopping it so u can get all the way to paying with no tables available.

Sweet Tomatoes is one of the few healthy food joints that I actually go to and will continue to return. Their food is always fresh and their servers are always polite. I have never had a negative experience at this location and I've even had the manager, and asked if everything was okay.

The only thing that has changed is a no longer have an area for the add-ons like chicken and other items. It used to be that you could pay a couple dollars more and put check in on your salad but they remove that option it look like. Me being a meat eater, I always look for a protein substance to put on my salad. However even without this I found the food to be good.

I had several different types of salads along with the tuna salad. It always good and I would highly suggest going here. It's a nice alternative to pizza, or burgers.",9HZSqrJhVZkjJxKVaOICbg,0,0,5,i8AZiTTa4kYKJkBNi402ew

You know what you're going to get -- SALAD, SOUP, PASTA, and MUFFINS - done.  It's not good for a diet, you know that.  Too much temptation.  Hint: If you are on a diet, DO NOT GO TO ANY BUFFETS.  Pssst...but here is a secret: If you have one plate, you will not gain wait.  Then again, this is Vegas -- the land of excess.

Everything is well monitored and maintained so it's always fresh.  I'm a fan of a good all-you-can-eat (AYCE) salad bar that's kept just like this, fresh and clean!  While this location is just more than a year or so old, it has about 2/3 the salad bar, and about 1/2 the amount of variety of soups, breads, muffins, etc., compared to most other ST's that I've been to.

A: Nahh.

We came when they opened around 11AM on Sunday and were surprised by how crowded they were.

The salad bar was clean and had lots of options. The one thing I enjoy about Sweet Tomatoes and Soup Plantation is the consistency. They are all pretty much the same and you find the same favorites from restaurant to restaurant with the addition of the monthly specials they have.

Of course I'd be the girl to go to the salad place and get everything but salad. 

They have a huge selection of toppings and dressings to put on your salad; I never end up with the same salad twice.  You can start out with undressed greens or go with one of their signature tossed greens like caesar asiago.  They even have deli salads (like tuna salad or pasta salad) for those who like some variation from greens.  I love that they have beets as a topping, they are my absolute favorite on salads. 

Personally, I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the ""premium"" toppings.  I think they're like, $2.50 extra each time you get a salad.  Some of the ingredients in that selection perplex me as to why they'd cost extra (like tofu, isn't it basically 90% water anyways? it should be free!)  Also, the last time I was there, they didn't have chicken available all day.  That made me a little sad since I'm a meat girl.  They didn't have a single meat item in the premium toppings selection.

Besides that, the non-salad items are also really yummy.  They have warm muffins, brownies, and deliciously heart-healthy seasonal soups.  Some of their soups (like the thanksgiving dinner soup they had in November) are really really delicious and I end up going back for seconds.  Their pastas, like the mac and cheese, are just okay, nothing spectacular.   I also like their drink selections, especially their yummy teas.

Overall, I like going to Sweet Tomatoes not only for the salad but for everything else.  The food isn't out of this world phenomenal, but it's a great healthy buffet spot for lunch & dinner at a very reasonable price.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,1,0,4,wTG-sR9NOK736TqgcsMDhg
