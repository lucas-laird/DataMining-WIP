The speaker at the drive thru is useless cuz u can barely understand the broken English through the crackling speaker. 

She got our order completely wrong! No surprise there! 

$3 for a taco? Try $4.50 when they add guacamole with out your knowledge. 

Nothing about this place is authentic. Bottled salsa and pre packages tortillas. Flavorless meat and guacamole.

Go in and you are first greeted by the staff who smile and say hi as they bustle through their food prep (they're also filling drive-thru orders). And you look around--the place has charm.

I had told my friends that, according to Yelp, the tacos were huge. The guy behind the counter was fixing one up. He saw us staring and held it up for us. He saw the awe in our faces. He smiled and said, 'Half pound of meat."" 

We got a variety of tacos in our party  (each of us only needed one). It comes half wrapped in paper like an In&Out burger, and it's good that it does. It's thick and full of juicy stuff piling out the back. I chose the carne asada--pretty awesome. My friends liked the agua frescas, too.

He is the reason I returned just to see what the place was about. 

We returned and ordered Carne asada nachos, a buche taco, lengua tacos, a pastor taco, watermelon juice, and mango juice.  I don't recall seeing the Carne asada nachos on the menu but when we asked, the same gentleman told us he could make it. Everything was fricken delicious! 

We eat lengua tacos a lot and this has to be the best hands down. The reason is because they cook two batches a day to
keep it fresh. At other taco places the meat sits there all day and night (eh hem Tacos Mexico), and soaks up the oil and just gets old. At Los Tacos, It just tastes so much cleaner without all that old grease and doesn't even need sauce. 

The Carne asada nachos had guacamole and salsa piled high and we finished every bite.  It was so good, the owner noticed I was dancing in my seat while eating (I didn't realize I was doing that) 

Love this place! And it's so close to home... The people that work here are amazing which makes it even better than 5 stars.",jOW3BGthCDL3l7Dd6AWZtA,0,3,5,E7u7OtEzmbU3Mzs2U7bJog

We ordered separately, my order and the kids were fine until it got to my sister's and my mom's order. My mom ordered for her tacos to have everything. Did they come out like that? Nope. So we went and told the cashier that we had ordered them ""con todo"" yet because the cashier didn't actually charge them like that she wanted to charge extra to exchange the tacos. An ordered they messed up. I've worked customer service my whole life I know how things work. Said no. Then the cashier can't recall her name but you can't miss her she has hickeys all over her neck and lashes full of glue it looks like it's been weeks since she last took them off. Anyway, since she did not just want to take care of us, the customers for something she was at fault for, we asked for our money back for those tacos. They were 6 tacos in total that we're suppose to be getting our money back. This girl comes back with okay you'll get your $4 dollars refunded and wanted us to act like we were okay with it. Absolutely fucking not! Each taco mind you is $3.50 plus $1.00-1.85 per taco depending if you asked for just meat or ""con todo""(yes you'll get charged 3.50 PLUS another dollar for getting just the meat) I asked to speak to the manager, but of course she wasn't there on a Saturday. Yeah okay! The hickey girl had to get on the phone with someone for us to finally get our full money back. It's ridiculous, when it could've just been solved by taking care of your customer and adding the extra stuff that we had asked for. We didn't even want the money back we just wanted the order right.

My coworker suggested this place for our Work Family Dinner, and we all obliged.

From the outside, it looks like your typical hole in the wall Mexican/Taco joint, but when you walk in, you are surrounded by a clean habitat for the most bomb-ass Mexican food ever.

I ordered one taco (cabeza...brain for you weaklings), and one quesadilla (chicken). Both were perfect.

The taco, perfectly cooked on fresh tortillas, surrounded by onions, and guac. The quesadilla was PERFECT!! Chicken that melted off the fork, and so much flavor, it was as if the chicken was born in the sauce and spices it was cooked in.

The ingredients were fresh and colorful, the carne asada was probably some of the  best I've had in a good while, and the presentation was just right. The burritos also looked amazing, but I didn't get to try that. The portions are also pretty great!

The aguas frescas they had were pretty fantastic, too. I got the strawberry first, and then another watermelon one for the road. Considering it's barely spring as I'm writing this, they tasted very nice! I would have expected they wouldn't taste very good because of the lack of availability of fresh fruit, but I was wrong again!

Portions are large as they should be for the prices. Tacos are massive and include meat, but any additional toppings are extra. The tacos are $3.50 base price, so if you add any toppings you're looking at $5 for a taco! Burritos are $6 and include meat, rice and beans, but additional toppings are also extra. I spent $23 on nachos, a carne asada burrito, a quesadilla and a medium drink.

We ordered al pastor nachos- which aren't on the menu. Now that I am looking at the menu again, I realize nachos are not on there at all, so ask for them. They were pretty damn good. The tortilla chips were a touch too salty, but not a deal breaker. They were fried fresh so they were still hot. The nachos had a generous amount of meat, cheese, guacamole and grilled onions, as well as sour cream and pico on the side per our request. It was only $10 and was enough for 3 of us to share. The burrito was good, but nothing to write home about. I added some salsa that was on the table and it kicked it up a notch. My friend got a cheese quesadilla for $2 and it looked pretty good, but he was still hungry afterwards. I would come back for the nachos, but I think I will stick to other less expensive places for my taco fix.

The BF gets a carne asada burrito with everything and it's amazing as well. 

I get the Strawberry Drink, it's awesome! Nice and refreshing!

The steak itself was cooked perfectly and was so freakin' flavorful. I was pleasantly surprised to see whole pinto beans inside of my burrito instead of standard re fried beans. The green salsa was OK- not great. In my opinion, spending $9.24 on a burrito and a drink was a few dollars too much. I like the fact that this place offers a drive thru, and will come back to try some other menu items.

2419850,2015-03-28,1,R7LyTeiOHLyTNkA8HssBRQ,"***Update***

I decided to give this place a second try since a friend kept raving about their food. The menu prices on the website are incorrect. The menu prices at the restaurant are higher. The tacos come here with beans. One taco is double the size of your typical taco. The cashier asked me what toppings I wanted. I asked for onions and cilantro. She said there's onions and cilantro in the pico. Um, OK. I've never heard of that before in a simple carne asada taco. Also, I asked for no beans. There's a $1 charge to remove the beans. WTF? It's not even mixed in together. 

They nickel and dime you for every topping. My two carne asada tacos and shrimp tostada came out to a whopping $16.22! If I ordered a drink, it would have been close to $20. I can understand if I was at a fancy Mexican restaurant but these prices are excessive for a casual Mexican place. The food wasn't good enough to justify the price. There was barely any seasoning with my meat and without my cilantro and onions, it wasn't the same. Also, I wasn't pleased with the paper thin slices of avocado. I can find better tasting tacos in L.A. for a lot less. 

So again, the cashier wasn't very friendly. The menus are not clear nor descriptive. Where are these toppings on the menu? Outrageous prices for mediocre tacos. No thanks. This place made me miss L.A. a lot.",TS4RfxKny-c8QYcnMpfkiQ,2,1,2,SfHPhR0XaDx8hK8Ghfl72w

The cashier was friendly and her customer service was amazing. We were pretty picky on what we want/didn't want on our tacos and she accomadated our order without acting like we were a bother to her. Menu was small and simple which was not a problem at all. You got your tacos, burritos, quesadillas, spanish rice, chips and salsa, nachos, and seafood plates.

My boyfriend and I got 3 carne asada  tacos, a side of chips and salsa and two drinks. Our total came out to be about $17. Kinda pricey for just tacos, small basket of chips and drinks.

Although the tacos were DELISH!!!! It looked like a gourmet taco with all the fixins'. You can choose to have beans, sour cream, avocados or cheese. The carne asada meat....let me tell you: the way its marinated and cooked, it reminded me of my Cali summertime BBQs at a mexican family get-together. (i know im not mexican but i've been invited to my mexican friends family get-togethers wayyy back in the days okay!?) The meat tasted fresh, there weren't any fat and it wasn't dried either. I didn't even need to put any lemon or salsa because it was packed with yummy goodness like my favorite: gucamole.

The space is comfortable, air-conditioned with benches and a pretty outdoor patio with ""bar chairs"".  There are 2 TVs showing Mexican channels.  Their tacos are about 1-2 dollars more than Tacos El Gordo (depending if you want the works) but man... are they worth it!!!  

Hubby had the carne asada plate which comes with beans, rice, tortillas, and vegetables.  He was happy with this, it was a substantial piece of meat, but I do wish it had more oil.  The salsa was good, as well as their nacho chips., then I had their shrimp tostada with avocado ($4.00) but man oh man it was soooo good!  And very filling.  I also tried their Al Pastor and Lengua tacos.  The Al Pastor meat is not as heavily seasoned as I'm accustomed too in other taco shops, and they serve their version with beans.  This was ok.  But the lengua taco.. that was mind blowing!!!  It had HUGE chunks of extremely tender and savory lengua (beef tongue) that is prepared and cooked well because it does not have a very strong gamey taste/smell like in other taco joints.   If you have not tried beef tongue, this is the perfect introduction for you.  The owner said they make the lengua batch fresh every day and never serve leftovers.

The food itself isn't that bad (at least some of it), but it's pricey. $3.00 for a taco. If you want sour cream or guacamole that's going to cost you extra. 

I ordered one carne asada taco, one al pastor taco, a cheese quesadilla, and a pineapple fruit drink. I tend to like my food on the mild side, so when I think something is bland, that means it's totally devoid of flavor. That was the case with their carne asada. It was hardly seasoned, if at all. The al pastor was much better. Tender pieces of pork with a little bit of a kick to them. Both tacos were large and overflowing w/ meat, onions and cilantro. Definitely enough to fill an average person up.

For the quesadilla you have the option of either a corn tortilla or flour tortilla. I went with the flour and the outside of it was perfectly crispy and flaky.

The pineapple drink was delicious as well.

It was $11.46 for the lunch, which seems incredibly expensive considering I could eat across the street at Los Parados for cheaper and get better food.

Pros:
  * Really clean interior / dining area
  * Incredibly tasty Shrimp Tostadas
  * they have Agua de Frescas!

Cons:
  * The Agua de Fresca wasn't too refreshing.
  * Salsa was mediocre
  
Tips:
  * If you are looking for silverware (or in this case it would be plasticware), it's to the back of the restaurant (assuming you are at the cashier's and facing the cashier register)
  *  The bathroom has a padlock, but they always leave it unlocked

I'm big on tacos and I must say, I'm a fan of Los Tacos.  They have some really good Tostadas and they have a pretty good selection of meet, including some of my favs:  Lengua (Tongue) and Cabeza ( Beef's Head).
Aside from Tostadas and the typical burritos/tacos, they also have Tortas.  The portions are pretty good and the price isn't the greatest, but it is far from being an expensive eat.  The tacos are overstuffed and looked amazing (my cousin ordered one).  The burritos were long and thinner than say a burrito at Roberto's, but the taste packed a punch for sure!  They have green salsa at every table (except the one I sat at.. ha, I had to snatch one off of a vacant table by mine), but it's far from being spicy.  Thank god my burrito came with a few chiles.  For a typical taco joint, I must say they take more time to assure they have a nice little presentation.  Sure the burrito was wrapped in foil, but next to it in the plastic basket lined with white paper was a small edible garnishment constructed of a few crunchy tortilla chips and a house salsa concoction.  The salsa itself had a weird taste, but nonetheless, I thought it was nice to see Los Tacos takes time to up the ante when it comes to presentation.  The Agua de Fresca here was not up to par in my opinion.  I'm a big fan of Melon (cantelope), which they had; but it was way too think.  I'll stick to Cardena's for my Melon fix.

Well if big deal status is conferred on those who spend half of their disposable income on a particular product.  Having established my credentials as such, I have to say I was highly disappointed by Los Tacos.  

The visit started so well.  The staff was friendly and I love being able to see them make the food right in front of you.  From there it started to slide.
I saw on the board they had tacos, burritos etc...standard taco shop fare.  Then next to it they have their different type of meats.  I saw tacos were $3.00 so I assumed that covered any type of meat so I ordered two with a soda.  The gal asked if I wanted everything on them and I said sure and then she said that'll be $11.64.  I did a double take on a scale that hasnt been seen since Cousin Larry on the 1980's show ""Perfect Strangers.""  I asked how it could be that much if tacos were $3.00 and she replied if you get them with everything it becomes close to $5.00.  I downgraded my order to one thinking this must be a pretty big taco for $5.00.  

Well the taco came and needless to say I haven't been this disappointed in size since Pam Anderson had her latest surgery.  I couldnt believe the size to cost, and the additional surcharge for the privilege of guacamole, sour cream and cheese.  The overall taco (I got the al pastor marinated pork) tasted just ok, but certainly it was nothing to write home about.  

There is so much taco greatness in the world, it'll be hard to get me to come back here.  I mean I will eventually because I always feel a place is worth a second shot and it wasnt terrible, just disappointing (isn't that what my dad said to me when he was made at me as a kid?).

When we saw the Los Tacos sign, I remember when this place was a Weinerschnitzel. Since I hadn't been there, it would give me something to yelp about.

I had a carne asada burrito. Most of the places have packages of chopped beef they throw on the griddle to cook it, this meat had charring on it and tasted like charbroiled steak, this burrito was delicious, very good. 

There were a few beans in the burrito, but not many, they certainly weren't using beans as filler, like so many places have decided to do. Some places put so much rice and beans in the burritos, the meat gets lost. I prefer a meat burrito, just meat with cheese, guacamole or salsa, with rice and beans on the side.

The size was medium, not too big, not too small. Some places make things larger, because some people equate quantity to value. A lot of mediocre, is still mediocre. I suppose it depends on why you're eating. If you're taking a break, to relax and enjoy the food, quality means more. If you don't know when you'll have your next meal, your primary goal is to store calories, then quantity would mean more.

If you like the carne asada burritos at Roberto's (which I do), you'll love the carne asada burritos at Los Tacos. 

I will definitely go there again and recommend it to anyone.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,0,0,4,5_OEXRNwF4dJqs9GNnVmWA

Tough one to call here. Needed a quick bit and out of nowhere come Los Tacos. Checked out the menu and the $3 tacos really sent me for a loop, so I went for a burrito (I don't know why I even tried NOT to eat one). 5$ and change nets you a 'rito, but it's only meat and beans. Guac, sour cream and cheese will run you an extra $1.50. If you can turn down that magical combo of toppings, you're a better man than I. End total was $7 and change. The 'rito result was mixed. It had just below average girth and solid length, which I think would make most people happy (although the rumor is women enjoy....). Anyway, it was solid. The al pastor wasn't the greatest, but honestly if you peep my pic, you can see that even below average meat was masked by the toppings. It was a good 'rito. Not great. Not 5-star.  3.5 star with a bump bc it had a drive thru. I'll go taco diving next time and report back... Wait....",NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw,4,4,4,bCxGJwPmwOD57LaHQecTdg

Here's the basic run down:

The tacos are bigger here and they cost more that Tacos el Gordo too. At $3.00 a taco WITHOUT the works on it. To have all the extra add ons it would be an additional $2 each. Here, I only had to purchase 2 tacos versus 4 at Tacos el Gordo (which ultimately comes out the same anyway). I don't know what kind of tortilla TeG uses, but I was disappointed to see that LT doesn't make their tacos. It was definitely store bought.

The taco breakdown:

LENGUA: I do like the lengua here. A lot ""saltier"" and ""full of flavor"" than TeG. You also get a bigger portion too. I personally like the lengua here more.

AL PASTOR: Also very good (i guess comparable to the ADOBADO i tried in TeG, but only because their both marinated pork). Super good, tender pork, and bold with a slightly sweet taste to it. 

Definitely a good off the strip location to go to if Tacos el Gordo is too overwhelming for you since it is on he strip and they have lines on top of lines.

My co-worker got a TORTA, and if you're wondering what that is, it's basically a sandwich version of everything else in a toasted fresh-like roll. It looks pretty good! If you are looking for something less messy and complicated other than a burrito...I'd say go for it.

Needless to say she got my order wrong, when confronted didn't apologize or offer to correct it. The gentle man behind the counter stepped in and quickly apologized and offered to let me have the incorrect item as a comp. Okay problem fixed no worries right? Wrong...  the cook threw it away but no worries I didn't care the gesture was all that matters. And that wasn't the only problem upon a close look at the receipt we discovered we were charged for every additional topping so our three dollar taco was more like five dollars and our five dollar burrito was closer to eight dollars and there was the wait.... over 20 minutes with only one person ahead of us.

3810770,2015-07-16,2,R7LyTeiOHLyTNkA8HssBRQ,"Now, this was a pleasant surprise!

I've driven by this taco place a thousand times and never once did I think I would try them.  ""Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of them places"", I told myself when I saw it the first time.  

Rewind few months back:  A friend mentioned about going on a social lunch at Los Tacos on Charleston but it never materialized.  There was never a follow up so it died a natural death.

Forward to July 11, 2014:  I forgot my lunch at home so I had to eat out.  I didn't have breakfast so I was beyond starvation and  I decided to hit  the very first restaurant or fastfood I would see on my way out, good or bad, costly or cheap.  As I was heading towards Sahara from CSN on Las Verdes, the blue Los Tacos sign was so bright and vibrant in the Las Vegas sun and was the first food place I saw. 

I walked in to a packed and somewhat loud restaurant with the aroma of the grilled meat welcoming me in.  There was a long line of people waiting to order, and waiting for their orders.  As I stood in line, I was trying to figure out how to order and what to order.  The people ahead of me looked like they're all returning customers because the line moved so fast and the people knew what to get while I was still looking around, like a  true green neophyte, and checking out what the people who were already seated were eating.  Before I knew it, I was in front of the cashier who greeted me with a friendly smile.  He handed me small servings of lengua and red sauce for me to try and me liked it.  I ordered a lengua taco and carne asada taco sin frijoles.  I don't know if it was the missed breakfast and starvation, but boy, they were good.  So, I went back in line and ordered Al Pastor Burrito and salsa/chips.  Suffice to say, they satisfied me to a T, and I was a happy camper.  

The lengua was seasoned and cooked just right and didn't have that weird ""it's not really meat"" aftertaste.  It was proportionately topped with chopped cebollas and cilantro.  And with their homemade salsa verde, it sure was a winner!  

Granted the price here is a bit higher than most, if not all, taco places BUT darn, its all worth it.  I've tried Tacos El Gordo when it was still on the strip.  They're cheaper (but not by much) and very good too but their servings would make you cry and scream at the men behind their counter for more.  I could easily chow down 6 El Gordo tacos even if i wasn't hungry, and still looked famish.  So, if you do the ""serving portion to cost"" ratio, it will end up pretty much the same, except Los Tacos will fill (and satisfy) you.  'nuff said.

Yelp in LV isn't like in the bay area or the northwest.

It was one of those days that I wanted a fat burrito. 
Cool thing is they can pan fry your burrito so that it gets crispy. However, the order was a bit more work for drive-through than expected. 

The standard carne asada burrito comes with beans, pico de gallo, and rice. I paid extra to add the triple mixing of sour cream, guacamole, and cheese. 

I'm not used to ordering a burrito that doesn't come with what I would think are the basics. 

Even with the additions, I'd give this burrito 2 stars. Decent, but far from good.

But no joke the last two times I've been there make me not want to come back. First instance was a week ago when I ordered a fish burrito and a shrimp taco like I've always done. As they gave me the food I asked for a plastic bag and when she went to give me bag my fish burrito fell onto the floor in the drive thru. So they said oh we'll replace that no problem. She comes back and tells me that they don't have any more fish for the night and that they can instead make me something else I told her I am a Pescatarian and I don't eat meat, seafood only. So she says how about a shrimp burrito and I said that's too much shrimp more then I would want in one meal and she says hold on. They give the food and tell me here you go don't worry about it. I didn't that much shrimp but she didn't get the hint that I wanted a refund for the burrito. So I go home and did not enjoy that much shrimp in one meal. Strike one. The second time something happened was today when I ordered the same thing again. I usually like this place so I had high hopes that a communication error was a one time thing. So I ordered the usual ""fish burrito, shrimp taco"" at this point the lady at the window tells me ""beef taco?"" I said no it's camarron. And she says oh ok camarron. Then I tell her FISH burrito. She says ""steak burrito?"" I replied, ""NO, FISH burrito FISH!"" She then says ok. I pay for the food, drive all the way home and what do I get a nice fat bite into a beef burrito. I spit my food out and called right away. The lady remembers me and tells me to come back in tonmorow because they're closed. I don't even have an appetite anymore and I'm honestly pissed Im dealing with this. I did not get full off of one shrimp taco and I threw the rest of the  beef burrito in the fridge so I can waste my gas to come back and show them I didn't eat it so they will give me a refund. I like the food here usually but atleast hire people who can understand orders so your brand image won't get tarnished. I love the food it's delicious but for something to keep happening twice in a row is ridiculous. Please get it together los tacos, one more strike and I won't eat here ever again.

When we got there we went through the drive thru cause it was empty and there was a couple people inside and decide it would be faster going drive thru. Anyway they took my order fast and we ordered 5 tacos. Got to the window and she charged us quickly and repeated the order of 5 tacos to us. Then the waiting game began. They did this last time to but I assumed they were busy. This time they weren't. It took 20 minutes for us to get out incorrect order of 4 tacos. 

Called Tony the manager and never once did he apologize. He said you have a receipt number. I said no and I wasn't going back either I just wanted to let you know what should be corrected for next time. And TONY never apologized or anything. So there won't be a next time.  

So yes tacos are good, but expect to wait very long for your small order and know that the service sucks and these people work with no sense of urgency. One girl was moving fast, but everyone else was moving very slow and holding conversations. Good managing TONY. Your amazing. Being very sarcastic.   LONG WAITS.

No thanks I'll gladly pay with cash but not with time. My beautiful curvy gf suggested we go next door. I'm learning to not second guess her and do what her beautiful mouth says. I had 4 tacos. 2 buche and 2 carnitas she had 2 carnitas and 2 asada. She couldn't finish the asada tacos. But because she was full. The tacos were amazing. Juicy and full of flavor. Awesome horchata and Jamaica. I would have given 5 stars but the workers kept staring at my lovely gf's yummy triple d's and the layout is awkward. U pay right next to where u wait for ur food so u crowd one area fast. Also it's pretty pricy for street tacos. 8 tacos and 2 regular drinks over $45,1neJ5xSyohY_VAMVsXYKPQ,0,0,4,xULLHW3uibiuX2loO_7EgA
