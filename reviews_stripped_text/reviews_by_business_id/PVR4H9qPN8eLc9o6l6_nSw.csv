We were seated quickly and our server was warm and friendly.   My husband had the whole mountain skillet, and he enjoyed it.  My scrambled eggs and ham were excellent, too.  For $7, it was a huge amount of food.

We will be back when the snow falls.",6YPQSBZrBSJMpj2rw6AScw,1,0,5,-cLJ-1jsksUyAlUd0vkIOA

I should have ordered a plate of fat instead.  Oh wait.....  I think I did.  Not a good place to eat.,YHUEtA46OVllu47TX4FKCA,0,0,1,q2jp8vXy-4S-001GwAad0Q

This place is not a four star location, two at best. We've been standing in line just to be seated for breakfast for 15 minutes and it hasn't moved since we got here. The food has been hit or miss in the past, hopefully it makes up for the wait today...",NcxVQhNlw219Grdp0yEP8Q,0,0,1,gQSHyVACT5nAkNKptDmVig

It wasn't busy not sure why it wasn't right the first time, but it was corrected.  We'll be back.",14X0M_AXbWS4yfuWzgc9HA,0,1,4,wpmSZvroN6SScjdKKp7tIA

I love coming to Mt Charleston to fresh air and pine trees and sitting in Cut Above looking at this beauty while savoring their awesome food. The service is great and their fresh seafood or steak dinner is superb! Give yourself a  break from the Casinos and enjoy nature and the best of food!",xfdlS4NPsI6tKoNIacGnUg,0,0,5,rTKeZYL_QQJFlFy4XaR9fw
