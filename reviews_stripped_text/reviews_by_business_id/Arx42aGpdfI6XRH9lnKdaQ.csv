I tried two different flavors of cookies and picked up a loaf of bread fresh from the oven.  The flavor of the bread is strikingly close to any yeast-based, raised loaf (very good).  They had brownies and other baked goods available as well.

The owner, Cris, is constantly refining her recipes and we're the lucky beneficiaries.  I got to ""talk shop"" with her for a few minutes, and her family have themselves been dealing with extreme gluten allergies (Celiac) for many years.  Thus, she's got the experience on what needs to be considered in prep and ingredients.  Customers should be able to relax and know you're in good hands with someone that isn't just doing this because ""gluten-free"" is something of a fad in some circles.

I have a feeling GlutenZero Bakery just getting started with her offerings, and they're going to be something over time.  I will, definitely, go back.",MnApC1cF4wqoYgNJCP0G2w,1,1,5,eEh9t0QxI-Hv4EM-X7u7dg

So good that everyone can enjoy these!  Without any hesitation I paid $4.99 for  Brownie Truffle cupcake with pecans. Size wise, larger than a cupcake. So worth the price.

The bakery/kitchen prep area is a gluten free zone. For those you who are gluten sensitive or diagnosed with Celiac Disease, I know you'll appreciate this. You don't have to be worried about cross contamination since this place specializes in gluten free baked goods. 

I can't to try Clarissa's trademark bread SafeBread. According to their website it's  a bread that is for safe Celiacs, Diabetics Autistics and Vegans.

3048094,2017-07-28,2,Arx42aGpdfI6XRH9lnKdaQ,"I was so excited to try this bakery after having my eye on it in my bookmarks for a while! I went in on a Wednesday early afternoon my way back to Salt Lake City and stopped to grab some treats for my long trek.

The store itself is huge and it is mostly made up of the bakery but you won't feel awkward coming into order things. The gentleman working greeted me as soon as I walked in. He was in the middle of prepping a bread to make. I asked him questions regarding what of the items were dairy free while still being gluten free. He told me about the cupcakes that were and then walked me over to the other counter area near the cash register that cased dairy free cinnamon roles.

The cinnamon roles looked AMAZING-- I was so tempted to try them but settled for one chocolate cupcake, and a carrot cake cupcake. The cupcake size is bigger than your average cupcake which I appreciated and the price was $7.98 for 2, making each of them only around $4 each, not bad! (Size wise each cupcake is realistically the size of two regular cupcakes or around 4 mini cupcakes.)

Everything is cased in refrigeration so you don't have to worry about them melting right away on your way home. He cased each cupcake individually and I tried one of them right away but liked them better when they had set to more of a room temperature. They were a little dry and crumbly but the flavor was good and the frosting was great!

I bake myself and while I never mean to be critical, I know that gluten free baking is one tough beast to conquer. Not to mention dairy free as well. I've had to mess around with different recipes to get texture just right on a lot of my baked items so I assume the moisture isn't an issue with the regular gluten free items but I can't say for sure. Either way it's a delicious treat that you couldn't have before that you get to enjoy!

While checking out the gentleman gave me their card and said to call them if I ever need a cake for anything. I'm guessing this is their biggest specialty, definitely considering the size of the space as well as being a specialty bakery that is probably where most their orders come from.

It was awfully quiet when I went in, and because I was the only one in there I feel like it seemed even more so. It wouldn't hurt to have some low key music or the radio on, just a thought to add some mood pleasing ambiance!",yU6NK_18CmCtHB7OetPkoQ,5,3,5,gVuHXbisAQbhIKXJ0Tf0Sw

This is a soft opening for this place the official Grand Opening will be in early June so maybe as they get things going better, they will look at using something other then pure cane sugar or even try making some items sugar-free.

The stuff here is good, there were only a few selections available but like I said, be careful because Gluten Free does not necessarily mean healthy, you will still pack on the pounds with all the sugar in the items they currently have.  Unless we see a change, this is a place we will not be back because sugar, especially at the content level in their products is not something we can tolerate.

As she personally explained to us, its gluten ZERO because there is actually a ton of additives and other products that have hidden glutens and none of her products has any of those.  I found her talk very educational and it was very useful.  I often write reviews comparing gluten free goods to other gluten free goods since there is a stigma that gluten free goods are generally not as good, but the chocolate chip cookies here are SO good compared to ANY baked goods, gluten free, gluten zero, or with gluten.  I love them.  They are a little crunchy but also soft and chewy in the middle and they have this nice taste to them and the chocolate has that ooey gooey feel.  So good.
There are some other items available but the other things we had were the lemon meringue cupcake, the carrot cake cupcake, and the brownie cupcake.  My friend really liked the brown cupcake who picked that, my other friend like the lemon meringue since that's his flavor.  I personally don't like those flavors so for me personally the brownie cupcake was too sweet and chocolatey, the lemon was too tangy and sweet.  But the people they were meant for loved them.  The carrot cake was a little dry and Chris told me to heat them up in the microwave and that would probably have solved the problem but I don't have a microwave, so I didn't get to experience it the way it was meant to be experience.

Not exactly involved in the diagnosis or management of Celiac Disease, but watching the trend of 'gluten free' everything take place from the perspective of a physician charged with assigning treatment to other autoimmune related conditions it was actually at the recommendation of a patient afflicted with both Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and biopsy-proven Celiac that a stop at GlutenZero Bakery off Eastern Avenue was planned, owner Clarissa and her son each busy preparing the days goods but delightful and forthcoming just the same.

In part a work of passion but also one of self preservation, the owner and her daughter each suffering symptoms for years before their own diagnoses, GlutenZero is a certified gluten free space in a repurposed former gym and admitting a great deal of expense invested in opening the place without yet catching on with the community at large it was with several samples shared that Clarissa discussed her process and practice, everything made in house with top-tier ingredients and even the Lichtenstein-leaning paintings on the wall produced by her hands.

Almost as expansive in selections as the space itself is in size, the front chiller filled with several styles of carrot cake while the rest are encased in glass near the baking area in back, it was first in a small spoonful of fresh, fruity Barbeque sauce that opinions began to form and although the German Chocolate was a bit more dense than some may prefer the flavor spot-on, the same to be said of a citrusy lemon curd cupcake stuffed with stiffly whipped cream that thankfully trended far more light.

Unable to pass up cinnamon rolls that were being glazed fresh from the oven before my very eyes, suffice it to say that unlike the springy curls of Glutton or The Bagel Cafe the version at GlutenZero eats more like a yeasty poundcake not-so-different than Cinnabon, though a touch more toothsome and far less buttery in taste.

Modesty impressed to this point, though still not wowed, it was next into the carrot cake that fork-and-knife were plunged, the first bite flooding the palate with sweetness and spice while subsequent tastes revealed textural variance amidst a substantial amount of moistness, the frosting tangy with cream cheese beneath a light dusting of ground nuts.

Told by both the owner and my patient that the chocolate truffle brownie was perhaps the best in town it was admittedly with skepticism that such a claim was assessed, but setting aside all prejudices related to rumors and dietary restrictions it would honestly be difficult to name any as decadent, both the flourless chocolate base and creamy ball atop it on par with plated desserts at restaurants despite far less expense.

****Doing very impressive things within the strict limitations of an entirely gluten free space one can only hope that there is a large enough audience to support GlutenZero Bakery through the early opening phases, I know I'll be back sometime soon to check out the pies and give the brownie another taste.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,17,17,4,kjYprab8mQ1YJ4YSO97J6A

5438302,2016-08-22,3,Arx42aGpdfI6XRH9lnKdaQ,"I was visiting from Washington state this weekend and was extremely excited when I found out about this bakery. The selection wasn't the greatest when we went and the owner said it was because they got 2 last minute cake orders and had to focus on those. 
We ended up leaving with a carrot cake cupcake with cream cheese icing, a brownie cupcake with truffle icing, a cinnamon roll, and 2 bags of chocolate chocolate chip cookies.
I was beyond excited to get home to try everything. 3 of us huddled around the counter and cut into the cinnamon roll first. We heated it up like the owner told us to and it was unbelievably dry. It was severely lacking in salt and had no taste. Even the cinnamon was barely there. It was bizarre. Parts of the roll were rock hard and others were so dry that they crumbled. 
Next we tried the carrot cake cupcake. The cream cheese frosting had too much butter in it so it tasted more like buttercream than cream cheese frosting. There was almost no cream cheese taste at all. The cake itself was very dry and was also lacking in salt. The cake was so dry that when we cut it up to taste it, parts of it fell apart completely to sandy little bits. 
We decided to tackle the brownie cupcake next. This one had more moisture to it, but just a small amount. It was still dry and lacked salt. I did like the truffle topping quite a bit. It was smooth and creamy and had a good chocolaty taste. It fell apart when we cut it, but wasn't as bad as the carrot cake. 
Finally we ate the cookies. Immediately I noticed that they were very spread out like they were over mixed or had too much baking soda in them. With the first bite I knew that it was too much baking soda. The outside of the cookie was very hard and the middle was softer, more like a good cookie should be. There wasn't much chocolate taste and the bite of baking soda took over everything else. We had given a bag of cookies to my sister and her husband and they didn't like them either. 
Overall, the bakery was a disappointment. For gluten free stuff the price of everything was actually pretty decent. But, the taste was just not good. Hopefully they can work on their recipes and this place can become great. But, right now its not a place I would ever go again.",0AkM2mEwOF2kDXEliSyVNQ,3,0,1,XquHtlW4YZWkYfkHpCjIxQ
