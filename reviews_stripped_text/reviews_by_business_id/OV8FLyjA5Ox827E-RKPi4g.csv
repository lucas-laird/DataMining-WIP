The only problem is when the drive thru is busy the cars back up into an area that blocks thru traffic. It can get a little cluster fu##ed.,cQgY_FTaw6bRJLVIpuJnRQ,0,0,4,sRd0rM9sELTqLcJgfztCaw

I'm a very polite person , and although my situation was horrible in my opinion I don't think I was rude other than a lil firm . I went to order through the drive through and apparently the guy couldn't hear me so I said my order louder. I get that. What I don't get is that once I'm done talking he says ""give me a minute "" so I did. After that minute he says ""ok so what did you say."" Excuse me? Why didn't you tell me you weren't paying attention to me in the first place , he must have been speaking to guest before me! That was rude . So then I said."" Can I just pull up to the window , to which he replies ""sure I guess (with a sarcastic tone)"" . At the window I asked him to repeat my order , he continues and I said ok , he says ""if you need a manager you can request one in the next window ."" First of all if I needed a manager I would have already requested one, second why would you say that ? That infuriated me . It was as if he knew he wasn't giving me the customer service and yet didn't care because someone else can speak to me and probably do nothing . I didn't say ok , I didn't say nothing I just looked at him as he closed his window on me. Upon second window I received my order and guy also seemed a bit rude , but I tried not to pay mind to it . I thought I was missing a breakfast burrito to wish he then asked for me to return my bags and receipt . Then he returned everything to me and said "" it's all the way at the bottom . I asked for more ketchup and hot sauce , he ignored me. I asked again , he hears me and only gives me 2 of each , I asked for more to witch he grabbed a bunch hands it to me and let's go right before I could catch it all and I lost it in the corner of my car seats . He didn't even apologize , instead he turns around . I said ""I just wanted to let you know the guy in the other window was a bit rude."" He then said "" I'll let my manager know."" That's it . I was furious . Not only was he rude as well but apparently no one cares , nor do they know a proper response . No customer service at all !!!!!! What's worst is I don't eat McDonald's ever, but today I'm in the must of my move and this happens . I know their names but won't burn them and that is only because I'm hoping it was just a bad day they were having , but by the other reviews I doubt it .",Dc4RrBfRJTnzU1_Ev00mzA,2,0,1,hS_GMt8kpaX9TX_mlGPeTw

I have two locations close to me but this one in particular is much closer and I will no longer be coming here and I hope neither will you! I used my debit card here and the cashier on November 1st was taking I thought a little too long with my card and she gave it back and I went home to eat my stuff. Now here is the part that makes me angry my card got hit at a circle k down the street of this location and the Home Depot that is close to this location as well. Coincidence? I think not! My bank is still pending on the investigation but I know when and where my card information got stolen. It doesn't take more than five seconds to slide my card and she took a considerable amount of time to believe it wasn't a coincidence. I am furious and wrote McDonald's but still no response so I give you this warning and I WILL NEVER STOP HERE AGAIN. I PREFER TO DRIVE TO THE OTHER LOCATION THAN THIS ONE!",EVzpYvuyhBPb9u2sS-YJeg,1,0,1,su76K4vbeLZoxbFZyr7LlA
