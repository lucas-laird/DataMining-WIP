I wish I could say something nice about this location. I have been trying to to find value at Carl's Jr. For more than 20 years! 

Tonight I had a coupon for a Buy One Get One free Famous Star. I asked for extra lettuce and tomatoes. I was charged 60 cents for lettuce and 60 cents for tomatoes for the two hamburgers. 

I was not happy when I got my meal. The lettuce and was an amount I would consider should be on  regular Famous Star. 

Each hamburger had two tomatoes. 
Wow! How generous. 

I asked for more tomatoes and lettuce. No luck. The manager would rather lose a longtime customer rather than give out two slices of tomatoe. Very short sighted customer service. 

I guess they don't really are about their customers satisfaction. 

So, with this event in mind I would like to recommend going to Jack-in-the-Box across the street: MUCH BETTER VALUE, and a lot cheaper. 

If, we stop eating at Carl's Jr, maybe they'll get the hint and develop a little common sense regarding value and customer service. 

Jack-in-the-Box thats where I am going!",BkidByf5jyDAy1oN2U4qyA,1,0,1,xyjSrru1mpDS8_idQ7LAzw
