15287,2008-09-08,1,b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag,"We ate dinner at Chin Chin on Friday night.  I wanted a variety of items and some kind of beef, but not a Prime steak.  We landed at Chin Chin for some good old Americanized Chinese food.  Since our last meal was breakfast we ordered up some chicken pot stickers, pork bao, half of a Hunan chicken, and Mongolian beef...and some steamed rice (more on that later).

It was all good.  The Mongolian beef was actually very good.  I am usually a little scared of the beef that ends up in Chinese food dishes, but this was very tasty.  

The Hunan chicken was a little tart for me, but it was nice and tender.  My wife loved it.  

If you are a char siu bao fan (yeah that is spelled a hundred different ways), don't order them here.  The filling was off and the dough of the bun was heavy and yellow.  My guess is that they were made a while before we ordered them and steamed up to serve.  By a while I mean at the day before...or earlier...

The portions are pretty good, so if you eat family style don't over order.  One dish per person is plenty.  

The prices were about $15 per entree, which isn't bad for a hotel on the strip.  Important note, rice does not come with your meal.  You have to order it by the bowl for $1.50 each or get fried rice.  That's kind of lame.  You really need to charge that extra $1.50 for a bowl of steamed rice?

Our server was a polite girl from some former Soviet block country.  Theek accent, but attentive to the table.",r1or_2ck3sylcZJJ9BX9ug,1,1,3,TB7nlX0n8_mWMItS4g6srA

The following email was sent to the management at Chin Chin. There was no response. I emailed the corporate office - still no response. Finally, I called ""food and beverage"" at New York New York . They contacted the Chin Chin manager and she called me say she regretted our experience. She also said she would add more meats next time. Too bad there won't be a ""next time"".   This is the email I sent:

While staying at NY NY in Las Vegas, my son and his girlfriend  treated me and my wife to dinner at the hotel. It was convenient and we were in the mood for Chinese food. To the point, it was the most disappointing Chinese food we have ever had. The Sushi was awful, the Chinese chicken salad was almost lacking of chicken - there was hardly any there. The King Pao chicken/shrimp[/beef was little more than a pile of chestnuts and peanuts. There were only a few shrimp, and a few pieces of beef and chicken. The tuna tartar was also disappointing. Our dinner was a sham. You are charging enough; you don't have to skimp with fillers. If it were just my wife and me, we would have walked out, but we were guests. In the end, you have 4 very unhappy customers.

Any other Chinese restaurant in Vegas would be better (and much cheaper) than Chin Chin.",5r8Yi2ypT-EMZoxldZkwCg,2,0,1,9fwFYA5Ky_3SjgI5iJW6eA

We sent them back and they reheated the ones we sent back.  I'm sure this is not allowed by health codes.  I ordered a salmon hand roll and it sat at the sushi bar for 10 minutes before I got it.  The seaweed was mushy so I sent it back.  The server was talking to another table and completely forgot about us.  Out of the 4 dishes we ordered they were out of 2.

I'm not a big sushi person so i can't say how they compare to most but as far as buffet goes I thought they were good. Lots of dessert options like cookies and pastries but they were all a little on the dry side. Chocolate covered strawberries were awesome and they had other fresh fruit.

The food was amazing and the service was incredible.  I was able to enjoy delicious sushi while my husband had some Chinese food.  The simple pleasure appetizer is a must as it gives a sampling of a little of everything.  The Volcano sushi roll was dynamite.  Pedro was our server and he was impeccable.  When we gave him accolades on outstanding service he was so very modest saying that he couldn't do it alone and that the cooks, bartenders, and even hostess do it all together.  After being in the service industry for many years, I was truly impressed!  Looking forward to our next trip back so we can visit this establishment again!!!!

My companion was trapped in the room for the next 2 days, dehydrated and too weak to travel. She could not eat at all, and we just stayed in. On the second day, I felt ill as well. This turned out to be a very expensive lunch, as the Doctor and the meds cost a large amount of money. So much for our vacation ! It was ruined, and we just left and drove back to L.A.. Since then (and it has been about 3 1/2 weeks since) Chin Chin management has not called back to discuss after I made reports to NY NY Risk Management Dept.

They have an incredible selection of the most popular Asian dishes, which is great for someone like me who can never quite decide what to order.  I was able to have a little of everything!  If you happen to be traveling with kids who aren't crazy about Asian food, they also have macaroni & cheese and chicken strips to keep the little ones happy while mom and dad feast on sushi (veggie rolls, Philly rolls and California rolls) and tons of Chinese favorites.  They have the stuff you crave as well as some really healthy choices if you've already put a little too much Vegas in your Vegas trip and you need some veggies.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, the dessert bar is incredible, too!  We will definitely be back!",qFxfejXThz-lH21VjACT0w,0,0,5,NwrG5src1jJ5S9b7z0t_jg

Mid grade hotel... Attempt at mass appeal acceptable. Mass appeal compelling volume-dining in Vegas.  Reasonably priced (but only for Vegas. Staff was friendly and attentive (+1 star).

Decent open kitchen, post modern copper and polished aluminum accents filled the walls and ceiling (+1 star)

We went for dinner and while the hostess was extremely nice our waiter left a lot to be desired. He didn't seem to be throughly impressed that he had to wait on someone (never smiled, never asked how we were). He took our drink orders, delivered them and then took our food orders. 
I ordered the chicken mushu and my friend ordered the Jean's Long Life Noodles. The food came out and while I was mixing my food together I saw a piece of plastic in my food. Most people would complain about it and send it back but I already knew our waiter could have cared less so I just decided not to eat anymore and pick off my friends dish (which was tasty by the way). Our waiter never came by to see how our food was (no surprise there) and never offered us a dessert menu, he just came by and dropped off the check. 
The funny part of this story is, when he saw me pull out a bunch of $100 bills he suddenly became extremely friendly towards us. I left a small tip for him (I used to work for tips as a blackjack dealer, so I sometimes feel guilty when I don't leave anything).

While roaming the Las Vegas Strip on our last day, we wanted to eat somewhere that was close to our comfort food. Being away from the island for about a week, you tend to miss food from there. In my case, my type of ""local food"" isn't a spam musubi or loco moco. I actually wanted to eat Asian food. Walking through New York New York after visiting the Hershey Store, I wanted to steer clear of the oily, fast food pizza and fried delicacies. 

Thankfully, one of the Chin Chin host/hostess were outside holding up their menu. Can't miss them. They are strategically standing right in front of the ""We're still open during construction"" words on the wall. We perused the menu and when the hostess said they mainly serve Japanese, Chinese and Dim Sum I was sold.

We walked with her to the entrance to the restaurant and waited a few minutes for a table to get cleaned. Our waiter Rob was really punctual and energetic. He showed us where the beverages were and the libation menu too. We settled for non-alcoholic drinks. Yes, I know....BORING but we were catching a flight that night and I still needed to pack. 

After contemplating the selections and reminding myself that my eyes were bigger than my stomach, we decided on the Szechuan Dumplings, Hot & Sour Soup, Pepper Steak, and Peanut Noodles. It wasn't long until our soup was sitting in front of us, waiting to be ladled up. This soup was delicious. Being of Asian descent, I feel like I'm a bit more particular on my ""Asian"" foods especially away from the motherland. The soup was the perfect amount of spicy and sour. It was very well balanced in flavor and we just wanted to drink it all up. 

Next on deck came the Pepper Steak. Now this might not be the most praised review on the Pepper Steak because I'm not a fan of bell peppers. This steak was oh-so juicy and the spiciness of the steak was minimal. There was so much bell pepper flavor that it overpowered even the onions. This was definitely my husband's favorite of the four dishes ordered.

The Peanut Noodles and Szechuan Dumplings were delivered at the exact same time. Let's talk dumplings! If you've had dumplings at a dim sum place, they are not usually covered in the sauce. Well, these were not your usual dumplings. The size of the dumplings were the same but these things were smothered in a cilantro sauce. When taking the first bite into the dumpling, you definite taste the cilantro but you also taste something sweet. Very unusual for dim sum. These babies were the highlight for me. Because of its unique taste, it will be forever remembered. 

The Peanut Noodles can be ordered with either chicken or shrimp but we felt like going plain jane with these. At first glance, the noodles glisten with the peanut sauce. Be careful of that first bite, it's thicker than it looks. If you want something filling, then order the peanut noodles. They will quickly fill you up but only order it if you love peanuts and or peanut butter. That is really what you are eating. These weren't that spicy. I think if you can stand a little heat, like a tease of heat then you should be ok. 

It was great discovering this new restaurant on the strip. I can't wait to go back and see it after the construction/renovation. Be daring, be bold and try Chin Chin.",b55p0Ga74GiedqtrLbWIFg,4,1,5,TKnYJS1mM2f7UmuiZM-QZQ

Well, unfortunately I wasn't wrong.  I went with the Chinese chicken salad because that's their ""famous"" dish.  It was OK but nothing special.  They were super stingy on the amount of chicken, and the ginger dressing was a bit strong.  The har gow (shrimp steamed dumplings) were horrible.  They were some of the worst I've had as they were really soggy, the dumpling skin was too thick, and the shrimp was unidentifiable and overcooked.  And to add insult to injury, I was super thirsty after my meal.  If they're going to use MSG so liberally, why doesn't the food taste better?

The prices are very, very reasonable ($7 for pork buns, $6-10 for sushi rolls), and the food is top notch. The service is also great. I was nervous about making a 9:30 show across the street at MGM, sitting down to dinner with eight people a little after 8 p.m. We made it back across the street in plenty of time, and the waiter even courteously split our checks. 

Word of warning: I'd stick to the sushi and the dumpling-type stuff. The traditional Chinese food here is just average. That's why it gets four and a half stars instead of five. The sushi and the dumplings, on the other hand, are really good.

The first time I went, I got the mongolian beef. Total meh. People who got other, typical Chinese food (lo mein, fried rice, etc.) had similar experiences. 

Came back this year and wised up, ordering a spicy tuna roll, some hot and sour soup and the chin chin bao. All of it was top notch. Their spicy tuna, especially, is among the better sushi I've ever had. I tried a little bit of other people's varieties (shrimp tempura, some specialty rolls) and they were really good, too. The Chin Chin bao? Wow. Three puffy, steamed pork buns that pack a delicious barbecue flavor, served with a REALLY spicy wasabi mustard (good if you're in to that, my spicy food loving friends tell me) and a tasty chili sauce for dipping. The buns really fill you up in a good way -- definitely enough for a meal with just them and the sushi. Had some open-faced dumplings that were really good, too. 

For ordering two sushi rolls, you get a sizeable jug of hot saki -- a nice touch. They also knew how to make a good Manhattan, though their bourbon selection was limited. I'll definitely be back if I come back to Vegas. Not only is the sushi a nice, light compliment to other heavy meals I'm likely to have, the prices are very low by Vegas strip standards.",RFbj8JUofEbAmfF2x29GXw,1,0,4,puRPRpc4s38qQOYzS5bxYQ

My friend had the cashew chicken which was good, but lacked flavor. Had to add soy sauce to dish to eat. Really good food should never need a condiment. What brought this review to 2 stars were the delicious egg rolls. They were awesome. But unfortunately the bad tasting chicken left a horrible taste in my mouth. Would probably not go back.

Though we were in a dilemma we wanted to have our meal there, and thus went. Not being sure of the taste there we wanted to be on a safer side instead of experimenting. So we ordered a chicken fried rice. Trust me when I say this that this was the best chicken fried rice I have ever tasted in my entire life. Best flavour with best ambience and best hospitality staff. Its been almost 3 months that I had this meal and I still cherish it. Amazing food! I admit that I dint try other dishes but am sure that the restaurant has good flavours in the air. A must visit when you go to vegas! And yes the price was very reasonable.

One of the chairs was broken and when my wife sat down a piece fell off, the chair shifted and pinched her hand to the point of drawing blood.  Never a good start but it did go better after that.  The staff was sincerely mortified and got us the requisite bandaids and towlette.

So on with the meal ( a little blood is not gonna get between us and Sushi).

We ordered entirely from the sushi bar so I can't speak to the Asian fusion kitchen.  We ordered 4 different rolls and some Hamachi sashimi.
The Hamachi was fresh and fileted into elegant ribbons.  It looked so beautiful I almost felt bad about eating it.  Until I took the first bite.  After that it could've been the Mona Lisa and and I would've scarfed it down frame and all.
There was not a bad roll out of the 4.  The rice was spot on Sushi grade.  Crisp veggies and fresh fish.  The flavors were carefully balanced to keep the focus on the ingredients rather than bury them in sauces.  
Service was outstanding ( but the whole bleeding thing kinda makes for attention afterwards).
I don't normally do desserts  (just not my thing).  However, they brought us complementary cheesecake and chocolate cake by way of apology.  I don't tolerate sweets well and these were so rich and decadent I was only able to do a few bites.  Well, I may not like sweet and rich but for those who do I highly recommend both.  I'm quite sure the cake will be outlawed once the government finds out about it.  It is the opium of desserts.
They do need to pay closer attention to the condition of their furniture.  They are aging and honestly we had a sense of humor about it but it could have been really not funny.

But if you find yourself needing some, this is probably the best and only alternative within the hotel.  Located right in front of the New Yorker Tower is Chin Chin.  Now it can be a bit confusing to see the name then to also notice the sushi bar inside is kinda confusing... so you would think this place is fusion themed but it's not.
Service was great!  Our waiter knew to match our vibe and he was spittin out jokes and was pretty entertaining.  
Onto our dishes:
Sweet & Sour Pork - Very good!  I actually found myself eating the veggies more than the pork which is unlike me.  The veggies were fresh and crispy!  Just the right amount of sauce and rice is oh so good!
BBQ Pork - Always a favorite of mine.  This was juicy and tangy just how I like it.
Tsao Chicken - This is always a crowd pleaser.  The tanginess and tartness of this dish just goes so well with any rice dish.  Probably my favorite dish of the bunch.
Shrimp Fried Rice - Talk about an abundance of shrimp.  There was literally 2-3 shrimps in every spoonful!  
So I give this place a solid 3 stars.  For the location and convenience, it's definitely something to consider.  The price for each dish ranges from $8 - $15 which is reasonable given you're in a Las Vegas hotel.  If the portions were only a tad larger, then this would've been 4 stars.",Ritx0fV0kg8Y86keCU3Glw,2,1,3,sclHHwV5sJCRZWoBTRkA4w

Chinese chicken salad, chicken potstickers, wonton stars. We only ordered apps since we got full off drinks and sushi.

Chow mein with crispy egg noodles and pork: Actually had to send this dish back because it was so horrible. It's like they took the noodles straight out of the container (instead of frying it crispy) and put the pork/veggies/sauce on top. The staff took it off my bill, which I appreciated. 
Fried rice with pork: The darkest fried rice I've ever seen, with a lot of sauce! I've never had so much sauce in fried rice before. Also surprised that they didn't put any veggies in the rice...just pieces of pork and egg. Tasted okay. 
Mongolian beef: Again, so much sauce! The meat slices were too thick and chewy. The white crunchies underneath were a waste.  
Orange chicken: The most edible dish of the night. Good chunks of chicken and veggie 
pieces. But the dish was lukewarm, like all the other dishes I had that night.

The Vegas one is slightly different that it keeps up with the buffett theme of Las Vegas. This one offers breakfast/ brunch buffett for around $14/ person, from 7/7:30 to noon-ish. if you can get up that early while you are in vegas, or perhaps you haven't gone to bed yet, the buffet isn't bad. Very simple, not too exciting, and variety is rather limited, but you get your brunch staples- scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs with duck, bacon, sausage, duck, bbq pork (chinese style), some potatoes, noodles. I actually prefer this to the $25 brunch buffett at MGM or similar casino. It's cheaper and i can never my $25 worth of food at 10:30 or 11 in the morning. And the food here is actually good. I like their duck scrambled egg, and their spring rolls and dumplings are yum too.

The line can get long, and with limited seats/ space, you can wait a bit. But people eat and go- so you are maybe made to wait for 30 min at most. And my other complaint would be you have to be in line to get your food, and since there is only 1 line of buffett trays, once you are done, you have to go back to the end of the line for round 2. It reminds me of being in the school cafeteria a little.

First, I would like to say I am extremely disappointed at myself for not paying attention at the hints for an extremely horrible breakfast. 

TIP #1 Breakfast Buffet at a mediocre Chinese Restaurant
Tip #2 Fried Rice as part of their breakfast menu
Tip #3 pastries that i saw them un-package from a Costco type package.

No i didn't take any of those hints as a clue to what was in store for me. 

The Food- They serve the usual breakfast fare. Eggs, bacon, sausage, and french toast. To accompany those types of food they have fried rice, bbq pork, assorted fruits and potatoes. The breakfast was so sub-par, so unseasoned i couldn't eat more then one plate. I even asked for cheese for my scrambled eggs and they said they cant give me that... REALLY... REALLY?!

The Price- Everything they serve you can get at a Days-inn that is included with the price of the room. It is $12.95 a person. With that price you can go to Hash House a gogo and get quite honestly the best breakfast in Vegas for the same price. Hell you can go to Circus Circus breakfast buffet and get better. At least they have omelette's and  toast. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TOAST HERE! Silly me to think that a breakfast buffet would serve toast... silly me.

So I'm giving this place one star, If i could i would give it 1/2 but i can't. I honestly can't believe their are restaurants out here that have the audacity to serve such sub-par, and un-edible food at such a outrageous price.

We came here because it was in the hotel we were staying at, and I was in the mood for noodles. 

We started off with an awesome server, who took our drinks order. We got a bottle of sake and perused the menu for what we wanted. About 6 mins later a guy appears and said he would be our server because her shift had ended. 

I ordered the Pad Tai and was pretty disappointed- the flavors were to citrusy which is not what I am used to, it's generally a more savory or spicy kind of dish. The dish also lacked shrimp. However, there was an abundance of chicken which I could have done without. 
When I explained to my server that I was not happy he seemed very nonchalant about it then told me if I wanted more shrimp it would be extra. I did not add more shrimp since I felt a bit turned off by his attitude.  

When he came back and saw me taking the chicken off my plate, moving things around on the dish to try to make it better he offered to take the chicken away. I ended up giving my chicken to my boyfriend. I barely finished my Pad Tai; it was too intense for my palate. 

Normally, I hate writing a review like this, but this was one of those situations where my server could have changed things around by rectifying the situation. Plus a better attitude could have gone a long way. 

Maybe this isn't the norm for these guys as far as food and service, my boyfriend enjoyed his dish, but I don't think we will return. At least  I enjoyed the sake!",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,1,1,2,DlHfqc_Y2LzMRbyxGpskoQ

Unfortunately, the Las Vegas version is not up to the same standards.  

Judging just the food - I ordered a steamed fish entree.  They insist the fish was fresh - not frozen but I don't believe them.  The fish appeared cooked on top but the undersides were grey and cold.  I can't imagine any way this could happen unless the fish was frozen.  I returned it and they removed the charge from my bill, but I lost my appetite after that.

Our one order of dim sum was the shui mai.  They were huge - cooked to order so we had to wait - but it was worth it. The lettuce wrapped chicken was typical of nearly every Chinese restaurant I've been in.  Nothing special.

Service was a bit unprofessional. I think they could cut out the socializing between the wait staff and concentrate on providing better service and a better product. Our tab was in the $135 range including tip - before the credit for the frozen fish - for two, so I think it's fair to compare Chin Chin's service to other restaurants in this price range. If you like being called ""you guys"" by the wait staff - this is your kind of place.

As soon as I got there I asked for a booth -- they claimed they didnt have any although I'm pretty sure I saw some open in the back.  So I took a seat at the bar anyways, which I didnt really like because it's such a public area the way it's placed, with everyone walking by through the casino right next to me while I'm trying to eat.  

First thing I do is look at the drinks menu -- only  a handful of cocktails with even less that look appealing. I ordered the lychee martini, and as it turns out, they can't make it because they stopped making the lychee liquor.  Alright. Well somehow tons of other restaurants still manage to serve these,so whatever. I ordered another drink in which I could taste the vodka way too much.  

Then I ordered the cream cheese wontons.  The server comes back a few minutes later, and guess what, they don't have that either.  Alright, fine, I order gyoza instead.  Surprise surprise -- the server returns again and let's me know that they don't have gyoza either.  In fact they dont have any of the fried dim sum.  At an Asian restaurant. At 630 in the evening.  Seriously? They aren't apologetic about it at all.  I was pretty nice about it, albeit rightfully disappointing, which they didnt seem to appreciate for some reason.  

So I went ahead and just ordered the crispy honey shrimp. I order that a lot at Elephant Bar, and it was pretty good here but not comparable.  The quality/texture of the meat was weird.  It seemed...dry?  I'm not sure how to explain it.  It was a

I have a gluten allergy, and they have an entire section of their menu without gluten! They have a chicken dish, gluten free, that wasn't that great. The spring rolls had a lot of basil in them which overpowered the flavor. So at first, I was a little worried about what was to come. 

However, their Mongolian beef made up for all of it! I swear it had crack in it. Perfectly cooked, not too sweet, not too many onions, just great. I could eat it any day! They also had gluten free crab and asparagus fried rice. Now, it comes without any real sauce, but they give you GF Soy sauce. Even without the sauce it was great! We couldn't stop eating it! Not greasy, totally hit the spot. They also had a noodle dish that was good too -  a little greasy, but slightly crispy noodles with a light sauce + beef. Yum.

So on my recent trip to Las Vegas (The Meadows for all you newcomers) I stayed in a fun filled hotel called New York New York.  There are three separate tower elevators to get up to the rooms.  You are assigned an elevator based on your room.  I think I cried and wet myself all at once to see that right before our elevator was CHIN CHIN!

I ordered a Rainbow Roll and some Yellowtail. The yellowtail was alright but I was disappointed there was no roe. The Rainbow Roll was terrible!!! I'm used to getting at least eight decent sized peices out of a roll and for there to be healthy chunks of albacore inside the roll. Not here.

I ended up eating most of the rolls because I was hungry but toward the end, I picked the actually fish off the top.

I had eaten here for dinner a couple years ago and would have said it was A-OK.  You're looking for Chinese food on The Strip at a restaurant and it's not like there's lots to choose from. There's the chain PF Chang's (which is better than Chin Chin actually) at Planet Hollywood, and Pearl at MGM (which is a lot more expensive and you get less food), but not a whole lot else. 

On my recent visit, I was trying for a lunch under $20 and it's possible here.  Many of the dishes are about $13, like the Chicken Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce.  It was ok, I've experienced better, but it's not like I struggled to eat it. I'm a critic of noodles these days, so accepted them for what they were.

As for the har gow I ordered for $8.25 (you get 5 of them) it was the worst dim sum I've ever had.  I don't think I've used such terminology in a review before.  I know I was spoiled in SF Chinatown the other week, but this tasted nothing like dim sum.  I couldn't believe it, it was pretty terrible to the point it's hard to describe it.  It almost had a sweet taste to it, and not in a good way.  Major regret, I would've been better off just getting the noodles (and would have managed to get out for less than $20) but when I see dim sum on the menu it's hard to resist.

After having that, there's nothing I could do now but resist it.  I'd tape my mouth shut to prevent it from ever getting into my mouth again.",fG-K5NglgWxHg8PNu62afg,3,0,2,f-kLjeMaGZVZaiYiqXkNGQ

The variety of food was good and the quality is on par with Panda Express. The entrees included Kung Pow Chicken, Beef & Broccoli, General Taos Chicken with soup, rice, egg rolls, salad, 4 types of sushi rolls and a variety of dessert items.

were on our way to breakfast, when we passed by here. 

They had a breakfast buffet going on, and the friendly hostess suggested we go take a look. We did, and immediately decided to check it out.

The buffet was way nicer then any buffet we had on this trip. Everything was presented very tasteful and upscale. Very fresh, and nicely presented. 

They have over 50 items including - red velvet pancakes, lychee fruit, sushi, French toast ect. A combination of both traditional brunch items and Asian food. If you come just as breakfast turns to lunch, you can experience both. You can also order a la carte off the menu if you prefer. 

We liked it so much, that we ate here three times during our stay at NyNy. The service always was stellar ! Very friendly, courteous servers and cheery upbeat hostesses.

Wij hadden een appetizer platter. Fors qua omvang, allemaal met kip en redelijk van smaak. Beetje flauw. Frituur smaak overheerste. 

Lief had een eend op rode curry en ik een noodle gerecht met kip. Wat opviel waren de grote porties bijtgare groenten die bij beide gerechten zat. Dikke plus. Eend zag er droog en onappetijtelijk uit. Grijs. Maar was onverwacht smaakvol en zacht. Curry was goed op smaak. Noodles waren prima. Kip was wat klein en ver te zoeken. Zeker gelet op de grote brokken groenten, maar voor mij geen probleem.

I have never been to this restaurant and was already expecting it to be on the pricey side since it's Vegas. Everything is overpriced. Anyways, they had a deal going on buy 2 sushi rolls, get the 3rd free. We figured that would be good so we ordered a dragon roll, rainbow roll and a lucky seven roll along with a dim sum appetizer called the assorted pleasures dish.

The appetizer came with 2 chicken pot stickers, 2 fried chicken wontons, 2 gift wrapped chicken pieces (chicken wrapped in foil w/cilantro) and a spring roll cut in half. The waitress brought out some dipping sauces. One of them was an apricot sauce that was similar to duck sauce which tasted amazing. I dunked the spring roll and pot sticker in that. The chicken pot stickers and wontons were both pink on the inside. I don't think the pot stickers were thoroughly cooked.

When our sushi came, all 3 rolls were on one plate. That only meant one thing: the rolls were tiny. And they were itty bitty. Don't get me wrong, the sushi was delicious but these rolls are priced out between $12-18 dollars. They were almost the size of a quarter. I hate to sound like a sushi snob, but I've had bigger rolls for less than $15 and of awesome quality. Well, what do you expect? It IS Vegas after all.

I had the veggie lo mein, my wife had the peanut noodle dish. Both dishes were very fresh, not heavy on the sauce, and the noodles were the freshest I've ever had at any Chinese place. The veggies in the lo mein were perfect. Not overcooked, not undercooked. I could have just had broccoli in it. The peanut dish was ""spicy"" and had a great sweet tangy flavor. The food is very Americanized, so don't expect authentic...buts its on the Strip, what can you expect. 

Our dishes were $14 and $13 respectively. The portion size of each would have been good for us to split. This would have been nice to know, and will be helpful if we go back. Since we were seeing a show after dinner, we didn't want to get a doggy bag. 

My wife also had two cocktails - malibu and pineapple. They were $8 each. I had a Tsingtao bomber which was $8 which was actually not a bad deal.

Every item was just OK, nothing stood out other than few.

I didn't feel like paying 3 times as much for food that got worse reviews than this chain.  I'd been to the one here in Southern California and knew we'd have a good meal.

And we did!  The reservation we made was necessary on a Saturday night, but I think we called an hour before hand.  We both got drinks off their signature list.  They were strong, like we like em'.  I got the orange soda one and loved it!  They also have a full bar, naturally, Vegas...as well as a pretty good Sake list.  

The hot and sour soup was a perfect starter.  I hadn't had it since my favorite, family owned, place down the street from me closed, probably because of their C rating, but that didn't stop me...they had a B when I started going there.  Anywho...it was good if not better than the homemade stuff they made.

Our dishes came out fast, which normally isn't a problem, but we were trying to kill time.  Again, it's a Chinese food place, food usually doesn't take that long to cook.  Both our dishes were delicious.  I got the 3 meat kung pao.  It wasn't as spicy as I normally like it but the chicken, beef, and shrimp mix was excellent.  

My girlfriend got the orange chicken and I was kind of upset I didn't either. I'm a sucker for it, and they did an excellent job.  Perfect amount of crispy, it's breaded, but not soggy.  Gah! I hate soggy Chinese food.  The peppers were fresh and tasty as well.

And you know how most hosts try to walk way in front of you and you almost have to sprint? They were actually mindful of me and walked beside me. I felt like they made an excellent first impression and my service began memorable. She even pulled out my seat. (Whaaaat) lol I know! 

The server was top notch! His name was Pedro and he was on top of it. Very very energetic! My glass was never halfway empty, my table was manicured the entire time, and he sold me on desserts! I am on a diet!

They had a hostess from Hawaii that had great conversation etiquette and was very entertaining, the servers were extremely hospitable, and the food was delicious. Between the soup and that lemon chicken I had to leave with leftovers because it was soooo filling. 

I would say the Lemon Chicken took the win. It was placed on a bed of cabbage (which I'm not personally a fan of, but I get the hype). The lemon sauce that came with it was to die for. I literally DRENCHED my chicken in it after a test taste. No regrets. 

They were really up front that the sides are a la carte which I appreciated, but I do with it AT LEAST came with rice. I get buying alternative sides, but rice is a staple. It should be included in a $17 plate of glorified lettuce and a single breaded chicken breast. I'm just saying.

He asked us if we wanted something else instead, but how would we know if we no longer had menus in front of us?
SO,  we asked to see menus again.  He totally forgot and we had to remind him twice to bring us menus.  (We did order one sushi roll which was pretty decent).

And as I start exploring Vegas, my new home more and more, I will discover new gems, and I promise I will find great new places to write great reviews about. Until then, there's Chin Chin. 
I love walking the strip, as I have many medical problems, and it's like physical therapy for me, but I hate paying ""strip prices"". My husband had already just had pizza, but having an allergy, we had to find a bite for me, and it being late, we had little choices. We walked up to Chin Chin, and the hostess with the mostest greeted us and struck up conversation. I explained that we moved here, and being that we were now locals, were were not looking to spend a whole lot, and were looking to avoid the tourist pricing. Well, she did some voodoo on us, and we found ourselves sitting down. Seeing that the restaurant was pretty established, having locations in Beverly Hills, Studio City, Bentwood, and West Hollywood, CA, I felt pretty comfortable with that. I looked over the menu, and couldn't find anything that was in the price-range of someone taking a stroll and wanting a bite- maybe she didn't get the point of the 5 minute conversation we had before she seated up. I went ahead and ordered the Spicy Seafood Noodles, and truly hoped for the best. While I waited, the party next to me seemed to be enjoying their food, but they were pretty pissed drunk, and ordered what I wanted to order, but went against my better judgement,and went with the servers recommendation. 
When the food arrived, I was shocked the my $18 meal was just splashed into it's bowl, as there were 4 pieces of veggies stuck to the upper part to the rim. I'm not picky...okay, yes I am. How hard is it to take pride in what you put out of your kitchen, because it looked like crap. Now onto the food. It was okay. It reminded me of the Chinese/Korean dish, you find in many authentic Chinese restaurants (I reviewed one restaurant that served it that made their own noodles and charged $7 less called Chef Ping) called Jjampong. Yes, they were not the same dishes. The dish I ordered was a spicy black bean sauce, while jjampong is a fragrant red sauce, but they are very similar in other ingredients. The dish by Chin Chin was one note, and salty, and by the end of the dish, I was craving something more, and a glass of water. I was left very unsatisfied, and while there were an ample enough seafood in the dish, there was not enough calamari, maybe 2 pieces, and they didn't seem very fresh. All and all, I will not recommend, and will NOT spend my $18 on a dish that I could potentially get for half the price in Chinatown for half the price with twice the flavor. I thought I would get something of decent quality from a place that is established off the strip. Plus like I said, it was late, and I didn't have many choices. One, and one last thing. I know it was late, but the place was not closed, but was coming close to closing time, but it was not excuse for the lacking service we received, that just added to the disappointment.",tmKWLnQZ28a7atm8U1O2Eg,1,0,2,4FEGY694Lilmbk1zvDxsfQ

I hate that it takes forever to get a check considering that everyone orders everything they can possibly order within 30 seconds of being seated. I've ordered coffee and your 16 dollar plates of dry eggs, fatty bbq pork and undercooked fried rice, what the hell else can you possibly charge me for? Just bring the check and get rid of the pretense that I'm somehow sitting down for a real meal in an actual restaurant. 

Oh yeah, and about the breakfast buffet fried rice? I'm onto you. Fried rice is traditionally made with cold day old rice that's had a chance to let the starch set up so it doesn't turn to mush when fried. You're trying to get around this by undercooking fresh rice, but it doesn't work. It just comes out a little crunchy and unpleasant in the center. I couldn't tell if the lump in my throat was barely edible fried rice, or tears welling up because I was forced to eat here again after working until 2am the previous night.

After trying the other breakfast options I ended up getting this bacon fried rice for 4 days. That says all I need to say about the other breakfast options. 

If, for whatever reason you end up here for breakfast just pile a bunch of scrambled eggs on your plate, cover liberally with ketchup and call it a meal. It's really the only sane way out.

Back home, pot stickers are served with a soy-based sauce with ginger and green onions at room temperature.  I had vegetables in a curry sauce and my son had pork lo mein, all of which would have been delicious were it not for the high sodium content. 

The manager on duty took our concerns very seriously and took appropriate action. 

I do hope they take a look at their recipes and consider using considerably less salt. I'm sure they've got some talented folks working in the kitchen.

I went more with the sushi selection as they look really Yummy.  One item that really was tasty was the NEO roll it was sooo good it was like something put of the Matrix!!! Probably named after Keanu Reeves character lol. Good portions of food and bang for your buck meals cant go wrong.  Definitely will be coming for some eating repeats.

When we arrived, there were not many seating options available and we were placed at a tall table with chairs that did not have a back. Typically, I would've asked to be seated at a booth or lower table, as I find the tall tables and chair with no backs uncomfortable; however, I did not want to be difficult since they didn't have other seating options available. 

Our waiter came up to our table promptly to give us menus and take our drink orders. He was friendly and patient with us as we waded through their huge menu. Their food menu is very extensive, which made it a difficult decision for us! The drink menu has good selection as well. 

We decided to start off with their shrimp tempura roll. It was a good size and tasty as well. For our entree, we chose to split the crab and asparagus fried rice. First of all, I thought this was such a creative take on fried rice and one that I never would've thought of. Second, omg! Thank goodness we decided to split it because the portion was absolutely HUGE! My boyfriend and I each ate quite a bit of it and still had at least another good serving of it left.

What made it even better was our waiter, Jordan.

5739864,2012-09-04,1,b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag,"Let's be honest - nothing in Sin City is cheap. For Vegas travelers on a budget, finding an inexpensive place to eat can be tough. 

During a trip to Las Vegas for the 2008 CES, my parents and I had dinner at Chin Chin at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino one night. The three of us agreed on this place as we had been looking for some Chinese food for some time. The prices were generally lower than those of other eateries in the area, so it seemed like an attractive place to eat. 

Unfortunately, the low prices were just about the only good thing about the restaurant. For starters, many of the dishes were over-seasoned. Case in point, the fried rice was extremely salty as it was literally drenched in soy sauce. The other items we ordered also had similar problems, and it was rather hard for us to eat the food as we prefer lighter tastes.

The three of us also ordered some raspberry mousse cake for dessert. This, too, turned out to be a mistake as the cake seemed to be extremely heavy in fat and sugar. It was actually so greasy that it caused me to lose my appetite the following morning. I had split the slice with my parents, but even that didn't seem to help.

The quality of service was not impressive either. It took the waitress five minutes to bring us the dessert menu, even though there were few other guests. After we ordered the cake, it took another five minutes for her to bring it to us despite it being a pre-made item.

On the whole, I would not recommend this place. I understand one can't really judge a restaurant with a single dining experience, but my impressions are telling me to stay away from Chin Chin in the future.

-- TL;DR version --

Highs: Prices are relatively low
Lows: Slow service; food is over-seasoned and greasy
Bottom line: You get what you pay for in Vegas. Low prices aside, there are better options.

A large Hot & Sour Soup with shredded pork, carrots, green onions, tofu, jalapenos, and egg that I consumed myself was very good, and slightly crisp Chicken Spring Roll wrappers were good, but the insides were just okay and not very flavorful.  I had to keep dipping the deep-fried morsels in Sweet & Sour Sauce to enjoy some taste.  From now on I will stick to Vegetable or Shrimp Spring Rolls.  

Shrimp with Garlic & Snow Peas featured good-sized, succulent shrimp, tasty snow peas, and small mushroom pieces, but I could have done without the carrots, and would have enjoyed a delicate crystal White Sauce better than the dark Brown Sauce with which the dish was immersed.  Cashew Shrimp was prepared with a much lighter Brown Sauce that I liked a whole lot better.

I can only describe the Orange Chicken as weird.  It consisted of large chunks of chicken, peppers, and onions glazed with an Orange Sauce but not at all typical for this breed of Cantonese fare.  Szechuan String Beans were okay but unremarkable.  Most disappointing of all was Small Egg-Fried Rice with scallions.  The rice was richly bathed in soy-based Brown Sauce, and at first sighting had no visible egg in it.  I pointed this out to my server, and he volunteered to take back the dish and have more egg added, which I let him do.  Although improved, even upon its return the rice did not sport much egg.

Hot Tea was good, and our pot lasted quite awhile.  But by the end of our dinner, even an unusual Chocolate Dome, consisting of Dark Chocolate Ganache that exposed Chocolate Mousse and white cake inside that was possibly honey-soaked after being cracked open, could not save the day for this rather ordinary meal.

I was walking through New York New York and noticed they had a Chinese eatery option. I'm in Vegas for a conference so I figured I'd gives this place a try to get some variety from the typical conference food.

To layout my expectations, I grew up in San Francisco where I was actually spoiled with Chinese food that was big portioned, cheap, and tasty.

I decided to order the Singapore Noodles for $12.95.  I noticed this noodle dish didn't have the Hot & Spicy symbol so I decided to ask them to make it a little more spicy for me.  My dish consisted of:

*Shrimp
*BBQ Pork
*Bean Sprouts
*Onions
*Bell Peppers
*Rice Noodles
*Curry Sauce

When the plate came out I noticed it was HUGE. I saw one giant mound of noodles and I was ready to tackle it!  

The noodles themselves were done nicely where they still had a little springiness.  It was stir fried in a curry sauce, but I wasn't able to taste much of the curry flavor.  Even though I asked them to make it spicy they actually just added some roasted chili peppers into my dish. My server was nice enough though to bring me some extra chili sauce. 

I poked around my noodles and noticed they were really sparing with the ingredients. I found myself actually eating a lot of noodles before I got to any of the shrimp or BBQ pork.

Chin Chin does a decent job of providing traditional Chinese food in a casual café setting. My server was overall really nice and attentive.

Chin Chin is located in the New York New York Hotel and it's not by any means an authentic Chinese restaurant.  They serve ""Americanized"" Chinese food which isn't a bad thing but when it comes with poor service, the experience just isn't that great.

We were lucky enough not to have to wait for a table.  It was a Friday night and the restaurant wasn't that busy so that should have been my first inclination that maybe we should have dined elsewhere.  The hostess was pretty friendly and welcoming.  However, our server was a different story.  She had an attitude and it was apparent that she hates her job.  She kind of rushed us while ordering and basically threw something on there that we really didn't ask for.  She took the liberty of ordering the sampler of appetizers for us.  Even though we knew what she did, we didn't decline as we were unsure of what appetizers to get anyway.  

The food was good, not great, and like I said, it is definitely not authentic Chinese food.  Their fried rice was very similar to Panda Express (Chinese fast food chain), so really nothing special there.  The Mongolian Beef was pretty tasty but they overloaded it with green onions.  I'd say the Sweet and Sour Pork and the appetizer sampler were the winners of our meal.  What I thought was strange was that they have sushi on the menu.  I didn't care to give it a try because I don't go to Chinese restaurants for Japanese food.  They have some pretty good cocktails but be prepared to spend some money on them.

5913014,2016-06-06,0,b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag,The lunch time buffet was absolutely amazing! The food was incredibly delicious for a buffet and the sushi was actually really good for a buffet. They have plenty of vegetarian options if you are vegetarian. My favorite was the noodles. I highly recommend this place if you are in the hotel and want a cheap delicious buffet.,Civ7d8D-ITsVg_1gpH-Pxg,0,0,5,l97wBmDgp2HdaXRgqM03UA

The noodles, however, were exquisite. I even tried a bite of my friend's tangerine beef--I'm not a big meat eater but that was sooo delicious.",vA-JEXz8ZMRAnZ0m7TGouw,1,0,3,0iX4fY9N72P5ii1DO0yx4g

My group stopped here for a quick lunch and opted for the buffet. We thought it was a good deal since most single entrees are $15, and the buffet was approx $19.

The buffet isn't HUGE like your exclusive hotel buffets, but it's just the right size. 

I expected the food to taste like your typical greasy inauthentic Chinese food, but I was wrong! The food was light, not too salty and had just the right amount of everything.

Ooooo and their dessert bar was to die for! I liked everything here. The service was wonderful and I'd eat here again.",QRhZChDuwfBbuhqIazv5jA,3,2,5,e-f37x_V7WegD8HIkNzPag

The service was good though.",hwIWle9HcFSBPmeCxHGs0g,1,1,2,9H4o5vhrOqQhk5wibumnzA

Waitress kept forgetting to bring my wife's wine. Had to finally flag her down and remind her. I was already half way through my drink... no customer service recovery. I do have to admit that you will pay ""Vegas"" prices!!! And it really isn't worth it.",_26XW5rbHCEtTx5IvrbgKw,1,0,3,cwscd7K6ii2G1a-WsK4NEg

The three people at the bar were awesome made me feel like I was one of their family members. Never felt like I was alone sitting there Dana was one of the most attentive bartenders I've ever met!!! Again I travel for a living and bartenders like that our award winners! I have eaten at chin chins in California most of them, by far this young lady takes the cake of bartenders at Chin Chin, she has a  award winning smile that Chin Chin should have for all there employee! The sushi chef was also awesome Ben! I had a great time to talking to both of them and the third bartender. Chin chins you have 3 great individual people working for you! Hats off to you!!!",afMOiekbDH6f6YGPBpDJNQ,2,0,5,nxKa_JIQ75NAcu_fV_7jUg

5992560,2015-08-12,1,b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag,"Summary/TLDR - Brunch was good, the price wasn't, service was SPECTACULAR, and they'll automatically add tip for a party of 7.

Stopped here for brunch before heading out to the Grand Canyon. The brunch was actually pretty decent. They had eggs (regular, steak and eggs, pepper eggs), waffles, french toast, red velvet pancakes, bacon, sausage... A LOT to choose from! And the food was good! A bit disappointed that they only had syrup up at the buffet though. It would've been nice to have it on the table, but I'm not going to be THAT picky with my review.

I gave it a 3 star rating because although the food was good, it wasn't $17.95 per person good. The price was a bit hard to swallow (no pun intended... well maybe just a little...). Our waiter Cesar was EXTREMELY nice. He made sure we were filled on drinks and had everything we need. The service deserves 5 stars alone!! The other disappointment was that unfortunately Cesar works for a company that will automatically add gratuity of 18% to a check for a party of 7... Anytime a restaurant tells me what I need to pay in gratuity, that's all I'll pay. If I had calculated the tip on my own, he would've likely have gotten 20%+. Way to screw your hard-working and deserving employees.",JlAJ1I-ebp_MGWtIHP2PgA,0,0,3,iE6xcb9OIb9hQXnlJwAWSw
