796008,2017-05-22,0,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,I went there because I bought a Groupon and it wasn't far from me but I would never go back. The food was pretty much inedible. I was starving so I managed to eat a slice which I now regret.,yMURbN9MnATBrDpEDCdzxQ,2,0,1,0oL6gIN9YGtQAiWWVlEroA
1225985,2018-02-14,0,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,We tried this place because we had a Groupon and this is definitely one of our favorite pizza places in the city now. We get takeout here a lot. Al Capone is fantastic!,bv3nKWRmneOR-IQ3rESBiA,0,0,5,nITai0ypFcxqx3lYvz8nVA
1700212,2018-01-09,0,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,Really delicious pizza!  We got a supreme and an Al Capone a couple weeks ago.  Both were really good.  Their marinara is good too.... ask for a side of it to dip your crust in.  I am ordering again tonight... hoping for another home run :-),iQ9Ciy2EJtud5GsyBTO7pQ,0,0,5,KK6EcI36iW1FkEpGDaJdWA
1809960,2017-04-26,0,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,"The worse customer service ever. I ordered 2 pizzas, and 20 wings($18.99) for just the wings. Only to received 6 wings. When calling their restaurant first they hang up on me blaming the postmate guy about the mistake. When clearly you can see in your receipt that I payed  $18.99 for the wing. It must have been very expensive wings to get charged $18.99 for the 6 wing ding. And instead of listening to the customer.  you keep talking mouth like a girl. Terrible and very rude service!!!!",epG5ZsuEEWLi_MYK69C4xg,0,0,1,yQYOH7awluGc6BoXe7Me7w
2204160,2016-06-06,0,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,"I only found this place because of a groupon. I ordered two pizzas. The Al Capone and Sicily with no sausage, extra veggies. Went to pick it up, even asked the guy if the pizza had the extra veggies. He said yes. So I trusted him and didn't check it. I had hungry kids to feed.

I went home and looked at the pizzas. The Al Capone was fine, but the Sicily looked like someone puked on the pizza. I immediately called them back and said what happened. He said he would talk to the manager and call me back. 20 minutes later, nothing. So I called, he said he couldn't get ahold of the manager and couldn't do anything. Not even make a new pizza. So I was stuck with horrible pizza and disappointed kids. So I went somewhere else.

The pizza made me loose my appetite by how disgusting it looked.",LgpzYBlXUdixp1lHYLI3Qg,3,0,1,9lnnfAyKgAAnBhKRqCocZw

Now having said that, this pizza is BOMB. I got the Al Capone and it's loaded with meatballs, sausage, pepperoni and glorious crispy bacon. 

Even if you're naughty and pick off a bunch of the toppings, it still looks like a fully loaded pizza. It's fresh, flavorful and everything you could want in a pizza. I think I'm in love.",IamJ-OX89_P-i-xkknwpPA,4,2,4,ebQ6TQVmgCDGNP4A_AKxVw
2224822,2016-12-27,1,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,This is worth going to!! Sweet little Italian restaurant and has a fun theme. The chef made a special pizza  just perfect for us. It was warm and friendly and a great deal. I found a Groupon for $15 and found it hard to eat all the food that bought.,1dr6LE38qA29LHy_KCS2kA,1,2,5,z3_6qa18kVTzMs45a4kDVg

The food was pretty good, but not the best part of my visit.  The bartendress was incredibly friendly without being fake, just warm.   And the other clientele were just a motley crew that seemed to know each other for the most part.  Regulars.   It felt like a somewhat dysfunctional family (aren't they all) and it was incredibly comfortable to watch and participate in.  

I loved this experience and will most definitely be back.",P3mMnU1wbghuh4wMgY4HnA,0,0,4,ety5KerCmCM1Bp19TXbIsQ

We had the buffalo chicken pizza with grilled chicken and tastebuds-blown.   Absolutely recommend. We will definitely be coming back.",4fXJf3j6dZdxQJQud2bitQ,1,0,5,jSN0d7939pErCfb94GcoFA
3291050,2017-01-26,4,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,"I went there with a friend since we bought a Groupon for this place and I have to say that I would not recommend.

First this place is pretty far from any highway and you will also have to drive pretty far from the strip to get there. Mob City Pizza does offer a quite large parking lot so you shouldn't encounter any problem in this department.

We tried going one time in the afternoon. Unfortunately, we were told that the cook had to leave, even though it was in the middle of the day (Like 4pm...) and we were also told to come back another day. The only reason why we came back a second time was because we did buy the Groupon and needed to use it. 

We decided to get the Al Capone pizza. The pizza was pretty tasteless and with fewer toppings than I would have liked. It was also extremely greasy. Needless to say, we were very disappointed with the quality of the food, particularly given its price...

The place itself is also very much a dive bar, that is borderline creepy... I definitely would not recommend...

In conclusion, I would say that it is very easy to find a better pizza place in Las Vegas and would not recommend Mob City Pizza. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",JR7AYVUJ1_Nq36UBW3XHYw,2,3,2,US2hUzC-Bxs84yRrqJyH5g

4147746,2016-01-24,1,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,"Good service, friendly staff. The pizza place is located inside of a bar, we drove past it not realizing that. They made our order the way we liked (half and half pizza, special requests, etc.) and my husband and i drank and played pool while waiting for our order, nice time.",NvFJBHaaGFNzvzK-sMG_jg,0,0,4,ruQZ7yf8Al4lwdIs3ncUcg

4620969,2017-05-03,2,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,"I SPECIFICALLY said extra sauce because I HATE dry pizza! Got home and there was No Sauce at all on the pizza. It was left in the oven just a bit too long but not burnt. The Pot stickers my husband said were over cooked I called back to let him know there was no sauce he said 'I told him extra'  I say well there's actually none he says 'sorry' and that was the end of that conversation he got off real quick as if they were busy (I'd JUST left ten minutes prior, max 6 people). Probably won't go back because I HATE dry pizza. It may have been good but it had no sauce! Sad because that was going to be my go-to spot because I live down the street. Hate that I even left a tip at all now!!

The owner addressed my issues and I revisited! Dave, the chef was dynamic and he revisited my previous concern! He made an awesome pie that I will be SURE to get again. Thanks to the whole staff and the dynamics of making this pizza-loving foodie happy!! The pizza taste amazing! Walking out, other patrons wanted to buy it and I order another because it looked and smelled so good!!!",qKap1lhcOxvXMdLahYeGmA,1,0,5,dECLUVUobN0Bg-OiB6rQQw
5314639,2018-02-10,0,EBnR5M6upBcHfMK4063_Sw,"I stopped in here to use a Groupon.  I ordered the pretzel bites, the spicy teriyaki tenders, and the Al Capone pizza (meat lovers).

The order was ready in the exact amount of time quoted (25 min).

The pretzel bites were okay, but forgettable.  The tenders were slightly overdone, but still delicious and the sauce had just the right amount of heat.  The pizza was definitely the star of the show.  The crust was tasty and the sauce balanced with the perfect amount of sweetness and acidity.  The toppings were plentiful.  This pizza was worth getting just for the meatballs that were on it.  They were exceptional and had great garlic flavor.

The machine I played while there was sadly not as great, but then, that is no fault of the bar.  I would definitely return again.",h2emjCcYrH3ZN8BXmfTtkQ,1,0,4,sbmFIEO99a1Gfv1vFH1_uw
