18757,2014-01-08,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,This is the best place you'll probably ever try a hot dog at! They have so many different options to choose from. They range around $6 a hot dog but they are pretty stuffed with whatever it is that you order. I tried their bimbim bowl which was good but I would suggest you get a hot dog cause you can't get those any where else! Their Euro fries are also a big hit!,pMnKZ9DkgIBccHVsraWAlA,1,1,5,XJwFEm24T2Wdwoyw5qS6OA
32143,2011-11-16,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"My friend and I tried this place out today, and we both loved it. We loved the service, the girl at the counter was very friendly and came over to our table twice to ask how we were doing and to clean up our plates. I really didn't expect that at all since I thought it was a fast food place, but yay for service :D Also they didn't have something on the menu my friend wanted to order, and they were so apologetic for it even though we didn't think it was a big deal. They even offered to give it to us for free if we came back later for dinner or tomorrow. Seriously, it was awesome! Even places that charge $$$$ don't give me this type of service.

Anyhow, onto the food. If you love hot dogs, I think you will love this place. I really liked my banh mi hot dog and my friend loved his smoked dog. They were huge and satisfying, we both left full. We also ordered the angry fries, which comes in a very big portion. We didn't finish it, but it was pretty good. We both thought there was too much going on with it though and that maybe it would be better if it was with regular fries instead of sweet potato fries (although I love sweet potato fries by itself). Give this place a try and see for yourself. :)",sEx1Ua3yNjxBdJ_vJ9amfA,1,1,4,zJihoCok73rleAn5pQg0nw

The only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that I don't like when they deep-fry all their hot dogs. That just adds more grease and fat to all the other toppings you order with it. Good for a cheat meal once or twice every few months.",LTD2NAIin8vBRFHv9CKrfw,0,0,4,ebKOh0Xm_P4UfFX8doTsjA

55182,2012-01-20,1,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"We had heard of Buldogis from fellow yelper Anthony S, but had never made it out there because it was so far from where we live. One random day, Kalila and I found ourselves on that side of town and took advantage of it by finally trying this place out.

My favorite food is hot dogs, so I definitely had high standards and high expectations.

I ordered the beef buldogi dog and kaliia had the banh mi dog. We also got the chicken wings with a side of asian ginger sauce.

The beef bulgogi dog was very delicious and flavorful. The meat was tender. The bulgogi mayo was a great compliment to the hot dog.

Kalila's banh mi dog was really good as well. The sriracha mayo was perfect for her. Not too spicy and not too mayo-y. The pork belly and banh mi slaw worked well with the hot dog.

The hot dogs themselves are thick and juicy. Each hot dog is really loaded up with its' toppings so you get your money's worth... if not more.

The chicken wings were not anything special. I was looking forward to the asian ginger sauce being something similar to the asian zing sauce at buffalo wild wings, but it wasn't even close. The asian ginger sauce was more like an oil and you could barely even taste it. 
Somewhat of a disappointment since their hot dogs were so good that the same amazement couldn't transfer over to the chicken wings, but it's ok. You're not really ever going to go to bulDOGis for chicken wings. You will go and get hooked on their amazing hot dogs.

I just couldn't resist another hot dog. I then ordered the buckeye dog. The corn relish was the business. The bacon was crispy. It was awesome all around.

They have a large menu and plenty more foods to try.
Aside from the menu behind the counter, they have an additional menu of specials written on a chalkboard wall to the left.

There are clean restrooms inside (separate men & women, individual use).

They have 2 tv's and if you ask for the remote, they will allow you to change the channel. We watched the rebels lose to SDSU. Our stomachs were happy, but we left heartbroken.

MUST TRY THIS PLACE.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,1,1,4,Tpgmf3uB8I54_ONziBpNeg

98395,2012-11-20,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"I came here with a group of friends for a going-away party and had a pleasant time.  I've been hearing great things about this place so I was definitely looking forward to trying this place out.  Here's my breakdown:


PROS: 

-Great customer service: as soon I walked in, there was a long line, but I was still greeted very well by the staff behind the counter.  When it was my turn, the cashier lady was very welcoming and explained very well what each item was.  She also came to our table often to ask how the food was, or if there was anything that we needed.

-Price: you can't beat the cheap price.  For ~$5, you can be enjoying a gourmet hotdog with various toppings and sauces.

-Food quality: I ordered the Hawaiian dog, which was a beef hotdog, topped with pineapple, pork belly, some-kind of delicious sauce I can't remember the name, and scallions.  I enjoyed it very much and it was gone in 5 minutes.  The pineapples were sweet, which contrasted great with the sauce and scallions.  I would, however, say the pork-belly was a little underwhelming.  It was a little bitter, but overall, didn't take away from the experience.


CONS:

-None.  Can you believe that? I don't.  Maybe because I was so hungry, I wasn't thinking about anything but the food.  Like I mentioned, I had a pleasant time and I look forward to coming back.",hYbciJ5P3rhkfDBnFAigWg,1,1,4,PJ43jy8fNpnzykObWmXfYA

With that said, our taste buds are spoiled with amazing food fushions and we find ourselves to be extremely picky and snobby when it comes to food. We are huge foodies and generally take a mom and pop establishment over a corporate food chain restaurants any day out of the week. What we really loved about Buldogies was it's risky twist in turning a basic dog into a Korean infused work of art! Kimchee and bulgogie with your dog?! I know, sounds crazy, but trust me, it's amazing! Caesar, the owner was an extremely nice gentleman when I asked if he could throw something together that my mom (Korean) would make us growing up.  He didn't hesitate and he made it exactly how my mom made it! We also had the wings......killer! Super crispy and full of flavor, you really don't need dipping sauce! If you're bored of the same ol chain restaurant experience, please take my advice and give Buldogies a try, it won't disappoint!!!!",k2aGjbPDJsZ2HscvzO95-g,1,1,5,lwoyX8CMkOI4trr1SDnakg

So I switched to a vegetarian style with kimchi and a fried egg...  He kept barking at me ""anything else?? anything else??"" ... even if I was thinking about getting something else, I didn't want to after being barked at like that. Hung up, got there only to feel rushed AGAIN when there were two people already seated and being fed, and one other guy who had already ordered before me. (Whom, he seemed considerably friendlier to). ""Pick up order?"" ""Yes, veggie dog"". I paid, and even tipped, and while I'm grappling to get my wallet, phone, and food together, he's saying thank you have a nice day--twice--as though I need to move faster... Uhm... OK.  For $6 I can handle crappy service. I got home, and when I opened my container, I was dismayed to see a hot dog in my ""veggie"" dog... In hindsight he must have heard ""naked"" instead of ""veggie"", because the only thing on it was kimchi and a fried egg. WELL, maybe you shouldn't be so rushed, especially with 3 customers in your vicinity. I try not to eat meat more than once a month so this was really a let down... but, not wanting to be ""that customer"" i ate it anyway. 

The ONLY reason I'm even giving it 2 stars is because, for what the dog was, it was really good. The kimchi was on point, and the egg was perfect. However, I like to eat what I ordered. And not be treated like shit in the process.

It's now a fusion restaurant with hotdogs, burgers, fries, soups, rice bowls and more. There's been a new limited time item everytime I've stopped by that never fails to disappoint.

I had the Southern Dog and Mr Ed had the Chicago Dog and speaking for myself the Southern was a symphony for the taste buds I mean if you truly love hot dogs as I do then Buldogis he has to be on your list of favorites after the first tasting.

I've been to this place a few times and have yet to discover why everyone else likes it so much. Their hot dogs are ok, but I'm not a fan of hot dogs so I can't really give a qualified opinion on their hot dogs. I can, however, tell you that their chicken tenders are the worst I've ever had. They're like elongated chicken nuggets that you can find in the frozen food section of your local supermarket. In fact, I think they probably took it out of the freezer and microwaved it. I'm not sure why they would serve this on their menu, even Dairy Queen has better chicken tenders! 

Also, their customer service needs work. The guy who took my order kept looking at the TV behind me the entire time and never made eye contact. Perhaps he thought what was on TV was more interesting than a paying customer. I'm sure other customers have had awkward experiences with the staff there. As I was waiting for my food, a big group of guys came in and had to figure out which tables to put together to form a larger table as the cashier just stood there and stared without offering any help.

Went to a restaurant in the same plaza and came across this place. What a find. Yelped it - saw the great reviews and had to go. I stopped eating red meat a few years ago but they have veggie and turkey dogs as a replacement but I do eat pork (the other white meat). They had a dog called ""The Angry Dog"" and used a pork sausage. It was delicious and spicy - yet not overpowering. Great spices and ingredients. Bravo! Came back two days later and had the ""Dragon Dog"" essentially the same but using a Habanero mayo (instead of the Chipotle mayo). This was spicier and the Habanero mayo kept my mouth on fire for the next hour but it didn't deter from the overall taste and flavor. Try it for an afternoon lunch or pre-dinner snack.

Before my order, the man behind the counter was very helpful. I asked the man behind the counter how big their portions are. He told me 3 hot dogs were roughly the size of one burger and I knew if I ordered that much I most likely could not finish my meal. I also asked what were the usual favorites, his personal favorites and what he would recommend, very helpful service. 

They had really good fries, If you're going to eat here might as well order some angry fries to go with your hot dogs cause those fries took all my anger away lol. I ordered the Bulgogi Hot Dog and the Philly Dog and the first bite into the hot dog was absolute bliss. I forgot everything that was bothering me... it was like all the stress was packed into a balloon and flew further away after each bite into the hot dog. The food was so good that I wanted to order more but being a tiny dude I could barely finish one dog. I decided to just order more take it to go and eat it later.

The place had some wonderful music mixed with great food, it made me feel really good. I would recommend this place to all my friends due to how unique their menu is. (where else can you get bulgogi toppings on a hot dog?) This is a really special place, great prices, cool music soundtrack and wonderful people. They kept asking if everything was tasting okay, I loved the attention I was getting! Any food that makes me feel this great deserves a wonderful review.

I was trying to find a place close to it and saw the cute play on words on Bulgogi/Bulldogs/Hot dogs (haha). And, asian fusion hotdogs? Hell yes. It just sounds good. Remember to check in on Yelp for a 10% off offer (as of the date of this review!). 

First thing we noticed was the fact that they totally stole the Quizno's ""open"" sign! Haha. Inside, there's mouth-watering hi-res pictures of some dishes on the wall and a few printed commended news articles about this place framed up. First thing I did right before we ordered was grab a ton of napkins. It's that messy. =]

We ordered the East Coast Dog (pastrami, sauerkraut, tomato, and buldogi mayo); and Beef Bulgogi Dog (bulgogi, asian slaw, green onions, sesame seeds, and bulgogi mayo); Angry Dog (spicy pork bulgogi, asian slaw, diced jalapenos, and fiery sauce). My boyfriend and I decided to cut eat one down the middle and sample all three! Lovely idea. Really, it was just an excuse because we couldn't settle on just one.

The guy behind the counter didn't just call our names to pick up the dogs, but he actually went up to our table and laid it down. Wasn't expecting that gesture for a hotdog fast food place! Awww it's the little things that get me. Nice service here! I asked a few questions about the sauces, and the guy offered us to sample their mayos. Pretty helpful.

Each dog was LOADED with the toppings. East Coast dog was savory, heavy, and sinfully lip-smacking good. Beef Bulgogi Dog was perfectly drenched in marinated bulgogi-goodness. Flavors worked well with the other toppings. To finish off, Angry Dog was just the right amount of spicy for me. This dog had extra-chewy bulgogi (mmm pork)! Pretty spicy but not overwhelming. Each one lived up to one another. My boyfriend was expecting a let-down or a dog that wouldn't taste as good as the previous, but no matter which dog you get, it holds its own! No disappointment whatsoever. In case you're wondering the difference between the BulGogi mayo and the BulDogi mayo: Bulgogi mayo has some sesame oil in it to specifically go with the asian fusion dogs. Buldogi mayo goes well with the pastrami. This attention to detail and taste is what makes this place awesome. Each one was a symphony of flavor.

Would definitely come here again. Maybe as a hangover cure or an excuse to sample their other stuff. This place is simply not just another hotdog fast food gimmick. The food definitely hit the spot. =] Highly recommended!",tQvoC8V-kvw6t0VIBbrd9A,4,2,4,0GdNCVyFYA03MJ2HPC6ySg

992675,2013-05-09,1,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"A few years back I discovered Dogzilla an Orange County food truck. They dress dogs with amazing Asian flavors. When I caught wind of Buldogis I thought this might deliver like Dogzilla did. My husband and I had it for dinner later that night. We were so excited, seeing the Best of Las Vegas 2013 banner outside made us feel like we were in for a treat!

The gentleman behind the counter was helpful and offered suggestions. I knew I wanted the Angry Dog ($5.95) so there was no question there. For the other we were leaning toward the Bahn Mi Dog, but we were swayed to try the Carne Asada Dog ($6.95) and  we went with the Euro fries ($5.95) since they came so highly recommended.

After drinks and tax we had ourselves a $25 meal. Pricey for two dogs and fries, but if they're good they'll be worth it.

Sadly, they were just ok. The hot dog itself was the weakest link. These were salty and lacked any of the all beef flavor I love in my Chicago dogs.  The toppings however good couldn't save the dog. The bun was a bit stale and too big. I like a good meat to bun ratio and this didn't deliver. I didn't prefer one dog over the other. Any difference in flavor was cloaked by saltiness.

The fries were an odd mix. We consumed them, but I have no idea what we ate. When they were recommended I expected gyro fries, not Euro fries. I recognized that it was topped with cheese, but beyond that I have no clue what the concoction was.

Lets start with the bad. The jumbo corn dog was a complete joke. It was nothing more than a deep fried foster farm corn dog. Nothing jumbo about it and definitely doesn't fit in with their gourmet dogs that they're known for. Save your $1.75 and don't buy this. 

The good. The hot dogs even without all the unique topping is very flavorful and definitely 10 times better than any ordinary hot dog. The angry dog had bulgogi meat, asian slaw, spicy mayo and jalapenos. It did not disappoint, I would have liked it spicier however it had a very good balance.

I usually get the teriyaki dog myself, but my roommate gas tried several others, not a miss yet! The euro fries are a tasty tasty treat. But like most treats should be consumed on moderation....who am I kidding, they're so good!

Also a special shout out to those with gluten sensitivities: Buldogis won't hesitate to skip the bun and put your delicious hot dog and toppings over a bed of spinach or lettuce! I personally think the spinach is a little tastier but the owner tells me he's moving toward the lettuce -based 'dog salad', which should be a huge hit this summer!

This quaint hot dog spot brings a creative, Korean twist to red hots.  I love the menu and the variety in the menu, but was less thrilled with the actual product.  

Like most red hot places, the majority of the space inside is dedicated to the grill.  This can make for a very hot room to eat in, so be warned.  The restaurant is neat and clean, with a couple things on the wall and a TV.  The staff was friendly and welcoming, and happy to explain the menu for those who inquire.

The food:

We had the Classic Buldogi, the Smoked dog, and the Bahn Mi dog.  Of the three, the Bahn Mi dog was flavorful and satisfying.  The other two left a lot to be desired.  I would rather have a good hot dog and good bulgogi individually if they are not complementing one another, and these did not complement each other.

Angry Kimchi fries - This was a hot mess.  The flavors worked well together (sweet potato fries btw) but it was just so messy.  The fries became soggy very quickly under the heavy toppings.  

Seasoned Fries - The fries had an odd aftertaste about them.  I think maybe it is cumin that I was tasting, but I'm not sure.  Either way, I'm not a fan of fixing something that isn't broken, and these fries would have been better senza the seasoning.  


Overall Buldogis is an alright place, but with all the Korean fusion eateries around town, I'm not left yearning for seconds.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,3,1,3,U4ih9F25FnJpV1pqyRRYaA

I like the concept of this place - a lot of topping options - didn't really pay attention to the topping prices so not sure if reasonable.  I opted for the specialty dogs .

The kimchi fries - didn't do much for me - the sweetness of the sweet potato fries dominated the overall taste - i was expecting some savory, some heat but i wasn't feeling it.

The dogs ( all under $5 ) - The buckeye, chili cheese and the banh mi.  I liked the toppings on all three but i'm not sold on the hot dog itself.  Not sure if it's due to my taste buds being dulled by years of eating der weinerschnitzel dogs, am/pm dogs or the ultimate, slots of fun mega dogs or was it due to eating there just before they closed or maybe the hot dog ain't that good.  

Given the creativity of the toppings and the good service, i think it's worth another try but if the dog still doesn't float my boat, sadly, there's no future for me and  Buldogi's.

1232550,2011-12-16,1,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"If there was one good thing provided by the Las Vegas recession (which still appears to have no end in sight) it's this: more mom and pop/neighborhood food places. For years it seemed like the only option there really was for cheap and quick meals in neighborhoods were fast food chains you could find anywhere else. Thank god people have finally started ""demanding"" not so hoity-toity places and the supply is rolling in. Buldogis is one of the latest additions to what's possibly the first local trend or ""Las Vegas reinvention"" in 10 years that's actually doing some good in my humble opinion.

The prices may throw one for a loop at first. I can testify to that. $5 for a hot dog is not my cup of tea, thankfully, there were pictures on display all over the restaurant. When it comes to hot dogs, I usually need at least two to fill me up. These didn't look like your ordinary hot dogs, at all, so I figured one would suffice. Wise choice on my behalf. 

I didn't want to get something TOO wild, it was only my first time here after all. I ordered a naked dog with caramelized onions, pork belly bacon, cheese and mustard with classic fries and a drink. Total: 8.86. Not bad. 

I was given a small sample cup of their chili while waiting for my food. It was courtesy of the chef since it was my first time here. At this point I was already beginning to fall in love with the place. The chili didn't have any beans, but it had a sweet taste sensation to complement the spiciness, so despite the fact it was bean-less, I was impressed. I already know what I'm going to order next time I visit. 

I automatically knew I was getting my money's worth when I saw just how big the meal was. Looking at the hot dog by itself, it's already officially the fourth best hot dog I have ever had (authentic Chicago-style, authentic NYC style and the hot dogs I used to get at the Gold Coast bowling alley all the time as a young'n are the only ones which were better). That hot dog with the toppings gave my taste buds an explosion of unique flavors I was not at all used to on the token ""mystery meat"" (which in the case of this restaurant is 100% beef, so what's in the hot dog isn't a mystery here). The mustard was a little bit too much, which is my fault as I was hesitant about adding that in the first place, not at all theirs. Otherwise, I was quite impressed. The fries were divine, with parmesan cheese, garlic and seasoning salt.

The ambiance of the place does not match the ""gourmet"" in it's title at all, which, again, in my humble out of the ordinary opinion is a good thing. It's a very home-y place, it already looks and feels like it's been a local staple for years and the staff is very down to Earth, helpful and friendly. It's location is unfortunate though, not only is Village Square basically dying but it's in that corner building next to Chicago Brewery which faces away from the street, a building which doesn't have a good track record with businesses at all. That said, all of the rave reviews it has been getting here on Yelp and in various local periodicals make me optimistic for this place. 

The Final Verdict (something new I'm trying out for my reviews):

Pros:
Cheap considering what you get.
Creative and experimental.
Pretty damn good hot dogs.
One hot dog can fill you up pretty well.
Down to Earth ambiance.

Cons:
The dying shopping center it's located in. 
It seems like they use mayo all over the place. Yuck. 

Suggestions: Using the term ""gourmet"" in the name of the place is rather off-putting. It's not expensive, and it's far from pretentious. Buldogi's Quirky Hot Dogs would probably work better and be more reflective of the food and ambiance.

Would I return? Absolutely.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,1,2,4,8h8wcea8Nc6VciQsAsQHaw

1255693,2012-02-12,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"It seems like nowadays clothes/style are not the only thing with trends.  Asian fusion is hot, new and exciting.  Commonly found on the food truck scene across America, chefs are mixing asian infused flavors into traditional foods americans love.  Since i've been a fan of the korean burrito and tacos in Hawaii, I was excited to try Asian Fusion Gourmet Hot Dogs in Las Vegas.

Firstly, if you are a tourist, this may be quite the adventure since it is ways away from the strip.  My buddy who I was boarding with lives on the west side and thus it wasn't too much of a trek for us to try this place out.

The menu has great descriptions of the dogs and what is inside them: http://buldogis.com/menu.html

Here's what we ordered:

Beef Buldogi Dog ($4.95): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZfTTD5yedeSkVfWzp3Si_g&userid=lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg

Banh Mi Dog ($4.95): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cBGBzIk754zhaSoUBGNgDw&userid=lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg

Chili Cheese Fries ($3.95): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6mhcXPCr1_XPDDLOK22wrQ&userid=lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg

Euro Special ($4.75): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9iZ8HwVxJW438frdfSKgig&userid=lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg

Both of the hot dogs were not bad, my buddy and I really enjoyed the sriracha mayo on the banh mi dog.  It gave a great kick and flavor to the hot dog.  The gourmet hot dog did not blow me away and the ingredients were good separate but together it just did not work for me.  The bun on the hot dog was probably my LEAST favorite, it almost tasted stale and was just underwhelming.

The fries were tasty.  Definitely enough for 2 - 3 people per order.  These fries are fork fries though.  You can use your hands but it is much easier to get the toppings and the fries together if you use a fork.  Personally the fries were decent but I'd take animal style fries from In-n-Out over these fries any day.  My buddy and I were gonna try the angry korean fries but we didn't like the thought of sweet potato.

Overall, its a nice joint with very friendly staff and decent prices.  The food is good, but not quite blow me away, venture all the way from the strip good.

FOR HER:

FOR HIM:
- He tried the MAC & CHEESE HOT DOG (covered with homemade creamy mac & cheese, cheddar and herb blend). He said the two were a match made in heaven and he quite possibly may never try anything else on the menu -- it was THAT good! We also split an order of the EURO SPECIAL FRIES (french fries smothered with bacon, cheddar cheese, herb blend and garlic aioli). Oh my yum... this place is the ultimate cheat meal all in one!

I live right around the corner from this location and it's difficult not to end up here every day. The food is awesome, the service is amazing, and the location is great.

Let's start with the food: I consistently get the Euro Fries. They are absolute to die for, the solo that they put over top mixed with the great flavor of the pork belly makes these a sure fire hit. I'm a bit of a creature of habit when it comes to this place. I almost always get the Carne Asada dog or the Philly Dog. The way that they cook their hot dogs (deep fried) makes the outer casing crisp and crunchy while still preserving the flavor inside the casing. Their bread and butter are the sauces that they put over the dogs though. Good lord, they are absolutely unreal. I'm salivating just thinking about them.

Next, the service. The gentleman that is the head chef at this location almost always is the one that rings me out and takes my order. The awesome thing about that is he remembers the particulars of my order from my previous trip. It's absolutely unreal, he has the most amazing memory. The funny part is that the meal is so heavy (but amazing) that I try and only go there once every couple months. Trust me, if I didn't have stomach issues, if be there weekly.

This place is hands down one of the best spots in Vegas. I love food and I love finding little dives that are in hidden pockets of Vegas. I never have an issue recommending this place because I KNOW that whatever they get, they'll love.",T102YnzI9pGgi6_SeVUqCw,0,0,5,7YzBh5P5HSFPFvkBl4UeRA

I LOVE the whole culinary fusion trend that's been going on the past few years  but Buldogis didn't WOW me like some other fusion places (komex, bacci burger, even the LA food trucks - kogi truck!).  The hotdogs were ok (ordered the buldogi and the angry dog). of the two, the angry was a bit tastier and had more flavor. A bit messy to eat as there's so much topping, you had a lot of spillage.

Although the specialties are the hotdog, the Loved the fries so much more. The Angry Kimchi Fries were amazing! Sweet potato fries with kimchi, cheese, jalapenos, and an egg on top! mix is all up for an amazing ""side"". I think next time i'll just order this as the portion is huge!
Euro fries were ok. Not that great either, the pork belly ""bacon"" could have been crisper but the cheddar and garlic mayo were a good touch.

I would eat here again but it would not be my first choice.  
It's not bad by any-means, it just didn't punch me in the face with deliciousness.

Went in with my buddy Alex for a late lunch around 4-5pm. Tucked away in one of the many, many, many strip malls of the burbs, the place was empty save for one other group of people sitting at the table next to us, and one person who came to pick up an order. I had a Santa Fe dog, Alex had an Angry, and we split an order of Euro Fries. I actually had a difficult time getting around to the the dog because I instantly fell in love with the garlic mayo and pork bellies they used. Having said that, the Santa Fe dog was incredible; the chili they used really sank into the rest of the ingredients, making it the king of hot dog you want to take your full 40 chews per bite on.

Angry kimchee fries are now our new meal of choice. Getting some extra sauce for extra angriness was definitely a positive move. The sauce is so freaking good we got a small container to go! If only it was available bottled, we'd take it home on the plane and start a Buldogi fan club in Florida!

But then once I got them, I really didn't mind... If they'd had better/faster service, this place would be a 5-star slam dunk.

Came here for lunch with 4 other people from work, and we weren't in a hurry but we weren't out to spend 3 hours eating lunch. The place wasn't very busy, another party of 6 was there and some were already eating, and a party of 3 that was getting an order for takeout had just ordered and left to return later. We were the only people that needed helping, but unfortunately it took us 5 minutes of standing at the counter to get waited on, and ordering was a slight hassle since the guy at the register was a cook, and trying to make food while running the counter and answering the phone.

There were two guys working, and it seemed like they cooked exactly one thing at a time instead of many things at a time. When our food came to the table they came out of order from how we'd been in line and ordered them, and they came out one at a time. It was about 20 minutes from the first dish coming out (my fries, which I ordered second) to the last dish coming out (my buddy's hot dog, which he'd ordered last). The guy who ordered first got his food second-to-last. It doesn't make any sense...

I got the Eurofries and an Angry Dog. The Angry Dog was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't even close. Do not fear the Angry Dog. That said, it was really really good. The Eurofries were also really good. The fries were very well cooked, the dog was very well cooked, the seasoning and flavors were awesome except for the jalapeños on top of the angry dog. I've had some jalapeños that really punch me in the face, but these had absolutely no flavor or heat at all. 

Don't take that to mean the Angry Dog wasn't good. I just skipped the jalapeños and everything else it came with was great. I have not a single thing bad to say about the Eurofries. 

From a healthiness standpoint, this place isn't going to win any awards. I mean, it's a fried hot dog and fries covered in sauces. But the quality of the meats were pretty dang good, especially for the price. No gristle, tender, good flavor, very well cooked...

I'll definitely be coming back here every now and then, when I am in the mood to not care about what I eat and just eat something delicious, and when I'm not in a hurry.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,1,1,4,WON2AH55CJI_1O5BrFJSWw

You get this beautiful, tasty creature http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buldogis-gourmet-hot-dogs-las-vegas?select=pOPuQI7bMbMjNHxkvquyvw#yCU0WkMG42PkAcDxqdQV8w

Located on the West Side of Vegas, about five or six miles from the busy LV Strip, is Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog's. This tiny place has a fairly large menu with all sorts of crazy hot dog, burger, and French fry concoctions.

My wife and I came here recently and shared three dogs and an order of fries. This is all we split;

Banh Mi Dog- Hot dog, pork belly, slaw, Sriracha mayo & a fried egg
Hawaiian Dog- Hot dog, pineapple slaw, grilled onions & honey Dijon mustard
Santa Fe Dog- Hot dog, bacon, chili, cheese, pico de gallo , chipotle mayo & avocado mayo
Angry Kimchi Fries- Sweet potato fries, spicy pork bulgogi, kimchi, five cheese blend, green onions, jalapenos & a fried egg

Every dog we ate was fabulous. My personal fave was the banh mi because it was overflowing with fatty pork belly. The Santa Fe was also a home run because of their homemade chili. The Hawaiian could have been a tad sweeter but it was still delicious. The Angry Kimchi fries were also phenomenal. They topped these fries with tons of juicy bulgogi and spicy kimchi. These were most definitely one of my all time favorite order of fries. 

Prices here are cheap. Much cheaper than anything on the Strip. The service was also excellent. The head chef was super cool and chatted with us while we waited for our food. 

I'm definitely a fan of Buldogis. I will be back for sure the next time I'm visiting Sin City.",YWFbTcVnun8i03XnEU7kVg,12,15,5,WAu4qDJGGrl3Fr93yZ7Jtw

I read about Buldogi on Yelp (of course, where else?!) and decided to give it a try with my son. You're definitely welcomed immediately by the employees as you walk into this small joint. I'm guessing the small amount of tables is adequate because I can see the turnover being pretty fast. There's a few tables/chairs outside also, perhaps better for after summer!

Crazy and creative menu. Look for yourself. It's a hot dog joint, where they offer just your usual ketchup, mustard, relish, but that's not why you come here. My last visit, I had a Banh Mi Dog. Your choice of all-beef, turkey, or veggie hot dog, topped with pork belly, banh mi slaw, herbs, and Asian Sriracha mayo. Like I said, crazy hot dogs!

I think I've finished my first hot dog, so I knew ordering one item to eat was enough for me. I'll have to come back with more people to try those Angry Fries people have been raving about.

If you're still not sold on the hot dogs, you can get any of their crazy toppings on a burger. They also have a couple of rice bowls to choose from, which I ordered for my son. Big portion! We took it home, and the leftovers gave him another meal or two.

They have a Yelp check-in special right now, which is 10% off your order.

To give you an idea of how AWESOME this place is: I, a cheap Asian male, tipped this place roughly 23% for the experience I had. My last visit, I came with my girlfriend's family for lunch. We ordered Angry Dogs and the Bulgogi Dog (not sure if that's what it's called, but that's basically what it is) with Euro Fries and Angry Fries to share. Mere words can not describe the delicious taste of the dogs and Angry Fries. The Euro Fries came pretty salty, but that's just something I'll avoid next time. 

The magic here though, is the service. Every time I come in, I'm always served by the Head Chef. To anyone who doesn't actually know where the management lies, would easily be deceived into believing that Head Chef Cesar is the owner because of the amount of care he puts into the customers. During my visit, the chef messed up my order and served us an order of sweet potato fries that we did not order. We kindly told him that we did not order a side of sweet potato Angry fries, but he gave it to us anyways! Our party and another table were always checked on during our meal.

1791274,2013-07-29,7,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"The Dragon Kimchi Dog Challenge called.  LJ R. and Niyen answered the phone.

On your left, the Yelp community is represented by LJ R. and Niyen.  They're up for the challenge.  Niyen is jumping up and down, taking off his hat, shaking his head, psyching up, throwing punches in the air, drumming up the crowd in the style of Muhamed Ali.  He's pawing at the floor, ready to tear into the three habenero laden dogs.  Then there is LJ.  Quiet, steady, silent, deadly.  LJ assumes the position, without fanfare, without bravado.  Be afraid.  Be very afraid.

But first our competitors must sign the two page waiver which the short version says if they keel over we have to drag them to the nearest medical facility and clean up after ourselves.

On the right, the Dragon Kimchi Dog looms.  Three loaded dogs with hotter than hell sauce (according to the taste tester, Kevin P.), kimchi and habeneros.  Those dogs gotta disappear in 5 minutes or your heartburn is for nothing.  The owner states the rules, turns on the floodlights over the action scene and begins the timer.  

Challenger Niyen has a distinct strategy.  He pulls the dogs out of their nest and downs them one by one.  Then he assaults the bun, kimchi and toppings.  LJ is methodical with the traditional approach, the shortest point between two distances is a straight line.  Our brand new Community Yelp Manager, Drew is on pins and needles since this is the first challenge on his watch.  The 8 Yelpers who came to show support are giving out times and encouragement.  The tension is thick in the air like kimchi.

Ten, nine, eight, seven.....come on LJ!  Oh time is up!  One Dragon bite stood between LJ and Buldogi Glory.  Oh the agony of defeat.  

But all is not lost.  Both Niyen and LJ were given Buldogi shirts by the owner that we all signed our wishes on it.  To be continued......",VtLdzz_1olnpRU6AuSsEVg,6,6,4,7Aku4aHijX7qzWV5cqWpyw

However, they're no ordinary dogs (though you can buy one that way). I chose the East Coast Dog that was topped with pastrami, sauerkraut, tomatoes, and their Buldogi mayo. My boyfriend chose two: one topped with teriyaki beef, roasted peppers, sesame seeds, and teriyaki sauce which, quite fittingly, was called their Teriyaki Dog. He, also, tried one of their specials of the day... the Philly Steak Dog (which wasn't on the menu). It had steak, peppers, shredded cheese, and Buldogi mayo. Then, to top off our order, we had some Euro Fries that were covered with pork belly bacon, herbs, cheese, and garlic mayo.

I enjoyed my dog (I love me some pastrami and sauerkraut), but I wish they had used a more tangy sauerkraut rather than sweet. My bf's Teriyaki dog was amazing! He said that he'll, definitely, be getting that again (and I may get one for myself, too... yeah, it was that yummy)! The Philly was alright, but nothing that either of us would order in the future. He tried it out because one of the staff had suggested it and said that it was pretty good. The fries were pretty tasty. They were a little on the salty side, not because of the toppings, but I think because of the seasoning salt that was on the fries themselves. Next time, I think I'll ask for them lightly seasoned... just in case.

There are so many hot dogs to choose from (and you can create your own, as well) that the bf and I have decided that we'll be back.  He wants to try out their Banh Mi Dog and I'd like to try the Buckeye.

Overall, the experience was great! It helps that the owner and his staff were super friendly. From the minute we walked through the door to the time we got up to leave, we received excellent customer service.",5OW5HpsyZe1-hoxHHZKbsA,3,2,4,uHv9ux_Zri31IB-Je4iEjA

However, I have had the pleasure of eating Gourmet Hot Dogs here in Vegas and around Los Angeles -- and Buldogis doesn't disappoint.

Korean Fusion is only good if the chef knows what he's doing -- and the chef definitely knows what he's doing. I ordered two bulgogi dogs and one euro fries and had one of the best meals at work, ever. AND it doesn't break the bank.

But even with good food, I was more surprised with how friendly everyone was. The Cashier, the Chef, and the Owner were all very inviting and made me feel comfortable ordering for the first time.

So, what does that leave us with? Good Food and Good Service, at a Good Price; how can it get any better?!

P.S. If you're looking for the place, it's hiding a bit north of the Jack in The Box next to Regal's Movie Theater on Sahara and Fort Apache.

So cold that it made the whole hot dog feel cold.. So although it looks like there's a lot on it, somehow there was still something missing, and the cold buns just were not good... Weve honestly had better gourmet hot dogs than this.. :( 

Prices were GREAT! Cheaper than anticipated, plus the place it cute and clean. Wish I could give 3.5 stars",X7zysG3Cja6G2blwDyE76Q,5,3,3,PA7HaY2_M9ZjKIt0s8Sw8Q

While I waited for them to expertly prepare my dog, I read all over the walls about their acclaimed and innovative dogs.  This caused my expectations to rise.  I took it to go and ate it in my Tahoe and at first bite noticed the chili was ice cold and the dog only slightly warmed.  It was so cold that the cheese didn't even melt!   To make things worse, the bun was so inadequate it came apart in my hands as I attempted to eat it.  They had to know the chili was in the chiller so why not even put it under the salamander to warm the whole thing up?  Or how about warming the chili in the micro before service?

2010586,2014-01-21,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Dragged the BF here for a quick late lunch- we've been to a few ""gourmet hotdog"" places, and they've been pretty hit or miss for us. But I had a feeling about this place, and when it was featured as Yelp LV's review of the day last week, I knew I had to go soon.

We arrived for a late lunch around 3PM. Two guys working- an owner-looking fella and a young cook. Stood at the counter for a good five minutes being ignored as they filled orders and walked them to tables without acknowledging me. BF eventually stood in line for me, asked to place an order, and was apologized to a few times about the delay. Guess customer service isn't quite the strong suit here.

In their defense, even for a late lunch, the crowd was steady- we ordered the bulgogi beef and the bahn mi dogs, plus an order of the chili cheese fries. I loved the bulgogi dog- piled high with beef and green onions, it was tasty without being overwhelming. BF preferred the bahn mi, which had a good assortment of crunchy veggies and pork belly, with srircha mayo that had a good kick to it. We really could have done without the chili cheese fries, and they were underwhelming- the fries were unsalted and the chili was very basic, we should have stopped at the dogs or tried the Euro Special instead.

Was impressed enough with the dogs we had to come back- BF is already making a list of what he wants to try on his next visit. But we're more likely to split 3 dogs than do 2 plus a side of fries next time. One dog is easily a meal for a girl or guys who don't have huge appetites, so don't go overboard ordering. Decent prices, too: think everything is about six dollars each, from the dogs and burgers to pimped-out fries.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,1,4,lSOUzGBgV412b8fiX10RqQ

2017221,2014-02-10,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"With all the competition out there between fusion restaurants, sometimes it seems like creativity starts to overshadow the drive to keep things fun and tasty. Enter Buldogi's. To say that they put a twist to the hot dog would be an understatement. Each hot dog is a specially crafted mixture of flavors and textures that definitely takes the classic to a whole new level but doesn't drown out the hot dog so much that you forget you're having a fun-time staple of food. 

It's the same with their fries, each choice has to be tried at least once. Unfortunately, I haven't even began to try their burger yet but I am sure they'll be just as amazing,

One tip: the dogs they craft are so different in flavor....go with a group....order a few and split them up. This will give you a chance to see just how eclectic their style really is.",AolnyiEB_UMlQtD_dp5E9g,0,0,4,h-UJl5LtSKYw2-2C6Wtc_A

Hint: Don't forget to check the chalkboard wall menu for specials. I missed out on several options by only looking at the menu behind the counter. (Though, that was probably for the best considering how long it took me to made a decision on what to order.)

The wings looked awesome. And they have burgers too. But I had to go with a hot dog, since ya know, it's a hot dog place. And, of course, there was no way I could pass up fries. Frankly, I don't how I made it out there without ordering like 18 different items. Seriously tough choices. I went with the Angry Dog (spicy and with an Asian twist) and Carne Asada Fries (loaded with toppings!).

They were pretty busy, so I had a to wait for my order for a bit. But it wasn't more than 15 minutes. The order was brought to me and I was checked on a couple of times. Not at all what I would have expected from a quick, casual, order-at-the-counter establishment. Very good service.

The food was fabulous. Tasty tasty tasty! And there is definitely no skimping on the toppings here. Both the hot dog and fries were loaded up with tons of toppings - just how I like it.

2054254,2015-08-09,3,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Buldogis have been on my radar for quit some time now and I finally got the chance to try them out. They use to be a food truck  but now they have a Resturant on Sahara and Fort Apache right next to the Chicago Brewing Co. To go from a truck to a brick and mortar place says a lot about their food I think. Well in most cases it does and in this case it's good! Besides I'm glad they did and even if they were a bit out of the way I'd rather drive a little distance then to chase a truck around town all day.

The Resturant is totally small but with tons of seating a little crowed but not super tiny either. The music is pumping and the decor is......divy. They have mix match dog decor and posters and magazine ads up everywhere boosting their fame and love for Bulgogidogs. Theirs a small chest height bar up against one of the windows with stools and a little outdoor patio with tables and chairs out front to really maximize their square footage in a smart way. So there's no shortage of seating. 

Being a guy that loves all things hotdog this place really peaked my interest and to up the ante it's gourmet and a Korean fusion. Also I love it when you spend some good money and get a great amount of food, because it really sucks when you go somewhere and not only is your wallet empty but you leave with an empty stomach as well, not here. Here at Buldogis you won't go hungry.

The angry dog with the fiery sauce and the bulgogi was awesome just prepare yourself to bite into fire, not literally but close. The Hot Dogs themselves are deep fried to achieve the perfect crunch and snap on the outer casing. The bulgogi itself was cook with great seasoning and enough char. It is topped with a fiery sauce which is spicy mayo and fresh chopped jalapeños and the pop of each little sesame seed makes it the right choice for the type of bun. 

Repeat all that on the Angry fries and add green onions, melted cheese, kimchi and a fried egg. The runniess of the yolk helps with he heat from all that spiciness. The kimchi had a great crunch and didn't over power with it's kimchiness and if you've had kimchi before you know what I mean. It is served in a huge portion normally with sweet potato fries but I subbed it with regular season fries and boy was I satisfied and happy I made that change. 

The corn dogs are not made in house but but first bite you wouldn't care because it's one of the best corn dogs I've ever tasted. The dog inside is the same dog they use for their hot dogs which you know that's good and the perfect ration of batter with it's crunch and slightly sweet cornbread batter was so amazing I can eat it all day! 

I can continue on and on a out the other menu items I ordered but this will become the longest review ever so I will leave it at that just go try it because take my word it will be worth it. The prices are ok but can get pricey especially if you want to try everything on their menu and you would want to because everything sounds so good. I now want to go back and try their Hawaiian Dog and their fried pickles. The sweet and spicy if that dog just make my tastes bud dance. Anyhow go grab a Buldogi, take a bite and be happy because that's what will happen when you do just that!",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,2,2,5,TZfjcm_tD4DQhBGtlqBaww

It's always so filling and delicious. When you're feeling extra hungry, get the euro fries, carne asada fries or the sweet potato kimchi fries. They are so damn good, but the portion is huge so it's definitely shareable.

I told them it was my first time there, and they pointed to the HUGE board that had their menu drawn on! Pretty cool to look at, but kind of unorganized. I like to look at pictures so I turned to the handy Yelp app to see what others ordered. I made my decision.

I went with the Bulgogi Dog and went for the overkill with the Angry Kimchi fries with sweet potato fries. The food took a little bit of time to come out, but, in my opinion, worth the wait and understandable when you see what comes out! My mouth and eyes literally opened wide (see picture posted)!  I did not expect the fries to be that HUGE of a serving and the Bulgogi Dog's presentation was very appetizing! I normally eat my fries first because there's something about cold fries that make them a little bit of a chore to eat. So, I dived right in! The egg on top was like a cherry so I popped the yolk and mixed it all up nice with the rest of the ingredients!

The dog in the Bulgogi Dog might've been all beef. In which case, was perfect! The natural casing and snap to it is perfect and bulgogi was the perfect topping!

BUT, I still can't give it that 5-star... I liked the food, but didn't love it. I don't feel like the food is a craving because of it's complexity in it's menu. Sometimes, less is more. What's the Buldogi's staple? Like the Big Mac of McDonald's or the Whopper of Burger King. Buldogi's has to have that ONE THING! And I found the menu to be a bit messy. The environment and eating areas are nice and clean, but 4 stars is still better than 3... 2.... or 1! Thumbs up, Buldogi's!

The food came out in a timely manner, fresh and hot. We were served at our table. It was love at first bite. The bulgogi that was on top of the all beef hot dog was so juicy and flavorful. The slaw was also very good. I noticed my roomie was already demolishing her Mac and Cheese dog but she willingly let me have a bite of it.

Seriously. 
Just. Do. It.

It's a not so average hot dog joint with mash-ups that leave you wondering, ""Why the frump didn't I think of this?!"" I guess it also helps to merge different cultures together. All cultures are represented in a fusion-esq way. The interior was cozy with a diner like feel. The people at the counter were really nice and happy!

It's safe to say that I am a fan of the all mighty (sometimes) mysterious hot dog. If you are as well then you will truly appreciate the slight snap of the casing with all it's  majestic glory. I only wish I had the stomach for some pork belly bacon or chicken.

We ordered: 
*Bulgogi - the meat and the slaw was very flavorful, but I personally wasn't too keen on the sauce. Took me over the edge.

*Gagnam -Chopped green onion, thin strips of seaweed, sesame seeds, cucumbers, sauce. Probably my favorite because of it's simplicity. It was refreshing and had the right amount of stuff to keep me interested.

*Carne Asada Fries - not as good as San Diego style. The carne was a lil' on the tough side and the fries got soggy fast. Would have liked an avocado piece or two.

In addition to the menu that they have online, there's a giant whiteboard with even more amazing choices. 
I had the bahn mi dog and the angry kimchi fries, which I split with my dining buddy. Both amazing dishes, I especially liked the hot dog though. Juicy, 100% all beef, bacon sauce and the bahn mi pickled carrots / radish and soft warm bun made it the best hot dog I've ever had.

from korean tacos to sushi burritos now korean hot dogs!!!???
i don't typically follow trends but, when it comes to food, trendy or not, if it's good food, i'm all over it!
that definitely goes for buldogi's.

i have a difficult time giving a hot dog place 5 stars when they don't make their own dogs. (1/2 star deducted)
i mean, really, how difficult is it to put yummy ingredients over a pre made dog?
not all that difficult.
and then, when you charge $5 per dog, well, maybe make your own dog from scratch, ya know!?

what we had:

banh mi dog (vegetarian) - essentially it's a tofu dog on a basic bun topped with banh mi slaw and sriracha mayo.  the sauce definitely makes the dog.  without it, it'd be quite tasteless and boring.

euro special fries - i'm not usually into fat fries but these are quite good. crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  again, the freakin garlic sauce makes this dish!

angry kimchi fries - ok, not great.
beef bulgogi dog - the hubby inhaled it and mentioned that the bulgogi was less salty than komex.
west coast dog - the hubby mentioned it was good but not great.  again, if the dog was scratch made, it would've made a huge difference.

one main issue i had with them was that i ordered the banh mi dog, vegetarian style, but didn't receive a vegetarian style dog.
it even says on the menu that any dog can be made vegetarian.
but when my dog arrived, there was pork belly all over the top of it.
is it just me or when someone orders something vegetarian, isn't it assumed that the entire dish should be vegetarian?
just sayin'...
so, 1/2 star deducted.

overall, the homemade sauces and mayos are delicious and definitely make the dogs shine.
it's all about those yummy sauces here.
would love to see some different buns (sesame, potato, wheat, etc.)
would love to see scratch made dogs, especially a lobster dog or something with seafood.

all that said, the concept is good, the food is tasty and the service is friendly.

2. Fish tank of behaved fishes

5. Electric floral cords

On to business,
I had the beef bulgogi dog and Angry  fries

The hot dog alone was GOOOOD itself. The beef tasted pure. No mysterious flavors or textures. The toppings(bulgogi, asian slaw, g-onions, sesame seeds, and bulgogi mayo)were slightly sloppy but fresh and tasty. Yes, fresh. I think the sesame seeds give the taste a nice touch.  Make sure you have a stack of napkins before you begin. You will need them.

Note to petite ladies: one dog is filling enough, just incase you're craving two or one dog plus fries, think twice or you'll be bringing it home. And let's face it, soggy fries or soggy buldogis as leftovers isn't the tastiest.

The Angry fries were made with sweet potato, spicy pork bulgogi, kimchi, five cheeses, egg, green onion, jalapeño. Filling. The end. It's good, I usually like a side of hot sauce to go with most of my meals, but this is spiced just enough from the kimchi. 

They also have a huge white wall of their specials. Beer battered jalapeño pickle spears, pork belly kimchi dog, rice bowls, home-made kimchi to go. They also have energy drinks here as an option, of course to bring down all that grease.",DASkWfrV6kWHE_4xC7BkYQ,3,4,5,C69xZhDHu3nc2i-ahCguQA

First off always been fan of the whole asian style hot dogs and fan of Buldogis from my first visit. I have never had a bad experience with the food or the service. On my most recent visit not only got to try some new menu items. The Angry Burrito and the Kimchi Chicken Quesadilla. The Angry Burrito talk about filling Burrito. Spicy Bulgogi am HUGE fan of...love it in the angry dog and now in Burrito. Not enough ways could have it. Ok maybe just huge bowl of it by itself. lol. 

Really point of my review is not about the food. The food at Buldogis speaks by itself and the reviews. Amazing. Taking service to another level more like six stars if yelp even had such a thing. I know think REALLY but when tell you story might be surprise. So came with my roommate for some takeout after watching our Vegas Knights win another game on Stanley Cup run. It was three days after the fact got god blessed amazing message on yelp. The business owner daughter had feeling left my debit card at the restaurant. I checked and realize I did. So responded back come in the restaurant next day. Lucky got quick response back just show my driver license for verification and good to go. Honest talk about customer service to six star level!!! First off have courtesy keep it in safe for couple days see if someone come back in the restaurant. Then to figure it out cause posted picture to the yelp page of the new menu items. Shows not only a commitment to highest customer service. To reach out. Still make sure check my ID in this day and age of ID theft. It kind of made me cry. In this day and age of corporate world feels live in. See the reason why hardly dine on the Vegas strip but would rather go small business off the strip. This is WHY is that get that personnel touch and small business owners appreciate loyal customers. Buldogis is a shining example of it!!!

Stick with the fusion dogs. Even an American palate can enjoy the bulgogi dog. The dogs are generously loaded. Most dogs can be vegetarianized, and they have turkey dogs. Try the avocado mayo with fries, so good! A dog and fries is enough for one hungry person.

This restaurant has a lot to compete with now in this plaza which is probably why I'm having thoughts like these: I wish the flavor was more aggressive. Like the caramelized onions should be cooked more. The dogs they say are spicy should be spicier. More dogs should have Korean hot sauce on them. The euro fries need more everything on them or maybe an additional condiment, too many naked fries. I want crazy amounts of seaweed on something. I want to smell sesame seed oil and garlic together. What if something had grilled fish on it!

They were both delicious. I'm not a huge fan of kimchi and ended up taking some of it off because it was too much for my taste, but it was still really good. My friend ordered the mac n cheese dog, but added bacon to it and I kind of wish I did too because it was even more amazing. My boyfriend ordered the chicago dog and the carne asada fries and he was very impressed. I don't eat hot dogs very often, but I will for sure be back to try the hawaiian and get the fries again.

2416688,2013-05-30,3,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Ok I'm never doubting Buldogis again. Haven't had them since last year, at their other location which according to Yelp is closed, and I wasn't impressed back then.  Upon arriving I made it my main priority to finally trying one of their dogs NOT their other items. Once inside I saw the words ""new"" and ""pork belly"".  I was about this much with not getting the dog again but of course I went with the Angry Dog so I'll save that new pork belly dish for another day. Anything with a mayo based sauce is instantly awesome in my book, that's my thing. I like making my own mayo based sauces at home and use them with everything and its almost always spicy too similar to this one.  The Angry Dog was the best thing I've eaten from a restaurant in a long time so ""Angry Dog FTW!!!"" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buldogis-gourmet-hot-dogs-las-vegas?select=4X_JwTZ_F2rcpB8VEeGn-g#4X_JwTZ_F2rcpB8VEeGn-g  Besides the mayo the Angry Dog had a nicer quality hot dog, some jalapenos which made added more spiciness, a little Asian slaw which kind of didn't notice, and some bulgogi meat which really did nothing for me.  Not gonna lie I think I could make my own version of a dog worthy of the menu loaded with much more but still Buldogis dogs are still pretty awesome. Anthony F. picked up the bulgogi burger and angry fries with a delicious looking fried egg on it MAN I wished I had ordered that too.

I don't know much about it other then there's pork belly, kimchi, caramelized onions, sport pepper, dragon sauce, there's 5 pepper symbols next to it on their board so it has to be hot, and I'm sure it comes with a hot dog and bun. I want to do the challenge but I just don't know more details. Does anyone else wanna?

2466631,2012-07-10,2,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"This place is 1 mile away from my temporary place of residence and it's dangerous. The first time I went here, I decided on the Bulgogi Hot Dog...and surprise surprise, it was good, flavorful and bulgogiful. I thought it was just an amazing hot dog, the beef was tender and the bulgogi had a good sauce to complement it....no ketchup or mustard needed.

The second time I went here, I got the bulgogi burger. And this burger rivaled the best burger I've had in my life - which was from San Tan Brewery in Gilbert, AZ. It was definitely on par with that other buger. It was just so good from the first bite to the last. There's only so many words to describe this burger so my only recommendation is if you are going to try one item, I truly believe that it should be the Bulgogi Buger. There is another item called the Buldogi burger which is apparently more bland and has no bulgogi, so make sure you don't get confused.

The third time I went here, I was severely disappointed. The chef was teaching a new employee how to make a Bulgogi Burger and I feel that my burger was overcooked. I was not just let down, I was ""oh hey your dad said he was going to take you the baseball game tonight, but then you found out he's taking your new stepmother instead"" let down. It tasted kind of the same, but I could really tell the difference. I dont mind if you're teaching a new person to cook, but just don't make it at my own expense. However poor this third experience was, I find that it would be unfair for me to downgrade the amazingness of the first two visits. 

If you're in the area, or near the area, or have a hankering for a bulgogi burger no matter where you might be - this has to be on your list of must stop food places.",6p1NDChnIpGl29Ce3cMKWg,2,4,5,NrBQNG9h4QsZQ3Xn5kX-iA

By now everyone has heard of Kogi food truck, which basically mixes Korean food with Mexican food, well BULDOGIES is a twist on an all time favorite American classic!  The genius behind this franchise mixed hot dogs and fries with Korean food, and this combination can be  describe as a savory combustion in your mouth.  Literally, at first bite, I forgot all about LA dirty dogs, and Chicago dogs.  The hot dogs here are juicy and very flavorful and their kimchi fries is to die for! Chili cheese fries at Buldogies has the same taste and texture as RedRobin fries but with cheese, jalapeno, bulgulgi and kimchi.  A must try for all those who's interested is the ANGRY dog, one taste and you will be brought to your knees.  The only downside for me is that this little gem is  14 miles (22 minutes) away from the strip, so its quite a drive; however, I'm so glad I made the trip....

I ordered the Angry Hotdog ($4.95), and the Angry Kimchi fries ($4.95).  The fries were actually sweet potato fries, covered in kimchi, an egg over easy, bulgogi, and Korean spices.  It had a small little bite to it that I actually would have preferred stronger.    The fries didn't come together so good for me.  I'm just not sure if the sweetness of the sweet potato goes with the spicy, meaty flavors of the bulgogi and Korean chili sauce.  They were good, but not great, and a little bit too greasy for me.  

The hotdog, however, was bomb!  I don't even know what all was on this thing because I couldn't waste time on trying to figure it out.  I just wanted to eat it!  The hotdog was indeed gourmet and nothing like a 7-11 hotdog.  The buns were fresh and tasty (I confirmed with the owner that they get their buns freshly baked).  The bulgogi on the burger gave it such a beautifully savory flavor.  A really solid hotdog, again with a Korean style spice that really brought all the flavors together.  Even though it was a decently sized hotdog, the thing only lasted about 30 seconds.  

I am not a huge hotdog fan, but these are really unique.  The price is right as long as you don't get carried away with the toppings, which are $0.50 - $1.00 extra.  I look forward to trying more of their specialty dogs.  The service was nice, and the owner was very interested to find out what we liked and didn't like so much.

Sweet potato fries, topped with bulgogi pork, cheese, jalepenos, kimchi and a fried egg... easily two meals..

My girlfriend ordered the beef bulgogi without the dog... I had a bite.. YUM!  Tender beef with a hint of sweet soy and asian slaw wrapped in a tender bun. Definitely what I am getting the next time!

Bread pudding is my all time favorite dessert, so we had to give theirs a try. Flavor of the pudding was great. The sauce on top was ok, kind of tasted like pancake syrup. If you like dense bread pudding, this is the one to eat!

The service was good. We were immediately greeted when we entered. Both the cashier and the owner gave suggestions on what all we should try.

We ordered the East Coast dog which has pastrami and sauerkraut, the angry burger which had spicy bugolgi, and Euro fries. My favorite was definitely the angry burger. It has the least amount of mayo on it and it was JUICY!! That has to be some fatty 80/20 or something. 

The spicy bugolgi was a bomb combo, but because of all the juices, it got soggy pretty fast, so eat up! The East Coast dog was my husband's choice. I really wanted to try the bahn mi but my husband hates bahn mis. The hot dog itself is quality for sure and huge!! I shovel food in my face like there's no tomorrow, but I don't think I could eat more than 2 of those bad boys, when I can do about 4 standard hot dogs. The East Coast dog was good, but nothing special. I'm sure the Asian fusion dogs would have had more interesting flavors. Lastly, the Euro fries. I'd have to agree with the other reviewers on the lack of toppings on these. There is obviously a lot of garlic mayo, but that pork belly was a little skimpy, and we just had to eat about 2/5 of our fries with no toppings because we ran out. The fries are good on their own, but you know when you order specialty fries, you want every bite to be covered with something.

Located in the Village Square shopping center at Sahara and Ft. Apache on the west side of Las Vegas.  I was extremely hungry that afternoon and was just going to settle for some ""Jack"" when I saw the sign and decided to give Buldogis a try.  

The menu is very complex with dozens of unique specialty dogs or burger offerings with fries and beverages of course.  Flavors are inspired from different cultures such as Korean, Filipino, American, and even Mexican.  Some of the specials being offered this week were the Dragon Kimchi dog, Philly Steak dog, and Carne Asada dog.  I opted for the Carne Asada this trip.  After ordering, and a short wait I had my dog ready for chowing down. At first glance my initial response was Whoa! how am I going to eat that.    I had to plan my strategy on how to best attack this dog of epic proportions.  Of all possible methods knife and fork seemed the most realistic and sensible approach to not ruin my tie.

The dog itself is a 1/4 pounder served on a sesame seeded bun that was baked fresh that day for sure.  What made this dog slightly overwhelming was the way it was topped with thin strips of beef, cheese, pico de gallo, sliced jalapeno's, and smothered with chipotle mayo.  All the flavors together blended well creating a memorable and authentic flavor profile.  I could tell they really put some thought into these recipes and combinations.  I enjoyed this Hot dog very much. The all beef dog itself had great flavor and would have been great on its own with only mustard and ketchup.  

The service at Buldogis was ok but could be improved upon.  In these small mom and pop ops they do not exactly have the best staff training materials.  They were friendly and helpful enough to assist in understanding the daunting menu.  Rumor has it they have a Mac n Cheese Dog that was not on the special board at the time.  I might have make the journey to Summerlin to try and take on this urban legend of a dog.  Enjoy your visit.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,2,1,4,g76iga9lNbmcSi0O07i5HQ

I don't usually seek out hot dogs or eat them very often, so you might ask what's the big deal?  These aren't just hot dogs:  these are delicious, high quality dogs all by themselves, but you're not going to just have a hot dog.  Instead, you'll have the folks behind the counter pile your choice of a great assortment of Korean, Mexican or traditional US toppings onto the dog and make it a work of art.  I've tried the Angry Dog (spicy!) and the Smoked Dog so far--both delicious.  Remember, you can also treat your fries like you treat your dog:  get 'em plain or dress them up.

The place is super casual, the service was fast and very friendly, there's plenty of parking, and the restaurant is easy to find even though it's not sitting right on the road.

2851853,2014-02-07,21,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Imagine two college roommates, one an all-american kid raised on classic fast food fare, the other a Korean foreign exchange student with an overprotective mom preparing meals weekly from home, and then picture some pothead next door raiding their refrigerator one night and throwing their leftovers together in one massive pile for a meal of his own.  That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu, but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius.       

Went and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items: the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog)  and the Angry Kimchi Fries

The beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw, grilled onions, generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings, finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo.   The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings, and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm ""snap"" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor.  The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi, crispy slaw, smokey onions, creamy mayo, and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance.

The angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast.  Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste, the Angry fries here taste better than they look.  Start with a bed of sweet potato fries, add a layer of pork bulgogi, throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno, and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg, I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right!  There's a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together  (pro-tip: break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)

If I had one minor critique, it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items.    It looks like they may have attempted to expand previously but the other location appears closed on yelp, but hopefully their following will grow to be successful on a repeat attempt in the future.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,32,28,4,_4djll0WBAA8hLcsV7C4vw

""Someone told me of a place that has kimchi fries!""  

I was immediately intrigued.  Those two food items together?  I thought to myself, I must try these magical fries.  The next few weeks we were trying to get to Buldogis.  I did my Yelp research and checked out the pictures.  I love it when two food style are mixed.  We finally make the trek here.  I'm about to explain to you why I gave this place 5 stars.  First take a seat  and listen to my crazy adventure my family had when we went to Buldogis.  

Let me give you a little back story.  I have two girls.  A 1 year old and a 3 year old.  On this particular day my 3 year old was a little grumpy.  We made it to the restaurant and ordered a couple hot dogs, kimchi fries, a mini hot dog, and a corn dog.  Right after we ordered, my 3 year old just loses it.  I think she got mad because her sister stole something she was holding.  My wife takes her to the car because she is a mess.  (if you have small children you know what I am talking about.)  I am sitting there with my 1 year old and all the food comes.  It looks delicious.  After a little while I start to eat and then text my wife to come inside and I will try to calm down my 3 year old.  She agrees and comes to enjoy her hot dog.  I get to the car and my 3 year old finally calms down.  As we are walking toward the restaurant my wife comes out upset and tells me to get the baby.  As I go into the restaurant my wife was getting a drink refill and our 1 year old throws my wife's uneaten hot dog to the floor.  So my wife lost it and was upset.  (like I said if you have small children you know the setting.) 

This brings me to why I gave them 5 stars.  The food was awesome and different.  The girl at the counter was super nice.  She cleaned up the food on the floor right away and and they started making my wife a new hot dog.  At this point I am really embarrassed.  They were awesome, I apologized and said not to worry.  This is some top notch service.  Great food and great people.  You have to try this place out.  Don't worry at the end my wife ended up eating her hot do and some kimchi fries.

I don't think there's any place in Vegas that serves this style of hot dog and french fries. Come here with an open mind and an empty belly, because this place is definitely worth the calories. 

When you first walk in the smell is intoxicating; grilled meats, french fries and Kimchi, a great foreshadowing of an amazing lunch. After perusing the menu, I finally made up my mind and went with the Bulgogoi Dog. 

This is a hot dog covered in Bulgogi cooked meat, Asian slaw, green onions, sesame seeds and Bulgogi mayo. Amazing flavor combinations with each bite, the crunchy slaw mixed with soft bun and charred meat is a pure food party in your mouth. The seared meat on top is super tender and surprisingly goes well with the all beef hot dog. 

I also ordered the Kimchi Fries. Normally I'm not a Kimchi fan, but Buldogi has made a believer out me. Sweet potato fries, with spiced pork bulgogi, layers of cheese and Kimchi plus jalapenos and a fried egg! Why a fried egg? Just because!

Food. 
We ordered the Euro Fries which were our favorite. If you don't want a dog, order these and you'll be straight. These were unbelievably great. I ordered two dogs, which I ended up forcing myself to finish because of their big portions. I wanted to try the Banh Mi and the Buckeye, so I figured what the helll why not order both? The Banh Mi was good. I felt like something was missing from it though, cant put my finger on what it was. The Buckeye was pretty much the Euro Fries toppings on a dog. So that was good. My girlfriend got a bulgogi dog; she enjoyed it and was actually complaining about too much meat! (that's what she said). I've never heard anyone complain of too much meat before. The bulgogi tasted like it wasn't marinated long enough to me though. 

Overall a great and savory experience. These Asian Fusiom restaurants are too bomb. Can't wait to try the other dogs and the Angry Kimchi Fries.",tjJze3GgazAtVYSC1TPuQw,0,0,5,4fhSS0gMI3pqrdLTJ0p6nw

#2 - Ban Mi Hotdog       5/5

Banh mi hot dog
Carne asada fries
Mac n cheese hot dog (not pictured)
Bulgogi hot dog (not pictured)

This place is located right next to Chicago Brewery in Fort Apache. I ordered take out and the food was ready within 30 minutes. 

The banh mi hot dog was really good. It was topped with large chunks of bacon, pickled daikon/carrots, and Sriracha aioli. It was slightly salty for me (most likely from the bacon) but was balanced out by the pickled daikon/carrots and bun. 

The carne asada fries was topped with beef bulgogi, caramelized onions, pico de Gallo, 4 cheese, jalapeños, chipotle aioli and avocado aioli. It was really good. It did not lack flavor at all. The bulgogi gave the dish a slight sweetness/saltiness to it and the jalapeños gave it the perfect amount of little heat. 

My husband ordered Mac n cheese hot dog with pork belly on top. Unfortunately when we got home, the pork belly was no where to be found. He left a yelp review in regards to it and I received the call (I ordered the food via yelp) from the owner/manager within minutes of him posting it. They resolved the issue right away.

You have to eat 3 of there Dragon Kimchi Dogs in 5 minutes. It's not easy but if you finish it it's free.

Their Euro Fries are pretty delicious. The sauce they have on them gives them a good flavor mixed with the bacon and cheese. I tried the Santa Fe Dog last trip and it was pretty good. It is not a hot dog it's a hot link. Adds a different flavor and a little spice other than their normal hot dog.

Angry- The dog was tasty. Slaw really had no flavor was more of a texture additive. Jalepenos were fresh, crunchy and the spiciest part. Bulgogi reminded me of teriyaki beef. The fiery aioli was mild at best.

West coast- The dog was tasty. Cheddar was melty. Pico de gallo was crisp and tasted fresh. I didnt get onions. The avocado aioli was like green mayo.

Chili cheese- dog was tasty. The bun was extremely soggy. Chili was very bland, texture wise was like beef was cooked but fat was not drained and then was blended with water and generic chili powder. Was not a fan of the green onions. The cheddar was melty. Only ate half of it, couldn't finish it.

Chili cheese fries- fries were like 3/4 the thickness of steak fries. Chili was same chili on chili dog. Cheese was melty, but green onions were a bit much . 

The mac n cheese quesadillas stayed together well but there was no flavor besides the bacon which was thick and crunchy.

First off to let everyone know i was unable to actually have the food onsite.. I had some co workers bring me the food back as i was unable to leave the office for lunch.   

O.M.G.   The dogs and fries were OUTSTANDING.   

I had 2 varieties of the dogs for my first try.   

Turkey Dog :  5 Cheese Blend , Carmalized Onions ( oh my ) corn relish , roasted garlic mustard.    This was the first of the 2 i was able to try and it was very good.  The turkey dog had very good flavor , the cheese and corn relish along with the caramelized onions worked well.  I though the mustard was a little overpowering , but im not a huge mustard fan .  Next time i will probably go a little lighter on the mustard. 

Smoked Dog : Spicy Link , Caramelized Onions Slaw , Cheddar Cheese and GARLIC MAYO!.  As you can guess i really enjoyed the Garlic Mayo on this dog.  It was a perfect mixture of spicy to salty to  YUM!.  I have nothing to say about this at all , and will definitely be repeating again ! 

Classic Fries :  The best part .. they were still crunchy when i got them back to my office.  That is something i never get!.  The seasoning was not over powering and was just perfect...  Definitly worth it. 


All in all i quite enjoyed my meal , and would probably more if i was able to eat onsite.   Definitely will be back !",-B731Wh1510uXX9eC1orQQ,2,1,5,CFtGnBtM0h1tidfSQquOFw

My own meal here wasn't the best-- I opted for the burger and that was a huge mistake. The burgers here are pretty unremarkable-- you could get a better burger at a Chili's or even a Carls Jr. They were overcooked and the quality of the meat is rather poor and just lacking in flavor. Whatever you do DO NOT BOTHER WITH THE BURGERS. This is a hot dog place and that is what they do best. The bulgogi meat on the burger was fairly tasty and the sauce was quite creamy and a bit tangy.

My girlfriend went with the bulgogi dog which was topped with the same bulgogi meat, and was actually quite tasty. The dog is cooked just right and the toppings perfectly compliment the meat.

We also ordered the chili fries and they were pretty enjoyable but I keep hearing such good things about the Angry Kimchi fries that I'll have to try them next time.

The reason I was generous and edged these guys up to 4 stars is because they are both innovative and affordable. Also, our server was very friendly and everyone knows that's a plus at eateries. This is a reasonable place to take the family for dinner and you get a unique spin on hot dogs that makes these guys worth driving to.

Angry Dog:  A juicy, plump dog topped with Asian Slaw, fatty pieces of spicy pork Bulgogi, diced jalapeño peppers, and spicy mayo. This dog gave my tastebuds a bite! 

Although I've only dined here twice, I've made the decision that this is my favorite dog, -- at least for now. I prefer The Angry Dog over the Bahn Mi Dog -- which is also worth a try -- because it's much spicier. On the other hand, my cousin ordered the Bahn Mi Dog and thought it was too spicy. Either way, both dogs are  geared towards lovers of spiciness, though you can request to tone it down a few notches. 

Euro Fries: I think these tasted better the second time around, or maybe it's because I haven't been here in a while so they just tasted bomb to me? Mmm, pork belly, cheese, and garlic mayo. What an irresistible combination.

Hm, I wonder what's in store for Round 3? Perhaps Angry Kimchi Fries? A Teriyaki Dog? A burger? Don't know, but I think I should start visiting this place more often.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,13,9,5,0dTECXPneS7FadpqP6oKvQ

So let's get down to business, first off the building is hard to find because it's tucked in on the back side of the complex and across from Chicago brewery, the reason I was able to find it was they put their food truck in the parking lot which helps a lot. So upon walking in it has a very upbeat vibe with a couple of tv's and some top 40 music and some articles about the business and where it has been featured which is pretty cool so you can see the journey.

So since my friend rated it so highly I really wanted to try everything on the menu but I settled for a Carne Asada fry, chicken wings , and a philly cheese steal hot dog . So let's start with the hot dog- it was packed with toppings and meat and was more than a mouthful and very flavorful. The presentation was just like the picture and it had a little Asian zing with the type of green onions they use, it is a quality dog but if I had to choose it was the bottom 3 of the items I had and I say that with high regards for the dog since it was fantastic! Next was the wings- so they had 2 flavors on the menu  I never tried before which was soy Carmel and spicy Korean and I could not decide and my inner turmoil must have shown on my face because the nice clerk said he would do half and half which was the best thing he could have told me :). So the soy Carmel was so delicious and Carmely ( if that's even a word) and was almost like a dessert which was different and amazing all at the same time and the spicy Korean was lightly breaded with a nice crisp and was more mild but exploded with flavor, definitely a must try.

Now on to the highlight of the trip....... the carne Asada fries. Now I'm thinking there is no way a hot dog Asian-flair place can make a carne Asada fry taste right , but boy was I wrong. The fries were nice and crispy with a light crunch but not over done and topped with tons of meat, cheese , special house sauces , green onions, and Carmelized onions. It's hard to even describe the combination of flavors that explode with every bite, from the slight spice of the chipotle aioli to the seasoning of the meat to the Asian style crunchy green onions, I must say I was highly impressed and everything came together and was married perfectly. The portion sizes are big and you will definitely leave full and satisfied and the staff was very nice. 

I can see why this place has so many 5 stars and I will be back to try more items after I digest all this flavorful goodness",PB1PY4NhNu1bNwQCEUcFQQ,2,1,5,T5pg2SmyfXahDtz2ErJ4Dw

My friend had a beef bulgogi dog, while I had a kimchi and pork belly dog, but I forgot the name. Oddly, I didn't feel like the combination did much, but the flavors were all still quite good. But had I eaten them separately, it still would have tasted great.

Don't worry, you'll like the dogs too, even if you are afraid to try their signature selections and go with a plain old ketchup and mustard one.

But don't neglect to order the Angry Kimchi Fries - every time you come here.

The Angry Kimchi Fries are one of the most imaginative side dishes offered in the Las Vegas Valley and they are a perfect compliment to just about any meal. 

Some of you may remember when McDonald's fries were like Crack (before they changed the something or other). Back in my college days, my girlfriend used to make me drive to McDonald's to get their fries, but then to some other place for the burgers. 

Buldogis' Angry Kimchi Fries are one of those 'have to have them with just about every meal' sides that will have you coming back - even if it's just to pick up the best side dish in town to go with your meal from some other place.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,4,2,4,y6oBndC1g48_QHyRdv6Rvg

3652417,2015-09-12,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Given its limited space, narrow open kitchen, and minimal menu layout, Buldogis is what I'd imagine a restaurant would be like if a working gourmet food truck backed into a shopping center unit and never left.  If that was the desired effect, then I must applaud these guys on a job well done.  

Jokes aside though, this place is probably one of my favorite places to eat in the city.  Whenever I'm in the mood for the grandest, most rich, most decadent, greasy, wonderful feast I could possibly conjure up in my deepest desires... Whenever I want to have a meal that not only fills my stomach, but makes me happy to be alive, I come here.  

It's got a fast-food vibe, a menu derived from familiar junk food items, but your food will take a good minute to prepare. That's because the ingredients are fresh, the sauces are hand-crafted, and each meal is made to order.  

Buldogis puts a unique spin on American classics like hot dogs, hamburgers, and fried chicken.  They offer an impressive list of gourmet dogs, all of which can be made into burgers. My favorites are the angry dog (spicy pork, Asian slaw, jalapeños, spicy mayo) and the Santa Fe dog (hot link, chili, cheese, pico de gallo, chipotle mayo). 

Unfortunately for my waist-line,  I can't come here without ordering a side of specialty fries.  My favorites are the carne asada fries (the best I've ever had), and Euro fries (pork belly, cheddar, garlic mayo, herbs). These are must-try items, and I'd say, if you get nothing else, try these!

They also have great chicken strips, and chicken wings.. Well-fried, not greasy at all. Who would have guessed a hot dog place would be so great at frying chicken?

The hangover soup is another must-try. It will clear your sinuses guaranteed!

If you like spicy food I recommend ordering a side of dragon sauce. It's a unique Asian-inspired hot sauce that I can't get enough of.",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,1,0,5,wT8IDfRkRkv54VeiX8vn4g

The food served from this truck is good, but not that special. I have tried both the Chicago dog and the Hawaiian. In addition to those, I've also bought Carne Asada fries. Everything was good, but it wasn't necessarily great. I have never managed to finish an entire hot dog because they seem overly greasy. I hate feeling like I am inhaling something that's not necessarily good for my body.

If they could some how make these items a cleaner eat, I might not feel so bad. My hands get drenched in sauce and hotdog juice. The carne asada fries are spectacular, but they are also just as good as the ones that I received from a trip from the dreadful Roberto's taco shop lol.

After scrolling through the pictures, I knew I had to try the angry kimchi fries.  I love sweet potato fries!  When you add spicy pork bulgogi, kimchi, 4 cheese blend, green onions, diced jalapeno, and a fried egg, how can you go wrong? You can't!  It was surprisingly really good.  I ate 95% of it.  I was expecting the fries to go limp towards the end, but they held up nicely.  The spicy pork bulgogi could be spicier, but that's just me.  My level of spiciness would probably be too much for the average person.

All the dogs can be made as a burger.  The banh mi burger sounded good.  It was pretty decent.  The buns were toasted which is always a plus.  The meat was juicy and seasoned well.  The pickled carrots and daikon needed a little more punch.  Perhaps they wanted to Americanize it and that's why it was slightly pickled.  Sadly, the bottom bun had turn to mush before I even took one bite.  I would probably get the banh mi dog next time.

The angry dog was excellent!  The dog had a nice kick to it.  Every bite was full of flavor.  

Overall, I would definitely go back.  Actually, I'm looking forward to it on my next trip to Vegas in two months.  Service was friendly, but a little slow since the cashier was also the server.",g2hQYumU1nGsneneavMA1g,2,2,4,yAUO7Mu6dZ-RyrdENvJHiQ

They have a great menu with a simple twist on the great American staple, hot dogs! Granted you can grab a fusion inspired burger and fries if you don't love those snap in your mouth dogs.

I can't seem to get enough of their sweet yet savory Angry Kimchi fries(sometimes made perfect and a couple times a bit greasy), and the oh so decadent Banh mi dog, you can't go wrong with pork belly on anything!

We had 4 adults and 2 toddlers, our order included a bit of a sampler so we could try different things...

Euro Special Fries- Delicious! 2 adults thought a little mayo-heavy, but still enjoyed them. Other 2 adults and both toddlers loved them.

Angry Kimchi Fries- Kind of a let down. They were hyped up on yelp, but just not so great in our opinion (all 4 adults). Just a little too busy, we couldn't taste any discerning flavors.

Jumbo Corn Dog- Typical corn dog. Good, but nothing special.

Chicken Tenders- Surprisingly good. Chicken was moist, hot, and the breading stayed on nicely. All of the adults stole pieces from the toddler they were meant for while she was distracted by the Euro Special Fries.

Buckeye Dog- Out of the 5 hot dogs, this one got a solid 3rd place rating. Very good, enjoyed the corn relish that was on it. Flavorful.

Hawaiian Dog- This one is tied for 2nd place with the Banh Mi. Everyone enjoyed this one, just wished it had a little more of the pineapple salsa on top. Bright sweet flavors, plentiful with scrumptious pork belly.

Banh Mi Dog-This one is tied for 2nd place with the Hawaiian. The one adult who didn't like the teriyaki dog claims this to be the best of the best and could eat this one and no others and be happy. Very refreshing with vibrant flavors.

Teriyaki Dog- This was the clear winner, 3 out of 4 adults put it in 1st place. Smothered in teriyaki meat with perfect flavors.

Angry Dog- The flavors were nice, but this one got last place by everyone. Yes, it is called the Angry Dog because it is spicy. We all knew that going in, but it was overwhelmingly spicy with a raw harsh burn to it that mottled out the flavor quite a bit. If they cut back the anger a little, the taste would be easier to judge. This is coming from 2 wusses and 2 people that love spice and put peppers and ghost chili salt on everything!

Overall, we will definitely be going back, there are still some good looking things to try and my wife is desperate for another Banh Mi Dog!",4wHbcKixm6Mh_PpjnaDTeQ,0,0,4,ondmj4yy5HO1Cec1Glkwrw

It was well worth the trip!  I had the Angry Dog which was so much better than I had expected - I totally loved it, especially with the fried egg on top.  Every bit as advertised - yummy indeed!

I have to go back and try some more of the varieties - wasn't too hungry the night I visited.

I love hot dogs consider it a special treat to have a good hot dog... I've driven past Buldogis lots of times and decided to check it out yesterday 

They advertise a ' Chicago' dog which is my fave.. I'm from Chicago and know a good Chicago dog from an imposter.... The version they serve here is definitely an imposter... Not even a good one
When I looked at their menu board I asked if their Chicago dog was served on a poppy seed bun.. No.      Then I asked if they used Vienna Hot Dogs... No.   They mentioned a brand I'd never heard of.  
For starters, if you're not serving Vienna brand hot dogs and not using poppy seed buns then you shouldn't call them Chicago Dogs... EVER

So I figured I'd order one of their other specialties... The West Coast Dog sounded good... Cheddar cheese, carmelized onions, and avocado mayo
What could be bad??
Apparently everything
The place was almost empty, there was no line... But I waited what seemed like forever.... My hot dog arrived in a tiny cardboard serving thingie ... Smothered in condiments and sauce
The bun was cold
The hot dog was barely warm
The bun fell apart when I picked it up
Onions tomatoes may cheese everywhere 
Including the table because the container was so small.... And no fork to scoop stuff up.... And NO FRIES!!! 
The damn hot dog was $6.95 
I've never been in any hot dog place anywhere that charged almost seven dollars and had the chutzpah not to include fries

For the two of us, I got a Smoked dog, an Angry dog, a small regular fries, and an order of Euro special fries.  I enjoyed the small amount of heat with my Angry dog.  I'd say it was more of an irritated dog than angry.  Perhaps I should have added jalapeño slices so my dog was a bit more angry.

My wife liked her Smoked dog.  The slaw and garlic mayo were very good.  The Euro fries were tasty too. 

I was so glad I got things to go.  There is so much topping on the dogs that it gets your hands full of liquid and toppings as they are squeezed off the dog no matter how gently you hoist that doggie!  That's not a problem.  It's just that I'm glad I could be sloppy in the privacy of mine own home rather than dribbling in public.

One downer--in looking at the photos, I saw Vegas J's photo of some bread pudding she'd had for dessert.  No dice.  They don't do desserts anymore.  Oh well, I still have a few 'Lette macarons from my last trip to LA so I had a Plan B that was quite good.

SERVICE 
Fast and prompt. 

FOOD
They have a unique variety of hotdogs that you won't find anywhere else. Hotdogs are $6-7 but pretty small so I would recommend that you order their classic French fries or fried pickles on the side. Or two hotdogs.

Euro Special Fries: My personal favorite! I always get this when I visit Buldogis. It's a regular French fries with pork belly, cheese, herb and garlic mayo. Fries are super crispy, pork belly is seasoned well (although it is on the saltier side) and I love their creamy garlic mayo that's drizzled on the fries. Huge portion as well. 5/5

Buckeye Dog: Pork belly bacon, corn relish, cheddar and garlic mayo. Flavor was similar to Euro Fries, but corn added some sweetness. 3/5

Hawaiian Dog: Pork belly, pineapple salsa, g-onions and honey dijon mustard. It was like they added Mexican twist because of salsa but then added Hawaiian touch with pineapple. Overall, too much going on for me. I prefer Buckeye over this one. 2/5

CONCLUSION
I think the weiner they use in hotdogs are too salty to begin with. Then they add sauce and other things which makes it overwhelming. I will just stick with their Euro Fries from now on.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,7,7,3,i7R0E1Ps6nfMPGylUobe0g

If you don't like meat, and you don't like tube forms...you best go back to sipping on your tofu and kale smoothie.  The words 'meat' and 'treat' are one and the same here!

Buldogis is what it is, a bit of an oxymoron with it's 'gourmet hot dog' moniker.  We all know hot dogs were started to aid with meat rations during the depression, but Buldogis doesn't mind taking it up a notch.  Looking for some variety in your dog, look no further!  Buldogis offers over a dozen different kind of hot dogs, some traditional, some just kind of outta the park different.  But looking at reviews, it's all good.

Yes, you will pay around $5-$6 per hot dog creation so don't visit if you only got $2 on you.  Just won't cut it.  Think of Buldogis as a treat or an experience, not a value meal and you'll be ok.  But no, this place won't break your wallet either (hello nearby neighbor Bachi Burger).  You will still be able to get a decent meal at Buldogis for just shy of $10 a person.  Save some money on your date, share a damn drink!  A couple bucks right there!  Unless your date has halitosis, or mono...or heaven forbid, BOTH.  Then maybe you should rethink your dating priorities.  Here's some of Buldogis seller dogs we tried:

-Angry Dog - spicy pork bulgogi, Asian slaw, diced jalapeno, fiery mayo
-Banh Mi Dog - pork belly, banh mi slaw, herb blend, sriracha mayo

Both winners!  The flavors of marinated pork, slaw, and condiments were complimentary to the premium all beef hot dogs served at Buldogis.  A surprising win-win flavor punch to the culinary gut!  KA-POW!

Also had an order of the Euro Special fries, crazy loaded with goodness!  Pork belly bacon, cheddar cheese, and an herb blend garlic mayo.  Heavy on the heart!

Bit of warning - don't go to Buldogis if you are diet watching!  Food is delicious but not light on portions or calories!  I will say that you will have a stick-to-your-ribs kind of meal.  Lots of beef, lots of pork, lots of carbs!  If you must, opt for the Classic Dog or Naked Dog.  But you will sorely be missing out on what Buldogis has to offer.

Buldogis has a specials menu that changes constantly, and offers lots of Korean delights and delicacies.  Also special new hot dog concoctions.  They do burgers, wings, and chicken tenders too, so be on the lookout for those.  Service is fast, but very friendly, and things pick up during the lunch rush.  There is a seating area with around 10-12 small tables but Buldogis is more of a takeout restaurant.

Keep up with the Korean fusion guys, and I will be back to watching another round of K-dramas on Netflix...wondering how I can fit myself into a pair of skinny jeans and drive around in my Hyundai Veloster coupe!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,0,4,CYLu_9YsXcC3c17vzwAPKg

Even though I've only been once before, the owner remembered and welcomed me back; that's always nice!

I had the beef bulgogi dog, and we also tried the beer battered fried pickles and classic fries.  Part of the fun of eating here is watching everyone try to fit their loaded dog into their mouth and all the toppings falling into a pile.  It's messy and finger licking good.  The beef bulgogi dog was excellent.  It had korean bulgogi style beef on top with green onions, sesame seeds and a zingy mayo.  Yum!  The fried pickles were probably the best version I've ever had.  The gave us a zesty east coast mayo for dipping.  The fries were crisp and seasoned and we got bloody mary ketchup and bbq ketchup to spruce them up.  They have loads of fun flavor of mayo and ketchup which you can sample for just 25 cents a piece.  

The hot dogs themselves are excellent and you can build your own if you are apprehensive about international toppings.  They are plump and juicy and all beef goodness.  My dad had a traditional chicago style dog and loved it.  They also have favorites like a chilli cheese dog, corn dog and so on.  

The prices are super reasonable.  I fed all three of us, with drinks, for $23.

The dog itself is really high quality - all beef with plenty of snap, and if that doesn't appeal to you, they have a spicy one, a veggie one, and I think one that's more like sausage. We tried the bulgogi and east coast (pastrami and sauerkraut) dogs, and both were great. About $6 each and very filling. The munchkin likes her corn dog, but it wasn't anything special.

4072737,2012-01-05,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Yeah i have to be that person who doesnt see what all the other Yelpsters see in this place. 
When i ate here i was actually excited to try this new spot based off the reviews of others and went straight for the angry fries of course and then a small Bulkogi bowl. The angry fries looked like an angry mess, i like the sunnyside up egg on top and i like the kimchi but the sweet potato fries and cheese etc just all became a soggy mess and i was kind of meh about it all. My Bulkogi bowl was so salty... i mean way way too salty. i think it was an overkill of soy sauce or something because i was struggling to finish it all. Too heavy in the green onions as well and the worst part of it was the amount gristle i had to chew through in such a small portion of meat. Every bite i had of this bowl had a small hard piece of gristle in my meat making it difficult to enjoy. The best part of my meal was the sweetened tea that they had on tap that was certainly needed because of my heavily salty meal. Maybe i should have ordered a hotdog but my brother said they were just ""ok"" so i went with something thats hard to mess up in a rice bowl, and that might have been my mistake. Ill probably not return, but on a positive note that maybe one less in line the followers have to wait on so they can get their food.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,0,0,2,tpVrewLm1dcJR50y0LpjTA
4073079,2012-11-22,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"It's interesting that this gets put in ""Korean"" because there's just the actual business name and two of their hot dogs that are Korean-related. Overall, they have probably the most diverse and interesting menu of hot dogs I've ever seen. I can't resist gourmet hot dogs so, when this place came up on an area Yelp search, I couldn't not go.
I got a bulgogi and a banh mi hot dog. Yeah... that banh mi. I've had bulgogi dogs before, and this was not the best I've had. I really enjoyed the banh mi though, which came with the shredded radishes and a spicy sauce, that did actually make it taste like its namesake. They had a few other ""specialty"" dogs that I only saw on the wall after I ordered, like a Santa Fe dog. So do look there first before you commit.
The bulgogi fries were really tempting but seemed like way too much. If I went back, I would try them though.
Dogs run about $4.50 each. Pricey for a Ballpark frank (they plump when you cook them because they're full of water and filler!) with relish from a packet, but not bad when you think about what you're actually getting. As they say on the menu, these are truly top-quality hot dogs too: all beef, all flavor.
I think it would be even better if you could take your specialty dog into the 24-hour brewpub next door, since they don't serve gourmet hot dogs, and Buldogis does not serve alcohol.",P-7VidyXqOGd6zBnT85pDA,0,0,4,orHaxH5cjCQF18nJJTQkOQ

I HIGHLY RECOMMAND THIS PLACE- 
VERY KOREAN & AMERICAN SOUL FUSIONS OF HOT DOGS & HAMBURGERS-
it is a faraway spot because the second spot it was competeing in Chinatown-
-the Owner is Black/White & has married a BEAUTIFUL KOREAN WOMAN-
which inspired his Korean Hotdogs & Hamburger fusions-
-He hand-makes & picks out his own ingredients & went to  Korea from any cities there-
-A VERY FRIENDLY PLACE-
-4 years running-
-workers are very pleasantly nice-
-i enjoyed everything about it-
-Bulgogi Hamburgers - Kimchi Hotdogs-
to Salads & it is expanding & they said they might open one in Henderson !!

As a Korean-American intuned IN Korean Culture- it makes me feel like home -

they are also food truck owners too 

they also will expand & working their alcohol license too & they will also soon will have MAKE YOUR OWN HOTDOGS- doesnt have to be Korean- it can be a Philly Dog too-

-trust me it is pretty worth it-

they got kicked out on SPRING MOUNTAIN !! 
LETS BRING THEM BACK TO A CLOSER LOCATION !!

you wont regret it- PROMISE -
 coming from a VERY PICKY KOREAN-AMERICAN EATER-

try the ANGRY DOGS, KIMCHI HAMBURGER- BULGOGI HAMBURGER-

10 min - 20 min wait depending how many people are there

And I'm glad I made the effort... These guys are doing a neat twist on simple ingredients.  They're making a killing on food cost if they're managing things well.  

I tried two today - and took half of each home.  (hint:  you need a ""dogi"" bag""!)    Their chili cheese dog is made with homemade chili - no beans (yay!), grated cheese and green onions.  The angry dog was the flavor winner but my bun was on the stale side...but I loved the flavor combination, the slaw, the spicy mayo and the fresh jalapenos...

They fry their dogs...and the dogs are nice sized... Lots of interesting ingredients and combinations.  

Whoever said their food was bland ordered blandly - this place is all about flavor...so ask the chef -- because he's definitely hospitable, large and in charge and very proud of what he's cooking.  Staff is proud to offer up tastes, too.  

They take credit cards.  No beer.   Only open til 9. Their menu would be  a great food truck concept...so I hope they jump in and take their place, if only for marketing their restaurant all over town...because this isn't a location that is an easy find by any means... it would perfect on the strip though -- for late night eating after a night of serious partying -- f&b folks take note.  It's exactly the kind of fun food chefs love to eat after a hard night on the line -- with a few beers -- and that's only one demand generator...  This is a great concept in the wrong location - but it's a good way to get their feet wet...hopefully you'll go find them to help them work out the concept kinks so they can be located where they truly need to be.

Good luck!",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,3,2,4,rmwMqEOeNy0wdY5gQpLIsg

We got there at 20 to 9 and it looked like they were almost cleaned up.  I felt so bad making a mess right before close.  But we were greated with a very nice hello and what can we get you?  No eye rolls or sighs at all!  Nice guys!  So we had 4 people and wanted to cut some in half to sample a few.

We ordered the Beef Bulgogi Dog, the Banh Mi Dog, the West Coast Dog, the Angry Bowl, the Angry Kimchi Fries and the Fried Pickles.  Put it this way we went a bit over board!  But we have heard so much we really wanted a sampling.  The Dogs hmm... I don't eat a whole lot of dogs but WOW, they popped when you bit into them and had a subtle smokey flavor then the fusion on top just kind of set it off!  The cook said they changed the way they make it recently and started to put the sauce on top.  I thought it made it look amazing but also helped hold the toppings on a bit.  The dogs were Great!

The Angry Kimchi Fries were a nice change I enjoyed them, however the BF didn't like the sweet potatoes he would have preffered regular potatoes.  I thought the sweet potatoes were a nice compliment to the spice of the kimchi on top.  The fried pickles sadly I have been ruined for life for fried pickles.  I will never again have the satisfaction of the pickles I had on a trip to the east coast. :(  The batter had good flavor but it was thick on top of the pickle which in turn took away from the flavor of the pickle.  The dipping sauce for it was great!  

The decor is nice and bright and made me smile the staff is super nice!  So the verdict is I will come back the BF says he wouldn't drive out there for it but I do the driving so I guess we'll be back!",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,3,2,4,JnKnluj6Yn_Y2mNfDJw7Pw

It's kinda small inside-they have a big board on one of their walls wiith lots of hand written specials....It was quiet when we walked in but once a group of teens came in the place was crowded and loud.

Smoked dog (spicy link, caramelized onions, cheddar, avocado mayo): underwhelmed. Average taste. Nothing great.

Euro special fries (pork belly bacon, cheddar cheese, herb blend, garlic mayo): quite a big portion. The bf and I couldn't even finish it. The flavors were bold--particularly the garlic mayo--maybe a tad bit too bold but still rather tasty.

I tried the veggie and veggie Italian dog. They have the option to make any of their dogs into a veggie or turkey dog. Awesome! Definitely try the Italian dog. The tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, green & red peppers and cheese is a yummy melody of food in my mouth.

Yummmmmmy is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to describing Buldogis!

So I know I am behind on getting over here but I finally made it here for lunch this week.  Woo Hoo!  I had some friends visiting and wanted to take them someplace they definitely don't have back home.  Mission success on that!  They were amazed at the menu and the crazy dogs they have at Buldogis.  I just love blowing people's minds when it comes to food.  He he.

Ok, on to the awesomeness know as Buldogis food!  I had the Buckeye Dog and Euro fries.  I was in love at the first bite of both things.  The Buckeye bog was the best dog I have EVER eaten in my life.  It sounds crazy with pork belly bacon, corn relish, cheddar, and garlic mayo all on a hot dog, but it totally works!  The flavors are intense but fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. It is like fireworks going off in your mouth.  Plus it comes covered in MAYO, which is my favorite condiment in the universe.  I mean it is even in my Yelp tagline.  I love me some mayo. Yum.

Oh and the Euro Fries....Drool.  This fabulous combination of fries, cheddar, pork belly, and guess what, more herb garlic MAYO on top.  What is not to love???  The fries are what will bring me back again and again for years to come.  Love them!!!!

My friends were a little more timid with their dogs and they went with the classic standby chili cheese dog and chili cheese fries.  I only tasted the fries and they were really tasty.  The chili is the beanless kind and quite flavorful.  I really liked it myself.  My friends both really enjoyed their dogs and fries.  

My mini me went with a corn dog.  It tasted like your average corn dog and wasn't super duper, but was tasty. Good news on the corn dog was that she actually ate 1/2 of it.  If you know her, you know that is amazing because she never wants to eat anything except cookie.  So success on getting a toddler to eat food too!

So the moral of the story is get yourself to Buldogis ASAP because your mouth will thank you for the flavor adventure!  Tasty!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,10,10,5,RCK2F7XUwIElBlAS3ZSbXA

I am not the biggest fan of hot dogs in general but a fusion hot dog, that is another story.  So I stopped in this last weekend.  I was mostly impressed.  I ordered a bulgogi dog after standing in line for a few minutes.  Usually I avoid standing in lines unless I am familiar with the place and love it so much.  But I had driven all that way and everything on the menu sounded good.  Besides, standing in line afforded me the time to decide which of the many hot dog creations I wanted to try.  As I mentioned before, I settled on the bulgogi dog.  I was not really sure what to expect.  What I got would have exceded any expectations I may have had had I gone in with any expectations.  What I got was friendly service, surprisingly good food and freshness.  I was impressed.  The all beef dog seemed more like a sausage.  It was plump and full of flavor.  Flavor of the good kind.  It taste like meat.  Not parts.  The beef on top was very tender and slightly sweet the way I know bulgogi to be.  For $4.95, not a bad deal.  Very fair.  Cheaper than Pinks.

After wiping the drool out of my mouth, I decided to make the trek from the strip to Buldogis for a nice lunch.  It was a little further of a drive than I had expected, but it was a drive that I was happy to make.  

I ordered the Banh Mi Dog and the Angry Kimchi Fries.  I thought that the Banh Mi Dog was phenomenal, but was a little disappointed with the angry fries.  They were not spicy at all and just had an overall blandness to them which surprised me given how many ingredients were in there.  The Banh Mi Dog was probably the greatest hot dog I ever had though.  The dog itself was so incredibly juicy and perfectly cooked.  The topping around it just complemented it and I wolfed that thing down as if the world was about to end.

I think if I could do it all over again I would try the Euro Fries instead of the angry fries.  It may just be that I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries.  

The service was also top notch.  The staff was incredibly polite and they made sure to check in with each person dining as well as wishing them well on the way out.

I got the off the menu hot dog that was named me - the Gang Nam Dog (hot dog, roasted pork belly, sliced cucumber, nori flakes, green onions, sesame seeds, Korean chili sauce). It tasted fantastic! Also tried a friend's Hawaiian Dog (hot dog, pork belly, pineapple salsa, g-onions, honey Dijon mustard), which had a nice welcomed slight sweetness from the pineapple and honey mustard. The Euro Special fries (pork belly bacon, cheddar cheese, herb blend, garlic mayo, fries) and the Carne Asada fries (beef bulgogi, 5 cheese blend. pico de gallo, diced jalapeno, chipotle mayo, avocado mayo, fries) were bomb with the carne asada one being more flavorful. One of my friend is a regular here so they hooked us all up with free drinks. Checking in on Yelp gets you a 10% discount. Staff are really friendly and helpful.

Sooo I've been meaning to bring my little Santiago here for a while; he loves hot dogs! I very rarely eat red meat, or pork, I basically only eat chicken and turkey. I'm super boring. It was Santiago,  myself, and mi amigo and this was our dinner. I was basically starving so I went with the Euro Special Fries and a chicken corn dog, Santiago ordered a puppy dog and small fries, and said friend ordered carne Asada Fries (Straight beaner! ) we had a seat and waited for our order. 

It didn't take too long when our food arrived. Being a awesome Yelper I snapped a photo of my fries before sucking them down like a hoover. Theyre simple, fries, pork belly bacon, cheese, and garlic mayo. They should have melted the cheese some, alas it was just cold cheese. The bacon was also a little crunchy or overcooked, but I was too enamored in my food to even care. The garlic mayo really sets the flavors off! Tye corn dog was super huge and not all nasty and over cooked. The center was juicy and the breading was crispy! Santiagos puppy was a half hot dog and it looked delectable,  he gobbled it right up, as with his fries. 

Said friend was only half pleased with his carne asada fries, he didn't like the caramelized onions and we both agreed they shouldve used a cream as opposed to the mayo. But he sucked them down as well! 

My only gripe is the mustard packets they had were gross. The mustard inside was a nasty color and it was hella thick. Trust me I do not mind thick at all, just this was nasty. Other than that I will def go again for those crack fries!!

My husband has a way of discovering places and then he has to hen peck me until I give in. I would probably go on the first request, but I think he enjoys 'talking me into something new'.. 
He has been talking up this place for a few months now. I am a pretty straightforward hot dog eater. Always have been. Throw a kosher dog in a bun with a few tomatoes and I'm happy. 
Nathans , sure, I a, the easiest person to server. Plain. Why dress up a dog? 
THIS PLACE IS WHY!
This ain't your mama's hot dog stand Mister!
Chicago Dog, yeah, had it. It always felt like you were trying to hide the fact it had a hot dog in it. New York style, I love me some Kraut on a dog like anyone else. STOP RIGHT THERE!

I saw the menu and was like, hmmm, these all look pretty inventive. Interesting combos. Wait, pastrami on a hotdog? What on earth are they trying to hide? I ordered the East coast. 
This guy had Pastrami, Sauerkraut, diced tomatoes and Buldogis Mayo. My husband ordered the Bahn Mi. We decided to share the Euro Special Fries. 

Look, I can be picky. But when I took a bite out of that dog, I wanted to cry! It was heaven. That SNAP of the giant dog was what ever single Hot Dog connoisseur wants to hear. That sudden burst of flavor seeping into your mouth. Get me the key to the door, cause I want in!
And to top it off, these perfectly cooked pastrami shreds, melding with delicious kraut, the coolness of the tomatoes and the smoothness of the Buldogis Mayo. Kill me now. I've found my last supper. 
I could go on for days about his Bahn Mi Dog but I want to skip right to the Euro Special Fries. Great, the fries are again, cooked perfectly. Surprise. But they are topped with the chunky sprinkling of pork belly, cheddar and again, an amazingly smooth garlic mayo sauce, that with each bite, you need to get every element to really appreciate it. Separately , delicious. But together, a symphony.  I know it's crazy, and I can't believe it myself to be this in love with... A HOT DOG PLACE, but holy cow! I want to try every one on the menu!

4348227,2012-03-31,12,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Hungry one late afternoon in Vegas, we decided to go off strip and try one of Minh's bookmarks that he had. Hot dogs sounded like they would totally hit the spot since i had been craving them for the past week!

Located in a large shopping center (it can be a bit tricky to find this place, as we were lost for a moment on the other side of the center). If you keep a look out for Chicago Brewing Company you are in the right spot my friend just look to your left err right and you will see it!

Walking up to Buldogis I noticed outside that they are pet friendly, a huge water bowl sat outside just waiting for the next thirsty doggy to come by. 

As we entered, we were greeted by a friendly hello from the cashier, the menu is posted above the register, but they also have menus on the tables if you do not feel like standing in front of the register with an I-don't-know-what-to-have look on your face.

There is a lot to choose from and for a first timer like me, I was going back and forth with myself on what my final decision would be to order.
I settled with getting:

Buckeye Dog- Pork belly bacon, Corn relish, Cheddar cheese, and Garlic Mayo.
We also ordered small fries, which had Italian Herb Parmesan cheese, and other special spices that they kept a secret from us!

After we placed our order, we sat down and waited for our food to be prepared. The dining area is on the smaller side but cozy. Two large plasma TV on each side of the room were showing either Food Network or The Travel channel. 

Our food was brought out to us by the cashier, it looked and smelled great. Let's dig in because I am hungry!

My Buckeye dog was huge; they piled on the topping and left no empty spaces between the hot dog and the super soft bun.

First intention was to just pick it up and bite into it as I usually do with a hot dog except I could not find a perfect spot to sink my teeth into. So I had to cut into that sucker with a knife and fork and eat it that way. The dog was juicy and not greasy at all. Warning if you are not careful half the toppings will either land on the table or in your lap, it's that messy!!

The small fries were enough for two people to share and came with ketchup to dip the fries into.

We left full and happy!

I had the Hawaiian Dog which came with pineapple salsa, onions and honey Dijon mustard. It was good but my low tolerance for salt ruined it for me. I also tried the Euro Special fries which I didn't expect to be so big . It is comparable in size to Carne Asada Fries at Robertos. . The fries had bacon , herbs, Parmesan cheese and garlic mayo. This was again too salty for me. I didn't want to give up on Buldogis though...I wanted to give them another try. 

The second time around I ordered the Angry Dog but on a vegetarian dog. The girl taking my order wanted me to know this dog had Pork Bulgogi as one of the toppings. I told her I didn't mind. She was probably wondering why a vegetarian would want pork on their hot dog. I ordered the vegetarian dog in the hopes it would be less salty then their beef dog and I was right! The flavor was perfect! It still had the taste of a normal hot dog. My dog also had Asian slaw, jalapenos, and fiery sauce. It was delicious! They also threw in a second dog for free because they accidentally made the first one wrong. I thought that was nice since I was extra hungry.

There was a great deal going on but it all came together nicely.  Drink lots of water as there stuff can be salty.  Staff was patient and friendly.

I kinda knew from photos and other reviews I wanted the Bulgogi Dog, I ordered a hot dog with just ketchup for my daughter, and Hubby created his own. We also ordered some french fries and sat down. 

We sat and took in all the decor! As we were waiting there was a steady stream of patrons coming through the door, the place filled up QUICK!!! I told my Hubby right away that's an awesome sign! The order taker brought us our food and it was ON. I loved every bite of my hot dog and the french fries were tasty. My Hubby LOVED the flavor of the hot dog and surprised me by saying so.

The restaurant is small but clean and welcoming. One of employees immediately greeted us (my co-worker and I) with a welcome and explained some of their items.

I ordered an Angry Dog (with extra jalepenos) and fries. What came out was a hotdog piled with vuliminous portions of spicy pork, slaw, and jalepenos. My poor bun succumbed to the weight of the toppings and fell apart. The use of utensils is inevitable. Amidst the mountain of toppings, I could still taste the salty goodness of the hotdog.

4603462,2013-05-26,1,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Creative concept. I love the idea of an East-Meets-West fusion, combining the most iconic elements of American and Korean culture.

We were in an ANGRY mood apparently when we went, because we got the angry burger, angry kimchi fries, and an angry dog. I loved the spicy kick of each of the items. The burger was juicy, with a hefty amount of toppings. It had an excellent grilled, slightly smokey flavor. The bulgolgi was nice, but I didn't see or taste much of it (Maybe the other stronger ingredients drowned out the bulgolgi flavor). Out of all the toppings for the burger, I was slightly disappointed in the coleslaw. I would have liked more tangy flavor to add to the burger, but it was just a minor flaw. The hot dog was good as well, with a combination of strong flavors complementing each other with each bite. The angry kimchi fries were my favorite item that we ordered. It was a huge portion of sweet potato fries, kimchi, bulgolgi, peppers, cheese, onions, and a fried egg on top. The combintation of sweet, sour, spicy, and creamy was amazing. 

This isn't healthy eating here in general, but they do have vegetarian options such as veggie dogs that can be substituted for any hot dog item on the menu.

My husband and I came for dinner and decided to eat outside since it was nice out. A little after we started eating an employee looked like they were taking their break to eat at another outdoor table. Within minutes what I'm assuming was the manager came out and started to discipline the worker and we could hear him clearly. Now I'm all for disciplining employees if they have done something wrong but not in front of customers who are trying to eat or outside where there are other patrons from the neighboring businesses outside stop to listen and watch. If something was wrong the employee should have been asked back to a private area. We felt really awkward because the discipliner was not quiet so we left without finishing our food.,XOCXW96-T0_ekYt22z_4VQ,0,0,3,V3Fxts1rOAUdNyxvJN_Q1Q

4656418,2014-01-26,5,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Meh. I really wanted to like Buldogis but it just didn't live up to the Yelp hype. 

I don't expect a hot dog restaurant to be extremely fancy but with the word ""gourmet"" in the name they could work on the decor a little bit. One of the things that really bothered me was the excessive use of demanding signage everywhere within the restaurant. There was one that specified that there is a 2 napkin limit allowed per customer which is ridiculous when you realize how messy these hotdogs really are. Apparently there's a camera watching you above the napkin dispenser - So I took 5, what can I say I'm a little rebel.

I ordered the Angry Dog which was spicy pork, asian slaw, spicy mayo, and jalapeños (fresh raw jalapeños) on top of a hot dog. These things are massive and I would recommend sharing with a friend if you want to order fries as well. I felt like the toppings were just too much at one time. I don't think I appreciate meat on meat on meat but that could be just me. It was salty and overwhelming rather than complementary. I think that their execution could be done with more finesse and it looked as though everything was just thrown on.

I also had the ""Carne Asada"" fries which were pretty average as well. Upon further thought I realized I should've ordered the Angry Kimchi sweet potato fries which seems to be more popular and could have balanced out the saltiness of the hot dogs. 

I mean the meats are good but not extraordinary, same goes for the toppings. Combined with the average service (they completely forgot my best friend's order) and average decor I really don't have the urge to return anytime soon.

4664205,2013-07-20,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"I now know why the chili cheese fries were more than the hot dog.  Maybe they should offer half orders of it?  They should also take down the user pics that show the cc fries are $2.95.

My review of the items scale = 1-10
Smokey Dog - 7: It was definitely smokey, but it says it's a spicy link and it wasn't very spicy.  My personal preference is for the condiments to be on the bun and the meant and things like onions, slaw, cheese to be on top.  Overall it was a pretty tasty dog.  Had a good snap.  $4.95 is a pretty good price.
Chili Cheese Fries - 7: big size, good flavor, just wish they had a 1/2 order since I was flying solo.
Soda - 7:  Not a Pepsi or Pepsi product fan.  Had the orange crush, would have preferred coke.  Maybe Yelp should list whether the establishment is Coke, Pepsi, or Other.

Overall pretty decent.  They also have burgers and other items added.  The pictures of the burgers looked pretty good.  It's been my experience that when a restaurant adds things outside of their normal menu, it's a sign of distress.  I might be wrong on this as I am always rooting for the small guy.  If they add breakfast, then, Taps may not be too far behind.

The addition of lunch specials may not be a bad idea and maybe just regular plane jane dogs with kraut, spicy mustard, onions etc.  Who knows.",XPNiTbrKL7f0_6L0lrbZlg,1,0,4,KFx_E8BKtvZJc_goiRQnBw

We tried to do an online order but it didn't work (slightly inconvenient), and to be honest, I was wishing the spicy Korean sauce for the wings was actually spicy. It was less of a gochujang sauce and more like a sweet chili sauce. This is surprising since the angry kimchi was actually very spicy and I liked it.

I know I know, Food Network has glamorized food trucks with their shows. But, at my former work place, we called them roach coaches for a reason. So, grumbling I went. I figured it can't be all that bad if it says gourmet dogs right? They must pizazz it quite a bit. Sorry, I don't go eating hot dogs for dinner. Gone are my hot dog and ramen days. It's across from Chicago Brewing where I go for a beer now and then. I roll my eyes every time I see the sign. So my best friend is Korean and I've eaten home cooking and gone to tons of Korean restaurants. I am pretty sure if they were to make a hot dog it would probably taste better. Want a burnt hot dog with kimchi on top? By all means you found the joint. The hot dogs aren't event big. Nathan's hot dogs in one of the downtown casinos is better in downtown and about 1/4 the price. I usually get the polish sausage at Costco and hot dog at Sam's Club. Those two fulfill my hot dog craves. And they are a heck of a lot bigger and taste asps without being burnt or some kimchi thrown on top. Man, and they call it gourmet hot dogs. I have a plastic jar of kimchi from Greenland. I think the concept would be about similar if I slap it on a hamburger and call it a gourmet dinner every week when I am cooking. Honestly, if you pan fry kimchi it will come out about the same as this restaurant. Needless to say, I was not blown away from their concept or what they put into their Buldogis.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,2,3,2,rRzVrBQMt9IG_-dNjMx7pw

4870424,2014-06-30,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"One of the things I miss most from Chicago are Gourmet Hot Dogs Done Right. Buldogis goes a long, long way to filling that void.

I've had 4 or 5 different dogs from them now, and every one of them has been phenomenal. If you are a former Chicagoan like me who was weaned on Hot Dougs and Frank's n' Dawgs, be warned that all the dogs are a ""normal"" Hot dog base. No elk sausage fanciness here; all the goodness is in the toppings. (match your expectations to your venue, yelp)

Similarly to Komex, Buldogis soars in the realms of contrast and texture. Salty crunchy crispy sweet meaty gooey juicey...all of these are combined and woven across the various dogs into a palette of beefy deliciousness. Every dog tastes different, and wonderful. You can get a filling meal for under $10, and there's a huge variety. I think I actually slightly prefer the Bahn Mi over the Buldogi...but both are lip smackin'.

The owner (I think?) has been the one to help us on more than a few occasions, same guy, at any rate, and he is the nicest person. The first time we'd stopped in, we had planned on getting takeout, since we had the dog in the car, when we noticed they had a patio. Checked with the fellow behind the counter to make sure it would be okay if we stayed, and he brought our pup out a free mini hot dog and a little cup of water. Which was pretty awesome. (our dog is a corgi, so there were dog sausage cannibal jokes to be had)

Pros;
- Great food, people, price, and variety.
- Fried. Pickles. 
- Easy parking, easy to reach off strip location.
- Dog friendly staff and patio.
- Probably a great place to bring a kid, especially one who's a little bit adventurous food wise.

Cons;
- Sort of a little restaurant, so probably not great for a group.
- It's not fast food, and if it's busy and you didn't call ahead, your order might take a few minutes. Definitely worth waiting for, but something to plan ahead.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,0,0,4,eMtfLYWzprB9JNOZ8QkUIg

Chili Cheese fries - fries were cooked nicely for a chile cheese fry order.  A little crispy on the fries but not too much.  The chili was interesting - think it had corn in it.

The dog was laden with a lot of hot kimchi and habanero, and after eating half of it, I had to stop as I couldn't feel anything. I finished my meal by eating carne asada fries, which were amazing and I like the Asian fusion aspect of it. 

I was very impressed that there is food out there that actually was too spicy for me!

I ordered the Angry Dog, which was a hot dog, topped with spicy pork, slaw, chopped jalapenos and spicy mayo.  I'm not a fan of eating two types of meat at the same time, (i.e. Pastrami Hamburger) but damn, this was one good hot dog!  First off, the hot dog they used had to be one of the most flavorful, robust tasting dog I've ever had, hands down beating every hot dog/polish dog I've had at Costco and AT&T Park.  That was definitely some premium stuff, which is a major plus!  But paired with the spicy pork and the other stuff, it was so delicious!!!

The s/o ordered the Banh Mi Dog and had the same sentiments about the quality of hot dog.  The s/o really liked the Banh Mi Dog, especially the slaw that it was served with.

The s/o also ordered their Angry Kim Chi fries and I ordered their Classic Buldogis Fries.  The Classic Buldogis Fries had a light seasoning but, I'd definitely suggest going for the Angry Kim Chi fries.  We didn't know what to expect as to how it would taste so when it came out, it was one steamy pile of Korean inspired goodness, with fried egg on top.  Just grab a fork, mix it all together and have it.  That was truly one unique order of fries, none like we've ever had before.  Everything paired well together; the egg, the kim chi, the spicy pork, cheese and jalapenos.  You can say it's the Korean version of Carne Asada fries.

I'd totally recommend checking out Buldogis if you're in their neck of the woods, it's definitely worth a visit, as we'll definitely come back when we're back in the LV!",-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ,1,1,5,kCut668H8IrpIT3YeNhiEg

Plus, my wife and I tried some deep fried pickle spears, and they were really good, as well as their dipping sauces; one was a really flavorful ranch, another was a barbeque with hints of Korean seasoning, and then a spicy mayo/mustard mix.  The hot dogs are really large and they don't skimp on any of the fixings they put on top as well.  Really good place for really good hot dogs!",FQsbJx12jvFYxzKy6RdPSw,0,0,4,hMVmMPtnjaxEhAM8l8c5Tg

Hawaiian Dog (pork belly, pineapple salsa,grilled onions, honey mustard) - The hotdog used itself was really good. More like a sausage and had some snap when you bite in. The added pork belly was something I ate separately since it just felt extraneous. 

The BF got the Bahn Mi Dog (pork belly, bahn mi slaw, siracha mayo ) which was a bit better with the pork belly and that one had crispier pork unlike mine. 

We shared a large of their buldogis fries which was good. I like somewhat thick fries that are a bit crisp yet soft like that. 

It seemed like the hot dog itself is quality, I was just not convinced by the combination of it with meat on top. Next time I'll try just a plainer dog or try the meat in a bowl and I'm pretty sure I'll like it much better.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,1,3,X4saSh0FV5LzIl-i_Vvc4w

I'm located all the way in Seven Hills area and decided to take a trip to Summerlin just to try this place out. This is located on Sahara and Fort Apache. Quite a distance but still worth the journey.

I Ordered the Bulgogi Dog and a drink all for $10- $11 including tip, a bit pricey but hey these are freaking gourmet hot dogs! The Bulgogi dog was amazing!! The bulgogi itself had a good texture not to rubbery or chewing along with the hot dog. The size is pretty decent, you might want to order two hot dogs to fill you up if your a big eater like myself. Overall the hot dog was the bomb and I would like to go back and order more next time. I had to save my stomach to try another establishment next door. But overall, I give this place a 4 star, can't complain.

The fusion style dogs are different in a good way.  The Banh Mi Dog was great with the sirracha mayo and slaw but the Angry Dog; what did I do to you?  The sausage is spicy and delicious but add the hot sauce and jalapenos and my mouth was on fire.  Add more heat with the angry kimchi fries; OMG! (OK so I did add a side of jalapenos so this is kinda my fault).

The fries (what I could taste) were overly sweet if eaten on their own.  Break the egg yolk and make a gooey mess out of the whole thing,  the heat abates and you have good eats.

A spot I consider to be the only accepted form of Korean fusion. True fusion isn't simply stock-piling ethnic ingredients in non-ethnic foods. It's about merging 2 cuisines together to create something special. *sunshine and rainbows over*

I wanted to try a little of everything so we ordered a Korean Hangover Soup + Kangnam (Gangnam) Dog + Angry Kimchi Fries. The soup had a homemade quality to it. I'm not sure exactly what kind of soup it is but I want to say it's like a not-so-spicy Yukgaejang w/ chicken instead of beef. It's a savory and not-too-salty broth with an herbal tone filled with tasty vegetables, chunks of chicken and dangmyeon (sweet potato noodles). I could probably live without hot dogs. Although they use 100% premium beef franks, I still get a sick feeling after eating one. It's either guilt or nitrates eating away at my soul. The Kangnam was tasty but I think their Bulgogi Dog would've been a better choice. I am totally obsessed with their Angry Fries. They look absolutely terrifying when they approach the table. Sweet potato fries topped with spicy pork, fried kimchi, an egg and other goodies. It sounds like an artery blocker because it is. But surprisingly, Korean food and sweet potato marry perfectly in this paper plate.

In summary, I am no longer the anti-Christ of Korean fusion. It can be done and Buldogis does it well. Can't wait to be back to try their Carne Asada (bulgogi) Fries!",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,16,15,5,0KiOpgzF7ExsjDa_cfodyw

The meat flavors didnt' mix.   After a few bites, I really couldn't tell the difference between the sauce, the onions, the coleslaw, the bulgogi and the hotdog.

Honestly, I wanted to like the concept alot.  But somehow low end hot dogs just doesn't deserve to be called gourmet, no matter what you pile on it.   Thats like taking a cow, slap on a tutu and calling it a ballerina!  Meh.

After people threw out a bunch of suggestions we decided to swing by Buldogis to try their infamous hot dogs (and to undo all calorie burning we did earlier).  These were definitely not your average hot dogs.  They were topped with some unique toppings and were much more filling than the typical hot dog you picture in your head.

Here is what I ordered

Angry Kimchi Fries (7.95) - Sweet Potato Fries, spicy pork bulgogi, kimchi, cheese, sunny side up egg, green onions, and jalapenos.  I like all of the components of this dish separately and in my head I thought why not put them together.  For the most part it was good, but I think if I were to order this again I would try to see if I could get regular fries instead of sweet potato.  But if you want to try something really different and maybe a little confusing for your taste buds, this might be for you.  

*They give good portions of everything!  My intention was to share this with the whole group, except 3/5 of us order fries and all of a sudden were had a fry overload...which isn't totally a bad thing, but we didn't really come close to finishing all of the fries on top of our hot dogs. 

Beef Bulgogi Dog (5.95) - A good sized hot dog topped with bulgogi, slaw, green onions, and flavored mayo.  Really yummy and definitely made for a meat lover.  It had great flavors and was filling.  The hot dog bun didn't do too well in holding up, but my knife and fork helped me out in finishing it

The baby size hot dog was a cool idea.  I think it only cost about a dollar, but a cool way for the baby to have some without having to share or make us buy an entire hotdog to go to waste.  Look for it if you have a kid with a small appetite.

The menu is pretty authentic (insofar asinine legit Korean staples with American hot dogs and fries).

Whoever was working the counter came by and checked on me twice AFTER bringing my food. Sweet, genuine girl. Most importantly, the hot dogs themselves were fantastic. Casing didn't explode with hot grease when it bit into it, and was just the right temperature. Toppings were ample, but not such that I couldn't take a whole bite and get all the flavors. Only criticism is have is that the ketchup supply could be changed. They have a generic packet supply and I must have gone through at least 10 of them for my fries and one hot dog.

I wasn't feeling like a dog, but I have been meaning to try the Angry Kimchi Fries for some time now.

As you might suspect, I could have done with more kimchi! (I almost ordered a side.) And perhaps a bit more layering of the cheese, but now I am just being persnickety. 

The service was the best you could receive at a casual spot like this. Super friendly at the counter.

However, for every review that I do put on yelp I stand by it completely, if only because I (like many of y'all) am a big foodie at heart (a certain somebody that overdoes it on yelp would disagree with me though)...

... but all this brings me to my current review. I was brought over to this place from the multitude of repeated check-ins of a good buddy of mine. When he first described this place to me, I stupidly responded, ""What, you mean the place that used to be a Quiznos?"" ... after a short argument about the validity of life, we were here! They still had the Quizno's ""OPEN"" sign at the time too, which was great.

The atmosphere inside this place feels more like a quick lunch hotspot more than anything else, which is both very quaint and very relaxing. The service inside is nice, friendly, and very homely. Most importantly, the bathroom is very clean. Judge me how you will, but a messy bathroom is not a good place to be.

After deciding on what to order (I got two specialized dogs while my buddy got the ""Angry Kimchi Fries"") and it arrived at the table, honestly I was surprised. The hotdog bun is normal, something you can probably get at a supermarket, but that's about as far as ""normal"" goes. These things were HUGE; if I had to imagine it way bigger than my stomach was supposed to probably handle on a normal lunch.

The feeling you get when you bite into something that's delicious is indescribable (picture Ratatouille description of 'flavors' and you'll get the general idea of it), but their Bulgogi Dog was amazing. The mix of flavors from the hotdog to the beef on top created a nice mixture of tang and salt that makes you crave for more, where the Hawaiian Dog infuses enough sweetness to say ""Mmmm..."" This place is one of the few times that describing flavors would fail me, as there's just enough on the menu for everybody. And those Angry Kimchi Fries? In a nutshell, it's sweet potatoes + kimchi + bulgogi + spiciness pretty much all blended together into an amazing complement.

To anybody in the area? I would say ""go eat there, you can't go wrong.",5hMoSaLGjzXUr-1W_8L32w,0,0,5,nnUZHDc49mR8GQUSTKZ10A

5232715,2011-11-23,2,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"In retrospect, as I put this in writing, I'm sort of embarrassed about the amount of food my friend and I ordered. 3 hot dogs and an order of fries? That SOUNDS reasonable, right? Oops, $20 worth of food from this place was enough to feed a small army. We looked like we hadn't eaten in a month. This is the first pieces of advice I have for you, Yelp - these little dogs are mighty filling and the fries are HUGE.

We ordered the smoked dog, the hawaiian dog, the philly cheese steak dog (on special that month), and the euro fries. By the time we'd devoured the 3 dogs, there was no way we could even make a dent in the fries ! Each dog was loaded with meat and cheese and yummy sauces. So delicious! The dogs themselves were of very high quality and the buns were tasty as well. My only disappointment was that the philly cheese steak dog isn't around 24/7, because that was the best one we tried!

5319930,2013-01-18,1,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"I got this place bookmarked for months and I've been wanting to eat some unusual hotdogs and that's exactly what I got from this place.  Buldogi's is located behind Chicago Brewery - my GPS had me go around the Regal Village Square lot.  My patience paid off.

There's a menu on each table as well as behind the register.  There's also a white board on the wall to the left of the kitchen/register where you'll find a list of burgers and other items not on the menu.  We ordered 2 beef bulgogi dogs, a banh mi dog, buckeye dog and 2 Euro special fries.  We got our food in 10-15 minutes.  They had an NBA game on so I was happy.

Beef Bulgogi Dog:
You get pieces of bulgogi on top of a hotdog with some green onions, bulgogi mayo and sesame seeds.  The bulgogi flavor balances the saltiness of the hotdog. I'd give it a 4/5

Banh Mi Dog:
You had me at PORK BELLY!  It also has shredded carrots, cucumber and sriracha mayo.  4/5

Buckeye Dog:
I saved the best for last.  I thought the banh mi dog was delish then I had a buckeye dog with PORK BELLY BACON, garlic mayo, corn and cheese.  It was like neon lights and fireworks in my mouth! Definitely 5/5!

Euro Special Fries:
Crispy potatoes with cheddar cheese, pork belly bacon, herbs and garlic mayo. You have to eat 'em with a fork. After eating 2 hotdogs, trying to finish a basket of fries seemed almost impossible but they're sooo good I had to finish my fries. 4.5/5

I must say though, the garlic mayo has a pretty intense garlic flavor (YUUUUUMMMM!!!) - you can tell they use real garlic and not just garlic powder.  Between the Euro fries and the buckeye dog, I had garlic breath x 2 - good thing I didn't have to be somewhere with someone after eating at Buldogi's.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,3,4,DOeOOlRWPYx7RLl6wjGfBw

The Gangnam had pork belly, cucumbers, furikake, and a Korean chili sauce. Everything was pretty flavorless. Just an overwhelming saltiness from the actual hot dog. The BF had the Angry Kimchi and I took a bite. Definitely spicy and the kimchi was pretty good. Euro fries had a garlic mayo that, at first, was delicious but after a few bites became overpowering. Cheese quesadilla was a cheese quesadilla (no complaints from my kid).

5374316,2012-01-08,0,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"My friend and I came in for an early dinner before going to the movies. We drove around and kept missing it, but after a closer look at Google Maps, it is tucked away between Chicago Brewing Company and Jack in the Box.

As soon as you walk in, there is a slew of employees ready to greet you. We were told to have a seat and look at the menu before going up to the counter to order. Aziz B. does not eat pork and I was becoming concerned because everything I was looking at had some kind of pig product. Turns out that my eyes tend to wander towards this beast, because he was able to find choices just fine. 

When Buldogis gets it right, they get it really right. Aziz B. was impressed with both his Chili and Bulgogi Dogs. Two of these large creations was enough to stuff him to the point where he barely touched our large fries. I had ordered two dogs as well. I found the hot dogs to be very flavorful, but borderline salty. The Banh Mi Dog was great in concept, but ended up not being my standout favorite. The pickled veggies did not have the sweet and tart bite that I love in a Vietnamese sandwich. The regular bun also detracts because an expected crunch is the best part about a Viet sub. The pickle juice also made the bun go soggy. It was a brilliant idea to reconstruct that texture with the crispy bacon, but then both meats just overpower the rest of the ingredients. I also wished that they used fresh cilantro instead of the dried stuff. Maybe this is why my friends don't go with me to Vietnamese places... Now on to why I give Buldogi 4 stars. The Angry Dog was everything I was hoping for. As the one I first ate, I hit my zenith early. The Asian slaw had a light sesame taste without over killing the harmony. The jalapenos and spicy mayo added the perfect amount of heat. The spicy pork on top was tender and plentiful. At first $4.95 for a hot dog might seem like a lot, but they pile the condiments on high. These are not skimpy portions. Two dogs teetered on the line of gluttony for me. Unlike my friend, I finish our fries($2.25). 

Now that I have tried their hot dogs, I want to come back for their rice bowls. It is beneficial to take a look at their specials wall. It is not on the menu, but hard to miss.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,0,4,4tfnPtEV52GGYx5MsIxXiQ

I like hot dogs too, so it was an easy decision to try this place out. I went with a coworker who expressed his doubts about the place yet reluctantly accompanied me. I will admit that if you get fries and a hot dog, it's rather pricey for lunch. He asked if they had combo meals...hehehe. I ordered the Banh Mi hot dog and the angry kimchi fries with a soda. My total came to $12 and change. He ordered the buckeye dog and the Euro Special fries. The place was packed so there was a little wait time for our food. The portions for the fries were huge. I could have ordered the fries alone and still not been able to finish. The banh mi hot dog was flavorful, but not enough to make it worth the $5 I paid for it. I've had hot dogs of equal taste at Sonic or Weinerschnitzel. My friend concurred on his hot dog as well. The fries however stole the show! The Angry Kimchi fries were packed with huge flavors, and just when I thought I had tasted it all, a new texture or spiciness punched me in the mouth. I thought the jalapenos were fresh and zesty. The kimchi was heated yet still maintained the crunchy veggie texture that I love. The sweet potato fries were salty, sweet and crunchy. The melted cheese sort of calmed the dish down, yet infused a nice melted gooeyness into it. The bulgogi was tender and mildly spicy. All together I loved the fries and will most definitely order them again. My friend's Euro Fries were also scrumptious.

I'm not a huge fan of hotdogs. They just taste like hotdogs to me. But this Banh Mi dog succeeded in bringing flavor and uniqueness to what would otherwise be a boring hotdog.  I especially enjoyed the cucumbers. 

The fries were hot and fresh. The seasoning blend is light and almost imperceptible. I got a side of garlic aioli for fry dipping. The aioli was different than what I've had before. This one had a mustard flavor in addition to it. I wasn't a fan and won't be spending $0.75 again.

5517584,2016-10-07,3,WRQ-9LluyivReFiQZFUujw,"Fusion is such a fun concept! You get a few of your fave things together and it's like tastebuds dream come true. After dropping the toddler to his class, the hubs decided to make a quick drive to buldogis. Initially, he felt like heading to another hotdog establishment that was just a walk away from the toddler's class...but rarely does the idea of eating hotdogs for lunch is a thought in this family. If we are gonna go in might as well go all out...cheat day has arrived!

We enter around 130 and I was glad to see it empty with the exception of 1 other customer who we followed in. I kinda knew what I wanted to try, and it was a matter of rushing the husband to get his life together so we can order. He was too busy staring at the hangover soup. No, stop staring at the soup...you aren't hungover...and we came for weiners..so pick which weiner you are going to shove into your mouth! Pastrami? Finally. Okay, so husband opts for pastrami as he still stares at the hangover soup. Which btw, the pastrami isn't listed on their online menu for reference so I don't exactly know what was in his aside from the weiner, tomatoes, and thin cuts of pastrami. 

I ordered whatever righteous banh mi lover would...the banh mi. It had the weiner, slices of carrots and radish that you'd find in an actual banh mi, crispy pork belly atop, and some herb seasoning along the bun, and parsley lightly sprinkled on to it. 

Unfortunately, looks deceived. I didn't get that banh mi hotdog experience i was expecting. Perhaps I was too literal, but flavor wise was very underwhelming to me. The pickling of the carrots and radish was not evident. I felt the sriracha mayo should have been squirted on there a little more heavily. All my tastebuds picked up was the hot dog, crispy pork belly, and what heat I got from the sriracha. I was really hoping to get that banh mi flavor plus hotdog! And i didnt. So at $7.25 I felt a tad bummed because while I thought it wasn't bad, it just fell short. 

My husband thought the same thing. He ate it with no comment so I knew he wasn't mind blown. Later he commented that if the hotdog was around the 5 dollar range the he would have felt different. But at 7.25 and you dont get any perk like a drink or fries with it...he wasnt thrilled. I'd probably come back for the euro fries as raved on other reviews or to try something different. I know for sure I wouldn't take my children here because they don't appreciate hotdogs like that and that'll become a steep bill with drinks and side orders to consider. They're gonna have to explore fusion hotdogs on their own time later in life. Gotta let them have something left to explore on this planet. Lol.

Customer service was very friendly and prompt, restaurant was clean, menu boards everywhere so there's no way you won't be able to find it, seat yourself, and coke vending... =)

Recommend giving them a try for sure! Kid and stroller friendly. A couple tables outside for outdoor seating.

One hot dog is very filling, and with a side of regular or, even better, chili cheese fries, it could be a little difficult to finish it all. When you come here for a hot dog, keep in mind that it's definitely not the most healthy food choice.

My wife and I aren't hot dog fans. They're usually the last on our list of fast food choices but we couldn't resist checking this place out for food creativity sake. 

We got a chili cheese dog, a bulgogi dog using the vegetarian dog and the angry kimchi fries. My order of the bulgogi with vegetarian wiener seemed to perplex them so they let me know bulgogi was beef. I just didn't feel like having certain cow parts that evening :) 

Both dogs were really tasty. The bun wasn't a run of the mill and bought at Costco bun which made it feel more gourmet. I loved the flavor of the angry kimchi fries but I would've preferred regular potato over sweet. 

The staff and owner were really nice. They had made an extra bread pudding by mistake and gave it to us for free. The owner told us they make their pudding out of the 2 day old buns they buy direct from a local bakery in town. We had never tried it before since bread pudding always seemed like a way too heavy over the top kind of dessert in restaurants (bread before the entree....and after??) but liked the sweet caramel flavor of this pretty dense ""cake"".

Sorry to reprot: I was disappointed in the food.  We ordered a Bahn Mi & a Buckeye hot dog plus an order of fries.  

I wanted to love this place but this is one bandwagon I simply cannot get with.  Basically, you get a hot dog topped with a garrish array of competing ingredients.  The food didn't go together.  The toppings and the dog were not in harmony.  It is kinda like when the Houston Rockets teamed Olajuwon with Drexler and then added Barkly.  Three great players but they just didn't seem to go together. 

The Buckeye dog - pork belly, corn, cheese and mayo-  just didn't work.
The Bahn Mi - Pork belly, slaw, siracha mayo- just didn't work.

The fries were just normal too.  They were supposed to have parm cheese but I tasted nothing.  Maybe a sprinkle of some spice mixture and that's it.

I didn't even finish the hot dogs or the fries.  This place has great reviews - so by all means check it out.  This is just one guy's opinion.  I guess I just like my dogs with some kraut and mustard...",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,2,0,2,P_GgapykDqjl2eNL4EkivQ

Props to everyone working there for being super friendly.  Almost too friendly.  Since it was dogs, I sort of anticipated a chi-town or zoo-york 'tude but not so Joe.  They have a big chalk menu on the back wall but as you face the cute girl and the register there is a menu behind her.  Too much visual overload so I just ask for what is popular.  At 3pm, there are about 6 patrons eating in-house and I take that as a good sign for an off-time.

Based on the recommendation I opted for their Philly Cheese Steak hotdog, ""sweet fries"" and a Mt. Dew.  If you gonna do it, dew it!  Never had sweet fries or whatever they were called but I will probably just opt for chips next time.

Quickly I was served at my table with a great looking work of art hotdog. Certainly photo worthing and to quote a Seinfeldism...sponge worthy...whatever the hell that means.  I wolfed down the dog and was on my way.  Where I was sitting I did not see a garbage can so asked if I was to buss my own table.

The food was ok.   Maybe I was expecting deeper richer flavors?   The bulgogi didn't seem seasoned enough and the garlic aioli didn't taste nice.  But the hot dog itself was absolutely delicious.

However are there's in a paradigm shift with the food here and it concerns me. 

The last 2 trips here left me a underwhelmed and disappointed. 

It seemed that the love is lost with the food.The food prep, taste and presentation was far from the standard that I've come to expect from this place. 
1.The meat topping on the dog and fries were huge clumps and tasted like a dirty burnt grill.
2. The bun was wet (not from the sauce) but from what I assume was condensation from pulling it out of the freezer. 
3. There were huge chunks of veggies on both items. rest There seemed to no love or craftsmanship with the food prep. 
4. The food prep killed this dishes I don't want to sound like I am exaggerating on this but the chunkyness of the toppings caused you to eat them separately, failing to blend the flavors properly. I'd get a mouthfull of meat on one bite and then a mouthfull of veggies on another....   

I don't want to criticize too much as I have always been fond of the food here it has missed the mark the last 2 times.

I ordered the Gangnam dog which was topped with pork belly and pickled cucumber and my friend and I shared an angry kimchi fries, but switched out the sweet potato fries for regular fries. 

The service was friendly and quick and we had our food in no time. The food looked so pretty, it made for a perfect picture opportunity.

My dog was good, nothing to write home about, but it was decent and I enjoyed the toppings more than the actual hot dog since it got a little wrinkly and shriveled after the cooking process. The fries were well cooked. I have a feeling I might enjoy plain fries more if I were to come back, instead of the ones with all the toppings. The fries themselves were perfectly cooked and while I enjoyed all the toppings, including the nicely cooked egg, I found myself picking out the plain fries to enjoy by themselves.

Overall, I enjoyed our meal, but I don't think I'd make this a regular stop on my foodventures.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,5,3,pVGN8xZ1JwNuhpHe4Fp63w

We also had the carne asada fries. Dang great tasting dish. All fresh ingredients and the taste of the meat the entire dish was awesome - I wish I ordered it. 
The only negative is this the fried pickle spears. Now I might be picky, but for a place that provides great tasting FRESH ingredients on the hot dogs and carne asada fries - I watched the employee take the breaded pickles out of the freezer, out of the store bought bag and place them in the fryer. Now I will say the fried pickle spears are tasty - BUT - you guys can do better - make them fresh. Make some awesome breading and put your own mark on those pickles. That said I will be back great tasting food.  
Employee that greeted us was very friendly and outgoing.  Now the place did smell a bit greasy - I'm hoping that's why the contractor was there looking at the vent hoods
Very enjoyable food.
One star deduction for the frozen fried pickle spears.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,0,0,4,1OuI0hlfvvFU63yIAgwc8A

I ordered the beef bulgogi dog which had good flavors. Although, the condiments were piled high and a little messy I thought it had bold flavors and was interesting. 

My husband ordered the banh mi dog which he ate pretty fast so I know he enjoyed it. He also ordered us carne asada fries to share with an egg on top. 

Overall, this place was very interesting and I enjoyed their food.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,3,4,9MWgNRbepjFZ7TIx5WUBZA
