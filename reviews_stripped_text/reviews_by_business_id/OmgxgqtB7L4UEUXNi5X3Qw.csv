Food never disappoints....just ordered some as I type! Lol,DyAHiPuTguZr-Zj5R66DCg,0,0,5,oWSiJ_L00E0-D6WH0W4wHw

624608,2016-05-16,0,OmgxgqtB7L4UEUXNi5X3Qw,"Been really curious about this place ever since they had a sign up saying they would be open by Oct. 2015, they didn't open till Feb. of 2016. My partner and I always drive by this location almost every day and always ask ourselves ""I wonder how good this place is?"" Well today after many months of contemplating we finally decided to order for dinner. We placed our order through phone; and was confused as to why their website has certain items on their menu and the gentleman on the phone told me otherwise. (this is the reason why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5) Long story short we were able to order the six piece option after being connected with a different employee. Upon arriving for pick up, the restaurant was clean inside and looked real nice. They took the extra time to make it stand out. I had to wait about 8 mins from the moment I paid till the moment I received my food. No big deal because I knew I was getting very fresh food. Now to the actual food. AMAZING, really great wings in the Las Vegas area. We ordered mild and hot, and let me tell you, they do not get better than this. Love how the wings are not dry at all. Very juicy and full of flavor. And their side order of fries are just enough for my partner and I, and their only 2 bucks! Really good pricing here. They give BWW and Wingstop a run for their money. Way better quality of food for a decent amount of money. Will definitely be returning here from time to time. Keep up the good work fellas.",3uUsLd9P-u1e-_Ygd0j8Dw,3,0,4,5ku9xx0z836ypgwPPobzYQ

It is finger licking good the only bad thing was that it was super hot in there! The poor employee's must be hot in there..,ieGHFaT4hQGgviYLBeTNAA,0,0,5,Bqm6F9c_mL1nozmM1wo1Tg

We usually have to drive further out for some decent wings! I have only tried their mild chicken wings and side order of fries. They are amazing. Very tasty, and juicy. The fries aren't salty at all. Their ranch could be a bit thicker but fine the way it is. The food is decently priced. Tasted way better than what I was expecting. Monday's are .50Â¢ wing day! I am giving it a four star due to the fact their website menu needs to be updated. I called my order in. I'm sure they thought I was crazy since I was ordering something they weren't familiar with. They did do their best to attend me. Overall, I this is a place that needs to be put out there!  I hope it stays in business for a long time. I'll definitely be a usual customer.",5Y_p-xmfCl3rI-4_cEGW_Q,2,0,4,CU3lWVG6oXtmxbTpKBOmLw

2056630,2016-07-23,0,OmgxgqtB7L4UEUXNi5X3Qw,Disappointing. More like King of Itty bitty little wings. They were Cornish hen sized wings. We giggled when we opened the box. Tasted ok. Nothing to rave about. We got the 24 wing combo with fries. Huge box of regular straight laced fries you get frozen at the grocery store. Nothing special. It was pricier than Wingstop. Smelled like they lit a doob before I walked in which made the wait a little more worth it. Staff was friendly ;),QGxTzS8u1uvERnc8ZbF2tw,1,0,3,dfBgSiV2MCfYThxioBetpQ
2082595,2018-04-24,0,OmgxgqtB7L4UEUXNi5X3Qw,"It's now 11:18 and the website says this place opens at 11. Sign says open but the door is locked and no one is answering the phone. What BS! I purchased a groupon to try this place out and now I'm outside waiting. There are no hours listed on the door or Windows. So now I'm hungry and upset I wasted my money on a groupon to
Try this place out. This does not make me want to come back at all. 

Update:
I went back on Sunday evening to use my groupon. Went trough the drive through cuz they have no indoor or outdoor seating. We placed our order for chicken fingers. I show the cashier my groupon she takes the number and marks it redeemed. A few minutes after she comes back and tell us they have no more chicken fingers. She did not know how to refund my money or give me a credit or gift card for my groupon. She took down my name and number for the manager to call me. 2 days later not one person has called me! Such lousy mismanagement!!

Let's see how much longer they can keep me on hold. I work hard for my money and do not like wasting it for something I haven't gotten! Over 28 minutes.",cVwK9VcvHH4vb46VV8o6uQ,0,0,1,i3tpq7FYuCH1d1OF2bV42A
2288418,2016-08-26,2,OmgxgqtB7L4UEUXNi5X3Qw,"Do not buy the Groupon for this place. They do not accept it anymore. And also don't give them a hit because the Groupon doesn't work. I solely blame
Groupon. This is the second Groupon that I bought that did not work. The other establishment was closed!

Anyway- they offered 15% off of the order which I thought was fine with me. I got 10 hot wings and 10 lemon pepper. Not bad. Not bad at all. The only thing I would say is that the fries were a little over cooked. (NOT enough for me not to eat them though !  lol!) give this place a try.",XWyrqgF-BlVjg8289RCXoA,1,1,4,hVfy1jcTq_cNDdUZEw9rPA
2565952,2016-05-22,0,OmgxgqtB7L4UEUXNi5X3Qw,"This place is soooooo good! We have been wanting to try their chicken since they opened and our only regret is we didn't stop sooner!! 

Besides their super convenient location, which is literally right off the 95 & Decatur exit, King of Wings has some great food. I had the fingers (not a fan of bones) and they were HUGE white meat tenders served with my choice of sauce. I've been on an Asian kick lately, so I tried the AMAZING Asian orange and the Hot sauces. As I just stated, the orange was so good. I've never been to a wing place with an orange sauce, and this one had just the right amount of sweet/sour/spice combo.  I got the Hot as a back-up, just in case the orange didn't work, and it was also so good I wasn't sure which one was better!!  

Everyone was really happy with their choices. Bae got bone-in with lemon pepper (said they were away better and less greasy than others he has had) and after staring at my cuz's WOW sauce fingers, I had to try them.... WOW is right! Finish off with some fries and hush puppies and you got a meal! They even take the time to poke holes in the boxes to keep your food from getting soggy!!

All in all, we were VERY happy with our visit to King of Wings. It's a great option for dinner after a long work day, and the convenient location makes it a quick stop on the commute home.",09TLMTWynFwmHwcUl53ytg,1,0,5,7WhAwaUG_OEoWNyu9F5lBw
2657924,2016-05-24,1,OmgxgqtB7L4UEUXNi5X3Qw,"While visiting Las Vegas, my family and I wanted some wings, so we tried this place.  Great and friendly service, the food was cooked to order so everything was hot and fresh.  We had the chicken strips and each family member got different sauces (lemon pepper, mild, and wow) all three were great.  If your ever in Vegas or live there check out King of Wings.",nvMB5l_KreiR2-xxYKhDeA,0,0,5,5N5Jj4xchhzLzVku_oLBxQ
3826086,2016-06-15,1,OmgxgqtB7L4UEUXNi5X3Qw,"I've been waiting for this place to open for awhile and I remember the sign would always say it'll open at a later date. I finally was able to try some of these wings today, after it's been open for a few months. 

I was greeted upon entering and was told that I missed the time frame for 50 cent wings by about 17 mins. I believe he said its 4-6pm Mon-Friday. Anyway, I ordered 20 wings, WOW and garlic parmesan 10 each and an order of fries.

From ordering till the time I got my food was about 10-15 mins. It came with a side of veggies, carrots and celery. I didn't notice till after I left that there was no ranch. I don't know if you have to ask for it or the server just forgot. I was a bit sad about that. 

The garlic parmesan I thought were a bit too salty, ranch probably would've helped with that. The wings with the WOW sauce weren't too bad, reminds me of BBQ with a bit of zesty garlic. But the size of these wings I'm a bit disappointed with. My boyfriend and I are regulars at Wingstop and their size wings are perfect! So I guess I noticed the size of these immediately. 

Overall, wings aren't too bad. I'd probably go back to try their other flavors. Their milkshakes and strawberry shortcake looks pretty good as well.",IVhd52S1wRToLVNPFQaipA,3,2,3,h2zWell52R28qMvNMmTrLA
4190296,2016-06-05,0,OmgxgqtB7L4UEUXNi5X3Qw,"First timer at this place. Looks like it will be good, looking forward to it. 
This place has been different things but I remember it as dairy Queen.
I'm excited for this place I hope they have good wings. I enjoy good wings w/good flavor. 
So their WOW sauce is a homemade sauce I cannot wait to try it.
So just a heads up, this place is not going to have your wings ready when you order walking in, so either call your order ahead of time or plan on waiting a while.

Ok the wings w/the WOW sauce was so good and the chili cheese fries were so good.
We will be back to give another flavor a try. Give this a try. You will not regret it.
The staff is so nice.",q_GNUKJXBlMnuezCaxTNOw,2,1,4,AZH2wIkzb64iE3jqmiE_Vw

We ordered 20 hot wings and they were scrumptious. They included plenty of ranch and threw in extra wings. We were tickled and full in the end.,Cf6YtmMUBr2OZaoiEEeUrg,0,0,5,nl_BQlJLjksD3DtchVWbKQ

I'm usually unsure of places that I'm not familiar with or heard anything about... I'm so glad that we stopped by... As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very nice young lady... She helped me order my food and it was really fast, about 12 mins she was finished with the order... We got the food went home and ate it real fast lol... We ordered 20 wings n two hot dogs for the kids because we thought they didn't like wings but we were wrong... The kids ended up eating the wings with us and before I could get a picture we ate everything
... They put the hotdog in a nice container with a ketchup, Mayo, relish and mustard.... The wings were perfectly sized and were so so fresh!!! TWO thumbs up and a great spot!!",d6A8O1HbjJ0QfOequw1VTA,2,1,5,d9_abO2SUB0m-zVvQnGQ1Q
