Pros - Wonderful ice cream, shakes, cakes, cookies and smoothies! Friendly and helpful staff members at this location as well. Lots of parking and it's right off Eastern near the airport.

Cons - This ice cream shop is located in a half empty strip mall off of Eastern Avenue - and there's some sketchy folks in these parts. Another downer is that there's only a few small tables inside to eat at.

Can't really go wrong with flavor wise with an ice cream shop that has lasted so many years & still capable of keeping their flavors tasting the same... at least from however young ago I remeber. 

Just made a quick stop to grab a cake for a co-worker that was leaving us & it was convenient to be able to just open up the freezer & pick out a ready togo ice cream cake. 

Got an OREO COOKIE ice cream & chocolate cake log shaped cake with chocolate glazed over with cherries on top. It was $22.99 which wasn't too bad in my opinion for the size. 

The worker was super sweet & asked if I wanted something written on it but I just didn't have time. 

Only bad thing was that it was VERY stuffy hot feeling in there... you would think to keep the inside cool on a hot day but who knows maybe the ac broke.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,1,1,4,wPB9cJXnmH_Zcu15BfkzKQ

They have a vast selection of flavors to choose from, including some non-dairy options. They circulate out the flavors a lot, most of the time you could come back the next day and there will be a whole array of other flavors to be offered. Along with their handmade sundaes and shakes, there's also pints of your favorite ice cream you can take to go, or get yourself an ice cream cake. 

For two birthdays in a row for my boyfriend, this place has saved my ass when other ice cream shops have failed me with cakes. This location in particular helped me out this past July in quickly personalizing a cake for me (cute ninja turtle drawings and all) and really putting effort in helping me out while other places just shrug their shoulders at an order they had 2 weeks to not screw up on(but did).
