My family made it an affair to take advantage of the bargains we can get at all the outlets in this place. It is indoor so there's no need to worry about the freezing weather outside. Along with the crowd of people, you can pretty much walk around and visit each outlet with your two piece suit, speedo or nothing at all. LOL! Some of the outlets we visited were:

Ann Taylor
Dickies
Levi's
adidas
Nautica
Banana Republic
Perry Ellis
Izod
Quicksilver
Clark's Bostonian
Dr. Scholl's
Ecko (my personal favorite!)

There's plenty more outlets available but some of the outlets were kinda if-fy. In the end, each of us were joyfully carrying a bag or tow or three or four... you get the idea!, of all the things we things we got at a bargain price!!!",uAFG11WgN0Q1KGtldW68IA,2,1,4,fGhM70mF_hP3pun-yXm8DQ

This mall is pretty big with a lot of cool stores that I normally like to shop at. Unfortunately, not a lot of the stores have good sales going on. I find that Premium Outlets by downtown has a lot better deals. 

They seriously need to update their directory too! I swear, my mom and I walked up and down the mall at least twice looking for a chef''s outlet, and we just figured they have closed down since a lot of the units looked closed. Parking is horrendous. And the mall is usually packed even at 10am. You are constantly weaving and dodging your way through people and kiosk sales people.

Ugh, and there are kiosks everywhere. And they all want to bug you and sample their product of you. I've learned to not make eye contact and to ignore them when they talk to you.

Lil Man asked about the Chinook...And the guy gave his pitch about how it costs $139.99 plus tax, but was willing to give it to us at $80.

Parking is stupid, especially when trying to get to the food places near Las Vegas Blvd. I've worked in a couple of these stores before and they treat their employees terrible, which explains the bad customer service most of the stores offer. It's a pretty touristy place considering the amount of people you'll see hauling their suitcases around. Tiny walkways crowded with those annoying vendors trying to sell you some hot new toy your kid doesn't need or some magical anti wrinkle cream made from the mud of the Irish springs-- because every teenagers needs that, right? Overall not really my scene for shopping. 

I do, however, really enjoy their food kiosks. I'll never pass up a chance for Starbucks, Annie's pretzels, or Dunkin Doughnuts! For some reason, the food vendors seem like the only ones to hire a friendly staff.",I70jgmMpKH7qgqr9va28Og,0,0,2,OdWFzHDnqyoLRVoloLWGpw

-They do have higher end shops like Coach, Michael Kors, Bose, Ann Taylor, Swarovski, etc. But not as many as the North premium outlets.

1232519,2011-09-18,2,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"Once upon a time, this was the Belz Outlet Mall. Then it became the Outlet Center. Belz was cool, the Outlet Center was lame. 

Now, it's become the Premium Outlets of Las Vegas-South. Let me tell you, it is quite the impovement.

The outside looks almost the same as the original Premium Outlets. Now the way it looks inside is still rather....stale. They need to work on that. That said, they do have a much better selection of stores now, with the already existing stores being vastly improved. The Niketown here is far better than the one at the North outlets in my opinion. This is also the area with the highest concentration of Dunkin' Donuts locations in Vegas, with two inside the mall and one in the parking lot. :D (There really aren't enough locations of those here). I'm really upset they closed the music store (Music 4 Less) though, one of the best music stores ever. Then again, they brought down the carousel that used to be at the Meadows Mall, so I suppose that's an improvement. 

The biggest problem with this mall is still there however: The layout. It's essentially a 0.5 mile long strip of a building. The thing that sucks most about this is parking at one end, having to go to a specific store, looking at the map and then realizing it's all the way at the OTHER end. At least it's an air-conditioned building you have to walk through but still. Thankfully, an expansion is being planned, hopefully they'll change up the layout in the process of the expansion so walking from one end to the other won't take 30 minutes. 

So after years of being lame in every possible way it's finally worthwhile to shop in this mall again. I can't wait to see what other changes are in store for it.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,1,1,4,dpghgfICvVwZH60xLEozxg

What I like about this outlet is that it is indoors (with an exception of a few shops outside in the ""promenade"" area) so no matter what the weather is outside, you can come here to shop and save a lot of coins/ cash on whatever you buy. 

This outlet is pretty similar to the Las Vegas Premium Outlet North, but the South outlet has 10 stores less and the South is all outdoors.

--going to the dentist
--getting kicked in the stomach
--read ""FIfty Shades of Gray"" (and that's really bad)

Things that would lead me to flee to a strip mall:

--The Strip

Sorry, not a fan of windowless casinos with no signs that hint at time of day/decade or directions (when you're trying to cut through and get hopelessly lost). A Las Vegas conference took me to The Strip, and by day two I felt so smothered by the imitation cultures, I took a 15-minute bus ride to the outlets. Yes, an outlet felt more real to me than The Strip, which has all kinds of meta-irony.

I was also driven by a long denied necessity of buying a new pair of pants, because I had apparently packed on a paunch. Most of the stores were a bust for me, but the standouts were Kitchen Collections (be warned, prices are department store rate not outlet, but a good one-stop shop for gifts), Rack Room Shoes (flats that aren't orthopedic looking, buy one get the second half off), Banana Republic (found my black light-weight pants for $11, what?, as well as work and even night-appropriate pants for $35), and Guess (another lightweight pair of black pants, these linen for $25). The mall appears to be adding more stores

Minimal exciting options at the food court, but a thumbs up for the Dunkin Donuts booth: I ordered an iced coffee and just one munchkin (or whatever they call their donut hole), and the guy said, ""oh just give it to her, it's not worth charging.""

As far as the curse. Ppl everywhere. We pulled in with about 4 tour buses following us in. It took us about 30 mins to find a parking spot after circling a few times. The Nike store was a madhouse.

Many of you have been to a mall at some point in your life. What I hated most about going to the mall was the fact that everything is overpriced. LVPO-S is basically the same setup as a classic mall, but everything is discounted.  Another great thing about this place is that it has all the good brand name stuff that we go to at a mall for (clothing, jewelry, shoes, and food), and it does not have the ""filler stores"" (you know what i'm talking about, Shoe Palace, Cellairis, Fanzz etc.)

This time I went to the Skechers store to find some work shoes. Being an outlet store, these stores are somewhat bigger and carry a larger selection than their regular retail outlets. They had the size and model that I wanted that the retail store didn't carry, and they were about 33% cheaper, possibly more. I was satisfied.

A lot of people complain about going to outlet stores because it's not as ""new"" as the ones in their retail stores. Hey, it's your money and you can buy whatever you see fit for yourself. But for me, I'm not going to be hanging out with Paris Hilton on the weekends or rubbing elbows with the Bieber Fever. Besides, anything you buy new at a regular mall will be ""out of style"" within a few months.

On the drive down Vegas blvd, I know we didn't pass through any wormhole or temporal anomaly... but pulling up to the outlet, I could swear the year was some time in the 1980s and some where in the Midwest. I checked the GPS on my phone and I still had signal so we were definitely in at least the 2000s and my GPS told me we were still in Vegas. 

We all get out of the car and the outside pretty much matches the inside. Everything is very old and dated and in some cases pretty sad looking. I am sure it could draw more people with a cheap face lift. The food area is pretty much the same as well. They had a fast food joint called ""Chicken Now"" which was f'in awesome and made me laugh for like 15 minutes. The place looked like it could be straight out of the movie Napoleon Dynamite like in a stand right next to the chicken farm where Napoleon gets a job. Simply awesome.

-Indoor mall with A/C... good for those over 100° days.
-AAA discount for members if you show your card at the concierge.
-FUN carousel for kids to enjoy.
-A decent place to shop for costume ideas or themed-party wear.

CONS:
-While a few outlets offer a good find or two... majority of them still suck.
-Random booths selling useless stuff AND rather quite annoying.
-The food court is abysmal. 

CONVENIENCE: *** [Located at the south end of the strip, easy find, ample parking.]
AMBIANCE: *** [Strangely designed layout, somewhat difficult to hit specific stores.]
SERVICE: *** [Is it me or do the employees seem like they don't enjoy working there.]
PRICE:  $$  [I've found some items under $5-10, tho most items not worth buying.]
OVERALL: *** [3-stars... Sure, I enjoyed the nice makeover of the mall, but honestly coming here is a waste of time.  Better just head to the outdoor LVPO-North.]

So fast forward to present time. Coincidentally, I work here now and yet I still live half a world away. The mall has changed its name and its look. More shops have opened. As far as outlets go, you'll probably find a store you are looking for. If not, you can drive a couple of blocks down the street to Town Square.

The food options here kind of suck, but if you don't see anything you like, there is a plethora of restaurants to choose from in the same shopping complex. 

Because this is an outlet that is located close to the strip, a lot of people who come here are tourists. Some of the stores are understaffed and the customer service is nothing to rave about unless you go into a store like Coach or Michael Kors.

The parking lot is big, but can sometimes be a nightmare, especially during the holidays. This mall is an indoor mall, which can be a bit of a relief in the summer time. However, some stores are only accessible through the outside and do not connect with the inside of the mall. 

If it's not too hot out, I prefer the North Outlet.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,3,1,3,ed6Q9Gxho1vg9sn9Ck43fQ

There are less people at this one compared to the other one. Even though It is smaller, It is still a great place to shop at and people are very friendly.

With stores such as Michael Kors, True Religion, Coach and Bose, it's easy to find some cute finds that will fill the trunk. It's conveniently located on Las Vegas Blvd and the 215.  There are tons of tourists that shop here.  I am guilty of taking a cab here before I lived here while staying on the strip.  

The majority of the stores are inside with about a dozen with outside entrances.  There are also several restaurants that line the front of the outlet in front of the parking lot.  

Like I said before, there are tons of tourists as well as locals that shop here.  It's always pretty busy. For this local I'll shop here on occasion to put that smile on my face.

The facade of this outlet has undergone major renovation and looks great! Shopping outdoors along the Promenade area has been added. Under Armour, Fossil and Coach stores were relocated to larger retail space out here. There are benches and shaded areas where you can just sit out and chill. 

Im not fond of the long and narrow layout of this outlet's indoor area. It can get really packed in and harder to maneuver your way around. That and the long corridor is a pain. If you want to backtrack to another store that's at the other end, better learn how to dodge the kiosks selling snake oil. Some of those salespeople can be really annoying. 

For locals it's A-OK. Back in the day when shopping for back to school clothes for the kids it was cool. They have some good discounts to get you in the door.   Although now  I find most of the retail ""outlets"" selling in season merchandise at retail price so it's pretty much a waste of time if you are coming here to score a bargain. But if you're looking to refresh that favorite shirt that you got your husband one season ago or silverware or plates that have been discontinued,  you are bound to find it here. Then maybe it's worth your time. Other than that there's nothing really special or spectacular that would draw me to go shopping here any longer.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,3,1,3,vckNDR8-Zc32aEBBphdF7w

Rain in Vegas makes a ridiculous amount of people flock to South (instead of the more popular North).

I've been to both.  If you're from or familiar with Southern California, to compare I'd say the NORTH is similar to Camarillo or Palm Desert.

The SOUTH is similar to Ontario Mills or The Citadel.

The NORTH is an outdoor shopping area, it has more stores as well as higher end (brand names) stores.  The SOUTH for the most part is an indoor mall, and has a mixture, 'tho if I had to summarize, has more working class type retail stores.

Parking is difficult at the NORTH, they have a parking structure that's covered.   Parking seemed easy over at the SOUTH.

The shopping clientele seems be comprised of more visiting tourists (and foreign ethnic)  at the NORTH and more locals (and urban ethnic) at the SOUTH. 

I like the SOUTH Premium Outlets because it's indoors.  They do have a Hugo Boss, Banana Republic and other stores here, similarly to that of the NORTH outlets too.

The selection isn't as diverse, nor as prestigious as the North Outlets, but I'd say if you have the time to go to both, it's worthwhile.  However, if you only had time to go to one, I'd say the North is a tad better for my purposes.",Vkj42md-5O3VoOD9pBg6Sw,3,1,3,clrEBsRbHBcMUg6JV2a6sw

I did not want to experience black friday so i swing by later today (i am pretty sure they will extend till tomorrow Monday their "" super deal ""
Coach offered 70% off on everything and additional 20% on selective items

-Easier to park (but you might get stuck in some traffic due to lack of stop lights)
-Indoors so you can find some sanctuary for those hot Vegas summers (but it feels kind of claustrophobic inside)
-A lot of store selections (but I feel like the selection is much bigger at the North outlets)
-More food options compared to North outlets, including surrounding food options
-lacks that ""touristy"" vibe, so less tourists looking lost or toting their luggage

Despite the hassles of the North outlets, I still feel like I'd rather shop there. Although it was nice being indoors, it was easier to get to the main stores we wanted to go to by walking outside the building, but our trip was ultimately a bust.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,2,1,2,2ZFN3rfCFI4LosKeboXVKQ
2887710,2015-07-27,4,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"An older outlet store with an almost Boulevard Mall appeal.  Some higher end shops can be found.  This is a good athletic wear store mall.  Not too out of style but if you want Movado you would have to go to the newer premium outlet store.  This is more accustomed to receive the locals than that other Premium Outlet location though.  Easy parking, easy walk through.  I do not live for consumerist values but none are immune in this country.  With that said this is a favorite mall for my mandatory gift hunting needs.  

The biggest appeal to this outlet used to be the now defunct merry-go-round that my kids used to love.  It sadly has moved on to greener pastures.  You should have seen the tears on my sons face when we learned it has been removed :'( so saddening.  Alas' we had to make a special trip the Circus Circus Adventuredome after that trip..  If I recall correctly there are 2 food court areas with the usual mall fare.  Nothing out of the culinary norm for a mall.  Most stores are discounted at unusually higher percentage.  There are some hold out stores that I would not waste the extra drive to go for.  Mainly the Crocs store (side note: for my kids) and the little bodega type stands are gimmicky rip offs.

Do your research and check if the stores you are looking for are here before coming down.  Not a bad place to shop.  Tourist levels are moderate compared to the newer Premium.  Parking is right in front of the stores and it is easily laid out in a single horizontal grid.  If you're hungry there is a Raising Canes and a Buffalo Wild WIngs in the same parking lot.

We treat this place more like a mall than an outlet center.  It always fun to go walk around and check out the different stores.  The have a big carsoul in it too.  So we always take my daughter for a ride.  This is also a place to walk a few laps if you eat at a restaurant next to it.

Here's my advice to anyone who goes to the any of the premium outlets, before going to visiting any of these Malls...go to their website, and sign up for one of their coupon books.   The mall management will take a few days to reply back by E-mail, but it will give you a free coupon book for most of the outlet stores, and it doesn't cost anything if you do that, or you can buy one at customer service for 5 or 10 dollars.   
One major suggestion, don't use a Las Vegas address, because they use to give the Las Vegas locals a hard time with this.   On the other hand,  I did it a few months ago, and got the E-mail print out from the mall management, I had no problem getting the coupon booklet without showing any ID to guest services.

2910363,2015-05-17,1,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"Local here talking about the one of the Disney Store Outlets in town. As a native Los Angelino and long time Mouse fan, I come with a bit more insight than most on the subject of Disney merchandise at the retail level. This is a good store for locals and visitors alike to get their hands on merchandise not found in any of the Downtown Disney superstores found in Anaheim, CA or Orlando, FL. However, with that in mind, you're not getting anything from Downtown Disney here either. Clever marketing? For a super Disney geek like me, YES!

It's located at the far southern end of the mall so park accordingly or be prepared to walk mall lengths accordingly. Getting a good parking spot is usually a breeze because locals generally don't go to this mall and most visitors are at the other Premium Outlets on Grand Central Parkway and rightfully so since those a touch more inviting.

Staff here are also called Cast Members. So the courtesy and level of service you'd expect at any Disney property can be expected here. They are knowledgeable, helpful and super friendly to a fault. 

The collection of merchandise especially for children was astounding considering the generally small display space that they have to work with. By comparison to the Anaheim's Downtown Disney's layout, the outlet store is less than one general section of the Downtown Disney layout and probably no more than half of that. Yet the selection was amazing by comparison because most of what I saw on display was not available in Downtown Disney. Star Wars products for kids took up only 15 feet of wall space but it was on display from the floor to the ceiling so you got to see a lot more than a couple of racks of clothes or a few shelves of toys. Pajamas, Stormtrooper outfits, light sabers, action figures, lunch pails, backpacks and you're not just getting stuff from the movies: There are products related to the Clone Wars and Rebels animated series here, too! If you want outfit your little Jedi master or Sith lord for Halloween, he or she will show up in style for both trick or treating or parties. The Marvel products filled well over 25 feet of wall space in the same manner and were prominently paraded about the store. The iconic princess products were on full display on the other main wall of this store and equally as impressive. The general floor space paraded a myriad of interesting and very cool products from all the other Disney properties including classics like Mickey, Minnie, and Donald all the way to the presently new properties like Frozen, Maleficent and Big Hero 6. The selection of clothing for adults was modest and may be judged as small by some but it's eclectic and also rare nonetheless. I found a Star War T-shirt my size that I have not seen in any store, Disney or otherwise. The biggest and deepest Disney enthusiast would be very pleased to find new and exciting treasures here. Friends, nerd and geek yourself out!

What's my bottom line? This store is about anything you can't find at a Downtown Disney for the Disney enthusiast. Some may say some items are pricey. I say the rarity in ideas, style and taste justify that and all items are priced properly. The only drawback really is no IMAX but that does not stop me from coming here. The only drawback IMO is floor space. I want more! LOL My actual rating is a solid 5.0 stars...",azBg2Tl2ncITAXKdX07tGQ,2,1,5,5aH3-DdTk2FEQNkItFXoLw

-Kate spade: so much stuff here. They were having a cool 60% off plus 20% off on most of the store. I bought a bag for $55 which is super unheard of in Kate spade.

-Columbia: a lot of good stuff here. Especially with sales it's much more affordable and the quality is pretty good. You don't have to sacrifice style here. I got a sweet winter coat for $140 and it normally goes for $299.

Wow this place has not changed since I was kid. I used to scarf down Sbarro pizza slices, shop regularly at Hot Topic and laugh at the people who were buying ""Big Dog"" t-Shirts. Nowadays, I still do all of the above; at the moment I'm wearing a tie-dye Family Guy shirt while sipping some Joe out of my Lamb of God coffee mug. 

A quarter mile of pure international craziness, it's like landing at JFK Airport. This has to be the must stop place in Vegas for people visiting from all over the world with Saturdays and Sundays being the busiest. I was here recently to get some new gym shoes and the Nike store was nuts to butts packed full of multi-lingual people all clamoring for those discounted SBs and Air Max joints. 

Not everything in here is a fake or a bootleg product. There are plenty of legit stores who just need to sell that extra inventory like the aforementioned Nike plus Puma, PacSun, Adidas, Coach, Disney Stores, Under Amour, Converse and my personal favorite, The Kitchen Collection. Which is the only store in this place that sells dope ass kitchenware at outlet prices. Why do I know this, because I love to cook!

** Sip Sip ** Mmmm, this Lamb of God mug makes the coffee taste so delicious. 

I am not knocking this place one bit, great prices on name brand stuff. Shopping here just requires a lot of patience, patience I don't normally have. You really need to psyche yourself up when coming here, trust me, this isn't your daddy's stroll through the mall, this is pure Outlet Mall warfare and with holidays coming up, I advise you to pack a flask just to take the edge off.

DC shoe store, knick knack 99 cent charms, Journeys,  Kitchen Collections are some of the stores I like to check out. 

 I have to say Hot Topic has changed a lot... You can still order Tripp Pants in store but they don't carry them in store any longer.

 I LOVE Auntie Anne's Pretzels.  They have a rewards program & mobile app you get a free pretzel for your birthday & again for the free sign up.  Big food court, Dunkin Donuts & a really nice stand alone places. 

Silk Dermalactive is ultra high end but worth every penny! Excellent skin treatment.  Their profession is removing wrinkles. It will take 20 years off your face.  If you have time you should stop & try the lotion samples. I even liked their Deep Collagen Care mask, removed my black heads after 20 minutes of sitting on my face & wiped it off. It was like magic, my skin is softer too. Also I HIGHLY recommend the Facial Peel, it cleans up Psoriasis, Rosacea, even my SEVERE Eczema on my wrist!! I couldn't believe my eyes when the dead skin came off. No gimmicks, I was a skeptical at first but it WORKS & it's worth the money. This same exact stuff is used in the Bellagio Spa, so you know it's a brand they stand by.

Since we rented a car, I realized the Las Vegas South Premium Outlets were close to the airport. We stopped by on Wednesday, May 10th around 5:15pm.

My only mission was to find a bikini, so I only walked into stores which a selection of suits you could see from walking around the mall. I'm tall and on the smaller side, so I was specifically looking for a bikini with ties both on the top and the bottom. I started out at Quicksilver. I didn't like their selection as everything had some kind of pattern I wasn't drawn to. (I like suits on the plain side.) Next up was O'Neill. I found solid colored suits here, but most of the tops only tied around the neck. Not in the back as well. Not wanting to settle, we roamed around some more and found a PacSun. I ended up grabbing a white bikini here for around $50. Tied in the neck and back on the top and on the sides on the bottom. Perfect for me as I didn't need to worry about it fitting perfectly. I could just adjust the ties everywhere.

I've been to the North Outlets before and feel like they have more of a selection. But I'm glad I found what I needed here. And it was super convenient as it was on our way from our car rental to our hotel. In a pinch, this outlet will do.

I loved the Rockport store nice shoes for 27.00 (regular 90.00) A very friendly store that has amazing prices in the mall is Fossil !! Bought not one but two bags !! I still use them :)  And a very cool necklace.  I had to make a trip to the car to unload the parcels !! I also found a nice jacket for my Dear Dad and some ""kitschy"" Vegas souvenirs from the kiosk in the mall.  Its a great mall - not too fancy but has GREAT deals - I mean who really CARES how ""up-to-date"" a mall ""looks""?  I'd rather have lower prices - and REALLY great customer service in all the stores! Besides after you go to your car and ""unload"" your purchases (in the trunk!!) You can scoot over to Chilis for lunch then go to Saks Fifth Avenue clearance store which is in the same parking lot adjacent to the mall in a little strip itself - still affilliated with the mall itself.  Its a great place and will continue to shop there!!  Its my first STOP !!!",2tmlYRAoHTRqK_vRQIkmBg,2,1,4,iYsLIfbjg3KyXFfOUyP5Yw

There is no doubt, this place needs a facelift real bad. Management remodeled the exterior a few years ago and it was a massive improvement. Unfortunately the interior does not mirror the exterior at all. The inside is boring and definitely needs a makeover. Lack of atmosphere at an outlet mall may sound like an odd complaint, but cramped walkways and uninspired signage make for a boring shopping experience. 

There are a good number of decent outlets: Nike, Polo, Levis and the like, but there are also plenty of no-name shops full of random junk. Parking is usually a breeze but it does get packed around the holidays. Dining options are limiting to common food court fare, no restaurants at all; you are probably better off going to the eateries right outside of the mall.

Honestly, I had all but stopped coming to this outlet unless I wanted to go to Saks off 5th but now I think Premium has given me reason to return here more often. 

I find that this location is easier to navigate than the mixed up jumble of building at the North location. Plus parking at this location tends to be easier... At least in my eyes! It think the caliber of stores have been stepped up to the level of the North but unfortunately it does not eliminate the need to got the North location!

Overall, I think I will be back and I would suggest this place to those who want the outlet experience.

FYI- Outlet shopping is a fine art. The more retail looking an outlet becomes the less outlet it becomes. Additionally, when shopping we'll know brands if you haven't seen the item in stores or catalogs it is a ""made for outlet item!"" Lastly, always do a quality check on items before purchase, because if it's way cheaper that retail there may be a good reason for it! Happy shopping my Loves!

We travel to Vegas once a year in December to go to the NFR and do some Christmas shopping. This place is on our list to visit when we do.

The majority of the stores are indoor with a few outdoor stores in the parking lot.  If you plan to shop/browse the entire mall, plan on an all day shopping excursion.  It will take a while to casually go through it all.

If you get hungry, there's a food court in the center of the mall with fast food options or you can dine in some sit-down restaurants in the parking lot.

I've found some great deals at the stores here and if you catch them at the right time you'll the sales/discounts can be huge.  Be prepared for large crowds on the weekends and if you're driving here I recommend parking on the South side of the mall where I've found it to be less busy and easier to park.

Stores like Hot Topic, Aeropostale, Charlotte Russe and Guess are not going to land you any better deals then their locations at Galleria or Fashion Show Mall. However, the Calvin Klein, Vans and Adidas stores have been worth the trip for me in terms of finding killer deals. 

There are many overly pushy people working at kiosks that can be annoying. I have never seen anything at any of the kiosks I've even consider buying. 

The mall has been remodeled recently and it is indoors, which is a big plus when it comes to the hot summer months. The options for eating are very limited, however there are a few eateries outside the mall. 

As other reviewers have mentioned, this mall is pretty poorly laid out. It's basically a long strip mall.  There are stores that are only accessible from outside, and stores that are only accessible from the inside... I find that highly annoying.

Especially the latter considering the weight limit most airlines have set. Too bad. Because compared to the Netherlands most (brand) clothes are very cheap. Something to do with your outlets and the currency convertion. But what I like most is that buying something here makes me have something special. The change that anyone else in the office wears the same dress is small (although it happend to me once).

Big note: probably people don't believe it, but I hate shopping. That's why I love the American outlets. One day, twice a year, sneakers and a little endurance and I'm ready for the next season. Everything conveniently located together. And after all those years I exactly know which brands to visit and what sizes to buy. Even without fitting.

In the past years this location looks upgraded. More and more nice stores (Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren) have arrived and they expanded with stores on the outside. Most stores are on the inside (airconditioned!). Not a very attractive environment, but it does the job. And if you're prepared to have a little stroll you can park your car behind the building where there's shade throughout the day. Compared to the north you'll probably find 70-80% the same stores on this location. The other 20-30% are less high end than in the north. Prices between locations may vary to both sides.

Two things I don't like. One is all the people in the middle trying to get your attention to sell you 'as steen on television' stuff. Get a life, stop harassing me. The other is the food court. Nothing fresh. But then again, it's an outlet, not a fine dining location. Although just a soda vending machine would be such an improvement. Shopping makes thirsty.

And excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. English is not my first language. And if that isn't bad enough, my Apple device keeps changing words into 'proper Dutch'. Yes, you've guessed right, my first language.",UeZpPpsBLI0dort7UcwFVg,4,2,3,NKY3955p8zaiVDl3fjo8ZA

We go to Premium/North (open-air) quite a bit and on a regular basis, and find lots more deals there, especially at our favorite stores (Fossil/Quiksilver/Banana Republic/Disney/Harry & David just to mention a few stores). So of course, this mall edges out Premium/South. 

Overall, this is a clean mall, with regular maintenance being done (i see cleaning people all the time). I didn't notice any security guards the last few times we came here. There is ample parking space available. The best spots to park are in front of Burlington Brands and the VF outlet store (opposite ends). Also, there is more shopping and restaurants (Chipotle, Samurai Sam's, Tropical Smoothie Cafe, Chili's, and so many others) at two other sections (not attached to the mall). Our most recent visit was two days ago (and we went here the previous week, to check out the shoes at Nike).

Also, shops look more affordable than your Gucci and other high end stores.  The place looked pretty decent.  I found the Ralph Lauren Polo store and Brooks Brothers to have really nice deals for Memorial Day.  My mom found a belt at the Banana Republic.  We tried looking for an Eddie Bauer but no luck here.  Interesting stores here with Volcon and other brands which I haven't seen.  It takes a while to walk from one end to another.  Other stores on outside hard to access in this indoor mall.  But, at least it's all indoors and you don't have to battle weather, etc.  

There is an Annex to this outlet which has Disney stuff for real cheap, Saks Off the 5th, and some other local stores.  Other stores are wicked expensive for usual touristy stuff like ponchos and leather goods.  There is a random apparel store with heavily discounted Disney and hats with no logos and T-shirts with some random stuff on it.  I think the store owner got these shirts and stuff for dirt cheap and now off-loading for less than $10.",ySqKXdWrWSsMk9hHAORlSA,0,0,4,RJqLf3PAp4rQTPtIKQ6XIA

It is indoor and has a lot of stores to look at. They even have an Aeropostale and Dickies outlet. They may have a lot of stores, but only a few that I actually browse in. I do like the other outlet mall near downtown more since they have more stores and more stores that i personally shop in. 

This place does have a food court. 

All in all, if you are definitely looking for discounts and/or something in particular, check this place out. If you are on a trip and only have time to hit one outlet mall, I don't suggest it be this one.

They have better stores now (as far as what my family and I are interested in) they've added: Polo Ralph Lauren, Lucky Brand, Coach, Original Adidas Store, Nine West INSIDE the mall itself so that I don't have to toture myself having to walk all the way over to the other one in the freaking heat.

Lately the selection has been a lot better at this outlet than the one on Charleston. But the best part about this outlet is that it's INDOORS! I mean, I love to shop, but that 110 degree weather in the summer is enough to slow my butt down and stop spending money... Maybe that's a good thing?

Another comparison that I noticed with this outlet to the one on Charleston is that there are. Plenty of places to eat. Granted, they may not be well known vendors nor may they be that good but at least when you need to refuel, you have different parts of the mall that you're able to sit down and get your grub on. There happens to be a few well known fast food and sit down restaurants outside of the mall: Raising Canes, Chili's, etc.

I also LOVE town square and Downtown Summerlin, but you can not go wrong with the bargains you're able to find at the Premium Outlet south. I feel like this location is less appreciated than the north one, and if anything it should be vice versa! 
Here's why: 

First, you can come in at any weather type. This is serious - if you live in town or visit here often, you'd know that it becomes borderline IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the house in summer, unless you go underwater! Same for the tough months of December and January, especially when it's super windy. 
Second, they have hidden gems that are exclusive in town, like the Karl Lagerfeld store, a Gymboree outlet store for kids and the coolest toy store I've seen (FunZone Vegas, I've uploaded some photos). 
Third, it's almost never too crowded! Other than Black Friday or thanksgiving weekend, I feel like this one stop shop is great whenever it's too hot or too cold to stay out. Plus I always find the cutest shoes, clothes and gifts here.",QPgAgjzE_uEHBEgm4Q0WEg,2,0,5,j2-f2CZphhK4KJEvwZVtkg

Parking is super easy with drive up parking surrounding the entire mall. The mall is basically one long corridor, with a few small wings. If you check into the center with Yelp, you also get a small coupon book (leaflet) with various discounts throughout the mall.

Quite frankly, the south outlet I also prefer for the sake of the fact it's an actual interior mall, so there's A/C during the summer heat which Las Vegas experiences like 10 months a year.

Outside all that, however, north outlet has more store variety. I believe south has 140 stores, while north has 150...but it feels like north has a lot more to offer. Nonetheless, some major stores north doesn't have include New Balance, Aerosoles, Naturalizer...oh and south has a significantly better food court than north.

I also don't like the design too much...since it's essentially a giant line from one end to another instead of a circle design that most malls have...it actually takes a long time to walk from one end to another and then walk back.

While I suppose many drive to this outlet mall, it is also easily accessible by transit from The Strip, with a stop in front of the mall parking lot.",1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,7,0,3,tIJsEnBQQ33agIWsHSTMkw

I had gotten two shirts. $168. The break down being $35 and $20 for the actual shirts. $25 each for the custom designs. THEN, what's not listed is a $25 fee for putting the design on. The one girl told me my second design would be $3 which is the only reason I got a second one. But they don't tell you anything about a $25 fee to put the design on.
So now it's $168 right?? I told the owner that they should explain that. That's not right that they don't tell you that. Also, not honoring what I was told, that my 2nd design would be $3. I swear I rarely ever complain but when I got back to my car- I noticed that the shirts felt like absolute shit. Pure paper. On a shirt. And the designs weren't even straight. I figured with smaller businesses they would want to make sure they made things right with me, but they clearly don't. Please don't go here, anyone. I can't even give the shirt as a gift it's such shitty quality.


Update: the mall did try to reminisce the situation. I just still want to warn everyone to NOT GO TO THIS STAND. They will rip you off. The owner is Israel Hayot and he's a complete smartass.

They use wax paper!! Which you can get at walmart for $10 and iron it on yourself. The quality is not worth the money.",9Rs0mw_VeCbDSLmfZF3o6g,3,0,1,po-jEzm5Bt6Wmt3RVR1kYg
4382628,2016-01-17,3,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"This shopping center has a pretty good store lineup and there are usually some good deals to be found.

Having been to outlet malls in other cities I can say this location is better than most outlets. The location is about 10 minutes from the Strip instead of in the middle of nowhere. It's not a long drive for any local since it's conveniently located near the 215/15. 

There are a lot of stores and here and a large variety of store types. I like to come here for work clothing since they have several stores with good prices on dress pants and blouses (Ann Taylor Loft/Van Heusen). The Clark's store is a favorite since that is my primary shoe brand. It's pretty awesome to get a deal on a brand I was already planning to buy. I also love the Harry & David store for gourmet foods.

Look for Starbucks in one of the middle aisles for caffeine. The food options inside are dismal, but there are some okay food options in the parking lot in front of the mall.

This place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose.

The parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos. I do occasionally come here on my lunch break, but I park in a secret lot to avoid the chaos.

The South outlet went through renovations 2-3 years ago and it still looks sad and dated. I never look forward to coming here and only do because of convenience. I don't think there's anything ""Premium"" about this location at all, whereas with the North ones you can literally spend an entire day hopping through each store.

The store selection here isn't as great as the other location but you can occasionally find some good deals on the stores that *are* here. The stores here also have less selection at times even though they have the same exact store at the other outlet (for example, Coach is much bigger at North outlets!). Some positive things about this is that it is close to the south end of the strip if you're staying there and it is also close to quite a few dining options (Black Bear Diner, Cane's, BWW) and also a short driving distance to Town Square which has a theatre, more shopping, and more dining options.

The 405 isn't a freeway: it's ""parking in groups"", right? When we get there after showing off my quick-n-nimble construction-navigation skillz, I asked what more could you possibly find here, there's already too much junk in my trunk? Who else could you possibly buy a ""Vegas = Tranny? I'd hit it!"" shirt for? But they were Determined.  

I hung out on the benches across from the nondescript food court, texting and checking email while feeling bad for the kids trying to make the mechanical ducks and old-skool coin-op rides actually work. An hour passes by, then another. I'm starting to get hungry. Wtf? Where are they? Is it really THAT interesting?

The kiosk people basically stalk you and there's always the off chance you will run into a belligerent crackhead screaming in the hallway. This describes my recent experience....

As we were walking toward the kitchen store, we heard a commotion that ended up being a dude that had legit lost his mind. He was yelling at a guy who he didn't know about being touched inappropriately. Somehow his shirt ended up being taken off and the dude was raging mad and pacing back and forth yelling and screaming. I was nervous except that he had so little clothing on that I could tell he had no gun. His body was covered with pock marks and he took his belt off saying that someone was doing heroin behind the dumpsters and he found that belt back there to prove it. After drawing a crowd and a few people recording the fiasco on their iphones, Metro came and carted him away. I wouldn't doubt it being on youtube.com in the near future.

This outlet center is for the average shopper. this is the place you go when you need to buy tennis shoes, athletic wear or everyday wear. I've purchased shoes @ Nike, at Famous Footwear (the one where you earn points, etc) They have Reebok, Nike and 2 adidas stores. Nike at least has crappy socks for you to try on shoes b/c lets face it, this is the dessert, odds are we are wearing sandals. Adidas and reebok dont have this unless you specificaly ask for a pair of socks. 

They also have the great kitchen stuff store. I LOVE this store.You always find neat things in here that you didn't even know existed.. and you think to yourself wow, that's something that I need...I've always avoided, this or that b/c I didnt like this or that - but now that I have this gadget, wow I'm going to start eating healthier. Tools that have changed my life:

The apple core-er. Wow. Love it. Got mine for $5 @wal-mart but still..
The orange cutter. wow. Its like a ring you roll over the orange and it cuts the peel off into perfect slices. wow. all I can say.

The ultimate discovery- that i've actually been searching for - forever.. Even Williams Sonoma doesnt carry. The TUNA strainer!. OMG. I finally found it and it even had a magnet on the back to take out the metal lid. Dang, that's exactly why I dont eat tuna b/c I dont like to strain the can, it goes everywhere, and I dont want to pay 2-3 the $ of the can to buy the pouch pre-drained. and that one is usually very dry. This is perfect. 
One day I went out here and found it and got in line, guess what? left my card in a book bag from buying books @ CSN earlier that day

So I went back... guess what? Sold out. arrrghh... 


The only thing I hate is the parking. trying to get in and out of here is annoying. But they have tons of restaurants inside the mall - they have 2 food courts, but they also have a strip of restaurants outside too. Everything u want from Chipotle, MCDonald's, Dickey's BBQ, BWW, La cocina, Outback, dunkin donuts, Weinerschnitzel, did i spell that right?

Now the worst part of this place, which is why they lost another star is the kiosk people. If I dont want to buy anything, I dont want to buy anything. If I dont' stop @ your kiosk, that's b/c I don't have any interest in buying anything from you. Please don't try to hand me free things or put a stupid sticker or stamp on my already done nails (that I do myself for free, thanks). 
 I feel sorry for these folks b/c I know they are only doing their job but... dang. its a lose lose. you dont have this problem when you go the outlets up north - by downtown, and there you will find fancier stores. PACKED @ XMAS. wow. LINES OUT THE DOOR!. 

MY FAV stores here however are:
Nike, Adidas, Famouse Footwear bc/ they sell all diff. shoes and you can earn points toward $10-$15. off.

The layout of the mall is very strange as well. It is a ""comb"" shape, basically a straight line with extensions to the exits. It gets annoying having to divert from the central hall just to go down each of the ""teeth"" to see what is there. And why does the place have TWO FOOD COURTS? This is a really strange move, they would have been better off having just one big one, and a nice, two-story layout that took up less space. 

The parking lot here is a zoo as well. Apparently, this is a popular tourist attraction (I can confirm that having worked in one of the stores some years back.) You're not going to have an easy time finding a close space. My advice - if you come, park outside Burlington's on the north end, there seem to be more spaces there than you might think, and apparently not many people think to park there.

They have a couple of food courts which provides a good variety of food options. Don't forget those little shops in the center that sell specialty popcorn or pretzels. It's a great place to cool down, window shop, eating and calorie burn.

The prices are definitely not that discounted though they make it sound like you're getting mad deals. If you go to enough outlets you will know that most of them don't really give that much of a discount. All they do is jack up the price and say buy on get one free.

5108269,2018-04-29,2,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"My tip to surviving hot weather is to go into an air-conditioned environment and hibernate. Each day that I was in Las Vegas in July, the temperature was at least 110°F. 

My friend and I enjoy shopping. This outlet mall was close to our hotel. We decided to drive over there and beat the oppressive heat.

I love this mall. It has my main stores that keep me happy, such as Gap Factory, Skechers, and Fossil. I also discovered new stores that I love, like Kipling.

For years, I have wanted something with a cute dangling gorilla. I couldn't afford anything until I found this Kipling store. I could buy a wallet and a pencil case at great prices. Back then, I wasn't interested in getting a purse from this store. Perhaps the next time that I am back, I will get one. I have had both items since July 2015, and they work and look great to this day.

My friend and I tore up the Gap Factory store. I have not purchased anything from a typical mall Gap store in years. Rather, a lot of my wardrobe comes from the factory store. You get huge discounts and you look great. 

We both bought so much stuff at the Gap store that we had to brave the heat to put all our goodies in my steaming car rental's trunk. It was worth not lugging everything around for hours.

We did a couple of breaks at Starbucks. We made sure that we were hydrated with beverages and I had a sugar cookie the second time.

I love this mall. It is huge, so you can easily spend hours here. The prices are great and it's always satisfying to get what you want at a discount.

If you're more in to the higher type class clothing I suggest you head out to the premium outlet near downtown vegas but if you're in to surfing brands, good kicks, and skinny jeans, this place is for you.

Levis is always having great discounts on their jeans so before you go paying for it full priced at the near by Town Square, this place is just about 5 min drive away and if you want to save, why not check it out.

Quicksilver, Hurley, Billabong, and even Oneil are all here, so duuude come on braaaah, check these places out for totally awesome sales duuude.  

Now for the kicks....Nike, Adidas, Converse and other great brand names are here too.  Im not really knowledgeable when it comes to how much these shoes should be compared to whats out there because all I buy are chucks so I can't really tell you whether the deals here are great or not.

5182447,2006-07-28,2,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"Looking for bargains in Vegas?  Don't go to the Strip, with its skeevy souvenir stores and pricey casino malls.  Instead, head over to the Las Vegas Outlet Mall, where you can actually get something for your money besides the thrill of plunking it into a one-armed bandit.

This outlet mall is huge, and it just goes on and on...and on.  And on.  It's so big that there are two food courts, and one of them is located next to a carousel.  Yes, there is a somewhat random feel to the layout and selection of stores, but it's such a diverse mix that there will be something for everyone in your group to browse through - though you might have some trouble meeting up again later.

Some of my favorite stores include the Fossil outlet, which has tables of $20 and $30 watches (but make sure they check the battery before you leave); Charlotte Russe, which has a fun mix of funky and bohemian women's clothes, and a giant clearance rack in the back (I got a super-cute skirt there for $8 that I wear all the time); Vans, which has styles you won't see in regular stores and a big sale section; and Levi's, where you can get irregulars for half the price of normal Levi's.

Other notable stores include Liz Claiborne, Jones New York, Nike, Reebok, and Tommy Hilfiger.  Shoe lovers will find Adidas, Bass, Skechers, and Naturalizers, among others.  There are home furnishings stores (Mikasa, Black & Decker), leather stores (Wilson, and, soon, Coach), and gourmet foods (Harry & David, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory).  

As with any ""outlet"" mall, there are some stores that seem suspiciously non-outlet, and some weird stores that are just oddball (like the rocks 'n' geodes shop).  Plan to spend at least an afternoon here, particularly if you're hiding out from the intense Vegas heat.  You may spend more than you planned - I always do - but unlike at the casinos, at least you'll have something to show for it when you head back home.",Ffa1cXIvFAy8H1sorICaiQ,2,2,4,CITmVLt8962poXZuTI39Og

Okay, so they're not stocking Vogue fashion here. However, they are stocking plenty of solid colored knits for $10 and under, and some crazy $3 ties. It's worth a looksie. Then, head straight. Watch out for the kiosk hucksters or you may end up with Dead Sea Salts, a smokeless cigarette, some jewelry cleaner and a knockoff Sham-Wow. Stop by Calvin Klein and head to the back where they generally have a good selection of an additional 50-70% off items. Next stop, Vans. The store is much bigger than the Premium Outlet location. While you're in skater mode, visit Hurley. They have some cute stuff for the ladies, and if you are in complete teen angst you can check out Hot Topic. (They have some unique accessory options, like glittery fishnet stockings.) Always stop by the classic Adidas store. Good finds have included a Def Jams track suit and a stash of Star Wars collectibles. Yoda tennis shoes anyone? If you're in the market for ""come hither"" heels or just shoes, Closet has a pretty good selection if you don't mind wearing Carlos, Jessica or Fergie! And for the grand finale, explore hair options at the wig shop. You'll have to invest $6 for a wig cap to try on a full wig, but it's worth the investment if you are considering a color or cut change! (I personally learned I would make a hideous blonde!) They also have a good selection of extensions and smaller hair additions. If you've still got juice, you can head over to Off Saks. Otherwise, call it a day and come back soon as it looks like the place is undergoing a face lift. I admit I'll miss the neon.

The Goods:
* You can get some great clothing items for very good prices.
* They are currently remodeling the front-end, so hopefully the result will pay off for the Center.

The Bads:
* It's on the ass-end of the Strip.  You don't happen to wander upon this unless you are specifically looking for it, or get one of those motels down in that area (And why would you?).
* Other than the carousel, it's not very kid friendly, as all the stores that could have proven entertaining have closed down in the last year or so.  I'd suggest a babysitter, or pray they like hanging out in the food court.
* There's a few kitchen places, and one or two specialty stores, but largely, there's not a lot of diversity in the shopping experience.

Now.  For the biggest complaint.  And the reason I HATE coming out to this place.

The mall kiosk vendors.

Look, I did this sort of job once way back in the day.  Its not glamorous, and it's boring because you are usually stuck selling things no one really thinks about buying.  Or wants.  But I refer to this Outlet Center as ""The Gauntlet"".

Kiosk after kiosk of rude, pushy people who chase you down, yell at you from across the way, rub their wares on you whether you ask (or want) them to or not, and my favorite is when they actually stand in your way to block you and force you to stop.  And when you try to sidestep them, they sidestep WITH you to keep you blocked.  

Oh, Hell no.

I came here last night to shop at the Levi's store and unfortunately there were no good sales so I left without buying anything. Very rare for me.

There is plenty of parking and I do have a favorite spot to park at just because there is less traffic and easier for me to enter and exit the lot.

They do have two food court areas and some restroom stalls for your convenience placed inside the outlet. And we were able to check out the other stores outside of the indoor outlet. There were other restaurants outside that we recognized, such as Buffalo Wild Wings, but they were on the other side of the parking lot across from the outlet stores and just too far to go over there in the heat.

There are tons of stores in this mall, as well as two food courts. Some of my favorite stores I like to check out are - Nike, Under Armour, Quiksilver, Converse, & Vans.

The North Premium Outlet may not be as big, or have as much stores, but if you just happen to stay at a hotel in the downtown area like - the California Hotel, Fremont, Four Queens, Golden Nugget, Main Street, The D, Plaza Hotel, or Downtown Grand Hotel, the North Premium Outlet Mall is not too far away from these downtown hotels........... 

You can probably take a long walk, catch a bus, or even a taxi down to the North Premium Outlet Mall, as it's not too far away.

I went to buy some work pants, so I basically knew I wasn't going any farther than the first section where Nike is located, and of course where Haggar is. Haggar has been my go to place for work pants and shorts for a long time, and they didn't disappoint with $18 pairs of slacks.

5852995,2012-04-27,0,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,This is the BEST outlet mall I have ever been too! It was a little packed but it is outlets so that is expected. Great deals tons and tons of stores from high end spots to normal spots. I could be there from open to close,uOZfTn018w1xHW2DAtE8sA,0,0,5,1w8eBN3jbISNMkEld1s1Gg
5862526,2013-11-20,1,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,This place has a little bit of everything. From high end brands to brands you've never heard of. Majority of the stores are inside and a few are outside. It does get pretty crowded here even when you are just walking around - window shopping.,yFpmlk4flcdeIx7bAorSHA,1,1,3,ymJSbrhrS9CMt8IxgF0tug

be weary of the kiosks. those guys are salesmen to the umpteenth power. 

theres food shops here and there but the 3 times ive visited the mall ive only went for the shopping and im outty.. no need to overstay such an unwelcoming experience.",zI33AwSbuUCrH6i4vh4JkA,0,0,2,EUrGXXF6Cru7Msq7_2z4Kg
5895235,2015-01-19,28,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"Las Vegas South Premium Outlets is the sister outlet mall to the North Premium Outlets.  I usually prefer going to these outlets over the North Outlets because South is indoors.  It can get rough shopping in triple digit weather.  If I wrote this review a couple of years ago, I would've given it 2.5-3 stars based on the variety of stores this mall has.  I was stoked when I re-visited in November 2014 and found that a bunch of new stores had opened, including one of my favorites-Express.    

There's ample parking here and the mall is anchored at the entrances by the higher end outlets like Coach, Michael Kors and Guess.  They have a food court in the middle of the mall, kiosks spread out between all of the stores and my favorite kiosk right at the middle entrance, Dunkin' Donuts. 

This is a great little strip mall that's constantly changing due to the turnover in stores but the variety's usually not bad and its location can't be beat.  These outlets are just a few minutes away from McCarran International airport and really easy to find.",-WYbVngIGDQ81MY12UtwnA,31,33,4,Z0lKPO3wuuW76r5CGCUDPw

5905790,2013-08-15,2,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"I love to hate this mall, it is always so crowded with tourists, tourists that are rude and have no idea how to walk the halls of a shopping mall. 

If you are a local, go at night.... An hour before closing and you are lucky enough to get in and out with everything you need, less the stress of the people that stop right in front of you, elbow you, smell funny Etc.

You are sure to get a deal but watch for the return policy, seems they have a stricter policy in place than if you are to visit the same store outside this mall. 

Also, if you want deals, pick up the magazine near the map..... It has coupons in it.",6I6DIjwiFEXfseDwToI4bA,5,1,3,kRc-cizgP3FTxGdUxL0Now
5912922,2016-08-24,0,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"This is a decent outlet mall located on the far south end of the Las Vegas strip. It has a good mix of high-end (Coach, Michael Kors, Kate Spade) and non high-end stores (Vanity Fair/Wrangler/Lee store), and the majority of the stores are located inside the mall (nice for the hot, sweltering days). 

While here, the hubby and I discovered a Citizen watch store. Being huge fans of their Eco Drive watches, we had to stop in. Hubby didn't buy anything, but I found a great watch for only $99! 

If you get hungry, there is a large food court here, and there is a popcorn stand that you can smell from a mile away as well. 

One thing that I do wish the mall would crack down on are the kiosk associates and their aggressive nature. At least 3 times on our most recent trip here, we had kiosk workers practically leap out at us and yell to get our attention like carnival barkers. I absolutely cannot stand that. Listen, if I am at all interested in what you're selling, I will approach you. Okay? I also feel that there are way too many kiosks in the mall, period. It makes things rather congested when walking in the mall. Whoever is in charge of the mall, please look into this.",-n0qdY-nw1GT6yE7EsOc4Q,3,0,3,E8FB3KueppxXSLSdhm4fpw
5931260,2016-07-04,0,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"Tons of stores to chose from and ample parking but this place just has a strange vibe every time I walk in. I have no idea why it's just strange! Go early in the day because this place becomes overrun with tourists.

They do have a few places to eat in the food courts your typical mall fast foods. The place is kept reasonably clean for how busy it gets. Be careful crossing the parking lot though between tourists in rental cars having no clue where they are going and the ever persistent crazy taxi drivers it can be a tad bit dangerous out there.",m9LlKOpkMwEa7LPyugFiZw,1,0,3,YSf1WKjUgSuUep3xH7pipQ

My favorite stores in here are the Hot Topic and Coach Outlets.  The Coach store here seems to have a really good selection here and I've bough oh about 3 purses there so far!",yy_KQA1FtwilaG-7LB4BgA,0,0,3,aVo61hQ8iYfS-vjlxfH5wQ
5960004,2012-09-03,0,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"I have been coming to these outlets since they used be called Belz. Honestly, I still call them that most of the time and probably won't stop any time soon. They have had a lot of renovation of this mall over the years and the result is positive.

I always enjoy perusing the stores and kiosks when I'm in the area. Not a huge fan of having the mall split up between the main portion and the annex, since I have to get back in my car and repark if I want to check out any of the stores on the side. Overall, I enjoy this outlet mall quite a bit and have been frequenting it quite a bit more lately since I work in the area.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,4,q5BJ4YZomTQgdtqSIbmWnQ
5962846,2016-08-09,2,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"Update Review!  Needed to give Las Vegas South Premium Outlets an upgrade.  Why?  The answer is because they have finished the makeover I requested!  Alright, maybe they did not have the makeover cause I mentioned it a few years ago.  Still, cool to think that I may have influenced it.  ;)

I must maintain that the best thing that I like about this outlet mall is that it is indoors so there is air conditioning!!  It is great to come here during the hot summer months.  The selection of stores is better now, but not as good as their sister outlet in town.  The selection of restaurants at their food courts appear improved also.  After this makeover, the place is more crowded so parking is difficult to find sometimes now.  I like walking around and browsing while my wife shops away.  There are deals to be found if you look hard enough.

Have to say that I am now a fan of the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet Mall.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,6,2,4,dYs2ppj7ryOoFsPv9zaDkg
5964640,2017-03-01,0,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"I get to go here every time I come to Vegas with my wife. She likes to shop and I do somewhat. This a large covered indoor shopping mall that is supposed to be items at a discount price. And in most cases that is true, but you have to know what the price is else where to know you are getting a deal. Me I get my Birkenstofck sandals here. You can get them just a cheep from other place mail order. But here I can try them on and make sure they are what I want. I like the kitchen shops and they used to have Black and Decker but no more. Boo. They used to have Wolf camera but no more. again Boo. For your wife they have a bunch of places to shop but for me it is limited to a few stores. As in most malls there are people in the center isles/walkways trying to sell you stuff you don't meed. There is a Starbucks for the Starbuck fans.",SBnmBbp_2em6cdA7z0-duQ,2,0,3,DM4t4sFX8w3IrxqzxMC4Cw
5967064,2012-12-27,1,9edPSkfXKsJmkZYIaOmA7Q,"This outlet mall is outdated, hard to navigate and is really more like a large strip mall.

There was a sign on the North end of the building for the only store I wanted to go to - Skechers.  I parked there in hopes of getting in and out quickly.  Skechers is on the farthest South end of the building.  You live, you learn.

I wouldn't come here again, as the inside reminds me of a ghetto strip mall.  It has some ""higher-end"" stores, but most of the stuff is off-season or similarly priced to the regular mall.",_jjbwHWLFA5GjWFWGLj4ZQ,1,1,3,Tt7OujoO5xIPeFug7rBMhA
