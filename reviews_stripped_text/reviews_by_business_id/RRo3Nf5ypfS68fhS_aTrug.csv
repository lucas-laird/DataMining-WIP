The only problem was when I first tried placing an order on Hawaiian Food online I had a question on the freight , they didn't respond to my email at all but my mind was set on sending this package to my son, so I again went online to order and this time the freight cost was working, so I placed my order.

Freight is expensive due to the type of packing its needed to send the product I wanted the boys to enjoy.  They are flying high in Texas. 

I will definitely send a package to the boys again.",yVmfdtk_R0LTh9eWNjTZhg,0,0,4,pykoW0FAW3sFXnITcGCcmA

The last order I made with them, they did not pay attention to my instructions, and delivered my order on the wrong date.  they did not return any of my many frantic emails and phone calls to rectify the situation!  The food from my $100 order spoiled on my dad's doorstep!!!  Auwe!  Shame on you!   And I was a repeat customer.......but no more!",noq7Ud-FMLMVVsVA3VJUqA,1,0,1,MBQbz0ywTb8pA_ns1z9uLw

Emailed them & nothing. Going to file a claim with my credit card company. They aren't going to keep my $180!",Icaq5GKJLgqDZ_ad2eC8rg,0,0,1,KXK0k_2u-QiFRjfVFULgZQ
