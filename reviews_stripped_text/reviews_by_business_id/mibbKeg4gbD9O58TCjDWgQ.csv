148727,2015-08-22,3,mibbKeg4gbD9O58TCjDWgQ,"First of all, let me preface this review by saying I love Roberto's. I mean shit, you're hearing from a guy who once ate it 18 days in a row when I first moved here from Phoenix. Dead serious, check 4 square I think I'm still the mayor? 

However, this specific location is amateur hour. ESPECIALLY, the Friday late night crew. I've often made my order crystal fuckin' clear only to get home and open up a complete disaster. Not only is the order a muff job but the shit is either burnt or raw. Maybe it's because multiple people take my order or maybe it's because the lead cashier was busy buying weed from a customer in back. 

Whatever the issue is I hope it gets fixed because while I'll never eat at this location again, I hope to have the confidence I once had in the Roberto's name restored so that I may be allowed to quench my carne asada fries thirst without the fuckery of non professionals. 

P.S. I ALWAYS tip these mother fuckers. Can you believe that shit? WTF is my problem?",7RsAdWGKQ6I9llxZmrV1iQ,0,0,1,oQm4LpLtH-uPPAHJXpe1EQ

I asked for a refund of my drink because they could not offer me a cold drink that I paid for. She refused and was very sassy and rude about it.

This visit we got the Carne asada nachos, (side note: always get the pico, sour cream, and guacamole on the side, so if you don't finish right away, the nachos don't get soggy in the fridge) a cheese quesadilla, and 4 chicken tacos. On Wednesdays the chicken tacos are $1, and they are tasty and filling. The nachos were pretty bland. Matter of fact all the meats are flavorless. I'm pretty sure they don't put any seasoning on anything. I  always doctor my food up with lots of lime, s&p, and green salsa, then it tastes better. The quesadilla was swimming in grease, so it was extremely unappetizing. I'm sure I'll eat at Robertos again, but probably not this location.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,6,5,2,RPtNJ64O7P5Hwnaw3Kriog

 There is always plenty of parking, and Wednesday is $.99 Chicken Taco Day! Whohoo!  
 Some locations run out of ice or don't have the air on on summer, but this one always has both.
 The only thing marking them down is that sometimes the grease puddles on the plate. Letting the fried food drip for a second or keeping the oil hotter would fix it, moving them to a perfect score.",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,4,4,4,w6EfPf0KrwK6HjBTQJqxIA

Rude service and employee behind the counter, old salas and condiments it just makes it worse. I called ahead for my order and then when I got there 10 minutes later it wasn't ready and the cashier said ""it's almost done we are making it now."" The cook hadn't even started the order yet. I got home and my order was wrong. Went back and then he argued with me about the order being wrong and would only remake one of the burritos. I took the whole uneaten, cut in half (to share with two others)  order with me back to the restaurant. He put on gloves then took my old order and opened it up to inspect. After discussing the the anatomy of my dissected burritos he concluded that only one was made incorrectly and I could have back the ""correct"" order so he wrapped it back up for me...",vEhSrUQCuGCuhtoMHC06AQ,0,0,1,c_NMbwckdJJI7369YT1Z_w
5075934,2014-05-19,0,mibbKeg4gbD9O58TCjDWgQ,Figured this place could use a recent review as the last were almost a year ago. I have only been to Roberto's a few times and this was my first time visiting this particular one. We just moved in not too far away and decided to stop in on the way home from a night out. This is definitely not the most glamorous place but the guy at the register was kind and outgoing and I liked that you can see into the kitchen and watch everything that goes on. It was after 1am I believe and its one of the better non-fast food options. The breakfast burrito was huge (I actually wish they had a smaller option) and a bit heavy for a late night meal... however it was very tasty. I'm sure I'll be back now that it is so close. I always see a bunch of people there when I drive by so this location must do fairly well despite the negative reviews. Hopefully my experiences stay positive moving forward!,sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,1,0,4,j_MwwBNx99Fd2x6kS65WGA

It's great she's there for her workers but she needs to learn how to listen to customer complaints without getting offended. I told her I wouldn't come back to this location and she laughed and said okay! Would not recommend this place at all!!!,SbvwSuZhcl1tz-r-9nukzQ,0,0,1,sCX1R0mvCH6oEE_fxak5rg
5688115,2016-06-01,4,mibbKeg4gbD9O58TCjDWgQ,"I've been going to this location since 2005 and have noticed its quality in product has dropped severely.  No more of their dried out carne today I get carne jerky ! Black as it gets too mmmm appealing. Then I call the manager to tell them and all I hear is this cannot be.  Please it's not the first time it's happened and it won't be the last its just the last time I'm dealing with paying money for crap praying it will be consistent.  Now I'm leaving my home office to go and return my food.  The manager gives and offers no customer service as I am here.  ""do you wanna you money back or what ?"" Ummmm  if any of my managers acted as such id be outraged. How about you as the manager make a decision to do what is right to make a customer.  I would have returned my money and made my food for free. This is ridiculous the lack of consideration knowing I had to take time out of my day to come back so they could fix their mistake.  I do business consulting and this restaurant needs major customer service manners.  I got my food remade because I will be writing reports for he next 7 hours and one taco and one quesadilla last for a long long time ! But to the white headed manager / owner learn how to treat your clients.  Do you offer to pay me my value for my personal time , my gas money ? No all very horrid service and I and all my friends as they read this on Yelp face book and Twitter @jennysook holler will know your customer service needs a major attitude adjustment !! Your hand delivered food to my table and a sorry was too little too late ! Have a better more apologetic attitude like that from the beginning not when I show up with my food showing you the travesty you served that you find edible giving me no excuse why it was served to be in the first place",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,3,3,1,JqQa4Nm0TpSQM_E5gDDiFg

Between the two of them something left me feeling a little queasy, my bet would be on the cabeza but not sure. The cabeza wasn't as good as I've had elsewhere. The burrito was a bit better. The food is cheap--you can find something that will fill you up for around $5 if you want to, but I am not sure if I'll be back.

C'mon 1.25 that's ridiculous I've heard of .50 then .95 cents extra for everything cheese,bacon on a breakfast burrito C'mon seriously that ridiculous!! Then forget asking questions,they couldn't answer it, looked at us like a deer in headlights and walked away to grab someone else that still couldn't understand and spoke good English just decided to ignore the question. The food portions are ridiculously small for what I paid. 4.00 for a breakfast burrito 3.90 for a carniasada burrito ended up totaled to 15. After all the dam fees!!

Not to mention their burritos at this location is like 1/2 or 1/3 the size of all the other locations that I've visited.
