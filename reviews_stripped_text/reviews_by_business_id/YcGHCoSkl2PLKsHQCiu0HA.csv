I've gotten their carne asada nachos and they're so good! The asada is seasoned and not fatty, good helping of cheese and sour cream and guacamole.

2536696,2018-02-22,0,YcGHCoSkl2PLKsHQCiu0HA,"First time visit:
The good: 
Friendly staff. Good al carte & combination plate options. Reasonable prices. Large portion. Easy ordering. Fast preparation.

The bad: 
Large salty burrito. I think the culprit was the chicken. When restaurants over salt their food - it's concerning since it's sometimes done to coverup not so fresh meat products or to act as a preservative. The cook may have just had a heavy hand.  Regardless, the ridiculous amount of salt ruined what would have otherwise been a darn good burrito.

The store could benefit from being redesigned & updated (interior & exterior). Even just updating signage & menu elements/methods would help improve things. 

Tiny styrofoam water cups. C'mon, just give a regular size cup for water. Having to get up multiple times during a meal to keep refilling tiny cups is annoying and unnecessary.  Also, try using more planet friendly materials...there are better alternatives in similar price range as styrofoam.

The ugly:
It's in a sketchy area (or rather, the folks who hang out around the store are sketchy!). This aspect isn't part of my rating of the restaurant though.",nnT9-ZsEGLVMmi4_u34RWw,0,0,2,yztNGnnpRKDwTpuQHDSYTg

Always have to try the tacos- They offer 3 tacos for $5, so I tried 1 chicken, 1 carne asada and 1 al pastor, added a cheese quesadilla and a side of rice. 2 churros for desert. The tacos were very flavorful and filling. Quesadilla needed more cheese and you can't ever go wrong with some rice. I chose the spicy red sauce for dipping and it was so good.

4035437,2018-07-01,20,YcGHCoSkl2PLKsHQCiu0HA,"When the craving for Mexican foods comes on usually I have to seek out an establishment on the strip. This is not easy for locals just looking for something fast. I found that sweet spot that meets my needs half way. It's not epic cuisine, but it beats many other fast food type places. It rides that thin line. Their food is even great with home made margaritas. They do not sell alcohol here, but their lobby is not big at all. This is best for take out and enjoy at home with the family and a great movie or show on Netflix.

The staff here is so amazing and while Spanish is their first language, they can understand English perfectly. I was able to place my order and even answered some of the questions he asked in Spanish with my broken Spanish. Again, the lobby is super small with only three tables. This restaurant is constantly busy too. There were three people in line when I came in. The line moves slow but it is because most orders are like mine, huge and with only two employees they fulfill the orders promptly and efficiently too. My order was 100 percent perfect. 

whole family wanted Mexican food so our order consisted of this: the number 2 which is two beef tacos with beans and rice. An order of Carne Asada fries which has steak on top of french fries and sour cream all over the place. Off the a la carte I ordered 3 regular beef tacos, a bean tostado, and the three rolled tacos. All the food was amazing and tasty. What could be a better night than Mexican food, margaritas, and Netflix all at home!


Wanted to yet update again:

When is it a good time for Mexican food? How
about everyday!
After trying this restaurant again, wanted to re-Yelp about it.

Decided to try other items from the menu, and retry a few already sampled.
This time the cashier (did not catch her name), that took my order was so amazing and helpful. After I placed my order which went fine, she came out and was cleaning tables in the lobby. I was doing my Yelp thing. 

You know that thing don't eat it till I take a picture of it. I was taking picture of the food. And out of the corner of my eye; you get the look. What are you doing? Did we make that order right for the customer?

I happily told her that I was writing a Yelp review and taking pictures of the food for the review. She nodded and went on cleaning the tables. Sometimes we have to explain our passion and weirdness to the outside. 

The service here is stellar and from prior reviews on Yelp I see why so many people re-visit again and again! Ok three separate occasions with three different cashiers to achieve no imperfections is something to Yelp about. Thanks for providing the customers with such greatness, it keeps us all coming back for more.

This round everyone was hungry so we went with a take out order. We ordered two orders of the steak fries but with no guacamole. The steak this time was well done and they don't skimp on the steak, cheese, or sour cream. For $8.99 what a deal! My oldest had the No 2 again but on his two tacos only meat and cheese, no rabbit food. The twins and I shared the a order of the cheese enchiladas and one of the beef enchilada. These are yummy too! The only disappointment was the cheese enchiladas could have the cheese melted a little more! But it's not worth cutting any stars over.

We cannot forget the puppy I ordered her a beef taco but without the salsa. And I had half of it. This was great plus the puppy did get some cheese enchilada too. However, my half of the beef taco I drowned in green sauce. 

The green sauce that they serve here is very good and it gives that burn effect later.

This visit will tide we over until I need another fix of Mexican food! I will return again and again as I've done in the past!",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,34,32,5,tfsb0CSjQeb-Ab-nPIHniQ

Their breakfast burritos will knock off the socks of any ""robertos"" - they're junk! 

Great churros - I wish they had a dipping sauce though! 

The prices are great. . You won't find better street style tacos in this area. 

The hot sauces the have are incredible. . Red , Green (I think) and my absolute favorite their Habanero sauce!!!

When you're no longer dating a Mexican, it's tiring trying to find a mother who will cook you some bomb posole! So you settle with finding posole at a Mexican restaurant, and even that's hard find! 

When I see posole, (not menudo) I'm Suppose to get it by law. This place did my posole cravings enough. It was pork which I usually prefer chicken! But I'm a beggar at this point so I can't also be a chooser. That would just make me unlikable! 

Tacos were decent! Posole was decent. Also super ghetto area!

Food: The Al Pastor and carne asada were rich in seasoning and cooked perfectly. Other Mexican fast food restaurants tend to overcook their meat or put little to no seasonings. I was surprise how juicy and flavorful they came out to be! I haven't had Al Pastor in a long time and to have it done the right way is flippin' awesome. 

Location: Located inside the 76 gas station. If you're going northbound on Las Vegas boulevard, it'll be on your left. 

Quick service with friendly employees. I suggest you take your food to-go since there's only 3 tables. Other than that, this place is a diamond in the rough for the Southeast valley!
