The pizza is precooked and ready for you to grab.
I had my reservations ordering a pizza in a airport, but it was not bad, not gre as t but eatable.
The pizza is like a pan pizza with thick crust. The sauce was tasty and they did not skimp on the cheese.
The toppings were a bit thin , but it is a small pizza. 
One big negative is these pizzas sit under s heatlamp in a cardboard box and they tend yt? o dry out.
Overall, not bad.",dYzmK4IvlFHN-sUrsnyg9Q,1,1,3,b4VEsTEWowvT2aPC4KbRSw

In fact I'm alittle worried for my stomach. I got it to go or i would have returned it!,jOJl4LHuIVDubcNlNGHahQ,0,0,1,cFePbug8-mA-XDH52mA7dA

I am really jealous of all the travelers flying in and out of Terminal 3.  They have all the good restaurants.  When you're in Terminal 1, specifically the C-Gates, you're limited to a lot of fast food.  Villa Fresh Italian Kitchen is just another fast food restaurant inside the C-Gates.  Lunch and dinner is okay.  They have pizza, meatballs, and pasta.  I'll usually go with their wings for lunch or dinner.  I recommend Villa Fresh if you're here early enough for breakfast.  Their eggs, bacon, sausage, and pancakes is as good as you're going to get in this terminal.  Good Luck!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,4,3,3,7SR2_izPcuqv-86l4G9Apg

I ordered food then asked for a cup of hot water, which I have been drinking since childhood plus I would have a hard time sleeping if I ordered hot tea.  I always ask for hot water at every single fast food or restaurant I visited and there has never been a problem until I visited this place.  This one staff told me that they would have to charge me for hot tea which cost $2.29.  I told him it was ridiculous and he claimed that every restaurant in the airport did that.  I did not have time or didn't bother to verify that but I really do not believe it was the truth.  That was too petty.  How can someone do business not being generous.  They better understand they will lose thousands of customers for wanting to charge their customer $2.29 for something that hardly cost anything.  I will not give this place any more business.  No more visits !",vzFShpkLsDh0gYW0HDmalQ,1,0,1,q-2_0H9ae47nX7PQCwJ8vA
