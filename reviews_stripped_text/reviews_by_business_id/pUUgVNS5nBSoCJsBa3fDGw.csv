We ordered AYCE, Ordered one roll each to start with. Comes out fast so plus points for that. I ordered a coke. The waitress never came with it. After our plates being empty for 15 minutes we decided fuck it let's go somewhere else. The restaurant was empty. Only us in there! 3 waitresses! They were just standing there and talking. I even had to say hello? And they still didn't stop talking to each other. When one girl finally comes, We say that we just want to pay for the two rolls and no longer have the AYCE. She says I don't know if it's possible. Don't know? You guys are apparently at work to socialize with each other. Leave the only customers you in your whole restaurant waiting while y'all are chatting off in Japanese. We ended up paying for 2 rolls without even a apology! The waitress said it's slow today? So? Do your god damn job with the only customers you have. I didn't even want to pay for the two rolls we got! If y'all want a good sushi place here in summerlin my fellow sushi lovers try yummy sushi!

They have a very good menu with some very delicious rolls. The Vegas roll is one of my all time favorites. The quality of the fish is very good, and the rolls are made well as to not fall apart when you pick them up. 

Unfortunately, the good does not come without the bad: In the past we have had some issues with service during busy times, however it has been much better over our past couple of visits. There is also an additional charge for nigiri which definitely deters many from ordering it.

Ultimately, this is a good sushi joint I will continue to return to, as long as the service times remain reasonable. The prices here are affordable, the environment is comfortable, and all of the sushi is made with quality fish.",TaXyFGy07lgntQXgvHFSrA,0,0,4,bRYVN5naEEAFgWLfXJUgiA

I ate here 4 times just in 2 month.
only $17.95 for luch, $20.95 for dinner.
their rolls are so good and fresh.

- If you like soft shell crab or sweat sauce try their starbucks roll. 
- If you like spicy, try die hard! chef will give you choice of the suace 1 to 5 
- If you are fan of rainbow roll, try candycane roll you will like it.
- If you cannot eat sushi,they have big appetizer menu like Korean bulbogi, salmon kama, teriyaki, mushroom cap, ramen, tempura, and baked mussels (what I liked about their mussel is that they don't put too much sauce like other restaurents so you can taste actual mussel not the yum and eel sauce.)

If you like to add nigiri, it is extra $4 for nigiri all U can eat.
I had uni, amaebi, Ikura with quail egg, yellotail, garlic tuna, and salmon sushi and everything was so fresh.

361762,2013-09-03,0,pUUgVNS5nBSoCJsBa3fDGw,"I heard from a couple people about The Sushi so I decided to give it a try. I made sure after reading the reviews that I found the correct one. I did, but only after going to the one across the street first. 

I feel this place has great potential. I like the space of the restaurant. We were seated in a booth near the sushi bar. We ordered Salmon and Albacore nigiri, some rolls, oysters on the half shell, and uni. 

My problem started right from ordering. The sushi chef behind the bar calls out to us and asked for our order. It was awkward calling out our order. It's not like people weren't at the bar and we were the only ones around. We were at a booth, the waiter should've come. 

The nigiri was good, it seemed fresh. My oysters however weren't very cold. They weren't warm, but should've been a little cooler. It made me skeptical and people shouldn't have to be skeptical about the food they're about it eat. 

Then I eat the Uni, my favorite and must have every time I have sushi. First bite, Uni awesomeness. Second bite, the crunch of the shell of the sea urchin. Completely disappointing. 

We decide to order some sake. It comes out and things got worse. My sake glass has lipstick on it. I felt like I coudn't get a break with this place. I left extremely dissatisfied and disappointed.

We came for dinner, we waited about10 minutes for a table for four though, in plain view there were tables/seats available to accommodate us, no biggie we waited patiently. There were only two servers, we rolled with the tide and practiced patience for i.e. water refills and order taking.

The defining moment for us was...my husband paid the bill with plastic, our daughter left paper for the tip, she placed the tip at the inside of the table and not in the check holder. As we walked out, I heard the male server open the door and say something, I didn't hear what he said, however my son did. My son asked, ""did you hear what he said? I said, ""no"". My son heard the male server open the door and said ""are you f@*king kidding me?"" I presume he opened the check holder and saw 0 on the tip line of the signed check.

My son went back into the restaurant and confronted the male server, who of course denied saying anything.

793139,2015-06-30,1,pUUgVNS5nBSoCJsBa3fDGw,"Came here about a week ago with a few friends. We arrived about an hour and a half before they closed. I ordered 4 or 5 orders of yellowtail and the waitress told me they were no longer serving AYCE because they were about to close.

This was quite disappointing as I knew they had an hour of operation left. I deduced she simply didn't want to serve that much nigiri because it's more costly for these places to serve real sushi than spruced up imitation crab rolls.

We told her never mind and started to leave. She goes into the kitchen and comes back as if she had to get approval to serve us AYCE. Sadly, she and the chef were the only ones there.

So we order our food. The whole table orders a few yellowtail and when they arrived, one plate was normal, one plate was brown and decrepit. It appeared as though they had pulled fish out of the garbage can, rinsed it off, and slapped it on rice.

I eat yellowtail quite frequently. It shouldn't be brown. Or purple for that matter.

I told the waitress I didn't want to eat the rotten looking fish and she said ""at least eat some."" Yes. At least eat some of this diarrhea inducing assfish.

I had to pay my friend to eat all of the gross yellowtail as a dare.

-$5

The nightmare didn't end there. As we went to pay, the waitress proceeded to include gratuity in all of our bills as if we weren't going to tip. Probably a smart move on her part.

And yes, I did have the runs the following day.

After about 5-7 minutes of awkward standing around just inside the entrance, we were noticed by a waitress who had a look of shock and despair on her face like she had never seen a customer before. Seriously, you should have seen it. We couldn't help but laugh because it was so outrageously awkward. We were finally put at a table even though we requested to sit at the bar twice. We placed our first order of all you can eat rather quickly, which was nice. And then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Meanwhile, for entertainment we watched the chefs and waitresses fumble their way through 30 minutes of bad service to other guests. One man sarcastically cheered when he was finally able to place an order (he was already seated when we walked in). There seemed to be a lot of confusion about which sushi roll went to which table. There was also a lot of confused wandering taking place. the waitresses were basically walking in circles as if forgetting where they placed their car keys. Finally after becoming quite hangry, we decided to politely flag down a waitress and tell her that we had enough and we wanted to leave. She gave us a lame excuse that they were busy with 3 large tables (about 5 people at each table) and several (8 people) at the bar with only 2 sushi chefs.

We took a risk trying another sushi place because we are in LOVE with Naka Sushi (just across Lake Meade if you're looking for quality all you can eat sushi) and it bit us this time. We will absolutely not be going back to the sushi. Naka's sushi is worth waiting until he reopens on the 17th!!",21Xw1CCf8pJWQ36XEf8srw,0,0,1,G7_ZVXvxrpAsud8JLn_Q3Q

They attend to their customers very well. That was the thing I think I enjoyed the most since I am not a sushi eater. Most of my reviews on sushi places come from the non-sushi eater perspective. 

Keep in mind that we went to the all-you-can-eat dinner session where it was $20 I believe. So my portions were on the small size, almost like tapas sizes. 

Number one item I always get are the dumplings, aka, Gyoza here. I have had better for sure. They did not have much of a taste to them as ones I have tried elsewhere. So not a big fan of them here. 

Number two item was the chicken fried rice. Now that was delicious. Their flavoring was very unique. I could not quite figure it out, but was very good. My favorite dish of all. 

Number three and four as the chicken dishes I tried. I tried both the chicken teriyaki and the breaded chicken dish. I loved the teriyaki a lot, but not the breaded one as much. It was a weird taste. 

Last of course was miso soup. It was pretty good, but pretty average. Definitely had better.

Let me just start by saying my review has nothing to do with the CHEFS, who I might add are taking care of a group at the bar and they seem to be enjoying themselves, my review is a reflection of the service ive received here over and over by the servers. Now normally I get good service at The Sushi, my aunts recommended this place to me in 2012 and I kept coming back, especially after this one instance where the chef made our entire meal a chefs special knowing we are not picky and love everything they dish out! The last 2 years this place has been going down the drain on service.
Today, 8/31/15 i am sitting here at my table as i write this and i am being blatantly IGNORED. nothing irritates me more than a server that ignores a table, and im the only person in a booth at 4:52pm on a Monday...  seriously? 
In 30 minutes ive gotten 1 water and my 2 appetizers.. the least this server could do is ask how were doing... although she hasn't even smiled once at us.
The food here has always been great and ive always liked their Sake choices, especially their White Peach Hana Sake. The atmosphere is casual, and on a busy night you really feel good vibes in the air. I think the restaurant is a great dining experience. But i just can not keep giving my money to a place that hires such rude people. I can tell even now that this lady must want to get off work. Let's see some more smiles! -_-

I was a little skeptical of the sushi when we first pulled up because you hear horror stories of strip-mall sushi restaurants. When we first walked in I was pleasantly surprised by how clean and modern the restaurant was. We were enthusiastically greeted and sat. 

I was also skeptical that most of the sushi restaurants in Summerlin were all-you-can-eat. We don't have much of those in San Diego because they usually mean poor quality fish in more quantities. However, this is not the case at ""The Sushi."" This might possibly be the best sushi I have ever had (not at a 5 star restaurant)- for the price. 

Go for dinner and get the specialty rolls. I have tried many of them and they are all so delicious. The sushi rolls are large so I normally only can get two- but anything with the screaming O sauce is delicious. If you have the stomach for it, you can order a half roll for your last roll which gives you the chance to order something new. 

Their spicy garlic edamame is also delicious and so is their deserts! Needless to say, we go every week now!",MHCerAmy_1TGc85p4Qr-5A,2,1,5,AB_v8CRPw4aAa58VCyfwFw

Yesterday in particular I was craving for super white tuna so I decided to make a stop here. 
They offer AYCE with two choices: 20 for rolls + 4 extra if you want AYCE nigiri.
 
My boyfriend and I ordered some nigiri we got super white tuna and garlic tuna and they were OK. They put lots of rice with a little slice of fish. Then we got four additional rolls after that (we were really hungry haha) 
We got the starbucks roll, which i thought was too sweet with all that sauce they drenched on it. 
The japanese lasagna (it's our staple with rolls, because it's really good to pair it with a spicy roll) 
And a spicy roll we ordered was the Die Hard which was okay, it wasn't super spicy. We dipped it in a side of garlic ponzu for more flavor. 
(I can't remember the name of the last roll we got) 

Needless to say, the flavors weren't on point. They seemed lacking flavor or drenched with too much sauce to add flavor.

Now, the prices here are pretty good.  $17.95 for lunch and $20.95 for dinner. making this one of the cheapest if not THE cheapest lunch price I've seen in the valley.

Don't let it fool you.

Both times it was almost empty in the restaurant and still the service was painstakingly slow.  The waitresses rarely come around, so getting a drink refill is next-to-impossible - even if you're trying to booze it up (yes, my office is pretty lax).

We waited forever for a roll and apparently she forgot because after talking with a coworker and staring at our table for like 5 minutes (while we'd been waiting for a basic hand roll for 10-15 already in an empty restaurant), she came back over and asked what we ordered.  How about you carry a notebook and just write it down?  (No, there is no little paper menus to mark your choices on here.)

The actual sushi and food?  It's OK.  It's not the worst by far, but certainly not the best either.  Should you happen to partake of some, here's what I'd suggest:

Spicy tuna roll
Tiger roll
Sushi Special (with eel sauce instead of garlic ponzu)
Sweet Kiss (if you're into cream cheese)
Deep fried Philly
Spicy tuna poke
Coffee parfait

The check also took just as long.  My coworker actually got up and took our check to the waitress so she could process it and we could leave.  He came back and said she was just staring into nothing.  That's, um, special.

From the beginning they took forever to come take our order , then when the girl came she was acting flustered and like it was so hard to write on the tally sheet what we wanted . She had to go back to the bar and took 10 min to ask a question . Once our order was finally put in we waited more time . Finally our food started coming out but a lot of the appetizers (baked mussels, sushi pieces , salads) never came . When we addressed this issue we were told it was coming - it never came ! Then complaining again about a lasagna roll and hand roll not coming out they told us that it was cancelled ...we didn't cancel anything ! We argued at least for the avocado hand roll and were told the hour was up and we could only get dessert ... Mind you they count the hour from when the order is placed ... And they take forever to start and give it to the table. We asked for soy sauce and spicy mayo for the table and the owner herself told us that there was enough sauce on the sushi ...

When we were at our table, it seemed like the waitresses were really eager to take our orders. In fact, too eager to the point where I thought they were trying to get us out of there quick. We got AYCE and began ordering. Also, the price for AYCE is something like $21 EXCLUDING the nigiri. If you want nigiri you have to pay an extra $5/person. I think it's a great tactic to bring in customers with the $21 AYCE price, but it's also kind of unpleasantly surprising when you find out nigiri isn't included. No biggie though bc most sushi places are $26-28 for AYCE including Nigiri so it balances out haha.

All of the fish tasted fresh and all the rolls we had were great. I can't really remember the names but there was a lot of variety. I also enjoyed the screaming O salad, but felt that it was a little drenched in sauce. Overall the food was great!

The reason why I took 1 star off was because of the service. Whenever we told the waitress that we were still deciding, she kinda looked annoyed and pretty much ignored us thereafter. We had to flag a different waitress down when we were ready (nearly 30 minutes after the original waitress ditched us). I think the waitresses can be a bit more attentive and less annoyed if we aren't ready to order.

It's five minutes from the house and is smack-dab in the heart of suburbia without being out of touch with trends or expectations.  The atmosphere is always welcoming and casual, excellent for lunch but also nice enough for a relaxed date.  They used to play a lot of 90s pop but they've recently switched it to JPop. Honestly, if I'm there with someone I'm not really listening to the music and if I'm alone I wear headphones, so the music doesn't really make a difference to me. I've been going here for about two years now and they always stay delightfully consistent.  
Pros: 
the fish is a great quality for price point and location 
consistent 
good price, pretty much everything is on the AYCE 

Cons: 
The menu should be more detailed (the cucumber salad specifically comes with a sweet, creamy dressing that I was neither expecting nor cared for)  
Nigiri, apps, etc are all great but the rolls are unimaginative and almost all have some kind of fried or tempura component. 
 Service can be inconsistent and gets slow if it's busy at all. Also, if you can, sit at a table and not the bar; the service will be better and slightly faster.",DuFK1licsbozq9ehoY0xKA,0,1,4,92P6ojrn38DSy-6pPVYHAQ

The waiter comes to our table to tell us to write our order down on a piece of paper, we kindly tell her that we know what we want and if she can just take the order. She writes down our order and gives us attitude because it's a big order, but it's 7 of us doing AYCE. Anyways, 3 of the same rolls come out, but we only ordered two, so we kindly tell her that we ordered only two and she visibly gets upset and tells us that we are wrong. She gets her paper where she wrote the order to show us; we feel bad so we just take the roll. The owner (she told us she was the owner) comes to our table shortly after to tell us we have to eat everything or she will charge us. When we asked for spicy mayo on the side she said that the rolls already have sauces on them. As we eat, my cousin tries to ask a waitress for a refill on his tea, but she says ""hold on"" and walks away never to return. Our waitress never returns for the rest of the meal. After about half an hour passes, we notice that half of what we ordered didn't come out so we ask the owner and she says that our hour long of AYCE time is up and that we cannot eat anymore and if we want dessert. We tell her that we are still waiting on food and she says we are wrong. We tell her to look at the paper in which our waitress wrote the order, AND BEHOLD, HALF OUR ORDER NEVER CAME. She tells us that we past our hour and we cannot eat more. We literally sit there and argue with her but it's going no where. When she brings the bill, we end up splitting the bill four ways. After about 15 min of them not returning, we ask about the payment and turns out they charged the wrong amount on the cards. It takes them 30 min to do the voids and charge our cards again.

The AYCE option was $17, but that's for rolls and kitchen appetizers only. If you want nigiri as part of the package, you have to pay another $5. So really, AYCE is $22 per person. 

I asked if they had hirame and they said no. Then I asked if they had toro, to which they scoffed and said, ""This is all you can eat."" That's fine. But I have been to other AYCE places that served a limited portion of otoro or chutoro. 

Otherwise it was a pretty standard AYCE sushi experience -- friendly attentive Korean staff, hot green tea, long list of ridiculous roll options, clean facilities, went home fat and happy.

They refused to seat us for like 7 minutes and then once they did they ignored us for another 10 or so minutes. There were 2 waitresses this night, and as I stated earlier, only a handful of customers. No excuse in my opinion. They would hardly talk to us and acted as if we were an inconvenience to them while being nice to the other customers. 

The food was for the first time at this place lacking. A few of the rolls were good but they were so chinsey with the fish and avacado this time. Seriously, one of my salmon rolls, I couldn't even find a piece of salmon in the roll. Very upsetting.

4869553,2010-05-18,2,pUUgVNS5nBSoCJsBa3fDGw,"After a 2+ year vacancy following the closure of a decent restaurant, Jimmy's Cafe, and before then, the Summerlin location of Mama Jo's, FINALLY, we have another tenant in this seemingly difficult location.  The SUSHI's other location is about as far as you can get in the LV Valley, located at 95 and Horizon Ridge, so it makes sense that the Sushi would try its luck at this location in the older part of Summerlin.

My family and I visited last night (encouraged by a 50% off coupon received in the mail), and consumed quite a bit of food.  I can't say anything stood out as ""extraordinary"", but the sushi was fresh enough, and the kitchen entrees (beef teriyaki and kids' bento box) were as good as they usually are.  Maybe a little too sweet on the Teriyaki sauce.  And we were dismayed that the Short Ribs were not available.  The udon noodles were ok, too, though we had to remind our server that they were supposed to come with Tempura shrimp (so they cooked that up separately).  I ordered the Chirashi (sashimi morsels sprinkled atop a bowl of rice), and they did a good job...though I may have been the first one to order this since they opened!

My only gripe with The Sushi, I suppose, could be a reflection of my age and traditional Japanese roots (I was born in Japan, and my Mom is native Japanese).  Here in 2010, it seems like SUSHI can only be paired with drinking shots (sake or otherwise), boisterous sushi chefs, and...well...again, I show my age, but the whole Gen-X (and later) ambiance.  There was a huge 72"" screen TV airing a video of a concert (with sound volume to match) on one wall...and, back to the food, 3/4 of the menu seemed to be an attempt to come up with the latest and greatest mixture of cream-cheese, ponzu sauce, different fish roe, and jalapeno flavors....to justify roll names like ""Cocaine"" or ""Something Special #1"".  Whatever happened to traditional JAPANESE sushi...served in a more tranquil, if not quite ""Zen"" setting?

We'll be back, since this is not only the closest Sushi place to our home, but the closest restaurant to home of any kind...but for once, it would be refreshing to see a Sushi/Japanese restaurant strive for authenticity instead of trying to push every frenetic boundary as an excuse to attract the next party to its establishment.

So go ahead...call me an old fogey!  But...this may be a little telling since their Lake Mead location (corner of Rampart) is a bit removed from the ""singles"" epicenters...and dangerously close to a blanket of *real* elderly clientele (much older than me LOL)...and that's the Del Webb Sun City crowd.  I would be thrilled to see The Sushi maybe tone down the noise level and 'flash', and try for a little more subdued, quality presentation of Japanese food.

And with sushi rolls named Salmon Ass, Screaming ""O"", Ex-Girlfriend, Fat Ass, Who's Your Daddy, and Wet Dream, who wouldn't love you?

Let's see, what did I eat?  

Baked Green Mussels - This used to be a secret menu item at a restaurant in Harwood Heights, but now I see it everywhere.  However, not all places make it quite to my tasting, but the Sushi does a fine job.  Could use some masago mixed in with the mayo, just saying....

Tuna Poki - Kind of like a seaweed salad with some raw tuna cubes thrown on, topped with green onions.  I was expecting it to be Hawaiian style tuna poke, where the fish makes up the bulk of the dish, but having it this way made less full than if I ate a bowlful of tuna.

Fried Gyoza - Fried crispy, and filled with pork and chicken, this is one of my favorite appetizers to eat at any Japanese restaurant.

Shrimp tempura - Cooked perfectly, which to me is undercooked, because I love a crispy light textured batter with the soft shrimp inside the tempura shell. The sauce accompanying the shrimp was very delicately flavored.

Japanese Hot Chicken - described as fried, seasoned chicken.  It was pretty much fried, seasoned chicken.  Although, I was expecting drumettes, this was a flat piece of breast cut diagonally.  Juicy cut of meat with minimal extras.  It was good, it tasted so clean, I don't even know how to describe it.

Salmon Collar - This is the area of the fish right behind, or under (depending on how you look at it) the head of the fish.  What I love about the collar of any fish is that they have this wonderful fat content which makes it seem buttery, but instead of bad butterfat, you get wonderful Omega 3!  More taste, less guilt!  Lightly dressed with Ponzu sauce. 
  
Spicy Tuna Crunch - One of the last things I ate, it was sort of like a spicy tuna roll deep fried to a golden crisp.  

Korean Bulgogi with Rice - It was a little oily for me, but I'm a sucker for sweet tasting thinly sliced ribeye on top of rice.  This was actually the first thing I ate, and I probably should have saved it for last.  Rice is the archenemy of the all you can eater. 

I had a few pieces of the rolls, I just don't remember which ones since I didn't actually order them myself, but they were all very inventive and fresh

Other than the food, the best part of the dining experience here was the music playing in the dining room.  How else do you explain hearing country, hip hop, and Skrillex all in the same hour?

This is probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant. Also one of the longest yelp reviews I've written. Literally timed my 1 hour AYCE experience here...

First of all, I never step out of my comfort zone and switch places, but tonight I decided to give this place a try. I get there at 9:00pm, its completely empty except for a couple at the bar and 2 waitresses. I sit down and notice you only get an hour to eat for $25.95. I figured with it being empty I can eat pretty good in an hour especially if I sit at the bar.

Took them 5 min to ask me what I wanted to drink (9:05) then took my order at the same time. I ordered 5 orders of nigiri sushi (2 piece order) That's 10 pieces of sushi. I also got an order of baked green muscles. At 9:10 the couple next to me place an order for a roll and 2 min later a gentlemen comes in for a to go order. 

At 9:16 the sushi chef hands the couple an order of baked green muscles. He was not aware they were mine...I wasn't even sure he noticed I was sitting at the bar. The waitress notices and speaks to the chef in Japanese. I'm sure she told him those were mine and he made a mistake. After that the waitress comes over to me and asks if there is anything else I would like while I wait. Completely disregarding the fact that my food was given away and hadn't even apologized for it. I politely said no, I will wait for my order. She walks away. 

9:20pm The to go order is now ready with 3 boxes being carried away. Still waiting on my order. 9:23 the couple receives their roll...Wtf?? Still havent gotten my food and I ordered before all of them. 9:26 I FINALLY get my baked muscles. At 9:30 I FINALLY GET MY FIRST ORDER!! It took 30 min for my first order on a Saturday night and its EMPTY!! 

The waitress came back and asked if I wanted more...of course I did! Then she had the nerve to tell me this was my last order. I couldn't order anything else after this. I said ""You're joking right? My first order took 30 min to get to me!"" All she said was ""Yeah...sorry. I was pissed to say the least. I made my second order. 

Let me tell you my 2nd order got to me within 10 minutes!! 4 (2 piece Nigiri), a deep fried 1/2 roll, and another order of baked green muscles. Wow!! Being hungry I still ate it in 10 min and I still couldn't order anything else. I was pissed off and still hungry. Any other sushi place I can EASILY get in 3 orders or more and order more than I did at one time. This was puss poor service and I've been in customer service for over 12 years.

I recommend you go to Yama Sushi, they are fast, friendly, good atmosphere, and its only $23.95 for 2 hours of AYCE sushi!! I wish I had gone there instead.

She remembered my me every time I came in, even if it was months apart! The best customer service/ waitress I have had in years!! 

CONS-
I went here within the last week and a lot has changed!! The waitress is gone and has been replaced with someone else who was outta control!!! I have never been rushed while eating!! She had about 5 other tables (around 2 on a Saturday) and we were not on her list of people to help. I order 3 items (I had all you can eat) and was done within 10 mins, the other part of my party drink was gone.. So we were all just sitting there waiting for her to come back to the table to help us.. It took for-ever! About 13 minutes after we stared her down long enough. I ordered my regular tempura roll and omg... I dunno what happened! It was all messed up!!! It had the franks onion flakes on it.. So nasty!! 

I'm just going to stop it here and sum it up..
Was once good food but so so now..
Horrible service, NON FRIENDLY waiting for a very long time to order and wait for water refill.

If you want AYCE nigiri, it is $4 extra. I took the advice of other yelpers and ordered some tried and true favorites.  I noticed that the Utah roll that many spoke of is not listed on the menu.  It's a special order roll that is made for regulars, but they happily made it for me on my first visit and included it in the AYCE price.  They warned that it was spicy, but I didn't find it to be - maybe they made the white girl version for me, not realizing that my palate can take the heat.

I was dining alone on a Wednesday night.  The place had light, but steady customer traffic.  They made me feel very welcome.  I really don't like it when I'm dining alone and the hostess and servers make you feel alienated because you're dining alone when they can't resist the urge to comment on your solo status - just you? ohhhh, and so on.

I particularly recommend the shrimp tempura and spicy tuna hand rolls.  And they have some VERY inventive names for their dishes!!!",pzIjJ7GYJ2-l2i-wG7b51w,0,0,4,vxqNTDumGSc2wQW32g3ehQ

Okay, let's try The Sushi across the street.   Clever name, by the way (NOT)! Once we get inside we realize it's not AYCE (minus one star). 

On the plus side the server was good about refilling drinks around closing time and the sushi chefs were awesome! Fat ass cuts of salmon or whatever your pleasure. Just didn't seem to be the freshest. Good spot overall.",aGNvO5rjmeHspcpGZNOoQw,0,0,3,uMJ1hQT8CelV3pU0kIxRgQ

5674078,2012-07-15,0,pUUgVNS5nBSoCJsBa3fDGw,"I live around the corner from this place and was really excited to try it out after reading a couple of reviews. However once I got there with my girlfriend the experience I had was awful. 

First we get in and sit. Takes 5-8 minutes for the server to even think about getting drinks. We both get waters and it tastes like moldy water. After that I got the all you can eat with miso soup and ""Screaming 'O'"" and my girlfriend got the Spicy Ramen Soup as our first orders. 

When I got the miso soup it was lukewarm at best and really under seasoned. Then about 5 minutes later my girlfriend got her soup and it literally looked like water with 20 cent top ramen noodles in it with some curry powder, and tasted pretty much exactly like that. Then while she was eating I sat waiting for my order which didn't come until 20 minutes later after the waitress came to me and said ""Wait.. you ordered something didn't you...?"" and I told her yes 20 minutes ago. Needless to say I was upset especially since I got the AYCE and still got terrible service from the waitress. Before I even had a chance to say another order she stormed off. The dish was okay, decent tuna. 
Then I ordered the ""Fat Ass"" which is a fried roll with eel, crab, and tuna. It was completely over fried and all you could taste was tempura batter. 
After that I ordered the ""Red Dragon"" as my last roll and it was actually very good so that made me feel better about the overall experience of the place... but it didn't last. 
For dessert I got the Green Tea ice cream and it tasted exactly like Lemon Dawn dish soap. So fun end to the meal, she gave us our check at the same time as the ice cream and didn't even come to check on us for water refills or just general ""how was the meal"" type stuff. So I looked at the bill and left it there waiting for change for another 15 minutes while the staff, minus the sushi chefs, talked with each other ignoring my girlfriend and I completely the whole time so I just put close to the amount that I had in cash and left. 

There was so much more to complain about but it really isn't worth it. If I could give this place 0 stars I would but it gets 1 star simply because that ""Red Dragon"" roll was really tasty.

Overall though this place was a total hole, the service was trash, and the food was overpriced and mediocre. I won't be coming back here ever again.",CfoB3uZ7MpEM0oPtF_5i5A,3,0,1,z9yu2W9Jlt6wqm4L19cUag

5717526,2013-06-23,0,pUUgVNS5nBSoCJsBa3fDGw,"Update:  Yelpers MUST be getting ""Naka Sushi"" confused with ""The Sushi"" when ""checking-in"".  They are both at Lake Mead/Rampart, but are across the street from each other.  This HAS to be the case, b/c THE SUSHI is immensely better in quality, service, and decor.  I have been to both and there is no comparison. 

This place is bar none THE BEST SUSHI SPOT in Las Vegas. We have tried Kabuki, Kobe, Sushi Mon, Sushi Fever, Oyshi, Goyemon, Sushi Kaya, Sushi Bomb and even the ""fine"" sushi establishment at the Wynn Hotel, just to name a few. And no one satisfies our sushi fix like THE SUSHI. What do we look for? 

1) Super fresh fish- check
2) Artfully crafted Rolls- check
3) Incredibly inviting/attentive staff- check
4) Beautiful decor- check

I equate all other sushi restaurants to ""wham bam, thank you ma'am, here's your fried rice cream-cheese fish concoction"" now give me your $25.
 
COME HERE and you will know and experience the difference. There's PRIDE in this restaurant. Something all the other spots have forgotten.

Fish was fresh enough whenever I managed to get it, though it wasn't much. Getting nigiri sushi is an extra $5. 

The tofu was sour, which it definitely shouldn't' be. Made me wonder how many other ingredients had gone bad or were sitting around for a while but were still being fed to patrons.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,1,B_4t8AB5e6ygo5mCpz-soA

It took 35 minutes 3 orders of salmon , simple easy . The whole time that I watch the sushi chefs make sushi rolls but  they were too busy showboating for the people sitting up there and taking shots with them and ignoring the orders that were coming through. You could tell that one of the cooks we are not properly trained it was asking the other chef a ton of questions every time he looked at a ticket .  That scared me because if your a sushi chef you would figure you would know your menu ..?? Every time our waitress went and ask or just went up there looking for our sushi the two gentlemen that were behind there that were showboating kept basically playing the I don't know game or did you put it in game is really frustrating to watch everybody who sat after us get food before us as were all sitting there waiting for our food keep in mind  that we had a very small group of people of 3 .  Plus the place had maybe 5 tables ..None of this was brought to the attention of the manager until I had a request to talk to manager. The worst part is she offered to buy more beer but neither one of us was drinking second they already ran our card so wasn't like they were able to refund our card for the whole thing so we basically paid  $75 for maybe  three things of food never go back again I warn you is a horrible experience there are great sushi places like across the street in the Smith's parking lot!!",qhLiqWwoc-yCuGP0KkRWoA,0,0,1,qR8_XcZShJWWnwv36upnAg

The sushi was fresh, menu was creative and the k-pop music they had playing had me bopping my head as I fed my tummy. The service was a bit slow at the start but after we ordered, they were very attentive. A few things to keep in mind when doing AYCE here- 1) your sitting time is 60 mins; 2) you can only order half orders on your last orders; and 3) desert is limited to one choice.  At $25.95 per person its still not bad for dinner. I don't recommend the oysters. I really don't know why I keep trying to give fresh oysters a chance. Honestly the only good oysters I've had have been on the strip. Since this place is about 5 mins from our house, we will probably frequenting it more than our favorite spot as its a bit farther.
