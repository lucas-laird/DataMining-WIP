502281,2010-05-15,0,5o7Fx7Iot-gLKVNegLLw-w,"Loved this place! It was our last day of our semi-crazy Vegas weekend with my brother and cousins and decided to stop off at a place to eat with no crazy lines so off the strip we went in search of a long shot. Our guess totally paid off! We ordered too much food, but it was worth it. The pupusas are filling and tastey. Shrimp cocktail was awesome! I forget what my bro and cousins had, but they all loved it. Everything we ordered was soooo good! The server was nice and jokes around with us a bit. They have a jukebox with lots of old and new music and they didn't seem to mind us singing to the songs! We didn't have a problem until my cousin thought she ordered a Salvadoran relleno de papa and instead she got a Guatemalan relleno de papa which is TOTALLY different. I don't remember if it was specified on the menu or not, but if not, then it was our mistake. Just make sure you ask them to clarify because some countries make the same things with different names or different things with same names.",esmBQQRBedHkatJLcDD3xw,1,0,5,CpykWV866UaN33qDwhmqUw
990340,2017-02-19,0,5o7Fx7Iot-gLKVNegLLw-w,"Okay, Let's straighten out the confusion. El Santaneco is NOW Antigua Guatemala. Antigua Guatemala was ""North"" of the US Post Office on Maryland Parkway across from UNLV. It now resides SOUTH of the US Post Office in the same plaza next to Stefanos. 

We were looking for La Parrilla - The Lab for gourmet burgers, which is heavily marketed outside the Antigua Guatemala restaurant. Once we got inside, there was great confusion regarding the Burger Menu. One of us ordered off of the Guatemalan menu and one ordered off of the Burger menu. The Guatemalan food was okay definitely NOT a stand out to other Guatemalan restaurants in the area. The Burger was terrible!!! Not even close to what La Parrilla - The Lab was recognized for. We ordered the Philly Burger, it consisted of a small processed frozen burger, sautéed mushrooms, Swiss cheese, raw red onions, 2 tomato slices and 4 leafs of lettuce. It's supposed to have Sautéed Peppers & Onions, Mushrooms, Cheese Whiz and most importantly STEAK!!!

I am sorry to say, we will not be back!",kK_mVKKMMUo4Rv9MCPTLMw,0,0,1,Wm6r_xjJ8tENufdMj69JQA

1970672,2011-10-02,1,5o7Fx7Iot-gLKVNegLLw-w,"Been coming here for the last few years, every so often for lunch. This place offers a mix of Mexican, Guatemalan and Salvadorian food. But I've only tried a few things over and over.. Their Pupusas! If your not familiar, Pupusas are a traditional Salvadorian dish that consists of a handmade corn tortilla and then stuffed with one or more ingredients. It llooks like a thick/stuffed white corn tortilla. If you've never had it, try it, they're great!

My usual order:

(Complimentary) Chips and Black Bean (sprinkled with a little queso) Dip.  I love black beans and they aren't that common. They come warm, creamy, a little salty. 

Revueltas Pupusa (pork, bean and cheese): The pork is grounded so it wasn't chunky,, beans were mashed, and the cheese just melted it all together like a thin spread. The pork had a nice flavor, just enough to taste it. Beans were creamy and Cheese had a mild bite. This was my favorite of all the Pupusa's I've tried here. 

Queso Y Frijol (cheese and beans): I love bean and cheese burritos, so this just made sense! 

Queso (cheese): Plain ol' cheese, Sometimes simple goes a long way!

*Pupusa's always come with 2 condiments (Curtido and Salsa Roja) that are mandatory to add with every bite. Curtido is thinly sliced cabbage, carrots and onions.. that's been pickled of some sort. Salsa Roja is a orange/red color sauce that resembles chili but it isn't spicy. it is more like a seasoned tomato sauce. My method is to pour the Curtido on top of the whole Pupusa then pour the Salsa Roja over that. SOO GOOOD!!

The staff here always seemed to be in a good mood, polite and kept a smile =D. Prices are very reasonable and they have a special on monday's and wednesdays for 99 cent Pupusas. Super deal! Place was always bumpin' the jams like reggaeton, spanish dance.. Like really loud sometimes! Never bothered me but had to throw that in! So, if you want something other than tacos or quesadillas then I say try these bad boys!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,4,2,4,1hQK2NY3ne7_1S8UCI0Mpg

2407582,2011-03-12,1,5o7Fx7Iot-gLKVNegLLw-w,"I met my wife for dinner the other day. El Santaneco is close to my work and across from her school (UNLV), so we decided to give El Santaneco a try.

I ordered the chile relleno de carne de puerco. It was pretty decent.

My wife got the pupusas with chicken and potatoes. She's a big fan of pupusas and was happy to find a convenient place serving them up. She said she's had better, but they're good enough to satisfy her craving. Unfortunately, they did not have flan which was listed on the menu and is her favorite, so that craving was unfulfilled.

We were given the requisite chips and salsa. The chips kind of seemed like half of them were store bought and half were homemade. The salsa was orangish. It was good and interesting. it reminded me of a cross between chicken broth and tomato soup.

The waitress barely spoke English and we speak minimal Spanish, but we got along okay.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,4,1,3,wbPzUUCtg88XMSifhX9KkQ

on the Guatemalan side, we ordered:
Pupusa: like a tortilla with white looking cheese on top.  Nothing special.  Was very filling...but not in a good way.  Annie said she usually gets the one with pork, but they didn't have it at this restaurant
Taquitos:  with shredded pork.  aight.
Tamale:  real chicken, with bones!  this was good.
Sopa de siete mares:  lacks flavor...I took a sip and didn't bother for more
horchata:  tasted too earthy for me.  I am used to the mexican version.  
hot maiz drink:  first few sips were good...then I got a headache...

I don't know what happened here, but maybe it's just the food that we ordered, but I don't think I will be coming back

Sat down waited for service. When I ordered a Guatemalan beer she said we don't have that. WHAT??? they had modelo. Then they had one, maybe 2 Guatemalan dishes but had a whole page of ""Mexican entrees"". The server was RUDE and ignored us. They had 2 different types of music playing at the same time and it was Mexican not Guatemalan. We drank a corona and decided NOT to eat there. We will NEVER be back and they shouldn't advertise Guatemalan. So very disappointed. I have nothing against Mexican food in fact I love it but I wanted Guatemalan food and this wasn't the place!",zD9d3HcNU-C9BLUc7GUNvg,1,0,1,80Ufgz_Y7kqG5smBeVAnzA
4127849,2016-10-20,0,5o7Fx7Iot-gLKVNegLLw-w,"Cautiously posting--it looks like this restaurant has changed its name, décor, and maybe ownership. Located just a couple doors north of the post office, across from UNLV. The name now is ""Antigua Guatemala"" and the décor inside is completely different than in the photos. The walls are dark red with poster prints of pueblo life. Posting here will have to do until I or someone gets the particulars for a new Yelp entry.

Stopped in looking for pupusas, and they still have them on the menu. I ordered two pupusas chicharron and pollo guisado. I know nothing about the authenticity of this food, but I enjoyed what I got. The pupusas had a nice crisp surface like a good fresh pizza, and the ground pork and cheese filling was flavorful.  Guisado is stew, and I received a good sized bowl with two large chunks of chicken cooked with the bones and skin, with carrots and potatoes, in a flavorful red soup so thick it was like curry.  The pupusas came with curtido (vinegary slaw with oregano) and the stew came with rice, a kind of potato salad (which included a lot of unidentified chopped vegetables), and flatbread. It was all very filling and the total price with a soda was only $16.50.",-4JDJeFS0YAYSiSvIshGLQ,1,0,4,Wj9nHvNHrT9d_c7K7uEB2g
4374294,2016-06-29,4,5o7Fx7Iot-gLKVNegLLw-w,"At first, I was really confused if I had gone to the wrong restaurant. There are no signs outside that say El Santaneco, but Restaurante Guatemalteco. It's located in between the green Beat the Bookstore and the USPS.
All the reviews are true guys, they've really got some mean pupusas here!!
Now I'm no pupusa pro, but compared to the other few pupusa restaurants I've tried around the city, these were the most stuffed and cheesiest. I ordered the cheese & beans and the cheese & potatoes. While the salsa was quite bland, the lack of taste in sauce was dully noted, as the flavor was all in the pupusas. Plus there's some Tapatio on every table. Splash that on and pile on the cutido (pickled cabbage and carrots)!
You really can't go wrong for $1.75 ($2.25 - $2.50 for meats) a pupusa. I think larger orders get free chips & salsa too, but a few pupusas really filled me up.
Bring your hunger and cash. 
Bonus that it's right across from UNLV- but that probably won't mean well for me or my pants size.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,7,5,4,-9Vlkop8tHEe0RTBgHhNcw

The pupusas here are amazing. It's across the street from UNLV so I frequent here after classes or during my gaps. The convenience of this location is great. I've never eaten anything here other than the pupusas so I can't speak for any other foods, but this place seems extremely authentic.

I have seen other reviews talking about language barriers with the staff here. I have never really had that problem, so service has never really been an issue for me.

4620557,2011-11-09,8,5o7Fx7Iot-gLKVNegLLw-w,"Pupusas! That's all I had when I went here for lunch today. Frankly, it's all I need to be a fan of this place. You'll pay $2.25-$2.50 for the ones with any sort of substance in them i.e. chicken or shrimp or fish. After just a chicken and a shrimp pupusa, I was surprisingly full.

Ignore the sign on the window that says 99c Pupusas. It's misleading. On Mondays and Wednesdays, you can get pupusas for 99c, but you have to order 10 of them. So really, it's 10 pupusas for $9.90. Maths is hard. Yes, I said maths.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,8,5,4,cvF6FDJn4sUcjeE040ikEg

I place an order over the phone for twelve of them. I was charged 23.80 for the twelve. I noticed that I was being overcharged. I spoke to the girl about the major difference in price. Asking to honor the advertised price. She said that she had to call the owner to get approval for a refund. The bottom line is that the ducking owner did not want to leave the order for $13. I asked her to give me the difference back and she refused. These people have no clue how to give customer service. I will never come here again.

5776841,2016-02-06,1,5o7Fx7Iot-gLKVNegLLw-w,"Let me echo the sentiment of other reviewers: Papusas.  Delicious, greasy, and cheesy -- filled with either cheese and beans (for the standard papusa) or with your choice of meats for the deluxe papusa.  Then you slather it with a pepper, carrot, and cabbage mixture, and then some sort of red sauce.  Divine.  

I know my boyfriend and I have ordered other things here (and they were alright), but this is the one menu item that keeps us coming back.  That, and it's proximity to UNLV, is what give the this restaurant 4 stars in my book.

As others have commented, you do need to bring cash.  Luckily there's a bank in the same parking lot if you need to leave your boyfriend at the counter and run to get cash (not that I've needed to do that or anything).

Be aware of the potential for a language barrier if you do not speak Spanish.
