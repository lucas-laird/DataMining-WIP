Our party of 6 sat down and we were promptly greeted by our waiter who pressed us for sake tastings.  I'm not a fan of sake, I try it and I hate it everytime...he was convincing, so I tried a ""taste"" and still I hated it.  The rest of our party liked it and he just brought out a bottle.  I ordered a bottle of wine to share and we went on to look at the menu.

He was oh so convincing that instead of ordering we should allow the chef to prepare us a ""tasting"" menu that would be complimentary to our tastes and desires of a sushi experience.  I was hesitant because he was pushing this ""tasting"" menu as much as a car salesman pushes a car knowing you have cash in your pocket.  It seemed slimy and creepy to me.  As a control freak I immediately had reservations, but everyone else thought it would be a good idea.

The fish was incredible, although I have no clue what came out.  It all came out so fast and the portions were so small there was literally one piece and one bite per person at the table.  Before we knew it the bill came out and the looks on the faces of the ones paying it were in shock.  Over $800 for our ""tasting"" menu with one bottle of $36 wine and one bottle of $85 sake.

My initial creep factor was right on, my stomach was empty, and my pocket was bruised.  For $800 for a party of 6 with a little over $100 worth of drinks I like to think I at least feel full at the end of my meal and at least have a buzz.  So I'm sure we will be back because of the Fun Center to drop the kiddos in, but this time I will be in control of what I order.",UjaFrJyZh9b-NtWzW-luGQ,1,0,3,l2fNrOvUYdKp72Lxgyr5zQ

The main dish, shrimp and spicy noodles was excellent: big tasty shrimp, spicy noodles with a few veggies. The two miniature lobster tacos were OK altho the delicate taste of lobster is hard to survive when thrown into a taco. The little spicy shrimp appetizer was very tasty altho obviously very high in fat content. My wife ordered a Sapporo beer and the waiter brought the 20 ounce bottle, not the smaller bottle without asking which she preferred. The waiter also upsold us to the spicy shrimp appetizer from the crab cakes. Since we didn't get the crab cakes, I don't know if this advice to spend a couple bucks more was good or not. Otherwise the service was excellent. I gave four stars because we liked two of the three dishes a lot, nice ambience and good service altho I am not sure if the waiters have instructions to upsell. Definitely not a value proposition, but an upscale, innovative restaurant.",3b5EsiTkqgdbxPXz7LfBpA,0,0,4,3CwgpGY4X_jkwJSjsX50_A

I've been here a couple times and their rolls are not only delicious but look like little works of art! The Pink Elephant (spicy crab, shrimp tempura, sweet mustard wasabi) is pricey at 16 bucks but at a place like this that's to be expected. It's one of my favorite rolls. 

The interior design of Hachi is beautiful. It's modern and intimate. There is a small bar area offset from the main dining room as well as a sushi bar overlooking the kitchen. I've only visited early in the week but it was relatively slow during dinner hours. I'm wondering if they have changed their HH or discontinued it because $6 for a beer at 5:30 doesn't seem like a deal to me. But that's just a minor detraction on an otherwise fine experience.

They don't value their patrons. Five of us went for dinner. If you want a good sushi experience try Sushi Fever.  The restaurant was not very busy. It was more than half empty on a Wednesday night.  One of us ordered a teriyaki steak and side of chicken fried rice. The others decided to have sushi and sashimi. We ordered off the the more expensive right side of the menu expecting better. The waitress was very unattentive and distracted. Miso soup was ordered and poke appetizer. The food did not come out  for almost one hour. The server from the kitchen brought out one bowl of chicken fried rice that sat on our table as a side dish 15 minutes before anything else came out. The soup came out at the same time as the entre only after asking or it. The poke was literally three small pieces of tuna the size of a thumb nail with a bunch of fried stuff covering it to make it look like more than it was. It was overed in a overly powering sweet sauce.
After waiting an inappropriate amount of time I asked a women walking by to speak to the manager. She said she was the manager. I explained how we have waited for a long time and we have yet to receive our dinner. I also complained about how one side dish is sitting on the table for 15 minutes getting cold.
She said she would find out what was going on with our sushi. The 3 rolls all came out  on one plate  was unimpressive and indistinguishable as to what anything was. No one explained what was being served just dropped and left. The manager nor the waitress ever returned to find out how our food was. Uni was also ordered and never was served. The portions, the terrible service, the presentation was extremely disappointing.  After a $184 bill I  actually had a peanut butter sandwich when I got home since there was not enough food to satisfy a normal dinner.

Given we did not have comps to use or a host to pay for our bill this time around, the food was on point and came with so many options such as dipping sauces. The kumamoto oysters set the mood right as they came with three types of dipping sauces.

1154544,2010-10-06,0,4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg,"My husband and I recently moved to Las Vegas/Summerlin area from Los Angeles and are in search of a really good sushi joint, similar to our all time hands down favorite (""Sushi Nishiya"" Glendale, CA) http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-nishi-ya-glendale 

So we tried this place, we sat at the Sushi Bar but were saddened that we were not able to order directly from the sushi chef. Instead we needed to deal with a waiter who could relay our questions to the sushi chef standing right in front of us. But whatever, again we had to address the fact that we were there for Sashimi and had no interest in rolls. We were kinda guided through the menu but it was lacking variety and when the plates came out the Sashimi slice were so thin I could practically see through them. Although the food was VERY tasty I needed to order the Chilean Sea Bass in a Miso sauce, in order to fill somewhat satisfied. So all in all, I will leave this place as a ""Special Occasion"" sushi joint and probably eat prior to going since the portions are more on the appetizer side.

First, you need to realize that this place is fantastic because you can go big on a $100+ dinner for two at a nicer Japanese joint at the Red Rock, OR you can spend less than $30 on dinner for two when you are rushing to catch a movie.

There was only one roll I tried here that I didn't like, and the name eludes me (will update review if I find it, but it was mainly because I dislike jalapenos, but the boyfriend wanted me to try it.

I love the Hachi roll, the SAM, the Little Sumpin Sumpin, and Smack rolls.  Their spider roll isn't as good as it used to be, something has changed so I might not order that in the future.  The real steal at Hachi are the hot entrees, such as the chicken yakisoba, which goes for $12-13.  A huge helping, definitely for sharing, for an awesome price.

As for cocktails, GET THE SAKETINI.  I don't care if you are a guy and don't want to sip on a bubblegum pink colored martini.  It is like candied sake, if there were such a thing, and you get a lychee fruit as garnish.  I get at least one every time.  Maybe I should start thinking about happy hour, hmmm.....

Hachi has something for everyone, even those who don't want to delve to far into the world of nigiri and other super-raw products.  This isn't really a place for families though, the atmosphere is geared toward adults, and why are you trying to drag your six year old to a sushi joint in a casino anyway is my question.

If you stay, live, drive, or work near the Red Rock, stop in some time.  You won't be disappointed.",ojKLAp858S8zv7RnoBMzqQ,2,1,5,H2elw6cvz1jHUFAEGAsBYw

Everything else was pretty solid. We shared a nice bottle of cold sake (not the 1.8L one they tried to sell us for $180) and a bunch of beers. With a few desserts, it came out to only $69/person including tax/tip. Not bad for the amount of food we ordered and drinks.

Sometimes Vegas really pays you back, this was definitely one of those times for me.

Try the tuna, it's pricey but if you're looking for a piece of fish that will melt in your mouth this is it. The manager walked by and showed us his iPad he said every day his guy in Hawaii goes to the local fish markets and sends him pictures. His sushi chef here then picks the best cuts and they are flown in fresh every day. He pointed to my plate ""that was swimming in the ocean, less than 24 hours ago"". Needless to say I was impressed.

Sometime after my third lap around the tables, this place finally caught my eye.

Looking to satisfy my craving for whiskey, I was really hoping to find some nicely aged Yamazaki but secretly hoped for Hibiki.

I reluctantly had to settle for Black Label neat and decided to wash it down with a side order of tempura.

Tempura was crisp, light and delicious.
They served an avocado tempura that was a rather half-assed attempt to try something different or a stroke of genius; considering how good it was, I'm thinking it was the later.",vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ,7,7,3,ASSkEQLrn6Xg8V6-hfeA7Q

DO NOT come here to load up on food and to  ""feel full"" unless you're good with exceeding triple digit$ for two.

As a place that wants you to pay more to get more.  Here are some items to NOT get:

-- foie gras --  I know it is a sushi place first, but I hadn't had foie gras in some time Anyhow, the presentation of the foie gras plate was nice, with seared tuna as well...  it came off as if the chef put effort in it since it is change from being another sushi plate, but I expect a little bit more of the foie gras itself.  It was good but seemed a lesser grade or maybe cooked in an oil that didn't complement it.

-- o toro (fatty tuna belly) --  Good, but not great.  Same as the foie gras above in that it kind of misses the mark even though it was good.   It seemed seared very lightly to keep in the oils--It was surprisingly bland and tough for being sold as high grade stuff.  

SAKI NOTE:  I have hit some saki here and there.  The ""Hou Hou Shou"" Saki was freakin' good.  It's a great combo of sweet, citrus-y, fragrant, without being overly so in any of those categories and it wont claw at your throat on the way down.",5n5tu-jy4wuNhCStLxhWag,0,0,3,iAXaE6pysqujVhh6jpOuMA

I've been to Hachi many times and as with many restaurants out their, they've catered to our slumbering economy by dumbing down their menu.  They now have a section in the menu that features small, tapas-type dishes for people who aren't too hungry or that on a very strict budget.

Disappointing they ran out of their popular ""Black Cod"" dish.

The portions are good sized and fairly priced for a Hotel/Casino restaurant.

If you fear never getting filled at Japanese Sushi restaurants, I'd recommend ordering their Chicken Fried Rice for $10, it's enough to help fill 2 people (or feed more), and then you won't go broke ordering so much sushi, that you're potentially faced with a huge bill and still empty stomach. 

The sushi rolls are okay, nothing spectacular, but then again, I'm not a big fan of those fancy rolls with special names and all sorts of random assortments thrown together.  I'm more of a fan of the basic sushi and sashimi where there's no sauces or blending of multiple flavors, and the quality of the fish can be tasted without distractions.

The hostesses seemed a little aloof and not very inviting, but after being seated the staff we met were very friendly and made our dining experience a pleasure. My wife and I ate here early on a Friday night with our 18-month old son (yeah, we're that obnoxious couple that brings our toddler into a fine-dining restaurant with us). A lot of places will make you feel like you're not welcome if you bring a kid with you but our waiter didn't. He was nice, knowledgeable, and provided good service all night. Both he and the sommelier made some good recommendations for food and sake.

Some of the items we tried were the ""sumpin' sumpin'"" roll, cougar roll, marijane roll, and the yellowtail sashimi. All were amazing! Everything tasted fresh and melted in our mouths. The only disappointment of the night was the pan fried chilean seabass cake, which was lacking in flavor and had the texture of a grocery store crabcake. In my opinion the food here is better than most of the japanese restaurants I've been to, with the exception of Nobu (the executive chef at Hachi trained under Nobu by the way). And better yet the price of our dinner was about a third of what we paid at places like Nobu and Yellowtail. This is a modern japanese restaurant so they do have a lot of Americanized food (rolls, etc.), so if that's a turn-off for you you may not be as impressed as I. Hachi made a great impression on me and I'll definitely be back several times.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,1,1,5,rs8kg7c7y8xCh5bY_wKY5w

Of what we had, one was borderline terrible while the other was quite tasty. Their mini ramen for 8 dollars is truly mini. One could easily devour all of the ingredients in two bites or so, if one felt the need to do so. The truffle flavor is non existent and the bowl I had was so incredibly bland I didnt want to eat anymore. After adding two shots worth of soy sauce, there was barely enough of a salt flavor to make it edible. On both value and scale, it was a miserable disappointment.

On the other hand, the 808 Fried Chicken was well textured and had a nice balanced sweet and salty flavor. If anything was wrong, it was just a tad salty but perhaps only because of the stark contrast to the ramen.

Having only sake bombs and bunny bombs for reverse happy hour seemed like a poor variety. I had just had higher hopes for this place's reverse happy hour.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,2,1,3,Yoy39r2DjMsifXT--lPeSQ

4014419,2013-12-16,0,4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg,"I've had a review for this on the backburner for a while and I guess I can finally come back to it.  Mind you, we ate at Hachi back a while ago when the Happy Hour was still in effect.  So...I think late last year.  Reason we went was because we were staying at the hotel and had a $50 food credit we could use during that time.  I thought it would be a good idea to go to Happy Hour and try a lot for a little.  It ended up being so-so.

Hachi is the Japanese/Sushi restaurant located in the Red Rock Hotel & Casino (one of my fave stay-cation places).  It really is one of only a small handful of places for sushi in that corner of the Summerlin area.  Naturally, a lot of folks end up here for their sushi fix.  You would think that Hachi would step up their game by bringing some premiere eats.  I can really only give this place an 'average' when taking in food and value.  Food is ok, value, not the greatest.  I guess it's because of the markup when you go to a restaurant in a hotel.  But for the kind of money you spend at Hachi, you could almost do a full meal at another fine dining restaurant in the Red Rock, T-Bones.  Yes it is possible, especially if you get carried away at Hachi ordering multiple signature rolls, nigiri or sashimi, and cocktails.  Watch that cash!

Back when we visited, we did the menu where there were 38 things under $8.  The wifey and I concocted an entire meal on this with our $50 food credit.  We got several tapas-sized dishes and a cocktail or two to dine on.  Bad thing is, I don't recall everything we had right now.  We had five or six different dishes, and when you consider drinks, tax, and tip, we were right above the $50 food credit mark, I paid about $65 total ($50 food credit + $15 out of pocket).  Very good for a cheap date night dinner!

Here's what I remember we did have:

-Crispy Spicy Rock Shrimp - with chipotle aioli
-Hachi BBQ Baby Back Ribs - with crispy noodles and butter lettuce
-Vegetable Tempura - including pumpkin, onion, asparagus, avocado, zucchini, broccoli, and shiitake mushroom
-LSD Roll - spicy shrimp and crab, tempura flakes, avocado, and spicy ginger mayo

The LSD Roll was kinda 'meh'.  It tasted more shrimp than anything else.  The stars of the night for us were the Crispy Spicy Rock Shrimp, and the Hachi BBQ Baby Back Ribs.  Those ribs were tasty!  Sweet, a little bit of heat, but definitely with some Asian flair.  My guess is there might have been some hoisin or ponzu in the BBQ sauce.  Cooked just right, fall off the bone but not soggy.  The shrimp were great as well with that aioli.  The chipotle in it gave it some oomph and accompanied the tender fried rock shrimp.  

Reason I remember having to do this review was because we were there recently and thought about eating at Hachi again when I noticed they got rid of their touted 38 under $8 menu.  The new menu now?  Some changes here and there, some additions, but definitely a bit heavier on the price.  Also, noticed the place just wasn't as busy as it was in the past.  Prices definitely can affect traffic, especially in this dank economy.  We ended up just eating at the food court instead.

But I'll give them this, they got some HOTTIE hostesses!  As I was with the wifey, I merely just glanced.  Glanced.  But they were hot.  Yes, hot.

We started with the mixed green salad which was crisp and cool and very nice.  We then shared a variety of rolls, including spicy tuna, pink elephant, and, my favorite, the qualude--loaded with salmon, jalapeno, and avocado.

For an entree I chose chicken yakisoba, a noodle dish.  I enjoyed it a lot but was so full from the salad and sushi that I couldn't eat much of it. My colleague next to me had the seared beef tenderloin medallion and said it was amazing. It sure looked good!  For dessert we all shared chocolate fondue.

Krystal Roll ($7) - Watermelon and mango with cucumber.  Kind of different but would not want it again.

4287041,2010-06-25,0,4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg,"First of all, this is an upscale restaurant. Their prices are high, the quality of food is high, service and knowledge is paramount. Get over it. 

Station Casinos had some kind of employee appreciation thing going on for the month of June, so you could eat at any restaurant in a Station casino for 50% off. Sweet. This is the only reason my broke ass was able to go. Two people in our party knew the Hachi staff so we got special treatment. We had two servers and two bussers. 

Hachi is the Japanese word for 8, an auspicious number in Japanese and other southeast Asian cultures. The waitstaff wears belts with a sideways eight (otherwise known as an infinity sign) buckle. 

One of the things that bugs me about this place is the decor. It's all good ... just not cohesive. Murakami's signature eyeball wall paper, a huge picture of an ambiguously Asian chick with a giant dragon tattoo (that I've seen all over the interwebs), and cherry blossom ceiling hangings. But I know that's just my nit-picky art faggotry. Onwards. 

The food is really good and they have a mega selection of sake. We had the Demon Slayer, a well-rounded sake, really good to please a party of various sake-drinkers. Their menu is a long list of sushi (temaki, nigiri, and sashimi), as well as entrees, and they do omakase. If you can spring it, there are four different choices ranging $65-120. If you can't, they also have a section of dishes for $8 and under. 

I think one of the gluttonous propensities of America is the delight of variety and at Hachi, we #$%^& capitalized on that ish. We went family style and pretty much ordered everything we wanted (prices are shown before our 50% discount): 

Salmon avocado and mango roll $11. Meh. 

Hamachi sashimi $9, 2 pc. Big pieces, very fresh, clean cut, perfect marbling (but then, I am a fat-chaser). So good with the shiso. Don't throw it away! 

Nasu dengaku $6. Broiled eggplant with miso glaze. Very good. 

Hachi vegetable fried rice $7. Decent. Filler. I think fried rice is a comfort thing. You can have it any where. Move on. 

Spicy kabocha coconut soup $5. Outstanding. Nicely balanced. I'm a sucker for coconut milk and that one bowl of soup probably had a fully day's nutritional requirement of fat. 

Tofu miso $5. Filler. (We get a lot of these flller items because half my family is vegetarian.)

Pan fried Chilean Sea Bass cake $7. This is a pass. If you want sea bass, get the Broiled Sea Bass. 

Hachi BBQ baby back ribs $ 7. 

Braised short ribs $17. 

Broiled Chilean Sea Bass $32. The highlight of the meal. Cooked t perfection, so tender and moist, marinated in miso. 

(We also got lamb chops and some kind of spicy popcorn shrimp, but I don't see it on the online menu. The spicy shrimp things were really good. Reminiscent of the Chinese honey shrimp dish.)

Each of the dishes came with carefully-crafted garnishes, like a marinated daikon cross-section or scallion shafts. The colors and architecture of the pieces were amazing. At Hachi, you get what you pay for and you pay for aesthetics. 

We didn't get these, but they have gimmicky rolls like Pakalolo and Smack. Yum, drugs. 

For dessert we got the Trio brulee $9. Green tea, ginger, and macadamia guanduja [sic?] (tasted primarily like chocolate). Pretty generous portion, comparatively. The ginger was my favorite. 

We sat in one of the two tatami rooms in the back of the deep restaurant. The tatami room has a sunken hearth. You sit on the floor, but you can dangle your legs into a pit. The room we were in had one flat screen tv with the controls mounted on the wall in the room (we watched the Lakers take the Celtics. no comment). You can close the door to keep out most of the outside noise, changing the atmosphere of the room. It was very sexy. But you can't completely seal off from everything. There's a gap between the floor and the bottom of the screen that divided our room from the other tatami room. There was a window view to the outside water and fire feature. 

They also have a sushi bar you can sit at. The restaurant is partitioned into two large sections plus the tatami rooms. 

In the end, I think our total bill was $240 with the 50% discount ($480 before the discount) before tip. It was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. (The listing of foods and our total bill does not reflect the fact that we ordered several of some of the dishes.) 

I think Hachi is one of those Japanese places that's very American or American places that's very Japanese. It does well to educate an American palate of Japanese cuisine with many compromises, how's that?

I ordered their version of fish and chips where they used tempura batter for the fish and used fancy-looking potato chips on the side. The fried food wasn't overly oily which is always a plus. It was seasoned well and the serving size was not bad. I also got this eggplant dish that was disappointing in size but made it up for the taste. My mom got this crab salad that didn't have much crab in it and the dressing was lacking pizzazz but at least it was edible and fresh. Oh! but the best thing that we ordered was this mushroom ""pasta."" When the dish arrived there was no pasta included, so my mother and I were a bit confused but didn't care enough to ask a server what's up. It was literally the best mushroom dish I've ever tasted in my life and I don't even know how to describe it!! They definitely used shiitake and that's all I can figure out. 

I'm glad we tried this place out. Now I know a place to bring my non-Asian friends to a non-traditional restaurant that actually serves delicious Japanese food.",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,1,0,4,QxhqFg8cdAUqz7EMAikoQg

Many sushi rolls, hot, and cold dishes were included in the $8 specials. My favorites were the LSD roll with shrimp, avocado, and crab was fresh and flavorful. The baby whitefish were sweet and crispy; the chili sauce was a great contrast for dipping.

The upside for this place is the atmosphere, which is nice.  If you are willing to pay up for atmosphere and like to be forced to eat very little food by way of high prices, this place may be for you.  It is not for me.

Waiter was courteous, but pushy and big on the upsell.  Under pressure and not having seen the price on the menu, we succumbed to ordering a $5 plate of edamame which was small, maybe about 20 to 30 pods.  We resisted his suggestion of mineral water.

California roll was edible but nothing special, with the usual ""krab"".

The other roll we got we didn't care for at all.  Forgot what it was called but it was one of their rolls with a wacky name.  While we generally try to be adventurous with foods, we often find that ordering sushi rolls that we are not familiar with usually turn out to be a disappointment.  Some of the rolls we often order as a safe bet, such as the caterpillar and the rainbow, were not on the menu.  

Miso soup is a la carte for $5/bowl.  We did not order any.

Chicken Yakisoba ($16) was below average, even when compared to other much less expensive restaurants.  Noodles were sticky and slightly greasy.  I wouldn't normally order this but I was very hungry and in need of some filler, and was concerned that I wouldn't otherwise get out of this place with a full stomach for under $100.

Also, my beer was brought to me and it was warm.  I sent it back and it was replaced with another brand, but I was charged full price even though it was not my desired beer, without any other compensation offered.  I didn't bother trying to argue for a free beer because I just wasn't in the mood and didn't care that much.

Order included the plate of edamame, small sashimi, 1 california roll, one other roll, and chicken yakisob.  Plus one 22-oz beer and one glass of wine.


Total for 2 people with tax and tip, less $25 off coupon, was $72.  I could eat the same thing in Sacramento in an equivalent restaurant for about $45 inclusive, without a coupon.  Shall not return.",uFoLXDuKKbM6knOiQedVzw,2,0,2,hKUcCw0VzdM9dRzQipg7dg

They convinced us to do the chef special which as I understood it is they bring you a variety of sushi and a lot of it.  The price range they quoted us was $60 to $150 per person, and we chose the $60 per person.  After waiting for food for an hour and a half, we left the restaurant.  We complained several times and no sushi ever came.  What they did bring out was non-sushi appetizers trying to hold us at bay, and in the end, I think they were trying to fill us up on non-sushi.  

The service was absolutely horrible.  Waiter would leave and not return for 30 minutes at a time, and was nowhere to be found.

This roll is made of spicy shrimp and crab, avacado,spicy ginger mayonnaise, and tempura flakes that give it a little bit of crunch.This is part of their $8.00 menu. I also had this salad on my first visit that had mango, and crab meat in it. I thought it would be a yummy combo but I wasn't crazy about the type of greens they put in the salad. I think it's called frisee' it was a little too prickly for my taste. I think it may taste better with raw spinach. It also has a weird smell to it.That would be something I would never order again. I also had the Chicken Fried Rice which was really good and it was only $9.00 for a good sized portion. On my second visit I had a steak that was topped with crab meat and tempura asparagus surrounded by a cream sauce. That was tasty because the steak was nice and juicy. I'm used to eating rice with my steak so I ordered a side of white rice with my meal. I had the Molten Chocolate Cake that came with vanilla ice cream and Shiso sauce. It was delicious !
On my second visit our waiter introduced me and my hubby to sake. We had the Wakatake which has a much milder taste then wine does. I also has a sample of their plum sake which was sweeter. I wanted to try their blueberry sake called Star Rabbit but they were out of it. It's supposed to be one of the sweetest!

I have never had fresh raw fish like this in my life. If something like this exists in Chicago then I don't know what or where it is but I need to find it NOW.

We were only sort of hungry when we decided to dine here late Friday night so we didn't order much but what we sampled was just fabulous. The best bites of food we had the entire time we were in Vegas.

I was leery of Hachi because it's located inside Red Rock Hotel and thought it would just be bad hotel food but I was totally wrong. 

We ordered the vegetable tempura and a sampler (not sure if it was a special?) of 4 types of fish, sashimi style. 

The vegetable tempura was awesome. All tempura for the most part is awesome. Their's was light and crispy with warm ponzu sauce. What I liked most about this tempura was the fact that it came with veggies that I never see in tempura on menus in Chicago. Large slice of pumpkin, avocado and shiitake mushroom. All three to die for. Avocado in tempura batter????? What??? YES PLEASE. Long green bean, onion and broccoli too, so delicious. So light and just plain yummy.

The sashimi sampler was really the show stopper though. Each type of fish came with 2 pieces. If this was in fact a special, each type of fish can be ordered individually under ""New Style Cold Plates"" on the menu. All 4 types of fish were outstanding but the two that made me almost cry out of sheer bliss were the Albacore with crispy onions and citrus and the Tuna Tataki with bacon crumble, cilantro and sweet sauce. Perfect f*cking bites of food. The fish was sliced pretty thin but each bite was so meaty and delicious, so rich and chewy (chewy in a good hearty-oh-my-god-way). I have just never ever ever had raw fish that tasted this incredibly amazing.  The Yellow Tail with Jalapeno and the 4th option (I cannot remember what it was now!!) also tasted great, no complaints what so ever, but the Tuna Tataki and the Albacore were life changing. 

If you are staying on the strip Hachi is about 20 to 30 minutes drive out of the way, but there is still a casino and bar about 20 seconds away in the hotel so you can still get trashed, gamble and eat amazing sushi all at the same time. If you love sushi as much as I do and don't live in a part of the world where you can get fresh fish flown in from Hawaii shoveled into your mouth on a daily basis then you need to make Hachi a priority so you can live a complete life and die fulfilled.",C_F1NFhKbAE9SmfHOsXgRw,1,0,5,0U8q2BHPVq58xnTnozJg3w

Mixed Greens Salad w/ Ginger Dressing - Freakishly delicious!

Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Serrano Chili Ponzu - Nicely done!

Lobster Akadashi Soup - Red Miso Soup with a hint of Lobster essence and leek.  Nice!

Various Tempura items - Shrimp was average, Japanese Eggplant had a neat flared presentation, Asparagus was tasty, French Beans were good as well, Fresh Hearts of Palm was interesting, and Avocado... Avocado Tempura?  Holy weird beards Batman... not too shabby either.

Chicken Kushiyaki Skewers with Spicy Peruvian Sauce - I was hoping for the spicy green aji sauce but it was something else... although fairly tasty nonetheless.

Wagyu Gyoza - Probably the most lux type of meat I've had in an everyday dish like Gyoza.  They were deep fried wonton style rather than the traditional pan seared and steamed, but quite scrumptious!

Chicken Yakisoba - Lots of shitake mushrooms abounded and the sauce they used was excellent.  Once of the tastier items!

Various Sushi Items:  Shima Aji Nigiri (Striped Jack) was good, Uni Nigiri was excellent.  You can always tell the quality of a place if they have good Uni.  Stinky Uni will have me running for the hills in a hurry.  Salmon Skin Handroll was good as well, but bad for my breath.  Doh!  Spicy Tuna Roll with Chili Mayo dip... nice kick to it.

We were just going to get him some prime rib at the cafe but the line was long so we decided to venture out and give Hachi a go since they looked pretty empty. 

I really loved the ultra chic look of Hachi.. You definitely don't feel like you're at Red Rock Casino anymore. I would say the prices are pretty high for a local casino joint almost strip prices. My bf decided on a chicken teriyaki plate (chicken + steamed rice) which was $22!!!.. must be some bomb chicken teriyaki right??? Ehhh he said it wasn't bad but it's definitely not the best he's ever had. It was a grilled chicken breast with teriyaki glaze on it. As I watched him eat I was thinking hmm we should come back and actually eat a meal here since the atmosphere is so nice. 

So the 2 stars is for the service. I know from working in the restaurant industry no one wants a couple where the guy just orders an entree and the girl just gets tea. But I am on a DETOX ...which I told our server from the get go and my man didn't want to be feasting without me. We just felt as though the server thought of us as a burden for being there & looked down on us.

APPETIZERS: my bf got the Kabocha Coconut soup $6 - and worth every bite. oh so good. my weight suggested the Crab salad. $8. eh. It was the least liked thing I ate that day. 

SUSHI: Ah.. the good stuff. I ordered the top 6 sampler. To this moment I dont know all of them except the LSD roll but the middle 3 were beyond delicious.

SASHIMI: Let me begin by saying I've never ordered sashimi but I pictured sushi w/out rice. I was wrong. It was slivers and I do mean very finessely cut slivers of fish. On our waiters suggestion we got a sampler. 4 bites each for $16. overrated (not b/c it was hachi but just sashimi in general. I can say with 100% honesty it tasted really good but I'd never order that again. 

DESSERT: We never saw a dessert menu but our waiter suggested a cheesecake slice or creme brulee trio which sounded heavenly. and IT WAS. one was green tea, one was chocolate and one was original i think. it was to freakin die for. we almost finished it but I decided the green tea was my fav. and left most of the chocolate one. after the calorie fest we just had... 

Hachi is a very chic restaurant. feels like they plucked it straight out of a Sex & the City HBO TV shoot and yes right out of NY city. Would I be back. yes, probably for the HH since apprently that is one hoppping place to be during HH.

I was surprised to hear her steer me away from some of my first choices, letting me know the beef short ribs just hadn't been up to par recently. Thanks!

Instead, I started with a substantial Lychee Martini that was decorated with an edible orchid blossom. I was presented with an amuse bouche of tempura duck roll which was nice but just okay. The two kumamoto oysters that followed were tight and salty, served with three dipping choices, one of which was a gorgeous tropical fruit granita thing. My next course consisted of two short skewers of beef satay served with a crunchy salad of bean sprouts and (I believe) pea tendrils or some sort of peppery micro greens. For my entree, I had three succulent, tender, seared scallops in a light lobster cream with a cold pear and apple compote and some lightly dressed micro greens. I wasn't going to do dessert, but as I've been avoiding the stuff for a few weeks, I indulged (it is Vegas, baby) in a molten chocolate tart with homemade vanilla bean ice cream.

It was our first time in this Japanese restaurant and I didnt expect anything special but high end prices that will be no different in taste compared to what I can find in Chinatown. But I'll admit the higher prices were definitely worth it and the servers were really friendly and great with reccomedations.

I ordered a ""lil sumpin sumpin"" roll which tasted really good. It contained tuna, cilantro, serano chilli, tempora flakes and spicy ginger sauce. and I also freeloaded off my friends dish but I can't remember the name of her order. Best way I can explain it is a whole small fish fried in tempura. Pretty good as well. I can't really comment on all the overall menu since i didnt order much but from the taste of the ones I did order, I'm assuming overall that all other dishes are delicious as well.

The atmosphere is upscale with good lighting and music.  However there was a certain wall decoration that stood out with a wallpaper containing cartoonish eyeballs. Just threw me off because the rest of the walls contained floral art paintings and pictures.

Ths place is a must try though especially if you're out on a date. I'm a cheap date so I'd only do this once in a while.",6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg,1,2,3,XOWBcvAOrecwDT5bASdCVA

To get to the point.. everything I ate here was very very good. And we ordered a bunch of food too. The edamame ($5) was warm and salted just right. All of the sushi (Rainbow Roll -$12, Uni -$12, Eel -$6, California $10, Spicy Tuna -$7, Salmon Avacado Mango -$10) was delicious and the spicy mayo dressing I can't get enough of. The Yellow Tail Belly ($12) and Seared Salmon Belly ($8) melts in your mouth; fatty, smooth, and flavorful. The Kushiyaki (skewers) only come with 2 small skewers and not worth ordering. The Broiled Chilean Seabass ($32) was fantastic and their speciality. It was recommended by our waiter, Chris, and it didn't disappoint. The Calamanci Pinenut Tart w/ Honey Marscapone Cream ($9) wasn't bad. A little sour for my taste, but looked great. I had so much fun eating here and would give Hachi 5 stars except that we called to make reservations and they said they were full, but when we came downstairs to get a table we were able to get one.

I wanted to sit-down and be served place for dinner before our movie started. It was our first Saturday night out in over a year without the baby so it didn't really make us very picky about what we ate. I do have to say it was nice to eat someplace that doesn't seem very family friendly for once. No screaming kids anywhere (yes, we have THAT kid.)

I decided on the tonkatsu ramen and the hubby picked the lobster tacos and hachi roll. I did feel a little tricked in ordering the edemame, it was offered to us right before we even opened the menus. Not something I would normally order when it can be cheaply made at home and taste EXACTLY the same (steamed with salt.) Ah, oh well, I learned. But we did order some french bean tempura with almonds. That was very good. Not heavily battered where you could actually taste the green beans and the 2 sauces they put on top worked well and didn't overwhelm. I needed something with a little crunch to go with my bowl of ramen, it worked.

Speaking of ramen, it was tasty. I'm not a fan of hot mustard (it seemed to be hiding in there somewhere) but overall, it hit the spot on a cold night. The pork was melt-in-my-mouth yummy. A sucker for some fatty pig, I split it with my hubby who made his yummy noises with his first taste. I would have liked the dashi (soup) to be hotter. It came separately and the server made a comment of ""be careful, it's hot"" while pouring it into the bowl, but not so much. When I get hot soups, I like them steaming so hot I always burn my tongue on the first slurp because I'm so impatient I don't know how to wait. (I don't think I'll ever learn.) 

The lobster tacos were laughably tiny. It would be the perfect serving size for the baby (if she were to eat anything besides cheese quesadillas and chicken.) The hubby's take was ""it was refreshing, but I wouldn't order it again.""  It was a good thing he decided to order a sushi roll too or he would have been highly upset if the tacos was his only meal. The sushi was good, but I didn't feel it was something so crazy good I'd go back just for it. Now those green beans on the other hand...",HG2Q5IgDp1vc-SDrFr_hMQ,1,1,3,4oFLaFvWF-Xqtct8b_JdHQ

One minute I am dodging herds of teenagers at the movie theater, and the the next minute I am whisked into a sleek, too cool for school Japanese spot with crafty cocktails and solid American-ish Japanese, and best of all, if ya stick to the 38 under $8 it won't bust your bank (let's hope the secret doesn't get out to those teenagers!).

This is probably my favorite spot to eat at Red Rock because the menu offers a diversity that is sure to please a wide variety of eaters and because I love the interior. The eyeball painting makes me smile. If you happen to be traveling in a herd, their tatami rooms in the back are incredible, especially when the weather is nice and they can open up the windows. I would host a party there in a minute. Who's coming?

As usual, I found some truly stellar items on the cheap list! Vegetarians delight because of two of my faves are all for you: the vegetable tempura platter (it includes avocado and asparagus!) and the kabocha coconut soup with roasted pumpkin seed. The soup is the love child of squash and coconut. I have also had the basic mixed green salad twice. The first time it was amazing, but the second time the ginger dressing was salty. They were kind enough to remake it with a different dressing. I would order it again regardless. My husband has enjoyed all of the sushi and fish dishes he has sampled.  

And, I would like to make a special paragraph to note that they have one of the best green tea pots in Vegas. If you like hot green tea, you absolutely must get it here. 

I will say the noodles fall a little short for me here. They simply lack some of the deep flavor of a well-seasoned wok, so I would say they are good, but not amazing. I wouldn't make a special trip for the noodles. However, for tempura, soup and salad, this would be a hard line up to beat. And, there are some tasty, creative sushi numbers.

Fortunately, that is not the case.  The sushi menu, although limited in the variety, has some very creative combinations.  The Smack roll, lobster, avocado, cream cheese, tempura shallot, teryaki sauce and deep fried was to die for.  And with large chunks of real lobster meat.  The EE roll was also delicious.  We ordered the rib small plate expecting 3-4 small riblets.  Instead we got 9 large, meaty ribs covered in a spicy teryaki based bbq sauce.

Amazing:

The Norm/expected:
--------------------------
1N.  Spicy Tuna on crispy ricecake (great presentation, tobiko, avocado, chili; ricecake was too crispy, and while tasty, I've had it better many times elsewhere)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#lsZKgmNnGTA6yz0y6oo0xQ
2N.  Shishito peppers (in a miso sauce, all mild)

Meh:

1M. Albacore Sashimi (with Crispy Onions in a CItrus Ponzu sauce; great presentation, but its more complex than it needs to be, and it hides the tuna...that's my goal for sashimi, hello!)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#KGCR_WyqmS6CdQvpjsSGwQ

----------
Everyone was super nice, BUT, everyone I spoke to was newly hired (all less than 3 months).

I eat so much rice Sumo wrestlers follow me. I ended up with this place with trepidation and to meet some friends and I have become a convert for small cube shaped rice with sushi. I ordered Shrimp tempura that came with a chili sauce on a little white plate and it was the best Tempura & sauce I ever  had, so much so, I was trying to enter the kitchen to get the recipe tor the chili sauce and the Hara Kiri security guards stopped me with drawn out samurai swords.

The tempura which uses Japanese fine panko bread crumbs and the technique of using ice cold water to get that thin coating makes the shrimp with tails so appeasing I ended up ordering five of the appetizers instead of the main course. The bartenders in the front are morose beings, the kind who only take care of their usual drunk patrons and ignore others. Next time I will bypass them and order Saki from the waitresses who are quite a friendly bunch.

We wanted to go to the Yard House, but it was pretty crowded and they told us that it would be at least a 20-minute wait. So we walked next door to Hachi and decided to try it out. 

The lighting inside the restaurant is very dim, but I did like the cherry blossom décor. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. She didn't mind answering our questions, refilled our drinks often and stopped by our table frequently to see if everything was okay. 

I honestly did not see anything that I would really enjoy from the 38 for under $8 menu, so I ordered the Seared Beef Tenderloin Medallion & Shrimp entrée. It was 3 small pieces of beef and 4 medium sized shrimp. I thought it tasted alright, but definitely nothing special. I didn't like the sweet sauce that was on the mashed potatoes. For the price of $25, the portion was very small and I wish they could have at least included a side of rice with it! My husband ordered the Boiled Chilean Sea Bass. He said it was good, but of course, for the price, the portion was small. We also shared the Molten Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert.  The cake was pretty good, but I thought the ice cream tasted funny!

Overall, I was kind of disappointed. Spent over $100 and we were still hungry at the end! For the same amount of money, we could have had a great dinner at Sen of Japan! Oh well, at least I can say that I tried this place. I doubt I'll be back, unless someone else offered to pay for it. :P",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,1,3,UkPm11JypPT3yRQ0ZjaL8Q

I suggest the beef carpaccio. They also have awesome sake flights along with pretty much whatever else you want to drink. The staff is super friendly and even though it is a more upscale looking joint, they don't make you feel uncomfortable. 

Big ups to Paul and Ryan. We have seriously come back to this place just because of them. Will be back soon.",5KzS8xgVJHOY1_L5XcraaA,1,0,5,kM1IUqyAH6RDOP-7M1m7zw
