Indeed EVERY spicy dish I have ordered at this place has been at least good, and often is great.  
Indeed I would say that this restaurant has become my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas when both cost and flavor are taken into consideration.  Don't go here if you don't like spicy food.

The service was not that great.
The restroom was dirty: it was trashed and had toilet paper all over the place.

The ""bill"" was a piece of scratch paper with a price on it. The taxes and 15% tips were already included; however, there was no handwriting, print, or any form of indication that tips and taxes were already included. My friends and I had to figure it out for ourselves.We added the cost of our plates of food, and then we questioned the waiter and the cashier about the ""bill"". Only AFTER we asked them about the bill, did they first told us that tax was included. The ""bill"" was still a lot higher than the price including tax. So I asked them again, and the waiter said finally admitted that the tips were also included. 

Also, the tips were decided by the restaurant. THEY decide how much you should pay them for their poor services. I thought that the customers are the ones who are supposed to be the ones to decide how much to tip, not the restaurant. Guess this is something new to me. 

One advice I have for the owners is to at least write on the bill somewhere that taxes and tips are already included before handing the bill out. There was NOTHING else on the bill besides numbers.

Come dine here for the food, not the service or ambience.  The walls are fairly bare, and besides a TV playing Chinese Television and movies, there isn't a lot going on aesthetically speaking.

We ordered:

Spring Rolls - Lightly crisp, packed with shredded cabbage and a nice garlic flavor.  I prefer an Americanized Egg roll with meat inside, but this wasn't too bad.  Definitely not too greasy, which is key in spring rolls.

General Tso's Chicken - Nice and sweet, this guilty pleasure item really hit the spot.  The crisp breading wasn't too heavy or greasy, and the sauce, while quite viscous, wasn't overly heavy.  

1/2 Smoked Duck - A light smokey flavor comparable to a smoked ham.  The skin was nice and crispy, and the breast meat was especially delicious.  Since duck is fattier than many other Poultry, I was alright with the pieces that had a little fat on them.  Luckily if you are not, the skin (fat) seperates without struggle, and you can just enjoy the tender meat.

Dan Dan Noodles - Rice noodles topped with crushed peanuts, Chili flakes, ground pork, and chili oil.  Nice and spicy, these noodles carried a bit of the chili oil which made them messy and greasy, but I still enjoyed them.  The flavor was quite nice, resting on the heat from the chili flakes and the salt from the peanuts.  


I wouldn't rush back here since there are so many other Chinese restaurants in the vicinity, but overall a pretty good meal, especially for the price.   All this food plus two Budweisers ended up costing about $50.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,1,1,3,2nXSjGaRBL9Ai3QiMGDPaw

After we got seated and given menus, I was a bit surprised at the condition of the tables.

We ordered a spicy noodle dish and spicy shredded potatoes.  The shredded potatoes were more expensive than Dong Ting Chun and when it was finally served the portion was considerably smaller.  The peppers they used in this dish was the standard dried red peppers which are not spicy to me although the flavor of the dish was decent.

The bowl of noodles was also much smaller and my wife who has a small appetite was able to finish it despite not even being hungry.  Absolute ripoff in portion.

White rice was also not given, I had to ask for rice.  I didn't know they would charge me for this rice.

It was honestly the worst restaurant I have ever been to. We ordered two appetizers and instead of our server telling us they were out of both, she brought us something else. We assumed it was complimentary .. our entrees come out and we ask for our appetizers, she says that what was given to us was it. We ask not to be charged for it. She claims she doesn't know English and that she will charge us... so we give up. Our entrees are not edible.. they smell like actual shit. We are the only table being sat and we wait to get our checks without eating our food. We seriously considered to dine and dash. Don't come here !!

I had the worst experience ever in this place. I went to Vegas for the holiday trip with my family. We stopped by the china town and found this place serve noodles, so we went in. Man, I should have checked the yelp review before I went!!! This place is terrible. Their food doesn't taste good at all, yet they are VERY EXPENSIVE!! Well, this is not the worst part yet.  When we had the lunch there yesterday, it was not full at all during the peak lunch time, yet they were very slow to deliver the dishes.  We complained to them that they were too slow, we were almost done with our noodles but they hadn't delivered the other fried vegetables yet. You know what, I just complained about they were too slow, the lady (probably the owner) was very rude to me saying that they were busy, shouted at me that we should just wait for them!! 

Of course I was very unhappy for that. They didn't feel sorry about that at all but being rude to me. When the bill came, they just forced to charge me 15% for the tips.  Well, I was never poor at giving tips. But their service was so bad that I didn't want to pay for that much tip, especially ""forced"" to pay that much. So I asked whether I could pay less.  Their owner came to ask me why, I explained how I felt I was treated rudely. They didn't say sorry again, but shouted and threatened us with punching the menu on the table ... 

what can I say with this place .. I won't go there again anytime I visit Vegas again, and please avoid this place if you can ...",bqWeZ_bP4pLireqMaAictQ,4,1,1,AXYe2JlvFtTdwvjBLnzfxg

The restaurant seemed to be one of the busiest places so I entered cautiously. All the tables were taken so I was seated at a table that seats 10 and later a couple and another male joined me. They all spoke Mandarin, no English like most or all of the patrons here. The one guy was just slurping away at his bowl of noodles and was in the zone.

I ordered the #1 special noodle soup with rice noodles, shrimp and chicken which was not spicy but very flavorful and I totally enjoyed. To compliment the soup I ordered Mongolian lamb and asked the waiter to not to spicy. The combination of peppers, lamb, green and white onions was delicious and I was hooked on that dish. 

If your looking for a place with nice decor don't bother coming here. The service was decent, it seemed like two waiters were covering the whole place but they were dam efficient. 

Spicy City accepts credit cards and they do add a 15% gratuity automatically which I didn't mine BC the service and food were good.",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,4,1,4,k4dBCaM4OvNxS3D0CcM3ng

4521125,2011-02-10,1,Voy_shxcm2YnHQOtfUj1KQ,"We were hoping we have an alternative to Yunnan Garden which is excellent as we also like this style of Chinese food. We sampled three of our favorite dishes from Yunnan Garden over here at Spicy CIty to make a direct comparison:

1) Tofu appetizer from the show case.
2) Pork stew noodles
3) Rice cake with pork.

What a disappointment! The Tofu doesn't have any depth of flavor. The rice cake was bland and only sprinkled with a few small pieces of pork. The Pork stew noodles didn't have much pork and the soup was MSG based (Yunnan's isn't). Price is more here probably due to the rent on Spring Mtn. Yunnan is in the low rent portion of ""Chinatown"" but they prove that with good food, people will flock to it even if you are hidden away.

Service from the single waiter wasn't too bad but the owners don't seem too friendly. High minimum for credit card usage ($25).

The hallway light to the restrooms were turned off the entire time we were there (evening). Lighting color specturm is more suited for a factory floor than a restaurant.

We wouldn't go back again!

EDIT-We recently went to a ""Spicy City"" in San Diego (5/7/11) that is part of a chain of  Spicy Cities in SoCal.

My tip for the owner of the restaurant:
Train your employee (waiter) to never say anything BAD in the menu. That time we tried to order something, the waiter just snaped off and said: ""No, don't, its BAD"".
 
I may understand the waiter/manager just tried to suggest something better for us and I appreciated it. However it could be a turn off for the customer, esp the customers who are new in town and unfamiliar with your restaurant. 

The waiter could use a lil' bit more formality when taking orders and serving the food.

If one guest on a full table were aksing for a water, that could be a clue for you to offer some drinks to other guests on the same table as well.

My friends ordered the sweet and sour spareribs and a pork chow fun. The first item was not bad, they gave nice chunks of pork that were juicy. The sauce was lacking in flavor.
