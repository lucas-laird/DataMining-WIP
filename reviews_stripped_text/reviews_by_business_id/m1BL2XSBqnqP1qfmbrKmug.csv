34769,2008-08-06,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"Okada- one of the best experiences I have ever had in Vegas, and the sole reason I have chosen to join yelp.  

My girlfriend and I were in Vegas last week celebrating our dating anniversary, and had a dinner reservation at 8:30.  I had requested a table overlooking the pond/waterfall (which, by the way, is beautiful).  We arrived a few minutes early, and headed to the bar for a cocktail.  After waiting 15 minutes, the hostess approached us and explained that our table was occupied and that they were just waiting on the party to pay their bill.  She apologized and assured us that we would be seated as soon as possible.  No big deal.  Another 15 minutes passed, and again the hostess approached us and gave us an update.  She then said, ""excuse me for being so ignorant, you must be so hungry.  i will be right back.""  she returned with a bowl of edamame.  A few minutes passed, the edamame disappeared, and we were seated at last...  at 9:07.  again, not a big deal. 

We decided to start with an order of chicken skewers from the robata grill, which is basically just a large, Japanese charcoal grill.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, and was surprisingly tasty.  My suggestion would be to  skip out on the grill, however, and go straight for the sushi.

The fish at Okada is fantastic.  If you are looking for a trendy, crazy roll-inspired restaurant, Okada is not the place for you.  My girlfriend and I eat sushi quite often, so we ordered our favorite nigiri (sake, hamachi, kampachi, toro- chu, spicy scallop) and a spicy tuna and rainbow roll to compare.  The sushi rice is perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the fish is  fresh and served at the perfect temperature.  I am Japanese, and I prefer to eat nigiri, but the spicy tuna roll was to die for.  If you can splurge a bit, get the toro chu ($20 for 2 pieces).  it literally melts in your mouth.      

After dinner, the manager brought us our check and he too apologized for the inconvenience with our reservation.  He explained to us that he was very happy that we chose to dine at Okada, and as a token of his appreciation, he paid for all of our rolls!  He then gave us his card, and said that if we ever needed anything while staying in Vegas to look him up.  And to top things off, they gave us  complimentary green tea creme brulee to celebrate our anniversary!

I can't say enough great things about our dining experience at Okada.  In a city that I have always viewed as being concerned only with the money, it was refreshing to know that places still exist that actually appreciate your business whether you are spending a lot or a little.  Ironically, one of these places can be found in the most expensive hotel on the strip- the Wynn...  and we weren't even staying there!  Needless to say, I am looking forward to going back to Vegas, this time as a guest of the Wynn.",zSmVRQgyvddw6Lj1A9S1xg,1,1,5,IAI0VGW8AYdwXxSvfo4kOQ

Okada is very underwhelming.  Hoping for a ""go to"" sushi place other than Bar Masa, which is all the way in City Center, we embarked upon Okada, only to be sorely disappointed.

For a 9:30 reservation, they had us wait at the bar until 10 when we clearly saw open tables all around us.  I think it's one of those ploys to get you to order a cocktail to (1) increase profits and (2) sedate your taste buds so you'll think their food is better than it is.

Don't get me wrong- if you're a regular Joe Schmoe looking for some tempura, a california roll, beef on a rock, and some seaweed salad (ohhh, how adventurous of you), then this will do the trick, but if you're looking for spectacular fresh sushi and innovative appetizers, don't go to Okada.

The cocktails are made with shochu, which is weaker than vodka, so you can request a substitution, but they'll upcharge you an additional $5.  Also, they sat us by the back waterfall, which is pretty to look at, but had a bit of a draft.  When I mentioned how cold it was (I was in a dress and shivering), the waitress kindly offered me a pashmina, only to disappear for 20 minutes.  By the time she came around and I could kindly remind her, we were over it and just wanted to check.

For people wanting FRESH sushi with better cocktails and better service, I suggest you truck it on over to Nobu (an oldie, but a goodie), or the new Bar Masa.",T2OAVuibC24GkHG_DZHrOA,2,0,2,-X_0sreC4y9rMRfyUex2SQ
214945,2011-10-15,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"I have to say that this was an utter disappointment. No disrespect to my friend who picked it and for others who might have enjoyed their meals, but my sister and I were expecting to fawn and drool over our food and perhaps order more if we were still hungry. But this was absolutely the worst roll i've ever had. I ordered the spicy crunch roll, and started with the bacon wrapped asparagus. The asparagus--meh. But The roll was neither spicy nor tasty. In fact, it was completely tasteless. Really good sushi can have taste even without wasabi or soy sauce. The sauces complement, don't MAKEUP for culinary incompetence. Did the cook burn his taste buds months (or years) ago? 

And our waitress basically ignored us after we received our meal. And I didn't want to embarrass my friend by vocalizing my observations and disappointment with our experience. My advice? Show up, get your table, stick to a glass of wine or a cocktail, and enjoy the view. Eat before you come or after you leave, and reserve the money you'll save for better odds at satisfaction at a table game.",ZnEWR4_OWrylcPaOLZlTNA,1,0,1,wSeYrXkumUZjS8xvr3dAoQ

284069,2011-07-11,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"The view and setting is impressive but the food is not. 

We got a table in the main dining room right next to the waterfall and lagoon. Got to admit, it sets the romantic mood. The restaurant is broken down into 5 main areas: main dining room, bar, sushi bar, robatayaki bar, and a teppanyaki room. 

Had the seared tuna, hamachi, and firecracker-spicy crunch roll. Off the robatayaki menu: waygu short ribs and farmer's vegetables. Overall, I thought the food was mediocre. The tuna and hamachi was decent but nothing special. I would skip the firecracker roll. One skewer of the waygu beef, could of been more seasoned and flavorful. The vegetables were vegetables that were prepared quite bland. The 3 ice cream dessert was also nothing distinct as well. 

Service was barely adequate. Could have been more attentive. 

When looking over this place, I was concern over the numerous reviews that were negative. Upon arriving at 8pm on a Saturday night, the place was sparse. Now, I see why. The food was bland, there wasn't a dish we really liked. To add insult to injury, paying uber prices for a mediocre dinner. In terms of quality/portion/price ratio, it didn't come close. I wanted to like this place but I don't.

I be very wary of going to dine here.",wxYE5559PuF_qR-egtGFxA,1,0,2,_EjUFVI0qg37LQi8A2YrtQ

I was disappointed that the waiter kept upselling us.  

For the food, we had the Miso Soup, Variation of Tartar and Ceviche.  For dinner, everyone ordered an entree and we split a plate of sushi (hamachi, amaebi, chu toro and o toro, sake, mirugai, spicey tuna roll, and a caterpillar roll.)  For my entree I picked the Baked Sweet Sake-Kasu Black Cod which was delicious, but very small in portion.  Perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I was very disappointed w/ pretty much everything else.  The Variation of tartare came out in these tiny small taco shell's and they were overseasoned where you couldn't taste the fish.  The Ceviche tasted very fishy and lacked any robust flavor. 

All the cuts of sushi were good, but the slices of fish were very small and thing.  Along w/ that the rice was undercooked.

Overall, Okada's is pricey w/ mediocre food and hefty price for the portions.  I would recommend Nobu's in the Hard Rock or for sushi only, go to Hyakumi in the Caeser's.",HowtuagNmvlpmyI6bipVWg,0,0,3,-Ak3hdrnVbWM0xI5Ti2iew

This was fine, I actually prefer to sit at the sushi bar at these type of places. I ordered only sushi and while over all everything was good with Uni being amazing, I was surprised that they served Mirugai that wasn't very fresh, it wasn't bad it was similar quality as in a lot of places that serve it but definitely not what it should taste like. Service couldn't have been better, very attentive but they knew when to leave you alone. A lot of people say that Okada is pricey, it is but so are a lot of high end sushi restaurants as well as restaurants at the Wynn in general.

We sat at the bar, being in a hurry to see Mystere right after. 
Food is overall very good. 
We started with some seared kobe carpaccio and oyster shooters. They were both very good. Kobe carpaccio was very tender as expected, but slightly fridge-cold. Oyster shooter had the right sweetness. Quail egg was fresh, oyster was a bit strong but overall very satisfying, with some good sake.
Green tea was also excellent and came in the traditionally heavy, iron-cast tea pot.
Shared a lobster miso with the girlfriend, that was excellent! Real and generous lobster pieces were at the bottom. 
Got the sushi platter and sea-bass as main course. Sushi was good, though not as tear-bringing as the top sushi places in LA. Chef did a good job with the presentation though. Also asked for extra blue fin toro, which was excellent. Sea-bass was soft and melted in the mouth as expected.

I was staying at the Wynn so there was no difficultly getting reservations- it was also a Monday night. I informed the hostess that it was a special occasion and requested a table near the waterfall. 

When we arrived we were seated somewhat quickly, although in a non-private area, next to a large dinner party and in the center of the dining room.  I should have known at this point to get up and leave, as it took our server 10 minutes to come over to us, and he gave no apology.  I ordered all of my usual faves- salmon, unagi, albacore, etc.  And also decided to try the grilled items on skewers.  Everything was very mediocre, if not bad.  The grilled items had no flavors, no marinades- just charred meat and veggies. 

We couldn't bear to order another round, as we typically do, and still managed to rack up a $100 bill.  Note, that this price was without drinks!  It was very disappointing considering Steve Wynn has built such a terrific hotel and claims to have AAA four diamonds chefs.

I've never been so upset with my sashimi especially going to a place where they considered themselves as fine dinning and it is at the Wynn???

He stood there the entire time talking about Hawaii & never even gave us any privacy with the bill. Our server was aware that we need to be on our way to Aria for the Elvis show.  He stood there and made my friend feel uncomfortable I am sure of that.  Basically, he was trying to work hard on the tips. I am sure my friend tipped him well.

The food itself was well-prepared - I had skewers of organic chicken that were ecellent, although the portions are designed to be quite small. I think we closed the place. Definitely on my list next time I am in Vegas.",UJUwUwLicP9aUdr8ldRAag,0,0,4,XU1nVtQgSunoDZlGfnHJwg

I've been to Okada about a dozen times, a few were amazing, and a few were on the opposite side of the spectrum.  The constant issue I have with Okada is the wait staff.  There are about 2 servers who are absolutely amazing, the rest belong at Applebees.  At this type of restaurant, I don't want Applebees service.

I really dig the decor here, the openness of the dining room, and the view is wonderful.  The seating can be a bit close, a couple of times my wife and I were sat next to the waterfall and the couple next to us were sitting at the same table, as if we were together, which is not cool.  The tables were seperated by an inch, no lie. The teppanyaki area is pretty nice too, although a bit plain.

The food can be great or mediocre, just depends on the choice.  I've had great luck with dishes such as the duck salad, foie gras and eel, and the sushi/sashimi.  The steak has always been overpriced, and most of the entries seem like tapas plates.

It's a great place to take clients and friends, though you pay a premium, it is the strip and the Wynn.  Good sake choice though, again extremely overpriced.  

I would recommend that if you come here, treat the menu as a tapas bar.  Select a bunch of plates for the table and share.  The teppanyaki is actually quite a good deal, even though the chefs spoke cantonese, I won't hold that against them. ;]

It's definitely worth a shot, I'd recommend sitting at the sushi counter for better service and conversation.",z8dWMeoanQrtdn4GXbwnQA,0,0,3,oHv2acnVO_ztx221AJtHTQ

Wow.  I really can't believe how poor the majority of the experience was.  I had read a number of positive reviews about Okada, and therefore, I was looking forward to a nice dinner out with my friends.  However, the overall experience was anything but.

First, when I was making the reservation, and again when the reservation was confirmed, I was reminded to dress well and to not bring children.  I thought that both reminders were pompous and unnecessary, but thought little else of them.  Please keep in mind that I was told multiple times to remind my party that shorts and other such casual attire were not acceptable (more on this below).  Furthermore, upon arrival, a member of our party was told that he would have to remove his fedora in order to comply with the strict dress code.  Snooty, but fine.

After we were seated, in a high traffic area of the restaurant, we took to reviewing the menus.  After some time, we were eventually informed that 95% of the items on the rather pricey menu were designed to be tapas portions.  In other words, each person would most likely need to order at the very least 2 items in order to sate their appetites.  Again, an unpleasant surprise, but fine.

However, when one waiter told us that substitutions on the sushi plates would be fine and then a subsequent waiter informed us that substitutions would not be possible, we started to get rather irritated.  We had planned to order sake, but decided against giving the restaurant and the waiter the satisfaction.

Then, the waiter brought out the wrong order for my plate.  Fine.  Then, a few minutes later, the waiter finally came back to our table and took away the wrong order.  Fine.  Then, about 10 minutes later, the waiter finally brought out half of the correct order.  Half of it.  Ten minutes later.  Ten minutes might not seem like a long time, but when 5 other people are sitting around the table and staring at their plates, despite my protestations that they begin eating, 10 minutes is a RATHER long time.  And when we're on a schedule to get to a show, 10 minutes is a bothersome, long time.  Eventually, the rest of my order made it to our table, but not until everyone else had nearly finished their meals.  No apologies.  No attempt to make up for their mistake.  Nothing.

The eel was bony, the rolls were no better than average, but the foie gras was good.  My friends agreed with each other that their sushi plates had been above average, but not great.

As we were waiting for our check, I looked over and saw a man wearing shorts in the restaurant.  SHORTS.  Earlier, we had spotted one or two patrons wearing jeans, but I chalked it up to the possibility that perhaps they were fashionable jeans.  Fine.  Shorts, not fine.  Not after you're gonna beat me over the head with your dress code.

Then, the waiter took forever to come collect our check and proceeded to inform us that he would not be able to run multiple cards.  OMFG.  He eventually ran three of our cards, but gave us a hard time about it.

Overall, it was not the worst dining experience I've ever had, but it was perhaps the most disappointing.",kwDumMrsKlljbUBBaZI52g,1,1,1,zoms3NYUhT_0XjqsBh-h7w

The chef, Masa Ishizawa, does an amazing job bringing the taste of Japan to his guests. 

Okada offers teppanyaki and robata cooking, Japanese inspired creations and a wonderful assortment of classic and inventive sushi. 

Some of my favorite classic cut rolls are: California roll ($12), shrimp tempura ($12), spicy tuna ($12), caterpillar roll ($18), dragon roll ($20), and soft shell crab ($16). 

Some of my favorite side items are: miso soup ($6), edamame ($5), and shrimp and vegetable tempura ($28).

There's a great view of the waterfall at the Wynn if you sit at the right table.  Our server was really sweet and took pretty good care of us.  I went pretty light with the field greens salad and the shrimp tempura roll.  The roll was good but the salad left a little to be desired.

Walking into Okada without a reservation can be tough but the staff got us a seat at the sushi bar.  The restaurant is absolute gorgeous with a view of waterfalls and the interior being pretty slick.

We ordered a bunch of different things and let me highlight some of the things I really enjoyed.

- Tuna sashimi was amazing
- Love  the Okada roll
- Lobster miso is enormous!  It's 3 times the size of a regular miso soup with large chunks of lobster

We also ordered some other things that were ok...or items I'd never try again.  Just a warning the sushi plate has some things that I did not enjoy and that was at no fault to Okada....it was just some seriously bad texture but it was extremely fresh.  I'm not sure the items but the texture and flavour had to be similar to eating a large piece of pork fat...uncooked.

Okada has flashes of brilliance but some things were total misses, some of the items on the sushi plate and the crunchy roll did not do it for me.

1219087,2006-02-06,4,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"Hmmm, I feel obligated to give this place four stars because the food and the ambiance were so incredible.... but there were several detractors from the experience. 

The restaurant is immaculately designed, with 2 gigantic sliding glass windows that face the famous waterfall.  The whole place has a light, airy feel to it.  The wait and bar staff are attentive and efficient and they are eager to please (they should be for what they charge!).  The sake list is a little disappointing--the selection is not nearly as fabulous as what Shibuya (down the Strip at the MGM Grand) has to offer, however, we were able to make some good selections for our table. 

 And now... for the food!  The fish was so fresh, it tasted like it has been flown in from Japan that morning!  It was incredible.  On our table for the night:  salmon, fatty tuna, spanish mackerel, seared scallops, oysters, warm eggplant salad, a few specialty rolls, mushroom soup, and cucumber and seaweed salad.  Not a single bite of it was disappointing.  And, for dessert, I would highly recommend the Kambocha Pumpkin--it was fluffy and moist without being cloying and perfect to share.  

The other detractors (besides the measly sake list)?  They were:  how long it took to get seated (we had a reservation for 7 at 9:30pm and were not seated until 10:30!!!!).  Call me picky or whatever, but I think if you decide you are going to spend a ton of money on a restaurant (a little over $100/ head), you'd better be seated promptly--I don't care how ""Vegas"" the place is.   Oh, and the alarmingly expensive soju cocktails.  I imbibed on a delightful watermelon juice and soju cocktail that was a pleasant shade of pink and nearly choked on it when i discovered it was $16!!!  I almost leaned over the bar and told our kind, large-breasted bartender that Soju is not a liquor for rich people--it's a liquor made for and by poverty stricken Asians who want to get their drink on!",h4DTP-KOwt6wJGhtWu_Pqg,2,1,4,b2uHDz1i71w4duO9Z9Au5A

I've been here several times and tried probably half the items on the menu, but rarely think ""I have to come back for this"", although it's the kind of place where you usually leave satisfied.  They do their raw fish right.  I recall particularly good instances of the salmon and toro.  Perhaps one notable thing is that last time I had a rather unsavory server, but that was something of an anomaly rather than the norm.

Okada is not my favorite Japanese joint on the strip, but it's certainly one of the better ones and refreshingly casual in its dining atmosphere.  Not a bad place to go if you're unsure about your options.",zmARcxsPqv2WrQ4RhO_zww,0,0,4,W-MRAN7Ic-xmwOK5AaF9MA

Okada's has the most incredible ambiance, complete with a 95-foot waterfall, placid lagoon and a pagoda. There's a teppanyaki room, sushi bar, cocktail bar and a huge dining area. Speaking of falls, you'll need a windfall of money too. 

The sushi and entree selections are a bit on the pricey side. They have sushi rolls upwards of $45 and shrimp tempura for $28! We were not ruling out the Okada delicacy rolls, but we wanted to test the waters a bit before diving in headlong. So we started out with the standard sushi rolls for our first visit. I can definitely say that the sushi we ordered was markedly different than most sushi I've had.  With our initial success, we will venture towards the specialty rolls next time in. 

We ordered the short beef ribs appetizer, a spicy tuna roll, spicy yellowtail, shrimp tempura roll and the rainbow roll. All our rolls were spectacular! The seafood quality is top-grade and beyond compare.

The teriyaki was juicy, tender sirloin in one of the best teriyaki sauces I've had.

After dinner, the server presented my mother with a gorgeous dessert platter. A little bit of everything from sweet bean filled mochi, bite sized cakes to green tea ice cream. Happy Birthday Yuki was written on the platter with chocolate syrup.

The sushi (and I'm talking nigiri here, not the rolls that are drenched in sauce to cover up inadequate fish) was tough and chewy, except for the spicy tuna roll, which was actually pretty good. However, there is no excuse for charging over $5 for a piece of yellowtail that tastes like rubber, or salmon with a chewy, cold center. 
The robata was basically unseasoned seafood and vegetables (we didn't order red meat) that was grilled. Boring and unimaginative. Stick some shrimp on a skewer and cook it on your stove. Add some lemon juice, and save yourself $10. 
The service was completely incompetent. Our server could not even tell us how many milliliters of sake is in a carafe, nor could he offer any advice on the selection. He also brought the miso soup after we received the sushi and robata. 
Finally, I'd asked if my dining companion and I could have a table by the waterfall since it was her birthday. We were seated as far away from the waterfall as possible.

We couldn't force more than a couple of bites down our throats and left as soon as possible. 
A tiny carafe of decent, but not amazing, sake + 4 small skewers of robata + a platter of horrid sushi + 1 miso soup = about $150. Not an amount I mind paying for a decent meal. Okada missed ""decent"" by a country mile.",N55mg6GBgJppUwRChlJz1Q,1,0,1,2PpuaRyg75NI0eWoDs0k7A

2150539,2007-08-13,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"Okay, I am a huge Japanophile. I've pored over manga, watched Japanese movies, did the love stone walk and fed the crazy deer in Nara.

Naturally, I'm a huge fan of the cuisine as well. I've tried all sorts of regional cuisine - from sasamushi from the Masumoto region,  the chestnut dishes in Obuse, and the awamori of Okinawa, I've loved every lusicous bite (with the exception of natto - sorry Hokkaido... there are things that even I cannot stomach).

Needless to say, since going on a 6 week tour of Japan, I've been picky about sushi joints. So when my bf wanted to go to Okada, I was a little skeptical about how good it would be.

First of all, we'd called ahead for reservations and let them know it was for a birthday celebration so they did seat us close to the beautiful waterfall with it's large koi swimming in the pond. 

We asked for the omakase - a chef's tasting menu - which we later realised was just highlights of the current menu which is why our server was unable to tell us how much it would cost.  It is not set (meaning you will not see a list of things on the tasting menu) - so you're kind of at the chef's mercy. If you are picky about what you will or will not eat, I would highly recommend you let your server know exactly what shouldn't ever touch your lips.

The drinks - yeah, a little over the top at $14 for a cocktail. Unfortunatelly I was spoiled by my Japan trip, enough so that the only alcoholic drink I've ever enjoyed has been a grapefruit sour - freshly squeezed Japanese grapefruit with shochu. Unfortunately they were out the night I was there, but my bf's litchi cocktail was very delicious.

The selection of various sashimi/sushi/robata/cooked dishes were excellent. The tasting menu did not include o-toro (the finest fattiest tuna - the fat content is so high, it almost looks like uncooked pork) which was a bit of a disappointment. The slices of sashimi were a little on the skimpy side as well. Other than that the fish was very fresh and cut very well. The sushi was made well - perfectly artistic mounds - squeezed just right (not too tight, not too loose). The Okada roll is quite delectable as well as the sauce.

The cooked dishes were the most impressive and reminded me exactly like the izakaya back in Tokyo. The black cod with miso - a classic preparation - but delicious nonetheless.

Dessert - because it was my bf's birthday - they gave us a gift of a a millefeuille with three squares of ice cream on top - the most impressive was the banana ice cream - absolutely delectable. The other two, vanilla and chocolate were a bit ho-hum. The freshly fried donuts served with blueberry sauce and ice cream is totally American. I was hoping for something like yuzu panna cotta which has a little more Japanese flavor but hey! we were at the chef's hands.

Overall, for two people with one cocktail and two green teas to accompany dessert - the pricetag was $260. Not too unreasonable given the quality.

Okay so here's why Okada loses one star. One - the omakase, the guests should have some inkling of what's coming as well as the pricetag. Two - our food arrived at the table and we were told what the dish was - then our waiter came and reiterated the same thing. It was a little over kill. Three - there wasn't enough signature dishes (at least from the omakase) representing this place to say that this is haute Japanese cuisine.

Overall, a good solid Japanese restaurant however, I would say not the best.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,0,0,4,2SAqtAi3mZBq7DaEArUa9w

The atmosphere is upscale, yet very comfortable, as there were several families dining. The wait staff is very friendly as you would expect from a from a ""AAA Four Diamond award restaurant"" 
Okada is known to have freshest sushi in town...I wouldn't know if its THE freshest sushi, but it definitely ranks up there as one of the best  in taste, texture and overall gastronomic experience. The Hamachi with Chili Salsa and Ponzu sauce was good enough to order - Twice! Order the Seaweed and Cucumber Salad topped with the snow crab. The flavor of the crab adds flair the salad. The Mushroom salad has a rich smokey taste and was a nice change from the run of the mill Portobello mushroom that you find in most restaurants. The Foie Gras was good - not great. The pairing with the Unagi didn't do much for me. The signature Okada roll - I could've done without... tastes mostly like mayonnaise, the only plus about the it was the 2 large lobster claws that accompanied the dish. 
What set this restaurant as one of the best that Ive ever been to, was one simple gesture I witnessed - A family was dining next to us when the young daughters fell asleep at the table, without request a server placed a blanket over each of the sleeping children.

From the opulence of the glittering tree lined walkways (indoors) to the magnificent waterfall towering over outdoor patio seating shielding guests from the vulgarity of the strip, this is the place to be. 

Okada matched the casino's beauty with effortless grace. I felt like I was walking into a serene spa, with delicious cocktails and sumptuous food. 

OK enough of that and on to the food and service. 

Our server was excellent - she had a great personality and made a few jokes as we pored over the menu. I am all about lychee-tinis. Theirs is sweeter - but still exceptionally smooth - than those I usually get. Excellent. 

Edamame was brought out quickly as we decided on our main course dishes. My girlfriend and I split a nice mix of dishes: The Okada roll (sold from the photos on the restaurant's Web site), Spicy Tuna Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Special Robotaki of Foie Gras wrapped in Tenderloin, Lobster Miso finished with a trio of parfaits. Everything was delicious. 

The Lobster Miso is large enough to share and has plenty of lobster for all. 

The Foie Gras was perfectly seared and was buttery rich, wrapped in tender subtlety flavored tenderloin. It was plated with a blend of Srirracha, oil and some other sauce that gave the bites a little extra zing. There were three skewered pieces which is perfect for one, or to share with two if you order a lot of different dishes. 

Of course, the signature sushi roll the Okada Roll was excellent. Tasty lobster and asparagus topped with wasabi cream and eel sauces. To die for. 34$ for eight pieces is a bit steep, but hey you're in Vegas right? 

Spicy Tuna Roll was great but we should've ordered the soft shell crab roll instead of shrimp tempura. 

The trio parfait desserts were tasty as well. A nice variety for those like me who fare better with multiple choice. My favorite was the red bean and cake parfait, although the taste certainly is not for everyone. Other choices included Chantilly Lace which was some sort of sweet cream and custard, and a chocolate caramel which is self explanatory and absolutely delicious.

We stayed at the Wynn for a couple of nights and of course, I had to get my sushi on since the Wednesday night would be my only free night before being forced to be social with work stuff.  I made a reservation a week prior, for the bar - I noticed *a lot* of availability when I did it on their website.   With my reservation at 9:30, I was freaking starving.

Service was good, courteous and attentive - no issues whatsoever there.  I proceeded to order a small carafe of sake, some rolls, nigiri and sashimi.  The rolls were... ok.  I asked for hand rolls and still got cut rolls.   The spicy scallop... not so spicy and the yellowtail had a bit too much sesame oil drizzle on them.

The sashimi was the major disappointment and downright upsetting.  First, as beautiful as the fish was - everything was ice cold.  Cold!  Me no like cold fishies.  That being said it was still mostly pretty good, especially the Chu Toro - wow!  But then I came to my last pieces, which were the abalone - disgusting, huge disappointment - not fresh at all and I literally had to spit out my piece.  Worst thing I ever ate in a long while.

Oddly enough, dinner went by in a flash - I think I was in and out in under 45 minutes.   Don't see a reason to try this place again.  I am sure it can be quite the hot spot with Tryst next door with all the pretty 20-somethings, but I am too old for that shit.

This is also quite the pricey place (but on par with places I've been to LA & NY - except they were better).  Pretty impressive sake selection but even a small carafe of it will run you 40-50 bucks.

I was whisked away for my birthday weekend and when it came to dinner on Saturday I knew it'd be large. My lady doesn't skimp, especially around birthday times. So wherever we ended up I was positive I'd be in for a treat and Okada was definitely on the money.

Love the interior; calm, upscale, swanky kinda feel you'd expect from a top restaurant at the Wynn. Gorgeous setup, great call having windows facing the waterfall, it's hypnotizing. Love the displayed sake bottles across the wall too, just taunting me towards alcoholism. 

Food wise even though the menu was meat heavy there are a plethora of vegan options. I feel like a lot of high end restaurants are inflexible on their menu, saying ""Hey, this is our menu, take it or leave it."" But Okada gave a separate menu where they had all their vegan items listed out, and on top of that the server gave me a slew of additional options that were on the standard menu and could be altered to fit the vegan way. Lack of butter here, leaving out the bonito there. I sipped my crazy good ginger soju cocktail while perusing the menus. With the special selections and alterations I was offered there were WAY too many things for me to try which is definitely a good thing. If you have a loved one that has any other major allergen, fish/soy/wheat/etc they have a special menu for them too. Awwww, they do care.

Just a great time, the mushroom salad specifically blew me away. I swear I'd roll through again and just order 5 of those, I got it sans butter of course. Mouthwatering type of deliciousness those mushrooms.

Ended with a nice glass of VSOP and a complimentary bowl of sorbets, everything perfect. They even spelled out 'happy birthday' drizzled in chocolate around the bowl. 

Good times thanks to Okada, but more importantly of course, thanks to my lady.",fIfKT5J7OWnr_sNP7VKkAw,11,11,4,M4nvK2F5xnsBGBg50UgI0A
2591456,2008-10-24,1,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"First thing's First, a social commentary/vent on Las Vegas:

Las Vegas is truly nothing more than a pile of dirt in hell camouflaged with a LOT of make-up, re-diverted water, and reliable air-conditioning.  I say that because no matter how careful I try to be, by the time I leave Vegas, my nails are always filled with dirt as if I had been playing in a sandbox or something.

Now that I've got that out of the way:

But that aside, the Las Vegas strip is visually stimulating with a night life incomparable to anywhere in the world.   After walking thru the various hotels in the heart of the strip, Caesars, Mirage, Harrahs, Imperial Palace, and the Venetian, I decided to see what the hype was about the Wynn Resort, a hotel casino, shopping area, restaurant hub, sportsbook, exotic automobile dealership, and golf course!

I was craving Japanese so I opted to eat at Okada.  The logo is clever and is a circle with the word ka and below that da.

The interior is sophisticated, casual, dim, and oh so cool with a window less view of a waterfall surrounded by Japanese  Pine trees.

The environment is extremely social and I struck up interesting conversations with the bartender and other patrons sitting around me.  The service was perfect, the mood fun, and atmosphere stimulating for good conversation.

As for the cuisine, it was overpriced and the overhyped ginger-mojito wasn't special given that the vodka was Japanese which is a shirley templesque 10 proof.

Let's take a look at what I ate:

1.  Japanese Oysters (6) on the half shell = 5 Stars.  The flavor was only 4 stars because it was bland but if you add lemon and a dask of soy sauce, they are perfect.  That just means the chef didn't fully think it out.  The chef does season the oysters artistically with flying fish eggs, strips of red and green seaweed and some radish/lettuce like greens.

2.  10 pieces of Sashimi= 3 Stars.  Although the quality of the pieces was good, I got ripped off as the Toro sashimi was replaced with Mackeral.  The other sashimi pieces were Hamachi (Yellow tail), Salmon, Tuna, and something else that was altogether forgettable.  Basically, this is $40 of Sashimi that you'll get for $10 anywhere outside of the Vegas Strip.

3.  The Okada Roll=4 Stars.  This was a Lobster roll.  And although the raw lobster was very good, the accompanying flavor was too sweet and the sushi pieces fell apart when I tried to pick them up with my chopsticks.

4.  Foie Gras=5 Stars.  Perfectly seared and 100% French style just like in Paris.

5.  $6.00 Miso Soup=It taste like Miso Soup.  $6.00????????????

6.   Desert: Pineapple Sorbet=5 Stars excellent end of an exciting dining experience.

All in all the food was very good but the reason I give this 5 stars is because of the very cool and social atmosphere of this place.

Despite the over-the-top prices, $200+ for the above FOR ONE, I had lots of fun.  Not the best 5 star dining experience in my life (Chutney Mary's Indian Cusine in London wins that award) but definitely a memorable good time.

Given the price, this isn't the best Japanese place by any standard, but the environment is conducive to modest, social fun.",pMltyeuU4SjT6Y8YVy7HBA,1,1,5,UN4PSLYeTlLJM2sObgAqkA

After a couple of vodka on the rocks, I decided to see if I could get a seat at the sushi bar in Okada. Our first try there two years ago was a little disappointing, but I thought it was worth another shot.

I did get a seat directly in front of the sushi chef, and asked him to make me a selection of his best sushi and sashimi. First came a selection of nigiri sushi that was fresh and very well prepared, the highlight was the uni (sea urchin roe).  The tuna, toro, salmon, hamachi, ebi and octopus were very good. Next came a whitefish sashimi that was flavoured with what I think was a little yuzu juice and some bitter leaves. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. It melted in my mouth with a terrific combination of flavours.

He finished my meal with a spicy crunch roll, which was not at all too my taste. It was a shrimp tempura, and tuna with a spicy sauce rolled in rice crackers. It was a confused and uninteresting dish. 

Eating sushi in Vancouver and Victoria, I know I am spoiled by the wealth of terrific sushi ingredients and restaurants, but I had hoped for more at Okada.",15gr4utPtk0tjNdIhqVIBQ,1,0,3,krtvqQY6edA_rRJYb3ydDg

After waiting close to 45 minutes, we were finally served our first morsels of food: the shrimp appetizer and miso soup included in the meal.  Both were pretty mediocre.  About an hour after being seated, the chef finally shows up and starts cooking.  I had the sirloin but tried my friends' shrimp and lobster entrees as well.  All of the entrees were well prepared and the portions were good sized.  However, there was very little of the usual interaction between the chef and customers.  No shrimp tails being throw in a hat, etc... but I guess this is a classier joint.    We almost skipped dessert so that we could make it to Tryst on time, but miraculously the the included custard showed up quickly.  With a good bottle of sake, we spent over $100 per head.

2828573,2009-01-14,6,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"In one word...  BLISSFUL.

This restaurant was just absolutely amazing.  From start to finish.  

When we arrived, they were quite packed and we had no reservation, so we opted NOT to wait and sat at the Sushi Bar.  I highly recommend this if you are in a small group, or just 2 of you.  The experience is like none other.  Its amazing to watch them make the sushi rolls and prepare the fish for your eating pleasure.  You get the feeling that the Sushi Chef in front of you is your very own personal Chef!  And I'd like to say we had the most amazing, energetic, and comical chef at that!  He let me take his picture while he was rolling our sushi and then even took one of us (totally his idea!).

We started by ordering wine.  Of course.  :)  Then on to our sushi rolls...  

Philadelphia roll - the best Philadelphia roll I've ever had.  The salmon was fresh and so tasty, combined with the cream cheese and veggies.  OMG, sooo good.

Spicy Yellow Tail roll - this has to be one of my favorite rolls.  Had just enough spice without making it too hot & spicy to eat.  The Yellow Tail tasted freshly caught!  Melt in your mouth delicious!

and the Shrimp Tempura roll - a classic staple for me with sushi.  I'll order this roll anywhere I go, and here it was like tasting a piece of heaven!  The tempura was perfectly crunchy and the shrimp was just delectable.  The accompanying veggies were crisp and tasty.

Our neighbors sitting at the sushi bar sent us the most delicious tuna sushi, still not quite sure why, but the BF says he overheard them talking about how cute we were as a couple...  Hey, free sushi, I'll take it!  :)  Thank you guys, whoever you were!!!  It was a very nice gesture.

In between our sushi and our meal, we had their Miso Soup, which is probably the BEST Miso I've ever devoured!  The seaweed, tofu, and broth were just perfect!  And since I had a cold coming on, this really warmed the body and soul.

Continuing the meal, we then shared the Rack of Lamb entree, which was mouth-wateringly EXCELLENT.  I've never had a more perfectly seasoned and cooked rack of lamb dish.  This was just perfection.  Along with potatoes and mushrooms in the delicious sauce, this was my favorite dish of the night.

Completely stuffed, and realizing it was our last night in Vegas...  We ordered dessert!  OMG, I swear I needed to be rolled out of there!!!  For dessert, I can't for the life of me remember what it was called.  All I know it was a green paste-like dish (tasted like green tea) with this delicious raspberry gelee, and gold flakes sprinkled on top.  It was definitely heavenly - and pics are posted.  I can't believe I only photo-ed the dessert.

That I don't need it.

Red eyelashes are unique.

He'll never quite get - that I like putting on makeup. It's my artistic release ritual for the day. 

I clutched my makeup filled suitcase tightly as I got off the flight to Vegas. I couldn't have been more thrilled about the makeup fests that were going to take place that weekend. Vegas is where you bring your sparkle. Vegas requires stage-makeup. The bright lights will wash you out. Everything is too much. And supposed to be.

So that first night, when we all realized that dinner plans at Koi would cut into our makeup time before watching La Reve. We knew that we needed an alternative dinner plan pronto. We rushed over to our concierge for advice.

Probably the most on-point concierge ever, Angie asked us about our time constraints, how far we wanted to travel - and recommended grabbing a spot at the bar at Okada.

Some of the best advice we received that whole weekend.

Okada was a swank, well lit, and beautiful space. It's easily a destination spot.  As soon as we arrived, we let our waitress know we were in a rush, and she seated us right away at the bar - right in front of the sushi chef. Within a couple of seconds - we had water, our menus, and were ready to order.

We ended up ordering the spicy scallop, yellowtail, tuna, shrimp tempura and eel & cucumber rolls to share

Connie also ordered an amazingly fruity and light sparkling sake.

Everything came out quickly and each roll was fresh and perfectly made.

At the end of the night, one of the roaming managers took it upon himself to pour us the last drops of the sake into our empty glasses. Unfortunately mine overflowed onto the table. Not a big deal at all. But within a minute or two - the manager returned with a new bottle on the house.

Now that's service!

Glammed up, with delicious sushi coating my Spanxed stomach, and time to spare before the show I was glad that we didn't make a made dash over to Koi.

The posse and I made reservations 2 weeks i advance, (mostly because I'm a spaz planner like that), and upon arrival, the hostess tells us there will be a twenty minute wait....OK
Finally we are seated, order our sake, appetizers, and then our waiter leaves...I guess he didn't want to take our dinner orders? OK, slow food dining experience...our sake comes, service is extremely attentive, constantly filling our sake cups, pouring water, etc...our appetizers come, and everyone VANISHES! No joke, we waited after our appetizer plates were clearly licked clean for a busser, a server,ANYONE to come back and take our entree orders. One of our party ends up getting up, and physically grabbing a buss boy, asked him to send over our waiter....another 20 min go by...FINALLY, he appears. No apology, takes our entree orders, and vanishes...no, ""would you like another bottle of sake,"" NOTHING. Being rather annoyed at this point, and our whole table talking about the bad service, our entrees come, still no refill on the sake....we ask for our server, he NEVER comes back to our table. We finish our entrees, decide dessert at this place is not worth another hour wait, and flag down another busser, CHECK PLEASE!. We wait, and wait and wait....no check. WE decide this is too comical a situation to be pissed, so we get up, all eight of us, leave our table and walk directly to the hostess, demand to see a manager. Manager comes after another 15min wait, we explain the situation, he chastises us for ""walking out on the bill,"" we hand him a pile of cash and swear never to return. 
I'd like to clarify, we didn't try and walk out on the bill, we would have just walked straight out the front door had that been the case. We were trying to pay for our meal so we could go downstairs and enjoy our table a Tryst. Not only did the manager not apologize for our terrible service, he didn't offer to comp anything, and had a nasty attitude the whole time.

-- Amaebi:  2/5 - Pre-frozen, practically oozing, mushy and unappetizing
-- Mirugai: 4/5 - Soft!  Well pounded and tasty.  Surprisingly fresh and sweet.
-- Uni: 1/5 - WTF?  Bitter, barely solid, old.  Told them to take it back.
-- Tamago: 2/5 - Not sweet, occasionally lumpy, not their best dish for sure.
-- Shima Aji:  4/5 - Fresh, not fishy, very flavorful - pop, pop, pops in your mouth.

M:  DAMN.  That musta sucked.  Bar should comp you. 
K:  Yeah, well I was still holding out for the mini kaiseki menu.  So that arrives...
M:  ...and that must have been decent right?

M:  Ouch.  The chawanmushi made up for it right?  They usually have good stuff in there.
K:  Yeah - actually that was probably one of the highlights.  They had what I think were lobster bits in there and so that was good.
M:  And the Okonomiyake?

M:  No sauces?  At ALL?  Not even tonkatsu?
K:  Nope.  So I left most of it and went on to the roll.  It was salmon skin roll, and it wasn't bad.  Well grilled.  At least I didn't end the meal on 'suck'.

SUSHI FOR OLD RICH PEOPLE OR GIRLS WITH SUGAR DADDIES
Simply put - that's what this is.  If you look around, this isn't a Nobu crowd, despite the Nobu prices.  You have to have a money roll for this place and even black chip players might find the prices a little disconcerting with some items.  
...Note:  Contrary to my role play, this is actually the 3rd time I've been here, and this review is anecdotal of all 3 visits.  For the astute connoisseur, the Japanese dishes & sushi here is not all that remarkable considering it's in the Wynn - I'd expect more.  They get points for the sake menu for certain, but they seem to make the most of their revenue on guys with arm candy looking to impress, or business types with groups.",hU46otnbSfdU5oI0zhJGoA,4,3,3,2zbXR754crpBykurKlptjA

Other staff eventually noticed we were looking around for a while and came to ask if our waitress had appeared. Once she did return, there was no mention or apology for her disappearance, and a smooth transition back to her awkward service.

3076250,2009-10-06,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"The concept of a high-end sushi restaurant in the middle of the desert likely would be greeted with reactions ranging from skepticism to disbelief. But if any place could pull it off, it's Vegas.

Let's start with the setting - it's at The Wynn, probably my favorite casino property on the strip. You walk into an atmosphere that oozes opulence. Let's face it, all of Vegas is over the top, but the Wynn reeks of glamour and decadence without being completely tacky.

The restaurant itself is set in a relaxing, warm atmosphere with great views of the waterfall. While the decor is not stunning, it is obviously all very high-end and subdued. 

What would Vegas be without great cocktails? There's a wide selection of specialty cocktails, in the $15 range which isn't ridiculous by Vegas standards. I'm from NYC, so sadly, $15 for a drink doesn't seem that outrageous anymore. I recommend the lychee martini. They go down quite easily, and after 2 or 3 of them, you will too.

The quality of the sushi is impeccable. It's all completely clean and fresh, and practically melts in your mouth. I've been here 3 times and have yet to have anything that was short of marvelous. The albacore (white tuna) sushi is a standout for me - I called it ""the butter (or ""buttah"") of the sea.""

The service has always been outstanding as well - courteous, polite, not rushed, and informed about the choices. Our server gave us a minute long treatise on the difference between chu-toro and oh-toro - it made sense at the time, but I can't elaborate as I was already 2 martinis into my meal at that point.

I suppose the one disadvantage would be the price tag. But let's face it - if you're in Vegas, you aren't there to save money. Given the quality of the surroundings, and the unparalleled freshness of the sushi, it's well worth it. I might even go so far as to say it's my favorite sushi restaurant of all time.",X25y7-_essNIfuKoUqIxcg,0,0,5,SIAhgglzaY1nynnBwpBq5A

The setting was pretty and relaxing. There was music on but it wasn't overwhelming. The noise level never got that high so we could actually maintain a conversation throughout the meal.
The service was great. Our waitress was smiling, attentive, and made some good recommendations.
The food - We thought about going with the chef's menu but ended up trying a few things from different parts of the menu.  We started with the sashimi platter which was great. It wasn't very interesting... very common cuts of fish... but the fish was fresh and the portion sizes were generous. We also ordered the spicy tuna roll and another roll that were both good.  We ordered some of the skewers from the next portion of the menu and the chilean seabass from the hot plates. All dishes were very good. 
For dessert, we ordered some chocolate mousse dish (which was better than I thought it would be ) and the mochi ice cream which was perfect. Not too overwhelming and a nice selection of different flavors.
Obviously we had sake throughout the meal which I highly recommend and though I rarely get cocktails, I tried the strawberry martini drink they had and it was delicious... so good I actually had to order more than one.
Definitely one of the better sushi options in Vegas.",mj2wCBzx7RtoL4J2m0xu4Q,0,0,4,qNEjB9aAOZ2RAO0V8-2x6A

The problem here is that the prices are a bit out of control.  Tons of restaurants in Las Vegas that can provide food that is just as good, slightly more quantity, for a more reasonable price tag.  A group of us has a couple glasses of wine, various sashimi options, nigiri options as well, the sea bass hot plate, and a couple of the robatayaki options.  Good quality, nothing earth shattering, but too much for the limited quantity and quality that is matched by a number of other restaurants.

3134719,2011-03-10,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"I had a pretty nice meal here the last time I was in Vegas.
The sushi was good and the drinks were even better but overall, I think Okada is just a little over priced for the fare you get.

At the time that we came there were no actual tables available so my girls & I just sat at the sushi bar but this was alright. I enjoyed watching the sushi chefs make everything right in front of me plus we got our sushi ASAP since we were sitting right there. 
I'm sure the dining room is even nicer but I didn't mind the bar since I just wanted to EAT.

First I want to say that this place has the most amazing cocktail I have ever tried. If you love passion fruit, you HAVE to get the Black Rabbit. 
It is to die for. 
The best effing drink I have EVER had. This drink in itself was pretty much worth the trip to Okada. 
Seriously, like an orgasm in a glass. 
My seat was wet.

Anywhooo aside from the mind blowing drinks, the sushi was pretty good. Very fresh and truly high quality fish. We ordered the yellow-tail, a classic California roll, a soft shell crab and a spicy tuna roll, their lobster miso soup and some vegetable tempura. My favorite was by far the yellow-tail. Deliciously tender and mild flavored. It was yummy. If I had to do it over again, I would just order a bunch of that.
The soft shell crab roll on the other hand was underwhelming, it had an odd sort of flavor that  put me off. The California and spicy tuna rolls were good, but basic. I mean, if a place this fancy messed that up, I would be pretty shocked.

The service was really off though because after we had eaten ALL the sushi we ordered, our miso soup finally showed up. I had really high expectations for it too because I read a really glowing review about it but overall it was just 'meh'. I guess I just prefer my miso soup plain and simple. The lobster was just too much, especially coming at the end of the meal it was overkill. Just a little too strongly flavored with a somewhat fishy taste that was not pleasant to me

Also the vegetable tempura showed up last and it was nothing special. Very greasy, bland coating. And when I took a bite out of one piece and then dipped it into the broth, the entire vegetable fell out leaving just a sad empty fried case. Womp, womp.

All the stuff I wanted to come out before the sushi came at the end of the meal so this was kind of disappointing. It was almost impossible to order though since a waitress pretty much never showed up unless we flagged one down. Definitely a down side to sitting at the bar.

I wouldn't mind coming back to this place but would probably re-think it since there are so many other Japanese restaurants on the strip. I'm sure there are some that are a little more reasonable in price too. I WOULD come back for that Black Rabbit though. I would be happy with just that cocktail and maybe a few pieces of yellow-tail.

3146597,2011-03-07,1,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"First off, let's get the obvious out of the way- Okada is expensive, quite expensive. If you can get over that little detail, then Okada is excellent! 

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner for an amazing teppanyaki meal. The restaurant itself is beautiful; I'm in love with the entrance, as well as the water oasis outside. The teppanyaki area is beautiful as well- simple, nicely lit, very clean, and a great view of the garden/waterfall. 

We were seated at a Teppan grill where three gentlemen (businessmen to be exact) were already sitting. On a completely unrelated note, one of the first things I noticed was the giant stick, actually, block of butter laying next to the grill. Anyways, to start with, we ordered a bottle of cold sake. I don't remember which one, but my boyfriend mentioned its ridiculous markup rate (Something along the lines of a $50 bottle of sake priced at $125). Anyways, I thought the pitcher they poured the sake into to keep it cold was lovely, and I noticed that the sake glasses had the signature Wynn logo imprints (Steve Wynn really likes his last name...).

We ordered from the Teppanyaki menu, which comes w/ 

Mizuna & edamame tofu green salad- delicious, I especially enjoyed the fried sweet potato chip on top and the fresh green tofu. Perfect, refreshing way to start the meal. 

Miso soup- No complaints

Your choice of Oshinko & Jidori egg pilaf (or Wasabi ochazuke for $10 extra) or Steamed rice (or Fried rice- shrimp, chicken or beef for $10 extra). 

Wasabi Ochazuke- a baked rice ball immersed in a savory broth made from tea and topped w/ an assortment of items. A simple dish packed w/ flavor and quite refreshing to eat before the main course. I enjoyed the side of Tsukemono and Umeboshi (Japanese pickles) that came w/ the dish. 

After looking over the menu some more, I chose the Maine Lobster for my entree, and my boyfriend chose the Colorado Lamb Loin rubbed in Japanese pepper and a side order of American Kobe Beef Tenderloin. 

Showtime! Our Teppan chef arrived w/ meats & an assortment of vegetables in tow. I was feeling friendly, so we started chatting. Our Teppan chef moved to Vegas from Hawaii, and has been working at Okada since it opened (I knew from that little fact that the food would be good). His favorite place to eat in Vegas is Ichiza, he isn't on Yelp...Okay, I think that's enough chef background for now...

The chef gave us three sauce options for our entrees: Teriyaki, Wasabi cream & a sauce for seafood. 

We started w/ Rock Shrimps & Japanese Mushrooms w/ Sudachi Sauce, which was great. 

Shrimp Fried Rice- buttery, flavorful & so good. I loved how the fried rice had little nuggets of Japanese pickles in it, which actually worked, contrary to my thoughts before tasting the rice. 

Lobster- fresh from the tank, the lobster was so sweet & tender. Nothing more to say about this entree.

Lamb- tender and perfectly-cooked

Tenderloin- so tender and flavorful

By this point, we were stuffed, but we saved room for dessert (part of the Teppan course), which was a parfait of sorts made from chunks of mango & vanilla bean cream studded w/ tapioca pearls. A nice, light way to end the meal. 

Service was great, the food was delicious & the atmosphere was perfect. Overall, a memorable experience. I would come back to Okada if I get the chance.",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,4,2,5,pYjfs9jlYqen77GI_B66uQ
3161594,2009-11-25,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"Many reviews of Okada are for the sushi, but I think the restaurants real strength is in the composed dishes and the robata. I have not tried the teppan yaki, so I cannot comment on it. 

We were there Friday night for my birthday. We ordered a number of hot and cold dishes (all ""small plates"") plus some robata skewers. The best robata were the tiger prawns and the eggplant. The mushroom salad was wonderful -- very complex and subtle set of flavors. The black cod was also wonderful. We had a bottle of champagne with  dinner, and it was absolutely the right complement. 

Received free pineapple panna cottas as dessert (since it was my b-day.) Nice touch, but the panna cotta was actually too cold and firm. The only blemish in a great meal.

The dining room is beautiful (reservations a must), but the robata bar might be the most fun place to sit for a more casual meal. Service was a little slow to start, but wait staff were very engaged and excited about the food they were serving.",7hJovWYqtGrDDmIqHkN1MA,0,0,5,NEqeqof0QzRkKtMUP_-xBg

The robata grilled meats and veggies were much better then most you'd find at a yakitori.  Lightly sauced and pleasantly seasoned and charred.  Everything was melt in your mouth good.

We ordered desserts and the were out of this world good.  Something that you usually do not find at a Japanses restaurant.  We had the pineapple sashimi and and the chocolate ginger mousse.  Wow.  Order both sooooooo gooooood and sooooo big.  Yum

Though perhaps they would like to be described with classier words such as 'good quality' or 'high class', I'm not a very classy person on most accounts.

We had a large large party so we took one of the private rooms in the back.  Apparently we were eating the Chef's selection, though not the one on the menu.  

Here's one thing that boggles my mind.  How sashimi in Vegas can be more fresh than Sashimi found in west LA.  Regardless, the sashimi was quite fresh.  The lobster sashimi had a bed of gold flakes on top.  GOLD FLAKES.  So you mean I'll be crapping out gold.  Oooook. The yellowtail, uni, salmon, oyster, and toros were all fresh and fresh could be.  Perhaps the have a huge ass salt tank somewhere in the Wynn ... I must find it.  

The foie gras was also amazing.  Seared to perfection and paired delectably with bbq eel, green onions and daikon.  A pretty picture indeed. 

The wagyu sirloin melted in my mouth, and possibly dance and sung its way into my belly.  

The abalone was well complemented by the garlicky sauce and the yellow tail carpaccio came with a plate licking sauce with a nice kick at the end.  

The lobster miso had crazy large chunks of lobster, though the miso wasn't quite as potent with the flavors of fermented joy.  

The fried riced is definitely a dish I would hope the chef would take back - how do you screw up fried rice?  

For dessert, don't forget to order the green tea creme brulee.  It's got quite a nice nutty taste and velvety texture.  The mochi ice creams are also pretty delish.",pD4c0eVE0ImAgcag4w4-lA,5,4,4,3Qu8sYQnrp8_Tm9WjEzrmQ

The first thing I noticed when walking in were the hosts.  Nothing less than model-good looks will get you hired there as a hostess, not to mention, there are usually three of them to greet you.  Diversity seems to be important to them also, as there was a UN type group of white, Asian, and black hostesses.

After being seated for the Teppanyaki style dinner, we started off with very smooth sake in one of the coolest design carafes I've seen (the ice fits into the outside of the carafe).  We followed that with Toro Oh (fatty tuna), which was reasonably priced at $24 for 3 pieces.  

Depending on which chef you get that night, they may do some tricks with the onions (onion volcano) or egg (a la Tiger Woods golf trick commercial).  The food is served hot and cooked right in front of you, ready to eat.  We had the NY sirloin, which was very tender and flavorful, and my cousin had the sea bass (which I wouldn't recommend when going to a Teppanyaki style restaurant).

Instead of going for the big entree, we decided to try out different sushi and yakitori. So we had...

4) Shake
5) Maguro 
6) Oh Toro
7) Kurobuta yakitori

So then we ended the night with Mochi and the Raspberry-Lychee. And I am personally not a fan of sweets, but I must say that the Raspberry-Lychee dessert was to savor down to the very last bite. 


Although the restaurant was great, I thought they should have enforced the dress code instead of letting people wearing sandals and shorts inside even though outside was about 102 degrees. I thought it was quite rude and disrespectful.

Initially, I was totally hesitant to go here as I did not believe that it was a real Japanese restaurant. I just can't see the Wynn hosting anything that is not glamorous trash. But my friends were insistent as we had to go to Blush for an evening of super loud music and flirting with prostitute waitresses post din din. 

As we walk in, I immediately notice that the sushi bar keeps a huge distance between the chef and patron. How can I eat Omakase (chef's choice) in this way? No Japanese greeting either. No bowing. I am tempted to get my gold encrusted kendo practice sword from my Ferrari parked outside. Actually, no Japanese anywhere in sight. Of course, there are Asian waiters which is a nice pretend visual to confuse the Gai Jin. 

My spider sense tells me to leave again but alas, my friends won't hear of it. 450 dollars later, for 4 of us, and that's without really being full, we are all annoyed. Me being the most as I am in the ""I told you so"" phase of the meal. You should trust that I am a lot of fun, especially when we reach this part of the evening.

Service - Well, they took about 20 minutes to serve us or even offer a drink, then placed our sake bottle half way across the room but never bothered to come to pour it unless we flagged them down. At one point, I am sure that the table next to us was drinking it instead. In addition, they brought food that we didn't order, failed to bring food that we did and while the waitress was sort of helpful, none of the etiquette or dignity of even a low class Japanese spot was to be found anywhere. Then halfway through the meal, we were treated to a waitress switch. Try and find that in Japan where the relationship between server and patron can reach levels of the profound.

Food -
1. UNI - Fish smell and fish taste, and not the good kind. This is a huge no no. I was actually concerned about being sick after taking a bite. Almost made me wish I was at the super-overpriced Sushi Gen where at least the Uni is fresh.
2. TUNA - Rubber
3. SALMON - So So
4. IKURA - fishy
5. ROLLS - Bland, lacking in flavor

The rest was honestly not worth mentioning. Everything was rubbery, not very fresh at all or at least 2nd or 3rd grade quality. The yakitori stuff was ok, especially the meatball. Only thing that tasted decent was the Foie Gras that my friend ordered. But that wasn't even Japanese.

I sort of feel like so many people get ripped off here that they all want to say how bloody good it is to justify it to themselves or their friends. Or more likely, to show off. And when compared to PF Chang or some fake Korean sushi place, maybe it is good...um...no...it isn't. It isn't. It isn't even good enough to be an alternative to grabbing one of the fish out of the aquarium and taking a bite out of its head.

Again, a nice fake Japanese spot with a solid sounding Japanese name, and a whole slew of celebrity, social climbing momos to sit and rave on how good their disgusting seared uni cracker jack roll is! Wow. Bad bad bad. I guess when I saw the owner of American Apparel at a table nearby chomping away with one of his heroine sheek models, I should have got up and ordered a pizza to the slot machine outside.

Or for a couple 100 bucks more, I could have flown to Japan and had a fantastic meal at the airport, and a quick fling with a stewardess in one of those spacious and technologically advanced Japanese bathrooms.

Spicy popcorn rock shrimp are also AMAZING

The crowd was mixed. young people were dressed resort casual while the more mature(late 20s and up) were better dressed. 

Watermelon juice-consistent throughout the hotel. Fresh and unsweetened. 

Sashimi Platter- about 5 different types of sashimis, 2 slices of each type. fresh. price of sushi was actually better than Hyakumi at Caeser's.

Grilled Shiitake - 3 slices. tasty yummy.

Vegetable tempura- Everything was good. a generous 10 types of different veges(incl. mushrooms). batter was a little thin, but still good.

Exotic fruit sorbet- errr.. nothing exotic about it at all if you're from a tropical country. one of the sorbet flavor was really good, although i'd forgotten what flavor it was. they're basically flat squared sorbets on some cookies/bread. bread was good. the coin-liked fruits were just lame.

While making reservations, we requested a seat near the waterfall. The hostess said she would try, but couldn't promise anything. However, when we arrived at 8:30 PM, I was happy that we were able to get a table facing the waterfall--it was so pretty!

We ordered the following:

-Nigori Sake: Loved it!
-Variation of Tartares: Very good, the blue fin tuna, salmon, and hamachi in crispy taro taco was a great combination. The fish was very fresh. 
-Kobe Beef Carpaccio: Very good, the beef melted in my mouth. 
-Assorted Sashimi Platter (Toro, Salmon, Tuna, Hamachi, and Albacore): Excellent; the fish was super fresh and was of highest quality. The slices were surprisingly MASSIVE.
-Spicy Tuna: Ehh, it was ok. Not very spicy.
-Rainbow Roll: Ehh, not impressed. It was very average.

As a side note, I was really looking forward to trying their Uni, but the waitress said it was not in season?!?! Umm, that's weird, other sushi restaurants in LV seemed to have it on their menu and we had Uni just the week before.

Service was slow and not very friendly.  Our server seemed aloof the entire time. Maybe she was new?

Grub:  I wish I can comment on the sushi itself as it was nearly a year ago, but my mind still lingers on the juicy flanks of beef carpaccio seared to perfection.  We also ordered the Kobe / Wagyu beef wrapped with bacon which was equally succulent and paired it with a round of Sake.  Highly recommended!

Service:  Our waiter was decent.  Though she did nothing wrong to deserve to be reprimanded, she also did nothing more than the typical greeting you would normally receive at your local Denny's.  For a place that is rated 5 stars and charges an arm and a leg for its dishes, I guess I expected a little more effort in terms of service.   

Ambiance:  For me, it was reflective of Yamashiro's in Hollywood minus the 360 degree city view.  Encompassing elements of the Japanese garden in its interior, the restaurant was serene and well decorated.  The gigantic waterfall situated in the center of the restaurant didn't hurt either.

4258503,2010-06-06,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"AB-SO-LUTE-LY AMAZING!!   Quite possibly the best Japanese cuisine I've ever experienced!! Food so fresh and rich in taste that I considered never brushing my teeth again. But that would've been gross, so I did.  And now I'm sad. 

Had dinner here last month when the wife and I took a trip to Vegas.  A friend of ours insisted on taking us here and when the waiter handed us menus, he handed them back - instead, asking for the ""omakase"".  Omakase is Japanese for ""it's up to you"" and it usually means you let the chef prepare a custom menu for you.   My friend told the waiter to not spare anything - bring out the biggest and best of what you've got.   

Started the night off right with the Yellowtail Jalapeno Chile ($25) - thin slices of yellowtail topped with thin slices of fresh jalapeno chilies, tomatoes, cilantro and a spicy, ponzu sauce.  Effing delicious! 

Next was the Variation of Tartars ($20) - tuna, salmon, yellowtail tartar served in a crispy taro chip fried like a taco!  This was such a fun and creative way to serve the tartar.  Loved it!

Up next was the Sashimi Platter ($40) - pieces of chu toro, tuna, salmon, yellowtail and albacore arranged on a platter.  They were all delicious and VERY fresh, but the star of the platter was the CHU TORO!  Chu Toro is the medium fatty part of the tuna found near the skin of the belly and back.  It's got a great, smooth texture and a clean, almost sweet flavor.  This is like, sashimi gold.

Next, was a sushi roll that was named after the restaurant.  The ""Okada Roll"" ($38) is topped with grilled lobster and stuffed with asparagus, avocado, and yup- more lobster!  This was the most decadent sushi roll I've ever eaten.  It was also the most expensive, but come on!  There's a ton of lobster!  They even include several separate pieces of grilled lobster on the platter for you.  Yummy.

Next was the Robatayaki grill.  We were brought kebabs of Cipollini onions ($4), Zucchini ($4), Shishito Peppers ($5), and Giant Sea Scallops. They were all good, but the only thing I thought that was worth ordering next time were the scallops.   

I cant even begin to tell you how AB-SO-FREAKIN'-LUTELY EPIC the next course was.  The waiter asks us if we want to try ""Omi"".  ""What's Omi?"" we ask.  You've heard of Kobe?  Wagyu?  Japan's finest beef?  Well... Omi blows both of them out of the water.  Where as real Kobe or Wagyu can cost up to $25 per ounce, the market price for genuine Omi is $35 per ounce.  That's $560 per pound!!!   We order 5oz. of Omi ($175) and ask for it to be cooked rare.  You really don't want to overcook these fine meats - otherwise, you'll lose the fat which contributes to the flavor and texture of the steak.   When that little piece of steak came out we were all excited.  It was barely the size of my palm and yet, $175 worth of beef was in front of me.  I took my first bite...  Oh Em Eff Gee!!  Are you kidding me?!?!  It was probably the best thing I will ever put in my mouth! (sorry, honey) I'm not sure how else to describe it.  Super delicate..  bursting with natural flavor..  just..  wonderful.   If I'm ever on death row, they better honor my request for Omi. 

Our final course for the evening was the Grilled Sake Soy Chilean Sea Bass ($30) - a filet of buttery, Chilean sea bass topped with cilantro and served on a wasabi-cucumber salsa.  It was great and Chilean sea bass is probably my favorite fish to eat cooked, but let's be honest.  How does ANY dish follow up that Omi beef?!?

Service was outstanding, as was expected of a restaurant this caliber.  Okada has been awarded back-to-back AAA Four Diamond awards - the standard of excellence in the restaurant industry - and it's no wonder why. 

Pros: Food is OUTSTANDING, service was very accommodating, beautiful decor and atmosphere

So we got all the high end stuff and it was all comped.  So we got toro, foie gras, and kobe beef.  Its simply not possible to give anything less than 5 stars when you have that kind of menu.  

We sat down at the teppanyaki grill.  The kobe beef is absolutely positively the best thing I've ever eaten in my life.  For those of you who have not tried it,, it is indescribable.  It tastes like the best fattiest beef ever but the texture is really that of butter.  If you close your eyes and put a piece in your mouth you would never guess its meat.  It is unlike anything you will ever have.  The foie was just as I like it.  Kinda charred on the outside but rich and creamy on the inside.

It is.

The atmosphere is great, the service was exceptional blah blah blah wouldn't expect any less from the Wynn. Now FOOD!  We were tended to at the bar by head chef Kenzo (you know it's gonna be good when you see older, real Japanese sushi chefs at the bar). His knife work was masterful to say the least.

Highlights:
-Toro: Literally melt in your mouth fatty tuna heaven. We watched Kenzo as he carefully sliced the piece so as to avoid any stringy tendons. Perfect.
-Salmon: I usually don't like salmon nigiri or sashimi, but (as mentioned above) it was cut perfectly and the salmon was delicious, smooth and flavorful.
-Rainbow Roll: The fish was fresh, but this was nothing special. Pass and order something else.
-Toro Roll: Slices of toro and green onion complimented each other well in this perfectly executed roll. It's simple, but don't pass this up!
-Okada Roll: Not usually a fan of lobster rolls--always thought they were too sweet. However, this was an exception. The lobster was fresh, meaty, and delicately flavored. The presentation was pretty cool too. Definitely recommend.

Rolls and Sashimi 
A Sake Somalie
That is how I roll

Lets get this out of the way. Okada is a in the Wynn Hotel and Casino. On the Strip. In Las Vegas, Nevada. That means that it costs about five times more than it should. So if your not prepared for that, you should move on. But you are in Vegas, on the Strip. So you should be prepared for that. And if you are, your in for a treat. 

This place is a high class joint. Great decor and ambiance. Like most of these places in Vegas it is an interesting blend of the high rollers and the people who have no idea what they are in for that wandered in off the strip. They will soon find out that they are in for a treat. 

Okada has a Sake Somalie. A single person knowledgable in all things Sake. This has its benefits. A few quick questions and you will have a truly delicious bottle to compliment your dinner. 

The food was all fantastic. The menu has all different kinds of Japanese Cuisine. We ordered a bunch of things as a table. A few platters of sushi, a few of sashimi, some tempura and a few other things to share. That made it very easy for all of us to share and get a good variety. But if you are more of an entre guy, there is plenty of Fish and Kobe Beef to go around. 

We were in for the long haul. A couple solid hours of chow for me and the boys. After the food, I topped it off with an espresso and a Green Tea Creme Brule. Absolutely fantastic. 

Listen, in Vegas there are literally hundred of great places for a group to eat. There are probably 50 places with a similar menu. But this place gets  the nod. It was a fabulous experience and I will definitely be back.",r7eSFbrdhVLK4G15LQLWwQ,1,1,5,Weh8WwiL1TwfKg7EkLL_6Q

We ate here over Thanksgiving week with 2 other couples.  The place was chosen my someone that has eaten here before.

Once we opened the menu, the shock set in when we saw rolls priced @ $38 and above.  Unless there is black caviar or lobster (that one was about $80) on the roll, the price is a outrageous.  In hindsight, we should have walked out at that point, but again if the portions are good, then there is value. Well not here.

We spent over $150 for two, without drinks (only hot tea @$4 a glass) and walked away hungry.  Part of the issue is had we stayed with the standard rolls, then it would not have been as pricey, but isn't the whole point of eating here to get something different from the std maki rolls?

Food:
Spicy scallop hand roll $8 - excellent
Shrimp tempura roll $12 - ok, nothing special and no different from any other place
Kobe tataki $22 - In the words of the late Clara Peller: ""Where is the beef?""  You basically get a potato pancake with 4-5 tiny microscopic slivers of beef. 
Tuna tataki $24 - 5 shaved slices of tuna, thin enough that you see the plate underneath.
Short Rib $10 - One bite and its gone.  Ok, but tough to judge as there was almost nothing there

Beef Teriyaki $33 - Very well prepared, decent portion relative to the rest of the meal.  We ordered it based on seeing one of the other couples get it.  Without it, we would have starved.

Sorry, but this is one of the most overpriced restaurants I have ever eaten in my life.  I have spent the same amount and more up and down the Strip and have never been this disappointed and this hungry when leaving a restaurant.",_0L4WNYQ6f6y6pMYzJ3b9Q,0,0,3,SSjaTYj5Fi52dzKbCFTdaQ

Don't expect much from the fish. Miso black cod was over-cooked just enough to lose its soul but still hold together enough to serve. Sashimi was priced well above its quality level. And why, in god's name, would anyone pair fois gras with barbecued eel? Here's what i'd get if I was forced to go again and someone else was paying. Either the mushroom or cucumber salad. Pork short ribs from the grilled menu (definitely). And a few sushi rolls with enough ingredients to compensate for the mediocre fish. We had a spicy scallop roll and finished it.

This is definitely one of the more swanky restaurants we went to, and the clientele matched the ambiance. 

Make sure to make reservations in advance! It fills up really quickly. Luckily our concierge told us to show up and try the sushi bar. We were ushered in with no wait at all! The sushi was 4 star -- excellent, but not amazing. The stand-out was definitely the sake! Connie ordered us the ""Bubbling Bamboo,"" which was sweet sparkling goodness with that sake flava.

Lowlights:  the other dishes;  slow service.

With all the rave reviews, we had great expectations for Okada, however our experience the day after Christmas 2011 was mixed.  Some dishes were fabulous and others mediocre.  Although the wait staff were friendly and helpful, the service was a bit slow.  The sommelier had zero personality, and we weren't convinced we were getting an expert opinion -- the wine choice was only OK.

We started with the lobster miso, which had a healthy helping of lobster chunks, but was a bit lacking in character.  The robata beef was also just OK, but the robata pork, on the other hand was fantastic -- moist and falling apart in your mouth.  The tempura vegetables were, again, just OK.  They were crispy, but had a bit too much batter on them.  The dipping sauce couldn't save it -- it ended up making the batter soggy.

What I came for was the sushi and sashimi, but I was disappointed.  I order chu toro sushi, but they brought sashimi instead.  The toro was tough and salmon was flavorless.  Fortunately, the yellowtail was fantastic, but I was sad that it was the only one.

My wife ordered Sweet Miso-Marinated Black Cod, which sounds great, but fell flat for us.  It was lightly sweetened on the outside.  The fish itself was a bit too soft and wet.  It had very little flavor.

Dessert was the highlight of the meal.  We ordered a trio of the tiny delectables.  The yuzu meringue mochi was the best of the three:  stacked cylinders of tangy frozen meringue wrapped in mochi rice ribbon and playfully topped with colored rice puffs that looked like Fruity Pebbles.

The green tea crème brûlée was also very good, but not as good as other reviewers seemed to think.  The chocolate coconut candy bar was a fancy take on an Almond Joy or Mounds candy bar -- good, but lacking originality.

I really wanted to love this place, but it wasn't consistently good throughout.  For the price, I'd go elsewhere.",9ndrLPnFyFeHO9vgNwCgHg,0,0,3,p-8tp-dqnmyJUPzc8-W95g

Everyone seemed to enjoy the Kobe beef. I've tried all different sorts and the portion size was for a chihuahua. It amazes how much some places will charge an arm and give you a pinkie.
Also, the service wasn't all that great. However, the decor was impressive especially especially outside where the waterfall is.

I believe each time we ate there the bill usually came out to roughly $1,000 and over depending on the size of the group.

Definately one of the more expensive Japanese restaurants I've eaten at, but if you're used to paying up for good dining experiences, it is par for the course.

5055331,2010-03-11,3,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"Our party of four had reservations at 8pm on Thursday, March 4, 2010 here because the birthday boy wanted Japanese food and we planned on heading to Tryst after dinner.  The original plan was to make reservations for 10 on a Friday night.  Unfortunately, for parties of 8 or more, you need to go through an event planner who told us we would have to be in the ""private room"" and minimum spent was $2000.

AMBIANCE:  Okada is a lightly dimmed restaurant, not too dark, but not too much light.  You walk in to be greeted by the hostess on the right and the sushi bar a little bit further to your left.  We were seated almost immediately in a large circular booth with round table.  Three of us were to sit in the booths while one was placed on the outer portion of the table in a regular chair, an odd setup in my opinion.  The noise level was kept to a minimum so there was no problem keeping conversation to only our table. 

FOOD:
-Fresh Oysters:  I personally don't eat raw oysters, but two of my friends do.  5 small oysters came out on a half shell (2 different kinds) sitting on ice.  I will admit, the oysters actually looked delicious (which my friends said they were)

-Octopus Sushi (2 pieces):  They were good, but tasted the same as if you were at a regular Japanese restaurant.

-Grilled Oysters (2 pieces on the half shell):  They were the exact same kind as the raw oysters but cooked.  The oysters were yummy and full of flavor, although quite expensive.  I believe it was $8 for two small oysters.  

-California Roll (8 pieces I believe): Honestly, no different from eating them at a regular Japanese restaurant

-Tempura (we ordered 2 orders):  A great assortment which included 3 pieces of shrimp, bell pepper, okra, potato, yam...pretty much all the traditional pieces.  They gave each of us a dish of tempura sauce.

-Scallops with Spicy Miso Sauce (Entree):  The scallops were cooked PERFECTLY!!  Unfortunately, there were only 3 pieces of scallops (see photo) so you really had to indulge and pace yourself to keep yourself from inhaling it all at once.   Although it's a ""spicy miso"" sauce, the sauce was not spicy, but it was quite delicious and flavorful.  

ADDITIONAL INFO:  I'm allergic to fish (yeah, I know - allergic and I'm at a sushi restaurant), but my friends did order the Sashimi which were cut up in CHUNKS which were humongous.  Fois Gras, chicken teriyaki, and a fish entree was also ordered by my friends.  Portion sizes are small, so don't be surprised when you need to order additional plates (which we did).

SERVICE:  I give our waitress an A.  She was great, she was so nice!  We ordered more food as we went along and she would come by every once in a while to check and see if we wanted anything else.  As the birthday boy got up to use the bathroom, we told her that it was our friend's 30th birthday.  As he came back and before the check came, she brought out a custard dessert which said ""Happy 30th Birthday"" (see photo).

PRICING:  Overall our bill came out to about $325, not including tip, for 4 people.  This included all food plus 3 beers and a cocktail.",YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ,3,2,4,fFygE1rqHzwIxH_a0UuwgA

On the first day of our trip, we decided to walk off our lunch and take in some sights on The Strip. By the time we ended up at Bellagio to see the floral display at The Conservatory, we realized that we wouldn't make it in time for our reservations at Koi. When we returned to Palazzo, we spoke to Angie, the concierge, who did a little searching for some last minute reservations at other sushi restaurants nearby. Since we were going to catch the 9:30pm performance of Le Reve at Wynn, we were in a major time crunch. Although Okada had no reservations available, Angie suggested that we try to dine at the sushi bar, which was first come, first serve, because the sushi was excellent there. Are we glad went with her recommendation!

When we arrived at Okada, we explained to the hostess that we were in a rush, and hoped to grab a few bites at the sushi bar. Immediately, we were seated at the sushi bar and the hostess made sure to let our server know that we were in a hurry as well. Our sushi chef handed us a menu to check off our order, and minutes after we handed back our order to him, our sushi was in front of us. We ordered spicy scallop, yellowtail, tuna, shrimp tempura and eel & cucumber rolls to share. Everything was wonderfully fresh and delicious. 

We also ordered a bottle of yummy sparkling sake named ""Bubbling Bamboo,"" which was about 2 oz. each. One of the managers brought it over and served it to us. When he poured Jessica's glass, it overflowed. It was no biggie to us, but to our surprise, he brought over a second bottle on the house. It was a very nice gesture, which made our meal that much better. Everyone we encountered was absolutely unpretentious.

Had we had more time there, we would have loved to try the main dishes from their dinner menu. They looked amazing. The dining room was beautiful, and would be a perfect spot for a romantic date.

I ordered 6 ounces and they brought the beef out to me by the waterfall to allow me to check if everything was perfect. After placing it in my mouth the beef just started to melt, it's like you didn't even have to chew. They also give you 3 sauces to dip the beef in; each one brings out the flavor of the beef in its own way. I defiantly suggest you to adventure out and get a couple of ounces of this.

Drinks: They have a huge selection of sake and even a sake somollier. He was very educated and recommended some great sakes. From what I remember, the wine was pretty good too.

Atmosphere: Tough to beat. You're surrounded by walls of sake and a waterfall (believe it or not). There's just something really nice about the sound of water while you're eating. You can see what I'm talking about from the Wynn's website, but it's really cool. Nice, wide open atmosphere too.

5585311,2010-01-20,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"I REALLY enjoyed this place.  Located right above Tryst at the Wynn. 

Seldom do I come to Vegas to enjoy a nice dinner but since we were staying at The Encore we def wanted to embrace it.  We made reservations from our room the day before and got fancied up for the meal.  

We sat in a section where we could enjoy the waterfall outside which was really pretty.  It was just about dark so all the lights were twinkling. 

I was impressed by the decor, service, taste of food but most of all how QUICK they were.  It was pretty jam packed in there so we assumed that it was gonna be a long wait.  Not at all.  Granted this is Japanese food so it SHOULD be quick but you never know. 

You could have the option for dining at the sushi bar, regular dining, or the Tapenyaki (where they cook it in front of you)  We did the regular dining.  

We ordered the following: 
- Cucumber and seaweed salad (nothing special about it- probably shoulda went with the lobster miso since that sounded different) 
- Spicy Rock Shrimp (OMFG!!!!!!! The sauce is sooooo good) 
- Dragon Roll (plenty of it came) 
Grilled seadiver scalllops (very juicy)
- Green Tea Creme Brulee (a must as well) 

This place was amazing.  I would def come back again to try the other dishes here.  Perfect place to come with a date or a group of friends.  Sake bomb?  I'll do that next time ;)",MxnNT3MSGco7hQN6-pCNow,1,0,5,MJjqJybzn6dpKu1aNKYmIw

5613529,2010-08-05,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"This review is for the teppanyaki, NOT the sushi.

I booked this place for my birthday weekend in Vegas and had no idea what I was getting myself into. From what I had read,  it was a fancier version of Benihana.
This place is about 3 times more expensive than Benihana, and well worth it? ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....

There were high points and low points to the meal, and by all means if you want a teppan meal experience this is the best place. Just be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for it. 

Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty damn delicious (i ordered the Lobster with a side of Diver Scallops), but once again, $90 for a single lobster tail and another $20 for a side of scallops is pretty effin' steep.

High's : 
Atmosphere and decor; When you sit at the teppan grill table, you have two massive windows overlooking the many waterfalls surrounding the resort.
The appetizers your meal comes with were also delectable. The salad with the japanese purple potato was a nice touch.
Our chef was a heavily accented japanese man who knew what he was doing. All too often at places like this you can get stuck with someone who can't cook for sh*t.
Their sake selection is LEGIT.

Low's:
$$$$$$$$$$$$. 
Everything is extremely expensive, I mean REALLY. $90 for the lobster tail dinner.
$60 for the organic chicken dinner, etc.
The fried rice (+$10) is not up to par. In fact, the $3.50 fried rice @ Benihana is tastier, no joke. 

Although my friends and I had a great time, it should be expected from an establishment in this price range. I am all about high quality food and am willing to pay the price for it, but it is a bit beyond quality and almost to the point of being flat out ridiculous.

However,

I hear their sushi is great and decently priced ;)",xGXrXn0Wlf8hlelYs_ruCQ,0,0,3,D1Wd9AJx1h7qR01R49m5JQ

5664153,2008-07-17,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"So let Okada by my first five star.  Have I been holding out?  Well, if you're dishing them out like pancakes, when you've really got something good, then you've nowhere to go.  I guess a large part of my reviews goes toward the quality of the meal, but what caps it off for yours truly is, did I/we have a fabulous time?  

So the context is Vegas baby!  And my honey and I'd just seen the Cirque rendition of the Beatles, Love.  Still, we had a 1+ hour wait for a walk in, but what's time at the Wynn?  It was worth it bec/ we sat right in front of the waterfall all lit up :) does it get any better?

We consumed what we always order, a set of special starters, and a battery of nigiri and one or two rolls.  Now, who eats raw fish in the middle of the desert? But this is Las Vegas, and nowhere else can you get brilliant prime rib 24/7 and world class dining in a desert.  Yay for all the food people in Vegas!  The fish undoubtedly is flown in every day, hunted down in ocean ports by several maniacal buyers around the country.  The prices reflect it btw, so be prepared for sticker shock.  

So our salmon was firm and clear and buttery, the hamachi light, glistening and the scallop unbelievably sweet; it was hard not to vacuum the stuff down.  Hats off to the buyers, the chefs who sliced generous, beautiful cuts, and Chef Masa Ishizawa for holding his kitchen to amazing standards.  The serious wow factor revolved around the starters (of course), and it must have been a selection of five items, including a pacific oyster (MUST ORDER THIS), kobe beef, a shockingly light custard (rich, savory), and something involving mushrooms.  I couldn't find it on the menu, so perhaps this is a seasonal or occasional featured selection.  

Highly recommended if you like the raw stuff, easy on the sauces.  The place is gigantic and beautiful; the service a bit stiff, esp with the hostesses. There's a frightening club that opens just outside Okada, so watch out for the not-quite-so-gay-and-drunk, but-not-so-sober line.

minus one star for screwing with my order. i asked to have my noodles brought to me AFTER my sushi. when the noodles came before my fish i got the feeling that the staff may be trained about the menu but are largely ignorant of the finer parts of japanese cuisine.",ChK39XM_3pNkYIeDv1OQhQ,2,0,3,Z4kBhFDj4aj3K6fqk4NQJA

5806893,2007-06-21,0,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"I fell in love with Okada the first time I ate there, and have returned about a dozen times. It has the best sushi bar in town, and the other food I've tried has also been good. It's a beautiful restaurant, and a great place to relax. During good weather, massive doors slide open, exposing an entire side of the restaurant to a three tiered waterfall and its lake. The atmosphere at the sushi bar is cheerful.

Sushi chefs can either make or break a sushi bar. They're a major asset at Okada. Make sure to talk to your chef, ask questions, and show you're interested. I've learned a lot this way, and have been offered some tidbits not on the menu.

** SUSHI **
Sushi fans will head straight to the sushi bar. The sushi here is the best in Las Vegas. Quite a variety is available. It doesn't hurt to ask for something if it's not on the menu. Here are some of the more memorable items (sushi unless otherwise stated):
* o-toro (very fatty tuna belly). The best is marbled with fat, and very rich in flavor. It's best as sashimi. It's excellent here.
* uni (sea urchin). Very firm, with an almost nut like flavor. If you're ever going to try it, try it here; uni is one of those things that can be pretty bad unless it's perfectly fresh and of top quality.
* hamachi (yellowtail). This is a pretty common item at sushi bars, and is usually pretty good. At Wynn it's usually even better. Sometimes you'll get a much richer, fattier version (the yellowtail equivalent of o-toro) that is absolutely delicious as sashimi.
* unagi (barbecued eel). If you've never tried it, order it here! It actually takes a little bit of care to prepare unagi. Okada does it right.
* saba (mackerel). Not everyone will like this one, but I like it a lot. It's oily and has a strong flavor. Excellent as sashimi if you relish the strong taste.
* ama ebi (sweet shrimp). This type is served raw. This is yet another item I wouldn't order anywhere but a top notch place, where I am confident of the freshness. At Okada, the shrimp have an excellent fresh flavor, with no hint of sliminess. Sadly, they do not serve the shrimp heads as tempura.
* Okada roll. Hit the jackpot? Then order this roll. Made with lots of lobster, avocado, and asparagus, and served with sweet sauce and another sauce that might have been wasabi mayonnaise. Additional lobster meat was placed on the dish, sprinkled with some sort of strong pepper, then quickly seared with a torch. Delicious. Expensive but worth it.
* ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). This isn't on the menu, and isn't even sushi, but it's worth asking for. It's kind of like a pate, and is served cold in thick circular slices, usually with a sweet vinegary sauce.
* other good stuff: tai, served with salt and lemon; mirugai (giant clam); shima-aji; hotate (scallop), gently seared; kanpachi (leaner variety of yellowtail); bluefin tuna (redder and richer than maguro).



** TASTING MENU **
The tasting menu provides an excellent introduction to some of the different kinds of food offered by Okada. I don't know if the menu changes over time. When I was there, I had:
* Carpaccio of Hokaido Scallop with Preserved Plum Vinaigrette. Four medium thin slices of sea scallop. Very sweet and fresh, mild flavor.
* Seared Langoustine and Matsutake Mushroom and Kaboche Squash. The langoustine was like a shrimp, but sweeter, and slightly less chewy. The mushroom pieces were meaty but not chewy. The squash was starchy but also slightly sweet.
* Sushi - Maguro (tuna) and ??? (fluke)?. Not bad, but nothing special.
* Robatayaki - Lamb Chop, Asparagus Wrapped in Bacon, Shishito Peppers. Robatayaki is a grilling process. The asparagus in bacon was delicious. The peppers were interesting, starting out mild but finishing with a spicy kick. The lamb chop was to die for - juicy, crisp, with a strong grilled flavor.
* Roasted Beef Sirloin and Hudson Valley Foie Gras, with Roasted Fingerling Potato, Young Spinach, and Aromatic Sauce (Kobe beef was available for $30 extra; I passed). The foie gras was crisp on the outside, meltingly rich on the inside; I loved it. The sirloin, served rare, was chewy, but the balsamic vinegar reduction gave it very good flavor.
* Yuzu Scented Panna Cotta with Passion Fruit Sorbet. The coconut panna cotta was heavenly. It reminded me of the perfect haupia I once had at a hole in the wall diner in Hawaii, but this was even better. The sorbet was very good.
* Caramel-Chocolate Cake (Kabocha Mousse, Caramel Gelee, Roasted Pineapple). A small portion, but wonderful. Super dense layer of caramel, and another dense layer of chocolate. A few peanuts were on top, as well as some sort of ice cream. A great dessert.

Overall, this was one of the better tasting menus I had in Las Vegas. It's well worth the money.

UPDATE Oct 2007: The hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar), robayaki style, is excellent here. Highly recommended.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,1,0,5,t2_R49jZFjYcZryhlyP9vw
5897221,2011-09-23,1,m1BL2XSBqnqP1qfmbrKmug,"Beautiful atmosphere and a very nice staff make this place enjoyable. However, for the prices they charge, the food is a bit underwhelming. The jalapeño hamachi with a great chili/avocado cream and ponzu was knee weakening good. The nigiri selections were fine but nothing exceptional. The grilled rice ball and the hamachi Kama (ordered off the menu) are very good but $6 for a ball of grilled rice?  Its not that the food wasn't good but my bill alone was $150 with tip and a carafe of sake and I had to eat something 3 hours later because I was hungry again.   If I pay that much for dinner, which I don't have a problem doing, it better be exceptional. 

If you stay at the Wynn and you are using an expense account, you won't be disappointed but if you are buying, lower your expectations.",GpVG8mL-qLjCTt0L7Ufajg,1,1,3,cZecPbkmYia-OvfUWWOsgA

Fish quality was excellent, service was great, and there were no problems of any sort.  We sat at the sushi bar and had very prompt service on a relatively slow night.  I would rate this higher if they ticked their prices down slightly, but we were a bit gouged for what we received in comparison to the prices I expect from other high-end sushi providers.  Some of the sushi items were lacking a bit of imagination, and the selection was good but not great.  Portion sizes were OK- more on the small than 'average' size.  We left full, but could have eaten more, but also would have flirted with a $300+ bill for two people...as it was we slipped in just under $200...

In my opinion, Okada is a good option and you will enjoy your food.  If you are a picky sushi eater and want variety, toro, etc...you will spend spend spend!  For my $, I'd head to the Forum and go to Sushi Roku, a bit better value, and a solid 4+ star sushi in my opinion.",fES_Ws1CDBUw7vcTJzr8CA,0,0,3,-4sti9vMOTf9SSOjV3uYHA
