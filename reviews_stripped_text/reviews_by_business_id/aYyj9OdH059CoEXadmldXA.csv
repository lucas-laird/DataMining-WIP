Staff: 5/5 for customer service 
Food: 5/5 for quality, quantity & presentation

Chicken Teriyaki: So juicy and thick. I loved how they don't drench it in sauce, just a little glaze, with a side of teri sauce. 

Veggie Tempura: A LOT of veggie, little tempura! Perfect crunch and not greasy. 

California Roll: Perfect size, simple, not a lot of rice. Perfect!

Shumai: I believe it was shrimp, nice golden brown color, great flavor and the sauce was delicious. 

Volcano Roll: Wish it was a little spicier but over all, flavor, texture, presentation and tempura was spectacular. 

So glad they're right around the corner!!",R2UDgsb8MD8XtiWYLp8ljQ,2,2,5,adYB91FdQzXgsuseamDOmA
191427,2017-12-29,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"Wow! This used to be our favorite restaurant to frequent as a family.  However the quality of service has dramatically decreased in the last couple of months.  

I am actually composing this review from the restaurant where we have waited over an hour just to receive our soup. Upon our arrival, we were seated at the hibachi grill section and had to wait 10 minutes for the server to greet us, another 10 minutes to receive water, and another...hold on...20 minutes to order drinks.  Then after we place our order, the server informed us that they don't have the salad that goes with the dinner, but doesn't offer any compensation or discount.  The cook who prepared our food had absolutely no personality or flare, nor was he a hibachi chef.  We could've gone to  a regular restaurant to be merely served a steak.  

Realistically, the 2-star rating is too generous. But I'm hoping that the last 2 experiences are apparitions as opposed to the new standard.


...Oh, by the way, the server's name is Richard.  He has been terrible both of the last two times we have come.  One time it was busy, the other time it was not.  Regardless, his service is HORRIBLE.",Ks4kSYPAxnjMg9CYMVXDfg,1,0,2,_gL_dsUskjJlycYFu8Ok_A

776641,2017-09-25,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,Found this place on Yelp looking for good sushi around my house. My wife and I love sushi and are semi new to the area so we wanted to find a new place to call our sushi home! It was my birthday the day we decided to try Bonsai so we were really hoping to have a good experience. We made a reservation for 5:45pm and we're running a little late so we didn't make it there until 6:00pm. As soon as we walked in we were promptly greeted with 3-4 smiling faces . We apologized for being late to our reservation and they immediately assured us it was absolutely no problem at all. We asked to sit at the sushi bar which they gladly took us too. Richard was our server and we got our drink orders taken almost immediately. Along with appetizers . We were just going to go with ale carte and order our rolls separate(which was going to be about 3 rolls each for my wife and I) Richard quickly recommended that we do the all you can eat because we would actually be saving money. The 3 rolls we ordered were going to be more than the all you can eat price. So we agreed to do that. Richard heard us talking about it being my birthday and asked me if it was!! I said yes!! He said well you can to the right place because you get your meal for free! (Which was a $26.00 value) The chefs were VERY attentive to us and made sure all of our needs were taken care of! We had a show to go to so we had to leave at a certain time and Richard made sure our check was there and ready so we could be on time . Every aspect of this experience was 5 star. We will definitely be coming back! I recommend asking for Richard because he is just amazing at what he does. You can tel his number one goal is to make the customer happy! Cannot wait to return to Bomsai!! The sushi was amazing !! And they all sang to me for my birthday! What an incredible night!!,3rf7MaKXJryeGpMcSf2-7w,0,0,5,p91krUa-BBIMRH7r6NLzcA

897658,2017-04-24,2,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"Horrible experience! First, we sat our self down because no one paid attention or greeted us. We sat at our table for 15 minites, being ignored, until I had to ask for a menu. Water didn't even come until 20 minutes later and that's because I had to ask our server for some water.

They served us our soup and salad (we got the salad for free because the server screwed up our ordered and gave us salad instead of the miso soup we ordered) and once again I had to request for some utensils so we could start eating. 
I ordered the fish tempura which is fried salmon and tempura veggies. The salmon was horrible. No season at all. They straight fried it with no seasoning so all you got was a mouth full of panko.

The restaurant been open for 5 months (mind you its a small restaurant) and the servers were struggling with orders and running sushi to the wring tables. The table that was sitting next to us also complained about their service, so I knew it wasn't us and that it was the restaurant that was horrible!

A little advise to Bonsai Restaurant- NEVER IGNORE YOUR CUSTOMERS! ALWAYS GREET THEM REGARDLESS IF YOUR BUSY OR NOT!

1040957,2018-02-15,1,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"Uh, it's hard to believe this place has enough friends and family to get 4 stars. We had bad food compounded by worse service. I don't get it: it wasn't busy, considering it was Valentines Day.  We were seated quickly and our drinks and miso soup came quickly. The soup wasn't hot,  the salad was Iceberg with a nondescript dressing soaking it.

After that,  things went downhill. The waitress disappeared to concentrate on a birthday group. We had to ask for everything else from more water to Wasabe. The Rainbow roll was good; the Crunchy Roll had a peculiar texture and was bland. The Tempura Shrimp and Vegetables rank as some of the worst I've had: the batter was so heavy,  you couldn't taste the shrimp; the texture of the batter varied from mushy and undercooked to chewy. When we finally saw our waitress, again,  she brought our bill. We told her we hadn't yet received our Hamachi Kama. She replied they were out and redid our bill.

My favorite place for hibachi has always been Ohjah, but this place is closer and more convenient and just as good in my opinion. Our dinner was great the first time and their sake selection is great. The 2nd time we sat at the bar and had some baked mussels and a couple of appetizers which were all great. 

This recent 3rd visit, we sat in the dining room as we did not want to do the hibachi. It was very slow and there was only one other table besides us at 8:30. We had a new server, said he was still in training. He was very nice and had a personality. Some of the time, I felt he should've just kept comments to himself. He was not rude, but came off like a cocky popular high school jock. We noticed there were some menu errors which was kinda disappointing. We asked about the ""fried oysters"" as it said on the menu. The server did not know so he said he would find out for us. He came back to the table and told us they did not have fried oysters, only raw. I'm not crazy about raw oysters, so we decided to pass. I wanted to try the $45 sashimi/roll platter. The server said he could not tell us what was on it, it was chefs choice. That's fine and I understand they probably use what they have extra of or what is about to go bad before it actually does. But it would be kinda nice to have an idea of what we would be getting, but he said he has no idea. We decided to get an order of baked mussels(amazing) 2 orders of different kinds of tuna(amazing) and the salmon skin salad(amazing). We ordered 4 orders of salmon belly nigiri because we LOVE it. It did not disappoint, tasted super fresh. We had 2 different rolls that were both super great. One was the Odessa and I can't remember the other. 

The restaurant started closing before we had our dessert. I work in the restaurant industry and definitely get closing early if there's no business. Helps save on labor, especially if it's been slow all day. I think they should increase their marketing to bring more people in. The food is amazing and super fresh. The staff is always really nice. I love the fact I can go in on a weekend evening and not have to wait, but when they start closing and cleaning before we've had dessert, it made me feel rushed and they wanted us out. Right as we got our dessert(free mochi upon check in with Yelp,) a family of 7 walked in for hibachi. Sorry guys, that sucks.  

Overall, this place is a must! Whether you sit at the hibachi table, the bar counter, or in the dining room. Thanks guys for a great dinner!",yiARUkC0DORf2IGsSwAAMA,0,1,4,KDKxKXLHWNW3tJrBjj5BUg

The rice is good enough to make two nigiri and imagine that being combined in 1 pc of nigiri... the handroll we ordered came to us as cut roll and they apologized because the sushi chef didn't know  what handroll is... apology accepted. They corrected it and made us a handroll. There was bit of delay and it's not even busy for a 7pm Sunday dining. The best is saved for last, Mochi ice cream! Can't go wrong right :) over all good not sure if I'd try this place again.",wvyaM-o_DA8CsPTUsUTHOg,0,0,3,5dMR19NKi2S6Yjb_JGmMsg

The service was great. Our waiter was very friendly. He refilled our waters very quickly. My only comment is about filling out the paper: I don't prefer to fill out papers for AYCE, but I can see why it's necessary.

On to the food. It was good. The fish quality was pretty good but the rice was a bit cold and hard. They were also out of a lot of items during our visit. While that is no one's fault, it took away from the value of my visit.

Will visit again when they have more items, but not my favorite Vegas sushi spot.",TZCPXnoK4UeUBrgH7oxxhw,0,0,2,J9HpvyR2oZ6bm9a3mOn9dg

We liked the wait staff for friendliness and efficiency. The food was good too, and we had Teriyaki Shrimp and Teriyaki Salmon, which came with a side of either miso soup or salad. The teriyaki came with sautéed green bell peppers, onions and steamed broccoli on a fajita plate. We also had the Las Vegas roll, which was more breaded than crunchy, but had decent flavor in it. Can't go wrong with mochi ice cream at the end of a meal either. 
This is some place I'd go to if I were in the area. Fiancé says we should try this place out again once Lent is over and we can have cocktails with our meals, probably even try the Hibachi area with family/friends.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,2,1,4,bfTvSbkBfl_6wPFy7f6iYA

You are able to make reservations for this place so I thought it would be busy. When we got there, we were seated right away and there was maybe 3 other tables. Towards the other side of the restaurant, they have teppanyaki but only one party was there.

They have a wide selection of different items on the menu. When you order, they will bring out the appetizers first, followed by the sushi and rolls. The fish was fresh but the nigiri had soooo much rice in it. Coming from Southern California, the AYCE sushi places there know that if they want our business they need to put as little rice as possible. 

Other than the gigantic amount of rice in the nigiri and our server messing up our drink orders, the experience was pleasant. A couple items that were great included: yellowtail with jalapeno, ono, salmon tataki, halibut, red snapper and veggie tempura. 

The cost of dinner was $27 per person and they share a parking lot with multiple businesses. If you enjoy eating copious amounts of rice with your sushi then this place is for you. For me, I like my nigiri with little to no rice. I will pass on this place and make my way to other places when I am visiting Las Vegas again.",wDQ0BonvgfiGCWRQOkz4Gw,3,3,3,skP_cPlAewcv0sCMAGnpsg

They made the rolls with avocado so they had to remake it. I felt bad but I asked them for no avocado when I ordered because I'm allergic. Also, the spicy tuna roll was not spicy but lukewarm. 

Dined at the bar and one of the chefs were right in front of us the whole time...he wasn't even the one that took our order or made the sushi. It was really awkward because only 4 of 8 bar seats were taken with guests and he was just standing there watching us eat. Ah, so weird. There must be something else you could be doing...

The bento came out and the beef was good. They forgot to bring out the rice and when they did it was a little on the dry side. The waiters reached across and in between the two of us throughout the meal. Just may be inexperience. There wasn't any consistency in service either. Check took forever to get. There were a total of 6 guests in the whole restaurant. 

Overall, the service was interesting. I'm no food expert but the food is okay and I left feeling uncomfortable and awkward. Oh, it's probably from the chef watching us eat the whole time.",n9qd2GsOBzQf4pBCLcZ8CQ,1,1,2,3fGsGudoloUdjNHVVHIFOQ

But anyway.. the place was packed, but comfortable. Moving on to the important stuff. We did the hibachi, and got to kind of peek in on another table while we waited for ours to be ready and their hibachi chef was great and interactive and really put on a show. Ours however was a bore. I think they just got overly busy and needed to get chefs out so they had a chef from the back come out and he was not at all interactive or entertaining. the food was great though we all had chicken which was really tender and the rice, which you get a big bowl of and a generous helping of veggies.

The first thing I noticed when I came into the door was the hostess was on the phone and it was a personal phone call for sure. She did not say hi or welcome, or hang up the phone she continued her phone conversation and then sat us down. I have been a hostess before and I would never treat a guest that way. Hopefully the help wanted for servers and hostess in the window will bring in better employees. Next I find out that they only had one baked roll well the server said that at first and I asked him to please ask the chef if he can make me more baked rolls because I am not allowed to eat any raw ones right now I'm pregnant. Usually most places can make atleast a variety of 5 baked rolls. He came back and this was not the case. He said the sushi chef could only make one more baked roll. So only 2? Not cool. Their other location has a variety. Then I asked if their steak had a smaller portion then a 5 oz. He said no. He also informed me it wasn't part of the all you can eat. Even though I normally enjoy it, I could not eat on the tepon table at this time because I was with my toddler and it's unsafe for her. It's unfortunate this spot is close to my house and lacks customer service skills and doesn't have many options for me.

Tiger roll- amazing as it is my usual sushi order
Shrimp and salmon teppanyaki entrees- we split this and the chef already knew that we were going to and have us even portions.

The first time i was dining in with my bf and he had the steak teriyaki lunch special. He said that it was really good and when I had a bite of his steak it was very tender and the flavor was decent. You could taste the steak instead of just tasting the teriyaki sauce at other places.  I was craving noodles and all they had were sauteed udon noodles. So I ordered it with steak as well... And it was delicious. So good in fact that I was craving it days later. Lol

Then the second time I got there lunch special and it was decent. Good amount of food for your buck... But nothing really stood out from the lunch special. But overall decent flavors.

Then the last time I went...I wanted the sauteed udon noodles... Yup...I was craving it again. Lol and like the first time... The meat was tender and the noodles were flavorful. 

They also have fried rice ONLY as a side dish so you can't order it as an entree. The flavor and texture is good but Everytime I've gotten it... It's been a tad bit bland... But sprinkle on some soy sauce and it was perfect. I wish they would make a entree size fried rice. 

Flavor (4/5)... For the most part.. Delicious. :)

Overall, Everytime I've been the ambiance has been clean and welcoming. Ambiance (5/5) The servers mostly have been good... The first time the server I had.... Had a tendency to shuffle her feet... Which after a while was annoying... But that's a little petty. Lol

The place huge, they have a side for sushi and a side for teppanyaki. We were seated immediately, Richard came right over to take our drink orders and showed us the menu. First off, Richard was awesome! We was so friendly and joyful, took great care of us, he made jokes and seemed to really enjoy his job. 

You also get a free meal here on either side of the restaurant if you come on your birthday! They play the Japanese drums and blast birthday music and sing to you. Very cool! 

Food wise, the menu doesn't necessary have unique or different items compared to other places (appetizers wise), but what they do have are of quality. The fishes are fresh and sweet, rolls are delicious and creative. Their presentation for the rolls are also pretty nice. I was very impressed by their tempura, both the vegetable tempura and shrimp tempura. The batter on the vegetable tempura were very thin and so crunchy! The shrimp tempura are coated with panko instead of just batter, so very crispy and crunchy, shrimps were also very big too. The salmon skin salad was very good, similar to seaweed salad with crispy salmon skin and other veggies. The salmon skin roll was good too, very crunchy...I don't know of another place that has salmon skin roll like this. 

My grandma does not eat sushi so we ordered stir-fried udon which she loved! This is a statement because my grandma is very picky with food and she does not like to eat out, but she said she would come back for the udon! Huge portion too...the plate was bigger than her. 

Overall, I really like this place. Not a place to come to if you are looking for unique appetizers or a large appetizes menu, but if you want quality sushi give this place a try.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,2,4,GLtybMbEQ_aaOR9UR9tDFw

The food here is pretty bad - I got a bento box with teriyaki salmon, California roll, shumai, and vegetable tempura. My boyfriend got combo chicken and steak teriyaki. We also got two orders of gyoza - our favorite. It came with salad and miso soup.

The salmon teriyaki was very good, along with the tempura and miso soup. My boyfriend couldn't even eat his meat, he said the meat wasn't good. His dad said the salad dressing tasted really weird. The shumai was disgusting, I had to spit it out. The gyoza was super disappointing - the filling was really strange and untraditional, with a bad taste, and the outside while it looked crispy was very mushy. The California roll was weird - it wasn't traditional at all, I think it was imitation crab mixed with cream cheese with a little piece of celery. The rice was also undercooked and had a weird taste, how do you mess up rice?

We didn't eat most of the food and no one enjoyed it. And for the record, we are not picky eaters in the slightest. I wouldn't be back or recommend. Sad, our expectations were much higher.",D5ireMnMg23_SFecSFZ90A,2,0,1,dQeAVKi7x5Vu7FdXTeMisA

Me, my brother and parents all ordered the bento box which is almost $16. I ordered chicken with mine and when we got our food, portions were very small. Very dissapointing. I regret going here and should've chose kabuki instead. Place is loud as well, so good luck trying to have a conversation. Waitress barely checked on us to make sure everything was okay. Didn't receive any refills. They took awhile to finally get us our bill, sat around for maybe 15mins waiting. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.

Too be honest, most AYCE places do not serve high quality fish, so that's my fault. My food also took a very long time, rest of the family who didn't order AYCE was already finished by the time I got my first order of sushi.
Next, the staff sat a completely belligerent and very drunk guy next to us, then sat some very angry teens on the other side of us whose every other word was the f word. The restaurant was empty so seating us in between these two groups of individuals made the whole experience so much worse than it should have been. Based on food alone we would have tried again but based on the type of people who come here, we just can't risk it.

2330336,2018-06-07,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"This place used to be really good. After a few months the quality of the fish has really dropped. As I noticed a lot of sushi spots start off really caring about quality, but over time they can't stand losing money by keeping only fresh fish in & tossing the old. This place is a good example, either the owners/managers are letting poor quality fish go out or the chef is. 
   Service has always been a 2 star at best. Never been a fan of any of the waitresses or the waiter. Pretty rude. Don't ask them for any recommendations, it's such a big hassle for them to do their job and know the menu. They have no clue on how to help you order what your looking for. They just tell you that you can read the whole f*n menu then order when your ready. This is mainly the older male waiter at this place, no help at all with the menu. But we have had this same issue with the waitress as well.
   The restaurant is very bright inside, not a very comfortable setting at all. Mixed with poor service and bad quality fish. Only the tasteless foodies will enjoy the Americanized cream cheese filled, deep fried, mayo based fake sushi this place has. It's really insulting how these places make sushi with all these fat flllers and disgusting when I see people eating it. When did sushi become a deep fried cheese burger sub beef for fish?

2372208,2017-09-29,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"I am so glad when they open a Hibachi/ Sushi place in this neighborhood. No need to drive far for dinner entertainment with the family. It's located next to Kung Fu Tea, intersection of Rainbow and Warm Spring. It was behind the Metro Diner so don't miss it. Plenty of parking spaces around. 

Heath was our server and two thumbs up for him for his great service. He was very thorough taking our drinks order (8 of us, 8 different drinks!). The lemon for the water had a weird taste, so he changed it right away for us. He provided us with a tentative, friendly, quick and an effective service. 

It's a pretty big restaurant where they can accomodate up to 135 people inside. They three sections: hibachi sections, sushi bar or regular dining tables. The place is clean and well maintained. 

No sushi tonight, we had Hibachi instead. Love the creativity the hibachi Chef. He made dinner so fun for the kids and our whole crew. Who would not love to eat  Erupted Volcanoes Onion, Dissapeared Jumping Eggs or Choo choo train made of Onion? 
 
Here is the recap of our dinner tonight:
- Appetizer: Yellowtail Hamachi with special yuzu sauce, a hint of sriracha and topped with jalapeno. Fresh and spicy! Yumm. A must try. 

- Entrees: Hibachi
It comes with soup (clean broth miso with seaweed) and salad (iceberg with ginger sauce) 
For the meat we chose: Lobster tail, Salmon, Chicken and Fillet Mignon. Love the lobster tail, salmon and fillet mignon, they were fresh and cooked perfectly. The chicken was overcooked. Dry and hard to chew. 
Hibachi also comes with mixed veggies: mushroom, onion, broccoli and zucchini. 
Additionally, hibachi comes with fried rice (cooked at the hibachi table according to your taste). As option, you may also add shrimp or other meat to the rice. The fried rice was tasty. 

- Desert: vanilla mochi and green tea ice cream. Perfect. 

Would have give this place a 5 stars if the chicken was cooked perfectly. But overall, we had a great dinner entertainment and I prefer their food than Benihana, especially when their price is better. Would come back again, possibly for Happy Hour (I saw they have great variety of Happy Hour Menu).",XU-JR0vGW1_O5GmNwZ0bfQ,0,1,4,zPLT-Er0h-rq7IlU3IMudw

I however did not have the same experience as them when we went for lunch one day. We came in, a group of 7 of us for a quick lunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was us and one other table of people in the whole place. It took a very long time for them to get us our drinks and to get our orders. We all ordered something, most of us had done the ayce sushi and we sat and waited. Little by little one person would get one thing. It took a good 20 minutes before I even got anything from my order when most of the rest of my group had received 2-3 things each from theirs. It wasn't busy at ALL so there is no reason that our service should've been this bad. I didn't even bother ordering anything else after my first order because I was tired of waiting for my food and just wanted to leave. I also didn't want to be the only person eating since everybody else already finished. I don't feel I even got my money's worth with my experience here. They had a few good things that I tried from my friends orders since they were actually receiving their food, but I wasn't super impressed with the few things I got when I finally got them. I also don't like the fact that they don't tell you right from the beginning about the large gratuity they add for bigger parties.

We came for my sons birthday and it was late because we were originally going to go to another Japanese Steakhouse but they turned us down since they didn't have enough staff to open another table so we left. I'm so glad to found Bonsai. Sometimes that's how the world works when one door closes another one opens. The staff brought out the drums and sang my son happy Birthday which was so cool! 

The restaurant was so cool to enter! They had an elegant but chill decor! The sushi bar was well employed with sushi chefs and they have more than enough tables.

The hibachi area was superb! It was typical like all Japanese Steakhouse and had a good amount space between each table. It didn't feel like you were all up in other people's dining area. 

The food was awesome! I ordered the Rib Eye and Shrimp. My son had the fried noodles and my wife had the New York steak! Our chef cooked it to perfection! Nice and juicy! Meat was very well flavored and the fried rice/vegetables was awesome! 

They offer happy hour specials so we had a pint of Sapporo and had their fried oysters! The fried oysters was bomb diggity! Make sure you guys try it out! I highly recommend it.

Our chef as nice and did the normal tricks like the volcano but other than that didn't do any new tricks. Perhaps I've seen them all but it's always good to see new styles when I come to Japanese steakhouses. 

One difference they didn't have was a plate that had combination of meat. You order a main dish and then if you want to add additional meats or items it's additional cost. It still comes out pretty competitive in prices but I enjoy seeing an option for a plate with more than 1 item. 

They have a large menu which is great!

2812366,2017-04-30,1,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"Horrible experience. I always give places a second chance because you never know if the first was a fluke or not. My boyfriend and I decided to try Bonsai since we drive by quite often. 

The first experience was perfect. Our waiter was attentive, our orders had come at a timely manner and the food tasted really good. My boyfriend had the ayce sushi and was mentioning how this place would be our go to sushi. He mentioned how fresh the fish tasted and how quick we got our sushi. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo bento which came with soup, salad, vegetable tempura, shumai, salmon teriyaki, rice, and California roll. The salmon teriyaki was delicious. I wanted more! Our bill was around $50-$60, but it was worth it and decided we would come again. 

Today, Our experience was less than great. We had come around dinner time, but there was only two other booths taken. We sat down and was asked what we wanted to drink. I don't remember our waitress' name, but we wished we had the male waiter instead. We had asked for waters with lemon. She came out with just water, and then gave us the menus and a paper ayce menu. She was about to just take the paper menu and leave, but I had to mention that I wanted to order off the regular menu. I told her my order and I had to repeat myself and point to the menu since she didn't understand ""snow crab"". I then asked for lemon for our water and then she left. Few minutes go by and she tends to the other tables, 5 more minutes go by and wave her down and ask for slices of lemon. She looks as if she understands by smiling and nodding and then leaves. 5 minutes go by and I get agitated since I have asked 3 times for lemon. My boyfriend and I see the male waiter and when we asked for lemon, he came back very quickly. I noticed he was tending to other tables that started coming as well. 

A few minutes go by and my salmon teriyaki comes with the rice. It was flavorless. I didn't order the combo this time and was just expecting salmon, rice, and a salad. No salad came and the teriyaki sauce was sunken to the bottom of the salmon. My boyfriend made a comment saying I was suppose to get a salad. The waitress seemed surprised and asked if I wanted a salad. When I said yes, she left quickly and I didn't have time to ask for extra teriyaki sauce. 

30-40 minutes probably went by since being seated and my boyfriend didn't even get his sushi. We watched other tables getting their orders before us and even leaving before us! When his order finally came, his appetite was gone. We had enough of waiting and was just annoyed with out service. 

Overall, we give this place a 1 out of 5 stars. We had to ask 4 different times for lemon for our water and waited around 30-40 minutes for our food even though there was hardly anyone there. 

My boyfriend noticed that on the ayce paper menu it doesn't have a time limit like other sushi places. We concluded that if there was a time limit, then there wouldn't be any time left to order a second time. 

We are highly disappointed. I came home and started eating some apples to satisfy myself.",wyPurOSZN5G0QBMXz1ItQw,0,0,1,ZOaSMBW5zN8QMM3lrrSLug

We decided to try this place out for my husbands birthday since they offered a free AYCE on your birthday. I was really surprised since other reviews seemed to make this place seem hit or miss. The quality of the fish was very fresh. They had some of the freshest tuna I have tasted in America. The presentation of the dishes served was something you don't typically get at an AYCE place but they were so nice, they seemed like a la carte orders. The rice to fish ratio also seemed a la carte. The slice of fish was way longer than the rice and the cut rolls and hand rolls had very little rice. My husband is picky about rice which can make or break a place for him. He said the rice was perfect for our orders but then became dry and hard near the end of our meal. It's ok because I was still so impressed with the flavors and freshness of the fish, the presentation, the quality. We loved it. Overall, I am really happy to stumble upon this place and it is closer to my house. We will definitely be back.

With this meal we got about 6 pieces of steak each. I cut each piece in half or thirds just to stretch the meat further. Flavor was ok. I didn't like the dressing they used on the salad at all. It tasted almost like plain mayonnaise. Maybe I'd give this place 3 stars if I had liked the salad dressing and if it came with miso soup.

We ordered a spicy salmon role and both got filet hibachi.  

Our server informed us that they have a few specials: 2 sushi rolls for $16.95 and the first house sake, wine, or beer are on them!  Great perks!  We also noticed they have hibachi lunch specials for only $8.95, how great! 

The food was excellent.  The steak had great flavor and the salmon had such a fresh taste in the roll.

We definitely had some lapses in service.  We had to ask for chopsticks for our sushi and meals, kind of strange but overall we had an excellent experience!

3352558,2017-12-03,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"I've tried both their teppanyaki and their AYCE sushi. The teppanyaki was just ok to me. The sauce they used for their teppanyaki is a bit too sweet. I tried both rib eye and chicken and the rib eye was quite dry. The fried rice that they made was not as good as other teppanyaki places, so that pretty much killed it for me. If a teppanyaki place can't make a good fried rice, then it's a fail in my book! The mushroom soup that came with the teppanyaki was also too peppery. The salad was good and fresh. The show that they did was cute.

Their AYCE sushi is definitely better than their teppanyaki. All the fish I had here tasted pretty fresh and I like that they offer some sashimi options with the AYCE. I don't really go for sushi rolls, so I didn't try those. The appetizers are either hits or misses. Overall, I still prefer yama as my AYCE place.

3547060,2017-12-21,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"Read reviews decided to give it a try. I'll break down...
Service/friendliness 5 stars
Atmosphere/cleanliness: 4 stars very clean, atmosphere was simplistic, a little cold.
But it's the food that drops the rating for us.
We shared a bento box to give it a try as you could experience several items for about $17 out the door.  It was a lot of food.  The miso soup was excellent.  The salad was nothing more than a bowl of iceberg lettuce thoughtlessly cut up with a flavorless odd textured dressing.
The chicken teriyaki was prepared well but it was served on bed of sautéed onions and sliced green (peppers?) that impacted the flavor of the teriyaki, spoiling it.  There were 2 Shumai pieces that tasted more like deep fried puffs of air. We were told the tempura was comprised of shrimp and  veggies.  There was no shrimp. The rest was prepared okay but the dipping sauce was bland and almost had a burnt taste to it.  That ruined the tempura.  It also come with a California roll.  I love sushi and in my view a California roll is about as basic as it gets, so if that's not good, I wouldn't venture further.  It was not very good, neither of us could figure out where the strange sour taste was coming from, but it permeated the flavor of the roll.  
In conclusion, it's not bad food, it's passable, but definitely not great. We would not go back based on that experience. There are just better places, we had high hopes as its close to home, but we'd drive further for great food.  It seems like they are trying too hard to be chic or different instead of just serving great tasting food. It pains me to say that as they are so nice. We really wanted it to be great, but it just wasn't.  :(",u7t0AEo7nJsV3bLGY_ndTQ,0,0,3,mKve1GxHm0Q6b9ND-NORpA

Started well, soup was very tasty and the salad was okay; nothing overly flavorful for the dressing. Salad was a bit over cold. My sister did not like the veggies, but the rest of us found nothing wrong or overly special with them. Fried rice was also okay, nothing overly bad or especially tasty. My husband had chicken and ribeye as entree, sis had chicken and her husband paired up shrimp and chicken. I had scallops, big mistake. Scallops were horribly overcooked, very dry, flavorless and tough. I am suspicious that it was really scallop, but some type of whitefish. Hubby was happy with his ribeye, but it too was overcooked. Chicken was okay, shrimp overcooked as well.

It is much tougher than the ribeye (obviously cause different cuts). Trust me, I won't be getting the NY again. Bland and tough to chew (even at med rare).

Service was a little wishy washy the first 2 times. First time, our server hardly checked on us. We asked to have waters refilled.

They never brought the sushi and tried to charge us. Hibachi was ok ( have had much better at a cheaper price just down the street) not too flavorful. So we really haven't had the urge to go back. Well we got a coupon that said free meal for your birthday. Just went to take my daughter and they refused the coupon because my 8 year old daughter doesn't have an ID... horrible customer service and a good way to loose business. We won't ever go back which is their loss as we frequent other similar establishments and are typically 6 or more people at a time.",hc0MH3we08YBKbmtdcs8tw,2,0,1,MKN_xt2n2Wqj-Y49V44UlQ

4136087,2017-06-14,1,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"So my daughter graduated from Palo Verde HS and we wanted to throw her a small party. Back story: we were going to originally have it at Wicked Spoon. After much deliberation we changed our minds and decided on this place. We've been here  once before and had a good experience. Thought hibachi would be a nice touch and it would be a little more intimate compared to Wicked Spoon. Imagine trying to talk to someone you haven't seen in years and having that fresh crepe or creme brûlée in the back of your head. Then having to actually get your ass up to get it. Plus, as the invite list grew worry of expenses came to mind. $55 ish dollars per head at Spoon compared to approximately $25 ish at this place. Yeah...

So the time and the place was set. We spoke with the Manager Derrick who btw during the whole experience was totally available for our Q's and concerns. My wife is a tad OCD(but I still love her) and she made a pre fix type menu to make it easier on the staff. They loved the idea. 

This is where this place went above our expectations. We expected 35 people. The OCD wife got there super early and decorated the walls and such. As we greeted guests as they came and kinda took note of the head count we realized we were going over our number. Our wonderful loved ones who said they weren't coming anymore Miraculously showed up! Boom! ""Surprise we made it make room for us biatches!"" 35 turned into 46. I won't get too much into that. That being said, as we continued to communicate with Derrick he assured us that they will accommodate and it wouldn't be a problem. We are that big ass family with kids running around and adults with diabetes complaining when the chefs are going to come and the other adults taking forever to take their damn seats and not knowing what they want to order. Hibachi pre fixe menu. Hello. Hella easy. Don't take 2 min to order. So even with my crazy fam and friends acting the fools, this staff managed and did an awesome job. Food was Great, best hibachi I've had. I would complain that service could of been faster But that was Our fault. Can't knock Bonsai for that. 

At the end of the day everyone had a great time. We brought in our own cake they didn't have a problem with that. We even had some time to catch up with our loved ones afterwards which was just as great as the sushi. My family was so pleased we may consider coming back for another big party. Thank you to Derrick and staff. I know it was earlier than usual to have a private party. We had a celebration and meal we will never forget.",OvUpf-sTYRyBlmuQFkV3qA,1,1,5,r__5WYwv72aBwsH4a44Eiw

Hand rolls and nigiri.  The seafood they use looks fresh and no ""fishy"" smell.  We like that the fish to rice ratio is just right. Even the rice on the rolls are just a thin layer. So you can taste the other ingredients.  A bottle of Hana Sake is only $20, that's a plus.  The service is is very good.

4231464,2017-02-19,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"We decided to give this place a try since Soho had a wait. We did have somewhat high expectation about this place as it is a newly opened restaurant with good yelp reviews. Turns out it was a full disappointment. I am just giving an extra star because their manager was very polite and prompt to take our complaints.

Nonetheless, as soon as you walk in, the restaurant just has a stinky fried fish smell, which will make you lose your appetite. Our server, Heath, seemed nice and friendly, yet he definitely did not seem like he had enough experience. We ordered the combination menu that had 15 pcs of Sashimi, 12 pcs of nigiri, and 2 special rolls. We chose the sizzling love roll and godzilla roll. We did not mind waiting for the actual order to come out soon since it could take them a while. However, the server never brought out the miso soup or salad that comes with the meal. When we asked about it he did not apologize and then asked us what we would like. We asked for the salad, which was good. 

When the server brought out the food, unlike our expectation, the special rolls were served first instead of sashimi. They were drizzled in sauces, which we did not want to have before having sashimi which would have no sauces on them. We asked the server about it and he said its whatever that is made first. I thought when you would actually mention it they would take it back and maybe bring it out later since we were not even touching them, but we waited more for the rest of our food to come out. When we got the sashimi and nigiri, we were not sure why it would take so long. Also, the server just attempted to leave the platter at the edge of the table instead of the center. We had to tell him where to place it as well. The food was alright.

Overall, you get what you pay for. Both service and fish quality were not better than newly opened AYCE places. Will probably never be back, unless I hear that they improved.",s01liMq8lG4G3f3AvJMi5w,3,0,2,5trNaWXJ9iZoXwo8avYk9g

The waiter, while cheerful and professional, barely spoke any english, and referred to the kitchen any time we had questions about the menu.  With quality, a few of the fried rolls came out cold.

I was surprised how many of their sushi rolls were not included in the ayce menu which was disappointing. The rolls we had were decent but they all generally tasted the same. Most of the ones on the ayce used the same sauces. The only one that was somewhat different was the Sizzling Love roll which was good.

5093190,2018-01-17,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"Bonsai!!! This is our go to place for AYCE Sushi. For only $26.99 for Adults or $19 for children under 12 you get to choose from a big variety on their AYCE menu. Like I mean the selection is big and everything is super fresh. You could choose anything like assorted sashimi, nigiri, rolls, tataki, to kitchen stuff like fried oysters, beef teriyaki, garlic noodles (My favorites) and so much more. The inside of this restaurant is pretty spacious, clean, and nicely decorated. As you walk in you will see all the tables, booths, and sushi bar but if you walk a little further there will be a doorway on the left to their teppanyaki room which is pretty big as well. 

Service is always great when we come here. Vincent the owner is super multitasker. I've seen him manage, make sushi, serve, bus, and more. It's always nice to see how much effort an owner puts into his business to make it succeed. Love all our usual servers as well. Erin, Justin, and Derek is our favorites of course. They are always nice, fast, and attentive. 

Love the food here. I am always here for the AYCE Sushi. Quality of their fish and food is always fresh. One of the only places I know that serves unlimited assorted sashimi (That is fresh). Love that they have tataki fish as a selection (Limit 2 per person). If you're looking to not fill up on rice this is the place to go bc they have a lot of no rice options for you to choose from on their AYCE menu. Their appetizer selections are very good as well. AYCE comes with 1 mochi per person. You can also get a free mochi if you check in on Yelp. 

Miso Soup - Good
Salmon Tataki - Good Fresh
Tuna Tataki - Good Fresh
Cajun Albacore - Good
Yellowtail Jalapeño - Great
Salmon & Tuna Tar Tar - Good, served on a Pringle chip
Salmon - Fresh
Super White - Fresh
Uni - Fresh
Ama Ebi - Fresh
Sashimi Combo 10 pc- usually comes with Salmon, Tuna, Super White, Yellowtail, & Cajun Albacore 

Cooked Foods

Fried Oysters - Delish
Baked Mussels - Good Perfectly seasoned
Shumai & Gyoza - Good
Shrimp & Veg Tempura - Love the light crispy batter 
Beef Teriyaki - Rare - Love their teriyaki sauce! Awesome
Garlic Noodles - Extra extra garlic! BOMB!! My Favorite!

Overall this place is wonderful and I recommend it to everyone. It's been my go to AYCE Sushi place because of its convenient location, spacious seating with usually no wait, awesome service, and good quality fish/Food. They do tend to be on the busy side when it's dinner time tho. They have good Happy Hour Specials as well as good priced lunch combos.

5349220,2016-11-30,1,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night and opted for a table versus their hibachi. We wanted some sushi :) Bonsai's interior design was actually very nice. It was very modern with pretty blue lighting by the bar. It was just very empty when we went. I think we were like the only table there that night. There were two tables when we got there but they had already left by the time we ordered. 

My boyfriend and I decided to share three rolls. We got their Alaskan roll, which was a salmon and avocado roll. Then we got two special rolls: the Sakura roll, which was spicy salmon crunch with shrimp avocado and tobiko on top and the Godzilla roll, which was spicy king crab topped with salmon, eel, avocado with tobiko. Two special rolls for $16.95! Really decent pricing. 

Bonsai puts a lot of effort in their plating. The special rolls were put on a nice plate and they even put a fake plant on the corner to make it extra special. 

As for the sushi, it was pretty decent. There is nothing to write home about and their rolls aren't out of the ordinary. They're pretty standard. I mean, for the price, it's good if you want some sushi and don't want to pay up the yin yang. And the rolls definitely fill you up. Plus, they have a really nice variety of rolls. 

The only problem that we had is that on their menu, they have a Rainbow roll and a S. Rainbow roll. My friend ordered a Rainbow roll but they gave her the S. Rainbow roll instead. Perhaps they should rename the S. Rainbow roll cause it was the chef that got confused on that. And you certainly don't want to confuse the chef. 

Overall, decent place. If you're in the area and you want some rolls, could definitely visit Bonsai. I personally prefer SoHo but I understand that SoHo doesn't have a lot of rolls for you to choose from.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,1,1,3,Z0oAoBTVelm0Ch7AGcQ4Aw

5467851,2016-11-19,1,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"Since Bonsai is close to where I work, I decided to check this restaurant out for their bento box lunch specials. I've been looking forward for this place to open because there can be limited options for me to get food on time when I am on my break. My coworkers also recommended this place for their cheap lunch specials and their fancy dish arrangements.

I called Bonsai one day to order a salmon teriyaki lunch bento box during my break. Since it was around $9, I would consider this lunch bento box to be very affordable, and there are also a lot of options that you can choose from, such as chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki. When I came to pick up my food, I got a salmon teriyaki lunch special instead of a salmon teriyaki lunch bento box. I was kind of disappointed because I wanted to try their shumai and California roll, but at least I got to try their salmon teriyaki, rice, and miso soup. The salmon teriyaki and rice were very appetizing, but I believe that I should have gotten the salad instead of the miso soup. 

I am giving Bonsai four stars for now because I believe that there are still improvements that they can make since they are a new restaurant. If you ever order to-go, make sure that they give you the right type of meal because there's a chance that they can give you a lunch special instead of a bento box for example. One day, I will try their very presentable sushi dishes and their teppanyaki when I have a chance!",bArcCPuX7wLOXO-McxV76g,2,1,4,nb2GIHJQdDTp4IbIUaoBog

5809073,2016-11-14,3,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"Went to dinner last week and sat at a regular table. Ambiance was nice but the food was not worth the money. My food looked pretty but taste was not. All of my food was not hot in temperature at all almost luke warm.  I ordered a bento box which essentially had grilled chicken teriyaki which had a rubber texture that I had to send it back.  The dumplings were cold n rubbery, miso soup wasn't even hot. Tempura was soggy and the waiter forgot my rice til  I mentioned it.  Oh ordered a hot green tea n had to send it back bc it wasn't hot. Waiter was like it looked steamy. My meal was like around $15 and I had better at a fast food teriyaki bowl place. I'm a supporter of small businesses but if the quality of food isn't good I can't support them. 
I chose this place bc of the great yelp reviews... I do not agree with any of the reviews.",7knsmhYRNtVunh6sNvrrtg,2,0,2,_eO84YxQBLgg5kekcKDLmA

The cucumber wrapped sushi was well done! This spot is deserving of more visits. Waitress and staff wonderful. Two thumbs up! Or a big high five. Or wait, I know; 5 stars. Wish my tummy could hold more to try more. We'll just have to come back!! 
Thanks Bonsai for being so convenient.....",Z-PvXAX__1hh6E9S7cbPig,0,0,5,Lvx8gXT9fyYEaLiFmr6fRA
5833598,2017-07-04,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,The Hibachi is good portions at a reasonable price with a friendly entertaining chef.  They are even accommodating to substitute extra veggies in place of rice or noodles. Happy hour is from 3-6 and 9-close $3 house wine $2 draft beer $3 off Hibachi and apps are $3-$7.,1o-d_kvOceQR5aPO90vQAQ,0,0,5,bprj-HdM3LQ-QAwfqE9CZw

Erin was attentive and friendly plus happy to clean up after my messy 1 yr old.  We tried a roll with 3 different topico.  It was my fav.

5902833,2017-10-29,1,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"This place was A-OK. My boyfriend and I stopped by for Happy Hour, and while affordable, our visit could be summed up as decent but forgettable.

One of the better menu items was the yellowtail jalepeno. Although one dimensional, it has a great kick. 

Some decent options include the tuna, salmon, and yellowtail nigiri (2 pieces per order) at $3 each. The fish quality is okay, but the rice wasn't the soft and supple dream I hoped it to be.

Another okay option is the tempura mix. It comes with two pieces of shrimp, one piece of broccoli, sweet potato, zucchini, green bell pepper, and onion. While generous, the batter wasn't light and fluffy, but dense and oily. The sauce is okay, but for the happy hour price of $5, I'd say it was a pretty good deal.

My boyfriend was the least satisfied with his chicken negi-maki (too much cream cheese) and the gyoza (okay flavor). He was much more satisfied with the regular menu items he ordered. While the ono nigiri was okay, the beef teriyaki was, by far, the best prepared menu item. While it came on a bed of partially raw onions, the cook was perfectly medium rare. Maybe this is a sign that their teppanyaki side is better?

Overall, I probably won't come back for the sushi. It was okay quality at best, and I feel like there are better options elsewhere for the same price range. If I did come back, it'd have to be for the teppanyaki.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,4,3,3,sDiKDEzi5ttYTcu9p68W_A
5911006,2017-12-25,0,aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA,"My boyfriend and I were craving poke one night, unfortunately it was so late every poke spot was closed, but we came across this sushi place and decided to check it out (since it was the only thing close to raw fish and beer). 

The environment is relaxing, the restaurant was divided into two sections, one for sushi/sushi bar and one for teppanyaki where chefs cook for you at the table. We caught them on a slow night so the restaurant was fairly empty when we got there, so no wait. We also dine in time for happy hours, they have variety of selections, already a happy camper. This sushi place is not AYCE though. Everything was great, food was good and price was fair considering the good quality of the fish. Definitely would come back and recommend!!",4ukIXXBhmHz9ioDXsjSjKQ,0,0,5,aYvsPKL28cYgUReIF8yHAw
