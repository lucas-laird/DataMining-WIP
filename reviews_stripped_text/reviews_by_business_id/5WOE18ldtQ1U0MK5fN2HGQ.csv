Plus there is fountain Vanilla Coke! I see myself eating here a couple times a week to be honest. Rubio's is known for its fish tacos. My favorite are the mango mahi mahi tacos. Just ate them tonight for dinner! Can't wait to go back. Ha!",P2vd7WYYmHNASt9cJZHElw,0,0,5,t5m36l8oZSaw3PPz7tABAw

a lot that is too small.  The city should never
have approved the permit for this.  The parking
lot is terrible.  It is cramped and congested;
the traffic pattern is inconvenient; it is hard
to get out of the parking lot back to the street.
The Rubios parking lot is not connected to the
business next door or to the adjacent shopping
center; the only way in or out is the busy street.

I have no complaint about the food or service;
it is standard Rubios.",9_XYtL0epG7y8lRTkN12eQ,0,0,4,iaZ2LGtHh2bXos0jv2M9Rw

Vegetarians can ask for nearly everything without seafood or chicken, but the actual menu is not very vegetarian-friendly. 

The Gourmet Shrimp Tacos were delicious! The blend of flavors was refreshing. I really liked the rice and bean dip included for the tortilla chips (but a little more salt may have added flavor), but I'm pretty sure it was not vegetarian. I was not a fan of the tortilla chips. They tasted a bit like bagged chips.

I had the Salsa Verde Shrimp Tacos on my second trip; it was delicious! Nick was working the counter and he was so sorry it took a while because they were so busy. He was very, very kind and helpful. 

The restaurant is very clean and the staff was exceptionally nice. Alfredo gets to know your name, smiles, engages in conversation, and remembers you when you return.

Ordering was easy, guy at the register was pleasant,the selection of food choices was good, and the menu was easy to read.
However, when going to the salsa bar, it was less than desirable. It was dirty. One salsa was completely empty, the limes were down to maybe six, the salsa cups were almost empty and the cilantro and onions didn't look fresh.  The drink station wasn't any better. The iced tea containers were empty; all three of them, the mango lime agua fresca was empty, someone had to ask for lids for the drink cups and there was trash around the area. As for the food, I had the coastal trio of tacos. They were very good.
So, were they slammed? It looked like three people were working. The guy on the register and the two ladies putting food together. For a new business, I was a bit turned off by the overall cleanliness and appearance.",V2rzZUNKyzWeO7ohMTPs8g,1,0,3,XTPTx9wGCoXdWIA6BGDk9A

The girl over the phone seemed as though i was bothering her, perhaps its busy which is the reason i called. So i try and simplify and ask if they can pull up my previous order by phone number, she says yes, i ask her to repeat the order because i have alot of special requests. All i continued to receive is ""yes we have your order, i ask again to repeat whats in the order and im told "" we have your order.

We ordered from the grilled veggie section of the menu. Veggie Gourmet Taco, there is no description of whats in this taco, Keith told us a little but was obviously new to the details. We got the tacos with out the creamy white sauce only to get our tacos covered with a layer of cheese! When you don't, can't and wont eat dairy this was a huge deal. Someone should have said something or leave a better description on your paper menu.

Their brownie was AWESOME and if I weren't so full, I would eat my lemon bar and tell you how that was.

It is a small burrito which is good for managability, but lil ole me felt like I could eat at least another half, if not a whole! That's actually pretty great for lunch, to not feel stuffed; so I count that as a win. 
However the place was a mess again and the staff provided the background music as they yelled to one another across the dining room, the kitchen, and from condiments to counter. Yeah, I get it, you're a bored teenager on a Sunday shift - get a f'n broom for Christ's sake! 
The condiments area was trashed. Although they had gotten soap and tp into the ladies room since the day before when I alerted them of the issue. That's where they lose a star. I know it's a fast food joint, but shut up and do something productive (God, I sound like an old fart! Lol) 
All this can be overlooked due to the delicious food. Though they'd be better off if they had a manager on duty (or perhaps a new one).",QKfZqCzMdAz9CTYrhC5DjQ,4,4,4,q6Jwve8Gr5DcSdhFFy5SCQ

We were excited when this location opened as we just recently moved to this side of town and were glad to see a new rubios close by. I ordered delivery for my wife one day from this location and it was the norm for rubios.

We just ordered roughly an hour ago for a second time and what a terrible display of quality. 

Ordered chips and guac, chicken quesadilla, steak and shrimp gourmet tacos and a salsa verde taco.

The chicken quesadilla had virtually no cheese, the cheese on the gourmet tacos was completely burnt and tasted as much, the chips stale and onions galore.

My Mom, husband, and I were glad to see Rubio's in our 'hood and gave them a try for dinner tonight. Mom got the chicken street tacos plate, hubs did the burrito especial with steak, and I went with the California bowl. We also got an order of chips and guac to share, which were delicious. My California bowl was good. I went with the grilled chicken, and I think I'd skip the lettuce next time. My one gripe was a hard, dry chunk of rice that I bit into. Gross. Hubs ate his burrito without uttering a word, which means it was awesome. Mom's one complaint was that her chicken tacos were pretty cold.

4377483,2018-04-18,0,5WOE18ldtQ1U0MK5fN2HGQ,"I am utterly disgusted with this location.  I walked in and went to run to the restroom before I ordered.  The restroom smelled like a sewer.  One of the toilets was clogged with human fecal waste.  The other looked like people had used the toiled seat instead of toilet paper to wipe.  There were paper towels on the floor and it clearly had not been cleaned for hours.  Apparently it was ""Taco Tuesday"" so it was packed.  I went up to order.  The ordering clerk was abysmally slow;  she was a sweet young woman but not keeping up with the crowd at all.  I did tell her about the condition of the bathroom.  She said, yes, it always smells in there.   I ordered the Chimicurri combo steak and salmon tacos with the greens/salad.  I ordered at 6.49.  I did not get my food until 7.17.   I obviously had a lot of time to observe things.  One thing I observed was that the young woman I reported the bathroom condition to did not make any effort to report it up the chain and no one went to clean it.  Tables were not being wiped down.  A woman with a young child was sitting watching for her order while her child sat a hightop picking his nose and then putting his hands back on the table.  While I was waiting, I noticed that the floor of the kitchen was also filthy.  There were latex gloves, paper towel and food matter on the floor that were just strewn around.  When I finally got my food, after some customers who had ordered after me because there appeared to be confusion and disorganization in setting up and getting orders out, the container had food and grease smeared all over it because of the sloppy serving and set up of the line cooks.  It was disgusting.  The young woman who took my order asked if I'd like it re-boxed.  I told her no, that I was disgusted by the filthy condition of the restaurant and just wanted to leave.   I got home.  I took a bite of the salmon taco.  The salmon was cold, like never warmed up cold.  The steak was also cold and did not appear to have been warmed up . These menu items were reasonably tasty despite being cold.  The salad, however, was inedible as much of the lettuce was frozen or wilted.  Gross....  I have been to this location one other time in the middle of  a weekday when it wasn't busy.  I ordered two fish tacos and a shrimp verde taco.  It took forever even when it wasn't busy, but this was within a few days of the opening, so I was willing to cut slack.  But what was disappointing was the batter on the fish tacos was really think and almost inedible.  Again, I thought -- give them slack, it's a new location and they'll get things fixed.  Apparently, I was wrong. They have not fixed things.  I am so disappointed because I couldn't wait for this location to open because it's 1 mile from my house.  Now I'm just disgusted and don't think I can eat there again unless someone else tells me it's been brought up to acceptable hygienic and food quality standards.  I hope they get their act together so that I can go back to enjoying my fave fish tacos just a mile from my house.",sWSToKH11v-KEegqnsqxjA,1,0,1,ydHmZSRm0cthCuovKHTJww

Today was the official ""soft opening"" for all Beach Club members who RSVP'D for a time slot in the day. This location opens to the public on March 8th!

The Staff is Super friendly and the food is REALLY TASTY!

The entire menu is great however my favorite is the Cabo plate and it is delicious! 

Thank you Rubio's for being so Awesome!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,3,6,5,T3NERiNLCc1QGUIoVhVLwA

After the soft opening event for their eclub members, I was impressed. 
I loved my great grilled shrimp with bacon burrito, and it was made better than most I've had at any Rubio's. And the chips and salsa were very good, as always!  The staff was really nice and the turnout was large. It was a great welcome to the neighborhood vibe. The wait for my to go order wasn't bad considering the crowd. 

The patio is big, probably the biggest of all the Rubio's. They had some nice lights strung on it, which makes for a cool setting. However, the parking area is messy. There's a one way portion, and that never works out! The entire shopping complex is wonky so I opted to park at the adjacent Tule Springs complex. 

After returning on a Friday evening, I was beyond disappointed. I could tell it was busy, but wasn't expecting a wait of almost 45 minutes! Minutes after I ordered, they started telling customers it was a 45 minute wait. I was also told that's how it is Friday & Saturday evenings. I've been to other Rubio's when it was busy and I doubt they have that long of a wait. They've been open just over a month so let's hope it gets better during those busy times!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,5,1,3,uPfnn81Q8m-OrgB2K4z4Og

We used the Yelp check in offer for a free entree with the purchase of a drink which is an awesome way to try something new. It was also ocean day insulated bag day which is really nice and will be used when grocery shopping this summer or transporting hot food to keep it warm. 

We had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup. 

I really recommend going to Rubios for a lighter refreshing meal, try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers.",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,5,Q9RjsJz7uLJXlLZ1spEY-A
5973777,2018-05-05,0,5WOE18ldtQ1U0MK5fN2HGQ,This was our first time there. I have always heard they had great fish tacos and they really were great!! My wife has food allergies and the employees could not have been more informative and friendly. We eat basically vegan so when we eat fish again we will definitely go back.,Y2jRTW_yFPwd1Nhu5fCCPg,0,0,4,Dn-grWuOgk2mK_uVictXfQ
