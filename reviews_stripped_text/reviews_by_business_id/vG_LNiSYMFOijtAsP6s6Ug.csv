Not New York style or anything but it reminds me of toppers pizza in Ventura county california which is one of my favorites. I definitely recommend it,uIK2Fig70Y2W8BF9ypp88Q,0,0,5,muoJ9H1igZRmqonNtAiA5A

671555,2015-06-25,0,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,Excellent food. My husband and I ordered a pizza and drinks for lunch. Just the owner working and he was friendly and funny. Gave us complimentary garlic cheese bread which was amazing. Fresh garlic and bread only made me want more. Will definitely come back.,H9AjU4X3GV8GQycJVLdP_g,0,0,5,MJbwoP5mPoexYBSOvTLoXg
875464,2015-03-20,0,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,Pizza was off the hook! Made from scratch pizza dough and sauce! Fresh quality ingredients! You can really taste the difference! These guys really know how to make pizza! Great selection of specialty pizzas and subs. I recommend the chicken parmigian pizza and the pastrami sub! If your dining in they even have a nice selection of beers. Definitely a place for foodies! Only negative is that they only have one location right now. When are we gonna get a Pizza Gourmet in the Northwest? Well worth the drive for my family and I.,P1R3HT8VEa5EmYRlvepVrQ,0,0,5,1wlJdN3A8rh3_-hFs3Syww
1118929,2015-01-20,0,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,Owner has owned Pizzerias for over 40 years. His Chicken Parmesan Pizza is a must choice when you are here. Very good thin crisp crust made to order. Whole pies or by the slice...They are located on Fort Apache behind Fanco Lighting....,ER0cyLjd7r1hRdC84uyZ3A,0,0,4,QPS4p52k5rGOZbKYfMQE6g
1907303,2015-02-23,0,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,Just got home with my combination pizza and it is amazing!!!! The crust is crispy and chewy and cooked perfect. The toppings taste so fresh and were so good. This is my new favorite pizza place!,kDCnadjExKRQc2ZgNRKTKw,0,0,5,ouxGbHnq0uQhzAu7d2v3Tw
2010563,2015-01-16,4,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,"Owner is super friendly- he'll tell you all about his decades-long history as a pizzeria owner back in California, and everything that led him to open this store! Interior is nicely decorated, classy for a place that offers by-the-slice and whole pies.

Specialty pizza list is extensive, their best seller is the phenomenal-sounding chicken parmagiana. Lunch specials available by the slice, with toppings, for $5 and $7, with and without a side salad and drink. In addition to pies, they also have sandwiches.

Crust here is unique- crispy, with a touch of garlic, almost cracker-like, and slightly burned with a good char. Fresh toppings are used, and produce in salads is fresh too- not sure if the dressings are homemade though.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,4,3,dssZ96f4WwIM5wZGDEb8EQ
2968548,2015-02-08,0,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,"Great pizza. Back east style. Not greasy. Crisp but chewy crust. Homemade flavor, fresh ingredients. Really nice owner.",AHuQDTGI_5x1FMJE1ecWzQ,0,0,5,C12xgDUCrXE_SJp3_dHo7Q
3141486,2015-01-11,0,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,A hidden gem!  The owner makes pizza to die for.  He told me that he makes the pizza crust and sauce from scratch.  The crust had this light texture that was absolutely delicious!  The vegetables are freshly chopped too!  So many gourmet toppings to choose from!  And the best pastrami sandwiches too!  Highly recommend that you try this place.,d72CJN5kwrfccjAZwCJYMg,0,0,5,JT4XbHTO2J-yxS8vhoSlGw
3645429,2015-03-24,0,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,"This food is amazing!  I've had the pizza, the vegetarian sandwich and the mediterranean salad and everything was excellent.  Super fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The owner is super friendly.  Will definitely be coming back soon.",BUbith0Bjd8mMsmn6e29Rw,0,0,5,JXhh9kLm1ExBZ4eO1jVdlw
3675501,2015-03-26,0,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,My son and I enjoyed the pizzaiolo (all meat). It was awesome! Fresh ingredients and full of flavor. Also the ambiance is nice and service is great! Such a warm and friendly place. We will definitely be going back soon!,2i4n1dxsxQL2C2eRTJwdmQ,0,0,5,Bs6c497rsjQRoSlooBCjPQ
4582396,2014-12-13,2,vG_LNiSYMFOijtAsP6s6Ug,"Quality ingredients, real cheese, great sauce, THIN crusts, REAL ROASTED Garlic (not the minced stuff that comes in a cheap olive/vegetable oil mix, from a bottle or can).

I'm a fan!

This place is only a month old and they are really serving to please. The owner and woman at the counter are truly, lovely humans, also.

Make the stop, definitely worthwhile.

..did I mention the gluten-free crust is yummy??!!",Ahe7lp0DdVfhhCHb8yaXOA,0,0,5,A3d-V2lOHZ9iBswuucGYcg
