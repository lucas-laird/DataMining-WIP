The waitstaff was good and kept on top of everything.  The food was typical Italian, nothing special, though my hubby loved the pizza and I loved the chicken parmagiana. The tiramisu leaves a lot to be desired. I won't order that again.  We fed 8 people, with liquor and dessert (no appetizer) and took the leftovers home for $110. I don't think you can beat the price.

Making a reservation seems to be a difficult task for them. I made it a month in advance, and I called back a week prior to the event to confirm it. Dominique said the reservation wasn't in the book, so she wrote it in. We got to Buca and while we were there, someone from Buca called my cell phone to tell me that because I was running late, they could only hold my reservation another 5 minutes.

The portions of Italian food at this restaurant teeter totter on the line of ridiculous. The dishes are meant for sharing, but seriously, a family of twelve couldn't even dent the spaghetti bowls. My friend Jackie had her cosmetology school graduation party here, and as a party of thirty, we definitely only needed to order about ten dishes. The food is tasty and all of the dishes are recognizable. The walls are lined with all sorts of trinkets and doodads to look at while you wait (even with a reservation, please believe you will wait at least thirty minutes) and has a real old school Vegas/Italian mobster feel. Never go on a weekend evening, it is too much to handle (think back to the party of forty) and the service is backed up to the point of turtle slow. But if you can get in on a weeknight, I suggest bringing an empty stomach!

415164,2017-01-20,0,jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg,"Today's experience was just awful, plain and simple. I don't even know where to begin, but here goes. 

Came here with my hubby for a late lunch before he needed to go back to work.  He ordered the lunch chicken parm and our server said it comes with a side of pasta and you pick another side. My hubby and I both looked at each other like what? Because we had just been in the week before and it came with one side, the pasta being a choice. We asked the waitress if she was sure and she said yes. So he ordered the potatoes, thinking he was getting chicken parm, side of spaghetti marinara AND also potatoes. But when his plate comes out, it's just the chicken parm and potatoes. We asked where the pasta was and she said that's the side you ordered. So a crazy weird mix up there. 

Then I had ordered the dinner size small spaghetti marinara knowing there would be leftovers to take home. But when the waitress read back my order she said the large spaghetti marinara. I had to correct her that I wanted the small dinner size.  When this came out, the bowl was fairly small, not the usual size it supposed to be, and then to top it off, the marinara was runny and non-existent, not the thick marinara that it usually is and there was plenty of liquid at the bottom. Just gross.. I asked the waitress why the size is smaller than usual, and she says that's the size it is. I disagreed on that. But she was long gone, going to get the missing side of pasta for my husband. 

So since the waitress hadn't come back yet I went looking for the manager as we were on a time schedule and that time was running out. I found our waitress behind the bar area and when I asked for the manager, she pointed to a lady at the other end of the bar from where we were. I know the manager heard me ask about a manager but did not make a move toward me.. So I had to walk over and ask if she was the manager, she said yes, and I proceeded to tell her that we needed to leave, the food was all messed up and we did not have time for them to fix it as we needed to go. She did come to the table and saw about the spaghetti and did agree about the marinara being runny and she did agree that the size was wrong and that it should be larger. By this time the waitress had come back with my husband's side of spaghetti marinara. His marinara looked better than mine in that it was thicker on top but it still had liquid on the bottom. Makes you wonder if the cooks understand that you need to STRAIN the pasta before you pour the sauce on top SMH. The manager did see this and agreed that the liquid needed to be strained off his pasta, so she took it to the kitchen. 

Right about this time is when my husband tells me his chicken parm tastes awful, very hard and unplatable. When the manager brought back the side pasta we told her about the chicken and said we just needed to go. We don't want anything, it's all just a mess. She did give us the side of pasta to take.
We just left shaking our heads thinking what in the world just happened here? 

Our last visit the week before was perfect. We came about 9 pm and sat in the bar area and our waitress was so attentive and friendly, service was perfect and the food was yummy (we ordered the exact same thing as today). That's the reason we were craving it again. This time was a disaster and it makes me wonder if we can ever come back. Sad because we love the food. :(",9srMu09UnLA74eN9n7YXMg,0,0,1,NUOTDXC4w4MsigZtyKrOdw

500430,2016-02-14,5,jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg,"This is only the second time we have been to this location since they went corporate.
Not very impressive honestly.

Since they went corporate, the food portions have DEFINITELY gotten smaller, the large would feed ~3 normal people so it's still pretty decent x
Pasta was a bit rubbery but they actually put a decent amount of sauce now!

We got here around 9pm and our server started us off with one loaf of bread.
The bread is actually one of the main reasons we even come here!
We were told (after asking for a refill) that they were baking some in the oven and so we eagerly waited.
That was around 9:30pm

We asked for the check at 10:15pm 
And that's when our server realized he still had not gotten our bread refilled.

It's almost been an hour at this point, I'm pretty sure bread doesn't take that long to bake and it irritated me, but my husband calmed me down and told me that he was probably just busy and had forgotten.

But honestly?
It was not that busy at all. 
Most of the employees were already putting away tables and it seemed like everyone was already in a rush to go home even though they didn't close for another hour.

Our waiter came back and told us that they have just simply run out of bread! (this is after we asked him once again, mind you. He did not even have the decency to tell us as soon as he found out)

Well. I mean, it IS just bread. 
So it really would not have been a big deal at all if we were told in the beginning, but it's just infuriating to feel like you're paying good money to get barely decent service.

Like honestly?
I bet that there WAS bread that was baking, he forgot about us because we are a younger couple, by the time he realized MAYBE they did run out of bread (but there was definitely some left when we first asked)

OR since we had to ask for a third time after paying MAYBE he forgot once again and was too lazy/couldn't be bothered to go grab some???

My husband was feeling very good (we were celebrating our valentines early as we hate the crowds) and so he kept going on and on about leaving a good tip (he's extra generous when he's happy)
We left a 10% tip in the end because we understand that most of the money the servers make is through tips (we don't like to fck anyone over something petty, but we just felt so very offended as we were not even given BASIC customer service)

Also, I just have to say (because it just seems so ridiculous) they stop baking bread at 9:30pm???
When they close at 11pm???

That's very strange.

We only got 1 refill (we had to ask) for the ice tea during our hour long visit (so much ice, it was literally 3 sips, like???)

It took longer then 10min for the server to collect the payment.

We didn't even get a bag.
My husband carried the container in his hand and even as we walked out NOT ONE PERSON offered a bag.
(just seems like the thing to do as an employee dedicated to providing excellent customer service, no?)

EDIT:

Also, the way he talked to us at the end was beyond infuriating.

As we collected the check we had to ASK ONCE AGAIN what's happening with the bread (that god damn bread, man)

WHY could he not just say something like ""I'm so sorry, it seems we've run out of bread. So sorry for the inconvenience""

Then we could have been like
Nah, it's cool. It's just bread (I literally feel like pulling my hair out)

He was just like ""oh yeah man. there's no bread, we ran out or something""

And my husband is just confused and asked him why he told us they were baking some more if they weren't

He's just like ""yeah, I don't know man. I guess not."" (what the actual hell???)

It was actually kind of insulting how he was talking to us. 
His tone of voice suggested that he was tired of us and just wanted us to go away.

Sorry. I tried to be nice when I wrote this last night but damn man.
It's kind of hard to write a nice review about someone who made your blood boil.

Honestly wish I didn't tip at all.

Oh. I might only have 2 check-ins here, but we have been coming semi-regularly to this location since 2012 (1-2x every other month) and I just have to say that the new woman manager (or whatever she is) is also rude as hell x

There was a situation that happened on our last visit and after a few calls to corporate, the manager apologized.
I'm sure she was forced to do so because she sure as hell wasn't very nice when she was ""apologizing"" to my mother-in-law.

I originally gave it a 3 star rating because this was our first date spot and I didn't want to sully that memory (this place used to be special to us) but wow. 
Sorry, but forget that. 
BEING THERE and getting that HORRID customer service is what really ruins that place of nostalgia.

I went to the restaurant to pick up the meal and the people were friendly and attentive.  The ambiance was nice and it smelled fantastic.  I was really looking forward to trying the baked ziti.  I picked up my order and drove home.  When I opened up the bag it had two huge containers and a bag of italian bread.  You get a lot of food for your money.  However, the baked ziti was a complete let down.  Actually the worst pasta I have had in my life.  It looked like they got off to a good start on the dish, they just didn't any sauce to the pasta.  In this huge container of pasta there could only have been 1-2 tablespoons of sauce.  The pasta being baked without sauce was very dry and tasted awful. I just spent $30 on a meal and it's inedible.

Cons: Not great food that upset my stomach, long wait for our table despite a reservation, kind of a small parking lot 

Details: First I will note this was not my first Bucca experience and the food is pretty much the same at all locations. It is better than say something like Olive Garden,  but I still have her better and more authentic Italian food. We went for a family birthday with a large group and had reservations at 7. We got there on time and the hostess said the group sitting at our table was about to leave.  So we waited, and waited. We did not end up getting to our table until almost an hour later. I realize it is kind of awkward for the staff but that is a pretty big delay and it was not packed. The Manager comped our apatiser orders (two I think) so that kind of made up for it. Our waiter was super patient and helpful and the staff came out to sing happy birthday. But something did not sit well in what I ate and I had pretty bad stomach issues that kept me up and going to the bathroom. So that is why I had to give it a three.

Other than that, knowing they were going to have a large party you would hope they would have planned ahead.  We had 1 main server and 1-2 others helping him when they seemed to have a minute.  I would have thought they would have planned ahead to have 2-3 people for such a large group. Our poor server tried but he just seemed miserable the entire time. Yes, it was loud and chaotic due to having a large group of children running around but the kids were going crazy after waiting over a hour for food.  As for drink refills they were no existent.

There were 6 of us, so we ordered 3 entrees. Mom and I ordered a small chicken limone, dad and grandma got the baked ziti with meatballs, and my bro and boyfriend got the penne al forno. We also ordered a caesar salad to share.  

Our server brought us bread with oil and balsamic vinegar to start. The bread was yummy. Soft and warm on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I love to dip it in the balsamic/oil concoction. I ate way too much of this delicious bread. The salad came out shortly after and it was totally dry. We all agreed it needed more dressing so we asked for some on the side. The dressing was pretty bad. It's definitely from the bottle and we were all disappointed. Skip this and try a different salad. 

It wasn't long before the entrees came out. The chicken limone was my favorite. It's chicken breast with capers in a lemon butter sauce. It's tangy and delicious. I think we should have ordered a large size, as the small was just 3 pieces and everyone wanted to try some. Dad and grams had a huge bowl of ziti, with 3 huge meatballs that were as big as my head. Okay I'm exaggerating, but they were pretty big. Sadly, they weren't very flavorful. The pasta was okay. It had fresh ricotta, and mozzarella cheeses with marinara sauce. I didn't try the other dish, but the boys seemed to like it. It was similar to the ziti, but had prosciutto, pepperoni and spicy sausage. We realized how similar the pasta dishes were and wished we would have ordered something else. Oh well, next time. 

We had to have dessert, so we ordered the colossal sundae to share. It comes in a huge cup, with brownie pieces, 6 scoops of ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces, and whipped cream. I don't think there were really 6 scoops of ice cream, and the cup wasn't even filled all the way. We finished this easily. 

For all of the food we ordered it was just about $100 for 6 of us, not including tip. Our server was slow. He kept forgetting to bring us water and other stuff we asked for throughout our dinner. I would say this place is a step above Olive Garden, but not somewhere I would run back to or recommend to anyone.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,6,6,3,w33F3sDIMFukMcQnBIAGZA

Lots of food, loved the salad with granny smith apples and walnuts.
Every inch of the place is covered in italian decorations and the place feels cramped at times, areas are sectioned off into smaller sets of like 6-10 tables, feels like a maze to navigate.
Staff seems overpowering, not sure if it sounds scripted but to have a young guy pushing alcohol and appetizers is not welcoming to me

Might be good for a date if you like the same food or want to feel 'cute'.

I came in with a party of 9 people due to my little brother's birthday. The food was exceptional and I enjoyed it but our server was slow.

(we mentioned multiple times that we were celebrating a birthday) We still received slow service from our waiter. Why? He was too busy talking to his coworkers. I get it. It was slow and he may just wanted to take his ""time."" It bothers me that this particular waiter doesn't believe in exceptional customer service and instead would rather blow off his customers. 
We should have just told the waiter to pack our dessert to-go. It shouldn't have taken 25 minutes to give us our dessert.

To start, I ordered a coffee x2, and I do have to say that the coffee was bold and served my mellow demeanor well.  I am perky as I need to be for work.

My first bite of the Chicken was an absolute wonderful surprise!  I never 
had such a satisfied palet.  It was chicken breast topped with a few articoke pieces, peas, and a lemon sage sauce.  Fettuccine Alfredo served on the side.  Great contrast!   Soft bread was served with an oil and vinegar mix for dipping......WOW, I really liked that.

I already make Thanksgiving breakfast so I have a pass when it comes to the turkey. So, Buca it is and they have never failed me. They always work with my request on substituting the sides for more mashed potatoes which is a big factor why I order our dinner here every year. I also called Thanksgiving morning to change my order from half pans to full and that wasn't a problem. Found out last minute that we'd have more guest than expected. 

Out of all the restaurants that we've tried in the past for our turkey, this has been the most liked by our family and this year so did our guests. We like white gravy on our turkey instead of brown so I just use the gravy from the country fried steak I made for breakfast. 

We are not crazy for stuffing but we like Buca's. Thanksgiving just wouldn't be complete without it anymore. I think I'll make a reservation to eat there next year. 

We got 4 boxes of pumpkin pies with our feast. I gave 2 boxes of them to my brother to take home since his kids liked it so much. By Friday morning, mine was all gone!

The bread was sooo soft and creamy. It was all gone when I woke up Friday morning. I was looking forward to having some with butter :-/

Mashed potatoes basically is loved in this household as much as we love rice. So yes, overall nothing was wasted.

What makes eating here so worthwhile is the $10 off $20 coupons that they always seem to have around, both online, via e-mail, etc. I had three of them in my Entertainment Coupon Book.

I like their fried calamari because they not only include the rings, but also the full body of squid... *crunch, crunch* Their linguine frutti de mare is quite tasty if you are a fan of seafood. I have not had this elsewhere to compare, but I like it, especially the part where I get to open up the clams. 

I have also had the stuffed shells. A picture of these might cause you to start drooling; that is what got me! Unfortunately, I was not fond of them. They are quite spicy (which I was unaware of when I was ordering, that was my bad), but they did not taste good in general and you do not get very many shells.

They do banquet catering and off-site catering. They even have a wedding brochure.

At the end of the meal, he came back around to ask how we enjoyed everything. I was highly impressed. It really showed a sense of compassion towards the establishment to see the Chef come out and ask how everything was. It was completely professional and very much appreciated. 

The entrees are HUGE and even the ""Small"" can easily feed two really hungry people. The Baked Ziti with a side of Garlic Cheesy bread is really good. The Shrimp Florentine is also really delicious! Come to think of it, I haven't tried anything from Buca that I haven't liked.

Long story short, this place is AWESOME! The service, the food, and overall atmosphere is an A+.

3014534,2010-02-18,0,jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg,"I was in the mood for garlic bread and fettuccine, so I went online and googled places to eat in vegas for italian food. Of course the hotel strip restaurants pop up first, but in a 10 best website, Bucca di Beppo was listed for Vegas as an off strip Italian place serving fantastic food.

I had to try it.

About 3 miles away from my apartment there is one, nestled in a corner with a bright neon sign that shows even in daylight. You pull up, expecting parking to be in front of the door, but theirs is located behind the building--meaning a walk to the entrance. I didn't understand why at first, but keep reading.

We walk in and the first thing that will catch anyone's attention are the photos on the wall. There are literally hundreds depicting families, individuals, animals, holidays, sports--you name it, it's on the wall. The setting is classic Italian restaurant--the red cloth and the best part was the menus, which are the placemats. I love the convenience of it in case you want to order more. We decided on two classics--lasagna and fettucine alfredo. Since we arrived at lunchtime, we received free garlic bread with cheese. Their garlic bread is to DIE for, with real thin slices of garlic and fresh oregano and basil. It's fantastic and we ate two basketfuls before our appetizer showed up. We had their stuffed mushroom with proscuitto and mozzarella--a must try. It was creamy, salty sweet, and the bed of pesto cream sauce was incredible. After we devoured the sauce and mushrooms, our main courses came out.

If you've never been here, there are three ways to order: small, large, or ""mio"" which are individual portions for lunch. If there are two of you eating, try getting the mio sizes, because my boyfriend and I assumed that small would be just right, and we were dead wrong. For the price you pay, the portions are incredibly large. Their pasta and lasagna are beautifully presented on traditional plates, family style. At first I was hesitant to cut into anything because it looked so pretty. After taking a picture, we cut small slices of the nine layer lasagna and took a large portion of pasta each. From the small order of lasagna, we had more than half of it left over, and the small slice we did eat was an honest meal in itself! The waitress even asked us if we touched our pasta--that's how much you get.

As for taste, it's divine. Not only was the alfredo sauce creamy, thick, and decadent, but the pasta was cooked perfectly. As for the lasagna--if you are a lasagna person, this place is it! Thick noodles, layers of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and a tomato sauce that is to die for! It's sweet but balances with enough acidity, and the chunks of tomato in there are so good to just scoop and eat alone. We also ordered a 1/2 pound meatball, and I assumed that the sauce would be the same sauce as the lasagna. It's not. They have sauces for each specific dish and the meatball sauce was heaven! The meatball itself was so good that it was devoured in a minute, literally.

They gave us a free gelato cone which is small but after a meal like that, quite enough! I reccommend trying their pistachio and triple berry. It's yummy! For a price ticket of 60 dollars, this place is not only quite affordable for a party of four (yes that price is ordering food for 4-6 people), but for two people on a romantic date. I highly reccommend that you stop here and eat some great food if you haven't yet. It's worth every penny and definitely every bite.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,0,0,4,_UEOv60kZ_jZamNCEluY8g

I'd give this restaurant no stars if I had the choice. We arrived at Buca for our reservation for a party of 17, for my brothers 21st birthday. The server took 20 minutes before she even came over to take a drink order, then when taking my brothers order, refused to sell him liquor. We thought it was a joke, until she explained that their new ""company policy"" was that they can't serve liquor to anyone with a vertical ID. His ID is 2 weeks old, brand new, government issued ID. She had the manager come over after we complained about this policy and how ridiculous it was. She then told us that she will not serve him alcohol, regardless of his birthday or his ID, and told us that if we gave him a drink, they'd kick our party out of the restaurant. Unbelievable. And to top it off, the server walked passed our table three times, over the course of 15 minutes before coming back to us, and all she asked was ""so what are you going to do?"" At that point, we got up and left.

Will never return to this location, let alone this chain.

I was ambivalent about the decor. Sure, it was somewhat humorous in a self-deprecating But-Hey-I'm-Italian-I-Can-Take-It sort of way. It was good for a few chuckles and made for an interesting walking tour room to room. It certainly was visually interesting.

The food was well done for every dish. Portions were generous, too. I can honestly find no fault (excepting the price) with the food. I'd eat their Lemon caper Chickens with Artichokes again without a doubt. And I thought the Sangria was subpar (I'd call it a red wine spritzer!). 

I couldn't figure why water was seeping all over the table, until we noticed the glass has a crack from top to bottom. Yikes. And don't waste my time inspecting the glass at the table like a CSI detective. Just whisk the sucker away and apologize. I didn't crack it! So service is rather weak.

Dionna, our server, was quick on her feet and patient.  She repeated our order after ordering.  For an evening such as this, it's deserving of the servers to get a little more tip - especially if they were accomodating... And still offered dessert even though diners know one can feel like a stuffed turkey eating here.

As with my SoCal review, we can never get away from having their spaghetti and meatballs.  This never fails.  Although we do think about another type of pasta, discuss it a few seconds; the result is still their spaghetti with meatballs bigger than the size of a tennis ball.  

But we did throw in something we hadn't yet tried- their stuffed chicken parmigiana.  Lesson: if having stuffed chicken parmigiana, omit ordering any appetizers.  You'll be satisfied with their warm bread and olive oil.

This place has almost a nostalgic feel to it in the fact that there are lots of large family sized tables filled to the brim with generations of families dining and laughing. The restaurant itself is decorated with old Italian decor and has a real homey feel to it.

Now, my view may be a little skewed because I was here on a first date and it ended up being one of the best dates I've ever been on. This may have made the food taste better but in reality it was pretty damn good food at a reasonable price. I didn't realize that the ""regular"" portion was for 2+ people and was a bit worried at ordering a $20 Veal Parmigiana.

I admit that I don't ever eat at Buca unless I have a coupon, but come on they send them in the mail all of the time! I'm also signed up on the e-mail list so they send offers that way too. I received a $20 off with purchase of 2 entrees and wanted to take advantage of it since I hadn't had Buca in a while, and it was better then the $10 off they generally send.  

We arrived just after 5 pm. The parking lot was pretty empty and when we got inside we were able to have our pick of where to sit since they weren't busy. We must have just beat the dinner rush coming in because the restaurant soon filled up. Our server brought some complimentary bread that I had to force myself to put down to save room for my meal that was coming. I could have eaten the bread all to myself! Since Buca serves family style meals the portions are big. They have small and large sizes, but don't let the small size trick you into thinking it isn't much because it is plentiful. 

I ordered the ""Penne Arrabbiata"" priced at $19.99 for the small. It had spicy Italian sausage on top of the pasta as well in the sauce. I wasn't crazy about this dish simply because it had too much sausage flavor. I like sausage, but don't like it overpowering certain dishes. The sausage that was on the pasta also was a bit dry. The other dish I ordered was the ""Baked Lasagna"" priced at $19.99 for the small. This is so good! The meat sauce it tasty and the cheesy goodness it what makes it! There is ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan cheese in this lasagna. Very comforting and delicious! 

You can phone your order for pick-up if you don't feel like eating inside. Buca has several options as far as catering goes. You can pick up ""Party Pans"" (they have a menu for this) if you are having a gathering at your house and don't want the fuss of cooking. They offer different sizes and menu options broken down to how many people you are entertaining. They also offer a catering service where you can have Buca deliver the food along with tablecloths, plates, utensils, etc. so this is probably a great choice for a corporate party. They also have banquet rooms (some themed) and offer group menu options. When the server told me about the themed rooms I wondered what they could be like since there are pictures of naked people hanging on the regular dining walls. I crack up every time wondering how they get away with that since Buca is supposed to be a place to bring the familia, but it is just part of the character and I guess it works!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,26,25,4,NoTrlw7jJcSz0sDpnmOPcw

However they still offer ravioli's, which are extremely good.  I also ordered the baked ziti & spaghetti.  I've had much better baked ziti, so I won't order that from here again, and I also made the mistake of ordering the plain Marmara spaghetti instead of the spaghetti with meat sauce.

We were seated and waited an extremely long time to even see our server. Although we were ready to order our server took only our drink order and ran away to put in our drink order. Our drink order was simply a bottle of wine. We didn't see her again to place our order for another 5 minutes. 

So we order the lasagna with garlic bread and soup. The soup arrives just barely warm with the complementary bread which wasn't even warm. 

Finished the soup and started waiting for the meal. Oh did I mention the wine still had not arrived. I guess the bar was backed up oh wait it was a bottle of wine. 

I try not to completely judge a place based on one server. So the food arrived and it was bland. 

Food wasn't great and bad service but that could be a one time thing but on the way out in the foyer there were two employees across from each other having a discussion. We passed between them and out the doors. They simply continued their discussion without so much as acknowledging the departing customers. 

So it wasn't and individual server having a bad night. This is obviously poor management.",PeKqZ414yF7WuKfqbpOlAg,4,0,1,h31SMBbsuVUEV1pzoz7z3A

3849207,2016-09-19,0,jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg,"I used to love eating here, but tonight was the last time I'll ever go there again. My boyfriend & I decided to go to use a gift card I'd gotten awhile ago. I made the mistake of telling our server (Deanna) this when she asked if we were celebrating anything special. Once she heard that, her kind and helpful manner went out the window. We ordered our drinks & appetizers around 6:45 had almost finished them at 7:15 before we had to get her attention from the table next to us to order our meals. 
I am not an impatient person, & have worked in the service industry for almost 10 years, but it was getting to the point where we felt like we were an inconvenience to her. She didn't bring us our food, extra napkins, or anything after taking our meal orders...it was all bussers, which I have to say were amazing & took great care of us. 
We asked for the check, mind you every time I had to ask her for something was when she was helping the table next to us, who was a party of 6 that she sat 15 mins after us, & got them done & out almost a half hour after us. 
Once we got the check it only got worse. She left it sitting with us for another 10-15 mins, came and snatched it when she finally came by, and then stayed in the back with our gift card & debit card for another 10. When my boyfriend asked what was taking so long she said it was because she had to run the gift card and then transfer the difference? When she finally brought  it back she mumbled ""sorry it took so long but it's because of your gift card"". 
When we left I checked the receipt because the gift card was for $50. She had only ran it for $46.25. Odd right? So I checked our bank account, & she had in fact charged my debit card twice. We went in and spoke to the manager & explained what all had happened, & when she called Deanna over, she claimed that she thought our debit card was the gift card. 
I don't buy it, she was awful to us because she assumed since we had a gift card that we wouldn't tip, then blamed us for our checkout process being so long on the gift card, & then when all was said and done, you didn't know which one was the gift card?! Sorry but no. Save yourself the time & headache & go elsewhere. I'd like to believe the best about people, but it was clear that this girl took it upon herself & decided that we were an inconvenience & wouldn't tip her because we had a gift card. When in fact we are quite the opposite. Even if we were the worst customers & just taking advantage of a cheap meal, that's not for you to decide! Nor is it your place to make paying customers who come to YOUR choice of profession, feel unwelcome & at fault for your own greed & bad attitude.",fmMoKY19jG3JnFMY_u90BQ,0,0,1,IFRNP8LFFlBtWeaYKpVc8A

We would be in the area for an appointment and decided to go here after for an early dinner.  As form the portions, we're at the age where early dinners and take home boxes rule!  :)

I had checked the menu online and knew pretty much what we wanted before going there.  Our server, Casey, was a gem!  She asked us if we had been there before and answered questions and gave advice as we asked.

We ended up ordering a small portion of their summer tricolore salad.  It was a good starter of sliced tomatoes, mozzarella, and avocado rings topped with fresh basil and olive oil.  A very summery kind of salad.

For our main course, we chose the spicy chicken rigatoni described on the menu as chicken breast, garlic, crushed red pepper and peas in a spicy rosa sauce.  This came with a recommendation from a friend and it was a good suggestion.  (Thanks Shawn H.)  The bowl of rigatoni was huge.  Note that the menu states that a small order is meant for 2 or more and a large order is meant for 4 or more.  We had generous servings at the restaurant, not overdoing it though, and we brought home a container for an additional meal.  The take home packaging even had a reheating instruction sticker on it.  

Since we didn't overdo the main course, we had room for dessert.  They have a couple of desserts that have single serving versions (well actually they're also for 2 people in reality).  We got their single serving version of the colossal brownie sundae.  It came with two brownie pieces, two scoops of ice cream and some whipped cream.  A very nice dessert for two people to share.

I was very pleased with this first visit to a Buca.  Considering the amount of food, the price is reasonable.  Service was outstanding.  Thanks, Casey!  We'll be back to try some other things.  And, by bringing home a box, it saves me from having to cook a meal on a future day.  Score!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,7,4,TnS95DCKfbTV8XG0QzcwLg

The parking lot is pretty small as well as the restaurant itself. When you first walk in, you're greeted by the maitre'D. The waiting area is kind of small with two benches for convenience and comfort. Actually, it's not that the area is small but more cluttered.

All the dishes are available in small and large portions. Small portions are suitable for 3 person parties while the large portions can (supposedly) satisfy 6 people.

Environment: From ceiling to floor, the walls are decorated with Italian decor and pictures of their glory days including ""Miss Buca"" of several years. The seating areas look antique which correlates well with the rest of the facility.

Waiter:waitresses; not too bad. We ordered a lot if food and that have been the underlying reason for her many visits to our table. Regardless, she did a good job of making sure my buddies were happy and satisfied. Most impressive was the fact that she memorized our entire customized order. No pen and pad. Just memorization.

Food: Started off the night with French bread with wine and vinegar for dipping sauce. Nothing unusual or extraordinary. For appetizer, we ordered the large spicy calamari which is basically the ""fried calamari"" dish cooked with banana peppers for a nice kick. Slices of roasted banana peppers were used to garnish the fried seafood. Marinara mixed with garlic sauce added the perfect salty taste to complement the spicy and flavorful morsels of squid. For entrees, we had 3 dishes, pizza and two chicken selections. The pizza was a thin crust masterpiece covered with a small layer of fresh tomato sauce and melted cheese. Sausage and roasted tomato were scattered on top of the rectangular shaped pizza. The crust was crunchy on the bottom and slightly chewy on the top. The cheese was perfectly melted so that with each bite, you had to check your chin to make sure no residual cheese remained. Nothing spectacular about the sausage. The first chicken dish was slightly fried and covered in pesto sauce. The chicken was stuffed with mozzarella which oozed out with every bite. YUM! The last chicken dish was unremarkable in every way. Covered with a white cream sauce and capers.

Drinks: diet pepsi (they don't have coke).

We went on a Friday night and the place was maybe a quarter occupied. Used to be jam packed with a wait on a weekend night. 

The 3 of us ordered the smaller sizes of one appetizer, one salad, one main pasta dish, and one drink. Plus tax and tip = $75 = totally not worth it!

The bread they brought out was half a loaf of some lame ass generic 50 cent roll. They used to serve at least two different kinds of specialty bread. The marinara sauce served with the fried calamari was watery and served in a tiny cup. The chopped antipasto salad used to be full of olives, peppercinis, and large slices of meats and cheeses; it was mostly lettuce this time. The frutti di mare linguini used to be made with generous amounts of seafood; it was very soupy and contained so little of everything this time.

Again, the decor was still fun and the taste was the same, but we were extremely disappointed with every other aspect. They even went cheap on the napkins.

But it was a different story here, for yesterday's lunch visit. We both had sandwiches- mona panini & smash meatball burger (split it- always been our thing) and our son had a kid's meal (for 10 and younger) @ $4.99, pepperoni pizza- it was huge! Six choices, the others were: mac & cheese, spaghetti w/ meatball, fettucine alfredo, cheese pizza, and chicken parmigiana. Total was $25.41. 

I had a gift card to use. We also checked the menu online. I called to make sure that they were open so I called and got a live person. Yes, we did our homework. (On a past holiday we found out the hard way that the restaurant was closed.)

Jessica was our server. She was quick, attentive and very nice. She checked in on us numerous times. And she asked us frequently if we were good or if we needed anything else. She also offered to sign up my husband because it seemed like he was bumped off of the email list. Not many other customers which was a surprise. Not that we were complaining, because our food was prepared pretty quickly. 

We started off with yummy bread with the oil, balsamic vinegar & herb combo. I had to stop myself or else I wouldn't be hungry for my lunch. The mona panini was delish. All of the flavors really worked together. And the bun was a good size, not too much bread, just enough.  The meatball sandwich was really good too. I liked them both but maybe the panini edged out the meatball sandwich just a smidge. The garlic fries were perfect, crisp, with just enough seasoning. Not greasy or mushy, I don't like that.

Granted, I did come in with a HUGE party.  It was where our friends decided to gather to eat after their special occasion.  It had to of been about 50 people.  BUT you would think a restaurant that serves such large family style dishes, would be able to handle a party of that many, apparently for one of their staffers, not. 

So our food was basically preordered and the menu was set for us.  Food was okay, it wasn't spectacular thats why I can't even describe it.  I just wanted to review our service though. 

One of the waitresses, was frazzled from the very beginning.  Myself and a few other people in the party observed it early in our dinner.  I mean, she couldn't get the drink orders straight, kept forgetting to bring us simple utensils to eat our food, plates, too, it also took forever to bring our drinks to us.  When we were finally given the bill for our drinks, after requesting it 3x, we immediately gave our card since we had no cash to pay for it.  She came back and said I'm sorry I charged it out to cash, can you pay it by cash?  What?! Your mistake, you fix it.  I mean, why would you even bring that back to your customer.  It didn't upset us or anything, but it seems compared to her other coworkers that served flawlessly, she could not compare.  So our waitress, frazzled.

There were 20 people in our group and we had one of their sections equipped with five booths and a long table. The space we were given was rather small and the booths were very uncomfortable. The cushions gave way that you could feel the reinforcements under the seating and there was very little room between the table and benches. It was also difficult to interact with anyone other than those at your booth, so it defeated the purpose of having a large group space (the area is not intended for a gathering of that sort). Service was pretty good, but not spectacular. My fiancé's boss had to constantly flag down the server to refill beverages, so I even suggested to leave the pitchers (the server didn't do that though and we continued the refill game throughout the evening).

Apparently there was bread, but none made it to our table, so I didn't have the opportunity to try it. So, our meal began with Bruschetta. The bruschetta itself was pretty tasty and it was served on a large garlic bread loaf, which also had good flavor. However, it was extremely difficult to eat since the slices were enormous and the bread was challenging to cut with butter knives. I've never seen bread slices served that large, with or without something on top of it. Our next appetizer was the Chopped Antipasto Salad with pepperoni, red onions, pepperoncini, cucumbers, Roma tomatoes, kalamata and green olives, provolone, feta, Gorgonzola, and lettuce in their signature Italian vinaigrette. This was good. A bit heavy on the dressing, but otherwise really great combination of ingredients.

For our entrees, we had Fettuccine Alfredo, Spaghetti with Meat Sauce, and Chicken Marsala. I tried just a bite of the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was fine; it's not something I would ever order since it's much too boring. The Spaghetti was unsurprisingly overcooked and the meat sauce was all right. Still, the most eatable dish. The Chicken Marsala was blah. Chicken breast was overcooked (dry) and the sauce was too sweet and tasted too much of wine, in a bad way. It was a good thing I wasn't hungry or I would have been pretty cranky. 

Dessert was Tiramisu and Double Dark Chocolate Cake. I went straight for the tiramisu since it is one of my favorite desserts, but alas, I was disappointed. The dark rum soak was overpowering and the harmonious flavors of espresso, cocoa, and Mascarpone were mangled. The chocolate cake earned a shrug.

Needless to say, I didn't enjoy dinner very much. I mean, the best item was the salad. Positive notes: I like the family-style dining, their decor is fun, and with a better seating situation, I think it's a great atmosphere for a family/friends gathering.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,5,1,2,d7y-Nsw0DM2Dzeq2zU2eKA

I am not used to that when going to a chain especially with such a large party. To be honest a big reason might be because they don't automatically add gratuity on to the bill .

Aside from the poor service from our waiter the food was terrible. I've had some of the best Italian food there is, and this by far is the worst! This will be our last time at Buca di Beppo.

That lady I flagged down was a lot nicer and brought us to-go boxes (but without the plastic bag). The original waitress finally came back and gave us our receipt and said ""Let me get you a bag"" and went off again. If she would have given me a second to speak, I would have said no thanks.

I have ordered from them 4 times, 3 of which the order was WRONG.
Food was COLD, bread BURNED and STALE.
Attitude of the cashier was less than friendly.
They got my order wrong, but, instead of just giving me the large pizza, rather than the correct small pizza, they cut it into thirds.  
I got 1/3 of a cold pizza, while some other unsuspecting customer got a cold, old pizza.
I told them I would pick order up AT 6:45.  It had been made early, so it was cold, needed to heat it in microwave.
The online system was out of order.  I called in the order, cashier confirmed SMALL, but they made LARGE.
I heated in microwave and I live 2 blocks away.
Third Time is NOT a charm.  I is a signal to go somewhere else.

5011371,2015-07-27,0,jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg,"I've lived in Las Vegas for 3 years now, and only just last week did I hear about this restaurant from some co-workers. Four of us went to dinner on a Sunday at 7, and the first thing I noticed was the full parking lot. I expected it to be half empty, at best, at the end of the weekend. The second noticeable thing about this place was the interior decor. I've read some of the other reviews on here about the decor, and while I can see why some patrons didn't care for it, I loved it. I loved the black and white photos on the walls, the antique furniture in the lobby, and the empty, multi-colored wine bottles in the racks on the ceiling. All of that, along with the Greek-style statues, gave the place an old-world, homey feel. I couldn't wait to taste the food.

Since there was four of us, we each ordered a small entree. I was able to sample the chicken saltimbocca, chicken marsala, shrimp florentine, and fettucini supremo. Simply put, all of it was incredible. Until now, I though Olive Garden was the best Italian I'd ever had, but this place makes OG look like McDonald's. The portions, even on a small entree, were more than enough for four of us, and we each took home plenty of leftovers.

And then, as if that wasn't good enough, I decided to sample the dessert menu. I ordered the Italian creme cake, the cheesecake, and my coworkers ordered the chocolate chip cannolis. In my limited foodie experience, most restaurants have the desserts delivered and kept frozen until ready to serve. They taste no better than what you find in the freezer section of your local grocery. This was most definitely NOT the case with Buca di Beppo. Of those three that we sampled, my favorite was the cheesecake. Really good cheesecake is hard to find, and this place more than did it justice. The giant slice came with raspberry topping and hazelnuts. It was hard not to be rude and devour the whole damn thing in front of my co-workers. The Italian creme cake was also to die for, and the cannoli was amazing. (I'd never actually had a cannoli before, but, judging by the other desserts, I'm sure this place would take the blue ribbon if it put them a contest.)

All in all, I was thoroughly satisfied with my dining experience at Buca di Beppo. and, if I could afford it, I would eat here every night.",0tjnYEVvuNvim39AouXVFQ,0,1,5,LyDcI7_XtRihHQjcIcfuqQ

We also got a $10 off coupon in a ValPak so why not? I've been to the one in Universal Citywalk in LA a few times for birthdays and always had a decent night. 

They walked us through the kitchen which my BF liked and said the other location didnt take him the two times he's gone. I definitely respect this that you get to see a clean kitchen and they are proud to pass people through it before seating them.

We ordered a  Penne San Remo (chicken breast, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, peas,cream sauce). Big family serving even for a ""small"". Pretty decent dish, just needed a little salt and it was right on.

They gave us a bread basket and bread was cold....I'm noticing this a lot in restaurants lately- refrigerated bread served as is. Anyways it was decent for sopping up cream sauce.

Service was decent, the lady was on refilling drinks and checking up on us. 

Overall, alright spot. I think it would be better if we showed up for lunch since they have individual portions or come when we got a hungry group of friends.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,2,4,XexVJrDsYLK1CUWdEWY9fA

Firstly, we waited about 10 mins before our server came. We never got utensils since they were still 'folding' them.... I personally had to steal them from an empty table.

We ordered the cheesy bread with spinach and tomatoes, Apple gorzongola salad and baked ziti. Also got a wine... They didn't have Fizz 56 which I wanted to try so I ended up settling for white zin (15 min process to find out that this wine didn't exist today... Although my husband's beer came out quickly). 

Don't buy the cheesy bread. It is seriously the same as the other bread with a crap ton of cheese... Barely any spinach or tomatoes.

The salad was ok. Not as good as described. 

The baked ziti wasn't as good as anything we have eaten from Olive Garden. It was ok, but not great.

Our server was undeniably slow, although she was quite nice when she came by (Sheri). Had to ask the bus boy for water, and never received a refill (she never came by until the check). So whatever. First and last time at this place!

We had a 7 PM reservation and were seated immediately. They originally had us at two separate tables, but with 6 kids under the age of 12, we were able to squeeze comfortably into one large table. This made things more intimate, and I picked a middle spot at the table and was still able to converse with everyone around the table, including my 3 year old nephew.

One server tackled our entire party, and she did a great job. There was somewhat of an extended wait for the entrees to come out, but none of us minded because it gave everyone a chance to catch up and we had some appetizers and salad already.

Food: Fried mozzarella, fried calamari, apple gorgonzola salad, chicken parmigiana, lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs, and the colossal brownie sundae. I like the lasagna, the portion is huge, but we had enough people to finish it off.  My wife and I enjoy the apple gorgonzola salad especially.

I actually stopped eating spicy foods because the only way I could tell if something is spicy, is if I start to sweat. As I was eating it I asked my wife if it were spicy because I was sweating, she took 3 bites and could not eat it because of how spicy it was. I ate it and all the left overs, because it wasn't gross, just boring. And for 33 bucks for a large pasta to be boring kind of sucks. Now, the cannolis. They were good no complaints about the taste, but, they only filled the edges of the shells with the cream. I understand they give out 3 cannolis and they need to not waste the money, but, give me 2 cannolis completely filled and please maybe cut out some of the chocolate sauce drizzle. Like I said, this review could be biased because I lived in NYC before coming here and the crappiest Italian food there is better then the food I had here.",aDQchWgYerSDWUSA_E-jRg,0,0,2,f9pKlv9Yc4dJn9jO0vcGsA

Back then we thought the pricing was a little high for the amount of food you get. Just went back and realized the prices have gone up about $5 an entree which is family style. But the portion sizes haven't gotten bigger. The stuffed prosciutto chicken is hardly stuffed with anything and it was dry as a bone. I'm beginning to think the prices were raised to sort of offset the $10 coupon that you can get quite frequently. Example of over pricing. $39.99 for large chianti braised short ribs. The are good, but you get 3 small pieces to share with your family.  Same goes for all the meat entrees. The pasta, salad and pizza are good and that's what we will stick to. I want to give it 1 or 2 stars for the pricing.",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,0,0,3,PVBctZXK8i9LApQLZmnCEA

We asked for sauce ""it's being cooked right now"" WHAT?! We had no pepper flakes at the table and had to ask for them and share them with another table. The service was ok. I hate this place it's a huge rip off. $25 for a pasta bowl which had about $1 worth of pasta and about 1/2 can of tomatoes at best.

We got take out and ordered the Caesar salad, garlic bread, chicken parm, and baked rigatoni. The Caesar was fine, the garlic bread was SO garlicky that ONE piece was enough. The chicken parm we thought was going to be promising based on looks alone because the chicken pieces were HUGE tasted like those frozen chicken patties you get out of the grocery store. It did not taste like chicken at all, more like a breaded piece of rubber. Then the baked rigatoni... we can always count on the baked rigatoni to be good. Nope. It was dry.. crunchy... no flavor. I'm not kidding the WORST thing ever. This almost $80 meal I got was so bad,  I went to pasta idea across the parking lot the next day to try to forget that whole thing happened.

Came here for some real Italian lasagna and got something less than adequate. Such nice appointments all around this place and very home-like, warm feel with good waitstaff. But the food... My goodness. 

The bread - cold and uneventfully tasteless.
Lasagna - breaking down the ingredients 
Tomato sauce - excitingly visual but way too sweet
Cheeses - mediocre and unappealing.
Pasta - equally bland like something from a large grocery store.
The meat - like something from a popular chain taco fast food joint.

Well while eating, I discovered wax paper still on the prosciutto.  I informed our waitress who apologized and went to find out what it was.  While she was gone, we found several more pieces.   The manager came out, apologized, explained what it was, offered us a replacement entree and comped our meal.  There you have it, a well handled mess.  We love Buca, the portions are worth it, the prices are value for the amount of food you get, and usually the quality is above average, especially for a chain.

Also some of the cushions need new springs or should be replaced as they sink in a lot in some places. We had to be reseated multiple times because of it and we both way under 150lb.

He ordered the Family Style Lasagna and the other was for the Spaghetti with meat sauce and he added Shrimp.


The service is always really good , There are still better Italian restaurants but for a chain this food isn't that bad and the prices are not too bad either.

We never have any left overs because my husband and son are big eaters and they eat whatever is left.

The famous Buca di Beppo  ""chef's table in the kitchen""  isn't allowed in Clark County, so it's sort of a table next to the kitchen with a big window looking in.

Food is bland, tasteless, and everything costs extra. Read that: Everything. Extra sauce, extra pasta, refill on the bread will cost you more so hold that thought.
 Service is OK, big portions and big prices and they do run out of menu items.

If you have one of those big families where ya wanna pass the baby(s) around the table, and the kids can get a little louder than normal and do pre-dinner table top activities like coloring and such,,, you can talk at above normal levels which is standard for any Italian family,, make some noise,, it's OK here.

Wish they'd improve the flavor of the menu. Probably comes frozen to the location from the company and is warmed and served. It ain't fresh cooked, you can count on that.

I dunno,,, like I said, we eat here by default and it has it's place for families and groups,, but if it was just the wife and I we'd go some place else and get much better for the money.",BCy-Hut597GtNvlnx3pB4Q,2,0,3,uudSgPE2JKwAgT7xsT9XfA

Food wasn't too amazing in my opinion and I'll head over to Nora's for Italian food. The chicken we got was bland and they probably assumed the lemon sauce would do all the seasoning or something. The Alfredo was just ok, again bland and not enough sauce. Wished it was more rich and creamy. I didn't try anyone else's dishes but I didn't hear anyone say that they were good nor bad.
