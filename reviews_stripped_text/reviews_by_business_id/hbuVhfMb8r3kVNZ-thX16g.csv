Everything we get here, like Pad Thai and Orange Chicken, is savory and flavorful, like you want to come back for more (I mean, I could add white rice [which comes with it if you order an entree like Orange Chicken] to the Pad Thai to get a tamer flavor). You should see their large Shrimp Fried Rice - there was a good amount of jumbo shrimp in there, and it's certainly addicting. 

The first time we ordered from them, the lady seemed nice. Our second order, which was a phone call pickup order, my mom perceived her as rude and lacking customer service, but I don't expect good customer service from a restaurant soldiered by about two people. Case in point, I call to order from now on. She likes it quick and to the point. 

To conclude, if you're close by their location, they serve deliciously unhealthy Chinese - Thai food to satisfy those burning cravings. :)",OtCDBnspqcYs6igSmLqxBg,0,0,4,AgQktOAQ9fhtDMtoPmAElg

I set this account up so I wouldn't have to bother about always having cash, the fact that he would get so angry and forceful...was a bit scary. He was acting like he was going to hold my food back!? I am actually just realizing how upset he made me. I will not ever order from there again...I mean they are like 5 min from my apts. And that man was trying to intimidate me for a 10% tip!

The lady was sitting at the counter on her phone when I walked in, and greeted me with only a ""hi."" Ordered food to-go at roughly 840-ish -  Egg drop soup,  veggie egg rolls, potstickers, and chicken panang curry - then immediately went home, which is 10 minutes away. 

Now, I'm normally not picky, but the food was terrible.  The egg drop soup and egg rolls tasted like any Asian restaurant egg drop soup and egg rolls. The potstickers was mediocre - the meat look questionable because it had some slight pink to it or it could be my eyes.  

Now, the chicken panang curry is the dish I was looking forward to. It looked decent,  had mostly veggies, some chicken, and the curry soup was somewhat watery, but tell me why ... it tasted like spoiled milk. I know most panang curry has coconut milk, but it tasted just like spoiled milk, and I'm now paying the price after several bites later ... on the toilet.

I've eaten at a few Little Dumplings around town and this is probably the best. I would say their specialty is more the Chinese side of things, it's good. It's fresh. 
On the Thai side, eh, not so much. I judge a Thai place by it's most popular dish - Pad Thai. It's the like a hamburger is to an American roadside grill. If you have that down, then you're golden. 
The Pad Thai here is so-so. Mas y menos. Noodles are a little limp, sauce kind of overwhelms. It's a good value though...at $7.95 it's two meals easy.

The entrees came with plain white rice. You have to pay extra if you want fried rice or any other option. The Mongolian beef could easily be described as salted onions with a few pieces of beef. Not what you would normally get or at least not what we thought we'd be getting. The teriyaki chicken can easily be mistaken for broccoli beef if we didn't also open up that container. The flavor wasn't very good, I could probably make it at home without problem. The broccoli beef had more carrots then I've ever seen. Beef on this one was fatty and hard to chew. 

As for the appetizers. The ""crab"" Rangoon consisted of small over cooked cream cheese only pieces. No crab flavor, no seasonings. Just Rangoon....where was my crab meat? The fried wontons were also hard and were not seasoned very well. 

All of the food arrived barely warm so ordering delivery isn't a good suggestion. We through a good 90% of it away for being over cooked or poor tasting and ended up ordering pizza. 

Also, the delivery man was very rude. He rang the doorbell until I opened it. Not like once or twice but repeatedly until I made my way down stairs to open the door. It's not like I was being slow either. Then when I opened the door he was on his phone with earphones in talking to someone. He handed me a large paper receipt and pen. Didn't say anything (I knew I had to sign so I did). I handed it back to him and he handed me my food. He again didn't say a thing to me. No thank you, no repeating of my order, nothing. He began to walk away and looked at the receipt and began to turn around almost to discuss his tip. I closed my door and just happened to look through my peep hole in the door and he was still standing there all angry like, like I did something to him. ""Sir you got a tip and didn't say a word. Be thankful I am a nice person""
