I am mostly restaurant vegetarian and it's hard to find pho that is not either a beef or chicken broth.  Their's (I think called tofu/vegetable) is very flavorful, salty, and comes with a platter of very fresh veggies to arrange in your soup as you like.  My husband and I each get a large bowl- it is huge and takes forever to eat!  Their fresh spring rolls (the cold ones) are good, but not the best i've had.  The sweet sauce that comes with them is great.  Major bonus points for a place that offers a veg pho on par with the traditional beef one!",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,2,1,4,vwmo-62vWfCKnR97895Opw
4750,2011-06-29,4,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"There are a lot of pho restaurants in this town. This one is my favorite for 3 reasons. 

Reason #1 - It's got the word ""pho"" in the name, so you know it's good.

Reason #2 - They are from ""Saigon"", where pho was invented, so you know they know what they are doing here.

Reason #3 - The number ""8"" is a very humbling number to give ones self. It's better then 5 and not as douchey as 10.  So you know they've got class.

Yup, the humblest, most authenticest, phoiest restaurant on Eastern. Much better than Pho Saigon 7 and less pretentious then Pho Saigon 9.

My lil one ordered the BBQ chicken and it was delivered to us In a matter of minutes after ordering . After cutting into the chicken I realized that the chicken had been cooked earlier in the day or yesterday perhaps ( def not fresh) and reheated once we ordered . I asked the Waiter bout this and he informed me that "" we cook the chicken half way and finish the cooking when ordered, otherwise it would take 30 min or so to cook"". Now I know it doesn't take more then 5-7 min to cook a thin slice of chicken . The chicken is a direct reflection of how they run their kitchen .

Typically we like to share our pho w/ my son rather than ordering him his own bowl. So we'll ask for an extra bowl and along w/ the extra bowl we asked for, they bring out scissors (to cut the noodles and the meat) and plastic silverware.

On complaining to the server about the foul taste and requesting to change the dish, they blatantly refused. I told them that I had not tried the dish, and the smell told the entire story. They refused a refund or change to a different dish, and had me reorder a second dish and pay for both.

But as the others said, service is in the pits.  Once we were seated and they completely forgot to take our order for like 15 minutes-then we left.  Be sure to order two drinks and water for yourself, because once they throw you food  on your table they'll never check up on you.

Well.... It sure was a mistake! We walked in and they asked us how many. We told them two, and they walked us over to a table set down two glasses of water and walked away. Came back a minute later and set down two menus with our napkins on top, then walked away again. After about 5 minutes they come back over and ask us what we wanted. We hadn't decided just yet and we asked for another minute and the reply was, ""Okay, just yell for me when your ready."" And then she walked away. 
Okay?! By now they've lost any chance at a tip.
So after we decided to get #'s 69 and 70 we looked around and they came over took our order and about 10 minutes later our food came out! It looked good! Well!.... It wasn't. It was a HUGE disappointment! The shrimp on both plates were dry like last weeks left overs that they nuked for a minute and tossed in our dish. Our pork was a little on the burn side and had a funk nasty after taste, but it wasn't terrible enough to not eat... And my roll was fairly uncomfortable to eat. We'd have to say the worst part was the fish sauce. That wasn't to great. 
So while we ate the atmosphere wasn't very inviting. The wait staff was talking on their phones while they were on speaker so we could hear all of their conversation. It was also not very welcoming when they would look at us hoping we would leave.

My husband usually gets the pho with rare streak only and I like to get the Hu Tieu - dry with the cellophane noodles. So far so good but once we got our food it was a different story. 

Hubby's order was fine but mines came with soup. Not dry BUT with soup! 

So I made a complaint to our waiter (the only older man with glasses) and he said that I DID NOT order dry noodles. And I told him I did, my husband even heard my order. The waiter also said he can not change my order because I ""didn't order it right"". And basically blaming me because I didn't order it right. Ok fine, whatever I'll just eat it so he'll be quiet. I' m not the type to start any confict. I took the first bite and wasn't happy it wasn't the dry version. It tastes totally different and I didn't bother eating it again. 

Just when were about to leave to pay our bill, the waiter comes back and noticed i did not eat it and he offered to change my food. Seriously ? What happen to ""I can't change your order?"" 

Anyways, I wanted to see the manager after this but they supposedly don't have a manager. So I just told the lady who managed our bill what happened and she apologized for his service. She knew who I was complaining about and I didn't even have to point out who it was. She also offered to take my order off the bill and all we had to pay was for my husband's pho.

Been here once before, but wasn't much memorable back then. Felt the same way the second time around. We were immediately given menus and water, which was cool. Took a little while for someone to take our order though, but no biggie.

Lots of different meat options for the pho. But felt that the broth itself was almost flavorless. Perhaps because it was a freshly cooked batch and didn't have enough time to steep? Who knows. But the side of herbs of basil, sprouts, lime, and jalapenos were very fresh though.  Spring rolls were also big and plump and a filling appetizer for two people. Just wish it had been cut in half to make it easier to eat.

Service wasn't exactly warm, but adequate. Waters were refilled without having to ask. No one checked in on us at the end though or dropped off a check, so we just paid at the counter. (Not sure what the normal protocol was).

That evening he went to use it for dinner and the card was already shut down.  Come to find out, there were 4 transactions totaling about $800 originating from North Las Vegas while this restaurant is in Henderson (can't be at two places at the same time).  Praise the Lord that the credit card company caught the red flag and canceled his card and the investigation is pending.

I'm so bummed that this happened.  The food is great, the price is not bad and my wife and I were beginning to love  this place!  But in all seriousness and gravity, the good food is not worth the risk of having your identity and credit card stolen.  Be warned and be wise.  I care about all of you, who are reading this, and wouldn't want you to experience such a crime against you.  I implore you to stay away!

Have fun on your quest for good eats!
Sincerely,
Eric F.

Although I prefer the West side one on Spring Mountain because it allows a bit easier access with my wheelchair, I am glad that they are now present on the Eastside. A previous Yelper commented that the Lemongrass Cafe across the street is much better, but I have to disagree. Furthmore, the danky carpet in the other place ruins my appetite. Saigon 8 creates the best both for the phos everytime. According to a lot of my Vietnamese friends, it is created fresh every day. The summer rolls are always delicious and their peanut sauce is superb. When I need comfort food this is the place to be.

848282,2010-03-11,0,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"Pho Saigon 8:
Eastern and 215 Location (Eastern and Pebble)

Let's start with the constructive criticism.  It's smaller places, parking is a little tight otherwise you are parking in the LVAC parking lot.

And most of the servers might have a little trouble speaking English but not all and the owner is usually on-site and very fluent.

Now for the more important stuff, good food, and great price.  I've noticed you seem to get a little more for your buck here than I've seen at other viet restaurants and the food always comes out quick.

Spring mountain location:
Same as above for food, good food for the price, parking is worse though if you go when it's busy but seating is much better and it's larger to accomodate groups. 

Extra info:
I guess the things I'm not crazy about but they aren't unique to either location is if you want to substitute something it's a huge no no, at best you can just have things removed.  And I think the soup only comes in a mainstream size, maybe not quite large but you can't order a small but some dishes come with a small size of Pho minus the meat.",96a9vXOEz-5BjRsydkd6Ew,0,0,4,AkRslRooVjlU2B6lqy6aSw

We also had the vietnames rice noodles with shrimp and pork. For some reason they gave us that to go. So I believe this took away from the experience of how its to be eaten.

I did originally rant a rave about how great this place was but it was not the right place. my bad, sorry for the confusion. However, I did have the pleasure of stopping into this establishment after my work out at the las vegas athletic club (same parking lot). I ordered the seafood pho and this place does it a bit different with the items of meat in the pho. They give you tiny eggs so i'm wondering if its maybe quail eggs? I don't know if they do this in all their pho dishes or if it is just in the seafood one, but one of the eggs seems to be a bit off so I don't know if it was bad or what. The broth is strangely sour if you taste it on its own.  its a clear yellow color which is not beef broth like its supposed to be. After adding all veggies, noodles, and meat it does take some of the sourness away but the broth is not authentic. Its lacking in the proper pho spices/flavor. it really was just a sour/salty broth. definitely not a traditional authentic Pho broth at all. in my opinion you are much better off going to the Pho Little Saigon in the chuck e cheese/99 cent store/in and out parking lot on the other side of the 2-15 to get the real deal, you will be much happier. Its where I always go when I am to lazy to make my own traditional Vietnamese food at home.

The Pho was good enough to warrant a return visit when I am not feeling like driving too far from my house for a bowl of pho.

The broth was clear,  and has a great flavor. I ALWAYS take a few spoons of broth and sip it before adding anything. I even have my kids doing it. You have to be able to taste it for what it is. If the broth can stand the taste test alone, then you known the bowl is worth the cost.  The plate full of basil, bean sprouts, lemon and jalape√±os was plentiful, and super fresh. 

My first time there, there was three of us. It was near lightening speed from when they took our pho orders to when the kitchen staff came out and delivered it to our tables. Seriously, I don't think even 3 minutes passed. Yay, for fast service!

The wait staff and cashier are bit lacking,  which is unfortunate. I asked the waiter for to-go bowls and waited far too long. Finally had to ask cashier, when son went to pay.

Our second trip,  the food and drink was just as good as the first time.  However, the lightening speed was gone, and actually felt we waited a longer time than normal. I will say it was packed on Sunday, so I understand.

We ordered on the phone and they don't repeat your order back to you but when they get your order wrong, they claim that it's your fault. I am honestly not a difficult customer by any means but this place lacks any sort of customer service. We placed a simple order on the phone and repeated it to the lady multiple times. 

When my bf arrived to pick up the order, the order was wrong. Instead of 59 it was 69 that they gave. The lady said, ""this is what you got, what do you want? An add on?"" And he was trying to explain that the order was wrong. They started raising their voices at him basically blaming him for their mistake. So they get him the correct order and the order looked half of what is normally served. They clearly were annoyed and didn't care. They're lucky that he already paid and tipped before noticing the error because they did not deserve the tip. 

I completely understand that mistakes can happen but blaming the customer and raising their voices because THEY misunderstood is terrible business ethic. If they simply acknowledged their mistake and corrected it appropriately then all would be fine. This is not how to run a restaurant or any business for that matter. What a shame because I have family, friends, and co-workers that love pho but I would not recommend coming here to any of my friends and family any longer due to the terrible service.

The pork has great flavor, almost a sweet taste to it, and I love the combination of pieces of pork and eggroll, noodle, and peanuts in one chopstick-ful (as opposed to spoonful).  Delicious and cheap!  

It can get pretty busy during both lunch and dinner, so the service leaves much to be desired during those times.  Also, the parking lot is shared with various other popular establishments, so it can be hard to find a close parking spot during peak times.

So, since I've moved to Vegas, I've been in the search for my regular Vietnamese spot for whenever I'm craving pho or a vermicelli dish. 

Food:
As I tried Pho Saigon, I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the chicken pho and spring rolls. I usually always order size small when I get pho, but Pho Saigon only does size large, which sucks because I ended up wasting half of my soup. Plus, I was really disappointed for spending so much when I didn't eat it all (my cravings were too strong, I needed to buy pho!). Also, the broth was lacking flavor, and trust me, I love my pho so this really was mediocre. Well, moving onto my spring rolls.. the meat was so dry.. thank god I was able to drench each bite into the peanut sauce and sriracha, cos I couldnt just eat it by itself. 

Service:
I called in for a pick up order and the lady was in such a rush! Once I said my order, she quickly said, ""okay give me 10 minutes"" and hung up. Lol, she didn't give me a price for my order or anything, which made me not even want to go and pick up my order because I actually wanted to make sure I was getting a small size. When I arrived I said I was there for pick up and the lady said the price and it was about $17 for pho and spring rolls, so I know forsure it wasnt a small. I asked how much the price was for a small and that was when she informed me that they do not have small sizes. If I had known that from when I made the order on the phone, I would have said nevermind and didn't order at all because I forsure wouldn't finish that and I didn't want to spend that much on something I wont finish. But because I am not rude, I paid and accepted it anyway.

I can't recall the number, but it was with the rare flank steak.

The bowls came out quickly and I requested some nuoc mam sauce and lettuce to put in my soup.  Our server brought back the sauce, but not the lettuce.  I guess it's my fault for not calling him back to the table... The taste of the soup was good.  Not the best pho I have ever eaten, but decent.

The restaurant began to fill up for the lunch rush while we were eating, so I guess we got there just in time.  Our check was dropped off at the table without a word and since we had never been there we weren't really sure if we should go up to the register or wait.  We opted to walk up to the front, which seemed to be the right decision.  I then saw a sign that said Debit/Credit transactions must be over $10 and my soup was only around $7.  I expressed my concern and the lady and the register gruffly told me that I would have to add a tip... which of course I was intending on doing, but the tone and demeanor in which she said it was kind of off.

2324158,2014-08-18,0,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"A bowl of noodles as filling and satisfying as a Thanksgiving dinner!

After spending 12 years living in Southeast Asia there is one simple meal that I miss most, a simple bowl of noodles.

Pho Saigon 8 will be my local bowl for authentic Asian noodle soup. Their noodle soups are spot on.

I had the Pho Tai Chin, rare and well cooked beef noodle soup. There are two size options, small or large for .50 cents more. The large double the size of the small and is helmet sized steaming bowl of satisfying noodle goodness. 
Before the soup arrives the server delivers the vegetable condiments that you can use to customize your bowl, don't be shy, add them all, the flavors and freshness they add lifts the noodles to a heavenly level. Also, don't forget to spice things up with a healthy squirt of Sriracha and a salty dose of hoisin sauce. There is also a wickedly delightful bowl of chili garlic sauce that adds a solid hit of heat, garlic and a touch of sour.
The rare thin sliced beef sirloin rests on top of the perfectly cooked rice noodles. Once you stir the beef into the bowl, the rare beef becomes medium well in the steaming hot broth, tender, fresh - scrumptious.
The depth of flavors is uber stimulating to the palate and the sheer volume of food is tummy satisfying. You may need a nap if you finish the whole bowl!

My wife enjoyed the Hu tieu hay Mi Dac Biet (pork soup with seafood with egg noodles). She agreed, a fantastic, tasty, satisfying bowl of noodles. The egg noodles are thin and curly. She commented that the squid was fresh and cooked perfectly.

For an authentic taste of Southeast Asia, Pho Saigon 8 can't be beat.

Their menu is extensive and includes many other non-noodle dishes that we will certainly be returning to try. We just couldn't handle anything else on top of our hot tub sized bowl of noodles!

Eastern near LVAC. Of the 3 or 4 other pho places in the area it's maybe my #2 or 3.  It shares the parking with a few businesses and it gets pretty busy during lunch so sometimes there aren't any parking right in front and you might have to park farther. Also getting in and out might take long.

When I come here I usually get the pho with everything except the meatballs and tripe, just not a fan of it. I think it's the #21 on the menu rare eye round steak, flank, brisket, soft tendon, skirt flank. All of that with the various veggie ingredients and sauces makes a good meal very tasty.

Services is usually good. It's cluttered near the entrance. Seat a good numbers of people. There's a sign that says $10 minimum for credit charges but noticed that they aren't always strict about that policy.

My mom and I have been coming to Pho Saigon 8 since my family first moved to the valley, almost four years ago, and the customer service over the years has just gotten progressively worse. The staff was great when we first started coming here and then as of lately, the staff has just been rude and unpleasant to be served by. Although this restaurant is not close to home, we still drive the distance when we have that craving! We used to come at least once a week, but now every other month or so.

We usually come for lunch on the weekend, so it's always busy during that time. The wait time can be a hit or miss.

I am a creature of habit and order the same exact thing every time. I order the #11 (Pho T√°i) which is the broth, noodles, and rare eye round. As far as the pho goes, the broth is always hot and never warm like other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to. It's rich in flavor and there is a good amount of rice noodles in the soup. I love the rare eye round because it's not fatty. A plate of garnishes are provided for the table to share. The traditional Thai basil, jalape√±os, lime, and my favorite, crunchy bean sprouts. I love my pho with extra lime, and if more garnishes are needed, you can always ask for more! You might have to ask more than once though because they can be quite forgetful. Also, condiments are a must! A nice squeeze of Sriracha and Hoisin always go into my pho.

If I'm hungrier than usual, I'll order a plate of the crispy fried egg rolls to share. The crispy fried spring rolls are a favorite amongst my family! There are four per order and it comes with four leaves of fresh lettuce as well as the dipping sauce. I'm not too sure what the dipping sauce is made of, but it's delicious! The spring rolls are filled with pork and a variety of veggies.

Overall, the best place for pho in the Henderson area! The food is great and satisfies my craving every time. The service isn't the best, but it'll do.",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,8,6,3,yZOLKqPj7BBGYEkUeL5bEA

2663930,2016-01-19,0,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR PHO IN LAS VEGAS. Don't be fooled, they have another location on Spring Mtn Road in Chinatown, but this location in Henderson is much better.

For me pho comes down to 4 things. 
1. the soup. 
2. the noodles
3. the meat
4. cleanliness

The soup here is real, some places try to cut corners by not using real stock, they go with the ""gaijing"" or chicken/pork base, this saves hours of prep and time (and is cheaper) but the taste isn't there. If you want to know if real stock is being used, take a cup full home, put it in the fridge and if it has fat settled on the top in form of white dots, its the real deal. THIS PLACE USES REAL STOCK AND THE FLAVOR IS REALLY REALLY GOOD.

The noodles here are good, they don't give you a ton, so if you are a big eater like myself you can order extra, or load up on the sprouts and basil. I am 6'4 and push 300 lbs, this place fills me up with out extra noodles, mainly due to the generous portion of meat.

The meat here is perfect. IT IS CUT THIN!!! There are so many pho places that simply slice their meat too thick and it tastes chalky and hard to digest. Here they do it perfect. The rare eye of the round, brisket and fatty brisket are perfect. I get the #18 that comes with all the above with tendon and tripe.

You can tell this place is well taken care of. The hoisin sauce bottle is clean, the hot sauce container doesnt have 3 week old hot sauce jerky hanging from it (foodies will know what i mean) and the place is decorated nicely, service is fast and nice.

2837543,2011-09-06,1,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"Easily Pho-gotten Experience

Can't really comment on the sister restaurant in Spring Mountain, but I stopped by here since I currently reside on the east part of town and I wanted to check out the Las Vegas Athletic Club located not far behind.

A good way to judge a Vietnamese restaurant is the quality of the their beef pho broth.  While I was fairly hungry having scheduled a late lunch, I was both delighted and simultaneously skeptical regarding the fact that my steaming bowl of beef pho with flank steak and tendon came within 2 minutes of placing my order.  One of my Vietnamese friends taught me some easy signs to spot a good broth are through sight and smell prior to tasting.  One should detect an immediate aroma upon the bowl being placed at your table and I'm not sure if that was the case.  The clarity of the broth both in term of being able to visualize the ingredients and the absence of an abundance of oil at the surface also is a positive sign and this broth appeared to pass the sight test. 

Poking my chopsticks around followed by adding the standard sides (sprouts, jalapenos, lime, and basil), I began to slurp and taste.  The noodles were the right texture and not overly clumped together, although this can be the most forgivable fault if all else is right.  The meat was problematic in that the thin slices were clumped together like miniature meat softballs and the only way of preventing any undercooked areas would be to OVERCOOK the whole mass.  Anthony Bourdain once commented in his book Kitchen Confidential that one should never order steak well done since you will likely get the worst cut of meat available since one cannot tell the difference between the best and worst when it is well done.  I feel the same holds true when you are trying to assess the quality of the thinly sliced beef in one's pho.  The tendon was actually the star in that they were sliced with a good combination of collagenous goodness and the occasional hint of meat and cooked to perfection. 

 Last but not least, the broth is what makes or breaks the dish, and in this case, my nose trumped my eyes in that the taste of the broth was fairly one-dimensional.   The broth is usually a matter of pride amongst Vietnamese moms and no two are alike since hours to days are spent perfecting the signature combination of beef bones, ginger, onion, and aromatics (cinnamon, anise. cloves, peppercorns, etc) guarded in households much like the Colonel Sanders' original recipe.  I could barely detect anything beyond a mild sweetness which could have been MSG or a bouillion cube (we'll see how thirsty I am a few hours from writing this review).  I am probably being overcritical since I have had some great broths in the past, so I will say that much like the clientele which was mostly of mixed caucasian/asian couples, this place would be a great primer for someone new to pho since I would think perhaps the addition of the other subtle flavors may weird out the newcomers and sometimes one has to sample an average broth to appreciate an excellent broth.  

P.S.  Probably the only pet peeve of mine is avoid taking home noodle soups unless you plan on consuming them later that night.  It is a food crime to eat them as leftovers when the noodles have had a chance to get soggy and release their starches and muddle the broth.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,2,0,3,hSL8CXNAr86k5inIRAdqZg

2931809,2010-11-21,4,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"I just got back from a two week trip to Vietnam and was excited to test out Pho Saigon 8 after reading some good reviews from John Curtis.  

First, I noticed that some have complained about the service.  It's not prompt, or attentive, but trust me, that's authentic!  In Vietnam servers don't get tipped so they have no reason to be attentive, and there you have to ask for your check... So, if it really is Vietnamese staff working there, expect to have to request your check and realize that it's not rude to approach them.

Now for the food!  We ordered vegetarian spring rolls which were tasty, although they could have used some more herby additions.  The dipping sauce was delicious!  We split the Pho Tai (thin strips of beef in the beef pho broth).  The pho was good, not the best I've had, but a solid middle of the road.  It was pretty flavorful, add-ins are appropriate (giant basil, bean sprouts, hot peppers).  But, what impressed me was that they had the rice crepes that have become my favorite Vietnamese meal!

The crepe is made with rice flour (it's a savory crepe, folks), cooked in a pan until a bit crispy, and filled with bean sprouts, shrimp, and pork.  It comes with a fish sauce based dripping sauce that augments this dish wonderfully.  With this meal (which appears in the appetizer section, but I use as a main course) comes a giant plate of ruffage.  The proper execution is to take a lettuce leaf, cut off a chunk of the crepe + filling, and use the lettuce leaf as a wrap to make your own little spring roll out of it.  Add in the carrot, some kind of other root vegetable, and mint that they provide.  The rolls are cool and crunchy on the outside, warm, crunchy, and flavorful on the inside.  Don't forget the dipping sauce, it's well worth it.

Most Vietnamese restaurants in town don't extend past pho and some stir-fried rice dishes, and maybe a ""clay pot"" type dish if you're lucky.  This rice ""crepe"" will keep me coming back for more, yum!",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,9,5,4,0Ytj19iEgIp7edxVQoZDcQ

3052328,2009-07-07,0,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"Let it be said that there is absolutely nothing horrible about this place.  Everything is just mediocre.  

First, the decor was the best thing about it.  It was new, well-painted, pretty paintings and new chairs and tables with granite on top.  There were nice fake plants on the ceilings and walls, and the bathroom was clean, and nice.  The problem is that the tables had this bar under them where my friend kept hitting his knees against.  The tables were set so close together that I could probably have reached over to the other table and stolen a spring roll off of it.

Speaking of the spring rolls, they were just not good.  The flour sheets on the spring rolls were chewy, and they did not have that nice crunchy stuff in the center that tastes really good, like the ones at Lemongrass.  The dipping sauce was good, but not exceptional.

The pho was the biggest let-down today.  Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain had rich, full broth, that seemed just a little too fatty, and was very good.  This one was rather thin, and its flavor was easily masked by any of the things that you could put in it.  For example, more basil meant that the pho tasted like basil and not pho.  Add bean sprouts, and the pho tasted like water and not much else.  The meat was good, though, and they put a liberal amount of green onion, which I always like.

I also tried the lemon soda.  This was a very good soda, although it was much too sweet.  I think it could have benefited from having more lemon flavor and less sugar in it.  

They have no sandwiches.  

In addition, everything there is smaller, and/or more expensive than Lemongrass, right across the street.  For example, the large pho was the same price for both, but the bowl is smaller was easily finished by myself and my friend.  We've almost never finished a large pho at Lemongrass.  The Vietnamese seafood crepe was both smaller *and* more expensive, by as much as $0.50-$1.00, and while good, made me a little skittish about ordering it again.  The Spring Rolls were the same price, but came with only two instead of three like at Lemongrass.  

Much as I want to see more pho places around, I simply cannot recommend this place with Lemongrass Cafe so close to it.  Maybe if it was in the middle of rural Nevada with no other competition, it would have impressed me more.  I'm sorry, Pho Saigon 8 :/",UIdX_cI1awxvPH7kIFKpXw,1,0,2,cuI9_n97bBKrLH3uPz3xgg

Most non-Vietnamese will come here for pho, and their beef pho is good.  But their chicken pho is better.  You can order it with white meat or dark meat or a combination of both.  I prefer the combination.  You can also get Mien Ga, which is a noodle soup with the chicken pho broth and bean thread noodle, very healthy and yummy (bean thread noodle is a good source of fiber).  

Another good dish here is the Hu Tieu My Tho, which is a noodle soup with pork broth, clear & chewy rice noodle, topped with shrimp, calamari, ground pork, and quail eggs.  It is a very authentic dish from south Vietnam and Pho Saigon 8 has a very good version.  

As with most Vietnamese restaurants, the service can be slow and sporadic but the decor is nicer than many other Vietnamese restaurants in town.  I really recommend this place if you are in the Southeast side of Vegas.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,3,4,3,04xzbQK_fjO3C7SeZu6GQQ

My friends and I went here on a Saturday night, and were pleased that it wasn't too busy. After perusing the menu, my friend and I decided to split a large #11 (Pho Tai- Noodle soup with rare round eye steak, $7.50) while my other friend ordered the #67 (Bun Ga Nuong- Grilled chicken over vermicelli and vegetables, $7.45). I asked for extra bean sprouts to which the waiter didn't seem to have a problem with. Our food came out quickly, which was a plus. 

Pho Tai- Better here than other pho places in the neighborhood. The noodles were the perfect texture- not overcooked, but still soft with a chewy bite. The soup was a little more oily (I could see oil puddles floating on the top) than what I'm used to, but still good and hot nonetheless. And the accompanying plate of veggies & herbs (bean sprouts, basil & lemon (not technically a vegetable or herb...) was fresh. The portion size was good- plenty of noodles & meat- with the addition of bean sprouts, I was definitely full. 

Bun Ga Nuong- I only tried the grilled chicken, which I thought was flavorful and very teriyaki-y, but some of the pieces that I ate had too much fat on them; however, I liked the sweetness and charred flavor of the chicken. 

I didn't really feel like the service was bad. I mean it did take a while for them to bring the check, but my friends and I didn't really have a problem with that because we were too busy talking. I thought the servers were nice. I also like how this place is cleaner than other pho restaurants I've been to.

The soup broth was not the best and you could see alot of oil floating on top and not to mention hardly any noodles. We were thirsty from the saltiness and needed a refill on water but all the employees and the owner were sitting down eating dinner. I had to get up and ask for service. Three other tables came in and were seated at 8:45pm. Once their food was delivered the employees once again sat at ""their"" table and continued eating. I had to stand up once again to ask for the check. I'm sorry I had not gone to Lemongrass Cafe to eat in the first place. We will never go back to this establishment. One more thing.

Now food, here's the down side... I ordered a large Bun Bo Hue and instead of regular noodles I requested for pho noodles (personal liking, chewier).

We came to the conclusion that the bug must have been in the big pot of soup that they served to all customers as how else will the bug appear in the soup.  But nope, if they continued to charge us for the two bowls, we are sure they continued to serve that to other customers.

The place is fairly nice for a Henderson strip mall. Decor is appropriate and tasteful, you'd have friends and family here; unlike most Pho joints that feel like a Vietnamese Robertos. Not that there's anything wrong with Robertos, it's just not a place you'd take a hot date. Saigon 8 is. Actually,  a ""best I can get right now"" date or ""I'm feeling fat/unemployed"" kinda date, but regardless, you won't be ashamed of this place.

The Pho is excellent. Standard pho gringo rules apply with Pho, stick with the Pho tai until you know what you're dealing with. Tripe is not for the unfamiliar stomach.  One amazing thing they do here that's apparently illegal in Vietnam: the veggie pho actually features veggie broth, and IT'S MARKED ON THE CONTAINER.

Also a fun game we play every time I call:
I say: ""Hi can I have a Pho Tai and a Veggie Pho please? Extra meat and extra Jalapenos""
They say: ""(Vocal Noises sounding mildly like english that may or may not be confirming my order.)""
""I didn't catch that, was that a Pho Tai and a Veggie Pho""
""(Garbles that may be English with incomprehensible accent)... 10 minutes"".
""Okay thanks""

And my order has always been right over 10+ visits. Always extra Jalapenos, always extra meat, never any missing sides. This impresses me more than anything else.",H7fr4A3OlKtDr-sNn8BIlw,1,0,5,mm7DrJFy3bURQ20xVZvM1A

My companion had the #76 which was a combo of many different things in the Pho, she has had more Pho from many more places and she said it was great.

I may be the annoying customer that disliked where they seated me and asked to move but 1) it was right after they set waters down not like there was tons of food placed yet and 2) if their dining area wasn't so cramped and dark then the corner right next to the kitchen would have been okay.

And I may not have understood that Thai iced tea was not the same as their regular iced tea because the person who usually takes me there and orders for me was not there this time. And of course, I have to send the Thai iced tea back even though I had described to the male waiter that I wanted the ""clear"" iced tea.

But for the staff to so rudely express their exasperation with me was not just humiliating to me in front of the person I brought to THEIR restaurant but also very frustrating as a paying customer. The waiter who brought me the tea I ordered wrong literally argued with me that it was what I ordered and though I apologized and explained what I wanted, he stormed off to the front counter with it and threw his as about yelling the story to the other two waiters, one of whom always grunts and groans when you ask her for anything.

And yet I never did get the right tea until after my food came and I had to ask the youngest waiter there who is very nice and cordial. 

I don't care how good their food is, I don't pay them to get treated like an unworthy peasant while families of six or seven get star treatment from these despicable two servers.

If I walk into a place to spend money, I shouldn't feel like a jerk for inconveniencing them. If you hate your job, quit. I work in a restaurant, too, and I know we all have bad days, but nobody should feel unwelcome when they want to spend their money and enjoy lunch. To put it shortly, the service was awful. We walked in and were sat, and before our menus were open the giant guy who sat us was already asking if we were ready. Not yet, guy. So he walks away, does a loop around the tiny restaurant, and 30 seconds later asks if we are ready. Repeat twice. Then, he got annoyed, sneezed into his hand, and never came back (thank goodness.) 

When we did finally order, I got Veggie spring rolls and bun with egg rolls. Spring rolls were yummy, no complaint there. My noodles though... soggy lettuce and warm noodles, eek.

My boyfriend ordered a pork stew over egg noodles, but what he got was gigantic chunks of pork fat. That's just gross. I took a picture of the scooped out fat... probably about 8 oz of fat and 3 oz of actual pork meat. I think most would agree that less quantity and more quality is preferable to more waste and less quality. When my food lovin' non-picky eater of a boyfriend barely touches a meal, there's an issue. Even he was grossed out by the bad quality.

I lived alone at the time, so I rarely ever cooked pho at home since a pot of it can feed a dozen people. Vietnamese food has come a long way since I moved there in 2006. Pho Saigon 8 is one of the best in town. The broth is clear and flavorful, made with just the right amount of each ingredient. Some places botch the soup by adding too much of a certain ingredient. Clarity is a good indication of the quality of a pho broth. If it's cloudy, it's probably no bueno. 

Besides the pho, the other dish I usually order here is the Hu Tieu My Tho with the soup on the side. I love Hu Tieu, probably even more than Pho, and this place has the best in town. Nothing compared to my hometown favorites (Nam Vang & Da Lat), but it's the best thing I can eat when I am not at home. For those who don't know, Hu Tieu is another variation of Pho. It comes with noodles and meat. I prefer to keep the broth separated and eat the noodles dry.

We pretty much get the same thing everytime: 2 orders of spring rolls (they come 2/order); large pho #18, which has everything- rare eye of round, flank, brisket, tendon, & tripe; and #78, crispy egg noodles with stir-fried chicken, seafood. quail eggs, and vegetables. Sometimes, I order #61, grilled slice beef with rice vermicelli. The food comes out quick and is delicious. The wait staff is hit or miss, which is why I docked them a star. The prices are reasonable- pretty much everything is less than $10. The portions are large. We always end up bringing home our lunch and have it for dinner, too.

Make sure you take note that the pho prices on their menu are for the ""large"" bowl but by default they give you the regular size if you don't ask. 

They have the best taste and value fresh spring rolls (they have pork and shrimp inside) I've had so far in Vegas. Seems so simple but yet other places can't seem to pull it off.

This place is pretty much a get in, eat, get out and get on with your life type of business. The service interaction is fairly minimal (which I actually like in some situations) so don't expect any small talk. They bring you some water, take your order, bring your food and you pay yourself at the counter when you're ready. If you need something else just flag them down and they'll help you. It helps if you know your table number which is labeled but they generally know which table is yours.

Your best bet is to do your homework on what dishes you may want to try, then go in and order by number.

If you're into really thick and strong coffee, give the Vietnamese ice coffee a try. I'll try to post a video of it brewing - it takes quite some time to funnel its way down into the glass so you can dump it in your ice but it's worth the wait.

My biggest beef with Pho Saigon 8 is that their Spring Mountain location is subpar and inconsistent in food taste/quality.  I will however visit this location any day of the week.

PS- if you like pork chops marinated in fish sauce and grilled.. It's absolutely wonderful here. Another popular item is any of the b√∫n - rice noodle (no soup) dishes. Be sure to try it with the sweet chili sauce!",wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg,2,1,4,S6fRR4zu-Ncd1QUxDmEbfg

Told her I wanted Ph√¥ X√¢o D√≥n Th√¢p C√¢m which I've had at different Vietnamese restaurant. She pointed at #79-Ph√¥ √Åp Ch√¢o Th√¢p C√°m. I asked specifically if noodles are flat and cut in squares. She mutters, ""It's same..same thing"". Okay I'll get it. 10minutes later guy comes and drops it off at table and leaves. I waved at guy to tell him it's not the same noodles that I wanted. He said, u ordered #79! Yes but only bc she said it was same thing....And it's not! He then tried to explain that every place makes it different. Okay I understand that so don't tell me it's same thing if it's NOT, right? Well immediately I said, ""can I see the menu I want something else.""!He continues trying to explain and wasn't taking it off my bill bc ""I ordered it"". I finally said fine do whatever charge me but I don't want it.  I ordered #70. It was okay(5.5/10), definitely had better at other places. 
Now that I've read few other 1star reviews on here, 200% I will NOT ever eat here!!! It was on dirty dining for demerits, Yelper witnessed employees not washing hands, Yelper had hair and bug found in their food! Plus you raised the prices on menu I noticed.

Overall it is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants around my neighborhood.  It actually gets pretty busy at times since it's in the LVAC parking lot.  A fair amount of seating, but we usually get take out.  Check your order though because we have on multiple occasions received the wrong order, and let's just say they were annoyed with us and claimed we got it wrong.

We always get their fresh spring rolls, and they provide a generous amount of peanut hoison dipping sauce in the to go order.  The rolls are also fairly sizable.  Not the best I have ever had, but consistent and hit the spot.

I get the vermicelli noodles with the grilled pork.  However I always get it to eat the next day because they always cook their noodles to long, and they firm up over night.  The pork is flavorful and tender, but the naoc mam (fish sauce) is fairly basic. I wish they used more herbs, garlic, shallots etc to add some extra punch to their noodle bowls.

My boyfriend appreciates that they have the Vietnamese rice porridge (chao) on request, but I prefer his mothers.  This one doesn't have that much of a flavor to me, and I get bored eating it quickly.  He also prefers their pho here above a lot of places in the valley.  They give a large amount of basil and and limes on the side unlike some places.  He always gets the combo.

They have some good jelly desserts that are tasty, a bit sweet, but less sweet than a lot of other restaurants.

I totally understand at these places especially for a party of one if your at a large table other party's are sat with you. The family that was sat at the same table had a young child with the loudest Ipad ever on. After five minutes and no servers coming by I got up and decided to order to go.

I ordered a chicken pho, egg rolls, a roll of French bread and Thai iced tea. When he told me the total I almost said never mind but I'm really hungry and craving soup. Fine f*** it I'll pay the !!!!!$21 dollar!!!!! bill.
I've never paid so much for literally the same meal I get every time I go to a pho place. That's how much it usually costs for two meals! 

So I sit down to wait....and wait......and wait. It's been 30 minutes from the time I ordered to go. I'm about ready to say never mind I want my money back. Me and another guy get up and are looking at the dude in the front like ughhhhh hello! He goes into the back and brings out 5 to go orders! Are you freaking kidding me?!?! So my order was just sitting back there?! When I ask for my Thai iced tea he grabs it out of the fridge with a bunch of melted ice in it. So that was probably sitting there for 30 minutes also. I got it home and it was just warm not hot like it should be. Egg rolls were soggy. Not crispy crunchy. So disappointed 

Food was just ok. Not any better than any other place. Not terrible. Just whatever.

The amount of meat in all of the pho options is generous. My husband was on the fence about giving pho a try, but changed his mind when he saw how much meat comes in the bowl. The small bowl is a lot of food and I can't imagine who would be able to eat the large. I like that they bring out items to help customize your dish like bean sprouts, basil, lime, chili paste, and jalapenos. I love adding jalapenos and chili paste for a spicy dish.

- Fast service 

Cons:
- Brisket is the only meat I ever order in my Pho and the brisket here is way too fatty. Each slice of brisket is over 50% fat. There's different kinds of fatty too but this one is ridiculously chewy. I spend more time dissecting my brisket than enjoying my soup. 
- Sometimes the bean sprouts they bring out for your Pho looks and tastes old and withered

Anyway, the broth is amazing. If you order your pho and get meatballs, flank steak, rare beef, etc. I would definitely recommend coming here. If you like brisket though, try Pho Little Siagon across the street. Such tender beef brisket!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,0,0,3,AnVxXQyxhTNE1LxdVQFKQA

I had the chicken and seafood pho, it was just as delicious as the first time I had it, with perfectly cooked shrimp and quail eggs floating around for a great rich touch. The broth is so flavorful.

The kids all had the chicken pho. They weren't sure how to eat it. I told them slurping was OK, just in here though..lol

My wife unfortunately didn't eat anything because the old man either didn't understand her when she said vegetarian and asked if they had rice noodles. He kept showing her items on the menu with chicken and just didn't get it.  So that sucked

It was a great experience for the children and I stopped someplace after for the wife.

5120175,2015-12-10,3,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"I've been here a few times before (years ago), and it was always good food and good service. 

Most recently, I had dinner here a few nights ago. We got here around 6 or 7pm on a Monday, there was no wait, it was fairly busy, got seated immediately. But a few minutes after that, the dinner crowd started to roll in. We got there in good timing. 

Interior still looks the same since I was last here. Nice, clean, asian decor. 

I am currently on a Slow Carb Diet (protein, veggies, legumes...at least 20 grams of protein at each meal) to sugar detox and reclaim my health. That day I felt sick, so this was the perfect place to go to that night. My usual yelp habit is to look through the tips and then the reviews. I'm so glad I scanned the reviews because I read Mel C.'s review mentioning Pho with Chicken Breast! Thanks Mel! I scanned the menu at the table as well, and that was the best option for me. I've been to a couple of other Pho restaurants and that's the first time I saw Pho with Chicken Breast on the menu! I was excited. 

There's a choice of a small or large bowl, I got the small. The small was a pretty good size, filled with more than enough noodles, broth and thick slices of chicken breast. There must have been 8-10 slices of chicken breast, which was more than I expected. Score! I can't imagine what the large would be. 

I usually enjoy the noodles, but this time around because I was sick and have been cutting carbs my stomach didn't do well with the noodles. I ate a few, but they were too much for me. The noodles were pretty thick as well.

Next time, I'll have to ask for no noodles and replace them with veggies. 

Oh by the way, you can also ask for egg noodles if you prefer. They had no problem switching to egg noodles with my friend's bowl. 

Service was quick! Our food was brought to us in about 5 minutes.

Tried a few things and the Bun Bo hue was hit and miss, first time soup was bland second time it was great. 

Service is usually bad but with most asian places its the norm, asian people go for the food not the service. 

One thing that was really good is the Nem (forgot the second word), ifs the pink meatballs that are not cooked (I think) with the raw garlic and chili in it. They serve it over vermacilli in one of thier bun dishes... that was good but only if you know vietnamese food. Bun bo Hue and raw Nem is not for the first timers.

5167138,2010-05-13,0,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"I was never a fan of Vietnamese food.  The first time I ever ate it was over ten years ago and thought to myself how I'd never eat it again.  I met my ex from Seattle and moved there for about almost 4 years and everywhere I went was a Pho restaurant.  After a while I came to fall in love with their food and only in Seattle.  I swore that there would never be another Vietnamese restaurant that can compare.

Today, mom decided she wanted to eat Vietnamese and thought what the heck.  I drove on Eastern, passed the I-215, and right by the Las Vegas Athletic Club was the restaurant.  

When I walked in, mom had already been seated and luckily there was no line.  Last time we were here there was a twenty minute wait.  It's a somewhat small intimate restaurant with so many tables and chairs so close to one another.  So many people talking loudly, and plates clattering, sipping their soup loudly made me wonder if this is actually what it's like in a restaurant in Vietnam.  Looking forward to the day I find out through hands on experience.

No time was wasted and I gave my order of a #70.  I forgot the name but there was white noodles, some vegetables, herbs, barbecue shrimp, barbecue thinly sliced pork, and spring rolls.  The sauce on the side tasted like a sweet fish sauce with carrots and other ingredients to hide the gross smell of fish sauce.  I poured that in my bowl and mixed all the food around.  I haven't talked about fireworks in my mouth because it's been a while since I've felt that.  But, we're gonna talk about that in this review.

FIREWORKS!!!  When I put the food in my mouth, I literally felt like I was in the sky with fireworks around me.  I can still remember it like it was just a minute ago.  Normally, I don't like to eat past being full, but this dish was just too good to not finish.  The combination of the pork, noodles, vegetables, and sauce blended well together.  Food Network judges talks about texture a lot and this dish is not just mushy noodles and meat, but had the crunch of the vegetables and spring rolls.  The different texture was definitely there and worked very well with this dish.

Mom ordered something with seafood pho.  It was also very well made with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.  Mom added vegetables and herbs to it which gave it a playful texture.  Her pho was also great.  All the food was awesome which is why I gave it a 4 stars.  

It's just too bad that the servers were far too busy to give any smile to the customers.  They're all so serious and don't look very friendly.  I'm sure they're very nice outside of work but while serving my mother and I, we didn't get that welcome feeling like they wanted us there.  Sure, they gave us water, took our order, brought out our food and finally our check.  That's all routine.  There was no *umph* to their service.  It was just eh and blah.

3 stars to the servers and 4 stars to the cooks.  I'm sure they were in a good mood to be cooking AWWWWWESOOMMMMMME!",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,2,2,4,L11WeQI_UdgmL_US81fVgg

I liked the fact that they had chopsticks and spoons in a little fancy dispenser on each table, along with the sauces.

Ambiance is like your usual asian restaurant, although no matter how many times I have been there, I just can't recall whether they had music or not.

Note I said the food that I order because I don't really order anything else. I always get pho, spring rolls, or some type of vermicelli bowl. My usual options never disappoint so I keep sticking to them. If I'm getting pho, I always get #16 which has rare round eye, flank, and brisket. It is so yummy and satisfying!

I love the deep fried spring rolls. They might be called egg rolls, but I'm not actually sure. It comes with lettuce, mint, and pickled carrots and radish. I usually wrap one with lettuce and make a little burrito with the extra stuff and pour some of the sauce on top. You have got to try it! Sometimes that's all I'll order and I won't even share it.

So, I go back to the register and tell the older gentleman, I guess the owner, that the young guy that rung me up gave me the wrong change and showed him the change I received.  The older man was apologetic and corrected the error and said that they didn't mean to do it cause it was busy. But, when I went to pay it had already died down.

Okay enough with the obsessiveness. I have been to many pho shops in las vegas, little saigon, pho kim long, pho so 1 and it seems like the beef stew always comes out as beef soup. Its flavorless, oily, and watery. At pho saigon 8, you can tell the broth gets its richness from the cubes of beef and tendon and the sweetness from the onions and the carrots boiling for many hours. Since this location has opened, either one of us always orders this dish. But as usual the pho-, bun-, and the plate dishes are exceptional.

Environment: The inside of the restaurant isn't anything special, but it is cozy. Seating is done quickly, which is most important when grabbing a quick lunch. The only thing I would say is that when we went there, there had been no music or anything playing which did make the environment a little change. It wasn't awkwardly quiet because the sound of all the customers talking to one another at their respective tables filled the air, however some type of music playing could have been welcomed.

Food: To start we got spring rolls, which were nice and fresh just how I like them. Dipping sauce was good as well. As for the pho, they had a nice sized menu with numerous options. I like the ones with a couple different varieties of meat in it so I could get one which combined flank, rare beef, and tendon. The bowl was huge and the flavor was good. Probably was not the best pho I have ever had but it can compare to other pho spots in Vegas.

Service: Service was quick and efficient which is what I would expect. Never felt like I was waiting for anything or that it was hard to get anyone's attention so I would say that I was satisfied.

- Legit Viet restaurant! Cramped seating. Waiter speaks Viet to take our order. Grandma serves us our meal. Pay at the cashier after you finish eating. The only thing missing is a sign that says cash only! haha! Love it! 
- Pho tai chin: noodle soup with rare eye round steak and well done lean meat
Steaming hot when served. Broth was good, but average. I liked how the well done meat didn't have a lot of fat on it. Need more bean sprouts and cilantro. 
- Com ga roti: roasted Cornish hen, served with French rice or steamed rice, 8.05
Delicious French rice. They made it crispy and dry enough where you can still taste the tomato paste and not soggy. The chicken was a bit burnt and quite small. They did give plenty of vegetable sides and broth side soup was a good compliment. Seems like the side soup is what they would use for their wanton soup. 
- Viets eat here so you know its good.
- It takes hours to make the broth of pho bc you have to cook the bone. Just because its fast, doesn't mean its old. It's marinated.

The boyfriend phoned in a to-go order for me. We were told the food will be ready in 15 minutes. When we got there, we still had to wait.

Pho Tai: 
Nothing exciting to write home about. It was ordinary and slighly saltier than normal. 2/5

Spring Rolls:
Teeny tiny rolls and they skimp on meat/shrimp. The peanut sauce is quite salty. 1/5

Thai Iced Tea: 
Not the best place to get this from. It has a weird flavor and texture. 2/5

The food was just okay nothing amazing.  
Spring Rolls: It is usually a hit & miss thing. Sometimes its tasteful and sometimes is very bland.  When its bland I would have to use a lot of the dipping sauce to have some taste to the spring rolls.

Pho: I normally dont order pho, but when I finally did, I hated it.  I forgot what I ordered but it was not great at all.  It was cold and I asked them to reheat it, but one of the servers didnt understand what I was asking.  They had to ask another server to figure out what I wanted.  But after they reheated it, it wasnt something I would order again. 

Pork&Rice: I usually order this and in order for me to enjoy it. I would always use the pho's broth that they bring on the side and I would add it to the meat and rice to have more flavor to it.  

Service:  They normally dont smile when you enter their restaurant and only one or two of them is friendly.  I would have to flag them down to re-fill my glass of water and ask for the check.",oDyEexUT09e3XhxIp0-Wxg,1,3,3,XyRueWR2dvoK0sY7ej7hKg

5434371,2017-04-24,2,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"This used to be our go to spot for pho, especially when the whole family is in town, but we took about a yearlong hiatus after we had a couple of bad experiences with service and decided to head down the street for our Vietnamese. We came back recently and the food was good and the service was better because we went during a non peak time. It will usually be busy when you go in, and because of this, service can be inattentive. Generally, your server will also be curt with you, that's the way they always have been and I don't see that changing anytime soon.

The pho here is consistently good. Everyone in my family, except for a select few, always order pho. I usually get #16 (I am not going to remotely attempt to spell any of the dishes) which is rare eye round, flank, and brisket. They'll bring you as much of the accouterments needed for your soup also. Even though it doesn't take them long to bring out your bowl once you order, you can tell the broth has been cooking for hours. The deep beef flavor is easily detectable along with the aroma of spices like star anise and clove. A big squeeze of sriracha for heat is the only other thing that I usually add to my soup.

I have had a few of their rice plates and they are satisfactory. The kids will always want an order of shredded pork spring rolls to start and they usually don't last too long. Pricing is affordable, usually right around $$ per person depending how many large bowls and sodas are ordered. Heads up also, check your bill before you pay because they'll tack on 15% gratuity for your party (it may be posted on a small sign in the front) and not say a word when they give you the check or after you've signed off on an extra 20% tip. Ultimately it's our fault for not looking over the check, but you're welcome Pho Saigon 8.

5454256,2012-11-20,2,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"People rave about this place. After having tried a Ramen place the night before in China Town, I thought this place was just OK, at best.

Service was very slow, they squashed us in a side table even though there were plenty of other seats, and didn't really explain WTF we were supposed to be doing.  For instance, I guess you are supposed to be wrapping the egg rolls in the large pieces of lettuce they give you??? They give you a BUNCH of stuff to doctor up your soup with, which I guess should've been my first indication that it wasn't going to be all that good.

DON'T GET THE MEATBALLS. They were nasty. Apparently, there's some confusion on meatballs and sausage in a casing?  You literally had to bite and tear into these packets of meat to get a chunk off of them. It definitely reminded me of eating an overcooked piece of sausage and way too big to be eating in one bite.

The Thai Tea was amazing but I felt for it's size, extremely over priced. In fact, the whole thing was a bit overpriced, it was almost $40 for 3 of us for lunch without tip.
Trying to get the check was a production too, then paying the check up at the front, then tipping was all very strange.

The noodles are a hit or miss and since I'm a big noodle eater, this matters to me. Sometimes they are soggy but sometimes they are perfect. Though the broth is consistent and is one of the best in Vegas, making this place one of the few solid pho places around Vegas. 

It is still not up to par with LA pho places, but as I have said in other reviews I have yet to eat at a pho place in Vegas that measures up.

The only thing that is below average, even for an asian restaurant (which says a lot), is the service. 

I am used the okay service of asian restaurants where the waitresses are often overwhelmed with too many customers and often forget things and don't have enough time to give you a lot of time, so that doesn't bother me. What does bother me is when a worker is walking around like he has nothing and they purposely ignores you. I ordered a pho from one guy working there and never ended up getting my order. He even avoided me and purposely ignored me when I tried to catch his attention . Finally another server saw me and promptly got my order, at least she was very nice. I wish I could say that this only happened to me once (and I would be willing to overlook it since I come here often) but it was not the only time and he was not the only guy that did that.",b4t9cwSUG4FRamK4G8FTSg,1,0,4,PTC_6U7tL-0pXkdVoJO_Pg

The waiter asked for our order as soon as they handed us the menu and we asked for a few minutes. He came back two minutes later and asked for our order and again we asked for a few more minutes because there's like a thousand items on the menu and it was my first time there. We finally ordered and the waitress came out and brought our food since our waiter was on his break having his meal at the table in front us us. We had the pho ga, shrimp spring rolls, and shrimp fried rice. Everything was absolutely delicious! When we asked the waitress for another order of shrimp spring rolls, she brought them back to us in a to-go box. I guess she wanted us to leave so we left since we were done with their crap.

...Talk about FAST food, the spring rolls came out minutes after we ordered it and our Pho came out as Eric was finishing up his appetizer (and he eats fast!)

it's a smaller restaurant and was packed at 5pm (it's a good sign that the food was going to be good!).  The decor is nice, table tops are some kind of stone/granite (no booths) and it was clean.  I'm agreeing with another reviewer, it's a tight fit and the tables are a little close together and I don't recall any type of music playing.  The service was friendly, nice and quick- although there was not much rapport between us.  They were great about busing the tables and keeping it clutter-free (my pet peeve).

i rarely eat anything else than seafood pho.. so tonight i got the small #44 which only consists or shrimp and crab! the other place i usually eat pho at in the bay area has more seafood items in the meal but since those are my top 2 favorite things.. it sounded like the perfect bowl!
my choice of beverage tonight was their fresh squeezed lemonade! 
food came out in a timely manner.. and everything looked delish..
i loved how i ordered a small but they gave me noodles as it was a large! i was totally expecting imitation crab.. and to my surprise there was real crab meat.. couldn't get better than that! shrimp was kinda bland but nothing that sriracha sauce can't fix!
taste, size, temperature of the whole thing was wonderful.. just what i needed for a cold night!
my lemonade was bomb! i usually don't care for tart sour drinks but i must say this was some good as lemonada! so refreshing to the mouth after a hot meal!
i shall come here many more times in the future!

not so many parking spaces for the little shoppping area its in.. seating arrangements kinda suck.. service was ok.. but they could try to come around a little more often.. and when the bill came back swiped and all.. they didn't have a customer copy receipt.. only store copy.. i personally don't care for that extra piece of paper but many do!

Living in cities like SD, LA, and the SF Bay Area where I would constantly find myself eating at Pho spots over a million times, I was a bit scared to see what Vegas would provide for my Pho cravings.

So far I've stumbled upon this place and the Pho is ok. The broth has the usual flavor, but I think I've had more flavorful broths eating in spots like Pho Ca Dao in San Diego and Jasmin Garden in San Francisco. But I will say the large bowl of Pho can hit the spot when you have the craving.

I have also had their wonton egg noodle soup. Pretty basic. Noodles have a soft texture and the wontons break a part easily--making it a pleasant experience eating together. I'm sad they didn't have the spicy chili oil sauce they have in some Vietnamese/Chinese spots.

Their fresh spring rolls are good as well.

In a way, I think their food is a tad bit over priced compared to some mom and pop Vietnamese restaurants I love going to in California, but ehh i'll get over it. 

Another thing is that they have a limit of $10 when using credit cards. Since sometimes I usual eat by myself for dinner, it's kind of annoying.

5659267,2011-06-19,0,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"So I had pho once in my life, it was seafood, I didn't like it and that was back in California. I, in my never ending quest to ""try new things"" went out for Vietnamese with my sister after coming up empty at Whole Foods. 

I've passed by this place a million times and have wanted to try it. Again, even if I don't like something the first time, I try to try it in a different preparation again at another time. We walked inside, it was nice, clean, and we were seated promptly. My sister decided she wasn't hungry and didn't want to try anything so she ordered a side of rice. I ordered a #73 (I have no idea what the real name was.) The description said it was spicy. The waitress told me it had pig's blood in it. Was I a little hesitant, yeah, but I ordered it anyway.

My sister's rice was delivered to our table in about 2 seconds, along with the mint and lettuce for my pho. About 5 minutes later, the soup came out. I was completely unfamiliar with the two gray black cubes of ??? and the white pate like half circle floating on the side. Apparently, according to the waitress, it was pig's blood sausage and another type of sausage. I had to skip the blood sausage. I couldn't bring myself to try it. The pork in it, well, I couldn't identify what part of the animal it was from. The fat was very rare. 

Was the soup spicy? No. I had to add a ton of siracha to my soup, along with the jalapenos. Would I go there again? Maybe, but I would for sure try something else. What I ordered was not something that had a lot of depth of flavor.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,1,3,0mFiBVm-jb2quXFNReniTw

5765924,2018-06-16,0,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"Overall: Pho Saigon 8 disappoints in making its namesake dish, but the Hu Tieu was pretty dang good. It might be my regular for that dish, but I'll have to continue looking for a pho restaurant.

Food: 3

Pho Chin (Cooked Brisket): The broth lacked the intense umaminess from beef bones, but it was clear and not too sweet. However, the brisket was completely dry and tasteless.

Hu Tieu My Tho Kho: Surprisingly, this dish was good. The sauce was well balanced and flavorful. There was plenty of saut√©ed ground pork and offals, and the shrimps were a good size. They aren't too consistent on the offals as one bowl had almost all heart while the other had a mix of heart and liver. Make sure to ask for the hu tieu giay!

Service: 3

We didn't have too many interactions with the waiters outside of ordering and asking for a few extra things.

As a California native from Little Saigon, I'm used to ordering in Vietnamese in Vietnamese restaurants. However, I'm not sure if all the waiters here speak Vietnamese fluently because our waiter seemed to have a hard time understanding my order.

Ambiance: 4

Pho Saigon 8 is a small restaurant, so the tables are kind of close together. But it's decently clean and cool.",scWPwwaZeZsk0OzJ856z-w,0,0,3,q5LYQNoe7CJx6PbJUXYPPw
5775059,2015-11-04,3,YavRvjbLsvh4DYDJPAfJIA,"Came here for lunch the other day since I was on this side of town. I came with a bunch of friends and we got seated immediately. 

I ordered a small pho with brisket & beef balls. My friends got a large pho (#18) & egg rolls. We got our rolls first and without really looking at the menu we assumed that spring rolls were the fried rolls, since a lot of Vietnamese places call spring rolls egg rolls & the uncooked rolls summer rolls. But I guess every Vietnamese place differs? (Kinda confusing tho :( ) we told them that we wanted the fried ones so they had to go back & make our order. At first they told us to just take it & eat them since we ordered it but why take something we won't eat right? The pho on the other hand was good. It had a lot of green onions which I personally like & the broth was flavorful. But my friends & I felt like the only difference with the large was more soup and a bit more meat. They didn't have a lot of noodles to accommodate the meat and I usually like that. My pho had a lot of noodles but not enough meat. I had about 4 beef balls cut in half (2 full size beef balls) & 4 pieces of brisket. I was left with a lot of noodles leftover. Pho 8/10 The egg rolls was good tho! 10/10

Customer service was decent. I feel like at a lot of Asian places customer service is just whatever. Not the friendliest but also not the meanest. A guy always came to refilled our water so +1 for them! 

Overall, will come back here again to eat their pho! Especially because of th broth & how fast it was to receive your order.",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,3,3,3,B3INX8Ecq9dqHXJ8Y9CBnw

I placed an order for pickup after work... I've never done this with pho before, so when I went to pick up my ONE order of #11, pho tai, I was surprised to look like I ordered for an entire family! 

I got home, unwrapped my goods.... it was just like I was at the restaurant, in my own home:]. Everything that they would serve you was included: all the leafy goodness (still not sure what all of it is), cilantro and chives, LOTS of noodles, and a generous amount of  RAW thin slices of beef. This was all neatly organized in a generic Styrofoam to-go box.  Hoisin sauce and red pepper sauce were also packed into my belongings. Also, a large Styrofoam cup/bowl(?) of the beef broth. The broth was still piping hot. It cooked my beef slices just as I wanted, instantly. Although I did make the mistake of keeping the lid off, so it cooled down pretty quickly and didn't cook the beef so well for my second portion. 

Absolutely delicious. 

I prepared it all just how I would want it.. and even came back for seconds. I of course didn't waste all the meat, but I couldn't finish the noodles.

Yeah, the staff isn't super friendly, but that's how Vietnamese restaurants are, in my experience. They hussle you in and out and don't really come back to check on you - pretty standard. However, the one thing that's incredibly annoying is that they insist you order by the menu item # and when the food comes out, they say the menu item #. I have terrible memory, so I can never remember what number I ordered (I remember the name in Vietnamese because it's usually a staple that I order frequently).
