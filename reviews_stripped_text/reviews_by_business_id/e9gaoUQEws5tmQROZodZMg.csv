Then last night I decided to get some pizza for my kids and after a bit of deliberating I decided to order form them, and my wife, kid's and I were glad that I had decided to order form them and now are wondering why we have not order form them before.
   
   I ordered the 24"" pizza half pepperoni and half cheese, 10"" meat, some sodas, and their calamari ( the calamari is awesome but it was cut into strips like french fries witch was different than how most places cut it and it is worth it ) the calamari was so meaty and tender I remember that I told my wife that we had to eat the calamari first because if calamari gets cold it will tend to get rubbery BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE HERE I had to run and hid it from my kids and ate it later and it was the as where they delivered it.

The pizzas where great as well the were not to dry or too greasy my 3 kids devoured the 24"" one in no time and the 10"" one my wife and I had in the morning which was awesome reheated in the morning. 

I don't know why I waited so long to order from them but I know that I won't be waiting for that long before I reorder again",KLGy5BWaYA958CTK0dLhsg,0,0,5,Wjfkr2-eEm4BzIwfIQLh6A

2 star = Not good. I will not go back, but it wasnt absolutely awful.
3 star = Good, not great. I wouldnt go out of my way, but I *would* go back.
4 star = Excellent food. I really liked it. I could be a regular here.
5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.

Meetings all day nearby, and I was looking for someplace close by to eat lunch. This place got good reviews, so myself and 4 colleagues decided to try it out. Overall, its is good not great -- I would give it a 3.5 stars.

Prices are really good -- meatball sub and a 20 oz drink for $7.75. Coworkers got a large pizza, 2 liter, and wings for $25.

I had the meatball sub. Nothing seemed to be made fresh (frozen meatballs, sauce from a can, etc.) but it was a good sub.

The fries were not good -- not horrible, but not good.

Coworkers got pizza and wings. They said the wings were really good. I tried the pizza, it was decent.

Overall, dont go out of your way to eat here but if you are in the neighborhood it isnt a bad option.",4PAbEV_aep8BYVZPzVGrnw,2,2,3,Tj-tc91lGsa5LLc0YoAt2Q

I would suggest eating food to go or delivered.  When we were there, an angry crackhead hassled us in the parking lot.  So on to the food.  The first time we picked up food to go.  We ordered fried mushrooms, chicken wings and pizza.  The mushrooms were delicious.  The wings were kind of dry.  My husband loved his pizza.  Next week, we got it delivered.  Any place that delivers to the base gets a bonus point.  This time we ordered spicy buffalo pizza, bacon cheeseburger, and baklava.  Once again the pizza was delicious.  The burger was huge but didn't have a lot of seasoning to it and was kind of dry.  The baklava just tasted really greasy and bitter.  Over all, the place is decent for the price and the portions are pretty big.",r79QdFrVcIwO4mxNNCjfEg,0,0,3,VLhW4DUiFdwziO7wKPHuPg

417952,2012-04-25,0,e9gaoUQEws5tmQROZodZMg,"Meh. I've experienced better.

The worst part is that the pizza here was recommended as God's gift to Las Vegas.  In fact, while I was eating, I can't remember exactly how many people drooled over me like hungry puppies and asked where it came from.  Confused yet?  Me too, because I didn't get the pizza.

Oh, but I dearly wanted to.  Unfortunately this establishment had something else in mind and sent me a calzone instead.  All I wanted was a Hawai'ian pizza to have an even playing field for comparison, but it was a pick-up order and not by me -- so I ate it.  As far as a Hawai'ian calzone goes, it was a first for me.  The all too uniformly, finely diced ham would probably be from a bag somewhere, and the pineapple from a can somewhere.  Actually, the pineapple I wouldn't have issues with if it had some of the caramelization typical of cooking atop a pizza pie.  Double-whammy for a mixed up order.

For a calzone as a whole, I've had some awesome ones.  This did not rank among them, but it was good enough to want to finish in one sitting.  It wasn't small either; quite a bonus.  Also considering that directions to this establishment were given out about half a dozen times just because of how good it looked should garner some respect.",0c0d6-jwJoAlwMVcOowEQg,0,0,2,nqJk0cizv5BTHXDE3FkAXA

The noodles were extremely over cooked and the flavor was indescribable.

When I called to see if the driver could turn around real quick and bring back a couple more hot sauces (mind you, I live less than a mile away) NORMAND answered and told me it wasn't his problem since I was the one who didn't specify on my order how I wanted my wings.

So we ""were"" loyal patrons however we ordered for delivery our favorite pizza and some wings which we were told would take 35 minutes for delivery.  At about an hour after our order was placed my wife decides to call to find out how much longer it would be and was told about 10 minutes.  We suspected the usual which was they tried to deliver it 2 streets over like they had in the past no big deal.  Besides the store is about 4 minutes away.  After more time had elapsed my wife calls back to find out where the delivery driver was and she was directed to another employee named Roger.  Roger was less than helpful and frankly very apathetic, even stating ""if your so close then why don't you just pick it up"".  He also said ""tell your military if they don't like it then they can just come pick it up"".  Needless to say this was very upsetting and my wife asked to speak with a manager who conveniently was not there.  After the food finally arrived surprise surprise it was cold and the wings were overcooked.  So since we were so close we decided to return the food and get a refund.  Upon arriving we spoke with Roger.. who immediately refunded our money and could care less about the lack of customer service or that we were less than satisfied with the service.  We confronted him about the circumstances and he just didn't care even shrugged his shoulders as to say oh well.  He even stated ""you military think your special or something"".  We've been delivering to the base for years we don't care if we lose the business.  I instructed him the issue was merely we were told the delivery would arrive in 35 minutes and it took more than double the time.  We also told him we provided our address clearly and it was 3 minutes away from the mistaken address which didn't justify the lateness.  Needless to say the ""special"" comment was upsetting to me so tensions were high... As were going back and forth he continued to antagonize by saying ""why are your yelling?  are you happy...you feel better"".

Usually it's just the same pizza. Half cheese, for my mom, and half sausage, for me and my dad. I ordered just the pizza and he said it would be ready in 10-15. Perfect. i went out to the car and just chit chatted with my dad. After maybe 13 minutes or so I decided to walk back in and see if it was ready. It was just coming off the oven. He saw me walk in and said I had great timing and asked how i knew it was ready. I like that he tries to be funny and make people laugh. He cut up the pizza and had me on my way.

It's not in the best location, the area is pretty ghetto and the people around are not very hospitable.  The staff however are very friendly and helpful.",MSc3YGSbIwRxdSTpC7os1Q,1,0,5,7vCv2rBITktEWfwFhIp_Ig

5227813,2016-08-29,2,e9gaoUQEws5tmQROZodZMg,"Had a mini housewarming party with friends on Friday  night, so we ordered a pizza and wings for delivery. 

We ordered the Manhattan Special pizza:  Pepperoni, sausage, beef, ham, green peppers, black olives, onions, mushrooms, and the Bucket of wings (40 wings)

The pizza arrived well within the hour they said it would take, so delivery time was excellent.
They were polite on the phone.

The food:
Wings: small, but well cooked.  They actually reheat well too.
Pizza: meh.  I'd be happier with a crispier crust, and more sauce.  Toppings were good, cheese was good.  This reheated much better the second day.  

We'll definitely give it another go.  I want to try their pasta and their gyros, but I'm sure we'll order pizza from here again.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,4,3,3,gYcWGPWpiJWZJf_jiiOKmA

The staff has always been a delight. The pizza is a-ok indeed. 

Not much room inside, and the location is nowhere I'd want to be after the sun goes down. 

So my suggestion is call in and take out your order. If you're feeding a lot of people, get one of their 24"" pies, or two if you want leftovers for the rest of the week.

Tonight we ordered from there for the 3rd time for delivery, and the guy said it would take no more than 45 minutes. Not only did it take them DOUBLE that time to deliver my pizza (an hour and a half!!!) but the whole order was cold when we got it and we had to warm it up in the microwave.
