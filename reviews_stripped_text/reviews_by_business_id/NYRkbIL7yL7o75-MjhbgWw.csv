This place is amazing ... Wife on the grill, nicest kids serving and working hard, Dad stops in and says hello (or ""hola"").   Quality of the food was excellent.   

I will for sure stop by here when I am in the neighborhood craving some good/inexpensive authentic Mexican food.

Just a word of warning - their English is not the best -  my wife asked for the bathroom and got a box.   All good ... was yummy.",US5TnFHzeZLWHgwzArQJrw,1,0,5,N7i-effBLwGmEnSDiGJbog

Dear restaurant owner, you may not want to only cater to only one type of clientele. You are in a PRiMe location with 5 bars within a mile radius. What do people love to eat after a night of drinking..??..?.?.. Mexican food!! Make sure EVERYONE can read the menu, put some flavor in your food and stay open later on the weekends. With these tips, you will do great. Without....I don't see this place staying open through the end of the year. 2 stars since the staff was friendly and the place was clean.",s1xPHhBUe54DozxKTnQdzw,1,1,2,pR27vkaFu7w59lUm1F8Eag

The food here is really good. It's authentic Mexican food. They have some items on their menu that are pretty unique to this part of town; lamb BBQ, goat stew, lamb stew, rabbit in green sauce. It's family owned and operated which is why their service is great. The tortillas are made from scratch, as well as their salsas and likely everything on the menu. The several times a I've been here it's always pretty empty, probably because it's new. The atmosphere is pretty quiet aside from the grill in the back. You can see them prepare your food. Their table menu is in Spanish and English, wall menu only in Spanish, though I've never not been handed a table menu, even for take-outs. If you do take out, keep in mind this is not fast food, it may take a while. I'd suggest calling in your order. The food is decently priced, I've usually spent about $10/person and we all end up satisfied. I will definitely be returning.",BmTgcpiu4T6RggprCN3x_g,1,0,5,dRo5Sd6qMAcJCw73sKYjAA

Family-run. Delicious. Authentic. Great prices. Attentive service.

This is my new go-to Mexican joint. 
(If Donald Trump ate here, he might have a very different view on immigration!)

Oh, and when I walked in, one of the daughters was making fresh flour tortillas by hand! 
Amazing!!!",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,4,1,5,zTM3Ud2Ai8GOSMnQ9cdhog

I don't speak Spanish and the girl taking my order only speaks Spanish, so there was a little bit of a language barrier and my shrimp cocktail almost became tacos. But after searching the millions of offerings on the menu I was able to point and show her what I wanted. I also translated ""to go"" on my phone and showed it her, and we were both smiling and good. She graciously brought me a full order of home made chips with a great warm salsa while I waited. 

In my mind ""hole in the wall"" conjures visions of a greasy little joint but even at lunchtime this place is immaculate as far as I can see.

And the shrimp cocktail ~ yummm!!! It came in one of the large jumbo styrofoam to-go containers and was full to the top. A good ratio of shrimp to sauce, but the shrimp are tail-on, which makes it a little messy to eat. The sauce is delicious, with a perfect amount of very fresh crunchy celery, cilantro, onion, avocado and chiles. I thought it could use a little more garlic, but maybe that's just me ;^} it was just the right amount of heat for a gringo girl like me. It was one of the better shrimp cocktails I have had here in town. 

One of the customers had a torta that looked huge and delicious, and also one of the barbacoas on the menu caught my eye. 
Now I have to come back next week for another try... and the next week... and then there's the breakfast menu... 

I encourage you to check this place out!",Egdx-VnKJrcmVBpEm7zGqg,0,0,4,487o0sQKRuigl88C2po2jw

Their posted hours said that they were open until 10 PM.  Called the next day to see when they would close. The owner was very unfriendly and said that they don't accept Restaurant.com. coupons. We will not return.",XE4wk6F4Kma9No2lM7y2Ew,0,0,1,ND5qgvGNT4Taz05E2jXI9A
