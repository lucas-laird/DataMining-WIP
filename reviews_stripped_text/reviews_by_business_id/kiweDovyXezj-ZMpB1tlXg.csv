Well I have some news, it wasn't good it was more like great! 

I ended up looking at the menu over and over because there were just so many choices that not only sounded good but when I looked around at other tables the food complimented the yummy smell. I got the sliders because I love me some finger foods that I can pick up real quick, eat, and go. I also got a root beer float-that was also fantastic.

The only thing that I could say that could have been better was the service. I picked out what I wanted fairly quick, and between the time of sitting down and placing my order was around 10 minutes, which normally isn't so bad during lunch except that the restaurant was not busy by any means-like it was pushing 3 other tables, and 1 of them was paying. 

The food makes up for the service though. If you're in a time crunch make sure to ask for the bill right away, because it still takes a while to get.",4A4DFr45AlHSREDY6IV4_Q,3,1,4,aJKz5sDllMSM39a71xjCbQ

I didn't have a car so the frontdesk guy recommended this place as the only walking distance place at that time of the night (about 9:00 PM).  So I made the walk and the first thing I noticed was that the whole shopping center was dark and all the businesses seemed to be closed, not many cars in the parking lot.  There was a big sign that says this place is opened 24hrs so I continued walking although with some trepidation.  Hunger won and I continued my walk.  The place has no windows, so I was expecting a strip joint or something like that, once again hunger won and I entered.  The dining room was closed but the bar offered a full menu so I went in through the glass doors to my right.  First thing that hit me was a strong cigarette smell that almost made me turn around, oh but the hunger.  No one was actively smoking, as a matter of facts I was their only customer at the time.  So I sat down and ordered their $12.99 full rack of ribs with stake fries.  And they were good!! very good! The stake fries were freshly cooked.  A decent full rack of BBQ ribs with stake fries and a soft drink for $16.00 (not including tip of course), I might even come back and try their fish & chips next.",wl2WKb12cmltw3GyC6GPOA,0,0,4,jOsrHpZj_8akjjneY-F8YA

I've been to 3 Village Pubs in the area and this dining room has the best character so far. I guess you can say it's very dated, but who cares? It's not your hotel room, it's a place to grab some good eats and go.
The Spanish lady there is really nice, very prompt and excellent service! When I go to the Galaxy theater to see a movie on Friday morning (when they play something I want to see), I will stop in for a quick breakfast.

Tartar sauce tastes homemade. Paired with an EI Hefeweizen--@ $4/pint, this was a great sub $20 meal.

My boyfriend and I were staying at La Quinta, on a Saturday night. We had a wedding to be at, early evening, so we chose to have an even earlier dinner. This place was not only close, but had nice reviews. Under normal weather conditions, it was walkeable, but in the Vegas heat, constant AC is a must! 
We entered the shooping center and the restaurant is large and easy to spot. Once inside, you'll see a chalkboard to the left, with advertised specials. You can dine in the formal-looking, restaurant section, or enter another set of glass doors/wall partitions, for the bar area. We weren't about romance for tonight, so we opted for the social bar experience. 
I'm not a smoker and second-hand smoke can get to me, but luckily we found a spot and most of that was done on the opposite side. The bar is large, oval. The opposite side had table gaming and ours did not. I liked that option. 
Kevin was the bartender and was so awesome. His adorable TN accent and personality, helped make our dining time, that much better. He explained about their own brews and presented us with menus for food and drink. I easily ordered a glass of Moscato, since it's not usually served in many restaurants. My guy got the EI Light. It was smooth and quenched his thirst enough, for him to order another. 
I was blessed to put an order in, for Prime Rib. Quite frankly, it was the best I've ever had! The creamy horseradish, was also amazing. My baked potato side was good, with butter, sour cream, and chives. I didn't try the vegetables, but they looked good. It also came with a fresh salad, yummy croutons and Ranch. 
Robert ordered the half rack ribs. They were juicy, fell off the bone, and came with a great BBQ sauce. He wasn't crazy about the coleslaw and did choose to add salt and pepper to the underseasoned potato salad. 
Still, our time there was superb. The food, service, big screen tvs, and even the mixed genre of music from the speakers, was pleasing.

Außerhalb der Vegas Strip Location, direkt am Airport gelegener Pub mit guter US Küche.

Direkt an der Hauptstraße gelegen ist dieser 24x7h operierende Pub. Da unser Motel La Quinta in fussläufiger 3min Nähe liegt, sind wir bereits vor 2Jahren beim letzten Stay hier aufmerksam geworden.

Natürlich ist es beim eintreten etwas.....""einfach"" gehalten. Die Location hat zwei Bereiche: eine Bar (smoking allowed) und hinter Glas getrennt gehalten und einen einfachen Restaurant Bereich.

Um es kurz zu machen:

Steaks, Burgers, Salads, Fish & Chips (Special des Ladens) uvm und nie teurer als 9-13$! Das rockt! Und schmeckt wirklich gut! Freundliches Personal und eine wirklich gute Auswahl an Beer und härteren Sachen

The bar wasn't crowded, just a few old folks gambling (its weird when I'm the youngest in a place haha). 

They have a rotating special for each day of the week, and lots of other stuff going on. I might have to come back for Pork Chop night. I think I saw for NYE a steak and lobster for $29.99 dinner. They are affiliated with other Village Pubs around the city. I think this was my first time eating at one.

I had a French Dip sandwich. The meat was a touch too salty for me, but it was tasty. The bread was super soft and soaked up the Au Jus nicely. Priced right at $8.69 including sweet potato tots. There were a few other selections on the menu that I will try. Its very basic food, American style, but done right.
