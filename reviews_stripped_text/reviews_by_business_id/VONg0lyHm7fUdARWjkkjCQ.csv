It had been open for 5 weeks when we were there and you can see the passion of this family. Decor is fun and cute while still being high quality. Place is clean and spacious. The beautiful owner Tanya came out to say hello and make sure our meals were delicious. Server was kind and gave us recommendations and checked back often.

I got a bad feeling about the place when I walked in for dinner and the place was completely empty. The chips and salsa were horrible and the enchilada sauce tasted like vinegar. The food came out fast but that wasn't a positive, it wasn't even warm. I had one bite and said let's leave. I told them I was dissatisfied and offered to still pay the bill and they accepted.

1579560,2016-02-15,3,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,"We were looking forward to trying this place since the concept sounded amazing.  We decided on Sunday due to the all-you-can-eat enchilada special they advertised, only to find out we were one week too late.  They now have the all-you-can-eat special on Wednesday after 4pm, however call ahead to make sure.  This would have been a great way to try their 3 menu pages of different enchilada styles and sauces. 

The place itself is very colorful and big, but with only one server it seemed like we waited a bit on everything.  So I guess you can seat yourself and wait, wait ,and wait.   She finally came over to take our drink order and then shortly came back with chips and salsa.  The chips were underwhelming but then again we did come here for their enchiladas so whatever.  She came back, took our order, and then returned shortly with cups of their Fideo soup.  This was pretty simple but good.  

They have about 15 different types of sauces to choose from, and an order of enchiladas comes with 4. You may mix it up with 2 different choices, and you select cheese, beef, or chicken.  We ordered Guajillo, Encacahuetadas (Japanese peanut sauce) Pipian (pumpkin seed sauce) and Mole. We chose cheese as filling for all except the Mole which we chose chicken.  The cheese by the way is crumbled fresh cheese, so don't expect melted shredded cheese like I was.  All were uniquely different and made with fresh corn tortillas and served with rice and beans, however our food was served warm almost cold.

We waited a good 30 minutes for our food so I did not expect warm food. This spoiled it for me. Sauces can take on a different taste when served warm or cold and was just a turnoff!   There were only 2 other occupied tables and they had alreadybeen served so there was no excuse.  

The food wasn't awful but I am sure we would have had a different experience and been able to recommend should they have served hot food.  We should have said something, but instead we just won't be rushing back.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,6,7,3,RIEzfN8cZHkyj4_vhfOjhQ
1729411,2016-07-10,4,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,"Generally speaking, food described as ""like mom's cooking"" tends to be made with love, but not so much flavor- gotta make sure it's not too spicy for your sister, not too salty for your dad, and take into account everyone else's flavor preferences and dietary restrictions, too. This spot has a great variety of enchilada sauces, friendly family service, and a huge dining room to bring your whole crew. Note their Wednesday AYCE special.

Ordered a combo plate to go- one red beef enchilada, one green chicken enchilada, and a beef taco, plus a side of guac. Food was good, but as others have said, the amount of meat in the enchiladas is minimal. Plate overall was a good sized portion, and I liked the red sauce more than the green. I do wish they offered a Tex-Mex version with shredded yellow cheese instead of exclusively using the crumbled white cotija. Guac was fresh with tomato and onion, definitely get an order to share. 

I called ahead after reading other reviews that said wait times could be lengthy- my food was being brought out right as I walked in, 15 minutes later. I would consider coming back if in the area and specifically craving enchiladas, and try other sauces. However, I think they need to step it up a little to stand out in a neighborhood packed with Mexican restaurants.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,11,3,2Szn-ekmLglWWRlNwVeLCQ

3400221,2016-01-25,1,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,"We went here because we saw it on Yelp, of course, and would never have found it otherwise. Too bad, because it's located in a strip mall on the East side, unfortunately notorious for being half full of vacant storefronts, so you don't just stumble across it.

It's pretty spacious and clean, with your standard Mexican fiesta decor. Of course, my friend and I had to sit at a table with two pink chairs so we didn't have to fight over one.

The server was a sweetheart and very patient about describing the menu with it's many sauce options to my friend, who lives in mortal fear that someone will order something better than what she got. 

The chips and salsa were just ok, but that;s not what you're here for. Fideo soup is a pretty good version of a dish for which we have no expectations anyway.

The enchiladas, on the other hand, proved to be mighty tasty. I thought the tomato sauce would be like standard red enchilada sauce, but it was very light and fresh tasting. Nice, but I prefer more complex flavors, so my favorite was the pumpkin seed. It was very deep, mellow and toasty with just a tiny bit of sweetness. Really should have tried the mole but  I was intrigued by the variety of exotic combinations.  The plan is definitely to go back on Wed. or Sunday when they have AYCE so we can try 'em all.

Everything was fresh even the corn tortillas! My chile relleno.. Spot on. They have 6 different sauces of which one is vegetarian, the verde. It was fresh and the flavors popped in my mouth. I also had the darker red sauce. Forgot the name. It was a medium sauce shown in my picture. Also perfect.

3599702,2016-02-15,9,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,"So.....the 5 star average for yet another Mexican Restaurant kinda fooled me again, leaving me with an A-OK visit....What I've noticed so far is that Eastside eateries are hit and miss.

This is a very spacious spot with very friendly service, but we came for what they are supposedly known for...their Enchiladas. About 14-15 different sauces to choose from, all made from scratch, and the tortillas here are made from scratch and not out of a bag....prices are $9.95(cheese), $11.95 (chicken), and $12.95 (beef) and come with four to an order(folded over taco style, not rolled) You also get rice, chips and salsa, beans(made with lard), greens, and Sopa de Fideos. Very plentiful and filling as well. For those who can't decide on what sauces you want on your enchiladas, you can do 50/50, with two different sauces which is what we did. I saw on the menu that you can also customize your plate for $10.95. We shared the Guajillo, Mole(with chicken) Encacajuatadas (Japanese Peanut and chili sauce) and Pipian (Pumpkin Seed sauce) Enchiladas.

For me, the flavors of the sauces were good,(chicken was minimal and bland) but my main issue was that both plates were room temperature to cold (the soup was even warmer) Common sense is that hot food is served hot, cold food served cold, nothing in between. Also, for those of you who are used to cheddar or monterey jack in your enchiladas, Queso fresco, a soft crumbly cheese is used for everything. You won't get that ooey gooey cheesiness here. 

The whole back of the menu is non-enchilada items FYI, and they no longer do AYCE enchiladas on Sunday...It's only on Wednesdays after 4pm...I'm glad we at least got to try it out, but are in no such hurry to return. ALOHA!!!

When I asked for hotter salsa, he was quick to bring me some. 

I had the Enchiladas de Chili Verde with chicken. They were hot, hot, hot just the way I like it. My meal came with soup, four enchiladas, refried beans, and rice. The enchiladas weren't rolled or flat which is the only way I have had them before. They are folded over like tacos. The beans were black refried beans and delicious. That was the first time I had refried beans that weren't pinto. The plate was large and full of food. I couldn't come close to eating it all.

They have the largest selection of enchilada sauces I have ever seen. Of course, they have the standard options, but they also had sauces like pumpkin seed, black bean sauce, and Japanese peanut. I just wish this place wasn't across town from me. I hope business picks up, so they can stay open.

4127542,2015-10-22,0,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,"I had an enjoyable meal of enchiladas rojas.  They start you with tortilla chips and salsa--their salsa is quite spicy.  Then fideo soup before your entr√©e arrives. The enchiladas were very good. I ordered them with steak, and was surprised that the steak was on the side, not inside. The meat was rather tough--if I did it over, I'd order either ground beef or maybe try the cecina.

The enchiladas rojas rate 2 peppers on a scale of 0 to 4 on their menu, but after the spicy salsa, the heat was only just noticeable.",-4JDJeFS0YAYSiSvIshGLQ,0,0,4,49p_UhRYzKvVWQriSSO0tg

There are many choices of sauce and they gave me a taste to make sure I was happy with my selection. I am looking forward to coming back.

4861539,2016-01-22,1,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,I would have given this place 5 stars if they didn't try to steer me away from the spicy food and then warn me by saying be careful that it's spicy. I love spicy food! So what if I'm white I'm also a chef and know what I like. At least they gave it to me spicy unlike some places I've been to which just assume you don't know what you're talking about and give you mild.  Having said that I'll be back for sure if they made tacos as good as the enchiladas I would pitch a tent outside The food is that good. The enchiladas might be small but they are so perfect you'll ignore the price and order more. Also they have all you can eat enchiladas on Wednesday and Sunday which might be as close to heaven on earth as you can get.

5123023,2016-02-11,17,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,"This Mexican mama is a bonafide boss of the sauce...have eaten in this family restaurant about 3 times now and always get their AYCE enchiladas with a choice of around 16 daily homemade sauces. You get 4 enchiladas to start and then 2 more until infinity moving forward. 

The food is excellent, the prices are fair now (used to be great)  and the service is spot on, however, all 3 times I've gone I'm told of policy changes regarding their AYCE deal...maybe these are special rules designed only for me as I don't see them listed anywhere on the menu or chalkboard. I can't really hold it against them as I've been known to inflict Matt Stonie level carnage on more than one AYCE joint in the valley.

Here are gradual price changes...

----November they offered AYCE steak enchiladadas for $14.95, $0 for refill of steak, chicken or ground beef.

----December I returned to find they offered $14.95 for steak, but refill of steak was $1, or I could get unlimited chicken and ground beef for $12.95, $0 refill for chicken or steak.

----February I returned to find they would still honor December's deal, but next week they are starting $9.95 unlimited cheese enchiladas, with $0 refills of cheese, but refill of chicken or ground beef is $1 and steak is now $2 a refill. 

You can see how unlimited enchiladas for $9.95 is misleading in the fact that your meal could be double that or more. I get steak is expensive, but the small amount of chicken and beef that goes into each folded enchilada can't be too costly...I'd be returning monthly if they at least would have kept December's deal going. Oh well.

So with a bit of disappointment, why the 5 stars? Simply put, I've never had unique enchiladas with multiple sauces so good...even if some great deals must come to an end.

5425017,2015-08-30,0,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,"Enchiladas are some of the most diverse Mexican foods there is.  Las Enchiladas de Mama knows their stuff. They were cooked perfectly.  Some places have chewy, hard, or undercooked sections of the enchilada; which takes away from the flavor, but not this place.  As great as the food was the service was fantastic and everything was done by hand (no factory content). Fresh as fresh can be.

I'm not a big enchilada guy, but this place was excellent. They are new so I recommend stopping by and giving a new local business a shot at impressing you. I recommend the Enchiladas Verde w/chicken and the Entomatadas in a combo plate. They are awesome at letting you try a variety of their selection so you can enjoy the different flavors!

5663537,2015-11-11,0,VONg0lyHm7fUdARWjkkjCQ,"This new Mexican restaurant gets 3 thumbs up from the Three Amigos.
We tried this place tonight with a Restaurant.com gift certificate in hand.
When we walked in we were the only customers in this strip mall location.
Decor in this large establishment  is very mexican and maybe even a little on the tacky side with all the streamers  and the like in the air and on the walls.  I guess you could call it overly festive.  In all of our opinions it could use some toning down.
They have only been open about 4 months and the specialty here is of course the Enchiladas. Our meal started with the typical chips and salsa.  Chips were decent and Salsa was chunky and a little kick.  We then had a great sopa de fideo.  A little salt & lime and the 3 of us finished our bowls. They offer about 9 or so different & amazing sauces and based on the 3 that we tried they were as good as you can get in this town. We tried the Verdes, Entomatadas & Morita. (see the pics of each).  When it comes to sauces they know what they are doing here and they are cooked to perfection  There are 3 price points starting at $9.95 for cheese or plain and then $11.95 for chicken or ground beef and finally $12.95 for beef or carnitas.  These are not your typical triple fold large tortilla enchiladas. They are  single taco size fold in half freshly made tortillas filled with your choice and smothered in sauce, queso & cream.  AND YOU GET 4 (FOUR) Now for a few dislikes from the gringo of the bunch.  The rice while just average had no flavor and was just too plain for a mexican rice.  Also, they only offer black beans. This gringo does not like black beans.  Right now they still have no liquor license which can be a killer for some mexican restaurants especially one as large as this.  We were told by our waiter who is the brother of the owner that they should have it by December 1st.
We were told that on Wednesdays they have all you can eat enchiladas, you pay for your first plate and then they will continue to bring you two at a time till your full.  
They have a huge chalkboard full of lunch specials with all kinds of taco, quesadilla and the typical mexican combinations. For those hung up on Pepsi as I am they only serve coke product here.
We all wish this new find of ours a long life in this hard market and they will for sure see us again in the near future as they do have the best enchiladas in town.",hLdd68fn1VP1s7BAZElNhQ,0,0,5,Aq09wooE97NyMzeWhDhovg

The verde sauce was probably one of the best I have had, it was a delicious. I did not care for the mole sauce at all. I like the sweeter mole like at Las Cazuelas. The rice and refried black beans were also good and they gave us a large bag of chips as well. As others have mentioned there was only a small amount of chicken inside. For $12 I think they need to be a little more generous, especially when your not doing the all you can eat. 

Service - 5 stars
Verde sauce- 5+ stars 
Mole - 2 stars
