Gaylord had pretty good food, but the service wasn't great, and it was very expensive for what it was.

Gaylord's was undoubtedly a so so experience. my fiance and I ate dinner there after a few unlucky hands at the four card table at the Rio.  While it was only around 9ish pm there was one other couple in the restaurant (how weird) When I asked the hostess if we needed to make a reservation.. she kindly replied: no just come in (a light bulb in my thick head should have gone off). After we were seated we ordered the chicken pakoras for me as an appetizer (he's a vegetarian and i'm a pure carnivore) Needless to say yuck/blah/tasteless... Next we ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala and Yellow Dal with something called Bullet Naan.  The PTM was off the chart but the dal... I think I could have made better at home... the naan came out burnt and had to be sent back ( the server was pretty nice about it). All in all I think I should know what indian food should taste like but unfortunately I won't be returning to this mediocre restaurant and blowing my bucks on food thats ""commercialized indian"".

2945961,2010-01-25,2,Hz6pXloEBWboBaJuEpk0JQ,"As captives of the Rio and all its sad offerings, Gaylord was one of the few things we enjoyed during a stay at this casino. We were whisked out of the smoke-laden casino area into a tastefully decorated tranquil space. 

Most other eateries were packed with 30 minute waits trying to handle the overflow of a conference held here. With about an hour left to find lunch and return to the conference, we poked our heads into Gaylord.

Talk about underappreciated, the place was nearly empty, with one waiter and one busboy. We scored, with $13 lunch combinations served as a thali with rice and naan. We shared the tandoori combination and vegetable curry combination. 
Very full bellies, lots of leftovers, incuding that lovely naan that we snacked on the next day. Our favorite curry was the one with spinach, peas and paneer.

But we were lucky. As mentioned before, this casino was not prepared for the overflow of hungry conference-goers. We were seated immediately and our food came quickly, sizzling hot. But just 20 minutes later there was a queue out the door, and people waiting frantically to pay their bills and get back to work. 
The place couldn't handle the load with its small staff, and they had to take a lot of heat from impatient people.  Finally, they just had to close and not allow anyone else in, which is a shame because this was the best lunch option available, *especially* for that price.

The Rio seems to attract the kind of clientele that wants burgers and shakes, or buffets. So it's no surprise that Gaylord is staffed with an expectation of low patronage. But seeing how *all* the smaller restaurants in the casino seemed wholly unprepared for the streams of hungry conference attendees, I suspect Gaylord, as well as other places, should have gotten better warning by the casino management of potential increased business from the conference.

For all the harried customers and staff at Gaylord, our waiter took very good care of us, in a timely manner, even getting our leftovers wrapped up quickly and efficiently.",qunxFdBDVl0ordRJEPVNtQ,4,2,4,5NAqOlDOta_EXaHPqJMiTg

4085588,2011-08-26,0,Hz6pXloEBWboBaJuEpk0JQ,"The food was just ""OK"".  Not what you'd expect at these prices.  The chicken was over done to the extreme.  Dry and tough.     I've had much better at half the price, and there was nothing stellar about the service or atmosphere that would justify the high prices either.

I think they rely on gullible people like me, who make the mistake of thinking that because the prices are high, it must be really special.  I've found again and again that there is very little correlation, unless it is inverse, to the price and the quality.

As to it being in a casino, yes, that does matter.  Because I've seen it quite often that a fancy restaurant will set up shop in a casino where they can charge high prices to people who they don't have to worry about coming back, and who are in the mind set of having a good time and not worrying about the money.   Just because they are high priced joint in a casino does not mean that they are bad, but it's a red flag.

And anyone who tells you to disregard the review of someone who has an opinion different from their own, and pronounces that such people are not proper foodies, deserves to have their own review disregarded.

I gave it 3 stars.  I think that could be called generous in light of the overdone chicken ( I'm not the only one to notice this).  3 stars means, according to Yelp, ""A-OK"".   Gaylord is nothing better than A-OK.   You'd be better off trying two other Indian places at random.

Otherwise, for the curious (i.e. my husband) be sure to go equipped with a restaurant.com coupon. I rarely suggest a coupon, but the average curry here is $18! [Eyes popping out of my head!] Even our vegetarian options were right at $15, and they do not include rice. Summary: It is very expensive for Indian food.

However, the serving portions are nice. We ordered three curries, and one order of rice was more than enough to eat with our dinner. 

Before I get to the food, I want to comment on the service and interior. The interior was at one time opulent, but now it is a little worn. It is like dining in an ancient, velvety jewelry box, and it was dark. The ambiance took away from the dining experience for me, as it felt a tad unkempt. They should turn up the lights and redo the interior. Service was not miraculous despite there being a multitude of servers on the floor. Things took a bit longer than they should have. Water glasses ran dry. 

Alas, all of this is making me think that it is a 2-star place, but the day after, snacking on leftovers in the comfort of my home, I realized the food is well-executed. That evening I had thought the food was good, but I was a bit distracted by all of the above. We ordered the dal makhani, baingan bartha and vegetable masala. We requested spicy, and the result was the perfect heat level. The flavors were all complex, absolutely no skimping on spices here. And, each dish had a distinct flavor, which let me know the chef wasn't just mixing up the same batch of curry and throwing a different label on the dish. The leftover meal was notably delicious. If it had been served in a nice, new setting with half the price tag, I would be a fan.

Although the selections aren't as deep as Tamba or Gandhi, the quality of the food definitely makes up for it.  White meat chicken...can you believe it??",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,1,1,4,6Du9PdidoH3FYE6JhA6rtA

Service:  Our waiter kept trying to up sell us food.  Okay, we said we only wanted 1 order of naan bread...why do you insist on selling us 3?!?  

Food:  The food was tasty, but unfortunately I've had better.  We had shrimp, dal, and other tasty varietals.  

Unfortunately, I probably wouldn't go here again.  I'm sure there is better out there.",dRaLq9sF45RYHhKfUd8NMg,0,0,2,nEh8Z82yz6ATxfAwvrX2rg
5780817,2010-02-08,2,Hz6pXloEBWboBaJuEpk0JQ,"i just recently went here for their all you can eat brunch. it is not as good as the regular menu, but i will tell you one thing. IT IS $14!!! ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!!

They still get a 5 star from me, because i know the regular menu is the best ive ever had.

and the brunch is still VERY CHEAP for indian food. many places over charge for indian food. i can go to a little hole in the wall anywhere in america & they will charge me $14 alone for one ala carte item!!!! so thats why i keep them at 5 stars!

if you are craving indian food, brunch will satisfy your craving.

if you really want to live it up, come here for the regular menu. and induldge!!!",xWCDD4AVIVjDfLZp5Qc5yQ,2,2,5,mgcXsY_rAVi6IMvaPrQMvw

However,having eaten at all of the Gaylord's in San Fran over the years,why are the prices 20 to 50 percent higher than in the bay area?

It's like buying a soft drink at the airport,you feel ripped off because you know what the prices should be.

Here's an example:

Tandoori prawns in the SF location are 22 bucks,in the LV location ,it's $30.

That's about a 28% difference in price for the same entrée!

One more shining example,a 1/2 Tandoori chicken is $20 bucks,while, a whole one is $19 bucks in SF.
Over 50% difference in price.

And we're talking downtown SF here,not some place out on the avenues or in a ghetto.

I just can't justify the overcharging for an all right Indian dinner.",rt7gmCNCALr8bqQPluxeOQ,0,0,3,6Wk3NIWtmlwnRN4sI5pmnA
5862340,2011-08-15,0,Hz6pXloEBWboBaJuEpk0JQ,Chicken VERY dry. Had a groupon so didn't pay full price. Not worth the cost they want had MUCH better at Taj Palace off Eastern and Richmar.,Hv_Sk1QTTBgOScage3uiqw,1,0,2,8d3oyMJHyVqaCCpeKnpa-g
