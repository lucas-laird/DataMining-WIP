I arranged for Omar to cater a rehearsal dinner for out of town guests for my cousins wedding. I confirmed my appointment with Omar via the telephone and email. The day of the rehearsal dinner Omar was supposed to show up at 1pm to start setting up and cook. By 2pm he was no where to be found. I looked at the reviews here on Yelp and most of the complaints were that he wasn't timely so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. By 3pm Omar still had not arrived. I called Omar and when he answered he had no idea that he even had an event that day. He completely forgot! My family and I had to run to Costco and cook for 50 people in a moments notice. I tried to call him back to maybe see if he could still cook something but he never answers my calls. He purposely avoided all of my calls. Needless to say, Omar is unreliable. I will never use him and do not recommend him for anyone's catering needs.",IjRMcEN_gdCHpA17o7HfeA,11,2,1,vReg-L9_SqASQbdr8DBVGg

We ordered $400 worth of food and what he delivered was not even $100 worth of food.  The food looked like it came from another party and he forgot the tortillas!  What kind of Taco Man shows up without tortillas? He did not even apologize for being late. The salsa was not freshly made, the beans looked old, chips were from a bag.  When he left to go to buy some tortillas we called him and asked him to come back and pick up his food and he never even came back.  In the end we got the food for free but we couldn't eat it because we didn't know if/when he was going to come back or how old the food really was.

The one bad thing was their tortilla chips.  I wanted a bit more fresh/homemade style tortilla chip and the ones they brought looked and tasted like store bought blandness.  :(  Tacos make up for it though.

4261798,2016-06-02,0,4VjrVv-PBuG-al5JnUUIGg,"Mexican food is our favorite so we had to have tacos for our wedding. We looked up Omar months in advance, set up a time to meet, and made the reservation. 

Fast forward to two weeks before the wedding when I get a final numbers count and send these details to Omar. He emailed me back stating that he did not have a reservation for me. After emailing back and forth for a couple of days and sending him a copy of the reservation and deposit, he agreed to continue to cater our wedding. I did pretty much have a panic attack over it though. 

Then the actually wedding day. We had agreed that food would served at 3:15. At 3:15, our caterer is nowhere in sight. I called Omar and he let me know that they were on their way. Again, a little bit of a heart attack that got better once they showed up. Our hungry guests just drank and danced until he showed up and pounced on those tacos. The man that served the tacos was very sweet and everyone reported that they enjoyed the food very much. My husband and I both did not eat anything because we got so busy, so we rely upon our guests feedback. 

So besides being an hour late and the snafu with the reservation, it is a good choice. The food is decent and the price is amazing.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,9,2,3,tK-AkNm6boooYHYJf46i_Q

4320422,2017-11-02,0,4VjrVv-PBuG-al5JnUUIGg,Worst taco man ever!. We hired them for a wedding and told them we were going to have between 80 and 100 people but on the safe side we told them to make sure there is enough for 125 people so we can have left overs and people can have seconds. First of all they did overcharge us and also said they would be there for two hours and were only there for one hour and ran out of food when there was only 85 people at the wedding and everyone didn't get to eat. The food was not that great either compare to other taco man's that we hired in the past. Very unprofessional and not worth the price for the quantity and quality of food.,sc1NL2KSkIOGz-HEZiz_QQ,2,0,1,NU5EoH1KD0Zm_CZu-xCvNw

This is essentially interactive catering - the menu is on the web site.  You choose your meats, sides, and tortilla type and The Taco Man brings all of the goods and grills out at your place!!  Our host had chicken asada, carne asada, and that other meat I don't eat (but people really liked it!)  I was gluttonous and started with 3 tacos and ended up eating 2 more later.

The corn tortillas were warmed on the grill and piled high with beef and chicken at my request.  Toppings in separate bowls on the table included shredded lettuce, shredded taco cheese, diced sweet onion, cilantro, spicy tomatillo salsa in a squirt bottle, and medium red salsa.  I covered my tacos with everything.  The flavor was phenomenal - so much flavor packed in the little tacos, and they were delicious!  I liked both meats and all of the toppings.  I really enjoyed how sweet the onions were!

This was a really great idea for an outdoor shindig.  I highly recommend checking out The Taco Man to cater your next event!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,4,6,4,hxdIBU6-qLl4YWU_2wO2gQ

The tacos were great and the service was even better. It's so nice to not have to worry about setting anything up or providing anything. They bring all of their own equipment and even plates and utensils. They were so professional and so accommodating. I find them also the most affordable compared to other taco caterers. This year, we planned a last minute party and I went back to the Taco Man. It was literally 3 days before our party that I contacted the Taco Man. I emailed late at night not thinking I would get a response right away, but sure enough early in the morning I already had a response and luckily they were available. Alex with their sales team was so quick and efficient when responding.

On the day of the event Omar's team was there 45 minutes prior to the event. His staff was very professional and courteous. The Tacos were ready to go at the start of the party, and every guest was very pleased with not only the taste, but the amount of food.
At the end of their scheduled time, the chef advised us that is was last call. I thought this was great as it gave every one last chance for more tacos. The meat and chicken were seasoned well, and the salsa was great.

They appeared to have no interest in serving people, spent more time texting on their phones and couldn't answer basic questions about the food. They were left alone serving while Omar left to an unknown location for hours. All of the food was dry and cold, along with the canned beans and rice from a box. The meats (pastor, asada and chicken) had decent flavor, but all of them were terribly dry...especially the asada. They even asked if we had an onion. Really????!!! How does a ""Taco Man"" not have an onion? Absolutely unprofessional!!!!! For $240.00, it was definitely not worth it. Once I explained my concerns to Omar, he apologized  but made excuses as to why the service and food was subpar. Trust me, save your money on this one.

5625718,2017-02-23,1,4VjrVv-PBuG-al5JnUUIGg,"So I was doing my research on who to hire for my son's birthday party and I cam across this business that had pretty good ratings but mixed reviews. I decided to do a taco tasting since this is something they offer(listed on their website). I scheduled this online and received a confirmation. The location is not the best, but that's beyond the point. However, the owner, could not locate my confirmation so I pulled it from my phone. He later then tells me that someone came in the day prior as ""me"" to taco taste. I was confused. Regardless, he told me that we would have to PAY for the taco tasting since it was my son (who is 2), my brother and myself that came in that day. The website states they do complimentary tasting for two people so I figured we would pay for my brother's tacos and since my son is only 2 he did not need to taco taste. I informed him on this but I'm assuming that he jumped to the conclusion that we were all going to be taco tasting. His response was that he doesn't ""feed for free"" and that if we ended up booking with him he would give us a $20 credit. Ok fine, we will pay for the tacos. Turns out their location does not have a card service for payment and only accepts cash. Since we did not intend to order a lot of tacos and it was a small order he decided to not charge us. The tacos were mediocre. We decided to pay him for his tacos and decided not to do business due to the way I was treated. Poor business skills.",Gf4y7IouqD8-ork5RcIXTw,3,1,1,VVgwo21egHLxOJ7IYcvP6g
