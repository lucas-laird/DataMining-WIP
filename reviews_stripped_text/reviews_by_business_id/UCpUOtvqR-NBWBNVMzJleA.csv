19598,2010-07-28,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Met some friends here for an after-work drink- or two.  Around 530PM on a Tuesday evening, the place was about half-full and started to get busier as the everning progressed.  Had no problem finding a table and ample seating in the outside patio area.

The martinis- included the Mango Madness (the go-to drink for my companions), the Red Apple (tasted like cran-apple more than anything), and the Cookies and Cream (sweet, but delicious, complete with oreo crumb rim).  All were good, strong, and tasty.  Pretty sure you can't go wrong with a 'tini with flavors you like.  These martinis are $12-14 a piece, but since it was happy hour (4-8PM), they were half off.  So at $7 a martini, still a bit spendy, but a nice treat.  And, yes, they do give you the mini shaker to ensure you get your entire beverage- just be sure to not let them take it before you've ensured it's empty.

The food-  with food half-off as well, we ordered the BBQ Chicken flatbread (tasty, but mostly bread- more cheese, chicken, sauce please), Spinach-Artichoke dip with Pita chips (pretty tasty), and the Bruschetta (basically chopped tomatos on toasted bread- nothing special).  All of these were regularly around $12 a piece, I believe ($6-ish with happy hour).

The service-  good, not great.  Our waitress actually came around a few times, but only when it seemed like she KNEW we wanted to order something.  Annoyingly, the other people working there would come by every 5 minutes to take our plates, drinks, etc., even when we obviously weren't finished.  We found ourselves consolidating a lot, just to give them something to take.

All-in-all, with HH the bill was $60 (before tip) for 6 martinis, 3 apps, and a coke.  Pretty decent for some quality beverages and nosh.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,0,0,3,P1KvSuKzo3sBUjJ7E0xh6A
21192,2009-09-21,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Came in from out of town and heard good things about Blue Martini so my friends and I decided to check out the happy hour on a Friday night. It was better than I had expected. Since it was located in a strip mall, I expected it to be some sort of low-key bar/restaurant. The mall is nice, upscale and well laid out. 

There was no line at 7 o'clock so we walked right it. The decor was nice, it was definitely better and bigger than i had expected. A live band was playing that night busting out tunes from Bon Jovi and other 80's/90's bands. There are 3 bars inside and all 3 had good looking female bartenders. The food was decent but I wouldn't go here just for the food. I tried the steak sandwich and the flatbread pizza which was decent and since it was half off, it tasted even better. The cocktails didn't taste watered down and I could feel the effects after a few drinks, just the way I like it. 

The crowd was cool. Everyone seemed to be there to have a good time, not to show off. The women there seemed friendly as well with a good mix of people. I never had any trouble getting drinks or food from any waitress so that was definitely a plus. 

I would definitely stop by the Blue Martini during my next visit to Vegas. It's a nice change from the usual strip scene.",WPr_qx8kaCLthVBOKPbeZQ,0,0,4,O5CI7zUnNDVSBgaH13ed1A

I have mostly avoided it since I have been here since I am in town for serious work, not f*ing around (though I must admit to f*ing around a little bit since I have been here).  
Great atmosphere outside on the deck, easy parking and a midweek lack of bazooka-sized slushy drinks, popped collars, completely oblivious gawking and oompa-loompa fake tans.  Just a nice, relaxing atmosphere.
We had the lemon drop and standard Sapphire martinis, the Margherita flatbread, caprese salad and the beef tenderloin with the Vesuvius cake.  They were all very good and well presented.
The one thing I would say about the place is it has a fairly limited menu.  There are about five pages of drinks and wines to two of food.  Not to be confused with a complaint though.  There were ample choices.

We walked in and were immediately greeted by a host and told that it was open seating.  The patio bar area was packed so we chose a table at the inner bar where a band was setting up.  Our waitress came over and took our order.  We ordered a gin martini and a vodka martini and due to us not calling liquor we were poured premium booze for which there was a $2.00 up charge per drink.  For dinner we ordered hummus and the Perfectly Marinated Hot Beef Tenderloin Medallions.  The hummus was good, but the portion was rather small.  However, the beef medallions were amazing.  They were super tender, cooked to perfection and extremely tasty!  

As we were enjoying our drinks, we became aware of the fact that it was warmer in the bar than it was outside, which was rather off putting and the reason we didn't have another drink.  We asked for our check and presented a coupon we had purchased through Living Social.  The waitress became hesitant and said that she didn't think they would honor the coupon due to the fact that people had been printing off the same coupon multiple times and using them over and over again.  We pointed out that each coupon has a specific one time use code to prevent this, but she insisted that was the issue.  She went and spoke to a manager regarding the issue.  She came back and stated that the manager refused to honor the coupon; however, the manager did not bother to come out and talk to us about this issue.",aJvNNSBbbaZYAlKGnOXiSQ,5,0,3,n0rKAXjcY21U06G6i3XVKw

Friends and I went in yesterday using our lady VIP cards (drink ticket), checked in on facebook (drink ticket), used valet coupons (drink ticket) all which we had done before without issue (i'm there on a weekly basis). Well last night we were told that we were ""exploiting"" them by using those tickets because each of us had 2 or 3. I'm sorry it's YOUR loyalty/comp program and we're the ones exploiting it?

But that's not the worst of it.. we decided to move outside on the patio after the manager told us this, finish out drinks, and leave but the manager came back got right up to my friends face and YELLS at her!!! He said we moved tables to try to scam another server. It was ridiculous! Now their cocktail servers are tweeting us saying ""there are two sides to every story"" and that the manager yelling at us HAD to be warranted because the management is ""so easy to deal with"". Are you kidding me??!! What happened to the customer is always right? Especially when we were completely calm throughout this entire situation and did absolutely nothing wrong.

I have been a loyal Blue Martini customer since it opened but I will no longer patronize them when they treat their LOYAL customers this way.

I'm a muture woman who prefers a mature crowd and the music is the best you'll hear in Vegas if you're a true R&B fan. That being said I now need to vent about what happened this past Sunday night 05/24/15. I met a friend there and since I don't come often she reserved a table for the two of us. The price of the table did not include a bottle so we purchased that as well. We also paid for Hookah. We had just started the Hookah and filled our glasses when a great song came on,  so we left to go dance 2 songs. When we returned to ""our"" table there were several people sitting there. When we told them it was our table they said we should speak with the server. We were then informed that our table was cleared and sold because our bottle was empty.....even though we both had full glasses with napkins over them and a full Hookah. Wtf? If it's their policy to boot you from your table once the bottle is empty then fine...I get that they're trying to make money.. but at least give US the option of purchasing another one. I guess what pissed me off the most about all of this was the fact we tipped the server WELL, ahead of time, and she still had an ""I don't give a shit"" attitude. Sad because if she would have treated us right we would have taken good care of her. Even management didn't seem to care an only offered to replace the full drinks....not the table. The only person in all of this that had our back was the Hookah girl. 
  This is bad customer service no matter how you look at it and unfortunately it has left such a bad impression on me that I will likely never come back.

And that's where it started getting worse....
Do they even know what ""service"" means? Tips by definition are product of the proper service (they're not requirement) - good service=good tip and bad service .... you guess no tip!

First we had to chase waitress around to order drinks. I started going towards bar stand but ""security-type"" guy stopped me and said that waitress will come to our table. 10-15 minutes later he ended up taking our drink order himself .... than we had to wait for another 15-20 minutes for drinks to get to our table. 
Than we ordered some food and it took almost 40 minutes to get it (because for some reason 1st time it was delivered to another table!!!)
.... bla bla bla and here we are ready to move on to next venue - not so easy because it took damn waitress another 30 minutes to get my check! Heck!!!! I can forgive anything but NOT WHEN I HAVE TO WAIT FOR MY CHECK! Come on people ... you want your money for your damn overpriced drinks do you?

So I have to confess - first time in all these years I stiffed and left zero tip. I could insult her of course and put few coins in but I was in a decent mood even after all this crap.

(Am I just bitching? May be I am ... but customer is always right, isn't he?)

P.S. While I was standing on the balcony I witnessed a nasty act of hit-and-run - b*tch was trying to turn around (turn, reverse and turn) and hit a car that was parallel parked right in front of BM. Too bad I didn't see plate number otherwise I'd definitely turn her in.

Drinks run about $12-14 each, but half price during Happy Hour -- 4pm to 8pm daily. At $6 each, it's a great deal because they fill up your martini glass and then give you the shaker, so it's like two drinks for one. 

The martini menu is expansive. I've tried a lot of the drinks and they're all good. The only only I ever didn't like was the chocolate bar one. It tasted like straight vodka. But the caramel swirl - yummy!

This last visit was not great due to poor service however, because my server added on a tip to herself of $30 after I signed and paid for my bill and left a cash tip. The restaurant is refunding me but implies it to be an accidental upcharge.... but I fail to see how this could be accidental. Fraud anyone? 
Our sever also was not very good because she took a very long time to service us and the service we did receive was lacking. Waiting 30 minutes for drinks, and not bringing out napkins and plates until after we finished eating is just not OK, among other things. I'm not sure that I will be returning.
We also had a really bad bartender on the same day who was not knowledgeable and didn't seem to know what he was doing at all... and we also waited for a long time. There were 4 of us sitting at the bar together and he didn't think 2 our friends were with us because they are black and there are 2 (I included) who are white (and was going to serve the white girls first before I made a point that we are all together).
The atmosphere is great, clean and classy.

Their happy hour prices a great, even though they've recently increased their prices. The quality of drinks and foods are also great. Their red sangria is my favorite! The bartenders are great at taking care of guests, so I usually sit by the bar areas because I just feel I get better service there. On Friday, June 2, I finally sat at a table outside with a friend and received outstanding service from our server, Lanetriah. She went above and beyond to make sure our drinks and food were up to par, and always checked on us even though she was quite busy. She also engaged in great conversation with us and really made our experience at Blue greater than usual. It's rare to receive such excellent service like this in most places.

Multiple servers walked by carrying food and drinks but never stopped at our table. ""Do we order from the bar?"", we wondered. A server was walking by, ""do we order from the bar?"" ""It's open seating"", she responded. ""Yes, but do we order from the bar?"" ""A server will be with you eventually but you may as well order from the bar."" 

Okay.

I ordered our drinks and, knowing they may take a few minutes to make, pointed to our table five feet from the bar, ""and we are sitting right there."" ""Oh. I'll wave you down when the drinks are done."" 

Okay.

A while later I looked up and our drinks were sitting at the bar and the bartender was just staring at me. I'm not sure how long she was staring at me. Anyway - 

She asked if I wanted to open a tab or pay for the drinks, I said ""I'll pay now"" as I grabbed my wallet. She walked away and started doing something else. A few minutes later she took my card.

The drinks were meh. A lot of ice so they water down quickly, and my Wise Guy tasted like I drove through Sonic with a glass of Jack Daniels and asked the employee to give me a few ""flavor shots"", but whatever - mediocre food and drink can often be tolerable if it comes along side exceptional and/or better than usual customer service. 

Honestly what stuck out to me the most was when she brought me the check - they couldn't even bother to remove the cap from the pen before handing it to me.

Here you will find a large local/industry based crowd as well as some wandering tourists.  The drinks and food are great and Wednesdays is Ladies night.

If you plan on going to party here please be advised they do have a dress code for the  later hours, so please save yourself the trouble and come proper!  You can also get bottle service here for a reasonable price and is always a more fun route for groups of people.

Now I came here on a WEDNESDAY at 930 and the women at the door says I need to pay a cover charge or buy a $25 bucket of beer. First off Wednesdays are suppose to be ladies night because I've been there plenty of times after 10 with NO cover and half off drinks all night. Second I don't drink beer so I don't want that I wouldn't have spent well over $100  on just hard drinks alone and that's without food or hookah. So you're telling me u rather me pay $25 for a bucket of shit i dont want or the door cover that is not typically charged at the time I came, over spending the hundreds I typically do?????

The venue puts our regular deals through groupon.com and livingsocial.com, so you should keep an eye out for them if your wanting to try the place out for the first time.

Wednesday nights are ladies night, and Friday & Saturday nights turn into a night club. They start off with a band playing then a DJ takes over to finish the night off

**Make sure to get there before 11pm on the weekends as that's when  they start to charge a $20pp cover fee

The place is inside TownSquare located in the back of the center and in front of the Rave movie theater upstairs, so park in the back lot.

They also have happy hour everyday from 4-8, which is also a nice added bonus. I recommend the lobster salad and the cheese/fruit place for sharing.",yo5h5WBCPqxibaQxkh0p3A,2,0,5,q8hoTkbcjVEhn71dkO5Bng

I flew all the way from Seattle to Vegas to celebrate my 40th bday. Thinking, this place will be a good place for me, my sisters, brother in laws n husband a place to enjoy n celebrate my bday. Well, let me tell u.. we were so disappointed n wrong. I couldn't believe how poor ur management n security handle situation when u had too much to drink. Yes, I admitted had drunk too much that I did actually vomited inside ladies restroom.  
Not to the point, that I made a mess on the floor or did not make it to toilet. I managed to walked n did my business inside ladies room. I managed to clean n flush the toilet to make sure it was spottless. 

As soon as I went back to r booth.. one of the security guard was talking to my brother in law n want us to leave because according to him.. I was too drunk to be there. At that time, I was just sitting n drinking my water observing n thinking.. what the hell is going on. We left r booth n waited for r parties on the waiting area to take care of r bill. Again, this security guard told us that we can't be there n have to leave the premises. That time, was already getting pissed off n heated up by the way they treated us. We got to this place @9pm n listened to the live band(sounded good by the way) enjoyed listening to them.

We took advantage of they'r 2hrs unlimited drink for price of$47 Ithink.  We ordered drinks n enjoyed drinking. That's the reason why we were there for, right. Well, if u guys r offering unlimited drinks in ur lounge expect that u will have drunk people. I had fly me to the moon, mai tai n rum n coke. Hmm, 3drinks within 2hrs was not WORTH IT!! that 3drinks for me was enough that I had too much already n had already gone to restrm. Well, after 2hrs they told us we can't stay in r booth  n we need to moved. But if we want to stay, we have to order drink to keep the booth.  Orderd a bottle of bombay n juice just to keep r booth. They suck u up to order so u can keep ur booth. Again, why did u guys kicked us out coz I had too much to drink n can't handle myself(according to them) but yet, u offered us to ord more drinks to keep r booth. 
Not only we got kicked out @12:30 at night(still too early didn't even got a chance to dance on the dance floor). 

I found out next day r bill was $800.00. What  the f***, how much again for party of 8. Come to find out they did 2 separate bill. First, 2hrs bill unlmted drinks so about $400 plus r food chips dips maybe $500 + gratuity of course there were 8 of us 15 or 20% of r total bill. Had another bill they chg after 2hrs+gratuity again of course. Oh, wait there is more another charge for the booth we reserved but did not tell us we have to move after 2hrstotally shocked at this lounge.. billed us twice gratuity that's 40% no wonder r billed was $800. We didn't even finished r drinks that was ordered after that 2hrs unlimited coz u kicked us out. 

Now, u guys tell me if I was out of control that night.. as far as I know.. didn't say anything nor made a scene to get kicked out. The only time that I started dropping the f** word when I found out that we were getting kicked out coz of me. My only mistake was.. I had too much to drink n I threw up in the ladies room using the toilet bowl n did not made a mess. If I had too much too drink..then why the Hell do I remember all this.!! that's because,  I was not toxicated at all!! I think ur mgmt n security guard did so poorly judging me that I was belligerent n not able to contempt myself just because I threw up in the ladies rm. 

Thx, blue martini for ruining my 40th bdy n made me think that ur night club will be an epic place to be. I was looking forward to celebrate n enjoyed myspecial day that night with my family but instead worst time of my life. A night that I will never forget..disappointed place to celebrate ur special day. Ur security guard looked at me like I was being belligerent n can't handle myself. Again, u can't judge a person just the way they look n act. 

Understand, protocol n security of others is ur priority. But also need to realize ur lounge serving alcohol will not expect that customers will not get drunk. I felt humiliated getting escorted by ur security which until now.. still trying to find out WHAT I DID WRONG THAT NIGHT.
Ur security need much training when to act or escort people out on how much they've drink. He judge me so poorly that I was not able to handle myself. I did not trash ur place, bother anyone nor I vomited in front of everyone. 

Not my recommendation to celebrate special day coz they judge u on how u look if u had too much to drink. My 1st time getting kicked out on my 40th bdy n in Vegas.. Way to go Blue Martini... this should be negative zero star but not able to post my reviews if i don't click at least a star.",wioO6bNzR5UgAiAdJn3JGA,1,0,1,MTomMMjoauH_hQbj_aLUxQ

It definitely has a chill vibe since we go there majority for live acoustic music. Haven't been disappointed with the entertainment but it's another thing when it comes to service.. We came in through the door, stood for a while near the entrance. No one seemed to have noticed we existed and we had employees of the company pass by us many times and still not recognize we needed to be seated. After a good 8 minutes we decided to look for a empty table for three and sat. A server then made time to come check up on us but did not take any orders. It's weird how the place is compact, so you find yourself sitting 5 feet away from the next table so I would assume it would be easier from customer to customer. I went up to the bar and ordered drinks from the bartender instead since our server really had no intentions of catering to our needs.

Well I had several Martinis of different flavors and they were delicious, but there was no alcohol in them.  I was so disappointed. Happy hour prices should not interfere with how the bartenders make the drinks. I felt it was a rip off. Especially since I had attended a function several months later at the Marriott hotel, and the Blue Martini was there advertising and giving out free ""mini"" martinis to try and promote themselves. Well one of their ""mini"" martinis gave me a buzz.  One thing I don't appreciate is false advertising.  I don't drink alcohol very much.  But when I do order a martini, I expect alcohol.  I hate it when I hear of bartenders watering down drinks.  Bar tabs can be pricey, so why not give the people what they are paying for.

Unfortunately, they have a dress code after 8pm and its strictly enforced. I was dressed nicely in a polo shirt with loafers but was refused entry because they won't admit anyone in shorts. It doesn't matter that its a Wednesday or that its 100 degrees in Vegas tonight. Ridiculous if you ask me.

757563,2011-08-01,1,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"With this review, I'll start off with 5 stars and start subtracting stars for things I found off with the place:

Start - 5 stars
-1 star - $20 cover on a Wednesday night, really?
-1 star - Wednesday is ladies night, but it was definitely a sausage fest, clever marketing team you've got there...
-1 star - pricey drinks for a place that is not close to the strip
Bottom line - 2 stars

It's too bad because I wanted to like this place after talking to my friends who live in Vegas and have gone many times in the past.  I think they go for the happy hour specials but this review was for getting in around 11pm on a Wednesday night.  I was told that it was ladies night but I guess a bunch of guys got the same memo so the sausage to taco ratio was skewed toward the sausages.

On top of that, the drinks were pretty weak for what they charge - $9 for Stoli and a mixer and you can barely tell there is alcohol in your drink.  My friends were paying $12 or $13 for martinis but I guess they give you a little more since they give you the shaker to take with you and pour the rest when you're ready.

Would I come back?  Maybe...  I think I'll have to show up for happy hour since it seems like that's when they have the best deals but I wonder if they will charge a cover just to get into happy hour??",bSY04kIrbB3J9cyNBiKfcQ,0,0,2,zMkaFCZ0uOQRBQLhk3vRoA

There was an entry fee which I thought it was weird for a restaurant. We ordered a bottle of Coconut Ciroc so we can get a table. Initially we were given the option for a table that was in the middle of the dance floor basically or a more secluded table. After given the option and us choosing the more secluded area, we were sat in the middle of the ""dance floor"" because the other section was closed (btw the table we were offered and told was closed after was empty). We were a group of 8 and couldn't be properly accommodated because the tables, which fit 6 max, we're screwed to the floor. Then they bring the bottle we ordered, already open, and the waitress pours out a couple of drinks without mixers and walks away. First sip we all took, it was clear that this ""Ciroc"" we ordered was NOT Ciroc!!!! It watered down vodka of who knows what!!!!! This is a table full of people that drink nothing but Ciroc and even the other people around us that tasted it can clearly tell it was not Ciroc!!!!!! So we call them back over and have them taste it themselves. First guys face after his first sip was priceless!!! He stuttered so hard when trying to explain that this never happened here before and blah blah blah...bs!!!! The bar ""manager"" comes over and opens a bottle in front of us and literally argues us down that it tastes the same but she wouldn't do anything to accommodate and clearly lacked any type of customer service skills!! She just kept arguing and laughing like this was some type of game they played on a regular!! So we tell them to take their bottle back and charge for the 5 drinks they half poured. We start to walk out without signing the check that sat next to the untouched drinks, and they follow us out demanding we sign the check. We asked for the manager to come out, and some other guy named ""Paul"" comes out...doesn't say a word to anyone, doesn't introduce himself, wouldn't even look us in the eye while we tried talking to him!!!!! Security followed and surrounded us like when all we wanted was to talk to this guy but clearly they felt threatened...so bad that it wasn't until I turned around and told them to back off that they stopped following us around!!! When we explained what the issue was and the fact that we got an open bottle and their bar manager refused to give us a sealed one, his response was ""our corporate policies are to open our bottles behind the bar....and you wouldn't go red lobster, order a lobster and tell them to take it back because u didn't like it""...followed by ""next time try Pizza Hut""...wow really!? At that point it was clear that this place along with that whole crew was a joke!! We signed the check just to get out of there and actually have a real drink!!!! We ended up at Gold Spike off Fremont st which is always a great time but by then we were all sick from the poison Blue Martini gave us. I will NEVER go there again and will be sure to spread this around!!!! I have visitors often and this city isn't very big so this WILL get around!!! And this review is just the beginning...Blue Martini will get what's coming to them!! And I will be reporting this illegal bs they're trying to pull off....be ready to have that little liquor license revoked Blue Martini!!!",ILhs05tT-EokLkEkz36Spg,1,0,1,dYwZtosJALoMlmmYprdzjQ

It's fairly upscale and a lot nicer than traditional 'beer focused' bars: which our city has hundreds of. If that is what you are looking for, swing a stick and you will hit 5 of them. There is a PT's pub on almost every main road. And this isn't one of those places.  It's a martini lounge. And I like the principle of the $10.00 cover charge, because it helps keep the rabble out. Ten dollars is not a ton of money. And seriously, if a ten dollar cover is tough for you to come up with; you should probably be out looking for a better job rather than stewing over that. Think of it as a public service fee for discouraging the dregs of society from being in attendance. And even with it being that simple of a concept, it works! I bring my customers here and they always have a good time. And I don't have to worry about them ending up in a bar fight with a bunch of blue-collar tools. Moving on .... Happy hour is a bargain IMHO. The martinis they pour are potent and made with good label vodka. I agree that it can get a little pricey if you aren't enjoying happy hour.

They obviously sell quite a few martini's; over twenty kinds on the menu. We tried 6. My top two from those were the Brazilian (Acai berry martini) good balance of scent, favor, and tartness & there Carmel martini- really good, very sweet. The prices range from 12-14 dollars which is a bit expensive; pay attention to the description of the martini, a few have top shelf liquor on the list of ingredients. You get more quality in some than others. 

The patio area was nice and not very crowded; nice solid wood chairs, fine counter tops and intimate lighting. Good service and attractive wait staff add to the experience. One thing I enjoyed was that they had a bathroom attendant with all the bells and whistles including linen to wash your hands. Do tip, it shows class and character especially if you're spending already. 

Those details lead me to believe the restaurant takes themselves seriously. I recommend ordering the fruit and cheese platter -serves 3 and the presentation is a delight. The cost is around 14 dollars but a value especially when split. I would avoid beer - no selection and wine - expensive unless you're a high roller. I saw a few groups doing bottle service.

The wine my friend ordered was obviously watered down, unfortunately I can't remember the name of the wine. I ordered one of their ""specialty martinis"" and it was definitely special... Even though I had not finished the special martini, I decided to try a very simple martini to see if the bartender was just out of his/her game for the first. I ordered a Vesper, a very common martini, and even explained what was in the drink so they did not confuse it.  3 part Gin,1 part Vodka, 1/2 part Vermouth, and a lemon twist - A simple mixed martini. What I received was a mess of vodka and vermouth. The waitress set the drink down and asked, ""Did you want olives or lemon?"" I replied, ""Lemon..."" (as explained when I ordered the drink). She returns with three lemon wedges, one of which was already squeezed and left in the cup. I asked for the check then she proceeded to stand by the register for another 10 - 15 minutes and text in my line of sight. I was only 20 feet away from her. I will not be returning to this place.

We sat at the bar out by the patio area.

It took forever to get the bar tender to even get our drink orders since apparently he was deciding to flirt with one of his co-workers that night.  Finally got our drinks (which I will admit weren't bad) but then it took another 15 or 20 minutes before we were able to order any appetizers since apparently every one decided to go on break or something.

After we finally got our appetizers (which were okay but nothing amazing) it was an evening full of having to ask 3 or 4 times for other beverages, even asking for water about 3 times and never getting it( again we were right at the bar, and by now there were maybe only 5 other tables in the whole place being occupied).

Their food is actually not bad and they have this complimentary cocktail for ladies, which is a great selling point.

I was expecting a five star service at this casual dining place but it was so bad that it's ever worst than the worst Chinese restaurant at Chinatown ---- at least they take you order and feed you!!!

Finally the waitress came and took our drink order, we ordered a vodka martini and a water. She walked away so fast, leaving me no time to order any food. After about 10 mins, we caught a moment to place our food order. After a few minutes, she returned with 4 glasses of water in a tray and gave us one. My martini didn't come so I asked for a water from her. She said she'd get me one and gave the other three to another table. I bet they didn't even ask for it as they just sat down. She never returned with my water. What pissed me off the most is that she kept serving tables that already have food or drink an ignoring us, who don't have anything on the table. She's either a bad waitress who doesn't give a shit to her customers, or she a racist who only serves white people.

1086950,2016-08-13,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Terrible interaction with the local community.  Let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, Blue Martini does not take reservations on Sunday night. They actually are attempting to change a Bar Restaurant into a Night Club on Sunday nights. 
Neo-Soul, a promotion company operating on Sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on Sundays.  On Sunday August 7, 2016, I visited the Blue Martini as I always do several times a month.   During my visits I normally spend  around 100 dollars.  After checking online banking I discovered that I have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid May.
Yesterday I ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  I waited 45 minutes for my wings.  I look forward to eating BM wings on Sunday since it is the only day that I eat Chicken.   Half way through my chicken wings a Neo soul representative came over to where I was sitting with a retired engineer.and a VA Nurse.
The unknown Neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  The first thing out of his mouth was ""Other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. He further stated, I have to ask you if either of you two are disabled"" (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. I was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while I ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. I assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  Instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for Profit.  The promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of Restaurant Regulations.  "" if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool"".  Meaning,If a patron orders food from a Blue Martini Bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  MUST be provided. Blue Martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for Neo Soul to increase it profits.  The Neo Soul rep. appeared surprised when I produced my Armed forces Veterans disability ID as if he was not expecting that. I explained to him I was a Desert Storm Veteran and retired from the armed forces and Las Vegas Metro.  He then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  I was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that I could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  I asked him if there was an emergency and why I could not eat my last two chicken wings.   I explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  He said ""Let's take the disabled veteran out of it"".  I asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. It is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  The Neo Soul rep also felt it necessary to have a Blue Martini Security officer stand by as a ""Show of Force."" We took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  Neo Soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that Neo could increase profits.  Neo Soul is confusing Blue Martini with nightclub practices. Neo Soul and Blue Martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant/Bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  Lastly, He continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.  

Neo Soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are 
false. The first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool. 

Secondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.  
Lastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.  

The entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the Neo Soul rep.  The rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  I would like to reiterate the fact that,  You absolutely cannot make reservations. This entire ""rigged system""  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional Neo Soul reps desperate to make more money. 

I asked  to speak with a Manager at this point.  This manager can only be described as stocky, Latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  He was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the Neo Soul representative's behavior.  He further stated that Neo Soul Rep was unprofessional and to contact Scotty M immediately.
Additionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and I said ""thank you but If you could give us some drink tickets instead.",rim7FCi4BZMcv7KcaGt5IA,3,0,1,AdXdMAyjcibr5CNp9pEpMg

INDUSTRY SPECIALS! These people know how to treat those hard working strip workers. After a hard day (or hard day's night) of dealing with moron tourists (if you're not offended by that, you're not one of them), you head on over to Blue Martini and get a whopping 50% off your bill.

The drinks are fairly good too. Not too weak, not too strong. It's like Goldilocks found Baby Bear's liquor cabinet. Juuuuuuuust right.

I hear the food is decent too, but we didn't have any.

Here's the problem though: my friend and I who went tonight are both 21+x years old (where x is less than 8). Yet when we went in, we felt really really young.

Really young.

Like, it shouldn't be called Blue Martini. It should be called Cougar Martini. There was more plastic surgery in there than Joan Rivers and Cher COMBINED. Those who hadn't had it done looked like Magda. (Ryan, did you just make a ""There's Something About Mary"" reference? Yup.)

And the music was lame. There was this godawful cover band playing, and when they finally said they were going to play something ""original"" it wound up being a fun little ditty called ""Please Don't F*ck With My Heart."" So charming. Where's Simon Cowell when you need him?

Am I being too harsh? Too bad. When I go to a bar or lounge or club, I need good atmosphere and strong drinks. The drinks were okay but the atmosphere was terrible. But 50% off everything, can't beat that. So I'm not boycotting it, I'm just not going out of my way to go.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,0,2,2,JiHALPdtmELH49jLTXCw8A

And fyi - on the weekends, the cover is $5 per person guys & girls. 

Dress code is not strict for women of course. Men on the other hand, they won't allow you to wear sneakers. You can wear a shirt and jeans just have nice dress shoes with it!",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,1,0,4,M70BA3t6YF_NN7gGCRJEkA

We have been to other lounges and clubs, and when you tell them you just want a water or something non alcoholic they don't give you the best vibe. But BM is not that way and we are just comfortable there. If I feel like the crowd is getting too out of hand and people are not capable of handling their liquor I just say it's time for us to go.

We paid over $700 for table service, but we were strong armed by the front door men when some of our party had to go in and out to settle their tab with valet.

And even though we paid such an outrageous price for 2 bottles of alcohol, our mixers were lukewarm and of very limited selection.  We even had to take the ice bucket back and forth to the bar because service was so poor.

And the music mix was just plain strange, the DJ wasnt quite sure which vibe he was sticking with for the night.  Add to that a very tiny dance area.

I work in the industry and now at the door they want your BM Industry card AND Gov't ID so they can put info in their computer about you. It was hot outside and it holds up the process. I guess now they are moving on to direct marketing or perhaps even selling it to other organizations. They, seriously, want your phone number, email and address! For half off of many $14.00 drinks I guess that information is worth something to someone.

Walking in this place has this terrible smell of burnt pizza... all the time. I walk past this completely empty bar with two bartenders standing around and when I approach one bartender passes me off to another. I assure you a cranberry vodka takes two minutes to make. They have this weird habit of stapling this big piece of paper to my receipt and its quite irritating. Anyway, I proceeded to the function and needed another drink and they wanted to charge me $14 for a drink. I had show them my wrist band to get it half off and even then it was $8. I mean come on lady and BM. Half of $14 is not $8. 

The last time I came I ordered a pizza and it was as if they had a promotional contract with Ritz Crackers. The pizza was about as dry as a Ritz and the toppings were hard to spot. A sprinkle of cheese here and basil leaf there- voila Margherita pizza. Needless to say I didn't bother with the food this time.",4vj_0BQeXjCyNB7ESS5mGg,0,0,3,digE73RdDeYGGDnuFpwGhQ

On top of that, when I visited in mid-December, I was told to remove my baseball cap, charged $5 for a ""security"" fee on top of the $20 cover charge (applied to men only) and when I left the establishment, the Blue Martini and their staff had lost my hat entirely!  Gone.  Someone STOLE it.

They told me to screw off and after I wouldn't leave and demanded to speak to a manager, he begrudingly gave me $40 to replace the hat.

The drinks r just bad, artificial Sirup drinks filled up with ice. They don't use real fruits. So mango is a yellow Sirup. For the price they charge I expect them to use fresh mango purée at least .

Mister ordered a blue martini ? Not good either. Food wise we had the shrimps cocktail . It was good (1 star for the food) and the Brie with fruits (very yummy) 

The girls there look stressed out and r not smiling at all. At least they r cute looking ( maybe that and the food attract the ppl, can't be the drinks)

First, they have a stage which is really cool because they have live bands. When I was there this cover band was doing songs from the 80s. But they kept playing crappy songs from the 80s instead of the hits. No big deal. The time before that they had another band which did a good job covering modern songs. My biggest complaint is the food selection. I came here starving and was looking forward to getting good food to eat, but their selection sucks. They don't have much to choose from and the things they have aren't that great.

I got the chicken (I believe thai peanut flavored) and it was something I'd eat if I was on a healthy diet. When I come to a place like this I want cheeseburgers, chicken tenders, wings, something!

I spoke with the hookah attendant on what i wanted and she quickly brought over our hookah. The down fall there is that the flavor lasted all of 15 mins before it need to be ""ashed"" once that was done the flavor didn't taste the same at all. Tasted more like burnt coals than the flavor I asked for. 
Wednesday is ladies night. Half off drinks I was told at the entrance. About 5 mins at the table before the hookah arrives I placed an order for a chilled shot of Hennessy. The hookah arrives first then a few moments later so does the shot. Keep in mind I'm expecting this one shot to be half price. No one at the door mentioned any stipulations nor did the waitress mention any when she took my order. I sat there and smoked my flavorless hookah and sipped on my drink. When it comes time to leave I ask for my card and tab. The Hennessy is listed for full price. I inquire about the half off drinks I was told about and the waitress needed to ask someone else about it. Hennessy is top shelf alcohol and is not an option for half off. That is not stated anywhere nor was I informed by anyone helping me that Hennessy is not available to be reduced. If I would have know that I would have ordered another type of cognac. 
My main concerns were having to wait long periods of time in between getting the waitresses attention and her doing what I asked. The hookah was horrible. And nothing was done to accommodate this. The worst part was the manager  Shawn admitted the waitress was in the wrong and was going to do nothing about my situation. The best he could do was 30% off my shot.

I've been there for events, birthdays, New Years, or just casual nights. I definitely keep coming back because of the good food and great drink menu. Plus you can't beat the happy hour menu 4-8pm daily. Not just mon- fri. The service is always a hit and miss. I've had really great out going servers but I've also had crappy ones who couldn't give a dam. All the bus boys/barbacks are great tho, I swear they work harder then the servers. The staff is always changing, I think only twice I've had to he same server. I love the environment as well because you can either sit outside on the patio or inside. They always have great music. Every night is different so definitely check there social media to see what the theme is. Wednesday's are ladies night, Thursday's are Latin night, Friday's are live bands, Saturday's change from a special event or top 40's music/remix, and Sunday nights are Neosoul. Hookah is available outside as well, you can only smoke hookah inside after 10pm. 

If you plan on getting a table for an event don't expect any great deal of service. I wanted to get a table for my birthday last year and getting a hold of someone was very difficult. You have to speak with James, but he's number always goes to Voicemail and never calls you back. I was very frustrated and didn't care for it anymore but then my boyfriend called and his phone call was returned right away and it was all set up in one day. My friend had the same issue, she had a hard time getting a table for an Event when Pitbull was going to be there. I don't know if he doesn't like doing business with women or what, but his attitude complete changes when he talks to a man. For that reason I never ordered a table again. 

My latest concern was just last night, when my credit card and Id was misplaced and given to someone else. With all the fraud and identity out there anyone could of easily taken my cards. From now on I will never open a tab there again. I will simply pay as I go and keep my cards.",xC9VktWWiqS8Y3aiLKtqYg,1,1,4,-LyVnNvsoGuSfMocBn3UNw

What kind of place does that? You would think after you purchase 3 bottles you would get service and since this place was just on the news for roaches at the outside bar, they would try to have better customer service to make up for that. But nope! I even wanted to spend more money there by also buying drinks at the bar. Again - waitress was very rude no smile and seemed overwhelmed when it wasn't even busy. You would think that due to them being dead slow they would appreciate the business. Nope. I'm a local and they have just lost my business.

This place really wasn't so bad. Popped in here last night after 2am. Yes, I was sober, so yes, I can judge. Crowd was mixed. Lots of mountain lions more commonly known as cougars. 

Pete's Dueling Piano Bar (just across the way) closes at 2, so the overflow crowd comes here. My friend ordered a Dirty Martini. I think that means this individual chose to get drunk. I respect that. It looked quite vicious, and came with the shaker for the overflow. Wow. I used the word overflow twice in one paragraph. Who AM I?

This music is fun. Your usual top 40 ""jams"". Apparently there was a cover charge, but my friend and I pretended like we knew what we were doing and walked through the ""other side"" of the ropes, cuz that's how we roll. Also, I'm kind of a big deal. Ok. Maybe not. But I like to think I am. Don't judge.

Outside has a fairly large hookah section with a couple of TV's that show ESPN highlights. Friendly for the gentleman crowd.

Fun place to hang out. Club vibe, without it actually being a club. Single women dancing with eachother and making out for attention. (That gave it an extra star. I started writing this with three stars). 

Worth a visit. I think next up on my Vegas list is Cadillac Ranch. 

And it really isn't as douchy as my fellow Yelperations say. At least not at 2 in the morning. The party's still jumpin and my momma aint home. (Credit: Snoop Doggy Dogg)",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,3,1,4,kLbtZDC3c1YNI9qN2TNMQQ

The DJ played a good mix of new and old-school hip-hop. And there were plenty of tables to sit down and take a break. There was also a photographer going around taking pics and selling them. I paid $20 for a nice quality pic and gave it to my friend as a bday gift.

The place is huge, bars setup everywhere, live music playing, food served quickly and drinks of only top shelf live here. Their lobster tacos came highly recommended so we ordered one of those (18.00) and their sashimi salad (12.00), perfect... Still a little hungry we ordered their artichoke spinach dip which we both agreed their pita chips should have been soft bread or just normal chips as the pita chips were rock hard intentionally of course...

The crowd was truly mixed, so many people of all different ages, backgrounds and types. Anyone can feel comfortable here and when we went Saturday night we had no issues getting in, (they do check ids) and no issues with clothing (jean, red shirt, coat) and non-dress shoes.

Blue Martini has an incredible happy hour that lets you take full advantage of all they have to offer, accept the Hookah.  Is it just me or is their hookah overpriced?  Maybe that's why in all the times I have been there I have never seen anyone doing it.

Located in a shopping center you can shop til you drop.  I advise you to shop FIRST then come here.  Once you get started during happy hour you wont be able to stop.

I'm from the Bay Area but was visiting Vegas to celebrate my partners birthday. Her friend, a local thought this would be a good place to grab a bite, hear some tunes, and grab a drink. 

Food: 
Menu was quite small, although it was a bar scene so I guess you can't expect too much. We ordered the crab and shrimp dip (only came with 6 small banquette slices , $2 for 6 more), and pepperoni flat bread ( came out cold, and I was given a hassle by the server and runner when I requested a new one o be mad) overall my food experience was horrible, should have went downstairs to the yard house.

Service: 
The host was friendly, staff were smiling, and the manager handled my food discrepancy very professionally.

Drinks:

Their martinis are STRONG, and when you order one it's pretty much like getting 2 for 1 because they give you the little shaker to refill your drink!  Even better ;)

We had fun, we girl danced and got the birthday girl up on the raised dance stage.  The drinks were well made and both servers we had were on it.  It's a beautiful venue.  It's just that the chemistry of the people seemed to not be clicking.

Gracious and most efficient Graciela and Braxton present excellent people skills, professionalism and care, this makes them truly a phenomenal combination.  Our Bellinitini, The Brazilian, and The Espresso martinis were 5 star.  We dined on lobster salad, lemon-pepper chicken and our seared tuna with calamari salad are delicious.  We enjoyed baked brie for our appetizer- divine!!  Our night was complete with fine dining only matched by the superb attention to detail and vibrant staff named above.

Upon getting to the front of the line, I saw a familiar face from back home (what are the odds) and he let me and my friend in without cover. Started off good so far.

I began ordering drinks, and they were so much more affordable than what I had spent over the weekend on the strip. It was definitely refreshing to see some normal-ish prices. The bar was quick and efficient even though it was a very busy night. Cute blond bartender girls were very friendly. I kinda stuck around the bar for a while with my friend and she volunteered to be my wing woman. I thought this could potentially be a great idea. And there were plenty of pretty girls there, but I realized one thing in the middle of it... A lot of people there already knew one another.. Definitely a locals spot.

The thing I love most about Vegas, is just meeting random people from all over the country/world. And normally people on vacay are so much more open to meeting new people as well. The thing about local spots is a lot of girls and guys travel in packs and they already have their little clique. Even in big cities, this tends to be the case because people usually meet up with too many friends of the opposite sex. Although, I pretty much knew most of the relationships in the bar were platonic, I wasn't about to set the wrong jealous friend off. Plus I was having such a great time with my friend, drinking and dancing. She was a great hostess!!

Blue Martini was a good little experience for me. I'd try it again, but for a traveler/visitor.. I would definitely recommend the parties on the strip...",chmWVpPMEyXcx8tgWdIcVQ,4,2,3,1l-TwRvD6PiAQKXxYPI60g

I was worried it would be an uptight, pretentious ""martini bar"" and was so happy to find it to be exactly the opposite. They have so much more than just standard martinis, play top 40 music, and have several TVs for sports. 

Their happy hour is fantastic! It runs later than most and offers real special pricing on all food and drinks. Wednesday night is ladies night and all ladies get half off drinks all night; local ladies- for even more perks, join their Lady Blue program for a free drink EVERY NIGHT! (After 8pm)

2011790,2008-10-28,7,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Viva Las Vagueness!

Man, they ruined that song by turning it into a Viagra commercial. Can I get a witness? I mean, seriously. I hear that song and I start seeing blue, which brings me to my review of Blue Martini. 

Here's how it breaks out, and let's start with the good:

1. Hot patrons (for me, the women).
2. Hot waitresses (yes, they're female as well)
3. Large and roomy venue.
4. Indoor AND outdoor space.
5. Waitresses=hot.
6. Did i mention there were a large number of attractive women of the female persuasion there?
7. The place was mostly populated by locals, which gets you away from the rotund, behemouth, gargantuan, midwestern, muumuu-clad tourists that seem to permeate the Las Vagueness vicinity.
8. See numbers 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 above.
9. They have a happy hour that offsets #2 under the ""not as good"" section below. Unfortunately, we weren't at it.  Bah.
10. They're open LATE, i.e., like 4:00am.

The not as good:

1. My ""Blue Martini"" was blue, but it wasn't a martini. It was also overly sweet.  They have other ""martinis"" that I didn't try, but perhaps those are better. 
2. $12 martinis feels like NYC, price-wise, and let's be serious; this is Vegas, not NY.
3. $6 domestic beers.
3a. $8 foreign beers.
4. The lovely waitresses lost one of my party's credit card.  That kind of put a damper on the evening temporarily.
5. Service was a little uneven, but we got hugs from the waitress, so uh, let's just leave it at that.
6. At a venue filled with hot chiquitaz, they managed to seat us next to a table full of gay men, which would have been ok, except one of them was rubbing his ass up against me after having hit on me.  I could have lived without that, mos' def.
7. It's a little ways out of town, and as any of you who have been to Vegas recently knows, cab rides are freakin' astronomical. Don't be surprised when it costs some bucks to get there, but hell, you're in Vegas where ponying up is part of the reason you go, am I right?

Overall, this is a fun joint. The band was playing bad cover tunes, but hey, it's Vegas, you can forgive them. It was more than made up for by the quality of the eye candy therein, etc, and what have you. In between band sets they played some cool 80's tunes, which seemed to work nicely.

If you're in Las Vagueness, hit up Blue Martini. I'll be sure to go there again next time I'm in town.",azupW8UYwIzcFGchoEz-Dg,9,6,4,Tpbuh6DXt_ZWDR8PcCMtbw

However, when the drinks are half-off (i.e. happy hour) or free (i.e. private party), it's not so bad. The bartenders definitely pour the drinks quite strong (think almost straight vodka). And the martinis can be quite tasty (if not overly strong) - and there's a nice, expansive menu of them.

My boyfriend and I were visiting Vegas to spend time with his family for the holiday. His mom and sister got to Blue Martini about 30/45 minutes before us to save a table (they had an event going on this night). Then my boyfriend, his aunt, and myself arrived and met them there. We ordered drinks, which were EXTREMELY overpriced, but we were enjoying our time until one of the workers randomly came up to our table and started to harass us. His first words were ""excuse me, but we just saw on the camera that you guys came in through the fire escape"" .. SERIOUSLY WTF? Who in their right mind just comes up to a group of CUSTOMERS accusing them of such bullshit when it was FREE to get in?! So then my boyfriends mom straight up told the guy that we didn't even all arrive together, and to let us enjoy our time. A couple minutes later, our waitress came back to the table, so we asked to speak to a manager. The manager came out, was VERY rude & unprofessional, and had the nerve to continue to accuse us of ""going up the fire escape"".. not to mention that it was FREE ADMISSION. He went on and said "" I saw in the tape someone you looked just like you (pointed to my bf's aunt & sister).. Why in the world would 4 women WEARING HEELS, try to enter a club through a fire escape in the first place?! He also continued to say ""a group of 5 people"" when referring to ""the tape"" when WE DID NOT ARRIVE TOGETHER. At this point, we all wanted to leave because there's absolutely no way anyone should be accused like that for something so stupid. Then my boyfriend told the manager he was going to talk to the bouncer at the FRONT DOOR who let us in, and he had asked him to tell this manager that he checked us in and we came in from the front. Once the bouncer told his manager that, he said the only thing he could do was apologize. Are you kidding me?! You're going to ruin 5 people's night, accuse them all of something they didn't do, make them want to leave, and the only thing you can do is apologize?!

Local ladies can sign up for a Blue Lady card which will get you a free martini any night of the week from 4pm to 10pm. Not bad.

As far as people watching goes, this place is a must. First off, the bartenders (girls and a few guys) and waitresses won't make you gag.

I've had some good drinks, and I've had ones that were pretty gross, but overall I've been satisfied enough. 

A lot of the surrounding bars/restaurants, such as Nu Sanctuary and Cadillac Ranch have closed down, so Blue Martini has become one of the few options at Town Square these days. As a result, it can get really crowded, and all seating is on a first come, first serve basis.

I hate this five star system. There's just too much nonsense among the staff and absence in detail to justify a positive rating on its own. However, the customers, the energy is so alive and playful that we have to go three. 

How to begin? First off, $10 cover for a bar that's off the main strip, eh...although they did have a good DJ Gilbarba who kept the beat going so well that even the uncoordinated white men were bumping and grinding. 
The lighting, spectacular. The bar set up, artistic. The staff, attractive and in sharp uniforms. 
But maybe the worst service I've ever seen for a club like this. I started off at a high top just removed from the bar, and even though there were hookahs, which should mean servers, no one stopped by to ask if I needed anything. And when I went to the bar to get a drink, the bar top was covered in old drinks and trash. (As were all the high tops and surfaces inside the club. It was as if every one came in, ordered once, and then the servers all went home.) It was so disgusting that eventually I got to a point where I felt no need to use an ashtray...just use the ground, they didn't care, why would anyone else. 
I went to the bar for a drink, the girl looks at me and says, ""one minute"". Did she go serve another customer? NO she went to a group of friend and told jokes and giggled. When the server stopped by to ask me if I needs anything and I said 'water', did they come back? NO. I must have seen 5-6 different servers standing in a sowing circle bullshitting while the entire room looked like the remains of a child's birthday party. Only once did I see who I can ploy assume is the GM make his way about the floor. And even after he pointed out the problems, the room remained a mess. 
The floor plan is interesting. There's an outside and patio area that's kind of nice. A quieter removed section that allows for easier conversation and clean air. But the main room, terrible set up. You can barely see the dance floor from the dance floor. There's huge columns or angles in the way of a clear view. And the best spot for viewing anything good was filled by a DJ who just stands there. I think we need to rethink the layout.
However, having said all that, the mix of persons is a very cool collection from all races ages and personalities. The dress, was a nice comfortable casual dress when you could see sexy outfits along with stylish wardrobes to jeans and sweaters. The kind of acceptance that makes you feel you're always in the right place. 
In closing I almost have to say that this place is great, in spite of itself. 
Although, it was definitely more of a ladies place than for men, at least in regards to the male:female ratio. 

Would I go again? That's the problem..maybe, if I knew there was a reason to. But just to catch the regular party, not likely. More like a 2.5 than a 3, at least as far a nightlife goes. The saddest thing is, that 2.5 could easily be a 4-5. Just needs someone to hammer the nails.",wGCIzYUugIYOds35_Qzagw,1,0,3,LtYt0INUo9NN_eUO-ARuSA

Service - Servers always give you a hard time about splitting tabs. When you can get them to do so, it seems as though it's never correct and they have to re-do it a few times before getting it right. 

Eats - They keep taking things off their menu that are good and not adding new items. 

Drinks - Not as strong. Plus, you used to get enough for 2 drinks with 1 martini (one poured, one more from the shaker). Now you're lucky to get 1 from it. Just don't give me the shaker when it's basically empty.

In fact I took some time to really think about what transpired before leaving this review. Didn't want emotions to overtake my ability to be fair. I was in town for a wedding and I'd heard so much about this place. The first day we tried to go they had not opened yet. We went back a few days later. First the hostess was on the phone when my part of 4 walked in she never looked up to greet us and never made eye contact. She muttered she needed to see our ID and that we could sit anywhere. Already I'm thrown off, do your job and greet people properly. As we were told to sit anywhere we did, found a booth. We were ready to kick back have some drinks, food and hookah. We sat for at least 10min and no one I mean no ever came over to assist. We keep seeing other people receiving service. We are now becoming irritated. The hookah service is provided by an outside company and the hookah girl was the only person to give notice to us. We asked for the manager. Now I don't know who hired this lady but she (manager) was HORRIBLE!! We explained to her how long we had been sitting with no help. Not once did she apologize or even try to make the situation better. She simply told us the waiter was late as in late to work. Remember I explained we were told to sit anywhere. In fact the ""manager"" made it seem like we were wrong for pointing out to her how terrible the service had been. I didn't get her last name but her first name was Lana. The general manager really needs to know just how horrible the customer service is in this establishment. If I could give it no stars I would. After the way we treated and the way Lana spoke to us we were ready to leave.

The Ahi is not as good as PF Changs which I think is the best non-Japanese restaurant Ahi.  I did see a midget and that makes me happy.  Those little upside down bowling pins for legs.  Her big-sized friends lifted her up onto her chair where she was stuck when her friends went to the bathroom.  Little Barbi purse.....I could go on.  They just make me smile.

My guest and I waited 15 minutes for service at a table directly inside from the outdoor bar. After waiting tirelessly, we went to ask the bartender to send a waiter, only to be told the area was closed. I saw two men, one with a low spike hair cut cleaning the adjacent bar multiple times. Why wouldn't they or anyone else tell us we were sitting in a closed area. We are flexible we would have just moved. we ended up having a pleasant waitress ,Stacy, she usually serves us and we love her. Just please focus on more than what's right in front of you.

If you work for a hotel, casino, bar, restaurant u can pick up the industry card which gives u the same 50% prices after 8pm. Signing up is as easy as just showing ur employee ID and waiting a few seconds. Prices are still a little pricey with the discount but you are still saving something. Nicely designed decorations. VIP area with their owe bartender. Balcony area overlooking Town Square.  Very friendly bartenders and hostess. The Blue Martini drink wasn't that bad, a bit to fruity or sweet for me but still good. 007 martini was also ok.

It is off the strip, in Town Square, so you can avoid the tourists (for the most part). Blue Martini is also one of my old stomping grounds... MANY a fun and crazy nights happened here, and I love it even more for this reason!

We sat outside underneath the sprayers, so we could smoke hookah. Oh! Hookah is a new addition since the last time I was there. $30 for the first bowl, and $10 for the refills. The good thing is that they use Starbuzz shisha; Starbuzz is the best brand of shisha to use for hookahs. We had the lemon mint (something breeze), and it was of course, perfect, since i have it at home. We had 2 bowls. between the 3 of us.

Happy hour has also changed; it is now from 4-7, 40% off food/drinks. It used to be 4-8 :( Well, just means you have to drink more in a shorter amount of time! not a problem! Haha.

Blue Martini is often a very popular bar so if you intend on going make sure you get there before 10pm.  Otherwise, be prepared to stand, shoulder to shoulder with other patrons desperate to find a chair or table.

Blue Martini is a great locals bar and while the menu lacks a diverse selection of appetizers or entrees, what is on the menu is typically much better than your average bar food.

But because of reactionary neophytes being hungry and enjoying a basic burger, they weigh in with superlatives like ""AWESOME"".  WOW, SHUCKS BATMAN.  I'm freaken glad for you.  But there's some responsibility in posting stuff.  I will not insult truly top-of-the-kingdom industry people by wagging my tongue over very good fare.  We all, as consumers pay a lot for the opportunity to eat mostly decent food and drink mediocre cocktails, so let's set the bar a little higher, ok?, so that real players can shine and excellence can make it to the forefront.  Nothing whacks me out  more than a waiter or bartender with an attitude. Spare me the peek at the boobs and serve me a great drink with a smile.

Why do I have to preface and preach on my day off?  If the forum was more fair I would write more reviews.  So for most of you, keep it unfair and you'll be spared my diatribes.

Okay, today the business at hand is Blue Martini.  I went there Friday after shopping because Tommy Bahama bores the piss out of me quite frankly, even though I love the place for happy hour.  High praise considering I wouldn't get caught dead in one of his shirts and if you see me in one, please shoot me on sight.  If I accessorize my house with one of his trinkets you have my permission to blow the place up.  They do some good happy hour apps and that basil, grapefruit thing martini always kept my babe pretty riled up.  Even though it takes four or so.

So I took my cousin and her friend along with the babe to TOWN SQUARE.  I like to consider myself very cool, urbane and still get unsolicited offers of sex.  The babe gets whistles and cat calls at funerals.  My cousin, I love her, one of the few in my family that I can say that about, and her friend are really great people.  They fly into Vegas every now and then to see things like POISON, Def Leppard and other fading icons of metal.  They look the part as well.  Meaning they have also faded in upkeep, but take on a more blaringly obvious stand-out-in-the crowd look in places like Vegas, Blue Martini, or standing next to the babe.  One of them is, let's say overweight, the other disheveled, and I say this because people are so worried about that stuff and lose all decency.  As if they shouldn't be allowed to go out.   It's sickening.  One thing to be treated like that in general, a whole other kettle of gefilte fish to get dissed by the staff.

We went to Blue for happy hour, 6 o'clock in the afternoon and my crew, ""the girls"" wanted to be on ""the patio.""  Enough of this outside BS. After a Vegas sun day I'm an air condition gypsy.  I was fed up with a couple of clerks, and people not treating my Cuz, like the Queen I know she is.   She has buckos.  She spends like a drunken sailor in a whorehouse.  It wasn't bad but the first round of drinks was like I had to say thank you for being able to pay the girl.  I didn't order, my cousin's friend did, and it was watching every other patron in the bar get a drink before she could get the girl's attention.  

So the drinks were good.  The babe loves Skinny Margaritas, even though she doesn't need them, the skinny I mean, and the CUZ and friend had some of those ridiculous martinis I will never even try, so who am I to comment.  They looked OK though.  Me, A straight Vodka Mart up, no olive or twist.  Why? It's going to be gone in a minute.  And bar olives are probably the most disgusting things on earth.  Yes, everyone loves them.  Forget it.  I know.  They are vile.  The fungus that grows on them probably keeps the western world from getting rare diseases.  It's vaccine for the masses.

So the next round we gravitated toward a different bartender.  I ordered.  Nice chick named Beth.  Actually, she's a great chick.  The babe immediately said that I have GPS for the babe with the biggest boobs but that's just not true.  Not exactly good for my ego but Beth was sweet to me, offered to run a tab, made a great drink for me, just me, girls weren't ready, and she looked past my shoulder and started a conversation with my babe about make-up and then my cousin about shopping and what the F she bought and how cool and she likes to shop here and there and check out this and that and go to that and here and two hours later my cousin had the best experience of her Vegas ""trips"" meaning she commented how service in Vegas is decent but can be ""cool"" or cold if you don't get my frequent incoherent switching of meanings or ramblings or run on sentences or fragments or just plain annoying everything.

Blue Martini is a pretty good place.  I've been there a few times.  Always had a decent time.  But this chick Beth made my cousin actually talk about it all night like it's the second coming of night clubs.  It's not.  But places would do better here if they made the experience like this one.

There is a lot of seating outdoors and heat lamps too, perfect for the colder Vegas nights. I noticed a dance floor and multiple bars inside. The bathroom was hard to find at first, but a kind employee pointed me in the right direction. 

My martinis were delicious. Of course I had to order a Blue Martini, their namesake. Van Gogh Blue Vodka, Bols Blue Curaçao, Sour, and OJ served on the rocks. If you're a fan of  L.A. Water or an AMF, you'd like the Blue Martini. The Starburst was just amazing! I couldn't get over the fact that this martini tasted exactly like my favorite pink Strawberry Starburst candy! Bacardi Dragonberry Rum, fresh lemons and limes, Cranberry, and Sprite make for the perfect drink. Definitely one of those drinks that will sneak up on you!

Our waitress Jillian was fantastic. She took care of us and kept us laughing! Loved her outgoing personality.

Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere at Blue Martini and my coworkers and I had a great time.

Ok so I wanted to give this place all 5 stars for its cozy feel and wonderful atmosphere but our hostess scratched in hopes of that happening.

Positives:
Great music
Great happy hour menu
Good food


Negatives:
Had to wait 20-30 minutes at a time for the hostess to come get our order.

By the time our order was taking happy hour prices were over even though we arrived a full 2 hours before the cut-off.

Out hostess seemed like she didn't want to wait on us and wasn't friendly at all.


Overall I like this place but hopefully when I go back I will get someone friendlier and someone who is faster in taking food and drink orders.",SS3sFA9ksCT9bjocM3Wbug,4,0,5,aSj1d7k0cjJ3q2KoF6ytrg

    Her boyfriend was charged $500 to hold an area of the bar for our private event which came with appetizers. I thought this was relatively cheap figuring we had our own space and it came with some pretty good appetizers. It came with spinach artichoke dip/chips, chicken skewers, and lobster egg rolls all of that was delicious.
    Also when we were introduced to our waitress Erica she didn't even see happy to being doing our event; she could have cared less and didn't even smile. It was automatic bad vibes she had this resting bitch face the whole time. We decided to open a $200 bar tab with the waitress and we're admant that it was to be $200 and to cut it off. At first she came around maybe two times but she really didn't ask people if they wanted drinks;just came and walked through and walked out. After awhile we saw her less and less and then nothing at all. Several of our guests started to complain, and had to go track her down to order their drinks or went to the bar to buy drinks themselves. We found out she wasn't even tracking our tab due to the fact it went over, $110 over!!! Keeping in mind half way through the event we asked about the tab and she said ""oh you guys should be fine"". She was lucky we were in a good mood bc we had agreed only to a $200 tab and ended up paying $310! Terrible terrible waitress we had to get a manager involved and even then she acted like an even bigger bitch after that but at least she showed up more.
    Now a positive staff review our bus boy I can't remember his name but he looked like the basketball player Stephen Curry. He had an amazing smile and was happy and positive the whole time! He was on top of cleaning our area and keeping the chips stocked. When Erica failed to deliver he was always willing to step up. I gladly tipped him $20 just for being amazing. We loved him he needs a raise!!!
    All in all our waitress sucked but our bus boy was amazing; I'd take him any day over her! The appetizers were really good and we were  conveniently located in the back close to the bathrooms and outside balcony area. It was kind of hot in there though we did notice and the area they gave us wasn't big enough for the amount of guest we had, but it worked. We may consider coming here again, but would be more strict on bar tab and not having a bitch waitress. Oh and they added automatic gratuity on top of her shitty service, knowing she was terrible they should have let us have an option. She earned 20% by not even servicing us and having our guests go to her...pisses me off!

My biggest suggestion would be to buy a bottle and get a table. Most of those drinks are $15 - $20 each and a bottle is $150 - $200.

Go find a casual lounge mood inside with a live band playing danceable tunes (salsa, Earth Wind and Fire) to get all the lovely ladies moving (too bad it's a small floor).  A cabana style area outside awaits others who just want to talk, complete with overhead fans where most of the cougars and older rich men like to go on the prowl.

I didn't dig the velvet ropes though.  VIP service at a bar?  I thought only clubs do that.

It's a few minutes drive down the strip, still further south than the infamous ""Welcome to Las Vegas"" sign (with a fence and parking area built around it now?!  Must've had one too many tourist casualties).  I can't stress enough how much fun I had here two Fridays ago.  Crap, ""stress"" and ""fun"" shouldn't be said in the same sentence.  I heard from a friend's friend who lives in Vegas that this used to be the locals' hotspot, but for what it was worth, March 20th goes down as one memorable evening for me!  But I won't tell because what happens in Vegas...  stays in God's mind forevermore.

The bartenders (Kristy, I'm talking to you) were cool and attentive.  Go to the far back where it's less crowded or get here early because Happy Hours run from 4 PM - 8 PM everyday.  You're looking at half off everything so for example, a Grey Goose and Tonic will cost $5.  Dress is casual as I saw business suits, nurses still in uniform, and plenty of chill people in jeans and sneakers.  

Far from ghettofabulous and nowhere near pretentious, this is a great starting point for a Friday evening.  Real swell until the newest Vegas Happy Hour hot spot hits.  Oops.  Too late.  It probably already did.  No cover when I went around 5.  I didn't get any bouncer attitude either.  Are you sure this is Vegas?",KRLXzow88a6m_ZABejX-Ig,0,0,4,TMA1FZg1uQ-MVtcub1JclQ

It's close to the strip - but far enough to be a local spot.

It's halfway a bar, lounge and well, don't call it a club. Their security acts like it is though. Anyways - don't come here alone lest be prayed upon by your moms and dads friends looking for young blood to hook up with. 

Dont get me wrong, if you're coming with a group - you'll have fun.

Normally I would stay away from places like this... there's too much Affliction clothing and faux hawks for my taste, I found myself here after we arrived to the Gumball 3000, only to find out it had been cancelled. 

Blue Martini, has a weird mix of youngish people and people who are on the cusp of being the, ""old person at the bar"". Walking-in we sat down and were promptly greeted by our server who took our drink order and offered a food menu. We didn't order food, only drinks during our stay. The drinks came quickly and were decently strong. Nothing really mind blowing, but what did semi-explode my mind was the size of this place. 

We sat on the outdoor patio, which by the way is huge and wraps around the entire restaurant. There's also a separate bar for the patio, which is probably why our drinks came out so quick. There's also two other bar stations inside the venue; as well as a dance floor, dining room area towards the back, and what seemed like private room for party rentals. 

There was a little bit of sticker shock when the bill the came, but we did enjoy multiple shots, cocktails, and Hookah.

I advised her I wasn't big on anything too sweet and as long as it had vodka. She recommended the cucumber martini with cucumber vodka instead of the gin and it was delicious.

 A cover band entertained the crowd for most of the evening. In between sets  a DJ played some modern tunes.
 Even after it got busy the waitresses were very friendly and attentive. They cleared our table and made sure we had plenty of water to drink. 
I enjoyed the mixed crowd of people. It didn't have the club feel of creepy people trying to pick up on unsuspecting dancers.

We didn't went with tshirts and flip flops. It is like the other girl's review its a BAR!!!!! in a Mall. Come on! I do not want to sound arrogant but we have a clear fashion sense!

Actually  he received a lot of compliments from the door guys of those places. I think that the Blue Martini staff should modify the strict code or at least give to the door guys some fashion lessons to teach them how to recognize a good outfit from a bad outfit. We were just a nice couple that wanted to have some drinks and have good time in the supposedly local hot spot. Do not ruin the locals reputation with these poor impressions.

My partner had to track her down to find my credit card and her response was, ""I gave it to you in the credit card sleeve."" Which was false. The one employee that helped was MJ, who found my credit card at the front desk. How it ended up there, I have no idea,but the fact remains my card was lost and the waitress never attempted to look for it. I remained calm, asked for the manager. Alyssa, the manager, approached me in a defensive manner and stated: "" she gave you the credit card in the sleeve. She said she did and I believe her."" Then she turned to partner and demanded that she step away since it wasn't her credit card. False again. She is on the credit card as well and my wife. At this point Alyssa had failed to apologize, accused me of lying, and rudely addressed my wife, mother in law and rest of family since we were all sitting at the same table. The experience for the rest of the night was sullied due to Alyssa failing to deliver customer service. Instead of enjoying a night out at Blue Martini I was upset that Alyssa had spoken to my wife the way she did. In the end Alyssa comped my meal but never apologized to my wife and that was the most frustrating part of the night. Two thumbs down Blue Martini. Advice to others keep track of your credit card here because it might end up lost. 
Alissa, at the end I was tired of the situation, it could've been handled a lot better. Also, it was never ok but I remained calm that doesn't mean I was happy with the way you talked to my wife.

Anyways, I could see why my brother and his friends frequent the place.  The venue was spacious and had places to sit around and lounge.  It was cute how my brother's friends felt embarrassed that they were hyping up BM only to find it ""dead"" so they ordered a round of kamikaze shots, which we all liked.

Try a mojito:). Also, another star because it's a beautiful spot with an open back patio perfect for a day time or night time chill out. Large indoor space and outdoor space. 
Another star because the scene is cool, good music and themes based on the nights. Particularly the monday dance off nights (a lot of awesome talent) being super cool and Latino music nights. 
Food: very limited selection with not so good choices. Come full. I've tried the cheese plate which is good and the ahi tuna which is okay. But you can get much better food elsewhere. 
Hookah: quite horrible. So it's really odd how they have their hookah separate from the lounge itself. So no coal monitoring, not even Tongs to fix it yourself. No check ups on it really. And it burns out very quick for the price you pay. 
The music: is way way way too loud. They need to leave it only on the inside and let it just lightly radiate outside. It's a lounge not a club. Kinda makes your head hurt. 
Service is quite sucky too. Trying to get stuff at night when you have a table can take a long while. Day time is much better.

If you talk to them, notice how they have a pause between each statement, comment, or question that they tell you. They are cautiously calculating what to say, because they got missile lock on you. 

Wednesdays is Ladies Night, which is prime cougaring hunting grounds. And then there is Thursdays Latin Night, there is a small drop on the cougar population, but remember, travel in a pack to avoid getting pounced on. 

They provide industry discounts for retail employees on The Strip, or restaurant employees with their health cards. 50% off all drinks and a few dishes. Show the bartender your wristband that you got from the hostess. 

I recommend the PB & J Cocktail from this one guy that works here. He adds a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the peanut butter. Thats probably the most unique drink I remembered seeing on the menu. 

The drivers in the Town Square Parking Lot are terrible. They don't check their mirrors before backing up, or they will do turns that are too sharp that can clip your car, etc. And we are talking about hours right past 10PM.

I generally don't drink martinis, but when I go to the Martini I always have a couple. The tini menu is so extensive that nearly everyone will find something that is to their taste. My favorites to date are the pomegranate and the Blue Martini. The pomegranate is pretty straight forward with the exception of the splash of grapefruit vodka they use. This gives it a bit of a citrusy edge that works well with the sweetness of the pomegranate. The Blue Martini is also a great blend of sweet and tart with OJ and sour mix paired with Blue Curacao and Cointreau.  The Lemon Drop, Cosmo and Three Chocolates are also very good.  
  We've never eaten at The Martini so I can't speak to the quality of their food. This is usual the starting spot for a mini pub crawl around Town Square (we save the eating for Cadillac Ranch or Yardhouse). 
  The Blue Martini is a great meeting spot and an excellent choice for Happy Hour. The ladies need to be sure to get a Blue Martini card, which gets you a free martini on each visit. Some folks may get a bit of sticker shock when they see the martini prices, but rest assured its money well spent. Your drink comes in an oversized shaker that holds the equivalent of two big drinks. As the more popular places in Vegas go, it's a pretty good deal.

I just moved back to Vegas & decided to stay a loyal customer, even after hearing the recent story from dirty dinning. They only had the outside bar open so everyone was hanging out there. Trying to squeeze in to get a drink was annoying. The security was really rude & pushy when trying to clear a path for a bartender holding drinks. My friend was apparently standing where she wasn't suppose to while waiting for an opening to get a drink.. Instead of letting us know nicely that we couldn't stand & order drinks where we were.. we got "" You ladies need to move & wait somewhere else to get drinks."" At that point we just walked out.

Every day from 4PM-8PM you can come here and indulge in some of the best cocktails and martinis! I could almost kick myself for not coming to try this place out a lot sooner! Anytime I've been here in the past it was more on the nightclub scene! If you find yourself in the area you most definitely have to try this place out! I've been here now twice and I can suggest that the crab cakes, crab/shrimp dip, spinach and artichoke dip, teriyaki chicken and bbq flatbreads will not disappoint!

3149464,2008-06-09,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"I always love to try new places, especially when it involves friends and a few libations. I was hesitant to try this place at first because of mixed reviews I had heard, but what the hell, you only live once, right?!  So on the fateful night of my first Blue Martini experience I was surprised to see that there were a slew of door hosts dressed in suits who guarded the front door that were secured with ropes. At first I thought I had mistakenly had gone to a club on the strip and not a restaurant in Town Square, but I guess that's what happens at the latest locals hot spot. 

My party crew and I sat outside and I must say I was very surprised with the vibe and beautiful people that surrounded this place. The majority of the patrons were locals and hot locals at that. Forget ordering food...I could just fill up on the eye candy of men in suits that were sipping on martinis and wine! Speaking of martinis and wine, I was impressed with the selection. Any place that serves Sonoma-Cutrer by the glass is alright in my book. So of course I had to pair the wine with my first appetizer which was the assorted fruit and cheese plate. I could have every different type of cheese everyday for the rest of my life but this one I could do without. I was expecting a expanded variety of cheese like Gruyere or even a Brie but was left disappointed. So to drown/forget my disappointment, I had to indulge in a martini....or two.... when in Rome!! 

When it comes to martinis I like them dirty...I mean like NC-17 rated dirty. The Masterpiece Bleu was great. Ultimat vodka and blue cheese stuffed olives with added olive juice. The blue cheese tasted fresh and martini's size did not disappoint...there was some left over liquid love in a martini shaker on the side! Now I am not the fruity martini drinker but one of my martini comrades had the The Good Life martini and might I say, after taking a sip, it was pretty damn good if you like that kind of sweet fare. Bacardi Melon, sugar free red-bull and cranberry juice...now I know what Kayne West was taking about when he wrote that song...it definitely welcomed me to the good life.  Happy and content with my martini and wanting to make up for the disappointing cheese plate I had, I opted to have the caprese salad. I love caprese salads and try to have them everywhere I go and I must say this is one of the best I have had. The buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes and basil were abundant and fresh but the kicker was the fact that they added portabello mushrooms. Loved it! What I did not love was the lobster taco. Great marinade and veggies but  with one small piece of lobster in a gigantor tortilla. I will make sure to stay away next time with that one.

All in all, Blue Martini is a great locals escape away from the strip. With good drinks, great atmosphere and beautiful people and with happy hour 7 days a week how could you not like this place. Plus, all you Vegas service industry workers and hotel employees, your first drink is on them with their Blue Martini VIP card. With that incentive they will definitely see my face more often!",wL-eQ6ZPYj-kUOh2uPavTw,0,0,4,PVyR0gg1Z-Pb5gzJEIwqyg

It was much bigger than I expected.. I always pass by it but never realized how big it was. There's a nice outdoor area, nice bar areas, and a super crowded dance floor. Although it was crowded, everyone was having sweaty fun!

The only thing I hate... the trance/techno/house music that comes on around closing time. Sorry all you trance techno house music lovers. Just not my preference.

Little side story: the girls and I wanted to hang out some more after dinner and thought to go to McFadden's but after entering there and standing around for 2 minutes, we decided that it wasn't for us. We ended up at Blue Martini instead and enjoyed ourselves more here!

I'm not sure if it's every Saturday night, but there was a live band playing that night and they were super talented and entertaining. We each ordered the Cake Pop Martini and it was yum in a glass. The glass was rimmed with sprinkles and icing and the drink itself was delish...strong but amazing! It was funny because the girls didn't know that the little shaker cup contained more of the drink!! We shared the big fat chocolate cake slice and that too was amaze. 

Between the cake pop martini and the chocolate cake, I would say that it was the best idea for dessert after dinner. Add live music and great vibes and it was complete. 


As far as the crowd and ambience--pretty chill and fun, but there were times that I thought that I was at Stoney's instead! The live band was awesome and when they took breaks, a DJ would play some music to keep the crowd entertained.

They have good selection of appetizers and martinis for their happy hour. 

We tried the following appetizers:

Lobster Salad- delicious! I think I can finish 2 orders of this. There were two big lobster tails, some mangoes and avocado with citrus dressing.

Shrimp and Crab Dip - a must try dish. Shrimp and crab in a mayo-cheese sauce with a hint of spice served with toasts. Really yummy.

Lamb Chops - this was not part of the happy hour. I believe it was about $18. It was mediocre. Not something I'll try again.

Lemon Chicken Skewers - another so so dish. Nothing special. 

Eggplant Caprese - this is another good dish. It came with some tomatoes, mozzarella and olives.

Baked Brie - I love this dish too. It was served with crackers and fruits, drizzled with honey. 

Seared Ahi Tuna Salad- another yummy dish to try. It's a generous portion. 

Margherita Flat Bread - I've tasted something better.

Mushroom Flat Bread - same as Margherita Flat Bread... So so

Beef Tenderloin Medallions - good one.

This place is more where the locals hang out as it is not on the strip.  It tends to be busy here, but I've managed to find a table every time.

We arrived at about 9:30pm to find a couple friendly people sitting at the front desk, which was a nice change. We took a walk through and found that it was mostly empty so there were a lot of open tables available. They had a band playing on the main stage but the music was kind of depressing - we sat down and ordered a drink anyway. I ordered a Grey Goose martini, extra dry with an olive and my wife ordered a Chopin martini with a twist. They arrived at our table about 15 mins later. Both martinis tasted like they contained about 2 oz. of vermouth, 1/2 oz. of vodka and 5 oz. of water. They were served warm and tasted like vermouth flavored water. They were, without a doubt, the worst martinis we have ever tasted! 

After we choked down our martinis, we figured that we would give them one more chance and ordered something easy: Captain Morgan and diet Coke. Our drinks arrived fairly quickly this time but the drinks were served in what appeared to be 4 oz. glasses filled with ice! I have had larger drinks at a strip club! To add insult to injury, the bill arrived and we were charged $17.00 for the GG martini, $18.00 for the Chopin and $10.00 for each Capt'n and diet! The strange part is that I'm sure they listed GG martinis on their menu for $12.00 along with just about every other type of martini. I wonder if those ones had some alcohol in them? When we asked for our check, the waitress quickly dropped it off at the table and ran off, never to return. I guess if I were charging those prices for that drink quality, I would be embarrassed too! Maybe they figure that by 10:00 on a weeknight, anyone still up and drinking is too drunk to realize what is happening! We ended up leaving some cash on the table and walking out.

Fuera del famoso Strip, nos encontramos con estos locales más frecuentados por los locales. Blue Martini se encuentra en una planta alta de Town Square, medio escondido para el que va la primera vez, pero inconfundible una vez que le avisan que de ahí viene la música rockera.

El ambiente es muy amplio, con espacio al aire libre y cerrado. Afuera hay música, adentro un escenario para bandas.

La carta es bastante completa. Las opciones de tragos son amplias y para todos los gustos, con precios bastante razonables, que en su mayoría vienen en coctelera, por lo que en realidad te queda un trago y medio. Para comer se destacan las pizzas individuales, también potentes, y hasta me le animé a un postre (muy rico pero después decidimos seguir con otra ronda y se sintió re colgado).

El ambiente es muy animado, con música y charlas fuertes, pero de todas formas no es imposible comunicarse. Tiene una sección aparte para fumadores.

I will never go to this place ever again.  I arrived 10 minutes later than my party of 8 (mostly attractive women) which was already inside.  

Right from the start the new door-douche (from Florida) was giving me problems with my wardrobe.  Apparently all guests must dress the same to get in.  Although I was dressed for a night out at the clubs, in $600 pants and a custom collared shirt, the door-douche would not let me in. 

Here is the kicker, he flat out said to me ""DO YOU MAYBE HAVE A TRENDY SHIRT? LIKE AN ED HARDY OR AFFLICTION?""

HAHAHAHAHA

He preferred that I pull my entire party out of the place, and leave because I was not wearing a ""TRENDY SHIRT"".  Oh but then they let in 3 guys dressed in shorts, flip flops and Ed Hardy shirts while discussing their dress code with me (which is not posted anywhere).

Thats when I called my party and told em we were leaving.  My party of 8 left, went directly downstairs to YARDHOUSE and had an awesome night free of Douchebaggery.   Then off to 3 other Hot spots like Body English, all of which felt my wardorbe was fine.

I can't decide if I liked the crowd or not. On one hand, I fit in with the douchiness since I was wearing a v-neck linen shirt and true religion jeans. On the other hand, I don't have diamond studs in my ears or barbed wire tattoos around my entire body. And I'm really not into trampy platinum blonde whores with white stilettos, it's just a teeeeeeeny bit too much for me.

On the OTHER OTHER hand, there were some complete biscuits walking around this joint. Some of these girls looked like they stepped out of my dreams and into my reality. Obviously I didn't talk to them, though, because who can do that?

For four people, our bill came out to $170ish for 8 rounds of drinks. I think our waitress left some off on purpose to apologize for the crappy service in the beginning, but it was cheaper than I thought it would be. We smoked a lot of hookah, I highly recommend the watermelon-kiwi and the pina colada. Incredible blends!

All in all, three stars. It's like a club for locals, but still has the douchy flare of a place like Pure on a Saturday night.",-k5yFUChotBMGQgHdFZvLQ,0,1,3,kmuYcQH4PWaWFmhyVJb17g
3304189,2014-04-30,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"I'm not really sure how to classify Blue Martini. Depending on the time you go it can either be a restaurant, club, bar, or even a hookah lounge. Whatever you want to call it Blue has never delivered anything but a mediocre experience for me.

First off the drinks are very overpriced for what you get. Each martini is about $14, at this price point you are approaching what high end night clubs on the strip charge and this place is no Marquee. 

However, what bothers me the most about Blue Martini is their half-assed attempt at being a 'club' at town square. On any weekend you will see a group of the sleaziest bouncers this town has to offer enforcing dress code and holding up the line for no reason. Once they make you pay cover and get in, you come to realize that place is full of people old enough to be your parents trying to dance to some no-name DJ playing songs off his ipod.

While Blue Martini is not a small venue, it is by no means comparable to any of the nightclubs it aspires to emulate. Low ceilings, cramped seating, and a tiny impromptu dance floor created by shoving dining tables and chairs off to the side. Personally, I prefer not to get down in some chain restaurant. 

No matter how you look at it, you can have a better experience for the same price on the Strip. Unless you have a hook up for free drinks or a bottle, avoid this place like the plague.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,2,0,2,bpZerwxjBTc5F47vNG_2cA

Yes, I want a Manhattan!  That's what I am asking for & please give it to me now.  Thank you & please come again & yes, before my cocktail is empty.

I would go back when it might be slower than usual.

First time I went with my boyfriend and another female, we sat on the patio. We had a hell of a time finding chairs, seeing as it was happy hour.

I did a little people watching... it was too early for some people to be drunk, in my opinion, but, then again, it's Vegas... what can you expect? 

Second time I went was with a few lady friends and a couple guys. This time we went inside. We, once again, struggled to find empty seats and when we finally did, we were starving! We desperately looked through the menu, and honestly, none of the food sounded appealing to me, and on top of that, it seemed a bit pricey. I know it's called Blue Martini, and they specialize in those sorts of mixed drinks, but even most other bars have decently priced, simple, ""bar food.""

I ordered Fly me to the moon martini and it was strong and good. The martinis are served in a frosty shaker and you can refill your glass several times. The lemon chicken was good and the service was ok. The place is huge with several bars, the occupancy is 750. The decor is nice. We sat on the large outdoor patio bar that was packed. The music was loud and it gets more loud as time goes by. It is too loud for me as we could not hold any conversation. The best part is local ladies can sign up for a Blue Lady card which will get you a free martini and I believe any night of the week from 4pm to 10pm.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,2,0,3,G7YbWvprCmrOeJZMUz5YSQ

Four girls deep, we rolled in here after seeing how lame McFaddens was (no music? wtf) and were delighted to hear music as soon as we walked in (have your IDs ready). 

We saw that a live band was setting up on-stage then managed to snag a table front and center. Our server came by immediately and asked if we knew what we wanted or needed a few minutes. We opted for the latter. I scanned the place and loved how there was ample seating everywhere and different bars you can sit at. Love big spaces. We had missed Happy Hour by 45 mins and I didn't see Julie K.'s great tip in her review until now! 

We all chose to go with the Cake Pop Martini and split a Big, Fat Chocolate Cake. Our drinks and cake came out quick and efficiently. I loved the sprinkles surrounding the glass.. so photo-worthy! Now, yummy Cake Pop or not, this drink was strong (in my opinion)! I was almost weary to finish the rest in the shaker since I'm not a big drinker, but I still managed to finish it. The cake was moist and delicious.

The Paul Charles Band was playing that night and they definitely did a great job keeping the crowd hyped up. The whole place sang along when they played ""Animal"" by the Neon Trees so this was my favorite part of their performance. Total aww moment when the main vocalist was making his waves through the crowd, but stopped at his girlfriend's table to serenade her. In between their sets, BM had some great music playing that made everyone dance. And if you know me, then you know I love to dance so great music is a must-have.

LOL to the couple that was getting waaaaaay too freaky on the dance floor and flashing me things that I shouldn't have to see in public. But thanks because you kept us laughing the whole night. What is it about BM that had everyone so freaky that night?? 

Our server was fantastic and constantly stopped by our table to see if everything was alright or if we needed more drinks. The only thing that was a bit slow was everyone getting their credit cards back, but it was a packed house so not a big deal.

3564816,2010-01-20,2,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Blue Martini's a fun, local watering hole with some good martinis.

They have a live band playing it seems every night and after the band is done playing, they push the tables aside and you can dance to modern music.

Some tips:  I wouldn't sit very close to the band cause you can barely hear yourself think, let alone be able to have some decent conversations w/your friends.  Sitting outside seems ideal, as you can hear the band and still enjoy the company of your friends fire side.  The bands perform behind a bar.. I have no idea how the bar tenders aren't deaf by now.

Although I've been assured I came on an unusual night and the service is alot better than what i experienced, it was very difficult to flag a waitress down.  If you can't don't bother and just go up to the bar and buy yourself the drink.

Onto the menu:

You have some appetizers including beef tenderloin, seared ahi tuna, lobster tacos, etc.  that are expensive, but I heard good (particularly the lobster tacos)

Martinis:  tons of flavorful concoctions to pick from including key lime pie, smores, red apple, blue martini, mango madness, etc.  I opted for the mango madness which I've been assured doesn't taste strongly of alcohol, which it definitely didn't.  It almost made me wonder if it was just a weak watery drink or was it done so well even I couldn't taste the alcohol.  Prices are up there ranging from $12 - $15 a glass, but you do also get the shaker so it amounts to two martinis for the price one one.  My one martini gave me a decent buzz.  

I'd def come back here again.  Maybe on a night where the band's not playing rock.. maybe something else.",F_WfNGoYHAHDQy2abIYoNg,5,4,4,7QeTg1hd6b6kXEIEI7dGpA

The happy hour special changed from 50% off to 40% off and we all agreed that the fruity specialty drinks we ordered seemed watered down with little to no alcohol.

3590969,2017-03-05,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Blue Martini was recommended to me as a ""locals favorite,"" so I wanted to check it out since I enjoy mingling with people & am still making friends in Vegas that aren't from my job. So far I have been here twice & I have enjoyed each experience. It's not somewhere I want to visit  every weekend but Blue Martini is great for a night out with friends when you want to catch up over drinks & then dance later in the night. 

I came here for a joint bday party last night (Saturday) & didn't have to pay cover since we got in a little before 10. The girls up front were kind enough to keep our birthday presents up front so I didn't have to carry them around all night long (thank you!). We sat at a reserved table for a while until the people showed up & then moved to a back table. We could have sat at a table all night since it wasn't packed. It was fairly busy but I would say for a pay day Saturday... surprisingly chill! On the packed night I went there was no seating though which is hard when you're a female wearing high heels & don't have table. The dj played a mix of songs which were pretty good but we wished he would let the song play a little longer then one line of it. Just as the music got good it would change to the next song. People were dancing as the night went on & it wasn't unintentionally-dry-humping-on-a-stranger packed so that was nice. I will say though that that is not always the case because I came here for Neo-soul Sundays once & around 1 A.M. it was uncomfortably packed. Eventually I'd like to check out one of the Latin nights to see if the vibe is any different. It seems to change with the theme of the night.

They have a professional photographer who will take your photo for $20 if you want a keep sake. My friend got one for my bday buddy & I as a birthday gift & it was really cute. The bartenders & cocktail waitresses are decent. They hire cute male bartenders. I like!

Drinks are pricey at around $16 but since I didn't have to pay cover I'm alright with it. If you're paying cover though they're on the high side considering this joint isn't on the Strip. The dirty martini & mango mojito were delicious. 

The one thing that's not doing it for me with this place is that the crowd is a bit older. I'd actually think that that was cool if it weren't for that fact that the majority of the crowd is 40's +. That's not a bad thing, I guess it's just not going to be my spot. I'm all for a mixed crowd but there wasn't really anyone around my age that I could mingle with. I'm in my mid 20's & I like meeting people around my age .. 30's even. 

Overall I like this place. I'd come here occasionally. :-)",rx6TW2QmrfImGX0dvLyPQg,3,2,4,JmbwTy4zLeWRFemSDmIu0w

On our way down to the Town Square for dinner we wanted a few drinks.  From speaking with fellow yelpers, I seen that there were lots of bars in the area to try.

On our way there the Taxi driver recommended Blue martini and i recalled it from being on the list.  Upon entering we were greeted and mentioned we were there for HH.  The girl told us to come on in and we found a spot to sit.  We sat there for about 5 minutes and nobody had any clue we were there for service.  Hey, No problem.....I jumped up and stood at the bar waiting to ask for a drink. And I waited....And I waited....And I waited...And I waited....Judging from the irritated look on my wife's face, she hadn't had anyone ask her if we had been helped either.  All in All, It was about 10-15 minutes with no help, my wife at the seat, me at the bar.  We couldn't even make eye contact with someone.

Im giving 2 stars because the place looked like it would've been really nice to enjoy a HH at.

Funny, how they post a special too.  SAVE %25 on your whole bill for yelp users by printing the page.  Perhaps I should start going into bars with a I YELP ASSHOLE!!!! T-shirt on.  Perhaps that would motivate a waitress to take your order.",InxaL8hCQrs6XmLtbkcjSA,0,0,2,NeUawLTWjaQ-8LH0z-OyoQ

I just wanted shots but, my foodie friends ordered food because it was happy hour. Of course, I had to get my cheese platter BUT.... TO MY DISMAY, they didn't have baked brie like the last time I was there. I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo disappointed and just got whatever cheese platter they had. I mean, it's cheese....I love cheese; how bad could it be.
Granted, it wasn't bad as there was goat cheese and baby bell cheese with lots and lots of fruits (grapes, berries, melons) but, it wasn't my baked brie that I love so well. Especially that BM made it drizzled with honey. ***I guess I'll just have to make my own***

Friends got the lemon chicken skewers, beef tenderloin, and the seared tuna.
Lemon chicken skewers had orzo, instead of rice as its side. The chicken was as remembered but, the rice was overcooked.
Beef tenderloin was cut thicker than previous so, it was ""different.""
Seared tuna was yum. Seaweed salad on the side was good but, a little slimy.

Out-of-towners visiting Vegas can easily miss out on good bars off the strip since it's so easy to just walk from bar to bar and enjoy the crowds on the street!

I looked over the menu and a couple of items caught my eye, but we ended up just grabbing a couple Bud Lights ($7.00 ea).  

Service was great. We sat outside near some heating lamps, which was awesome since there was a cold wind.  It wasn't until it was almost time to go that we noticed another area (straight ahead when you walk in, rather than to the right, where we were). It was a huge room with two more bars!

- ambiance: nice club/bar feel. kind of loud and dark inside, but it was much better at the outdoor bar
- crowd: pretty mixed
- service: not once server came by our table - maybe not interested in making any money? we had to go to the bar every time to order our drinks
- drinks: i had the cantaloupe martini... maybe i chose the wrong one, but it tasted like crap. all i could taste was the alcohol. i understand that martinis are strong, but this just tasted like orange colored vodka... and not even good vodka

3783148,2018-05-28,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"To wrap up our Memorial Day weekend, me and a couple of my colleagues came here. Upon arrival, the line was incredibly long, which wasn't an issue at all. We were happy to wait because this is one of our favorite spots to go to. I only mention the long line because after patiently waiting for an hour, at least 15 minutes standing at the door, the man working the door tells me I can't come in because I'm a male and my dress shirt has camouflage print. Since this is a venue we frequently recommend to our clients, we're very familiar with their business casual dress code. Even if you call the business, their dress code details mention nothing about this, nor is it posted anywhere at the door or on the website. Furthermore, we were confused as to why we spent 15 minutes at the door, had our IDs checked and were directed to this doorman if my attire didn't abide by the dress code to begin with. Regardless, THAT wasn't even the upsetting part. The door guy then says, ""if you slide me something, I can work something out"". At this point, it's discriminatory; they're picking and choosing which patrons they want to allow in. My camouflage dress shirt didn't prevent us from getting in, it was ONLY because I wasn't willing to tip out the guy at the door. It's extremely unethical, and I'm surprised that's the attitude Blue Martini has about its visitors and fellow industry employees. Even if I paid the guy, that would've left me less money to spend in the actual establishment on drinks, hookah, or whatever else. These door men are practically taking money from the venue's pockets! Furthermore, I'd like them to explain why ""because I'm a male"" my shirt can't have camouflage. Why does the assumption that I have a penis make my attire any more harmful than my female counterparts who easily could've been wearing a similar fabric. This is always the easiest recommendation we can make to our clients looking for entertainment away from The Strip, but we'd be embarrassed to suggest this place to someone who's spent time and money traveling here, follows the rules as they're provided, only to be turned away and insulted by soliciting bribes. This experience was shameful, sexist, unethical, and embarrassing.",HhNIJgTV0LSGMb4pi23lQQ,0,0,1,ABXESxyzJBT9hgZ09fWPYw
3783540,2016-08-17,1,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"So it's a bar with a decent happy hour (4-8) half priced drinks and reduced food costs, and that's about all the positive things this review will have.

Service was not very good. We waited about 25 minutes before even having someone take an order then they missed the appetizer we ordered. In general, it was hard to get service and more than a few times we had to request things like drinks and such multiple times.

Our appetizer, the Caprese salad seemed like someone had heard of it and decide to make one but never actually tried a real Caprese salad. The salad greens were mixed greens, a horrible choice, that was clearly made to reduce costs to make it easier to use those same greens for other salads. The mozzarella wasn't that good and way too little balsamic vinegar.

The food we ordered, lamb and an ahi tuna dish, was not all that impressive either. The lamb we ordered medium rare, we were served a medium well lamb that wasn't seasoned very well along with some pretty basic and simple potatoes and peas. The seared ahi tuna dish, was fine, but that's about all it had going for it. The sauces provided could and should have been much more aggressive in their flavors. Again all this felt like someone had read somewhere how to make these dishes but never actually experienced what they should be.

The drinks were meh. I had a bourbon and coke and it was fine. The Mango Tango was actually a decent drink. The signature Blue Martini was ok if all you care about is a lot of alcohol anything else and just avoid it. It's not a particularly pleasing combination of flavors and I have no idea why it would be the main advertised drink.

I can't recommend this place in any way. It wasn't awful, but really nothing about it was worth even half of what we paid.",1QduxufhUAWaoZ5Nh_a2pg,1,0,2,rqrcu_VQk3yPFXsBply2OA

They could have told us on advance, but they waited until we had already ordered and we're already obligated to pay. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Nothing was communicated effectively, and it ruined the entire mood of our night. When I asked a server, they said that people move the reserved signs all the time, and it wasn't their fault that we had sat at an apparently reserved table. They did NOTHING to inform us in advance of the way they operate, and as a result we assumed we would have the night to celebrate my birthday at the table. Instead, we were told we would effectively be kicked out at 10:00pm. Long story short, I will not be patronizing this place again.

It's in the Townsquare shopping center which I like anyways, so it's super convenient and you don't have to deal with the crazy strip crowd.  It was a friday night though so it was kind of busy.

We both got free drink tickets downstairs from some guy that works there so that was cool...and they let us use them on kettleone martinis so that was another plus.  All of the open tables were marked ""reserved"" which was confusing but then they let us sit there??  Weird but whatever.
We ordered the tuna, chicken and bruschetta and shared everything, but it came out in like 5 minutes, which always makes me feel rushed.  I like to enjoy my nights out with cocktails and friends though so it could have taken longer--not like they wanted us to eat and leave, or maybe they just microwave everything?
So the bill came and I almost died it was so inexpensive I thought it was a mistake!  I asked the waitress and she told me it was Happy Hour and that everything was 50% off, plus our drinks were free:)   Love love love it.
We would have stayed longer but the crowd wasn't that exciting to creep on and I didn't want to have another cocktail when I was driving so we left, but I would totally go back next time I'm out with a gf in Vegas:)",-Indo810b3vfJg6MJV-zkA,0,0,4,lmWhdthSLY4YtXqkrkJjOw

If you like top shelf martinis and want to pay under $10 per drink, the Blue Martini is a MUST VISIT during happy hour. I came here with my girlfriend after work for happy hour and we were VERY pleasantly surprised by the service, by the pricing, and by the drinks. I had three martinis and each one was GREAT. (And rather large for the price.) I like my vodka martinis extremely dirty, and very often bartenders tend to ""under dirty"" my martini even though I order it ""extremely"" dirty. However, the bartender who mixed my martini hit the dirty level spot on. 

For appetizers, we ordered the crab dip plate and the baked brie plate. Both were really good. If you're a fan of seafood, definitely give the crab dip a try. It is a little spicy, but just right. 

My girlfriend ordered an Almond Joy martini, and while I'm not a fan of sweet drinks, I definitely thought that the martini was really good for a dessert drink. 

One of the pluses here is the speed of service. Our waitress was super nice and tended to us just the right amount. She wasn't a helicopter waitress, but she wasn't an absent parent either.

My friend and I went specifically for food on a random night and were asked to pay the $15 cover. Fine...We sit down and wait.....and wait.......annnnnd wait. Even after flagging down a waitress, she tells us someone else will be coming soon to take our order. Still nothing. Everybody who works there acts like they have something better to do for some
reason. We go to leave and ask the host at the front desk to refund our cover charge. The guy tells us no because we have no receipt. Of course we weren't given a receipt for the cash cover. Guy wants to go back & forth about it, but we're still starving, so $30 down the drain takes us right downstairs to Double Helix instead. At least they have good cigars, whiskey & grub with an attentive staff.

They have a hookah service at the outdoor bar. It's 30 Dollars an hour, though, we had it for longer. Also it's ten dollars after that. As for the specialty drinks, I am a huge fan of the BLUE Martini drink. For the ladies, try the Mango Martini.

The dance floor was packed and that's a sign of an awesome dj.

Every drink I had was made exactly the same each time with no issues and never to strong or weak. We used two different bartenders and they were both on the same page.

We received a comped table and comped bottle for Thursday night. When the she came with the bottle she said it was an ""automatic $40 service charge"". I didn't mind paying for it, just wanted a bill for everything I was paying for. She told me that they don't ever give bills for comped tables. I refused to pay. She said she would get me a bill. She comes back almost an hour later with a REPRINTED receipt from a different group. Scammed for a tip once. 

Left our table and went to get a hookah at the outside hookah area and the scams just continued. Our coal burnt out after 15 minutes and I asked for another coal or if she could adjust it. She said that it would be 1 coal per hookah all night. I looked at her and said we both know that's ridiculous. She then said ""if you tip me, I'll fix it"". Ended up tipping her $10 and had to continually ask her for refills and for her to fix the coal. Scammed for a tip twice. 

My sister went to the car to go her sweater because it was cold. Didn't want to stay inside and partake in the Latin Night so we were outside. Not once did the bouncer tell us that he wasn't allowing re-entry as we waited for her by the door. Not once did he tell her that he wasn't allowing re-entry as he flirted with her when she was leaving to the car. But right as she came back he said ""no re-entry.

I do give the place 3 stars for the super cool menu of martini options, their food options are all tasty, service is rather quick, and because they have an outdoor patio area that is nice to hang out in; complete w/ a bar and everything.

I wish they played better music though.  Since they have 2 areas for music, they should switch it up and tailor to everyone's likes.  Not everyone likes house, trance, hipster, and high energy.  Some people like to hear some top 40 and hip hop.  Play some!  The music inside gives me a headache, especially since the big speakers are right on the dancefloor!

I had a martini called the Skinny Bitch, which was decently strong, and sweetened with one of those artificial sweeteners -- Truvia.  I think it was billed as under 150 calories or something.  This was a good thing since I was coming off a buffet brunch and a delicious Japanese meal off the Strip.

The cover was free for ladies (this was a Saturday night), and $10 for guys.  OK.  The line was fairly short -- we waited about 10 minutes.

My last time here was Halloween this year.  I had to pay $20 to get in while my friends only had to pay $10 (ladies got it good).  Regardless, not use to having to pay to get in, but I guess that's Hello Ween for you.  Place was packed as expected inside and out.  Everyone was in costumes and after a couple of drinks, it got a bit old.  

Drinks are fairly cheap considering...far cheaper than a club or a gentleman's club.  I use to come here prior to hitting the strip just because their drinks are cheaper.  One note though, sometimes their drinks are watered down.  Let them know, and they'll take care of it.  Just don't forget to tip.

This makes the overpriced drinks reasonable, $5 to $7 a piece instead of $12 and up. For me, happy hour is the only time to bother with Blue Martini.

It should come as no surprise that Blue Martini gets pretty busy during happy hour. Finding a pair of available seats on a Friday afternoon can be a chore, thankfully on my last visit my girlfriend and I managed to snag the last pair of seats at the bar. We joked a bit about what we assumed the required bra size was for Blue Martini employees as we looked over the extensive drink menu. And then we waited. And waited. And waited a little more. Getting the attention of the bartender took far too long considering we were sitting at the bar. 

After ordering a pair of drinks we decided to get the Shrimp Martini and the Charcuterie Board which, according to the menu was ""an assortment of dried, cured Italian meats and cheeses accompanied by a delightful mix of olives and fresh figs"". Both of these were reduced to $5 each. The shrimp martini was fine, 5 good sized shrimp. The Charcuterie Board was missing the figs, would have been nice if the server either warned us when we ordered or offered a substitute when she brought it out. She also failed to notice we needed silverware and napkins. It certainly seems that workers at Blue Martini are selected for their aesthetics rather then their customer service skills.

The drinks were also on the disappointing side. My friend had the Mango Madness which was made with mango puree (or at least was supposed to per the menu) as well as mango flavored vodka. This should result in a distinct mango taste but sadly, my friend could barely taste the mango. I went with the Fly Me to The Moon which included Cointreau, watermelon pucker and pineapple juice as well as vodka. The flavor was ok, the drink went down easy enough but I didn't feel any sort of buzz from it at all. 

Overall we had a decent time but it could have been a lot better. I would have been highly disappointed if I had paid regular prices for anything we had. If you are at Town Square between 4 and 8, and craving a sugary cocktail Blue Martini is worth a stop but any other time? Not so sure...",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,1,1,3,g9lUYv6yCgACcK5I2gdbLg

This place has a great patio, really good martinis (which are very affordable at happy hour), consistently good servers and usually a good atmosphere.  

I've been to Blue Martini a lot.  It's a great place to start the night because their happy hour really can't be beat.  Most of the food and drinks are half price and although the food is NOT awesome, it is tolerable and BM makes up for the mediocre food with their martinis.  I love a good martini and with a few exceptions, BM has great martinis.

My favorite martinis are the Dirty Bird and Sweet Tea martini.  I still have a lot to try, but I can tell you to avoid the Grape at all costs unless you really like Dimetapp.  As for the food, the flatbread pizzas and bruschetta are passable.  The odd thing about this place is that certain days it's a much older crowd and certain days its a mid-20s, early-30's crowd.  One caveat: I like the front bar and patio area.

The only upside is that their martini menu offers a lot of choices.....
The staff...that's a whole other can of worms. The female bartenders/waitresses wear the typical Vegas uniforms of corsets and tight pants, big hair, and lots of makeup and what comes with that is the typical poor attitude. Friendliness is hit or miss because some are nice, some are not so I guess it depends on the luck of the draw whether you get your orders taken in a timely fashion or if it takes all night. *shrug*....The music depends on the night (the have various specialty nights: Ladies night, Latin night, etc.) and they often host private parties. The do have a decent happy hour which is the best time to actually go there so you don't feel completely jipped by the prices.....about a year or two ago, they started having Hookahs available, but they are overpriced as well...Guess that's all a part of being in a setting away from the swarms of tourists.

It amazes me with the constant inconsistent service you would think that people would be sick of this place, but we aren't. It has been almost a year since I have been here,  I thought that things would be different and nothing has changed. So from my understanding  they have ladies night every Wednesday and they do a give away, but we got no tickets and them when I asked about it the bartender told me it was the customers responsibility to let them know that they need tickets,hmmm really?..How did I even know you were having a give away?..I will not say that I have always had bad service here but really in the last 2 years the service here has been subpar. I dont think their service matters to them. I am in the customer service industry and your customers are pretty much the most important part. My friend and I were not the only ones without tickets.

It's in a semi new shopping plaza with lots of shops, restaurants, bars, and a movie theatre.  Locals come here to party if they don't feel like going to a casino club and fight to get through long lines and parking.  So coming here is a very good alternative.  Mixed crowd and the age range varies.  Their drinks are cheaper than most of the LV nightclubs/bars.  You can also dance, their resident DJ is pretty good, and they have like two main bars.  I like chillin' in their outdoor patio bar, smoking a cig, and pounding on my drinks.  It's very chill and their staff are all nice.  The men's restroom is pretty cool as well.  Instead of a hand dryer or napkins, you get an actual hand washcloth.  After you're through drying your hands, just dump it in the bin.  Very cool.  Price to get in was $10 and the line was about 10 feet long.  Awesome!  I'd come back here again.",Fl0eqZgh85cpeI2E6TDfIg,2,2,3,-781sWyx-G1cmaDyDXAJpg

We had just missed happy hour and the total for a crown and coke and a sweet tea martini came out to 26 bucks! I think that's pretty expensive considering we weren't at some premium nightclub.The service at the tables was basically non existent and I had to have the bf go to the bar to get our drinks.

We ordered a couple of drinks (dirty martini for me, some kind of fruity martini for her) both were very good.  Not the best I've ever had but by no means bad.  But they did have olives stuffed with blue cheese which in my opinion is a crucial ingredient for any dirty martini but surprisingly many bars don't have them.

We were really hungry so we ordered a few things to share.  The beef tenderloin was fantastic.  We also ordered a cheese plate which was good but honestly it didn't seem like there was much thought put into it.  There were a few pieces of cheese and some fruit thrown on the plate but we definitely expected a little more.  The crab cakes were just ok, wouldn't order them again.  We also ordered a Margherita flat bread which was amazing.

The service was great.  Waitress was always on the spot, we didn't wait more than a few seconds before she came to get our order.  She also brought more blue cheese olives for my martini without us even asking which was totally unexpected and a real credit to how great the service was.

Blue also has Latin Nights on Thursdays, I think. Plenty of comfy seating, several different rooms, balcony, stage for live performances, and a dance floor. The dance floor could afford to be bigger, a lot bigger. It tends to get pretty packed.

I've heard good things about Blue Martini from coworkers, but had never made my way over until now. It was Saturday afternoon and the weather was beautiful so obviously day drinking outside was the logical activity. We also needed new shoes from a store at Town Square so this was an obvious choice. 

We arrived around 5 on Saturday and the hostess told us that seating was open. Most of the seating available was at the bar or inside, but we were able to snag one of the few outdoor patio tables available. As soon as we sat down our friendly waitress greeted us and provided waters. She checked in several times while we were there and our waters continued to be filled. 

The drink menu was impressive. They offer plenty of different drinks ranging from martinis to mix drinks to white and red wines. It was one of the lengthier mixed drink menus I've seen lately. 

My Pomerita had more of a sweet taste than a boozy taste. It was light for a summer evening. My husband really enjoyed his Bombs Away.

Finlandia Vodka, Citronge, Blue Curacao, Sour Mix, Orange Juice, served in an oversized Snifter over Ice with a Glow Stick*****

The one thing that was sad is since there was six of us....the table was small and we could not put the circle tables together cuz they were bolted to the floor.  (guess it was for safety reasons-lol)
The servers were cute and barbie doll looking.  (at least ours was pretty hot and she was nice too.)
They finally informed us the VIP had to go to the VIP's now ....it was ok...we were done allready and and even paid our bill allready.
The bill was so reasonable since it was happy hour.  So make sure you take advantage of the happy hour---well worth it. 
Went to the bar to get more shots and we didn't even have to wait long.  The bartenders actually made eye contact and smiled.  
The parking kinda sucked since this was in a mall setting.  Hard when you have high heels on.  Then we saw there was valet but the person I was with did not want to take advantage of that.

Anyway - my friend had her birthday here on ""Latin Night"". We wanted a table in the back, but didn't get one because they said they weren't going to open the bar in the back. So, my friend - pissed by the way - agreed to be sat up toward the front, in much less nice seating. They shoved our 10 person party in space meant for about six and promised us we could have the table next to us as soon as the two cradle robbers at that table left. Right. *rolls eyes* I've been to a lot of clubs/bars in Vegas and I've been around a lot of promoters and I even did a stint of promoting myself. That right there is just crap service. Especially to locals.

Let me also point out the fact that our waitress never came by to fill our drinks. I get it, it's busy, whatever. There was a table full frat-hats next to us, whom she was serving, but come on. You can't even come around once after the first time to refill drinks? I've been in PACKED clubs and I've had my drink refilled by the waitress many, many times during the course of a night.

Sorry, maybe call me spoiled by my desire to actually have bottle service when you're paying for BOTTLE SERVICE. If you're going to offer the option, and people are going to pay for the bottles - then step it up and do it.

Overall - I never have any intentions of returning to BM, unless I'm invited to another birthday party.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,6,3,1,noN-Be1nOfgniz7EhJVlEA

Its off  the strip and considered more of a local hangout, which is cool. 
However you sacrifice a service quality. 

They waitresses were bitchy at best. My friends from Vegas actually had to order from the bar, because she was too busy fixing her hair in the mirror. She took forever to bring back our change (like twenty minutes) and did not even apologize for making us wait. 

The huge plus side is there are about three or four different bars in this joint. So if you dont like your server you can simply move to a different location. 

I liked the dance floor set up with the Go-Go dancers. 
The bathrooms could be in a better place, rather than all the way in the back.

It was my first time in Vegas so for this night I wanted a place off the strip that was still entertaining and with more of an elevated dress code than Freemont street. This fit the bill (thanks to Yelp!) Drinks were good, dj was good. Each of the 3 areas had different music, mostly hip hop, some pop, and even some throwbacks. 

I had to take 1 star away because the dress code said business casual..my boyfriend went with a hat on, not sure if he'd be able to wear it. At the door they informed him there were no hats that night. The security wouldn't let me put it in my purse, so He put it behind their door (we took an Uber there so nowhere to put it). When we got in, we counted 7 guys with hats on, and some with tennis shoes on. Upon asking the security about why he couldn't wear his hat, my boyfriend was told they didn't know why anyone had hats on, and that they must have been let in by management. If this is the case, management needs to enforce dress code across the board, not just for random people. The perception of WHY did not look good. 
All in all a nice place to go off the strip (ladies were free all night), and my friends all enjoyed themselves with the exception of the hat issue.",AXZ97Nc3dvFtLdICtaH8bw,1,0,4,uI9zfowg_HcpvCTXs-yRsw

It took forever for a server to come to our table, when we asked for help a girl ignored us. Then our server came and never told us her name or said hello. Asked us what we want to drink. We needed a menu. She got us one and left. We moved tables after awhile because we got cold. We mentioned this to our server. We told her we instead wanted hookah she said okay and left. She nor the hookah server came. So we tried to get our server's attention but she was more focused on the big group next us instead of all of us..so aftwr awhile I approached her to ask about ordering a hookah , who was going to help us and she got annoyed real quickly and said, "" she'll be over.."" Then I asked who and again she replied ""she'll be over."" So I asked who and she angrily replied and pointed to thin air across the bar to a dark spot of the area, ""HER."" I got fed up with the service I received and asked her why she is being so rude to me. And I walked away back to my table heated. She approached the big groups table all giggly and emty handed asking if they needed anything and then hung out with them and then came to our table and asked if we wanted anything and I said ""the manager please."" She got mad and asked crazily, "" is there anything I can get you?!"" And I said "" Yes. The manager please."" And she replied, "" there's not a manager on the floor right now."" So I told her to ""bring me the highest rank in the place to speak to concerning my service."" She left mad and returned with a fake boss, a party host! Who said he was the manager! I only found that part out from his co-worker..We go on to explain our time there and the server just stayed listening to us, with her head laying on her hand while she leaned on the table smiling at us because she knows she's being sneaky. The boss says that she's beautiful..and he gave us a free hookah..the hookah was disgusting..the smoke was choking us..just all bad..we stayed like less than 10mins after the free hookah and left. Horrible service. I think it had to do with looking broke because we came back looking great and the server began being all smily with us and nice. Do not judge a book by its cover.

We sat at the bar last night and the service at the bar FAR exceeds the service you get when sitting anywhere else outside.  I talked to one of the Bartender's who said he came from Florida and he said the owners are very selective about the market they open up in and how things are designed and ran, this explains why there's only one in this town right now.

What it does not explain is the lack of training given to the young servers they hire to take care of everyone else who is not sitting at the bar.  Every time I have been here and we have not sat at the bar, the service made the experience horrible to the point of why return?

Ladies can get a free VIP card on Wednesday nights which entitles them to a FREE Van Gogh vodka martini or cocktail EVERY TIME THEY COME TO THE BAR. Just show your VIP card and ID at the door and they will give you a coupon. They have 8 million martinis to pick from which are all excellent. The Pomegranate and the Palm Beacher are my favorites. They recently added quite a few new ones too. If you go during happy hour, which 4-8 every day, drinks and food are half price. This puts the martinis at $6-7. If you are lucky enough to score an industry card you get half off all the time. Tons of people have them who are not really in the industry, so figure out a way to get one. You should never have to pay full price here. Note: they don't have Corona. Sad face. 

Lots of times if you're sitting at a table your service will suck, so just go to the bar and order your drink there. The food is pretty good for a bar but I wouldn't advise going there for dinner or make the food the reason you're there. 

The lives bands are good, but I really wish they would just stop all that and only have the DJ. If you sit inside you can't hear what anyone is saying over the loud band music. They usually do covers. I think the DJ usually comes around 11. There is a dance floor but seems like the only people who use it are there for a bachelorette party or else it's old people who somehow stumbled to Town Square from the strip. 

The bathroom is very nice and the attendant is always cool. Parking kind of sucks because you're at Town Square so you can't get a close spot, but there is always valet. Blue has a nice outdoor patio. Bottle service is good if you have a group and we have tons of bday parties here.

We went here last night for a friend's birthday. The place wasn't as packed as the last time I remember. I was surprised to see that there were more girls than guys last night. I'm not sure if that's the norm. I only had one drink - a Caipirinha Martini. I love a good Caipirinha and this martini version tasted pretty good. The live band they had last night was fun to listen to. Their set had a good mix of old and new. I believe they are named after their lead, Gregg Peterson. Unfortunately, after they stopped playing, the music reverted to a generic blend.

Obviously, the drinks here are overpriced. You just come to expect that from Vegas. You'd have to show up before 8pm for their happy hour to get a better deal on drinks. I also noticed the 25% Yelp discount thing before I came, but I completely forgot about it last night.

Tried a few of the appetizers, artichoke dip with chips and lobster tacos. Definitely good eats. The lobster tacos were definitely something I'd have again. I switched to a mojito drink after martinis very good. 

My only problem with the happy hour time was the music was too loud to enjoy the time there. My friend and I had to yell so much and we were right next to each other, and we were outside.

At fist, it seemed like the service would be great. However, as the night went on, it became clear he was more interested in chatting with his coworkers than actually tending the bar.

The service has been spotty as well. One stand-out experience that halted my visits for a long time, occurred on St. Patrick's Day in 2009.

The bartender asks what we would like, and with my comment in my previous review (""Servers have also told me that the 1/2 off price applies to mixed drinks with 1 spirit, though I haven't confirmed this."") I asked the bartender if I could get a Manhattan at happy hour prices.  The bartender looked at me, and I could tell this was going to be a chore.  She said that she wasn't sure; I thought that she meant she didn't know if it would be at happy hour price.  

Nope.  Well, yes, she wasn't sure about the happy hour pricing.  But her first concern was ""What's a Manhattan?""  ... ... ...That's the kind of person who will ask what you think of their personality, and I would respond by patting their head and telling them that they were very pretty.  After staring at her and wondering how she got her job, I explained what a Manhattan was, and told her that I wanted bourbon whiskey.  She then proceeds to another bartender at one of the outdoor bars and has him make the drink for her.  She comes back and tells me that yes, it will be at happy hour pricing, but they had to use Jack to make it discounted.  Well, Jack isn't bourbon.  But hell, at least I finally got a drink.

This place can transform into so many themes and events, whether if its Ladies Night on Wednesdays for half off all drinks for ladies all night. Or it can be Noche Azul on Thursdays for Latin night where the DJ plays genres such as salsa, merengue, bachata, cumbia, or even banda. I have also seen their billboards announcing black tie or little black dress events. The dance floor is not huge, but there's more room outside, although it's not recommended since all the waitresses and people are walking through there. Usually there is different music playing both in side and outside, so you can choose your scene. During the day however it is just like any other restaurant with signature martini's.  

Be aware though, you must be 21 and older to enter, they do check id's.",-gSz76_bKNJsKM2adr12yw,2,2,4,J3d8nMe_-a5dne0J5BE1fw

Location Overview:
This bar/club can be found at Town Square upstairs cross from the AMC movie theater. This place is spacious and a very chill environment. Even when it gets crazy packed, the environment does not get overwhelming. The music variety is great for dancing - not overly loud, can still carry on conversation. 

Customer Service:
The customer service was fantastic. Waitresses were very attentive even when people were coming out of the woodwork. The only complaint I have is the hookah bar, I had to have our waitress and even a manaher check on our hookah about 8-10x before it finally came out. The hookah girl was slacking big time. 

Quality/Quantity:
The quality of the drinks, food and hookah was good. The quantity was lacking though. Even getting here way before it got packed, the bar did not have several different beers and I had to settle for stuff I do not drink.

Side Notes:
Great for large parties, good bar scene with a little club mix.",e6FGtUMpBp18xfZOmpbw8w,0,0,3,IlfU-jitZ2yng2Dw8S7k1w
4798030,2014-08-17,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Went here on a Saturday night and it was packed. There was a $5 cover per person, which is strange since there was no live band. Thankfully there was a 2 person table open on the patio. It took awhile to get the waitress' attention, but once she came over she was sweet. I think the Stella's were a bit overpriced ($8!). The atmosphere was pretty good - loved the outdoor seating and misters. When we wanted a second drink, we could not get her attention for the life of us. My date actually had to go to the bar and order up there since we were tired of waiting. I know that it was busy but she seemed like she only had a few tables and all were in our section. I wasn't crazy about the music and how loud it was. Pretty hungry, but they weren't serving any food (not even snacks or small plates) at 11:30, which I think is odd for Vegas.

Would I return? Maybe if friends invite me, but won't be rushing back. Between the price and trying to get service, and the cover charge for I don't know what, I wasn't impressed.",b1M1M84HFN8_obj_5RBWeA,0,0,2,Xv_moAvnEulk459TGwutpg

4804650,2008-08-07,1,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Wow!  A lot of mixed reviews for this joint.  Let me tip the scale a lil...can we get more stars added just for Blue Martini?  

The restaurant/lounge/bar is huge! They have both an indoor and outdoor bar with the indoor bar set up as a stage for the various bands that play there.  The waitresses are all haawwwwwt and wear bustiers.  Great eye candy for all!  The martinis range from $12 - $14, half off during happy hour. Happy hour is every day from 4:00 - 8:00.

Our mission that night- try one of each.... with 36 martinis on the menu....5 thirsty customers... being that i'm not so great with simple math....ummmm... that appears to be about 7 each!!!  Piece of cake!!!  The only catch is in addition to giving you your martini, the waitress hands you the shaker filled with over another martini glass worth.  How cool is that?  So, on that note, 7 martinis + 7 shakers = 14 each!!!!!  Sweeeeeeeeeeet!!!

I tried all of the following: 

1. Mochaccino: Van Gogh Double Espresso Vodka, Starbuck's Coffee Liquor, Dark Crème de Cocoa and a splash of Cream, garnished with a Rock Candy Stir Stick

2. Cherry Bomb: Three Olives Cherry Vodka, Red Bull Energy Drink and a dash of Grenadine

3. Purple Passion: Finlandia Wild Berry Vodka, Chambord, Sour Mix and 7-Up

4. The Pomegranate: Absolute Ruby Red Vodka, Pama - Pomegranate Liquor, Citronge, splash of Cranberry and Soda

5. Cantaloupe: Idol Vodka, Marie Brizard Watermelon and Orange Juice

6. Mango Madness: Finlandia Mango Vodka, Mango Schnapps, a splash of Pineapple juice

7. Bellini: Ketel One Vodka, Peach Schnapps, House Champagne, and a splash of Orange juice

8. Caramel Swirl: Three Olives Vanilla Vodka, Butterscotch Schnapps, Amarula Cream Liqueur, Caramel Syrup, in a Caramel Swirled Martini Glass

However, they try to be sneaky about selling bottles for $150 and pouring well vodka in it. 

Our table had put in a request that all our bottle be brought to the table sealed and opened there! First bottle service was fine. Second bottle however our server brought over a bottle with no seal so we had to ask for another. Third bottle is where WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS. Our server brings the our third bottle to the table and we noticed it had no top or seal. Then one of our guys tried pouring a drink and there was absolutely nothing in it! Ok so then we called the server back and told her about it and again asked for a sealed bottle to be opened at the table. (She told my bf that it was sealed and she opened it there and that I didn't see her open it!) She then said she'll be right back with another one. (mind you we are sitting right across from the bar) so we watched her go back to the bar and tell the bartender what happened and he pulls out another bottle from under the bar and gives it to her and she walks past our table to the other side of the bar and hands it over to another bartender/bar back. From what we see, she's over there dancing while he's doing something else to our bottle and hen she brings the bottle back with a pourer on it. We all look at each other puzzled and ask her what is that? She replies with ""a pourer""! We ask her to take the bottle back and bring us a sealed bottle please! She finally brought us a sealed bottle and apologized for what happened and then we partied the night away but, we were still uneasy about the whole situation! We had a fun night even though that happened! We still love Blue Martini and that's not going to stop us from going back!

OH YEAHHH!!! 

Seriously, if you're in Vegas and you don't mind being off strip and you love yourself a fun foo foo drink, COME HERE! 

Located in Town Square plaza not too far from the strip, my friends and I came here after deciding we didn't want to deal with the strip and just wanted to be one of the locals. My girlfriend and her boyfriend live in Vegas after all, so we were pretty much half way there. 

HH here is amazinggg!! Half off cocktails, which still puts your cocktails anywhere from $6-7 bucks, but so very worth it! I ordered a different martini every time and loved everything I drank. Tried everything my friends ordered and loved theirs too! You seriously, can't go wrong. I fell in love with Blue Martini. Their drinks are fun, delicious and will definitely have you feeling good. 

Servers aren't attentive as I like, but they weren't too bad. This venue is a pretty decent size. They have 3 bars, 1 which is located outside. You can hookah outside and their patio is a wrap around so it's pretty big. There was a band at the beginning of the night but as it progress they had a DJ. Small dance floor but it still had a very good energy. 

I'm definitely coming back.  I mean, I don't know many other places that make martinis this good. My favorite martini was the Down & Dirty. If you're a dirty martini fan, you're going to love this.

4875739,2018-05-07,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"I've been putting off writing this review as I've been hoping things would change, but unfortunately this location has disappointed me and my girl over and over again. 

After 2 years I finally found myself moving back to Las Vegas and remember having such a great time with excellent service here at Blue Martini a few years back and was excited to make this spot my go-to spot for Happy Hour once again. I've only been back to Vegas for 3 months and have probably been here almost every weekend since being back. Every time I come, I come at opening so I can take full advantage of the Happy Hour. 

The place is NEVER busy during the couple of hours that I'm here, yet the service is super slow and many times I'm just ignored totally. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not a ""single"" guy and I always come with my girl, but on multiple occasions, we sit and have to wait 10 or more minutes for a girl to come around just to bring us our water and to take our first drink order and there may only be a handful of other people there. The girls will stand around the bar and do their talk and adjust their tops and put on makeup/fix their hair. If the place was super busy I could understand having to wait for drinks, but if you have time to stand around, you have time to take care of your customers. 

Except for the last two times we've been here, the girl serving us will be attentive for the first 15-20 minutes and then not even look our way. We've had to call someone else over on several occasions to have her tell our server that we want to order more drinks or food. Several times our server is just talking and has her back toward us the whole evening! 

Another very bad negative in our book is the Hookah girl/serve. The last few times we've been here we've wanted to do Hookah and had all intentions to use the service, but the girl was very rude! First off, since we come first thing when they open up, she doesn't have the hookah menus on the tables yet so she gets around to it fairly quickly, but she always passes over our table and never puts a menu on it! We always have to get a menu from another table and she still doesn't come over and ask if there is anything she can help us with. This last weekend, we were at Blue Martini and the same thing happened, yet this time she made eye contact with me and immediately processed to smile and talk with two guys that were sitting alone!! I'm am beyond belief right now. I can't see how she can treat people like that. The whole 2+ hours we were there, she served 3 tables and all were tables of single people. Two tables of guys and one table of just girls. I don't want to say that she only wanted to cater to ""single"" people, but that is how I took it, especially since she never even came to our table and asked if we wanted anything. Before when I used to live here, the hookah girls would always come around to almost everyone's table and ask if they wanted to do Hookah, but not now. The girl acts very stuck up and has no personality. Would never use the Hookah server at Blue Martini if she was the girl working that department. 

Other then that, the drinks are excellent and strong and are very reasonable if you come during happy hour. The food also is hot, delicious and always comes out quickly. Restrooms are almost always clean and stocked whenever I'm here. The inside is clean and very organized. The patio area could use more fans or something to help keep people cooler in this hot weather. 

This place just needs to work on the people that work here, especially the girls. The customer service here is very lacking. I've been tempted to just leave because of how I and my girl are treated (or the lack of).

4926393,2013-04-01,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Half-priced martini's and a nice collection of small and medium bites for happy hour, which stretches out way past the norm by ending at 7:30pm.  BF and I got here around 7pm on a Thursday night and were rudely greeted by what I can only describe as a tool bag at the entrance asking us to get to the back of the line where we could be carded to come in. Once security deemed us old enough to enter, we walked into the patio area to search for a table or seats at the bar.  It was really nice outside, so this outdoor patio area was hoppin'.  

After spending 10 minutes repeating what we JUST did in the parking lot (wandering around aimlessly for a spot), we gave up and went inside.  Inside the restaurant was rather empty so we grabbed a table easily.  The only problem was that it was FREEZING inside.  I felt like whatever table we were at, cold air was blowing directly on me.  We decided to brave it out.

A nice friendly waitress came over and informed us it was still happy hour, to our extreme pleasant surprise.  He ordered a dirty martini with blue cheese-stuffed olives, and I ordered the Mango Madness.  Both were okay.  Mine was a little sweeter than I'd like, and his just wasn't 100%, but we did end up ordering one more each, so they must not have been that bad.

For food, we ordered the margarita flat bread, the sliced sirloin, fruit and cheese plate, and crab cakes.

Let's start with the bad (because I like people to leave my reviews on a good note).  The crab cakes were super mushy.  The flavor was mediocre at best, but they just completely fell apart when you went to get a piece of it with your fork.  It was really more of a crab mush than a crab CAKE.  The breading was not crispy at all and just didn't add anything to the dish.  It was served with an orangish drizzle that could have been spicy mayo.  I think whatever it was, it was the dish's only saving grace because it had a delicious flavor.

The next bad dish was the fruit and cheese plate.  What a disappointment.  I'm sorry, but when I order a fruit and cheese plate at a place like Blue Martini, I would expect the cheese to NOT include baby bells.  There was a slab of goat cheese in the middle, a few squares of swiss, and two baby bells, along with an array of fruit and crackers.  There was only one strawberry on the plate and it was more green than it was red.  The whole plate, which was very large, was a complete disappointment and we ended up wasting most of it.

Okay, onto the good.  The sliced tenderloin plate was so delicious.  The slices of tenderloin (which is what a filet mignon is cut from) were so tender and juicy.  The dish came with some rice pilaf and a horseradish sauce.  All of the flavors combined were perfectly well-balanced and made a delicious dish.

Last, the margarita pizza was amazing.  So simple and yet so complex.  The crust was just the right amount of crispy.  The tomatoes complimented the light but flavorful cheese just right.  

Our server also brought my BF extra olives for his second martini because she saw me eating them out of his glass.  She was really sweet, friendly and we never had to wait on her so that was a huge plus.  If not for her service, I may have given the martini a sad 2-stars.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,1,0,3,MhR2XErr07__zem72UGsCw

I usually order a cosmo and a desert type drink and after two, I am happily tipsy.  The brie cheese is AMAZING and so is the spinach artichoke dip.  What is super nice is that they give you the shaker and it will refill the glass in full so technically you get 2 drinks for the price of one.

The live music is great but usually starts after happy hour.  I like the dark and sultry environment. Very romantic atmosphere.",wy5hMyNYXMPwiy_gPLbVcw,1,0,4,GZszSMxlsm6EEAEGUx0meg

a.  Location - 4 Star.  being in Town Square has a definite cool factor about it. Although parking is a bit of a walk and signage for this place is poor, if you like TGIF or such places thin BM is fine.

b.  Ambiance - 3 Star - Suburb Chic at it's finest. This is a typical bedroom community bar for younger people overall. Nothing really great, however, it is busy and crowded.

c. Service - 2 Star - For 100+ people, they have two servers?  And they have no system and the free drinks are not free, or sort of but confusing.  Very odd and very unaccommodating.

There is really not much to say about this place.  It is a huge suburban bar and many people drink here. It is something that is generic and replicate in most suburbs. Not bad, not special, it just is.

4937009,2008-10-18,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"I like this place. It's good for us locals here in Las Vegas to have a happy hour and even after hours spot. The food is better than expected considering it's a chain and focused on drinks, but mostly for appetizers to nibble on versus place for dinner. Try the Margharita flatbread. Very tasty. 

A few of the bartenders are really nice. Try to find Christy or Monica if you can. Sweethearts. 

So, what concerns me about this place are the crowds. If you're looking for young and hip, this isn't the place for you. I would say the happy hour crowd is skewing mid-30's and 40's. The last time we went later in the night, the crowd was very ghetto, but apparently they've done something at the door to improve that according to some of the staff. 

If you're looking for a ""locals"" hangout to have some drinks and apps with your friends, this is the place. Bonus: it's in Town Square so you can get your shopping done too.",yuJ6FuGRoXZeLHczBWLUvg,0,0,4,2_la0mvJhQp6mscGfWAoXw
4941220,2013-10-09,1,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"I came here for a Meetup.Com Happy Hour event on 10/6. The host of the event advised me to check in at the front for my Ladies ONLY vip card. When I arrived I was greeted by a brunette at the host station who didn't even bother to say hello let alone give a smile. She stated I had to be a Nevada card holder to get the VIP card. I am not really sure how that makes sense since they have numerous locations around the area but a free drink coupon isn't worth ruining my mood when going to hang with a bunch of people I have never met before.

I attempted to ask if anyone else from meetup had arrived she just stated ""Um well I think someone might be here but you'd have to look around"" . 

Thankfully when I walked on to the patio a group of females spotted the fact that I looked like a deer in headlights and I was able to find where I needed to be. Once the host arrived she took over quite a few tables out on the patio. They allowed us to take up about 4-5 tables and the waitress who was helping us was VERY FRIENDLY and accommodating.

My low review is by no means due to her service. I felt she kept my drinks full and was super friendly. I wish I remembered her name but she was a tiny little pixie Asian female with beautiful long hair. She even recommended I check out golden spike. To be honest she was probably the saving grace for why I gave this place two stars at all.

The drinks were OK nothing special and if it wasn't half off for happy hour I would have stopped at one. I tried the Shrimp MARTINI. DONT BOTHER GETTING THAT. Its only 4 shrimp and not included in the happy hour appetizer special so it was 12$ I basically spent 4.00 per shrimp for a tasteless little tidbit.

Some of the other members of my group got the chicken skewers.

I enjoyed the Down Dirty Martini and the Cucumber Martini but the bus boy took my cup before I got to actually eat my cucumber which also didn't help this place become somewhere I want to return.

The Cake Pop Martini is super cute but the taste is like sweet milk and just wasn't for me.

Overall this place is worth it if you are going with a good group of people and you are prepared for the fact service can be spotty. I can totally see if I had a bad waitress how terribly wrong things could go as they have rules about splitting the tab but our waitress was great about taking cash. They did add on the 20% gratuity automatically since it was such a large group even though they gave separate checks. Personally I felt like that was lame to do without advising us not to mention it shorted the waitress out of larger tip because I was so taken a back by the fact they added it on. Now don't get me wrong I still showed her love for being good at her job but the management of this place needs to get everyone on board to provide good service.

The patio was nice and over all it is a good place to sit out and enjoy the company of people... Check it out but I would not pay a cover for this place.",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,5,1,2,KcPfCDiYbdM7sEbS54gsjA

But when in a place with an alcoholic name, one must order a drink. I ordered the Mango Mojito, and enjoyed it!  It was served in an over-sized snifter; and, surprisingly, I actually finished the whole thing.  From what I remembered, I don't think I tasted any mint (hence, MOJITO).

The location is great, if your a local it's a great place to go out off strip.  Also wonderful for some happy hour shopping (dangerous!).  The place is pretty big and extends far out to the back.  The have an outside patio area which is great on those cool nights.  They have a stage which has live music on the weekends (Not sure about during the week).  

Drinks:  AWESOME DRINKS!  I love their selection, it makes me want to try everything.  My favorite is the Bazillion, lychee and melon.  For you non vegans, they have candy bar drinks which look good, but more like a milkshake for my taste.  The price isn't too bad, especially if you end up here during happy hour.

There are not too many things more annoying when your ordering a specialty drink, than dealing with an uneducated bartender that can't answer a single question you ask.

I was there a few Saturdays ago around 11 pm and got in line, which wasn't too long.  But I was surprised with the cover charge they now imposed!  Sure, I was free (either b/c I'm a local and/or b/c I'm a girl), but the Husband was charged half off b/c he is a local...which meant he still had to pay $10.  Now, this is where I felt really bad because I had referred some out-of-town people here and I would have felt like crap knowing they paid a $20 cover charge to get in! 

It was still busy in there, but definitely not as packed as before.  They are getting cheap on the drinks though.  My Mango Madness ($14) shaker used to fill the martini glass two rounds, but this time it just filled the one.  Bummer.  And the Husband's Jack and Coke costs $8, and there wasn't much in there.

My friend and I walked in, and I showed the lady at the front my VIP card, and in we went... we walked in, and the place was PACKED. It's ladies night, what do we expect right? Well, we found a table right in the middle of the place and settled in.  We had to sit at two chairs right at the end of the table just so that we could hear over the band.  It was so loud we were yelling into each others ears!

We then proceeded to sit at said table for 15-20 minutes without even being acknowledged.  There were three different servers working this particular section, and not once did any of them stop at our table.  My friend proceeded to get up and go find a manager.  She was escorted back to the table, and told ""sorry, I'll find someone"" and never came back.  10 minutes later we were greeted by a server that not only informed us that her ""friends"" were on break, but that tonight was her very first night working there.  Let the eye rolling begin.

We checked in on Facebook, where it indicated that were entitled to a free martini.  Our server of course had no idea what we were talking about, and told us to go all the way back out the front to ask the girl at the hostess stand.  We went one at a time to get our tickets for fear of loosing our table.  

We both ordered the ""blue"" martinis, and my friend ordered the pepper chicken.  The food was excellent.  The drinks were brought out rather quickly, and the night started to pick up.

After a while, as my friend was starting to not hold her liquor so well, I asked for the check. With our free drinks, we were only having to pay for food.  Well, the bill came, and the ""ladies night"" 50% off was no where to be found.  I asked another server who happened to walk by about it, and she apologized, and said she would take care of it.  After a few minutes, another server came back with the check, and very rudely told me that food is not 50% off, only drinks.  I advised I have been to this bar numerous times, and we always get 50% off of the entire bill. She basically proceeded to call me a liar, and walked away.  I tried to ask if maybe they changed their policy, and she didn't even hear me.

After I paid the $21 for 4 pieces of chicken and a chocolate cake, I grabbed my friend and went next door to Ranch House instead....",64WaWNeYSmN45a1MdiFv5w,3,1,4,KjBbPwxcPRb9TNtH3hPmJQ

They have a big variety of different martini's to choose from and they serve your martini with the shaker so you can fill your glass another time.  Our server was very nice and attentive and they are all good looking too.. 

Hint---check into yelp and you may also see a 25% off discount for your tab too or check into 4square and you can get a free drink ticket....Just show the hostess and she will give you a complimentary cocktail pass...which is good for a drink...saves you a good $10-15, because that's the average price of 1 martini.

I went there with 2 others and we had the mango, almond joy, pomegranate, caramel apple, and peach martini and they were all delicious!!! If you have a sweet tooth, definitely go for the almond joy martini, the glass is rimmed with coconut flakes...

I have a lady VIP card and an industry card which entitles you to a free drink and happy hour all the time aside from their normal happy hour times which is from 4-8 pm. So if you're a girl, you must sign up for this incentive! 

The food isn't too bad especially at happy hour prices, but I don't think I'd pay for it at normal price. I really really enjoy their lobster salad! It's very light and refreshing yet full of flavor. It has sliced avocados, mango, baby cherry tomatoes, mixed spring, romaine, and iceberg lettuce, and two pieces of lobster. To. Die. For! I also like their spinach and artichoke dip, both of their flatbread choices (margherita & beef tenderloin portobello), beef tenderloin dish, and chicken skewers. 

I ordered the baked Brie thinking it would be fantastic. The bread is pretty good, but the cheese for it tasted much too strong. It was brought out with the rest of my appetizers and I was meaning to eat it last which I did, but at that point the cheese seemed like it had hardened so it wasn't that good. The fruit on the plate also was not fresh and made me want to spit it out. 

The service is hit or miss depending on the girl's attitude that is serving you that night. Most of them are pretty happy, but there have been instances where my waitress was very unpleasant. 

The bands that play are fun most of the time, but I don't generally think of this place as somewhere to go to and dance. It naturally isn't meant for the younger crowd. As some of my friends call it, it is ""cougar town""! Haha so watch out younger fellas. Most people that come here come after a long day's work to get a drink with their business peers and whatnot. It can get really loud in here too so it's hard to talk and socialize unless you're sitting outside, which can be a pain to find seating some nights. It can get very crowded!

With this happy hour, it starts at 8pm (and ends at midnight) and includes half off of all drinks and food.  There's an booth at the front that will give you a wristband if you're part of the Vegas casino and entertainment industry.  

I do like the venue.  There's outdoor and indoor space and lots of it.  Although I've been indoors, the Monday night festivities were outdoor only because they were rennovating the inside.  I like the outdoor space.  Lots of bar space, high chairs and high top tables all around.  Fit pits and a balcony overlooking the middle courtyard of Townsquare and other restaurants close by.  

For my drinks, I got the typical vodka soda with a lime.  Just your typical drink, although I know they have great martinis.  What I really want to review is the lobster salad.  OH-EM-GEE, it is soo good.  Two whole chunks of Maine Lobster accompanied by baby greens, crunchy romaine lettuce, mango, avocado, tomato, tossed with a lemon/orange vinaigrette.  Everything was super fresh and crisp.  The lobster meat was cooked perfectly and really made the salad the star of my night!!  This salad is about $20 but with the half off price, it's perfect!

You'll definitely have to try the lobster salad and drinks.  It's a light meal that is packed with flavor and delightful textures.  If you work in the industry, come check out Manic Mondays and get the salad.  You will love it!!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,2,2,4,qU9G6kHUZTsD0EIS6IRsgQ

(I know it sounds like a James Bond character, but he's really Mr. W.) He had seen live music at Blue Martini before, and we are generally up for whatever, so the caravan took sail for Town Square.

Pulling into the Town Square parking lot I was shocked to find what seemed like thousands of cars. I had no idea that the nightlife was so well attended at this south Las Vegas Blvd shopping center. The triple punch of Martini, Yardhouse and Cadillac Ranch generates a large crowd. 

Alas, we did not find live music at the Martini, as after midnight, there is no longer a band, just a DJ pumping hip-hop tracks. I was shocked once again to find such a motley crew of people inside Blue Martini. From a transvestite to an international banker to some left over disco-themed patrons (there had been a live disco band earlier), there were all shapes and sizes getting their collective groove on. This is a good thing to me, but the truly happening Thunderdome vibe was seriously undercut by the ""chic"" Applebee's interior and the impromptu, mini dance floor. I am just opposed to dancing in a restaurant, especially a chain restaurant, where the dance floor is created by pushing the tables into a corner.

The cocktail selection was obviously a wide selection of creative martinis. I realize it is called the Blue Martini, but I appreciate a bit more brain power behind my cocktails because I am very indecisive when it is time to place my order. I am tired of bartenders ""surprising"" me with Seabreezes and other fancy fruit punch concoctions. Fruit punch is not too surprising. I guess I will have to go back to my standard tequila neat.

As for Blue Martini, it just failed to deliver an experience I would want to repeat: notable people watching, but in a stale environment. The search will continue for live music.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,10,2,omYNcDVoROV6AiLwL5XrWA

Well I had the pleasure of attending a Latin night on Thursdays. This place was so packed, like over capacity. The crowd is definitely over 25+. The drinks, as always, are ridiculously over priced as expected- Take shots, you're better off. But at least the music is good- Salsa, Reggaton, Bachata, Rock en Espanol, you name it- they got it- Latin style :D The only bummer is that their dance floor is TEENY-TINY! How are you supposed to get down Latin style with no room to spin around? No bueno. 

They even have a live band- which is OK- I think they switch up the band every so often because I went once before and the band was awesome, so I guess it just depends. LADIES ARE FREE, and I believe it's $10 for local guys, $20 for other. 

For their specialty drinks, you will spend around $9-$16, for shots I believe around $7-$12... I not a huge martini drinker but I always get the Raspberry Bikini Martini- Its OK :) 

Overall, I think this place is an OK spot to hang out. I would rather much dance at a place with a larger dance floor but you gotta love the crowd and lovely people :b",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,1,1,3,_e7V0I7fzvLD17N36PLlwQ

1. Located in Town Square (Las Vegas Blvd. South), if the place is packed, there are lots of close by attractions, bars, and other shenanigans to get into.
2. This place gets packed on the weekends and ladies night (which is Wednesday). What's great about Wednesdays is that ladies cocktails are 50% off.
3. The patio is the best seating area.
4. There are a lot of great martinis, but some epic failures. (Avoid the Key Lime Pie Martini at all cost!)
5. There are various age groups here.
6. The dress here is very club attire.
7. The inside is packed, the tables are first come first serve and people pounce on tables as soon as all seats are vacant.
8. It is hard to walk through this place without spilling half of your cocktail!
9. It's VERY loud.
10. When Blue Martini is slow, it's a really cool spot.
11. If you work in the hospitality industry, you can get an industry card and your bill is 50% off all the time.
12. This is a great place to find a piece of booty for the night.
13. The bartenders do make strong beverages and if there are extras in your martini shaker, they give it to you.
14. Some nights, there are hookahs available to rent. Lots of yummy flavors to choose from.
15. They do have yummy food, but the pickings are slim and the price tag is a little too high.

One birthday, I thought it would be a great idea to try half of their martinis in one night. The signature blue martini is delicious, if you like an AMF, you would love this drink. Most of their martinis are just variations of mixed drinks. The only one that I would suggest avoiding is the Almond Joy because the coconut irritated my throat. 

The food here is nothing special. If you can hold out, go to Yardhouse for dinner and beer at their happy hour. Remember, beer before liquor never been sicker. Liquor before beer, you're in the clear.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,3,2,-a8q6Yqc1kRQiUGfdZQDKg

First they change their food menu. Service used to be slow, It's only gotten slower... the place was pretty empty and a took a while just to get noticed. Another table that was there before us, got waited on after us. Their martini's aren't as good as they use to be either.
I think they stopped trying. I have only been going here recently because my friend loves cheap eats and happy hour pricing, She likes everything, I've never heard her complain about any place she's ever been.
I like the free Martini with movie ticket deal and the Lady's Blue Martini card, drinking for free is never a bad thing. The food is average.

My first impression was that it was a really nicely decorated meat market. We couldn't find a table outside so we retreated to the indoor area. The decor is very lively and, after a drink or two becomes quite enchanting. I let the company do the ordering and since it was happy hour they ordered food as well as drinks. The dirty martini I had inspired me to make it my new favorite drink. I order it everywhere I go now. Yummy salty heaven! We had some smoked salmon quesadillas that were small but delish. The other appetizers weren't memorable, but I didn't dislike any of it. After 4 of us had 2 drinks each and shared 3 appetizers our bill was still under $50. Gotta love happy hour prices!!!

The fruit and cheese platter, Brie bake, artichoke and spinach dip, crab and shrimp dip, Margherita pizza, and Thai chicken have all been tried on different occasions and they are all really good! My favorite drink is the Sangria Fusion, yet the Mojitos and Martinis are outstanding, and the wine list is also very good.

Sometimes its hard to get a place to sit on busy nights, but there are plenty of places to talk and take a break from the dance floor. I love the DJ and live performers on Sundays.

One con: I called a few days in advance to ask about cover charge for Sunday nights for women (I had friends visiting from out of town and I was trying to get and idea of how much they should bring for cover for all of the places), and I was told is would be free before 10pm and $5 for all ladies (locals or not) after 10pm.

Ladies night is Wednesday night with half priced apps and martinis on the menu. Their food is actually quite good for a bar and their drinks are even better.

Once we get to the front we stand there for another 5-7 mins and then the doorman told us that our guy friend could not get in because he was wearing camouflage print. He began to state that women can wear whatever they want but men can not. We asked if there was anything anywhere stated about the dress code because we tend to recommend this place to a lot of our guest that stay at our resort. He said it's corporate that has these dress codes in place. So still confused and embarrassed we begin to get out of line he whispered to us that if we slide him something he will talk to management and let us in. At that point we are all offended because is that the dress code or not because I can give you money on the low to get in and then on top of that still pay $40 just to get in. So how is that ok to tip the doorman so he can speak to the manager to allow my friend in. Had we had ""slid him something"" would we have been kicked out once security or a manager spotted my friend in his camouflage and have to leave?!

We got a hookah for the table and the hookah girl was around every ten minutes, which is really sad that she was so attentive and we couldn't order a drink to save our life. 

We had bussers (?) come around trying to take plates and glasses...and trying to grab them when we weren't anywhere near done. 

Oh and the bar lost my credit card twice, I had to go find the actual bartender I handed it to and ask for it back. 

So I give a good rating for the food and drinks, but the service was Horrendous. Awful.

Located way off the strip in a  beautiful, new shopping center with tons of cutesy shops - The Blue Martini is located on the second floor of a clothing boutique.

Ultra chic, classy dimmed lighting, neon lit up bars, engaging lounge areas, classy pub tables and chairs providing plenty of seating, the lounge is extremely spacious with enough room to get your dance on ( which many were) they have 2 or three bars in the club, one main bar that's all neon lit up that has a stage set up right in the back for preformances and the particular band playing this night was extremely fun and certainly livened up the evening.

Oh and the Martini list?...Out of this world fantastic with just about every decadent concoction of flavorful drink's you can think of- all with a special Blue Martini touch!!

This evening I was a little stuffed from my previous meal so, I was unable to try all the Martinis I would have love too have though, I was fortunate to indulge in a few that were incredible.My first drink was the Blue Martini drink which is Van Gogh Blue Vodka, Citronge, Blue Curacao, Sour Mix, Orange Juice, served in an Oversized Snifter over Ice with a Glow Stick. This drink was strong though super delicious!!!! My second drink of the evening was The Skinny Bitch which was something I needed especially after feeling so stuffed the drink is Van Gogh Vodka, Tropicana 50 Blueberry/Pomegranate Juice, and Blueberry Purée which is only Under 25 Calories and tasted fantab and never would have though it was so low in calories.

I had a really fun time here this evening especially with all the people watching of everyone dancing and having fun especially watching those who should not be dancing...lol

Drinks are pricey at about $12.00 to $14.00 a drink though I heard they have a good happy hour with drinks at $7.000 half off on appetizers.

Talk about a sausage fest!  I was hit on by at least a dozen butt-faced boneheads in the 45 minutes I was able to stomach this place.  Butt-faced in this case refers to both the people and their condition.

If you're into (to borrow from a previous reviewer) douchebags and doubaggery, then you've hit the motherload!  

There were more goofballs there with fake tans, coked-out eyes, highlighted faux-hawks and Ben Sherman ""Vegas-shirts"" than at a Jersey bachelor party!

5672693,2016-02-24,1,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"I hate to give this place 2 stars because its a solid establishment but unfortunately there were too many hiccups to warrant anything more.

First off the good. The ambiance is lovely. On any day other than Sunday its a good date night place. Dimly let and cozy. I went on a Sunday for Neo Soul happy hour. The ambiance was more of a club atmosphere. But, still a good time. Drinks are a bit pricey but well worth it. I had a dreamciscle martini and OMG. Delicious!

There were a few issues with the evening but for the sake of brevity I will only detail the biggest 2. Everything revolves around the fact that this place was understaffed and unorganized. First off, there was a drunk guy passed out at the bar on the patio. Now there's drunk and then there's where are your friends because you may need medical attention. This guy had his head on the bar with both arms were handing to his side. He was clearly gone. I simply couldn't believe that no one saw this. Not the bartender feet in front of him or any of the staff members zooming and zipping past him. I notified my waitress who was also oblivious to the fact. She notified what appeared to be a door guy. After about 10 minutes of yelling in this guys ear and shaking him to death with no response he gets another door guy to help him lift he guy out of the chair. The guy was NOT coherent and could not lift his head let alone stand or walk. They each grabbed an arm and drug him out to the stairs leading to the nearby movie theater. 

Now, in no way did I expect the staff to babysit this guy. What I also didn't expect was for them to throw him out and make him someone elses problem. The police should have been contacted to keep this guy off the street. Suppose he tried to drive and killed himself or someone else? As a business, Blue Martini failed and what they did was unethical and probably unlawful. Not to mention that no one in the establishment noticed him until I notified them. Also, what bartender was serving this guy? In TX we have this little thing called Dram Shop laws. Obviously that is not a thing in NV and its a shame.

Lastly, the staff at this place were inattentive and hurried. Whatever we ordered was dropped off and they quickly rushed away before we could ask for anything. So we were left with food but no utensils and hooka but no tips. My waitress also forgot that I gave her cash for my drink and accused me of not paying for it. We also made table reservations weeks before we arrived and 3 people came to out table throughout the night claiming there was no reservation.

It was just one thing after another with this place. A series of unfortunate events.",kmj270hrsCYeS3MA03J6VQ,4,0,2,iHN7W3XVQ7qBEP6RwudAqA
5675521,2013-06-19,1,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Blue Martini has really come a long way since they opened years back.  My friends and I used to LOVE going there for happy hour on Sundays (happy hour is from 4-8 and has half priced drinks and some food).

I love the set-up.  The huge patio outside makes you feel as if you are not in Las Vegas, and the ceiling fans keep it surprisingly cool.

There is plenty of seating and you are not forced to make a reservation or buy a bottle just to sit down.

The crowd is a good mix of people. Youngin's, grown and sexy, 50+.  There is a little bit of everything here!  The DJ is usually good, playing a mix of top 40 and hip hop, with some old school jams thrown in there.

I had some friends in town and we were looking for a more relaxed place to go, where we knew we could sit down, and this was the perfect place.

We swooped in on a table when another group left and immediately got some drinks and a hookah.  Now, I am a beer drinker, so I just can't justify paying $14 for a fruity martini.....but oh well.  ""When in Rome!"" The prices are just a bit outrageous, in my opinion.  And our server was VERY slow.  It took at least 20 minutes to get change when I paid, and I had to ask for it.  The hookah was a great part of the night, although I don't smoke.

Blue Martini served it's purpose - we had a nice, chill evening with a few cocktails and some bumpin music.  I just don't like having to pay a cover ($5-$10) for a local place and then pay $14 per cocktail, otherwise I may frequent this place more often.

Arrived around 915p for a pre Birthday celebration for my honey. 
FREE BEFORE 10P

 Live cover band was amazing. When we got there the band would play then the DJ would Spin... (alternating) place was packed but not to where you COULDN'T MOOOVVE! 3 different bars. I didn't experience the other bars, but we stayed in the middle bar area with the dance floor. 

GREAT crowd: ages ranging from 23-55ish, but you know blk don't crack so faces were looking young. Lol. Girls night out... fellas night out.. couples were left & right, so mini date night/evening outing is great too. 

Dress code ranges from casual to LBD and dark jeans/slacks and a sweater however you pair it fellas, either way a thumbs up. Better to come over dressed than under dress kind of thing...

Music was hip hop & R&B. 

Didn't get a chance to eat, but we had 3 apple Martinis that came up to about $50 and some change. That's after happy hour. 

Other than that, this place is a must EVERY SUNDAY when I get a chance to come to LV and here on Sunday instead of leaving on Sunday!!",qdmBiB01F-ABbG2ShAG7Ow,2,0,5,suQXMkKoL2OCz4hypM4GfA

5765757,2017-01-16,2,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Positively the best Happy Hour in Las Vegas and one of the best I know of.  It runs every day, even weekends, from 4pm to 7pm.  Apparently they just changed it from 8pm to ending at 7pm on a Sunday, as there were some upset customers who came in around 7:30 expecting 50% off martini drinks and food.  

The quality is excellent, I ordered the Maine Lobster Salad for $8 and the beef tenderloin sliders, 3 for $9.  They have about 20+ items on the menu, all at half price for Happy Hour which is an amazing deal and well worth the visit.  The salad was fresh and the lobster cooked very good although a little too salty for my taste. It had a good variety, with avocado, mango, tomatoes, and lettuce.  Plus it was a regular sized salad portion.  The sliders too were really good and a fantastic value at $9.  They were tender and filling.  Drinks and their specialty martinis are also all half off which is an amazing deal. Would order again although there is a lot more on the menu I'm interested in trying.

Parking can be a little difficult, and finding the place if you're not familiar with the town center shopping center can be a little confusing.  It's on the 2nd floor by the AMC Theater.  Or look for the Coffebean and the stairs is directly across the street, listen for the music.  Highly worth a visit especially Happy Hour.",o5PjjS1IxZ8rvBKSFZeM7Q,6,2,5,diJQzLxQHnvbvfyO2F6Ntg

5778821,2014-12-22,3,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Review is for Blue Martini as an event space only. I had a really great experience booking a last minute holiday party for 43 people under $2100 (including food, booze, tax & 20% autograt).

 My boss decided to have a department party about a week earlier and after scrambling to find a place with availability that was also reasonably priced, I thought of Blue Martini. The biggest deciding factor was that they let large groups to do happy hour drinks (50% off everything) which runs every day till 8pm. They also allowed us to use our own printed drink tickets to limit people to 2 each, and my boss was happy they were really strict about collecting tickets when they took drink orders. They had 2 other groups booked inside, so we ended up on the patio, which worked out fine even on a 50 degree night. Hooray for heat lamps. 

Lana the event manager was great about sending me info and answering questions via email, and she was also on site to address any issues during the event. I had to ask for additional tables, and had questions on whether food was being replenished - Lana was always available and super helpful. 

I'll admit I had kind of low expectations for the food, but the prime rib was surprisingly good - the price was reasonable at $325/50 people (+$50 set up fee), potatoes were $125 and their portions were generous. I would probably pass on the caprese salad because the cheese wasn't very good, but we only went with 1 order (feeds 22ppl) it was a larger portion than expected. People less food snobby than I am thought it was fine. 1 order of the Spinach artichoke dip ($85) was also a bigger serving than expected - a half pan filled about halfway and a big bowl of chips. We got 3 orders of the assorted flatbread ($50 each), which seemed like kind of a smaller portion for 22ppl each, but still decently priced and everybody loves flatbread.  

A few negatives - 1 cocktail server for that many people doesn't make sense and bartenders are still as slow as they were years ago. Plastic plates are ok I guess, but you try cutting prime rib with plastic cutlery. They were pretty bad about clearing dirty plates and glasses from their tiny cocktail tables, I often ended up bussing tables myself. The live music actually brought the energy down - it's not a fun band anymore, just 1 guy playing the worst loungey/jazzy version ever of Megan Trainor's All About Bass. 

Those are minor things and everybody had a good time, which is all that matters. My boss liked it so much that he's talking about having another event in a few months. We all had a lot of fun times at Blue Martini (maybe 6 or 7 yrs ago?), and although this was a great party, I'm not really motivated to start hanging out here again - it's definitely more of an older crowd now, so just not my scene.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,5,4,4,d1xkP0tkJoD6WQTnbkgmWg

Their dance floor is little to non-existent, but I couldn't help dancing at our table to latin beats. Latin Nights seem to generate the crowds, and I have to admit their music is pretty good and upbeat. There was a live band, in which of course they themselves were mediocre and nothing entirely special (mainly did covers of top 40 songs). The food was a little bland; we ordered the spinach artichoke dip, chicken, beef, and rice plates, and they lacked considerable flavor to them.

The crowd (although fun to people watch) is wearing on me. I only ever see cougars lurking around in the dark or pervy old businessmen trying to hit on the hotties. BM used to give you a nice helping of the drink you ordered. They would fill your glass up when serving you and then leave enough in the cocktail shaker for another full glass. That made it worth paying $12/drink but now you barely get any leftovers. The food is cheesy and expensive. Everything tastes pre-packed and/or frozen. The only app I enjoy there is the fruit platter (at least I know the fruit has to be fresh). 

Another gripe- I have to sit outside now because the music is SO loud inside that I can't even have a decent convo with my buddies. Oh and $30 for a hookah that barely smokes for 20-30 minutes....honey please. The worst part? They took my favorite drink off of the menu, the s'mores martini :( BOO!

The only thing that keeps me coming back is my industry card (I get 50% off all drink and apps) and my lady card (which gives me 1 drink for free before 9am). I can use both together so I can usually drink on the cheap. If I am looking for a place to take an out-of-town guest (and I don't feel like hitting up the strip) then we'll normally end up here.

Especially the fruit and cheese appetizer. However the second time I went (but it was earlier rather than later on)... the waitress was a bit annoying. I showed her my ID (because she didn't believe I was over 21) and she was staring at it as if it were fake and was going nuts looking to see the authenticity of my ID when the hologram of it being real was easy to see. She also took a while to give us the credit card back when we paid.

But I will say despite the second experience... I do like the place.

The band is amazing as well. At least the one that was there when I went. I actually almost started singing along to the songs and almost started dancing.",qZyeoOkqWEgzcRDF7fr5Ew,1,0,4,ZBt_kgJAj0TAJHXcRgFU3A
5878951,2010-05-13,0,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Personally as a local, if I had to be dragged out to a club/lounge, I would choose Blue Martini for the following reasons:

-Location: It's in TS and I do not have to fight the strip.

-Access: Once again, it's in TS and I do not have to fight my way through a casino's parking garage and what not. 

-Price: Drinks are a little cheaper then the clubs on the strip but not much. 

-Different: It's where the locals go to party. 9 out of 10 times, I try and convince my out of town club going guests to try this place first before we head to Tao, Tryst etc... Mainly because I am burned out of everything on the strip. (Yes I am selfish)

The drinks, the food and the service was all excellent.  If you and your crew (we had like 25 people) want to do this place in style - get a VIP room. We had a blast and it was the perfect end to a wonderful trip to Vegas. 

The food we ordered - Lemon Pepper Chicken Skewers, Baked Ziti, Margarita Flatbread Pizza, Caesar Salad were all very good.  The Dessert Skewers are the shining star!  I would do this again in a heartbeat. 

The evening band was excellent and even sang me Happy Birthday - this was not arranged - just happened out on the dance floor (which is small, but still fun). The DJ is spinning the latest pop music and was what you'd expect.

5896891,2009-09-28,2,UCpUOtvqR-NBWBNVMzJleA,"Blue Martini in Las Vegas has a lot going for it. I went there on a Wednesday night and so might not be the best night to judge the location but I digress. Any faithful reader of my reviews understands that I am a bit different with the way I use my stars and how I write my reviews. Firstly it's a loud happening place where you'll find (from what I've been told) the local crowd in Vegas. I hate loud happening places, so were off to a good start. The bar is part of a shopping plaza right before you get on the strip and so you won't find the throngs of tourists that wonder like fiends (or zombies depending on what casino your in front of). I find that really appealing, because there are several locations to escape the noise and talk with the people your with, they just aren't located at BM. The bar has a large dance floor that is full of pretty (and not so pretty) people dancing. There are, in typical Vegas fashion, over priced drinks and killer views both on the patio and the dance floor.
   There was a live band that night playing OK music. The mixture of drinks, people dancing an the fact that the motto for the night was ""its Vegas baby"" moved people to be a bit more liberal in regards to dancing, yours truly included.
   I'll give blue Martini two stars because while it would be a top bar in most cities, but without ninja's, a car chases, and a healthy dose of bullet dodging I was disappointed. Now I don't care much for expensive trendy drinks, or loud music, or just about anything that BM has going for it. That being the case everyone I was with really enjoyed it. I would like to a quieter patio (like the 16th floor of the M resort) where I can escape and have a drink and  talk without auditory assault in the form of Kanye West via cover band. I bet your asking yourself why did I go if I don't like those places? Simple, Its Vegas baby!",lgKee5h-6U-a00Caj-805A,2,2,2,6GmW5s_sAQmaz1W7Eydlww

They have live music occasionally and some dancing, the music varies between bands and DJs, depending on the night/time.

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;

That was pretty much the reaction of all the people that happened to drop in last night (Tuesday around 10pm) at Blue Martini. The music was still blasting out of the speakers, the bouncer is still checking IDs, but there was at most 20 people including the staff inside.  That is just cra-cra from a business operations perspective.

Not sure what happened to this place.  But even in the middle of the week on ""industry nights"" Blue Martini was a pretty happening place a few years ago.  I am not a regular but from the pictures shared on FB and other social media, it was a fantastic place to hangout with friends and meet new ones.  But now, we walk in after celebrating a coworker's birthday downstairs at another restaurant and the place was like, reserved for VIPs that have yet to arrive.  It felt like walking into that habitually closed and then opened briefly under new management strip club on W. Sahara. The place is big, but how can you stay open when the staff to patrons ratio is almost 1:3 (and I am counting the hostess and bouncer at the front and the bathroom attendant(s).

Anyway, I hope they do better on other more busy nights. Because even with the discounted appetizers and drink specials, without a happening crowd to fill all the squared footage that Blue Martini occupies, they will soon go the way of the prior neighbor Cadillac Ranch.

The first time the two servers blamed each other but did nothing to assist. The next time we finally asked to see a manager. He was equally incompetent and made excuses, that the restaurant was busy. He didn't have an explanation as to why all other customers around us were getting their orders in a reasonable time frame. I'm never going back to this place.

They just escorted out the offender and let that person go, they did not hold that person and call the cops or the ambulance for my friend's cut bleeding nose, my friend couldn't press charges bc the attacker was gone, again and for the third time in 5 years, security orchestrated everything in the same way. We did tell the security guard while the attacker was being hold by the bar in the dance floor, to not let that person go like three times, and he agreed. When the Metro, permanently located at Town Square, arrived, there was no case, the assaulter was gone, and the same security guard, said to my friend that he didn't know that my friend wanted to press charges. Security at BM LV is protecting people who break the law, Instead of protecting well-behaved costumers and regulars. We all must know by now this is BM's policy.This is BM's reputation.

I really like that they have so many martinis and that they have skinny girl martini options.  My inner skinny girl (she's in here somewhere) is pleased at whatever prospect is available of cutting calories.

As far as live music goes, it's OK.  Nothing spectacular.  I've seen a couple cover bands there and they're just OK.
