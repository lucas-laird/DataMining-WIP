I never end up finishing my plate at a breakfast restaurant and although the portions were very generously sized, there wasn't a bite left on my plate (or maybe I should say skillet). It was so good! The green juice I had was also super delicious!! I saw a lot of other diners ordering pancakes and they all looked so good, I will definitely try these next time. In addition to the food being awesome, the service was excellent! You can tell it's a family owned and operated restaurant because the staff all genuinely seem to care and take pride in the restaurant. Everyone was extremely friendly and our coffee cups never sat empty. Can't believe it took me so long to try this place out but it will definitely be my go to breakfast spot from now on and I can't wait to try the lunch as well!",B15xYnbH9vtRkYoHHSkXLQ,0,0,5,TrNgqcWYh7Pj6kOwgrk3sA

There were so many tantalizing options on the menu, but we decided on the Huevos Rancheros, Chilaquiles and the Bacon Burger. I am a Chilaquiles connoisseur and for not being a Mexican restaurant, these were delicious! My family thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well. 

The attentiveness and service was great even though it did take a little more time than normal to get our food. It was definitely worth the wait. 

We will be back soon and we are happy to have found our new go-to brunch spot!

When she did i noticed she sat down and really went over the menu with guest. She answered all there guestions with a smile and made it personal.  When she came to us she did the same thing. Talked to my 10 yr old daughter and broke it down for what she wanted. Then took me and my husband's order.

We got the cold pressed fresh squeezed oj......AMAZING JUICE! It reminded us of juice we would get in Michigan. 

My husband talked to the owner about just buying the juice. The owner infomed us that people do it all the time, he sales it by liters.  

The food was AMAZING! It was more and better than i could have imagined. I got the strawberry pancakes with the combo and the redskin potatoes.

The sandwich had a thick slice of fresh avacado on it at no extra charge. The tomato was fabulous. I asked for pepper jack cheese instead of the cheddar that is ordinarily on it and it was perfect! The fries are great... as is their ranch dressing... not too sweet.

The pancakes are HUUUUGE and fluffy. 

I had a raspberry lemonade and it was awesome! Not too sweet and no weird artificial flavors. There were actual raspberries in it.

Went there yesterday during lunchtime.  The place was fairly empty, maybe people still don't realize that they're open.
They have a large menu, maybe too large, definitely something for everybody.  At first I was excited to see they offer a Monte Cristo sandwich (an increasingly difficult item to find), however I didn't order it when I found out that they do not use thinly sliced ham, instead it contains thick cut ham:(  My buddy ordered it, and he said it was good, but I couldn't pull the trigger.  
I chose the classic Las Vegas breakfast combo: eggs, bacon, potatoes & toast. Everything was good, however my fave thing were the hash browns.  They're cut differently than any I've seen elsewhere, they're flat and wider than usual, almost like short pieces of fettucine.
The service was excellent.  The owner greeted us when we walked in, our server was very attentive and knowledgeable, our drinks were refilled quickly when they got low.  Overall, the place is good, and a welcome addition to the line up of eateries in the Spring Valley area.  Good Luck.",4QnjCKq__RCVVhYvFwfb6g,2,0,4,7g_Qfk9fbNgxe-fXKbwCSw

They remembered us right off the bat, and our server remembered that my boyfriend and I liked to share the strawberry basil lemonade together. The pricing for the restaurant is descent, averaging around $7-$15. The portions are pretty big, so be prepared to take some home with you.

The first time we were here, I can't recall what we ordered, but I remember leaving satisfied. 

This time around, my boyfriend ordered a Spanish omelette with an English muffin and hash browns. I got a chocolate pancake (which comes with three stacks), scrambled eggs, and bacon. It took less than 15 minutes for us to get served.

The chocolate pancake was more than delicious. (I loooove chocolate btw, so for the average person, one might think it is too chocolatey.) The stacks were very light and fluffy -- basically melting sweetness onto my taste buds. I enjoyed the scrambled eggs, which were salted nicely. My boyfriend said his Spanish omelette was ""alright"". He took a bite of my pancakes and said the same thing I did: ""They're reeeally good."" 

Altogether, in my experience, I really liked their food. It's even better when you're already building up an appetite and you get blasted with good food. I'd recommend this place to any of my friends.",zibMDeTBR5QCBUUAzAdmxA,0,0,5,mPvl-mkfjq8zHDdk-6BX8A

The first time we went, service was decent, food was pretty good. At the end of our meal, the busser ended up accidentally knocking the glass syrup bottle off the table, which cracked into pieces and spilled. The busser was apologetic but the server/manager did not even provide an apology or a discount/comp. What frustrated me more was the server yelled at the busser in front of customers instead of assisting with the clean up, talk about unprofessional. 

As for today's visit, food was just ok and service was terrible. We asked the server multiple times for coffee creamer, waited for our side of toast that sat on the counter to be picked up, and was told the side of fruit came with blackberries, blueberries, raspberries...what came out was a bowl of apples that were discolored, mushy strawberries, sour slices of mangoes with the skin, and mushy bananas...it looked as if this fruit bowl had been prepared last week.

There are so many bomb places to eat breakfast in LV. This one is off the list.
Positive: waiter was super nice, friendly and attentive 
Negative: 
Waffle machine was broken...
Joe's wrap minus meat was literally like something I make at home
Might I suggest a garnish of some sort? Fruit on the side(like 3 grapes and some berries, doesn't need to be extravagant) or even an orange slice? Legit looked like my mom made it at home... 
The water also tasted funny... possibly tap water? Get a Brita, the water in LV is not good to drink out of the tap. (Despite what the water district says) Was prescribed by my vet not to feed my dogs tap water. So why would you feed it to people?

As I'm sitting waiting for my food I notice the place is pretty busy but the servers are working efficiently and as a team.  The decor is pretty basic but I'm more interested in the food.  
Good was super fast!!
I ordered the eggs florentine.  It's delicious. I would make a few minor changes but this is my first time here and ordering this dish, anywhere. 
Bonus... Sublime on the speakers! I'll take it!
Fyi, it's Easter Sunday and there are a few families here enjoying their time together.  Makes me miss my family but also feel happy that they get to spend time in such a laid back environment.

Bite Benedict (4.5/5)- eggs Benedict meets chorizo & eggs. Eggs were cooked perfectly (which is usually my biggest worry when I order a Benedict at a new spot), and the Hollandaise was on point (they went light on the chipotle for me since I'm a wuss).

Fresh squeezed OJ was delicious- 5/5

Hazelnut pancakes (5/5)- insane!  My husband didn't finish them (even with me sneaking a few bites off his plate), so we brought them home to snack on later. Warm syrup is the perfect touch!

Except for their sign on the wall, the decor was Spartan and full-on open plan with tables that they can push together or apart to accommodate the size of your party.  Not much privacy, if that is your thing.  But it was pleasant and 

Maybe owing to the spare surroundings I was moved to order the cranberry and walnut oatmeal with a side order fruit bowl.  I guess I didn't feel too adventurous.  It looked better on the menu than it really was, but then it's pretty hard to dress up oatmeal so I don't take away any points for that.  

My wife ordered what she said was BBS Eggs Benedict, which I can't find on the posted menu but was eggs Benedict on French toast.  She thought it was great but the drawback was the cinnamon on the french toast  Seemed like an unusual mix of tastes.  She was in love with the hash browns.  and 

One up side for us was that it wasn't at all crowded when we got there.  It did fill up during our stay but when we got there somewhat late there was no waiting at all.",gKFbnx-0dYcc-jzDVckbVg,0,0,4,kGS2Z4THVeGMs8tKuPgIrA

Despite the great pancake reviews, I had an omelette craving so I orders the classic omelette. It was perfect..sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, avocado, and goat cheese.

Food. I ordered the classic French toast combo. Overall I gave it a 3. My French toast was soggy and needed to be cooked longer, and very badly seasoned. The eggs I ordered sunny side up also needed to be cooked a tad longer and came out a little cold, a 3 to that as well. The bacon was great cooked perfectly.

Bf ordered the corn beef hash and eggs. This was amazing! Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. Which I commend them for since it can be hard to season corn beef hash well since the meat can be very salty to begin with so adding extra flavor can be tricky. This dish is a 5 for sure! 

Overall a give 4 stars because while I understand that mistakes happen in the kitchen, however French toast is hard to mess up, the eggs were a disappointment but the corn beef hash was redeeming!",pvIJiROj_2BamtavC9r0wQ,2,1,4,vdThAaAsaplnxSULAqMDFw

Breakfast Steak roll--got the veggie version of it.  the steak was tough, chewy. i should have read that many people thought it was ""chewy.""  Novel idea that tastes disappointing once you bite into it.

Pancakes--mediocre. a little bit tough and ""wheaty"" in taste. Not delicate or delightful unless you pile butter, fruit, anything on it.

Monte cristo benedict--once again, more about the gimmick than the taste.  I've had some great monte cristo's in the past--this was at the bottom.  The french toast was tough and the hollandaise sauce was seasoned with a paprika that was scented so strong with body odor, i thought it was cumin, not paprika.

I could have used an extra scoop of butter but I will just make a mental note to myself to ask for it should I ever come again. I may. The side of red potatoes I ordered were really good, but I was disappointed with portion size for the $3 charge, but what can ya do. 

My husband ordered some sort of omelette with hash browns and he inhaled his food. He expressed that they were really good, he liked it. Keep in mind he likes everything, but it did look good. 

I couldn't tell what kind of vibe this restaurant is going for. It looked like it was attempting to be kind of country or hipster (idk the difference between the two haha) but then half of the tables are 50s or 60s dinner style and all of the chairs as well and the other half of tables are just regular brown restaurant tables. Beats me. The floor seriously needed a sweeping, but they were busy so I get it I guess. 

Visited on a Saturday, late morning. It was busy but I feel like thats typical for any breakfast joint, big or small. They were understaffed during my experience here. The host was seating tables, bussing tables, serving tables, helping in the kitchen and being the cashier. He wasn't the only one in there multitasking but he definitely stood out. I don't know his name or the other two servers who helped take care of us because none of them introduced themselves. I felt like there could have been more order as far as organization BUT they were getting the job done and everyone appeared happy so its whatever, yeah?

Bite serves fresh pressed juices, so I ordered the apple-lemon-ginger juice. It was amazing and came in a cute mason jar. You could tell that it was fresh pressed because of the pulp that would form on the top if it wasn't shaken. That, and we literally saw the employees juicing and filling the mason jar! It was delicious and I had to pace myself not to drink it all in one sip!

I ordered the ultimate pancake breakfast which was unique and delicious. It is 2 or 3 (can't remember) buttermilk pancakes with layers of over-easy eggs in between so that when you cut the pancakes, the egg yoke oozes over the pancakes. OMG so good. There is also bits of bacon and sausage in between the layers of pancake and sprinkled on top for the perfect mix of salty and sweet. It is really the most perfect breakfast. It is a huge, rich, portion and I could have taken it home, although the runny eggs might make for an inedible lunch. I also ordered a side of hash browns (asked for extra crisp) which were good, but not seasoned enough.

My husband ordered the veggie omelette  and a side of roasted potatoes. The omelette he said was just-ok, but the potatoes were out of this world. You could tell they were fresh, seasoned perfectly, and crispy just like I like them.

I really like the open feel the restaurant has, but in my opinion, the restaurant could benefit from a definite theme. There is a modern like wood mount on the wall... Which I thought was cool. Then on the opposite wall there is a Coca-Cola diner like clock. The kitchen was rather small, which must be why the coffee and soda were placed outside of the kitchen. 

I ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice. It was very good and definitely fresh! I ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon, hashbrowns and toast. As I was waiting for my food I could see the guy, who took my order, toasting my bread... Which I thought was kind of weird. Those are things that are supposed to be done in the kitchen where no one can see, I feel like. 

I really liked the thick fluffy toast, and the thick cut bacon. Other than that, the breakfast didn't have a WOW factor for me.

This actually had good flavor but the spice and heat killed it. I love spicy food and heat, but this was just overbearing and completely masking any flavor that this meal had. The hash browns were cold and had no notable seasoning or flavor. My boyfriend had a build your own skillet with bell pepper onion cheese sausage and bacon, with cinnamon raisin bread.. skillet was small. Not worth commenting on. Just tasted like a homemade omelette. Raisin bread also lack luster. I got an Arnold Palmer to drink which was $5! I wish I looked before ordering. The whole meal came out to $30.

They open at 8:00am daily. We showed up early and had to walk around the parking lot and get exercise before eating, what a bummer! haha

I ordered the Ultimate Pancakes! A nice dose of protein if you count your macros!
It's three pancakes, with (what seems like) an egg in the middle of each and pieces of sausage and bacon right in the center. This would have been plenty for me but I needed to try the corned beef hash after I saw the pictures. Homemade corned beef hash is very hard  to find and Bites is delicious!

Bites Corned beef officially rates #2 in the city next to Jamms. This is not a bad thing because there are about 42 breakfast places that have not been rated or reviewed at all because it simply was not worth the time. (For breakfast and the hash)

My mother ordered the biscuits and gravy. She liked them but thought that the biscuit was a little too hard. I could not get enough biscuits off her plate so I had to order one to go for more ""research"". Once I had it for dinner (the leftover pancakes were lunch) I would say I have to agree. Odd hard biscuit but awesome sausage and bacon gravy.
Bites biscuits still rate #1 in Las Vegas for me.

They were given a 4 for slow coffee service although the waitress was really nice ! (She mentioned the owners are thinking of opening for dinner too, I would totally not oppose this as long as breakfast was all day!)

My dad got the Bite benedict with chorizo. Kind of overwhelming with all the sauce and tasted like a taco. It doesnt matter, but the dining room is kind of ugly. Prices are ok, would give 4 stars but the OJ was almost $5 and never got asked for a refill. Other than that our service was very friendly.

The food was fresh and flavorful.  The fresh squeezed juices were the perfect start to the day.  We ordered a stack of lemon poppy pancakes as appetizer then enjoyed an amazing meal from the kitchen.  We enjoyed Chicken Fired Chicken, The Favorite Omelette, Stuffed Steak Breakfast and WonderBerry Waffle.  No one was disappointed.

Can't wait to be back!  Oh, and be prepared to share!

Service was great, since we were one of the only two tables there. I did think it was kind of annoying that they were sweeping the floors--I have issues with dusty floors potentially getting on my food.

Their food concept is interesting; it is essentially Mexican-American brunch food. Although the waiter told us their juices are super popular, we instead settled for the pineapple mojito which came in a cute mason jar. It was delicious and refreshing and perfectly sweet, but I do think it was a little pricey for the amount we got. 

For entrees, we got the Bite benedict and country fried steak. Their benedict had chorizo in it which spiced things up and sets it apart from the typical benedict. But let's be real, chorizo is tasty by itself. The country fried steak was just a big slab of ham. Not bad, but also not special. I did enjoy their hash browns though; they contained green onion which again, sets it apart from the typical hash brown. 

While I applaud their innovative concept and their great social media presence, I think execution fell a little flat. I don't see myself ever craving food from here.",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,5,3,3,pHG1PLIVPbv_K3ztYCN2vA

We paired it all with classic mimosas (they have quite a few different flavor options which all sound good).

I ordered the fresh brewed iced tea and the hubby got the coffee and fresh squeeze oj. Everything was delicious and you can tell it's made fresh. 

I ordered the country fried steak and eggs. First off I love country fried steak. This was not a county fried steak. It looked like it when it was served but upon first cut, it was literally a breaded fried steak. The steak was not cubed or tenderized. I asked for my hash browns crispy and the cook literally made them crispy like potato chips. I couldn't even eat them with a fork bc they were so crispy. The taste was good and the serving size was good but I think the disappointment of not having a country fried steak threw me off. 

My mom ordered the churro French toast and absolutely loved it. She's been there before and has previously ordered it and said it was consistent  in taste ok both visits. 

My daughters ordered the biscuits and gravy. Nothing outstanding but was good. Very big portions and filling.

I am gluten intolerant but I looked over the menu, and although a lot of it isn't gluten free, I appreciated the fact that it had a good variety in breakfast options and lunch options. I got myself a fresh coconut for my drink and it came with a thick straw which made me happy since I was able to pick up chunks of coconut as I was drinking it. I went with the huevos rancheros with the green sauce. The plate was huge and super filling. The fried tortillas were crisped perfectly and not super soggy from oil or the sauce like it usually is when I order it at most other places. Everything from the eggs, the beans, and the spanish rice were cooked perfectly. Alongside the rice and beans it comes with a side of lettuce with tomatoes, onions, and diced jalapeño which was all fresh. I HATE when breakfast places serve jarred jalapeños. It's gross and I really appreciate that they give you fresh jalapeños. I overall enjoyed my meal, and I'm eager to come back again. The place wasn't packed and loud which was another plus, and the cherry on top was that when I walked in, they were playing music that was making my head hurt more but right when I sat down and told my server I was hungry and hungover, they started playing some good reggae music lol.

2013530,2017-10-28,1,ZOmf-3NN4Z59b2Fw6VAM7g,"To preface this, I am reviewing a delivery order. I had gone out the night before to see Run the Jewels at Brooklyn Bowl. Needless to say, I stayed out late, woke up late, and had zero desire to cook, go outside, or wear a bra to be able to go outside. But I really wanted pancakes and hadn't restocked on eggs or milk. Enter, Bite... 

Not only did I get pancakes, I got THREE flavors, thanks to the pancake flight. I expected little baby pancakes, but was pleased to find a one full-sized of each that I ordered. Considering I ordered a second entree for myself, I realized I was on the verge of a ""couch potato morning binge"". Anyway, I ordered confetti, chocolate chip/banana/pancake, and buttermilk. The second pancake was my favorite. Given the travel time, they were still warm; maybe not as fluffy, but they did the job. 

My second entree was steak chilaquiles. Bomb. The steak was tender and juicy. I ordered a fried egg due to the travel time but I can imagine the dish being even better with runny yolk.

We also ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  I thought it could be more crisp, but it was otherwise great tasting. It was then that we discovered that though my husband doesn't like canned corned beef hash (which is not what Bite serves), he also doesn't like real corned beef in corned beef hash. Go figure. Nothing against Bite's version. 

However, the star of the meal, and perhaps the breakfast menu, are the churro waffles. I expected a cinnamon-sugar waffle, but these bad boys are literally a waffled churro. You get the bite and chewiness of a churro with crispy waffled ridges all coated in cinnamon-sugar. Move over Costco churros... 

I can't speak fully to service since I stayed home in my sweatpants. However, I had difficulty ordering one plain pancake. I selected the one that looked closest. The restaurant called shortly after my order was placed to explain that I couldn't get mile high pancakes (stack of 5 buttermilk pancakes) in the flight, but that they could give me one buttermilk pancake. I appreciated the call to make sure we both had the same expectations. 

Someday, I may find the energy to go outside for pancakes. Until then, I enjoyed this delivery.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,1,0,4,s8FFy7UyNe9PFKbt8YZrOg

Now on to the best part... the menu! Bite has a very diverse menu that offers something for everyone. There are several customizable vegan options available. For nondairy options soy and almond milk are available.  

They offer a variety of juices that are fresh squeezed. I tried the orange juice and it really is delicious. For the same price that other places charged for watered down juice the fresh option here is killer.

I ordered apple cinnamon cakes and a side of hash browns dry (no butter) my boyfriend steak chili kitas and 2 coffees. Wow!! We ate for 5 mins without talking it was so good. All of the ingredients are freshness you can taste. Real fruit is used not synthetic filling.

Absolutely amazing. Try them out!",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,2,2,5,IwvkKxr9HTWdNvw52Ka-qg

The service I received here was top-notch, and if I could I would give it FIVE STARS. Our server's name was Carlos (...I think. He was fantastic but I'm awful with names; I'm sorry.)

However, my food was just okay. I ordered the Monte Cristo Benedict, and while the eggs were perfectly cooked, the french toast underneath was soggy and flavorless. The meat on the benedict is ham and not the Canadian bacon that I am used to, and the maple syrup overpowered the savory notes that I had been expecting. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular either...almost like a bunch of breakfast foods had been piled on top of each other.

I saw a picture of Bite's mint chocolate chip pancakes in the Yelp newsletter, and within a week I was there. The restaurant is located in pretty busy shopping center off of 215 and Flamingo. I had to drive around the lot for a few minutes before I actually found the restaurant. 

Per our server's recommendation, I ordered the hazelnut pancakes. The were just pancakes with a little drizzle of Nutella and hazelnuts sprinkled on top. Something you can easily recreate in your kitchen. I received bacon and eggs with my meal, which were standard - nothing fancy. My meal was around $13, which isn't horrible, but you can receive something tastier at iHop for half the price.

Things to order:
1) Country Benedict
2) Chicken & Eggs
3) Chicken & Cornbread Waffle w/ side of gravy (trust me, gravy+syrup+fried chicken+waffle is an unhealthy mouth explosion)
4) ANYTHING with their gravy
5) Moe's wrap (without gravy when you're trying to give your arteries a break)
6) Lemonades 

I really didn't care for the pineapple mojito, but the lemonades are awesome.  Consistency on how chicken is battered or gravy taste/color can sometimes vary, but it is not detrimental to the quality or deliciousness of the meal.  Also, if you love avocado you will find Bite to be extremely generous!  My boyfriend really likes the skillets/omelets, but this isn't his Yelp account :)  

It's true that sometimes you have to wait, but you have to remember that the servers are regular people, too!  The owner is great (remembers our names & so friendly) and if you ever have a problem with your food, send it back and they'll fix it no problem!

Pancake was thick, fluffy and had enough chew to stand up to the Nutella and maple syrup on top.  Not to mention the whipped cream and bananas.

The picture from Antonia R. of the Monte Cristo also looked badass and to be honest I am not a breakfast person at all. It's tucked away in the shopping center located on Flamingo and Grand Canyon on the south side. 

You walk in and it's an open dining area with larger tables off to the side against the wall and the rest of the space has round tables with 4 chairs. First thing that really caught my eye was the silverware, damn it was shiny! I don't know if it's because it's brand new or they do something special with it, who knows still cool to look at and eat with. 

I ordered the Monte Cristo of course and had a glass of water with lemon. I always order it with lemon and usually half the time they forget it or its a lil slice thing that you can't do shit with. They brought out huge slices of lemon that more than sufficed, other places need to copy their lemon protocol. The server was very friendly when taking my order and came with my food promptly. 

Now I thought the Monte Cristo at Canters in LA was the best I've had but after trying this I have to honestly say I prefer the one here. There not stingy with the ham and cheese and you can still taste the egg, it doesn't get lost in the mess like it does other places. THEY HEAT UP THE SYRUP! I know it's not that serious but warm syrup with Monte Cristo goes together rather well. Every time I was low on water to waiter came by and filled up my glass without asking, which I like unless I'm done eating.

There is no shortage of breakfast and brunch joints in Vegas, but do any of them offer up exceptionally great service, no wait and an overall inventive and scrumptious menu offering? Yeah, I didn't think so until I met Bite LV! 

We arrived at about 12:45 pm on a Saturday (prime brunch time), they weren't busy and we were seated immediately. We opted to order 2 popular items that we peeped many mouthwatering pictures of on yelp - that's right, we got the:

Ultimate pancakes! ($13.95) - 3 eggs surrounded by buttermilk pancake batter with bacon and sausage pieces! Once you cut into the pancake the yolk just runs out like nobody's business and soaks into the delicious fluffy pancake batter. It was a generous sized portion and honestly would have satisfied my fiancé and I just fine. Baby, these are the real deal all-in-one breakfast. Flavor: 5/5

Stuffed french toast Monte Cristo with turkey, thick sliced ham, fried egg, & melty swiss cheese! ($10.49) - it is a whopping sized monte cristo style sandwich served with butter on the side (!) It doesn't even need the butter, trust. However, a dip of syrup was a great compliment to the French toast. This decadent beast was hard to pick up so it may turn into a knife and fork situation. Definitely a hearty way to start your day. Flavor: 4/5

Our awesome server also freshly ""hand"" squeezed our orange juice! The juice was naturally sweet and refreshing - so good! Too many places take fresh OJ for granted nowadays. Such a shame. Flavor: 5/5

Overall the location is good but the restaurant itself could use a deep cleaning. Doesn't appear to be well maintained and gives it a run down feeling.

The omelette was not seasoned and there wasn't any goat cheese (even though the menu lists that as an ingredient).

I was really hoping this place would be amazing and even called to see how long the wait was.  We came in on a Friday around 1pm with one other person and there was literally just one other group in there eating.  We waited in front for a good long while since there was nobody working in front to greet us.  Finally a girl came out and told us to grab our own menus and to sit wherever.  

Once we sat, waters were given to us.  We're from Orange County and it was our first time here.  She didn't really go over the menu with us.  She kinda just was like ""Are you ready?"".  We asked for a moment.  Once we were ready the waitress came to take our order.  She was rude.  She was really rushing our order.  For example, we ordered the Bite's Corn Beef Hash and a Will's Morning Wrap.  For the Corn Beef Hash, we had the option of white or wheat bread.  She would only ask or answer in one word and would never look at us.  WTF?!  She would speak quickly after us.  It was weird.  I don't even know why she was rushing us when we were at that time the ONLY customers in the entire place.  Annoying.

The corn beef hash arrived with some toast and strawberry jam.  The corn beef was a pretty good portion with lots of meat, hash browns on bottom and a fried egg on top.  I didn't think it was anything special.  The Will's morning wrap had the option of regular tortilla or spinach.  We went with spinach.  It also came out with a side of salsa.  The wrap was huge.  It was pretty dry tasting though and also nothing impressive.  

Our total was $21 there.  Besides breakfast items they also had their lunch menu.  As for service, like I have mentioned before, pretty bad.  She didn't come once to check up on us.  She also kept disappearing while we were there.  We didn't see her much until another co worker guy of hers came in to work.  So basically no service.

I got the Bite Benedict which is a mexi-style Benedict with chipotle hollandaise, chorizo, and pico on top. The ""pico"" was just onions, two pieces of tomato, and a mound of jalapeños. Under the poached egg there was another MOUND of jalapeños. I love spicy stuff but this was overkill. There was no balance in this dish... more like a spicy punch to my GI system. On top of that, the red potatoes that came with it were over cooked and under seasoned. 
My boyfriend got their ""signature stuffed steak"" which is simply a flank steak rolled around some eggs. Very lack-luster. It had decent flavor but for something that's a signature, you would think it was more refined. 
The service was okay. The wait was minimal. The ambiance was decent.

The food was as delicious as it looks, but we did have a slight issue with our server.

Everyone from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave is very nice. Asking how your day is, your meal is, did you enjoy it, etc. I love the fresh squeezed juices, such an easy thing to do goes a long way. The OJ was bomb, but not as amazing as the raspberry lemonade chalk full of fresh raspberries. They even were considerate enough to ask what type of flavor creamer we wanted with our coffee. Little touches like that go a long way.

My husband had the corned beef hash. He asked for a side of biscuit and gravy and the server said ""Well, I can do english muffin and gravy"". My husband looked confused, like why can't he get what he asked for? In the end, it was worked out and he was really pleased with his meal.

My son ordered a chocolate chip pancake. Normally it comes as a 3 stack, he can barely eat one. Again, she looked confused as to if she could do that. We explained that we don't like to waste for what we know won't be eaten, so just bring one. We ordered without whip cream, and it came with whip, however, they were quick to fix.

I had the chicken and waffle. The chicken was outstanding. The waffle was...just ok. I heard the table next to me say the same thing. I prefer my waffle very crispy, and it was doughy. When you add syrup to that, it just made a big mushy mess. I think maybe they just need to rework the batter a little.

2880663,2015-10-12,6,ZOmf-3NN4Z59b2Fw6VAM7g,"To preface, I really wanted to eat at Lulu's for breakfast, but it was already so late in the morning that we didn't feel like driving so far north, so we ended up here. Maybe it was the expectations of delicious, delicious Lulu's that this place really paled in comparison to. 

They occupy the previous Pasta Fresh place, which I think was also riddled with the same problems as this business. Set-up is very simple and they have a wall with one larger TV showing kids shows, and two smaller TVs on another wall showing sports. We received our menus, which as other reviewers have mentioned, were a bit all over the place. The font and coloring doesn't make it an easy read. Server #1 gave us the low down on the menu and recommended the juices. We still weren't ready to order, so he gave us some time. Server #2 took our order as we ordered the green juice, the Southern Benedict with hash browns and the Chicken Fried Steak with red potatoes. Server #3 delivered our food, and I pointed out to her that the Southern Benedict came with red potatoes, as opposed to the hash browns my husband ordered. She said no problem, called to the kitchen to give us a side of hash browns, and we never heard from her or saw those hash browns again. I think this may be a problem with their multi-server system. Although its nice to flag anyone down, it lacks accountability and follow-up and puts the onus on the customer to update you when something is and is still not right. 

The green juice we ordered was very refreshing and tasty. They only had ""market price"" on the menu, which was a bit weird to me. It came out to $8, but I think they should either be proactive with pricing or have set prices. Even well-established juice places in the area are able to price out their juices consistently or at least advertise pricing. I do wonder though if its just a bit of kale in there and a whole lot of pineapple juice. It was really, really sweet, that's what made it so good. They aren't obligated to put ingredients in order of content like other juice places, so if you're looking for a healthier drink, maybe ask to clarify how much ""green"" actually goes into it. 

The meals we got were not very good. I love salty things, to the point where I could just snack on coarse sea salt all day, but their red seasoned potatoes were overly salted, even for me. I had to take a big gulp of water every time I had a bite and I didn't even both using ketchup (which is weird for me, I put ketchup on everything). I depleted my water fast, and no one came to refill our waters. The chicken fried steak did not have that crispy crust I'm accustomed to at other breakfast places, but the over-easy eggs were made well and added much needed flavor to the gravy. It also came with toast, I opted for cinnamon raisin bread. The bread came out pre-buttered, but was done very sparsely. The bread was also very dry and hard, and at the end of the meal, I just had a pile of crumbled tough pieces. Seriously, they messed up toast. Maybe we should have ordered a more ""sweet"" breakfast, since that's what everyone else seems to be raving about. I would rather eat at a place where I could get quality savory dishes as well though. Paying was a bit awkward and unclear. We didn't know if we needed to go up to the front since no one told us or handed us our check (and this is after we already got our to go box). We finally flagged someone down who said they could give us our check, but we still would have to pay up front. Server #3 was handling the register, but since we didn't have any check to give her, she was confused at what table we came from (makes sense, since she forgot our hash browns), so she had to ask server #2 our table # and if our order was right. 

Just like Pasta Fresh, they clearly have a lot of fans who love their food and I hope they do well, but for me, breakfast ended up being $40.. and I'd rather spend that money on better service and food somewhere else.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,8,5,2,Lm0sWYb4-_YZaKwzYjtrJg

Excuse me while I drool. SRSLY??!?!? This was such a great breakfast spot find! THANK YOU FELLOW YELPERS! On a recent visit to Vegas, we stayed off the strip in Summerlin As it is a small community and not a tourist destination, finding restaurants required a bit of Google mapping and pouring over yelp reviews. Thank goodness we checked this place out. Located in a strip mall that was pretty quite for a Saturday morning, we found BITE. It is a large room with exposed ceilings. They have a few arty BITE signs hanging in the dining room, a chalk board with daily specials and large windows so light comes beaming through. Outside of that, it can feel a little underwhelming. But it quickly recovers with fresh juice options, bubbly servers and well executed food. The wait time was fairly good. The place has a buzz about it and had tons of locals waiting along side visitors. And the food presented itself as high quality, not greasy spoon, which I really liked.

Big portions and made to order! 

Im unsure if the syrup is maple or just maple flavored either way its diluted

Pancakes were dry and lacked flavor. Maybe try a better oil to cook it in?

Fried chicken was crisp - a little to salty.

I love the concept...maybe have a smaller menu and rid of all artificial stuff?!

I love to find a spot to post up, read my book and take my time. Not too loud in here and the staff is ridiculously friendly. Coffee is good and they keep it coming. That's important. 

I've had a few of their signature dishes including their house made hash and most of their omelets. Everything has been good though I wasn't a huge fan of their chicken fried steak. It wasn't bad, I'm just a sicker for the thin pounder and breaded CFS you typically find.

3199463,2015-06-09,2,ZOmf-3NN4Z59b2Fw6VAM7g,"SUNDAYS are PACKED!

Roomie wanted us to try this place so we came here for lunch on a Sunday hot afternoon & the moment we open the door it was like PACKED FULL HOUSE CRAZY! The decor was cute like simple diner style.

We Waited for about 15 minutes(party of 3) as our names were on the wait list... the moment a table got up they cleared that table up fast because by the time those people were walking out the door we were already being walked to the table.

The menu was HONESTLY a bit overwhelming w/ so many different selections double sided not very big font but we pulled it together & decided.

So it took about 7 minutes until someone came to take our drink orders but the waitress that came through was sweet & patient as we ordered too many items for ourselves (the bois mainly) but she got them. She brought out our mason jar juices right away & when they went low she brought us a round of waters. The food took about 20 minutes but it was busy which seemed non-stop until it died out when we got our food.

HAZELNUT PANCAKES $9.75 - 3 huge pancakes served w/ hazelnut bits, whipped cream, banana, & nutella drizzle. I asked for extra nutella but it seemed normal as there was only drizzle for the first layer. It was also sitting in the window for a while because I saw a big pile of whip cream & there was what looked like liquidized cream when it got to the table along w/ maybe half a banana in slices.

SOUTHERN BENEDICT  $10.95 - English muffin topped w/ sausage patty, poached egg, & bacon gravy. Not bad just simple.

NATALIE'S BREAKFAST BURGER $11.95 - this was like a protein on protein on protein stack of protein in between a bun. MEATY but but bland.

GATSPY BURGER $12.95 - Crispy onion strings, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, BBQ sauce, mayo & cheddar cheese...Topped with a sunny side up egg. The beef patty was juicy but it definately needed a little seasoning for the thickness

DREY'S CORN BEEF HASH $4.95 - lots of beef & KAPOWW in yo face flavor!

WILL'S WRAP $6.99 - Onion, peppers, bacon, sausage, cheddar Egg whites, turkey bacon, basil and cheese, potatoes & egg

BITE'S HASH $2.75 - rectangle piece of hashbrown with big chunks of potato

ORANGE JUICE $3.99 - fresh squeezed but it wasn't very cold probably because it was stored in a open display fridge thing

APPLE JUICE $4.99 - freshly squeezed ahahah wasn't my thing my palate needs to get used to it. xP

ALL-IN-ALL it was a cute place to try... there is a variety of choices for those that can't decide on one thing ... i just feel that they could consolidate their menu & focus on the flavor of more specific items. But it could also just not be my style of eats. Just your average eatery for foods that you don't want to cook at home yourself",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,7,3,3,X2FuCC8cFgXcVc5UKsX-kw

Most of the restaurants are either chains, pubs or restaurants to cater to tourists.  However, I'm always on the hunt for great little places like this one.  Went there for breakfast yesterday and I was very pleased.  I was in the mood for pancakes, so I got the Mint Chocolate Chip Pancakes with bacon and fried eggs.  The pancakes were outstanding, however it is a HUGE portion.  I could only eat half.  And they are very rich with the chocolate fudge, whipped cream, chocolate chips, and the maple syrup.  The bacon was perfect, not too crisp and not too limp and it was rather thick cut, which I like.  The eggs were also cooked perfect.  I'm not an egg eater, but when I do eat them, I want them COOKED, no runny yolks!  And they were perfect.  My server was very good and very kind.  The place was clean as well.  The one issue I had was they may need a pest control person to come spray.  Nothing major, but a fly kept wanting to share my breakfast.

Drinks are served in mason jars, very cute and country. Their menu has a lot of items on it. Typical pancakes, waffles, French toast, and sandwiches for lunch. Hubby ordered Drey's Corned Beef Hash and I ordered Bite's Stuffed Steak. 

Decor is sparse. It's a fairly plain place. The music was nice and it was enough to drown out a table full of obnoxious teenagers that were being ridiculously loud about the people they're sleeping with. Completely inappropriate conversation for a place that had families dining. 

Very poor ventilation, my hair and clothes smelled like cooking grease all day.

Ok first complaint. Hubby originally wanted to order Bite's Loco Moco but they didn't have ground beef left (boo!). They also didn't have any hashbrowns left... I'm sorry but if you know that those are popular item menus then you should order more of it to ensure you don't run out. 

Hubby was somewhat disappointed in the corned beef hash. It was very dry and the serving size was very small for the price. Flavor was good but just not worth the money. Wouldn't order this again. 

The stuffed steak was good. Steak was cooked perfectly but not enough seasoning. I don't think it's worth ordering again either. 

Customer service was great, our server even made me an iced coffee that wasn't on the menu. Hubby wants to come back to try the loco moco. We might have to call prior just to make sure they actually have it but until then, this review",JddUKeXfP0lhsxrEkoCBPQ,0,0,3,gtPhAvcyzxa16i9FvM5IMg

My husband and I wanted to stay near the area we needed to do some shopping at so I was pleased to find Bite on yelp and the high ratings. 

As expected, Sunday morning was busy but there were a few available tables that we didn't have to wait. Thank goodness because 5 minutes later, we would have been standing in line. 

My husband initially ordered the short rib hash. Unfortunately, they were not serving it that day. the waiter did mention that they might be brining it back. Well, I recommend taking it off the menu until then. 

My husband ordered the country fried steak instead while I ordered the huevos rancheros as it came with rice. 

The portions are perfect, not too much and not too little. My husband commented on the how good the breading was on his country fried steak. As for my breakfast, not boring at all. The eggs sat on two pieces of crunchy tortillas which I liked the little snap to it. On the side was a little salad that I wondered why, but it really went well with my meal. The rice was cooked perfect but the refried beans was a little runny. I'm not an expert on refried beans but I do know I like mines a little thicker. 

My husband asked about the ""cold press"" to which it was explained that the juices are freshly pressed every morning. My husband ordered the apple lemon ginger. Because he ordered it after we finished our meal, we needed to take it to go. walking around with a glass mason jar without a place for a straw is not ideal. But beware, the drink is $6.95 and they charge $1.00 for the jar. So although my husband had his drink put into a plastic cup, we took home the jar. 

The service was fantastic. We noticed that no women were working that morning. In any case, it was nice to see several young men hustling and making it a great way to start the day which is something I rarely see nowadays. In fact, the lady sitting next to us returned her breakfast as they didn't make her meal as she had requested. A minute later, what seemed to be the manager came over to check to see if she was okay, which she was. And a few minutes later, a whole new breakfast based on her request appeared. 

I also have to comment on the music. I grew up in HI, so it was very nice for me to hear reggae, feel good island music playing. Now I wish they had fried rice omelette or HI style fried rice with eggs and Portuguese sausage or even loco micro on the menu. 

By observing the many establishments I have been to, running a successful restaurant has got to be one of the most difficult things to do. Mahalo guys for truly getting my day started off right.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,0,0,4,bciFabZ3K0aCwwLGaPFGBA

Just find Tropical Smoothie and it's a few properties over.

The setting is a bit odd, as it almost feels like the restaurant is unfinished; the walls are blank, the ceilings are high with an uneven amount of natural light--it just felt a bit off, like something was missing. 

Bite offers breakfast and lunch, with the standard offerings, but also some unique dishes like the Crunchy Cinnamon Raisin French Toast; cinnamon raisin bread crusted with Cinnamon Toast Crunch and cooked in the traditional french toast fashion. For personal reasons, I ordered mine without the cereal crust, along with a side of bacon.

The French toast was good, but similar to the environment, it felt like something was missing. The cinnamon raisin bread was lacking a sort of sweetness, as well as that cinnamon flavor you'd expect from that sort of bread. I'm not sure if this by design, or because the cereal is meant to add the sweetness, but it was still tasty regardless. The bacon was also really good quality as well. 

Overall, as someone who loves to frequent breakfast places, Bite was good, but wasn't particularly memorable. I'll probably stop by every once in a while to sample their other dishes, but if you're just looking for a decent breakfast at a good price, you can't go wrong with Bite.",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,1,1,3,IP5G04VpyFzpXUTphKEJrQ

We've been here twice and were impressed both times by the food and service. I can't remember what I had the first time, but it was the special of the day and I think it had brisket,  or might have been the short rib hash. Either way...amazing flavor!  Second time around, had The Favorite skillet which was so filling but very good. I loved that it had avocado and I think gorgonzola or goat cheese. Yum. 

Hubby has a sweet tooth so he tried one of the waffle dishes and then the banana nut bread french toast. Waffles and french toast are his go-to's for breakfast spots and determines whether it's a good one or not. This place passed his test! 

Service is quick and friendly. I hope more people come and try them out so they can stick around for awhile. I'm sure we'll be back often as we're right across the street.",mYcRL0cJtHeXRBup5wwppQ,2,1,5,f-VOmZo5WbdeRIR75rqUIw

The owners of this place relocated their business from Sun City in Summerlin to the space formerly occupied by the short-lived Pasta Fresh. There's not much decor to speak of other than wall art made from planks of wood. Luckily, the food is more noteworthy than their interior design. Their large, all-American menu is full of sandwiches, wraps, and breakfast items. The most creative items are their pancakes, waffles, and French toasts. Too much mint extract takes away from an otherwise fluffy stack of mint chocolate chip pancakes. Beer cakes proved more impressive with subtle hoppiness within airy pancakes. The stack of three contained chunks of bacon within the batter and sprinkled on top. Probably the equivalent of three strips of bacon.

Come hungry if you want to finish any of those items or others such as a large, well executed BLT ($8.95) or the Gatspy burger ($12.95) -- hand-ground meat topped with crispy strips of bacon, onion strings, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and a sunny side up egg.

No credit cards accepted is a major inconvenience when wanting to take a large family to eat. I have no clue why they went with this strategy but if this was done to save money, I can assure them it is costing them more money than it is saving.

Service is good but the last time we went we were the only people in the entire restaurant so I'd only expect good service in such a scenario. A lot of the old familiar faces we used to see and speak with appear to no longer be there.

This place used to have great ambiance but when the restaurant is empty, it now feels depressing.

The food is good overall. 

There are so many options for breakfast in Summerlin, including directly across the street, that's it difficult to keep going back here.

3749331,2016-07-17,0,ZOmf-3NN4Z59b2Fw6VAM7g,"I really wanted this to be a great place for breakfast, but I was really disappointed. I know that restaurants have such steep competition in Vegas, but, there always a few local spots that can hang. Its a really cute space, but after looking over the menu, I'm confused with their overall style of food. Reggae music is playing, huevos rancheros and other ""south of the border"" options are on the menu, so I cannot pinpoint their style. The website states ""modern American food with flare"", which also boasts over 20 kinds of pancakes (didn't see those) or pancake lollipops(didn't see these either). I may have seen the owner, Andrey, but he definitely wasn't making rounds with customers or working the line. He was outside giving dap to a new tenant next door. 

 On this first visit,  we ordered the Monte Cristo French toast Benedict. The menu describes it as the Monte Cristo atop some of the best French toast finished with over easy eggs and hollandaise sauce. Typically Monte Cristo sandwiches are deep-fried with ham and Swiss cheese, served with traditional raspberry jelly and powdered sugar. MINE was layered with cold turkey and ham lunch meat, melted Swiss and less than spectacular French toast. In fact, the French toast had zero taste, so there really wasn't a great blend of sweet and salty. Looked like a thick cut of French bread in the picture, but pretty sure it was just a slice of Bimbo bread. The hollandaise was a huge disappointment. Runny and had a more than mild curry flavor. So again, I'm confused as to what the ""chef"" is trying to accomplish with these crossing over of flavors. My husband ordered a skillet, which is really hard to screw up, but lacked flavor. The freshly squeezed orange juice was great, but that's probably the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.  I'm always hesitant to try new places around town, but willing to give a local establishment a first time try. I left feeling like this restaurant was trying hard to compete with Stacks and Yolks/Babystacks, but fell extremely short. There were some great items on the menu that might have some potential, but if you can't master a simple hollandaise, you might want to rethink your prized benedicts.",6FyCo_qm9V8fDP3DeZgotg,0,0,2,_NCq1KlHoimX8v_8Ddp12A
3781174,2016-12-11,1,ZOmf-3NN4Z59b2Fw6VAM7g,"This was our first time coming to Bite and we were very excited, based on the high Yelp reviews and pictures. 

Our initial take was this place is great! The customer service was great at the beginning and the juices were excellent. I had the fresh squeezed orange juice and my Girlfriend had the apple lemon ginger. 

We wanted to try a few things, so I had the monte cristo sandwich and she had one hazelnut pancake and half off an order of banana nut French toast. The minute cristo was ok...but not great. The meat was really good, but the French toast had no flavor. And it's served with a side of butter. Why?? I asked for a side of raspberry jam (which is what a monte cristo is SUPPOSED to come with). They guy said ok, but the girl who brought it out said they don't have that, and they only have strawberry purée. Which wasn't bad...but not the same thing. I was very disappointed because Las Vegas doesn't have a great Monte Cristo sandwich. I guess I still haven't found one. 

The hazelnut pancakes were good, but everyone does a Nutella pancake now a days. The banana nut French toast was by far the best thing! However, it wasn't really French toast...just banana bread with some banana and butter. 

The price was a bit too much. Total bill $35. $5 for one pancake, $8 for her juice and $4 for my OJ. It seemed a little much for those things. 

The final reason I gave a 4 star is that the owner said hello to everyone around us, except us. He spent a good 15 minutes talking to a guy who looked like a UFC fighter and then chatted up the old guy next to us for 5 min. Straight up ignores us, not even a hello or how's the food? 

Very disappointing experience overall. Dang it! I was really hoping for more.",3vVyzNzz4zkvyWtGjJ37tA,1,3,3,oh8thU2IfIt1CSbESCc1JA

The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's 25 minutes away from me.  Maybe that's a good thing in my case but it's well worth the drive.  If you come on the weekends make sure to come early, it fills up fast.

parking wasnt to bad but it was a friday morning, the restaurant wasnt  busy at all. This is where it all went down hill. Upon entering the restaurant there were no workers around to greet us. We walked up to their register and began scouring their menus to see if there is anything we wanted but being seated. 5 mins later a woman finally greets us and asks us to take 2 menus and find a place to sit. 

We ended up ordering the Will's Morning Wrap and Corn Beef Hash.

The wrap was a good size and was decent. It came with sausage, hash browns,and onions wrapped in a spinach tortilla, a flour option is also available. The salsa that accompanied the wrap was plain and not spicy whatsoever. 

The Corn Beef Hash came with toast, hash Browns and over easy eggs. It nothing to write home about and honestly wished I never ordered it. The corn beef lacked any flavor. 

Please save the trip if you are in vegas and just eat elsewhere or wait until you are back in Cali, as driving out here is not worth it.",hHi4g3w_oXDhM7p7xQrZwQ,0,0,2,vWidupU1CYcZpsQ6bv_iXg

The staff is very unorganized, had over a 15min wait when half the tables were empty. They also messed up on 2 of my items.

I had the french toast sampler combo.

The french toast churro was good but very sweet, the 2nd style was strawberry with a cream cheese. Wasnt very flavorful and the strawberries were not very good tasting. Not sure if its season or not but if its not they should take it off menu. The 3rd style was with bacon, bananna and peanut butter. On this on they forgot all the toppings so i had to send it back. When it returned the flavor was decent but whatever the peanut butter they use is very dry.

I also had a side of potatoes which they forgot to bring but when i brought it to their attention it was brought very promptly.  Sadly i wish i didnt ask for them as they where under cooked and very bland. They where supposed to have a seasoning but there was nothing on them. I think they may have forgot to add it? I dunno.

The reason i have them at 2 stars and not 1 is the bacon was very good and chewy.  I prefer chewy bacon over crispy.

The cottage cheese was good, and I did not try the potatoes (I thought the cottage cheese was a $1 substitution for the toast and potatoes, but it must have just been for the toast).

Bite has been a bookmark since they opened in 2015.  It's now 2017 and I'm just now reviewing them. It really doesn't take much for a breakfast joint to please me.  Eggs, bacon, a decent steak, and good service is all it takes for me to be satisfied.  Bite didn't fail with me.  The service was awesome from start to finish.  We were seated immediately on a holiday morning.  Our server, Kristina, took care of us by taking our orders and keeping our drinks full. Be prepared to eat when you come here because your food is prepared/served with minimal wait.  The menu consist of your typical breakfast items, some colorful pancakes, and their signature stuffed steaks.  I was craving steak, bacon, and eggs.  So, my decision was an easy one...the Stuffed Steak w/Eggs & Bacon and Hash Browns.  My main dish consist of a couple of eggs & bacon that's wrapped by a thin piece of steak.  Imagine having a breakfast burrito, but instead of tortilla, it's wrapped by 6 oz. of steak.  Yes, that's what I got.  I'm a protein lover and if you are too, then you'll love this combination.  Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal and see myself coming back.  If I can afford the calories, then I'll try their pancakes too.

It's always crowded, but table turnover is quick, so the wait time is not too bad.  Coffee is strong and hot and the food is great comfort food.  Think diner food with a Mexican influence.  My favorites are the steak and eggs and the chilaquiles.  The fresh pressed juices are a pleasant surprise, as is the homemade salsa.  Prices are a tad high but the quality of food justifies the price point.  I am a firm believer of you get what you pay for and the food is fresh-made and worth the price.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,3,0,4,VvrSUf2NwIc_GClqw_a7rQ

4097235,2016-02-01,0,ZOmf-3NN4Z59b2Fw6VAM7g,"When we first arived it was a bit smokey. It was busy buy we have a child was was coughing.  I also heard the table next to us complain about there eyes. Even with the door open it was a little extreme.  A little better ventilation could go a long way.

    At first I thought we would have to wait a while because they were packed, and sadly there was a very small waiting area woth a few bar stools, and could turn into a stressful situation fast.

     After we sat down there was multiple people coming up to the table that worked there, but none of them would take our order due to the fact they were not are server. Which was very confusing because it seems like nobody knew who our server was. After a 15 minute wait in asking the lady in the back, there was finally someone at our table to take our order.

    After we had placed our order our waiter had returned back to the table to let us know that a couple of the meals we had ordered they no longer had the product to service our food. After we continue to name a few orders he continued to tell us that they were out of potatoes they're out of hamburger meat and so on and so on.


    After an hour and a half of seeing employees run around confused and upset at each other they finally started to bring out ourfood after most of the restaurant what's gone already. Even after they thought they had the situation handled with our table they still continued to mess up even after we were the only ones left in the restaurant. My wife was pregnant and ask to have her steak medium well after she had received her steak the steak was medium rare. Also a few minor things like, we receive the appetizer after the entrees, & they forgot my kids meal all together.

   And to make the situation even better as people were getting up and leaving before we received our food an old lady had slipped and fallen flat on her face due to the fact the restaurant floor was dirty.

  And my final word is the whole reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars is because the service was horrible but the food was phenomenal and after all that I have gone through for the horrible service I would definitely try and come back for some of the items on the menu. The food was delicious and their menu was very creative. I even took some of my favorite classic meals and put a spin on it. Plus the servers were very apologetic but, sadly sorrys don't fix bad service.

  At least would even considered giving this restaurant 3 to 4 stars if management would have came out and spoke with us and try to make the situation better or just simply hear an apology from the manager himself and making sure that everything will be on point would put some comfort into the situation

   There is also something about seeing our waiter rolled his eyes pull his hair and go crazy over the fact that services are going well makes the situation ten times more stressful.

My best advice is if you want to eat at this restaurant, call ahead to make sure they're not busy so you don't have to go to the nightmare I had to go through.

The eggs are fluffy and delicious the potatoes are on point and the bacon gravy is so freakin good. I didn't put it on biscuits because I was too cheap/lazy/not hungry enough, to eat it. I imagine they are delicious though!

From the staff to the food, to even the customers who are a table away from you! This visit was my husband and I's first time. We wanted to eat someplace new for breakfast and stumbled upon BITE on Yelp! I asked if the funfetti pancake was popular and for a first timer, it was! (This is also my favorite cake, so I just had to try!! :D) So I ordered the funfetti pancakes and added a combo to it (eggs & bacon) with a side of extra crispy hash browns. Our son, who is 9 months old, loved eating the eggs! ;) && my husband ate one of the skillets, turkey and guacamole one?!... Not only did they have delicious breakfast, but they also serve freshly made juices! I ordered the kale pineapple one and my husband had the kale Apple celery one. I liked his better, the server did too! but mine wasn't bad.. If you like more greens j recommend the kale pineapple one (there were other ingredients I just forgot them). If you're more on the fruity & sweet side I'd go with the apple celery one! On another note, early on just when our food came.... Out of no where... Our sons car seat flipped over & fell off the high chair (my son was trying to lean forward...-_-) but anyways the car seat fell on the floor ... Face down.. BUT LUCKILY our son didn't get hurt. My point is the service was super caring and worried for him that made this review 5 stars!

My sister had a wrap, I don't know what kind but within 5 minutes she inhaled the whole thing so i guess it was good. I ordered the breakfast steak burrito thing, filling of eggs, cheese and veggies. I usually don't order steak for breakfast but this was something unique to the menu so I wanted to be brave. The steak was seasoned and tender and the portion was large enough to share. Also we all wanted to try the pancakes and dammit those were good too. They even served them with warmed syrup in a recycled Crown Royal bottle which was so unique and adorable.

Definitely delicious all around...  that was my first review. Unfortunately I went back and it was a total miss! So many things went wrong. We were seated but didn't see our server for about 10 minutes. Ordered food for 3 people. We only got half of it. They forgot to ring in my son's pancakes and both of our sides. So me and my husband got our breakfast without sides and my son got nothing. Took almost 10 minutes for them to give him his pancakes. My food was just ok. Eggs were pretty badly burnt and my hashbrowns were undercooked and under seasoned. Very disappointing experience. Then at the end they didn't bother to comp my son's pancakes or offer us anything in return for the poor food and service. Just rude.,fdgt3ASb-8iLS0F2CVKlEQ,0,0,2,SP1OGvHqKmA6ZoSgOz-rTA

I was in town visiting family and decided to stop by and get a bite to eat, when I lived in Las Vegas this place was a routine meeting and hang out spot for breakfast. The quality of food and service has declined so much since the last time I ate here.  The service was slow, and it took the food about 35 to 40 minutes to get to the table. The food was subpar and on the level of an IHOP or Denny's. The potatoes were over salted and seasoned, and rest of the food was bland.

After a reasonable wait for seating, we were serviced by an incompetent waitress who didn't know the menu and also didn't know how to input our order into their POS system. 

People being seated way after us were receiving their orders while we just sat there getting more and more frustrated. When our orders finally did come, two out of the four dishes came out incorrect. After finally getting to taste the food, I can honestly say that disappointed was a gross understatement. The French toast had so much cinnamon on it that it was bitter. The pancakes were deformed and dry like cardboard. I had to use half the bottle of syrup to be able to eat the pancakes without choking. The chicken fried steak was tough like a shoe. My friend could barely cut it with a knife.

Needless to say, I will not be back. It's fairly difficult to screw up breakfast items but we got hit with the double whammy of bad service and food.",Kzg53JYta9N3OE-J9JJSzQ,1,0,1,7fWWli2XoZrqFPmQzK8JQQ

Where to start:

Waitstaff - super friendly, amazingly attentive, laid back, funny, great suggestions on their menu. You can tell they are very familiar with the food, and take pride in the quality and the taste. 

THE JUICE. 
If you come here and don't order from their fresh juice menu, you fail at life. 
I ordered the Apple Lemon Ginger and my god...heaven in my mouth. For only 4.99 this is a steal. Good luck finding that price anywhere else. AND it comes in a giant mason jar. It's a PINT. A PINT OF JUICE FOR $4.99!!! 

THE FOOD. 
I got the two egg breakfast with egg whites and turkey bacon. Never in my life have I seen two eggs this size. Incredible value. Hash browns are adorable - little thing sliced pieces of potatoey goodness. You can order them extra crispy as well. It was so much food that I had to take it home.

Granted, the place was busy, but there were clean tables ready for customers, that just remained open. Once seated, we had to wait twenty minutes to get our order in, even our server knew that the timing to get our order in was really bad, as he profusely apologized about the wait. Another thirty minutes to wait until we finally got our food, and I knew it was a bad sign when we saw people who were already seated before us, still waiting for their food. Our food looked delicious, although once we finally got it, our food was cold, and with the open kitchen, I saw our food waiting to be picked up for about ten minutes.

I've ordered this type of sandwich only once before so I expected it to come with raspberry sauce because I thought that was the norm. The waiter brought out some warm maple syrup for me to drizzle. It was different but still tasty. I like the savory salty and sweet  mixture.

I had an omelet, hash browns and toast (pictured) and my son had the Monte Cristo and a side of hash browns. Both dishes arrived hot but again, a little bit of a longer wait than I would expect but the food was good. Fluffy warm omelet, big pieces of bacon mixed into the egg and not too much cheese. Hash browns were a thick, steel cut type and lightly seasoned but I like them with more salt so I just added. Good texture to the browns and a little bit of crunch. 

My son's Monte Cristo (pictured) was different than what I would expect as it resembled more of a French toast sandwich with turkey, big thick ham slice and cheese in between two pieces of French toast rather than a sandwich dipped in French toast batter and grilled. Still good though with the warm syrup they serve in a ""pour yourself"" glass bottle brought to the table. 

We will go back so we can try what looked like some awesome pancakes, especially the ones with banana, pecans and coconut. That warm syrup calls my name. 

One star was lost though because of the number of people who today just let their kids run wild around the tables in what is a pretty small place.

The restaurant is a little small but still fits a good amount of people. Luckily when we got there, seating was still available. It did pick up as the meal went, though, so I'm glad we got there when we did!

The menu offers a wide variety of food, and I wanted to try everything! I ultimately decided on the Gatsby burger, which had onion strings, bacon, lettuce, BBQ sauce, mayo, cheese, and a sunny side up egg served with a side of fries. Everything tastes delicious! I was quite impressed with how well the burger was cooked and how the flavors felt fresh. The burger was a bit messy with the sauce and egg running down the burger but I knew what I was getting in to!

The wait staff friendly and accommodating. I didn't feel like we had to wait long for assistance and they consistently replenished our drinks without us having to ask. 

All in all, a very wonderful experience and it's a restaurant I will be visiting again soon!",mhxJ6RPdWecL-bpoum2Gtw,0,0,5,qykxH2H-g9zpCbrPcGt7Xg

Stopped in for a late breakfast with my mom and Cesar Q.  The restaurant was rather busy and there were only 2 waiters.  They did an excellent job and we never had to wait.  Our drinks were constantly filled, didn't have to ask!  That's a huge plus.  Our meals came out quickly and were nicely plated!

I really enjoyed what I ordered.  I had the chilaquilles with chicken and scrambled eggs.  Portions are huge!  You could sooooo split here.  My meal was in a word, awesome!  My mom had the tuna with a side salad.  She said it was ok just to many raw onions.  The hubs opted for the monte cristo and he loved it!  Served with warm maple syrup!  Sweet!

Location is great as it's just off the 215 at Flamingo.  Just go west on flamingo and take a turn into the Tagrget shopping center.  Plenty of open parking which makes for an easy in and out.  Will definitely be back to try some more of their yummy food",9KCoXFS7alSJsGfFsZANFQ,6,5,4,-h20g_h8IVoeWQyUwslSDg

My girlfriend and I waited over 15 minutes for somebody to take our drink orders. Once we ordered our food we waited over 40 minutes. I ordered Egg Florentine and my girlfriend ordered a skillet. They forgot my girlfriend's toast and it took her another 10 minutes to get it. The table next to us received there food after us and they said they had been there 20 minutes before us. I'm not sure if this place was just understaffed for the holiday but the service was horrible.

At one point I noticed there was a massive line at the front of at least 6 different groups. I counted the empty tables, and there were 6 totally clean empty tables. About 3 groups left because they were not seated.


I was disappointed by the way the place looked inside. It looks like a high school cafeteria inside, the tables and chairs look cheap. Not a huge deal but I had a different impression of the place reading reviews and passing by.

BITE'S ULTIMATE PANCAKES - Fresh egg surrounded by our buttermilk pancake batter filled with bacon and sausage pieces
MONTE CRISTO FRENCH TOAST - Turkey, ham fried egg & Swiss cheese
FUNFETTI PANCAKES - Cake batter with rainbow sprinkles and topped with yogurt (...or not, bro)

BANANA NUT FRENCH TOAST - Homemade banana nut bread dipped into our French toast egg batter, grilled and topped with sliced bananas

Replacing the shuttered Sun City Café, Bite quickly garnered attention when I discovered it was less than ten minutes from home and giving the restaurant a few weeks to get its footing before paying a visit with three friends the simple conclusion is that either they still haven't figured it out, or perhaps that they never will.

Located in a strip mall, pretty standard for Las Vegas, Bite is the invention of Chef Andrey Ariza and having personally contacted the restaurant weeks prior to find the website and menu (and subsequently linking it to their urbanspoon, yelp, and foursquare accounts) the first tip-off regarding customer service occurred when their online question form went unanswered and finding similarly disinterested staff located in store suffice it to say that those who drink their coffee quickly should sit close enough to the back of the restaurant to fill their own - the bottomless cup of $2.85 brew admittedly good, though the temperature could have stood to be turned up a few degrees.

Pleasantly decorated for Christmas, with a small kitchen and at least three line cooks manning the fryers and grills, it was with football in the background that an order was placed and requesting the food in two rounds the items rolled out at a good pace - the mistaken substitution of pancakes for French Toast one flaw, while the 'funfetti' stack was served without yogurt as though no one would notice - a later excuse of ""we just replaced it with butter, ""sorry 'bout that bro"" apparently felt to be service-recovery enough.

Speaking to the quality of the food, much like the rest of Bite it was a bit of a mixed bag, the first round of savories honestly proving superior to the second set of sweets with the Monte Cristo fairly well constructed despite being unfried while the ""Ultimate"" was interesting if only for the runny eggs at the center, though this also contributed to a substantial degree of sogginess when taking into account the somewhat greasy sausage, the Beer Cakes surprisingly my favorite plate with light hoppiness and a crispy griddled layer overlying a fluffy center that paired nicely with smoky bacon.

Transitioning to more childish delicacies after a bit of respite, and a couple of trips to the coffee machine as the restaurant began to fill, 09:10:11 on 12/13/14 arrived just after unordered banana pancakes and funfetti pancakes lacking the menu-promised yogurt arrived and returning the first while settling for flavors no different than average white bread in the other it was in the crispy chocolate waffle and a single $3 mint flapjack that we indulged, both decent but nothing to write home about, while the late arriving Banana Nut French Toast was admittedly quite good, a crispy topcoat overlying a pudding like center with plenty of bananas made all the better by a drizzle of warm maple syrup.

Stunningly unapologetic for serving items without the toppings promised on the menu and mostly underwhelming in their execution of plates that sound far more interesting than they taste one of my dining companions summed Bite up best when she said that it seemed they were trying to capitalize on the success of BabyStacks, but with four of them already populating a valley with plenty of competition from EggWorks, The Cracked Egg, Blueberry Hill, Hash House, and so many others that offer a better overall experience I'm not really sure Bite offers any good reason to go back.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,5,2,I_P2DnO2-ulfNxIa_6l3Rw

I was visiting my folks and had to run a few errands when starvation hit me like Mack Truck! I pulled over and did a search for a good breakfast place near me. Bite Breakfast & Lunch came up as a good option and it had plenty of good reviews, so I found the mall it was in, but when I parked my car I almost missed them because at the time they were doing some construction in their main dining area and the place looked as if it was closed! Fortunately after walking back and forth a couple of times, I figured it out and got in. 

Folks, the service was excellent. I was greeted by a young man who ended up being my server and another young man who seemed to be manager on the day. They both were very pleasant, I quickly got a table and my coffee mug was filled with steaming coffee. I am not going to go into the details of the dining area because it will most likely be changed by the time you read this, but it was clean, quiet and well setup. The place was half full, so it was not as if I was the only one desiring a late breakfast! My order was taken quickly and shortly after my food was in front of me. 

I had my breakfast and it was done exactly the way I want it. My server and the manager checked on me (and others) a few times to make sure everything was alright. Altogether good food and great service. I will stop by there again for sure.",ZNPI9K-JufHOs0wXkDv0HQ,2,2,4,sI92pA9m88zpnRNlSKMitA

However, we had to wait 15+ (I stopped counting after fifteen) to put our breakfast order in. I saw our server cleaning tables, mind you nobody was waiting for a table, and taking other orders before ours. A small grievance, as the pancakes were delicious and more than made up for the service. 

A personal note, while I enjoy some sweets and Nutella, I would have preferred the Nutella drizzle on the side. The pancakes can definitely stand on their own.

5561649,2015-11-03,0,ZOmf-3NN4Z59b2Fw6VAM7g,"We had high hopes for Bite.  Great reviews and hunger-fueling food photos.  Unfortunately, it fell short of our expectations.  We've only been there once, so perhaps we came on an off day. 

Here's what we ordered:
Chilaquiles w/ steak - $14
Unfortunately, the ranchero chips were completely soggy and chewy (which I hope wasn't by design).  Normally the crunch of the chips adds a nice texture to this dish.  The flavors were bland.  The steak was chopped up into tiny bite-size pieces that didn't look all that appetizing.  There just wasn't a lot of cohesion on the plate - it just felt thrown together.  I added a good amount of Chalula for some much needed flavor.  

Bite's Signature Stuffed Breakfast Steak - $15
It's an interesting idea that sounded tasty, but the rolled up piece of steak was a little overcooked and visually disappointed upon arrival to the table. The steak was seasoned well, which helped, but it was dry.  The flavors reminded me of a steak fajita with an egg.  The potatoes (I think they were the seasoned potatoes) were a little stale, as if they were originally frozen.  The idea to roll a steak with other breakfast ingredients just didn't work for us. 

Mint Chip Pancakes - $3.99 for a single 
Everything on this pancake worked well except that it was overcooked (borderline burnt) on the bottom.  Other than that, you can't go wrong with chocolate fudge, whipped cream on top of a fluffy pancake.  Had it been cooked properly, this would've been a delicious dessert pancake. 

French Press Coffee - $4
This coffee was great.  It was full-bodied and had great flavor.  Def. recommend.  

Cold-Pressed Apple Juice - MP
I don't know if the juice was cold-pressed or freshly squeezed, but it was good.  Not too sweet, just tasted really fresh and natural.  We were hoping to try the Apple/Lemon/Ginger combo, but they had run out.  

Service wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't great either.  Everyone was very friendly, which I appreciate, however, we got the sense that the servers didn't know the menu inside and out.  Several answers to our questions about ingredients started with ""I think it's..."" or ""Let me ask the kitchen.."" It was also tough to get an answer on the cost of the cold-pressed juice, since the menu just lists ""market price"" and the server didn't remember. 

Unfortunately, since all three dishes disappointed, we likely won't be back.",w_1Iqe8mGdofBIeY9Y0V0Q,1,0,3,JwicmAgoIn5ExPilprqe5Q

The eggs and the sauces were perfectly done, and the chipotle hollandaise that I subbed on to my San Diego Benedict was absolutely perfectly spiced and creamy. 

The wet burritos were massive and very tasty, though I was of the opinion they had too many potatoes. We also tried some of the mimosas, and found them pleasantly light and refreshing and not syrupy sweet.

I ordered the monte cristo benedict sandwich. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the ham and turkey were very fresh. I ordered fruit instead of potatoes and the fruit was actually worth the extra charge having lots of strawberries and pineapples. It came with maple syrup on the side and the french toast base was well cooked. The only problem was the hollandaise sauce. I'm not even sure if that was what it was supposed to be because it tasted a bit like a burned bechamel sauce. I don't know if maybe the chef was having a bad sauce day. I appreciate that they put it on the side instead of ruining the dish with it, but I think I would have just said they ran out of hollandaise. I also ordered an orange juice which was AMAZING.

We arrived around 11ish and the place was super busy. We were acknowledged when came through the door but had to wait just a few minutes to be seated. First impression was simple, laid back decor. Nothing fancy but playing some awesome reggae tunes. The menu is interesting enough and I decided on the Huevos Rancheros to split with the hubby. Our server sold me on enjoying a fresh, mouth watering pineapple juice. My daughter had the apple juice. The juices are all freshly made and just phenomenal to drink. They are a little pricey but I don't mind paying when it's fresh. My daughter ordered the Funfetti Pancakes. Our service was good not great. The problem was there was only one server being supported by two bus people. Appears to be family owned so this may be the reason why only one server or somebody called off work. Anyway, our server could have used some help but he did hustle and made sure to check on every table.

The food arrived and did not disappoint. The Huevos Rancheros were hot, eggs tasted fresh, the chicken added extra flavor and the sauce was tasty.

Walked in on Saturday 6-11-16 at 9am and we had the place all to ourselves except for one other table that was wrapping up their meal.  We were sat at a table with a clean top but it had dirty seats.  I brushed the long black hair and scrambled eggs onto the floor and took a seat.  

$27.58 got us a breakfast wrap and a pancake combo.  Service was very attentive and friendly.  It was almost unbearable at times as I was tired of looking up and saying ""we're doing great, thanks"" after about the 9th time. 

Hubs got the $7 Moe's wrap which was a flour tortilla filled with egg whites, avocado, bacon and cheddar cheese.  It came with a salsa on the side and for $3 extra he added ""seasoned potatoes"" although they were completely devoid of any seasoning, not even salt.  At least they were hot and cooked all the way through.  

I got the peanut butter banana french toast and added eggs and bacon on the side.  The bacon was room temp. but that doesn't bother me.  The scrambled eggs were still really runny on the top which I hate.  The french toast was not soaked long enough and was just *barely* cooked.  I only made it a few bites in before I gave up.  I liked that the syrup was served warm.  

I'd say go here for their zany pancake flavors (funfetti, mint choco chip, etc.) or their fresh pressed juices. Service is cloyingly nice but food and ambiance does not deliver.  I left hungry and sad.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,12,7,2,dilJRanQo8OCB0YiaMilyA

I tried the Bite's Ultimate Pancake and ""yes"" it was ultimate. It comes served with four (or was it five) fluffy buttermilk pancakes and within the pancakes are a few over-medium eggs. Just that alone was good, but then they fill the pancakes with bits of bacon and sausage. My goodness. Not one thing wrong with this calorie monster. Must order.

We also tried their signature stuffed breakfast steak. You guessed it. Instead of the boring tortilla wrap, your wrap is wrapped with a steak (which by the way was cooked perfectly at medium). For the topping, we tried four cheeses. Other choices were egg and chorizo, egg and bacon, and some others. This unique breakfast dish worked so well. The four cheeses were adequately melted and surrounded by a juicy medium-cooked steak. I think you get the picture. Just try it.

Also ordered the Loco Moco and BLT sandwich. The BLT was standard fare, but the Loco Moco was interesting. It's served with a pork belly patty along with the usual mushroom gravy sauce and eggs. For me, it tasted a bit too fancy. I prefer the Loco Moco at Island Flavor. If you do however have a craving for Loco Moco and you happen to be here, it's a solid choice. I suppose it's Loco Moco, but elevated.

The coffee and the cold-pressed juice were both good. Coffee tasted fresh and the cold-pressed juice (although a bit pricey) helped put to ease all that crazy goodness we put in our bodies. 

Parking is a breeze as Bite is located in a large shopping plaza. Enjoy!",LniV8mGWGuWLoJ96dhNVIw,4,2,5,GuXxvcBHHLxjtirAwj2DdA

It's strange, I know.  The first time I ate here, I came at lunch time (a meal time I love) and had a delicious salad!  My daughter ordered the strawberry pancakes.  Now, I haven't had a pancake in about 3 years but for some reason I was tempted to take a bite of hers.  Before she knew it, her pancake was gone!!!  OMG, it was amazing!!  So of course my first thought is ""Lea, you haven't had pancakes in 3 years so that's probably why it's so good"" so my second thought is now I have to try more pancakes...I did and they just weren't as good or even close to as good!  The strawberry pancakes here are AHHHHMAZING!!!  I've brought my husband now twice for breakfast (he is a man that can't go a day without breakfast) and he LOVES this place!!

Anyways, we came back today cause my husband wanted to eat here and the food was horrible! My husband had the steak and eggs and the steak was super dry. My side of bacon was also super dry. I couldn't even cut it with my husband's steak knife. They were also out of a bunch of menu options. Truly disappointed that we spent $82 on three people for such a nasty breakfast. What a horrible way to start the day... But anyways on the plus side the restrooms were clean and the waiter was nice.",-kRQLEDxrEBVNXImyAt_ug,0,0,2,qeQLqvZJgclJG1v9v70nlw

I have been there twice now with my family members. Both times they were out of something. First time was OJ and I forgot what else and the other was steaks. The time with steaks we went on a Monday morning so I'm assuming they were out due to a busy weekend.... however, the staff is very very nice and respectful, the service is great until they get a little busy then it's not horrible but not the best. We have gotten 3 desperate items there witch all here amazing .. 1st the omelette with spinach and egg whites and sausage, Then the French toast sampler, the regular friends toast and the churro French toast (amazing)!!! For parents I am not sure if they have changing areas for little ones (we didn't use the restroom) .... bottom line .. the food is great but next time try and go in the middle of the week so their stock is back up and also.

Perfect addition to any breakfast. The beach day mimosa is my favorite. There's literally something here for everyone. From stuffed steaks to Drey's corned beef hash is like no other. If you're really hungry I suggest the french toast platter. Finish it off with a fresh handcrafted cappuccino. Haven't tried lunch yet but I'm sure it's just as amazing. Highly recommended.

We were quickly greeted and seated. Which is always a good sign for great service, the waiter was super friendly and attentive and knowledgeable.

My hubby ordered the stuff Steak!  All the food came out delicious although I ordered my son the pancakes, which he didn't mind sharing with me. Which was yummy  and if he loved it, especially the whip cream.  I might be ordering that next time just for me. 
I highly recommend this place the breakfast options are great, portion sizes are great and the quality is definitely worth the trip. The flavors are great and the staff are super friendly.

I was there today and the food was disgusting I can't believe this was the same place that I use to love my friend had the turkey sausage patties they were the two smallest patties I've ever seen I thought it was a joke.  Also he got 3 1/2 slices of bread as his toast.  Not even two pieces of bread?  I had steak and eggs the steak was like a leather and a side of fruit salad which they had sliced oranges in with the peal on? with strawberries and bananas?  My scrambled eggs tasted like they sat under a heat lamp for 10 minutes.  For $35 for breakfast for two and we both left hungry it's not good.

I actually wanted to try Rise & Shine, which recently opened up across the street, but unfortunately the wait was 45 minutes. Opened up the Yelp app, and saw that Bite had good reviews, so we decided to give it a try.

When we got there, they were pretty busy. But there were a few tables open, so we were seated right away. The first thing that one of the servers suggested to us was to try their freshly squeezed juices made daily. We both got OJ, which was pretty good. Nice change from the one that we usually buy at the grocery store. I ordered the Monte Cristo, which was a big mistake. The french toast was dry and a little too thick for my liking. Even after pouring a good amount of syrup on top, it still didn't taste good. I took three bites with the french toast, then I was over it. I pushed the toast to the side and was eating the ham and cheese by itself at that point. My husband ordered the Ultimate Pancake and said that it was good. 

Customer service was friendly and attentive. What I did notice is that the staff here isn't really assigned to certain tables. They walk around helping all guests in the restaurant. I think everyone that was working that morning each stopped by our table at some point. 

I am willing to give it another try in the future. Service was great and sometimes I just order the wrong dish. Three stars for now.....

My French toast was alright the syrup came in a cool bottle, but that wasn't enough to make worth coming back. And lastly we had the kale juice drink which was bitter and over priced.
