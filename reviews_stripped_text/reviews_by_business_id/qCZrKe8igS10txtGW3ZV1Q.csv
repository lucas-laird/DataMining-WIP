On a 9 a.m. visit, the first thing I noticed was that this shop offers soups, sandwiches, and salads.  I wasn't in the mood for typical breakfast items. I asked the attendant whether they were serving sandwiches.  I even pointed to sandwiches on the menu.  No, he replied, only breakfast items (bacon, sausage, or ham and egg croissants or bagels).

You can't nuke a croissant.  My $4 croissant was no better than a cheap Jimmy Dean frozen sausage croissant from the grocery store. It came with coffee that was nothing special. I pumped the coffee from dispensers that ran dry.  You get better coffee from 7-Eleven.

I noticed servers standing around the soup and salad area.  Out of curiosity, I asked if they were serving soup and sandwiches.  Yes, they serve soup, salad, and sandwiches all day.

I asked the attendant who helped me at first.  ""I thought you said you weren't serving sandwiches.""
   ""Oh no.  We serve them all day!""

What can you do?  I spoke English and apparently he understood it.  What went wrong is anyone's guess.  My first experience here was highly negative.  It's a nice shop, however.  The attendant was friendly and pleasant. Maybe the misunderstanding was somehow all my fault.

Rather than buy anything here, pick up a cheap breakfast sandwich at the nearby Terrible's convenience store. 

Or, take your chances on their soups, sandwiches, and salads. There are pretty pictures all around the shop that make the offerings look tasty.",PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,0,0,1,pwh3O9g524fxsi9tfg9Hrg
