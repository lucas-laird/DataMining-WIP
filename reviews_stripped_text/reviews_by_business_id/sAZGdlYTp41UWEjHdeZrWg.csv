1180744,2017-11-26,2,sAZGdlYTp41UWEjHdeZrWg,"A sandwich place is just a sandwich place, right? How much can they vary? Bread, check. Stuff that goes on bread, check. Drinks to go with the sandwiches, check. 

Fine. But these sandwiches are REALLY good, okay? ""Counter-culture"" affiliation aside, these people make some really damn good food in this shop. I had the Kali Mist which is their version of the Club and the first thing I thought was, ""RIP lipstick"" when they brought it out. Just the right amount of turkey (I really hate when there's too much turkey on a sandwich. It's a thing) and chipotle mayo. The only thing I would have changed is the bacon to a thick cut but that's being nitpicky.

My husband, the vegetarian, had the Humboldt and it seemed like I blinked and he finished it. Safe to say he enjoyed it as well. Oh, and we started with the pretzels and honey mustard, at the recommendation of the super nice guy who took our order. I would go back just for those. 

Let's talk about the iced tea. I'm really picky about my iced tea. Ignore the plain one and go straight to the flavored one. You don't even need to add a lot of sugar to it. I would also go back just for the tea, if we're being honest here. And why wouldn't I be? 

So yeah, even if you're not into the theme, go here for the food and the very friendly service. You won't regret it!

UPDATE: My husband liked it so much he went back the NEXT DAY for lunch. Seriously, that good.",xDGHlxXxXg7GZI048lmo0Q,3,3,5,ISoNxHyp2Or7w6nJzdvqlQ

Feels like a beach bar somewhere on the Southern California coast. Great sandwiches, and a very cool vibe.

The Kali Mist is my current fave, with chicken, bacon, and LOADS of veggies. Get it on a grilled garlic bun for a killer meal.

If you're lucky enough to get Mondo as your bartender, you'll be well cared for. Great guy. Super friendly and fun.

Yes, the theme is ""marijuana"" - but don't let that stop you if you don't partake.

I was pretty excited to try the sandwich.  I was disappointed with the sandwich.  It contained very little guacamole and so the sandwich was very dry. I was not very impressed w the food.  I don't recommend this sandwich

1617474,2017-10-03,14,sAZGdlYTp41UWEjHdeZrWg,"Cheba Hut is a stoner-friendly sandwich shop from Arizona, now premiering their first Vegas valley location at Sahara and Rainbow. You don't have to get toasted to enjoy your meal, but there are multiple dispensaries in the same plaza. Staff are friendly and outgoing, making multiple recommendations and walking visitors through the menu (including sandwich sizes). Surprisingly, they also have an indoor/outdoor bar featuring unique and local brews. 

Aside from the cannabis-influenced decor and sandwich names, CH is known for their baked goods (get it?): their bread is ""legendary"" and they stock ""munchies"" at the register including rice crispies (in Captain Crunch and Fruity Pebble flavors) and various other sweet, snacky treats. Their garlic herb (heh) bread is pretty solid and pairs well with their Apollo 13 sando, with Greek flavors of grilled chicken, spring mix, salad dressing, cucumbers, tomato, red onion, and feta. I'd add some other melty cheese to this in the future. For bonus points, they have several vegetarian sandwiches!

I'm not the hugest fan of their open-face serving, the sandwiches seem to have less toppings than other places, but the prices are fair for the portion.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,25,19,4,yXOP7RmCFfYeIpvMCRB0JQ

Conveniently located next to a recreational dispensary and medical marijuana licensing facility, Cheba Hut is the best place in Las Vegas to ""get toasted"" (off their famous toasted subs). I'm from San Diego and although the original location is in Tempe, AZ, I've been hooked ever since I've had their delicious sandwiches on their fresh baked bread in Mission Beach (go for the garlic). The strain friendly sandwich names such as AK-47 (French Dip) and White Widow (Chicken Ranch) in combination with the cannabis related decor make ordering a unique and fun experience for all who enter into this welcoming atmosphere. 

I was pleased to see this location features an indoor/outdoor bar with plenty of seating serving a variety of craft beers and specialty drinks. They offer a variety of ""munchies"" to cure any appetite whether it be sweet or savory. One of my favorite aspects that is unique to Cheba Hut is the variety of flavors of Kool-Aid they offer along with their fountain drinks and iced tea.

Not to mention all the extras the average sandwich shop doesn't offer. Koolaid, alcohol, a unique decor, a great music selection, and the best staff I've encountered in quite a while! 
The sandwich names refer to tons of marijuana references. From strains, the the size of the sandwich, you're bound to get a kick out of the menu!
Also, they'll make you feel just as welcome even if you're a non smoking business man in a suit!

I have tried many subs including the: Acapulco Gold, White Widow, G-13 and the 5-0. All of them were excellent but out of all of them, I suggest getting the G-13 as the chipotle mayo in that sandwich off the chain! The crunch of the sub when you bite into it is what gets you. Combine that with their meats and fresh veggies and you'll be in sandwich utopia in no time!

You order at the counter from one of their super high super friendly staff and they bring out your food when it's ready.  They give you a hip table sign stand instead of the traditional number system found in other restaurants to place on your table. The sandwich sizes are a Pinner, Dube and a Blunt instead of small, medium and large.  All the menus items are named after a strain of cannibis making it super funny when ordering. For example I had the Kali Mist Blunt.  It's an incredible chicken sandwich with tons of toppings to choose from.  I ordered mine with no jalape√±os or onion.  It's was delicious!  I like the one size drink glass and the ice tea, soda and water machines are pure your own so you can try a couple of things or get refills.  It's the only place I know that has grape punch.  So, so, so evil bad but so, so, so yummy good!  Ok and the desserts are holy frigin bat balls to die for!!!

The art on the wall and the vibe with the staff will help peice your mind back together and make for a fun, positive environment. Perfect place to grab some food and or a drink and soak up the ambience.  It's located on south Rainbow in the same shopping place as The Souce Dispensary.  Coincidence?  I think not!

I got the Kali Mist which is a California turkey club and I go it with a garlic toasted roll. So damn good! 
I was very pleased with it not only in flavor but if these guys consistently have fresh delicious rolls like I had tonight, I will keep coming back. 

Only thing I will say, as a personal preference that is, the cheese tasted excellent but it was a little much cheese for me and that doesn't say much. I don't like as much cheese as most people do so take that with a grain of salt. I think most people who love California clubs would absolutely love this with the garlic toasted roll I got. 
So go here toasty or sober as a bird! You'll love it either way if every night is like my experience this evening.

The key to this place's sandwiches are the toasted buns--the kind that rough up the roof of your mouth a little bit, but are SOOOOO worth it. 

PRO TIP: Regardless of what you get, order an extra of whatever sauce goes on the sandwich, just so you can add that little bit of extra wet goodness to your 'wich.

Also, don't let the surrounding marijuana dispensaries scare you off. This place is just fine for the family.

This place screams awesome. Where else can you go eat good food, drink beer and then when you leave go to the dispensary that's right next door and get some recreational pot! 

Other than everything around the place cheba hut is actually pretty damn cool! And not just because of the decoration and vibes.
This place actually makes amazing sandwiches and has awesome customer service.
The menu is something new and totally different than your average subway or port of subs even kinda blows fire house subs away. Way away. Lol. 
The bread stays nice and toasty and holds up even if you have to take them to go the bread doesn't get soggy like mostly every other sandwich place.

They also have a couple of their own custom signature items on the menu I guess every cheba hut location has something diff that's specifically  from the  chef at that location. Not all secret menu items are the same at every location so if this cheba hut has something on their signature menu get it because you probably will NOT be able to get it at any other cheba hut. 

All their sandwiches have meat or Multiple types of meats on them that's why it is so cool they have about 3-4 diff veggie sandwiches  they also have salads and sides. Their pretzel bites are pretty bitchin so I'd give those a try if I were you!

Overall the place is very clean well organized and easy to find. 
Parking can kinda be a bitch sometimes but well worth it. Located behind the seven eleven on Sahara and rainbow.
Check this place out the sandwiches are def diff than most sandwich places",WAb5zPq711dVH7GzxZpLNw,0,0,5,8s5Ft0EIy0mtQk_L8KlUuw

I'm pregnant, so I decided to treat myself and add the pretzels again. I was able to used $10 off on grubhub since it was the first time I ordered (that was neat) the order came 10 mins earlier than scheduled. Everything was sooooooo good. I ordered the veggie sammie with no swiss (I don't eat cheese). It came with hummus, sprouts, cucumber, red onion, and I don't remember what else but OMG it was so good.
