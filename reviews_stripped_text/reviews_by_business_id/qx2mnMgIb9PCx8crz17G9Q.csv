I make about 2 visits a week, because why not? Foods amazing and always fresh, the owner is super friendly they always know my order by the time I make it to the window, and the service is quick. From a self-proclaimed taco enthusiast, I HIGHLY recommend their carne asada !",zWYk2WqB5VZCtEApsW0nvg,0,0,5,CLCZUW_YPYg1AeCCzU_p_g
