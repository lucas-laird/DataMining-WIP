346072,2012-05-31,4,-tseCGdDvepLP8IIWtZikQ,"With my husband being of Polish descent and me being a huge pierogi fan, I felt it was necessary to make a stop here when we were driving by the other day.

Do you like beets?  If you do, then get over here and find every kind of canned and frozen beet product imaginable.

Other than the numerous beet products, I also found: candy, beverages, chocolates, a case of meats, and even some corn-curl type things with a scary rabbit mascot on the front of the bag.

Oh, and there was Polish TV on which I thought was fun.

Unfortunately, I couldn't eat most of the stuff here (that's Polish food in general though).  And more unfortunately, I was expecting some homemade super fresh pierogi, but instead was pointed to the freezer section.  I bought some anyway thinking that maybe they were something special but was disappointed again.  Instead of having a lot of potato like I'm used to, they were filled with lots of ricotta-ish cheese that I wasn't too fond of.

If you like sausages and such, be sure to make a stop here.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,7,3,3,tObiTGj6v2_gHAhDmC0nrw

Most Polish restaurants/delis have gone out of business/moved and have been replaced with Mexican restaurants (as if the city was severely lacking Mexican cuisine). This place is in the middle of town but I am thankful everyday that it exists. This sklep is small and the owners seem to prefer those who are American to Polacy.They have Polish baking flour, an assortment of pickled goods such as kapusta,  pre-made soups (barszcz,  bigos) farmers cheese, frozen pierogi (although these are incomparable to homemade) Tymbark juices, teas, rye bread, spicy ketchup, mustards, sweets(Wawel and E. Wedel chocolates!), etc.. Behind the deli counter they have an assortment of kielbasa and cheese. When I'm lucky I am able to find Almette Smietankowy (yogurt spread).

I used to stop by Polish Deli regularly.  Then, I got lazy, and ended up just going to Euro Delicacies because it was closer to my house.  In the interim, however, Euro Delicacies has surpassed them with selection of Polish goods.  Polish Deli still has the biggest selection of pierogi and Polish meats in town, but that's not saying much.
 
You can also pick up Polish teas, over-the-counter drugs, and Wedel chocolates, something I haven't seen elsewhere in town (which are in the refrigerators because it's like 90 degrees in the store).  I'll still stop by for my blueberry pierogi and kapusta czerwona (red cabbage salad) but, then again, maybe I won't.  Seriously depressing.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,8,3,2,1RXUWCh0ErQLYj5y2Txvfg

I was in the area and having seen this on Yelp, I knew that I would need to stop by and check it out.

It is very awkward being expected to know Polish things and always having to fake it when someone asks you something!

I had hopes that this establishment would offer a culture smack down thus supercharging my thirst to learn Polish things.

I wondered around the store confused and attempted to take it in.  For some strange reason I thought I would be able to get a sandwich at a deli?  My small town Southern Californian naivet√© once agains has gotten the better of me!

After settling on a two litter bottle of ""Oranzada"" a Polish soda, I walked up to make my purchase.  I thought I would be able to make some small talk with the clerk as I made a way along to the road to a higher Polish education.

With the formalities taken care of at the cache register, I proceeded to ask how long the shop had been there for.  ""9 years"" was what I was told as the clerk turned their back on me and walked away.

That was that and this is that and so I guess I will have to continue playing off all questions about my heritage while hidden under a cloak of uneducated deception.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,7,3,1,O-TUttEvaGKL5jann5qg-Q

1993574,2014-01-23,7,-tseCGdDvepLP8IIWtZikQ,"With the Jones Market being just a hop, skip, and jump away, I'm not entirely sure how this place stays in business. I mistakenly thought the name ""Deli"" indicated that they made sandwiches, but sadly they only sell the components to make sandwiches yourself. Not a big deal on it's own.

But nearly all of their merchandize is identical to what you can find at Jones Market, and often at a better price. Plus JM has way more selection, as well as ready-made foods. 

This small store reminds me of the ""Russian store"" offered in San Antonio- very limited, with a  big part of the appeal being the frozen pirogies. The store is clean, organized, and well-lit. But again, the merchandize can be found elsewhere- even the frozen pirogies can be found at Sprouts, same brand, too, though not quite so many varieties/flavors.

There may be a small thing or two this store has that others do not- a specific variety of jam, or maybe a particular brand, but by and large this store does not seem to have anything unique to offer.

Even after reading reviews here, I was a little underwhelmed- and browsing their meat case, it was unclear which of their sausages was the ""amazing polish sausage"". Might come back because it's so close, but will likely continue patronizing JM as it's only a mile or so down the road.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,1,2,VMjssihbnUhPAXFM7cJiXg

There is a nice selection of Polish sausages on the counter behind.  I need to stop back and get some of their kielbasa.  It looks so much better than the stuff you see in grocery stores.

Service was pleasant and quick.  The shop is small and questions are answered very politely.
