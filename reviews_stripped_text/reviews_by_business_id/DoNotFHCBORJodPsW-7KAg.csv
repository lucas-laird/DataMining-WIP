I went there 2 days ago. Because I really like Teppanyaki.
But I got a huge disappointment from this store. Just TOO EXPENSIVE !
I ordered the Hamada special which was the most expensive one from the menu.
But the meat was hard chewy and the shrimp was small and not tasty. 
The teppanyaki chef wasn't. that great either. 
There was some Japanese tourists and they all looked like "" hate it "" .
Do not go this place !",4UqRnaoR6S-JGr9NKsYnNg,0,0,1,QsP4F6jHStPWRC1cr2D6AA

All you Can Eat?!? That's what they said but is that what they did? I give stars for the miso soup and the rolls. It was pretty decent. A wide range of nigiri and rolls thats was satisfying. 

BUT here's the thing. They give you one hour to eat and when they feel you're eating too much, well they make you wait for your next order until your time is up. 

We kept asking the lady about our order and apparently I guess we were ordering too much and so on our ""last"" order we waited 20 minutes and when she came back with it she stated we can't order anymore because time has been up. WHAT? SCANDALOUS! 20 minutes for sushi? The funny thing about it was that was our smallest order that only had 3 orders of nigiri and 2 order of rolls. So sad..So sad..

$29 for 40 minutes..Not an hour!",sLIn9oBM0aw9q2R9G1oCew,6,5,2,oHJ02286SuDXTf1JahqTsw

Waited over 45 min for them to take order from around the table. Salad came before the soup. The grill chef had a personality of the grill top it's self and I have seen a better show of reruns of Godzilla. 

Where it gets better (i DO NOT THINK SO) was I made the vital mistake of ordering a order of yellow tail and salmon sushi. Man did I get sick the last two days so bad that I could not travel back home this past Wednesday as I was scheduled and barley made it yesterday. 

Stay VERY FAR AWAY from this place and the chain.",QeT2GXQH1iqZ7p1UioDPDg,0,0,1,W49O-83pyXuT5DWc4aqAJA
3787718,2007-08-07,1,DoNotFHCBORJodPsW-7KAg,"Let me persuade you to eat here with 4 simple words: ALL YOU CAN EAT.  If you've read my other reviews, you'd know that I'm a glutton and I love all you can eat.  Hamada offers all you can eat on the menu for $29.

All you can eat includes your choice of rolls, nigiri, salad, soups, and a few very tasty entrees such as lemon chicken and mongolian beef.  The $29 price is pretty good considering the a-la-carte price of most of the nigiri was well above $5.  

A quick heads up: never have I been served nigiri with a dollop of wasabi in between the fish and rice until I ate here.  I thought I had overloaded my soy sauce with wasabi because it was very strong with every serving, until I found the culprit.  If you don't like wasabi or prefer add it on yourself like me, ask for your nigiri without wasabi.

The service was ok and the craftmanship of the sushi was poor, but the flavors were pretty good.  This place is worth a visit in if you're at the Rio.  Try the super white tuna, you'll thank me later.",8Xc8XcEItk6zW5ra3E7lLw,0,0,4,BpiZWG2OCsxhPttKUU9Nvw

The decor in the restaurant is a big plus. 2 huge fish tank on each side at the entrance and bamboo garden in the dinning area, very impressive. The price is a bit high, but you pay for what you have. The cooking method is very traditional, the tempura is the best I ever had.",dTI2uwmsAyR22CjhzQcHZw,1,1,4,AX0XmVetOBaTHxBzPBO1cw
