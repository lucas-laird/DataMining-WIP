1382116,2015-07-11,0,lYCeqldIiOggsbByH3RRhw,"Not really sure how other people came to their reviews.  I come from New York and I absolutely love this pizza.  It's expensive, yes, almost $6 for a veggie slice, which is definitely overpriced, but the flavor is fantastic.  What's cheap at the airport anyway that's half decent?  Here you can get a good slice and you have seating right outside.  The crust is medium thickness, the amount of cheese is nice.  All in all, I love this pizza, would love to come back if I ever come to this terminal at Vegas' airport.",a1_ptLh8A6ym8Qr45RyGmQ,1,1,5,lNyORQKdeFSjt8ZWRUuyiA
1559540,2016-09-05,4,lYCeqldIiOggsbByH3RRhw,"I like the Metro brand, but I think they need to stick to full service restaurants and drop their counter concepts (here and Ellis Island)-- product and service are subpar, can't even compare them to the great pies available when you go to their actual restaurants. Minimal slices ready and available, disinterested service. Pizza itself was just okay, comparable to any other airport pizza place.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,8,3,lEYm2UpipyZWfhrtxJBtJQ

I got a slice of the stuffed pizza, I think it was about $7.50. It's stuffed with mushrooms, sausage, and pepperoni, and was delicious. 

No line too so it didn't take long to receive my order. Metro Pizza is located in the Delta terminal (terminal D) near the end of the terminal.",rr5zzVWVu0u-P5P1rHIV-Q,4,2,4,EV2IQc0g_aFfm1Hv0qrIVg

2318434,2018-01-07,0,lYCeqldIiOggsbByH3RRhw,"The best thing about metro pizza is that they are always open when I'm rushing back to the airport.  I usually am super hungry once I get to the gate in Vegas and metro pizza delivers my cure to my hunger. This time, at 1 am, on New Years morning, they delivered again. They had equivalent of one full pizza, about 6 large slices and a few pizzas in the oven. I chose the 2 pieces of Bbq chicken pizza. It was little over cooked so the crust was really crispy and made my jaw little sore. But the taste was good and it satisfied my hunger. Another thing I liked was the manager got a customer who was allergic to pork and he made a whole vegetable pizza for him from scratch so the guy could eat something. I thought that was really cool especially when they were trying to close.",X7VPEwa0BPErmVZiAVSOEA,3,0,4,p-MxqXXtosbJ5AIc0LP0Xg

4274889,2015-01-13,9,lYCeqldIiOggsbByH3RRhw,"This pizza was A-OK. You could do a lot worse for a quick bite at the airport.

It wasn't that quick though. They had one old slice of plain left when I arrived, with several people waiting around to get a slice of whatever pies were coming out next.

After about 10 minutes, a pepperoni pie finally emerged and I got my hands on one of the super oily slices ($5). As I stood there looking like an idiot taking a picture of my pizza, the oil actually dripped down my palm on to my wrist and my arm. Serves me right.

They also had a stuffed slice which looked a little scary, as well as a Hawaiian pie and a veggie pie, and some garlic knots. All those things looked even greasier.

From a quick search, this appears to be a chain in Vegas which I didn't get a chance to visit during my stay, so I wonder if the chain is this mediocre, or if it just seemed not that great since I was trying it for the first time at an airport. Maybe I'll try a real location next time I'm in Vegas. Also, maybe not.",37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,10,7,3,qn_5DSdHyazKJuldOYO21g

4978348,2016-05-31,0,lYCeqldIiOggsbByH3RRhw,This pizza was beyond horrible. I was headed out of Vegas and decided I wanted some pizza since I was still recovering from a good night. So first of all they didn't have much of a selection and were basically out of everything. I was going to be greedy and get two slices because I was trying to sell recover however since they didn't have the proper inventory I settled for one slice of pepperoni which I'm so glad. The pizza was extremely greasy. I know it's going to be greasy other way because it's pepperoni but it was pretty ridiculous. It didn't taste good at all. The bottom was slightly burnt but I ate it since I bought it. Definitely know not to stop here ever again!,bbum3hJxkEzZvjXiZgdKVA,1,0,1,xxaD40ybm0wy_gRM0e-JYQ

4 stars for filling my pizza craving and most important, being open when nothing else was, after midnight... big points in my book. 3 stars for taste and price. Would definitely recommend if hungry for pizza and in that part of the terminal.",PIethXohNwpHCMVCfIqcfg,0,0,4,mcq4tXWQqdMeKPZCnPpOKw

On my way home today, I decided to pick up something small to ""gnaw"" on, since I skipped out on lunch.

While I waiting at the McCarran airport  terminal #3 - ""D gate"", I see a place called - Metro Pizza nearby, so I wandered overthere to get a slice of veggie pizza for $6.37.

What you get for $6.37 is pretty bad pizza! 

IMHO it tasted worst than frozen Tombstone pizza.
The slice was pretty oily, and the crust was very hard like cardboard! Yuck!

Save your money, and eat air instead, or wait till you get on board your flight to have something to eat.

Believe me, you won't regret it!",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,13,11,2,MTPE9zLsv0gbKfWtomIy9g
