So if you are in the Rancho/Alta, Ranco/Charleston area, stop by and get yourself a great meal. You will be happy you did.

The facility is clean and actually kind of big for a Quizno's. It is in a weird complex so it's easy to miss. It's one of the few places near my work open late enough that I can grab a quick bite if I don't bring my lunch.",dlakiiEemBIOdZGwbnlE-A,2,0,4,tW6JtK7_QRkxNwnMx41FSw

I have done my best to eat pencils and avoid ever having to come back here.  On this particular occasion, I was out ranked.

What I found was a completely different experience.  The two super friendly ladies making delicious sandwiches behind the counter were hustling all the while with smiles on their faces.

I wonder just how successful this franchise would be having these two wonder woman rocking the lunch rush?

My sandwich was awesome.  The side of happiness added to my combo meal made it pop!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,6,6,4,9A50t9-KUQ_jtZzYZELivA
1968635,2017-02-15,0,hJX8WoV-KbFVHojZ6i83Cg,"I've always loved the blank angus steak sandwich, so when I have time to drive across town to get Quiznos, I'm happy.  Unfortunately that doesn't happen often.

The reason for this five star rating though is truly more due to the quality of service I've received here.  Tonight I met the owners of this location, and was extremely impressed.  First, the wife was very conversational and sweet while she made my sandwich.  I also then met her husband who was friendly as well.  

Then a situation happened in which a homeless man came in and immediately started coming towards me (I was the only customer at the time), but the owner (husband) intercepted and made sure to handle the situation.  The man wanted us to call 9-1-1 for his feet hurting.  I truly felt bad for the man and watched as the EMTs attempted to help him, but it was a mental illness that needed to be addressed more than any actual injury.  Anyways, the point is that the owner handled it very well in making sure that it didn't become a big scene and protected me from feeling scared.  (I'm a young woman so men approaching me can sometimes be scary.)

Overall I was just very impressed by the owners' customer service.  And, that sandwich is just so good, it gets 5 stars too.",V0LJ8YCJ2qsnGoUppDRdBA,0,0,5,9dTRuzXBb8Lh6Zso6UOjOQ

My stomach hurts sooooo bad and it's the only thing I've eaten all day so I know for sure it was the sandwich. I ordered the angus steak, my mother the prime rib and my cousin the honey mustard chicken. We all have upset stomachs and we didn't much enjoy our sandwiches but 3 sandwiches came out to almost $40 so we ate them. I didn't enjoy it, and will never eat here again.

As all good Yelpers do, I am updating my review, as the rating for this Quizno's location has changed. I arrived before the typical ""lunch hour"" and was pleased to find no line. It was prompt, friendly service at it's finest. The Baja Chicken was as good as ever and the AC was chillin'. I got it to go and was very pleased to find it traveled well. As long as the AC is working, this place is hard to beat for a quick tasty sandwich. I will definitely be back.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,3,1,4,1Wf0EXe6hz4t1bTyZ8WLzA

The peppercorn steak on white was amazing as usual along with my chicken bacon salad. As we sat and ate we both agreed it was by far, better than a Subway sandwich and it was all about the bread!

Until one day I was sick and unable to drive to pick up my lunch so I order online for delivery . I ordered my sandwich at 11:38 , I didn't get my one sandwich until 12:30. Mind you I live two lights down from Quiznos . My sandwich was very cold and soggy. It was obvious my sandwich was sitting for a while before it was delivered. I will never order delivery again .

I'm I the middle of my meal, I walk up ask for a side of vinegar and with a straight face she says $0.39, wow. I'm only asking because the sub is dry to begin with. 

Not welcoming at all, why would I ever return to a place that is willing to rip its customers off like that.  

The steak sub I ordered tasted like dry grocery store roast beef, the sauce station has been removed, this is my  first Quiznos visit  in 3 years and it's definitely my last.

I honestly want my money back, except for the drink and chips I'll pay for those as they were the best part of the meal.",ZW0Aq6LthdFXP9nhRfiBvg,0,0,1,RQksv2VhapQLxh-U8Ccvng
