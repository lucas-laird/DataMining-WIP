I had the cheesesteak and was told like everywhere else in the States that it would be ""just like Atlantic City, even the bread"". Obviously and like always, it never is. Someone just needs to own a Vegas steak and stop trying to re-create the East. The bread tastes nothing like Atlantic City, but the personality of the owners makes you feel at home and appreciated. The meatballs were ok, and the portions are so small that you instantly know you're not on the east coast. The worst part - three of us got sick, we all had the same meals for the past two days so I know it wasn't anything else.

I had The Hesh sandwich, pastrami and cheese with a side of thousand island a side of cole slaw. I figured these would come on the sandwich but whatever. Sandwich, fries and a 12 oz drink cost me $13 something, that's a little much. Sandwich was fine, but nothing to really Yelp about. I was not offered the free meatball tasting :( but the next people to walk in were so I guess that whole thing is a little hit and miss. 

I came with a friend and her 2yr old son. She decided to have two slices of pizza at $2.99 per slice and the girl at the counter convinced her to just order a whole pizza for $9.99. What a great suggestion as that translates into some pizza for me! 

The owners were friendly, in fact a little much so. They were at the table every few minutes touching the baby, making faces at the baby, cooing at the baby, petting the baby, etc. I haven't spent a lot of time around babies but I found this behavior to be a little much. I would have preferred to just sit there and eat my lunch undisturbed....but they did give junior a free ice cream bar, so that was nice. 

I'll probably give this place another shot if I'm in the area, but I'm not going to drive across town for it.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,1,0,3,pG2AwH5yV1EHptXKNH9LeQ

322071,2011-01-31,0,UutHMmZx1CQcjiyfmVa_7g,"Disappointed to say the very least.  I live in the area and have driven by Eddie D's several times.  Finally decided to stop in on Saturday and give it a try.  Have to say that the staff was very friendly.  As we waited for our order ""Eddie"" made sure to make rounds and ask people to join Facebook and passed out meatball and deli meat slices to several customers in the restaurant....actually...to all except us...my friend's son decided to ask for a sample of the meatballs.  We tried them and were quite impressed....a bit disappointed we hadn't tried them first and ordered some spaghetti or a meatball sub.  We decided we would definitely have to come back another time even after being ignored.

On this visit we had ordered a pizza which was average.  Paper paper thin...could eat a whole one to myself and I'm a small gal.  Also ordered a turkey sub and hot wings.  Again, all very average.  Was also not given any ranch.  Luckily I had some at home.

We ordered to go on the next visit.  The order included a cheese pizza, small order of spaghetti and meatballs, and a meatball sub.  Worst $34 I've ever spent.  I truly feel ripped off.

The spaghetti barely had any sauce and the noodles tasted a day old.  The meatball sub wasn't very good either.  She asked if I wanted cheese and I said yes.  There was like a teeny tiny drop of cheese on the top.  I live about 6 minutes from this joint.  By the time I got home the sub was so soggy it fell apart and the nasty soggy bread was thrown out.  So basically I just got to eat a handful of meatballs for dinner.

The pizza was very skimpy on cheese too.  When I opened it I saw sauce poured on top sporadically.  I thoguth this was extra sauce for flavor...nope...it was in place of cheese in these areas.  Was really quite a rip off.  So soggy from all the extra sauce to avoid giving me some damn cheese on my pizza and so paper thin it fell apart quickly.  I will never visit again.

EASILY hands down not even close!!!! the best meatballs ive ever had in this town...lord i hope they really are home made like the kid behind the counter said, absolute deliciousness.

i was recommended by the nice woman behind the counter to try the pork shoulder with a slice of cheese on it and the natural ajus on the side....so i have no problem trying someones recommendation.

it was out of this world, so juicy and not dry like those mexican pork shoulders you get in your crapritto..and the ajus on the side was SO good

i also got a side of meatballs and asked them to make them like a parmigiana style without the bread, so he took some and put the sauce and cheese and threw em in the oven for a little....truly a delicacy! haha.

i tried the italian ice they have in there as the kid behind the counter was raving about it and the lady was telling me all about it and how they make it there with the owner of the company and what not....it wasnt that good to be honest. it looked really liquid and syrupy....i sampled the banana and coconut, taste was way too sweet for me. I got the lemon as i was leaving because i wanted something with a little sour to it, the lemon was good. I recently tried another italian ice place called CJ's since ive been here, would recommend going there instead, but if i want a pork shoulder i will just bite the bullet and eat here lol! 

the only complaint i have, it was very pricy for what you get. the pork shoulder came on like a 6-8"" roll and was $8 i believe, the side of meatballs they charged me $6.99 which was price of a meatball parm sub, AND an additional $1.50 to put sauce and cheese on it.....so im not sure why charge me for the sub....does it not come with sauce and cheese? a lot of hidden fees....and it came up to $19 for these 2 items only...




but honestly it was delicious so i never mind paying for quality food, just wish i woulda known it would have been almost $20....i will be returning for sure.",2oF_oHcerMolLL6jlO-aDA,0,0,4,OpYAgCl-3pj0HonsbswOOQ
412335,2011-06-27,0,UutHMmZx1CQcjiyfmVa_7g,"I agree with Holly, not sure what to think of this place. I went here after hearing friends rave about this place plus my roommate had gone the day before and had ordered the meatball sandwich and kept saying how awesome it was. 

I mean all the hype about their sandwiches and yet they couldn't meet the expectations I had. Perhaps I expected wayyy tooo much? I ordered the Elliottness along with the New Yorker with a side of potato side.

First the the Elliott Ness! I ordered this with pastrami and originally I just received a hot pastrami & cheese no fries! So when I told them my order was wrong, the two employees started yelling at each other for screwing up the order haha! So they threw fries on the sandwich and needless to say the sandwich has no flavor whatsoever, both the pastrami and fries were bland. Not even the dressing could save it!

So next I tried the New Yorker, which is hot roast beef sandwich on garlic bread and a side of au jus. Well you get to choose if you want sliced roast beef or shredded roast beef. On this trip we choose the shredded. The meat was nice and tender but again no flavor! Even the au jus was bland! The only semi-saving grace was the garlic bread it was on and that taste was in my mouth all day. And the potato salad was actually pretty decent so that was a surprise.

Sadly I was disappointed by the sandwich after paying $20 for 2 people to eat. The sandwiches were pretty small and I still left hungry. Thank goodness for Drago Sisters Bakery next door! I'm willing to give them another shot and try their meatball or Pauly sandwich but I'll stick to Cap's or East Coast Eats for regular visits!",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,1,0,3,2MElP74zCHKZGIJWP9N1Wg
517021,2011-08-08,0,UutHMmZx1CQcjiyfmVa_7g,"You had me at ""free meatball?""

While the decor here is basic, the food is phenomenal. The manager, Gary, was warm and welcoming, and offered the free meatball for the newb. He asked if I was looking for a hot sandwich. I said no, a cold one, and he recommended the Pauly Walnuts. I'm game for things with a funky name, and when the first ingredient was prosciutto, he didn't have to say anything else. The other meats and the fresh cheese were all gravy for me. The funny thing was, the cashier is way at the back. So I told Gary to start making it, and then I had to tell the cashier what he was making for me. She took my name and said she'd bring out the sandwich when it was ready.
About 5 minutes later, I had my little slice of heaven ready to be devoured. I'm a fan of hearty bread, and this was some of the best I've had outside of Europe. This is bread that Subway execs have wet dreams about. Fresh, think, and hearty, it was almost a meal unto itself. The meats were fresh and flavorful. I usually have prosciutto by itself, so having it on a sandwich was a little new for me, but still totally tasty. The first bite told me everything: fresh, real, deli meats, real cheese, real good! A little pricey for lunch, but it could probably feed two - I pondered long and hard before delving in to the second half. 
I'd definitely come back again, and then swing by the bakery next door for dessert.",OOflEjgmh5_rrbvOeJzStA,0,0,4,M32ACY3Zd6kSTSBdNzMkVQ

FuggedddaboutIT -
you found it- here at Eddie D's, which I prefer to call Most Awesome Italian Deli. 
I totally love the Soprano's themed sandwiches - and pictures ;) 
They have refrigerated cases showing all fresh meat and big hunks of cheese.
They also have a lot of salads, peppers and other items to choose from to add to your order. 
I went with a party of 3, and we all had different wants - me I took the chicago hot beef with a hard roll - with a side of tortellini salad. 
Susan took the meatball sub...
and John, totally ordered a pizza.
Everything is cooked to order so I ended up eating my tortellini salad before my sandwich ever arrived. 
It was SO good that I actually was mad I didn't get a larger order to take home with me. 
When we got our sandwiches I was excited the sandwich was stacked HIGH , on a fresh hard roll, that was perfect for dipping in the Au jus.  It was fragrant and had excellent robust flavor. 
Susan let me try a little of her meatball sub- and I will be honest... i normally do not like meatball subs...  i don't like meatballs that are pre processed  and am VERY picky. These meatballs were fresh- the marinara sauce -- heavenly it was not overpowering and had GREAT flavor. (I might order this on my own next time)
The pizza was a crispy pizza with several toppings that John chose just for him.  But I did notice that every item was very fresh, and the flavor was good.
Service was awesome by MR. and Mrs. Eddie D .  I love them now and want to be adopted ... 
ESPECIALLY after eating the homemade tiramisu and cannoli ... 
even a bite of Johns white chocolate mousse was to die for. 
I was pretty sure they were going to have to roll me out the door. 
I am thinking that this will become a habit...

It's about 3 miles from my office - lunch today - OPEN and not too busy. 

while waiting to order the owner / manager offers a sample of meatballs ...very good. 

I order : 

Italian sausage ( add grilled onions ) 

The Robert ( their version of the Bobbie ) 

The pulled pork ( add monterey jack ) 

Total cost $23.50 

While waiting i noticed they had other sammies with sharp provolone - it wasn't On the cheese options portion of the menu  - i would've ordered that with the pork ... bummer

The verdict - 

One constant - the bread - excellent - i give it tops for best sammie roll in the Valley - period. 

the sausage was amazing - great flavor - liked that the skin was removed - all good. 

The pork - decent but there wasn't nearly as much cheese as needed and could've used a little more pork. But still, good flavor. 

The Robert - sorry guys , I do like that you grill up the turkey but the ratio between turkey and stuffing does not compare to your competitor. 

Overall, I dig this place and look forward to trying all their sammies !

I AM UBER BUMMED, but my review below was for the CHEYENNE location, not this Rainbow location. Apparently the CHEYENNE location went out of business. The last time I was there, the managers told me they were opening a second location (Rainbow).

It's all good though, because you can get the original Bobbie from Capriottis just down the street on Cheyenne and Buffalo. It's no knockoff like the Robert.

Also, beware of false advertising. These guys claim LV Weekly gave them the award for ""Best Sandwich in Las Vegas"" in 2010 and 2011. Not entirely true. In 2010, they were tied with Capriotti's. And in 2011, the best sandwich went to The Johnny at Johnny McGuire's. Google it for yourself. 

Don't buy into false advertising. This place off Cheyenne was damn good. But don't let lies deceive you.

In any case, any Yelp reviews you see, might be from the old location at Cheyenne. Not a knock on Eddie D's because I used to love this place.

We were so happy for the Rainbow location to open up so we added them on Facebook to keep track of when the new location was opening since it's so much closer to home and the hours were awesome (open until 3am?? Really? Sweet!)

It is Friday June 3 (Opening day!) and my boyfriend and I are craving the meatball subs! Unfortunately, we both had a long day and couldn't make it until later...but wait, they are advertised to be open until 3am! Fantastic. So we stop by for a sub at 12:30am. The door was locked but there were employees inside. One of the employees unlocked the door for us and we walked in. We were deciding on what to get when the employee yells across us to another employee behind the counter..then he yelled back to her then she told us that there is no food left and that everything was already put away. I made sure that they were closing at 3am but she said that they had no food. The door said 3 am and it was advertised all over the Facebook page what the hours were (Note: On Sunday June 5, they re-posted their hours on Facebook and the hours on Yelp are correct). Later, I added a comment to the their Facebook page saying their hours were wrong and what had happened on opening night.

I love supporting businesses like this but you can't just change the hours on opening day. Also deleting the comments wasn't so nice..hence the Yelp review.

Chicken Jerry: Breaded Chicken, Tavern Ham, Swiss Cheese and a unique dipping sauce. Nicely breaded, ham and swiss reminded me of a cordon bleu chicken and the dipping sauce a little sweet and grapey.. Yum!

Philly Cheese Steak: Black Angus Steak, sauteed onions, green bell peppers and opted for the provolone. One of the better Phillys I've had!

They may have just been having a bad day. This restaurant isn't particularly close to me so I don't see myself giving it a second try.  Just too many good restaurants in this town to go out of my way to try this again.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,3,2,3,13dOlxGoQ3P68j_-cYKFWA
2247900,2010-11-17,1,UutHMmZx1CQcjiyfmVa_7g,"been here twice. im a mild sandwich buff. 

my sis and i was craving something wholesome for lunch, so we came in and i wanted a hot sub,  so i asked what was good. guy at the reg' gave me three options: meatball, steak, or chicken. meatball fo'sh. since this place is italian, why not. it comes with mozzerela but i love provolone, so i switched. my sis got the steak pizza sandwich, and we shared a basket of steak fries. he had a regular fountain drink, but the ""manhattan"" espresso coffee soda spoke to me.

when my total reached to $27.60 for our whole order, my first reaction, was ""my bf is gonna kill me for spending this much. hope it's worth it.""

sports were on so i was watching that while thinking if i was charged right. it seemed right. in that moment, i wanted to drop a star.

this shop is no ordinary sub shop. owner shirley took care of us like she was  ""aunt shirley"" and we were coming over her house to enjoy her best recipe's. when i mean she took care of us, she basically waited on us, the way our mama's take care of us when we're sick. 

we got our food, let me tell you, i was kinda discouraged at how small it looked. but then i took a bite into the meatball, wow, ""that's one good meatball"".  that one meatball was packed with flavor, like mary poppins' suitcase is full of magic. ive had other meatball sandwiches, that weren't so great because it would fall apart, but they use the wholesome bread durable to hold all the sauce and meatballs, and cheese. the owners followed up on how we enjoyed our food, they ask with so much pride in their recipes. i can't argue. in the end the price is reasonable because the sub is suffice for folks with great appetites. i'm able to take home the other half for later.

5 full stars for the hospitality and quality

they also have a mini fridge of italian desserts, such as cannoli's. gotta try that next time.",DASkWfrV6kWHE_4xC7BkYQ,2,3,5,OWaHu71TDSsNJDnaSPD5dQ
2250549,2012-01-16,2,UutHMmZx1CQcjiyfmVa_7g,"The advance buzz on Eddie D's led me to believe two things: they're known for their bread, and the vegetarian options are non-existent.

I'm happy to report that the bread is, indeed, yummy - light but crusty is what I like - and while the main veggie options may be slim (two sandwiches plus pizza), what you can order is hot, tasty, and not the usual ""salad + cheese"" found elsewhere, so vegheads, don't be shy.

I got The Meadow - ""eggplant, sharp provolone, broccoli rabe, and roasted red peppers"" - except I ordered mine without the broccoli rabe because I live with the irrational fear that I'll accidentally be served broccoli instead of rapini, and I don't like broccoli. (Unless you bread it, serve it in a curry, and call it pakora.) So, the other veg sandwich on the menu, the one with actual broccoli providing the sandwich's bulk, was definitely right out for me. 

The guy behind the counter had no problem tweaking the sandwich to my taste, though, and you can, actually, order sandwiches to order, although the ordering scheme is meat-based. (But again, they'll clearly work with you so you get what you want.)

And oh yum, what a sanger. Two hands to hold, lots of flavour, and a bit of a happy mess from the flour on the bread and the heap of food inside. You know how I felt? Like Joey on Friends. How often does a vegetarian get to say that?

I didn't try the pizza, but it smelled great, and it looked like bang-on New York style. (Pick it up and the tip points south.) I'm not a fan of this kind of pizza, but if it's as good as the sandwich, you ""fold to eat"" pizza fans are probably in luck.

The interior is pleasant, airy, with a TV, plenty of tables of good size, and ample evidence that Eddie D's is a neighbourhood kind of place. (Christmas cards from customers, local fundraiser information.)

I never knew there was a lack of hot eggplant sandwiches in my life until I tried Eddie D's. I look forward to correcting this again soon.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,3,3,4,4x3xPkHYT4dvcscVyAdUaQ

The rest of the lunch meal wasn't so bad, but I have to admit that I had better.  

I ordered the meatball sub, the 9.99 cheese pizza (coupon), the philly, and steak fries.  The meatball sub is huge, which is typical, and smothered just right with sauce and cheese. Their sauce is pretty tangy, and their meatball, although juicy, needed more salt in my opinion.  A little more salt goes a long way. The steak fries weren't steak fries but fat fries.  I do believe that steak fries are flat, not a larger cousin of the shoestrings.  Still, the fries were actually awesome.  The pizza, although the thing, need-to-fold type wasn't awesome, but okay.  

I'd eat here again for the fries, but I'm not down for anything else there.  It was just meh.  I'll try them again in six months and see if they improve.

They serve it with lettuce and marinated tomatoes and the best part is the delicious hard roll it's served on.  It is a perfect sandwich roll, delicious mild sour flavor, not to hard, and chewy.  (I love bread)

I am from San Francisco and I love deli sandwiches but have never found anything that I have liked in town until now (I love a bobbie but thats completely different).   I think this place only has italian meats and cheeses so don't come here looking for a bacon and turkey sandwich.  Also the sandwiches with the artisan meats and cheeses are just a tad under 9 bucks but it's worth it because you figure those ingredients are expensive, and they don't skimp so I feel its a fair price.  All the hot sandwiches like cheese steaks and meatballs are actually a buck or 2 cheaper.  

I had the cheese steak and I wasn't crazy about it but I did have a made to order mini canolli for a buck and it was fantastic, they also sell great gelato by the pint.  I gave them a 5 because the cold cut sandwich was that great and they were very friendly, and the canolli is awesome for a small one buck dessert.

My wife and I stopped in for lunch and I ordered the Hot Eddies Famous Roast Beef (with provolone, onions,mushrooms,and grilled banana peppers) I was surprised to find out I had 8 choices in peppers to add to my incredible sandwich. The bread is amazing and PERFECT. The hot aus jus is the best I have ever had. The steak fries were also very good. My wife ordered the famous meat ball sandwich and now I understand what all the fuss is about. This was a great sandwich. Meatballs were old school and perfect. nothing out of a freezer bag. Slow cooked and juicy.
The service would be tough to beat on any level. When you have two very active owners helping in the ordering and food delivery process you cannot go wrong.

Walking up, we couldn't tell if it was an actual store, or if there was another entrance because the whole front side is plastered with this graphic window film that you couldn't see through but, once you get inside, you can totally see the outside.  I guess it's to block the sun, but God forbid the store gets held up, you can't see what's going on and you innoncently walk in...sucks for you.

Usually when the s/o and I hit up a new sandwich spot, we each order a sandwich and swap half for the other's to get a good sampling.

I ordered their Pauly Walnuts and the s/o ordered the Johnny Sack.  Both sandwiches were piled high with meat but unfortunately, when we swapped halves, I had a hard time telling which was which as they tasted quite the same, until the Hot Capicola in the Johnny Sack woke my tastebuds.  Speaking of the Johnny Sack, it did have quite a bit of flavor and I loved the Sharp Provolone that it was served with but, for some reason, the meat was really cold, almost frozen, then sure enough, when I pulled the tomato out, it was partially frozen, what the?

My Pauly Walnuts was good, it was like a tame version of the Johnny Sack.  Funny how it was served with Sharp Provolone too but, I could barely taste it.  And yes, the meat was also very cold and the tomato was partially frozen.  Okay, I'm fine with the meat being almost frozen as it's probably easier to cut, but the tomato, really?  Also, the bread they use was kind of tough.  IMO, if the sandwich was heated, it would've tasted so much better.

Overall, Eddie D's serves up good sandwiches but, it's nothing to write home about, well, Yelp excluded.",-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ,1,2,3,oF65NTXocnOhedaslsCh-w

The free meatball was ok, needs more salt. They are super friendly though (although, they were almost too friendly and it was uncomfortable to eat). We both had horrid gas that night (I know, TMI! lol)

THIS IS THE BEST SANDWICH PLACE IN TOWN HANDS DOWN NO QUESTIONS ASKED.  
I lived in the south side of Pittsburgh for 4 years.  Pittsburgh has some of the best sandwiches anywhere (if you've eaten at Primanti Brothers you know what I'm talking about).  This place not only equals those amazing East Coast sandwiches, I would arguably say they beat the sandwiches I had on the east coast because of the high quality of the bread.  

Look this restaurant was so good it gave me goose bumps and flash backs to the 22 years I lived on the East Coast.  (1)  The meet is super high quality  (2)  The service is some of the best I've ever seen in a sandwich shop (3) the owner was actually there and he loves his job and loves sandwiches.

The pizza was BIG and ok but not real amazing sauce.

Hanging out with foodie friends, we were pensive about a new place that is across town. But being foodies, we cannot let our fear of the uncharted cripple us from trying something new. Thank goodness that we didn't. Instead we just sent one person to pick up while we continued to lounge.

The place was apparently packed and the wait was long, but they were courteous and gave my friend a slice of pizza and a meatball. He said the pizza was delicious, so it might be the agenda for the next visit.

We had ordered 2 Heshes; a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and thousand island dressing. Both on the side so that the sandwich would not be soggy by the time it got to us. I had ordered the Pauly Walnuts and it was phenomenal. The priscuitto, capicola, and salami was meatastic. The best part was the crusty bread. It provided such a wonderful contrast to everything else within. I would not hesitate to order it again. Although some might complain that it is expensive at $8.50, but it is not bad if you look at all the high quality ingredients. The only down side is that their wings are a breaded mess.

He walked my man and I through the menu, step by step. He was so proud of his food and pretty much hand picked our sandwiches for us. My boyfriend had wanted to order the Roast Beef but went with a Meatball Sandwich mainly because both Eddie and his wife insisted on it. They were right! So moist and juicy. I had a Dante (I beleive that it what its called) with Prosciutto, Roasted Red Peppers and Provolone. It was on this artisian bread and was beyond delicious. 
While we were waiting for our sandwiches Eddie brought over a basket of bread with a side of his marinara sauce for us to taste. He then brought us a few peices of the Roast Beef (to my boyfriend's delight) and some au jus to taste as well. So make sure to ask for a sample or two if you're having trouble making a decision but know that everything is good. 
They also will deliver anything on the menu, including pints of sauce, cold cuts, or their famous sandwiches and wings. Plus there is no delivery minumum which makes my one sandwich belly very happy.",l7E5dQmzqg_X_oUI8x_88g,0,1,5,qus6VL_Zw8xAe0fJ4X0jqQ

After a thorough review, we decided on the order and I walked to the cashier to place it.  I was told immediately that our choices were all good choices.

While waiting for the food, they came back over to offer a sample of their meatballs, these were really good, very tender and just the right amount of seasoning.  

We got three sandwiches to try, we had two of the ""Johnny Sack"" which has hot capicola, prosciutto, sharp provolone on this really good bread, and marinated tomatoes.  It was really good.  We got two of ""Pauly Walnuts"", which had prosciutto, capicola, genoa salami, sharp provolone on their bread and it had the marinated tomatoes and lettuce.  Both were really good.

We also wanted to try a pizza, so we ordered a mushroom, olive and sausage pizza.  The crust was crispy on the bottom, not too thick and really good.

Now for the real kicker the elderly couple running the place are either attention starved or have no, NO knowledge of the hospitality industry.  My friend and I could not peacefully eat our dinner.  They not only kept coming by every 3 minutes to ask us how we liked it they wanted to chat.  The fellow even sat down at our table and chatted at us and, here is the kicker.  HE. KEPT. TOUCHING.

5498944,2012-04-18,0,UutHMmZx1CQcjiyfmVa_7g,"Very good sandwiches, but very overpriced.

The base of the sandwich here is Eddie D's signature bread, which is easiest described as a ciabatta.

I've had two sandwiches here. The first was a daily special called the Sausage Diablo. It's a hot Italian sausage, split and grilled, and topped with freshly sauteed peppers, onion and tomato sauce.

The second sandwich I ordered was a riff on the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia. Semi-off-menu, I ordered up a roast pork sub prepared the way they make their eggplant sandwich, the Meadow - topped with broccoli rabe, roasted red peppers and sharp provolone. Au jus on the side.

Since Eddie D's names their sandwiches after Sopranos characters, and since my off-menu creation is essentially a ""Pork Meadow,"" let's refer to it as the Jackie Jr.

The one hesitation I have about this place is the price. $8-11 is too much to pay for a counter-service sandwich, even a good one like this.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,0,4,YAeFdVRjm_KJIL-jzIhtGg

Well, first of all, I'm surprised by some bad reviews.  Someone complained about portion sizes? We were stuffed beyond what we even WANTED! Pretty much a meal for the DAY! 

Here's what happened: We walked in, were greeted by super friendly guys and introduced to the AWESOME meatballs ""just to taste"" as one owner put it.  

My husband and I ordered a turkey sandwich with fresh mozzarella and roasted peppers to share and an order of ten wings.  Our sandwich came with no mozz, which was really what we wanted...they took it back right away and fixed it happily.  

Sandwich was awesome.  The bread and mozz was perfect.  The wings were also SUPER good.  Crispy wet outside,  tender inside.  Medium sauce was delicious.  My husband merely asked about the pizza, and they ended up giving us a slice ""just to taste!""  The pizza...wow.  Great NY style.  Thin, crispy crust, great sauce.  Fresh.  Yum. Also got some extra wings...nuts!  We were STUFFED.  Chatted a bit with the guys. 

They sell all their food by the pound, so if you want some great Italian food for a bunch of people fast, this is your place.  They even have some upstate NY ""riggies"" dish!

Point blank- ambiance rules.  Loud NY chatter, friendly vibe.  ""We serve to please"" type attitude- something that is truly missing in Vegas.
