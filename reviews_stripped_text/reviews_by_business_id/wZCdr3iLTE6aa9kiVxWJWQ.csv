Contemporary fine dining at a super-price, made to order, to go from a kiosk(I feel bad saying shack) on the corner next to Dino's. If the same meal were plated and served at a table inside a restaurant on the strip, we would have expected to pay $150 or more, and it would have been worth it. 

We enjoyed the short rib special today, and ordered all the sides. All incredible. I won't hesitate to try anything from there. Feeling like a super-cool insider having discovered this place!",GhKNo6inyAjpeO_HZFe3Wg,1,0,5,DKvrpWOWacUanJaFWRG12A

The food was really, really good. I ordered the SLO-wich, which is a tri-tip sandwich with bbq sauce. The meat was tender and the sauce was great. Awesome sandwich.
I also tried the John S. Park, which consists of beef cheek. Sounded weird but turn out to be really good. I would liken it to short rib. 
The real game changer though was the bread pudding. No offense to the other items on the menu, which I'm sure are excellent but the bread pudding was pretty life changing. Like drop the fork ""holy &@?!"". It's hard to even describe. Imagine bread pudding and then make it exponentially better than any bread pudding you've ever tasted.
Can't way to go back. Really want to try the duck next. They didn't have it this time around. I highly recommend SLO Boy. It's a different experience than what Las Vegas locals are typically exposed to, which is really cool.",g4JjUBe5FGlxj1lsWDpSxA,0,0,5,pFZxrjavzdyNNzDTDNH9Qg

Slo-wich: so good I ate it all! Generous portion of grass-fed Santa Monica tri-tip with Wookie Jack sauce on a sturdy roll that stood up to the grease and sauce. Would get this again, but maybe adding some sort of pickled veggie would make it even better.
Central Coast Salad (CCS): Greens and charred scallions topped with a nice, light beer vinaigrette and a generous portion of goat cheddar. Wish this had walnuts or something for added texture, but good lunch dish. Not a meal on it's own though, add a side.
Tamale Cup: This is the dish I was most interested in, but it didn't really do it for me. Individually, the mole, beef cheek, and masa components all seemed okay, but they didn't seem to form a cohesive dish. This was greasier than expected, but I am glad some pickled vegetables were included as topping.

2887667,2016-03-05,3,wZCdr3iLTE6aa9kiVxWJWQ,"How can you go wrong in this location?  These guys are the prime example of Las Vegas street foodie fare.  Commandeering the front of Dinos former Goodwich shack.  Slo-Boy is like the dinner version of the Goodwich.  With similar healthy small farm ingredients such as green carrot top sauce and grass fed beef tri-tip.  You can't eat this good for 10 bucks anywhere in Vegas.

The idea is southern gourmet with a casual street appeal.  The flavors are all savory as all Hell.  We're talking Michelin street-star style comfort food.  At a bargain, too.  Everything on the menu is smart and no matter what you order you will learn real quick, this boy ain't playing!

-Porchetta is probably our favorite protein here.  They slice a roll of slow cooked pork belly and give it a slight charring.  Soft and crispy.  Paired with a nutty fig sauce.  Best textured and tasting version of bacon ever.

-Grass-fed tri tip that is so tender that if for some reason you didn't like it, it would cry.  The green sauce was a chimichurri type made with carrot top greens.  You get a real value for the steak portions, too. You dont want to miss it.

-Harissa carrots.  Get the carrots.  Just do.  Tender and come with a white super sauce to drizzle or dip in.  My favorite side.

-Tripple cooked potato.  This one can be tough to make.  One time we got them crispy on the outside.  Another time they were more soft and saucy.  All times they were freaking delicious.  The fancy sauce!  If thou hasn'st noticed yet there is a trend @Slo-boy.  Slow cooked with excellent sauce.  In almost everything.

Quick notes.  The Slo-wich is a straight tri-tip po-boy.  We loved the fried half of the cornish hen box.  Add extra porchetta to the C.C.S. and cheeky tamale cup.  Try the bread pudding desert as a proper finisher to all that savory.

So lucky to have our local young chefs going out on a limb to bring innovative twists on cuisine to the streets.  These guys most likely work for some of the master chefs on the strip.  Learning and earning the skills to bring us the next generation of gastronomy.  Slo-boy hits the spot.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,5,3,5,lCb1THa-uMcXKfTanXhbsg

SLO-Boy; great sandwiches, slow cooked tasty meats, and addictive Harissa carrots. I came here yesterday to indulge in some goodness before they leave their location in the Dino's parking lot. 

I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich, so I went with the Tri-Tip plate with a Harissa carrot salad. The Tri-tip was cooked to tender perfection and was slightly touched by the grill for that crunchy edge. The slowed cooked beef was like buttery orgy in my mouth, so tender that it could be cut with a plastic fork! The side of Harissa Carrots was amazing and still had a slight crisp to them and a great tangy flavor from the Harissa seasoning. 

The service is fast and I'm sure the Dino's customers are going to be missing this place after Saturday. Heads up, Chef Justin will be at Bunkhouse June 7th - 8th, after that, who knows?

3969865,2016-05-30,7,wZCdr3iLTE6aa9kiVxWJWQ,"Four of us came here before the closing of Slo-Boy to have a three course dinner.  Because of our number and the warming temperatures, one of our group arranged the meal for us and we ate in Dino's--the dive bar getting Las Vegas drunk since 1962.

Our courses were brought in shopping bags and we provided our own steak knives, paper plates, and napkins.  It was like having an indoor gourmet picnic.  

First course:  Highway 46, Hen Gone Wild, and Coq Au sandwich

Second course:  John S Park, charred cauliflower steak, PB&L, and Cigar City

Course three:  Tri-tip, Bucky Duck, baby steak fries, and Lamb for Logan

Dessert course:  Whiskey bread pudding

There was a lot of good things here coming out of the small Goodwich TBD incubator along Las Vegas Boulevard.  Highway 46, avocado toast with pea tendrils was quite good as was the salad with fried chicken.  The Cuban sandwich in course two and the charred cauliflower were my favorites.  In course three, I liked the steak fries and the duck.  Ending the meal, the whiskey bread pudding was very enjoyable.

Sitting in Dino's was an interesting place to eat.  I do like eating outside but when you're sitting on the sidewalk with assorted characters walking by, it's not my favorite outdoor dining.  Dino's makes it interesting with its loud music--none of it from my generation--and interesting patrons.

I wish I had tried Slo-Boy sooner.  I would have had the chance to go back and have one of my favorites again if just the bread pudding.  Good meal, good company!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,9,4,FdViH9NAVvScG4EV2jsA7Q

My potatoes were basically just the skins, completely hollow. One of them was still put together, so I don't think it was supposed to be that way? BBQ sauce covered most of my food, not just the meat. So it sort of overpowered the entire dish. Would have been nice to have it on the side. The flavors were good, but I guess the presentation is what threw me off. I expected more, and after viewing the other dishes posted here my expectations weren't far off.

4107038,2016-03-21,7,wZCdr3iLTE6aa9kiVxWJWQ,"After the Goodwich decided that it was time to transition to full brick-and-mortar, they turned their shack at the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming into a ""culinary incubator"" called the Goodwich TBD. Whoever took over had a lofty bar to reach, and I think these guys have done it.

SLO-Boy is the first resident of the Goodwich TBD, and they've been open for a good month and a half. It's Chef Justin Kingsley's Hall take on the food of San Luis Obispo (hence, SLO). Perhaps influenced by the Goodwich, he's created a simple but attractive menu with occasional specials.  I found myself looking for lunch in the area today, so I casually navigated my way to the parking lot where I'd spent so many delicious afternoons.

Ordering was also as simple as at the Goodwich: read the menu, ask them questions if you have any, pay with cash or incur a 25 cent credit card fee (same as the Goodwich, even the same e-mail receipt with ""the Goodwich"" as the sender). They'll also walk your completed order to you in your chair, your parked car, or wherever (within reason) that you decide to wait for your food.

After they grilled and boxed up my order in a relatively short amount of time, I took my huge paper bag back to my car and started to enjoy my loot.

Griddle Bread Pudding ($5): thick cut of whiskey bread pudding, pressed then seared on the flat top with butter; salted caramel sauce. Yep, it was a dessert-first kinda day. That naturally happens when it's the first thing that you pull out of your big bag of goodies. Eat this fresh for the best effect because there's a bit of a crispy crust that stands out against the soft, slightly spongy, homogeneous interior (no fruit or whatnot inside).  The salted caramel sauce pairs perfectly. The whiskey flavor is present and comes through more after the salted caramel starts to dissipate. Altogether, it's one of the best bread puddings that I've had.

Cheeky Tamale Cup ($9): braised beef cheek, fig and ancho mole, popcorn masa. The perfectly tender beef and killer mole meld into a stew that almost overcame my ability to put down the spoon and move on to other tastes. Note that there's a thick layer of soft, sweet corn masa at the very bottom, and that this will help to counteract the almost overwhelming saltiness of the beef and mole. The biggest issue might be that it's too small - or that the flavor doesn't linger on your taste buds for some reason, which I'm sure was making it even more addictive.

The bulk of the menu seems to point at the Pick Your Pleasure ($10 for a main and a field), which gives you a choice of three mains that apparently aren't available a la carte (no price listed), and three sides to pair. my ""main"" being the Grass Fed Tri-Tip and my ""field"" being the Harissa Carrots. The other two mains were Porchetta and Roasted Radish, Roots & Greens. The fields that I skipped were Triple Cooked Potatoes and C.C.S. (Central Coast Salad).

The Grass Fed Tri-Tip (SLO-rubbed slow cooked beef tri-tip, choice of Wookey Jack BBQ or Kingsley's Sauce) had a nice spice rub, but it wasn't as tender as I'd hoped. They were nice enough to let me try both sauces. I think it pairs better with the Wookey Jack BBQ sauce, which has sweet, acidic, and slightly spicy flavors as well as a very interesting overtone that I can't quite place. The Kingsley's Sauce is a good spicy pesto, but it didn't help me as much on the tri-tip. This was the lone, minor disappointment of the meal.

The Harissa Carrots (roasted on wood chips; harissa rub, toasted sunflower seeds, fresh mint, coriander creme) are sweet and cooked so that they're still crunchy, but give way readily to a plastic fork. The harissa is not as hot as I'd expected, and I thought that the coriander creme was unnecessary at first. But if you get everything in your mouth at once, including the crunchy sunflower seeds and fresh mint, it's really a fantastic, harmonious vegetarian dish.

Cigar City ($10): slow roasted pork shoulder, seared coffee rubbed pork belly, pickles, Swiss cheese, mustard. I didn't know that they were offering this special today, but I'm really glad that it was available. It's a splendid take on aCuban sandwich. The bread roll is firm yet soft and holds all the goodies inside comfortably. The dare-I-say copious amounts of tender pork, the sweeter-than-sour pickles, and the generous Swiss was fantastic. It might be a little too greasy, but it's easily one of the best sandwiches that I've had at this spot, including the brilliant sandwiches of the Goodwich.

SLO-Boy is serving bold combinations of flavors that should strongly satisfy omnivores, vegetarians, even  and sweet tooths (sweet teeth?) - heck, they almost made me forget about the delicious sandwiches that used to be grilled up here. The Goodwich itself will be back soon enough anyway, and they've done some good by helping to bring Chef Justin's creation to life. Whether he stays for just three months or the extended six months, you should stop by ASAP.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,11,8,5,XYGH43XjTlJJOCLzfF0JGw

4701552,2016-02-05,10,wZCdr3iLTE6aa9kiVxWJWQ,"Located in the previous home of The Goodwich, this kiosk is now a ""culinary incubator"" dubbed The Goodwich TBD. Its current resident is Chef Justin Kingsley's SLO-Boy.

The ""Pick Your Pleasure"" ($10) gives you one ""Main"" dish and one ""Field"" dish (it appears the sides can also be purchased separately for $5-8). I ordered everything on the menu except the Coq-in-a-Box and Dessert (Griddle Bread Pudding), since neither were available for opening.

Main
Grass-Fed Tri-Tip: Slo-rubbed slow cooked beef tri-tip with Wookey Jack BBQ or Kingsley's Sauce. I'm not well-versed in tri-tip, but I thought it was cooked nicely and had great flavor by itself. The Wookey Jack is sweet and smokey, while the Kingsley's Sauce is spicy. I liked the beef with both sauces!
Porchetta: Rolled and roasted pork belly, walnut stuffing, and carrot top pesto. Everything with the pork worked well together. Loved the crust on the fat and moist meat with the flavorful stuffing and pesto. Some parts of the fat were a bit difficult to chew, but I should have cut it into smaller pieces.
Roasted Radish, Roots & Greens: Simply dressed and seasoned. This is a little weak for a main dish (and for the same price as its protein counterparts), but it was still very tasty. I loved the beet greens and the golden beets especially.

From The Field
Harissa Carrots: Roasted on wood chips; harissa rub, toasted sunflower seeds, and fresh mint; served with coriander creme. These carrots were fabulous! I could eat a whole plate of it. The coriander creme was very lovely and paired well with the smokey/spicy carrots.
Triple Cooked Potatoes: Farmer's Market potatoes confit, smoked, and fried; served with saffron pepper mayo. The potatoes were good, though not particularly exciting. The saffron pepper mayo was wonderful and very fragrant.
CCS (Central Coast Salad): Market greens, goat cheddar, beer vinaigrette, and charred scallions. Wonderful salad that complemented both proteins. The dressing was fantastic.

Cheeky Tamale Cup ($9): Braised Beef cheek, fig and ancho mole, and popcorn masa. This is a very solid dish. The beef was succulent and the mole had a good sweet/savory balance. I'm not sure if the popcorn masa was really distinguishable, but it sounds really cool and it was tasty.

Sunny Side Dandelions ($7): Stewed dandelion greens with sunny side-up egg. These greens were phenomenal. Really well done and so flavorful! You can add Porchetta Bits ($2) that I'm sure would make it even more delicious.

Slo-Wich ($10): Grass-fed Santa Maria style tri-tip sandwich with Wookey Jack BBQ. This is the same tri-tip as the main dish, but placed on a roll. Again, great beef and I really liked the bread (not sure the type). The BBQ sauce is great, but I think having the Kingsley's Sauce as an option for the sandwich would be awesome (or both!). I would have loved some fixings on the sandwich as well, but that's definitely just a preference. 

The food is pretty solid. I enjoyed everything I ordered, though the vegetable dishes are stronger than the meat selections. Items I would order again: Harissa Carrots, Cheeky Tamale Cup, and Sunny Side Dandelions. I am interested in the Cornish Hen, so I'll need to revisit. 

This type of food is a little difficult to eat compared to the kiosk's past tenants since you need a fork and knife, but still manageable. There were a couple service issues including forgotten items and a long wait time, but it's all to be expected on opening day.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,25,17,4,yfEqbeJWF4_zPIGyFPxcBQ
5279068,2016-05-23,4,wZCdr3iLTE6aa9kiVxWJWQ,"Shortly after Joshua Clark's The Goodwich decided to go full Brick n' Mortar in DTLV it was announced that the small stall out front of Dino's Lounge would be turned into The Goodwich: TBD ""culinary incubator,"" and although several scheduling issues prevented a visit to premier tenant Justin Kingsley Hall's ""SLO-Boy Food"" during its first three months a meal on Friday proved what several Chefs have been saying for awhile - Chef Hall has a whole lot of talent.

Named after the Chef's home of San Luis Obispo, but equally applicable as relates to the Slowfoods movement with a focus on technique, product and sustainability, SLO-Boy presents a concise menu of roasted meats and local produce cooked with precision that far outperforms the humble environs and although ""take-out"" only, with a few outdoor seats plus the option for those 21+ to eat at Dino's, these limitations seem minor in comparison to the food's overall execution.

Reaching out to Chef Justin in advance, a coursed meal of SLO-Boy's current menu served by brown-paper-bag and Economical packaging with plastic forks, knives and spoons plus paper ""share plates"" brought from home, it was inside Dino's under *that* famous photograph of Johnny Cash that the four-course/dozen-item tasting was undertaken and with vivid descriptions as well as clever naming each item that arrived showed the work of a Chef willing to go the extra mile, no-doubt something honed through years of travel and time working at Comme Ca alongside Brian Howard.

Starting off with a trio, the new menu not exactly ""light"" eating despite low prices with sides $5-7 and entrees topping-out at $14, it seems only appropriate that a California native would offer Avocado Toast, but upping the ante on ""Highway 46"" with Pea Tendrils and blistered Tomatoes for acidity Hall's ability to coax flavor from fresh produce is immediately thrust front-and-center, the crispy Half Chicken far lighter than the usual fried stuff atop a vibrant salad while the ""Coq Au"" Sandwich is funky yet fresh by way of pate juxtaposing house-pickled vegetables - charcuterie as a condiment, by way of a sandwich.

Certainly not ""fine dining,"" patrons of the Dive-Bar occasionally belting out sounds as the soundtrack ranged from Miley Cyrus to Pantera, course two saw the team send out John S. Park, PB&L, Cauliflower Steak and Cigar City, the proteins each cooked as well as some seen at Michelin-Starred establishments with the Pork Belly particularly noteworthy as Hall achieves the perfect balance of crisp-but-still-fatty, and yet as good as each of these items were there is little doubt that the Charred Cauliflower Steak is the surprise hit of menu as a result of light smoke dancing beneath pureed Green Olives plus the concentrated flavor of Tomatoes and  gently poached Fennel.

Some at the table already full, an all-in bill below $120 essentially a complete look at SLO-Boy's current offerings but undoubtedly a lot of food, round three saw weekly special ""Lamb for Logan"" served alongside Hall's raved Grass Fed Tri-Tip, Baby Steak Fries and Bucky Duck, the pasta unfortunately a bit overdone though the Lamb and Mushroom ragout was outstanding while the lean Beef and confit Duck Leg again spoke of superior ingredients treated with the respect they deserve, the Harissa Carrots as good as rumor would have it while the melting Brie Crepe was textbook.

Rounding out the evening with Whiskey Bread Pudding - those fancying more subtle desserts well advised to abstain - there may be no finer example of the dish outside of Herringbone in the city at this moment and at just $5 per ""Thick Cut"" the custard soaked slice offers a perfect sear atop layers of creaminess, the base itself already impressive before a bath in luxurious Caramel sauce.

****Taking into account the limitations of its kitchen and setting Justin Kingsley Hall's SLO-Boy Food will be a tough act for any The Goodwich: TBD concept to follow, the up-coming months promising to be big ones for the young Chef with whatever comes next hopefully building on these concepts and an even bigger audience soon to see his considerable skills.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,6,4,XueD27HP7jwoy0PRB3nAuw

The sauce accompanying the potatoes complimented them well and were a delicious unexpected component to the dish. My wife had the tri tip and the central coast salad and again loved them both. The tri tip is great both on the roll and by itself. Also tried the Kingsley sauce which was a nice contrast to the meal. The BBQ sauce was both smokey and sweet where as the Kingsley sauce had just the right amount of spice. To close things out we had the bread pudding with caramel sauce. Again this was another amazing dish that I would have time and time again. Chef Justin Kingsley Hall was awesome and personable as was the entire staff. I will definitely be going back time and time again for the rest of the menu!,HKyrdpG7ZbogXXoCp0APZw,0,0,5,Zk1yP07nqm0qjk0lnp8bZg
5319165,2016-03-08,6,wZCdr3iLTE6aa9kiVxWJWQ,"A small shack which was once the home of The Goodwich on the lot of Dino's across the street from Olympic Garden. Small menu, big on taste...text ordering option if you don't want to wait.

Pick your main (protein: tri-tip, porchetta. OR the veggie option: roasted radish, roots and greens), from the field (carrots, triple cooked potatoes or Central Coast Salad...for $10. $3 more if you want extra. Choose your main sauce: Wookey Jack BBQ or Kingsley's Sauce.

Grass-Fed Tri-Tip:
You get thin slices of beef drizzled with sauce. Kingsley's sauce was the choice made - it's like a cilantro pesto sauce. It wasn't bad but it's not the best meat I've had. 3/5

Porchetta:
A slice of well-rendered flavorful roll of pork. Imagine Canadian bacon but 100x better because it's slightly crisp and tasty because of the herbs and walnut stuffing. 4/5

Central Coast Salad:
Aka CCS. Mixed greens, goat cheese, beer vinaigrette, and charred scallions. There are salads that pretend to be healthy but all you get is a sad bowl of lettuce with some basic stuff, and there are SALADS. Well, this is a SALAD - arugula, other greens, yummy scallions, friggin goat cheese...and f@[#ing beer! Because, dammit, why not!? 4/5

Coq-in-a-Box:
This is the box for me. Fried chicken breast drizzled with Kingsley's sauce (yup, that happened), braised leg, and mustard greens with olives and capers. The fried chicken breast was fantastically crispy. The braised leg tastes like Filipino chicken adobo. But I wasn't a fan of the greens. The capers and olives made it too salty. 2.5/5

Griddle Bread Pudding:
The only dessert item they have. Banking on a sole item is ballsy and I commend the Slo-Boy peeps because it's absolutely delicious! It's safe to say that it is the best bread pudding I've had in years. Warm, slightly crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside...swimming in sweet syrup and caramel. Oh yes, lawd! 5/5

I'd have to come back for the carrots...and more bread pudding.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,15,9,4,MHaDq8Jech5DWFA5XHHXgg
5541640,2016-02-25,0,wZCdr3iLTE6aa9kiVxWJWQ,The best veggies downtown. Justin does an amazing job with so many lovely choices of vegetables .the price is nice. You are getting quality food. I'll pay for healthy. I prefer none meat items and non dairy and I still have a great selection there!

5548064,2016-02-16,0,wZCdr3iLTE6aa9kiVxWJWQ,"Farm to table concept, Justin hand picks all his ingredients and gives each item its unique and well deserved love and care. The Harissa carrots were probably my favorite thing... That's a big deal for a meat lover like me, but don't get me wrong the tri tip was nothing short of amazing but I devour meat regardless of how it's prepared! The carrots were soft with a light bite and the sunflower seeds gave the right amount of crunch and texture that you're looking for, the spices were bold enough to get the message across. I tried both sauces, the BBQ and the jalepeno cilantro (and the carrots cream sauce too, oops) and I actually ended up dunking everything in all three sauces and it was phenomenal. I was stuff and satisfied. This was my first visit to SloBoy last week, today I had the sunny side dandelions sandwich style with porchetta bits. The egg served as my main protein and it was velvety and perfect with the dandelion greens (my first time trying them), which had a nice crunch and were warm and yummy! Would have liked a heartier bread but then again I created my own item off their menu items essentially so I can't complain! But that's just a minor ""what if"" moment but I was thoroughly satisfied with another SloBoy item. We ended up ordering a griddle bread pudding with an add on of foie (again another first) and the initial thought of duck liver didn't sound appetizing especially on bread pudding but it worked? An elevated and sophisticated yet equally comforting combo of salty & sweet. Definitely worth a try!",q8rjyleuk_jimFj9SoAm4g,1,1,5,gvRh6O8DLAK1uRUMTTQ77g

I've been coming to this location since it was The Goodwich and it's latest stand as SLO-Boy definitely is like GW's little brother, sharing amazing flavor genes.  

I had the Porchetta & Potatoes while she had the Tri-Tip & Carrots.  Holy f-balls! I wasn't sure what to expect, and after eating, I want to go back for more!

Great meal!",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,0,0,5,xoJZZtOJ7pvvder2LAVCCw

5918634,2016-05-25,4,wZCdr3iLTE6aa9kiVxWJWQ,"I learned through Facebook recently that Slo-Boy, this relatively new eatery operating out of a small shack, and dubbed the Goodwich culinary incubator is shuttering their operation by this Saturday.  This came as quite a surprise to me, as the majority of the reviews are very favorable.

So after planning my itinerary of errands to run near the downtown Las Vegas area, I dropped by for a quick lunch before methodically working through the rest of my short list of To-Dos.

When I arrived at the former Goodwich shack, I initially thought I was at the wrong place, since the decoration and name on the shack still bear the the previous tenant's name and robotic decorative art. But after looking at the clipboard with their well worn menu I confirmed that I was at the right spot.

I did a little research before arriving and was set to try the Bucky Duck, but it was crossed off with a marker. Actually the menu has a few items already crossed off (they are working through their inventory to 86 every menu item by the time they close on Saturday is my guess), so I am not sure what the operator of Slo-Boy's next plan for the business will be once this iteration of the business phase comes to an end. 

So here are the items I finally settled on:

Coq Au (Banh-Mi)
Red wine braised chicken leg, country spread, pickled veggies, red pepper mayo, fresh herbs on a hoagie roll.
From the first bite I tasted the red wine used in braising the chicken thigh, but I was not a fan of the texture of the chicken. The herbs used was fresh, and the country spread and pickled veggies  goes well in this classical French meets colonial French Indochine comfort food fusion combination.

For dessert I went with the people's choice winner the Griddle Bread Pudding.
Thick cut of whiskey bread pudding, pressed then seared on the flat top with butter, drizzled with salted caramel sauce. It was very good and if it was served on a nice plate at a linen table with proper metal forks it can easily feel right at home in a brick and mortar restaurant. This item I will miss for sure.

Anyway, if you haven't tried Slo-Boy or want to get your last crack at it, be sure to reshuffle your priorities and head on over before they close Saturday. This is your last call notification.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,5,3,eIYF44iHun4RAGcuZUqrsQ
