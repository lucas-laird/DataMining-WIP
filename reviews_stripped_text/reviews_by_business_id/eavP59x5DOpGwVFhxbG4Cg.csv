The presentation of the coffee is terrific- they bring you a small glass carafe and a tall glass of ice. The carafe has an inch of sweetened condensed milk in the bottom, and on top is a small metal contraption that is actually a mini french press. Push down on the plunger, and excellent, fresh-brewed, double strength Vietnamese coffee filters into the carafe. Mix the coffee with the condensed milk and pour it over the ice- yum! Very refreshing!

The sandwich was excellent as well- a crispy roll stuffed with grilled marinated pork (I think they only offer pork), with julienned pickled veggies, cilantro, jalapenos, and mayo. The sandwich was not huge (it's on their appetizer menu), but with the coffee, made a nice, cool, flavorful meal. I don't like to stuff myself at restaurants anyway, unless I'm eating pizza.

I can't comment on the pho, as I haven't tried it yet. I did try the chicken curry once, and it was so-so, several pieces of mystery chicken parts (butts?), in a generic sauce with only onions and potatoes. Not bad, but not good, either.

While I was there, a large Viet family came in, and everyone ordered the same dish- the roasted 1/2 chicken with tomato rice. Maybe they know something about the pho!

I can't believe this is the only Vietnamese restaurant on the strip- I don't think that situation will last. Meanwhile, this spot will do.

Open late (it's VEGAS, baby!).

I'd definitely come back here for a sandwich and iced coffee.",pc9soq3EK0LP0J4JMYpWBQ,1,1,3,VDtisMiDjaLa45LQvTbSZQ

We got here early evening and found the place not too crowded and were seated promptly. We ordered the Vietnamese beef stew (hu tieu bo kho) and lemongrass beef over noodle salad (bun bo xao). The food was plentiful and fresh. However, it definitely lacked flavor. The beef stew was light tasting of plain beef broth rather than something more substantial... Large and varied cuts of beef were given so that was nice. The lemongrass beef over vermicelli tasted pretty good, but the nuoc cham felt watered down and lacked flavor- rather more of a sweet liquid than the umami-imparting concoction often served.

Most items are overpriced compare to any normal LA/LV Vietnamese restaurant (e.g. rare beef pho that normally cost about $6 will be $12 here) being in the casino. And yet it's still considerably less than being ripped off by the $$$ restaurants. 

My friend and I went there for a quick after-arrival dinner on Monday night. We ordered rare beef pho, beef stew and rice, and a pork/shrimp spring roll, 1 martini, and 1 Thai Ice tea. The total bill comes over $50. The waiter was extremely slow - he seemed to be the only one there and comes around every 20 minutes. The hostess was friendly and would chat with us about LA to distract us from the absence of the waiter. Overall it is quiet enough so you can enjoy a normal dinner conversation. 

The portion is like any normal large size pho. The other dishes are also in descent portions. The taste of the pho is one on the lower end compared to normal pho restaurants. That being said, if you need your normal dose of Asian food, it's edible and comfy.

After successfully convincing your friends that Sbarros pizza is an insult to food, you opt for one of the best keno-offering combo-kitchens in America: The Coffee Shop at TI/Pho Vietnamese Cuisine. You wait for what seems like ages to be seated and have your order taken, and the extra wait gives you plenty of time to search over the long menu.  Fortunately, you don't have to search long because you know exactly what you want. Your decision has been calculated based off the following facts:

1. Most Vegas food leaves you feeling bloated the at the pool the next day. 
2. Food option at 2:00am lack nutrition and variety, and you really don't want to resort to a $7 bag of trail mix from CVS.
3. You are looking for something filling yet inexpensive (~$13).
4. Vegetable options and vegetarian friendly dishes in Vegas are limited (although the mushroom burger at shake shack is a game changer). 
5. The menu offers enough options (from Pancakes to Pho) that even the pickiest of eaters can't complain. 

With that in mind, it's no wonder you wonder that you order the Bun Chay (Mushrooms and Tofu over Vermicelli rice noodles and Vegetables).

  Considering that my brother in law is Vietnamese and likes to cook, I'm suddenly disappointed that this was my first exposure.  B.I.L. said the Bun Bo Xao I ordered was going to be excellent and advised me to use the chili and Hoisin Sauce as well as add an order of spring rolls.  The food came out fast and very fresh but was underwhelming in taste.  Good value when considering price/portion size in the Casino.

  Most disappointing was the service.  My server was nice but it took forever for her to come around.  Tables around me kept asking the hostess for things and she would tell them to wait a minute until the server came back.  It was also very distracting how controlling she was over the way people would enter and exit the restaurant.  When a party of 7 came in she acted as though it was surprising a large party would come in at 10pm (in Vegas!) and would need time to get tables together to accommodate them.

  I'm giving them 3 stars since I can't say I've had better Vietnamese food although I have had much better service.  I would probably give them another shot with the proper food guide to accompany me.",eNqxRmFVWvr6z6dNoX_Jmw,0,0,3,_CTL-wPZsEbvoZpuQDFRVQ

Tasty. But 12 dollars a bowl tasty? I could let this slide, but the fact that we ordered a second dish is what took this place from four to three stars.

The walnut shrimp consisted of exactly 5 sweet (and yummy) shrimp in the Chinese-American style you're probably imagining. It was over twenty dollars. Really?

Plus, I couldn't justify myself paying for such yucky pho for $12!!! Holy crap the most expensive pho I have ever paid for.

2060089,2010-01-16,1,eavP59x5DOpGwVFhxbG4Cg,"Is it worth $11 for a bowl of pho in a vegas hotel??  

We decided to find out!  After driving to vegas, we were starving since we had only eaten a late breakfast and no lunch.  As we were walking to check in at Treasure Island, we passed the coffee shop & the pho restaurant (part of the coffee shop) getting a whiff of the aromatic broth.  It instantly triggered my rumbling stomach!  After checking in, we went straight to the pho restaurant to eat.

There's usually a short wait to eat here as opposed to the rest of the coffee shop.  I think just the idea of being able to get pho in your own hotel is reason enough for people to go here.  Looking at the menu, I think the cheapest thing was about $8 dollars but most items are $10 or more.  They have simple pho dishes but also rice dishes, spring rolls, egg rolls and one sandwich.  We opted for standard pho tai at $10.95 a bowl.  

I'm so used to having my bowl of pho served in less than five minutes so it was a bit weird waiting.  The pho itself is decent.  Noodles were medium firm, broth had good flavor but was a little peppery.  It was a pretty good size bowl as well.  But of course, paying twice as much for pho may leave a bad taste in your mouth, hehe.  

It's nice to see something besides bad chinese food or a weird attempt at fine Asian cuisine in a hotel.  I say that if you're really hungry and too tired/lazy to force yourself to go out, then it's worth it.  Most meals (besides fast food or food court) will cost you the same or even more.",GVYg18F-Rkuk63hvtHoG5Q,2,1,3,Evt5rO5cIk_5OiWOnr_PKg

So on day three with my parents in LV, i finally tried the Pho. I invited my aunt who lives in LV. We ordered:

-Charboiled Pork Chop w/ Rice (was ok and probably the best rice plate here)
-Beef Stew Noodle Soup (OMG. Reminded me of drinking soy sauce)
-Seafood Noodle (Seafood has calamari, shrimp, and scallop. This was the best order from this place. But also the most expensive 15.95)
-Special Marinated Chicken w/Fried Rice (Actually red rice. Chicken was good, but not the best)
-Authentic Viet. Egg Rolls (was small and good)
-Pork and Shrimp Spring Rolls (very good, best appetizer here)
-Thai Iced Tea (was good, but didn't have the cinnamon/anise kick to it.)

This place shares the area with the cafe next to it (The Coffee Shop). I noticed they also cycle their waitresses/waiters. Service is slow, but quicker than the cafe. So it must be the chefs. 

If your limited to Treasure Island for restaurants, then too bad. Go to Isla instead. Chinatown has way better Pho and is on same street (Sping Mtn) as TI.",C-SWoDra9V6R16Yy_VaPYw,1,1,2,-DAsby83uq54akaP9z1l0g

The service is wonderful. Why? Because I am Vietnamese and I do have quite a few of request for my bowl of Pho. =)

Key thing to remember, is to ask them to make the broth extra hot if you are ordering a bowl of pho.  First time, it was very moderate.  I like to order my rare beef on the side and sadly, the first time, it was not hot enough to cook my beef slices.  Since then with the requests, it has been very hot.  I have also tried their chicken curry on rice.  Very excellent, lots of chicken and the curry was just right (potatoes and carrots cooked till tender).  My buddy had their short rib rice plate and insisted that it was very well done and mentioned that ""it is hard to find a decent place still open at 1am to serve short ribs.""  I once had their Hu Tieu Bo Kho (Beef stew noodles).  For them to make it right in an american hotel.. Thank you! The meat was absolutely tender just how it should be made.  The pho noodles may stick so it's best if you stir it up once you get served.  The broth was not too thick and not too loose.  Perfect stew.  

Yes, I do make my server work; pho tai, extra beef, on the side, extra hot broth, extra slice onions on the side, and steamed beans sprouts.  This $12 bowl of pho will be worth it!

If you are a coffee person, please note, that they use old school asian coffee filters.  It is the slow one that is on top of your cup.  Slowly dripping into your cup.. If you are in a hurry for a jumpstart.. Not recommended.

It is true, hard to find a Pho place that is open late.  Not to mention that it is conveniently inside the casino (no driving necessary).  Great place to hit up after drinking.  Pho is a pretty good hangover remedy.  Place is very big and the service is top notch.  Not too busy.

I just came in from LA, craved something I would get back at home, and thought how bad can it be... it does have that fancy motto outside saying how great they are on the Vegas strip.  Big mistake.

Pros :
Servers were quick on getting the drinks.  

Portion was large for a pho bowl... they give lots of the weird tendons and meat stuff.  Pretty generous on that.

Cons :
Just didn't taste like Pho.  I was a bit weary when we sat down and my friend who is Vietnamese said it's strange to see fish sauce in the condiment section.  Once he had a few slurps of the soup, he said that the chef did not add little to any fish sauce.  I tasted my bowl, and yup.. flavor is way off.  You will need to add fish sauce back.  (Think of it as Clam chowder, but someone forgot to add the pepper)  

Soup was medium warm.  Yes, the biggest mistake of getting served pho is that the soup isn't burning hot (otherwise the meat is undercooked).  My butt paid for it the next morning because the meat wasn't cooked all the way through... I've had beef tar tar before, and thought this couldn't be that bad.  Expect lots of gas pains, and possible angry bowel movements due to uncooked meat.  

I hope this place starts adding fish sauce into the broth, and heat the soup up.  (Maybe they are scared that someone may be burned or something).",3TrFkZCpqCezod4Slinu6g,0,0,2,mc9Cv2JSbmXn_OA9GxXWHw

After a Saturday night that went on for far too long, my friend desperately needed some pho to flush out his veins.

The egg rolls were soggy and tasteless. The fish sauce was bland. I ordered a Thai iced tea, and it tasted like it had been half diluted with toilet water. The pho was actually the worst part. We both ordered Pho Tai, which has thin slices of rare beef. Not only was the broth tasteless, the slices of rare beef were all still stuck together in one chunk--as if they bought a chunk of pre-sliced frozen beef, and were too lazy to separate them in the soup. Worse, the broth was lukewarm when it arrived at my table. I immediately submerged the raw beef underneath the noodles in a desperate attempt at a decent meal, yet the middle slices remained rare and stuck together. The cost of our meal (one order of egg rolls, two drinks, two pho bowls): $50.

Otherwise the service and price for the food deserves only 2 stars. We waited a good 20 minutes before our drinks server told us that our waiter ""isn't here yet"" (?) and that she would get the manager to serve us.

It's ridiculous to hear about this kind of waiter-turf-war going on in a restaurant where other waiters aren't willing to serve other tables because it's not part of their responsibility. After that, the food took another good 40 minutes or so to arrive.

This is definitely not it.

Hungover, my friends wanted some pho soup and the closest pho restaurant was this place.

We looked all around TI and finally realized it was located within TI's Coffee Shop.

First, you should know I am NEVER an advocate of restaurant pho. It is almost always loaded with MSG and that never makes me feel any better after a night of partying. 
So I asked the waitress if the ""authentic"" vietnamese chef put MSG in their pho broth and she said they did.

Pass. I got the Egg Roll noodles with fish sauce instead. My two friends both got pho tai.

OKAY. So I know everything in Vegas is expensive but $10 for a bowl of pho? $11 for mine? $5 for an iced Vietnamese coffee? Highway robbery!

And the food was so gross too. Authentic Vietnamese chef? Not possible. My meal literally only had lettuce, carrots, noodles and egg rolls. Where's the cilantro, the MINT, the flavor?  The egg rolls in my meal just tasted so NOT Vietnamese, as if the oil they used to fry the egg rolls came from McDonalds or something. Plus, NONE of the dishes had any flavor.

My friends added every condiment on the table in their pho. Fish sauce, lemon, spicy red sauce, SALT, you name it. Anything to make it taste better.

Gross.

Gross and expensive.

But 2 stars because their Iced Vietnamese Coffee was great! Really hit the spot :) even came in the dripping machine. Takes a while to let it finish, but it was worth it.

I got a noodle dish and my boyfriend got actual pho.  Neither of us were thrilled.  We ate our meals, but never really had anything positive to say about them.  I think the chicken in my boyfriend's pho had bones (something he simply didn't know to expect).

I think it's great that there's a pho place on this side of the strip. Technically, the pho shop is now joint to the Coffee Shop at TI so you can order eggs and bacon with your pho too.

I've been here a few times already at various hours of the day. If you can get here at an off hour, service would be much better. Most recently, we came here on Christmas Eve for lunch and although we got seated early, we had to wait about 10 minutes for our server to finally come around for the first time and ask if we wanted anything to drink. The food came another 20 minutes after that.

The food itself is a obviously higher-priced because of the location. For what you're paying I do think you're getting a pretty good sized portion and if you're not super hungry you can probably even share a bowl or a plate with a friend or family member. Don't expect the best and most authentic Vietnamese food in the world, but it's actually pretty good. Enough to satiate the asian food crave, if that's what you want.

2758428,2009-12-22,0,eavP59x5DOpGwVFhxbG4Cg,"Ok, like other reviewers, I come from places where there are pho restaurants everywhere and yet I flew across the country to the desert to get Vietnamese soup noodles.

I decided to get Pho here after the Mystere performance. I believe they are open until 2:30AM so it was a very nice convenient place to get something warm on a cold night in the winter. Let me premise this review  by saying that I've had a lot of pho. I mean A LOT. If you are what you eat, I would be a bowl of pho, tripe, and meatballs the size of  Los Angeles.

Ok, so if you're coming here for pho and you come from a big city like Los Angeles or San Francisco, then your expectations are too high. Their menu is limited in terms of the ""fancier"" and more adventurous meats (like tripe). Most of their set bowls come with only 1 type of meat and the price of each bowl changes with different types of meats. That is different from most other pho places where there is a set price regardless of what you put in there. 

Be prepared! It's expensive (but are you really surprised when eating pho in a Las Vegas hotel?) It's about 12 bucks a bowl unless you get the super special bowl (with all the meats they offer including meat balls, tendon and raw beef) which is 14. Their pho soup base was really sweet in comparison to what I am used to. For me, this was bad since I'm not accustomed to really sweet pho soup, but it wasn't really a deal breaker). They only have 1 size bowls and I would say that it isn't a particularly large bowl. 

In addition to pho, they have other Vietnamese dishes as well (rise and other noodle dishes and spring rolls) but I can't really comment on these since I didn't eat them. Since they are connected to the cafe next door, you can also order off the menu from the next door cafe (which serves traditional American type foods). This is especially good when you have people in your party who are not particularly fond of Vietnamese food.

Also, keep in mind that this is not your traditional pho restaurant... the waiters are not Vietnamese. In fact most are hispanic. So if you ask for anything strange, most of them don't know what you're talking about. 

Overall the service was great and what you would expect from a Las Vegas restaurant. If you desperately want pho, this is your place on the strip, but with so many other delicious foods on the strip, go get something new!",X_DkwPTzdO_VWzUcbUXREg,0,0,3,KJkVirMqTePO1vdEhjlHEQ

This place advertises "" the most authentic Vietnamese Pho on the strip"" and it has a long way to go before being able to carry that title.  I had the The house special Pho which was pretty much the everything bowl and the order of spring rolls.

Cons: Broth is not hot enough, combined with the fact that the noodles are not cooked in advanced and relies on the broth to cook it the noodles end up al dente. The fist warning I got when seated was that there is fish sauce on the table which is something you should not see, I mentioned to my friend that the only reason they would need that on the table is if someone asked for it because the broth is bland and sure enough the broth was bland and I needed to add fish sauce. Unlike hot sauce or the hoison sauce, this is a key ingredient to making the broth and is not something you should have to use as a season to liking. I ordered in Vietnamese and the waiter looked at me and asked me what number it was. It is important to have your waiters know the names of the dishes they are serving especially if you are claiming to be authentic. It left me wondering if someone new to the cuisine ask the waiter what they suggested would be steered in the wrong direction and leaving them completely turned off to this type of cuisine. The spring rolls were over bloated with noodles and drowning out the taste of any other items in the roll and the peanut saace was bland and lacking.

Pros: Service was prompt and they check up on you making sure drinks are refilled.
 as far as price goes they are ok compared to others. They are not sparse on the meat. Plenty of meat which is a good thing and they seemed to have more tripe and tendon. Maybe they put a lot because not too many of their customers order these ingredients ( I had the everything bowl). Atmosphere and ambiance of the place is great felt a little more Japanese / Chinese but most pho places are dive joints anyways. 

Overall lasting impressions: I will not be going here again. I like my meat rare so it was fine for me but to most people the broth was not hot enough leaving the rare beef to be really pink and would gross most people out. On top of that the broth cooks the noodles as well since the broth is not really hot the noodles were not cooked all the way through. Al dente rice noodles really upset mine and my friends stomach. As mentioned before I worry that people will go here and being turned off to the whole vietnamese cuisine because they are taking the places claim to being authentic or misguided by the staffs lack of knowledge of the cuisine.

Suggestions to place: Cook noodles separately just before preparing the bowl, make broth at a higher temperature, add more seasoning in broth as it is cooking. educate the the staff on the dishes.",OAJJGR-bLwrkP3kTkjO67g,0,0,2,u-BaakQgXOffj-yrllDj2g

They were a tasty affair - the bread rolls were crispy, grilled meat delectable, overkill cilantro was in there, and hot green peppers too. I've had the pho before too, it's decent and you're given mint and bean sprouts on the side.

Our server (Catalina) was helpful and friendly. When she brought over the shots of Hennessey (!) we ordered, were surprised to see generous portions of alcohol.

Recommended. I would return (actually, I already have!), partially for the novelty, and definitely for the refreshing brunch of Vietnamese cuisine.",6s-g2vFu12OemhiK3FJuOQ,2,1,4,3wxj3PlpQaN8Awzj23EUsg

We both ordered the the most common one that has everything in it (beef, beef tendon, tripes and so on) and it was 'alright' This place would probably be worth it to some people, if they are in of pho, right at the moment.

The waitress took forever to just get our bills. I mean seriously what was she doing? Or what were THEY doing? where are all the little old waitresses? I'm not giving them a hard time, I smiled when they came, I asked nicely when I needed things but this is just too much.

There was a genuine lack of commitment here to the pho cuisine. 

When our server arrived, she was brusque and dismissive. When I ordered the vegetarian bahn mai, she blinked and said there was no such item. I politely indicated that it is located on the menu outside the door. She simply said, ""no."" No?

Since there were precious few other vegetarian options, I told her I would only be ordering the vegetarian spring rolls. She could have cared less about making a sale, checking the menu (about ten steps outside the door), or inquiring with the chef. She marched away. 

The spring rolls were adequate. The vermicelli inside (I think) was a bit over-cooked and mushy but the fried tofu was a nice touch. My boyfriend's bahn mai looked and smelled delicious! Crusty french roll, tasty beef, and refreshing carrots & cucumber. I'm fairly certain that the vegetarian bahn mai was supposed to have this tofu. How disappointing.

I also had a Thai iced tea instead of the soda and they were nice enough to make the swap for no extra charge, even when I said i wouldn't mind if they did when I ordered.

Perhaps I would have been more critical if I had ordered a beef soup rather than chicken as I've only had one or two orders chicken pho previously.

No, it was not outstanding. Yes, it was pricier than your local pho shop back home (assuming you have one).

Usually, it's a cheap meal that is satisfying both to the stomach and the wallet. I know that everything is marked up in Vegas, but this place was extremely disappointing in both service and food quality. We were staying at the Palazzo across the street so we thought it would be a good idea to make a quick walk across the street for some pho. I know, it's so typical that us Asians have to get Asian food even in Vegas. 

We have a pretty large party of 12 so we end up waiting about 20 minutes for a table. Then when we are finally seated, we are separated into two parties of six, which would've been fine until my group was seated in the back of the restaurant, where there were plenty of tables and seats. On top of that, our waitress took forever to even greet us and bring us drinks. When we finally ordered, the food came out more disappointing than the service. 

You know the pho isn't going to be that good when the beef slices are stuck together. They're supposed to be thinly sliced. It looked as if they had been frozen and tossed into the boiling broth to cook quickly, but stuck together because they were never separated. The broth was below average  and everything was just off. Then we ended up paying a premium for our meal and got the hell out of there. For that price, we might as well have paid the extra money to eat at a buffet. The portions are also small so I was still hungry after finishing the bowl. Pho at TI is just terrible.

We knew since we had a lot of people it would take longer to get food but the amount of time was more than anyone would want to wait. The server was running around and didn't seem to know what she was doing. We arrived at 600 and the torture began. I ordered a noodle soup which many of the girls ordered as well. My cousin ordered chicken. When the chicken came she found a short hair in her rice. The server took the plate away and then brought her a new one but by this time we were all halfway done. Another girl in our party was shocked to find a long light colored hair in her dish as well. My cousin called the manager and the manager response was ""the cooks wear hats"" which almost seemed like she was accusing us of putting the hair in the food.

Not only do they not have a variety (no tendon, brisket, etc.), but the broth itself is so bland and boring.  Pho is known for that distinct, pungent smell that sticks to your clothes for the rest of the day.  Pho is known for the broth that gives it that zing! each time you take a bite.  This place does not have any of those things.  Luckily, we were getting our meal comped at this place.  I would've been outraged if I had to pay for this crap!  Their egg rolls were good, but no where near enough to make up for what they call their ""pho.""

I'd never eat at this place ever again.  If pho is absolutely the only thing that will cure my hangover (which most of the time, it is), then I'd rather travel a few miles and eat at Pho Kim Long on Spring Mountain Rd.

Somehow in the back of my head, I had Pho at TI in the back of my head. I blame Simon C for telling me repeatedly how much he loved it and even went three times in a trip.

Now, we're both from L.A. But the difference is I have access to many wonderful pho shops in the SGV. He's from West LA where there aren't many pho shops (operated by Vietnamese and not the Korean pho shops). Let's consider this because I apparently didn't when I went to Pho.

It was pretty busy but we were seated by the giggling hostess who just could not stop laughing or dare I say it, twittering? I knew it'd be expensive but not $45 expensive. And we didn't even have alcohol!

We started with spring rolls ($8.50). Um, there were two and they weren't very good. Plus, they were on the much smaller side. The peanut sauce was NOT tasty. I also had a Thai Iced Tea. $4.50? What is this crazy pricing? It wasn't sweet which would probably be a good thing as I don't like super sweet drinks but it's a Thai iced tea and it was just not proper. Oh well, right?

The gay boyfriend had the shredded chicken pho which was apparently good minus all the bones in it. I had the beef stew pho. The beansprouts and basil that came to the table was a bit wilted and dried out. My stew was good but not spicy at all. At least they had all the proper condiments on the table. You would be glad to know they used all parts of the cow including tendon.

Both bowls of pho were almost $10 each. There's something incredibly pricey about this considering the Pho shop is part of the coffee shop at TI!

Service was okay, they switched waitresses on us midway and the now laughing insanely hostess at first wouldn't take our check but we were in a big hurry to get to the show. The beverage girl snapped at us she wasn't our server when we tried to order our food from her.

I can say with much confidence that this is probably the cleanest pho restaurant you'll ever venture into.  Obviously, being located in a glorified Las Vegas casino means superb cleanliness and inflated prices.  But surprisingly, Pho still holds true to some of its typical Vietnamese restaurant roots, those being:

* Sriracha, hoisin sauce, and fish sauce were found at every table 
* Chopsticks, spoons, and sauce platters were well-stocked at each table
* Despite having only 20 items on their menu, our white lady server looked at me weird when I called out the dish name, and proceeded to ask for the item number instead -- just like in Vietnamese restaurants!

Prices are definitely atypical of Vietnamese restaurants though.  $10 bowls of pho, $4.50 Vietnamese coffee, and get this, $9 banh mi!  The beef pho was not bad at all.  The broth was light and had a good clean taste.  My beef stew pho kho was tasty, but too thick and gravy-like.  The soups weren't scalding hot like I prefer, but we made do.  It's a fairly decent meal for Strip standards.

There is no other casual Vietnamese restaurant on the Strip.  Pho is all you've got.  It's all about convenience.  Time is money in Vegas, and that money should be used to gamble...not spent driving to Chinatown, wasting gas and your precious time in Strip traffic to get the same average-quality Vietnamese food.

Good size serving of the usual veggies on the side.
Unlike most Vegas food prices it wasn't exorbitant, higher than SoCal but not bad considering the normal Vegas markup.

None really...

T.I. took their cafe/diner and split it in half to create Pho, to get with the emerging popularity of the dish or to attract more Asian clientel to gamble.  It has a sampling of Vietnamese dishes, like Pho Tai and Pho Ga (those are the only 2 Pho soups, no brisket, tendon, meatballs, etc) and a smattering of rice plates and other dishes. Expect to pay double for any of these dishes as you would pay in California in San Jose or Little Saigon. 

Desparate Pho lovers without a car who are staying at T.I. might eat here in a pinch. If you drove due west from T.I. about 2 long Vegas blocks on Spring Mountain and Valley View, you would have several Pho places to choose from (and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Thai, etc.)  You could spend the extra cost charged at this place on Cab fair to eat at a real Vietnamese or Asian restaurant!",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,4,2,2,5MkhTSr-XtiBcRMB-W5xRQ

Also a small cup of Hosin sauce and Tabasco (WTF)!!  They gave me the sweet chilli sauce, you know the one you dip your egg rolls. (don't think I'm putting that in my soup)

Anyways so I proceeded to pour the booth over my noodle. Guess what?? the soup was lukewarm, the rare beef barely cook. I called room service to bring me another hot booth but now I needed more Hosin sauce aaah forget it.

Yes, it's real Vietnamese.  Yes it's expensive, but you're eating on The Strip.  I'm sure you could find something cheaper off strip, but by the time you pay for a cab, you just spent the same money.  Deal with it.  The portions (not counting the pho itself) are pretty large, so when you order a bowl of the chicken curry dish , it comes out in the same bigass bowl the pho does.  Add in the ""Strip tax"" and the portions, and you're not doing as bad as you think.

Speaking of the curry?  It was pretty good.  Not as hot as I'd like, but still pretty flavorful.  And the namesake pho they serve?  Not the best pho I've ever had, but I've got a lot to choose from due to living near a sizable Viet population, but it was certainly not bad at all.  Given the nature of the place, it was doing just fine, and I'd still recommend it.  Had a few other things, all of which were decent.  

That said. . .  do NOT order the Thai iced tea.  It's horrible.  Possibly the worst $4 I ever spent.  Tea was weak, coconut milk tasted a little off. . . just bad all around.  I should have sent it back.  

As for the service, we didn't have any problems at all.  Sure it was a little weird going to a Vietnamese place and not having the family owners wait on me, but then again, it's weird to see a casino outside too.  In general, though, the environment was decently tucked in, and we had a good experience with everything.

I'd go back, and that says a lot for Vegas, given how many choices there are.  It's a nice diversion from most of the other strip options, and can be a nice fresh option when you've eaten a lot of, well, crap (often tasty crap, but that doesn't make it healthy) elsewhere on the Strip.  It's not the most authentic place I've ever been to, and you'll be disappointed if you think of it that way going in.  If you take it for what it is, though, which is sort of the Chevy's of Vietnamese, you'll be quite happy.  Remember, not everyone is from LA, the Bay Area, Portland, Seattle, NYC, North Phoenix or Washington, DC (did I miss anywhere?).

Besides, being in TI, you have the option of grabbing dinner before seeing Mystere, or after seeing the Sirens.

I stayed at TI with my girlfriends, and we wanted to eat something before going to Hakkasan. We did not have much time, so we decided to eat here since this was right by the lobby in TI.
I wanted something oily but not American, so I ordered the egg roll Bun. It looked good. The egg rolls were not bad, but... The dipping cause had no flavor... I added Hoisin sauce and Sriracha to my Bun to make it edible, but I could not save it... I just ate the egg rolls and left everything else... So, basically I paid $16+tax for the egg rolls. 

At least, the egg rolls gave me enough energy to dance all night..? Or maybe even that was thanks to alcohol.

I ordered the beef soup. It came out.. and it was very... meh. The broth was not the greatest.. there was barely any meat.. and just overall, the 12-13 dollar  bowl of Pho was not worth its money. I've had better for $4 in Philly.... but I was pretty disappointed. At the time, I didn't care, since I was so hungry, but looking back.. it wasn't so great.

OK.. so when I first came to Treasure Island and saw that there was a Pho restaurant next to their cafe, I was greatly puzzled.  The idea of there being a pho restaurant inside a Vegas casino, which has a pirates theme was just very puzzling and odd to me.  

So... I understand peoples reviews of how this place is not authentic and what not.. but c'mon ppl... You REALLLLY think that Treasure Island will serve dank-ass PHO that will probably stink up the whole entire casino and seep into the hotel rooms?!?!  I think they know better than that.  

On that note... there have been numerous times when I woke up in the morning and stumbled down to this pho place and had the noodles and soup help me recover from my hangover.  

Yes, the service can be slow.  So be prepared for that... and yeah, the fish sauce is not as potent and the pho soup is not as potent but.. it does the job.

The noodles were all right, but again, there seemed to be no flavor even though I added sprouts, basil, jalapeno, hoisin, lime juice, and a sriracha knock-off.

What's even worse is that the pho was more than $10! Scratch that, it was about $11! Total rip-off when I know that great-tasting pho exists for about $3! I guess this is the only way that Treasure Island can think of appeasing the Asians that visit, but it's a sad substitution for good ole Westminster pho.

My mom got an order of fried rice, or something like that. It was rice with a tint of orange, and it was pretty bad, I have to say. The rice was sticky! Sticky? Yes! Sushi-rice-sticky! It was definitely not prepared how rice is supposed to be prepared, and thus I didn't even want to take another bite.

Avoid this place if you're picky about your Vietnamese cuisine. In fact, just avoid it at all costs! Tasteless food, overpriced, and definitely not worth it!",RPgHIlmwH0F-mlg6Ny42og,2,0,1,C99tFwzm75sMDwooalbJEQ

We asked for a table for 3 and the hostess said it might be 15 minutes which was fine. But what kinda piss me off was that she told us to move back, like we here in someone's way. Huh? It's not like the waiter has to walk pass us to get to a table. Or someone behind us would get a table before us. In any case eventually the she became pretty nice to us.

5704870,2008-04-26,0,eavP59x5DOpGwVFhxbG4Cg,"My boyfriend and I went to Vegas this past weekend.  We like to try foods we like in different cities when we travel.  I read some yelp reviews so I decided to give this place a try.  My boyfriend ordered chicken pho and I got bun chay (vegetarian vermicelli noodles).

I had a taste of his pho and the broth was good, I didn't expect much considering it's in Treasure Island.  It's not as flavorful as we normally have it back home, but it wasn't bland.  I know some cooks prefer to use less spice for chicken pho than beef pho to distinguish the taste.  I make chicken pho quite often at home and I use the same spices that's used in beef pho.  My preference I guess.
They brought out a plate with basil, bean sprouts, limes and jalapeno peppers.  The basils had some bruising so the ugly leaves were discarded.  I know nothing compares to like being in California, we have very fresh herbs.  I think they tried to make up for the basils by giving my boyfriend 4 lime pieces and at least 10 jalapeno pepper slices.  Amazing.  

As for my dish, it was good.  I've never had vegetarian bun before.  I got used to the mushroom in replacement for meats.  They brought out 2 sides of fish sauces for dipping.  Yummmy

The vermicelli noodles were maybe a tad overcooked, I like elasticity with any noodles I eat.  I sometimes overcook my vermicelli noodles at home too so I can forgive them.  Honest mistake I guess.

My dish was so big I couldn't even finish it.  I think I ate half.  I do not like wasting food one bit.  But you can't force yourself to eat.  

Oh, and cafe sua da was $4.50 and my boyfriend got a few sips in.  It was very good however.

Overall, I liked it.  I think it's good for what it is.  I know there must be better places in Vegas for pho but save yourself gas money or cab fare. 

The decor is so nice, clean, quiet, a surprising change for eating Vietnamese food.  

I had a good time, try it, you might like it.

Don't expect a big menu, it's VERY limited.
It's a small place.

Good luck!",-iLraofHcQqil1zScbWl4A,0,0,4,vYvaR622ebbww_dpI2KEOg

This restaurant has combined American with Vietnamese dishes. In the past they had it separated into 2 different restaurants. 

It was someones great idea to save on operating costs and combine the 2 places. I think that was a mistake.

The American menu was tiny, It hardly had any selections of different meals.

I ordered the turkey club sandwich with no mayo. It was dry and it tasted bland.
I could have had a better meal at subway. 

My brother had a cheese burger and he had to drown it with ketchup to get any flavor out of it.

Service was the worst I have ever seen and the waitress was rude.

I was surprised by the amount of limes they provided because I'm so used to seeing one lime slice per person.  The service was OKAY, apparently our server was ""busy"" so another person took our order.  It took a while to get our pho, and it took forever to get my change back when we were paying.

Such a strange place to get good, authentic Pho (in a coffee shop filled with people eating burgers), but it never disappoints. Over the years I have probably been to this place 10 times, including TWICE this past week.  The pho is tasty, (I like the Pho Ga and the Pho Thai)  The broth is authentic and deep with flavors. The noodles are well prepared and match well with the broth.  They bring a plate with other toppings to add, and unlike many Pho places they include a healthy pile of sliced jalapenos that along with the lime really bring the dish together.

The staff is nice, they do a good job. I generally go there late afternoon and there is never a wait.  Very good, inexpensive Vegas strip meal that I never miss when I am out that way.",Sj9wrHrlnt_pmrWit5RyWg,0,0,5,LUrnWjZLS84T0CDvrPRtow

I arrived in the afternoon, just in time for their lunch special, which is available Monday-Thursday until 5PM. It consisted of a small appetizer, bowl of pho, and drink- either soda or ice tea. 

I started with the sweet and sour shrimp appetizer. The batter wasn't that great, but the accompanying salsa was tasty. I ordered the pho tai. They only have one size, which I would consider small or regular size, but it's big enough for me. There was a good amount of noodles, and the broth had a good flavor. My only complaint ... it wasn't that hot, temperature-wise. Doesn't have to be boiling hot, but it should be hot, so the meat can cook. What impressed me was the amount of veggies I received on the side. Normally, I'm used to getting a few sprigs and a minimal amount of bean sprouts with several browned ones- but I got an entire bowl of it just for myself, and they were very fresh.

I also ordered a pork banh mi to-go. It's definitely more expensive at $10.95, but the bread was thick, and it was stuffed full of meat and veggies. The server made sure I had fish sauce and gave me little containers to fill with sriracha and chili sauce. Service was great, although it was not busy at the time.

located in the lobby of treasure island, we had eaten some early morning breakfast at the spot next door and remembered this spot as the cure when we woke up. I had the #6, beef stew with rice noodles and was ready to GRIND!
-they gave tons of basil, limes, and FRESH jalapeno slices (then again it was 8 of us and no one on my side of the table used any so i had it all)
-for $15/a bowl?! it was normal sized.. unfortunately the same vegas prices, but there was a ton of meat chunks which weren't too fatty
-as soon as new customers such as ourselves enter, its rather easy to gauge how hungover they are. sitting with our backs towards the windows so we don't have the sunshine beaming down on our faces, sleeping on the tables with our heads in our hands, and very low key speaking voices.. you'd think they'd feel bad and refill our waters ASAP as to help ease our pain.

They ALWAYS give tons of veggies and they are the freshest I have had among other Pho restaurants that are a hit and miss. Everything is full of flavor.  Pho is delicious but their vermicelli noodle bowls are out of this world.  Been here prob 5 times now and I haven't had a bad meal yet!
