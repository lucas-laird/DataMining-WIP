I've eaten at Da Sheng's dozens of times over the years. It's not always the same. Sometimes the food is excellent sometimes not so good no matter what you order. Same with the service. That's my biggest gripe. Since it's in the middle of the mall with gift stores all around I think they assume you are a tourist and treat you as such. for us locals If they know you, you get better service. Once I was there and the waiter was close to being very rude, and just rushed me to order and seemed like he wanted me out of there in a hurry, the place was empty that day as it was late. A friend of mine, one of the shop owners, happened to walk by and wave and did a traditional bow as he passed by. all of a sudden my waiter did a 180 and treated me like a king. As far as the food I think it's who the cook is on any given day. I've had the same dish taste like wet cardboard or the best thing you ever ate. I generally take home the leftovers and the second day seems always better after it's marinated in my fridge. I've also gotten beef when I ordered lamb. They have a big lunch crowd and lunch specials. I think that tires out the help too, so if you go late in the afternoon you will certainly know the difference. Price wise it's very reasonable and also good for large crowds and banquets. It's a big place.and I would recommend it for that purpose for sure. I gave it 4 stars because more often than not I have a good meal and good service, and the examples I mentioned above are the exception. Bear in mind it's not gourmet nor is it intended to be. many of the people who work in the mall eat there for convenience and business is generally steady.

The wontons were very generic no flavor at all.

Pork fried rice- I can't even call it fried rice, the rice was really soft and tasteless.  I'm not sure what type of meat was in it, we ordered pork fried rice but it was very mushy.

Salt and pepper chicken wings- just fried wings with a slice of jalepeno on top, tasted zero salt.

We even went back a second time for a second attempt on our own.  They are located in middle of the indoor shopping complex within the strip mall.  

For cold starters, we tried Tofu Beef & Cucumber and Happy Couple, both were quite bland and a bit on the sweet side. We had an odd soup with fish ball in it, which is almost like a bowl of noodle soup without the noodle, and the soup was quite salty.

The Chicken Pot was a bit boney on the sweet side, and flavor was not all there either.  Beef Noodles was ok.  I avoided the Egg Plant.  The Taro Short Ribs was an interesting dish, but the combined flavor was just very odd even for a Chinese dish.  Chili Broth Beef & Fish was just a big mess, I could not find the star of the dish.

Peach Smoothie was the best part of the meal, as it was a decent quality drink.

Da Sheng was not up to par when compared with other Chinese restaurant in the area, however, they do excel in their drinks.  Perhaps they should just focus on that instead...

Anyway a friend and I hit Da Sheng up for lunch after work. I'm not sure if he's been there before and was taking me just for shits and giggles or he wanted someone to scope out the place with him.

Regardless we came at a time where the restaurant was pretty much dead. The waitress acknowledged us and told us it was open seating and i grabbed a few menus and start browsing. My buddy has a complicated diet due to some conditions he has so pork was totally out of the question as well as some shellfish.

We ended up getting two lunch specials which were i think 6.95 which wasnt too bad.

Spicy Eggplant
 - Normally i dont like eggplant but this place's spicy eggplant might just change my mind. A nice sized plate of eggplant perfectly seasoned and not too spicy with slivers of onion and bamboo shoots. Chinese eggplant with skin on. Texture was spot on, not too soggy or slimy and had a firm bite to it. 

Shrimp with Seasonal Veggies
- 'Seasonal' is kind of a strange term for veggies that are pretty much available year round. appearance wise this is your typical chinese stirfry dish with the thickened sauce. First bite revealed A LOT of tasty garlic and surprisingly a lot of shrimp.

Didnt get a chance to try out any of the smoothies but i'm definately sure to come back and try a few more dishes this place offers.

Chinatown mall across from the 99 ranch market! We always see this place walking around inside the mall, and decided to be spontaneous and try it out.

They offer 2 for 1 on certain boba drinks, and also have lunch happy hour that ends at 3 pm. Portions are okay, I would honestly say one plate will be good for 2 people. Anyhow...we ordered the chicken chow mein (I was craving chow mein for some reason), salt and pepper shrimp, and the Mongolian beef (of course, we all know how much my boyfriend loves Mongolian beef!) and a side of white rice. Pleeeenty of food for the two of us! My favorite were the salt and pepper shrimp that just had this crunch as soon as I bit into the shrimp. I normally don't eat the shell because it's usually hard, but this she'll was full of flavor that I couldn't resist. It had a kick of spice because they also put some jalapeños on it.

Service was okay, they pretty much leave you be, and when you need something...you can call them and they'll come right away.

Food-
I first came here a few years ago. I forgot why I hadn't returned. Then after I had lunch I remembered. When they first started they had the cold appetizers would you could select in the counter. I noticed on this trip they were all gone.  A good Yunnan or szechuan has a delicous pork with garlic sauce aka yu shiang rou shi (literally translated fish flavored pork).  This place does not.  The version they make should be called hoisin sauce pork.  I also had their dou ban yu pain, bean paste with fish fillet. This was a spicey slightly numbing bean sauce with fish.   Really just ok.  In fact with both dishes the stir fried cabbage was the best.  Flavored well and crisp. 

Service-
Given that they have two huge signs in their windows that advertise their lunch specials,  one would think they would give you lunch menus when you went during lunch times. That however is not the case they will give you dinner menus and you have to explicitly ask for the lunch menu. I think the owner is the main server at the restaurant. He is actually friendly if you talk to him. But he is also extremely casual. To the point that when I went to the restaurant he was outside having a cigarette and just walked me in and didn't bother to put out his cigarette.

We went here for lunch last weekend; it was pretty empty (but then again, the whole area was relatively not busy, either- you can tell, because there was only one tour bus in the parking lot). We've been to the mall before and this place was packed. 

You will be seated by the host. There are booths on the sides overlooking the rest of the mall. The tables and chairs are in the middle of the restaurant, and are the majority of the seating available. The TV's were on, so my husband enjoyed seeing one of the football games. The cashier counter (you go up to pay for the bill BTW) does double duty as a Boba Tea and Smoothie- to go counter. Clean place. 

We ordered Wor Won Ton Soup and Combination Fried Rice to split between us. It was a cold day and we wanted soup. Ironically we were seated right underneath the vent, blasting cold AC, so we moved. Our little one was fine by our side; luckily it was not busy, so it was not in the way for other patrons, nor was it loud, either. The food was pretty good and we had leftovers. The amount of food was pretty good. The flavor of the good was pretty good, not greasy like the usual suspects. 

There is a bit of a language barrier with the servers, but that is ok. We would come back here again. Afterward, we went to the Bakery, my favorite.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,4,s4mRftZ6WNyuB1KXIILU9A

The rice cake was not that authentic (not Shanghainese flavor)
The crispy chicken is not good (it's like soaked in soy sauce lol)

But the beef noodle is amazing!

Drinks buy one get one free (forgot to check the prize for one)
The spicy fish is good.


We ordered 5 dishes and 5 drinks for $72.

One star off for being a bit pricey.
Overall: nice!",I8kvsIJl_W2aU9_hMx44zg,0,0,3,cwMM8yNuye1LJOHNcixMDA

I dropped two of them and I went back to see if I could I just put them in another cup, but they said no we will give you two new drinks. They really took care of us. I know some restaurants won't even do that and if you drop it you're SOL. I know accidents happen but these guys went above and beyond. They really know how to take care of their customers.

1. egg drop soup
2. plate of orange chicken 
3. bowl of rice

- Inside Chinatown mall.
- Seated right away with a dirty menu. 
- Cheap lunch. $6.25 for orange chicken.
- Made fresh. I was a bit hesitant thinking that the food was probably pre-made on a tray like at Panda Express, but it came steamy hot in front of me. 
- Crispy. orange pieces. Would have been nice if it came with a side salad.
- Fortune cookie. Happy ending. 
- Lots to pick from on their lunch special menu. I will return.",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,5,3,4,p6cc6DhRWoCtc3L1IflWUQ

No?? Well I did and this hankering for a good batch of war wonton soup was killing me. Needless to say this went on for 2 days before finally at work I looked over the options for lunch and took a shot in the dark recommending we eat at Da Sheng. Now, keeping my fingers crossed I was hoping that they make the war wonton soup like a real pro and I would not end up with the classic Styrofoam cup with nothing but broth with what looks like a baby jellyfish of a wonton floating it... 
I may be a little bias in saying that most places I have ordered Chinese food from off of spring mountain have been perfect but... Da Sheng hit it out of the park.

First off my soup came and it was fresh and hot, opening the container was like opening that small package at Christmas and noticing all the cool stuff that your uncle ted crammed into that small box. I still don't know how he did that.... Anyways, They definitely did the same thing with large fresh wontons and shrimp with chunks of pork and all the fixings. Now the kicker is that I requested they make my soup spicy. I was concerned that they may do what other places have done upon my request and just dump some the spicy oil it and make it look like BP just ran through my bowl but they did not do that at all. They must have ran my broth through a pot with peppers or something because they gave it a great kick and flavor with the spice and did not turn my bowl of deliciousness into a a hazard in need of the environmental protection agency... I mean we have all seen the commercials with the seagulls and the guy in the hazmat suit scrubbing them with dawn soap. Now picture a commercial with a guy scrubbing off his wontons in a hazmat suit. Yep that is usually the norm.

Wow sorry for short jog I just took way off path of this review but it is spot on the truth. Da Sheng has been perfect about customizing our orders and keeping it fresh and hot for everything they have done. Why have basically made Da Sheng our go to place for Chinese food. This is now the official Wonton soup craving cure.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,3,2,5,PM9WdfE9dEujTpOQfaSlJw
5659934,2015-01-09,0,0eZHVYDyACtVVOIgoBlV3g,"I've been here a bunch because this is one of the few places I can eat near work. I've always enjoyed their Mongolian beef, but after eating here on 12/25/14 (thanks to every place being packed) I don't know if I'll be back.

I've had their spicy lamb. Avoid - it's mostly just straight up jalapeño peppers with some lamb. It's also $14 after tax.

During Christmas, I tried their braised eggplant and enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the duck we got seemed precooked elsewhere and slightly reheated for us. That's basically a kiss of death for me when it comes to restaurants.

After reading about their health code violations, I don't think I can justify going back. Every time I've been, the restaurant has been empty - so they have nothing but time to clean.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,2,3,BEExb4wMdg2H_1YJNb7U3g

I walked into the restaurant with my husband. No one greeted us at the entrance so we walked to the register. I looked at him and said ""two"". He said, ""eat here?""....  He waved and said sit there. 

We sat down for 20 min. While he waited on other Chinese customers that walked in after us. I waved at him for to take the order and he continued to talk and package their food. And we sat for longer. A girl came out and we thought she was going to take our order. To no avail. She stopped to talk to the same customers. 

We ended up walking out of the restaurant. Done. 

-- Mind you, the kids and I have come here before. I raved to the husband about how their food is really good. But I can't honestly say that I will be back to sit down done with their lack of customer service. If you're doing take out, they have BOGO milk tea with boba. Good deals on their lunch specials if you have nothing better to do.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,3,1,1,WLpshj2SZkTy8wzgX3lOEQ
5918883,2013-10-24,4,0eZHVYDyACtVVOIgoBlV3g,"If I had to guess the business plan for this decent size Chinese restaurant in the middle of the two-story building in Chinatown Plaza, I would have to guess: LA Chinatown buses to Las Vegas.  It certainly has the capacity to hosts 2 tour bus loads of customers, but is always empty each and every time I happened to walk through this building.

On a whim, I met up with another Yelper and had lunch here.  Their lunch specials are very affordable, with prices ranging from $5.95 to $6.95 covering 25 items.  You can practically eat here for lunch every day for a month and barely have to order something you have already tried.  That is actually pretty good.

So after looking over the menu we settled on the following items:

Fish Filet with Black Bean Sauce - Lunch Special. ($6.95)
There are plenty of fish in this dish, and although it did look like they skimped on the black bean sauce or gave us something different instead.  Either way, it was good and we had no problem killing it like it was your worst enemy that turned into one of those Walking Dead Zombies.  

Cabbage Green with Dried Shrimp - Lunch Special. ($5.95)
A very simple and probably derivative of a very classical Chinese recipe, but still rather tasty.  It was not my favorite of the two items we ordered, but we still didn't leave any morsels behind for other bands of scavengers. 

Besides the wallet friendly lunch menu, their buy 1 get 1 free Thai Tea and Milk Tea promotion is very popular for people that happens to be walking about this building.  It is not the world's greatest drinks, but it is still an enticing offer.

They also serve Taiwanese Shaved Ice (the traditional shaved ice topped with various toppings (pick 3 items) and simple syrup and condensed milk ($5.35). If that is not your thing, they too have flavored smoothies and fresh fruit smoothies. That is a lot of items to refresh and satiate your sweet tooth.
