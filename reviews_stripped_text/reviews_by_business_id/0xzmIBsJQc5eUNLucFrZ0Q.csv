They also nailed the chicken & risotto entree that I had -- smooth, creamy, and very flavorful - the only minor detail with it was that the chicken wasn't ""crispy"" as stated on the menu - it was just a simple grilled chicken with a very light (almost unnoticeable) coating.  Still, the risotto more than made up for it.

My husband tried to get us a seat for 7.30 pm at 6.30 pm...short notice you say? However, the hostess was so helpful and tried her best to slip us in earlier than that - and she did. The steak was thick and juicy and the potatoes was so creamyyyy! I had the veal but it was nothing great...maybe I'm just  comparing it to the one I had at Rome a month ago. We wanted to try the tiramisu but unfortunately there were out of it.

The atmosphere is unique, with all types of tree branch art work that is pretty cool.  The wine list is deep, with bottles starting at around $60.  The menu has so many great choices, are party of four was each very pleased with their selection.  I do recommend the lobster pasta it's off the hook.

121908,2009-03-16,0,0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q,"The girls and I decided to dine here on Friday night before our ""Le Reve"" show at 9:30pm, which is very convenient as Stratta is located right across from the Le Reve theater and a few steps from the resort elevators.  Since we had a heavy lunch, we opted to share appetizers and dinner entrees.  I loved the d√©cor...red walls and muted lighting makes the restaurant appear elegant.  

Dishes my friends and I tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):

* Fried Calamari (4 stars / $16) - The calamari was tender and the batter just right...not too crispy.  The crisp-fried slices of onion and parsley added to the texture...the spicy aioli sauce finishes off this appetizer perfectly.  
    
* Roasted Pork Chop with Sage and Garlic (4 stars / $34) - This thick and large porkchop is stuffed with fontina cheese and prosciutto.  I loved the stuffed cheese.  The Asian-inspired sauce was good, but a bit strong, so a side of mashed potatoes or rice would have gone well with it.  

* Linguini with Clam Sauce (4 stars / $25) - This dish consisted of roasted clams with garlic, olive oil, white wine, and parsley tossed with linguini.  My friend said the sauce was light and flavorful, and the clams were cooked just right.    

* Roasted Shrimp Penne (4 stars / $29) - This dish consisted of a puttanesca sauce with capers, olives, and spicy peppers tossed with penne pasta.  My friends thought the dish was good, but didn't think it warranted the $29 price tag.  

* Margherita Wood-Fired Pizza (4 stars / $14) - This pizza consisted of Bel Paese"" cheese, tomato and basil.  

* Bombolini (3 stars / $10) - Warm amoretti and ricotta beignets (mini donuts) filled with nutella.

The wine list had a lot of good options, but we stayed away from alcohol during dinner and stuck with mineral water and sodas as we were saving our drinking for Tryst.  

Overall, Stratta has great ambiance, good food and great service.  Although none of the dishes wowed us, I would definitely dine here again if I'm staying at the Wynn.",o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,1,0,4,cUrPZJfqC8hYw-u9AbH8Jw

After stumbling around Vegas for the day, nursing a hang over, we decided to try this gorgeous restaurant. (Which is open all night! Like really all night! Until 6am.... Vegas is fantastic.) 
We were seated after a 10 minute wait while they opened (which consisted of them staring at everyone asking to be seated). The ambiance was beautiful and simple. It was nice to be able see out into the casino but still feel a little romantic. 
We started with the Arugula, endive and goat cheese salad. It was fantastic. Crisp and fresh and the corn was a fantastic touch. I then had the scallops, which were so fresh and bouncy. I wanted to devour and savor all at the same time. 
It was a truly fantastic meal, worth the price. 
And yes, it is on the expensive side BUT what are you expecting from a restaurant in the Wynn? And it's not like there wasn't a menu right outside the entrance, listing the prices. Don't go in if you don't like the prices. 
I was a little annoyed at how we were first treated when we sat down. Yes, we are in our 20's and yes we wore jeans but that shouldn't stop you from thinking we don't have money to spend. And we did.... but it was a fantastic meal, well worth it.",koYmVxAWon30DbcaJHih_w,1,0,4,AWP1C3FqCERibGPDLl6bdA

It was surprisingly affordable, the check was under $400 for the 6 of us, and we werent in any way frugal.

Lets begin with the drinks: First let me say that I LOVE their glassware. I wanted to steal it and take it home with me...but it wouldnt fit in my purse. My friends said that their dirty martini's were perfect. I ordered a pitcher of a drink that had blackberry stoli(I think thats what it was) with muddled berries and mint, it was so delicious! oh, and they have a very nice scotch selection.

Now the food: They serve a really good basil/olive oil with the bread and it is so fresh and flavorful. I ordered the angel hair pasta with tomato and basil. It was PERFECTION! My sister ordered the Maine lobster 'fra diavolo'. I tried it and it was so damn good, probably my favorite dish. Other friends got the eggplant parmesean, lasagna, and the linguini with clams. They were all really good. I would order any of those dishes.

We were so full that we couldnt get dessert. 

As a side note: Im not sure if it was my state of inebriation or what, but they have some really weird ""art work/decor"". I couldnt stop staring at the wall art, it looked just like toasted staghetti sicks and pieces of fresh Ahi.

Disappointing. I had reservation so I was seated within 2 minutes. I was approached by a male Asian server who asked what I wanted to drink. He did not hand me a menu nor a wine menu and did not tell me what drinks they served. I ordered an ice tea and water. Moments later 3 ladies were seated next to me and soon after given a menu. I still did not have one. The waitress looked over and asked if I had a menu...duh...no. I did not have one in my hand.
 I ordered the caprese salad. I had better, much better, the previous night. The entree, pork chop and twice baked potato. I wanted a couple of items I read on the menu at the concierge desk. My waitress told me that menu was outdated and they no longer offered the items I wanted. You would think this 5 star hotel would take care of that minor detail.
  My chop had a flavorful taste but was raw in some places. As I was eating I overheard a server, at a neighboring table, go into detail about the specials, offer a wine menu, spoke on what beers and what specialty drinks they offered. The presentation was thorough and nicely presented. I did not receive that treatment. All I received was ""so what do u want to drink""   When I told my waitress what I heard and asked why I was not told about the specials or given the opportunity to partake in them she apologized and thought I just wanted what was on the menu.

There was 4 of us dinning and one of us was late from their flight being delayed.    We waited a good hour after we were done eating for the last member of our party and they never tried to kick us out as we were not eating or rush us.

We went and the had a tasting menu for 3 courses.  I think it was 39.00/each.  Anyways, I started with FRIED CALAMARI and it was pretty good.  However,  best Calamari is still at Fiamma Trattoria at MGM Grand!  The Calamari is good here and I would suggest it.  As for dinner we each got something different.  We each tried the BUCATINI 'AMATRICIAN, SEARED SEA SCALLOPS, and ROASTED CHICKEN BREAST.

BUCATINI 'AMATRICIANA:
Pancetta, tomato sauce with Pecorino Romano, roasted onions  this was very good and had a lot of flavor.  I really enjoyed this but, was not the best thing we had this night.

ROASTED CHICKEN BREAST:
Braised artichokes, baked tomatoes and capers in white wine sauce this was very well done.  Chicken was done perfectly and wow the flavor was great.  Would suggest this to anyone!  Again second best this night.

SEARED SEA SCALLOPS:
Saute of zucchini, oven-dried tomatoes, basil butter sauce WOW this was great and by far the best prepared Sea Scallops i've tried yet.  I'm new with this and only had a hand full of times.  But, this was great and will come here again for this dish alone.

And for dessert we all had TIRAMISU and it was very good.  They got it right and I know as this is one of my favorite desserts.  We also had one of their signature drink pitchers as my friend ordered the girlie drink on the menu but the waiter said it was very strong.  I think it was the Prickly Pear Margarita.  I will admit it sounds and looks very fru fru but it was very strong and we were all pretty drunk after completing the whole pitcher.

Price: High, but to be expected from vegas so no points docked from this category.

I would definitely come back here again. I usually don't like spaghetti dishes because of the sauce. For some odd reason I just don't like tomato sauce with tomatoes in it...but the sauce in this particular spaghetti dish was delicious! It was was an odd color orange...but good.

2.  ricotta filled ravioli - cheese was so light and fluffy.  small serving of 4 pieces.  the sauce could've been more flavorful to add to the great texture.

3.  maine lobster & shrimp fra diavolo - disappointed.  it was just a slightly more fancy version of boiled lobster & shrimp tossed with angel hair pasta & marinara sauce.  totally was not worth the $47 price tag.

The wait staff, the table, and especially the decor.
It's a beautiful restaurant that spares no expense to make it that way.

We started our meal with their Fried Calamari (comes out hot and crispy, and tastes very fresh)

For dinner I ordered the: Shrimp 'Fra Diavolo' - spaghetti with roasted shrimp in a spicy-garlic tomato sauce.

Oh my goodness!! When it arrived, the aroma alone made me salivate, and it was amazing from the first bite to the last (which wasn't even the entire meal because I couldn't eat anymore)


Pros:
Beautiful decor
Quiet
Located in the hotel, so it's easily accessible

Cons:
A little pricey (but you get what you pay for)",dsQIR83jsRTlEn651WvHAA,0,0,5,l-35dphlfaI10DsLL-Hc8A

I took my boyfriend here while on a Vegas trip for his birthday. In the past we've enjoyed many amazing places like Todd English's Olives at the Bellagio and this time around I wanted to try a restaurant at either Wynn or Encore. My boyfriend would always talks about how the owner of both casino's, Steve Wynn, is a vegetarian (like my boyfriend) and how cool it is that every restaurant has a full vegetarian menu.

My thought process: Sweet. A high end casino AND a vegetarian menu? How can this go wrong? Well the service was fine and all but when our main entree came out and it wasn't what we ordered, plus it cost an extra $10 from what we originally ordered, I wasn't exactly happy or impressed. Its fine, its $10. But really? 

The food was mediocre and its sad to know I knew how much the food (main entree) sitting in front of me would have cost had I just run to a Whole Foods and cooked it up myself. I paid silly amounts for it.

Won't be going back but this experience won't keep me from trying some other Wynn and Encore restaurants.",UXL3osX6su7tLj3noznN2g,1,0,3,BHRftrrBOxDBQuMDvPmnXw

It would be great if the halfed the portion of this and lowered the price (pretty pricey appetizer of $16).  

The worst part was my main course.  Ordered the linguine with clam sauce and it was the WORST pasta I have ever tasted.  Even Olive Garden and Chef Boyardee are better than this pasta.  It was so incredibly bland it was like they forgot the white wine for the white wine sauce.  I couldnt' believe what I was tasting and asked my husband to try to make sure I wasn't crazy.  He shared the same sentiments so I sent it back.  Next I asked for the Roasted Shrimp Penne which was okay...at least it had some taste to it, but I have had much better.

We came here on our anniversary, due to the fact we have been at Alex's other restaurant that was flawless, but this restaurant seems like it's not even run by the same person. Something about the tone did not seem right; granted, we came here right when it opened because we had to catch a show, but it seemed like none of the employees even wanted to be there. In fact, 3 minutes after we were seated we got a different server. And the original guy didn't seem to be doing anything. Strange. 

We ended up ordering three things off of the vegan menu: a pizza to share, chicken parmigiana, & vegan bolognese. The pizza came out first and well, it was terrible. Like really, really bad. The idea was good: vegan cheese, broccolini, garlic, and caramelized onions. Yet for some reason, the dough was ridiculously bitter. I could hardly stand to put it on my tongue, it was disgusting. I have had fired pizza before but it never tasted like that.  It took us over 6 minutes for anyone to notice us - and we were only one of two tables in the restaurant. Not okay. They did take this off the bill for us and asked us if we wanted anything else, but we declined and hoped that our main courses would be better.

Luckily, they were. My bolognese was very good and a decent serving; my husband's chicken parmigiana was alright, but definitely not worth the hefty pricetag; mine wasn't either, but at least it was tasty. We ended the night with some dessert that was nice, but the entire visit left us wanting. 

I really felt like I received far better customer service actually placing our reservation through the Wynn than what I received actually being in the restaurant, and that is upsetting. After being regulars at other restaurants at the Wynn and seeing the spectacular customer service there, I expected at least the same if not better, and I got much worse. The food was alright, the price was astronomical, and the service was just not good.

I normally like to go to this place after dancing at XS.  So I went again this past weekend.  This place seems to always have customers, it's just a great place to hang out with friends and perhaps with a significant other for some dinner.  The thing I like most about this place is that you don't have to break the bank in order to eat here which is perfect for just about anyone who is looking to have a good time in Vegas.  

I don't know what it was about the Horse radish mashed potatoes here, but I always liked getting them (I may be biased about this because I love potatoes), they were just luscious and the girls I ordered with ate the entire side dish with me.  I also ordered the Bosco pizza which was infused with truffle oil...anyone that loves mushrooms should get this dish.  :)  Remember, though my taste buds love strong flavors...

I'm giving this 4 stars because I loved the small dessert platter they gave to me the first time I went here.  I was able to sample each one and they were DELIGHTFUL!

We started with the saffron mussel appetizers which was good but not spectacular.  The saffron was very subtle and there was little tiny balls of circular pasta.  That was odd, it didn't really compliment the mussels, it just seemed like it was thrown in as an afterthought.  For my main, I ordered the main lobster fra diavolo, spaghetti in spicy tomato sauce.  My friends ordered the roasted shrimp puttanesca and the angel hair pomodoro.  Mine was very under seasoned.  There was barely any sauce..it looked like my plate when I heat some spaghetti up at home in the microwave and all the sauce dries up...so the whole dish was dry.  And if you advertise a spicy sauce, first make sure there is sauce, then make sure it is spicy.  The best and only good part of my dish was that there were huge chunks of lobster, which usually restaurants are pretty stingy with.  I ate all my lobster and I was done.  I looked over at my friends' plates and it all looked like mine.  Sad, dried and unedible.  I took a taste of theirs and it tasted exactly like mine.  Sad and dried up.  I think they just throw different pasta in different plates and use all the same tomato sauce.  Unacceptable.  I was bummed.  angry.  I had looked forward to a good meal before going out.  How can you mess up pasta? Luckily, we ordered the dessert sampler and my mood went up a bit.  The sampler is great, I love mini desserts because i get to try everything.  The tiramisu was delicious, nice and moist and did not reek of alcohol.  Little tiny donuts mmmm, chocolate toffee cake, good, only because I'm not a coffee fan.  and the best part was the warm apple tart.

When I arrived to the hotel, I was surprised that the restaurant was located in a very busy corner near where you purchase La Reve tickets; however when you walk inside the restaurant the atmosphere changes.  The lights are dim and the decor is simple and elegant.  The kitchen is somewhat open and it was fun to watch the chef, the cooks, and the runners in action.  Our server was attentive and friendly.

Cocktail of choice: Pitcher of Margarita (pear I think).  It makes about 4 glasses and was served on the rocks.  It was sweet, sour, and tangy with just the right alcohol.  It would have been better if the glass ring was salted.

Bread basket was yummy but served cold.  The best part was the fresh pesto dip it was served with.

Appetizer (Special): Trio of artichoke hearts.  Approximately 2-3 pieces each were fried, raw, and stuffed with goat cheese.  My favorite was the stuffed artichoke.  Wish there was more of the brown balsamic sauce on the plate as the raw artichoke could have used it.  The fresh pesto was a good substitute though.

Soup: Pasta E. Fagioli: Good portion but this again to me was just so so.  Tasted a bit bland and could have used fresh Parmesan and fresh crushed pepper corns but it was not offered.

Entree: Pasta Carbonara: I know that the pasta here is suppose to be made fresh daily and that was what I was so excited to come here for; however the fettuccine seemed so thick and was hard to chew,  I couldn't tell if it was fresh or not.

(which, admittedly was influenced by Arby's??).  their short ribs were slightly classier than pot roast, but the rest was close to the same. :] ... comes on a nice bread, with cheese, and a horseradish sauce.  and peppers.  very good stuff.

the pizza ($13ish) was a mushroom purree as the sauce.  very good and nice flavors.

truffle oil fries ($5ish) were pretty decent.  i mean really good. nothing too unexpected.

had some nice wine parings to go with.

overall the place is pretty nice, laid back, good service... good wine.  not expensive.  actually, they're pretty much priced on par with just about any other restaurant in town, but are really high quality.   good bang for your bucks here.",sZxXpvmBUN2fSCtK_BZFoQ,0,0,5,ulG2u65K8qVAIYqL5VerXg

Unfortunately, the food never measured up to our expectations.  I ordered the Corsa Salad with Warm Goat Cheese and had to send it back as the goat cheese was rancid.  Our server quickly replaced it with a Cesar Salad, but the dressing just didn't hit the mark.  My husband order the Steak Tartare appetizer and found it way too big (looked like a giant burger on the plate) and tasteless.  

As entrees, my simple pasta was acceptable and his Crispy Chicken Wild Mushroom Risotto was the biggest disappointment.  The risotto stood on the plate like a scoop of mashed potatoes, the chicken was NOT crispy and the wild mushrooms were not hydrated properly and the stems were woody and chewy.

There are some things similar to Corsa Cucina, namely the pizzas.  I had the pizza with shitake mushrooms, mozzarella, goat cheese and truffle oil.  I have to say, it was excellent.  I also had a side of rapini, which was also excellent - lots of garlic.  I also tried the fried cheese bites that my friend ordered and they were tasty - little triangles of cheese between bread with two different sauces.  They were not amazingly memorable but they were good in a comfort food sort of way.  The bread they served us came with a pesto sauce to dip and the pesto was excellent.

They have a smallish but decent wine by the glass list and the service at the bar is excellent.  We chose to sit at the bar so we could have a faster dinner and get back to gambling and it was very pleasant.  The bartenders were friendly and we got our food and drinks very quickly.

I used to come here with my family whenever we came to Las Vegas because we enjoyed their service, food, and ambience. We came to Vegas during Thanksgiving and made reservations to come here for Thanksgiving dinner. When we showed up we realized that it was empty- that should've been a sign. 

When we made the reservation we mentioned that we had a baby in a stroller so they could accommodate us accordingly. We get there and the hostess was going to seat us in the corner by the casino and have us put the stroller outside on the casino carpet! Thankfully, our server rushed over and had us sit in a corner which had more room for a stroller (and just made more sense). 

We ordered one of their pizzas as an appetizer because bottom line is, they have damn good pizza. The pizza sauce they use is amazing. When placing our orders our server let us know that they might be out of turkey dinner but might have one left. It was only 6:30 so I was shocked but my thought process was ""MIGHT have one left....MIGHT not be fresh"" so I decided to get a steak instead. We all ordered different types of steaks and shared some side dishes such as the saut√©ed mushrooms and potatoes au gratin. 

The potatoes were not cooked and were super thick chunks. Our server apologized and brought us out another batch. Yet again, not cooked thoroughly. I mean, you expect them how to properly cook what they advertise at their specialty sides. My steak was cold, as if it was sitting out there for an hour. Our server was kind enough to reheat it but once it came out, it just didn't taste right. I've had many steaks in my life, really good high quality ones but this was not worth it at all. I can get over the fact that with the price it doesn't come with any sides. But don't serve me a slap of bland meat for your jacked up prices. And learn how to make potato au gratin please.

dinner began with a caesar salad, which i thought was yummy and some foccacia and what looked like french bread which was served with pesto-totally yummy! *side note, some guys complained the lettuce wasn't cut, so they had to cut it-sheesh-it's all about the presentation!* for our main course, we had the pork chop wtih sage and garlic butter, and wild striped bass served with fennel. i ordered the pork chop while my new husband (sounds so weird!) had the bass. the bass got mixed reviews, some said it was bland while others said they enjoyed it. i have to admit i LOVED my pork chop-in fact i wish i took a picture of it! it was the most hugest piece of pork chop i've ever seen, but on top of that it was so moist...i don't know how they managed to do that! dessert followed and it was a chocolate cake with chocolate-mousse like filling. it was like the best cake ever! so moist, dense, and just yummy!

Our fourth stop of the night was actually Switch, but the menu didn't sound appealing. Before we left we saw the walls and ceilings change. Wow, talk about gimmicky and underwhelming. $40 million doesn't get you as much as it used to, I guess. Anyway, we headed to Stratta for our next bite.

Despite there being 3 or 4 empty tables in the Stratta lounge we had to wait. When they finally sat us it was at a table that remained empty the whole time. wtf? I guess they like making people wait for no reason?

Their Late Night menu was the only food option. I believe it's the same stuff as their Lunch menu. Our order:
- Warm goat cheese salad ($11): underwhelming, bland and boring.
- Meatball sandwich ($16): I didn't try any of it, but my friend devoured it pretty quickly
- Braised short rib panino ($15): a tasty sandwich. Tender meat, glazed onions, and plenty of cheese. It was a big sammie, as it should be for 15 bucks, but still over-priced.

It tasted like it was made with cream though, rather than using good cheese. That was a tad bit disappointing. I wasnt a huge fan of the Papparadelle, but I will say that the pasta did taste freshly made, so kudos for that.  Dessert was a chocolate toffee cake and tiramisu.  We were too full to really enjoy them, but the tastes we had were nice. I particularly thought the chocolate toffee cake was yummy and very rich.

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD WITH PESTO
- PESTO IS DELICIOUS. Probably the best pesto I have had. Good blend of basil leaves, pine nuts, and olive oil
- fresh baked bread; either a dinner roll or a roll with a roasted tomato slice
- also comes with some breadsticks (the cracker kind)

LINGUINI WITH CLAMS ($28)
- Roasted Manila Clams, Garlic White Wine Sauce
- debated between this or the Rosotto Pescatora but GLAD I chose the Linguini
- the linguini was cooked just right; great texture
- the sauce was decent; which there was a stronger garlic taste
- good amount of clams (I would hope so for $28)
- overall was happy with my dish but wished the linguini absorbed more of the sauce

RISOTTO PESCATORA ($36)
- Shrimp, Scallops, Calamari, Mussels, Clams
- takes a bit longer to cook
- good blend of seafood
- a bit too moist for my liking

20 OZ. BONE-IN RIB EYE STEAK ($44)
- Tomato, Mozzarella Cheese, Shaved Parmesan Cheese
- very tender and juicy
- if you order this, don't eat too much bread (though I know that will be hard!) since this is a big piece of meat
- definitely NOT a pre-clubbing meal for a girl -- food baby

SERVICE: great! Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu selections. Our waters were filled appropriately. They did not hesitate to refill our bread. We had some bread leftover and felt bad for ordering extra bread when we were about 50% full BEFORE receiving our entrees. We asked for a box to bring the bread back to our room. We thought they would package the leftover bread but instead they gave us a whole NEW batch of fresh, warm bread. 

ENVIRONMENT: classy but then again it is in the Wynn and Vegas, where the ballers roll. (Side note: the table party of 2 mid-50s diners ordered a pizza and then proceeded to EACH order an entree. Either they're ballers or they eat a LOT). Slightly dim lighting to suffice for a romantic date or a nice dinner out with friends.  The kitchen is semi-opened so it's nice to at least see the faces of the people making your food. Certain tables are also good for people watching.

Overall, the food was good but I don't think it's worth the price. The whole Vegas ambiance definitely raises the price of everything. If it was about $5 cheaper than it wouldn't be too bad considering the ambiance and food quality. I don't know if I would come back again, since there are so many options in Vegas. Though if you're staying at the Wynn and can't make a reservation at your preferred restaurants then I would recommend coming here.",H74c_2LheXJmtEJd2EV6WQ,1,1,4,LPZkm6Awp3vT5dHIK7z3hA

We had to wait 30 minutes for a table at 4:30 AM. Yup, 4:30 AM.. the feet are killing, the table needs to be cleared before we can sit down and the busboy is slow as molasses.  It was torturous watching him methodically place down each wine glass, fork, knife, one by one...

Moving on, their pizzas are actually really quite good - thin crust, nice char, minimal but tasty toppings.  The bosco was my favourite - white truffle oil, mushroom puree, cheese.

The margherita was well executed, a bit too much cheese and not enough fresh basil though.

One downer was the chicken breast sandwich they served us was pink in the middle.  We asked for it to be taken off the bill and they obliged without an issue.

We did not see her again for a 1/2 hour. Finally we order our aps and get the clams casino(5 clams). Mine were great nicely fire roasted and very flavorful. My friend were also really good until she found some shell in clam 3 but was able to remove the shell bits from her mouth. Well she gets to clam 4 and ""crunch"" she found more shell but this time also broke her tooth. We tell the waitress who sends over the manager. The manager comes over and says that we will send over security for an incident report. While we wait for security we order dinner. I get the pork chop which was very good and she gets the linguini with clam sauce. Again the food was great. After we eat security shows up and takes their report. For desert we order a chocolate toffee cake, good but not great. Then we wait until finaly we have to ask someone to send over our waitress so that we can get the check.

FOOD: 3-3.5
PRICE: 1
PORTION: 0
DECOR: 2.5
SERVICE: 3.5

For the record, the food isn't too bad. It's actually pretty good. But when you take into consideration the portion and the pricing, it's a HUGE fail. We came here because it was the only decent place open that didn't require reservations. Even with our already low standards, this place failed to make us happy. I got the goat cheese salad and my bf got the veal. Okay, I have to admit, I thought the goat cheese salad was YUMMY. It was warm, slightly sweet and really made me happy. However, it was LITERALLY, maybe 4 bites big. Wtf? Prisoners get bigger rations than that. For $12, I would like more than just 4 bites. My bf's veal was a big fat fail. Not only was it tiny, it wasn't even that good (although the sauce that it came with was pretty good), definitely not worth the $35 for 5 bites. And charging us $9 for 3 pieces of asparagus? What the hell. Even higher-rated restaurants give bigger portions AND better quality. 

Service was okay, our waiter was pretty nice but he was also pretty busy so it was hard to get a hold of him. Decor is nice but it isn't anything special. It's just a clean look.

Please don't come here. I know it's convenient because it's open really late and it's right there, but it's still a big fail to me. The only reason why it got a 2 instead of a 1 is because I really liked my 4-bites salad but the portion and prices really make it a zero.",4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww,4,3,2,XCYTWhmN9KYgIjGTC0XmPw

Stratta seemed like a good option.  The decor is great, with dark woods, deep reds,  and large plum lamps hanging from the ceiling.  

The service was absolutely terrible.  Our waiter not only had zero personality, he truly seemed like he wanted us to leave.  After we ordered one round of martinis and a personal pizza each, he handed us our check.  Um...excuse me...we were planning on drinking some more?  Perhaps having dessert?

Not one to be defeated by a rude waiter, I flagged him back down and asked him in my most venomous but syrupy tone, ""Excuse me, do you mind if we order more?""  He gave us a very insincere apology, took the check back, and took our second round of drink orders.  He never even offered to show us the dessert menu.

Our second round of drinks came--and guess what he plopped down on the table with them: the CHECK.  It was Sunday night and  the place was not anywhere near closing, nor was there a line of people waiting to sit down....WTF??  Didn't we just go over this?

We drank our last round, gave him a crappy tip (which is not my style), and left.  

The food was okay; my tomato/basil pizza crust was undercooked and I would have liked more basil.  The drinks were seemingly inventive when you read them off the menu, but were not nearly as interesting in real life.  My first drink was a gin/raspberry juice/sage martini.  I didn't see or taste any sage, and it basically tasted like a cosmo.  (The raspberry juice was clearly not fresh, as I would expect it to be for $14.)  My second drink was some kind of orange concoction that tasted like an orange Starburst.  It was tastey, but too sweet.

Night 1 - 2/22/12 - Very good.  
I was in Vegas last week for a very large health care conference and the main reason for dining here twice in a row was because the crush of attendees which invaded Vegas booked up most of the other restaurants or there was an hour wait!  Luckily it was one of the least noisy places to eat and my colleague and I found a seat at the bar.  I ordered a goat cheese and shitake mushroom salad and an appetizer sized ravioli.  The salad had great flavor but I'm just not a Shitake fan and this night confirmed it as the mushrooms were cut too large and were too chewy to eat.  The ravioli was made fresh and was a perfect portion. The two mature gents behind the bar were jovial and in the right spirit and played well off of each other to make us feel at ease.  The service itself started out really well, but as the gents started to put their heads down on checking receipts, and fussing with registers, the service became very slow and it was tough to get our final bill.

Night 2 - 2/23/12 - Not so much, but a bright spot emerged....
I returned the next night as my colleagues left town and sat at the bar.  Two of the service staff (a 30-something dark-haired guy and a 30-something dark haired woman) were deeply entrenched in a ""he-said-she-said"" catch up session.  It was hard to get their attention.  I sat down right after the main menu was finished being offered so was reduced to bar food choices.  I ordered the same salad as the night before with no mushrooms and low and behold, it arrived with a few mushrooms still in it.  I scraped them aside and didn't report the error.  I ordered the appetizer sized spagetti and meatballs and it was just average.  The service was lackluster throughout, until I started chatting with the busboy.  He was a clean cut young gentlemen who was extremely polite and only spoke when I spoke to him.  I asked him how long he had been working for the Wynn.  He said he was a floater and that today was his first day working in this particular restaurant.  I asked him to explain how the floater set-up worked and he did very briefly.  He said although he is on call 24/7 which can be difficult, he was so grateful to be working and didnt mind the changing schedule.  He was confident it would get better and better as he gained more experience and hours and really liked working for the Wynn.  He was a very hard working bar back and it was so refreshing to see someone who appreciated his job, the work and the opportunity.  I know it must be tough at that level and only wish the upper management would take notice to his dedication and loyalty.  He was quietly charming and hugely grateful which was endearing and rescued my 2nd night at the Stratta.",F7UD51fKeBnElgRqRivC3A,0,0,3,GyL2NzQnUt2_Xb-3FALYAA

I am guessing it really depends on the menu items, or the drinks you order. I just wasn't in the mood to get boozed since I was headed to XS anyway. So I ordered the Meatball Pizza and Shrimp Penne. I chose to skip out on the high priced seafood items and the veal. 

These two items alone were simply the best I have ever tasted. You can tell something is well prepared when the taste doesn't not come from the over loading of fattening ingredients. It comes from truly organic ingredients and chef skills. I can write a page about how great the pizza crust was alone. True international pizza lovers understand that a pizza should not be cheese bread + whatever topping. The crust can be thin as a cracker, but yet bring out tons of flavor.  The cheese and spices were not overwhelming. I just hate milky oily cheese, and this pizza did not have any of that. The meat ball was individually laid out in the center of each slice. With that type of detail, you can tell someone spent hours throughout the day rolling up that single meatball to be served on my one slice of pizza. 

Now on to the Shrimp Penne. Steve Wynn must have a special deal with the shrimp fishermen of Lake Mead, because thats the meatyest piece of shrimp I have ever had on anything. The slow cooked shrimp is not chewy, but has some flesh to bite into. The spices in the penne was not too spicy, but just right.  The pasta was definitely perfectly cooked and blended at the right timing. The funny thing is that I hate shrimp and don't even eat seafood. But I will certainly be glad to eat shrimp at the Stratta.

The food was incredible, and the service was very friendly.  It was valentines day weekend, so the only way to get in is through reservations. From what I heard, this place does fill up quick on the weekends. I highly suggest going to their website if you do choose to dine here.

There is only one reason why I have to take a star off is because of the pressure from the waiter pushing for fiji water and wine.  We were dressed for the club, so getting drunk off wine probably wouldn't go well with the goose later on.

Bad: our server kinda grated on my nerves, like he was irked with us. wtf, man.

Each of us had our fave dessert in the sampler too: mine was the tiramisu, was has to be one of the best I've had; another friend swooned over the cannoli; I super enjoyed the bambolini/cream puff; and the cheesecake was pretty good (nothing uber-special to me, but I'm not a huge cheesecake fan).

The house pinot noir followed us from the bar to our table, as well.  

Moving on to dinner, the roasted garlic bulb appetizer was better than I can even make at home, as were the pizzas.  Our party ended up getting pasta entrees; one got the angel hair pomodoro, one got linguine and white clam sauce, and the rest of us were swayed by the Maine lobster fra diavolo.  Now, our time spent in Las Vegas's resort eateries had taught me not to expect more than a chintzy portion, especially where seafood is concerned.  Not the case, here, at  all.  There were so many huge chunks of lobster in my pasta that I barely even touched the pasta itself before I was totally full...which, sadly, meant no nutella-stuffed beignets or tiramisu  for me.

GARBAGE!
Employees were friendly and we were starving after having checked in to Wynn. Walked in and the place looked like a fancy sportsbar. 
Started off w/ Calamari. It tasted a little like calamari, but the texture was different.....the spicy sauce was good....that's about it. 
I ordered a Blackberry Blis, which was good and gave me a little buz, and my girl ordered a Bellini. That was ehh, and the glass it came in was so dirty that you can feel the dirt on the outside of the glass. 
For our meals, we picked the Fetuccini Alfredo, Spaghetti and Meatballs, and Caesar Salad. 
This is the first Italian ""restaurant"" that didn't serve bread.....so once our meals came out, I asked for bread and parmesan cheese......a few minutes later......had to ask for it again....
here's how the rest of the meal went:
Fetuccini was bad...chicken is the quality you'll get at a really cheap buffet or in the pre-made microwave and serve chicken pieces from the store. Spaghetti and meatballs was chef-boy-r-d. I didn't say it tasted like it....it WAS that. Straight out of the can probably.....except it cost $24!!!! the bread was cold.....not room temp., but fridge cold. 
This place is overpriced and I suggest you either go somewhere else to eat, or if you have no choice, go to the bar and drink yourself unconscious so u don't make it here. 
To top it off....these retards don't check ID when someone bills a meal to their room, so 2 days after we ate there for the first/last time ever......we were billed for another meal.",sm6AzP6HSQhI9j9V_oiPWA,2,1,1,Gde5dyN_aUZxG1e0CrHoqQ

Stratta served me one new york steak and 3 sunny side up eggs and some Ciabatta toast which was pretty good. Other than that not worth $24.50 but I guess its the Wynn and its Vegas so it must be expensive. The service wasn't too great either, I was dying for water so once I sat down a minute later my water was gone, I kept on trying to flag down our waiter or buser to refill my water but there was no hope.

Great, now we have expectations. 

I almost laughed when they brought out the shrimp pasta. It looked like Chef Boyardee: the squishy, stringy pasta, and bright orange sauce. It tasted okay, but for $25+, I'd like to think they could do better than Chef Boyardee.

But after margaritas, Pisco Sour, sangria, tequila shots... well, that rough draft is gone. Instead, you get this: Go to Stratta. 

The place is in the Wynn, and automatically seemed cool to me because it does not have an overbearing presence like other strip restaurants. Not a lot of flashy lights or signs or celebrity chefs or anything of the sort, which is really cool. When we walked in, they informed us the menu would change in a bit, so we should wait and return at 10:45pm. We found the Tower Bar nearby, had some drinks, then returned to Stratta. We were promptly seated, provided with waters and menus, and given suggestions by the waiter. The service was great. It'd been a while since I'd gone to a higher-class place like this, as I usually frequent KoMex and the like, so having this level of service? NICE!

We know the chef who works there (Chef Tad, who is the coolest dude ever), so we chatted with him for a second and asked some questions about the food. He sent us out the Bosco pizza which, I kid you not, may be the best pizza I've ever had. I don't want to tell you what's in it, but it's flippin' delicious. Our drinks, by the way, also did not disappoint. I had the sangria, she had the Almond Joy, which is this coconut/chocolate-flavored thing they have. The drinks were delicious and arrived quickly. Major points for the quickness. We also had the shrimp carbonara (sp?), and it was delicious. Somebody in a previous review said it tasted like microwaved food?

First, we were about 20 minutes late for our reservation, so we lost our table.  Totally understand that, but the somewhat snotty response of the hostess wasn't necessary.

Next, the restaurant does have a very small gluten free menu, which was helpful for my husband with celiac disease.  The menu includes gluten free pasta, which is what my husband ended up ordering.  He enjoyed it, but the price was over $20..so ridiculous and the portion didn't even compensate.

I ordered the margharita pizza.  It was pretty much a thin, overly salty mess.  Again, coming from Chicago, my expectation with pizza is high, and this didn't even come close to passable.

Before I begin, I must pay tribute to that fresh pesto dipping sauce for the bread. How wonderfully those herbs, pine nuts and oils come together! They also have a delightful crostini, which we devoured much too quickly.

Started out with the oysters...freshly shipped in from Maryland or somewhere off the Rappahannock River (I only remember this because my friend always mentions her Tappahannock hometown boy Chris Brown). Anywho, the manager swung by and informed us that those oysters were destined for Alex, but he managed to intercept them and send them our way! Talk about service.

They DO have a special diets menu (points for that), including separate sections for vegan, nut-free, and gluten-free dishes.  The staff also seemed very well-informed.

What WASN'T great wasn't even that they didn't have any real vegan dishes (just pizza and pastas that they left the cheese off of).... it was that the dishes just weren't executed terribly well.  We got the mushroom pizza with truffle oil and penne with chunky tomato sauce.  The pizza crust was great !!! Perfectly cooked and tasty.  The pizza was covered in a mushroom pate of sorts, and was all right, but I didn't really taste any truffle oil.  The pasta was terrible.  Not sure who decided that the very simple tomato sauce should be flavored only with a buttload of marjoram, but that was a pretty bad decision.  Who likes marjoram that much?? Certainly not me, nor either of my dining companions.  And it was a pretty small portion.... thankfully, as I hate wasting food.... for $20.  

The omnivore of the group had a Caesar salad and pasta with meatballs that he quite enjoyed (apparently they spared the marjoram on that dish).  We also got some pretty good wines (by the glass).

There were five of us and we were seated right away. Problem! no menu for about 5 minutes. When we finally grabbed one of the staffs and asked her, she said 'your server will be right with you' and sure enough, our server got us menus. We ordered a couple of drinks and 4 dishes. Drinks were okay. Nothing special, even though they were specialty drinks of the place. Now to the food, the best of out of all was the caesar salad. All the ingredients were fresh and everything was put together well, but it is a salad. Margherita pizza was pretty good, nothing special though. I wasn't a big fan of their Fried Calamari on the other hand. It was just too greasy, and all the calamari was sliced into too small of pieces. Truffle fries were a bit too greasy as well, but it wasn't terrible or anything.

Their service could use some improvements. I didn't have a set of silverware so I asked for one, but our server ended up forgetting (or was too busy) so I had to ask again when the food hit the table. Then later on, I ordered another drink and it never came. I asked our server what happened (politely) and she apologized and offered to bring it out then but I said it was ok. I don't mind when staffs make a mistake, but when it is repeated, that's when I get frustrated.

4950079,2009-05-26,4,0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q,"So...........we were excited about staying at the Wynn Casino and wanted to grab a decent meal before hitting the tables.  My friend have told me that they had the best Italian food in this restaurant.  We ordered some drinks and they brought over some bread.

Bread was stale.  It came with a house made pesto.  I like dipping the bread in marinara so we ordered the appetizer meatballs.  The sauce was great and the temperature was perfect but the meatballs was only warm.  Very disappointing.  Plus the bread was bad.

The Lasagna was good but the middle of the lasagna was lukewarm  The sauce was hotter than the lasagna.   I think if they would have used the same sauce on the meatball as they did for the Pasta with lobster and shrimp, it would have tasted better. They have two different types of marinara sauce?  The pasta was hard in a not so al dente way.  Meaning the spaghetti with lobster and shrimp for 44 dollars was probably left under a food heating lamp a little too long and the lobster and shrimp were a little rubbery.

The whole meal lasted 1:45 minutes.  We sat near the bar and not in the main dining area so that we can watch the lakers game.  I have heard that this was a great restaurant.  The service was the only thing that gave them the extra star.

We checked in hopped on yelp looking for some good eats before bed. I had planned to head to Ferraro's but my motivation to drive was gone. We found that stratta was still open (it was about 1230am when this occurred) and headed down. 

It seems quite a few other people realized they still served food at this late hour and there was a short wait. The staff was great but the loud obnoxious fat little female smoke stack in front of me was quite annoying. 

She was running her mouth and blowing smoke in me and my wifes face thank god she finally walked away to go blabber with her friends some more. 

After a short wait we were seated. Asked what type of water we preferred and given our menu's. 

Atmosphere
The dining room was dark, busy, full of life, and very nice. It had a modern feel and comfortable seating. It was not very large and had a very intimate feel. The servers are very quick and are always around when needed. The air is clean, the music quietly present, and the conversation lively. We went late at night so it is hard to say what it is like at other hours but the place was buzzing on that thursday evening.

Service
Our waiter was very busy but I never felt like I was being neglected or was waiting very long. Our glasses never got more then half empty and our needs were reverified at regular intervals enough that we felt cared for but not to the point we were annoyed. The waiter was knowledgeable and provided solid food recommendations. His choice was a hit and me and the wife really enjoyed our time there.

The Food
Our selections
The Bosco Pizza and French Fries
The bosco pizza was outstanding me and my wife love mushrooms and the puree of them really made the mushrooms present in every single bite. The crust was thin and crispy the ricotta and mozzarella blended spectacularly. The truffle oil added a nice rich flavor to the pizza and gave it a high class kick. It was stellar pizza and well worth the money. 

The fries were not bad but were just missing something and I know exactly what that is. Covering fries in parmigiana cheese and truffle oil is great but it needs some sort of dip. If they would have provided a nice aioli on the side this would be one hell of a dish. Without that I was left with tasty fries that were just too dry to really enjoy and too elegant to smother with ketchup. 

Final thoughts
A 4.45 star dining experience but not quite a 5. If you are up late and hungry and want something a little fancy give this place a shot.",pkP3z8r_3mmkHZ7EuiVahg,1,1,4,V-7jbePPwRab-7cg0bxSGw

But, we happened to score some tickets for Le Reve last night, so we decided to check out the restaurant week offerings at Wynn/Encore after the show.  I was sad to see this was the only dinner offering in the hotel, as I would have loved to taste the others.  I didn't have huge expectations here, but I was pleasantly surprised and we enjoyed our meal.  It was the most food I've eaten in awhile and felt more full here than when I go to a buffet, so I felt like the $50 was a good bargain.

We ordered cocktails, and I got my usual Ketel One Martini, and they brought me blue cheese olives, yum.  My husband had the prickly pear margarita, which was delicious.  Both were very overpriced but mixed perfectly.

They brought us a bread basket that had this INSANE cheese flatbread that I couldn't stop eating.  Instead of butter or olive oil/balsamic to go with the bread, they had some homemade pesto.  My husband and I both do not like pesto sauce, it is a little too ""herby"" tasting for us.  However, this pesto was marvelous, and we literally inhaled it.  Gave me a whole new appreciation for pesto sauce and I want to try to start making it at home.

For appetizers we had the pepperoni pizza and the warm goat cheese salad.  Both were huge portions, and we could have only eaten these two dishes and could have been done with our meal.  The pizza is done more ""italian american"" style, and thin, and doesn't look like anything special when you get it.  But the flavors are very good, and the ingredients were quality.  The salad I had was refreshing and tasty, I loved the flavors of the roasted mushrooms and corn together with the creamy avocado and goat cheese.

For our main course my husband had the braised short rib with barolo wine, glazed shallot in port wine, and I had the seared sea scallops.  The short rib was completely fork tender moist and delicious.  The sauce was very complex, deep, and flavorful.  I don't eat a lot of short ribs because they are so fatty and rich, but this was my favorite.  The scallops were seared perfectly, and the first thing I thought when I saw them, was that Gordon Ramsay would have been pleased had it been served in Hell's Kitchen.  The scallops were seasoned fairly aggressively with salt and pepper which were a little overwhelming at first but when paired with the vegetables (zucchini and tomatoes) were delicious.

At this point we were both full and not looking forward to desert.  We never ever order desert, but because it was restaurant week, we had desert.  My husband had the lemon meringue slice, with a vanilla sauce and raspberries, and I had the bombolini.  The lemon slice was cool and refreshing, and so flavorful.  The raspberries were majorly fresh.  My bombolini was over the top and literally had me uncomfortable the rest of the night.  These were piping hot amoretti and ricotta beignets with nutella running out of them.  Oh my lord!  These were so good.  They took so long in serving the desert and I couldn't understand why until I got these, they made them fresh for me!  The nutella was like eating molten lava and the whole thing tasted good in the homemade cream to dip them in.

A very good, heavy meal, and definitely worth the restaurant week price.  I don't know if I would go here again for a regular meal, as the prices are pretty high.  But I was very satisfied.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,1,1,4,N1BVT0YM8mhXYYdo7WApOQ

Given the prices I expected to get better quality than the Olive Garden, but it was only marginally better...

My calamari was heavily breaded and rubbery - it had to be frozen food service calamari or frozen from a bad like you'd get at Safeway.  It couldn't have been fresh.  The scallops were tasty, but over salted and very small - not the very large sea scallops I'm used to in quality restaurants.

My wife's pizza was really good - thin crispy crust and very nicely done.  Her bucatini was too peppery and tasted like it was a sauce from a jar.

The highlight was dessert - the tiramisu and toffee chocolate cake were great!  They were probably bought in too (do they make anything in house?) but they were really good!

However, the pizza, bombolini and fries were all amazingly good.  Perhaps I'm just addicted to mushrooms, truffle oil and nutella? The hostess can spread nutella all over her ugly hater face and I'd still eat it. Bombolini..I'm still thinking about it. We came before 2 am, so I really know what I am talking about now. I think as long as you order the right food, this place place will always be worth a visit. My food baby is once again happy and satisfied. I'll try visiting this place next time naked.",7961wYcrm-zWEkE7kz0tPg,4,4,5,dBPxl-wJx0VLToWGaAvzag

went with a large party, and they were the only ones that could accomodate. 

Food was overall OK, but wasn't worth it. 
clam appetizer: tasted great
Steak: solid but expensive
Black Bass: looked better than it tasted
Pastas: looked and tasted like they were microwaved packaged and tossed in a bowl
Pork Chop: incredibly salty and both orders were sent back

Go somewhere else, Wynn/Encore dining is usually much better than this.",Eglk-WIDWUVUjz9LtpXffw,0,0,2,uOxFqT1ZFNIYz7ABDIJzgQ

The Bosco pizza is freakin' ridiculous.  The white truffle oil will put you over the edge.  Just when you thought pizza couldn't get any better you found out it could. The pizza was so good, we came back the very next night for the Bosco again!  It was seriously like crack, and the BEST crack out there! For dessert the Tiramisu and Bambolini (small donuts filled with nutella) were the icing on top of an already VERY satisfying experience. 

Amazing food, wonderful service, open super late, and great ambiance!

Seattle needs a Stratta...seriously.",ZJofh3rrsXQYnz35CYOYSg,4,3,5,63PDyYWVYsE6Zymkdta_LA

I've been coming here for 5 years just for this pasta. Yeah it costs 50 bucks, but i dont care. Its the best thing on the menu.

I know i've had other things here, like the meat ball spaghetti, and some other things, but the LOBSTER FRA DIA VOLO is truly the best seafood pasta ever!

It is slightly spicy.... i put more red peppers to make it even more spicy! yum.
It comes with big nugs of lobster and big rock shrimp.

stratta is pretty casual dining, they are open late, if not 24 hours. 

i stroll in here with a nice buzz after leaving XS...

this is my vegas version of dennys. haha... yeah i guess i'm fancy :)",xWCDD4AVIVjDfLZp5Qc5yQ,0,0,5,G6O4bu7KwfnjCJxr8mSvhw
5781776,2011-04-16,0,0xzmIBsJQc5eUNLucFrZ0Q,"I have a very good feeling that a lot Stratta's business comes from the fact it is is open till the wee hours of the night and for Wynn hotel guests who return from a night debauchery, its an insanely convenient place to refuel. For convenience, I give this place 14 stars, but for the quality of the actual food, it's just nothing special. Now, I like staying at the Wynn so I can pretty much guarantee I will end up eating at Stratta many, many more times. I suppose its possible the execution of the regular dinner menu is much better, but I 'm not  sure. However, if you are looking for some late night eats, Stratta is likely to be one of your only convenient options so just stick to the basics pizza and pasta... you'll appreciate the extra carbs the next morning.",Z3vY6CM1aSJcyDMrFfhPIw,1,0,2,qSlC1bS_2niSAR5S5LJOkg

I'll mention that I ate here right after a horrible experience at La Cave, also in the Wynn hotel. So I was not happy, but in a little hurry to eat a decent meal.

I have to say, I really didn't care for the salad I ordered, but the service, attention to detail was above and beyond. 

My server's name was Joe, great, attentive, friendly service. The chef, who I was told was pretty new, really went out of his way to care for his patrons. He went around to every table, greeted them, thanked them for dining in his restaurant and asked about the food. I ate alone, and got the same attention as the groups and families dining there.

Hostess, bussers and water service was PERFECT!

It was nice to be treated respectfully and have impeccable service. Stratta does it right! It's a beautiful spot for a romantic meal or a fun, swanky dinner & drinks with friends. I would come back again just for the service, it made all the difference.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,0,0,5,yX0Z3_IRDXWeraSYwCpZeQ

The appetizers looked and were delicious (buratta and salads). The entrees left an awkward silence. We got had. However this appreared to be the jam late night...

- place to sit and chill coz your shoes are killing you from dancing in 4-5inch heels all night
- watching all the drunk people pass through the Wynn casino
- good times

- breakfast food at 3am... MMM eggs and sausages",2Gy7OX3zFVfNeeHLhmpzJw,2,2,4,y77GGCw8wEyLK9gHrjOjTA

We started with appetizers - Clams Casino for me and Beef Carpacchio for Carol. My clams were just average while the carpacchio was excellent. Entrees consisted of the stuffed Pork chop for me which was very good and Salmon for Carol which was just okay. We also ordered a side of fries - not sure why, since both our meals came with potatoes or rice. The fries, however, were excellent.

Our dinner was accompanied by a bottle of Clos Pegas, which was excellent.

All in all, a nice experience but not overwhelming. Prices were a little high for the portions and I felt the dining area was way too loud - maybe I'm just getting old.

Definitely will give it another try in the future.",0_NbnQy2AwOUDtDUr4uDTg,0,0,3,bzR1vvDDwxbzGiiZx-uRrw
