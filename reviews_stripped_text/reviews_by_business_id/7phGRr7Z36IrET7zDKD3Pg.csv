The service is great everyone is friendly and checks on you and the food is so tasty. I had a wet birria burrito , it was so delicious and full of flavor. I wanna go back soon. Even the chips and salsa are good. I recommend coming here for a real Mexican dish.",M6xFOgQu0pG7KxukSuuhJg,1,0,5,iV72euUNSO49yYYZNZmJIg

1050353,2014-08-04,0,7phGRr7Z36IrET7zDKD3Pg,"Visited Tony's for the first time. Nice people, clean restaurant and good food. 

Ordered one pastor and three chicken tacos. All come prepared with the usual toppings including salsa. The chicken was all shredded white meat. Very tender, but not over the top on flavor. The pastor was amazing. The texture was more of a stew then spit-grilled. Had amazing flavor and practically melted in my mouth.  

It's worth noting that there is no salsa bar. Normally this would bother me, but the salsa (pico de gallo I should say) they serve the tacos with is very tasty.

Watched tv while I ate. Also watched somebody get busted in the parking lot. Added to the ambiance for sure.  

The chicken, while good, was not amazing hence the four stars. Other than that, go for it!

Oh, before I forget, the prices are really good. The tacos are $1.50 a pop. Don't forget to hit the tip jar!",hyBENyHJ43GH8OsTRiT6kw,1,0,4,0-l-4nDtTZAUsAoIYqlv0g
1135217,2015-06-22,0,7phGRr7Z36IrET7zDKD3Pg,Junk! Hardly any chicken in taco or burrito ..burrito was full of beans and rice and barely any chicken! Would not recommend.,8Whujmygu-0yElsO2ckmHw,1,0,1,8ut0zk1jol7AIhx2hKqh7g
1308835,2016-05-01,1,7phGRr7Z36IrET7zDKD3Pg,"Ma' and Pa' taco shop. I ordered two asada burritos without rice to go.  That's grilled skirt steak for my English speaking friends.  They where wrapped nice and fat,  with beans and Pico de gallo.  I also got the  Chicken salad.  It was a bed of iceberg lettuce a couple slivers of tomato and radishes with lots of chopped grilled Chicken breast.  All in all very fresh and good.",RoJCMSycQZGEefAh8-OHJg,2,1,4,6eoptaj1FXd_NwCz7EEH1w
1645689,2018-05-28,0,7phGRr7Z36IrET7zDKD3Pg,"The low score isn't for the food. It gets 4 stars. The service from my cashier, 5 stars. Very helpful. The cook/manager flat refused to make a substitution of the meat on an order of nachos. Not closing time, only one other customer in the restaurant. Her response was ""no"". Offered to pay difference if there was a cost difference. Still no. It wasn't for something unusual , just something other than carne asade. So it's time to find a restaurant that can make carnitas or chili verde nachos because you won't get them or anything special at Tony's.",f5Wj7qcQCX_mSdKnRQTD_A,0,0,1,H6z1i9Lg9Jfvfu4bXFhNPg

1667325,2017-11-17,0,7phGRr7Z36IrET7zDKD3Pg,my issue here is not the food its the service. i have been here 3 times and each time it has gotten worse. The 1st time I went everything was fine and I enjoyed the food. The 2nd time I went I wanted to get a pound of meat with the broth that it gets cooked in which they stated that I was not able to get the broth. After speaking with the kitchen and getting approval they were able to give me what I wanted however when I asked for the dinner special the cashier turned to me and said it's past 7 o'clock the special no longer is valid the time with 702pm I had arrived at the restaurant at 6:45 p.m. This 3rd and last time was the deal breaker we came in to buy a pound of meat and it was listed on the menu when we asked about it she said it was no longer available but we could buy the dinner plate the dinner play and the pound of meat  were the same price except for the dinner plate you would get half of the amount of meat. Over all i enjoyed the meals that I've had there but I'm sick and tired of the service and lack of customer service I will not be returning and I would not suggest for you to go there,cqy-OvaSX5fCiL6F6_Rffw,0,0,2,VioGU_f4VdhDqpqIp_79gQ

2278838,2017-06-06,0,7phGRr7Z36IrET7zDKD3Pg,I saw the other reviews and thought - I'll try it- I came for lunch - first of all the loud obnoxious television was too much - stupid games shows in Spanish - you just can't get away from it- forget conversations with friends - terrible decor and the service was bad - part of my lunch order was with chips and salsa - never got it - the beer arrived after the tacos - NOT what the other reviews said at all!  Won't be back - try somewhere else - the carne asada tasted tainted and really after everything else??  Plus it is 103 degrees outside and no a/c and no ceiling fans turned on!,5Y2x8yCGB3RvGaJlckmH5w,0,0,1,AEjbGVI_CRjbZmvBs6mPJg

4124462,2016-01-24,0,7phGRr7Z36IrET7zDKD3Pg,"Very clean and smelled delicious when I walked in. Ordered the pork dinner. I was a little concerned when she brought it to me 3/4 minutes later but it was delicious!
I was disappointed at the amount of fat on my plate and piled it on the side of my plate to show my server. She said she would let the kitchen know.
I was surprised when she came back with a portion of pork larger than the fat I'd set aside. They seem to value their customers! 
This will not be the last time I eat here and I will recommend this place to anyone who is wanting delicious Mexican food!",Wzkcw6VAi0UUlqD2Ktq5Qw,2,1,4,oYQnLfFyADV8C2bFtyxkPA

The women that work here are rude, sassy, and there is a MAJOR language barrier that has lead to me being over charged on multiple occasions as well as having food made incorrectly. Sadly, my order is just NEVER what I ask for. There's also a HORRIBLE stench in the restaurant, so if you do decide to try this place, take it to go.
