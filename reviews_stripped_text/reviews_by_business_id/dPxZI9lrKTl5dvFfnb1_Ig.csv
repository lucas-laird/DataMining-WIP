Our water and pops never went empty.  We were very impressed by the staff especially being former food and beverage people.   Hubby had fettuccine Bolognese and I had the canneloni.  We brought home fettuccine Alfredo for our son.  We also had the mozzarella balls for appetizer.  Everything was really good and the portions are huge! Their regular marinara sauce is delicious,  not over nor under seasoned.  The olive oil dip they bring with bread is super delicious, I think with herbs in it.  It's a nice casual family friendly place.  I will definitely bring my friends and family when they come to visit.  You can go dressed up or in jeans and a t-shirt.   To top it all off, it is very affordable.  Especially when you consider the portion sizes.  We had an appetizer, 3 entrees, 2 pops, a nice glass of pinot noir for under 80 bucks.

We have been searching the city for a good Italian restaurant that has eat-in and take-out service and we just hit the jackpot.  The food is spectacular.  We wanted take-out this evening so this was a perfect test to see how good the food was and how well it would hold up for a short drive home.  We started off with the arancini.  One order included 4 enormous, freshly made arancini.  These were the best I ever had.  The order came with a side of sauce.  This was a zesty, home-made sauce, not the sweet stuff that passes for sauce in most Vegas restaurants.  Next, we split a Caesar salad.  The salad was large enough for two.  It was cold, crisp and fresh as a salad should be served.  We both opted for the chicken parmesan this evening.  The chicken parmesan comes with a side of angel hair pasta.  The chicken breast was enormous and so was the portion of pasta.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was juicy and tender, while the breading was crisp.  The pasta was perfectly al dente.  Again, the chicken parm and the pasta was served with a homemade zesty (not sweet) sauce that we have been craving.  This main course also comes with a side of homemade knots.  They were tender and perfectly chewy.  I assume that these are made from their pizza dough as I also make my knots from my homemade pizza dough.  We finished off this perfect dinner with their homemade cheese cake and chocolate cheese cake.  Again, true perfection.  The cakes were not overly sweet but still rich and decadent.  Also of note, when they packed our meals to go they made sure to pack all the hot food in one bag and all the cold food in another.  I cannot tell you how many times we have gotten take-out and other restaurants have put a hot entrée on top of a cold salad or on top of a cold desert.

We were previously pretty dedicated to Montesano's as our regular pizza place and, like apparently a lot of people, desperate to find a suitable replacement -- that it would be located in the exact same space would just be a convenient bonus. 

Unfortunately, the search continues. :-/

We did a large half cheese/half pepperoni, it was just over $16 (there's a $1 charge for take out, apparently, which is...fine ¯\_(?)_/¯) and it was incredibly mediocre. I think the photo kind of speaks for itself, but it was basically the taste/look of a pizza they'd serve in a high school cafeteria. It definitely is pizza, but it's not really what you wanted. 

(It's about the same level of fulfillment as Blaze, just down the street, in my opinion. Definitely not the  new regular spot I was so ardently hoping for.)

The guy that answered the phone was super nice and the staff inside was nice, and it's possible that their actual entrees are where they excel and the pizza is just an afterthought, but for our experience, and what we were looking for them to do, it comes up pretty short.",hkZrCKtDkD4PeOlcVAXNpw,5,0,2,ybl97jPrEQuhIPeYQFgSiA

We went mid-day for lunch on a Monday and loved our experience. The food was lovely and our server was nice enough to comp our desserts and affogato for us.

I strongly recommend my dish the lobster ravioli over my friend's tricolore gnocchi (and I rarely say that about potato dishes ever) simply because the pink vodka ravioli sauce is to die for! Spongebob and Plankton knew what they were talking about when they said that ravioli secrets were worth fighting for.

Cautionary tale that their desserts are no joke in size, with cream puffs the size of saucers and truffles richer than Donald Trump. Honestly, it's like these desserts got their degrees and went back for grad school. Then to top off our visit, their affogatos were a great balance of creamy and bitter deliciousness.

There was simply no downside to our visit, I would definitely like to come back soon to try their carvery entrees.",-fVKgpmSu0tDnf_xBPqU4A,2,1,4,NeKKDrc2uKfQ6gCgzwPdUg

She ordered the gnocchi which was okay. When I ordered the Mediterranean linguine which is supposed to be scallops and shrimp in a light cream red sauce, I had asked the waited if the seafood was fresh or frozen. 

His response was ""yes they are fresh...as fresh as they can be, cause we are in vegas"". To which I replied, ""what?""

He replied ""yes, they are fresh""

Later he came back and said they were out of scallops. Suspect sir.

He offered some alternatives to which I proceeded to order mussels in place of the scallops. 

When I tasted both the shrimp and mussels they were both obviously from frozen. If not they were cooked suspiciously. The sauce was like hot red milk with no flavor. 

Overall, suspect. For $24, that seafood pasta should be fresh or cooked better.

The waiter also mentioned that the Mediterranean linguine was one of their most popular items.

It's family owned and that gives that personal touch that you can't find in the chain restaurants; I met Milena, her husband Ninni, her brother Pasquale, her son Giovanni, Laura the waitress, and they were all so nice to me and my family! I like the atmosphere because it feels like being in a real Italian trattoria, I like the table clothes on the tables (typical in Italian restaurants but not here in the states), the bread is phenomenal, they make it with pizza dough and it's still warm when they bring it to the table, and the list goes on. I and my family will definitely go back to Trattoria Italiana!  

We went there again for my husband's birthday the other day and we both had pizza: it was really good and I'm going to post pictures so you can see what I'm talking about!",3sL6Tp_GXCucGc2Nvcl60A,0,0,5,ZawfiJqO-ns_sNtjrE6QRg

Trattoria Italia is located in the location formerly Montesano's.  Its easily spotted from Eastern with plenty of parking.  Going with a fellow Yelper Stefany means I'll be trying more than one thing.  I always say yes to that!

We decided to start with the Eggplant Ripieni.  Great decision on Stefany's part.  It's a bubbling baked dish resting in sauce and covered in cheese.  The sauce is flavorful and goes well with the complimentary garlic knot basket.  This appetizer is fantastic! 

For the main attractions we split the special of the day Mushroom risotto and the Orecchiette. The mushroom risotto is incredible.  The huge dish of risotto was creamy and delectable.  I didn't want to stop eating.   But since we had another entree so I had to.  

The Orecchiette is served with broccoli rabe and sausage.  The buttery pasta was combined with plenty of sausage and broccoli.  Again this was a giant dish of food.  We had plenty to take home for a second meal.  

Dessert? They have a case at the entrance filled with plenty of tasty treats.  I was feeling quite full but couldn't say no to a cannoli.  But instead of the large I went with a mini cannoli.  The cannoli is fresh and indulgent.  The shell was crisp with no sogginess.  Yum! 

To top off the amazing food, we had wonderfully attentive service.  She was good about keeping up with our water intake.  It was a great experience and I hope to be back soon for more!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,45,39,5,oQ7uuK-ziBOndyTVQZjHfg

Carbs are great and all, but I tend to make poor choices as to the quantity and frequency in which I indulge. In short, I need to be supervised. Cue Bethany E. She joined me for lunch here at Trattoria Italia to keep my carb intake in check. Long story short: we failed.

EGGPLANT RIPIENI: This baked eggplant dish is similar to eggplant parmesan but without the breading of most versions. Vegetable, sauce, and cheese, served bubbling. Goes great with the garlic knots, and the portion is large enough to serve as an entree.
MUSHROOM RISOTTO: Special dish of the day but delicious enough to deserve a spot on the menu. Giant portion, saucy and packed with a variety of mushrooms. I couldn't get enough of this. Awesome vegetarian entree, may be even better with chicken. 
ORECCHIETTE: Little ears pasta, my fave. Chewy, tender, tiny pasta pieces. This version is tossed with a light oil, broccoli rabe, and a rave-worthy sausage. This portion was the largest of them all and could easily be split and shared. 

Our giant lunch was so filling and delicious that only a small late dinner was needed. The hefty portion of leftovers was helpfully escorted to Bethany's home rather than my own. Service was attentive without being intrusive, and location is cozy for a quiet date or ample catch-up conversation with friends.

The canolli's are ok.  The filling is good but the shell not so much.  It would be better if they filled them at time of order.  Service isn't the best since they have a small staff so be prepared to wait and reservations a must in the evenings, as there is limited seating.

My husband and I actually stumbled across this gem and absolutely fell in love! The staff is on point, they all speak Italian, which I love, they are super courteous and go above and beyond with their hospitality. 

The food is truly outstanding! They also have an in-house pastry chef who makes superb Italian deserts. Their cappuccino is fabulous paired with a couple of their pastries, a perfect way of ending your dinner! Everytime my husband and I visit Trattoria Italia we are full for days.

1772291,2017-03-26,0,dPxZI9lrKTl5dvFfnb1_Ig,"I really wanted to like this restaurant more. We came with friends who had eaten here many times and raved about it. That set the bar very high - maybe that was the problem. Our server was Santini, the owner. Very personable and very welcoming. Another reason for wanting to like it more. And they honored our reservation when they were very busy on a Saturday night. Still another significant plus.
So why only 3 stars. They brought the bread knots to the table right away. A hold over from Montesano's (the prior Italian restaurant in this location)?? The knots they served were a bit stale as if they had been on the counter in the kitchen way too long. Didn't stop me from eating them, but they really weren't great. We started with a salad. The $9 salad was more than enough for 4 of us to share and still have some left over. A suggestion to Santini - offer a half size salad for $5 so that when I come with just 2 people, I can still order the salad without having to throw out half. For my entree, I ordered the chicken Marsala. It came with a side of pasta. The portion was large - no leaving here hungry. It was good, not great. My wife shared the chicken parmigiana with her friend. They split it in the kitchen for them - a nice touch. And the portion was huge. More than enough for 2 to share. Again, good but not great. My friend ordered the orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage. Now that was a good dish.
So overall, it is a solid local Italian restaurant where you can go to eat, but not a place to go to dine. I will try it again. I really do want to like it more.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,1,0,3,ahMLKNIigTCkVWPbE-kb5Q

2. Lighting is 2X  brighter than it should be.

4. Our server would rate somewhere between ""bland"" and ""cold"". 

5. The owner stood literally 1 foot to my left talking to the other table for at least 10 to 15 minutes. This was highly annoying - and not to mention, intrusive. 
 
** The place is ""new"" - I guess.... That is really all it has going for it. Location probably does not hurt either, so people might ""fall"" for it.

When you pull up it looks like a extremely small store in a strip mall. I was expecting 5 tables and a counter. When entering you're presented with two dining rooms which could easily seat 70 people. The place looks rustic and very much what you find in Italy. There are quite a few family size tables and the decor makes you feel at home. Sinatra was on the radio and the staff treats you like family. There were wine racks in the dining room as well as a wooden shelf with various items like olives, olive oil, canned tomatoes, pasta, etc. The lighting was dark but it fit the mood.
 
I found through speaking to the owner that it is family owned and they are from Sicily. Both him and the chef had a very thick accent and they were very humble. As guests entered I noticed that they were conversing in Italian with the owner. This place really seems like the local Italian spot in Henderson.

As for the food: I have finally found an Italian restaurant that doesn't over cooked pasta and freeze meatballs. The food is obviously fresh and the chefs puts his heart into the food.

We decided to try it anyway. They seated us immediately, which was amazing considering how many larger parties were waiting to be seated. We were a party of 2. We were seated at a very small table in the very back, and literally squeezed in. It's as if they found out the max seating they could get by with and stuffed tables in. I'd recommend they take out 2 small tables for 2 in that back area, along with a table for 4 in the other, larger, seating area. They've crammed too many tables in the eatery...and if you aren't comfortable sitting there, then why even go eat there? Let's put it this way: They had to ask the other small table of 2 to get up so they could serve us our food. We were that packed in. The food was okay. What we both had was bland. It just needed more seasoning. The service was really great. And I mean that. I think the staff really work very hard. I wish I could give them 3 stars based on that, but the experience was not that good. They even gave us a free dessert to go, which was fantastic.

This is a new location for this restaurant, so maybe they'll refine the number of tables and add a bit more seasoning to their food.

I've lived in Las Vegas for 20 years and seen many ""Italian"" places come and go. Most are New York Italian but this is the first (off-strip) since (old) Roma Deli that is actually run by Italians! 

This is no deli though. It's a Trattoria which is a type of restaurant in Italy where you can enjoy home cooked Italian food for a reasonable price, and this is exactly that type of establishment.

The dad comes in the morning to cook the sauces, dolci etc. and then the rest of the family come in throughout the day to operate the restaurant. You can tell as soon as you step through the door that the place has a buzz. The decor is cosy and warm but I think it's the personalities that really make the atmosphere what it is. 

I love good food & wine, hearing the chattering of people, the clinking of glasses and the waiters talking back and fourth in Italian because it reminds me of Italy. Some lady on the table next to me wasn't a fan of the guys speaking in Italian or something and complained; I was relieved when I heard the owner tell her politely that if she doesn't like people speaking in Italian then maybe this wasn't the place for her.

Can't wait to come back! This is my new favorite spot and I will be happy to refer them any business i can to help compensate for people who can't stand authentic restaurants....I hope those people choke on their never ending salad bar!

Most of the staff and owners are Sicilian, and over 80% of them speak with heavy Italian accents. The food and sauces are all extremely well prepared, with a number of surprises. And the desert counter, which are all freshly made here on premises, look and taste like an old world Italian pastry shop.
All the appetizers and entrées have surprising flavors and composition. The one not to miss is the calamari appetizer, which also has Italian tempura vegetables and shrimp in it. This is an entrée and itself. Also under the appetizer menu are the clams and mussels marinara.

I had the eggplant parmesan as my entree and fried mozzarella balls as an appetizer. The cheese tasted so fresh; it reminded me of my trip to Naples. There was so much delicious dessert to choose from. I wanted to try the tiramisu- and it was delicious. 

While I was there, I noticed that the restaurant was expanded with a new private dining/banquet room. I was so impressed with my experience that I decided to schedule our next company dinner there, as the new expansion can comfortably hold 80+ people and the price was extremely affordable.

It is my go-to restaurant when I have friends visiting from out of town because I am always confident they will enjoy their food. 
I love their garlic knots, fried mozzarella, and their antipasto appetizer is amazing, I highly recommend it. I usually always get a pasta dish or gnocchi and they're always so accommodating if I want a different sauce than what's listed on the menu or if I'd like to add in a different protein. Their pizzas are also really delicious.
The TIRAMISU is out of control good. The cannolis are authentic as it gets too.
I personally love that it is an family run Italian restaurant, and I love way they absolutely stick to authentic Italian cooking. They don't over salt everything like Maggiano's or other chain restaurants, the pasta is ALWAYS cooked perfectly, and they still know American taste because the portions are huge, and you can honestly be as big of a fat kid as you want at this place.

I personally also love that Trattoria Italia is informal because it feels so welcoming, like you're walking into a friend's place. Is that cheesy? It's true though. You can come here for a date, just after work, on a Sunday evening when you look like a bum, it doesn't matter. I've even come here once with my fiancee right after the gym. 
In my experience, I've never had to wait longer than what seemed normal for my food or check to come to the table, and I've been there on busy nights. Yes, there are places that have gotten my food out faster, but again, it's never been so long that we all start asking ""ok where's our food?""
The price point of this place is also great. I don't think it's expensive at all. It's not cheap, and it's not cheap food, but it's still way cheaper than many Italian places, if not most.

The good:

Spaghetti cooked well. Sauce was good. Meatballs good. 

I had Pizza with hot Italian Sausage and mushrooms. Very good crust, sauce, spicy sausage and mushrooms. 

Orecchiette was OK, but kind of boring. 

The bad:

Table bread was hard, cold, old and burnt.

Pizza crust was burned badly...not in a good way. Love a well done crust, but this one just tasted burnt. 

Orecchiette was sitting in a bowl of water. Not sure if it wasn't drained properly or maybe just from the veggies?

Diet Coke was expired. Diet drinks don't age well and the dates need to be closely monitored. Mine was beyond the date.

1 caesar salad        $9.00
1 antipasto misto  $13.00

we got home and immediately started eating. upon tasting the caesar dressing, i noticed it had no flavor whatsoever. it tasted like flour mixed w/water... it was weird.  we called and very politely let the woman on the phone know that they may want to taste the dressing as it was completely flavorless.  we have caesar dressing here at home so this wouldnt have been a big deal, if her response wouldve been appropriate... she acted like we were bothering her by calling!!! like we got it for free or something!!! she could not care less .. no apology, no ""hey, thx for lettn us kno!"", nothing. just ""ok"", ""ok"", ""ok"", bye!!?

Mozzarella balls were HUGE, and although, just 4 pieces in an order, they were perfect for 2 people. It was breaded nicely, not oily at all, and oooeeey gooey in the middle.

Lasagna has to be my favorite lasagna for the meer fact that it wasn't heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love me some baked lasagna that's cheesy and thick but, this was quite refreshing with the great amount of red sauce. 

Don't forget to ask for the bread knots because (when hot and fresh) they go great with the aforementioned sauce of the lasagna.

To begin with, most food comes out way under salted and under seasoned. Very bland. If you send it back it comes out just fine the second time around, but when sending food back just to achieve flavor becomes their M.O., something isn't right. 

Positives: pizza is good, cioppino is good, and lobster ravioli is great. 

Negatives: food is very under flavored, service at the front is very pushy. Prices are too high for what you're getting. Oh, and their caprese salad has microscopic amounts of basil, and a copious amount of spinach and lettuce. Seriously?! I didn't order a house salad with tomato and mozzarella. 

As for the staff, I've just come across much more accommodating staff elsewhere. Customer service and family atmosphere is definitely lost in this dive.

Putting aside all biases from my former love of Montesano's, it really is not the best restaurant around. So many other places I will go to in the future besides trattoria.

4049262,2017-03-08,1,dPxZI9lrKTl5dvFfnb1_Ig,"I am not not an Italian food fan, but I wanted to try Trattoria Italiana due to the good review on Yelp. I arrived with a bottle of wine in my hand and had a reservation at 7pm. The ristorante was full and around 10 to 15 people were waiting at the entrance. The owner look at my reservation and  I got a warm welcome. No problem with the wine ($15 corkage fee).
After a minutes we have been seated in the back room at a very nice table. Waiter came immediately serving some filtered water and drop some bread with olive oil at the table. Open the wine with a smile  and telling us the specials. The room was full and all table were taking. We Ordered some Calamari  (sauted) and Insulate Italiana for appetizer. 3 plates of pasta . My friend was happy to get the gluten free option. The owner touch the table during main course. My spaghetti were perfectly al dente. Dessert was tiramissu and the waiter was very nice to get out of his way to bring a little bit of raspberry and blackberry to my friend who is glutten free and dairy free. The food was serve in large portions . The service was exceptional. The prices very reasonable. The welcome from the owner was magnificent. A special thank you to DANNY R, our server who take is time, to explain the menu, give recommendation, open our wine, always smiling , spoke quietly with no rush to a difficult table of 3 who had 1 gluten-free dairy free, 1 vegan, an 1 normal menu.

This is our second time eating here and it was as good this time around as it was the first time. The garlic knots (which are complimentary) were warm, fresh, and delicious.

We got the mozzarella balls as an appetizer. Amazing  The balls are gigantic and the cheese is fresh. It's served on a bed of marinara which is super flavorful (if you can make the garlic knots last, the marinara sauce would go great with it). 

For the main course I ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It's my go to Italian dish and I am heavily judgemental of places based off of how well this dish fairs. I have to give it an A+. The fettuccine noodles were cooked al dente and there was just the right amount of sauce.

4382402,2017-04-23,2,dPxZI9lrKTl5dvFfnb1_Ig,"I had mixed feelings about this new Italian spot. I came in wanting to like this place and the experience started out well. Pros are that there is plenty of parking, menu prices are reasonable, and I enjoyed my meal. Cons are that they are new so there are service kinks to work out and the sweets were not good.

On a Sunday evening my husband and I were looking for a casual Italian spot to grab dinner. Service started out great with a prompt seating even though they were busy. Our waitress greeted us quickly, drink orders were taken, and rolls were served. 

The rolls to start were okay. I enjoyed them, but it wasn't like bread at other restaurants that draws me back in. I also had a glass of the house Muscato. Nice flavor, but it had a carbonated texture that turned me off a bit.

Chicken Marsala with a side of pasta was calling my name. It was a large serving that included two pieces of chicken. The portion was perfect since I wanted to save half for my lunch the next day. I really enjoyed the Chicken Marsala and would order this dish again. My side of Sautéed Spinach was loaded with garlic and delicious as well. My husband had Ravioli and said it compared to the canned version kids love. He said he would never return here based on his dish. 

The waitress that had been friendly and attentive went MIA around the time the check should have arrived. By the time the check finally showed up I was armed with credit card to speed up the process, but she dropped and ran. Thus began the long wait for her to return to get the card and close us out. 

While that wait began I went to the dessert counter to get goodies to go. It took an unreasonable amount of time to even get the owner to acknowledge my presence. Since they were busy I started out patient, but it ended up being excessive. He finally acknowledged me, but then the phone rang and he asked if he could grab it. I run into the same situation at my job so I was understanding and said it was fine, but then he didn't come back to me after the call. He wandered away and the process began again. I should have taken this as a sign, but I waited and ordered four desserts. 

The desserts looked great in the case, but three of the four ended up in the trash. I'm a huge sweets person, but these were just a waste of calories. Texture and taste were all wrong on three of the four. The fourth I ate just out of confusion that it could really be so flavorless. 

Overall, my meal was pretty good and the pricing was low compared to other Italian options in the area. I also like that the restaurant is casual making it a good option for families or nights where dressing up just isn't enticing. The bad service and bad sweets ruled this out for future dining out experiences, but I would consider them for take-out in the future.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,8,3,2,EyU5cyDEM00usKFXiYuH6g

So, with great anticipation we invited our in-laws to share this great dining experience, except it wasn't so great. The bread knots were very good and the Caesar salad was good and large enough to serve 3-4. No complaints there. The rest of the family ordered pasta dishes that included sausage. They liked the hot spicy sausage but overall there wasn't much flavor and they said they would give their dishes a ""four."" That's not what I had hoped for. Then it came to my dish. I started with the veal cutlet with a Marsala sauce. The cutlet was an almost wafer thin veal slice that was breaded with something that reminded me of breading on something you would find in the freezer section. It was like a fine bread crumble, I'm not sure how to describe it. It just wasn't very good. The flavor was just awful. It tasted like it was cooked in rancid oil. I had my sister-in-law taste it because she once worked in a food research lab. ""What is that flavor?"" She didn't know but she would not eat it. A Marsala sauce, in most places has a very rich flavor but this was was extremely mild and flavorless. Usually when faced with a poor meal like this one I will just suck it up and enjoy the sauce and pasta, but the sauce was not very good. So, on this occasion I did something I have done only a couple times in my life (I'm retired, so that is a lot of years), I sent it back! I ordered Chicken Saltimbocca. My expectations were up, this would be great! Wrong! It too lacked flavor, very bland. The chicken was cooked well and had dollops of cheese on top but there was no other flavor. Usually the sauce and the pasta are the best part, but not on this night. There were no add in flavors like artichoke hearts, prosciutto, mushrooms  sauted onions  or olives. These will give flavor, but when you do not add these types of things and it is just the sauce, you really have to nail the sauce. The Marsala did have mushrooms but it wasn't enough to cover the weakness in the sauce. I have written a glowing review of this place before, but this was like I went to a totally different place. Was there a different cook? Did they change their sauce recipes? Because everyone else gave it a four, I will give it three stars. Based solely on my meals, I would give it a one. The people there are very friendly and I know they take pride in their restaurant, but it is unlikely I will return.",Vkm1ioi91E6RWprJb1RmfQ,0,0,4,d3A0WaD9QrICein18mZDJQ

4639883,2018-04-07,1,dPxZI9lrKTl5dvFfnb1_Ig,"I'm really disappointed in this place. I'm all for local businesses, but this one really dropped the ball. 
I had ordered their gluten-free pasta a few times in the past, always let them know I had an allergy and all was fine. Last weekend my husband picks up our order, we eat it and about 25 minutes later I get a phone call from them. Someone else had placed the same order with regular pasta around the same time we did, and they gave me their order. WOW! When someone informs you they have a food ALLERGY, you take serious precautions to ensure those allergens are avoided. You don't accidentally give them the wrong order!
That aside, I was willing to accept their apology for ruining my Saturday night (which was then spent mostly in the bathroom thanks to their screw up) and refund of my order. Nearly 7 days later I realize the refund still had not been issued. I contacted GrubHub who informed me a refund was not even being processed! GrubHub called them and they said they needed to speak to the owner before issuing my refund, who then said he was going to call me. 
I never received a call from him, but I did receive one from Yelp relaying the owner's message that he wanted to see how severe my reaction was before issuing the refund!!!!!! Are you freakin kidding me!? I explained it to the Yelp employee and was then finally issued a refund. I can't believe I had to even explain to someone the level of my allergy to justify a refund of an INCORRECT ORDER!
I understand mistakes happen but when it comes to food allergies in the restaurant business, mistakes  CANNOT happen! On top of that, the way this restaurant went about their own mistake was all kinds of awful. It's just not worth it in my opinion.",QXGyAO8YCzNMiARtT3_yJw,0,1,1,Z566qGRdnFNumEl5SOK14Q

The sauce was mild and the noodles had a perfect consistency. Even though I'm not usually a lasagne fan I would order this in the future. We split a large Caesar salad which would have served four people. There was a slight hint of anchovies but it was so mild it might just be my imagination. Basically, it was a very good dressing. They also served little knots of bread. Ours came out of the oven pipping hot. The olive oil had a hint of garlic which was too strong for my wife, I loved it.  Had the chicken Cacciatore which came with a side of angel hair pasta. The flavor was very good but there were too many red and green peppers. They needed to add a few mushrooms. Despite my seeming criticism, I'd order it again without hesitation. This place is a definite find and will be our number 1 Italian Restaurant. The only criticism is the service. Our server was observed working 9 tables so we had to wait a while for our check. Another server took pity on us and brought our bill.

The food was good but it was not very hot. We then ordered coffee and that was not hot. We did receive a comped desert of cookies and mini cannoli's. The table agreed that was the best part of this experience.

 When my husband received the check the server told us that she said she was sorry once already. She then took $9.00 off the check.

After about 4 months, we have been waiting to come here.  I like the menu and their flexibility as well.

1. Pasta - The wife ordered the Gnocchi with meat sauce and she really liked it.  I liked it as well, as the Gnocchi was both firm and tender and the meat sauce was very tasty.  They serve a very nice full serving and she brought some home for leftovers, there was so muhc.

I tried the Fettuccini aglio e olio with vegetables and asked for Vegan style, since my daughter is vegan and I was gonna give her some leftovers.  This was a fantastic dish. The fettuccini is home made, al dente, and the mix of garlic and oil was just right.  I really enjoyed the simple taste.  The veggies were cooked perfectly and very tasty as well.  I did not leave as much for her as leftovers as I intended...

2.  The pizza - ordered a large Pizza Capricchiosa, mozzerella, tomato sauce, artichokes, olives, ham and mushroom.  This was an excellent pizza, the mix of ingredients were just right.  The pizza crust was fairly firm and i was able to grasp it with one hand, fold it and bite into it the way i like to eat pizza.  

3.  Caprese and Garlic Knots - We ordered the Insalata Caprese to start and the mozzarella and tomatoes were fresh, and mixed with oil and balsamic just the right way.  We enjoyed this very much.  The garlic knots were so fresh and so easy to eat.  I am afraid that if you don't control yourself, you will end up eating way too much.

We brought a lot of the food home, as we were really sampling what they had.  We also enjoyed their Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay.  The espresso coffee was also great. 

All in all, a good place, good price and great service from everyone there.

I will be back.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,39,23,5,I5VmoHkayjzphisIee-3-Q

Lasagna , Meatballs and a Fettuccine pasta with cherry tomatoes and olive oil. Very easy process to order thru the app. Food arrived as promised on time. The problems as I see them are this. Carry out package is simple foil tins with paper tops. Really not designed to keep food warm and leak free. The Grubhub folks use the standard insulated bags for transport. The time to get to my house from the restaurant is literally 15 minutes tops. Well the food had to be reheated and the lasagna leaked thru the top lid. So many new modern to- go type containers are available that are microwave friendly. I recommend that they use this type. Sure they cost a bit more but add on the price for carry out. They already do. The food my guess wasnt that hot when the delivery guy showed up to get the order. Quality was average. I prefer Buon Gusto or Bootlegger.

The owners are very nice and helpful I will give them that. They work the dining room well checking on things. We sat at a middle table looking into the wait station. We sat for 10 minutes before we were told who our server would be but I guess they forgot to tell her. Lots of staff in the dining room running around but no one stopped to check on us for the 10 minutes. When we were approached we ordered an appetizer and a glass of wine and for another 10 minutes no wine to the table as everyone kept working the POS computer for orders. We stopped one of the openers who handled the wine delivery.
Mozzarella balls were very good and I had the Seafood Pasta which was very good and hot. Wife had the Eggplant park which the outer layer was hot but the interior was ice cold. Not a good fist experience but I hope they will get better and we will try again. They did deduct the eggplant from the final bill which is admirable.
What I noticed is that there is an over abundance of staff on the floor but all doing different things at the same tables. The Server who delivered the food kept getting the tables wrong or brining the wrong meal to a table. Again I hope that in time they fall into a rhythm.

Their calamari is sooo good with big shrimps in them!! A very nice gentleman told me that in Italy they eat their calamari with lemon only, the tomato sauce is just a big demand from the state :) , anyways, they are delicious! 

For my main course I ordered Gnocchi, this is my first time. I love it! The pasta itself is soooo tasty! I can't really describe it, very rich and tatsty. 

The only ""downside"" (not really) is that their portion is HUGE! Neither me nor my husband finished our entry. And my leftover is literally a regular Togo order portion lol!

We ordered the baked pasta and a Cesar salad. Now the downfall. This is the first Italian restaurant, that didn't order bread when first sitting down. Originally our order included the bowl of the minestrone. We let the guy who took our order that we would like our salad and soup before the pasta. At least 15 minutes go by and here comes our baked pasta which was great cause it came out so fast, but we never got our salad and soup. The lady who brought out the pasta said she would check on it. She took our pasta away and then the guy who had taken our order came out and apologized for the mix up and then told me that they didn't have any minestrone soup. 20 minutes now after we put in our original order, you just now tell us you don't have something we had order. Long story short, the food was great. The service was horrible!! Definitely will not be going back here just because the service was so bad!!

They have complimentary garlic knots which are so good! The service is really nice and everyone is super friendly. 
I ordered the chicken Marsala and I was not disappointed. It tasted authentic and amazing; there isn't anything bad I can say! We also tried chicken Alfredo, seafood risotto, and a pizza.
They have a lot of pastry's and desserts that I didn't get to try but they looked very good.

5913617,2017-02-23,2,dPxZI9lrKTl5dvFfnb1_Ig,"If you woke up here you would swear you were in Italy! A nice family run trattoria where everyone speaks Italian and makes you feel at home, very authentic. 

We were greeted by the owners daughter, and served by her husband and brother. Bread rolls and water were brought while we looked at the menu. They also have several wines from Italy and Sicily by the glass which is nice. 

We started with the pasta e fagioli soup which was delicious. A large bowl filled with cannellini beans, pasta and chunks of pancetta. A 5 star soup! 

For our entrees we ordered the eggplant parmesan and the gnocchi with pesto and gorgonzola which is made in house. The waiter asked if we wanted a salad and I asked if they had a SMALL side salad. He said yes. A few minutes later a HUGE salad was brought out that could have easily fed 4 people. It was loaded with roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, buffalo mozzarella, olives, tomato and red onion. Although it was very good, I was a little upset I was brought a $9 dinner salad when I asked for a small side salad. A misunderstanding? I hope so. 

The entrees came out and both were very large portions. You definitely get your moneys worth here, as well as leftovers for lunch the next day :)  The eggplant parm was big and covered in cheese. Served with a  side of spaghetti there was plenty to take home. The gnocchi were also very good, melted in my mouth. The sauce was very heavy and very rich, I could barely finish half of it.
