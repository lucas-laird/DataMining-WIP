165092,2015-06-11,0,NoA6bD6W7z_Aztk_cOU5cg,"I have to agree with everyone else who has had issues with this particular Cheesecake Factory. I'm a huge fan of the chain and was excited when a location opened close to my work downtown. At this point, though, I can say my co-workers and I will probably never return to this one again.

We were a party of 8 and arrived early, so we beat the entire lunch crowd in terms of getting seated and getting our orders in. When we ordered, I asked the waitress for bread and butter. 10 minutes later, we were all sitting around, still waiting for our bread and butter.

45 minutes after we had ordered, our food was still nowhere to be seen. When the food did begin to come out, it came in waves. Eventually, all but one of us had gotten our food. This was bizzarre because three people at the table had ordered salmon. Two got their salmon, the third was left waiting. It was a solid 7 minutes that we all sat around staring at our food as it grew cold while we waited for the final person to get her meal so we could all start eating. 

The manager did come and appologize for this, and gave her a comped dessert, so that was nice. Another person's salmon ended up being completely burned on the bottom, so that had to go back and the manager her a comped dessert as well. 

We were there for a celebreation, so when it came time to order dessert, several of us ordered cheesecake. I ordered a slice of the Banana Creme Cheesecake. They brought our cheesecakes, and I took one bite of mine and it was FROZEN. At that point, I was so over it I didn't even want to mention it to the waitress, but the rest of my party was fed up and told her as soon as she came over again. She made a face and informed us that the Cheesecakes are all freshly made.

I poked the cheesecake with my fork to demonstrate and it made the classic ""crunch"" sound of a frozen cake, so she took away my cheesecake and was gone for another 10 minutes (this was the trend of the whole meal). When she returned, she asked if I'd like to have strawberry cheesecake instead. I said no thank you, can I please just have another slice of the banana creme? She then informed me that the banana creme was all frozen. So I ended up with no cheesecake.

And all would have been well if that had been the end of it. I'd have left sad and disappointed, but not angry. No, the anger came when I got the bill and saw that my frozen, inedible, cheesecake that I had been forced to cancel was charged on the bill, and then marked as a ""comp."" Being forced to take back food because it is frozen is not a ""comp, "" that is bad customer service. It is insulting to your customers when you mark food as a ""comp"" when in fact they received nothing. I had one bite of frozen cake and was forced to send it back. You have not done me any favors by not charging me for that cake. That cake should never have been given to me in the first place. 

Overall, the main dishes we did receive were the usual yummy quality of Cheesecake Factory. But getting our bread took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our desserts took forever, and getting our bill took forever. There is a serious managment issue going on with this location that needs to be fixed ASAP.",I3XJNDCe50zG7ddKDCDqAA,5,0,2,4ZfCDOXDkXecs0ZGKlKHcw

And being Vegas locals why not go to the new one so that we can shop at the outlets right after. Lets start off by saying I'm 9 months pregnant so waiting for food for too long is not my best friend. We came in and it took a second to be greeted by the host because she found whatever she was doing to be more important. After she was done she did greet us and we waited to be seated. Our host came and showed us to our seat and said our waiter would be with us shortly. So to kill time we started talking until we noticed it had been 5 min already and no one has acknowledged us yet , but we saw plenty servers walking by. My patience started wearing thin as an additional 10 minz had went by and weren't offered so much as a hello, a drink, NOTHING. so I finally asked a girl if I can speak with the manager and instead of going to get he or she, she replied ""oh I'm your server give me a minute they seated three of y'all at once"". First that's very unprofessional, second don't think that because we're both African american that I'll just be ok with that and let you talk to me the way you feel comfortable, and third if you were so busy its not that hard to COMMUNICATE that with your guests. So of course I took my business elsewhere so thanks a lot for wasting my time that I can never get back and ruining my birthday and I will be sure to yelp you folks as well.

It was taken by a server, never heard an apology or if they were going to make another dish. As well as I didn't even get to explain what happened. Long after the rest of my party ate, a manager (I assume since she wasn't in a uniform) brought out my food and placed it on the table as quickly as she could and left without saying anything. Six out of the seven people at our table needed refills and didn't receive it until we flagged down our server. Then at the end of the meal, the bill came out where they ""comped"" the first ruined entree with a hair in it and charged me for the one they made after. I'm not one to try to get a free meal but with poor service there was no reason to even charge me for something that had a hair in it, no attempt at finding out what happened, I didn't even asked for it to be made again, and no apology. We asked for a manager since nothing was being addressed at all and they just comped it without even coming to the table and again no one apologized.",XtHLD11D1qvqPmUTDGclhA,1,0,1,KcMQXaPHe4XtjkNGggvQPg

By the time the dishes came the buffalo blast were over fried as if the grease was old.  So the server took it back. Within 2 minutes they brought out the same blast that I just sent back. When they finally brought the blast out they looked the same.  If anyone has ever had an order of buffalo blast they are very light with a hint of chicken and a blast sauce inside.  So of course I didn't want them 20 minutes later.  The bun on the bacon burger was hard as if it was stale. The bacon burger had 2 strips of regular bacon and literally 2 small squares of applewood bacon ;(. When the waiter brought out the check he took off the order for the blast but added an order of buffalo wings that no one ordered.  The only thing that was worth the trip was the bread and butter. Of course the check was adjusted but we were really disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory.

468597,2017-07-23,0,NoA6bD6W7z_Aztk_cOU5cg,Been to the Cheesecake Factory on the strip and on Rampart and the food was amazing and service was excellent. Paid $8 to valet just to eat at the Cheesecake Factory at the outlet mall sat at the bar top. I have been gone for a week traveling for work so it was the first time my husband and I got to sat down and catch up with each other and we decided to go here for lunch. Bartender was not friendly seemed to be inconvenienced that we sat down at the bar to eat. The lady who brought our bread was nice but the bread was burned. My husband enjoyed his turkey burger but my shrimp pasta was not good at all the shrimp was very rubbery and overcooked and the asparagus was not very good and limp. Bartender never came back to ask how our food was or I would have politely told him that I did not like my entree which he should have known as I did not finish it. He must have been in a rush to get us out of the bar as he already presented us our bill before we even got our entree in a glass cup in front of us!!! At the end of the meal my water glass was empty and did not even ask to refill it therefore we just paid the check and left. It is very unfortunate for the money I spent on our lunch to not only be satisfied with the food but also the service. Lastly we sat at the end of the bar by the well or the servers pick up the drinks and unfortunately it was surrounded by fruit flies as I kept swatting them away from our area of the bar. Wish I could have gotten our $40 back for this meal.,VmtrxQppfuZLQCi6pduV1Q,1,1,1,aa9v8wiqShUr2BAG5Z-h0w

484585,2016-05-31,1,NoA6bD6W7z_Aztk_cOU5cg,"Food is fine and tastes the same as all other Cheesecake Factory's.  That is not the issue.  The issue I have is the way this location was designed.  The front door is near valet to the mall where only 100 cars can park. The other 10,000 parking spaces are located elsewhere and lead directly into the mall.  But the back door to the Cheesecake factory is closer to the actual mall and much more convenient for people to enter and leave the restaurant.  Half the seating in this location is located in the row going from the check-in to the back door.  And this is the only seating where they allow children.  So as your eating you literally have 100's of people walking back and forth past your table to enter and leave the restaurant.  No one uses the front door since it leads out to the street and the mall is the other direction.  Now add a stroller with a sleeping baby in it.  We usually ask for a table away from others so our child is not a distraction.  We know what it was like before we had a child.  But this place was packed and we had to take the only available table which was a booth.  So we placed the stroller plush against the front of the booth since our child was asleep.  But now with 100s of people coming in and out the back door we closed traffic to one way since the stroller was there.  Now the manager noticed the interruption of bodies moving because of the stroller and was about to ask us to move it down the hall when he realized our son was asleep in it.  So I asked him to make the back door an exit only like most businesses.  And he tried explaining it is a fire hazard which is not true.  it is only a fire hazard if it is locked and you can not get out.  So this meal was certainly not relaxing and not enjoyable.  Trying to make sure people do not run into the stroller and eat at the same time is not fun.  They are more worried about losing customers because they cant actually find the front door to this location than making the people their comfortable.  And if they had told us from the get go their was no place to sit with a stroller we would have gone somewhere else.

Time : Around 7:00-8:30 PM
Company: 4 adults, 1 child

I was excited to eat at Cheesecake Factory since most of my relatives were raving about the food quality and taste these guys offer. The waiting line was long since it's in an outlet mall so I already saw that coming. The receptionist informed me it would take around 40 minutes to get a table and we agreed. 

We sat by the long bench BESIDE the recepionists desk because we didn't want to miss our names. 30 something minutes passed and I asked for an update. They said we were to be called next, just waiting for the table to be emptied, so okay. So far so good. A few minutes after, they called in a party of 5, then a party of 3, and then another party of 6. I was confused because they said we were next. Approached the employee who was informing guests that there were available bar stools for anyone who wants them. Rudely answered and argued with my brother. He was in my brother's face already, so I talked to the receptionists behind the desk. I was so shocked when they said they called us TEN TIMES ALREADY, the other said FOUR TIMES. WOW, talk about inconsistency. Again, we were seated BESIDE THE RECEPTIONISTS DESK. No way we couldn't hear them IF EVER THEY CALLED US. Asked for a manager, but he was impolite and inattentive. Tried explaining our situation and get an apology from him but what he did was straight on unprofessional. He shoved the paper with my name on it to let me know that we were getting a table now. The worst manager ever, or so I thought....

After seating at our table, another manager approached us, hoping for a better response, we tried explaining what happened, never listened, kept cutting our sentences and even had the nerve to tell us not to argue with him. We were explaining, not arguing. Even told us he'd talk to the crew right away, followed him with my eyes, he didn't even say a word to them. So arrogant and ill-mannered. Walked away without even apologizing. 

They should thank the waitress they assigned to us. Made our experience a little tolerable. 

SO I WANNA SAY THANK YOU, CHEESECAKE FACTORY FOR MAKING MY FIRST DINING EXPERIENCE THE WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. Would have given no stars if it was possible.",II6yVjNJcT9rOuirzjVvYA,0,0,1,tsIdAlmXEN_aP-Yp-YB3mQ

I PERSONALLY won't be going back for the simple fact that there were flies above our table. When we expressed it to our server, he ""justified"" the flies as being ""bar flies""... Can you say, still grossed the f**% out? 
Didn't offer to move us or anything.(there were 6 of us)

I understand the fruits and sugars and such attract buggies  but I work in the industry as well and we do not have that issue...( btw there were no flies or gnats by the bar)

We didn't order food and sat at the bar. But then again, once you've eaten at one Cheesecake Factory, you've eaten at them all. 

The lovely bartender took and made our drink orders straight away. We ordered a passion fruit mojito and a Long Island Ice Tea. Total with tip came to be about $25.

The mojito was deliciously served in a tall Pilsner glass. The fresh mint leaves was a refreshing treat. The LIIT was also good, with a heavy pour, but then again it's a LIIT.",d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ,9,9,3,aB1-2VBReynfr8SBiutbxA

We arrived around 12:48 PM and we were led to a table right away. It wasn't extremely busy but most tables were occupied. I ordered a hot cafe mocha, spicy chicken chipotle pasta (lunch special), and a white chocolate raspberry truffle. We were also served with complimentary breadsticks. They were warm and were great to munch on before our meal. 

The cafe mocha was large but nothing too spectacular regarding the flavour. It was a standard mocha. The spicy chicken chipotle pasta smelled delicious when it arrived. I also added some Parmesan cheese on top. The crispy tortilla chips added an extra crunch to the dish and I enjoyed it. The spicy chicken was flavourful, and had a nice kick. There were also pieces of asparagus and green peas to add a little green to the dish. However, I thought the pasta itself were too firm, it would have been better if they were softer. 

I took a long time to decide which cheesecake to get because they just had so many! After much contemplation, I settled for the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. It was a big slice with whipped cream on top and on the side. It was truly delightful, it wasn't too sweet which I liked. At first I was worried that it would be too sweet but not at all. The cheesecake itself was smooth and creamy, with a great balance between the white chocolate and raspberry. I cannot wait to try their other cheesecake next time I'm in the States.

Service was great, the server dropped by to check up on us and made sure everything was good. Food arrived in a timely manner. I asked for a to-go cup for my mocha and I received one promptly.

We shared the Caesar salad and the firecracker salmon. The firecracker salmon is in a crisp wrapper that is very light and the salmon is soft and cooked well.  The Caesar salad is always good at Cheesecake Factory. Perfect blend of Parmesan and dressing.

1694622,2017-08-01,6,NoA6bD6W7z_Aztk_cOU5cg,"Here's a simple transaction gone stupidly wrong.

A man walks into a Cheesecake Factory 30-minutes to close. The place is less than half full, so it's not busy by any measure. All this man wants is to order two slices and to go home. He stands in front of the display case, as one does, waiting to ask a question and to then place an order. 

And he keeps standing there. 

There's one busy bee who's pulling all the weight filling orders as the dupes roll in. She's far too preoccupied, that is clear. Then there's the other, standing at the register, pretending to be busy. She looks at me on occasion, we make eye contact, and it's clear, I need help, and she's not busy, nor is she coming over. Maybe it's not her job? Maybe she's been scolded for leaving her register? I don't know. It's not my job to know.

I wait a few more minutes watching the hustle. One manager comes in and gives the busy bee an understanding kiss on the head. Odd. Neither here nor there, though. I eventually walk over to the one whose feet are stuck at the register. She asks if I need anything. Incredulous, I say yes, and a question, but is there a reason you didn't come over when you saw me standing there forever? 

""I was busy.""

No. No you weren't. And your muscles could have transported you over three feet to meet a customer. Anyway, I place my order, and there's not an ounce of hospitality in her voice or actions. No civility. Cold dismissiveness. I thank her for taking my money, but she continues to stand there. My cheesecake? No. She eyeballs the guy standing beside me, then back at me. Am I supposed to interpret this eyeballing? She then snarks at me to move, that, ""I need to take his order.""  
""THAT's interesting,"" I say. She has to take *his* before completing mine, after I've been standing there for ten minutes already. And how does that rule work if the line is more than two customers deep? 
Have I wronged this woman somehow, in a past life perhaps? Just unreal. It's like she was stickin' it to me. For what? For being a customer? 

While waiting for the next guy to place an infinitely long order before receiving mine, I see another manager come by. I tell HIM what just happened. He apologizes, which is nice, and he collects my cheesecake and hands it to me. Apologizes again. All that's well and good...but what are you going to do about that staffer (Sharonte, the receipt claims)? Let her look at me smugly as I leave, which she did, and let bygones be bygones? 

Bad service is bad service, happens from time to time. But this felt weirdly personal, and as if no one cared whatsoever. Looking at other negative reviews, there's an obvious pattern here, as well as the textbook response from Management. Maybe try fixing your service issues instead of endlessly apologizing for them? 
This Cheesecake is less than a mile from my house, but there's no way I'll ever return, not with that welcoming and sendoff as if I'd been punished for some unknown transgression.

First I'm a Vegas local. I normally eat at the summerlin location with wife and three kids, at least once a week. Never ever had any kind of problem.
 But on this occasion, I had friends in town visiting. We spent the day shopping at the down town outlet mall. Laughing, smiling, and just enjoying what started out to be such a great day. it till we went in to the cheesecake factory downtown. Once we walked in my Wife put our names down. It did take some time before we had gotten sat. There were six of us. An hour we waited. everyone was getting a little Hangry. My Wife approached the hostess and asked if were to be seated soon. The young lady said we were looking for you. She asked if we had left. Uh, NO we were sitting right next to your podium. Well another young lady came right over and call our name and sat us. 
To speed up  my story, The Sever was great. bread came to the table. We placed our drink order. And i order my go to dish Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Oh how i love this. Well when all the food came. I tasted my dish. AND BOOM  it tasted as the chicken was spoiled. I called the sever over and asked if she could smell it. She looked at the dish a said she was going to get her Manager. I replied there no need for that. Just bring my another. 
A few minutes later a Gentleman approached our table and identify him self as the GM Danny. I assumed he was going to speak to me about my Favorite dish, My Go to. But no. Danny emphasized in a very strong tone that he didn't appreciate on how my wife had spoken to the hostess. And if there is a problem with the food. Go some where else.

Lastly we had the Banana Cheesecake and that was even better, for us next time we order we might order ours with whip cream on the side, we thought it was a bit too much.

It was a little confusing because the entrance that's located in the shopping area of the outlets mall is at the back of the restaurant so you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the hostess stand. Honestly I never liked that because its weird. Anyways, just an opinion..so as we got to the hostess only for us to tell us its going to be 15-20 min. Odd to us because since we walked through the restaurant we saw it was completely empty so 15-20 min? Ok...

We were sat after about 10 min and we were greeted by one server who said she would give us a few minutes after taking out drink order.  A couple minutes later another server comes up and greets us and asks if we would like some bread, we say sure. The first server comes back with our drinks and starts to take our order. The second server comes back with our bread, sees the server taking our order, says to her she can do it and then......they proceed to argue about who's table it is. Uhhhh??? So needless to say that was interesting. 

So moving on we place our oder, get our food and the food was pretty good. I had the ahi tuna salad which was extremely tasty and very fresh. We also ordered a burger which was huge! The food saved this experience for us.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,3,3,3,IEAE9JZdwg4vaLdrKtFqnQ

The beet and goat cheese salad. Beets were over cooked and smushy. I've never had smushy beets. They were also too salty. Too few pieces of pecans and goat cheese. The dressing had too much vinegar and too little oil. I ordered the steak medallion instead of the steak Diane off the skinnylicious menu. The serving was too small and again too too much salt. I was done after two bites. I tried my daughters buffalo chicken appetizer. Again too salty. She had a side of the buffalo sauce. Guess what too salty.

My wife and I split a chicken piccata with angel hair pasta.   The dinner portion was enough to feed us both.  The lemony sauce mixed with the capers brought a nice zest to the buttery noodles and the tender chicken  provided our delicious protein requirements.  This is our go-to dish for Italian and it's done pretty well here.

The side of little crab cake bites and ahi tuna tartare we also ordered were fairly good as well.  As was the marinara bow-tie pasta my daughter ordered.

Dessert was great.  One giant Fresh Strawberry cheesecake to feed two adults and two small kids.  

Service was fairly prompt, only slow once when awaiting for our check.   Prices were reasonable and by far this is one of the better options for dinner around the outlet mall.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,3,1,4,BhoVdkxnRg3Fas1LpTRoAg

It is located out on the fashion outlet shops off the 15 freeway, North, Charleston B. It is a high end restaurant that serves great quality food with excellent service, expect to be thrilled if you have never been here.

 Outside, there are plenty of surrounding shops for people to shop for clothes, accessories and other various products. The location is located near a corner street. You cant miss it.

 Inside, it is noisy during peak hours at about 3-6pm on a weekend. There are bathrooms located in the back and no free wifi. The decoration is like any other cheesecake factory: a yellow tinted wall with various ceiling lights. There is a cheesecake bar for people to order cheesecake at the entrance. There is a bar for alcoholic drinks as well. There are many booths and regular tables/chairs scattered all over. I have been here in the afternoon and at night. It is the same noisy environment.

 Service: very good. Me and my family member were seated in less than 3 minutes. Our server was great, fast and efficient. He had a good personality and gave us our drinks before 3 minutes. Our meal came in about 10-15 minutes with a busy crowd. The bread they give you for convenience is warm. There are two types: sourdough and a whole grain bread. 

 The prices: pretty moderate. Most of the entrees on the menu are above $10 and can go up to around $50 for their more expensive specialty items. I personally enjoyed the chicken madeira. It is their most popular chicken dish. However, I order other items on their skinnylicious menu. It is worth a look if you are wanting to cut pounds. 

 Overall, it is a good experience. The food is worth what you pay for. The environment can be noisy, service is on point and the cheesecake selections are outstanding. Great for dates, family gatherings and hangouts with friends, but don't expect anything to be on the cheap end.",o1QAhT9-HOVzyso46he00w,35,25,4,xtnBzwTzyg2YzZmAyYBNvQ

I told him that I would need some ketchup to put on my hamburger and at least 15 minutes passed until he came back with the ketchup and at which time he said... I'll get those sweet potato fries ordered for you. I told him to forget it as it was too late. We were already done eating and were ready to leave. I asked him for a to go container for my daughter's barely uneaten entree and again 10 minutes later I had to ask a busboy to bring one over.

Every time I call, the ladies on the other line are friendly. At the pick-up counter with all the chaos of other orders, the cashiers are fast and friendly. I haven't had any of my orders screwed up, so kudos to them, especially with my lunch being timed.

As for the food, everyone knows their menu is vast. If you're eating healthy or don't give a crap about heart disease, they have something for everyone. They can even alter some items to be gluten free. Portions are huge, so you can always split your meal into 2 servings. And of course, who can forget their infamous delicious cheesecakes? Oreo, lemon merengue, vanilla bean, plain, etc. The list goes on for about a page and a half on the menu. Hence, where the self-control comes into play.

Anyways the mashed potatoes were good but I wanted gravy. The Herb Crusted Salmon was alright. I didn't really like the crust, a bit too bitter for my taste. The breaded shrimp was good and the cream sauce was fine. I really hated the sauce that came underneath my salmon and asparagus, I'm so very glad that they put the asparagus between my salmon and the sauce so that it wasn't already touching and I was able to save it. I love asparagus and mine were ruined. :(

My boyfriend ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger, it was fine. He asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it was quite well done. 

We ordered Chicken Samosas for our appetizer and I thought the cilantro dipping sauce was quite wonderful. I thought the samosas were pretty good.

The complimentary wheat bread!! Omg. It was soooo amazing. It was so warm, nice and toasty... it melted in my mouth, no butter neeeded. It was sweet and just so so amazing.

Then he came back and offered to get us some drinks and such. Honestly, he's not your typical server, but it's what made us like him so much. He's not super bubbly and chatty and fake like half of the servers you get. He seems very genuine and thats what made us like him so much. Definitely will be back.

This was literally my first bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory EVER! Normally me and my fiancé come and have a great experience, great food, and overall great service. This time we didn't get to experience any of that. 

This was our first time at this particular location. But since we come here so often, we already know what we want to eat. And this time we were on a slight time crunch, wanted to be in and out in an hour. We got sat on the patio, on a Wednesday afternoon. It was a pretty slow section. There were only 3 or 4 tables. So when the server first greeted us, we immediately ordered our food when we ordered our drinks. That was at 2:30, so 15 minutes goes by and our server accidentally takes a fall and hurts herself, breaking glasses and such. She went to the back to get iced up I believe. With all the servers they had all day, you'd think they'd get someone to cover her section. But all we really got was a walk by from a manager asking if we were ok. 35 minutes goes by. And we still don't have our food. Our waitress was back out on the floor. 

At that point I just wanted to walk out, but we did order drinks and still had to pay for them. And my fiancé was starving, so we asked to get our food Togo. 45 minutes later, we get our food Togo. I asked to get our delicious strawberry lemonade Togo, and they gave us a tiny kids cup filled with ice to go with our meal.

As we walked out, I told the manager that stopped by our table earlier that our service was terrible, and all he had to say was that he was unaware of it. We understand our server did get hurt but that doesn't make up for the terrible service. Especially since there's 20+ servers working on the floor at the time. We don't eat at Cheesecake to eat takeout, we choose to eat at Cheesecake for the experience, and this Cheesecake Factory restaurant completely failed us.",VDsnV9Xc-akVbJC0hVtAQw,0,0,5,SeAIt5arDF4-YOVcQISEHw

My friend and I were walking around the outlet and got hungry in the middle of our shopping trip so we decided to head over to the Cheesecake Factory for a quick lunch.  We showed up around 1:30 PM for lunch and were seated within 5 minutes.  

I felt really terrible because we were walking for quite a while before my friend told me that she was starving.  I'm such a bad friend!

Our waitress came to greet us and brought us some iced water.  We ordered an appetizer and one item each and decided to share everything.

I wanted to try the truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks as our appetizer, and I am so glad that it turned out to be really good or else I would've been really disappointed since my friend told me to choose.

She ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and asked if she could have a side of salad, but I told her that I was going to order the factory chopped salad and she could just share some of mine.  Good thing we decided to share everything because their portions are no joke.  We enjoyed everything we ordered.

Service was pleasant and our food arrived in a timely manner.  Our only complaint was that the air conditioner was probably set to 40 degrees or something since it was 90+ degrees out and the temperature difference was so drastic that it made it hard to enjoy the environment.",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,13,16,4,rGlg9LeAUHl2xbQrNnKA-w

Food was good, everyone order something different. 
I had their combination plate with my favorite thing ever, herb crusted salmon. Came with a creamy lemon sauce, asparagus and mashed potatoes. For the second thing I got their steak diane.

We had some buffalo chicken strips that were really good. 
And my boyfriend had their jambalaya with shrimp, sausage and not sure what else but it was tasty. Packed with a lot of flavor. Only downfall was that they had ran out of white rice, so they gave him brown rice. 
For dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake....eh I do not like red velvet so I am not even going to review this dessert. All I can say is, it was a huge slice.

No doubt I pulled up the menu online and say a few things that I'd be interested in. Now like any other happy hour menu the options to choose from are minimal however they do offer some great ones! I have to highlight that not only do they offer Long Island Ice Tea's but in TALL glasses! For only $5 I believe! What a steal! I was determined to try every drink but they would've had to wheel my out of there! I was able to also try the margarita and although it wasn't as strong as the Long Island it was still acceptable! Crab Spinach dip is a MUST! Even though the happy hour is only from 4-6PM I would still encourage everybody to check it out! This was my first time to this location and I was impressed! Not just by the food, but the customer service was excellent as well! I wish I could remember the waitress's name, she was a doll! I'll be back for SURE!",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,4,2,4,gQuVF89A7RGernjzt-RUtQ

This was actually my first time at this location but I kind of knew that the food was going to be great because I used to be a regular in the location in Hawaii. 
What I've never had before was the Korean fried cauliflower.. are you kidding me?! That dish was amazing! The cauliflower itself was not over or under cooked, and the flavor is not over powering like how some places make it.. it was so pleasant to eat.... I ordered another one -_-...dont judge me-
Their veggie burgers have always been pretty good in my opinion for as long as I have been eating them.

From entering in the restaurant and being greeted, you will feel like you're welcomed properly.

The decor is inviting and the staff seems like they're enjoying what they do.

Our party 5 were seated and not too long our drinks were ordered. 

Not much of a wait as we sat, chatted, and perused the menu, did our drinks arrive.

Appetizers were ordered and it was time for a clink of our raised glasses & cheers!

From the delivery of our appetizers and ordering entrees, everything was timely and it was easy for our group to enjoy our time there.

We ate so much that we were sorry we didn't have time for dessert! 

Maybe next time!

Thanks you Cheesecake Cake Factory for an awesome lunch!

Her name is Ashley.  I am 64 years old and have traveled the world.  Her whole persona was just amazing.  I have never had a server with such class and immediate attention to service like Ashley.  You needed something she had it there before you even called her.  Just incredible .  Always smiling.  Never pressuring.  She made our eating experience one of a kind.

The Cheesecake Factory has a large selection of items on the menu, as well as a large selection of cheesecakes to choose from for dessert.

My personal favorite is the Hibachi Steak and I have many favorites for cheesecake, especially the Oreo cheesecake.

The restaurant was fairly busy even in the middle of the afternoon, but I was seated immediately (easy when you are a party of one). The interior was semi-upscale and clean, like most Cheesecake Factory locations.

I originally was greeted by a female waitress who said she would be right with me, but then I ended up being waited on by a young male waiter instead. He was very friendly, but it was clear that he was very new and probably in training. For some reason, he removed my set of utensils and napkins, so I had to ask for a new knife to spread butter when my bread basket came. The bread was fairly tasty: warm and two varieties.

I ended up ordering the eggroll sampler as well as the avocado toast. Both dishes were good, though the avocado spread on the toast was a bit tart. I was actually pretty stuffed after finishing both dishes, so had to take my strawberry cheesecake slice to-go to eat later.

My water was inconsistently refilled, and it took A LONG time for my check to come, and even longer for the bill to come back after I gave my credit card and gift card/coupon. 

Though the service during this meal was a bit below average, the food was still decent and I would consider this a solid Cheescake Factory.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,1,1,4,jEAmG1NNz_Qp_KufJiDEZA

If you read the rest of the reviews here, lots of people have issues regarding service. I get that this is a new location and it takes time to work out the kinks, but people just gotta take a chill pill!!!

Our first visit, we split the Chicken Chilaquiles and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, both were excellent,and the food came out in a timely matter. Our server couldn't answer a few questions about a few of the menu items we had, but no big deal..everything else was good.

This recent visit over EDC weekend, once again, we went for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and this time we ordered the Chorizo Chicken Hash with Poached Eggs.
We noticed however that our waitress seemed preoccupied and didn't seem happy. We had a few questions about things and  got short answers. We knew something was up. Now at this point, people  would dock a star or two regarding service,  but upon returning, Wifey asked politely ""Having a rough day?""

Our waitress stepped back with a big sigh and apologized explaining the start of her day with a huge  power outage, EDC traffic, getting the kids ready, and getting ready for work all at the same time, so finding this out, we kinda sympathized with her and assured her that the worst part of her day was over, and whaddayouknow? Her demeanor did a 180...some people just need some positive reinforcement ya know?  Drinks were refilled, checked up on us periodically, and even the manager came by and was apologetic when she saw our food hadn't arrived yet!? We didn't feel  like it was a long wait, probably because I was engaged in conversation with my hot date across me...; )

When our food did arrive, the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were bomb as always, and The Chorizo Chicken Hash was perfection. From the perfectly oozing poached egg (lots of places have a hard time doing this) to the extra crispy hash I requested, no complaints here! Call me loco, but I prefer the  Cheesecake Factory over some of the other breakfast /brunch spots in town! ALOHA!!!

Well, this location is in the Vegas Premium outlet center and after losing my mind in Michael Kors and other stores, it was time to eat and get out before I had to get a 2nd mortgage on my house to support my shopping habit.  

Anyhoo - the atmosphere is nice, decor is great - the low marks I give this are for the 1) service and 2) regular food.  I have been to the sister spot, Grand Lux and GL seems to be better to me.  As far as service, our waiter was SLOW and had attitude.  It took forever to just get water, he forgot to bring bread to our table and when I told him one of the things I wanted was for to-go he got snippy with a 'you should have said that first' - UM, excuse me?  Anyway, the salad I ordered to eat there was over chopped - that may be weird to say but I like to see whole leaves in my salad - this one was over chopped like shredded lettuce in the store.  But it tasted good.  My friend ordered these buffalo chicken tenders that for some reason had the buffalo sauce on the inside - nah - I gotta skip that in the future, that's just not right to do to chicken. 

BUT - the Turkey burger is BAE!!!  That tasty somenother gave me LIFE!!!!!  The caramelized onions on it are the thing dreams and rainbows are made of...... mind you I ate this later on in the day in my hotel room after several rounds of drinks but trust me, my taste buds know good burgers even if they are reheated. 

There is location near my house and I intend on stopping in to grab some cheesecake (the one thing I did NOT do on this visit) - so we'll see if I feel better about them then.  Otherwise, pass for me, I'll Grand Lux it out.",1ZG-6QjiapNXAK2sIKLMEQ,1,1,2,AUXNmFQ6h7L2oETVNZDe8g

Parking wasn't too bad. We parked in the Parking Garage B right off Bonneville. Took us maybe 5-8 minutes to find parking and we walked across the street from the parking garage to the restaurant. The restaurant has valet too so if you prefer not to deal with the parking, I highly advise. The front entrance to the restaurant is off of the street side across from the garage. You can also enter from another door that is deeper inside the mall, but then you have to walk through the dining room to get to the hostess area at the front. 

For appetizers, the family and I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese balls (delicious) and an assortment of varied spring rolls which were also very good. 
 
I ordered Evelyn's Famous Pasta. As to be expected, the portion size was huge! Everything in the dish tasted fresh and not overly cooked. The broccoli had a bit of crispness left to it and the mushrooms weren't soggy! It was very good. 

Hubby had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and even he said he was surprised how great it was!

I didn't have high expectations for my return, but what can I say, it's the mediocre yet deliciously free bread that keeps me coming back. 

I brought a friend to share a plate with me. She had her doubts about sharing since she was starving, but I know my way around a Cheesecake Factory. We ordered the chicken costoletta and swapped out the side of veggies with a side of mac and cheese. If you haven't tried the mac and cheese at CF, do so immediately, it might restore your faith in them. The serving size was huge, of course, and we were unbutton-the-pants full. It was awesome. I had plans to buy a cheesecake slice, but we were meeting up with our friends and I didn't want any vultures stealing my cheesecake, you know how it is.

About 10 minutes after ordering all of our food a gentleman came up to us and informed us that there was no more prime rib. Our waitress Bree soon followed after. She was unaware that there was no more prime rib. The gentleman proceeded asked my husband what other selection he would like. He hovered over him until he made a decision. At no point did the gentleman or our waitress apologize for the inconvenience. Our food was brought out at different times. Upon receiving the order that my husband chose it was quite Untasty and  had no flavor. Our waitress didn't bother to ask us how we liked their food nor did her or management do anything about the inconvenience. Although my food was brought to me hot and tastes well the lack of customer service and poor communication between the kitchen staff and waitstaff has caused this negative review.

However, from the first five minutes here i found the most courteous and sincere employee here was SKYLER,  the front of house manager. He is attentive, and provides excellent service with a smile and great attitude. He goes above and beyond to ensure that your experience is of the highest caliber and provides way more service than some of the most high end restaurants. Overall the atmosphere was a pleasure and it was mostly so because of his service. I definitely recommend this particular cheesecake to any one that appreciates good service!",zy8qy6FgOFJO_43Rw8GMuA,0,0,5,FCw5Ig1Ro1NtcAnN3l10eA

Well from the moment we sat down to the moment we left (almost running out the door) we had the most disappointing experience. John M. was our server and came to take our drink order first,  everyone else ordered soft drinks and i ordered a apple cider,  5 minutes later drinks arrived except mine, was told it was coming next,  10 more mins passed was asked if anyone had brought my cider yet and was again told ""right away"" another 5 mins passed before i received my drink only to receive a glass half the size as everyone else's and with no ice at all, (room temperature apple juice). Finally we all put in our orders, 3 of us ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with a mix of chicken and shrimp , after waiting 45 mins we were served. The pasta was already starting to harden, the chicken had no flavor, the shrimp was chewy and the Alfredo sauce was watery, as if the pasta was not strained all the way. At the end 5 of us were very disappointed with our meal and our server noticing our not too pleased faces decided to ask the manager if he could comp 2 desserts. Dessert was the only thumbs up we gave for the night, but even dessert couldn't stop us from wanting to run out of there!

The food was low quality and I especially remember how disgusting the restrooms were!

Tonight we were pleasantly surprised!  I ordered the Tuscany chicken, it was hot and flavorful.  My boyfriend's chicken Madero was just how he ordered and he ate all of it.  When I went to the restroom, there was someone cleaning it and filling the TP!  Our server had a large party in our section due to a bday, but she handled it like a pro and was super attentive.

From quality to quantity, it was all enjoyable.  The salad, while a good Ceasar, was nothing special.  Just a salad done right.  The soup was crazy good.  I love mushrooms and mushroom soup. This was an interesting varient that was a littl less creamy than I am used to but loaded with mushrooms, carrots and some other bits of deliciousness.  The sandwich was abotu as good as the soup.

It was very good and I would gladly order it again.  My one regret is not ordering a piece of cheesecake.  I love cheesecake and I was at the Cheesecake Factory.

So on to the review:

I really like this new location at the premium outlets, $6 for valet parking (so worth it).  Just like other CF locations there was a wait to be seated in the restaurant area BUT the bar area is open availability.  

The lunchtime options is more than enough food for a lunch portion.  I ordered SHEILA'S GRILLED CHICKEN & AVOCADO salad.  This lunch portion can be split in two, salad is tossed with a citrus honey vinaigrette.  Piled high are mixed greens, grilled chicken, cashews, shredded carrots, red onion, crunchy tortilla strips, cilantro and of course AVOCADO!  No need to search for the chicken, every stab of the fork you come up with piece of chicken.  Remember, this is ONLY the lunch portion, the dinner size might feed an entire table of 4, ijs.  The salad was DRESSED not soggy, still had crisp to the lettuce and crunch to the cashews.

for dessert:
SALTED CARAMEL CHEESECAKE
Um, yea...I kind of was disappointed with this selection, for me personally the graham cracker crust was too thick, the base was basic, what made it salted caramel was that a layer of caramel sits atop of the cheesecake.  Yea, that's all I have to say about that

Of course the cheesecake does not effect the star rating, I will just try a different cheesecake, they have over 20 different flavors.  But this is just my opinion , go try it out you might go giddy over the salted caramel cheesecake.",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,1,0,4,-_-KGEZCn_W3eGR8YgrrdQ

We also choose the Parmesan Garlic Cheese bread. The bread was served warm with lots of gooey cheese in the middle on the side was a small bowl of garlic oil dipping sauce. 
For our entrees we choose grilled Salmon and Spicy Louisiana chicken pasta. The salmon was grilled to a flaky perfection. It was served with mash and fresh veggies.  The pasta was almost al dente, which is not to me liking, but it was spiced and sauced just the way I prefer.

So, we came here on saturday for lunch, way before the crowd; since we got a tip from one of the ladies here to get in here before 12:15 pm as we were checking out the menu posted outside. 

We had the complimentary bread basket  with butter (french baguette slices and pumpernickel slices) and our little man had one too, which also included sliced bananas. I had a bunch of questions about the menu, since it'd been a while. I opted for the lunch size asian salad, while hubby had his favorite item, the cuban sandwich, and our little man had the mini corndogs and fries. It was delicious. I couldn't finish my salad, which was pretty big, even for the lunch size, but I'm glad I asked about the size of the salad. We also got dessert, once I mentioned the crazy one, hubby wanted that one. It was really good, too. I just was stuffed. (We had leftovers.) We still had a balance on one of the gift cards. They are treated as credit cards, so you still have to sign them. 

The service was excellent- our server was pretty attentive (drink refills, and checking on us from time to time). And the other servers were nice and smiling, as they passed us, too. It's refreshing to see people in customer service who want to be there, who enjoy their jobs.   

Inside, the decor (barqoue/neo-classical- elegant), was very in line with their other restaurants (been to Forum/Summerlin/Green Valley). We had to switch seats (booth & tables seating is available) as the TV had hubby's game that he was DVR'ing. Our stoller was stored with the rest, elsewhere. The lady gave us a claim ticket. 

Bathrooms were near the entrance. There were mens, womens, and a family one. I went into the womens and there were two stalls, one was handicapped. I went into the smaller one so I don't know if there was a baby changing station in the handicapped stall. 

The food court at this Premium Outlets is really lacking (Ok, who am I kidding, it sucks!), so this restaurant is going to be very busy and popular (the huge menu and the huge selection of cheesecake flavors). Hubby mentioned that this could be one of our special occasion restaurants. Our first date was at the one at Forum Shops (back in 2004). So, yes, we will be back.

My boyfriend and I went after a lovely show at the Smith Center and it let out about 10pm. We wanted to go eat somewhere nice and conveniently close. As we love our Cheesecake Factory at Green Valley Ranch, we decided to try this location based on our great experiences with the other locations.

Great factor was that it was open till 12am but downside is that even though there were not so many people on a Friday night, the service was very slow. We usually get our favorites, Avocado Spring Rolls, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Rib Eye Steak. 

The Spring rolls were delicious as is the sauce which is easily devoured! But the Bistro Shrimp pasta was really spicy! Now this is supposed to be a general garlic and wine sauce with no spicyiness at all. It had way too much red chili peppers! My mouth was on fire! 

The steak was burned but my boyfriend ate it anyways since he was hungry.

When the server asked about the meals I let him know of the issues but all we got was a 'Sorry' (It wasn't his fault for the food though) and only 5% off the bill.

If you want the traditional Cheesecake Factory yumminess, don't go to this location as it lacks the quality and taste.",BqRH_nZYEgjMK73Sq_Konw,2,0,2,67AJxZVfpOrciLTbu2bItg

Asked for no onions..... onions on EVERYTHING.

My drink had to be reordered 3 times..... and it was 2 shots of silver tequila on ice.....takes a genius. I could go on....I'm annoyed by having to relive it....

I went in with 8 of my closest friends because it was my birthday dinner on a Saturday night of course I was expecting it to be busy since that's how it usually is on Saturday nights in any restaurant. We went in and ordered a table for 8 took about 20-25 minutes. We sat down ordered what we wanted with drinks . Took them 25 minutes to bring out the drinks. They had already brought out the bread. Didn't even offer water while we were waiting. I had ordered extra sauce with my pasta. So they brought the pasta but no sauce. They came by once to say it's coming out but it took them 30-45 mins to bring it out by that time I was done with my dry pasta. No longer needed it. The worst part is that my friends had ordered a tirumasu cake as a surprised and the manager came up and told the whole table we are just waiting on the dessert... Really!!!!!! Just ruin the surprise. Very unsatisfied with the service here!!! Never returning I rather go to Summerline or Henderson Cheesecake Factory!!!,VXu1gQ-3BbU1PYnkB5PVmw,1,0,1,apMMNgKTxYJDRr07BrWHCA

She then proceeded to give me my lemonade I ordered while I waited another 30 minutes (total of 1 hour wait since I ordered) for my food to arrive.

This was my first visiting this location of The Cheesecake Factory.  We checked in at the front desk and the lady said the wait time will be 5-10 mins and got seated at 8 mins. Kinda nice knowing we were seated within the allotted time because we know TCF gets extremely busy.

We started off with  ""Warm Crab And Artichoke Dip"" due to ""Fire Roasted Fresh Artichoke"" not being available which is kinda disappointing, we really wanted to try it and ""Stuffed Mushrooms"" which is really good, kinda sad they only serve a small portion of it because it's my favorite. 

For entree, our party ordered the ""Pasta Da Vinci"" ""Fresh Grilled Salmon"" ""Herb Crusted Fillet Of Salmon"". What I like about TCF over the larger restaurant chains the food never lets you down. The food portions are always large to share with others. 

Leave some room for desserts though. As we didn't so we ordered for takeout. No matter what you are craving when it comes to cheesecakes you will not go wrong. I recommend the red velvet and the salted caramel. Oh boy what a surprise because I thought nothing could top the Red Velvet.

The customer service was super slow, our server hardly dropped by to fill up our water. But I sorta understand seeing how busy the place was. So we didn't think too much of it.",ULLBZkybKlh6Lp4Q6B_iHQ,0,0,4,8GK6Qll0WLcNcLF8i_05TA

(The only bad thing about them is that it's just too much cake, cause let's face it - nobody needs 900 calories worth of cheesecake.) ;) We ate about half of it, and our server put the rest in boxes for us so we could bring it home. 

All in all we had a really good birthday celebration, and looooved those cheesecakes!",RUcY7rt4EV-dbnVK627Mvw,2,1,5,7yAo2cjP7NDNtf26x-whYA

The menu is huge, so it took us a few minutes. And it doesn't have photos anymore so I was looking on my phone to get a better idea of what I was going to eat.

I ordered a lunch portion of the chicken, mango and avocado salad without wonton and skinny pomegranate dressing on the side. JD ordered the sandwich, soup and salad lunch combo.

My salad arrived and looked so sad. The chicken beast it's self was flat. It wasn't plump and juicy. It looked like it had been sitting in a freezer with a 100 lb weight on it. See photos. There was hardly any avocado- maybe 1/4 of one. No almonds to be found. The fruit was definitely not fresh. I was able to squish it so easily with a fork. It had been sitting in a can. You can always tell the difference between fresh, frozen and canned fruit. Nice try with trying to pull a fast one though.

When we told our server what was wrong, she made me feel that this was somehow my fault- as did the manager. I'm sorry I didn't want crispy wontons on my salad and that I subbed dressings. It felt like that was what started this whole issue. 

They comped the salad, we canceled the cheesecake slice we were going to share at the end of our meal because giving them more money after the way we were treated simply wasn't an option. 

It's unfortunate that this is the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in about 6 years and that it went so poorly. Definitely reminds me why I generally stray away from chains like this. Maybe the one at Caesars is still better....",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,1,0,1,rgpqaE9iMaTnG1ZAaNd3Gw

I went over there on my lunch to pick it up and there was nothing. No sign of my order being there. I couldn't have called the wrong location because it's the only phone number we have of them and we call it all the time. The staff and managers seem to be clueless and not even the slightest apologetic of my inconvenience.

Very warm welcoming... Being the chatty gal that I am, our server informed me that it had only been open for a week so I decided to give them a hall pass. We had 2 servers for a party of 11... is that really necessary? 

Getting our drinks took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our separate checks took an eternity. What was supposed to be a quick work lunch break turned into a 2 hour meal. 3 of us ordered the same appetizer, mine came out first, then 10 mines later the second one came out with a noticeable smaller portion. I immediately notified I server (My side of the table had the competent server) and he directed the manager to come see us. The manager said he would give us another order gratis. When all the entrees came out, the 3rd appetizer came out. By the end they tried charging us for 4 appetizers. It was really just one thing after the other. And I get it, it was their first week open but it seemed like their staff had no industry experience. By the time we were heading out it was packed.

My wife changes her mind on one of the slices and we politely ask if we can change it before she even sliced a cheesecake. Already the employees bad attitude began. She gave a rude look like she didn't want to do it but did anyway. I bit my tongue and shrugged it off and said thank you when we got our 2 slices for take out. We walk around the outlet mall and notice one of the slices was a lot bigger than the other.  I had always thought cheesecake slices were huge and equal portions, I guess not. My wife and I were contemplating on exchanging it for equal slices since they were the same price at $7.95. We arrive back at the cheesecake factory with only 5 to 10 minutes passing by since us leaving. I did not wan't to deal with the rude employee so I approached a manager and he had asked if everything was fine. I explained I wanted to exchange the slice for a bigger portion since they were the same price. Get our moneys worth you know... Sam the manager said once a slice leaves the place they can't exchange it but he could give a discount at 25% if we would like to purchase a bigger piece. I agreed and had already pulled my debit card and he noticed my military ID thanking me for my service. I said thank you also. At the sometime the disgruntle employee is nodding her head in disgust as if we were trying to get a free slice. I couldn't hold my tongue anymore and said this is what I had to deal with earlier. Pointed to her and told him she is rude. He said don't worry I will take care of you and you can pick a slice and we will cover it. Let me explain I did not want anything free but I called my wife over and she picked out an oreo cheesecake slice. The employee had to cut the free slice for us but was still shaking her head. This made me more furious and I started to raise my voice. During all this commotion the employee was still nodding her head the whole time I was talking to Sam. There was at least 4 separate instances she did it. Sam said he would take care of her later. He also explained he would take care of us the next time we came in. He asked if we were locals. I said yes I have been stationed at Nellis, AFB more than 11 years. I still left pissed off. I don't care about the free slice. I would have paid for better customer service.

5278293,2015-07-30,6,NoA6bD6W7z_Aztk_cOU5cg,"I've never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory because I feel like their food is mediocre and overpriced. That being said, this newly opened restaurant at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets is a welcome addition. Dining options at the outlets have always been severely limited and kind of atrocious. It's nice to have a sit-down option instead of eating at the food court. 

PRO TIP: Make sure to enter through the front entrance near the street, otherwise you'll walk in on the side like we did and be confused as to where the hostess stand is located. 

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Served with softened butter that spread easily on the bread. Love when that happens. 4/5

FRIED ZUCCHINI ($4.95): Served with a side of ranch. Came with maybe 8 pieces of zucchini. Delicious. 4/5

LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA ($16.95): Our waiter said this dish was very popular. My husband and I split this dish and ordered the chicken on the side. More than enough food for two people! I don't understand how they serve this huge bowl of pasta to one individual. Unfortunately, the dish wasn't as spicy as I would have liked and could have used a bigger helping of veggies. 2/5 

SERVICE: Waiter was great. He was super cool about accommodating a picky vegetarian eater (me). Hostess was super friendly and we were sat at a booth on a Monday night with no wait time. 4/5  

VIBE: Modern cafe with a tan and brown color palette. Very family friendly. 3/5 

GOOD TO KNOW: If you fill out the feedback survey on your receipt, you get a $10 e-gift card good on your next visit. :)

Worth a Return Visit?
Subtotal was about $27 for one entree and one small appetizer. Prices add up quickly here. We ate here because we were starving and didn't have a lot of dining options available to us. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, only as a last resort kind of thing.

Small insects in the salt shakers with flies tasting your food. As for tonight when I clearly stated I didn't want to sit in that area I was directed to the outside/Inside area again.. I was told I would be put at the end of the seating list and would have a long wait if I refused the table, even with my complaint of my last visit the young hostess continued to seat us in the area stating it wasn't outdoors. To sum it all up I ended up being seated directly against the opening to  the outside with bugs crawling on the back seat cushions and spiders on the sides while my food was being served..!

This was my first time to this property. I came tonight for a birthday party. Now I understand large groups can be challenging but with that being said there were still some awkward moments. I arrived and when I asked for my party the girl at the front just gave me half ass directions. She told me to go through the double doors. The only double doors I saw looked like an exit outside so I just kind of roamed around aimlessly until I was able to stop and ask another employee where to go. So those double doors that led out were correct. So they have doors that go outside first and then there is another set of doors leading to a separate room. But come on.... I know I couldn't have been the first person to be confused by the layout. It wouldn't have killed her to give a little more detail. Our server was nice and personable. I ordered the Louisiana pasta. Tasty but not really memorable. The lady next to me ordered the salmon which she said was fantastic. Two people on opposite ends of the table ordered the shrimp angel hair pasta and they both said the shrimp was WAY over cooked, rubbery and a lot of shell. See no one really checked on how the meal was until we were all almost done. Since it was a birthday my friend was trying to be discreet and let the server know about the dissatisfaction with the shrimp on two dishes. His response was that she should have let him no sooner. And yes... she should have. But no one came by to check. So was she supposed to interrupt dinner to find someone. Again, it was a birthday party and she didn't want to make a scene. Then the check came without offering anyone dessert. Yes.... dessert came for the birthday girl. So that should have been a great time to ask anyone if they would like to finish it off with something sweet. When my check was handed to me I asked for a piece to go and was told I would have to have two separate checks. Ok fine. I guess it's somehow my fault I wasn't offered dessert before the check. 2 bills then. Whatever. Just bring me my cheesecake please....",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,15,6,3,_rlizArTfgvmiD61ni9pgg

When we arrive we didn't have to wait long, so that was pleasant.  Once they called my name to seat us knowing full well we have a small child and need a menu for him they didn't bring one. 

They station us in a back area from the main dinning area. I didn't care so much about that, we did have to walk outside to go back inside to be seated.  
Once we are seated and given our menus I realize we didn't get a kids menu and I asked for one.  The hostess never brought us one so we ended up having to ask the waitress what was available for children. This was after we had already sat at the table 15 minutes before we were even greeted by our waitress; who was overwhelmed.   

We figure out what my son wants, we order drinks and food. We are asked if we want bread and we say yes. Then our waitress was off, we order water, sprite and a mojito.  We get our water and sprite about five minutes later and about fifteen minutes after that they bring my food and my husbands. I set timer and they bring my sons plate out, over five minutes later.  

When I was done with my meal they finally bring my mojito (mind you, after I ordered it I said I'd walk back over and get it because it is pretty far from our seating area). They never did bring us bread and we never did see out waitress again because someone else brought our meals and drinks. 

After we were done eating it took another fifteen minutes to get our check.

For real please and after all the bs it was not even good there was hardly any sauce on it and the pasta was so dry.",wo-k89Shzw3Hn_jOErVHAA,0,0,1,EuPi3M7WIAJpxoiqo-YoLw

1) Giant covered patio with fans so you enjoy the outdoor feel, but are insulated from outlet traffic and direct sunlight.
2) Very willing and able to split checks. I went with 7 friends and our waiter offered to split the check for us; we didn't even have to ask.
3) Someone constantly checking on you. If my water glass hit 75% full, it was promptly filled back up. We were also asked at least twice if our food was all cooked to our liking.
4) Those bread baskets. If you haven't been to Cheesecake Factory and are opposed to chain restaurants, at least go enjoy a complimentary bread basket and a latte. 
5) The food is delicious and amazing and they hit every price range. You can spend $50 on yourself for dinner, or $10 and still leave satisfied and happy. 
6) Contrary to what most people would think, this is a great restaurant to go to if you're gluten-free or gluten intolerant. They mark menu items with a GF option so you can have a ton of items modified to be gluten-free (pasta, flat breads, sandwiches, salads, etc.).

The only negative I can think of is the fact that this restaurant is crowded. I wouldn't recommend it for an intimate occasion. The customer to server ratio has got to be 5:1. I've never seen so many servers in one place. It's good because you get a ton of attention, but can be annoying when you're trying to walk to your table and walk to the bathroom and have to wait for a lot of people to pass.",-lEaTSpvijdhR7NkVQB5xQ,4,2,5,zJZrEB6FrbdvoR4JU9jTpQ
5755008,2016-07-25,1,NoA6bD6W7z_Aztk_cOU5cg,"The Cheesecake Factory offered an inviting lunch venue today.  A full sun, morning in July with a temperature of 108°F already, can leave a shopping clan of adults and children weary, parched and irritable. 

Upon our entry, the service was cheerful, immediate, and helpful. Our table service from James was hospitable and accurate. The Kids' Menu was varied. The proportions were generous. My son opted for grilled salmon, sauteed carrots and French Fries. My daughter's plate had crispy, moist chicken tenders fresh fruit and also French Fries. The chicken was surprisingly lightly battered rather than a dense mass.

Thank you Cheesecake Factory for a family friendly day in Las Vegas. A 5 star day for me is a menu with lots of organic options.",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,3,2,4,dcrmWrafCXk1xmyQ0tu_ow

My family and I were not asked and didn't feel as though we had an option on whether or not we wanted to sit on the patio, but we tried to make it work. We ended up asking for a different table on the patio and I completely understand having to deal with picky guests as I too work in the restaurant business, but if we had been offered the patio from the beginning we would have politely declined.

Our server Skyler was AWESOME though. He had all the answers to the questions we had about the menu. He never looked bored or like he wanted us to hurry up. He was very attentive and we never had to ask for refills. In the end, I would say we were very well taken care of by Skyler.",YLhVF2a_iv99fFRLngLV6A,0,1,4,U9oRV_ztY_M_MYxdKDoTCA

Look at the options.  Got one down the street so i know I can make a to go order and come and pick something good to enjoy at my house.1/2 of my pasta was cooked the other half was under cooked.  Shrimp tasted not cooked all the way. And I have always been a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. But idk I am just saying. How do you have a huge Resturant and you only have two small tiny stalls in the bathrooms.  Really???? I think bathrooms need to be upgraded. 
Our waitress was helpful when I went to tell her about my meal so she told the manager and he is suppose to come over and talk to me about. The manager was awesome and comped my meal. Wanted to give me another one. But I am full and am not wanting to eat anything else for the rest of the day.",L8uTsKW08avT83Q9A8y3vQ,1,1,5,vq92JFV3F9rfKZvRgizIJQ

After speaking with a representative of the Cheesecake Factory corporate office, I opted to give another location a shot. Checking out the franchise on Rampart in Summerlin, I was pleasantly surprised. We took my lovely mother in law, who is as notoriously hard to please as my beautiful wife and a really good time was had by all. Impeccable service and the entrees arrived as expected and quite good. Trust me when I say that the flavor profile the manager was going for at the Outlet Shops location was NOT what was served in Summerlin. Night and day, really. 

I'm not saying to patronize one location over any other and I'm not saying I'll be rushing back to another Cheesecake Factory, but I'm glad corporate talked me into a return visit because if all I knew was the sloppy service and the slop on the plate at the Outlet Shops I'd do whatever I could to steer y'all clear.  That run on sentence notwithstanding, second chances can be a good thing.",WxFtif-3NVAIMKBlmMDCKQ,0,0,3,5sgk7j9EaN0gKsU3v7o99w

I had a margarita margarita drink that was not that strong at all. maybe I'm being a little too hard but I don't know it just didn't taste like the Cheesecake Factory that I'm used to.

Ordered Swiss mushroom burger medium and it was not. Already had waited for my food didn't wait for them to redo it, and there is always the fear someone will do something to your food.

I had to go for Half Price Cheesecake days, and I arrived shortly after opening. To my surprise, there was no one sitting at the bar. I had the new salted caramel cheesecake which is quite delightful! It has a blonde brownie bottom and I love cheesecake that is a combo even more! 
They really should do the half price deal more often than once a year!

 I ordered a kids Mac and Cheese,Deluxe Cheeseburger Sliders with bacon,and fried mac and cheese balls.
 1/2 My order came 
- my burgers had no cheese and bacon, the wait time was 15mins,and the waitress said sorry we couldn't figure how to add it into the system with out charging it (but i was charged anyways)
 and my sons mac and cheese had no flavor, and i had to add salt.  
And my fried Mac and cheese balls never came out, i had to finally ask the waitress  and she didnt even write it down.  I was pissed! So the wait time for that was another 15 mins.  
My meal was ruined and when your dining with Toddlers, time is of the essence!  But what pissed me off is nothing was comp for my messed up order and the wait time.  This will be my last time dining at cheesecake factory.",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,2,0,1,uEYNo02nuhoVmS4olFaCdQ

Each of us had pasta and the pasta was cold and stuck together. I had shrimp (five of them) with my pasta and it tasted as though it may have been cooked yesterday. The server was okay, but he delivered our entrees at different times. Perhaps my pasta wasn't cold and sticky enough yet. Forty dollars for no-so-good two entrees and one drink is also a bit pricey, but I guess the marketing must be paid for as it seems they aren't spending good money on food product. Too pricey for less than mediocre and truth be told, if the bill were only twenty dollars, it would still not be worth the quality of food delivered to us - at separate time!",NRDPxcLR4DpNvRxYIcieEQ,0,0,2,CouQo0S3GeM-JZaKNiryLw
