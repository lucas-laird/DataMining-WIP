Waitress, not so attentive and seemed stressed out. Took her about 8 min or so just to take our drink order and when she did, she said, ""three ice waters for the three of you?"" When clearly there is only 2 of us. (Scratching head) Not blaming the waitress, but it the booths have a stink to them, like they wipe them down with dirty water and dirty towels. Not really appealing to the nose when you're hungry and waiting for food. But the 2 stars are for their menu and quantity of food.

839027,2011-04-10,4,Wg9272hxpu9IBTXMTB6EeQ,"Dear Mr. Chili Manager,

I am finding it hard to find the words to express the roller coaster of emotions I felt at my most recent trip to your Grill & Bar.  My husband and I noticed that you have brought back your 2 for $20 deal once and for all and decided to take you up on your offer.  Upon being seated we were greeted by a young lady who I believe her name was Ruth.  We advised her that we will be partaking in the 2 for $20 special and ordered the Cheeseburger and Chicken Crispers (which by the way why are there two versions?? It is very confusing and unnecessary).  For our appetizer we indicated we would love to feast on the Texas Cheese Fries with no jalapenos.  A few minutes later, as i sipped on my delicious strawberry lemonade, Ruth delivered our cheese fries.  As she placed them on the table she immediately took them back as she realized we had asked for no jalapenos and sure enough the little green monsters were sprinkled throughout our batch of fries.  No big deal mistakes happen.  Less than 2 minutes later she returns with our new order... or so I thought.  
Here is where the plot thickens.   As my husband began to dive in to our appetizer I couldn't help but notice the placement of the fries seemed to look exactly has they had when they had jalapenos on top.  I hesitantly take a fry and notice they seem a tad spicier than they should.  My wheels are turning.. is my mind playing tricks on me?  I express my concern to my husband and ask if we have just been bamboozled and reserved the same batch of fries?  I feel my angry eyes being activated...  If I just wanted to pick off the jalapenos I would have done it myself.  I begin to think.. oh no who picked them off was it our server?  Were her hands clean?  My husband is chuckling at my freak out he said he would ask and take care of it.  Sure enough after asking our server she confirmed that was in fact the case.  My husband in trying to stress the wrongness of doing that saying he was allergic and that we wouldn't want to see his face swell and turn red.  She apologized and said that when most people ask for no jalapenos its just because they don't like them.  Okay first of all, if I ask for no jalapenos I shouldn't have to indicate if it is a preference or a medical condition.  Secondly, news flash if you pick them off there is still seeds and juices that can still reek havoc on the fries and cheese.  And lastly, I don't care whatever the reason, if the order is wrong I think the proper procedure would be to do a re-fire.  Isn't here health codes for a reason?
I believe that Miss Ruth realized the error in her ways.  Especially because now our entrees arrived pretty much at the same time as our appetizer because of this situation.  I gave you two stars because I do give Ruth a A for effort as she must have apologized 5 or 6 times during our meal and even offered a free dessert for our troubles.  
Mr. Chili Manager.. please tell me this is an isolated incident and not how you train your staff to fix orders.  Unfortunately, I will forever remember your location as the ""Jalapeno Picker Outer"" spot.",GbHckhaFyxErPGKAP0PJQw,3,1,2,5dImYBr1ggYTUUokL4ODPw

I had been craving chips and queso from Chili's for MONTHS! We were gifted a $25 Chili's Gift Card and so FINALLY my craving would be fulfilled!

Friday night, 7 pm, busy restaurant but table of 4 was seated right away. Quick but unfriendly service. I admit we were indecisive, but you don't have to roll your eyes at us. Twice. I've been a server and bartender so I understand how indecisiveness can be annoying, but say ""you guys look like you could use more time, I'll come back in 2.""

Any-whoo. We had our chips and queso, AND both couples did the 2-for-$20 deal so we also had loaded fries and cheese sticks. Oh, did I mention it was Friday, all food from Friday at 5pm to Sunday at midnight is calorie free! YAY! 

Husband had the burger and I had the quesadilla explosion salad. No shortage of food at this table! 2 hours and 2 margaritas each and we needed a forklift to get us to the car. It has been years since I visited Chili's and this trip did not disappoint. 

Only gave it 3 starts because the ice-margarita-size of glass ratio was wack (coming from a former Mexican restaurant bartender), moody server and because it's a chain restaurant..come on, a chain should never get 5 stars unless they don't use frozen ingredients and have original recipes at each location and a chef...not just a cook. JMHO.

I will come back to Chili's and this is a great location.",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,1,1,3,cW-D0elemjoPbI-34EMVYw

The food was was ok, but it wasn't their typical quality we have come to love.

The parking lot seemed busy, but happy were we to see that there was not much going on inside.  Quick eats.......or so we thought.  We were seated on the periphery of the bar area.  Our server was nice enough and for that....I won't mention her by the name on my receipt.

All this being said...this particular location played into every single corporate restaurant stereotype I have.  As previously stated, it was not busy, but the speed in which our initial and subsequent orders were taken, one would think it was happening night.  It was not.

My lady ordered soup, salsa and chips meal.  Unlimited if I recall.  If that was the case we would still be waiting for the next order.

Since chips were already ordered, I ordered some queso not wanting to creating waste.  The idea was for it to arrive before our meal to cut the hunger pains, not right right before our meal, and only after I had to ask about it's whereabouts. 

In addition to the dip, I ordered a buffalo chicken salad.  When this finally did arrive, it was lifeless.  The kind of lifeless one would find only after it sat under some heating lamp for an unknown amount of time.  Lifeless and shallow was the plate it was served on.  I was left wanting.

To numb the pain of this miserable dining experience, multiple margaritas were ordered.  At one point and time, the last rounds location also had to be inquired about.

Soooooo.....shame on me.  Next time I find myself in the predicament, on this side of town.....we will keep looking for something else, or just go home and eat some eggs.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,5,4,1,yjp7YUsDogp-HbbDijV3lA

we came in with a party of 15. everyone pretty much ordered a majority of the menu.  not one meal was up to par. the salmon was dry, steak was horrible & all the vegetables were dry. no one was happy.  we usually have a rule of thumb that we tip 10% for bad service and 35% for good as well as 50% for great service . i have not left a restaurant and not left a tip at all in the last 10 years, but this location takes the cake!  they should be sponsored on bar rescue.  the servers and cooks need to be retrained in how to perform in the service industry. we had to ask for a new server within the first 15 mins of being seated. our second server was just there to take our order and hurry us up. nothing was done without having to flag our server down and ask.

Chili's is close to their home and I have had good experiences eating at other Chili's in the past. I went on line through Yelp and was able to view their menu and place my family's orders. Their on line take out menu was a pleasure to use - very intuitive. Needless to say, I made an error in getting my daughter's order. But the fix was also ridiculously easy. They promised that it would be ready at 4:59 PM. We got there just at 5 o'clock. Sure enough, the order was ready for us and still warm. And they got everything exactly correct. We ordered the Two for $20 special. Saved us $4 on the list prices for the entrees and they threw in a free app. Such a deal!!! We got the chicken fajitas and an extra of rice and beans for an additional buck. Definitely worthwhile if you are getting the fajitas. We also got guac and chips as our free appetizer. It went really well with the fajitas. The portion size for the fajitas was huge - more than enough for the two of us to share. The chicken was super moist and tender. The fajita veggies were mostly fried onions and green peppers. But it also came with a nice supply of sour cream, cheese, salsa, pico de gallo and jalapeños on the side. The flour tortillas were just OK. My son-in-law loved his chicken and pasta dish and my daughter really liked her hamburger.

Yesterday I  decided to go for lunch. I invited my son. I hadn't heard from him & I figured he'd be at work. So I decided to grab a chicken bowl to go. I asked for dressings on the side. It took 20 min. @ the failed to put dressings on side. I waited another 20 min. For it to be remade. During that time my son texted & said he could meet later. I went home, returned later w him for dinner. The restaurant had a few people in the bar & NOT ONE PARTY in the dining rm. where we wished to sit. There was no one to greet or seat is for 15 min. My son advised the Bartender & she seemed a little agitated that she had to assist us & finally seat us. Finally about 10 min. later the server came. She apologized for her tardiness & also for the large ""atomic fireball"" she was chomping on. She took the order all along chomping on her candy. Very gross.

Tonight I had a strange craving for a Margarita and something protein based like burger or steak. As I debated over where to go, I thought...I have no make up on and I just want food that I can count on and someone else to cook and serve. I figured, what the heck a Chili's would probably be exactly what the doctor ordered. Quick in...grab a Margarita, burger, relaxation, head home...

That isn't what I got

I walked in and sat down at the bar. The bartender somehow didn't see me walkin with the whole 6 other people sitting there. I sat down and waited and waited and waited...long enough that I got frustrated and started watching him only to see him watching the basketball game. Yeah that wasn't making the situation better. A good 5 minutes after I sat down he FINALLY noticed me and came over fumbling with menus. By the way, never apologizing for not seeing me there. He asks me what I want to drink and I ask for water while I look at the menu. This takes unbelievably long with him putsing around doing random tasks while I wait...

He finally comes back with some water when I order a Presidente Margarita and then very clearly order a burger rare, no bun, and sub broccoli for the fries. He seems like he heard it all and goes off to spend several minutes on the POS and mixing my drink. When the margarita arrives I figure things will now be ok and turn around. I mean really how much more can he do wrong?

I play on my phone for a few when the food arrives. I see the fries and ask the girl who brought them if she could get me broccoli instead. At  this VERY SECOND she and bartender disappear to the kitchen leaving me with my sad burger patty (seriously Chilis you charge people $9 for THAT little piece of burger?) getting colder and colder since he never bothered to bring me a knife and fork. As I sit there for a good 5 minutes wishing I had gotten at least a ""Oh I'm sorry. Let me fix that but here's a knife and fork so you can eat while I'm in the kitchen"" I start to get irritated AGAIN. At this point I'm just over it all. I came here for simple, easy and consistent. Instead I got irritation, ignored, and mediocre.

When he finally comes back with the broccoli and FINALLY offers me a knife and fork, I push back the plate, offer to pay for my drink, and tell him this was NOT what I wanted when I came out to eat...

Instead I came home and cooked which was EXACTLY what I did NOT want to do.

In the end I was so irritated by the whole situation that I can guarantee that I will NEVER walk into this location again and I have hesitations to ever go into any Chili's again. I just wanted someone to acknowledge that I sat down, get me some food, and know that a fork would be nice BEFORE the food was cold.

My family and I ate here for lunch on a weekday. The service was okay. I think the inside of the restaurant is very colorful and exciting, which is the exact opposite of their food.

We got the lunch specials. The pictures of the food were approximately 10 times better than the actual real food. The loaded potato soup was just okay. The chili was a little bit better. I did like that they had five soups available that day, but what about having just one or two soups that are out of this world?

I ordered the chicken fajita lunch special, which was $8. I added rice for an extra dollar. This really wasn't that good. I would have rather gone to a local taco shop than eat this; better yet, Chipotle would have been waaaay better.

I reviewed this restaurant over a year ago and the management assured me they corrected all their issues and they even sent me gift cards asking me to come back (which I still have).  However last night at work, we decided to order  from here again.  I was leery, but I figured I would try it again.   I ordered the Crispy Chicken Crispers with corn on the cob, fries and house-made ranch dressing.  Well, when the food arrived at work,  I got mine opened it and the first thing I noticed that there was nothing ""crisp"" about these ""crispers"".  The breading was more like KFC's Original Recipe Breading.  Now, I actually prefer that, so that was not the deal breaker.  The first one I ate, I could only eat part of it, simply because the other part was fat or gristle.  That wasn't even the worst part.   I could not eat the rest of them, because the others were partially raw.  One of them was nothing but fat or gristle.  So, I essentially had corn, fries, and house-made ranch for dinner, which there was nothing wrong with any of that stuff.  However, raw chicken can kill people.  Chicken needs to be cooked thoroughly.  I've never had an issue with chicken there.  As a matter of fact, what I wanted to get originally was their Grilled Chicken Sandwich, which once again, they changed their menu and took off ANOTHER dish that I always got there.  I am totally done eating at Chili's.  I will use the gift cards either for drinking purposes or I'll re-gift them to someone else.

I actually find it rather comforting that no matter which location, you pretty much know what to expect. I hadn't been to a Chili's in some time since the one near us closed and it's not the kind of place you go out of your way for. but still, I didn't expect this. 

The one I remembered was fairly bright and cheerful; this was dingy and actually sort of scary looking. Big surprise on a more affluent side of town. Everything looked like it could use a good scrub down, and maybe change the light bulbs or something because there was a definite pall of depression hanging over it all. 

We decided to start with a chili dip appetizer. This was marked on the menu as a best seller. I think that was a trick. We received a dish of what I imagine the Game of Thrones infamous ""bowl of brown"" would resemble. It was a glop of what I assume was canned chili in its former life, mixed with what I can only imagine was canned cheese sauce, and reheated until it WAY past time to toss it, then thrown on a plate with some greasy tortilla chips and served to us. Nice.

We hoped the entrees would be better, but for a place that advertises itself as a destination for ribs, my advice is to keep going. These were also overcooked to the point of chewiness, and I also suspect it was not their first day on the premises.

Perhaps the dreary lighting was an intentional ploy to discourage close inspection of the questionable food.

They deserve one star, but are getting kicked up one because the server was energetic and really trying hard.  He deserves better. So do you.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,2,2,2,1E6iKUebvMUkwjlKRMBtlQ

This is my first time at this location, but I wanted to provide my input because of the other poor-rated reviews I read on here. 

Upon entering, I was greeted based by the host who seems like he's having as much fun as one can have at a funeral. Needless to say, he seemed attentive. I was going to sit at the bar/lounge at first because of my lonely party of one, but the singular bartender/waiter/server indicated that I would have a 5-10 minute wait prior to greeting me. He seemed unusually busy, which cautions me away from sitting there. I recommend more staffing. 

I decided to sit in the restaurant instead. I was greeted by a very tired waitress who joined me at the table to sit and take my order. I usually don't mind this, but a preface to sitting would make a connection, but maintain professionalism. I was impressed when 2 waitresses wanted to serve me. A mix up with the tables, but still wanting to serve me instead of give me away made me feel appreciated as a customer. 

I ordered the bottomless express lunch for $6.99 which includes chips and salsa, a house salad, and one of four soups. I chose the southwest chicken soup which is more like a chicken tortilla soup. Food was delivered fast as it's probably prepared by the server, hopefully without bare hand contact, a huge pet peeve. 

My soup was hot and topped with tortilla strips and fresh cut cilantro. The soup contained fair amounts of chicken and chickpeas and was flavorful with just the right amount of spice. I recommend asking for a side of sour cream!  The house salad is pretty standard with upgrades such as cut tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, onions, frisée. This pairs nicely with their ranch. The bottomless express lunch is $8.99 after 4pm, so consider that before ordering. 

My server was attentive and ensured I got refills of solid food and drink when necessary. I utilized the Ziosk machine to check out with ease, provided a tip, and took a survey. Don't fool around with the machine though; you will get charged for the games.

It was a group of 5, with 4 of us arriving together and the 5th showing up a little late. We were seated promptly, our waiter came over shortly after to take our drink orders. He carded me, and since I well over the legal drinking age I am always happy when I get carded. Chips and salsa came out shortly afterward.

After looking over the menu and coming to our decisions we placed our orders. I asked our waiter which of the two salads I was considering he preferred, and he said the quesadilla explosion salad was his favorite so I went with that. He pointed out that the salad comes tossed with the citrus dressing, and asked if I would prefer it on the side... I said I would.

Sadly my salad came out tossed in the dressing. Why ask if you aren't going to make it happen? My boss requested mustard for his burgers, after waiting a few minutes we ended up flagging down a second server to get it.

It didn't seem crowded, but there was a large party in the lobby. It was steady. 

Service started off slow (there was an apology) but when we got our orders in, the food came out pretty fast. Our server checked in with us pretty frequently and refilled our drinks too.

We got the panko onion rings (perfect, crisp, seasoned just right, not greasy, not overdone) for our starter. Hubby got a burger (said it rivaled Red Robin), came with skin-on fries (just right), I got the fajitas (carnitas) with corn tortillas. I've gotten it here before but not the carnitas, was shredded and tender. It was really good. (Almost reminded me of Cozymels.) Little man got chicken nuggets (puffy batter) and fries. Good thing we asked our server, because the other chicken nugget choice was more breaded. We opted for the less breaded kind. He liked it, kind of a picky eater, but chicken is one of his favorites.

Hubby said we don't come here enough and I agree. Was one of my go-to restaurants during my college years. We had leftovers to enjoy for the rest of the weekend.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,5,4,p_TmJCkddpKBx6fYFclANg

For one thing, I won't order delivery through Grub Hub from this location any longer. They refuse even the simplest of requests.

Second, apparently no one really cooks at this Chili's. Everything is premeasured, prepackaged, pre-everything, so you can't say, no onions please. Too bad. It comes with onions.

I do not normally write reviews for mediocre restaurants, but tonight took the cake. Went in at 10:20 after a long day at the office. A kid was screaming at the top of his lungs. I asked not to be seated next to the screaming child. I was told that was the only place available, because all the other sections were closed.

I looked around an empty restaurant with a table that held a screaming child, and asked why I couldn't be seated at one of the many empty tables in the place. According to the host, it doesn't work that way.

So I turned around and left and went to Applebee's. Where there was also a screaming child. But at Applebee's, they had the great good sense to recognize that as annoying to other diners; they managed to find a quiet table - without my having to ask.

I loved being able to pull up to the bar/counter and watch the baseball game on the main TV, despite it being Sunday or Monday night football.  (Even the casinos' sports books featured the football games over the Worlds Series!)  Sure, the other TVs showed football but the sound was on the baseball game.  (And this is a dream for the Husband!) 

Another big plus is that this is a completely smoke free environment.  Yes, even though it's a state law that you can't smoke where food is served, many local bars still do it.  So I definitely appreciate that you cannot light up anywhere in this restaurant.

During football season, happy hour is in full swing which means discounted food and drinks.  I'm loving their Bottomless Tostada Chips (and the baby was loving it too at one point).  I used to love Chevy's version of chips and salsa, but I love Chili's version more.  Other appetizers we've tried were the Skillet Queso, which is a meat and cheese dip and best enjoyed when it's hot.  The Husband also had their Boneless Buffalo Wings with bleu cheese dressing.
 
One of their great deals would be the Bottomless Express Lunch.  It's AYCE soup, salad, and chips and salsa; and you can change your soup options so you're not stuck with just one kind.  The salad option is either a house salad or their Caesars salad.  Soup choices include Chicken and Green Chile Soup, Sweet Corn Soup, Chicken Enchilada Soup, and their Soup of the Day.  For 50 cents more, you can include their Terlingua Chili into the mix.  For $2 more, it becomes the Bottomless Express Dinner!

Sitting at the bar/counter - it's definitely a leisurely meal and the bartenders aren't rushing you, which is something we appreciate.  We can still grab a table in the bar area and get plenty of attention from the waitstaff, especially when you're getting refills on your salad and soup.

And talk about family-friendly, this place is the spot.  Every night we've been there, we've seen tons of families littered all over this place.

Our server Angie was a disappointment. She took a good 15mins before she even came over to greet us and take our drink order. She insisted on taking our drink order first and then once we had our drinks she would take our order. Little did we know it would take another 10mins for them to arrive. We did not see her wait on anyone else, so why the lateness??? Who knows? 

We waited a good 45 mins for our food, during that time no drink refills were offered. We asked different servers twice, nothing. We asked the hostess for napkins when she was nearby seating others, she said she would and we never saw her again. Finally when our food arrive we asked Angie for drinks and napkins. It still took another 10mins. At this time we told her she should be asking other servers for help if was overwhelmed...... her reply ""I did but they were busy too"" 

I don't think that's true as there were empty tables around us.... servers cleaning and clearing tables. 

We spent two hours there, two hours too long. The only reason I gave them 3 stars was because of the food. The food was fine, it's the service that really disappointed us and ruin our dinner. Never again will we be back to this particular Chili's.

A little note to Angie: after your initial late arrival, we could careless about your personal life. That will not make up for the 15mins we had been waiting for you to take our order. Just apologize and take the order.",latMbuZ5oyV-lOq7g5zELA,0,0,3,EZh50QnCTFLquEx1k_i3SA

The bartender was quick to take our drink orders and our order. We got our appetizer in a timely manner. But when our food came out- I had a problem. Me being a server- I would never drop a plate to a customer that didn't look up to par. If I noticed something wrong with the plate I would either go back and ask the cooks to change food item or just tell the costumer that we're out of this specific item and apologize. I ordered the mango salsa tilapia. But when she placed plate in front of me- I immediately noticed my avocados were brown and black and not green. When she came back I asked if the avocados were grilled and she replied nO. So I asked well can I get new avocados. She said that she doesn't know why they were like that but all the avocados in the back were coming out like that.  I don't think they should be serving the avocados at all then. She came back out with 3 slices of avocados that looked better than what they were before so I appreciate the effort. Service was great. Drinks were filled and everything but today is was poor quality on judgement on the food. Just had to let them know!,qr_6z5Ov4T_NsiYcYFkrOQ,1,0,2,RuooSfuWXgNCRof5y1Joxw

Then after that it still took her a few minutes to get our drink order. I understand being busy but it literally takes 5 seconds to say hi there I'll be with you in a moment. That probably would have helped change the whole tone of the visit honestly. The server was nice once she got to us and did her job. She could have been a little more attentive but she got the job done. Oh and when dessert was brought out the appetizer was still in the middle of the table. Pre-bussing is one of my biggest pet peeves when out to eat. You can tell when a table is finished with something and if you're not then ask if they need a box for it. If they don't then they tell you that you may take it from the table.

5659608,2014-02-11,0,Wg9272hxpu9IBTXMTB6EeQ,"Came here recently with my boyfriend because I had a $25 gift card. Rather than getting our usual 2 for 20 meal we got the 2 for 35 that came with two margaritas, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. Tequila isn't really my thing but the raspberry gold margarita wasn't half bad. I was just always under the impression that salt is put on the rim...not sugar. Still gave a nice punch nonetheless.

The appetizer we got was the deep friend shredded onion and jalapeño slices with (ranch?) dip. We were surprised that the pieces of onion were so tiny...Seemed more like a garnish than an appetizer. It was huge though, and we just munched one around 80% of it before our entrees came. The seasoning was also very strong, which tasted good before the salt got to me.

I came in with the intention of trying something new, but we both got our usual entrees - ribs and steak. My rare steak was tender and juicy as always, with a touch of butter on top. The loaded mash was flavorful and creamy and the broccoli was cooked to the perfect level of firmness. I saved my garlic toast to take to go but left it there... ): 

The dessert was a chocolate chip cookie skillet, which had more chocolate than cookie. We opted out of the chocolate fudge and it was still too sweet. Satisfied my chocolate chip cookie craving though.

All in all, it was a pleasant dining experience because of the gift card paying for most of our meal and the attentive waitress that regularly checked up on us. She did forget to bring the extra BBQ sauce we requested but was easily reminded to.

The positives:

The ""endless"" chips and salsa are pretty yummy.

The margaritas are usually really good

I like the new pretzel stick appetizer they have

Most of the servers we have had have been friendly and attentive

The negatives:

The FOOD! Really that is the only thing, but this is a restaurant. I have pretty much given up on trying to get a good meal here. I have tried a million and one things and while parts of it are sometimes good, I have never gotten a consistently good meal. The margarita chicken is good, but the sides suck and seem old and stale. Same with the burger, decent but the fries are usually bad. The kids meals are TERRIBLE, to the point I never even pick this as a place to take the kids for dinner anymore. 

Usually if I come here, its the hubby and me for lunch.  When we come we generally get the chips and salsa endless lunch with soup and salad, but lately even the soup and salad kind of sucks. 

With all that said, will I be back there at some point enjoying a margarita, chips and salsa and pretzel sticks? Yep. But if I want an actual dinner or lunch, not just a salty (in a good way), carb fest, I would pick somewhere else.",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,2,1,2,vCJEbqnCQT_tSgeSEsvhrw

When we walked in we were greeted right away and sat at the bar. The waiter came by and quickly asked us what we wanted to drink. We just sat down and couldn't decide so asked for some waters. Not too long after that our waiter came back to ask us if we were ready to order. I asked for another quick minute as we were debating on whether it would be better to get the deal we saw on TV or the 2 for $22. Well that minute turned into 20 minutes which my husband had to flag our waiter down and tell him we were finally ready to place our order. Which was kind of odd to me since he literally sat us down and came to us twice before. 

We ended up just going for the 2 for $22 since it was bigger portions according to my husband. I got the half rack of ribs , he got some chicken pasta dish, and we chose the guacamole and salsa for the appetizer. 

The chips were piled high on the plate when they came and the salsa looked a bit watery. To me it kinda tasted like the tostito salsa you buy at the grocery store but the guacamole was okay.  The ribs were okay a little burnt in some areas and the pasta was cheesy. What really disappointed me was that I heard another waiter tell the new table across from us that there were options for sauces for the baby back ribs. I was surprised there were other options like honey Chipotle to pick from and I have no idea why our waiter neglected to mention those options to me when I ordered my dinner. 

We ended up getting the molten cake for dessert because my husband knows I love chocolate. It wasn't as I remembered but it was still good.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,2,RN0cYOEgg5_KPpalNiENRQ
