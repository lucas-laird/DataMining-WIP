Udon is to die for. Miso is fresh (not from paste or powder). Best green tea out there made fresh from actual green tea leaves.

1115894,2012-03-13,0,F5jwXCeAqHzs-c87sps5gg,"All around good enough......


Sato-ya has a lot of things going for it, here are a few:  comfortable dining room with lots of ""Japanese"" decor, super friendly staff w/ good service, and great prices.  

They have a dinner special where you can pick three items for $12.95 which include a lot of sushi and a few cooked items.  You also have to order a miso soup or a beverage to get this deal, so it ends up coming out to right under $20 w/ tax, which is still an outrageously great value.  **A few of the items require a $2 up charge, but you don't have to order those.  

We ended up ordering two of the specials, here is what he had:

Miso Soup - Balanced flavors, a little on the salty side but still quit satisfying.

Japanese ""Ceviche"" - Chopped sashimi (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail) with some jalapenos, red pepper in a soy/miso based sauce.  This dish was tasty and fresh, but not a lot of fish really.  

Agedashi Tofu - Topped with grated Daikon radish in a light soy sauce.  Good flavor, but the inside of the tofu was a bit slimy.  It didn't seem like they used firm tofu, which could be why it was more gloppy than I've had elsewhere. 

Creamy Rock Shrimp - Small shrimp tossed in a heavy mayo/sriraucha sauce.  The shrimp were mushy beneath the heavy sauce.  I'd avoid this one, there are better options. 

Creamy Rock Shrimp w/ spicy tuna sushi - Same complaint about the shrimp as above, although this time it was on top of a spicy tuna roll.  It was just too much going on, too much mayo, and not enough pronounced flavor.

Crispy rice w/ spicy tuna - The rice was perfectly crisped to give that crunchy texture, but the tuna itself was lacking a lot of flavor.  It wasn't spicy, however the sliver of jalapeno on top helped add  a little heat. 

Shrimp Tempura roll - Very standard.  I liked that the roll wasn't huge, so the pieces were a reasonable size to take down in one gobble.  



I left the meal with a bit of a stomach ache, most likely from the heavy mayo sauce on the shrimp dishes.  I would come back, but I wouldn't rush to do so.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,3,0,3,6_WpqKS3qoUkhLVIGadIWg
1230054,2012-08-05,0,F5jwXCeAqHzs-c87sps5gg,"I came here with my fiance while visiting Las Vegas based on the yelp reviews and also not wanting to stuff my face at some AYCE buffet along the strip. 
We got here on a Sunday night around 8 pm and there was only 1 server and a large party already seated. The server acknowledged us right away and sat us pretty quickly. 
We were lucky to have the opportunity to order from the happy hour menu (8 pm til closing) since the pricing seemed pretty good. 

We ordered the edamame ($2) and salad ($2). We also got the calamari steak ($5) and soft shell crab ($5). We also ordered from the 3 items for $12.95 menu (with a purchase of a beverage or a miso soup) with a miso soup ($2), Alaskan roll (salmon and crab roll), spicy tuna roll and spider roll.

I really liked the miso dressing that my salad was served with and the edamame were nice and warm when our server brought it to us. The calamari steak was nicely charbroiled and cut into slices and tasted pretty good. The soft shell crab was actually a pretty good deal for 6 delicious pieces (crisp and not oily at all). All the rolls were really tasty as well, but the only complaint I have is that they were not automatically served with wasabi. This isn't really a bit deal to me since I don't like eating wasabi anyways, but my fiance loved mixing it with his soy sauce and dipping his sushi and sashimi in it (as most people do I would suspect). But we asked for it and it was brought out to us right away. 

For dessert (because there should almost always be a dessert at the end of meal), we tried the fried tempura ice cream (vanilla). I have always wanted to try this when I've seen it at other Japanese restaurants, but never have. This dessert was really sweet and delicious. The tempura went very well with the ice cream and the combination of the warm and cold was very stimulating for the taste buds. A very enjoyable experience and highly recommend ordering it next time you come.

My fiance and I were pretty impressed with the service since it was only one server the night we came and he was running around serving this large party that was in here before us. He was very friendly and very attentive to refilling our water glasses and clearing our our dirty plates. 

Overall, the pricing for this place is pretty reasonable, especially during happy hour (but the pricing for that can add up) and ordering off that 3 for $12.95 menu. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. Who says you have to only dine at AYCE restaurants when visiting Las Vegas?

Special is served with both miso soup and salad.

Sushi quality was decent- fish was fresh and rolls were flavorful and more on the traditional side, but were not rolled very right and as a result a few pieces fell apart. Soups were both flavorful and noodles were a good portion for the dish.

Favorite order was the crispy rice. I'd come back and get two or three orders as a meal, which for a dollar a piece isn't bad pricing. Pieces are large enough to be a couple of bites each, too.

2289845,2011-11-24,1,F5jwXCeAqHzs-c87sps5gg,"I waffled between 3 and 4 stars throughout the meal.  What made me go with 4 is the excellent service and the honey toast.  Loves me some honey toast!

We tried the garlic edamame, beef tataki, spicy tuna over crispy rice, agedashi tofu, chicken yakitori, spicy albacore roll, and honey toast.  The garlic edamame was covered in slices of garlic, so you either got a ton of garlic or a vague garlic flavor.  I like the garlic edamame at Sen of Japan and Nagoya better where they actually finely chopped the garlic.  A more consistent flavor.  The tofu, yakitori, and spicy albacore were average.

The spicy tuna over crispy rice was definitely a standout.  My husband ordered this without consulting me and I tried this dish for the first time at Simon a while back and was not impressed.  This was totally different.  The rice was crispy and light, not chewy and dense like Simon.  I definitely recommend getting this.

As we finished our meal, I kept hearing our server recommend honey toast for dessert to other tables.  I love honey toast at Ichiza and I got all excited.  We ordered it but when I saw it delivered to other tables I was worried.  It has whipped cream on it... and is that chocolate sauce?  But it was the best honey toast ever!  Not as messy, burnt, or awkward as the Ichiza honey toast.  You can eat every bite with a spoon, including the toast.  The chocolate sauce tasted great and there is enough ice cream to go with each bite of toast.  Yummy!

Happy hour is from 8-close when they offer food, beer, and sake for $2-4.  They also have a menu throughout the day where they offer a list of items at 3 for $12.95.  The HH menu and the $12.95 menu overlap and depending on what you order, it could be a better deal to order off the HH menu or the $12.95 menu.  This requires some advanced math skills and is just not my thing.  Also, it reminds me of Applebee's, which is never a good thing.  (Has anyone noticed they sell the same thing in 10 different combinations at 10 different prices at Applebee's?  It's annoying.)  But then again, if I end up spending $2 more because I can't do math, so be it.

Satoya is worth 5 stars, though.

As a tuna (maguro) connoisseur, it's a kihada (yellowfin);  however, very good quality.

Every other cooking was exquisite and finely done, and has originality.

Their creamy rock shrimp and the tofu steak was awesome!

My wife ordered the grilled Calamari Steak/Squid. I felt that the Tonkatsu & Saba Shioyaki were tasty and my wife felt the same about her grilled Calamari. 

We really liked the service, the waitress was very attentive, friendly & polite.

Sato-ya was one of those places that we visited a long time ago, but because of a cockroach problem, we never returned.  Assuming that they changed their ways based on the current reviews, we went by the other day and sat at the sushi bar for a late dinner (8pm).  We ordered quite a bit of nigiri and some appetizers.  All were priced well and were great portions.  

Creamy rock shrimp: Yummy in the tummy.  It's definitely creamy, a bit spicy, and the shrimp is sweet.  I loved every bite.  It was like firecracker shrimp but better.

Tempura roll: Perfect.  Theirs has cucumber, avocado, shrimp, and spicy mayo.  It wasn't drenched in anything.  I loved it. 

All the nigiri was portioned well and the rice for the sushi is AWESOME.  It reminds me of Sugarfish in LA.  The fish is tempered right, too.  Man oh man.  I love this place.

Then, out of nowhere I was struck in the heart by several small roaches approaching me from the corner of the sushi bar.  I look up, and there they are--a literal infestation hanging out between the wood of the bar, crawling out along the wall and the counter.  What concerns me is the amount of roaches, the fact that they are baby ones, and the fact that there are black dots of bug feces where they were coming out of.  

We hadn't received our entire order, and at that point it was difficult to swallow--literally.  We paid and then told the server on the way out of the problem.  I posted a pic of one little roachy on the sushi bar on their yelp profile.  I hope they fix this.

If there's one thing I cannot handle no matter where it's located in a restaurant, are bugs, and for the roaches to crawl out on to my plates, I don't think I can go back.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,6,1,3,KRyG_zpU9AzONnGJ7EpYbw

3368714,2013-11-17,0,F5jwXCeAqHzs-c87sps5gg,"We found Satoya through Yelp. They are located in a strip mall on Sahara and Rainbow - the location was nothing to write home about, but surprisingly, the food was authentic and delicious (the owners, chefs and servers are actually Japanese unlike so many Japanese restaurants nowadays), the service was very good, and the price was ridiculously affordable. They have a good menu flanked by a $19.99 all you can eat sushi roll offering that also included kitchen-made items such as yakitori, edamame and other small eats - amazing deal.

Now this is a little known secret: they will actually cater for your party on Saturday & Sunday lunchtime, and anytime on Mondays. For our baby girl's first birthday, we threw a party at our house and contracted Satoya to prepare sushi for 70 of our guests. They brought their own equipment and ingredients, and was able to take and prepare custom orders from all of our guests. Well the food they prepared was a big hit with my guests, and they provided excellent service to everyone. They even stayed behind to help clean-up the house (so not their responsibility)!

I have returned several times since and have always been impressed by their food and service. 

p.s. Satoya is owned and run by the nicest family from Okinawa. I just found out yesterday that if you ask for authentic Okinawa cuisine (apparently it's like island food, similar to Hawaiian cuisine), they will prepare it for you (not sure if it's on the menu?). I'm looking forward to trying that!",2T1lGCe4C6Yrhe3s3Qqulg,5,3,5,l_z4YhqNqAlbB0jRUh6dHw

First and foremost the service was great. Our server and the sushi chef were both attentive and informative. But that doesn't come close to making up for the food...

We ordered two of the 14.95$ deals. They came with a Nevada Roll, Alaskan roll, white tiger roll, calamari steak, crunchy rice with spicy tuna, and baked mussels. The only thing I found edible was the white tiger roll. Everything else I couldn't even attempt to eat. The Nevada Roll was soggy and the Alaskan roll was drenched in mayonnaise. The calamari steak was so rubbery and the baked mussels weren't even warm... They too were rubbery.

First of all, I think all the people who work there are family...there is a super nice sushi chef who works two days a week who is not family but I'm pretty sure the hostess, the regular sushi chef and the waiters are all related. The waiters are always very attentive, friendly, and remember my drink order each time I go. 

Anyway, the $12 special is outstanding. 3 huge roles of sushi for 12 bucks. Great selection of choices for the rolls, the sushi is fresh, its authentic and there's just something... there's care put into the making of each roll.

I need to branch out and try some of the more exotic items on the menu and really want to be there for the twice monthly Okinawa night...

One thing I will say is that each time I've been, the other diners were Japanese - which says alot for a Japanese restaurant right?

The sushi was good, but not the best we have had in Las Vegas.  But don't take this as a negative because places that have great sushi don't have home-style Japanese food.

I entered Sato-ya and sat at the sushi bar.  Chef Sato greeted me and explained that ""ya"" means house so essentially I was eating in his ""home.""  That sounded nice already!  The window of the restaurant has a flat screen showcasing their food (pretty cool).

Inside there were specials listed.  I immediately noticed the Aji (Spanish Mackerel) and ordered it first.  Chef Sato did something Teri C. would appreciate - he carefully placed ginger and scallion on the fish with a long chopstick.  The Aji was awesome, so I next ordered shimesaba (Japanese mackerel).  The chef was surprised - an American likes mackerel this much??? ahh yes I am weird.  The saba was delicately cured, moist, and perfect, topped with a piece of kelp.  

I also enjoyed agedashi tofu (good broth, crisp on outside, soft on inside, daikon and scallion) and endless hot tea as my comfort on the cool night.  Green hot tea is FREE and unlimited!  (free edamame too) Next I ordered yellowtail, and immediately noticed Chef Sato gave me belly cuts.  I thanked him and he smiled, noting that I liked fatty and oily fish so he gave me the best cut.  A regular joined me at the bar and talked about the great food.

Then I had a salmon skin handroll (on special as well) complete with gobo root, bonito flake, and kaiware sprouts.  It was a bit small but less than $3.  Chef Sato blowtorched whole scallop sushi for me.  He left the abductor muscle on, so I removed it (that only seems to happen at Japanese establishments and not Korean-owned).  He topped it with yuzu pepper - a zingy heat for sure!  I finished the meal with uni, and it was succulent and fresh.  

They had the Wednesday night college football game on, Chef Sato taught me some Japanese, and a couple at a nearby table just moved back to LV from Okinawa and were telling me about Japan.  Before I left, four Japanese friends sat at the bar.  The lady gave me suggestions for my honeymoon in Japan and told me Sato-ya is her favorite authentic place in town.

They were very accommodating and helpful. It really felt like you were in their home. Except for the paying part.

The prices were certainly pocket-friendly though. For about $13, you get to choose three items from a specials menu. That's pretty good for three rolls of sushi (or a combination of sushi and other kitchen items). Toward the end of the meal, we were curious about the Mozuku that was written on their specials board.

5390816,2012-10-17,1,F5jwXCeAqHzs-c87sps5gg,"I've been to Satoya twice now for takeout, and I have to report they are extremely takeout averse.  This isn't to say the service is rude as every employee I've encountered is extremely friendly, but they clearly don't handle a lot of takeout orders or have simply chosen to not cater those of us who have no friends and whose worst fear is to end up on http://table-for-1.tumblr.com/   

The first time was a while back and I ordered one of the lunch specials and an iced green tea.   When I arrived they apologized profusely as they handed me a takeout soup container filled to the brim with tea.  If you've seen my Veggie House review you know this just happened to me there as well.  Is there a shortage of take-out drink cups in the valley or are they crazily expensive or something?  Anyway, I figured it was because at that point they hadn't been open for quite a long time, and the food was fine but not being prepared for such an order makes me feel almost like an inconvenience to them, like maybe they don't want to do these orders (and I NEED my tea).   Fast forward over a year and I was in the mood for sushi at lunch, and still being friendless (in all seriousness I only get 30 minutes, so dine in lunches are almost an impossibility unless I plan for it), I ordered a Sashimi lunch special and again asked for an Iced Tea to go.

When I arrived the waitress said it was ready, but she apologized for not being able to provide me with tea and instead offered me a presumably canned coke/soda instead.  She also explained that the items that come with the lunch special (this one was supposed to come with salad and an Udon soup) were not applicable to takeout.  Let me summarize:  1)  They still haven't purchased to go cups   2) They cannot place a salad into a to-go box   3)  They can't give me the udon soup (maybe they ran out of all the big soup containers for iced tea orders like mine).   She did seem like she felt bad and offered me the opportunity to eat there which I almost accepted so I could get the full value of the meal, but I figured I should head back to work and I swung by starbucks to get myself some tea.   If I was annoyed at anything I thought that maybe they should have let me know of all the limitations over the phone and before I drove there, but I sincerely get the feeling they just don't receive a lot of to-go orders and simply aren't prepared for how to handle it.

Boy this is like the War and Peace of Yelp reviews and I havent even mentioned the food itself.  So the Sashimi and Rice I got were very good, enough for me to still give 3 stars.  There were 2 pieces each of 5 different fish (Salmon, Tuna, Octopus, whitefish and Yellowtail I believe) and they all seemed fresh and flavorful.  

I can't say I personally got a great value compared to other Sushi restaurants given the lack of soup and salad (no seriously, they can't box up the salad?!), but I was still happy with the quality of the fish enough to not completely avoid them in the future.

They have AYCE during the evening hours with a limited variety of rolls to pic, but there is other things on the AYCE menu as well like  tofu, yakkitori, beef, edamame, peppers, salad, miso,  I personally dont care for AYCE rolls but my friends love them.  They have another menu that involves picking 3 items+soup&salad for about 14.95 from a list. This includes many rolls, to a 3 piece nigiri, chicken karage, okinawa soba noodles, fried rice and many others.   There are many lunch specials for around $7-10 . The service truly shines here.  They are attentive, polite and always greet you with a smile. A true family owned business that treats everyone wonderfully. Also they have a decent selection of beer and the honey toast desert is very delicious.",O3YQ-duvblWvA5CY8J508A,0,0,5,yJaTQtO9OpkDgkOFNXWyaQ

We ended up grabbing a late dinner and they have happy hour from 8-close everyday with items ranging from $2-$5 on selected items.  They also have a special that goes on for dinner where you can choose 3 items (hot dishes and sushi rolls) for $12.95 with the purchase of miso ($2) or a beverage ($1-2 for iced tea/soda).   We ended up trying the katsu skewers, rock shrimp tempura, crispy rice tuna, chicken kaarage, fried rice, and crunchy california roll.  Everything was pretty tasty, the only hang up I had was the crispiness of the kaarage, some of the batter/coating was coming off of the chicken breast pieces, but I must say the chicken was very moist.  I don't generally do fried rice since it seems to Americanized to me, but the fried rice is pretty awesome in flavor with some sprinkled seaweed in the mix.  And for dessert we had the honey toast with ice cream...I honestly like this honey toast better than Ichiza's...the correct bread to ice cream ratio was present with a drizzle of chocolate =)....very nicely presented.  The service was great...they came to check on us throughout the meal even though the restaurant was fairly busy due to a graduation party.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,0,0,4,Ep8jeoOUPAXhxJ2kCU_niw

After reading Lisa L & Tony T's reviews, I decided to try this place right away... I absolutely trust their taste of food :)  I am very pleased to find this cozy place run by a nice Japanese family that I can enjoy the tasty Japanese dishes all the time.
First of all, the service is fantastic!!! The servers are very attentive, always smile, and knowledgeable about the menu. 
Whenever, I am at this place, most of the customers are the local Japanese. They casually dine at the sushi bar and seems like they all enjoy having a conversation with a sushi chef, Sato :) They always talk quietly... 

I have tried.. 
asari miso soup(not salty at all, tasty clams were served in the soup), assorted sashimi dinner entree, all kinds of nigiris(very fresh), Japanese ceviche(if you like the taste of citrus ponzu, you will like it), crispy rice with spicy tuna(well blended taste of mayo spicy tuna & sliced jalapenos on top of crunch rice,, It's so delicious that  I always end up ordering more), spicy muscle roll(one of my favorite rolls), saba nitsuke(makerel seasoning with sake & dark soy sauce,,able to taste of sweetness & ginger,,love it!), seared tuna sashimi with salsa(the salsa was the bomb-avocado, red onion, tomato, cucumber & the chef's secret sauce), nabeyaki udon(the broth was really good), the lunch box, and more. 
I definitely can say it is a great local Japanese restaurant that you can quietly enjoy your meal with your company or by yourself at any time of the day.",h0wxG2EiDLhgKjIzI8j2Mg,15,12,4,H2LuXzV6pg1rz9bb4CP9ZQ

The owners/operators are very nice and accommodating, from Okinawa and brings that culture to the restaurant and food they serve.  One of the things to be sure to experience is one of their Okinawa Nights where they have most of the traditional Okinawan foods and of course Orion beer.  

I've had a few of the sushi rolls, and although I haven't gone there specifically for those I have been impressed with the taste and presentation of it all.",WqRUKubibQDY8rSgIRazjw,0,0,5,H8dGpTvT0GdTtYBG6ExJEw

5736897,2011-08-28,0,F5jwXCeAqHzs-c87sps5gg,"Satoya is really a hidden Gem in Las Vegas. Japanese owned and operated. The provide fantastic service delicios food and great entertainment ( yes entertainment) at a very reasonable price.

What makes Satoya unique is that the Owners are from the Okinawa Islands of Japan. Along with all of your traditional Japanese style favorites ( sushi, Sashimi, Rolls, Grilled food etc) They also have a select menu of traditional OKinawan Food.

These Okinawan foods are hard to find (impossible??) in the Las Vegas area and we were pleased when we discovered that they had such Okinawa Specialites as Okinawa Soki Soba, Taco Rice, Goya Chanpuru, Somen Chanpuru, Rafuty and more!

What REALLY makes this place great is that they have Video screens with scenes of the Okinawan islands Showing , and relaxing Okinawan style folk music playing in the background.

When we were they actually had a live Shamisen performer playing quietly in the background while we ate. It really gave us the feeling of being in Japan, or Okinawa. I asked the waitress about the Shamisen player and she told me that the have a live performance every 2nd and 4th friday, 3 times nightly! I guess this guy (the shamisen or Sanshin player ) is pretty famous and travels back and forth to Okinawa alot

FOOD we ordered a variety of food from sushi to grilled to noodles, and it was all WONDERFUL
Our only complaint is that we couldnt stay as long as we would have liked, because o f an early morning flight the next day !",q6ShBpgwKGyXoM24wPuSyg,2,0,5,g8ieM96B-xS85-wXIwcwsw
5918729,2010-09-23,5,F5jwXCeAqHzs-c87sps5gg,"I was on my way to try Thai food from Archi's after an earlier appointment, however as I drove past the intersection of Rainbow and Sahara and looking for the name of a Japanese restaurant that I have wanted to try but somehow never did, I noticed that it has been replaced with a new Japanese restaurant and a big Grand Opening banner.  This restaurant is Sato-Ya.

It is literally a family run business that has the dad working at the sushi bar, the mom and other Japanese cooks working in the kitchen and I believe the son running the front as the waiter and cashier.

I decided to try their lunch combo and picked Yakiniku and Pork Cutlet and also Salmon Roll out of the available options.  A House Salad dressed in Miso dressing was quickly served (it was nice but a little too much dressing, as there were still a lot left after I was done with the greens).  The Miso Soup followed shortly and it is comforting.  After a short wait the main entree was delivered to the table, which I took pictures of, but have to quickly devour so I can be on time for my next appointment.  The Yakiniku was okay. It tastes fine, but the thin slices of beef was overcooked for my taste, but the tonkatsu was good.

While I waited for my meal to be prepared I also checked out their dinner menu, which has a larger selection and also a Dinner Special section.  They also have Happy Hour from 8pm until they close at 10:30pm, which serves 1/2 items from the HH menu.

The thing I was most impressed with is the fact that it is actually run by Japanese, and not Koreans, Chinese or other ethnicity, and in a subtle way you can taste the difference if you know what to look for.  Not that there is anything inherently wrong with those other Japanese restaurants, but when you are looking for pure Japanese, especially with an Okinawan flavor, Sato-Ya is the place to be.

Plus the service was impeccable.  The waiter checked on all the tables to make sure we were okay, and bring out whatever we ask (more water, tea, etc.) in a timely manner.  And when you pay your bill and is on your way out, he walks quickly ahead and opens the dorr for you.  Now you don't see that everyday, and certainly not at a non-Michelin Star restaurant.

I will definitely be back soon to try more of their menu.  So stay tuned for the updates and the photos of the menu and the food to be uploaded after my class.

4 Stars for the overall dining experience, especially on the account of the superb service.

-- Review of Dinner on 9-22-10 --
Leos called me about doing dinner at a new Japanese restaurant, and it turned out to be Sato-ya, where I ate lunch earlier in the day.  So we agreed to go after our class, and I can check out their other items.  We ordered off their HH & Daily Specials menu and also an Okinawa Soba Noodle (looks like udon, but tastes different, and the meat is really tender) and I thought it was good.

Albacore - good and expert attention was applied.
Goyo Chanpuru - Okinawan Bitter Melon sauteed with Spam and egg. Homey and I enjoyed it.
Futomaki - A little different from what I have had (no spinach), but still good.
Chicken Tatsuta-age - Fried marinated chicken breasts. Alright.
Crispy Rice w/ Spicy Tuna - Sushi rice that is fried so it is crispy topped with spicy tuna.  Different from your typical sushi places. Reminds us of MOS Burger items.

We spoke to the owner and sushi chef ""Habu"" (a poisonous snake in Okinawa) and you can tell he is very passionate and an artisen in his craft.  Totally cool in my book! And he made a decorative Japanese Stork (C. Boyciana) out of 1/2 an orange! Plus showed us his avocado seed carvings!!! - again didn't know you can do that.  I eat at a lot of AYCE sushi places, but you almost never get that kind of connection with those sushi chef like we did with Chef ""Habu"".

We will be back for more.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,13,15,4,z2-qwie2ez0IpLETRkpDQg
