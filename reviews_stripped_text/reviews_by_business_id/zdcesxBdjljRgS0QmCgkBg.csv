19412,2009-08-27,0,zdcesxBdjljRgS0QmCgkBg,"I've been looking for a good Jewish Deli since I moved to Las Vegas. I picked up a friend from the Airport and he told me that we had to try this deli, so off to Bagelmania we went. 

When we walked in (around 11am) it was pretty busy. There were only a few open tables, and we were promptly seated. We ordered the whitefish salad appetizer and it was GREAT. I haven't had smoked whitefish salad like this since I lived in Chicago. Served with a bagel or your choice, and dill pickles, it was all very tasty! Paired with a Dr. Brown's Black Cherry soda, how could you go wrong?!?!?!?! 

Next came the Lox, Eggs, and Onions, served with Home Fries. Just like grandma used to make (jk). The servings are a good size and the atmosphere is very casual. The bagels are the best bagels I've found in Las Vegas. My friend ordered some Rugala to go to snack on in his hotel room later on. We had to break into it just to have a taste and they were very good. 

They have all kinds of meats, cheeses, salads, and desserts available for quick carry out. If you're looking for a great Authentic Jewish Deli in Las Vegas, this is the place to go. They are open 7 days a week, but only until 3pm.",C-CXKQqKuiHWRmnGsfWZIA,0,0,4,2yrzJzGRc42YL0NQjOD3xw

112045,2015-01-24,0,zdcesxBdjljRgS0QmCgkBg,"Many of their dishes are made from scratch, ingredients are generally-speaking fresh. Best nova lox you can get without going to a high-end eatery. Essentially you are going for the food and nothing else. 

Service and prep are ABYSMAL. As my party puts it, ""there is an issue every time."" The customer will principally deal with this middle-aged, portly blonde woman that works the counter who is weary of her surroundings, humorless, and completely devoid of personality. I have yet to be waited on by anyone else. It takes her forever to ring up an order, details need to be confirmed and re-confirmed to ensure she's understanding you, and sizes/portions may still be wrong. She is not proficient with the credit card swiper and seems borderline offended that anyone would even vaguely consider paying that way. Suggestions emerge as gentle nudges, pushing you into food specials that actually cost more to the customer thanks to their portioning. When you get your food, assuming you ordered a bagel, the cream cheese is slathered on so haphazardly that its spread is reminiscent of the Ocean Spray logo. You actually need to re-do the work of the line cook and spread it again. 

Prices are disgusting. $10-15 after taxes for a bagel and lox (more expensive than NY, NY which is FAR better). $2.60 for a 10-12 oz beverage. Fountain drinks? Obligatory largest size. Good luck fitting it in your cupholder. Come on.",GYeVZ9FmWKw1JjBUA8InCA,0,0,3,tq-MiMAMxdUEMeiEhLBFWA

185495,2010-04-28,1,zdcesxBdjljRgS0QmCgkBg,"In another life, I was probably born Jewish. I went through a phase growing up when I was obsessed with bagels, lox, etc. Hell, I even studied the violin for 13+ years. Harrie's helped reunite me with my long lost (and imagined) Jewish identity while i did my stint out in LV.

Harrie's, as others have said, is a tradition in LV. For me, it was a Saturday morning late breakfast with either their hash or 2 eggs sunny side up all served with a warm toasted bagel of your choice and some cream cheese on the side. The coffee wasn't the best, but who cared? I was sitting here for a chance glimpse of the Elvis impersonator driving up in his silver Chrysler Sebring. It's more about the ambience here. This is old Las Vegas, folks. Good hearty NY style deli food with cheery people who love the city and treat the customers right.

Yes, they make their own bagels. When you go towards the back, you'll see the bags of flour and the mixing machines through the kitchen doorway. And they make a killer bialy too. The prices are good too. There's a breakfast special on the weekdays - can't recall how much, but it won't run you more than $5 for 2 eggs any style, some meat, a bagel and a coffee. Why sit in a generic Denny's or Blueberry Hill restaurant when you can just relax and feel at home here at Harrie's?

5 stars for ambience and service, 3.5 - 4 stars for food. I like the bialy the best. Reconnect with your love for bagels...and give Harrie's a try. If you see Elvis, take a picture for me. Thank you, thank you very much.",v2C4S11PHzLEXKeF5kvTJA,4,4,4,R5qQSRcVRUxPz3_v1OHWKQ

Despite being a deli, they offer sitdown service.  One entree that I enjoyed was their Three Fer plate: knish, potato pancake and a blintz.  It comes with sour cream and apple sauce on the side.  On my recent trip, I had the kasha knish.  They also offer a knish with potatos or meat.

The fact that it is in a ghetto is scary, even in daylight, but the reward of a good bagel made me forget about the neighborhood. Each time I went there, I took advantage of the Tuesday special. The first time they only had three ET's (my favorite), so I had to add a few others to round out the dozen. I was told that you can get exactly the mix you want if you call on Monday. So I call on Monday and order 12 Whole Wheat ET bagels. They said that this was a special order and I would have to prepay it (cash). I was told I would still get the Tuesday special price. So my wife drives 30 minutes to prepay the special price and is informed that it is a special order and the Tueday price does not apply. She then drives 30 minutes back home. I drove on Tuesday to pick up the order and asked why I was required to pay the normal price, because 'special orders' are not included in the special price, that is their policy (even though their facebook page say ALL bagels are cheaper on Tuesday) .
Okay, That is their policy. I am new in town and I must learn these things. The third time I ordered 9 Whole Wheat and 3 Bialys. The WW bagels were good and I added my own 'everything mix' to them. The bialys were rolls shaped like real bialys with a dab of onion in the center, nothing like Kossar's Bialys!

The fourth time I placed an order the owner took my order, name and phone number, as was usual. What was unusual is that they did not have the order ready when I got there, so I just told the clerk, ""just give me 12 Whole Wheat"". She opens the bag and is intercepted by the owner who says, ""No bagels for him"". The owner then tells me she has the right to refuse service to any undesirable customers. ""I refuse service to you. Goodbye"" I asked why and she said I insulted her help (which I would never do).

I left, never to return. If she wanted to refuse service to me, why did she take the order? She could have saved me an hour trip. She wanted to inconvenience me.

Been to vegas for a conference and early morning was starving for some warm bagels and coffee. Harrie's Bagelmania was just the right place. Good location. Close to the strip. Cozy deli and warm service. 

We had the Jalepeno bagel and french toast. Both arrived quickly and were delicious. I loved the fact that all their cream cheeses are lite. Our server was very warm and prompt. 

The only negative was that the billing was very old fashioned. We had to give the lady our email address or phone number to get a copy of the receipt. Sort of dated that way.

pretty big menu of deli/diner selections, lots of omelets, scrambles, sandwiches, salads, soups, etc. i had the corned beef hash and eggs, which came with breakfast potatoes and a bagel w/cream cheese. food was served piping hot and was outstanding. hash was tasty and not overloaded with grease as can happen.

had an onion bagel, tasted as ""east coast"" as i've had on the west coast. for a frame of reference, my favorite ny bagels are h&h... not sure how native new yorkers would rate those, but i love 'em. absolutely hate noah's bagels. can't wait to dig into the plain (always a measure of how good a bagel joint is) and the bialy i brought home.

highly recommend harrie's for a casual, off strip breakfast or lunch with a decidedly local flavor. i'm disappointed i hadn't heard of this place sooner... it will be a must visit whenever i'm in lv.

If you are a bagel lover, then come here because they have the most amazing bagels of every kind. My personal favorite is the toasted everything bagel. Even better.. a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese and nova (less salty version of lox, equally as delicious).

Since I come here just about every weekend now, I've settled on some personal favorites and routine breakfast items that I will order: the chicken in a pot (chicken noodle soup with your choice of a dark/white meat portion of chicken, meat kreplach, and a matzo ball) -- chicken noodle soup in general is so basic but it is so delicious and packed with flavor here! It is a Saturday special only, but i make sure to come on Saturdays just so I don't miss out. My other favorite item is the meat knish which my bf loves as well (we used to order 1 for the both of us but now my gluttonous self demands a whole thing for myself)-- not sure how else to explain what this is, but it is similar to an empanada with ground meat.

I thought the bagels were about as good as grocery store bagels i.e. doughy and bland. I was hoping for real deli food like good pickles and potato salad but the potato salad was worse than the bagel. My travel companions were equally disappointed. I ordered lox cream cheese on a sesame bagel and if I had not been so hungry, may have given it away. 

Also, the woman behind the counter left our bagels sitting on the counter while she helped several other people who were ordering. By the time they shouted our order, my brother was done with his bagel and mine was cold.

Let me set up our story:
I am a lover of NY knish...yep even the square ones you can find at a dog stand. And hubby is Jewish from SF. First generation American.
Together we are a dangerous bagel seeking, knish seeking, lattke seeking pair of weirdos. I guess we expect the lattkes to be like his 90 year old grandmas and the knish to resemble something his Israeli family could whip up. Bagels? I guess we expect ones you can find in SF and NY.

This place has none of the above.

The service was bad from the get go and I ignored it because I was excited to find a place like this.

I immediately ordered a knish to start with and it came...huge...weird old dough and skin on chunky potatoes inside. It seemed microwaved. And I kept tasting it and trying to find hints of caramelized onion or leeks...nope...some onion powder at most.

Next I ordered a potato pancake (as they called it) and of course we expected a lattke. Nope. Seemed also microwaved and it looked like my old college day salmon patty I used to whip up and bake. Basically it was the texture of a ground veggie burger. 

Ok. Now for the bagels. Hubby ordered egg whites and tomato on a garlic bagel. I ordered Nova and an everything bagel it came platter style with cream cheese, red onion and tomato. His bagel was hard and it had dried garlic flakes on it. My everything bagel (I requested non toasted) was also hard and seeds and flakes were burnt on the top.

We sat in silence and I ate my room temperature Nova and he ate half his sandwich. The server lady kept giving me the stink eye and I thought I was just imagining things but hubby said something when we went to the car lol.

So for the crappy coffee and stale food that we took mere bites of...we paid our $32 bill plus a tip at 9am and never looked back.

Honestly, I guess we just expected waaaaay more than day old tasting items.

I had the apple cinnamon bagel with the cinnamon cream cheese and it was a great pair. The cream cheese wasn't too sweet either (as I've tried their strawberry cream cheese = MY FAVE before). I know that when I go to Einstein bagels or something, the cream cheese is extremely sweet.

It's on Twain, the road that runs between Wynn/Encore and Venetian/Palazzo, and it's not too far from them, maybe about a mile to the east. 

Just yesterday, I had two of the most delicious everything bagels, toasted, covered on top with crispy onions. And I had them with jalapeno cream cheese. There was so much yummy cream cheese, dripping out all sides, that I had to finish the cream cheese up off the plate using a fork.

And for this prices were very reasonable, about $3.25 per bagel with cream cheese.

The menu is quite reminiscent of a NY Jewish deli. In the past I've had pastrami sandwiches, chicken salad sandwiches, tuna fish on bagel, corned beef sandwiches, potato salad, cheesecake. All delish. And you can take deli meats home by the pound or bagels home by the dozen. The current Tuesday special is, I believe, a dozen bagels to-go for about $6.50.

In addition to the bagels, which were great, I tried the $10 Hoppel Poppel.  It's a mix of breakfast foods:  scrambled eggs, hash browns, salami, green peppers and onions.  The serving was gigantic and easily shared.

I have been coming to Harries Baglemania for about 10 years now, every April.  It was the first great Jewish Deli that I found in Las Vegas.  In my most recent trip, I saw that the old woman was no longer at the place.  I placed a simple order - a bagel lox and cream cheese, and a chicken soup - both always fantastic from Harries Baglemania.  Upon arriving back at my hotel, I discovered that there was no lox on the bagel, but lox spread.  I drove back to Harries, and they apologized, and replaced the sandwich.  Upon return to the hotel, we discovered that they were not using Nova Lox, but very salty plain lox (smoked salmon) which did not taste good (and was certainly not traditional).  In addition, the chicken soup was not using a real boiled chicken. I could clearly see that there were ""chicken cubes"" that looked like prepared chicken from a food service, as opposed to ""grandma boiling up the chicken in the back of the store"".   The fact that Harries was (and still is) a dump is part of the charm, if you are familiar with the old NY Jewish Deli's in New York (there are no ""nice looking"" real NY Deli's - they were all dumps, all built from struggling families) - but unfortunately, the ""love"" in the preparation of the food is no longer there. It's just a business for someone new.  With places like Bagel Cafe, and Canters both in Las Vegas, I will unfortunately be bringing my business elsewhere in the future.",tCXNh1l3zAa2essK5X8R7g,3,0,1,UaDQAzp9gbRPJTTCPAMeQA

Portions are generous and good-quality product results in surprisingly high prices: my bagel sandwich with lox set me back an absurd $15. I will say that it was loaded with a lot of lox, but maybe normal portions and prices would be more appealing... Other than that, the bagel itself was underwhelming, toasted to a hardness that was difficult to bite into, and just wasn't particularly flavorful aside from the toppings.

Bagels are available in individually or in bulk, toasted or not, with or without schmear and other toppings. Shop only offers choices of regular or scallion cream cheese.

(Don't let that fool you... they do not have a giant selection of omelets, although you could specify ingredients to create a custom dish.)   When the plate arrived, I looked down to see a rather large portioned omelet that was stiff, fairly hard, smooth sided, compacted and in the shape of a triangle.  I immediately compared it to the looks of a tan colored cranberry scone.  There was no evidence of a yellow or egg whites.  It was all overcooked and brown.  If it wasn't for the triangular shape i'd say it looked like it was baked too long in a shoe.  yes, the texture while eating it was exactly as it looked.  Rubbery and flakey. Brown.  The omelet came with a bagel and diced potatoes.  The bagel:  Nothing special AT ALL.  It's not like you are going to Einstein's bagels or anywhere of that caliber.  It was not extra tasty or extra large.  I was surprised at that for a bagel shop!!  I usually love hash browns or other types of breakfast potatoes.  Not this time.  These diced potatoes were mushy and sticky in a weird kind of way.  Like warmed mashed potatoes that were cubed, and that stick to the roof of my mouth like peanut butter, but not as bad as peanut butter.  it was just weird. I'm sure that this was the first time in 30 years that I did not finish my breakfast potatoes.  It was only after I got my bill that I found out that the cheese that my waitress suggested (""what kind of cheese do you want on your omelet?) that I found it that the cheese was $1.50.  I wouldn't have ordered the cheese at all if I had known it was extra.  Here is what breakfast cost me (for myself):  Pastrami omelet:  $10.99, cheese: $1.50, Milk, 20 oz:  $2.75.  With tax my total bill was $16.48 not counting a tip.  If the pastrami omelet was not the most expensive item on the menu, it was right up there.  So yes, you could very easily get your entrée $3 cheaper.  I would not recommend this place, because although it was unusual to have an pastrami omelet, it, and the rest of the meal, did not taste special at all.

We order breakfast from here, for my work, when we have large meetings.  Everyone always requests this place and we order the simplest thing:

-Bagel Breakfast Sandwich: egg, cheese (some sort of meat: bacon, sausage or ham) on a plain bagel.  That is it!

The eggs is cooked perfectly: like a fried egg and the yolk is just barely runny so all the flavors of the egg, cheese, meat and bagel dance on your tongue.  YUM!

Believe this: this sandwich is even good COLD!  We had lots of leftovers and people were eating them for lunch cold.  Cold egg?  Uh yeah, its good on this sandwich.  (I would NEVER eat a Egg McMuffin cold, but this shiz is for real!)

Their bagels are exactly what I look for in a bagel: moist, a little chewy and delicious flavor.  I have only had the plain bagel and if its that good, I can only imagine how good everything else is.

(after i ate two halves: one for breakfast and one for lunch, I gained 2 pounds, but I think it was worth it!!)

Nancy (who I think is married to the owner??) is a doll and always makes sure everything is perfect.  We ordered from here last week:
30 bagel sandwiches and a fruit bowl.  They cut the bagel sandwiches in half and I swear everyone ate at least 3 halves!  The total was around $193 (included tax and delivery) and she took a check.

Now this is hearsay, but a lot of the people in my office have come here for breakfast and have said how they INHALED all of their food, because its that good!

After this morning, We will never set foot in this establishment again. I would have recommended it before to friends and family but not after this morning.

I ordered the 3 eggs with I thought the hash browns and a side of fruit.
My mom ordered the BLT with a side of hash browns and extra mayo.

I received my eggs and a cup of fruit, when I asked where the hash browns were the waiter informed me that he substituted them with the fruit. I said I wanted the hash browns with a side of fruit. We told him we had no problem paying extra for the hash browns. 

My mother went to eat her hash browns and they were so salty, you wanted to ask if the lid fell off when seasoning the hash browns. Her sandwich consisted of a slice of tomato, one piece of lettuce and about 6 slices of bacon. No mayo... there was a cup on my plate with what looked like mayo (turned out to be butter). 

Then came the tipping point, after eating my eggs (still didn't have my hash browns) I found a light colored hair buried in my fruit cup, of which I only ate 3 grapes. We both lost our appetite. Asked the guy for our check. He brought it over. Okay I ate most of my food so yes I should be charged, my mom barely took a bite out of her food. And they charged us $27.20. With what we ordered that is a very reasonable price. We didn't have a problem with the cost at all. However, the fact that my mom hadn't touched her food was another story. 

So we went up to the registrar to talk to the Nancy. She told my mom that well she played with her food, so she has to pay for it. And I quote ""Those who complain about the food complain about the price"". Again nothing is wrong with their prices. So I asked if they charged extra for the hair in my fruit. She said there was no hair in your fruit. If their was it was your. Okay, so I have brown almost black hair and my mom has auburn hair. Neither of us have light hair.

The menu said it came with either a plain or onion bialy, but the waitress asked what kind of bagel I wanted so I got an everything bagel.

The city's biggest movers and shakers have called this place home.  Burton Cohen was here every day for decades and I even found Siegfried having breakfast in the place.  Some things never change, such as, the grill is the size of a postage stamp.  I have felt sorry for the guys who have to work that grill and get the food out when the place is packed on the weekend.  So, don't be surprised that your eggs and potato pancakes might be a bit on the well done side because they've got that grill turned up too high.  The homemade soups are very good, as are the specials, cookies, fish etc.  However, the bagels and bialys are sublime!  I've eaten N.Y. bagels and I have bought bialys from Kossar's.  The Bagelmania bagels are just as good as the best N.Y. bagels, and Harrie's bialys are BETTER THAN KOSSAR'S!  There is no comparison.  So, if you want the best bagels in Las Vegas and the best bialys in the U.S., go to Harrie's.  The only reason I am giving them four not five stars is due to the grill being so darn small.

The bagels have high gluten and a thick chewy crust, just like they are supposed to. Too crunchy though. If you leave them out for any bit of time in the desert air they become very hard very quickly. This place is an old school deli. It reminds me of a bagel deli I used to go in Fort Lauderdale when I lived in Florida.",eO1ZCFWJCZcETr9dfSydRg,1,1,5,SrInHSKRKFTC03kebOHWcw

Now, I never read newspaper tangiibly or online, but I happened to check it and see my request, 8 months later.  The truth is, as everyone can see here, I found kreplach soup in town back in May.  I had not been back to Harrie's since my first trip because whenever I think to go there, it is after their 3 PM closing time.

However, this weekend I felt miserable, and decided the only way to recuperate was to get kreplach soup.  Eric R. and I happened to have planned on lox and bagels for breakfast, so I decided to get a half dozen bagels there too.  I walked in, grabbed a bottled Dr. Brown's black cherry, and at the counter I declared with passion, ""Give me the largest container of kreplach soup you have!""  The lady smiled and pointed to a big to go container, and I waved my hand and exclaimed, ""PERFECT!""

Then I proceeded to order a half dozen bagels for Eric R. and a small cream cheese (he had the Tofutti one in the fridge but I think he really wanted the real deal so I surprised him).  In the end, I came home and had a giant bowl of kreplach soup accompanied by bagel chips, then some lox (aka brain food), whipped out some capers and sliced onion for Eric R., and saved the other half of the soup to get me through today.  A combination of Harrie's kreplach soup, Eric R.'s furnishing me with love and kleenex, and benadryl have nursed me back toward normalcy.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,6,7,4,5WMjfGuDgl4NXM3nFXPsbw

4655115,2015-01-08,5,zdcesxBdjljRgS0QmCgkBg,"I wanted to love Harrie's Bagelmania. I didn't! There is a scarcity of New York style bagel shops in Las Vegas. The only three that I know of are Bagel Cafe (Summerlin), NY Bagels (downtown), and Harrie's Bagelmania. 

 Harrie's Bagelmania is in an economically challenged neighborhood. I was surprised to see the exorbitant prices that are disproportionate to the average income of the area and the highest prices that I have seen a bagel restaurant charge. Nearly $15 for a bagel with lox Sandwich!? Your kidding Me! Nearly $9 for a bagel with egg salad! This is before paying for a beverage. 

  I opted for the bagelwich with a fried egg and ham. This is one of the reasonable priced items on their menu. Interestingly the only style of egg listed was fried. What about scrambled?  I wasn't too crazy about the bagelwich. When I taste a bagel, my expectation is that it is hot and soft. This bagelwich fell short of my expectation. The ham was okay. As far as the coffee it was also okay. 

  I was satisfied with the service. The waitress was on top of my coffee refills at the same that she was pleasant. When I paid the cashier joked over the  change being an unlucky number. I easily rectified that when I left the waitress a tip for good service. 

  I don't love Harrie's Bagelmania. To be honest I left disappointed with the exorbitant pricing and bagelwich that fell short of my expectations yet satisfied with the service. My Harrie's Bagelmania check-ins stop here.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,9,3,pSuklRg3TNUNl4uPKDSFEg

Yes, it's in a ""sketchy"" part of town for some people. So what. Walk in, have a seat, and let them bring you a menu. Service was spot on...I had questions, I got answers without attitude. My food arrived fast. My check didn't arrive until I was just about finished. I like service like that which I consider just right. 

But all that means nothing, what about the food? I had another one of those OMG did I order more than I can eat moments? That bagel was stacked! And it was kinda messy too (which is good and that's NOT a complaint!). And while I thought $1 extra for the capers was a bit pricey....they loaded my bagel up!

Decor wise the place could use a slight facelift, but to be honest I was too busy chowing down to give a dang about decor. They are a bit pricey for my typical lunch and way over the top on calorie counts but if you gotta have lox and bagels, Harrie's Bagelmania has what you need. I will be back!

They have a large menu with all of your east coast deli favorites, made on the premises.

I had the Hoppel Poppel, which, and there is no other way to put this, is an enormous amount of food.  It's home fries with eggs, peppers, onions and salami into a glorious scramble that easily covers the whole plate and could probably cover another one.  It comes with your choice of bagel.  I got an everything bagel toasted, and it comes with a lot of cream cheese.  I didn't finish either my scramble or the cream cheese.  The Hoppel Poppel is good, but when you put some Cholula on it, it becomes great.  The potatoes I don't think were seasoned, but the peppers and salami add a lot.  Also, the salami is fantastic, not greasy at all.  I guess if I have a criticism of this dish, it's the lack of seasoning.  But, adding hot sauce really worked.

I got the wife corned beef with eggs to go.  Her potatoes were not seasoned, but they were cooked well.  Not surprisingly, the order of eggs with corned beef was massive.  Yet another breakfast we couldn't finish.

The comparison is apt, because Langer's is also in a part of town not hitherto known for its culinary excellence.  Also apt, because both places have the same sort of quaint Aunt Enid-like ""sit down and eat, Bubbeleh, you look skin and bones"" type of feel.

But where Langer's has lines down the block and has been designated a cultural heritage site, this place is still somewhat fledgling, although I did see a Bentley and a Maybach during my 20 minute stay on a weekday morning, so surely they aren't far from stardom.

Located in the ever so famous crack alley this place isn't a place you think you would enjoy or have high hopes for outside of yelp just looking in from the outside, but enough about the lovely area this place is actually quite good if you look past the exterior.

I decided I was going to stay and let the food do the talking. I already knew I wanted lox and a bagel. Nova is the less salty version and there's a few options to choose from. I went with the burton 1-2-3, almost like the platter but with less nova. My handsome decided on the three fer. Which has a knish (your choice of meat or potato) a potato pancake, and a cheese blintz. The nova was fresh, not too salty. I had it on an onion bagel with cream cheese. I added capers as my plate didn't come with them. I thoroughly enjoyed my nova and bagel with schmear. The three fer plate was enough for just the two of us to share but we both shared both our plates. The knish was loaded with brisket and the postal pancake was crispy and savory. Our server was friendly and our food came out in good time. I also took home some rugelach. Yes I just googled the spelling. Little pastries with Apple and raspberry filling.

Another time they made me an egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms it was delicious! Plus it came with a bagel and I got fruit instead of home fries, so great options.

And the biali...OH the biali! For those of you unfamiliar with a biali (like I was), it is a type of bread -- similar to a bagel but not as dense-- with tiny minced onions and other delicious flavorings in the center. I've eaten their biali with the chicken salad, with the matzo ball soup, with cream cheese, and by itself...all amazing.
