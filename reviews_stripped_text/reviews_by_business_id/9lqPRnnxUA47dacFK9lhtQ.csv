I've been here many times.  Their butter croissants are out of this world!  They're flaky and layered and just melt in your mouth.  The Italian breakfast sandwich is also very yummy and can be shared.  The ice cream is smooth and creamy.  The muffins were a tad on the dry side but yummy as well.

I handed her my money, when all of a sudden the total jumps to $26 (!). I questioned the mark-up and the on duty manager came over. She verified my order as iced coffees, I said yes, and yet it still got rung up as $26.

Would I go back? YES.

Do not expect a smile when entering. They were not busy as only one person was in line. If you engage them however they won't be rude. Service was fast.

I love Va Bene's modern chic look. I will atest to the chairs not being particularly comfortable, but everything else from sleek marble counters, to the red color scheme, made me want to take a dozen pictures.

I had the Caramel Éclair, Vanilla Tart, and a Caramel Apple Gelato. First of all, the pasteries look gorgeous, and happen to taste just as good. The éclair was heavenly. The gold chocolates on top were not merely decorative(unlike the gold flakes), but tasted like European chocolate. Everything was absolutely delicious top to bottom. The tart was equally as good. The gelato I will continue to crave for eternity. It was tart, and had no strange after taste like one you'd get from artificial flavoring. The caramel was lucious and made for a dense spoonful of bliss.

The most complaints come from it being to expensive, and I'd agree if I could get the same quality desserts from somewhere cheaper. I believe it's still worth trying (I'm only vouching for the sweets!)

All in all, I could eat 7 of those éclairs, and a gallon of their gelato. Service, meh. Definitely a cute little spot to try.",jiFrjBhlVQ5KLddhiNn4LA,0,0,4,Bap3FRtiTr0rZ-G82TqAag

Kale salad, $8 prior to tax- This comes in a 16 oz container, but because I was sick, I asked if it would be possible to have it split into 2 containers. The employee who took my order said she could do that for me (which she did). This salad was really tasty, I especially liked the pomegranate seeds for the added sweetness and the citrus dressing. The kale itself was hearty and fresh tasting. 

My husband liked his portion of salad as well. 

16 oz Mocha, $6.50 prior to tax- I did not have any of my husband's drink but he did like it and thought it tasted like a standard mocha drink.

--------------------------
(Total= $15.67 after tax)

Our transaction was easy and pretty quick. My salad was given to us after we made our order. But for our drink, we had to wait to have it made. One thing that I did not like was that they never said our name or call out the drink name once it was made. The employee who made it just placed it on the counter and walked away (where anyone else could have taken our already paid drink). But because we sat inside (seating is limited, there is also some seating outside), my husband was able to watch so that he could get it as soon as it was ready.

We usually stay at the palazzo when we go in big groups and I'm used to getting a perfect coffee and PERFECT croissant from Bouchon Bakery every morning when I'm in Vegas.

This time around was a smaller group so we opted for the Cosmo. I love this casino... but am VERY disappointed in Va Bene. NON VA BENE.

First, it took me repeating my order multiple multiple times for them to get it all. The drinks were a little complicated but nothing an experienced barista couldn't handle:

Small iced vanilla latte, regular milk, 1/2 the vanilla syrup
Small almond milk cappuccino

This took a little longer than desired but understandable. The 1/2 syrup throws some people... I guess...

Then I said, banana, OJ, plain croissant. THIS was where they got confused. Multiple times.

Then the cashier who was standing right next to the person taking my order and just waiting for me was NOT listening and I had to repeat everything AGAIN for the 10th time to just pay.

Whatever... they looked super tired and maybe that's it. Though I would imagine they work at a cafe... they should be expecting a crowd in the mornings.

Then as I wait for my order at the side, the woman bringing my food items CRUSHES my croissant between her arm and her boob. I mean... DUDE.... make two trips or put the croissant on top of the other customer's boxed order.... there were other options other than crushing the ONLY thing passable about va bene.

The croissant surprisingly was very flakey and had that fermented flavor. I will give them that.

Then the latte comes which I cannot verify in terms of quality.

Then I wait. And then wait. And then wait as three customers who had bigger orders and were after me came and went.

THEN I get my cappuccino. I leave and get to my room. Take a sip of this long awaited caffeine goodness and BLECH. It tastes basically BURNT. 

After last night's perfect cup from Scarpetta.... this tasted like cigarette ashes.

I had pretty low expectation looking at the overall 3-star ratings here on Yelp. Got the Panettone, chocolate croissant, and plain croissant (told you I'm a tubby at heart). Also got the Vanilla Latte with Almond milk and was pretty excited about this because I'm lactose intolerant and Almond milk tastes better than soy. 

Got my latte, drank it, and was disappointed right away. Not enough vanilla (I asked for more), and just watery. The beans are probably on the ""greener"" side, because even though the latte didn't taste like much/""watery"", it had a LOT of caffeine in it. I would give a 1-2 star for the latte experience.

The pastries, however, was BOMB. I was very surprised, especially considering my standards for croissants are pretty high, always comparing with the best croissants I had in Paris.

Va Bene Caffe is an Italian cafe/bakery located in the The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. There are 2 locations, one on the 1st floor near the casino & the other is on the 2nd floor next to Holsteins Shakes & Buns.

Va Bene offers a variety of pastries, donuts, cookies, muffins, macarons, salads, sammies, paninis, and an array of hot & cold beverages & a variety of coffee/caffeinated drinks. The 2nd floor location is a storefront and also sells gelato & has limited seating available. The 1st floor location is just a kiosk and doesn't have seating or sell gelato but has everything else.

Va Bene serves up breakfast & lunch sammies/paninis & other quick foods, but I only tried some of the bakery items, the gelato & of course the coffee, but the salads & sammies looked fresh & good! 

FYI: Va Bene has a stranglehold on the coffee biz at The Cosmo. It's the only place you can buy a cup of coffee, no Starbucks or other coffee shops on site like at Caesar's Palace :-(  So being a person that drinks coffee at any given hour, 24-7 & am cranky without it, I quickly became a regular at Va Bene during my stay at The Cosmo out of necessity.

I'm not a complicated coffee drinker & I never get the fancy coffee drinks with all the goodies in it. I just like my coffee strong & black & really hot! So as long as the coffee meets this criteria, I am a happy glamper. The coffee at Va Bene was good & hot but a medium, black coffee was a lil pricey at almost $4, 4-gems!

FYI: There are no coffee pots in any of the rooms or suites in The Cosmo, so unless you wanna cough up $25 for a ""not so big karaffe of coffee"" via room service every morning that you are too lazy to make the hike down to Va Bene, then you better put on your walking shoes & throw on a hat! My laziness cost a cool $50 plus tips! But in my defense, I didn't have to ride the elevator all the way down to the 1st floor in my jammies from the 36th floor aka ""cost-convenience analysis"" people! 

On to the sweets...Va Bene offers a few free of gluten bakery items, and I tried the gluten-free, mudslide walnut cookie & the gluten-free, mixed berry muffin. The gluten-free Mudslide walnut cookie was chewy in the middle but with crunchy edges. It had a rich, dark chocolate taste with chopped walnuts baked inside it. It's not a soft cookie, but it's tasty. It cost $4.50 but is a decent-sized cookie, 4-gems!

The gluten-free, mixed berry muffin was a mixed bag. It was soft in the middle with a nice berry flavor, but the muffin top was really hard. In fact, I cut it off & didn't eat it. (I hate hard muffin tops!) The muffin was good sans the hard top. I paid $5 for said muffin but ate only $2.50 worth of it.

The chocolate croissant only had a lil schmear of dark chocolate inside of an overly dense shell. I was hoping for a lighter, flakier croissant with a lil more chocolate inside...$5, Schwing & a miss!

One macaron will cost you $3 a pop. I got 1 tiny raspberry macaron. It was a cute, purple, airy, lil, bitty taste o'berry & down in 1 bite! Good but one & done! 

Finally, my fave dessert/snack at Va Bene was the Irish Coffee gelato. The only other thing I love as much as a cup o'hot coffee is a cup o'premium, yummy ""gemlato"" to pair with said coffee, rain, snow or shine! A small scoop o'gelato in a cup will cost you $5, but I thought it was a pretty generous scoop. There aren't a whole lot of gelato flavors at Va Bene but sampling is allowed & I definitely think Irish Coffee is the best flavor there. If you've ever had an Irish coffee drink, it tastes just like that but in smooth, creamy, thick gelato form. It tasted gemtastic with my regular, house-blend, black coffee, 5-gems!

So if you're stayin' or playin' at The Cosmo and you need a light breakfast, lunch, snack or jolt o'caffeine, take 5 & stop by Va Bene Caffe cuz it's bene good & you have no other choice! Yes as other yelpers complained about, you pay a prettier penny at Va Bene for your drinks & treats, but live a lil people, um it's not Dunkin' Donuts.

This sandwich is from heaven.  Imagine it: sourdough bread, cheese, pesto, italian meats and a slightly runny egg (though I'm sure they will cook it more if you prefer).  Ridiculously delicious and big enough for two.

They also have amazing unique fruit salads for breakfast.  For example, we tried pink grapefruit with almonds, honey, and a few red pepper flakes for a surprising but yummy kick.  Sweet and hot all in one bite.

The coffee is Illy and it's also so smooth, rich and yummy...perfect to cure any hangover.

Though I didn't ty them, their assortment of pastries lookd beautiful as well.  Muffins, italian cookies, cannoli, breads...yum!

Now the joint isn't cheap but it's really good and better than so many alternatives in the hotel and on the strip.  We paid $23 for a coffee, fruit salad and a breakfast sandwich big enough for two.  :)

The place, no doubt, has a great atmosphere. It leans more to the contemporary and trendy style but $5 for a really small cup of latte and another $4.50 for a muffin pushed it a little for me. Still, my friend and I were on the strip and like Disneyland, overpriced food was inevitable. We sat on the bar stools overlooking the lounge across the cafe. The service was really good, we had a cool, flamboyant cashier who was very accomodating. 

I'd say it was very smart of the Cosmopolitan to fit in a little cafe amongst the high end shops and glittery chandelier lounges but if possible, perhaps cutting back on the pricing could help garner more customers, not that there weren't a lot when we went. People were enthusiastically handing over their $10-20 bills for a pastry and drink.

I went to this coffee shop after having just arrived to the Cosmo, our hotel, after a 5+ hour drive; thus, coffee was a necessity! :)

Anyway, I was happy they had almond milk, BUT dismayed by the price. $7 for a regular almond milk  hazelnut latte.  In addition, I asked for a cup of water and the barista tried to charge me $.25, so I said forget it.  The flavor of the coffee was fine, but it was nothing special.  After having Stumptown coffee in New York for cheaper than $7, this was a joke.  

I know Vegas is expensive, but there are other coffee shops that will probably be cheaper in Vegas.  Some cons, though, are that if you want a flavor shot or almond milk, they charge a lot more.  For hazelnut flavor, they charged me like $1.50 and then another $.50-$.75 for the almond milk, which added up to a ridiculous $7+! 

...end of rant.

Overall, not worth it.  I would venture across the street to the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. It is a bit pricey as well with flavor shots and non-dairy milk substitutes but at least they give you a 16 ounce beverage, instead of a double-the-price 12 ounce beverage.  If worse comes to worse...can't believe I am saying this...just go to Starbucks...at least you know the price is standard and what to expect.",P3gYzJ2UxK5mQlcRhQTq3A,2,1,2,N-Yr_pBcOT1_zgu4Uw3Ciw

This joint offers gelato, pastries, alcohol, coffee and tea. Pastries go for about $3-$5, coffees and teas around $3-$7 and cocktails for $12. On my visit, I got the large green mint tea for $5.

So if you are staying at the hotel like yours truly, you have 2 options, bend over and get your coffee here, or hoove it elsewhere. Perhaps you might be able to score some coffee in the casino, but who knows how much they are going to gouge you.",_GZ1-FQTWCfH7WQFo9rxwg,0,1,2,o0j2jP5DEgYPok_lKO2mlQ

Because there aren't huge conventions and the shops are not located in major walkways, the lines for coffee in the morning aren't too bad compared to some of the other hotels, but the baristas seem slow and don't have a good system as people behind me got drinks before me.

That said, i think they are best with their sandwiches.  I highly recommend the Italian sandwich toasted if you are looking to not eat in a restaurant in the hotel.

My only beef is that the second floor location closes early.  They also have good gelato!!",vbXmCVj1RZ4civT7nrcKyw,0,0,3,7VezLeYzvOrsh6PYo19hfw

Va Bene bless your soul for making an espresso based wake ip call and putting in it a to go cup for me. However i refuse to pay 7 dollars for the large one I am needy not desperate!!! So i opted for the small Latte still 5 dollars. I also tried their chocolate croissant because really what goes better with latte?

Swung through here on my way through the Cosmopolitan to grab a bite on the go. They had two breakfast sandwiches in the display, so I opted for the spinach and egg $13 dollars. 

The sandwich was served on sourdough bread with a square shaped egg with some spinach cooked in. I am definity not picky at all when it comes to food so it was not bad but nothing 4 or 5 star worthy of writing. They warm up the sandwich prior to serving to make everything warm and crunchy. 

If you're in a pinch or want to grab 'n go this place is that check-in-the-box for a quick refuel on coffee or snack.",UYrSe1wFvZvD69bbnh9nMQ,0,0,3,HzC-8VJHpv5rijCUvNUGlA

This italian coffee/gelato bar/shop is just around the corner near Cosmo's Marquee. It's easily passed by since it just a tiny store between restaurants and shops however. This place is IT!

I went here for a quick dinner prior to partying @ the Marquee. Service is decent, waiting time is not even there. Staff is nice, place is petite, nothing fancy, but then the food is delicious. Their sandwiches, as simple as they get are awesomely mouth watering. Don't have the appetite for ice cream but they're gelato looks yummy though i haven't tried it. 

Will come back here for a decent bang for your buck quick grub, if you don't wanna fall out of line to Marquee!!!!",4ijeWF6YJnxEd9MMQsVnHg,1,1,4,vNo1x06YK9b5SMH_z_Njbg

I paid the $7 and was very pleased with my drink. It was perfectly prepared and I had a nice conversation with a woman behind the counter. 

There were plenty of people on staff and busy for 515 in the morning. It was clear they were having fun with their job and were happy to be at their job. 

Although it's pricey, it comes with the territory. I enjoyed stopping by, being involved with the energy of the baristas, people watching in the Cosmo, and sipping my expensive latte.",L1dxlir4m_yyBJhmA7kO4w,0,0,4,JDCGDJQlHsNNOIOITsxxow

Service matters, because it can ruin an experience no matter how good food can be. Everyone in the hotel has been gracious until my boyfriend tried to order a chai latte with soy milk and an add shot. The cashier kept interrupting him when he was asked to repeat his order not letting him finish his sentence because he was confused about the add shot request and spoke in a condescending irritated tone and practically rolled his eyes at us!   Service was so bad I felt compelled to speak to the manager because I was so appalled at how we were being treated and wanted to prevent others from experiencing this, unfortunately they were unavailable. The baristas saw this happening and I could tell they were uncomfortable with what was going on. 

I'll save my caffeine fix for Starbucks instead next time, sorry Cosmo you hired whack people at this place.",EzTRNlGzfmeFEaStf9P67Q,0,0,1,B7yFdbG_vPkP2xF1t0f1wQ
