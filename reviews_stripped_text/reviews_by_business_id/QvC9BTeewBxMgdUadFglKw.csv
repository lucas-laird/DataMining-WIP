Upon being seated we specifically asked the bus person, for fresly brewed decaf, what we got instead was cold coffee that had been sitting in a thermal pot for several hours.
 We sent it back.  The second time around  we got  coffee from the same pot but this time it had been reheated and it was burnt.  
We finally gave up on the decaf and ordered regular coffee which was not great, but acceptable. When I'm shelling out  $2.25 for coffee, I expect it to be fresh.  
I noticed the place was empty, except for a  couple that was seated shortly after us.  A half hour after we ordered we were still waiting for our food. 
When we realized the other couple finished eating and left  we complained to the server who suddenly decided to find out about the delay. 
Obvisously, the cook was sending us a message.  I heard it loud and clear, but my husband was hungry and insisted we stay. Realizing the cook was seeking retribuation I barely touched my food, even though I was starving.
We've had problems during the graveyard shift in the past. Obviously, they lose money  by staying open and upper management could care less about what goes on.
After complaining, we were comped , but our evening was ruined so who cares.",Xx5J5SC5PQZURP0SJ338Lw,0,0,1,VYkDjJJoHImBssSEXrbN6w

The thing I love about this place is I always feel young every time I go because most of the customers are between 60-90years old. It seems like the social networking area for them when they get out to gamble. You see families also, nice atmosphere. The great thing is though most of the waitresses are long beyond their prime, they are very pleasant. A few times though I have had absentee waitress and had to go looking for them I figured they were taking a nap! But the food is good, large portions, we have stayed at the Marriott and dined here before right after being at the pool and in tank tops, shorts and thongs, so its very casual, nobody really cares.  There are approximately 6 TV plasmas mounted with usually sports or news playing. Booth and table seating, no more than a 5 min wait typically.  I really like it, my kids like it they have nice deserts,  nice portions and friendly people. The only thing is service can be very slow if you get a slower moving waitress over 70 yrs old,what can you expect! It's sweet they are still working. I respect that, so I try to tip them well and cut them some slack. I too will be old one day...They do a good job for there age! So, if you can stomach all that... you will love the food they have a great special weekly, either steak 8oz. and lobster or steak and shrimp 3 course meal for only $9.99 can't be bad, the restaurants down the street are charging $29.99!

Come here about every other month.
Food and service was always adequate by the standard of an average coffee shop in Las Vegas.
Our visit on 4-27-14 could be our last. Food is still ok, other than the fact their cook (definitely not qualify as a chef), did not know (or not care) about what customers requested. Four of us all ordered prime ribs - one medium well, one medium, and two medium rare. It came out all the same - RARE. Before we had a chance to have one of them to be cooked a little bit more (not difficult - just put it in the Au Jus for a little while), our waitress already disappeared (she gave us our check when the main course arrived) and never suraced again.
So service was horrible.
Even the hostess did not ask how was everything (afraid to?).

When we got there, it turns out that they do this special often and sometimes price it at $9.99 per person so it roughly is the same price, pretty much to lure in gamblers and locals. Ambience was rather slow and very old like feeling, not because of customers but because of the lighting and layout...it just felt out dated and uncared for. It was clean, don't get me wrong...maybe it was just my mood. Food was decent and though the lobster and steak were fairly small, together plus the price was still filling and a great deal. I mean it wasn't the best lobster or steak I ever had but it was alright. Still hit the spot. But my main reason for the one star is the fact of the service.

Our drink server was very friendly and helpful, our waitress seemed bored and distant.  she had a very difficult time smiling and making small talk.  Maybe because she seemed to be Vietnamese although she spoke nearly perfect English.
When our meal arrived and we cut into the prime, it was like cutting a board with a butter knife.  I asked for a chainsaw and told our waitress the meat was too hard as did my wife.  Our drink master asked if things were good and when we told her the meat was to hard she got the manager who pleasantly got us another cut of prime.  Well this to lead to us not eating our primer rib all together because the meat was so hard it nearly broke my teeth.  We ended up giving our share to our dog who didn't care if the darn thing was as hard as a rock. 
Its been nearly a year since we came here to dine and found the service a big improvement but the quality of the food was a total let down.  Now we'll probably never go back to dine on prime rib again, but we really enjoy the Grand Cafe's prime rib at the Red Rock a thousand times better then this place.

It has a more quiet ambience than the cafe at Red Rock Hotel, with a much smaller dining area. They're known for their $2.99 graveyard specials. So go crazy with ordering. LOL However, their regular dining menu is pretty good too. The location of the cafe, which is inside Rampart Casino, is great for those that live in the surrounding area. You don't have to travel so far for a quick bite or cheap late night eats.

I usually come here after a long day of being out. It's one of those places you go to when you're so tired from all the day's festivities, but you still want an easy meal that soothes you for the rest of the night. I don't know about you, but having breakfast items late at night is the best. :] 
No real explanation there. It just is.

Service has never been a problem, but I'm not sure how it is during the day since I only frequent this place at night. It's a laid-back restaurant and it's never busy when I come here. If you're in the area and nothing else is open for some quick eats, stop by this cafe. 

It's also a great place to chill with friends after being out with them the whole day because.. you know... you really don't want the night to end just yet. :]",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,7,5,4,sEKsS3AxmX5o6yFrEcZgqA

It was a long day for my family and we had one of those moments when your too tired to cook and then worry about cleaning up afterwards. So we ended up trying this place out with the help of my Yelp app. What drew us to this place was the prices but was quite pleased that they had a good variety of graveyard specials to choose from. 

Our server was friendly and attentive, he made sure everything was okay with us. The portions are quite large and it was a bit overwhelming especially the order of pancakes. However, everything we had was satisfying and nothing was mind blowing just more of an afterthought. The great thing about this place is that the crowd is more smaller than other places and the service moves pretty quickly. A good option if your looking for cheap comfort food!

3888079,2015-07-22,0,QvC9BTeewBxMgdUadFglKw,"The quality of the food here is hit & miss. We ordered the small prime rib a month or so ago, and when it arrived the plate was packed full. When I said, ""This is the small?"", the waitress responded that they just cut the slices without weighing them. The medium rare was perfectly cook & delicious! I had asked the waitress if the mashed were real potatoes or powdered & she said ""real"", They were NOT real, but mainly powdered with little bits of real potato mixed in. When she brought the check, I told her that mixing bits of real potato in with the powdered wasn't fooling anyone, but that the prime rib made up for it. Her response was, ""We say what they tell us to say"".

A couple of weeks later we went back with half a dozen visiting relatives & recommended the prime rib. BIG MISTAKE. Everyone's was very dry & tough. The veg was different this time & were frozen green beans that shot a stream of water when pierced by the fork. I opted for the french fries this time, but they also were dry & tasteless.

We had seen signs in past visits for $9.99 Steak & Lobster (photo in earlier post), so we thought that we'd give it another shot (best of three). The steak was about 2 inches in diameter & about 1 inch thick, small, yes, but cooked just right & very tasty. As expected the lobster tail shell was also small, but I really was surprised at how little meat there was. It amounted at most to about 2 medium shrimps. I cut it into 4 small pieces & it was gone. it had been covered in paprika, broiled until dry & served without benefit of melted butter. The veg & potato were as described above. When the check came we were shocked to see that the $9.99 deal had expired. The 2 minuscule meals with one Corona (served without lime) and one white wine (Sutter Home served from a small plastic bottle) came to over $50! ! !

It now think it's fair to say that we are done with this place. It appears that ordering food here is as big a gamble as playing their slots!",mfRZZpGWwFxBRFL8wWhbVw,1,0,1,5zXSdgTHbuoHNQb_krt3VA

Night:  4 Stars
At night, I noticed that there was only a handful of servers working.  But this wasn't an issue since our food was prepared and delivered pretty quick. The servers are also very attentive and at the same time in no rush to get your out of the restaurant.  For dinner, I had their special, which is their half chicken for $7.99.  Starving like a madman, I ended up getting 2 orders making that one full chicken for me.  Yes, I finished it. Yes, I was stuffed. This was pretty and cheap considering how much I got.  The rest of the menu actually looked pretty good and there's enough of a selection for everybody.

Morning: 2 Stars
It's actually busier in the morning and they know this. My issue, service really lags here.  With 8 servers working, you would think that water and our orders would be quicker than 15 minutes. Food comes out quick once you finally get someone to take your order.  It's the pre-order part where you need some patience.  What's worse, once you get your food, your check is also handed to you. It's almost like they can't wait for you to leave unlike at night where our server told is to take our time.  For breakfast, I got their 3 egg white omelet w/spinach and mushrooms. This was so delicious that I almost moved the stars up to 3.

I had a good experience at night and a poor one in the morning.  I think that my overall rating of 3 stars is fair.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,9,7,3,2X1mNpZo_8uTQ8xvxrHwnw

If you love coffee shops as I do, this place should scratch the itch.  Use a coupon and it becomes the deal of the month.

Chef salad (about $8) was good, and bleu cheese dressing tasted like it was made fresh.  The turkey seemed to have been cut from an actual turkey roasted on property, rather than lunchmeat.  

The Mrs. ordered an Asian chicken salad and seemed perfectly happy with it.  Plenty of food (including proteins) in both salads.

The finagle here is all of the specials, if they are what you want.  Our young kids shared the 3-course weekday dinner with appetizer (they chose soup), main course (spaghetti and meatballs), and dessert (apple cobbler, which was excellent), for about $9.

On our visit they happily allowed us to use the restaurant.com coupon that led us there with the special, even though both the special and the coupon listed the usual disclaimer prohibiting combinations of discounts.  

The only thing I didn't like was the iced tea, which clearly came from a syrup.  I should have ordered hot tea with a glass of ice but I only thought about this later.

This is very much a locals' casino restaurant.  We were the only people there with children, but they were very accommodating and seemed happy to see them.  Generally an older crowd, perhaps due to the fact that we visited on a Wednesday.


For two main-course salads, the aforementioned weekday dinner trifecta,  soft drinks all around, and an extra slice of cake, total bill  including tax and full tip, less restaurant.com discount, was just under $20.  WOW.

4435010,2011-10-11,5,QvC9BTeewBxMgdUadFglKw,"TL;DR - Depressing Cafe is Depressing (and sub par)

*the tl;dr on top of a review is quite ingenious imo, anyways*

I ate that this place one time before this review and I completely loved the cheese sticks but forgot everything else on the menu.

So, I convinced my roommate that Promenade Cafe was THE place to eat since I recalled all the food was so cheap and I didn't want to go to Buzz BBQ.  So let me walk through how I got to 2 stars.

We are walking in the cafe, I have good expectations at this point (5 stars).

Once taking a gander at the people at the place, I realized that the average age of cafe went from 70 to about 39, it kind of smelled like Florida.  

(Still 5 stars, eff losing stars for agism)

3-4 different waiters/waitresses kept coming up and asking us what we wanted to drink, it was pretty confusing after awhile. Which was odd since only 4 other people were in the facility.

I ended up getting the 3 course meal for $9.99 which included cheese sticks, spaghetti and meatballs, and some berry cake.

Still, 5 stars up to this point.

Then our normal waitress left to go on break.

Then after I got my cheese sticks (which were delicious) it took a good 20+ minutes for the main course to be served.

(Hmm...losin a star here)

Once I received my food, I couldn't wait to eat it.  Clearly after the long delay of making this food, I would pretty much be eating gods nectar, right?!  Boy howdy, I have never seen anyone make extremely sub par pasta before.

(Down to 3 stars)

After leaving a bad taste, I couldn't wait for desert to come around.  Except that it was a good 30 minutes before we received our desert.  There was about 5 customers and 10 staff, how the hell? On top of that, the berry cake was pretty dry and it was just bleh.

(1.5 stars).

And to top it all off, while my roommate and I were waiting for desert.  An elderly woman walked to a table and when the waiter asked her how many people will be joining, she said in a loud and dead tone, ""I'm eating alone tonight"".

(gains a 1/2 pity star, for a total of 2 stars)

Hearing that was so depressing, that I couldn't even continue whatever conversation what I talking about.  It completely killed whatever positive atmosphere that was going on at the moment.

I feel like cutting my wrist just thinking about this place, it's almost as depressing as Silverton Casino.",UER4m0CBVgcFlVbMqhCvCg,4,1,2,0XQbjTVwXhRKqmbyQWkghA

  In the last couple of months when I was in the area I had dinner here. What strikes me about Promenade  Cafe is that it is inside an attractive casino resort that is surrounded by golf courses and upmarket homes, yet charges prices similar to a Boulder Highway casino. On both visits, I'd enjoy a taste of Boulder Highway in the heart of Summerlin. 

  The two meals that I enjoyed here have been the chicken fettuccine and spaghetti with meatballs. The chicken fettuccine is one of three $9.99 deals where you pick a soup or salad, a listed entrée, and choice of a listed dessert. Of course the beverage and tip accelerate the bill to around $15 which is worth it. The food was good. The strawberry cheesecake was puny. On this visit the tone of the service was Allright with the exception of a major restaurant etiquette no! no! When a guest is still working on the entrée, you never ever place the dessert on the table. Talk about being hurried. And why? I was one of the few guests in the restaurant. On Saturday, I stopped here after Dessert Shores where I ordered a spaghetti with meatballs that included soup or salad. It costed $7.99 comparable to an old school casino. Spaghetti with meatballs is also one of the few $9.99 dinners. The $2 difference is the puny dessert. The chicken noodle soup was in a bowl in lieu of a cup that is the standard in many resorts. I appreciated the larger portion. The spaghetti with meatballs was okay. To be honest this is fool proof course that is impossible to mess up. But it fell short of the spaghetti & meatballs that I am a fan of in the Railroad Pass Casino. Three meatballs accompanyed the spaghettis. It would of been nice if Promenade Cafe offered Grated to put on the spaghetti as most places do. Maybe this is why the spaghetti lacked flavor. 

  Spending some time here, I observed that the Starbuck's down the hall closes around 9 P.M. In the later hours of the evening this is the spot for coffee.

  In conclusion, Promenade Cafe is a decent restaurant  to enjoy an old school casino style dinner in the heart of Summerlin. Compared to the cafe in the Sun Coast  a traffic signal south on Rampart Boulevard, I prefer it over the Promenade Cafe. My final verdict: Promenade Cafe 3 Stars.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,9,10,3,d72smWtsfdswQFEwKCZoiw

The restaurant was only half full, and the service was still shockingly bad. We sat at our table and were ignored for about 10 minutes. Then a woman came over and asked what we wanted to drink. We told her and said we were ready to order but she replied, ""not your server--drinks only."" So we continued to wait. Finally our server moseyed over and took our order. We then waited another 20 minutes for our food (we'll actually my mom got her food in about 18 and I got mine in 25, so we ate separately). The food here actually isn't bad and it's reasonably priced, but you can only come here when you're not very hungry and ready to wait a while before you eat. This is obviously a place where servers go to retire and they can take their sweet time. It also doesn't help that this restaurant is connected to the casino and smells terribly of cigarette smoke.",u067WYyZab4vEFrWPcEqow,0,0,1,Q4VFLpsIyk8-l3BdzS365g

It's always busy but without proper staffing it's never my first choice. We visit my father 5 times a year always stay at JW and our father always wants to eat here. Rampart needs to address service is. Hoping the new deli will be a better option, because for your casino & hotel the Promenade is not a good choice.

After we order our food, we asked whats the todays soup and our waitress ""NIDA"" said ""i am busy"" then she just walked away from our table. her face was like ""dont bother me"" Do you think telling us what kinda soup you guys have was a  hard question or take looooong time to answer? That was really rude. And guess she put our order wrong or something cuz took exactly 43 minutes. Asked for horseradish, never brought it, of course no refills on drinks. She just brought the check at the end. Omgash never coming back when shes working. Shes terrible, and horrible.",kD5WUgKVtS15jMXhBJuPZQ,1,0,1,134dx1fHDmo4HpuSWg3FwA

Their food/restaurant options are blah and boring, most of their restaurants don't even open during the daytime anymore (only for dinner)  Service throughout the place is fair at best.  As far as the cafe, their menu is very simple and boring and a little over priced.  However their lunch special for their asian food is surprisingly good, and good portions too (only $6.99)  You get a choice of egg drop soup or hot and sour (i've had both before and both are quite good)  an egg roll and I ordered the general chicken with fried rice)  We had also ordered a basket of onion rings and those are large and VERY yummy.  Their cafe wouldn't be my first choice of places to goto but it's ok for lunch.  It's DEFINITELY better then their buffet.  Their buffet is horrible.

Our server both mornings was Robin....friendly enough..you get your food and off you go.I enjoyed my sausage and cheese omelet one morning and basic bacon and eggs the next. other family members had pancakes...french toast and the fruit platters...all with no complaints.

She took our order brought our food and we never saw her again. So my husband and I proceeded to walk to the front; I had my plate in my hand because I needed a to go bag right? The people up front were just looking and standing. I really didn't know why they were there because they weren't keeping track of their waitresses because she was lost. My personal opinion. The waitress was on drugs. So I then bagged my food up front at the cash register after the cashier brought me a bag. They went and dragged the waitress from I don't know where and she gave the cashier the ticket. My husband paid of course no tip. I HAVE A TIP. HIRE SOME NEW STAFF AND MONITOR YOUR WAITSTAFFF. YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO SERVING BLACK PEOPLE. NO BLACK STAFF AT RAMPART CASINO. I take that back I saw a biracial cocktail waitress.

5657326,2017-04-16,1,QvC9BTeewBxMgdUadFglKw,"Worst service and food I have ever experienced.  I'm not sure what happened to this place but it has gone so far downhill it can never climb back up.  We were seated at 9:15 and finally begged for the check at 10:55.  We ordered coffee and water with no lemon to start.  The server brought pepsi and water with lemon.  We told her that wasn't ours and she looked like we were speaking a language she didn't understand.  We were only given refills once even after signaling her several times.  She was not the same server as our waitress.   Our waitress took forever to do anything moving at a snails pace.   She disappeared in the back for 15 minutes at time.  Several people around us also complained and one asked for the manager.  Not sure what she was doing in the kitchen but it sure wasn't helping anything to move faster.  The egg roll appetizer took over 24 minutes to be served then the dinner arrived 25 minutes after that.  The egg rolls were disgusting, greasy and gross.  They tasted like I'd imagine egg rolls to taste that had been sitting in the back of the freezer for a year.  I ordered the fish tacos.  Again, horrid.  The batter on the fish was greasy, thick and super tough.  The fish had zero taste.  The amount of slaw was minuscule on each of the three tacos so I couldn't even cover up the bad fish.  My husband had the philly cheese steak.  The bun was soggy and stale.  The meat was full of fat and scraps.  They did remember to hold the mushrooms so one point for that.  The place was not that busy.  I have no idea what the hold up was or why the food was so bad.  We have eaten here several times in the past, as recently as January 2, and never had an issue.",kc2f5W_vnTPk53PLvmWlNw,0,0,1,9yQsYjfm1PS60fM_mat75Q

My husband says they have a great burger, homemade soups and the Beef Deep is delish!!! Sometimes we grab the late night Prime Rib after a fun evening in the Casino. And Breakfast is a steal here!
They servers are all great!  We love that they remember us and sometimes our names/ orders too! When my local friends meet me here they too are amazed and the fresh quality and friendly service the Cafe has to offer.
Give it a try!! :)

Absolutely the WORST service!!

We were going here quite a bit they have a dinner specials and we liked that they have these specials and they are pretty good with appetizer and dessert! The only thing is don't expect a big dessert it is very small! You do get what you pay for I guess!

Time after time it seemed like the servers just take their time and not care if you have your drinks filled or if you need anything. We have had to go to the kitchen door where they walk in to ask where our waitress was!!

I think they need new staff who wants to work and needs to work to get them to service the tables better. Some act like it is just too much for them.
Unless we see service has changed we would rather eat at the buffet or the Irish pub across the way!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,5,0,2,I60rskVKgjM3PUr01g-83A

Each time I went in with mild expectations and came out disappointed. Just because they have cheap food, it doesn't justify mediocre service. I think the service quality is inverted. The manager should lead a team in customer service. So far, it's been the bus boys who have been the most helpful then, the capable servers were reasonably kind, and the managers were simply ignorant and oblivious to non-regulars. The surf and turf special is $9.99 and not on the menu. The early riser specials are $3.99. But don't expect much from them, tough steak, small rubbery lobster tail, and over-cooked bacon. Good luck with this one.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,0,0,2,2fWjnG-8Nyi_K7tF0pdQcg
