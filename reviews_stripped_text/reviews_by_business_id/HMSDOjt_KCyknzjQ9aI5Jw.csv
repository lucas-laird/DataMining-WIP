We were greeted with a smile and our server was very friendly! I forgot his name, but his demeanor had me believing he was the owner. He was fun to talk to! So on that, service is an A+.

Understandably on their first day they were out of some appetizers, so we skipped that and ordered ramen. I got the Tonkotsu with mild spice and my friend got the Tomo ramen, no spice. I can't really judge the broth in mine since I had it spicy, but I tried my friend's and it was delicious! The charsu was also really good, it didn't just melt in your mouth because it was more than just fat.

I'll definitely be coming back to try their soup dumplings and ramen burger!",kPs2BCmrcv87bh8X7qOTlw,0,0,5,j4Nf8gVdfzb6P9ULR9uxsA

But it fell short on flavor! The pork was so tough I could not bite through it  the broth was just blah! The ramen was just lacking flavor. I hope you fix this because there are many good places with authentic ramen in this town. The egg was cooked perfectly. I love the decor and it has good vibes.  Please work on serving better and more flavorful ramen. I really want to try the pork buns but I'm afraid if the pork is going to be tough.",OM_vkyg08Y-BbhJ8wffvVA,0,0,3,9DcV6u9uMAgqdxrJ_qCrJw

1476043,2018-06-01,5,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"After hearing tons of promotion, Tomo has finally opened! Excited to have them so close to my work, planning a revisit and hoping things have been tightened up to edit and upgrade rating. Menu is surprisingly large for a spot attached to a boba tea place, quality hit or miss the first week but shows a lot of promise!

PROS:
+ How is this the first ramen burger I've come across in Vegas?! Plus it's actually pretty tasty, with Angus beef and a crazy-low price tag of $7 including a giant mountain of seasoned fries. 
+ Those fries deserve their own mention. Skinny-cut, seasoned with black and white sesame seeds and salt, they're great. Would request a Sriracha ketchup for dipping, or just get an order of their Tomo fries to share.
+ Service was friendly and attentive. Sat at bar, kitchen staff made some conversation, had a few issues with order that were addressed, and ownership or management seemed to be circulating around and requesting feedback.
+ Super clean with fun comic mural decor and neon lights. Can grab and go from tea counter, sit on patio, or get a table to dine in. Confused about the two-business-one-space setup but it seems to work okay so far.


CONS:
- The word dumpling is in the name but they're not on their game. Chicken soup dumplings were mediocre and deflated, would suggest a different presentation too. A couple of friends have gone in for this order too and had similar complaints or straight up sent back their order. Needs work!
- Also the tea. Got a split cup and one side was great while the other had virtually no flavor. Staff were great about changing it out but the remake wasn't much better. 

Giving a couple weeks to tighten things up, then revisiting for the bao and honey toast that looked so good. Hoping they do well in the space!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,6,3,_OYCFXRFJfm-XGgOdV0cjw

1793924,2018-06-25,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"I was so excited that a ramen shop opened up in summerlin and very close to home too. Alas, they didnt hold up to the high quality expectations you think they would have being in a ritzy area.

I ordered Tonkatsu Ramen. Broth was nice and fatty but didn't taste like Tonkatsu. In fact it tasted very much like the chicken broth in chicken ramen. Yuck.

Their version of Chashu was thick slices of fatty porkchop. Hard to chew. I had to spit it out.

I had ordered extra egg and paid a $1 for an extra HALF an egg. Every place I have ever been to give you a full egg when you ask for extra. Egg was nothing to rave about. It was just blah.

Noodles were thick and undercooked. 

I ate maybe half of it before getting disgusted with it. 

Of all the ramen places on my reviews I have to say this is the 2nd to worst ramen shop in Vegas. Do yourself a flavor (pun intended) and take the extra drive to China Town. See my other reviews for amazing shops in Vegas.",fS86t0IvNj-kDBae2mJHSQ,0,0,1,jDuTa9cHU1h8E2R-zduRxg

Then we order the shrimp for my son first it was under cooked and then it was to salty and it had a bitter flavor I assuming because they grill it. Then we order the Tomo ramen and I think it was the only think I like it, good flavor noddles where Cooke perfect crispy pork belly I do recommended, and at the end we order the Enso churro I do not recommend it was horrible the inside it was not cooked it feels like you where eating dough, I just give it one bite and I could not eat more.

We are not too found of the food menu hear but their drinks are very good. Im doing a review on their drinks and desserts. Drink prices are decent- sm $4, lg $5, and slip cups $6. I love how they have a limited amount of choices here so its not like other boba shops that have a million and one choices which just makes it a little harder to choose from if your like us and want to try everything. Their boba/popping pearl toppings are to a minimum too which is great. The Taiyaki are very moist and huge with just the right amount of filling.",9poAce4B7L8ixuV3O_6XyQ,0,0,4,gZJyjp1P4x8kd9lmtOQ4NQ

Then we had a talk with the manager just to give a feed back and hopefully the restaurant will get improved. The respond we had from her was "" I dont eat pork"".

Had the Watermelon Delight and the Strawberry Palm in their split cup..hard to decide which was my favorite.

The place wasn't even busy for it being Thursday. Our waitress was nice but that definitely wasn't enough. We finally got our ramen and my broth was WAYYY too salty.

Ordered the vegetable tempura, gyoza, fried rice and Tomo ramen. Nothing out of the ordinary. Thought the ramen was on the bland side. At the end of the meal I ordered a matcha boba but you could tell the boba was sitting there for a while and the matcha tasted like soap. I don't see myself coming back. As for the service, there was a couple of employees standing around and I understand since it wasn't busy during the time I came.

We ordered the ramen noodles, ramen burger and fries appetizer. The ramen noodles looks delicious with half egg, wonton, pork, chicken unfortunately the soup was on the salty side and the meats were little tough. The beef in the ramen burger tasted good but the ramen was mushy from the beef and kinda weird texture. However, the fries appetizer drizzled lightly with teriyaki sauce was really good. Sad to say that they get 2 stars overall but I'll add another star for the great service and free milk teas which tasted good.

Staff is friendly, graphics on the walls are cool, and the music fits the whole experience.
I've been watching reviews for this new place so I came back a few days ago. Everything was super - the cheesy mazemen is a creative spin. The Cuban was wow.  Gyoza are the biggest and most flavorful around.  You can see the team making them in the back.

2752487,2018-06-24,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"I made a yelp account just to complain about how absolutely goddawful this place was to me and my friends. Out of all the types of restaurants out there I never expected in my life to be at a ramen restaurant for two and a half hours. For those of you who haven't had ramen before the general concept people with brain cells have come to understand is that you make a huge pot of broth so that you can pump out tons of bowls because the rest of the ingredients do not take that long to cook. Somehow this has escaped the owner (s) of toho who I assume only saw ramen on a travel channel show and thought ""I can do that!"" I'm not sure anyone in human history has ever been more wrong and inept. Not counting the fact that it took us 2 hours to get what has to be the worst looking ramen, instant noodles or otherwise, in the state it also had far too much soy sauce, the pork that was supposed to be delicate and disintegrate when you eat was cooked far too long leaving the chashu and the fat much too hard, the fat the juiciest part was rendered inedible. The noodles had this chalky texture I've never had before in any noodle ever and it was hard to eat with it's bad aftertaste. It felt as if everything was just thrown in the ramen with no actual thought of how they should be together and certainly no thought of presentation. Not counting how garbage the actual ramen was the service left much to be desired  it took me genuinely a half hour of us sitting there before we got the check, there was 45 minutes of us sitting there with empty cups before someone offered us a refill. I don't know if management just hired the absolute worst people to do the job here but it sure seems like they did it for some sick social experiment. I cannot stress this was the worst experience I've ever had with a restaurant in my life, I would have to be paid 4 digits and up before I even thought of going here again. The gyoza was pretty good though.

I really wanted to love my food - unfortunately my visit this time around was a little lackluster. However, this is a new establishment so I definitely have hope that it will get better.

Appetizer: The pork belly skewer was okay (3/5). It was overcooked which caused the pork belly itself to be a little dry. It was drizzled in a teriyaki sauce which made the taste a lot better. 

Dinner: Ramen Burger (2/5). Guys...I was so excited to eat this. Unfortunately, it was not anything I expected. The ramen ""bun"" was crunchy on the outside but really soggy & mushy on the inside. The texture was very unpleasant. I actually ended up only eating the hamburger itself. On the bright side, the fries that came with the ramen burger were fantastic!

Dessert: THIS GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE (5/5)! It was honestly the sole dish that saved my entire experience...so good! I will most likely be back just for green tea creme brulee.

3170408,2018-05-27,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"Not bad! We ordered 3 Tomo ramens in our group and it has every ingredient you could ever imagine in ramen in it. The broth could use more consistency though as 1 bowl was diluted, one just about right, and 1 way too salty. The service was exceptional and I think since they are new, they are trying really hard. Dumplings are pretty good. But soup based dumplings aren't truly soup based. Fries were super crispy and salty...yum. The bubble teas from Enso were really good. A strong tea flavor comes through and they actually use green jasmine tea as a base for most of their teas, even where you don't usually see that, such as the taro or thai milk tea..but I like it! And also with the split cup, it is pretty unique as you can try two flavors!",7Nm51v1DgqNfrx4Njieqaw,0,2,4,IEPcNOhoNceT4nmDvcRyAw

Moving on, I had the pork and shrimp gyoza and they were amazing! My son had Macha and the jasmine green tea. I had the Peach drink and we both loved all the drinks. I had the tonkatsu Raman, which was pretty good, the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly. My son had the Raman burger, which was good but a little hard to eat, but his fries were a bit salty. We also also ordered dessert of taiyaki which were delicious. While somethings started off a little disappointing, it was soon made up with the food.

Flavor was good for the rest of the dishes, just weak on execution, which is acceptable for the first day. Ginger chicken ramen noodles needed to be cooked more, which they corrected. For the pork belly sandwich, it was good except the bread was a little too hard for me, that's personal taste though; pork belly was excellent, I was surprised that it was served with ham and a spicy sauce, this wasn't indicated in the menu, I will not order the sandwich again. Pork belly did not match the rest of the sandwich. I'll try other things though. Servers were happy, excited and accommodating. Looking forward to coming back. Oh and the dessert was excellent!

3216116,2018-06-13,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"In al honestly, I really wanted to like this place, but I have to be honest that I was not impressed with the restaurant.

I came in for lunch with my sisters and my dad to have some ramen. I read some great reviews about the place, are was eager to try it. The service was ok, I wish they were a little more attentive. The food is my biggest concern. I personally have been to countless ramen places in Vegas, but this one is one of the ones I would put at the very bottom of my list. I ordered the tontsuku ramen, and the noodles were underdone. Not only that, but the pork had no flavor. The two good things about the ramen, was the egg and the broth. Along with the appetizers, they were not impressive. The fries were ok at best, since the belly was not seasoned. Also I would not recommend the soup dumplings, since they should just be called dumplings, because there was no soup inside. 

All things considered, I would not be coming back, unless they make some change to their methods of cooking and maybe putting in a grill that is not gas powered.",AMGiyy6d4ebq6_AQncaTuA,1,0,2,qbUw0I1yHEqFz6WgSlluZQ
3223832,2018-06-07,2,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"Today is my birthday and I was given a choice to go anywhere I wanted. I was craving Asian food and since it's my birthday I didn't feel like cooking. It was a toss up between this place and the ramen place down the street from my house. We decided to swing by here since we wanted to support the owners because they also own bowlology. 

While we were deciding what to order I asked our server sally if I could have the ramen like the one in the picture. It turned out to be stock photo and I guess I was a little shocked and disappointed in her response. When I asked if I could get a ramen similar to it like maybe a shoyu ramen, her response was I don't think so. Instead of saying no I'm sorry.... or let me check on that....

We ordered the dumpling in chicken soup, chicken skewers, shrimp skewers, ton ramen and 2 boba. The dumpling was good. Came on the soup spoons on a plate. It was very delicious. I believe they were gyoza like dumpling boiled in a chicken stock. It was perfect flavor and loved it.  The bf got the skewers. I took a bite of each one and it was a tad bit spicy for me but he loved it. My ramen was good. Couldn't finish it all and passed it to the bf to finish up. 

While we were sitting there we was watching a gentleman walking around and talking to a few of the customers and after a bit I told the bf and boyfriend that the next time we come back we must ask for him to be our server because I'm sorry, Sally just wasn't the sharpest crayon in the box. She was nice but at the same time not super friendly and personable. Lot of her answers was not very customer service oriented and she seemed flustered or maybe like she was new. Anyway, this man that we were watching swung by our table and asked how we liked our food. I was thinking perfect!! Now I can get his name so I could request for him. We told him we loved our food. Got his name. His name is Dan. Turned out to be the cook. I was happy and sad at the same time. Happy because how many cooks come out and say hi and make sure everything was good and just make you feel welcome???? Not many I tell you. He's the second one that I know of. I was sad because now I can't request for him to be our server because that's not what he does. 

We talked to him for a bit about food and stuff like that. My daughter is vegan so they had a conversation about that. Anyway, Dan is the reason why I am giving this place five stars. I wanted to give this place less stars. It's not because of the food it's because of Sally. I believe good customer service and good food are important. You can have the most delicious food but if a server gives you a bad feeling then chances are you won't be back. 

Dan excuses himself and Sally comes back. We get the bill from her and hand her over the debit card. She has some kind of issues with the little machine and says she needs to go the front. Not a problem. Dan comes back to the table and we socialize a bit more. Meanwhile, sally is walking all over the place with our debit card in her hand. I watch her walk from the front to the side by the kitchen and then back towards the front then back again in other words this kid is walking around everywhere with the cars in her hand. We had to stop taking to Dan asked him to get her to come back towards us. We finally get her to stop waking everywhere and asked for our cars back and what the issue was she said she was having a hard time scanning the card. Not sure if it was the magnetic strip or not but we told her we will just pay you in cash. It made no sense why she was just wondering around with our card in her hand. 

Dan was nice enough to give us a 10% discount. We did leave her a tip because it was the right thing to do but in all honesty, it was the good food and Dan that saved the day. I think people need to bottle his personality and enthusiasm and share it with others. People can learn a lot about customer service from him.  He's the only reason why I'm giving 5 stars. If it wasn't for him I'd knock off a star because of our server. 

Conclusion: food is great and Dan is awesome. Hopefully Sally was just having an off day. I will come back and I think you should give this place a try. You will not be disappointed",lgxCqDMnowyx1Q5fLdLPCA,9,6,5,guTJHcBNNz-WdMzX-9Rkuw

First I was shuffled between people just to place my order for take out, paid and gave a nice tip and waited. I ordered a Raman burger, which I got the first time I ate there, and it came out really fast. It was in a to go box in a bag so I didn't look at it till I got home about 10 minutes later. I feel sad writing this but it was disgusting. The bottom of the tray had a bunch of fluid in it (oil,water, I don't know) the bun was completely soaked and gross. As far as the hamburger, it was like they just browned the out side because the inside was totally rare and uncooked.

3332532,2018-06-04,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"Just got back and finished my take out meal.  Some first impressions of the restaurant.  I went on a Sunday night, so maybe not prime time hours, but way overstaffed with 4-5 people seeming to stand around.  The restaurant itself is nice and cool with the artwork, but 2x too big for a ramen restaurant.  I get that they have a 2 for 1 build with the tea bar, but still too large.  

As far as takeout, I ordered the tonkatsu ramen, extra spicy.  Supposed to take 15 minutes, but ended up taking 25.  Price-wise, $10 is reasonable considering it comes full of accompaniments.  Upon getting home, I realized a few things.  First, the broth was leaking in the to-go bag. Either they filled the soup too high or didn't secure the cap.  Second, I got no chopsticks in my bag.  Third, I was given no enoki mushroom as the menu states.  Lots of misses from my first and possibly last experience.

Food-wise, the ramen broth was very meaty and had a big, bold taste - very drinkable.  There was literally zero spice in my broth, however, even though I explicitly asked for extra spicy.  Absolutely zero.  The noodles were some of the best noodles I've had in town.  Wavy and thick, almost udon style.  The pork belly was thick, as I typically enjoy in ramen, but half was fat so I had to throw a bunch of it away. as it was impossible to chew.  And it came with only 1 piece.

My experience wasn't great at Tomo.  I have my loyal ramen spots I hit up in town and was hoping Tomo could crack into the top rotation as it's closer to my house, but definitely not worth a go in the future.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,2,1,2,wPf2X9VwqXgbLLVBD-JIJQ

We got chicken skewers, vegetarian tomato noodle(I think), and my friend got tomo ramen. 
The skewers were super dry. At least it had some flavors. Not sure if it was from the sauce though. 
My soup wasn't too bad, but the noodles tasted and looked like one of those frozen noodle packages that they just brought back to life by boiling it or something. Heck, even instant ramen tasted better. My friend provided me same feedback on her noodles. 
Maybe it was just a bad day? I don't know. But I really wanted to like this place.

Ordered Tomo fries, soup dumplings, gyoza, tonkatsu and mazemen.

Informed that the restaurant was out of soup dumplings.  When asked how long it'll take because we can have it come towards the end of the meal.  We were told it'll be a few hours.  I'm no expert but Din Tai Fung can get an order from scratch in 8 minutes.  I can fold my way to dumplings in 10 minutes and 10 to cook.  Sounds like prep work wasn't complete.

Fries were piping hot and fresh.  Disappointed that there were only 4 pieces of pork belly bits.  One word of advice to management.  Change the vessel the fries are served from.  The bowl looks nice, but 5 minutes later, everything was soggy.

Gyoza was okay

Tonkotsu ramen egg was good and so were the noodles.  Could have used a bit more Tare and more body for the broth.  Pork belly needed work, a lot of work.  Was not melty, was not flavorful.  Was just there....

Mazemen is last to be reviewed.  Honestly better description would be Ramen Mac & cheese.  Wasn't slurpable and the ideal of mazemen was lost with this dish.  It was just noodles and cheese.  I honestly would re-think this item

I know it's opening weekend and I'm excited for another ramen place.  Restaurant has to settle in and find it's paces.  So please take these as constructive feedback and not as complaints.",qSJv4MNkjL4U2FNwZmynXg,0,0,3,LnDVcPj7pUWBaHbuV3dP8Q

We came on a Saturday afternoon, which also happened to be free tea day, whaaaaatttt?! We started the meal with two comp teas from Enso (both really good). Enso and Tomo are in the same building so kind of like a two for one. For main entrees I had the delicious Creamy Vegetarian Ramen and my boo had the Tomo Ramen. Mine was absolutely delicious. It had some hints of garlic, a smooth, creamy broth and those little skinny mushrooms that I love. My man said his was super good as well. His even had a small meat skewer in it.

It's a joint ramen/boba place where you can either order boba to-go on the right side or sit down on the left side and eat on top of ordering said drinks. Initially walking in, there were no greetings given or verbal guidance as to how exactly the place worked despite the emptiness--like, ""hey! Do you want to just order drinks? Come to this side and order!"" Or, ""did you want to dine in? For how many? Come this way!"" Since no one was really paying attention to me standing there, I was confused about what to do and assumed this was an order first and sit down fast casual food type of place. Had to lock eyes with a worker and motion for 2 people before being noticed and sat down. Ordered: Tomo fries and Yakisoba 
The Tomo fries were nice and crispy, when eaten together with the pork belly bits it gave it a nice extra boost of flavor. Also served with a dipping sauce if you normally like to sauce up your fries!
Yakisoba was mediocre, it was quite salty (probably expected for soupless noodles) and presentation looked like a normal bowl of ramen thrown with leftovers.

This is the 9th island and Tomo is serving up some ramen that makes us feel at home. Their broth has flavor without being thin and their noodles are a contender with all others. This place is a heavy hitter I expect to see around for the long haul.... and frequently.",M6cTtHXTgPDMp_BKf9udLQ,0,1,5,o9HTuVf0fbws-L3IqpMUaQ

Nor did they have togarashi (red peppers) for the ramen. Not really an authentic Japanese ramen place, I guess they are going for a fusion mix.",r6awYzzKuW3VDIq7A3gC0A,0,1,2,VhHCJQXcWs-55lKtC_9VbA

5196542,2018-05-30,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"I got excited to learn about a ramen spot opening closer to my area. Saves me the drive to Monta or Jinya for my usual ramen cravings. Checked this place out earlier this week and would give it 2 stars: mainly for cleanliness, atmosphere and mediocre service.

-Wait time after ordering our food took about 20-25 mins. 

-Appetizer: Chicken Soup Dumplings -- which is a dim sum favorite. However, you can tell theirs is not made from scratch and could most likely be the frozen kind. 

-Ramen Entrees: Tonkotsu and Shoyu Ginger Chicken -- broth wasn't hot enough, it was almost close to room temperature which makes it seem like it's been sitting out on the expo for a while. Plus, some of the noodles on the Tonkotsu bowl were still stuck together. The cut on the pork chasu was a little too thick for my preference.  

-Boba: Wintermelon and Taro split cup -- needs a lot of work. Both drinks looked watered down just looking at the color of it. As far as taste goes, the Wintermelon wasn't too bad, yet the Taro barely had any flavor in it. 

Didn't really finish all the food that was ordered due to poor quality. Focused on eating the protein in each ramen bowl, paid, and left.",mmPf8GNkTRuiP02BCvjsdA,2,0,2,KnVzYHo0i_lu9fUfeatGvw

5372002,2018-07-01,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"Came in last Friday (June 29,2018) as a recommendation of my mom's friend. 
The place is clean and decorated nicely. The service was quite annoying because the girl kept asking if we needed something or if we are okay every three minutes. There's a difference between being very attentive vs being annoying.

The food was very subpar. 
We ordered Ramen, Classic Fried Rice, Tomo Fries, Chicken Soup Dumplings, Ramen Burger, Chicken Katsu Sandwhich 
Broth of the was okay, but the meat was very very hard.
Ramen Burger- the outside of the ramen was good, but inside it was just all falling apart. The ""bun"" was very soggy on the inside. 
Tomo fries was alright, but there was a lot more sauce on the bottom than the top of the fries. 
Chicken Soup Dumpling- the wrapper was very hard on the top, like it was very dried out. 

My family and I also ordered boba, and was that a mistake or what.
The boba didn't taste fresh at all,  and it was really hard.
The drinks we got tasted like very sweet medicine.
We got the watermelon delight, mango limeade (it doesn't say it's a slush, but when you get it-it's a slush), and pineapple mojito.

They need to work on a lot of things. Not sure yet if I'm willing to try it again.",baW-EBVOGmLMuUgUdsiUpw,1,1,3,hRrI3XyM6KEjveeHVEskeg
5533682,2018-05-29,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,Their service is good. It was just the most disgusting food I've ever tried. It's NOT ramen. They should find another name for it. I ordered Tomo ramen. Noodles were too hard. Soup was super salty. I tried all toppings they put on but I could not find any good points. Milk tea was good. It is worth to recommend to friends as tea place but absolutely not as ramen place.,8FRollWGNGVDqnBfY-FIHQ,0,0,1,jylobW6R_s4_7Vl8ygUjwQ
5602742,2018-06-11,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"walking in you get the wow factor of all the cool art decor they have on the wall.. very impressive and is very nice! 

plenty of sitting area inside and a few tables outside.. and they got some high ceiling industrial theme going on with the typical IKEA decor.. 

this restaurant is literally halfed with a boba spot.. ENSO.. and you can order whatever you want from the 2 menus..

me and family decided to sit in on tomo's side and try their noodles/ramen..

ramen is really good.. got the tomo.. which came with a skewer.. chasu.. baby corn.. a tomato (really good).. gyoza.. nori.. bamboo.. and their noodles tasted great! only down factor was a little bit on the salty side for me.. yakisoba also came out a little bit salty for me.. 

maybe they got a complaint about their food not being salty enough from before?? who knows.. but their salt game is strong! as the rest of my family also said it was a bit salty for them.. 

price is ok.. but the service was great!! - appreciated our waiter refiling our waters and checking up on us consistently.. (might be irritating for some.. but i appreciated it!)

well try this spot again for sure in the future..",A0Sy2srGc-AhXEuFoErDkw,1,0,4,bUCOrBy3gNvE2kPPwWy4Pw
5645112,2018-06-06,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"Tomo is probably the coolest looking ramen spot in Las Vegas. The artwork, neon signs, and decor in general really caught my eye, but the food itself needs more work. 

We ordered the shoyu ramen and the mazemen (cheesy ramen). My boyfriend and I usually frequent Monta/Jinya/Hashi. The noodles at Tomo seem to taste and look like the noodles you can get at a grocery store. My boyfriend said that his shoyu ramen had no distinct flavor and tasted just like water even though it comes with a lot of toppings. My mazemen tasted just ok. I had asked for enoki mushrooms and was only given about maybe 6 strands of enoki. If I'm paying extra for a topping I kinda wish I could get more.  

For dessert the tres leches honey toast sounded so good. When it came out it was really cute but as I tried to take a bite, my fork had a hard time cutting through it? I don't know if they freeze this dessert or not because it was pretty tough to cut through. The whipped cream also tasted sour? Either they make their own whipped cream and I just don't prefer theirs, or the whipped cream was spoiled. Other than texture and the whipped cream the dessert tasted fine.  

We had also ordered a royal milk tea and asked if we could receive it at the end of our meal. Someone that wasn't the server handed us the drink before we even got our meals. The drink was probably the best thing we got but we did want it towards the end.",F349NTO-f_Xgg0CHnwKzBQ,1,0,3,Ixl1gMdgWSLEAg1SrAZojA
5652750,2018-06-22,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"First id like to say I love the artwork on the walls. That might be all that I liked about the restaurant. I had ordered the Shoyu Ginger Chicken ramen with extra noodle and nori. When the ramen came out it only had 1 piece of nori for $1. For $1 I could go to the dollar store and buy a pack of 20! The noodles weren't cooked all the way as they stuck together. After eating the noodles you could tell right away that the noodles aren't fresh and most likely came from the freezer. They were not soft at all. The broth was way too salty and it had no fragrance or taste of ginger at all. My girlfriend ordered the Tomo ramen and it was the same deal with hers as well. The only thing I thought was good was their Tomo Fries, oh and there staff was friendly too. But the ramen was so bad i couldn't finish it. I ended up asking for a to go container, but as soon as i got outside I threw it away. If they get fresh noodles that are cooked all the way through and tone down the broth with less sodium I think it would be much better. If you're ramen connoisseur I would suggest a different location.",3PMGU2uFMlvvge4f4uZjuQ,0,0,2,3-qlhVo3Ax3gR-TUhbr-Hw

However, they enjoyed their food and I enjoyed my boba from Enso which is tied into them. They offer almond milk for all of their milk teas for those who are vegan/lactose intolerant :) The chef was incredibly friendly and came over to our table and several others to talk about the food.

5937010,2018-06-17,0,HMSDOjt_KCyknzjQ9aI5Jw,"First I have to say, the service and presentation of the food was excellent. We did not even know about the free iced tea drinks but it was offered to us anyways. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The taste of the food is where I am having mixed emotions about, and granted that they just opened so there may be some growing pains in this area as well. From looking at their menu, I would categorize them as Asian Fusion. Below is my critique on the dishes that I tried - by no means is this to bash the place but more on to let them know where they need to improve.

Ramen Burger - presentation was very nice but the flavor just did not live up to my expectations - patty is a bit dry even if it was medium already and needed more flavor, the ramen bun was a bit weird as well. The fries were normal.

Tonkotsu Ramen - the broth was savory and the noodles were thick and al dente. I liked everything in this dish except for the pork belly

Pork Belly Skewers - the pork had an aftertaste and had no flavor. It was a bit chewy, the fat did not melt in your mouth like I was expecting- I was a bit disappointed on this dish

Salad- I loved the dressing and the greens, everything was good except for the dumplings that came with it- that I did not like- it tasted too starchy

The teas- the tarp & cookies & cream I did not care for, the rose lemon tea was the one that I did like.

In conclusion, you should definitely give this place a try to form your own opinion, I would go back and eat there again to maybe try the other dishes, but maybe not my first choice for now.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,0,0,3,BJrv5kN515O_Bfh65JP7kg
