The eggs were a perfect ""over medium"" and the sausage was flavorful. The hubby had the hash brown sandwich, which he said was tasty.  The place is clean, and it smells like cinnamon rolls when you step inside (which is what they are known for). We didn't have the rolls on this particular visit, but will try them next time. They are still working out some of the menu details, there was a little confusing language on the hash brown sandwich, but that's a minor complaint. I'll be sure to go back soon for some rolls.",gDk4t78yptRaTsAc1c2_ew,0,0,4,BatIKwVeV33kViBEdw2fXA

With the above review I was tasked recently to put together breakfast and lunch local business support Teachers Appreciation Week for Doral Red Rock school. Remembering how amazing Homies Cinnamon Rolls are and how community involved they are (saw pictures and spoke previously with Harold the owner of Homies) I approached him to see if he would provide enough Cinnamon rolls for our Teachers and staff for breakfast. He didn't hesitate a moment in saying ""yes, absolutely"" and further stating how much he ""appreciates and teachers and how they need to be shown"". I was a little concerned telling him I needed 60..as they a gourmet and further more our school is 45 minutes drive (at least) from his shop to deliver by 7:30am the day we needed them. He was so excited to donate and deliver what we needed! All of our teachers and staff were so excited to enjoy a hot perfectly baked (bar none the best I've ever had) Cinnamon roll!

The rolls are kept on display in a warmer. The pecan flavor has a couple of nuts in it rather than the prevalence I'd anticipated. The entire roll seems to be chewy, doughy, softness- and it's great but not my preference. Toward the middle it got a bit undercooked too, but all that same texture (and the overload of sugar) was too much for me to finish. 

For those who aren't huge cinnamon roll fans, they do have a basic breakfast menu- I might return for their biscuits and gravy, which they probably do well.

It's not too far from my work so decided to try it on a weekday. Three days later, I slipped my phone in front of my foodie coworker with the Yelp listing displayed and off we went for a mid-morning snack. We both got the pecan cinnamon rolls and coffee. We dined in and loved the buns! We briefly debated taking more back to the office, but the problem was we would probably eat them on the way and end up in a food coma. Like mature adults, we stopped at one bun each and agreed to come back soon for round 2! The service was quick and friendly and you can see back to the kitchen. Buns, as I mentioned were perfect, not too much frosting and not soggy like the airport/mall chain guys. The dough was phenomenal, so unlike the airport/mall chain, the cinnamon and frosting didn't have to ""carry"" the bun. Loved it!",_Bt3LewB0c1smELLqrE1KQ,2,0,5,n38pu1Ct8ZAw0cDX2nDNSQ

We were driving east on Tropicana and missed it since the store front faces east, however, once we pulled into the parking lot, and looked around, we easily found the spot. We arrived on a Monday morning, about 10:30am or so and there was one other family in the restaurant. Meridian was our server, greeted us as we entered, and allowed us to sit wherever we liked. Meridian served our drinks immediately and took our order. We both ordered the #3 breakfast combo - two eggs, hash browns, breakfast meat, toast, drink (included), and cinnamon roll. The rolls were delivered to the table first and were absolutely delicious. I will admit I had some reservations when they were served - the roll looked dry, and I was concerned they would be hard. However, when I cut into the roll (with a fork), the roll was very fresh and quite moist - the look was deceiving. The rest doesn't really matter, but I'll keep going...after finishing our delicious rolls, Meridian served breakfast which was cooked to order, hot, and sufficient. A very pleasant meal in a clean and quiet restaurant. Before we left, Harold came into the restaurant, immediately walked over to our table, greeted us, thanked us for coming in to eat, and took our finished plates.

We love an independent business and a sweet roll, so it was natural for us to be excited about this find. 

The woman working behind the counter was super friendly and the dining room has an impressive amount of space. We took our cinnamon rolls to go despite wanting to dive right in.

When it was finally time to dig in, we enjoyed the truly delicious cinnamon rolls. Though I do wish the icing was just a little bit more special than the regular powdered sugar icing fare. The bread of the cinnamon roll was terrific--soft but not soggy and not at all dry--just the perfect bite.

We'll likely come by from time to time, 
but we felt like the pricing was more than we could routinely afford for our family for just a regular occasion. We'd love to see an affordable breakfast sandwich added to the menu.

I can bake and I love my own Fresh baked cinnamon rolls with the cream cheese icing.
In addition, when I asked for the big cinnamon rolls the owner replied, ""they're rising.""  This is bad business. A good business owner would have estimated and prepped enough dough for a busy Saturday morning.

I had an omelet with ham and cheese. The food was simple but really good and well prepared. I especially enjoyed the hash browns. 
When the check came I noticed that I was charged for the roll even though I had not ordered it. I assumed that it was included because they brought it to me unsolicited.

As a lover of your basic breakfast, I found my meal here to be perfect.  My family was visiting Vegas from California and seeking good food off the strip one morning.  My husband has bookmarked Homie's on Yelp and it was a quick car ride from where we were staying at the NYNY.

We walked in to an empty restaurant on a weekday morning, so we had our pick of tables.  We weren't greeted and seated immediately, but I think they might be used to walk-ins who just come to buy one of their signature cinnamon rolls.  Once we got going, the service was friendly.

The breakfast menu is simple  (you can see some of the options here on yelp).  I got a meal that came with two eggs, bacon, potatoes, and a mini cinnamon bun.  I have to say that I am very picky about how my eggs are cooked and I always order them ""well scrambled"" or ""hard scrambled.""  Here at Homie's they got it just right.  The bacon was good and crisp, and the potatoes were delicious. 

Finally, the fresh mini cinnamon bun was a little bite of heaven.  (We also had some big ones on our table and they looked divine!) 

As always, my 7 year old had to use the restroom.  They were clean and nicely decorated.

Needless to say she wanted to try them so we went there for breakfast.  It is located on Tropicana Avenue near the Dollar Store (corner of McLeod and Tropicana.  Lots of parking.  Simple menu hangs over the counter.  Simple menu (cinnamon rolls, and breakfast items).  Wife and I ordered the breakfast combo (2 eggs any style, Homie's Hash Browns, a regular sized Cinnamon roll (your choice original, raisin, apple, pecan or a one with fruit), toast and coffee or fountain drink for $12.
Food came out and we were pleasantly surprised.  Eggs were done just right for our tastes (wife likes her eggs scrambled hard and I like my eggs over easy.  Perfect.  The hashbrowns were very tasty (don't need to add seasonings unless you need hot sauce or ketchup).  Crisp on outside yet moist on the inside.  The toast was terrific!  I usually don't care for toast so I always ask for jelly.  I got the requisite Smuckers grape and strawberry, needless to say, I didn't need to use the jelly.  Instead of toasting the bread in a toaster, the chef puts a little butter on the bread and puts it the grill, so the outside is nice and crispy and tasty without it having burnt edges (like most toast is done).  Bacon was to my wife's liking (crispy for her) while I chose the sausage.  The chef takes off the sausage casing, splits the sausage lengthwise and puts them on the grill.  So tasty.
As for the cinnamon rolls, we had to take them home as the breakfast was so filling.  The rolls were so fresh.  Icing was perfect.  Nice amount of cinnamon and not overbaked.  The chef told me that he bakes a new batch every 2 hours and ends of boxing the old ones (over 2 hour old ones) for to help feed the homeless and or to give them to Three Square to distribute to families.  Nothing goes to waste here.

Doing a search on Yelp I found this place. It opened at 6am. So I headed over there. It was about a 20 minute drive. It is an unassuming place in a plaza; definitely nothing fancy, but the cinnamon buns are great. I should give them a 4 Star because even though they serve breakfast as well that they don't do that until 6:30. So the next day I headed back there keeping in mind that they don't start serving breakfast until 6:30. I walked in and the lady who was making the fresh cinnamon buns informs me that the owner who does the cooking was out delivering an order and wouldn't be back until 8am. So again I was treated to a free fresh cinnamon bun and it was delicious. So again I had a second one. The staff that works there is extremely friendly. As well as Harold the owner. When he did return he apologized for not being available to cook breakfast, but when I finally moved here in May I made it a point to go back.

We ended up splitting the breakfast combo that came with sausage, eggs, and hashbrowns  which I added a few eggs to and the waitress split it up and put it on two plates for us. Very cool.

The cinnamon roll was by far the star of the show. The pecan delight was what we opted foe and the candied pecans nestled inside the rolls added a nice crunch to the decadent pastry.

Coffee was pretty good and I am glad I drank it black because you need the contrast with the cinnamon roll.

I don't like how a lot of places have stale, overly sweet rolls. But the one I had here was soft, warm, and had had whole pecans throughout it. It went well with their coffee, which was served in a paper coffee cup. I prefer it that way. Not sure why, but maybe it's because I know that it's one less thing to wash for them.

We went in on an early (7:30ish) Saturday morning. It was quiet. 

When you walk in you're greeted with the amazing smell of cinnamon rolls! And friendly welcoming staff. A guy even changed one of the TV's and put on cartoons for my kids! :)

We ordered the tiny tots grilled cheese w/homie treat (small cinnamon bun), tiny tots french toast w/hash browns, #2  and #3 (I forgot what was included...eggs, hash browns, bacon). We got our cinnamon buns before our food. It was warm, soft and gooey! So good!!!

The hash browns were the best I've had in a long time! It had just enough seasoning, crunchy on the outside, not soggy,  little greasy..but it was still so good!  

Either way, the portion was just enough for us.

We left with our tummy's full!

I called to see if they had any original left (I called after 4pm) and a kind gentleman let me know some were in the oven and that they would be ready in about 20 mins. Well 20 mins later I arrive and I'm greeted by two sweet ladies (it's always a good sign when the guests even greet you). One of the ladies let me know she was icing the cinnamon rolls and that they would be ready shortly. So I took a seat and the other lady let me know the owner was actually in the back preparing her meal. Not even a minute later he appeared with a burger in hand. He was very down to earth and talked with me until my cinnamon rolls were ready. It's not everyday you come across customer service like that.                               


Now, about the cinnamon rolls. They were absolutely delicious! I could be bias because mine were literally fresh out the oven, so I bought three (one to eat later and one to eat in the morning). I doubt the taste will be any different, but I'll update this if it does. All in all, I would give them a try based on the service alone.

Homie's offers a very limited selection of food to offer. And yes, they offer more than just cinnamon rolls! I ordered the #2 with wheat toast, hash browns, bacon, a drink, and a mini cinnamon roll. The serving sizes were very big and honestly reminded me of the steak and egg special offered in some casinos in town. The food was made to order by the lone cook in the back room and was brought out to us by the kind waitress that handled all transactions/serving in a very timely manner. Honestly, I did not have high expectations when it came to the food. However, I was pleasantly surprised! Everything was cooked the way I wanted it and nothing needed any seasoning. After talking to the chef, I learned that he had a very extensive culinary background and even starred in a food truck competition on television (I had forgotten the name).

What really stuck to me was my encounter with the owner. My group had waited a bit for our cinnamon rolls and just as they were finished cooking, the owner walks up to us and lets us know that the cinnamon rolls were not up to the quality is wants them to be and gave us a discount on our order to take out the cinnamon rolls. This pleasantly surprised me, knowing that the owner really cares about the quality of the product that he gives to his customers. Seriously impressed by this, we ended up coming back a short while later and bought some cinnamon rolls to try.

The cinnamon rolls were very tender and the icing was not too sweet. I'm glad we came back to try them out. With the amazing customer service, great quality of food, and overall amazing experience, they've won my heart (and sweet tooth) over! Homie's, I can't wait until we meet again.

4212318,2017-04-20,2,il0h5UFgcLiqEw8C6OOmtQ,"Living in the neighborhood, I thought ""Those must be some epic cinnamon rolls"" for Homie's to be going toe-to-toe with another famous local bakery just down the street. So Saturday morning, the hubby and I stopped in for a quick sweet treat. A single worker ran the front of the very large storefront & dining area; truly, if you and 70 of your closest friends wanted to dine on breakfast food simultaneously, Homies has the square footage. Cleanly appointed and remodeled, you'd never even know this was once the footprint of the famed Dive Bar. Two minutes after ordering the pecan cinnamon roll and the Awesome Apple cinnamon roll, we received our warm treats in individual clear clamshell containers for our 1 minute drive home. Those 3 minutes of anticipation were heaven scent - couldn't help myself, lol - these are the best smelling cinnamon rolls I've ever encountered. Not even bothering with a fork, I popped open that lid and began unwinding my Awesome Apple roll. Bite after bite I savored the bold cinnamon baked into the dough, the balanced sweetness of the glaze, the toothy tenderness of the roasted apple pieces. My husband and I traded pieces; he really liked the pecan roll, but I thought it needed more pecans. Still, I liked the texture, and it had the same lovely, balanced cinnamon profile as the apple. 

These are good-sized cinnamon rolls, I was getting full. Still, I looked forward to the best part of ANY cinnamon roll... The middle. But there was a problem. The entire core of my roll - a solid 1-1.5 inches in diameter - was raw. Not squishy, not undercooked... That dough was raw. You could smell the yeast and the cinnamon was no longer part of a pastry... It was a painted on layer of spice I could swipe off of the wet dough with my finger. I even tried nibbling at the dough but couldn't bring myself to eat it. Instead, I licked off the glaze and pouted that the best part was ruined. Luckily I had a hero willing to share the middle of his roll with me, but while his roll was not as raw as mine, his was still undercooked. I passed, and although he ate it, he eats a lot of questionable stuff.

Damn, Homie's... Your recipe is really tasty, and your prices are really fair, but both of those qualities are ruined by raw, inedible dough. I'm sure if we'd been eating in the restaurant and pointed it out, your super nice staffperson would've taken care of it for us but alas, we took ours to go. Being that you're literally the closest food joint to our home and you open so early, we will likely try your food again, but I'll probably try something other than your cinnamon rolls. This makes me feel sad, because that's supposed to be your specialty.",0daa3lYsz2iFumNX-Ay3Qg,2,0,2,3Dmg_XvPMcQUlBjRDs77Rg

We had taken a very early flight and all four of us were hungry and cranky, but this place couldn't have been a better salve for weary travelers (and locals alike, it turns out). It smells AMAZING in there- the cinnamon rolls are huge and decadent and displayed prominently in front. We were dining in so we were promptly seated and ordered a variety of juices and coffees which were served with a smile.

The owner is a former Navy baker who has been in the industry for a long time so he knows what he's doing, which is evident in the precision of his baking and the manner in which the whole place is run. Two of us got the #3 which was eggs, breakfast meat, toast, hash browns, a drink AND a cinnamon roll for a very reasonable price. My son got the French toast and hash browns which he proclaimed the best hash browns he's ever had, and I had the #1 and cleaned my plate. 

After our meal, the owner invited us back so my kids could see the kitchen and the cool giant mixer he uses to make those awesome cinnamon rolls. We couldn't stop talking about how awesome our experience was at Homie's and how lucky we were to go there first. It truly is comfort food. It's off-strip which is an asset both in atmosphere and price point. And you will not get better service anywhere.

We both ordered the breakfast combo #3 which came with eggs, potatoes, meat, toast, and cinnamon bun.  The breakfast was very basic, potatoes could use help, toast was one slice cut in half, and I got the sausage which was butterflied, which I really liked a lot.  The cinnamon buns came midway through breakfast, for which they apologized and threw in an extra bun.  I really had high hopes for their cinnamon buns since they we're freshly baked but honestly, it just tasted like the Pillsbury cinnamon roll dough in the tube.  I was expecting a Cinnabon quality and taste, but the bread was just dry and the icing was just plain sugar vs. cream cheese.

I wanted to like Homie's and rate them five-stars overall!  I will however rate the friendliness of the staff as five-solid stars, especially the male server.  However, the ketchup bottle and hot sauce (Cholula) bottle we're a few drops shy of empty, a big restauranteur no-no.

I wish Homie's all the best as I always root for the Mom & Pop's to thrive, but a few things need to be worked out, in my opinion.

Looks like they just opened not too long ago. No flashy furniture or decor. Just a simple place. Which I like. Means they put more into their food and ingredients. 

Portions are perfect and the menu is simple. Typical eggs, hashbrown, bacon or ham, and toast selection. Along with the option of a cinnamon roll (must try). 

Our last visit, the owner was busting his butt to serve all of his guests. He had someone helping, not if it was a family member or an employee. But she was standing around on her phone and drinking coffe, while helping occasionally. The owner was literally drenched in sweat from running around. Ummmm, lady, are you there to help or stand around? The wait for our service and food wasn't horribly long, on account that he was short staffed and his POS was down. But he was extremely apologetic and refused payment from us. He said ""I bought you brunch. I feel so bad for making you guys wait so long"". From vet to vet, we had to pay for something so we ended up ordering some cinnamon rolls to go. Went to Walmart to get cash (since his POS was down for the day) and shop while we waited for them to be baked. Upon return he was just pulling them out of the oven.

Homie's Cinnamon Rolls & Comfort Café
Homie's Original Cinnamon Roll
Homies Pecan Pleasure

Recently opened and thus far receiving nothing but positive feedback, a former Dive-Bar on East Tropicana converted into a Bakery and Café to the far left of a Walmart anchoring the shopping plaza, it was mid-day on a Saturday that the decision was made to check out Homie's Cinnamon Rolls & Comfort Café, a lone worker acting as baker, cashier and server in a place that could easily sit seventy as the Raptors took on the Bucks in the first round of the NBA Playoffs.

To this point offering only a limited menu, the Buttermilk Drop shops of New Orleans brought to mind by way of the combinations of a single style of pastry with a brief menu of Eggs, Toast, Pancakes and Potatoes, it was after a brief perusal of the options and a chat with the middle-aged woman that the decision was made to select the only two choices available from a list that purports to offer seven, a brief wait as the $8.47 of food was plated spent at a table with a patterned tablecloth that clearly once belonged to a different sort of dining room.

Hoping to someday serve as an event space with catering options, but for now content with a little bit of foot traffic that included three additional patrons over the course of a twenty minute stay, a look at Homie's Original shows a tight spiral with golden exterior and plenty of rise, the Cinnamon clearly applied along with a whole lot of Butter making for something that is moist but not 'wet,' the Cream Cheese Icing applied as a smooth layer on top and not with the mess of Cinnabon or other chains.

Moving on to the ""Pecan Pleasure,"" a choice made largely for comparison sake since neither the ""Awesome Apple"" or Seasonal Favorite were available, the additional 50-cents really only nets buyers a few cracked nuts strategically placed inside the coil before baking - not particularly a 'bad' thing for fans of Pecans, but also not anything all that different or particularly interesting for a place hoping to break into the market as a single-item entity. 

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  A good concept in an area not particularly known for its culinary offerings Homie's Cinnamon Rolls & Comfort Café would be well served to make sure that the full array of choices are available throughout the day, or to at least find some way to add 'toppings' afterwards, otherwise it seems like a one and done sort of experience compared to places offering a better variety.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,7,3,_zWtOsvjj3QD0h_xDDvBCg

It was quickly apparent that only one person was working the entire restaurant. My review is not based on him because he was working his ass off and was pleasant at the same time.

It took awhile for him to get our order. We had to call him back to bring us condiments. We had to call him back to give us silverware. One couple waited for over 10 minutes before he was able to take their order. When we asked for napkins...THERE WERE NONE in the restaurant. In the bathroom, THERE WAS NO TOILET TISSUE OR SOAP!!!! There is NO excuse for this. None...

The food was really marginal. Very marginal. But, I mainly went for the cinnamon rolls and when I ordered some to go, THERE WERE NONE (originals). I was able to get two mini buns to go. They were delicious, but I can never go again. BTW...the young man who was left alone at this place was running the register, waiting tables, bussing tables, and cooking and not one time did he wash his hands. He had too much on his mind to think logical.

I also had the #2 on their breakfast menu - 2 eggs (over medium) cooked perfectly, choice of ham, bacon or sausage, I chose ham, it was a bit greasy but still good. It also comes with hasbrowns and your choice of toast and then also a mini Cinnamon roll.  My husband had the biscuits and gravy, but said it wasn't very good, the biscuits tasted old and didn't have much flavor. So the waitress was kind enough to take it off the bill. He also originally ordered an apple cinnamon roll but they were still being prepped so he went with the original. We will definitely be back for the Cinnamon Rolls again!",3S6ejVkW4xhX9ZpT_CGQVA,0,0,4,6y8yXwZQcViroeFNdRWriw

I did Not! He didn't realize he ate em himself he enjoyed it so much. Cinnabons were SO.DAM.GOOD!,Hz23low3fSkDXXDY5yCBdw,0,0,5,TQ4adaybYzbe9lzIPXR6UA
5774121,2017-05-09,2,il0h5UFgcLiqEw8C6OOmtQ,"Dropped in here on a Sunday morning based on the reviews. Big room, with plenty of tables and comfortable chairs. Order counter and a display case of lovely cinnamon rolls greets you as you walk in the door. Friendly polite service from the guy behind the counter.

I ordered eggs over medium, toast, bacon, hash browns with a apple cinnamon roll and coffee. Coffee is served from containers on a counter, with a few flavored creamers. Nothing fancy here. Just really good food.

The food was cooked perfectly, and a special note that the toast is buttered then baked, kind of like how my mom used to make cinnamon toast. This gives it a crunchy outside and soft inside and was delicious. Hash browns also on the crispy side how I like them, with just a hint of seasoning. Perfect! 

The cinnamon roll I had to wait until later that day to eat because breakfast filled me up. The roll is very good. I'm not a cinnamon roll expert but I really enjoyed the apple mixed in. 

These are the type of restaurants I like to support. Mom and Pop style, located in an area not known for fine cuisine. Its not easy to find this place as it is on the far west side of the shopping complex, nearest to McLeod Avenue. Well worth a visit for solid food at a solid price.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,4,5,4,BPmK3diWcFmD78pe6hsylg

The cinnamon rolls are made fresh right there in front of you and i feel like that adds to the comfortable setting. Its like sitting at home while dessert is in the oven. The staff was friendly and the owner was as well. He came over and introduced himself to us which i feel makes the business more personable. We will definitely be back and take a couple cinnamon rolls to go,nG8IW53ueKupNjvqVsXKcQ,0,0,5,f-_57cwtfj6rBk6S7vteEA

Also, try their hash brown sandwich too! Meat of choice on choice of bread. Yummm!! Staff is super friendly and very clean. The place is very big too and lots of TVs to watch sports (without the drinks!)

There was only one other table and we had gotten drinks and ordered food very quickly. We got our mini cinnamon rolls right away and then an outpour of parties came flooding in. We all got the #2 which is your choice of toast, choice of meat, eggs, hash browns and a mini cinnamon roll. Food was delicious (like a home-cooked meal), service was great (she was wearing an Elway jersey), and the cinnamon rolls were tasty (soft and sweet) with reasonable priced packages to take home if you love 'em. I'd definitely recommend this place for breakfast if you're ever in the area. You can never go wrong with their sweet glazed icing!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,9,5,4,456GEW-Yxu531p3fXxcd4A
5915992,2017-05-19,0,il0h5UFgcLiqEw8C6OOmtQ,"First off the cafe is pretty big and spacious so if you wanted to come to the restaurant with a large group or family you can and there's still room for others which is nice. It smells really yummy as you walk which is another plus. It kinda reminds me of Cinnabon smell wise. But not the same in anyway. When you get a cinnamon roll from Cinnabon if you don't eat it right away it becomes trash, because it's turns hard as a brick after and hour of having it. I find that with Homies cinnamon rolls, they stay soft all day and taste so yummy. They're not too sweet where you feel like your going to have diabetes after one snack but they are sweet enough to leave you satisfied. Their breakfast sandwiches I think it's the #4. It's a hash brown sandwich that comes with what ever choice of bread, meat and scrambled eggs. It's really delicious. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it took a little while to get my order however the owner of the cafe was nice and gave me 3 extra little homies (mini rolls) to take home. I would definitely come back here.",MPKg_RFuThz5TPU7FjjVuQ,0,0,4,ueQ1umyabxYSV9svZzI1WQ
