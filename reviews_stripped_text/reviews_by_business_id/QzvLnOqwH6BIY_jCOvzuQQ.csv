503616,2015-05-11,0,QzvLnOqwH6BIY_jCOvzuQQ,I ordered 2 pizzas one hand tossed the other thin. When my pizza was delivered it was cold and specifically what I asked them not to do to my pizza they did exactly that... My pizza had no sauce and barley any cheese the crust was in comparison to eating a saltine cracker with pepperoni. When I called to voice my distaste I was offered a $10 dollar credit for a $40 order. My family and I consumed 4 slices (one a piece) & was willing to drive the pizza back. Not only was I not offered a full refund or an apology I was told by the manager she could only do a $10 refund when I told her that was unsatisfactory she then went up $5 and said she could do no more. At the least they should've replaced the order at no charge. I now understand why they have only 3 stars out of 8 reviews. Quality and customer satisfaction is lacking and as a franchise store I would expect more from their brand. Lost a customer,WU7INlzWN8haEhJvt62Bgw,1,0,1,P4cOXr8XRPH30TkJeQFktg
522921,2016-01-29,0,QzvLnOqwH6BIY_jCOvzuQQ,"Never been a huge fan of pizza hut in general but for 6 dollars for any toppings on a medium pizza I thought I'd give it  a shot. When I placed my order for pick up online it gave me a count down to suggest my order would be ready in 15 minutes or less. My pick up time was 6:22 and when I arrived just on time it wasnt quite done. I had ordered extra dipping cups of marinara sauce expecting to pay extra for but the cashier comped them for having to wait an extra 3 minutes for my pizza to be ready. Excellent customer service even though I wasnt upset at the time overage. Thats how you keep customers. Food was, hot accurate and surprisingly tasty for the price.",eQsb0vyh9ganpkGoBmp0uQ,1,1,4,z75lVMJAwrqFbwW0Dn0HNA

Why go to Pizza Hut when there are so many awesome local pizzerias? Good question. The answer is portion control. Those little personal pan pizzas are $4 and one of the only ways to get my pepperoni pizza fix without eating enough pizza for a small family and hating myself later.

But the quality is lacking. Picked up my pizza right as it came out of the oven and it seemed undercooked. Wing prices are good (8 bone in for under $5) but sauces are lackluster and meat to bone ratio is low.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,4,3,AvuUZ1w2Rw0Bi9ZbEDVUUQ

2649032,2014-07-20,0,QzvLnOqwH6BIY_jCOvzuQQ,"The pizza was decent and was ready at the promised time, but I was not satisfied with the fact that they did not provide us with paper plates or utensils. If I was eating at home or if they were delivering to my home, it would not have been a big deal. However, if I am ordering 2 large pizzas for carry-out, please have some paper plates and utensils on hand. They gave us approximately 15 napkins... Other than that, the pizza was satisfactory (although I do prefer other pizza places) & didn't make anyone sick, so that's a positive. I'm not going to say that I wouldn't go here again because of the paper plate issue, but if I am ordering pizza on the whim to eat at the park, I would not choose this place.",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,0,0,3,MySMoldQKPdPRf0P2KIRUg

3851387,2017-07-22,0,QzvLnOqwH6BIY_jCOvzuQQ,All I wanted to do was order pizza. I called one location based on MapQuest trying to find the closest Pizza Hut next to me. The guy on the line was very nice and courteous and sent me to another Pizza Hut location. After that I was transferred to a female at another location and gave them my address. She said they don't service my location and transferred me to another location. I was then transferred to a third Pizza Hut location and the guy over there told me to contact another location which was in fact the second location I was transferred to before the third one. At which place point he was going to find another location for me when I told him the number he gave me was the one I was transferred from. He hung up. Pizza Hut PLEASE get your act together and realize where addresses are on a map. It's not complicated or hard to find my address or to look at where an address is and if you don't know or have the ability to service.  At least have some proficiency as to where the addresses lie.  I don't know what's going on and think the robots will win....,wdptzCd80-RokFuaufVDFQ,0,0,1,ipP64F6a5JAVsyGW6SmSwg

Recently I ordered a pizza and I had about 3 or 4 different toppings, and I ordered no cheese ( and they don't have the gluten free crust which is the dairy allergy friendly one according to the allergy website they use so I had to do thin crust- yuck) 
I ordered spinach ham pepperoni and pineapple. That sounds like there would be a lot on top of it right? Yeah..no. there wasn't even enough spinach to cover each slice of pizza. The pizza looked like a barren wasteland of crust and sauce.

5136391,2015-08-24,1,QzvLnOqwH6BIY_jCOvzuQQ,We ordered a pizza for pick up around 6pm. We got the confirmation to pick up so we went we live like 2 minutes away so it didn't take us long to get there. My dad goes inside to get the pizza when he tells me that it's not ready because they had ran out of toppings so they said it was a 5 minutes wait 20 minutes later and my dad complains why it's taking so long and people were coming in like nothing getting their pizzas and we had nothing. Finally they gave us our pizza and wings and we come home only to see that they got the order wrong and out wings were so cold I had to heat them up in the microwave. We've never had a problem till now and I'm kinda skeptical about ordering there again. Which is a shame because I love their stuff crust,zyYbxZi5ptX3PZegTRwyRg,1,0,2,4M6DcfEFpf8EhX53UPqP4g

Received confirmation email and pick up time and NO notification that that we were ""supposed""to call and confirm... 

Showed up at our designated time to pick up the order for our staff with of course nothing even started and was informed we were supposed to call and confirm by the older gentleman working there. 

Horrible customer service and respect for time.  Would hate to see you call to make an appointment at ouroffice and then we cancel it because you didn't call us again to confirm that you really did want your appointment you already scheduled.

We ordered online and decided to pick up since they have a drive thru pick up, plus it saves on delivery fee.

She just stared like we were two aliens. Awkwaaaard! Anyways, my gf gives the name on the order and the girl says nothing ... just turned around and walked away. She comes back rather quickly (luckily) and shoved the box out the window. My gf mistakenly began to hand her the customer receipt copy and laughs and makes small talk about her silly accident. The girl literally straight faced says nothing then closed the window! We were like woooow. She must really hate her job. More than likely we will give it one more go around in case it was an off night and see what happens. I will let you know when that happens but honestly in no rush at this point. As for the pizza, it was ok and the onions and peppers where HUGE like someone didn't feel like chopping them up.
