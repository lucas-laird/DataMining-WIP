1579969,2018-05-22,0,5K5Fppbmvsw9znotxVOXng,Always disappointed when I come to this location. On top of that I'm always scared as hell im going to get food poison AGAIN. I know your saying why the hell go back well it's been a few years so I figured I'd give another try ! Food taste like it's been sitting from last night. Also the the cashiers there are young and inexperienced. They will ask you on the monitor do you want sauce or and drink by when you get to the window they take your money and completely forgot to put sauce in the bag or your drink. Get it together Charleston & Lamb !!,gdkuMEpnqPJGi7U8HJEKxg,0,0,1,btkcT4Hcr7mxDMgJCXIFcg

BRIANNA J

She embodies the 4 Ps:  Perky, Polite, Professional & Pretty!

She's the Cashier, and the BEST one I have ever encountered, at ANY Taco Bell® location!

She made me feel like I was her favorite customer and she told me these exact words, ""YOU are why WE are here!""

This company could not ask for a better representative serving the public, and you can bet that people like her will ALWAYS bring me back.

It is the EMPLOYEES who make a difference, with me!

I hope you are lucky enough to encounter her, when you visit.",EMqsN7DTFnR_VywY1SEc5w,0,0,5,tKLjEey6YkUGpj8rMDAXUA

this visit to taco bell was horrible I ordered the box meal and my two tacos had a barely any meat in them I wasn't going to pay for a cheese and lettuce taco so I asked for more meat and she said she had to charge me so I asked for a refund 

on top of that we were in the drive thru a total of 15-20 mins worst taco bell experience ever",FbN4sKq9n6j00st25Mc1PA,1,0,2,JsxjnvqA8DRpKqL9n8feOw

Order number 91 , 92, and 93 got called before me and some one else next to me had number 89 and was very upset that they lost her receipt or some nonsense they tried to feed us. We'll non the less it was terrible staff was terrible and I will never return! They need to definitely get some help in this location. Owners should be more observant to his bad reviews.",ufYpFNd3nESLO0zHRxQEfA,0,0,1,BJq-PTiXKFLLD0gOxGmF1w

I don't think that is appropriate because she didn't just show him her skin but she also touched our food with the hands that revealed her back. I am so mad she as well gave us the wrong order & a Mexican old lady had to correct her who was also working with her & as she rolled her eyes when the Mexican lady corrected her, she forgot our sauces, I will never attend this Taco Bell again in life & if I do I will make sure everyone uses safety procedures in handling food, it's really gross to say that she not only flirted with my husband, but also didn't handle our food correctly so it was thrown away by us. I would love to speak to a manager about my experience because I really hope this never happens to anyone else.",BQx-G45200vlTX1VE5aaQQ,1,0,1,0LvMkRLyALm97tjmjozkKw

I was the only person in the drive thru and it took them 10 minutes to give me my food. To top it off I live 2 min away and when I got home the taco shells were soggy and the Mexican pizza was soggy too. Felt as if the food they gave me was just sitting there for awhile and they just gave it to me. Did I mention I got food poisoning right after? Yeah never going back again.",g-WyJ2QpXRAflsyBptRFvg,0,0,1,kfYnXU7lNA4-UNphtYDqUQ

I went the late at night, and the manager told me to wait a min. 5 mins later they finally take my order. After paying I ask for hot sauce and the guy gives me 3 packets, for 8 burritos. Imma stick to the Taco Bell on Nellis and DI. You guys need to stop hiring ratchet ass people.",3EUpmimFxx1enxaF0BqffQ,0,0,1,Br_svG5c3jI_QSoVlXqBRA
