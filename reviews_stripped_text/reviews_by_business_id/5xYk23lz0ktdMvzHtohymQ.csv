125352,2017-03-07,0,5xYk23lz0ktdMvzHtohymQ,"Been coming to this Village Pub for years.  It's my favorite one.  I've had most items on the menu.  My go-to is the Sirloin steak special. You get a soup or salad to start, Sirloin steak with choice of potato and veggies.  It's usually spot on and if you order fries, you get thick steak fries.  The salad is usually crisp and the ranch dressing is great.

Fish and chips are really good.  Service is usually really good.  I would say it's been the most consistent restaurant I've been to for the past 16 years. 

Some tips, expect to come out smelling like smoke.  The bar is inside as well and this location has no real separation. You won't come out smelling like and ash tray but it's like walking through a casino, it will get on your clothes.  I'm a non-smoker in Las Vegas; you get used to it.  The food is worth it. I've never hung out at the bar here but it usually seems packed which is a good sign it's also good.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,2,0,4,qsx4d44jj0SaqeiTbhAGdA

Very old school menu, steaks, mashed, fries, salad, green beans, fish & chips, etc, but it is all consistently good, including service (very friendly staff) and the steaks are really good. I had a shrimp and steak dinner and so did my dining companion, which was very tasty and neither of us could finish. Gets pretty crowed at 5pm for the silver-set diners, but otherwise pretty quiet and very low key.

The food quality to price ratio is what bumps this joint up to five stars for me. If you want to compare this place to a fine steak house it might not fare so well, but when you can get a steak for under ten dollars that is just as good as Outback I think it's a score. The fish and chips are great and the best I have had in town by far (and I'm originally from Seattle). They come beer battered, crispy, and in a generous portion. Breakfast is great here too with lots of options.

Another thing I like is they have some lighter options on the menu if you're watching calories - not something you see too often at a pub/video poker place. They have some great salads for lunch and dinner, full meals with healthy side options, and egg white omelettes at breakfast time - and a lot of this stuff of under 10 bucks. Can't beat it.

As a bonus they have a selection of micro brews from Ellis Island Casino that are very good.

I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner - and even for a late night meal on the graveyard shifts. The staff has always been good, friendly, and attentive. The best locals bar food for the price, and still great without factoring the price.",fiKBdlTlZUVgWgUtCBwqHw,3,2,5,EIKYPZyF09UWxJhzPLjRfw

However, this place is the Old School Vegas type bar that doesn't nickel and dime you to death like so many of the newer places so that's a plus. Food is decent for the price but there has been times you can't get a late night bite to eat. Draft beer selection is bad... 

There are several much better choices in the immediate area for a good cold draft beer and good food at a great price... that are clean.

Surprisingly, this place is located in an upscale area but you wouldn't know it being inside.

The Pub certainly has the dive feel to it - red vinyl booths have a few tears and are quite rump-sprung.  The surly busser gave way to a very friendly, casual server.
I started with wings and they were great - just what I want with wings.  I sampled their Pale Ale brew and it was delicious.  The dining room wasn't very full, but there was quite a wait before our main course arrived: Smokehouse Burger for me.  The burger itself was delicious, cooked properly, juicy and nice accompaniments....Except for the fries.  The menu said ""Seasoned Steak Fries"", but they weren't even salted.  And you know you have to salt the fries when they are fresh out of the fryer or it won't stick.
The burger bun was nice and fresh, but didn't hold up and by the two-thirds point started falling apart.
I would be happy to have the wings again, but the dining room was quite smoky.  Even though the smoking was only allowed in the bar area, it is a small restaurant and they needed some ceiling fans or something.

Went in earlier this evening with two girlfriends and a total of three children. (We sat in the dining area) didn't seem very busy and there were two servers in the section. As soon as the waitress came over I felt like she was immediately irritated. She was very short with us and didn't seem to want to be bothered with us. We ended up coming to the conclusion it was because we had children with us. But I'm a little perplexed because they have a children's menu so she should be use to having families come in with kids. All three children were well behaved no screaming, crying running around or causing a scene to warrant such coldness. She would walk by and check on the other tables around us and pass us by. We all felt as if we really had to stare her down to come over and then when she would she was gone before we could finish what we were trying to say to her. Disappoints me because it's two min from my house. Maybe I'll try to come back with my husband and leave our son at home. But either way we are paying costumers and had well behaved children.

My family of four was seated at a small table that would have been comfortable for two, rather uncomfortable for a family of four. I did notice the couple behind us was seated at a four top. My son got  a squeezed lemon in his soda which he clealry didnt ask for. The waitress a heavy set red head was oblivious to the seating issues and later the food issues. I guess if she ever came came to check on us I would have told her that my sons burger was served without bacon ( which clealry he ordered) and was served with two bottom halves of the burger bun. I also would have told her that the busbot spilled water all over my slacks ,never apologized and never brought over anything to clean me the table or the booth. Upon leaving I asked for the manager another server( heavy set blonde woman) told me the manager was behind the bar when I went up to the guy she pointed to and asked him if he was the manager he said "" No Im the bartender"" when I asked if I could speak to the manger/supervisor he told me  there wasnt one, when I asked him who was in charge he told me"" the girls"". Hence if you leave your servers in charge of food quality and customer service chances are ther will be some issues. Perhaps becuase we had a coupon that guaranteed 18% gratuity our server didnt really see the need to do her job as she was already quaranteed her tip.  I sent an e mail to the location and told them  what a lousy experience I had,I guess they couldnt be bothered with e mailing me back.

They get pretty busy so dont be surprised if there is a wait. They also usually only have 2 servers working at a time, so service can be a bit slow. The waitresses are always very friendly though, and when the service is good it makes the wait for food more tolerable.The only negative thing I have to say is the fact that there is nothing separating the bar from the dining room.

I have only ever ordered breakfast here because they have an extensive menu ranging from omelets, skillets (my fave!), paninis, wraps, and traditional breakfasts: steak/ham and eggs, pancakes, chicken fried steak, corned beef hash, biscuits and gravy, French toast, eggs benedict - you name it, they got it!

Last week's visit included a breakfast burrito, which was HUGE! This bb was overloaded with eggs, bacon AND sausage, cheddar cheese (ahhhhh), big chunks of seasoned potatoes, onions, salsa and sour cream and was absolutely delicious! My friend ordered the ham and eggs and the ham covered the entire plate. It seriously was enough for 3 or 4 people. 

I've even ordered oatmeal which comes loaded up with cranberries, brown sugar, pecans and milk.

Now the lunch and dinner menu offers everything from bar food (quesadillas, nachos, chili fries, potato skins, etc.) to more sophisticated plates that you wouldn't expect to find in a small bar including pot pie, orange roughy, fish and chips, salads, chicken cordon bleu, paninis, different salmon options, steak and shrimp, and ribeye steak platters. A friend of mine eats here regularly and he swears by their food. 

Their specialty is burgers (and they'll substitute a turkey burger for you too!): Smokehouse, Yorky, Frisco, Southwest, Hawaiian, Texas and many more! 

Oh and they do wraps too! Not a bad little place and your wallet won't even notice it.

They started going to the Village Pub several months ago and have been telling me how great the food is and how reasonable the prices were, so I was looking forward to it.

I got the California Panini which had chicken, avocado, and Monterey jack. I got cottage cheese on the side. My food was okay but nothing to get excited about.

My mom had the turkey special, and my dad ordered the fried chicken special. They both had a cup of chicken noodle soup. They both really liked the soup but neither thought their entrees were as good as usual.

The downfall of the evening was the service. It was probably 15 minutes after we were seated before the waitress came over to take our order. It took even longer to get the food. The waitress pointed to people at another table who had been seated for a long time without being helped and told them, ""I'll be awhile."" This was by far the worst service I have received in a long time.

2360467,2015-03-30,2,5xYk23lz0ktdMvzHtohymQ,"Since we travel to the Las Vegas area several times a year, we always look for great little eating places that offer good food at reasonable prices. A few years ago we discovered The Village Pub on Eastern, near Wigwam. The food there was always excellent. As of late we've been staying in the Summerlin area and were delighted to find another Village Pub on Regatta - a much shorter drive.

This one is a bit smaller than the other location but had very similar decor - good if you like tall masted sailing ships like the brigantines and schooners. Unlike it's counterpart, the Pub on Regatta has no glass windows and doors separating the smokers at the bar from the dining area in the restaurant. You have to walk a hazy, stinking gauntlet of smoke and stale cigarette butts to get into the restaurant. There's not much in the way of modern air filtration so make sure you get a table as far back in the dining room as possible to lessen the impact of that acrid stench. 

There were six of us. No other customers were waiting. A server quickly greeted us and told us we would be seated shortly. Then he walked into the back, grabbed a cleaning cloth, and proceeded to wipe down a small table, straighten the condiments, walk to the back again, returning with and carefully placing four sets of silverware on the small table while leaving the six of us standing there watching for several minutes. When he finally seemed satisfied with his handiwork, he finally turned his attention back to us and walked us to our large table at the back of the room. Apparently, cleaning and resetting a table nobody is waiting for was more important than seating customers who were left standing in the doorway for six or seven minutes. Not a long time to be ignored.... Just irritating.

Once seated, menus quickly arrived, beverage selections made, and orders placed. Four had the 10 ounce rib-eye special, one had the bar-b-qued ribs, and I had an order of ""best fish and chips"" in Las Vegas. 

The drinks finally arrived amid apologies and thanks for our patience. No big deal. The food arrived within reasonable time frame. The first steak, ordered medium, came very well done and was promptly sent back to the kitchen. To be fair, the other three steaks were cooked perfectly to order. The side dishes, salads, and soups were also good. Not great, but good enough. And after the others were about half finished with their meals, the reordered steak came to the table and was also cooked to perfection.

As for ""The best fish and chips in Las Vegas"".... Not at this location. I've had this dish several times at the other location and they really were THAT good. At the Regatta location the first order arrived dark brown on one side, almost black on the other. I ate part of one of the three pieces, but the fish was dry, over cooked, and had a burnt aftertaste. I immediately sent them back. Shortly thereafter, a second order arrived. Not much lighter than the first, but juicier. The batter coating was oily and unpleasant so I removed it, and ate only the fish inside, which was at least edible. I decided not to send them back again because the other guests were almost finished eating. In all honesty, I could have gotten better fish and chips at some corner fast food joint. In my opinion the cooking oil was old and burnt, and the fish was left in way to long. These were the worst I've ever tasted and this restaurant has done a definite disservice to the Village Pub reputation. I will never eat at this location agaIn.... Better to drive the extra miles to the Eastern location. It rated two stars for the other orders that turned out well....",VqqWco9k-CPcQKFfLj4Jjg,2,3,2,DR8zJQnqq4vyXyPXgHehJg

And we had to wave them down when we were ready to order. I ordered a breakfast panini but when I received my plate it was on wheat toast. I asked the person who brought it out if they had ran out of the regular bread they make it on and he informed me that no the order said I wanted it on wheat bread. That was incorrect and my food kept falling out of the toast since it wasn't big enough to hold everything. I would also recommend making sure the booths are cleaned more. There was hair and gunk all over the booth seats we were sitting on.

We decided to have a BURGER instead of the chicken.   However, they have TWO parts to the burger section on the menu.   One is a Make your own additions to the burger each 50 cents for $5.99 and another section below for different prices which come from 7.99 and up.   These have certain items such as bacon, bleu cheese, jaleponos etc.      I just wanted a burger, medium rare with cheddar cheese and my husband just wanted it plain.   We asked what does it come with and it has a choice of steak fries, potato salad, coleslaw etc.      I failed to ask what also comes on the burger. 

When we got the burgers, I looked for the cheese and found a small melted quarter size spot on the burger, lettuce and two slices of tomato and a pickle on the side. 

The burger was slightly pink, I like it rarer, and was very thin although it was supposed to be 1/2 pound.   It was also VERY dry tasting.    

When we got the bill I asked the server, what happened to the cheese? She said she ordered it with cheese, but I couldn't even see 2 cents worth.    Then we saw we were charged 7.99 and 8.50.

If you've never been to Desert Shores, you may have a hard time finding this place, especially in the dark.  Big trees, streets that go in circles, and relatively poor signage all contribute.  If you use Apple Maps, you'll probably end up in Brazil.

I've come here a few times, mostly for breakfast/brunch.  The decor is, well, dated.  The service is generally quite good.  I've not sat in the bar, but that is the Casino section of this place and they do allow smoking there.  The dining area is separate and well lit.  More than a few ramps/stairs, so watch your step in the dining area.

My breakfast fav is the Country Eggs Benedict: ""Two flaky buttermilk biscuit halves topped with sausage patties, two eggs cooked any style and homemade
country sausage gravy.""  Eggs Benedict in name, only.  Well, it does have eggs.  Mighty tasty if you like sausage gravy.  It is not too sweet, not too peppery, and not too creamy.  Goldilocks & baby bear would really like it.

Fun tip: Switch out fries for sweet potato tots.  They be yummy.

1.  Waitress was busy chatting with a customer for a long time before even acknowledging our table of 7.
2.  Finally get her attention, place our orders and it took a while to get our salads.  When she got there with the salads, she realized she forgot the croutons.  We were about finished with salads when the croutons arrived.
3.  40 minutes later we are still waiting for dinner!!!   Finally, after 45 minutes and one or another of us reminding her we were still waiting, our dinners arrived.
4.  My dinner of grilled chicken and portabella mushrooms was dried out and tasted like the packages of frozen chicken you can buy at Costco - with that gross aftertaste of preservatives.  I took one bite and sent it back.
5.  My nephew ordered the steak.  Adequate until he pulled a hair from the plate.  
6.  Several minutes have elapsed and I am still waiting for the waitress to return to the table to see what else I want to order in place of my gross chicken/mushroom leather plate....  by the time I got her attention, whoever was actually consuming anything at my table had actually finished.  So, I declined to order.
7.  The restaurant Manager was not there, so the bar manager (at the request of our server)  took off a few items.  He should have taken off the entire meal.
I can promise that I will NEVER eat there again.  I went back in to be sure he understood that he really should have taken off the entire, mostly inedible..and those of us who did eat, did so reluctantly.  My family said this was the first bad meal they had there.  I am from out of town, so I guarantee when I am visiting my family again next time, this is not where I want to eat.
The bar manager should have done much better for us, and the kitchen help ... don't get me started on them.

Yes, this place is a bit tacky diner red... but then I saw Prime Rib for $12.99.. and I was suddenly OK...

Since my other friend were ordering the Prime Rib, I decided to get something different.  The South West Burger caught my eye: Angus burger, guac, jalapeno, pesto, pepperjack, and some other saucy thing I can't recall on a ciabatta. SOLD. Medium rare please! 

When my burger came out, it was HUGE, and quite adorable wrapped in waxed paper made to look like newspaper. But whatever, I'm about the taste.

Took a HUGE bite of this bad boy, OMY was it good!!! I don't if it was cus I was SUPER hungry, or this burger was SUPER yummy! The meat was perfectly cooked at med rare (which most burger joint always OVERcook).  

Juices were flowing, gauc all over my fingers, cheese on my face, and in 10 minutes ( I swear), it was gone.

I even made my friend try it, so I didn't feel crazy.  She thought it was pretty darn juicy and yummy too.  This was by far the BEST JUICY BURGER I had this year!! And for $6.99, shoooooot you can't go wrong!

O yea.. the prime rib was OK... but I sure was glad to have ordered my burger =)",ou_nE1efTxY0LoVW0Au-yQ,0,0,4,tFaHvYJe9cnvlqCZgWZZKA

The hostess stand was vacant when I got there and it took a long time to get seated--especially since they weren't busy. I nearly gave this a 1 star for what I witnessed though. A slender lady with a bun on top of her head (couldn't catch her name) was running food from the kitchen with a sucker in her mouth! She couldn't stop playing with it while she was handing out the plates. That's a heath department violation. Servers cannot touch their hair, nose, face, beard, mouth, cigarette etc. without washing their hands before handing food, food-prep areas, or anything that goes to a customer.

Pub shrimp are gone, chicken Parmesan had Swiss cheese on it! The pasta with it was some kind of flat noodle and there was little sauce. My fave ribs were awful, not the same at all and came with no sauce on them. Also hard to get drink refills here. Have retried several times  but not the same.

You need to fight your way thru the bar area to get to the restaurant, therefore your drenched w/ smoke coming/going.
The food  and service is generally good. Price/quality is phenominal.Where can you get a good steak/salad/portato for 6.99 all the time. Menu is vast, you will definitely find something to your liking. Service is good, many of them have been doing it for years, they know their trade!!

5567588,2017-01-13,0,5xYk23lz0ktdMvzHtohymQ,"We recently bought a house nearby and had heard about this pub from neighbors, so we were really looking forward to discovering a good neighborhood place.  A number of people have left positive reviews which I am sure are truthful reflections of their experiences.  Unfortunately, we drew the short straw.  After having dinner here, my husband and I were both violently sick all night.  The only thing we both ate was the fried fish, so I assume that was the culprit.  One other reviewer mentioned feeling that the seafood (in her case, shrimp) was not the freshest, and she was wise enough not to eat it.  Since ours was the batter-fried Fish 'n Chips variety, we didn't see the fish until we bit through the crust, which was very thick so all we really tasted was the fried batter.  After our experience with food poisoning, we will not be going back, but I gave them 2 stars because the staff could not have been friendlier or more attentive, the dining area is clean and comfortable,, and the prices are reasonable.  I am not saying that you shouldn't try it, just that you should be careful about what you order.  Although I had some of my husband's fish dish (and did not get as sick as he did), my entree was beef and it was perfectly fine.",pzIjJ7GYJ2-l2i-wG7b51w,0,0,2,KrO8pEqBGhv1Mt5opEDHkg

5892923,2017-08-09,0,5xYk23lz0ktdMvzHtohymQ,"A little mysterious, yet slightly appealing is how I'd describe this place. The outdated decor adds nothing to the ambiance, but the solid food quality is their saving grace. The restaurant was busy during my first visit, and the bar was pretty full too. One reason to come here is the Ellis Island brews, available on draft and served very cold. The Irish Red was surprisingly refreshing! 

It's a poker bar and will probably be smoky. The Pubs are known for their food, and I had a delicious meal, the pork francese. It was a bargain for  $11. The pork was flavorful and tender, and the accompanying rice and veggies were very good too. The meal comes with soup or salad, and the salad was an average, run of the mill iceberg but was pretty big. I also had the rib tips basket, and again it was excellent. Tasty BBQ paired with fries and cole slaw, and a good sized portion. The Pub's location within Desert Shores is kinda hidden, which is an advantage I think. The one thing it's missing (other than not being non-smoking) is a lakeside view. 
Parking at the center is easy, and I recommend coming here for a meal if you enjoy great food at reasonable prices.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,2,4,TQeIRSixSw-dvvOny-_hog
5949396,2015-08-09,2,5xYk23lz0ktdMvzHtohymQ,"First visit ordered Chicken with Portabello Mushrooms, Chicken Fingers and Steak Sandwich.

The Chicken Portabello was tough and you could barely cut it, it was as if it has been frozen and thawed quick in microwave. It tasted terrible and sorry to say I have been sick all evening from the food.

I did not order the Chicken Fingers or Steak Sandwich, but was told that the Chicken Fingers were good. The steak sandwich was tough and not good.

Needless to say the Steak Sandwich and Chicken Portabello Mushroom went in the trash.

Bottom Line... You get what you pay for, what a waste of money!

5978786,2014-02-26,0,5xYk23lz0ktdMvzHtohymQ,"I had a bad experience at this restaurant on 2/25/14.   Bad manager, bad server and bad kitchen.  This restaurant won't take orders to go over the phone, so I went in person to place my order.   I had choices of sides that did not include a baked potato, so I had to pay extra for a baked potato.  After I paid for my order, including a tip, I never saw my waitress Janett again.  My order was handed to me by a guy.  When I got home, exhausted and starving, ready to have my dinner, the baked potato was missing.  I immediately called the restaurant and a guy at the bar responded.  I had to call twice because the first time I was left on hold and nobody answered.  When Janett finally came to the phone, I told her that my order was missing the baked potato and she apologized and asked me to go back to the restaurant to get it.  Easy to say right?  I let her know of the great inconvenience she had created.

The worst part was the way in which they handled my justified complaint. The manager told the waitress that ""next time"" they will give me a free baked potato.  Really?  Is that their best way to compensate a customer that had to drive back to the restaurant because the waitress was an incompetent that failed to check my order?  Next time?  I am not a regular customer at this restaurant.  Do they know where I live?  What make them believe that there will be a next time?  I didn't place an order from a fast food restaurant.  This is a well established restaurant and they should know better.

I don't care for freebies due to mistakes of this sort.  No freebie can compensate for the aggravation  caused by a wrong order and having to drive back to the restaurant.  But it helps to deal with the frustration when you see a manager who shows a genuine concern and try to do something to keep a customer happy.  This old restaurant is located in an upscale community.  Where is the class?  

Village Pub in Summerlin failed in service and customer relations. The manager, the waitress and the kitchen were a fail.  No, there won't be a next time.",avis77imGr5t1EyCdppxUQ,3,0,1,Dk-dJkB4k7want61G6YvTQ
