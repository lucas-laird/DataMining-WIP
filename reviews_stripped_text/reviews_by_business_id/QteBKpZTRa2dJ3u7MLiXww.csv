The cashier asked you want everything ? I said yes. But never said it's $1.85 extra per each item! Then I noticed on the receipt they added . $1.85 x5 for saying yes everything. They put the standard dash of salsa, sour cream without asking me if I want sour cream on Mexican food. Guacamole on the tacos was more than the meat. The burrito had nothing extra on it that would warrant an extra 1.85 on top of the burrito cost. A big disappointment . Does not taste better than Taco Bell and about 5 times higher.

They use flour tortillas and are bigger than your typical street taco corn tortillas, so they're slightly more expensive. Two tacos here = about 3 or 4 tacos at El Gordo, so they're about the same price.  

The red salsa is also a must, It's different than most places, it's seedless and has a nice hint of garlic. Everything I've tried here has been great, and the Ceviche is very refreshing on a hot day.

Another plus for Los Tacos is that ordering here is much easier than Tacos El Gordo for non Spanish speaking gringos.

The portions are big and at least for the tacos, wrapped in two tortillas.  They also give you a lot of meat, so I usually order one taco and make two with the extra tortilla and meat.  My experience has been that the carne asada is the best, the chicken can be a little dry sometimes.

Let me tell you, HUGE disappointment.  I ordered a carne asada taco (3.50) with avocado (1.00) and no beans (1.00, yes i had to pay a dollar to have beans excluded from my taco!!!).  Overall, taco had no flavor. Tortillas were nothing special, Pico de Gallo was bland and the taco does not come with cilantro or onion.  The ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars is because the quality of the carne asada was good (no yucky fatty pieces) and the avocado was freshly made without any filler (some places add tomato or sour cream to make the avocado go further).

I also got a plain cheese quesadilla (maize/corn) and that was garbage.  Tortilla was drenched in oil and you can tell they use the cheapest quality cheese.  Quesadilla was so bad it is not worth another word from me.

There were people in my group that said the lengua and chorizo tacos were pretty good so I would try those instead if that is your forté.",X34sK9x0Sg-sZWx9M-cpAQ,3,0,2,KXJbeAnbT8PkCrvNbEHESw

I'm not the picky eater in the bunch, but I think that the kitchen here works at a fast pace and either emits or includes an unwanted topping here or there because of the fast pace... hey, it happens no matter which drive thru you pull into.

Both the red and green sauce are tasty, as are the chicken, carnitas , and carne asada in tacos/burritos/quesadillas. The plain cheese quesadilla is pretty full of flavor. The food is never cold, and the service is pretty good as well.

tip: watch out for the add ons.  Tacos & burritos general just come with meat & tortilla.  If you want cheese, avacado or sour cream it is $1 extra.  Same with beans..It would be extra.  Also keep in mind, when you order side of beans/rice to go...It comes in small Drink cups and the beans will spill.

Wait no, it's really just one. We absolutely have to get tacos from Los Tacos, no matter what. Hungry or not. Even if we wake up late and it delays us further from hitting the road back home. Los Tacos is his favorite taco spot of all time. 

There's nothing particularly special about these tacos. Cheese, beans, salsa, sour cream, and guac. Simplicity, that's what makes their tacos so great. Tacos made with really good ingredients. We ordered 3 each because we were pretty hungry. They came out to $25, which sounded a tad high. I had forgotten how huge they were. I got full off of one. So I ate two. 

Tacos are stuffed with flavorful pinto beans. They make a separate batch of beans for vegetarian dishes, which I appreciated. A layer of cheese is first melted onto the two stacked tortillas before the taco is assembled (tortilla, cheese, tortilla, cheese) The guacamole is one ingredient: avocado. And they give you a generous dollop of it. I drench the taco in that green sauce, which gives me a small window to finish it...it's a good thing my boyfriend didn't bring me here on our first date.",92QbGGM9PAyqtW_WVlehiw,7,7,5,nUXEsJ70EG5afElxNGAxVg

Los Tacos is a magical place, but every time I tell my friends ""you need to go to Los Tacos"" I get some push back that Tacos El Gordo across the street is better. My wife and I put that to the test and went to both tonight. Check my review for Tacos El Gordo too.

Los Tacos. The delicious tacos at Los Tacos. I will start by saying these are not normal street tacos. If you're expecting two bite tacos where the meat and tortilla are the star this isn't it. These tacos are about twice the size of a street taco (which is why they are more expensive) and loaded with goodness. 

Los Tacos does something special, while heating the tortillas they melt Monterrey jack cheese on the tortilla to make a base for the rest of the ingredients. The melted jack cheese on the tortilla is a special step that just makes their tacos so delicious. On top of that they give a small layer of pinto beans, a good helping of meat and a huge dollop of really good Guac. They don't skimp on any ingredient as the build a taco that is stuffed to the brim. 

The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is because they use a pretty average cut of meat. Could be juicier if they went with a different cut.

Also side tip: If you get a burrito ask them to grill it. Game changer. Cook there told my brother about it and it just steps the whole burrito game up.",ATiE5_7Md8S3yO3CbEHXWQ,1,0,4,CXZiowuw6QQnDmTvz4DZBQ

There food was delicious though, there tacos are jammed packed with goodness but don't recommend getting because it's so expensive and a little misleading, on the sign it says each taco is 3.50 and when you order it they ask you if your okay with everything, I said sure why not and they charge you an additional 1.50 for that so basically 1 taco equals $5 which is a pretty steep price for that other then that the torta is bomb I would recommend getting it extra toasted and the rice and bean plater was delicious I recommend this place if your looking for good Mexican food ( must try there shrimp cocktail) but it is quite pricey for what you get and the location.",9GZuYXv-GwPNYqHgpYWMvg,1,2,3,8A1vK9mqYmwnNdtvO-A4sw

I had the vegetarian burrito ($5.95) with added avocado (85 cents), which had to much cheese for my taste, but I ate it all anyway because it was so dang goooood. I put a big dollop of salsa and hot sauce (in the green bottle at each table) on each wonderful bite.

All one needs to know about Mexican in the context of what this place is trying to be is found in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles and its name is Yucas and they have a James Beard Award.

The torta I had at ""Los Runs the day after"" was made from something other than beef I suspect.  An old whipped donkey perhaps?  I hasten to think what else it could have been.  No only that but the beef-like-substance was friggin' grey.  The guacamole seemed as though whomever made it ""got bored"" and just left it lumpy, sour and without much flavour.

This place is probably best left to the locals who think this place is amazing.

I was pretty hungry so I was thinking the standard Carne Asada Burrito would fill me up based on the tacos I got last time. If you  refer to my pic, the burrito was not all that big. In fact, if you don't tell them you want it with everything (which is cheese, guacamole, and sour cream for an extra 1.50), all that's in there is just the meat and beans. So for 5.75 you get a tiny burrito. Add the 1.50 just so you can a little more stuffing in it. I paid a total of 7.84 with tax. Now I don't know about you guys, but lots of other places would give you a huge burrito for that price. So yes, I was a bit disappointed.

While I was eating, I noticed a majority of the patrons were Caucasian. Weird. If you go to Tacos El Gordo, its mainly Mexicans. So what am I missing? Are you telling me that Los Tacos is more of an Americanized establishment? Don't get me wrong. To me there's nothing wrong with that. It just didn't look right. 

Some other things I noticed: They don't have a salsa bar. They do have salsa verde in squeeze bottles on just about every table. I guess you have to ask them for other sauces on the side if you don't like the green sauce which I thought is pretty good.

Next couple of visits I will try the Shrimp Ceviche Tostada because I saw somebody order it and scarf it down. I was so tempted to interrupt their first bite just so I can ask to take a picture of it. LOL.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,9,8,3,oDnP9yDLjPOe4lUWb3Hs4w

I held off on the beans, but you can have them for the same $3 a taco price. My biggest problem with the tacos was the lack of flavor and spice. The salsa was bland and the meat lightly seasoned. Low on salt, which I heartily appreciated since too often bad meat is hidden by salt, but a little more cilantro and lime marinade or a peppier salsa would have made this an amazing taco instead of just a very good one.

 The carne asada is quality steak very little fat, delicious. 
The El pastor marinated pork serve with a little onions, delicious. 
The chicken tacos all white meat, delicious.

3400225,2013-11-17,5,QteBKpZTRa2dJ3u7MLiXww,"Well....
I have to admit I decided to come here because I was already tired and frazzled and Tacos El Gordo hasn't had a drive-thru window since soon after they opened. Gee, you'd think the last thing a fast food place would want is to cut off their fat, lazy customer base- just who is the ""El Gordo"" they purport to be catering to, anyway?

So, I saw the neon drive-thru sign beckoning to me from the darkness of the west end of the parking lot and honed in like a cruise missile. Unfortunately, it was so dark that I didn't see the curb and in my haste managed to slam my car up onto the island. No biggie, I'm sure the undercarriage benefited from a little barnacle scraping, but when I finally managed to maneuver into position at the ordering station, I was hit with a blast of Spanish-accented static. 

Yes, the system crashed the same time I did. (No connection). I figured it might be for the better, since their English is almost as limited as my Spanish and I could at least point and gesture in person. Nonetheless, I was growing increasingly unhappy.

Got some carnitas tacos, a quesadilla on a corn tortilla (MY-EEEZ!), and a burrito for the Anaconda. This required intense negotiation and the services of three volunteer interpreters, but I got my bag and headed home.

Until now, I always thought that the basic ingredient of carnitas was pork. Apparently, it's salt. How bad was it? I didn't eat it, if that tells you anything. And if you knew me, that would tell you everything.

In their favor, they were friendly and tried hard, and I can't hold it against a Mexican establishment in a Mexican neighborhood that caters mostly to a Mexican clientele for speaking mostly Mexican.

Their tacos were $3 as opposed to TEG's at $2, but they had more than twice as much meat. Too bad it wasn't edible. And if you agree to ""with everything"", that means cheese and sour cream and guacamole, (in other words, the parts that make life worth living), it will increase the cost by a buck and a half each! Whaaaat? Since when is cheese an extra on a taco? And the burrito was ok but smaller than you usually get for the price.

It was a bad experience, but maybe I'll try them again when we're both having a better day.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,5,2,2,R9LM9SYmEH7B57QjVovq1Q

The tacos are pricey, and it's true they charge for the extras (sour cream, avocado and such). So yes, you can get your tacos cheaper elsewhere. But after trying El Gordo, Pepe's and other places, I think Los Tacos still has the most delicious food.

My favorite is the junior burrito with chicken, and chips & salsa. The portions are generous, everything is made fresh, and the food comes out quickly even when they're busy.

My only gripe is the nickel-and-diming with the extras. Get this straightened out and I'm sure you'll get more 5 stars. I guess I can understand charging for the extras, but why charge me to remove the beans?? Does it require extra effort to exclude the beans from a taco or burrito? C'mon now...

The food is okay but boy do they love to charge you for anything and everything. If you want to remove beans from your burrito, they'll charge you an extra dollar. How does that make sense? They dont even tell you the extra charges.  The $6 burrito only has meat and beans, if you dont want a dry ass burrito youll pay $3 more. They should atleast let us know. With tacos they'll ask you if you want it with everything and if you say yes, they'll almost double the price of the taco which is already almost 4 bucks a piece. So if you want tacos with more than just meat and a tortilla be prepared chuck your wallet at the cashier. After we looked at our receipts all we saw was extra charges eveerywhere. I understand if you want guac or something it's always extra every restaurant you go, but they actually tell you about it. But seriously they charged us to remove a food item from our burrito, they didn't mention it or even tell us why. If they atleast say ""hey this stuff im adding to you order is more $, is that ok?"" We wouldn't be so upset. So all in all we paid almost $45-$50 for 3 waters, two tacos, a small burrito, small torta, and half assed nachos.

at first looking over the menu, the pricing on the add-ons threw me off a little bit. then when we were called up, the cashier already seemed annoyed with us. she spoke a blend of Spanglish (spanish/English) to us and confused my other half. luckily I was able to catch the translation and started ordering. 

I ordered the carne asada and carnitas tacos. I asked for no beans on them and she told me it would be an extra $1 charge for no beans. wait, WHAT?! since when does asking for one less topping COST you something? she told me they add more meat in subsitutition of no beans.. well what if I don't want extra meat? I had no energy left in me to argue with the miserable woman so I just said it's no big deal and to just give me the beans.

my other half ordered a burrito and the cashier asked him if he wanted cheese, avocado and sour cream which is listed on the menu at $1.50 extra for all 3 add-ons combined. he said yes, but asked if they could simply put the sour cream on the side. instead of charging him the $1.50, she charged him an additional $.50 for asking for sour cream on the side. we racked up a solid $17 for two tacos and one burrito. this started to become a sick joke until she tried to upsell us on ""bottled water"" for $.75 which was actually water poured from a jug into a Styrofoam cup instead of the water from the fountain/tap. NO THANKS. 

unlike tacos El Gordo, there is no pepper/lime bar. with how unhappy all the workers looked, I didn't even bother asking them. the quality of the food was mediocre.

I was going to get the mixed seafood, octopus, oysters, and shrimp but I had a language problem last night with the nice senora at the register.  I ended up with a shrimp only cocktail but it was everything I wanted!

I got their small size which is called medium for some reason.  There is no small!  The preparer takes a good sized mug and she puts two and a half ice cream scoops of medium sized shrimp in the mug.  Then she adds some pico, an avocado diced in small pieces and fills the entire mug with a tangy tomato sauce.  The pico is fresh cubed tomato, celery, and onions.

With this beautiful mug, you get a basket of chips with a half lime for your cocktail.  Also, the required hot sauce, in this case, Tapatio is put on the pick up counter next to the mug and the chips.  OK, you never have to twist my arm when it comes to hot sauce.

I ate the cocktail in what could have been record time.  What wonderful flavors!  Now I know what I'll do when I get the urge again.  There's another Los Tacos on West Sahara, much closer to me.  I'll go there and get the mixed seafood, large this time, and I'll make a stop somewhere else, El Pollo Loco perhaps, for my gringa wife.

This is not just a regular quesadilla that you can get anywhere, this particular quesadilla is made with a flour tortilla on the grill, when its all golden on the outside and gooey cheesy on the inside and they put carnitas, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, rice and hot sauce inside...it is yummy in my tummy goodness!!

Oh, why oh why, have I not ever found Los Tacos before???  I had to make so many trips back to SF to get my oh so favorite Gordo's quesadilla cause I thought no one else could make it like them!  And I've tried! I've made the request to so many places out in Vegas, only to be let down every time....

Thank you Los Tacos for bringing my hometown so much closer to me, cause now every bite of your carnitas quesadilla, I can close my eyes and be in heaven!!

Oh- and their ceviche is pretty darn good too, but, I can't even think about that now that I know where I can go when I crave MY quesadilla!!!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,3,1,5,I6LRsONogRtqYvZmEtcnsw

Once again I went through the drive-thru. I will offer this information: in the drive-thru they can't see you and by that I mean you will most likely be greeted in Spanish (even if you don't know a lick of it). But no worries, I placed my order in English and there was no problem. I decided I wanted to try the carne asada taco and carnitas taco. I have heard the carne asada is superb here.

Here are the pluses: the tacos are BIG and very filling. However, I was disappointed in both of the meats. First off the carnitas were very, very fatty. I kept getting big globs of fat, not just little pieces here and there. The carne asada was better, but salty. Very salty. The salt was overpowering the natural flavor of the meat.

I've kind of had mediocre experiences at Los Tacos while my experiences at Tacos El Gordo have rated higher. Since they're both in the same parking lot I think my business is going to go to El Gordo from here on out. 

Oh, but I will give them this awesome plus: their beans are perfectly cooked and tasty and not refried beans! A very refreshing difference from the refried variety.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,3,_anq3YYMH1sqe_8LUPj7Bg

4484323,2010-04-07,0,QteBKpZTRa2dJ3u7MLiXww,"Los Tacos is a popular Mexican fast food restaurant with East side and West side locations. I have been eating here ever since I found out about it early last year because it is good, cheap, and refreshing in that there are actually some healthy options. They even have freshly shucked oysters, which simultaneously grossed me out and intrigued me on my first visit. Judging by how crowded the place was, I could tell they had the turnover necessary to serve fresh seafood, but I chose shrimp instead (on a later visit I had the oysters, which were certainly fresh but of too large a variety for me to enjoy without copious amounts of hot sauce).

Although I always eat some of what my husband gets each time we go, I stick with what I had that first time, the tostada di camaron (shrimp tostada, $4.24), because it is as delicious as it is light. It consists of a freshly fried corn tortilla (that's the tostada) topped with fresh shrimp ceviche and their finely chopped house pico (I add sliced avocado for an additional $0.85 because it is always perfectly ripe and adds a creamy component). It is served with a juicy lime that I squeeze until only the pulp remains, and I like to top it all off with a few dashes of hot sauce to give it a kick. It is satisfying and unchanging, like everything else on the menu, but unique because it's hard to believe you're in a fast food place. 

The burritos are probably the best thing you can get if you want something more filling, which you can have stuffed with either pork (al pastor), steak (asada), shredded chicken (pollo), or beef head (cabeza). The cabeza is actually really flavorful but it is also rich and somewhat of an acquired taste. We tried it once and enjoyed it but have not ordered it since. This time my husband opted for two chicken soft tacos ($3/each), which were also great but messy. Their chicken is incredibly tender and they go through the extra step of grilling the inner corn tortilla of each taco before stuffing it which gives it a nice toasty flavor and melts the cheese (traditional tacos come with two corn tortillas because the idea is that you pick up the inner tortilla and eat it first, allowing the filling that escapes from it to fall onto the second tortilla so you can have another taco). You can opt to add extras such as sour cream (crema), salsa, cheese, but each one will cost you $0.45. You can also add avocado ($0.85) or rice and beans ($2). They ask you if you want everything when you order ($1.50), but if you agree know that this just includes cheese, avocado, and sour cream. These little extras can add up and make your meal not quite so frugal, and it's a little frustrating they charge $0.75 for a cup of water, but you'll still be able to enjoy a great meal for a good price.

As stated in Bella C's post, this place is in the same lot as Tacos El Gordo, so you've got options here. Los Tacos is a more premium-ish place than Tacos El Gordo, and their meat shows it. The meat is more tender, delicious, and is fully complemented by their delicious toppings. (El Gordo is a lot more no-frills!)

I personally come here and always order the carne asada burrito with a drink. The prices are a little higher than Tacos El Gordo, but they're still pretty good.

The adobada had a lot of chopped pineapple and tasted more like a pineapple taco. To add to that, the white corn tortillas were not good at all. In my opinion, you can't have a good taco without a decent tortilla!

I didn't mind paying 4 dollars for a taco since they were served well. The one thing that did upset me was the they charged $.30 per taco to hold the beans (we paid for a large party so the $.30 per taco really added up!). I am used to being charged for adding toppings, but to charge me for taking stuff off, now that's just crazy! Thanks to your miser ways, we won't be going back anytime soon.

I prefer Tacos El Gordo anyway, which is right next door. Where you can customize your tacos and don't get nickled and dimed for getting what you like.",ryWcsNSLOB5E9zKadAEk_A,0,0,3,O8FbN9Khsi3v4jMOJ4j6iw

Since the carne asada seems to be the most popular item, the BF and I decided that to try that out. You can get the basic with just some meat, onions, cilantro,pico or you can do ""with everything"" which is avocado and crema which is $1.50 more. There was some beans in there and I'm not sure if that is something that comes basic or part of the ""with everything"" since it's my first time. Overall this was tasty, loaded full and big of a taco so I didn't feel that it was a rip off at $4.50  for one. I love the double tortilla with crispy cheese between as it lends another texture to the whole bit. That's definitely something that sets this apart is there is a lot of flavors and texture play. The green salsa bottles on the table look a bit suspect, but its garlicky and zesty good so I'll risk food borne illness and squeeze some onto the melange.

Apparently the seafood cocktail is great here, but it looks huge so we got a tosada de ceviche fish instead.  I was wondering why it was taking a bit, but it looked like from where I was sitting she was mixing it up fresh and cutting up the avocado? It was pretty good as far as ceviches go. 

Overall pretty good. I would go again and glad there are a few locations around town in case I want a unique taco.

Most places include sour cream and cheese with no additional price, asking if you want everything because some people do not want the sour cream and cheese.  I was surprised when the total came to $31 so I asked the cashier why it was so much. It was explained to me that the price on the drive through menu is for just a plain burrito without the sour cream, cheese, guacamole.  When I got home, I reviewed the receipt. $1.98 per burrito and per taco for the ""extras""; for an additional charge of approximately $8.  If I am paying that much for ""extras"" I would expect the quantity to be generous; instead there was not even enough cheese to be identified as having been added.  The sour cream and guacamole were there, however, after a few bites it was just the meat and beans.

Of course, the video game would be quite frustrating without the real deal taco as a reward. My suggestion is to create your own real life video game and venture out around town to find that taco. We did this one night. We started at the taco cart on Sahara, which you should definitely try one night when it stops raining! However, we ended up at Los Tacos based on the recommendation of a hometown boy who knows his tacos.

We confirmed that he does indeed know his tacos, as the tacos at Los Tacos are top notch. Generous is an understatement when describing the pile of goodness they put on your tortillas. Lengua was tender and flavorful and so was the chicken. They double up the tortilla and put cheese between the two tortillas. Strong call Los Tacos. Beans are delicious. 

We arrived late so we had to choose and eat swiftly, but despite our lateness, the staff was very friendly.

I'll admit. We wanted to go to Tacos el Gordo, but it was WAY too busy, and we were WAY too hangry to wait.

We ordered:
1 Al pastor taco
1 chorizo taco
1 carne asada taco 
1 shrimp torta.

So...the food was good.  Definitely not the best tacos I've had, that title still remains with Taco y Taco.  The chorizo was by far the best taco.  They are normal sized street tacos, and they are absolutely packed with meat, and toppings.  
The torta was awesome. COVERED in shrimp.  Most place will skimp and give you more salsa or toppings than shrimp, but this was perfection.

The reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 is honestly the fact that they upcharge for toppings.  

Tacos START at $3.50, and then you add 50 cents for each topping:  cheese, crema, and avocado.  $4.50 per taco for me is a little spendy.  Sorry.  It just is.  And they don't tell you about the upcharge.  They just ask what toppings you want, and then you see the extra 50 cents on your receipt.  

Service was strange.  The girl who rang us up was short with us.  Not overly rude, but definitely not friendly either.  

So...while the food was good, I probably won't come out here again.  I'd rather drive a bit further to Taco y Taco and get more for my money and better flavors.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,7,3,3,MNARH7ytAAgML9FrIT5AYQ

Whenever, I'm in town or my friends visit I make sure to take them! My current favorite on menu is a vegetarian burrito with everything on it with chips and salsa with a medium horchata.

But for me the loyalty towards this restaurant goes further than it being just a place to grab a quick bite. A little over a year ago, a dear friend of mine got into a horrible car accident. (She was part of a group of my friends/coworkers that regularly went there). The Los Tacos answered to the tragedy by donating towards her treatment. They didn't have to but they did and that kindness is something I always remember when I go there (or any location of there's ). 

The staff is very friendly and in my eight years going have only had one negative experience (I blame my friend for that one lol.)

They even charge for jalepeños.. not only that, they don't even have a salsa bar.. we came in right before closing time and it seemed like everyone had a sour attitude. Maybe because they wanted to take the last 30mins of their shift easy who knows. the food was okay. Just didn't appreciate the poor attitudes. I thought it was strange they were spraying cleaning products next to the stove area where the food was being cooked prepared.",8H0mjq2f3tn0gZ3sj1M3-A,0,0,2,T_nfFv7i00Y7gEiQ5f80lg

Atmosphere is casual and fast food like and like most great taco shops it's in an older neighborhood (more hoods than neighbors though). Way worth the drive but the one on Sahara is owned by the same family. The owner was nice enough to comp my cousin and I a shrimp cocktail aka Mariscos, so we could experience the love. No complaints, I could have got caught up in a driveby and it still would have been worth the tacos and mariscos.",82Q9vX7KBbovF4IP4NYT6w,2,2,5,YBuX7Yi2nccR7D9DFakrsw

Everything is fresh and juicy, seriously, keep the burrito wrapped up until the last bite or you'll be wearing it.  I haven't tried anything else for fear of it not being as good as the burrito.  I like that they offer a junior burrito size which is typically filling for lunch.

Personally, I've never been for dinner but have heard various complaints from others about the food during this time.  So, go at lunch time, the food is the freshest and unless you like waiting for your food and a place to sit, get there before noon.",W36hPAvKxSm03Rpvo8eQJg,3,1,5,N1OwNWrGQtvUNj6dAyWRLA

 I agree with some people mentioning it's pricey but seriously, it's reasonable. I mean, you want quality food then you pay for quality food. For instance, it's like Mortan's Steakhouse, if you order a rib eye steak, you going to pay at least $100 at Mortan's for one. But the quality and flavor is there and thats what keeps you coming back for more. There are so many cheapsakes out there that rather eat crapy food for cheap and complain about this place, instead of comparing the quality of food to other places and realizing that this place is actually reasonable.
 Also, the variety of the food they offer is exceptional. Always FRESH!! Made for the vegetarian, the meat lover, the kids, and of course for you and me. 
Furthermore, the customer service here is phenomenal. I happened to meet the owners wife(and mother of his children) and not only is she appealing and charming, she was extremely delightful, young and reverent. I haven't seen her recently (which I hope she comes back soon) but it's ALWAYS a pleasure to walk in and see her there smiling lovely. Her helpfulness is gratifying and you can see how it rubs off on the other employees. It's great to know that this is a family owned business working together. The relaxed, at home ambiance of the restaurant is always captivating. I recommend this place immensely.

1 Chicken quesadilla( very filling)-3/5 because it was too oily

1 Chips and Salsa-4/5

Service is friendly and quick (when you order inside). These employees are always hustling and this location tends to be consistently busy. But I will say, the drive thru is insane. Even if you're the only car in the drive thru, be prepared for a LONG wait time. So you're better off getting out of the car and going inside to order. 

This is a solid spot. Always come here at least a couple times a month, unless I'm trying to eat clean. Be sure to try the watermelon drink as well, so refreshing! Also, they charge for EVERYTHING. So add ons add up real quick!",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,0,2,4,pPNPhP_Sf4W2GprCU3kixw
