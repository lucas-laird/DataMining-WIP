84286,2014-07-26,1,Rxz2YpeLr9Ek54Lt5z6h0A,"If you are looking for decent food, at decent prices, away from the craziness of the strip, this is a great place to try. 
The food is not gourmet but it tastes good, and the prices are reasonable. I had a 3-egg omelette (ham, cheddar, onions, mushrooms) that came with country potatoes and toast, for $6.99. The omelette was perfectly made, super tasty, and big. The potatoes were tasty, made with bell peppers and onions, however some of them were not quite cooked through and hard. 

My kids shared the ""Monster burger."" One pound (cooked) of meat, cheese, with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, & mayo on the side. Plus a full order of fries, all for $9.99! I felt the meat was a little bland, could have used more seasoning. But it was by no means bad or inedible. If you an eat everything on the plate (by yourself of course) you get a certificate. 

I've eaten a few things in their menu and everything was pretty good. The casino and restaurant themselves are definitely not glitzy or glamorous, but the food is good and it won't cost an arm and a leg to feed a family (or yourself after a bad night at the tables!) 

The only complaint I have is that they charge  a $2.00 fee to split a plate or box it to go, and they absolutely do NOT allow substitutions on menu items, if you want onion rings instead of fries with your burger, you pay full price for the onion rings and they bring the fries even if you ask them not to.",h1ga_hkgz_rLktfL84ZdCQ,1,1,4,1CjNG459OSlCs8avJFCc7A

Aside from it's location and the seemingly unhappy and borederline ""could-give-a-shit-about-this-job"" waiter we had, I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was for the price I paid.

I absolutely LOVE Ribeye Steak and have had them at many price points at many different restaurants across the valley. The steak here was tasty, tender, and juicy and so was the Prime Rib. I am definitely going back and anxious to try their other menu items.

467308,2013-10-24,2,Rxz2YpeLr9Ek54Lt5z6h0A,"We had seen the sign, $5.99 Steak Dinner, but hadn't gone in -- the place looks so divey, how good could it be? Then we checked the other Yelp reviews -- nearly everyone gave this place 4 stars -- and rightly so.  We visited the Longhorn Casino at 10 PM on a weekday, a time when you'd go hungry at the much larger Sam's Town casino across the street.

It wasn't the ambience -- Wal-Mart has greeters, this place had a hooker almost blocking the front door, begging for $2 because her ""boyfriend just left her."" And the people behind us somehow managed to have security read them the Trespass Act, photograph them, and boot them off the premises!

The food totally makes up for the ambiance (or utter lack thereof). A lengthy menu features ribs, trout, prime rib, 1-pound burgers, you name it. We had the ribs-chicken-brisket special (not on the menu, on a sign above the cashier); and also the Cajun prime rib. A calendar lists daily specials as well. Finish the 1-pound burger and win an unspecified prize. Creamed chipped beef (""SOS"") is offered 12M-noon for $4. Steak and lobster, prime rib and shrimp, whatever combination suits your fancy, they have it.  The baby back ribs, brisket, and prime rib were tender and succulent; ""Tell them they have great iced tea,"" says the wife. The bill came to $33 of which $8 was for iced tea and side orders of cole slaw and tomatoes. The dinner rolls were homemade.

Among other things we liked, there's no Bataan death-march through a huge casino to get to the restaurant, the total distance was about 50 feet from car to table; and you don't have to sign up for a casino player's card to get their best deals. Speaking of great deals, they have $2 live blackjack and their rules are more liberal than at Sam's Town (among other things they allow resplitting aces and doubling down after splits).",df616h7n58jbHfYO5OdbvA,2,3,4,cnxbe4XkViURqi7gOeSxsA

1641793,2017-09-16,0,Rxz2YpeLr9Ek54Lt5z6h0A,"This may well seem an unlikely stop for someone who just did Fogo de Chão the night before. I suppose I could call it an effort at dollar-cost-averaging. 

Really my motivation was that I noticed earlier in the day that Las Vegas guru Anthony Curtis (of Las Vegas Advisor) had recommended their diner deals in a blog, and with quite some detail about his visit on the property. Curtis is huge in the Vegas-insider business; constantly touting unfound bargains (& happenings) in this town ... and so I figured he's wasn't going to high-risk his rep on a joint too easily. So I made sure I passed by it on the way home from errands.

This diner/coffee-shop is inside the budget & locals-minded Longhorn Casino & Hotel, on Boulder Highway, just across the street from Eastside Cannery. I certainly wasn't expecting much in terms of ambiance or upscale clientele ... and I wasn't disappointed in that respect. As example, there was a line of gamers waiting to cash (and likely lose) their paychecks - for which they were entered into a drawing at a chance to double-their-paycheck back. Not exactly the kind of gaming action you see at the Wynn. 

This is a very small casino, so it was a few steps to/from my car to inside the casino, then just a few more to the coffee shop. Good thing, as I don't think I'd want to be dallying too awful long in the parking lot ... or around the casino. The casino smelled very smoky, as in ""old-school"" Vegas smoky, but anything 'old-school' Vegas is AOK with me!

This was on a Friday evening about 7ish, so there was also quite a line for the coffee-shop as well. As you might expect there was a good bit of ""wagon-wheel"" motif scattered about, but most of it was just straight-up ordinary booths, tables, chairs & wallpaper. Service was just barely AOK, though my server mentioned they were running two hands short that shift. (Does that mean they are missing one person or two, I wonder.)

I went with the 10oz hamburger steak plate at $11, that included a small side salad up front, a potato choice, a generous helping of steamed veggies (broc, cali, carrots, squash, et. al.) and a huge dinner roll w/ butter. The salad turned up very quickly, but the entree took a while. I'd say the burger-steak actually came in at 12oz. Nothing exciting here, but the ground chuck was juicy and close-enough to my medium-rare. I'd say the score is that it was much-better-than-average coffee-shop grub than what you'd typically find in this sort of venue and/or price range, for sure. Out-the-door, water, tax, and tip ... right under $15.

Most of the menu choices here fall into the category of diner comfort-food. There's apparently a bunch of deals running 24/7. A $5 ham-steak and eggs plate, with the ham slab the size of the sole on a clown's shoe. (That's quite reminiscent of the deal I used to snag at 4am in Binion's downstairs diner many years ago.) A $13 20oz porterhouse dinner, though it showed as $18 on the menu. And a one-pound hamburger plate at $11. And there was a $6 soup-and-sandwich-de-jour deal. Today's sandwich was 'meatball sub.' I saw the meatball sub ... and it was huge enough to torpedo TWO Subway meatball subs straight into the bottom of the ocean.

I didn't partake, but Curtis said that, for the asking when paying your diner tab, you can get a ""your first card is an ace"" coupon for a $5 wager at the BJ table. (Vintage/old-school BJ at this joint: they still pay 3-2 here & it's a ""Tom"" ($2) table minimum.) This is the kind of proposition that Curtis is always eyeballing for & broadcasting. He makes the odds on this offer as actually in your favor, so that you should take a shot at trying to win back your dinner. (Of course if you win, you have to know 'win to quit.')

This first round visit went well enough, for what it is. So I guess it is now on the list for a repeat evaluation ""if I am driving by that way"" ... as either a quick lunch or as graveyard grub. But never again during prime-time hours, I suppose. Just too much traffic and too much wait.

UPDATE: I've hit this joint three times since the original review, each time taking-on the 8oz. $13 prime-rib deal. Entirely consistent. Each time, the cut looks to be more like 12-14oz. And it's all good. And I am still seeing a lot of other good-looking food moving around the floor. The menu is bursting with great prices. I can't promise you a single drop of ambiance -- it's a solidly blue-collar venue -- but the quality of the food here is five-star as compared to the price.

PROTIP: Park in back and you don't even have to walk through the (little) casino, just up a short hallway, then turn to the left, 15 yards from your car to your booth.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,1,1,5,ZrmrQE8PhdLaLinPSdS7lg

I read most of the reviews and they all say Longhorn Cafe or Longhorn Restaurant. When I checked the place out, there is a big sign right above the place that says ""Chuck Wagon"". So why no one has done a listing is beyond me. The casino itself is a separate entity but when you go over the reviews, about 80 percent of it pertains to the restaurant.

So here's the first offficial review for this listing.

Like everybody else, I was drawn by the billboards off of Boulder Highway about their food specials. One example is the Barbeque Combo Plate for 9.99 which consists of 1/4 Babyback Ribs, Beef Brisket, and 1/4 rotisseried Chicken accompanied by Baked Beans and a mini Corn on the Cob. Another is Steak and Petite Lobster for 9.99 as well. They also have your basic steak and potatoes for 5.99 which is not a bad deal.

I got the Barbeque Combo because the picture from the billboard looked rather enticing. The Babyback Ribs were surprisingly tender and flavorful. The Beef Brisket was ok and the Chicken was a bit dry. All items were topped off with a drizzle of tangy barbeque sauce which I thought was pretty tasty. The corn was your basic corn and the baked beans tasted like it was from a can.

The restaurant itself is a little bit cozy meaning they got a decent amount of tables and booths kind of crammed together. So dont be surprised if you have to wait a bit especially for dinner. I went on a monday at 11:45 am and only waited for about 2 minutes.

As for the service, nothin major to complain about or take my hats off to. You do get what you pay for in terms of service. I recommend you not be in any hurry if you plan on eating here. Overall, the staff is friendly from my first impression.

Some random info: These guys are open 24 hours and you dont need a player card to get the food deals. The bathroom is in the casino to your right when you exit the restaurant. Occasionally you will get a whiff of the second hand smoke coming from the casino, especially if you have a bunch of smokers out there on the slots and tables.

In conclusion, I will definitely come back to try their other specials and most definitely will come here if I have friends or family that just want decent food at good prices.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,13,9,4,PZaf0Ydk6-5SKbtOeRIV4A

I went for the Biscuits and Gravy, they were pretty much lack luster. I'd opt for one of the other two, can't really screw up either one of the other choices.

Also, they have an actual charbroil grill in the back, so the steaks and chops taste just like they came off the BBQ grill in my backyard.  I've tried their desserts a few times, and they are okay, but nothing to write home about.  Pretty basic cafe cakes and pies plated in a spinning display case.  

Other than their insane 1 pound monster burger, their portions are not huge, but adequate.

The place is clean, but it is in a very old casino, so it has the stale smoke smell kind of permeating everything.  If smoke bothers you, this is probably not a great place for you.

So, with tears in our eyes and grumbling in our tummies, we drove across the street and were lured in by the promise of a cheap steak dinner.

Now, we've been here before, many moons ago, and I remember it being...not bad... When we first landed in Vegas, with pets and U-haul et al, we actually stayed at the Super 8 that was attached for a week until we found a more permanent home. I'm pretty sure we ate here a couple of times, but it must not have left too great an impression. Or, we could have just been shell shocked from the drive down from Seattle.

Either way, here we were, ready to eat pretty much anything. Yeah, the place is a divey locals joint, that's part of its charm. The beautiful man who seated us asked what we wanted to drink. I ordered a glass of merlot and my husband drew a blank. The beautiful man said, ""You want a shot of Quervo,"" to which my husband replied, ""Yes, yes I do!"" We'd had a long day, see...

 Anyway, Husband ordered the BBQ platter, and I ordered the steak & lobster special. Nine freakin' 99 for steak and lobster. Oh, yeah. I wasn't expecting too much, but, still - lobster!

I've been to enough dive joints to know to order my steak at least one degree rarer than what I actually want. Which, unfortunately, is rare to begin with. So, since I can't order raw, I order rare and hope for the best.

The drinks came before we even ordered dinner, yay! Oh, and even better - they were around $2 EACH!

Dinner came stupid fast - before I even had time to forget what I ordered.

And, you know what? It was pretty good. The steak actually was rare! Sure, it was fatty and not the best cut, but, dude - $9.99! The lobster tail was surprisingly substantial. It was also tender and tasty, with lots of drawn butter and lemon. And, dude, $9.99!

The belle of the ball was the loaded baked potato. Cheese, bacon, and a plate full of sour cream & butter with chives. Oh, mama.

My husband's food must have been satisfactory, as well. All I heard was ""narm narm narm om nom nom nom"" I managed to yell, ""Save the bones for the dog!"" without losing a finger.

***

The Longhorn Casino itself is very much 'old school' Las Vegas in the truest sense in that it is a dank, dark, smokey dump. There are a lot of (decent) older video poker machines crammed in here along with some blackjack tables that you have to practically dodge around the moment you walk in. 

Your first thought will most likely be, ""Fuck this!""

Just keep moving ahead. The place is tiny and you can see the sign for the Chuck Wagon Restaurant right when you walk in. Make a beeline for that unless you want to try some very cheap blackjack with inexperienced dealers who might overpay you accidentally. 

The Chuck Wagon itself is decorated in sort of an Old West style, with pictures of wagons and John Wayne all over the place. Not that it matters all that much, people aren't here for the decor. Considering that the place is basically a cross between a family restaurant and the typical casino diner, the menu is surprisingly large. They have everything from salads to lobster to a full breakfast menu available 24 hours. There's also the famous steak special. It's not listed on the menu, you just have to ask for it. I believe it's still $5.99. They also advertise the Monster Burger for $9.99. You get a certificate proudly proclaiming your gluttony if you finish it. I've eaten here dozens of times and I've never seen a single person order it but I guess somebody must. The normal burgers, by the way, are pretty great for the price and they are very large plus you get a ton of decent fries. You will not leave hungry. Other items I'd recommend off the top of my head: the fish and chips, the cobb salad, just about anything on the breakfast menu and something they call the pot roast sandwich which is similar to the prime rib sandwich only much more awesome despite the name.

The best part is, even though the prices have gone up a little over the years, two people can eat very well here for under $20. Yes, a couple of the entrees break the $10 mark but if you're looking to spend that much then why are you eating here to begin with?

A few other thoughts. 

Even though the casino is old and smoke filled, the odor of cigarettes doesn't carry over into the restaurant. I'm a non smoker, I can't stand the smell of cigarettes while I eat and it has never bothered me once at the Chuck Wagon.

If you show up at the wrong time, you may be in for a long wait. This place is very popular with the locals and you can end up waiting an hour if you chose to arrive at noon on a Sunday so plan accordingly. If you do have to wait you can always spend your time losing money on the penny slot machines. 

The coffee is bad. Don't waste your money if you are used to anything better than Folgers. Unfortunately, the water doesn't taste much better. If you want anything with booze in it, they can flag down one of the support-hose wearing cocktail waitresses from the casino floor. I'm fairly certain alcohol isn't listed on the restaurant menu.

The waitstaff is usually very friendly but they are often busy and understaffed. Sometimes it can take a while to get your food. Be patient because it is always worth it. I've been here many times and I make everyone who visits Las Vegas go here. I've very rarely been disappointed.",sV5mnBoYod1LVNksODplQw,4,3,4,QqI3rKqdhbx8oB_RD5VRMg

Saw our waiter to place our order,get our drinks,get our food and get our check. Didnt ask if everything was ok didnt get a single refill nothing. When we mentioned to the manager that the food was good but the service was horrible and he said at least something was good. Would probably visit again because the food and price was decent and maybe the server was having a bad day but for the manager to have that attitude isnt cool and means I am not willing to try the service again, obviously service isnt important. One other note, we went during a busy time and its extremely loud in there.",Ido0RL0wDtbZB2eToWE4hg,1,0,1,2LMzdtT7TkUXVEPehw5_xw

5414501,2014-09-10,0,Rxz2YpeLr9Ek54Lt5z6h0A,"It's about time I wrote a review for them. In short, they're one of my favorites. Comfort food in a restaurant.  

I usually go for the Steak Dinner Special, served 24/7 for 6.99. Comes with about a 4oz or so steak, veggie and your choice of potato and dinner roll. The special used to come with soup or salad but when the price went up they nixed the salad. I still get my salad, with ranch. Just a basic house or dinner salad. 

Their burgers are also tasty and they even boast their own ""Challenge"", The Monster Burger. It's a one pound burger patty set upon special made buns from Great Buns Bakery here in Vegas. 
Comes with all the fixings and a side of fries. If you take the challenge, you must eat everything on your plate, I believe in under an hour. If you do, you get a certificate.  No other incentives, just bragging rights. 

Also, their Club sandwich is pretty good. I know, how hard could it be to screw up a Club. (It's been done, trust me.) They use beautiful carved Turkey.  Sandwich bread, toasted to perfection and your tomatoes don't cause a landslide. 

Service is always good, Just bare in mind If you go when they're busy...it may take a little extra but they haven't forgotten about you so just enjoy your sit down time.",R4erj-G4KuJ91L4fXHfJLQ,1,0,5,PQZSgNdkzbZU3_oow4dWjw

But, the real reason we come here is for the S.O.S... My father, a retired Marine, thinks it to be really good.  If he doesn't know what good S.O.S. is, who would?

We decided we'd gove them another try and order our steaks rare. The second time, it was a 20 min wait to be seated, another 15 for the food, and when we got it, the steaks were way overcooked again, even though we ordered it rare. The veggies were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who eats anything you put in front of him, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. Then we go up front to pay, it takes another 7 mins for someone to come ring us up.

Since then my husband has been known to all the employees as ""the one"". Oh, you're the one? Oh, that was you? It was quite a story.

I have to say we would never have gone into the Longhorn Casino if someone did not tell us to try this restaurant. 

The only down fall is you have to walk through the smokey casino to get to the restaurant.
The restaurant you will not have the smoke like in the casino.

The specials they advertise are very good, The prices for anything they have here is great!
We have always enjoyed the steak special. It is always really good, Everything we have ordered was good.

The staff is always really nice. We have always enjoyed going here.
If you can get past the smoke you will enjoy the food, Its nothing fancy but you do get a lot and its well worth the prices they ask here,
We would for sure keep going back! Its good!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,2,1,4,RErsNVBZUVYYn3nTwfrCEw
