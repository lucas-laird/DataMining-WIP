We went here on a whim after being in the casino.  I knew it was going to be a rough ride when we stood at the hostess station for 5 minutes before we were even greeted.  After she finally came to seat us she took us to a booth in the back where she told us it was happy hour and K*** would be our server.  (Remember that she told us it was happy hour)  While waiting the 10 minutes it took our server to make her way to us we noticed a sign on the table detailing happy hour pricing and specials, which sounded good.  After she finally arrived and asked what we'd like to drink we asked for two drinks that were shown on the happy hour sign.  We were then informed that you have to be in the bar area to take advantage of happy hour pricing. WTF? Then why did the hostess tell us it was happy hour when she seated us outside of the bar area? Why are there signs on our table about how awesome happy hour is, with prices, when the table is outside of the designated happy hour area? Anyway, our ray of sunshine waitress told us there are tables open over there if we want to move, which we agreed to do. 

After grabbing our novels that are the Friday's menus, we follow K*** over to the promised land where she proceeds to wave her hand at an open table and walk off. After 5 minutes or so of setting there with no service we walked.  You suck Suncoast Friday's...you suck!

Let me first tell you that TGIF is one of my favorite chain restaurants, I usually go to the one at the Orleans casino but this time there was some kind of event going on and they were real busy, I had set my heart on the steak and lobster so I decided to take the trip all the way across town to the sun coast.
When I got there the place was almost empty and honestly I was happy it was since I was starving. The hostess offered us to sit at the bar area so I we take advantage of the happy hour which we agreed.... and happiness was over.
 We waited for a long time to order our drinks, we waited a lot time to order our appetizers then we waited a long time to order our entrees and having worked in the service industry I'm the first one to stand in defense of the help. I understand that many things can happen that affects good service, problems at home, bad management, crew under staffed, super busy, but when it happens to me that's when understanding stops, specially when the place is this dead, I could find no excuse for him but that we didn't fit the waiter's ideal tipping customer's profile?
 By this time I was willing to ignore the waiters sad service during happy hour, get my own beers at the bar and concentrate on my much anticipated steak and lobster.

1594915,2009-08-30,0,E-3LCDxXg8ojxDe4c7VZ1g,"This TGI Friday's is a bit out of the way for me, but it's worth it.

First off, not all of the TGI Friday's outlets in Las Vegas are created equal.  Usually when we're talking chain restaurants (e.g. Chili's, etc) you can't tell the difference if you're in San Diego or Santa Fe.  But I've been to a few Friday's in Vegas and let me tell you the spectrum of quality on what is some fairly basic food is vast.  But here at the Suncoast, you'll find the best staff and that's a good start.

I've only sat at the bar to grab a bite before or after a movie.  All the bartenders and servers I've come in contact with are very attentive, friendly and don't mind chatting you up as you wait to pass the time.  The food is the same at all Friday's but it seems like the cooks know what they're doing and put some effort into the preparation and presentation.  I usually get the Gourmet Mac & Five Cheese, which is just the right portion size and pretty good for a cookie cutter chain.

I also like the entertainment setup here.  Plenty of HD flat screens well positiond for sports viewing.  Most the appetizers are half-price and domestic beers are cheap for vegas at $2.50.  The only downfall I have is that my iphone gets bad reception for its internet service, putting me at Edge rather than 3G... or sometimes nothing at all.  But that's really stretching to find something bad to say about my experience here.",On_1ZwRgD2Ry0eoKYC29iQ,1,1,4,YgGuat29wTVe4_A1Kq1udg

From my experience at the other location, I knew what not to get. This time, for our party of 3 we decided to share wings, nachos, fried green beans, and a beef quesadilla. I was pretty sure you couldn't mess any of those up. When it was brought out, it was actually decent except for the nachos were a bit salty.

Service was below mediocre because as soon as we got our food, we didn't see our server for a good while. Since the nachos were a bit salty, I finished my water quick. it was only when more people showed to be seated was when we got the attention of our server. What is it with service at all these TGIF's? It starts out ok and then they disappear.

I have been to numerous TGIF's in my lifetime and I seem to recall back then the service was usually pretty good. Same for the food. I know it has gone downhill too. Maybe too much overexpansion?

I would totally come back here again after watching a movie to get the promotion.  You can also use your movie stub to get a free game of bowling ($2 per game + $3 shoe rental).  You have to leave your movie stub when you pay for the bill though.",SAPltgfFSgI1K9aUuOWcXw,1,0,3,s1sk9i5hvK4yM64LwZsRAQ

The food was average, and priced high at this hotel location. The brownie sundae was extremely horrible tasting like plastic boxed brownies.",Q7IoE5m2heQKThuVq3SYFA,1,0,4,cZa1EOo5c6DwQ4fcf0--Lg

I'm so happy we encountered this place that serves happy hour deals all day everyday!   Appetizers are half price in their large bar area.  The Tuscan Spinach Dip was served with fresh (warm) tortilla chips.  Their $1.50 bucket of fries weren't really served in a bucket, but were way worth it.  A high point of our dining experience was the sliders, each for $1.50 on the happy hour menu.  With a nice charbroiled taste and caramelized onions, we ended up ordering more.  A low point was my incomplete house salad.  This order usually comes with croutons, cucumber slices, and a garlic breadstick.  I pretty much had a small plate of just lettuce.  They did bring me a garlic breadstick later though.

Speaking of bringing it...all the waiters work as a team, tending to all patrons.  I must've dealt with six different waiters after we were seated.  Service was with a smile and diligence!  The drinks weren't bad either during happy hour.  I tried their Electric Lemonade which was like kool-aid with a little kick.  Their $5 Margarita, with 1800 Silver Tequila, was flawless.  

The next time I visit, I will partake in their Endless Soup, Salad and Bread Lunch Deal.  From 10am to 4pm, $4.99 will get you all you can eat soup, salad, and bread.  What a freakin deal.  Hell...I might just have to get a slider or two while I'm at it.",KOWl_ZhqhYqY33-CbaJubw,17,15,4,_Iui0gZ3I3F-dACoJ1X6nw

Definitely recommend getting the club (the bread is amazing).  One of the best club's I've had.  Oh, and gotta love Happy Hour ;)",NUEQYD6T-ixWejImJYlDHQ,0,0,4,b-yD36rWUbFP_i0A2a02pQ

5902338,2012-01-30,0,E-3LCDxXg8ojxDe4c7VZ1g,"Lately we've had some very good experiences at this Friday's.  We were there on a Sunday evening with another couple, which means all day and night Happy Hour, and not just at the bar.  We sat in the back, so we wouldn't interrupt all the football fans watching the game on TV.  :D  

Naturally, we had two BOGO coupons, so we sure couldn't find much fault with four main courses and reduced-price drinks.  The service was also very good.  

I'm not a fan of chain restaurants in general, but the one thing that usually can be said it that you always know what you'll get.  My one consistent nit with TGIF is that you NEVER know what you'll get; no matter how often we go, and being that it's so close, that's fairly often, there always seems to be a new menu.  Just once I'd like to be able to know where to find what I'm looking for!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,0,4,huiVASsLJ-1AD86DYEwvDg
5928951,2013-07-17,1,E-3LCDxXg8ojxDe4c7VZ1g,"I haven't been to TGI Fridays for years. Lately, we have been coming to Suncoast to watch movies. Since this restaurant is right next door to the theater, it's the perfect place to eat before or after a movie.

What I like about this place:
-clean
-not crowded 
-friendly service
-food comes out quickly

Of course whenever I come here, I just have to order the Loaded Potato Skins. They are a little bit stingy with the cheese and bacon, but they still taste very good. This is one dish that you have to eat right away. It doesn't taste as good if you take it home, trust me!
Here are their current Happy Hour Deals:
-$6 appetizers, ultimate cocktails
-$5 sangrias
-$4 20 oz. glass draught beers, well drinks, wine by the glass
-$3 14 oz. glass draught beers, bottled beers
Monday-Saturday: 3-7, 9-close bar area only
Sundays: all day bar and dining room (yay!)

It may not feel like ""Friday"" here, but its a nice, relaxing place with good food. Also FYI, they have a rewards program called Give Me More Stripes. You can register for it online, and they send you a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert, just for signing up. You earn 1 ""stripe"" for every $1 spent, which can later be used to redeem rewards. This location does participate in the program.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,3,1,4,y1BUoB6Dx9RrIJqdq5yGNw
