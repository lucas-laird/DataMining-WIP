Dim sum was good. If I can't find the dim sum that I want, I ask them and they are happy to have the kitchen make it for me. Besides dim sum, their lunch specials were also good like salt and pepper squid, sweet and sour pork or chow fun noodles with beef/chicken/port etc. for only $5.99 or $6.99, which was nearly half of the dinner price. They too taste good. I often order a couple of specials and bring home for dinner :)

The restaurant offers special for dinner as well. In April, I got a whole dungeness crab for only $10 after spending $40 on the bill. Yesterday, they offer buy one pound shrimps get one pound free. If you work at the hotel in town, you get 5% discount but I don't know how long it will last for. 

Go try it. You won't be disappointed",v1KY9k-a8Bfxz9szI1be_Q,9,6,5,5WCQezW4Q2Y1wUUKDoFwwg

The dim sum was hot and fresh!  At one point, the cart server mentioned that the item I wanted was not hot and that she would bring me one from the kitchen.  Now that's good service!

The dim sum variety was good serving the basics plus they offered plates of roast duck, BBQ roast pork, as well as some noodle dishes.  Our table server was very attentive while I noticed that the server assistant (busser) seemed a bit ""lost.""  It was obvious that he had not worked in a restaurant before.

The management and hosts were doing their best and trying to offer the best service; it was clear that they were inexperienced, but they were doing their best.  The cashier was very slow; not quite sure why.  Our server took our check to be totaled and we waited a bit.  Finally, we went to the cashier to pay; there was a queue to pay and our check still was not tallied.

The only reason I stopped going to Cathay House because my mom would always see cockroaches running out of the kitchen and the health department closed them down. We decided to give them another chance thinking that the new management would make everything all better. 

Nope. We got seated pretty quick so that's why I gave them a star. Other than that, food was cold. No one asked to take drink orders. There was no soy sauce on our table and it took 3 different servers + 10 minutes to get some soy sauce. The customer service overall was just horrible. They wouldn't even stand still to listen to what we need. They'd just hear one thing and before we can finish what else we needed they'd already storm off to somewhere else!!

They sat us in the wrong table because they showed us a table with some guy we don't know. Hey just because we're not Chinese doesn't mean the rest of the non Chinese guests were part of our family. So we just said we wanted another table.

Big mistake because it threw off their whole service. I'm not picky about service but I'm use to the traditional get drinks first, and then order food. They assumed everyone had ordered a drink because they counted the glasses so they never asked in the beginning if any of us wanted drinks. A couple of us just decided to share drinks because the waiters kept coming and going.

 We ordered what we usually ordered (we're use to Cathay House menu) and the food was ok. Dim Sum was served at this time and it was ok besides the fact that the meats were cold. They will get you a hot plate of meat upon request.

The chicken feet and beef tendon were pretty good. Overall, my meal was typical of a dim sum place, with some dishes good and some not so good. Overall, it was fairly decent but I wasn't blown away.

Let it be known. I do not plan on coming back. They need major improvements on their food before I ever even step my foot in this place. I ordered my usual-- Shumai, Har Gow, Shrimp cheong fun and nothing was good. These dishes are the more common dishes that everyone and their mother would always order.  

The Shu Ma was super salty and the Har Gows was really small. They were being cheap on the shrimp. The Shrimp Cheong Fun was nothing exciting but still needs improvement.

The new place has some new renovations. But so what if they improved the ""aesthetics"" of the restaurant. If the food is bad, then the way the restaurant ""look"" does not matter. At least to me, the quality of the food overhauls everything else.

Growing up working in my parents Chinese restaurant allowed me to appreciate good Chinese food that taste good. And in this case, I did not enjoy any of ""The Jade Restaurant"" common dim sum dishes that was served. Somewhat surprising, that their most common dishes did not taste good.

Setting:  The typical chinese restaurant decor with large round tables and the fish tank harboring your next meal. That fish tank... pretty depressing to look at.

Service: Service was great! The manager was incredibly nice and sat me at an area where the food carts come out first so I get first dibs haha thanks. Empty plates were taken promptly and carts were constantly circling my table. Like most dim sum places  the servers no jiro ingles so sometimes you tell them know but they start hand yu platte.

The fried crab claws were passable but a bit greasy, the Sui Mai were good, Haw Gow was flavorful. The beef crepe was tender but the noodle could have been smoother... Steamed beef balls had flavor. The lotus leaf wrapped rice could have used a bit more flavor.. Not bad by Vegas standards works if your homesick..",9h3flAEZPe5o63L8XjLDDQ,1,0,3,D6MSZL6OncMCa86e07MHMw

Off the strip, this is a Restaurant that definitely serves up traditional Cantonese dishes.  For the most part the food was ok.  One of my pet peeves on seafood is that it's got to be fresh.  We had a salt and pepper frog dish that was totally sub par.  Over battered and frozen frogs.  The second problem was they gave us a dish we did not order.  We ordered a basil clam dish.  But they ran out of basil so substituted a bell pepper onion with black bean sauce clam without telling us!!  Shouldn't you at least ask us before doing that?  The salt and pepper crab was good.  An Xo sauce was used as a try sautéed mix. That was their saving grace.  Now if course we had to check out the bathroom.  It was relatively clean.  The parking is also very convenient in a strip mall.  Overall experience is more like a 3.5.  Until next time...ciao!",KXSzlYPKBMpx-TXDZQK7OQ,1,0,3,Ei7t1A2oNA0QDMIjWuHMYg

They are open from 9:30am, don't have to wait until 10 or 10:30 like the other dim sum places. Hope they'll keep the kitchen clean, the old Cathy had some issues with cleanliness and was cited and closed by the health department last year. Came here on Saturday before noon and got seated right away, everyone  working there was pretty nice, no issues with service.

Came in on a Sunday around 3pm and got seated really quickly. We had a big group of about 15 people and we got seated at two tables. 

We asked our server to split the bill by table because we had such a big group and wanted to split the bill evenly....it was no problem but I don't think he communicated with the rest of the other servers.

With that said, throughout our meal, about 4 different servers would come left and right and give us food that we didn't order. We assumed they weren't communicating about splitting the bill because one of our tables would get food, but the other table would get a stamp on their dim sum card...very confusing!! 

We're not dim sum experts, so of course when we got our little plates of food we had to ask which one it is...but some of them don't speak English!! One server shrugged and said ""I don't know"" YIKES!!

The food was delicious and filling though. We ordered multiple items, such as shrimp noodle dim sum, shumai (pork dumplings), steamed shrimp dumplings, shrimp fried rice, pork buns and much more. We had 8 people at one table and were all full by the end of our late lunch, with extra food for our to-go boxes. Only spent almost $90 total for our table of 8, not bad at all! 

I would come back for the food, but the service makes me not want to revisit.",Vl-c9zRq-tcst4uC8GG1hw,4,1,2,lLOTR0plGyDwXtNmMxIhYg

We went to Jade for the first time tonight, and ordered several of our favorite entrees.  Each was as good, or better than Cathay house.

The biggest difference was the service.  The service at Cathay was always efficient, but impersonal.  The new owners have obviously encouraged their staff to show some warmth.  Our server, Camy, was just delightful, which is rare in an authentic Chinese restaurant.  (And Camy is the real deal....she came from Hong Kong...but maybe the degree from UNLV Hotel & Restaurant Mgmt school helped.)  But it wasn't just Camy, the other staff were extremely friendly.

The fried rice was good and perfect for a morning after a night out on the Vegas strip. Deep fried crab claws were my fave. Note that these are $6.99 though, they basically offered the most expensive plate to us before we had a chance to look at the menu and see the price. I also enjoyed the steamed pork buns, steamed shrimp dumplings and fried shrimp wontons.

I didn't like the potstickers. They weren't fresh, and were too hard. When I bit into them they were pretty hollow. I'm also not a fan of the shrimp or beef noodles. 

SERVICE:
We came here with a group of about 15 people and were split into 2 tables. The carts were still out, but the waiter told us they would be ending in a few minutes and that we'd have to mark down our order on a paper menu. They took the paper to the back and proceeded to serve us. 

What made me livid was a woman who brought a plate to our table that not one of us remembered ordering or marking it on our paper menu. None of us even knew what it was. We tried to ask her what is was, but she just gave a confused smile and said ""I don't know"" and walked away. You don't know?! How do you not know what you're putting on our table?! And the wrong table/plate at that.... We asked someone else to bring our paper. Thankfully he knew what it was, and sure enough, we didn't order it. It's as if they're trying to put more things on our table and secretly charge us more...

There was just too much confusion throughout the whole meal. Our waiter knew we were one group, but we stated that we wanted to pay separately by table, so he gave our table a stamp card as well. There seemed to be poor communication amongst the workers. They continued to stamp the other table's card for our plates after we stated to no longer combine the tabs. There was only one other table in the whole restaurant, so this shouldn't have been hard to communicate. We also had an inconsistency of waiters at our table, we had to talk to 4 different people to verify what we had ordered on the paper menu and asked to see it a few times.

What also confused me is another waitress would come up to our table with two plates stating ""shrimp dumplings"" or whatever it was and we couldn't figure out if she was offering us more, or if she was just bringing us what we marked on the paper... It was hard to keep track of everything. We had to keep asking if she was offering more or if we ordered it.

I'm still sad that I didn't get my sesame balls. Sadly, I'm sitting here writing this review craving them. I was sitting wondering why they hadn't brought them out yet. I basically had to find out on my own seeing they crossed it off on the menu when we asked to see the paper to cross check everything.  No one bothered to tell us they were no longer offering them or that they were all out.

I didn't like having to order from the paper menu. It's hard to gage how hungry you are and how much your table is going to eat. When we turned in our paper menu, the waiter stated ""That's it? That's not even enough for me..."" Well okay, we'll order more then... And we had more than enough to box up for home.

Tl;dr
Food is pretty good, nothing out of the ordinary. Just some good, regular dim sum, nothing to rave about. The service will not have me coming back. I suggest coming here in a small group. Larger groups cause confusion and it's easier to mess up the bill. Poor communication, amongst the staff itself, and between waiter(s) and customers.",j3lFpCwGJXbd0_-Q35sfbg,2,0,2,QxIuRJWxo438uPNi3hxPGA

The server that SO called helped us out was busy texting away by the fountain drink machine and the bottle and can cooler.
