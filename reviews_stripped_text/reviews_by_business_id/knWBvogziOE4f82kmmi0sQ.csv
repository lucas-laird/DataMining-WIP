Well AMAZING can not say enough about him and the resturant Leticia. Liu took such good care of us, he was extremely personable made sure our drinks were refilled in a timely manner. We go out often and i have to say one of the best places I've been in a long time.

Everyone I've taken there loves it and most say it's the best Mexican food in town and I would absolutely agree! The new Leticias in Tivolli village isn't as good unfortunately . Our favorite spicy shrimp and crab guacamole is 1/4 the size for the same price ($16) (just look at the pic attached and compare it to the pics on yelp of the original leticias), the beans don't taste as good, the salsa was super watery that it doesn't even stay on the chips when you dip it, and the jalape√±o guava margarita had a weird taste to it. The shrimp quesa tacos and carnitas were just as good thank goodness. The service was average at best but I know they just opened so I'll let that slide for now but the original is still much better and I think I'd still rather drive down there at the moment. I think they are understaffed for when it gets busy. The new location is much bigger though and very upscale looking vs the original.

1009635,2018-03-08,0,knWBvogziOE4f82kmmi0sQ,We had dinner here last night and although the food was delicious the atmosphere left much to be desired.  Because it was mid week the restaurant was not crowded and we were seated and ordered our dinner when much to our surprise a couple of singers set up and and started playing music and singing not 5 feet from our table.  The music was fine but because we were so close it was impossible to carry on a conversation with a guest that only comes to Vegas once a year. I realize we could have asked to be moved but I felt it would be an insult to the singing group if we did.   It was an unfortunate experience and I felt you should know about it.,mxRwS5_H9PQF-lpxyn8GaA,0,0,3,wgkWPnKZuydtGM8kTSDeOw

The food: fresh chips with generic, bland salsas and chorizo beans. I ordered a wet burrito, what they call ""enchilada style,"" with their ""spiciest"" arbol sauce. It wasn't very spicy and it was loaded with cheese. Their carnitas just taste like braised pork shoulder. The beans and rice side were bland.  The flour tortilla for the burrito tasted old. 

I go to Mexican restaurants for spicy food, not diner blandness. I feel I got more bland than spicy. Won't go back.",ZL_zmesRw89J8PrsdJg6Uw,0,0,2,vLtunm8irgI_20D_VrSdkg

1210931,2018-04-12,0,knWBvogziOE4f82kmmi0sQ,"Dined at Leticia's for the first time last night. 

While the food was delicious, the service was a disaster. Having waitressed in the past, I'm pretty sure what happened was our waitress had way too big of a section. The indicator is always letting alcoholic drinks set empty. Every server knows you can double or triple a bill with alcohol sales alone, so you do everything you can to make sure a drink never sits empty. This tells me they were understaffed and our waitress was way too busy. 

That being said, my entree came out about 10 minutes after my moms. It was like it had been forgotten altogether. The food runner asked if I wanted a plate so we could share the one entree that arrived, obviously not realizing I had my own food coming. When my carne asada arrived, the meat (that I had ordered rare), was WELL done and dry. Since it's a thin steak I usually expect it to come out medium if I order it rare, but this was like it had been forgotten on the grill. It also came with the rice casserole when I had ordered the cilantro rice. At the top of the menu it gives you a choice of mexican or cilantro rice. When our waitress asked how our food was I brought up that my steak was cooked to death. She took it back and when I got a new one it was cooked perfectly, however the new plate came back with mexican rice. Not a big deal, i didn't really plan to eat the rice anyways. I never got tortillas, so we shared the couple my mom got. Those were gone quickly and I had to ask for more. We also had to ask for napkins and silverware. 

Then the bill came. We were charged for the rice casserole (that I never even ate because it got taken back with the first plate of overdone steak). When I brought this up with the waitress she said that I had asked for the cilantro rice and that's what that was in the system. Not wanting to argue and thinking maybe I misread the menu we paid for it and left. Today I looked up the menu and the cilantro rice is most definitely not the same as rice casserole, the rice casserole is a separate side entirely and not even mentioned at the top of the menu. 

Overall this was some of the worst service I have experienced in a while. The food was delicious, and this service problem could be remedied by not over-seating your servers or at least providing proper training on the menu. Again, having worked in the service industry in the past I know stuff like this happens from time to time, so hopefully I can give Leticia's another try. Two stars for yummy food, zero for service.",BRabX88bM_YSPcdF_Qy0hg,0,0,2,0lWcEcU84-HY_7M60zUMgg

However, after waiting OVER an hour for our food, we finally walked out, we were  exhausted and starving from waiting so long. After about 45 minutes, we had 3 different people give excuses and empty promises, such as ""sorry our kitchen is backed up, your food will be right out"". The food never came out. We were so dissatisfied with the bad service and having wasted so much time at this restaurant. In over an hour were served water and chips when all we really wanted was our lunch order.

We were in the area for an event and thought we'd give it a try. We sat in the patio the night of Dia De Los Muertos event. The albondigas in the soup were really tough and the broth was bland and just seemd like tomato sauce. The flautas were heavy and flavorless. The beans were pasty and tasted like bbq baked beans. My kids cake and fries were ok, but that's expected. It ended up getting a little cold, so we requested a heater, since there were a few not being used and were lit. Our waiter said we could get up and change tables, but he couldn't move it. We said nevermind. It wasn't worth the hassle of moving my kids and all our stuff. But then our busser noticed my kids kept walking over to the heater to get warm, so he moved one over. That was nice of him! I wish I could've given him all our tip money. Overall this place is pretty but that's it. The night ended with some other waiter making a scene taking a break by the stairs to the patio and yelling and cussing on his phone, he definitely seemed drunk.",Ijl7OMSDs5MiOhniXDnzcg,0,0,1,4d-kMEwHz7ac7ifpPW5ssA

1321304,2017-12-17,0,knWBvogziOE4f82kmmi0sQ,"I came to the restaurant thinking it was the old Mexican restaurant. I went to the old place ONLY for the salas so I was a little nervous seeing a new name on he door. But being hungry decided that I would give it a shot. As I was walking up to he door two employees were leaving the restaurant probably for the day and one of them turned around to open the door for me which I thought his action was amazing, still working while off the clock. Went straight to the bar and was greeted by the bartender Hared right away. The old restaurant wouldn't even acknowledge me till I had been seated awhile, so I was very happy to just be said hello to. Hared was very attentive and gave great service. He knew I wanted spicy salas so brought me a extra one that doesn't come with the salas set up. He also suggested the Picosa margarita to me which was spicy and very delicious. Everyone at the bar seemed to be a regular and knew Hared. He seems to be a popular bartender. Very happy with everything. Glad I was told about the happy hour special I will definitely be coming back to other my friends.

We both ordered the Chef's Specials, which are part of the regular menu.  My wife chose the El Molcajete with carne asada and extra bacon-wrapped shrimp.  The dish had a nice, spicy kick to it.  This came with a side of corn and flour tortillas, which were so deliciously warm that they just about melted in our mouths.  She had so much food that she elected to make one fajita and eat the rest of her dish as an entree with the rice & beans that come as a side dish.  I finished off the tortillas with my dish, the Molcajete De Mar, which was packed with seafood -- including shrimp, lobster, fish, clams & octopus.  We were even adventurous by trying the cactus that comes in both dishes, which was delicious by the way!  This restaurant doesn't skimp on portion size!  The white rice poblano is out of this world with all its cheesy goodness.

I loved the decor (Catrinas aka Dia de los Muertos dolls, everywhere). 

The Sopa de Fideo is something I could eat every day for breakfast.

I had a chicken quesadilla, I think, as there was absolutely no flavor whatsoever. There was almost no cheese and the chicken was so full of water the bottom half of the quesadilla was a sloppy, soggy mess. Ugh. I asked them to put a couple jalape√±os on it because the salsa that comes with the chips is little better than tomato paste, but instead charged me $4 for a side of peppers. I paid $35 for a single person to eat a quesadilla and have one margarita. Insane!

The Cadillac margarita was way too sweet for my taste. Hussong's around the corner in Boca Park or Carlitos in Henderson have MUCH better food, flavor, service and prices. 

When did restaurants stop asking if you want water?

This place was quite pricey, being a more ""upscale"" mexican restaurant. The decor is nice, and presentation of food is also very neat... however the food was quite bland, or had an off taste to it. The menu seemed more like a build-your-own anything with ""choose 2 sides"" with a list of sides on the menu, and just a lot of you choosing. However, the problem with the entire thing was that I was not allowed to choose as the menu explained, I was given only 2 options (none of which were on the menu), also I was not given my 2 sides, but just offered rice and beans. When I tried explaining that I was supposed to pick 2 sides (corn on cob, fries, veggies, salad, etc to name a few), I was told there was ONLY rice and beans... furthermore, when I tried building my enchiladas, it said I could choose 2 meats and fillings, and a sauce... I asked for shredded chicken and the house blend of cheese, with a sauce.. however, I was told I would just get chicken enchiladas, that they did not have any cheese, and I was only offered 2 sauces, red or green. None of which I wanted.
Same thing with my bf, where he was supposed to build his burrito with 3 fillings, he asked for a meat, cheese and another filling, but when he was explaining the filling he was only given the meat and other fillings he did not ask for, not one. Also it was supposed to come with a few sides, but it only came with rice and beans.
I've been bloated for 3 days now, and the food tasted really weird and off. I was not a fan, being Mexican myself and growing up on authentic mexican food. 
Only redeeming quality was the chips and salsa.",bJ_CWJ55ZLgwNvo-OAW2Og,8,3,2,nKYQJiJo-r_rrXdJDV1O6A

Sat at bar ordered a beer and then needed a few minutes. Bartender brought beer over and then went about his job. After putting menu to side waited and then gave him my order, 3 flautas with shredded chicken.  Munched on chips and then got meal. The flautas were beef. Got the attention of the food runner and explained I ordered chicken he said no the ticket says beef. Now I know what I ordered so he takes the plate to the bartender shows him the ticket and then the bartender says see it says beef. The food runner explains to bartender he hit the wrong button at which point the bartender finally addresses me and says your order will be right out. No apology no nothing.

I was surprised to find a darn good Mexican restaurant. The first clue I was about to enjoy this place was the not so usual chips and salsa. I got three bowls of salsa, red, green and some refried Beans with a kick. The chips were not the run of the mill grocery store brand. I really enjoyed the snack along with the XX beer.

Staff was on the ball and offered me another beer soon after I emptied my first. Usually I have to wait a while for someone to even show up and take notice. 

The carnitas I had took me way back to the days of simple living way down south. A time and place when we prepared our carnitas from start to finish, I'll spare the details. My first impression was whoa... This is the real deal. I had corn tortillas and like the carnitas I thought to myself, Yess! Another real deal item from back in the day. The side items, refried beans and rice were obviously cooked with the same attention to detail as the carnitas and tortillas. 

I believe it was the MGR that sat at the table when I was done and asked if I enjoyed it. After giving him the details of where I remembered this from he said ""that's how we do it here"". I had no doubt.

I could not wait to tell my friends about this place. My statement to them was, guys I found it. The real deal, come and get some

I wait a couple more minutes and the chips and salsa come. Finally the server comes by. I ask her what soup she recommends, and she says the chicken soup is really good because they make it fresh. I ask her which soup it is on the menu and she says it's not on the menu and only part of the lunch special. She then asks if I want the lunch special. I point out that it is past 3pm (the lunch special ends at 3pm, and it's almost 3:45pm now). She says, ""oh, yeah, I guess so.""

So I ask her again which soup she recommends and she lists 4 different soups (they have 5, maybe 6, on the menu). I ask her if she can narrow it down, and she says the pozole rojo. So I order that and an enchilada combo plate; I ask the server for her recommendation on the sauces, and she says white for the chicken and red for the beef. I agree. 

In the meanwhile, my water glass had become empty so I ask the guy who was refilling water glasses if I could have some more. He refills my glass and in the process spills water on the table, soaking my napkin. He apologizes and walks away. I flag him down and ask him if I could get another napkin. He says yes and brings over two small paper cocktail napkins. 

After a while, my enchiladas come out. I tell the gentleman who brought the enchiladas out that I had ordered soup; he looks surprised and asks, ""really?"". He asks if I want to cancel the soup and I tell him yes. 

A little while later, the first server comes by and apologizes for the soup and says it's because she ""tried to put it in the right way but the kitchen didn't do it right"", whatever that means.

My water glass is empty again now but nobody comes by to refill it and my two attempts to flag someone down fail, so I get up and refill my own water glass. 

I speak to a manager later and let her know about the minor issues and she apologizes. Then I get the bill and they had charged me an extra $0.50 for the white sauce for my enchilada. I was never told that the white sauce would cost more and it was not listed on the menu either.

I paid and left. The food was alright, and the issues were relatively minor, but it all added up to a suboptimal experience.",V2xcgiGpyiid7p155Y4uKQ,2,0,2,J4bVQUnKQtb0QtIU98ClZg

We sat at the bar and both ordered margaritas, I got a pomegranate one with fresh lime juice and it was amazing.... not too sweet. I got the empanadas with refried beans and some sort of cheesy peppers on the side and it was absolutely incredible. The empanadas had a corn masa and it tasted really fresh I got one of the empanadas with chicken Tinga and the other with shrimp and chorizo. My husband got a chili reano with rice and beans and it was great. I always judge a place based on the chips and salsa and if I was basing this place on that alone they would get five stars! They serve you fresh chips with two different types of salsa and a side of beans , The bean dip had a ton of flavor and the green salsa was some sort of an avocado flavor and it was Yum!!

This time around my wife had the Pork Enchiladas with Green Sauce. Her comments led me to believe that while not bad, she would not order this entree again. For whatever reason I was not in the mood for the typical beef, chicken, pork, cheese anything. That's when my eye caught the attention of their Seafood Enchiladas. I had it with the white Cream and Cheese sauce. This was served with a Poblano white Rice Casserole with crema, cheese and rajas. This dish was muy bien. I highly recommend this entree. We finished by sharing a dessert. A house specialty recommended by our server consisting of custard flan over chocolate cake. This dish was let down by the chocolate cake. It was dry, not moist and the flan lacked flavor. A scoop of ice cream would have save the day for this dessert.

The prices are upper end as well. This is an upscale mexican resturant.  But weighing all important points to consider, they should be able to command their prices.   

Their servers are professional and friendly.  That goes a long way in making or breaking an establishment, or dictating what prices can be charged.

I have had Chicken Parillada (Fajitas) -$19.  Another time we hit happy hour and had drinks and Appetizers.  Both times served complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip while waiting to be served.

Some of the meals can serve 2 depending how big of an eater you are.  One appetizer, chips, and a drink will give you a light meal and perhaps fill you up.  

Love the atmosphere in Tivoli Village, street level, in the south west section of the village.

It would be nice if the menu's were printed with numbers next to the selections for some of us gringo/gringa that will struggle with some of the dish names.

Would like to start off by saying I work in the food service industry and when I dine out, I try NOT to be demanding or high maintenance.
When we (party of 3) arrived the hostess said it would be maybe 5 mins, since several other parties came in right behind us. No problem, it wasn't even 5 minutes that we waited. BUT we were sat between the bathrooms and the door for the kitchen (There were quite a few empty tables and booths too). The people I was with knew I don't like sitting by a bathroom or having to look into the kitchen, I said ""don't worry I'll deal with it"". Our waiter, no introduction, came and took our beverage order, when we ordered the Mango Ice Tea, he promptly said ""NO FREE REFILLS"", the tone took us aback, there is a better way to say this.  When he took our order, I asked for Traditional Taquiza, and also said ""Sorry I am probably saying it wrong"", I feel he should have said which one are to talking about and had me point to the item on the menu. He brought me Street Tacos, NOT what I wanted or order. I am NOT one to send things back to a kitchen (I work in one, and know what goes on behind the scenes).

*Normal or Frozen
*Normal or Cadillac. Cadillac is made with a stronger tequila that is used.

We've been meaning to try Leticia's for a while and couldn't get around to it. But we were at Tivoli for an event. The event was disorganized, but we found ourselves circling the village, visiting different establishments for drinks and noshes and viewing their wares. Our last stop was Leticia's, for  samples of their margarita, which was absolutely delish. Since we were already three sheets to the wind, thanks to a very potent champagne from another restaurant, I had only a sip of my 'rita sample, and had to make it the only drink to accompany our dinners. I'm the self-appointed driver, so I really had no choice :).

Already full, we had to go straight to the main event, after a small taste of very good chips and the two salsa + bean dip sides. My choice was Chile Colorado, which was a guisado, or stew, with lean and tasty beef and potato cubes in a red sauce that had the perfect amount of spice. My husband had the Cecina, a steak-y dish with cheese, veggies, and spicy rajas, which was accompanied by an enchilada. I had a taste of the steak, and it was really good. We'll find out tomorrow what's inside the enchilada, since most of the food came home with us. Looking forward to it, since we liked both our dishes.

I had forgotten to specify that I wanted black beans instead of the refritos, but when the dish was put in front of me, I wailed to my husband about my lapse. The runner heard me and quickly returned with a dish of black beans topped with a dollop of sour cream.

Both of our dishes had ample amounts of what we chose; my only quibble is that the accompaniments - the rice and salad - were minuscule. I don't care much about the rice, but the salad, which had a bit of a very nice dressing, was only a tablespoon's worth. I wish there had been more.

Our waiter, Jerry (or Gerry?) was attentive and pleasant. 

One caveat: we were seated in the front patio. It was quite warm, much more, I think, than if we had been in the one separating Leticia's and its neighbor across the way. Also, if you are sensitive to or disgusted by cigar smoke, sitting here will put you downhill from the cigar bar, and you WILL smell that smoke. Sit inside, or ask for the other patio.

They have a few new menu items, but they seemed more bland than the other location.
Starting with the new stuff, the corn salad dish was fresh but needing some spice. The empanadito was super tasty and fluffy.
The margaritas are always a hit with me. The nachitos were perfectly cheesy and balanced with toppings. The shrimp quesadilla tacos are always a favorite but I tried the carne asada also this time. Now I have two favorites! The shrimp ceviche wasn't quite as tasty as the cocktail (bland). The jalepeno poppers, volcanito and salsas were all trusty good picks.

We work in the industry and our poor server was so weeded he didn't know where to start. There was no manager in sight. They seemed understaffed. We stayed for 2 hours only because we couldn't decide if we should try and call the manager over or say something to the server but once we did see the manager, he had such an unapproachable attitude that we decided against it plus with as long as we had to wait for everything else, it probably would have taken way too long for him to make it over.

She has great personality but needs to work on her service techniques. She rarely came to check on us especially when the food is taking a long time to come out in between courses. She completely forgot 1 order which the person who delivered it apologized for but she didn't. As far as the food goes, the empanaditas (6 pieces for $18) is so not worth it- barely have anything in it. The large guacamole for $18 was shared sparingly. I can't speak for everyone in my party but when I asked how it was, they weren't as enthusiastic as I'd hoped.

We started off with margaritas and had problems getting a decent drink no matter how much tequila was added, it was not until the manager intervened that I finally got a good specialty margarita (la Fresca) on the second try. A good friend of ours pointed out to the manager, that any good Mexican restaurant must have a decent margarita. We've eaten at the original location many times and had great drinks and meals. 

The meals were exceptional except for the tortillas, for handmade they weren't very tasty or appealing. My two favorite traditional Mexican restaurants both make their tortillas in house and in plain view. So I really looked forward to these but was really let down.  

We ordered the shrimp fajitas and seafood molcajete De Mariscos. The shrimp fajitas were plump, delicious, and perfectly cooked. The molcajete came bubbling and steaming to the table.  The seafood included lobster, clams, mussels, prawns, and fish were flavorful, tender in a rich red broth that was spicy and satisfying.

My friend and I were just window shopping at RH and got hungry so we dropped in. No wait and we had a good seat outside. The place still looks much like the previous tenant except for some mild changes to decor. We had such beautiful weather we opted to sit outside.

For drinks I ordered a Mango margarita and my friend ordered a Bloody Mary. Both were really tasty and did not lack alcohol! The margaritas are served a couple of different ways, frozen or on the rocks is what was offered to me. I am kind of old fashioned and chose frozen.

Next, time to order the good food. My friend chose the shrimp tacos served with cheese, creama and a cilantro flavored rice. I chose the street tacos with black beans and Mexican rice. In addition, I had a bowl of their delicious sopa de fideo. This sopa de fideo tasted so close to the kind my Grandma used to make me! Really hearty and filling. My dish was good although  I would have appreciated a few more accompaniments to my tacos. I really loved the rice though, very authentic and you could tell homemade. My friend devoured her shrimp tacos although large, she did end up taking one home for later.

The server made stunningly delicious guacamole with just the right touch of chili. Then the tacos came out!!  Ribeye and cheese and that wonderfully smoky chipotle flavor!! Savor is the only possible response!!  Sides--Rajas con crema. Ay!!  Vegetables saut√©ed with love!!  Ay, ay, ay!!!  Over the top. And before I forget, the margarita cl√°sica!!  !Perfecta, pero perfecta!",nmWtX_nwRL3Cnl1fTiI_Og,0,0,5,QzK9NQZSGePs-0jD9eb8dA

The service is solid and the food is legitimate from scratch Mexican food.. good sized servings and really very tasty.

I will definitely be back!",Qxn7cHf8VtW_UWwyuYmKkg,0,0,4,xbeL2pGQjzxH_0YXXB2RpA
5705565,2017-12-10,0,knWBvogziOE4f82kmmi0sQ,Not impressed with the get go.  Seat was dirty and later realized that the floor where I was seated was full of tortilla chips.  Margarita was fair. Carnitas had a fair amount of fat and was tasteless and chewy.  Dish with meat had gristle although the flavor was a little better.  Tortilla chips tasted stale.

I walked in to pick up a to go, and had to wait for the hostess to get the food, there was 2 hostess and only one was seating customers and grabbing food orders the other was just standing there wiping menus. I finally got my food that was ready already it was on the counter in front of me ready and the other hostess wiping menus couldn't give it to me. I got my food I thought I double checked but I didn't open the food containers I just grabbed both of them and these side containers and asked the hostess if everything was in the bag, she said yes and named the items so I thought it was good. When I get home I found out they missed a side of queso fundido which I thought it was there because the girl named it off when we were taking the stuff out, but it was just a side of beans instead. I called to tell them and they said yeah "" YOU forgot it here""  like they had gave it to me before hand and I was the one who left it there. But that was obviously not the case. When I went back the host handed it to me and I asked for a bag and my tortillas and she ran to the back and got my tortillas for it and I said I still need a bag and she was like I have to go back to the back so it's going to be like a Minute I was so aggravated by then I asked her to speak to a manager and she said they were busy without even leaving to go ask, I asked her what the managers name was and she looked at the other girl And asked her in Spanish if she should tell me, so dumb she thought I didn't under Spanish but I did so I responded back to her in Spanish and asked the question again. She told me it was LUNA and Geraldo .",8imyDDBAOGngxf_a4kyseA,0,0,1,qaNhSrQROQgdHO-G5-Th0Q

5847455,2017-12-10,0,knWBvogziOE4f82kmmi0sQ,The food was really good. This is an upscale Mexican restaurant so expect to pay $15-$20+ for an entr√©e. I enjoyed the atmosphere. The others reviews stating issues with wait staff seems is accurate. We were seated without a waiter being assigned to our table. However it does appear that they are working on fixing this issue. We didn't wait for very long for a waiter to come by to take our order. Overall the food was delicious and the waiter that we had was attentive but not annoying. The menu has a lot of options. I ordered the carne asada street tacos. Fairly reasonably priced and it came with two sides. I like that there was a choice of sides and that I wasn't stuck with rice and beans. I order the roasted veggies and seasoned fries. The roasted veggies could have been a standalone dish they were that good. It's pricier than it used to so it would be a place I keep in my for date nights and special occasions. I would definitely go back.,kM70xTwz9sAJ3Zc6AdCLHg,0,0,4,GlkeVFw7Xo-R8jqXDD7wEw

Food was terrible!  My husband couldn't eat either chili relleno, the sauce tasted like cinnamon, the sides were slimy and it was gross.

I order Chamorro Adobado and all I got was bone and sauce, what a disappointment.",Q6oPcjwZgHShYbsu06Vq9Q,0,2,1,_2KwqO5iCgqxwGvr_DD6eg
5954731,2018-03-09,0,knWBvogziOE4f82kmmi0sQ,"I was happy to hear that a Summerlin location opened up in Tivoli since it's closer to my neighborhood. But then I went, and now I'm no longer excited. I used to frequent the NW location often and was impressed with the food, service, and experience. The Summerlin location was not the same. 
Met some friends here and they wanted to do happy hour in the bar area since that goes until 7pm as opposed to 6pm in the main dining area. It wasn't too busy when I got there at 6pm so that was nice. 
The high top tables are little small which is strange because the happy hour menu is tapas style, so once you order a couple drinks and food items you run out of table space. I find that to be a pet peeve. 
Anyways, the service was generally good. The food and drinks came out quickly so that was nice. I didn't order any cocktails so I can't speak on that. The food was okay at best. It was not as delicious as I remember the NW location tasting. So I was pretty underwhelmed by the food. We ordered a little bit of everything but nothing stood out as exceptional to me. 
At first our server was always checking on us and then it became hard to find him when we needed something. Considering it was picking up and it was happy hour maybe there should have been more servers available for the bar area to help mitigate that. 
Overall, it was just alright. I don't have to come back here. And if I did, it would more than likely not be my pick.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,1,0,3,A0Z0ODWvmnnGyHc8PNgmlg
