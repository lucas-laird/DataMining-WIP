I wanted to leave but I drove all the way over here on my lunch and I was starving so I tried to stay positive. So I ordered the chicken katsu bento for my girlfriend and a yaki soba for me. $8.99 for a small portion of yaki soba, not worth it!! The katsu bento was good but it wasn't even chicken katsu, it was more so like yaki tori. I'm sorry but this was my first and last time getting lunch from here. It's a shame cause it's by my office and it would of been great to have this place for lunch from time to time.",Z9a1tDT8fVI75qXYwNhPpw,0,0,2,yTNbc2ReCSinCUxg21Q5qg

1837010,2016-10-08,7,jsOGd-P1BfoUY40yY5l59A,"I think this spot would do better in another location, but they'd still need to up their attention to detail. Went in for a spicy squid bento box and it was appropriately spicy with plenty of sauce for the rice, but the rest of the order had issues. Portion was large and price was under $10 but its unlikely I'd return. 

Miso soup was only half full and super salty, side salad unexpectedly came with thousand island dressing, tempura veggies were burned on the edges and didn't have dipping sauce, and the squid dressing spilled and ruined the California rolls. I was the only customer at the time and there were two employees working.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,10,2,W0NH4922nDaoPUzGo0focA

Break out the scrub brushes! Clean the windows and put some storage in your kitchen. The burnt oil smell and sticky floors killed it for me.",4T-SUx4shOzAxWcfgmX_3A,0,0,3,HwNJwotzC6DvhLJAjzViMA

I ordered the seafood noodles my friend had the beef teriyaki and veggie dumplings. both meals came with salads and a fruit plate for a very reasonable price. The seafood noodles had shrimp, mussels and crab, not the rubbery imitation crab but real crab claws. The broth was delicious, very rich and flavorful.

So I stopped here..I sat down and was looking at the menu I told her we needed a minute well she just stood there n went to get somebody else..well I got the spicy squid bento box n the squid could have been cut small since it was super chewy n flavorless..... My husband had curry and it was dry and flavorless my kids got omelet rice and just ate the egg..we got salads n omfg I've never tasted a salad so gross....so we spent money for the food to go half eaten n spent double n ordered pizza!!!!!,NpSaOZSVrhxMkAoqwM72bw,0,1,1,hszV1q5QRltRRfBXmYRPsQ

4012785,2016-01-18,5,jsOGd-P1BfoUY40yY5l59A,"Unfortunate they're not near walking distance of a lunch break by UNLV.  I think they would do a lot more business but the two times I've been here it's been dead.  I don't mind the overly friendly attention I get because of it but I feel bad and don't know how long this place last.  

The food is not over the top crazy especially if you've had anything off Spring Mountain Rd but it seriously wouldn't be a bad addition to the university student culture.  I had the katsu cutlet the second time around and I would have prefereed the katsu from L&L instead.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,6,6,2,-fnU3CiEujTIRQzYIL4Nfg

Bad location.
Small bussin
Got an A from the health inspector.
A little dingy, not the cleanest place I've ever been but not discouraging to eat at.
The food was good but I think it's missing something (not sure what). 
They make their own teriyaki sauce",A7r47-Z0jkCM1iNB8EjpFw,2,1,4,sywNkNl7XOZLFiOQHBZszw
4127822,2015-08-03,0,jsOGd-P1BfoUY40yY5l59A,"The food was just ok. I ordered the spicy squid platter, tempura shrimp side, and gyoza. The gyoza was cooked well, and the miso was good. The squid was overcooked and chewy. The spice level was a bit high for me--it would've been nice if the squid had been served on the side of the rice, instead of on top, which let the sauce saturate the rice as well. The plastic container of dipping sauce for the dumplings only had a teaspoon or so of sauce. The shrimp was served on its own plate with sauce, and they were well cooked, but not exactly tempura style, and quite small (but the amount was reasonable at the price). The miso and salad were brought out together on a tray, but some of the miso spilled on the tray, saturating the napkin.

Aside from the food--the A/C sounds like it's on its last legs. When it was running the temperature was cool enough, but would get up into the mid-80s before it would start up again with a squeal.  There was only one person working, and she simply would not speak up, even though I told her twice that I couldn't hear what she was saying. I had wanted to order the spicy squid bento, but there was apparently a problem with that. I don't know what the problem was, but from her pointing at the platter on the menu, I guessed that I could order that instead.  I have no idea whether she asked me if I wanted to order a drink.

I've driven past this place several times since it opened, and didn't notice it. If you're headed northbound on Maryland Parkway, it's easy to miss--the front and west side are festooned with signage, but it's only easily visible if you're headed southbound.",-4JDJeFS0YAYSiSvIshGLQ,2,0,3,ing2pEOGbmqxnP-GwTpv-w

The lady in the counter is friendly and the chef went over and beyond by offering to take the food of the gentleman that ordered to his car. They can improve on the taste but I don't mind coming back as long as they are good to customers.,LJhE4GrUF2JDbjrhjRKIOQ,2,1,4,5a9CSs6quIaVbKRXMtbZsQ

To be fare, I did not taste all the food, so it maybe that this restaurant does well with certain dishes.  I did read the reviews and saw they have high marks.

5586878,2015-03-16,1,jsOGd-P1BfoUY40yY5l59A,"I had high hopes for this place, but I have literally had better food in a South American prison.
I ordered the pork kat-su and vegetable tempura. 
This is the place once designated for Chuy's Tacos. It seems to change hands every six months or so. It's a tiny little joint with maybe four booths for sitting.
Anyway, the cooler for prepared foods in the kitchen was, according to a sign, ""out of order."" So that meant that for some reason, the prepared food cooler was parked in the tiny dining room by the refrigerator holding the sparse selection of drinks. The young woman who took my order came out of the kitchen several times to grab, with her hand, tofu and other food stuffs from the cooler. 
The miso soup that came with the order was room-temperature. As far as I could tell, they added tap water and tofu cubes to the miso paste. 
The salad that came with the pork kat-su had no dressing. When I asked for dressing, I was handed a squirt bottle of thousand island dressing, the kind with the little pickles in it? The little pickles had, or course, been squished into and blocking the opening of the squirt bottle, so that didn't work. I had to take the bottle apart to access the dressing, a messy and stupid procedure. The salad was acceptable mixed greens and one lonely cut strawberry.
The rice obviously had been sitting around all day. It was dried up to the point where some of it was very chewy and some of it was actually crunchy. I asked for but never received some extra kat-su sauce to put on the rice.
The pork cutlet was overcooked but the best thing on the plate.
I do not know what they used to bread the ""tempura"" vegetables, but it was more like breading than tempura. The vegetables appeared to be from a frozen or pre-cut bag. No onions or appealing elements such as mushroom or asparagus, but such stand-byes as broccoli florets that appeared to be squished into a bread ball. Also, the tempura tasted burned. 
I hope this place gets better. It is next to a great neighborhood in the Huntridge area and I think a well-thought-out effort could be successful, but so far, this is not it.",soG9o5PqmXilKJHpAB777A,6,1,1,2j5O7KYKVZe11R-x28_izw
5613294,2016-11-21,0,jsOGd-P1BfoUY40yY5l59A,You get what you paid for but this food isn't even worth the money I paid. I ordered steam dumplings and they came out dry and the dumpling skin was ripped off of some. I also ordered the beef short rib bento. The beef short rib was deep fried which negated the juicy nature of the meat rendering it dry and inedible. The California roll used unripened avocado which made it completely unsavory and the rice was dried up. The table was unwiped and unclean. This place should be a health code violation on top of the horrible food. I took a chance on a restaurant that I passed by and I will always pass by this place now. 0 stars!,HkzCnLz2Unb2VB3ov_AMJQ,0,0,1,ud-Q2Tv6nkXZG44JbeZtMw
