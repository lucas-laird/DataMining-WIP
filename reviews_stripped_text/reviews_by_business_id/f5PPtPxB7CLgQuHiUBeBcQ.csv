I stopped by the deli today to grab a sandwich for lunch.  Not many other places in this area to eat so I thought it to be a good choice.  WRONG!!!  So I bought a chicken salad sandwich on a salt bagel and it looked so delectable but as I was eating it I heard a little voice from my tummy - 'not good'.  I just thought that maybe I was disappointed that the sandwich looked so good but didn't taste as good as it looked.  However, 30 minutes later I felt the BBG's (bubbly gut) and off to the toilet I ran.  Soooooo embarrassing when you're stuck in the bathroom at work for half the day.  To make matters worse, my co-worker offered to run to the drugstore to buy me some Kaopectate.  Yeah...not my finest hour.  Thanks Brooklyn Bagels!!!",B431Cr-p_Fk0Ri-O-QRQMg,0,0,1,_sENNBLP9-BXAv5try60IA

I believe I have experienced better bagels at the grocery store. The cream cheese was good. For a bagel place, I expect more. I shall try them again. Maybe they could redeem themselves.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,0,0,2,wOIAh1w6SbeDSY6rKiJHXQ

I stopped in almost immediately after it opened, waiting for a freshly toasted bagel with creamy creamy cream cheese to greet me upon my arrival in my office.  I opened up the bag, unwrapped the bagel, took a big bite and....frankly, I was disappointed.  

The sheer amount of cream cheese put on this thing was ri-di-cu-lous.  No one, not a sumo wrestler or a competitive eater, needs that much cream cheese.  The texture of the bagel was off.  I didn't get that slightly crispy then delightfully chewy sensation I look forward to in a good bagel.  It was just a pretty ho-hum experience all around.

Of course, since it is one of three places on the way to work where I can pick up something quick, and the other two rhyme with Cartrucks and HacFondles, I still drop in here once a month or so if I need a carbohydrate pick-me-up so I guess it has to have some redeeming qualities or my taste buds might not just wake up until 10:00 AM.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,0,0,3,MSLv0YOOoLUFFgALd69cTw
