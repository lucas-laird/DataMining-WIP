1211947,2018-04-14,0,puUMzmsCofLK9hwktbJiEw,"(Parents would mostly benefit from this review)

To end the curiosity I took my kids (two toddlers) here to try it out. Catchy sign for the exterior and an interesting look in the interior. 

We started off with some tempura green beans and bang bang broccoli for my kids and surprisingly they enjoyed the dish no questions asked. I would say that they hid the vegetables in a very fancy way (that totally made my mom life easy). Though I had to ask them to omit the spicy taste to fit my kids palate. 

Another merit for this new spot is that the servers and cooks are on their game. Considerate enough knowing that I'm with two kids by myself (either their totally nice or maybe I just look like I'm really crying out for help lol).

Then the noodles came out.. That's when I started to wonder if I should take my kids out here once a week or even more. I ordered the ramen mac-n-cheese and roasted duck. Duck was roasted perfectly and the ramen is not your average Mac-n-cheese. Somehow these dishes fit together and that their taste are like fireworks in my mouth.

Lastly, Nutella honey toasts for the win. Never in my entire life I have thought that I could go crazy over an ice cream and a bread.

We came here on a not very busy time of the day. Maybe I'll update this review when we get a chance to visit on a busier day and see if anything changes.",18Q2k-VDvIHEuHu6ft6v8Q,0,0,5,xYt8EfG33InnlYGS1QUvYw
1278869,2018-03-20,0,puUMzmsCofLK9hwktbJiEw,If you're looking for a great ramen place or just a great place to eat in general I highly recommend send noodles. Right away I was greeted with a bright beautiful smile from the hostess Jena who was a great help throughout the entire night. I ordered the crispy chicken bao as an appetizer which was just as tasty as it was appealing. I also ate the house ramen it was nothing short of amazing. The waitress was very quick and efficient I never had to ask for a refill which is a huge plus for me. With all being said it's a place you must come to eat.,Qgu5k9cEYR8cq8Yziw31xA,3,2,5,JeTAUfC77qrPYQ1hD-bC0w

My server Yoshi was very friendly, ensured everything was to my liking.

For appetizers, if you like seafood try the Gyoza it's filled with delicious pork and has a hint of Shrimp. Moving on with the main course, try the Chicken Pad Thai it's very flavorful and has a good kick of spiciness.

2290971,2018-05-31,0,puUMzmsCofLK9hwktbJiEw,"This update is after the MOD reached out to me. I do appreciate that she did and I'm willing to give it another try. 

This time, I tried the macaroni and cheese ramen and the beef chow fun. I was honestly a little hesitant with the ramen but it seemed popular. I was pleasantly surprised. It had a nice smooth flavor and the noodles were perfectly al dente. Good traditional American fusion with a Korean/Japanese traditional dish. I think it would be fun to see more fusion dishes like this. Hmmm, maybe a toasted sesame cracker with pistachio nut butter and some kind of oriental fruit jelly. This could be a fun theme, mixing Asian tradition with American tradition. If the chef could expand on that, I might reconsider my taste for this place but until then...

On my first visit, I got the pad Thai. It wasn't exactly bad but I was expecting it to knock me off of my feet. Maybe because of my expectation, it seemed mediocre. This time I got the beef chow fun and it was similar. Very...normal. Which again, isn't bad. Just having high expectations seems to change my feelings towards it. 

It seems that this restaurant was a last minute decision and the chef is expected to work a miracle with it. The layout is awkward. It's triangle shape makes it difficult to seat people. 

I sat at the booth and turned my table horizontal so I didn't feel like my back was going to get clipped if anyone walked by. Plus, I like having my back against the wall but I was with a female friend and if I have to choose, I will always offer the wall seat to the female. But, turning the table allowed me to sit next to her and we could both enjoy the wall seat. They might even be able to put the same type booth on the adjacent wall. I did feel much more comfortable sitting in that high seat rather than the lower tables. What would make these low tables better is if they were also triangle shaped. Stick with the theme of the area. Triangle! It might even be cool to incorporate 3's and triangles into the menu somehow. 

This place still needs work but I'm starting to see some possible potential and hope that they take some of these ideas and do something because I don't see it lasting much longer if they don't.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,2,1,4,41gGyKLWHCSJHkm5w25TFg

Ordered the house ramen and didn't eat it at all the broth was not very good and had that weird too much chicken taste. DO NOT Order the spare ribs!! So tough not even able to get the meat off the bone. Not even edible. Didn't eat any of my food and was asked if it was ok and I said I didn't care for it and ribs were tough.

3755403,2018-04-29,0,puUMzmsCofLK9hwktbJiEw,"I took a point off right away because the chefs were not wearing hair covers.  It is a big No-No when you have an open kitchen just next to the dinning room.  This is a similar setup at the Ping Pang Pong and the Noodle place at the Gold Coast.  All their chefs have hair covers.  Some of them wear baseball caps and that's OK.  

We ordered Beef Chow Fun.  It was pretty good. The beef was way too salty.  We also ordered the Moo Sue Pork.  They were all pre-wrapped in pancakes already.  There were four of them.  They were pretty good.

Price-  They are more expensive than Noodle place at Ping Pang Pong

Service:  Average.  We had to ask to get waiter to fill out glasses.  Dirty dishes were not removed after we ate.

This restaurant is more comfortable than the Gold Coast noodle place.

We went there because we have a coupon for $15, just to check out this place.  If I have to pay full price, I would go some place else.",YaYvLJc5MAvzdVzY_pc8Rw,1,0,3,C9swB7QtkXqZ-owjYMTofQ

The Spicy Tom Yum seafood soup is one of our favorites with a side of rice. It's spicy while still being full of flavor.  (Perfect for a hangover) 
The Mac & Cheese ramen is very rich, I don't recommend getting it to-go. It tends to get thick and clumps together; but hot and fresh at the restaurant it's amazing!
The Dan Dan noodles & Pad Thai also good options.

The good stuff: The mural. Gorgeous mural by James Jean, same person who drew the poster for The Shape of Water (Best Picture at the Oscars this year, but was it though? Three Billboards was pretty amazing.) If anything, go eat some ramen to stare at this thing. Service was really nice, and they looked real spiffy in those short sleeve button downs (button ups? WHO KNOWS.) 

The bad stuff: 
1. They didn't have the mango sticky rice. According to a friend that had visited the day before, they didn't have it then, either. What's going on? Stop sending noodles and start sending ripe mangoes! 
2. I had one of the noodle plates, took me a minute to find those said noodles since they were buried beneath a thick layer of bean sprouts and scallions. 
3. Thai tea comes from a can. Six bucks. And it's in a can.

I'm not huge on noodle bars, so I sincerely hope you noodle bar lovers out there like this place more than I did.",Rsez5iSKBDgkqt6yU62o2A,4,1,3,UfYPAQ9U7dUvF1yaPR9q_w
3966800,2018-04-10,6,puUMzmsCofLK9hwktbJiEw,"5 adults and 2 children got together on Saturday night and we ordered several things from this newly opened noodle house in the Palms Hotel and Casino.

We ordered:

Crispy chicken bao
Okonomiyaki pancake
Gyoza
Tempura green beans
Beef cheek bao
Singapore noodles
Ramen mac and cheese
Dan Dan Mien
Bang Bang broccoli
Nutella honey toast
Sesame balls

The dishes were hit and miss.  I'm the Singapore noodle person and I thought it needed more curry--not for heat but for more curry flavor which was just too mild for me.  The gyoza were standard.  The Bang Bang broccoli was disappointing.

On the better side, the crispy bao chicken was good as was our dish of tempura green beans.  The ramen mac and cheese was a great fusion of East and West.  

For dessert, the sesame balls were OK and the Nutella honey toast was quite appealing if somewhast hard to cut and eat.

They need to do some work on some of their dishes.  It's just A-OK.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,8,3,op4uGsE7IDrfTu2clReYIQ

5278785,2018-04-11,5,puUMzmsCofLK9hwktbJiEw,"So far making up for the closure of Alize with an impressive makeover of their 24-hour Café and Buffet it was alongside six others that a seat was taken at Send Noodles inside The Palms on Saturday, ages from Children to a Senior Citizen represented including a Chef and Assistant General Manager from elsewhere with all coming away a bit confused by what turned out to be a hit n' miss meal.

Created by Station Casinos under the direction of Joseph Kudrak and Francis Mo, the former's oversight a big part of A.Y.C.E. and Lucky Penny's success with the latter operating as the Noodle Bar's top toque, Send Noodles is described as featuring ""a robust menu with influences from Mandarin, Cantonese, Szechuan, Japanese, Korean, and Thai cuisines as well as creative takes on American and Italian classics using Asian ingredients"" and although no menu is yet posted online the concept proves true to its word with seating inside for perhaps fifty at most.

Open now for just four weeks on the north edge of The Buffet, its narrow profile and sparkling-clean bar catching eyes behind neon signage and a hostess podium, it was shortly after getting settled in that beverages including $28 Sake and $6 Thai Tea from a Can were served in addition to Water, Chef Mo stopping by with an associate to say hello and then turning the night over to servers unafraid to upsell more expensive items like Duck and Lobster but otherwise sufficient in their role.

A bit busy to begin but settling down by 7:30pm, an order placed in three rounds coursed out as anticipated save for one forgotten item that was brushed away with excuses rather than an apology, it was while chatting that dinner got started with crave-worthy fried Green Beans topped in Eel Sauce and bright spices while flavorless Gyoza identical to those at Lucky Penny disappointed for $10, the $12 ""Bang Bang Broccoli"" next proving to be the night's most polarizing selection as some found the heavily truffled Hot Sauce off-putting while others felt it worked well in the plate's context.

Intentionally inauthentic but occasionally sticking to tradition, the Japanese Pancake as fluffy and funky as expected beneath dancing Bonito, those looking for excellent Bao would be well-advised to check out crispy Chicken painted in fermented Chili and dressed in crunchy Vegetables while rumor has it the Beef Cheek version is less than stellar, one youth refusing to eat anything but the steamed Bun and his father confirming the Beef was too sweet and unpleasantly textured.

Moving onward to Noodles, a bowl of house Ramen and Mapo Tofu fulfilling the needs of a Gluten-free member of the table, it was in the opinion of one that Singapore-style Vermicelli could have used a bit more Curry that others found fault in overcooked Shrimp, the Dan Dan Mein on the other hand performing very well and appropriately spicy while $11 ""Ramen Mac-n-Cheese"" was sticky, rich and full of textures that were appealing to all.

Rounding out the evening with Desserts, all three from Send Noodles menu served in double portions, suffice it to say that fans of Adzuki Bean Paste will happily devour Sesame Balls featuring a crispy exterior and almost no oiliness while no one particularly enjoyed Mango Sticky Rice that was thick, pasty and nearly devoid of sweetness, the exact opposite situation as found in $10 Nutella Honey Toast that is every bit as delicious as it sounds but definitely best shared by two or more
 
THREE STARS:  Certainly not mailing it in with a menu of high aspirations and prices far lower than on-Strip competition it seems  as though Send Noodles still needs time to dial in their recipes before being fully recommendable, though those selecting carefully and dining with a group can easily sample a lot of good stuff without spending more than $30-40.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,6,3,7evPWBOVFvaNvxnxxbA8hw
