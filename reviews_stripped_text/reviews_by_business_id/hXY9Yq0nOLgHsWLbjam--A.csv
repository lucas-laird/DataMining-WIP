Waiters- went out of their way to make it a great dinner. Brought 3 types of salad dressings when I couldn't decide on what I wanted.
wedge typesalad- just ok, wouldn't order it again.
ceaser salad- just ok, my friend woudn't order it again.
bread basket- neither one of us like it and we LOVE bread.
mashed potatoes- very good
filet mignon- WOW, it was great, lots of flavor!  Went to 3 restaurants for steak when we were in Vegas, this was the best one!  Ordered medium-rare, and it was perfect. 
atmosphere- pretty, a little loud with the music playing but it was 10:00 p.m. and it is right next to a night club so that was pretty much the clientele.",wj5VgjX-SbVm75lbp26buA,0,0,4,dQH52aN6GfjtuT3Nvmt-yw

167642,2009-12-16,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"So we arrived on Besos opening night with high expectations.  We were greeted warmly by a couple of waiters and quickly offered drinks.  We indicated we wanted ""regular water"" since anyone that goes to Vegas knows they will charge you for bottled water.  Wine list presented we ordered a bottle and later found out that they did not yet have many of the bottles and even some on the mix drinks on their drink menu.  No big deal, there was still lots to choose from.  We decided to order various different appetizers instead of entrees in order to try out a variety of foods.  So disappointing.  They make a big deal about Eva's special guacamole only to get a big glob of mediocre guacamole that costs $10.  I make it better for about $4.  Then their beef tar tare was a big glob of diced, unseasoned beef on a bed of mashed potatoes.  So unappealing!  The taco sampler was like ordering from a taco truck.  Lastly, our fourth appetizer never made it to our table.  Whether they forgot or not I am unsure, but when we decided to cancel it they took soo long to return to our table with the updated bill we almost got up to find the manager.  They apologized for the delay stating the first night is always a problem in the kitchen.  How sad considering all we ordered were appetizers.  I do admire the tranquil beauty of the place, however it does not ultimately make up for the less than spectacular food that doesn't really convey a latin theme.  It is a Hodge podge of different foods that are less than memorable.  I wish I could say something better but it all boils down to the food.  There is definately better places to eat.",1GrPWgJPsOvIYCz4HJPlUQ,0,0,2,OHlD-0dZzkYnYol_AxSfsw
200239,2010-12-05,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"Sadly, Beso LOOKS better than it really is. The place is beautiful with its Swavorski chandeliers, views of the Aria waterfall at the entrance and dark, classy interiors. But once you take all that in, there's not much else to ooh and aah about. 
 
The service at first was great. We were seated right away, to find the rest of our party already seated. At first, our server and his 2-3 other helpers were very attentive - water was poured right away, drink, appetizer and entree orders taken promptly. Our server was very friendly, ready with suggestions on drinks and appetizers. When we had questions about entrees, he was very knowledgable and seemed to give his honest opinions.

The drinks, bread and apps came and was actually great. We shared the ceviche, the guacamole and the crab cake. All were delicious. The strawbellini, I heard, was yummy. And the mojito was ok. 

And then came the wait. And so we waited and waited. About 30-40 minutes between clearing the appetizer plates and entrees coming. And during the waiting, not even one visit from the server or host or busboy to ask if we needed more water or to give us an update on dinner. We started to wonder if everyone assigned to our table went on break or went home for the night. 

Finally, entrees came. I had the paella which was just ok. The rice was not cooked evenly, some parts were undercooked and some parts were mushy. I probably wouldn't order it again. My husband had the ribeye, which compared to some of the other steakhouses in town, was disappointing. Flavors on both dishes just weren't there. The mac and cheese, which the server raved about, was on the bland side. Again, not very flavorful. 

Overall, Beso would be a great place to go for drinks. The vibe at the bar is fun, energetic and loud. But if you're looking for good food, you might have better luck elsewhere.",SZxIPLMmbc5nZmvwPagmHQ,4,0,2,TRuNUf3owh3m_s_-32RinA

Not only did I waste my money, but more importantly, I wasted a dinner in Vegas:-(

The good:
- Great location - City Center is a lovely area to spend an evening
- Restaurant has a nice decor
- My 8oz petit Filet was quite yummy (though not as good as Mon Ami Gabi in the Paris)
- Good pre-dinner pretzel bread

The Bad:
- Waiter was totally rude. Barely looked at us and seemed pissed off.
- The wait staff talked, interacted and seemed rude to each other right near the tables. Aren't wait staff supposed to be invisible??
- Our dinner came with champagne. It was served in PLASTIC flutes.
- 4 items on the menu were sold out (it was only 8:30!!!)
- The Beso salad (reg $14) was nothing more than about 9 leaves of lettuce and 4 cherry tomatoes (I'll post a pic)
- Eva's famous guacamole was almost tasteless, with a hint of lemon. 
- Our dinner came with dessert - lame chorros that were literally thrown on the table by a waiter walking by!

We were very disappointed.  The restaurant is loud and unimpressive compared to similarly priced restaurants in Las Vegas.  The pictures on the Beso website make the restaurant appear much nicer than it actually is.  It took our waiter more than 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink order, and it took about 15 minutes after he took the order for him to return with our drinks in hand.  After all of that waiting, two of the drinks were wrong and he forgot one of the drinks.  Our food was mediocre and too busy with spices and garnishes.  Our waiter did not pay any more attention to our table after our meals were served and we had to ask another waiter for refills on our drinks.  The experience was not a good one and certainly not worth the money.  We could have had a better meal and better service elsewhere.

293730,2009-12-10,2,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"All in all, Beso did not hit the mark, I absolutely did NOT love it.  Here are the reasons:

We decided to hold a company dinner at newly opened Beso tonight (15 people), as many may be aware, corporations usually limit meals by a per diem, as was the case for us.  My admin made this clear to the staff when she made the reservation.

The first thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that the waiter was very intent on selling us the Imperial Shellfish Tower ($79), I personally told him no thank you, but he kept talking!  I told him no thanks again and he said, ok, I'll check back later in case you change your mind (talk about pushy!).  15 minutes later, I totally saw the exact same waiter trying to upsell the Imperial Shellfish Tower to a different person in our party, that person said yes, and out comes 5 Imperial Shellfish Towers...Um, $400?  THE most expensive appetizer on the menu!  I clearly told him no...That was so not cool.

The 2nd thing - we had 2 vegetarians in our group, so we asked the waiter to provide a vegetarian meal to accommodate those in our party with special needs.  The waiter returned and said, don't worry, we'll bring 2 veggie specials, the chef is fantastic and will create something delicious, you will not be disappointed.  The whole table gets their food, except 1 of the vegetarians.  After waiting a while, they bring out a large platter with roasted carrots, asparagus, pita bread, battered and deep fried green beans, mixed green salad, and some sliced cucumbers and apples.  First of all, the dish was a weird mix of mismatched vegetables, secondly, everything but the green beans and the pita were served cold!!!!  Not lukewarm or room temperature, just straight cold.  I mean, it seemed like the guy slapped together whatever non-meat leftovers he had in the kitchen and sent it out to us.  It was truly a huge and horrible meal.

Lastly, they kept serving bottled Voss water all night, which ended up being $10 a bottle...I don't recall being asked if I would prefer bottled vs. filtered/tap water.

The whole night, the staff seem very intent on providing a ""great experience"", so they were overly attentive, annoyingly so.  They kept mentioning to us over and over...""We really want you to have a great experience...""  I've honestly never been to an upscale restaurant that is so obvious and pushy about upselling the most expensive items on the menu, it's just straight up tacky.  Of course we blew through the per diem, not that the staff at Beso even cared.

In the end, the total bill was over $1600, so I guess great experience = let's try to squeeze as much dough out of this group as possible.  If the food was to die for, I wouldn't feel as offended, but it ranged from mediocre to downright horrible.  I will probably avoid this place in the future, it's very disappointing to look forward to having dinner at a high end restaurant, pay the high end price, but get short changed on the food and the jacked service.  Especially in this economic climate.

If I was ELP, I'd be pissed that these folks are representing me in such a classless and money grubbing manner.  Yuck!

P.S. In regard to the location - Crystals City Center is basically a high end mall (Louis Vuitton, Van Cleef and Arpels, Tiffany, Prada, Miu Miu, etc), some stores were already open...Bring your big $$$$$!  You can get some fancy stuff.",G66J4Z0l0kXBKBhbgqm1IA,7,0,2,sZZW8in6VVQCmCT_fuH7BQ

The problem is the food. We ordered a chile releno appetizer (couldn't taste the poblano chile at all due to heavy handed seasoning in the filling and the overfrying of the whole thing), a halibut dish with a cactus salsa (pretty good), truffled mac and cheese (very good), a chile-glazed skirt steak (completely underseasoned and cooked rare and bloody instead of the WELL DONE that was ordered and emphasized with the waiter) and potatoes au gratin (gobs of cheap cheese sauce and undercooked potatoes which we didn't eat and they graciously took off the bill). The service was OK at first, until we expressed reservations about some of the dishes. At that point the waiter started taking it personal and we just wanted to get the heck out of there as soon as we could. So 50% of the food was poorly cooked, including the steak! This is not a good score for a restaurant of this price point... an unpleasant eating experience overall.",X6Z8qoi7yN2dvAIxahbeEA,1,0,2,jku6hALfiUz3rSmW7fNLxQ

366218,2012-06-12,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,Last evening June 10 th I  was a guest at the Beso  Steakhouse was visiting from out of town with some very special friends. I was there for work for a couple of days. This evening was put aside to share with friends and have a nice relaxing dining experience. This was not a memorable experience at all. First of all for all of us to decide on a restaurant with such high prices and great location you would think the meal would be outstanding at all. Our reservation was at 8 . we arrived on time and the restaurant was empty. About 5 tables were full. The decor nice facing the aria fountains. The music a bit loud. Well we started with a cocktail order from Paul. Nice guy friendly funny. Our drinks after flagging down someone came  to the table 40 minutes later with an apology 2 to 3 times. We ordered our meal and the food was OK. My halibut was awful. Crusted halibut as dry can be. Awful taste first bite. I had my boyfriend try it as well. It took some time before we could flag down our waiter Paul again. He seemed very flustered when I told him. Paul put another order in. The second order was worse than the first.raw and a pile of salt thrown on.this time the dish arrived wen my friends were already finished with their meal.then we were told a special desert was coming out. I had told our waiter it was my boyfriends birthday.ok now no surprise. The deserts looked amazing with no candle. I mentioned please bring a candle after the deserts arrived. Paul went back and said oh right oh right. He returned with 2 candles on a plate burning was like what the heck! The candles weren't even put into the desert! this experience was a joke but not a joke on our pocket book. After 300 dollars later .,FuOcvWmXnL9IXSmF2VIzSA,0,0,2,W7BBtys6PEWQ6H5n4f4gfQ
375031,2010-04-18,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"I'm not sure why the reviews are so negative on this one. I had dinner on back to back nights at Beso and Olives (both Todd English) and I preferred Beso. Having enjoyed several upscale meals, I agree Beso is not 5 stars, but it is a solid choice. The service was attentive and we were seated right away. They did have a stand for our purses, which I thought was cute. 

I had the Ahi Tuna which was recommended by our server and was wonderful! The fish was cooked perfectly and had a nice spicy crust. The crab and polenta it was severed with were very creamy. I also had a Blueberry Zoo cocktail which I found quite tasty. My husband had the 12 oz fillet (he did say he wished he had order the blue cheese crust). It was cooked properly and he enjoyed it a lot. We had the plantain creme brulee which was nice creamy. I thought it was much better than the creme brulee at Olives (burned crust, not as smooth).

403343,2011-10-13,3,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"Okay people listen to me! As you can see some of these reviews are okay and some are very bad. Let me first mention this in my review; Anyone who comes here because Eva Longoria is the owner is out of their mind. You wouldn't know good acting let alone good food if it sat on your face! People...she is not a cook! She is an actress (word used lightly)! 

My wife and I were at Beso at 8PM on Saturday night. Marky Mark was our waiter (yes he looked just like him which thrilled my wife) and although he was a nice guy he belonged behind the bar at an Outback Steakhouse. Just not very professional and in over his head with a higher end menu. I ordered the Foie Gras as an app. For those of you who have never experienced enlarged/fatten duck liver, I would strongly suggest giving it a try. This in my opinion was good, but would probably have been better with a different approach. It had apricots and vanilla sauce. I wasn't sure if it was a dessert or an appetizer? 

The highlight of the meal was what followed. I had the pleasure of eating the tortilla soup. Now,tortilla soup for me is the one thing I will try at almost any restaurant I am eating at. It is my favorite soup by far. This in my opinion was the best I have every eaten. It was very simple but had a nice mix of heat along with a suttle savoriness that I can't describe. It was without a doubt AWESOME! 

For the main course I selected the bone-in Strip steak. Ordered medium-rare and it came out medium-well! Seriously? Mistakes happen I know, but to be TWO temperatures off just shows a lack of experience and attention to detail. The flavor was okay, but I could tell the steak was not dry or wet aged at all. Just a regular cut of meat with basic seasoning. The Bearnaise sauce is what saved it for me. Now for the second part that ties right along with this. I ordered the horseradish mashed potatoes as my side dish. Literally had unmashed lumps of potatoes everywhere and so much horseradish that it made me think I was eating shrimp cocktail at St.Elmos (if you don't know what this is, look it up). Just not properly mashed? Cmon guys...even the chain restaurants get this step right. 

For dessert, my wife wanted to try Churros! MISTAKE! The caramel sauce on the side was very good even though it was ice cold. The churros had potential, but maybe the chef should change the oil every couple of weeks. It was just dirty and you could tell the oil was old. 

All in all, they are way in over their head at this place. Very expensive and with all the choices in Las Vegas I would avoid this place at all cost. Paying over $225 for an overcooked steak at avg service is not my thing!",ZTI3foFkw6ND93RwOnW3xQ,5,2,2,7XwWZaeaFdJg8kvbScQFxw

As a person who appreciates and enjoys food and tries out new restaurants all the time specifically in Las Vegas, I am pretty surprised to see a restaurant in a great location and with a famous owner be so bad.

The medium filet minion was burned on the outside and dry like cotton on the inside.  The scallops were way too salty and dry as well.  The wild mushrooms and the Au Gratin potatoes were just terrible (more like Friday's).   I guess we should have known how the night was going to turn out after eating the tasteless bread and butter.  Perhaps they had the wrong people in the kitchen on a slow Tuesday night in Vegas because the restaurant was only a fifth full but the service was slooooow!  

Anyway, they took the Fillet off the bill since we did not eat it but it stated on the bill that ""customer did not like"".  I would be happy with that if I ate say an ethnic dish and I was not appreciative of the flavors or something like that.  But how the hell do you screw up a Filet Mignon in a steakhouse?  And then put it on the customer?  Really?

438304,2010-12-13,4,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"I wish I would have read Megan P's review before I decided to cancel my dinner reservations because I was offered a COMP dinner at Beso.  

Two of my girlfriends and I were walking around Fashion Show Mall as a promoter approaches us to ask if we'd like to go to Eve Nightclub that night.  We wanted to go to Haze and XS so we declined.  The promoter (by the way - his name is ANDRE) offers us a comp dinner at Beso Eva Longoria's restaurant at Crystals Mall.  I guess what's the catch right?  Is there a comp limit and we have to pay after we hit the limit?  No, it's a set dinner.  He sets everything up and promises he'll even walk us into Haze and XS afterwards (which I actually believed).  

Here's a review for ANDRE:
He tells you to call him when you're at the restaurant to get you seated.  Well - he doesn't even pick up or return text messages.  Basically, I never even see him again since he approached us at Fashion Show Mall.  He never came to give us our bottle of campagne that he promised either.  AND he never shows up to walk us into Haze or set us up for XS.  On top of that, he gave my number to other promoters (for LAVO) without letting me know.  I guess these promoters get paid by the number of girls they can pull but I've definitely dealt with more reliable promoters that actually keep their word.  

Here's a review for the MEAL:  
We had a party of 9 girls.  We ordered cocktails ($15) and $4 (soda/iced tea/etc).  I ordered the Ginger Cosmo and I'd say I'd definitely not order that off the menu again.  (It was highly recommended by our waitress by the way!)  I didn't think any of the drinks were that great as I sipped my friend's drinks.  

The meal included the following:  (Keep in mind 9 GIRLS!!!)
1.  3 TINY portions of guac and chips.  Guac was OK but I've had better and I felt like the chips were a little stale.  
2.  2 plates of caesar salad.  I mean you can't really go wrong with caesar salad but I don't think the lettuce was very fresh. 
3.  2 plates of steak and potatoes.  The portion on each plate was enough to probably feed 1 person so imagine 4 to 5 girls sharing the portion for 1 person.  I mean yes it's Vegas and we want to look good in our dresses but we also want to eat so we don't get wasted.  Yes, the steak was good - the whole 4 bites that I ate!  It's literally 1 slice per person as it's 5 pieces pre-cut.

I'm sure this meal would have been better if we actually paid to dine at Beso but to be honest promoters should just tell people that it's a comp taste sampling and to come eaten!  I was on my phone yelping the nearest fast food restaurant for us to eat more but this comp meal only takes reservations 9/9:30/10 (they just want you to go to Eve Club even if you don't want to) so it doesn't really allow time to eat meal #2 before trying to get into a club the promoter promised to walk you right in but goes MIA.  I definitely would have rather paid to eat elsewhere and I will probably never step foot into Beso again.

520724,2010-01-09,2,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"Wow. And this is not a good wow at all.

Did NOT expect such bad food here. My fellow diners said they had better steaks from Outback, possibly Sizzler and Cocos.

The waiters seem programmed to try to upsell everything. The only ""amazing"" food on the menu from the kitchen are the highest priced items. 

Considering how much amazing food is available in Vegas, Beso sucks some major donkey balls. The various managers are completely useless.  The manager we got to ""work"" with Chad Jahn is beyond useless. The consensus is that he's an ex-bouncer and doesn't even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant.

There seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working.  I saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing.  None of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. There were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. 

Now, onto the food. Again, WOW. It was beyond awful--once it actually came out.  Apparently our ticket got dropped TWICE by the kitchen. And, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? Uh, that'd be a no.

That's where the wonderful and awfully helpful /insert sarcasm here Chad came over. And he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn't the one trying to sooth things over with us.  Instead, we told him what we expected from our service. Comped food, a steep discount and free dessert/coffee/tea. At least he had the competency to do that, so I guess there is some hope. BUT, the best part is--he wasn't the one telling us. Our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. Isn't that a manager's job?

The waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? I think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. We made sure they were compensated for their work. As for the main tab? Aw hale naw.  Took whatever discount they gave us. Normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. Yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one.  The sad thing is? Even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out AND it wasn't good.

The one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard.

Final report: More style than substance.",ZG9QsCVjrfDK8E6CkBPfEQ,5,0,1,0GEXaZnfeNfY5bHRNn5T8w
557408,2012-01-19,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"The Beso Steakhouse is slightly hidden at the Crystals in City Center on the Strip. Crystals is adjacent to the Aria at the City Center. Take the time to find Beso on the upper level at Crystals and you are very likely to not regret it. The entrance to Beso is not very large, but when you enter the restaurant it opens up to reveal an eloquent eatery. We were taken to the back corner. We were told that this corner was where they would put couples so they could be more romantic. The location made me believe they were telling the truth. It felt more romantic sitting where we were. From the moment we were seated the service people took good care of us. I really enjoyed the look of Beso and look forward to going again.

The appetizer course was very unique and something I have never had presented in this way. We got the meat and cheese plate. The plate came with four types of meat, four types of cheese and crackers to go with them.The meat is specially made for Beso. What tender freshly sliced cured meat they provide. The cheese came from mellow to sharp but were all nicely creamy and tasty.

I ordered the Caesar salad which I was very impressed with. It was a full leaf salad with a subdued dressing. The dressing had a very nice Caesar taste, but it was very light on the tongue. The flavor accented the lettuce and cheese and was not overbearing at all.

The main course I ordered was a bone in rib-eye and my wife had the petite filet. It was almost as if I didn't need a knife to cut the rib-eye. I know this is kind of cliche, but it was like the knife went through the steak as if it were butter. I barley had to chew as well. The rib-eye was so tender and tasty. The flavor was meaty without being to over the top. I like my steaks medium rare. This rib-eye was cooked perfectly with the right amount of marbling; the right amount of fat and the perfect sear. I would have to say that this rib-eye was one of the, if not the best steak I have ever eaten.

Dessert was equally delicious as the rest of the meal. It was a perfect cap to the meal presented. The wine was wonderful. It had a great taste. It was a wonderful balance between sweet and acid. The aroma was well rounded and lingered pleasantly. I am sorry that I do not remember the winery the cab I had was from. I also know the restaurant cannot insure the quality of the wines they serve. But, the selection made by the Sommelier seems to be very thoughtful. My wife enjoyed her wine selection as much as I enjoyed mine.

I found overall that the meal was well worth the price. But it is a four dollar sign restaurant. Because of that, the value is not a 10, but is is still worth the cost and a good value.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,0,0,4,FWhQZNPvjyZBdxDoL6Jj_w

Although the decor was beautiful and we were seated on time, it took them forever to take our drink order and then bring it to us.  I know drink prices can be expensive...but my Red Bull & Vodka in a tumbler glass (small - w/ evidently more Red Bull and perhaps not even a full shot of Vodka) was more expensive than my sister's glass of Red Wine.  Plus, they brought us an extra drink we did NOT order...but left it anyway and charged us for it.  

It took them forever to take our dinner orders.  We finally got served although they forgot half of what we ordered.  The meat we ordered was so so...plus two of my friends had ordered fish and discovered when their meals finally arrived that there was more fat than actual fish on what they had brought.  When we brought it to the server's attention...she argued with us and then brought it to the chef's attention and his response was...""that's just the way it is"".  Then another server came over and after much discussion they took the plates back and requested the chef prepare additional meals for them - but it took a really long time.  To make up for what they finally fessed to being their mistake...they brought us what was obviously a recycled and measly desert for someone's birthday...who did not want it...it said ""Happy Birthday"" on it.  No one with us was celebrating a birthday and it was kind of uncomfortable and really tacky.  None of us touched it.  

To get to a bathroom...you had to take an elevator upstairs to Eva's ""club"".  It was a little inconvenient to say the least.  

All and all...it was not a pleasant experience and when we got the check, I almost fell over!  The check was close to $100 per person, plus they charged us for the food they forgot to bring us, the extra drink (which I mentioned before) and the tacky ""make-up"" desert that we did not order...and we did not eat.  Again, we had to argue.  On top of that...because we were over 6 people...they automatically add the 18% gratuity in.  Believe me...they didn't deserve more than 5% tip after the way were treated!  

To make a long story short...it's unbelievably Over Priced, the food sucked and the service was bad!  I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND it.",rY9w5OZsgBLJJD-Q0wRszQ,1,0,1,xTPY5-NSPDNls2gI4UtZcQ

I just ate here Friday night and couldn't have been more pleased. We had a reservation for 7pm and were sat right away. As for everyone complaining about service we had a waiter, a water boy, a bus boy, someone even brought a little stool for me to put my purse on and someone came and swapped our wine glasses and utensils between each course. 

Yes it was expensive, but we know that going into it. Also, when you order a steak expect the meat on a plate, nothing else. The bread basket was nice and tasty, the guacamole left little to be desired, but my Petite Filet was delicious! I ordered it Medium with the Red Wine sauce and it was delicious. We also had the Skirt Steak and Halibut which I didn't hear anyone complain about! As for sides we just shared some good old Green Beans and Mash.

The guac and chips were good...I think that this is one of Beso's top pick items.  I ordered the filet and it was cooked to perfection; however, I went against my better judgment and ordered it Oscar style which is a cream sauce, with crab meat and asparagus.  Definitely not worth the 12.00 extra bucks.  Steak tacos were OK for my wife's girlfriend but would not satisfy a hungry appetite.  

The restaurant itself was really nice everything you would expect of a Las Vegas establishment on the strip.  It sits adjacent to the Aria Hotel.

My friend and I came with our husbands while we were in Vegas, simply because we're huge Eva Longoria fans. We had no idea what to expect of the food. When we walked in, we were awed by how gorgeous it is in there. Beautiful, beautiful restaurant, very classy. 

It appears the menu has now changed, but 3 of us at the table had the crispy halibut. It was perfection. So, so delicious, and perfectly sized. Actually, it remains one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. 

Service was friendly and fairly fast. 

Unfortunately my husband did not enjoy his meal. He had the pork shank, which he said was sour, greasy, and hard to eat. Actually, it must have been pretty bad, because this was several months ago and it still comes up now and then ;) 

Our drinks were delicious, and dessert was fairly tasty. I had the churros, which were okay, but not amazing. 

Totally not the fault of the restaurant, but there was hardly anyone else dining there, which never feels very festive. If the place had been buzzing, the general experience and atmosphere of the place would be improved.

It was a bit pricey for me, but all in all, a lovely place. If I find myself back in Vegas, I'll be sure to check it out again.",p5Ujmd0SqvYMcgNtfHW8ZA,0,0,4,eec5BTzFd78W-Qu1CZft0A

So far, so good. Beso is stayin' alive. They actually had a large crowd dining last night. I would not expect tables to be near capacity on a Sunday evening, but they did just that.

We received warm bread and soft butter to get us started. That's always a good combo, all too often we run into room temperature bread and ice cold butter.

With the voucher we had our choice of appetizer, two soups or salads, two entrees and a shared dessert - no choice offered, but we could substitute a side dish, if we wanted.

We began with calamari. This was a good version, tender with a light crisp breading. Topped with tomatoes, peppers, cojita cheese and served with lime and two dipping sauces.

Next, we had the Beso Caprese with avocado and the seafood louie salad.
The caprese was the better choice by far, there was nothing notable about the louie - at all. The seafood didn't seem fresh and the salad was overly dressed.

Then, for entrees, Frank had the 16oz NY strip and I went with a 12oz filet. Both were really good, with a nice crust. Neither of us could finish. 

Dessert was churros with caramel sauce and chantilly cream. Yum!

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant just might stay alive.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,2,2,3,7aSkB3Acgw8Ie9iVHMrOGg

the space is ok - nothing really stood out. Place was EMPTY. 

Believe it or not, the person flipping the bill insisted we go in case Ms. Longoria was there so he can make a move ...yeah...good luck ! 

pre-meal cocktail was a boring glass of sauvignon blanc. I order that whenever i ask the bartender for his /her recommendation of any of their specialty drinks ( w/o looking at the drink menu ) and if they say i make anything, i go with wine - take some pride in your drinks bartender ! You must have a few specialty cocktails - better yet, one you've created ! 

we order Eva's guacamole ( $12 ???) , a crab cake ( $18 ) - three of us eating. 
i go with the skirt steak ( $29 ) and sides of asparagus and mushrooms ( i believe both were either $8 or $9 ) 
finish the meal with pineapple upside down cake ( damn - when freeloading, i don't pay close attention to price ! I think around $10 ) 

my thoughts ? 

Guacamole - BORING ! Worse, i'm sure it was pre-made then placed in a fridge for god only  knows how long - the guac was waaay too cold. 

Crab cake - decent . It ain't $18 decent but decent all the same. 

Skirt steak - i thought the menu said chili-rubbed. It may have been then it was slathered with bbq styled sauce. It actually had good flavor and the meat was tender. This was the cheapest steak on the menu - price didn't really matter to me, but it sounded interesting. 

The asparagus and mushrooms ...BORING ! 

Can't remember the wine - it was a cab - told it cost about $100 - ok but so memorable i don't know the name of it. 

The pineapple upside down ? i liked the concept - they bring out the cake in the mini- pan and serve it table side with a dollop of ice cream. Had nice flavor but my only gripe - MORE PINEAPPLE PLEASE ! 

Would i hit Beso on my dime in the future ? NO

The restaurant is gorgeous with huge vaulted ceilings, lots of dark wood and stone and a great open bar. It was very dim and there was a mix of couples, friends, and businessmen throughout. Not a particular vibe since this was in the Cosmo in Vegas. 

Service was top-notch. Nothing to remark on there. The food was outstanding save for one dish. Neither I nor my friend particularly liked the macaroni and cheese. Nothing was 'wrong' with it, we simply didn't care for the flavor. So in exceptional service and expected standards, they took back the item and did not charge us for the meal. 

This is on the steeper end of the price range and I can certainly eat better steak here in Montana but the wine was well-priced and there was overall, nothing to complain about. I definitely enjoyed my experience.

We were pleasantly surprised. We went early at 5pm, with reservations, since we had other things planned that night.  The hostess and wait staff were wonderful.  Our waiter Joseph made several recommendations which we were both pleased with.

We started with the crab cake, which was excellent.  I had the tortilla soup, one of the best I have ever had.  Hubby had the seafood Louie salad, he said it was great, very balanced between the greens and seafood.  He had the Kansas City Strip and I had the New York, both were cooked as ordered and had good flavor and seasoning.  We also added on the grilled asparagus and the garlic mashed potatoes.  We had the churros for dessert, which we found to be light and not greasy at all.

The prices are on par with all the other high-end steakhouses with the ala carte sides.  We felt that even with the additional costs, along with the voucher, we got what we paid for.  The decor is lovely, especially with the added view of looking out toward the fountain at the Aria.

I thought it was really nice of them to comp our dinner, especially with 9 ladies all together.

It all began with champagne.  When the first server (very nice) started to serve champagne to us, she had run out of it after 3 glasses.  She then opened another bottle and continued pouring.  Another female server rushed over and asked: why did you open another bottle for them and then whispered something to the first server.

5 minutes later, another server came to us and told us that our dinner included appetizer, tossed salad, steak, and a bed of mashed potatoes, which sounded amazing, right? Not even close.

We got  2 tiny servings of guacamole with a very light portion of tortilla chips, and I think the chef forgot to season it with, you know, salt, onion, and whatever recipe it calls for.  0 star.

The steak was a joke.  It had no flavor, overcooked, and lukewarm.  There were literally 8 pre-cut pieces of steak for 9 people, with a bed of mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes was the best part of the meal, but then again, all of us shared a one person meal.  

I would have been fine to pay the $10 tips if the service was good, but we had to call 4 different servers to get some iced water, after we had already waited 10 minutes.  So we paid $90 for this crappy meal.  Was it worth it?  I'd rather give a homeless guy my $10 then spending it at Beso.",iae-CZiUdane79SDkfMwOg,6,0,1,33cTfaSEps331CFZWjyBbw

A couple of good things - the reader's reviews are highly accurate and reliable, except for the ones that rated this restaurant with four or five stars.   And it seems that after being in business for more time and overcoming opening issues, they have managed to be very consistent as to food (not in a good way)....

Facilities are interesting and creative; service was for the most part, bordering on the overly attentive, as two waitresses are assigned to the table.  They were friendly and generally informative (in that sort of I don't go out to places like this much, but Beso seems like a cool restaurant........).

Food was mediocre at best - guacamole must have been made days before and lacked any freshness; paella tasted like paste, chicken was dry, and lobster was mushy; ceviche was tasted fishy.   All of this culminated in massive worries about waking up with food poisoning the next day which fortunately, didn't occur.  That said, the food wasn't worth the price or our effort to go there, and there are many better places in Las Vegas to try.

And btw - if you like martinis with blue cheese olives, they list a very tasty one on the menu - but beware if you order three or more olives for this $15 martini - they will charge you $3 per each additional olive over 2.......

What was also very good was that having a full house our server was always checking on us, but without the hurrying us out the door, so every need we had , was met!

We were both in the mood for a nice steak and after asking around we were told that Beso was known for their great Steaks. When we got there they were very nice and accommodating even though we hadn't made reservation ahead of time they were able to seat us immediately.
As soon as we sat down are server Cherrie welcomed us in and introduced herself to us. She was so nice and helpful, my wife wasn't sure what she wanted to drink since she doesn't drink very often so Cherrie suggested a couple of different cocktails, she ended up having the Sangria and completely loved it. I in the other hand asked to see the wine list and was very impressed by their nice selection.
 I ordered a glass of Merlot we also started off with the Guacamole and Taqueria tasting which were both excellent. Then I had the Tortilla soup and we shared the Cesar Salad.
For are main course my wife had a filet, I had the bone in Rib eye Oscar style and we shared a side of Truffle Smashed Potatoes, 
The Steaks we ordered Medium rare and they came out cooked to perfection, truth be told this has got to be the best steak we have ever had.
I like going out with my wife we enjoy each other's company and Beso really hit the spot from beginning to end we will definitely be back for more.",2JDEF3kGzme0gcFGnOJkJw,2,1,5,sJQmrSeb7ivVndK2mVdCpw

The drinks were $15 a piece, which is slightly pricey but they were good.

A promoter for the club- Eve, which is upstairs, came by and asked if we wanted to get in for free.  He gave us wristbands.  Once he found out we were locals, he gave us his card and said for us to come back for dinner and he would comp it.  Will do! :)

I must say-- after reading all the horror stories about the staff being rude and the food being less than par, I was a little worried. One of my girlfriends coordinated the dinner-- she told us she had been in constant contact with the restaurant, making reservations and providing the restaurant with our voucher information before hand. 

Our reservation was for a Saturday Night at 6 p.m and we arrived at about 6:10. No problem-- we were welcomed kindly and seated promptly. Our server was Joseph. Surprise-- he was great! He explained to us all of the limitations to the Travel Zoo voucher upfront and in a respectful manner. He told us about all the food he enjoyed and answered our questions with ease. Here is what my boyfriend and I ate:

Bread Basket: Pretzel bread, chip, dinner rolls. The stand out bread here is the pretzel bread! All the bread was soft and warm. 

Foie Gras to Share: Delicious! The toast, jelly and Foie Gras was such a delightful combination. The jelly really caught my taste buds off gaurd.

Tortilla Soup: When you ordre this, the soup is poured into your bowl at the table. It was very filling. The soup had just the right amount of spice and started to fill me up, so I didn't finish all of it so I could finish my dinner.

Crab Louie Salad: This is a simple salad with a hard boiled egg, crab meat and a tangy dressing. It was ok-- because it was a little more expensive we were given a smaller portion, which was fine by my boyfriend and I because we still had a porterhouse coming for an entree. 

Porterhouse: My boyfriend and I ordered the porterhouse (for items above $55, there is an upcharge of $10-$20 for the larger steaks) which was delicious As expected, the bone was pretty heavy. I'd guess it was probably about 10-15 oz on its own. The meat was tender and cooked how we'd like it. But it was JUST meat-- no sides or anything. After the bread basket, Foie Gras and Tortilla Soup, this was all I probably could have ate anyway. Some of my friends got the petite filet-- if you ordered that, you got a side for free. I got to taste the Tuna Adobo-- that was surprisingly sweet and filling. 

Dessert: Chocolate Kiss Brownie. It paired well with the ice cream, and the sauce was a treat. But mind you, it was just a brownie, nothing too flashy. 

At the end, we were charged a 15% gratuity per pair and tax came out to around $6.75. We were also charged a $20.00 up charge for ordering the porterhouse.

We started with oysters and Eva's Guac. They served Kumos on the half shell that were very sweet and buttery. The guacamole was better than most and the chips were thin and crisp, but while good for sharing it wasn't anything to write home about.

The entrees were absolutely FANTASTIC. We ordered the Alaskan King Crab Legs (Market Price) and the Lobster Tail (Market Price) with an order of Wild Mushrooms and a special request.

On my previous visit, I enjoyed the Mac'n Cheese with Truffle Butter and recalled a different variation which had Lobster and both were no longer on the menu. I politely inquired about the possibility of making us an order with both the Truffle Butter and Lobster and our server and the kitchen staff were happy to oblige. It was a match made in heaven and a flavourful combination.

To finish off our meal and cleanse our pallets, we chose to go with a sorbet/ice cream dessert. It came with three scoops with three very distinct flavours: Pineapple, lychee, and guanabana (soursop). Each were an excellent way to complete a meal.

Our server was absolutely spectacular and attentive, our seating was comfortable, and the decor is  excellent.

I will continue to return and enjoy great meals at Beso. While I didn't have it on this visit, I also recommend the Skirt Steak. Even though it's their cheapest cut, it is superbly flavoured and it's tenderness even at medium (which was recommended, even though I like my steaks rare) was delightful.

We were excited to try the steaks here. But to our disappointments, mine and a friend's filets were served at room temperature. After some debate on whether or not to bring this to the waiter's attention, we decided to say something to him. The waiter was extremely apologetic and took both our steaks back. My friend decided he did not want to risk another lukewarm steak while I decided to give it another shot! This of course was the 2nd bad call of the night (the 1st one being to dine here).

As soon as we order we talked about the rudeness of the waiterand how surprised he was when we ordered outside the ""Deal,"" but eventually our drinks came and our food. Delicious. Also I met Big Boy from Power 106.

As i explained my disapproval of his service, he was actually very professional and stated ""You should tip me as you think I perform my job.""

It was our servers first day, and I'm more than willing to cut a new server some slack, but what happened was ridiculous.

For entree I ordered the filet which was cooked well but tastes nowhere near what their steaks tasted like 2 years ago when I frequently ate there.  

I asked the waiter to add a lobster TAIL to the steak.

When the food came out, the waiter brought our steaks, and a WHOLE lobster.  I asked another server to get ours because we ordered a tail and not the whole lobster.

About 5 minutes later our server came over and tried to tell me that what was on the table WAS a lobster tail. 

Funny - i've never seen a lobster tail with claws, legs, and a body before.

My friend and I were already into our steaks when he took the whole lobster away and said he would look into it.

15 mins later he comes back - still no lobster tail, and I was almost done with my steak and we were in a rush so I told him to just forget the tail if it was gonna take longer.

Then he disappears for another 15 mins.  I asked another server to please grab him and he came out and I asked for the check.

Another 10 minutes goes by and so we walked in to see if the check was ready and what was taking so long. (we ate outside)

The manager was adjusting the bill - and this is what REALLY pissed me off.

The manager says ""since you ordered the whole lobster and then cancelled it and then ordered the tail and then cancelled it Im charging you for the tail.

I said - ""No - I ordered just a tail to begin with""  

He says ""No you didn't my server told me you ordered the whole lobster.  I trust my server""

And wanted to stand there and argue with me about it telling me I was lying about ordering just the lobster tail.

I told him I was almost done with my meal and the tail still wasn't there which was why I cancelled it.

He didn't want to hear any of it, and got a really smug attitude with me.

At no other nice restaurant on the Vegas  strip will you see this sort of treatment of a customer.  He stood there blatantly calling me a liar right to my face, when both my friend and I tried to tell him the server was the one who fucked up.  Not me.

My review: 

Recently went to Beso for a Bachelorette party dinner. ONLY because I had to. I wouldn't make a conscious decision to visit this restaurant otherwise - I don't care how trendy this place claims to be. Though it may look really pretty on the surface, I don't think a restaurant should have to try so hard to look the part. Let the food speak for itself. And speak it did. And just like its owner, it spoke LOUD - obnoxiously and annoyingly loud! Over seasoned side dishes,  cold, and under cooked meat though charred and too salty on the outside (I ordered medium well, and got medium (barely) and somewhat inattentive service. 

Beso claims to be a Latin-inspired steakhouse, contemporary and elegant. Though the space was stunning, quasi-elegant and contemporary I found the food to be un-inspiring, with very little Latin flavor. Just because you offer tacos, tortilla chips and chili relleno as starters, doesn't make for latin-inspiration. Latin flavors, should be integrate throughout all dishes on the menu.

To top it off, the restaurant lost out reservation hours before we were set to arrive at the restaurant, despite our confirming and reconfirming weeks and days before the trip. Luckily, Beso wasn't so busy so they were able to re-reserve our reservation and seat us pretty quickly.

If I were to live my life without ever entering this restaurant again I would be very content.

Of course with 13 people we had a variety...the Lobster, was bad, smelled bad, rubbery and under cooked in some cases. The steak was small and I asked for medium rare, it was served well done. No one was satisfied, and EXTREMELY disappointed....we expected so much more from Eva and Todd English, does cute little Eva know her restaurant is run like s--t or does she not care? 

Okay, so we said something to the giant Manager Chad that the food was horrible, he looked at me like I was crazy and said,, ""what can I do,"" I said it is to late now....then I asked him who was the General Manager, he then gets ROY the GM...who hired this loser...first of all I think he was buzzed as he was sweating and shaking like a leaf as well, was a as arrogant, and a pompous a--!

2979538,2011-04-24,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"My wife and I celebrated our eleventh anniversary last night by going to Beso Steakhouse at the City Center. We hadn't been there before and wanted to try something different. Of course, being the signature restaurant for the hot and beautiful Eva Longoria, we had high hopes.

The reservation process was simple. We made the reservation online in about 1 minute and indicated on the reservation form that it was our anniversary.

While our high hopes weren't dashed, they were somewhat dampened. First, the restaurant is beautiful inside, tasteful, dark and understated decor. The servers prompt and attentive (almost too attentive at times) but we never had to look around wonder where they were. I'd give them good marks for service although when we arrived we were the earlier diners. The place did fill up quickly after we arrived, although I'm sure it had nothing to do with our being there.

We were given menus along with a drink menu and recommendations. We were also promptly brought small but delicious glasses of champagne with congratulations for our anniversary. Kudos for that touch.

We ordered drinks and the waiter said he would wait and bring those with our food since we were enjoying the champagne.

We took our time ordering, starting with a crab Louie salad which we shared. It was well prepared, delicious and adequate for the two of us to share. The greens were fresh and crisp and the asparagus spears steamed but still crisp.

Since we were in no rush, we ordered dinner after the salad was finished so that threw off their timing a little and it took awhile to get  there which was no problem for us. We ordered the 20 oz. filet mignon with butter steamed lobster and a side dish of macaroni and cheese. 

Moments before the food arrived, our waiter brought the drinks we had ordered...for Kath a pineapple surprise. I think the surprise was that it was pink and didn't taste like pineapple but it was tasty and not too sweet. I had a margarita rocks with Herradura silver tequila that was wonderful.

 The entree was well prepared and as ordered. The mac and cheese hot and tasty, not too creamy like some.

We were stuffed by the end of the entree but couldn't resist two cappuccino and what we expected was a small dessert. Surprisingly, the capps were served in over-sized cups with loads of foam rather than those dainty cups that I can never get my sausage fingers through. We ordered the pineapple upside down cake (any theme here) and it came out baked to order in a small iron cauldron which the waiter upended on a plate leaving a cake the size of a small derby. Two bites and we were done.

OK, great service, terrific food and not the usual 'pea-sized' portions of higher end restaurants. So why the three stars. OK, here's my thoughts on that. Dinner was about $200 with the tip...not unexpected, even though we split the salad, entree and dessert. 

So for a good meal for two, you could expect to get closer to $350 or so, if you didn't split. For that price level, one would expect something truly special, something outstanding but it just was your average really good steakhouse and Vegas abounds with those sorts of places for less. Think Del Frisco's on Paradise.

So without a doubt, it was a wonderful and magical evening but more because I was sharing it with my wonderful wife of eleven years than any other reason.",ENcAGHpKz-37bObY4TVSkQ,8,2,3,K3pUucnSafKyBnGdnMgjFQ

We each got a Caesar Salad, uncut iceberg lettuce with a crouton wrapped around the lettuce and dressing. It was a fancy looking salad but that was about it.

Wow, surprised at all of the bad reviews here.  Not my experience at all, so bucking the trend.
 Beso is the restaurant collaboration of Eva Longoria and Chef Todd English.  Where better to dine than at the restaurant of one of the Desperate Housewives?
Located in the Crystals shopping complex, Beso takes full advantage of its location with floor to ceiling windows that overlook the entrance to the Aria Hotel and the entire City Center complex. This total immersion into the cityscape works quite nicely and compliments the decor.  I would describe the decor of Beso as ""modern luxury"".  Half circle banquettes line the windows and the outer walls of the restaurant with a sea of detached tables in between.  Walls, floors and tables in dark lush woods work harmoniously with crystal chandeliers that drip light from the ceiling like a rain shower of light, glistening and trickling above the diners.  The chandeliers are made from the Swarovski Crystal curtain that was featured at the 2009 Academy Awards. The lighting is suitably dark to make the atmosphere both relaxing and romantic. Pulsing club music played in the background and I scrutinized the music, thinking that it was perhaps a bit too frenetic. I finally decided that it was actually a good match for the overall feel of the restaurant.
I truly believe that atmosphere is an integral part of the dining experience and Beso has created an atmosphere that is very, as they put it, luxuriously hip.  Yes, atmosphere is important to me, but the cuisine needs to live up to the atmosphere as well.  I am happy to say that Beso delivers on both counts.  Beautifully presented, each dish we had was prepared and seasoned perfectly.  First course for my companion was the Shellfish Tower, consisting of Maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, oysters, little neck clams. P.EI. mussels and ceviche. It was accompanied by sauces in which to dip the seafood, from cocktail sauce, sangria mignonette and horseradish to grainy mustard aioli and fresh lemons and limes.  Originally from New England, my companion is a giant shellfish lover and he gave two thumbs up to the Shellfish Tower.  I started our meal with the Beso Beso salad, a salad of bibb lettuce with a champagne vinaigrette and halves of yellow and red pear tomatoes.  The simplicity of the freshness of the lettuce and the light and flavorful vinaigrette made this a perfect starter for me.
Now on to the main course.  My companion had the Filet Mignon, ordered Medium Rare but on the rare side.  Upon cutting into the filet, it proved to be a bit too rare and was sent back for a few more minutes on the grill.  But that is exactly why it had been ordered on the rare side, because you can always cook it more, but if it is too done, you are out of luck.  Upon its return, the filet was cooked to my companion's tastes perfectly.  He also complimented the tenderness and flavor of the filet.  Mdivani, the vegetarian, opted for a plate of their sides: grilled asparagus, wild mushrooms and sauteed green beans.  I also ordered a side of their Herb Beso Fries.  The vegetables and mushrooms were all perfectly prepared and seasoned.  I thoroughly enjoyed this vegetable platter and the Beso Fries were excellent.  In fact, they were a little too good and I ended up fighting over them with my companion :)  Beso has a great wine list and a lovely bottle of merlot accompanied the meal quite nicely. 
I was stuffed by this point, considering I had indulged in a late afternoon chardonnay and appetizer break at the Bellagio a few hours earlier.  However, I had to try at least one of their deserts.  On a waiters recommendation, we tried the Cinnamon Sugar Dusted Churros with chantilly cream and caramel sauce.  These are NOT the churros that you find at Disneyland at all.  They were slightly crispy on the outside and remarkably light and airy on the inside with just the right amount of cinnamon sugar dusting them.  The caramel sauce for dipping was very flavorful without being overly sweet.  None of the churros stayed on the plate for very long.

I don't always have the best of service in restaurants (I seem to wear my invisibility cloak when dining out).  At Beso, the service lived up to the atmosphere and decor.  The waiters were extremely friendly and attentive as were the support staff and made sure that our every need was taken care of.
As mentioned earlier, Beso is owned by Eva Longoria, but there is nothing desperate about this place and I would highly recommend giving it a try.

To our surprise, it was just a complete mess. Mind you, our reservations were at 9:45p and the restaurant wasn't even packed.

The waiter greeted us and took our cocktail order. Once those were served, he came back and took our appetizer and meal order. We liked the cocktails and after a 15 mins, the appetizers came out and we were so excited for our meal to come. We ordered the ceviche (ehhh!), foie gras (delicious!), salmon carpaccio (good!), crab cakes (Yum!) and one more dish (obviously forgot... wasn't that great!)

Our dinner order consisted of 5 petit filets (1- well done and 4 - medium) and the following for sides: mac and cheese, asparagus, creamed spinach. We waited for over 45 mins for the dinner meal after they cleared our appetizer plates. When we called on our waiter about the dinner he said, ""Well, what do you expect on a Saturday night!"" (The restaurant was half empty, SERIOUSLY! It's now, 11pm) Finally, the meal came at 11:15pm. All the sides were cold and the only filet cooked correctly was the well done filet. The 4-medium ones were done rare. We called on the manager and he apologized for the meal and was going to put in another order for us... WHY SO WE CAN WAIT LONGER!?! I don't think so. After talking to him we just decided we aren't staying anymore... poor service, horrible employees and aside from a few good appetizers, this place needs a reailty check on how to run a successful restaurant business. 

Not recommended and suggest that you don't visit there either. Sorry, Eva, I'm not a fan!!!",I8BTQ2Yr-iQ55JmagQ3MdQ,2,0,1,lV4fNdX9h27NAtBRSIn0SA
3516062,2011-11-03,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"-----DINNER USING TRAVEL ZOO-------
Ok, with all the horrendous travel zoo reviews I read, I was really reluctant to come here (but had to since the voucher was expiring and there were no refunds). So the disclaimer here is that my expectations were super low.

That being said, this place was surprisingly really good! Maybe it was a change in management or maybe Beso read the horrendous reviews and finally got better but whatever it was, this was a great dinner. The ambiance is very modern chic; typical of what you'd see in LA joints. The service was very attentive and friendly, both at the bar and during dinner.

Here's what we got for our voucher for 2 people:
2 glasses of champanage
1 shared appetizer (all appetizers were available)
2 soups or salad (all soup/salads were available)
2 entrees (any entr√©e under $54 was available)
1 shared dessert (sounds like all the desserts were available but we didn't see a menu. They just read the listings off to us)

Seared foie gras - Good but the foie gras was sliced pretty thin so getting that really good flavor in the middle was kind of missing. It's still good but not sure if I'd pay the full price for such a thin slice.
Tortilla soup - Now THIS is good. This is one of the signature dishes and at first, it doesn't look like much but the flavor is pretty savory and I like the tortilla flakes that add that crunchy texture to the soup.
Seafood louie -It's got all my favorite ingredients into one and tastes great. If you're paying full price though, I don't know if it's really worth it. But it is good.
12 oz filet mignon and 16 oz ribeye -Okay, let me just say that both meat portions were HUGE and the meat was cooked VERY well. Both were ordered medium rare and it came out exactly that way. They did a fantastic job with the filet mignon and ribeye.
Chocolate dessert -This was a heavier way of ending the meal but this is good too. Probably not the best idea though if you're stuffed from dinner because this will push you over the edge.

So all in all, I think this place is actually pretty great. Again, there were some items that I think I'd get at the regular and some that, while they were good, weren't worth the full price (but totally worth the voucher). Our servers were super attentive and friendly too. Everyone, from the waiter to the busboys, was friendly. One thing to note though is that our first server had been more vague about the voucher and said that for desserts, you only get the donuts. However, the 2nd guy had broken down what was included in the voucher and offered more options for dessert so not sure why there was that discrepancy. But anyhow, this place exceeded my (low based on yelp review) expectations.",4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww,0,0,4,WFxTMBwrHW9BcIqkabvFHQ
3542798,2010-09-07,1,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"I absolutely Loved this place! The food was amazing. To begin, the bread they serve, was warm and tasty. My table ordered oysters as  appetizers, but I didn't try them since I'm not a fan of oysters. They seemed to truly enjoy them.  

For entrees, my fiance and I ordered Filets. My steak was flavourful and delicious! The quality of the meat spoke for itself and didn't need any of the additional sauces that they serve as an option. As my fiance described it, the steak ""cut like butter"" and it just melted in my mouth Since everything is served a la carte, we ordered many different sides and shared amongst out trable. We tried the fries, the corn, the mac and cheese. Completely satisfied with our meal. 
I ordered a $14 glass of shiraz and my waitress let me try it before pouring it all. I thought that was very nice of her.

Eva Longoria's special guacamole tasted like any other guac. The bread and the butter were less than good..the bread was cold.
And since they were sold out on the lamb, I had filet with foie gras on top and the steak was salty. It had nothing to do with the foie; I think their steak rub is on the salty side.

The service was good but, I'm not sure if it's cuz that's how they normally are or cuz we complained to the manager prior to service.
Day before dinner, we went to Eve (the club upstairs) and were treated badly by their bouncers.

p.s. The restaurant's women's bathroom is upstairs (in said club) and I thought that was weird because I saw all the bartenders, goo dancers, and servers before club opening.

3668257,2010-07-27,1,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"Red Bull is (to use my friend, Andrew's, favorite phrase), ""An abomination to the Lord."" It tastes like poison. I have never appreciated a drink that contained Red Bull. I always order red bull drinks, though, hoping that someone, somewhere or somehow, has stirred a powerful set of liquids together to magically make the taste of Taurine disappear. Beso's strawberry martini effectively hides the bite of Taurine by pairing it with complimentary flavors. The martini is not too sweet. It's absolutely delicious. I would return to Beso just for that drink.

The Chocolate Martini is the best I have ever had, and I typically don't enjoy chocolate martinis because they're too sweet, liquory, creamy or coffee-y. Beso manages to accomplish the tough balance among those flavors.

I was sharing these martinis with my BF, in case you're wondering why I ordered drinks with flavors I normally don't like. 

I can only recommend drinks at the bar because I haven't tried the food. The bartenders are quick, talented, and super friendly. We probably paid $15-20 for each martinis.",6Y-l3x4LpUNhTBVMTFmTmA,1,1,4,HkZ7671B3pVfePE50Yn0MA

3826173,2010-01-09,6,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"Beso Off  is the best way to put it. A restaurant that needs to be shuttered - and in a city where there are many other choices, most likely will not continue to survive as the place does not seem to really care about the issues with the restaurant.

And cheap food  - as in quality, not price. Or, the head chef is just way too enamored with salt, which is usually used to hide the cheap flavoring of sub-par steaks, especially the way that they slather it on everything.

So, this is a cluster beyond clusters. We came here for a business dinner because the Los Angeles location has good reviews. Big mistake.

The wait, etc was not bad. We made a reservations, they sat us when we had more than 50 percent of our party there. The wait staff - Craig and Angie - were super nice, very charming and had more common sense than the assistant manager on duty, Chad Jahn. Yep, totally using the full name.

So, let's start with the cluster:

A) Fire in the kitchen (grease fire) that made the whole place smoky. The grill is right there, so you can ""see"" them cooking steaks. Big whoop, sorta cool, but OBVIOUSLY too small for a restaurant of the size. And, apparently, the back kitchen is just as bad.

B) Our salads/soups come out fine - nothing spectacular, but not terrible - and then we wait for the steaks. And wait. And wait. Oh, by the way, it's only 8.30 when we sit down but they're already out of the bone-in filet which the waiter talked up. How do you run out of a steak by 8.30 PM? Kitchen incompetence??

C) We're still waiting for our steaks. It's a good 45 minutes post-finishing our salads and appetizers. We're still waiting. And still waiting.

D) Angie and Craig are proactive, and good wait staff; they come up to us and apologize about the wait. It's not their fault - the kitchen is run by incompetents, but they do their job and do it well. 

E) The steaks come out ... medium rare. Not the medium that was ordered but the medium rare. We send them back, and one comes back ... charred on the outside, but still rare/medium rare. He's too nice to send it back, and the issue is that the kitchen is backed up so just sending out steaks. Good way to settle a problem with an incompetent kitchen staff: send out undercooked meat and hope they don't send it back to cause more setback in the kitchen. Idiots.

F) I ask for the manager - the man with no freakin' sense to come to our table. This would be Chad Jahn, who looks like a former bouncer that has been elevated to restaurant manger. Demote him back to bouncer, that's what he seems he'd be good at. We talk to him, tell him the issues ... and he never checks up on us again. Good management skills, asshat!! Oh, and he doesn't acknowledge our issues when we leave. He did take care of the bill, but I think he had to be told to do that (I told him we're getting free desserts). 

G) I got churros. I like churros. The churros at Costco are better than Beso. Um, useless kitchen staff, churros are served hot. 

H) So, while walking outside with the colleague for her to smoke, we pass by former colleagues and they ask how it went. We told them it sucked, to leave. There was this long-haired guy listening to us. I'd noticed him for a bit walking around, so I said ""are you one of the owners"" and he said, no, he's just waiting for a friend. Um, found out he is one of the owners. If, as an owner, you cannot take responsibility for your poor service and food, the restaurant as a whole are doomed. Nice sidestepping and not taking ownership, long-haired 80's rocker looking dude!! His (or Chad's) solution to the fire and the wait was to offer free Sangria. Thanks, and those that don't drink thank you also. Idiots.

I) Like I noted, the food was salty. The steaks had a salt layer that should not be necessary if they are really Harris Ranch. The string beans, mushrooms and other vegetables were slathered with salt as well. Salt is a lazy additive for poor quality and tasting food. Draw your own conclusions here. 

We got out of there 3 1/2 hours later, when it should have been 1 1/2 hour dinner. It's not because we were socializing, but because it was just waiting and waiting and waiting and then sending back food and waiting. The place is a train wreck rapped up in hipster clothing (well, like most things hipster) and the management (and owner) seem unable to manage or take ownership of the problems and issues. Good riddance for when it shuts down (the chef should not be a head chef), but our wait staff rocked and should be at a better place.

Eva Longoria Parker should be ashamed her name is associated with this place. But, it might not be that long before others force it out. I heard Mastro's is opening in Vegas...

Waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu but pushy in the up-selling ""add ons"" for our filet's to the point where my hubby was getting a little pissed at the hard sell. Best pear martini I have ever had and the food portions were generous! Fillet melted in your mouth. Creamed spinach was divine, garlic mashed potatoes were creamy and garlicky. Pricey a bit.

My friends and I were invited over by a promoter on the strip. It was a Saturday night and we were dressed for and on our way to the club. He told us that we would have dinner and drinks for free at Besos and would have free entrance into the club that was just nextdoor, Eve(see review). This was around the time when Aria hotel had just opened so we were stoked!

Things went exactly as he said they would. We got a free meal and free glass of Champagne. It was very crowded in there too. Everyone was dressed nicely, they were chatting and drinking their lives away. This is the kind of atmosphere I enjoy!! LOL

 I only ordered a salad because I didn't want my stomach to expand any larger than it already was in my skin tight dress! The salad was decent good and my glasses of champagne, even better. We sat at the bar and the bartender was so nice, very personable and funny.

Im not exactly sure what the prices were like here but the restaurant is inside of ARIA so I would say $$$$ sounds about right!",ZdkzBEMzY1DL4-snIRZThQ,0,0,4,_VOeU9otcBc0wT2DyjgVFg

When we first came in, I informed the hostess that we had a Travelzoo voucher (4 courses plus champagne for 2 for $79), to which she snickered with the hostess next to her.  A little rude!  

We had reservations and were seated right away.

Our waiter initially was a little rude to us too, telling us the things we couldn't order on the menu.  Our voucher didn't say there were any limitations, so it was a little surprising.  In any case, it's Vegas and we rolled with it.  When asked for beverage choices, we told him we wanted water (we don't drink soda and were already a few cocktails in) and he told us ""oh...you want the REGULAR water?"" as though the regular water was crap.  As my boyfriend imitated later, ""oh, you want the peasant water?""  Regular water was fine by the way!

For our appetizer, we ordered the chile relleno which was alright.  Not bad, but not notable either.  We both ordered the beso beso salad.  The orange vinegarette was a little odd for my taste but was alright as well.   The delicious part came with our 12 oz filet mignon steaks.  My my they were tasty!  Our dessert was churros which came with a delicious caramel dipping sauce.  The champagne, however, not so delicious.

We were surprised that gratuity was automatically included for a table of 2.  Don't restaurants only do that for larger parties?  I guess they wanted to make sure they were being tipped on the $198 which the meal was worth.     

The jury is out as to whether or not I would come back next time I'm in Vegas.  The food was good but the rude treatment makes me want to take my business elsewhere.",G-c2Q3XkKvSxFnSqC1N9Vg,5,0,3,KywjzaBP6DoZAnHN_Ec_Lg

I've eaten at a lot of restaurants in Vegas but have never had a wait staff so blatantly disregard my initial response.

Way to pricey for bad food..... Also not sure that I understand why you would build a million dollar restaurant with no bathrooms on the same floor. You have to go to the night club after taking a elevator ride with a big ass door man that expects a tip for doing nothing.

I love real caesar dressing, anchovy, garlicky, vinaigrette- not that creamy stuff that you get in a jar.  The salad looked like a piece of artwork but over all, too tart and too creamy.

When our entrees came out- my man's looked delish! Mine, eh, not so appetizing.  His steak was perfectly cooked, the mac n cheese was spot on and the asparagus nicely done, not overcooked.

My paella, I'm afraid was not great, well at least not for what we paid for..the rice was undercooked and the seafood slightly overcooked. Oh well, happy birthday to me right?

So we got dressed after a long day at the Marquee Day club with some girlfriends from Santa Monica, who were in town for a bachelorette party. A great coincidence for us. Anyway, we were starving and could not wait to tear down some exquisite pieces of the finest animal flesh a bunch of cave men could inhale. We filled up 4 private taxi's and off we went. 

The place is nicely dressed and that's about the extent of the good parts. The service was decent considering that the place wasn't even packed, the food was bland, and good drinks are everywhere nowadays. We drank, we ate, we laughed, looked cool, and left. 

Beso's is not a place I would come back to again, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone for any reason, and I don't mean that in a mean way. Just as honest as possible. I actually will never brag nor mention having been there to anyone. The only reason I even considered writing about it is because, I may actually help someone save well earned cash.

Was excited to try the menu.  Our group of 12 dined at 7 and here are the comments.
Service: The servers were very attentive but not intrusive.  Patient with each diner as decisions were made
Paella:  Was executed poorly.  In addition to extremely overcooked, gummy and tasteless rice, the seafood was over cooked.  This should not be left on the menu.
Hamburger:  Was overly sauced, the fries were cold, and overall, it was a flop
Shrimp Louie:  Was extremely salty.  the greens were prepared with a pickling spice. Along with the extreme spiciness, was inedible.
Grilled asparagus:  Was limp, overcooked and extremely salty.  Inedible
Grilled salmon:  Requested it cooked to medium, it arrived cold at the center.
Skirtsteak: Ordered it medium-rare, it also arrived well done.
Lobster Mac & Cheese -- was fantastic.  This, along with the the white chocolate dinner rolls were the quite nice.
Service was great, the restaurant is new and the lighting is great.  
All in all, ingredients were top-notch but the executiion needs attention.

Yes this place is uber expensive but it is ohhhhhh so good and worth it.  I love the modern feel and energy of this place and their grill chef cooks your steak perfectly.  Been here twice and it was spot on each time.  I get the small filet mignon and a side of augratin potatoes.  The steak is juicy and extremely flavorful.  The potatoes are super cheesy and the best I have ever had.  i ate the whole damn side myself and you know what?  i didn't care.  They were that good! :)  If I thought I could have gotten away with it I would have licked the bowl clean...lol

The cocktails were awesome but pricey.  $15.00 each is a little pricey even for a hot Vegas locale.

We started with a delicious bottle of Flowers Pinot Noir... mmmmm... and a shrimp cocktail.  The standard cocktail sauce that it was served with was fine, but they give you extra horseradish and lemon on the side, so we kicked ours up.  Delicious.  The shrimp was fresh and sweet, if a little on the small side.  They're basically what normal shrimp should look like, but after receving the jumbo prawns the size of small lobsters that most restaurants serve these days, they just looked a little skimpy.  I also tried the BBO blood orange martini with jalapeno (I think?  or habanero?).  I had actually hoped for more heat, but this was good drink.

For a salad, I chose the beet salad with candied walnuts and goat cheese fondue.  Oh my god.  That goat cheese fondue was incredible.  Really a great salad.  My husband had the chopped salad with tons of veggies, queso fresco and avocado ranch.  It was a great salad, it definitely had Mexican flavors and he enjoyed it.

For dinner, I had a seabass with a buerre blanc (I think maybe jalapeno?), avocado chunks, tomatoes, crispy potatoes and asparagus.  It was absolutely delicious.  The skin was served on the fish, which is not my preference, but it came off easily and really wasn't a big deal. My husband had a Kansas City strip steak.  The steak was cooked perfectly (MR) and had amazing flavor from a rub or seasoning.

Our server, when mentioning the specials and talking about his suggestions, said ""we have truffles, so you can pretty much have them in anything, truffle mac and cheese, truffle mashed potatoes, etc"", so we couldn't pass up the truffle mac and cheese, and it was to die for.  It was creamy without being overwhelmingly cheesy, and the truffles were amazing.  We couldn't stay out of it.

Our server was really great, had a cute personality, and was very helpful.  Service was actually very quick, we basically had barely finished our salads and our entrees arrived.  We had no problem getting reservations on a Friday for dinner that evening at 8:30 (I made the reservations around lunch time), however, when I rechecked availability around 6:00 p.m., they were fully booked up.

To start, we ordered the Paella Arancini ($13).  Our waiter brought out 3 round crusted balls... wha??  It turned out to be really good.  A lot of flavor, it's like eating a bite-size version of paella.  Nice start.

We both opted for salad... I had the BLT Salad ($11) while my boyfriend ordered the Beso Beso Salad ($14).  Nothing fancy or unique that made these salads stand out.  The bacon was thick and salty and somewhat overpowering over the rest of the salad including the bleu cheese dressing.

For our  main entree, since they were out of the Kansas City Strip (a steakhouse out of steak on a Saturday  night???), I had the 12oz Filet Mignon cooked 'medium' ($42) and my boyfriend ordered the Crispy Striped Bass ($38).  My steak was dry... even the center was dry... perfect shade of pink, but dry.  The striped bass was crispy alright, but rich in salt.  Very salty.  Personally, I like salty foods, but anyone can pan fry a striped bass for less that what Beso charges.

We also had the Asparagus ($10) and Mac & Cheese ($9) for our sides.  I enjoyed the aspagarus as it was sauteed in garlic.  The mac & cheese was just ok... and me being a self-proclaimed mac & cheese connoisseur, I was disappointed.  It was creamy and rich but it was lacking flavor.  Just bland and soft... nothing more than cheese & pasta.

I was extremely disappointed with my experience here and will most likely not be returning.  I think I'll stick to restaurants owned by well-known chefs than well-known actors/actresses.",ALRot_rgv3j0Y_hbuAa5yw,3,0,1,3HKVJQjBDAQzvCh3S7I1XQ

The lamb was magnificent, you can tell that it's Australian lamb, but still delicious nonetheless!

For dessert, we got the plantains con creme and a few drinks to relax at the lounge. Delicious! I loved the dessert! Very different!

Beso is the reincarnation of the Longoria owned Beso restaurant in Hollywood.

One is greeted when entering Beso with dancing flames, black features and red accentuation, and glossy glassy everything. If seated toward the rear of the restaurant the water feature of Aria Resort and Casino dances as an easy distraction while you dine.  A Vampire's delight.

We didn't have reservations and were walking around the Crystals shopping center, just taking a gander at each restaurant's menus.  Although Mastro's Ocean Club has received some glittering reviews; the menu didn't seem to speak to our palettes (or stomachs) on that particular evening.  We then settled on Beso (and it was the first place we walked past).  

They had us sit at the bar while our table was being readied, and so sipped on cocktails while we waited.  No more than 10 minutes later, we were brought to our table, which was pretty good given that it was Friday night and we didn't have any reservations.  

We started off with the chips/guac and the steamed mussels.  Both were perfectly fine.  I had the petit filet with sides of grilled shrimp and the jalapeno creamed corn.  My girlfriend had the ahi tuna adobo.  My only gripe is when I say ""medium"", I like it to be very pink, but not bloody.  I'd have to say that the filet was closer to ""medium well.""  I will say however that the jalapeno creamed corn is quite delicious.  

The final bill (including a couple of cocktails) ended up around $170 (tax/tip included).  Normally, with such a steep price, and what we got, we're looking at 3'ish stars.  HOWEVER......

The girlfriend and I had time to kill before our dinner reservations at Sage.  On our way to Aria, we stopped at Beso to take advantage of their happy hour and $8 cocktails.  We should've kept walking.  We got there about 15 minutes before their happy hour in the lounge ended.  There were only two bartenders on duty, without a bar back, who were responsible for the drinking needs of the patrons in both the virtually empty lounge and restaurant.  Although they weren't seemingly jammed with customers in the lounge or drink orders from servers in the restaurant, the bartenders looked busy but it may have been more of a product of an inefficiently laid out bar, their inexperience behind the bar, and/or lack of familiarity with the drink menu.  Regardless, we were sitting at the bar and neither bartender acknowledged our presence for a good ten minutes before coming over to take our order.  

I ordered the Modern Gimlet, Beso's take on the classic.  It was very disappointing.  The drink was poorly balanced as the Bombay Sapphire was overwhelmed by the cucumber pur√©e, while missing the advertised mint notes and any subtle hints of sweetness from the agave nectar.  I don't recall what its normal price was listed on the menu, but it certainly wasn't worth the $8 happy hour price.  The one good thing about to say about our Beso experience was that when our order was actually taken and rang up, it was after happy hour ended.  Our bartender, a friendly, attractive, Christina Hendricks-like blonde, thankfully rang up our drinks at the happy hour price.  I can't speak about the food at Beso, but I strongly recommend skipping the drinks and happy hour altogether.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,2,2,3U0BPDZ9RZd4MtDzSvcyLA

1. We got pushed to the ""lounge"" for 20 minutes before being seated despite mulitple open tables, just like another reviewer.  $14 cocktails...rediculous.

2. On the way to our table, the hostess blurts out ""Ooops!"" and pulls a 180 right into the glass of red wine I was holding...all over my white shirt.  ""I'm sorry...totally my fault"" she said and sat us down...while handing me the bar tab.  It's $96 for 5 vodka sodas and a glass of wine.  I'm about ready to punch someone.  ""Can I do anything for that"" she asks.  ""How about taking care of this bar tab"" I replied.  We never saw her again.

3.  The one positive experience was the waiter.  Very energetic and went out of his way to help clean my shirt, although it was a lost cause.

4.  Now the menu...the most overpriced menu I've ever seen.  I was at Mastro's 2 nights before and this joke of a restaurant was about 20% MORE expensive than a well respected steakhouse (which was great, by the way, and about a 90 second walk from Beso's entrance...hint, hint.)

5.  There were 7 of us and they were out of 3 people's first choice of entree.  Really?  At 10:00 on the Friday of a huge fight weekend (Mayweather vs Mosley) they ran out of not 1 but at least 3 entrees?  How is that possible?  Incompetence, as many here have noted.

6. We order, and we wait...and wait...and wait.  Appetizers come.  No comment, almost forgot about them when trying to remember the night's events.  Entrees arrive...take a look at the photo to see what a $36 pork chop looks like (if I can figure out how to do that on Yelp...I signed up for the sole purpose of warning people about this place).  And consistent with other reviews, it was liberally salted.

7.  By now I'm wondering when the manager is going to come over to appologize for the wine incident, but pretty certain he's not coming and would venture to guess that he didn't even know about it.

8.  We all pass on desert and get out of there in about 2 hours.

This place is a bar that serves food, and nothing more.  It is insanely expensive and the food really isn't any good.  The waiter was competent and a good guy, but the hostess ruining my shirt and doing nothing about it is unacceptable at a place this expensive.

A very good, contemporary steakhouse worthy of the Vegas Strip.  Comfortable for a guys steak nite; refined with healthy, pretty menu selections for the ladies.

The beef tartare is an excellent starter.  The earthiness of the truffle aioli provides a surprisingly different take on the classic.  The foie gras with candied apricots and vanilla gastrique is also a must try.  Vanilla with foie sounds disgusting but it really works, enhancing the full fat flavor of the foie.

Steaks are good but not great.  The restaurant does not make any grading claims on their menu, nor do the serves openly comment on the grade. They are well trimmed and perfectly cooked.  The bone in ribeye and the Kansas city strip are very flavorful but are oddly one dimensional when compared to steaks from the ""elite steakhouses"".  Good beef flavor but missing the ""umame"" profile of good aging.

The veal chop deserves special mention (don't hate me).  It is surprisingly flavorful tasting more like free range pork than bland veal.

Sides are simple and meant to be shared.  The simple wild mushrooms are a perfect match to any steak.

Beso's is a very nice place though a tad bit noisy when full. We like many reviewers here used an $79 Travelzoo voucher for a dinner supposedly worth $200. if you have one of these be prepared to be treated like a 2nd class customer. They seem to look down on you just because you are trying to get a deal on a dinner actually worth about price of voucher. Standard drinks from the bar are $14 each so keep that in mind before ordering.

Because of voucher, you can only chose select items on the menu. The crab cake appetizer was not bad. The sides mac and cheese and green beans we average at best. The main entre, 8oz steak filet was cooked perfectly and tasty. The champaign was not very good. I would say this steak dinner was not even close to worth $200 and barely worth the price of the $79 Travelzoo voucher. I have had better steaks and sides at The Outback for 1/4 the price. Also it was dinner for 2, but they automatically added $30 gratuity based on value of dinner, $198, so that was odd because service was not that good and food not worth the price.

I will complain to Travelzoo.

Pro's:
- nice place
- decent service
- good steak

Con's:
- $30 gratuity automatically added
- average food at best
- rude staff

5398614,2011-11-24,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"My husband and I decided to go here on our ""date night"".  I had no idea it was owned by Eva Longoria until I read these reviews.  Overall, service was great.  The hostess and waiter were very friendly.  For drinks, we both had a glass of Louis M Martini Cabernet.  $11 a glass is not bad for Vegas and it was delicious!  The bread was ok.  The appetizer (Crab Cakes with lobster) was really good but pricey at $16 for one crab cake. I would pay closer to $12.  We both ordered the rib eye....too salty.  I ordered it medium and got it medium rare.  At $42 for a lonely piece of meat, it should be cooked and seasoned properly.  For sides, the mac and cheese was bland.  Didn't want to waste the calories so we didn't finish it.  The mushrooms had too much garlic.  We had the ""chocolate kiss"" for desert which was to die for!  It was really hit or miss through each course of the meal.  I would say that it wasn't worth $200 and more worth $85 but it was our date night and I enjoyed the company. :)

However, I've paid far less for far better quality.  Sorry Eva!",Iai5P75Qb0_--tScUTDhiA,1,0,2,uxJcrp6nPcg4qleBUwW93Q
5429224,2011-08-22,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"My hubby and I decided to do a weekend in Vegas and we wanted to try a very nice restaurant and have a big night out.  Beso came recommended to us by a co-worker and it did not dissapoint!  
The hostess was very pleasant and she showed up to our table.  We had a wonderful booth seat where we had a view of the entire restaurant.  First off, I have to say... this is one of the most beautiful places I've ever eaten.  Very sexy, swanky and everything in between.  You look up and ceilings boast these gorgeous chandeliers!  
Our server was wonderful-- very polite, and attentive-- yet not overbearing. We started with some cocktails, which were yummy but slightly too sweet for our tastes.  The server was more than happy to serve them in separate glasses over ice to ""mellow"" them out. I had the Beso Beso salad to start.  The salad was lovely-- dressing was light yet flavorful.  A perfect complement to the petite filet I ordered.  My hubby decided to try the kansas city strip.  As an avid steak eater, he had never heard of that cut.  It was recommended by the server.  It was absolutely delicious!!  I actually preferred that to my filet which was cooked perfectly.  We ordered the lobster mac & cheese as our side and that was so delicious.  Perfectly creamy, and you could really taste the lobster without it tasting too ""seafoody.""  Overall-- even though we spent close to $200 between the bill and tip, we felt it was money well spent.  My only regret is that we didn't save room for dessert!",O5w8hszgXvZGIJf0ngg-3A,0,0,5,tJ8iwlXH_Gw-5CLGIqH8TA
5442247,2010-04-08,1,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"You know, for it being such an upscale restaurant, I expected way better service and food. I'm really disappointed in myself for not reading these reviews before we decided to go, as it would have saved us a lot of money. 

First off, I don't understand why we are asked to wait fifteen minutes when there are plenty tables that are visibly open for seating. After a half hour passed (mind you, we were the only party waiting), we had to walk back up to the host counter to bring it to their attention that we were still waiting to be seated... apparently the had forgotten about us. The best part? The host was visibly on his cell phone in front of customers-- how is this professional at all? Does he not realize that he is the first person that potential customers see? 

For starters, we ordered the guacamole as the appetizer, which was kept simple and nice, although I don't think I would pay $10 for it again. Their tortilla soup was also a little too brothy for me. For being a type of restaurant with a little mexican/latino ""flavor"", you would think that a dish like this would taste a little more authentic. I really hoped the food would be all it was priced to be, but $42 for a fillet mignon A LA CARTE? Oh, and lets not forget the $13 truffle mashed potatoes that tasted like they came fresh out of a box. Is it sad to say that I've had better mashed potatoes at a cheap dive bar? Come on! 

Its pretty obvious that the restaurant cares more for the presentation of the food rather than the quality. I have had way better food and service for a fraction of what we paid at this restaurant, unfortunately.",xKsH5WzQWE4RL_qJTibNuw,1,0,2,93ViaOxG0HM3eDLUxaPwVw
5477514,2010-04-21,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"I feel so bad for this place. They try to imitate Mastros Menu...  I wish I could it read the reviews before I went there, it was the worst night of my live, it cost me 3 hours in the toilet... 

I stayed at the Aria so I decided to go make reservations, the place have a fire alarm that went off for about 20 mins, people were complaining but hey they really didn't care about it...  a couple in front of us left. People were angry... 

My appetizer was that nasty lobster bisque, I found a long piece of hair... Then my petit filet, I wanted it well done but they gave it to me bloody, the cream of spinach had a weird taste... Then I felt sick I asked for the restroom and they didn't have one inside so you have to go all the way out inside City Center Crystals...

I decide to get back to the hotel and everything literally came out of me...  The food definitely was bad.  Don't waste your money at Beso in Vegas  and dont take a chance on your health... Very sad!!!",Ou8GC6gsGnKOQ9QJil8RJg,3,0,1,o2MM02tnNXJpHJazZD-wBg
5496407,2011-02-16,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"I visited Beso a couple of weeks ago for my 12th 21st birthday and I can honestly say that it was one of the best meals I've had ever! One waiter almost ruined my experience but another server went above and beyond to remedy the situation so I it evened things out in the end.

My hubby and I had a 10:30 p.m. reservation since we were going to go to Eve afterwards. We were seated at the rear of the restaurant, which was nice, next to the large windows. Our initial server was this older gentleman (I think he was a head waiter of some sorts and his name started with a ""C"") who took our drink order. Twenty minutes later, no drinks...Our waiter was too busy kissing actress Regina King's a$$, who also happened to be celebrating her birthday at the table right next to ours. I finally caught his attention to remind him about our drinks and he responded condescendingly that our drinks were on our way. A younger waiter brought us our drinks, apologized for the wait and took over for the rest of the night. He was fantastic! I was ready to give him a huge tip after our meal but was disappointed when the receipt listed the older snotty waiter as our server.

Now to the food...We started with the Ceviche, which tasted like any ol' ceviche. It was good, but nothing to write home about. Hubby had the braised short rib. The meat was pull-apart soft and delicious. I had the Seared tuna adobo, which was AMAZING. Loved the crab on the side. We also ordered the mac n cheese with truffle oil. It was delish and was a larger portion than what you would get at Todd English Pub. I would order this again in a heartbeat! At the end of our meal, the nice waiter brought me a complementary birthday dessert and personally walked us up to Eve. Dinner for ran us about 250+ without tip. It was worth it.

I agree with other reviewers, the bad reviews are from those who get comp meals. These people get seated at the front at the low tables. Simply put, you get what you pay for.",SZVBKjtG-x0Rmb0TmkHCLw,1,0,4,nSSZg0VxLPgwQpPIpivIAA
5499389,2010-01-18,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,Not a big fan of the Hollywood location but the Vegas location has much better food and the service is excellent.  The crowd is cheesy but hey this is Vegas guys! I had the Sea Bass which was perfect. The pretzel bread was to die for.  The short ribs were a bit salty but they changed it and it was just fine. Prices are high but it's a pretty restaurant in the new Aria so I would give it a shot for sure.,0KkUoWLpwevbiV7SkjBY2g,0,0,4,mU1zkHKZ7irg_BsujZvFpQ

""Luxuriously Hip"" as was mentioned earlier is the perfect way to describe it - beautiful down to every last detail.  Shared the lobster macaroni and cheese (decadent!) and LOVED the Sangria (Seriously, the best I've ever had).  Also tried the ""Raspberry Beso"" (Belvedere Black Raspberry, Briottet Cassis, Fresh Raspberries, Lemon, Red Bull Float), which was good too.

I went into this restaurant a little skeptical (desperate housewife star=good restaurant ??), but left extremely impressed.  Maybe we just got lucky, but everything we had, including our service was topnotch and excellent.  It's not cheap, but if your going to spurge, this is a great spot.  My wife had the regular fillet ($?) and I had the bone-in fillet ($50) and both were perfectly cooked to melt in your mouth.  I highly recommend the mushroom and truffle macaroni and cheese.  It's strange giving such a great review when so many people have not had a good experience, but our one experience here was awesome.

Tax and gratuity is based on regular price of $198.  This restaurant needs to make sure there's food available.  They basically had only three entrees to choose from--8 oz filet, 12 oz filet, ribeye, or the salmon.  Ordered the petite filet and definitely nothing special.  The only dessert they had available was the churros.  

Finally, service was nothing special.  Place was very pretty and nice though.",4SlrJEzRbxkRFJGIObUuTQ,2,0,2,2osqDYFa-RjIhZ13xRIFpA
5700958,2012-07-30,0,hXY9Yq0nOLgHsWLbjam--A,"This review is for the bar/ lounge area. My husband and I were walking around the City Center area and found Beso.  There was a sign out front that included my favorite words ""happy hour"" from 9- close. As usual, thirst led me in and wow, what a beautiful place! It was very romantic with couches and pillows, and the beautiful chandelier near the bar. We tucked ourselves in the corner and was immediately greeted by a friendly bartender (who I later found out was from Hawaii, as am I, - that is the reason for the friendliness!!!) 
My husband scanned the drink menu and saw that there were a lot of ""girl drinks"" - he couldn't see himself ordering the ""Pink Kiss"" and our bartender enticed him with the prickly pear ( I could be making the name up, but it has the word pear in it).  I got the gimlet which was YUM! 
We ordered the guacamole, the ceviche, steak skewers. We liked the ceviche the best and ordered another round. Small bit size tortillas (the size of your thumb) with shrimp ceviche, and lots of lime. Oh so good!! 

The napkins have a kiss  (Eva's kiss?) on it. Upstairs is Eve Lounge but the manager told me it has been closed for the last 10 months.",VS2UhdMT4zFx4c_wUClDzg,1,0,4,QKkjkczBdQfDavMvH5-vXA
