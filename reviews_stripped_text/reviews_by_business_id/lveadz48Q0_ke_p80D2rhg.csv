Next time they make you wait, you should ask to check inside the restaurant and see if how many empty tables there are.  I should've turned and gone to the coffee house or the buffet but I trusted the yelp reviews for some reason and made a mistake of staying here for food.
Mediocre food at best. Tortillas that came with fajita were hard to chew and too think.  Drinks were bland.  Chips were not crisp.  Pork stew was so salty.  Steak Fajita was a-okay.  I was not so picky because I was extremely hungry and about to to pass out.  But the worst thing was the wait. Don't eat here.

My hubs had raved about eating here on another trip, so naturally I insisted on checking it out for myself. 

We started off with nice big drinks: a top-shelf or whatever margarita for himself, and the blackberry/merlot sangria for me (bar was unfortunately out of my first choice of peach/chardonnay). The the house chips and salsa showed up, a large bowl of warm chips with three distinct dips, a green and a red (both smooth), and a chunky pico. For an appetizer we shared the masa quesadilla, two corny and cheesy half-moons drizzled with crema and cojita. I vacillated between chicken tinga tacos and the short rib enchilada, but went with the beef dish and was glad I did. The sauce was tangy and smoky, the corn tortilla roll-ups had a nice crispiness around the edges, and the short rib was tender and flavorful. Hubby had the pork posole dish, and he said it was excellent. 

The service was good, wavering a little only at the end (wait for check), but by then it was after 11 so I can understand somewhat. Also, my meat and salsa coma put me in a benevolent mood.",uqjxQw_09k47YtdWEeUQlg,1,0,5,dxwCcnzfsEh_5dxy_Dkj1A

Then a couple of nights later we came back for dinner.  No room in dining room so we ate hunched over the low table in the bar.  This did allow us to watch the rodeo on TV so that was cool.  Had the guac which was yummy and came with 3 delish salsas.  Sis had the seafood enchiladas and I had the biggest chile relleno I've ever seen - stuffed with chopped grilled veggies and cheese.  MMMMMM  again.  Lovely sauces on both dishes.    No booze this night as we were recovering from prior evening.  But the food was great and I would definitely come here again.

Knowing how Vegas tends to be on the more spendy side (as opposed to Lincoln, NE), we were fully prepared to pay over and above the Groupon value.

We didn't have a reservation, but we didn't have to wait at all - they seated us immediately.  Another thing we weren't expecting!  But as I've said in other review, Vegas seemed to be a bit slow the week we were there.

Very good - I preferred the green salsa but they all were good.  And I don't know what it is about Mexican restaurants, but entrees always come out super fast!

That sucker had some kick to it.  The rice was a nice short grain, cooked so it had just a bit of bite to it.  So, many restaurants overcook their Spanish rice.  

I found the prices for the drinks a little on the high side, until I tasted mine.  I always say, quality costs.  My margarita with hand muddled fruit, and my wife's mojito were top notch.

Kinda not fair, I know, but I live near some of the best, cheapest Mexican food on the planet, so they're starting at a bit of a disadvantage.

And tho I wish I was a tequila drinker, I'm not. Not only do they have a nice selection of tequilas, but apparently everyone who orders a sampler gets a fancy girl sent to their table. And when I say fancy girl, you know what I mean, right? Well, it is Vegas. But not since that time in college (with the falling down and tree climbing) has tequila tasted good to me. And believe me, I've tried (there was the subsequent time with the plastic trash can and stark nudity...not a good thing).

So, no tequila for me. Sy got the blackberry margarita, which was good, except for the tequila (she claims it was all good), and I got a mango mojito, which was one of the best I've ever had. We were also visiting Sy's folks, so no heavy boozing for me (no guitar shaped drink on the strip--waaah!). It's safe to assume that I was missing out on the drinks.

Miz Sy got a very tasty veggie enchilada number. It was good, with an interesting mix of veggies. (I think it needed a little carnitas or something, but she disagreed.) I decided to try something new (i.e. not the carnitas or flank steak), and got the seafood chile rellenos and the corn soup. Both were very good, except they needed a little carnitas or flank steak. 

So definitely come here, spend some money before you lose it in the casino (did I mention that it's not cheap? it's not. for our non-drinkie relatively smallish meal, we ended up spending more than $60).

The waitress made many suggestions, one of the bussers who brought out food and drink refills was kind enough to push a second table together for us to fit all of our plates more comfortably. I would highly recommend the organic margarita which is extremely smooth, slightly sweet and amazingly delicious. The boy said it was the best margarita he had ever had. We both got the muddled margaritas (blackberry and rasberry) which were both incredible also.  We got the calamari as an appetizer which was wonderful. The calamari was fried perfectly and wasn't too greasy and were perfectly crunchy. We also go the queso fundito because of all of the reviews we read on here about it, but found it to be unimpressive. Just a big greasy glob of cheese served with tortillas, not quite sure what the appeal is for it. Our main courses were out of this world! We got the skirt steak with the jumbo shrimp that was on special (24 dollars). The steak was smooth and buttery, cooked to perfection. The shrimp were HUGE and rubbed an an amazing cajun rub, just delightful! We also got the lobster which was delicious. Sweet, succulent chunks of lobster served with guac, tortillas, onions, salsa, and everything to make lobster fajitas. The menu says market price, the cost actually ended up being 65 dollars.

So we ordered muddled margaritas - I guess a mix between blended and margarita on the rocks.  The fruit (raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, etc) is smashed and added to a margarita on the rocks.  For the blackberry one, it resulted in a smushy string of clumpy blackberries about the size of a golf ball at the bottom of the drink. It tasted so good, but the clump really prevented any drinking from going on.  By the time I moved on to the strawberry muddled margarita either the clumps were gone, or I was too drunk to care.

I love Tequila so while I was in Vegas I Google'd ""Vegas Tequila Bar's"" thinking there has to be at least one.  As it turns out there are a few and one happened to be a highly Yelp rated restaurant as well so off we go...

Being a SoCal local my entire life I've undoubtedly experienced all types of Mexican food from all the various hole in the wall ""erto's"" that are commonplace throughout SoCal and from a wide range of $ - $$$$ restaurants.

I do not exaggerate - so when I say they serve up THE BEST Mexican food I've ever had, it's no joke.  If you're in Vegas and looking for a Tequila bar and craving Mexican food, YOU MUST splurge at this place.

Their Tequila Goddess was not there on the evening I attended so I was somewhat bummed but our server was fairly knowledgeable on the subject so she was able to direct me towards a great margarita.  I won't go in to details because I can't remember them - it was organic and smoothhhh :)

We started with the Crunchy Corn Masa Cakes which wasn't my first choice but, Oh Em Gee, once I bit in to one I savored every bite thereafter.  We also ordered guacamole to go with the complimentary chips and three different salsa's.  I met up with my mom and her husband at this restaurant and her husband is one of the most ""selective"" (picky) eaters, especially Mexican food for reasons that I won't go in to right now.  He was so impressed he was going to tell his friends that go to Vegas often.

I had the ""surf and turf"" special they had at the time which consisted of shrimp and steak.  There were four king shrimp and a big cut of steak.  I can't say enough about how tasteful everything was.  My mom and her hubby shared the ""Pork Carnitas"" and I throw that out in quotes because, well, Pork means Carnitas en Español.  So we had a fun time with our server and the cooks - at first we requested Chicken Carnitas and our server honestly said she would see if the cook would make it up for us.  When she came back from the kitchen she stated in all seriousness that the cook had said it would take about 6 hours but they could muster something up and we could come back later to get it.  Everyone had a good laugh over this and of course we respectfully declined the offer.  

All in all, everything was spiced just perfectly, large portions, excellent choice of tequilas and all of it melted in our mouths.  Even the most discerning taste buds in our party enjoyed and recommended it!  I don't know what reviewer Lina K was smoking, or wasn't for that matter, however, she appears to be alone in her experience and maybe too accustomed to El Torito's mediocrity.  If I can provide a tip when eating at a place like this, venture towards the servers recommendations, specials or whatever is on the menu that looks appealing other than the usual.  I know when I go with the norm, I'm partial to comparing it to whatever I've had elsewhere and I'm not open to a new take on an established dish.  That said, all of Mexico's regions have slightly different ways of making the same thing - keep an open mind.

First off, let me start by stating that we were staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel and to get to the restaurant which is in the Treasure Island hotel took an hour to get to. That put us into ultra hunger mode when we finally got there. We read some ot the other reviews and were a little aprehensive about going, but since I had the groupon I was going anyways. We were seated right away, the lighting is very romantic and the decor is gorgeous. The waiter came over very quickly and brought us chips and salsa I ordered the guacamole, carne asada tacos and my fiance ordered the shredded barbacoa enchiladas. After I ordered I told them I had a groupon, all of a sudden their quick and efficientness turned into a slow crawl. Our waiter brought over our guacamole and let me tell you that is really good! I would go there again for chips, salsa, and guacamole, the rest of the food wasn't too good. My carne asada tacos looked like they were cooked in a pan with oil and was chopped up into small bites, nothing like what is pictured! not to mention there was fat still on the meat. The oil was dripping out of the tacos and there was no seasoning to the meat. The beans tasted like they were from a can, the rice was okay and as for my fiance his enchiladas wasn't barbacoa it was a shredded beef, barbacoa is PORK! He wasn't too happy with his food either, you should also keep in mind that my fiance is Hispanic and we eat authentic Mexican food at least once a week, and even I know how to make real refried beans so we are extremely harsh critics when it comes to mexican food. 

We wouldn't eat this place again, such a shame cause we want to try new places out when we go to Vegas. I love the fact that I used a groupon with this place, had we gone without one I would have been very upset. If you have ever had good mexican food before, avoid this place as you will be very disappointed, if you are from a place that never serves mexican food then you will probably like it.",1JlkSOKrevjkjtgs6DOYuw,0,0,2,utgVY9VObtf2KYOtO0cmAw

-The cocktail named Harmony. Has ginger liqueur and I forget what else, but it was delightful. Not very sweet, no overwhelming alcohol flavor, just a perfect cocktail.

-Guacamole. I was heavily craving guac and voila, there are 2 choices on the menu. We opted for the latter option, with pumpkin seeds and chipotle adobo or something like that. I thought the pumpkin seeds added an interesting, smoky flavor and a cool complementary texture to the all-too-familiar guac experience. As I was starving, I carefully cleaned out the bowl. NO GUAC LEFT BEHIND.

Other items were less noteworthy. 

Do not get the chorizo-cheese item. It is strange. We had a hard time pulling apart the lump of cheese that came in a bowl with sparse bits of chorizo lodged within. Then you have to put the cheese on tortillas. It's just complicated, greasy, and heavy. 

The masa cakes were interesting. There are 3 different ones. My favorite was the chicken, but that might be because that was the one I had first. Maybe it was just diminishing marginal utility.

It didn't start that way though.... We ordered the peach margarita, which took about 10 minutes to arrive. The waiter didn't come to take our order until after the drinks arrived. But, we didn't like the drinks. They were frozen (didn't say so on the menu) and they tasted like a fruit smoothie, not a margarita. The waiter was nice about taking them back and we ordered the raspberry margaritas instead. Those took about 10 minutes to arrive also and the waiter STILL didn't come by to take our order.

We loved the raspberry margaritas...could taste the tequila and the raspberry flavor was very intense.  I ordered the achiote salmon and my husband ordered the tacos al pastor.  The chips and salsa were pretty good. We both liked the tomatillo salsa best.

We like strong drinks, so we ordered a shot of Cazadores for each. It was a HUGE shot, but it was also $12. That was the kick the drink needed.

Our food arrived and I was disappointed with my salmon. The tomatillo-mango salsa was cold on top of the salmon and had a lot of raw onions in it, which are not my favorite. Also, the salmon was too well done for my taste. I wasn't going to send it back, but the manager asked me how it was and I hesitated and after our conversation, he insisted on making me a new one...medium this time. The manager told us he was new, so he was probably a little over-eager to please, which was fine with us. He also gave us 1 shot of tequila on the house, which was really nice.

My husband really liked his tacos. The pork was super tender and flavorful. 

My new salmon came shortly and it must have been missing the chile morita sauce last time because this new salmon was AMAZING. That sauce was spicy, tangy and had a lot of depth. On top of the new, tender medium salmon, we both dove in and finished the whole thing. The corn tamale it came with was a little too sweet for dinner. The charro beans were good.

The sent us dessert on the house and we picked the recommended crepes, which were just okay. The homemade vanilla bean ice cream was pretty darn good.

I was pretty surprised that I would even want to eat at a $$ possibly $$$ Mexican restaurant since you can get $ burritos and tacos that are beyond authentic here in the Bay Area. 

I made reservations for 8 at 7:30; arrived late and were still promptly seated on a busy Friday night at prime dinner hour. The service was attentive and cordial, the food was delicious (hello Chicken and Seafood enchiladas, pork tacos and chicken fajitas!) and the price was reasonable compared to the normal Vegas tax that you would pay for premium food around here. 

Their margaritas were also especially notable, the fruit muddle is good but the MOJITO is just out of this world! ... and I don't even like mojitos! 

Overall, $35/person for entree, one appetizer (shared amongst 8) and a drink. Not too bad for a nice place in Vegas that has a nice vibe.

WARNING: don't order the guac, you'll regret it for $9 with what little they give you and how it's just okay.

WHY: Try some uniquely crafted Mexican food!

WHAT: Firstly, the place was absolutely gorgeous! From the dimmed setting, to the chill atmosphere, it gave off a great vibe.

My friend and I decided we try this place out because he is a fairly picky eater, but isn't picky when it comes to nachos! When we entered the restaurant though, we were directed all the way to this spot in the corner. It was literally in the corner, you can probably fit a full-sized square table right next to where we were. That right there made us feel like outcasts!

While we were seated, we waited for our menus and realized the table wasn't ""cleaned"". A couple minutes later, the server realized we were there, saw the dirty table, and went to grab a cloth to clean it with.  We then made our orders.

One of the servers came to give us water, and he noticed my glass was dirty as well, so he gave me a new one. Thank goodness! I love me some water, and I don't want any dirtiness in my water! X)

I tried the Isla Sliders, which included a trio of shredded pork, beef barbacoa, and chipotle chicken sliders. They were all good, but I did notice they were dryer than the usual slider.

My friend tried the Isla Nachos. On a positive not, he loved them (Although they gave us nachos with three types of salsa after we ordered, LOL). I got to try them as well, and the nachos are the way to go!

Now... maybe I'm being unreasonable, but usually when I go to Mexican restaurants I expect the chips and salsa to be free. Since our waiter said ""chips and guacamole"" I figured they do guac here instead of salsa... and even if they DID charge for it, I figure they would have at least told us the price before we agreed since we didn't even open our menus yet.

Well they brought out a TINY plate of guac,, enough for 1 or 2 people to eat as an appetizer. It was really good, but to my dismay, when our check came I realized they charged us $10 for it. $10 for a tiny plate of guac is ridiculous.

Unfortunately, the dining experience didn't live up to our expectations. The food was very pedestrian and unremarkable.

Chips and salsa were OK - neither amazing or terrible. They came on a fancy elevated stand which made things a bit messy.

I ordered some carne asada tacos which were pretty much just meat in tortilla without any other trappings. They didn't taste bad, but aren't something I would ever seek out again.

We shared queso fundido which was basically just melted cheese in a bowl. Yes, I know that's what it's supposed to be, but surely it could be dressed up in some way into something you couldn't prepare in 45 seconds in your own microwave?

The restaurant was decently pretty, but we found the furniture a little odd. Chairs were very high so we constantly felt like we either had to put our palms down on the table or slouch right over. Not very comfortable.

They were weird looking and wasn't that good! I can't really explain it, i wish i woulda taken a picture. it kind reminded me of a hot pocket with supposely chicken inside. I didn't taste ne chicken and it had this sauce on top of it that tasted funny. I was VERY disappointed! My friend who had the tacos said they were bland and she wasn't impressed either! 

I was so sad because all I wnted was like a regular ass quesdilla to hold me over for the night. Maybe if I woulda gotten one of the dinners of the enchildas or something I'd be happier. And there was NO tequila godness!

They try to create a cool atmosphere with the comfortable lounge overlooking the casino, chic/modern furnishings, and open kitchen. But the entry to the dining room from the lounge seems awkward and narrow -- like you're going in a back way. The coolness factor dipped way down when I saw the clown in front of me grab a handful of toothpicks from the hostess stand as he was walking back to his table. He tried to stuff them in his pocket but only half of them made it. The other half ended up on the floor. One of the hostesses tried to move them aside with her foot, but didn't have much luck as she was trying to balance on one foot. She walked away after her unsuccessful attempt. Toothpicks: 1, hostess: 0.

They try to lure new customers with Groupons. They had some available last year, and again this year. They're successful on this point. I got one and some friends got one. 

They try to bring a new spin to Mexican food, but I didn't feel like it was anything I haven't seen before. Isla is one of Richard Sandoval's restaurants. If you've been to NY, DC, or Denver you might be familiar with some of his other spots (Zengo, La Sandia, La Biblioteca, etc.). The food at Isla may not be revolutionary, but they use better ingredients than your typical Mexican restaurant.

The guacamole was tasty and filled with chunks of fresh avocado, tomatoes and onions.

The ceviche was a delicious stack of rock shrimp, cilantro, and tomatoes, but was a little too hot for my tastes.

The filet fajitas were a large mix of tender beef, peppers, onions, and mushrooms with a gooey pile of cheese on top. 

The beef barbacoa enchiladas were 3 tightly wrapped tortillas stuffed with a mild mix of chipotle sauce and delicious beef, topped with a red and green sauce and sour cream. I really liked how they didn't over-sauce the dish. I hate it when my food is drowning in sauce.

Cocktails were excellent. Both their primo margarita and mojiito were some of the best ones I've had in a while.

The service wasn't bad either. After telling the guy we had Groupons, I expected to be ignored all night. But he checked up with us a few times to make sure the food was good. Although he could have stopped by more often to offer us more cocktails. When he brought the check he forgot to subtract the Groupons, so we had to bring that to his attention.

Prices aren't outrageous, at least for the Strip. Sure the Groupons helped. After tax and tip each one of us spent less than $40 per person.

We decided to just forfeit the groupon and order from the happy hour despite the fact that the groupon did not specifically say it couldnt be used on happy hour. As we sat we saw a couple other disgruntled customers over the groupon/happy hour issue, one of which ordered $50 worth of food and drinks specifically bc she had the group on. She harrassed and literally yelled at the manager until she got compensated. I should have but with the super slow service we were just ready to get out of there and not hear screaming customers anymore. For 2 margaritas and nachos to take an hour from ordering to getting the receipt was just absurd and annoying. Overall the service was super slow, and our margaritas tasted like the cheap Jose mix.

While waiting for a table we got a top quality Cazadores Reposadas (sp?) tequila on the rocks. It was really strong, and really high-quality. In fact - i've never tasted a tequila like it. Other than Chili's presidente margarita I've never had a higher quality one.

For appetizor we got the Seafood Maya Relleno - a melted cheese and seafood dish which had real ceviche, rock shrimp, and amazing scallops with some sort of cheddary, spicy cheese on top melted to perfection. 5/5 delicious!!

For the entrees I ordered the grilled adobo marinated mango salmon over pollento. The salmon was so tender and juicy it melted in my mouth. I was eating tiny little chunks just to savor it all. The pollenta and the sauce it came with was amazing as well 5/5.

My friend got the chicken enchiladas (I tried to tell her to try something unique like my dish [a top entree], but she insisted on her fav enchiladas, and they were very good - though just enchiladas 4/5. I wish she had gotten something else off the entree menu so that I could try some ha.

For dessert we shared one of the better flans I've ever tasted. The caramel glaze and design of it were extraordinary. 5/5 Flan!

Someone decided it would be cool looking to have a metal frame that holds chips on the bottom and 3 bowls on the top for the salsas.  They are fixed--they don't move lazy Susan style.  It makes it a bit challenging to reach up into one of the small bowls to retrieve some red salsa (no heat), tomatillo salsa, or pico.  If my wife had been with me, those little bowls would have been removed and placed on the table for easier dipping.  But, it does look different.

I ordered the carnitas dish.  While another reviewer noted the saltiness of the dishes, I looked for salt and pepper on my table.  There is absolutely NONE!  I guess you have to ask for it.  There was also NO Cholula nor Tapatio on any table.  By the time I got my server to stop long enough, I was 2/3 of the way through my meal.  Is this really a Tex-Mex place?  My carnitas were OK but nothing that I can't get in any number of places around town for a lot less.  The redeeming part of the meal was dessert.  The crèpes were quite good and the ice cream in the sweetened tortilla bowl was very good and a great ending to a lackluster meal.

We were initially served by a waitress who was a little cool, and business like. Helpful, but not super great. She went on break or something, and out of the back came Linda (I think that was her name, I was pretty deep in my margarita at that point). 

I believe that Linda is the same server some people call ""too attentive"" and ""almost creepy"" but she was amazing. We ordered a tequila flight, and she educated us on each tequila. She then asked what we liked and did not like, and brought over MORE free shots to sample. She also brought a higher end tequila she declared her favourite. She read our table so well, it was no surprise she seemed to love her job so much. 

Then, just as suddenly she was gone and the other cold server was back out. Would have stayed longer and ordered more flights had Linda stuck around. What happened? We'll never know. We paid the bill and got out.

Our server knew little about the menu and even less about serving. One fun thing though is they have a Tequilier (a Sommelier, but with an expertise in Tequila) She was superb and very well-educated.

I had the Smoked short ribs. Excellent and tender with a nice red chile sauce and smashed potatoes to go with them. A very tasty ""Mexican"" version of meat  and potatoes.

My Wife had the fish tacos. These came out on a long rectangular  plate. Breaded and deep fried Mahi mahi on corn tortillas. Very tasty.

I know this might sound ridiculous, but I actually enjoyed MEXICAN food on the Strip. AGAIN!

First we found El Segundo Sol. Of course not as authentic as some Mex I had while living in Los Angeles for 41 years, but for Vegas, not bad at all. (Their secret ""serrano salsa"", more a green paste, is a heat-lovers DREAM!)

Then we returned (the first time was when we were visitors to Vegas in the 90's) to Border Grill @ Mandalay Bay. HERE is the best Mex on the Strip, period. I give a lot of credit to Mike Minor. We've known the owners, the ""Two Hot Tamales"", since the 80's, and their places in LA are great, but he's added value to this location.

But NOW, a third find. Isla. At Treasure Island? I know, seems strange, but VERY good.

I say YES! to the classic margaritas (cheaper at happy hour), all 3 regular salsas, the ""only if you ask"" FLAMING habanero salsa, the weird (never seen this before) guacamole w/ pumpkin seeds on top, THOSE CARNITAS (enough to feed 4 people, wonderful), the beans (both the charro & refried were good), THE RICE (GOOD RICE! BELIEVE IT OR NOT!), and the thin corn tortillas that came with the carnitas.

Again, I'm on the Strip?

OK, the tortilla chips were not the best I've ever eaten, but perfectly acceptable. And the green chili burrito was good, but not the best. (Go to Carlito's Burritos if you want FANTASTIC green chili.)

The only bummer? The bar is separated from the restaurant by a wall of NOTHING. No glass, just some objects d'art and tequila bottles. So the restaurant did have some cigarette smoke issues. But what can you do, you're just off the casino floor.

Oh, and the waiter was great, too. Attentive, friendly. I'm telling you, I really am happy I moved to Vegas a year ago. The restaurant folks have all been quite great and provided great times. (EXCEPT FOR A FEW. See my negative yelps for those!)

So overall, if you're in the area, try this place. Hopefully this wasn't a fluke! (Judging by all the positive Yelps, I'm guessing it wasn't!)

PS I also eat at taco places off-strip that are $1+change a taco, family run, no ambiance, great food. I miss Oaxacan, but what can I do, this is Vegas!",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,2,1,4,L6O6XqDrh8BQtuPnM2YOSg

I ordered this Margarita that had muddled fruit in it. It tasted good but the chunks of fruit kept clogging the straw, easy fix, just drink from the glass!

My gf's diet is gluten free. They grilled the fish tacos which are usually battered. The waiter was friendly and made good suggestions about things she could have off the menu.

We got the food and it was honestly just meh. I ordered the beef barbacoa enchiladas. They were alright. The plates had the typical accompaniments, refried beans and rice. Meh...Nothing wowed me. at all.

When it came time for dessert. The waiter did something pretty lazy. Instead of walking around where are table was, he handed our desert menus across the booth from the hallway.

On my very first trip to Las Vegas, we landed in the ISLA bar area and somehow we were lucky enough to order the ISLA nachos-- lucky  because you never know if you have just ordered the wrong thing and dismissed a restaurant despite the fact that something marvelous was hiding on the menu. ISLA nachos are definitely that something marvelous. Meat-lovers be warned: There is no meat. However, there is delicious fresh guac, smoky bean and a tad spicy cheese sauce and some other magic mojo. If you do not get enough cheese sauce, just let them know, as sometimes the person in the kitchen is feeling a bit stingy with the sauce.

I almost always take people here for the nachos, and I understand it is hard for anything to live up to this praise, so I am not disappointed when sometimes people look at me a little weird.

I have also had the fish tacos. The fish is fried, but I enjoyed them. Still, I am not telling you to go to the restaurant and have a full meal because I am not qualified to give that advice. I never make it past the bar and the nachos.

Now for the food. I ordered the seared Ahi tuna salad. It looked and tasted like canned tuna smothered in chili powder and piled on a spinach salad. The flavors were all over the place, grapefruit slices that provided an unwanted punch after eating the bitter (fully cooked) tuna slices.

Well Gilley's was packed and it was clear finding a place to sit so you could eat wasn't in the cards- so we stumbled upon ISLA.  We were seated right away.  Service was wonderful.  We ordered our Margaritas and chips/salsa with a side of queso at $4- but it was YUMMY!  My husband had the ceviche for appetizer and I had the corn soup- both were deilsh!!  Then for our entrees,  I ordered the skirt steak volcano and my husband ordered the grilled salmon.    The steak presentation was amazing- it looked like a volcano with layers of steak, tomatoes and onions. .  The meat was perfectly cooked and very lean.    My husband said that his Salmon was grilled perfectly  Earlier this week we had gone to a function held at a local restaurant and he said ""the best grilled salmon ever"" after that night and after ISLA- he said he couldn't believe that twice in one week at two separate places, he had the best grilled salmon he had ever had.

Warm, crunchy tortillas with three dipping sauces came out and made no need for an appetizer, although they had very tempting choices. My co-worker ordered the steak pyramid and it looked amazing on the menu. When it actually came out, my first impression was that it was smaller than I expected, but it did come with a side of rice and beans. I got a bite of the meat and ohhhhh la la, that's some tender ass meat! I don't know what they use to marinate it but damn it was yummy. 

I, on the other hand, ordered the pork sliders with fries (I am a french fry fiend!) There were 3 total and I got full after the 2nd one.

It takes a few minutes as she squeezes lime juice and talks about the liquor that is going into the drink - which is very expensive stuff.  The food is excellent and the service is quick.

When my family and I came in, we were greeted by the waiters and big servings of tortilla chips with salsa in a cute little decorative saucer-holder-thingamajig. The chips were decent -- they weren't stale, at least, although the salsa serving was kinda small and the salsa verde was pretty runny.

As for dishes, I ordered the masa corn cakes (less than $10). They were delicious, and the presentation was great! There were only three masa cakes, but by the time you're done chompin' on those chips, you're going to be glad you ordered a lighter meal! I think they were perfect in terms of servings, and they're good for sharing. My sisters liked it a lot, too. I can't really remember how the other dishes were like, but I did think the food in general was pretty decent.

Heck, I could probably make cilantro and limes the base of my food pyramid if needed. Suffice to say, I love Mexican food. Beau S. took me out for Mexican food here on 5/21/11 because, well, he always does nice things for me and he had a groupon to use up before he moves away this week (*massive tears.*) 

I don't eat at restaurants on the Strip because I think it's overpriced, especially in this economy. I'm just not comfortable with paying (or anybody paying actually) jacked up prices for food. I had no idea where Isla was nor did I know anything about it. I had no expectations going in, but I was a bit nervous when I saw the place once we got to TI. It's never a good sign when it's dinner time, on a Saturday, on The Strip, and the restaurant is empty. 

The restaurant is pretty, looks clean and as Clint B. said, is trying to be upscale. The waiters are attentive but the menu isn't very extensive. I had a hard time trying to figure out what I wanted. I was really uncomfortable with the prices, which made ordering for me difficult. I settled on the chicken mole even though I was cringing at the $19.50 price tag. Beau got barbacoa enchiladas. 

The chips and salsas are good. I liked the pico de gallo (of course) and the green salsa the best. I had a bite of  Beau's enchiladas and I really liked them, but I've never had barbacoa that I didn't like. My mole was good, but it's only the second time I had it (the first time I had it, my grandma made it and served it over turkey, so I don't think it's a fair comparison.) 

If I was pricing it, I'd say it wasn't worth more than $10 because the sauce covered up some slightly burnt parts on this 6 oz chicken breast. I mean, let's guesstimate the food cost percentage Isla is operating on: 
FCP= Portion Cost/Menu price. 
Let's be ultra generous and say it costs them $4 to make this portion of chicken mole/$19.50 = 20.5%. That's a hefty profit margin they're running.

The service was good, the food was decent and the prices were ridiculous, so I doubt I'll be back, but I enjoyed my dinner partner, so I enjoyed the experience here at Isla.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,1,3,RmzWF0FijT436Ma35wJRWA

Your customer service skills stink! We had a party of 12 come visit your restaurant. Our waiter was very nice, in the begining. We all ordered drinks, appetizers and were having a fiesta of sorts.  Our food comes and it was fabulous!!!  Top notch! I'm a mexican food conosour so I know a thing or three about the flavors. You hit them on the nose! Congrats!
The problem came when we recieved our check. We politley asked our server to split it for us...his response, ""you're in Vegas, no one splits checks."" This was NOT our first restaurant to go to in a group and yes, Mijo, other places DO split checks. So we asked to speak to a manager. This man who obviously hates his job came over to our table and tells us again that they will not split the check and that WE have to figure out what each indiviuals total is and then they can run our cards or cash or whatever. Hmmmm....really?!?! Isn't this kinda his job??? So we asked our server is he could at least group our individual purchases together since the reciept was HUGE and not in seat order...he told us that he threw away his notes from when he took the order....REALLY?!?!?!  Well this did not sit well with us at all. Fortunatly, one of the ladies we were with works for MGM which owns TI and she doesn't just work for them, she is an Executive...so she used her super powers to let this the manager who looked like he wanted to shoot himself more than we wanted to that she knew his boss and that she knew the rules and regulations and that yes, they can split our checks and make us happy.  Well whadya know! He skipped his unhappy butt right over got everything figured out in a jiffy.  By the time we got our original check and actually paid, it was an hour, AN HOUR!!!! We missed our show we were supposed to see and we wasted an hour arguing with a guy who could have done the right thing in the first place.
