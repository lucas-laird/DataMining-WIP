Expansive menu, friendly service and excellent prices here. I had the cheese enchiladas (my baseline for Mexican places) and they were a bit bland but good. The chips and salsa are BOMB. After a few bites of the enchiladas, I covered them in salsa and NOM NOM NOM. 

They have fountain Coke products,which is a huge plus in my book.

            When I pulled in to the parking lot of Serrano's Mexican Food I saw a few other businesses, but it was a pretty empty and quiet lot. I didn't smell anything approaching the restaurant; it actually looked like a little hidden. However, when I opened the door, I immediately smelled fresh tortilla chips.  As I walked in to the clean and organized restaurant, I felt at home. I was looking for good authentic Mexican food and I came to the right spot. They have many pictures and historical memories of Mexico. This Ma and Pa restaurant is operated on a daily basis by the whole family. You can tell by the customer service they provide, that they are proud of their accomplishment. 
Food Evaluation
 After exploring the menu for a little bit, I chose to try Camarones al Mojo de Ajo. This is a shrimp dish sautéed in a garlic butter sauce. This dish was beyond delicious, I was asked if I wanted it to be spicy, of course I said yes. Everything is cooked to order, they pay close attention to detail and will personalize your order as best as they can. When my dish came out, it was vibrant, immediately looked appetizing, and definitely smelled garlicky and spicy. As I went to taste it, the combination of the shrimp with the garlic was strong but not potent, it was just perfect. The texture was tender, cooked to the right consistency, and the rice and beans on the side balanced out the sauce of the shrimp. This dish was just simply amazing, they also offered tortillas on the side, and I caught myself dipping the tortilla in the sauce more than once. That is how good it was, I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant.

Like many Mexican restaurants,  we were quickly served complimentary chips and salsa after ordering, which is kind of like the cover of a book or a first impression. The salsa verde was tangy and slightly spicy, just how a green salsa should be in my opinion, but the red salsas were kind of watery and not great. My chile relleno was nicely charred and tasty but the rice and beans were pretty status quo. My companion was happy to be able to order menudo and thought it was good. The service was very good,  quick and attentive.

But it's SUPER clean, the food is fresh, the portions are generous and the service is friendly and helpful. We eat here a couple of times a month for dinner. I always get the steak ranchero. It's like Mexican pepper steak and it's a spicy comfort food. Served with tortillas, rice and beans, it will fill you up for only $8. If you got the same thing anywhere else it would be twice as much. 
The chips are fresh, thick and homemade. They aren't super salty, which I love. The salsa bar is always super clean and homemade. I love the jalapeños with carrots and onions and the garbanzo beans. My mom likes the cactus salad and cucumber salad. And I always get the hot salsa from the bar because the one they bring with the chips is pretty mild and I like some heat. Again, everything on the salsa bar is house made and delish!

Customer service was excellent.  We totally screwed up the order/pay/sit protocol.  Without missing a beat, the young man working the cash register, graciously became a waiter, just for us (we had explained this was our first time).  As a parting gesture, he was nice enough to pay for our drinks.

Tried shrimp scampi, shrimp ceviche, taco salad and fish tacos so far. Each dish was delicious! About to try steak rancheros. 
They do make everything to order and from scratch, so may take a little bit of time to make- be prepared. But totally worth it. Will be back for sure.",o5l9yf4SABwbOR6z3TBrVg,1,0,5,1wxCyeDJzzk17l0_a4vrig

3837768,2016-02-24,3,bgx6gYdktqEoQwBdo5lRbA,"So after our horrible escapade into the taco shoppe down the road from CSN, the fiancé and I decided that we needed something more refreshing. So we head into Serrano's, which would have been our first choice had they not been closed yesterday (Monday).  

We walk in, find a quaint little dining area made up of brick and culture, and IT'S CLEAN. The decor is everywhere, but it's not in your face, and that's great. The floors are decently clean and the tables are spotless. It's a late dinner at 7:00pm, and they have a steady flow of customers (mostly picking up and taking home). The music is low, but not so much that it's inaudible. I believe you go up and order, then take a seat and wait to be served (otherwise we totally did the whole dining thing wrong, lol). 

Vanessa helped us at the register, and she was wonderful. I mean WONDERFUL. She was patient, considerate, and incredibly professional.

The salsa bar was gorgeous and very decorative. They add a little twist on what you typically see in these styles of restaurant. The jalapeños and carrots were divine. The salsas were each distinct and delicious (the only one we did not try was the green). They bring you the traditional basket of chips, which were tasty and obviously homemade. A great filler while we waited for our food. 

I ordered the Albondigas Soup (I'm a sucker for home-made meatballs). She tells me immediately of the semi-long wait time for my soup. Fifteen minutes, no problem. I appreciate her letting me know. They had it out in less than ten. What a broth. Warm, flavorful, incredibly filling and just...fucking awesome. It's the only way I can describe it. The meatballs were the perfect consistency and size. The pairing with the broth, squash, carrots, onions, and parsley was wonderful. I added some Tapatio (I love everything spicy) and it was by far in my top ten soup list. 

The fiancé ordered a shredded beef chimichanga. The meat was so tender that it could melt in your mouth. The exterior was crispy and warm, and the surrounding beans and rice were, quite possibly, some of the best I've ever had. Sauce on top was flavorful, and the shredded cheese actually tasted fresh. 

Onto the flan. I loved it. Plain and simple. Next time I intend to order it without chocolate sauce, but, nonetheless, very rarely do I find great flan. Presentation was a little out there and excessive, but the taste was all there. 

The horchata was so smooth, milky, and wonderful. I asked Vanessa if it's made in house, and, to my absolute delight, it is. I damn near cried when my cup broke and some spilled out.

Don't let the name fool you, this isn't your average grab and go taqueria. Their dine-in meals are served on proper plates, not in styrofoam boxes, and are brought to you at your table. The free refills on the horchata were a welcome surprise. Take that, Roberto's!
Serrano's is a mom and pop establishment in it's 9th year, according to the friendly young man who served us. The place was impeccably clean and looked freshly painted, (including the restroom,) and the decor is fun with lots of personality.  The food isn't gourmet, but it's solid, freshly prepared, and not greasy and heavy like most taco shops. It tastes like a casual, home cooked meal. I had a small steak, a chile relleno, and a cheese enchilada. The chile had a bright fresh flavor, and the enchilada was tasty. The rice and beans weren't as out of this world as some of the reviews say, but definitely above average. They have a very nice salsa bar, but most of them were a bit watery and could have used a little more oomph. The charred red salsa was an exception! Yum!  (I'll be the first to admit that I'm spoiled by my roommate's fantastic Mexican home cooking, and my boyfriend's epic salsa, so the bar is set pretty high in my world. Haha!) We finished off our meal with an exceptionally good fried ice cream on the house. (Thanks, guys!) For food, I'd rate Serrano's at 4 stars. For the excellent service, friendliness, pride, and love these folks clearly put in to their establishment? A solid 5 and then some!

4237427,2017-05-28,1,bgx6gYdktqEoQwBdo5lRbA,"I am going to start with paying tribute to my friend Stefany's review some 3 years ago. This place has ""take out"", and I'm sure the owners appreciate this aspect of the business. However, to truly get your ""money's worth"", you and your friends need to dine in, and enjoy the good food fresh and hot, and experience the charm and ambiance of this establishment. 

This place is very authentic from the ""Mexican small town"" ambiance to the presentation of the food, to the friendly and personal service everyone receives from Jose and Elvia. The fact that employees of local favorite, Don Roberto's Taco Shop, sent me here with their assurance that this place was true, authentic Mexican Style food, was an endorcement of excellance. 

I was not disappointed. My only regret is that I gave them my ""standard test"" of a Tamale (which very few places serve in the Summer) a Chile Relleno, and the best Taco of the House. The food was hot, good, and did not disappoint.  I only wish I had indulged in a true Mexican dish, and not something I could probably find at the establishments that cater to the Millenial Gringo. 

It's not a place to take someone who does not appreciate Mexican Culture, or a person who judges you, by your choice of eateries by finding a trendy crowd. This is for the person that appreciates this food and values authenticity. 

Why didn't I give it a 5 Star Rating? I need to practice what I preach; Sample and evaluate the authentic cuisine you can't order at the Trendy and Stylish Mexican places, and compare it with what I ate with the Locals in Quintana Roo, Mexico.

I'm always around during breakfast time but occasionally they have live Mariachi playing during the night if you want to join in on some karaoke.
All food is freshly prepped, coming out steaming hot. The Machaca con Huevo is great if you're into loading up tortillas, but there's some type of seasoning they put in their Breakfast Burrito that makes this simple dish taste so damn good! Desserts are a must if you have the room for it, first timers for Deep Fried Ice Cream are more than welcome... actually I think I'll go get some right after I hit up LVAC this weekend.

My MIL and I tried this place on a random whim and it's quickly become one of our spots. 

She always gets enchiladas with green sauce vs the regular red enchilada. Its her go- to at Mexican spots, and they make it well here. I like to try different things though. I've had enchiladas as well (with shrimp or chicken for me) and like their green sauce too. I've gotten the carnitas if you like a meaty big chunk version of this. Ceviche tostada is piled high for the $3.50 with fish and shrimp and really citrusy, but get some hot sauce from the salsa bar and it's good (get it with mayo spread on the tostada). I think so far my favorite item is the birria. It took a while to find some place that makes this fork tender. It is super good. 

The salsa bar has 5 different sauces, carrot and chiles, this awesome pickled cabbage, white beans. The salsas lean a bit more spicy than the average place, which makes me happy! You get some chips when you sit down. Then prepare for food that someone would make you at home. Everything here is definitely homemade and not phoned in. 

They are super friendly here as well. 

Im a fan, I think I will go try to eat through the menu as my MIL has been asking for the enchiladas often.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,9,6,4,g6oaZx9zH13V1lWKRzbGzg

It is a hole in the wall with decent prices and good service, but the food was so BLAH! I may be biased having grown up with homemade Mexican food, but I find it very hard to make flavorless Mexican food, which this was. I had the menudo which was was neither good nor bad, until I got sick on it. My bf had a carne asada burrito which he said was ""ok."" We both agreed that the chips were not good at all; seriously, how many Mexican places make crappy chips? VERY few. The salsa bar was also quite sad.

Serrano's redeeming qualities are its good service, the fact that they make their food upon ordering, and its horchata. The blandness and fact that I got sick are enough to make me not eat there again though.",v8QVTSPCW1LBzE_j_jT7YQ,2,0,1,OOc8ixtUiLG-1aZ77scgCA

While it is pretty much necessary to have a car to get to this restaurant from the strip, it's worth the short drive if you don't want a gringo nacho platter like you find on the strip. This is a family-owned restaurant with a fresh-made salsa bar and entrees that taste like they come from Mexico. I had awesome fish tacos for lunch, and the flan for dessert was superb! The restaurant is by no means fancy, and is in fact a casual spot within a strip mall area.

The Carne Asada Fries were so good, not like your typical type with Carne Asada, cheese and enchilada sauce.  The taco salad was really good as well.  Hubby had the sausage Breakfast burrito smothered in enchilada sauce, very good portions.  There is a salsa bar with four different types of salsa as well marinated garbanzo beans and a so yummy concoction of cabbage, carrots and jalapeños.  Fountain drinks are self serve.  The young guy that helped us, can't remember his name, was super friendly and efficient.  He also told us the history of the restaurant.  It's not a super fancy place to eat so don't expect to be wined and dined but for more of a taqueria style restaurant we were very impressed.  We will definitely be back soon!

I got the shrimp quesadilla with tomatoes in it, and should have passed on the tomato as it made it really soggy, but it was LOADED with shrimp and the price was delightful! The cashier only charged me .50 for a small scoop of guac which was nice. My bff got the chicken fajita and loved them. This place does pretty quick pickup orders and I can see myself calling in for that quesadilla in the future. It was fantastic.
