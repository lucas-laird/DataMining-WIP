My husband and I ordered the garlic knots and a small deep dish and it was more than enough for the both of us!! Bread is so filling and yummy. I also ordered the ""all nighter"" blonde ale, very good!! They need to hire more valuable workers though. The bartender barely even glanced at us when we walked in and there were no clean tables to sit at. There was one gentleman working (I regret not asking his name) but you could tell he was hustling to serve.

We also had the sliders, wings,  fries and potato skins.  All of it was good. We meet 4 of the servers/bar tenders.  They were all nice and good company.

That said, they still take your order and deliver your food tableside.  It's quick, high-quality and reasonably priced for being in a downtown casino.  The 22oz drafts are $5.  My favorite brew is the Ramblin' Wreck which is a cross between a Smithwicks and a Guiness.  The large pizza is crisp, tastey, plenty for two people and starts  is about $16 for a cheese version.  This location doesn't have a happy hour.   They have lots of TVs so you can catch your favorite game.  The place is kind of small so you'll have difficulties with groups larger than about 6 people.

Probably just average brews, but their huge double-decker brewery flight and comparison to other local options, it is definitely worth a visit.

The double decker sampler tray comes with 9 samples:
*  Weizenheimer - regular Hef
*  Blueberry Hef - seasonal, different, but interesting flavor
*  All Nighter - light Ale tasty and easy drinking
*  Ramblin Reck Amber -yummy - my favorite
*  Hardway IPA - solid at 6.2% ABV

My wife randomly saw a brewery mentioned on Yelp while we were wandering around Fremont and given that we were in the early stages of a challenge to try 100 new beers while on our US holiday, we dropped all other plans and headed straight here.

Chicago Brewing Co is tucked away at the back of the casino floor and if we weren't looking for it we would have completely missed it. We headed up the stairs and grabbed a table overlooking the floor for a spot of people watching and upon seeing they had a beer flight we promptly ordered one each. At first we wanted to order our drinks at the bar, but the bartender told us he was finishing his shift now and would send someone over to our table. He then proceeded to stand around talking for five minutes and playing around with his phone behind the bar before someone came to take our drinks order. They were taken by a very friendly waitress however and once ordered, the drinks came out very quickly.

The flight is huge. 9 beers (well..8 and a non alcoholic, but nonetheless tasty Root Beer) on a double decker tray made me very happy and glad the the car was staying put in the parking garage for another day. Now, it was a couple of months and a lot of drinks ago when we ordered here so I'll just pop in how I rated each beer on Untappd, because I really can't remember much of them.

All Nighter: 3/5
Weizenheimer: 4/5
Ramblin Reck: 3/5
Blueberry Vanilla Wheat: 3/5
Hardway IPA: 4/5
Old Town Brown: 4/5
Black and Tan: 4/5
Black Widow Stout: 4/5

I like my beers dark, so they were either really good to get that many 4's at the end or I was just getting drunk. Either way they were tasty and definitely worth stopping in for a try. 

Oh, and hit the toilets before you get into the bar. There aren't any inside and you have to walk all the way back across the casino floor to get to the closest ones.",ukIal4PbxGRoZpScaKOFJg,3,0,4,SeV0GmeLX7CSWQWQjN-VSw

I understand this location is basically tiny restaurant tucked upstairs in one corner of The Four Queens. So not much you can do. Truth the food, micro brews, and the service is fabulous. Right on point and more important consistent with the Sahara location. Just walking into the The Four Queens if your not going Hugo Cellar is like why am I even this is old dump of hotel. So kind of kills the vibe for me. Once you get upstairs the place is so tiny, hell of low ceiling, and kind of feel trapped in box with lack of places to move around in general. The times I have come only because had visitors from out of town staying downtown. Now that downtown has evolved then more then just hotels. Bars, Restaurant, and Banger Brewery competition lot more tough. Chicago Brewery falls in the OK category. 

The beer is the same craft beer get at the other location. I really like all of them. The food just ordered appetizers order of garlic knots and mozzarella sticks. The garlic knots love at Chicago Brewery. The knots always hot, moist, nice golden brown crust, and the marinara sauce dip them in brings it all together. The mozzarella stick was ok.

2474023,2014-02-28,1,deL9fV4Jw3XhS0WqGRKgiA,"When you spend a large amount of time in the same area on a 5-day vacation, you inevitable find a spot or two that you become extremely comfortable with ... a place that becomes a home away from home. On my recent vacation in Vegas, one of those spots was the intimate and welcoming Chicago Brewing Company at the Four Queens. I visited them three times on my vacation, each time being served by Bob (the gentleman in Leila R's picture) I also ran into Bob once at the nearby Banger Brewing and had a great chat with him - it's always great when brewpubs employ people who have a true passion and knowledge for beer. Bob overheard me mention that I was running out of clothes due to my flight being delayed because of the nasty east coast weather, and when I went back for my final visit to Chicago Brewing the next day, Bob gave me an older 2XL t-shirt that they don't print anymore. (Thanks Bob!) Needless to say, the service here was outstanding.

Chicago Brewing's beer sampler is an outstanding deal - 9 different samples for $8.99. I enjoyed it so much, I got one each time that I went. They keep six year-around brews, plus root beer (which is included on the sampler) and typically have two seasonals. Unfortunately they only had one seasonal - an outstanding blueberry wheat brew - so the final beer was a different brew mix each time. It started with a traditional black and tan, the next was a mix of the Hefeweizen and IPA, and my last mix was 1/2 brown ale, 1/2 stout. All of their beers are great, but the blueberry wheat was my favorite. I also really liked their Hardway IPA - it had a nice hoppy flavor but not overpowering with hops. At 6.2%, it's like a ""Session IPA+"" The Black Widow Stout, an Irish Dry Stout, and the Weizenheimer Bavarian-style Hefeweizen also stood out for me. And their root beer is a great palette cleanser for the finish. 

My first visit was for the beer, but I was eyeing the food menu ... and the wonderful looking Chicago Deep Dish Pizza they were serving. So I made a second trip back specifically to get one of these bad boys. It's a personal 9"" deep dish with sausage and pepperoni. The dough was great, cooked perfectly through, and it wasn't overly saucy as some deep dish pizzas are. I'd definitely get this again. 

On my last visit, I had no intention of eating ... until I heard it was half-price appetizers for happy hour daily. One thing caught my eye - filet mignon sliders. Topped with mushrooms and onions, and served with a side of au jus, these are like little French Dip sliders of pure awesomeness. 

My expectations for Chicago Brewing Company were low to be honest. I guess it's the location inside the older (but charming) Four Queens and its old-school, dimly-lit bar vibe. But those expectations were blown away. This is one of my favorite places in Downtown Vegas, and I'll be coming back on my next trip to Las Vegas.",vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,3,4,5,EwnmGfBKaa5nKyCOmjdMKQ

The Food: the garlic chicken pizza was very flavorful and just the right size for yourself or for two if you shared it with a salad, which we did. The salad was just simple field greens with tomatoes and onions. It was just good enough.

Lower original gravity=less taste, and most places are mailing in their versions of different styles on the lower end of the ranges. The beers here are more true to style, with more taste. 
I'll admit that I'm spoiled living in the Pacific NW, so the brewpubs in LV wouldn't last long there, but are still a major step above BMC beers.
Chicago Brewing's amber is solid, their pale is solid, their IPA is good but not overpowering with bitterness. Had a great weizenbock seasonal here once too. Generally good beers.
The pub overlooks the 4 Queens casino, and has a cigar case. Smoking and non smoking areas since they expanded.
Very good service, very nice and friendly servers who take good care of you while there. 
The pizza is good, and the other food on the menu is better than average bar fare.

Our family has been coming here as part of our Thanksgiving tradition for over 10 years! This hidden gem is located in the 4 Queens hotel. It is located upstairs near the Golden Nugget side of the casino. They have a bar area with about 15 seats at the bar, and then about 5 high top round table that seat 4-8 people. They also have a cigar lounge with couches to sit on while smoking your stogie.

The chicken wings come in an order of 10. They have various sauces but we usually stick with the mild buffalo sauce. Very tasty!! The star of this place, in my opinion, is the deep dish pizza. It comes in a small personal pan, split into 4 pieces. Don't let the size fool you. This pizza is smothered in cheese, on top of a light, but doughy thick crust. The pizza also comes with sausage and pepperoni embedded into the cheese. I once ate the whole thing, and then slipped into a food coma! lol! My Fiancee and I split one pizza, and sometimes have one slice left over. 

This place is also part of a brewery. The serve their own craft beers ranging from a light pilsner, to an amber ale, an IPA, and a stout. I have had the pilsner and amber ale and thoroughly enjoy them.

We ordered the calamari for an appetizer which is served with marinara (mediocre) and garlic aioli (amazing - just the right amount of garlic flavor without being overwhelming). 

For the pizza, we skipped the Chicago style deep dish and went with a large thin crust meat lovers. Like I said before the pizza was average, not bad but not great either.

So this Chicago brewing is pretty small place. And they mostly have bar food! Service is pretty great! But it's pretty loud in here due to the place that is very confined and all the tables are pretty close together. 

We sat on the bar and played video poker, didn't really win anything but we also didn't get any comp for the drinks either.

We ate 2chicken wings because they really are not that good! The calamari was ok; it was a bit tough! And mozzarella cheese were also pretty tough! But those cowboys balls are the bomb!!!

Things seem aloof at first, with the self-seating and whatnot, but once you grab someone's attention, they're yours forever...  teehee.  An IPA, a root beer, garlic knots, buffalo wings (hot), and Brew-BQ pizza later, and we were in heaven.  Weeeell...  at least in heaven's foyer.  Even though we fell in love with the magical knots (GET THEM...  EVERYONE RECOMMENDING THIS IS SPOT ON), tang and heat of the wings (I'm no math teacher* or anything, but I'm preeetty sure they dumped on more than just 10 menu-stated wings on there), and the beverages (ROOT BEER = PERFECTION -- the IPA is pretty hoppy and leaves you a decent finish), we were kind of medium about the pizza.  The crust was super, and the pie itself was fresh outta the oven, but the toppings were somewhat lackluster.  Not enough bbq sauce, no seasoning on the chicken, etc.

Round 2!

Minus garlic knots (we still had leftovers in the room; might I add that they make PERFECT bedtime snacks at 7am when you return from EDC?), replace pizza with the Uptown Chicken Garlic Whatever (sorry, that's not the actual name).  And...  DIVINE INTERVENTION INDEED.  Perfectly grilled chicken, strips of sundried tomatoes, a yummy garlic presence, just the right touch of basil, all on that deliciously crispy crust.  LOVED IT!

Sat in the non-bar room after noticing someone smoking in the main room...it's amazing to me that smoking is still allowed in restaurants here in Vegas?  Blah.

There are TVs all around so it's a nice place to catch the game :)

Anyways we tried a small thin crust with pepperoni and jalapeno and the garlic knots and 2 hefeweisen's and the bill was around $26 without tip.  The garlic knots were a lot of food for $5.  The pizza is on the smaller side but decent.  The beers were average, nothing spectacular but not bad.

Mike our server from Maryland was very nice and quick to help us out.  When we sat down someone actually came out from the kitchen right away and asked if we wanted menus.  Maybe the service is bad when it's more busy but the other night it was great.

On 11/23/16 My family and I happened upon this location by accident as we were catching the Elvis show here and decided to give it a shot.

Right away the energy was great as the servers Michael and Tiffany were constantly in motion and handling the patrons within moments I had my Brown Ale in hand. 

I noticed the 9"" Chicago deep dish pizza for $9.99 and thought I'd give it a go.  The Pizza takes roughly 25 minutes to make and upon arriving I knew I had made a great choice.

The Pizza was hearty and cooked perfectly The cheese was holding the piece from coming out of the pie after cutting it.  The pepperoni, sausage and cheese made up the 1"" thickness of the pie. I was only able to finish 1/2 of it.  Lucky for me my family was there to help finish the remaining pieces along with the house Root Beer (the menu states voted Best of Las Vegas and after tasting I see why) definitely a must try.

The next night we came back 11/23/16 and brought even more guests as we went from a party of 4 to a party of 11.  Again the service was spot on but this time we tried several appetizers.  Everything from the garlic knots with marinara sauce, mozzarella sticks and table favorite chicken tenders satisfied our need to feed.

The chicken tenders were another high quality item the breading was seasoned perfectly and 5 large juicy pieces are sure to please.

The pizza arrived almost 45 minutes after we placed our order and it was lukewarm, which suggested to me that it had been sitting for a while.  My fiancé and I were only one of two tables at the time, so it's kind of incredible that our waitress forgot about us.  When I asked for Parmesan, I got a sticky, goopy, flat-out nasty shaker...aren't you supposed to clean those from time to time??  The pizza itself was okay...the sauce was pretty unusual.  It was a meat sauce, almost like they had run out of regular pizza sauce and subbed a pasta sauce instead.  It was bizarre-tasting and had an equally bizarre texture.

Stopped in for a quick bite before a concert downtown and wow am I impressed and so relieved. I truly gave up on finding decent Chicago-Style pizza. Not only did I find that, but as well they have great tasting crafts on draft and iced cold! 

Started off with the sampler of crafts. Literally a carousel of 9 samples for only $9 bucks! The drinks were great and threw in a side of calamari to start. 

Now normally I have low expectations on calamari as I generally know where to go to have a great appetizer portion of calamari. (An authentic Italian restaurant!) However, this place - best Calamari since my review in Tucson. 

Ordered the Deep Dish pizza (no meat #vegetarian) and again - decent size and definitely enough for 2-3 people (with appetizers and drinks of course). The red sauce was bold but balanced. Amazing stringy cheese when you pull out a slice and not too much dough - which really set it off. 

All in all very impressed and happy to have found a go-to Chicago Style eatery in downtown Las Vegas. It's located in the Four Queens. 

The only caution I would give is if you are sensitive to cigar smoke, this may not be the place for you. Yea - that's right! It duals as a cigar bar and this guy is not offended one bit. As matter of fact the sweet smells of cigar tobacco while eating the rich buttery Deep Dish and refreshing sampler was enough to have me sit back and my chair and feel a great amount of contentment.

This past Friday was slammed and I am not sure if Pride had anything to do with it. It could be that this restaurant is always jam packed. Anyways, our party of three found a spot near the bar and situated down. Normally the waitresses will bring the menu, but they were busy, so I snagged a couple. 

When our waitress appeared, she was quick to take our drink orders. The specialty beer right now is a Mango Hef. A pint goes for $4 and the larger one is $5. 

The menu is drastically smaller than the Rampart location, but they do have a few vegetarian friendly dishes. My friend and I ordered a Greek Salad and a Vegetarian Pizza. Our waitress was sweet enough to have the salad split for us with the dressing on the side. The amount that we each got was large. Too bad the dressing was mainly oil. Even after mixing it up, the oil was predominantly what ended up on the salad. The pizza was good. The crust was soggy in certain areas, but that tends to happen with a veggie pizza. The nice chunks of zucchini or squash, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, and olives gave many different textures. The seasoning that they used on their crust was something we found ourselves wiping up.

Because it was so busy, the staff were not too concern with putting away dishes in a quiet manner. We heard every clank and clunk as dishes were thrown into bus tubs. There were not any refills either or an attempt to check in on us.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,1,3,M6_Y4gz_P2peZTVLVMnA3Q

With the exception of one restaurant, that being Chicago Brewing Company in the Four Queens Hotel & Casino, not one of them has actually lived up to the claim of having real Chicago-style pizza.
Fortunately, this is that restaurant, so this is a positive review! They apparently have another location across town, but this is the one I've dined in. Several times, in fact.
The restaurant occupies a little nook in the corner of the Four Queens, and though the prices aren't super-cheap (though you can go across the street to one of the sports bars if dollar-fifty hot dogs are your thing), they're quite fair, and the garlic knots include a surprising amount of sustenance for the price. The beers are apparently brewed at the other location, but they're still local, and they're still delicious. So I recommend them highly.
Get the sampler flight. It's not only eye-catching to have a bunch of wee mugs artfully presented on a two-tiered tray, it's a great way of finding out which of the beers you think you'll like are what you really want to drink, and which beers you weren't sure if you'd like at all are actually a lot better than you'd expected. That's how I found their fruity wheat beer (I think it may have been blueberry), and how we decided what to bring home in a growler.
For the pizza? Get it. It's as close as I've ever found to being real Chicago-style pizza, like I've said before. Reviewers of the other location that are *from Chicago* concur. Maybe it's just not entirely possible to make Chicago-style pizza anywhere but Chicago, but these guys come close and it's delicious to boot. They may have other offerings on the menu, but I never bothered to try because I was so happy to find real Chicago-style pizza.
I feel I've probably not said Chicago-style pizza enough times. Chicago-style pizza. Chicago-style pizza. Chicago-style pizza. There we go.
Anyway, if you like what I keep talking about, then go here. If you've never had Chicago-style pizza (in Chicago or anywhere else), try it here if you're in Vegas. Definitely worth the stop.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,3,0,5,vOBpAG5PTG-wjmeGvhc08w

Ive been to Chicago on several occasions, and while I dont know about their regular pizza, the deep dish doesnt taste anywhere remotely close to Chicago.

Also there is limited seating. One side is smoking section & the other is non smoking both are very small. Visiting this place was definitely worth it for the Root Beer & the Cheese Knots.

The bartender was super friendly and helpful.  I had the beer sampler (see pic) and all the beers were delicious.  Each one seemed to accurately represent that particular style of brewing.  My favorites were the Ramblin Reck Amber Ale, the Old Town Brown and the IPA.  I also smoked a great cigar at the bar.  The food coming out of the kitchen looked great and next time I'll definitely eat.  The beer was really outstanding and so was the service.  Chicago Brewing Company is located on the second floor of Four Queens.  I've been in the casino many times and never seen the restaurant until the day we went there.  The ambiance is typical neighborhood bar...very comfortable and casual.  I'll be back at here every time I'm in the downtown area.

When I do get down there though, Chicago Brewing is one of the main reasons for it. The staff has always been great, and the beers really good, especially on a hot Vegas day or night.

I really like the pizza, and they do have plenty of other items other than pizza. But, those garlic knots with marinara sauce are the bomb. Put a plate of those in front of me with a tall one, and I'm a happy camper. The place is small, but i think that's part of the charm of it. It would loose some of the allure to me if it was any bigger. Prices are decent as well.

If you like good food, good beer, friendly people, then you're at the right place. But damn, get you some of those garlic knots.",DgZ-_dpdjpJBjCwVdxmLFA,0,0,4,Fn_gTlcl9FFUT-jo5MGXrQ

Decent beer.  The pours are extremely nice here.  You can buy a pitcher of IPA for $20, or a 32 Oz for $13.  We got the pitcher.

The IPA is decent.  It's really a standard IPA.  No complaints about it.  I'd say it's on par w/ BJ's Brewery.

TIPS:
-Located in the ""4-Queens"" Casino in Fremont area
-Inside is pretty old T
-There are lots of TV's inside",pzwPuIDTpsd_ykGJ0CtuCg,1,0,3,LyS_1KcoMLGBy1VpRisfcQ

There are quite a few other menu items that caught my eye as well, so I look forward to my next visit there. It'll definitely be sooner than later. I'll have to add this to my regular rotation in town.
