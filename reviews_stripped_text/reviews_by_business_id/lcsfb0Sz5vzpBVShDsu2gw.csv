253027,2017-08-03,0,lcsfb0Sz5vzpBVShDsu2gw,Why I will never step foot in a PTs again. Golden Gaming sent me some free play so me and my wife stopped by the PTs Place on Sahara about 5 in the morning only to be met by the rudest bartender in Vegas. My wife puts $20 in her machine and starts playing I punched in my free play and started playing. It took the bartender at least 5 minutes to get to me even though there was only one other person in the bar I handed him a $20 and told him to give me back $19 and give me a beer. He very rudely told me he couldn't comp me until I played $20 I put a $20 in the machine even though I had already lost $15 he then says I had to play a dollar a hand because I was playing Cleo keno I have played at PTs for years and never heard such a thing I start off betting 2 quarters and add one quarter to it every time I get a bonus in till I Max out at 10 quarters. I told my wife let's go. Golden Gaming without the locals you would be out of business you are not too big to fail so keep the small free play you send me and I will play at Dotties where my play is appreciated and they have no problem comping a beer. There's a reason the bar was empty your rude bartender,R5E8LavtLSCKTJ0PDFdomw,0,0,1,w8JanNbX9Pzv3soUFXHYLQ

mine. The bartender asked me for my id and i asked
""when is happy hour?"" She relplied ""Now now"" and gave me sarcastic smile. I paid for my drink with my debit card and she never gave it back, never asked me if i wanted to keep a tab. After i got my first drink and an order of fries, I waited for her to come around to see if i needed snother drink. Before I knew it, 45 minutes had gone by. My friend finally waved down another bartender and asked him whats on the happy hour menu. He gave us a menu and i asked ""So is it half off appitizers?"" He said ""No its not on the menu we have to tell you one one."" (I dont know why he gave me a menu that doest have what i asked for) He then said he didnt know what was on the happy hour menu and slowly looked away and brushed us off.

We usually stop in and have a bucket of wings 1/2 parmesian garlic and 1/2 lemon pepper and they are usually very good.

I was just going to chalk it up and go somewhere else next time but my husband wasnt having it.

My husband likes them for the saltyness. These were ....terrible and uneatable.
 Anyway, Ryan intercepted and made everything right. Its not very often, anymore,  where employees treat the customers in a way that they appreciate their business. It seems like employees everywhere have a bad attitude these days.

They have a great happy hour and decent beers on tap that rotate seasonally. 

James is pretty much the only reason why I go because he is probably the best bartender in town. By the best, I don't mean that he juggles bottles and stuff like that. I mean that he is attentive, mellow, kind, laid back, pretty much everything you would want in a boyfriend. 

The crowd is a mixed bag, and sort of shifty at times. It is located downtown, after all. But then there are normal people that stop in for drinks, to play video poker, etc.

4409573,2009-08-29,1,lcsfb0Sz5vzpBVShDsu2gw,"Waht I'm about to write are not actually criticisms but observations. In a strange Vegas way, these things are the setting of a community environment to me.

When I first actually made plans to go in there, it was to talk to a potential roommate. She was a dispatch caller for one of those escort services. She asked me if it was okay if all the girls came around all hours for their ""assignments."" Some of you are shrieking in horror, but think about it. For a guy, this would be immense drama, but would there ever be a better source of Vegas stories in your life? In retrospect, I should have taken her offer instead of moving in with a ""friend"" who wound up stealing a lot of shit from me after being his maid for 2 years.

I went back a couple of times after and thought this was a hooker bar. I noticed a lot of platinum blonds with bling, but the kinda bling that doesn't mark affluence but a trip to the swap meet. They seemed to get called into ""service"" halfway thru their burger. One even brought an old guy in who hobbled in with a cane, looks like he was spending the last of his money for a final fling situation.

The food there- and most PT's in the chain- are excellent. I had my first really good Monte Cristo there, which is sad because they have since removed it from the menu, damn recession. It's basic burger/ sandwich stuff on the menu. they have specials and their deal is they have 3 sizes of ""buckets"" that are filled with fries, mini burgers, poppers, etc. As I write this, happy hour is from 4-7 every evening where drafts and pizzas are half off. There's another happy hour and I have to guess, since I can't find my weekly. It may be midnight to 4:00AM. Call ahead or google it.

Oh, another group of people I noticed that the bartender commented on was cross dressers. There's a group that meets there regularly. In all honesty, I only have 2 problems with cross dressers: 1) Why the hell would you ever decide to wear high heels? Those things are unbearable (someone had shows that actually fit me and tried it ONCE, just to feel. No, I didn't go out like that or anything). 2) more of a question, I don't understand why cross dressers wear feathered out hair and as a group look like a bunch of 40 year olds in the 80's. Their clothes, and look, the dresses and jeans aren't from any other decade.

The bartenders are cute and the cook hangs out. We shoot the shi7. I also love their grilled chicken plate there, taco salad. I'm real easy, I actually prefer ""bar food"" over any of the ""4-5 star"" celebrity chef places on the strip. I've paid a fortune to have a server be snide with me and felt like the food was too froo froo, no substance.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,1,0,4,0Nq8Ij1u0ClRf_Bqi5XOzQ

So my bf, his sister and her friend headed to PT's on Sahara after hitting up a couple of other place. The place was semi empty we found some seats at the back of the bar. One of my friends orders a strong, fruity drink and I order a bloody mary. Well my friend can't tast or smell any alcohol and asks the bartender if he forgot to put it in. He said there is only strong and only fruity, both cannot exist together. The fruity will always hide the liquor. Well after I sipped my bloody mary I realized the bartender was full of crap. My bloody mary tasted like cold tomato juice, no alcohol and no spice. It appears that the bartender doesn't know how to make a drink or just is stingy with the alcohol and has to make some bull answer up, so we paid for the crap drinks and left.

Than we ordered the spinach dip with garlic toast an chips, which I loved very much! The atmosphere is mellow, not too noisy, very clean and our waitress was very nice/pleasant. 
I enjoy this bar for it's location, cleanliness and tasty food. 
Will I go back? Haha I've been going here before yelp was taking reviews! Of course I'll be back!!",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,4,5,5,djRZYuAAYiM2GROwZRWh3w

Our bartender Aluna is amazing and very helpful. We are here on a Sunday morning for football and have no problem getting the bears game. Although at all pt's the sound is only on one tv and it's first come first serve. 
The cook is also very professional and timely. The food here is typical bar food and tastes alright. Overall I'm a happy camper.",9P2KHV6WO_qajNunQU_f3g,1,0,5,NqGw7EZv32AxjjGdXsTn4A

I will not be ordering food from them again hence I will be going to a different bar now... drinks are nice their during happy hour but you can get those same drinks anywhere... plus I've noticed that they tighten the machines all over PT's in general... so I'm down losing money there I will be trying Timbers now since I'm told they have better drinks, better food and the machines are looser",gNeHmdFpIaPQ0OwPqb78hw,0,0,1,WSZdJ45ceMs7wXoIz8V8kQ

Our waitress told us that there is a special price for the breakfast items from 6 till 10 am. Overall it was a very good experience,  the only reason k give this place 4 stars is because in my opinion it is a little bit too expensive for that particular neighborhood and for the environment/atmosphere it offers. Solid 4 stars.",wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,0,0,4,mYnvBMNEkEtk_b9CEm9SLw
