297740,2017-09-09,0,y-ZZe1dz8AMjiAwNVo3h_A,I took my mother in law here since we were in the shopping center anyway and she has always wanted to try sushi burrito. The staff was extremely polite and friendly but some of the tools they needed to perfect a sushi burrito was not working and they were trying so hard but even with giving it 110% the burritos were messy which was fine my concern was with the quality of fish. You know it's not good when you toss your other half of the burrito in the trash. After a few bites I kind of figured I have a 50/50 chance of getting an upset stomach. The place is beautiful and the staff was wonderful the food quality or storage needs to be addressed.,nuUUp2tP1_U5bNGWxQn3mg,1,0,2,NGIi-X3OBDVauRkx96OTbQ

The food is always fresh and delicious so that is not where my complaint comes from. The customer service my last several visits has been awful. I am not only not acknowledged when I walk in but with no one in front of me in line it takes over 10 minutes to make a bowl. If I ask for a product that they have to restock from the fridge they give me attitude and act annoyed. It's your job!!! There were three employees and instead of trying to make my bowl in an efficient manner they stood there and chatted. My meal was $15 and I always leave a tip so when I am spending $17 dollars on a meal for myself even though it is somewhat fast food I expect some decent customer service. I got handed my credit card back after I paid and did not have a single closing remark such as ""thank you"" or ""have a nice day"". Honestly it seems like this place cannot function without a manager on the floor.

-I told the staff about 3 times that it was my first time there and they didn't really show care to guide me through the menu. Even after I had questions in regards to my options. They weren't very helpful and a couple of them just looked annoyed to be there. Customer service is lacking but sometimes it feels that CS is no longer a norm.
-asked for extra sauce and the guy there was helpful. However, it should be pointed out that if you are taking your food to go it's highly recommended to get the sauce on the side. The container the food comes in is not water proof so it soaks up some of the sauce and whatever the container doesn't soak up the rice definitely does. Perhaps if you dine in is not a big deal since you can just get up and ask for more, but if you take it to go you will be eating sauceless tuna/fish and soggy rice. 
-the container is not helpful if you want to toss your salad/bowl. Maybe there should be an option to get your salad tossed.

1188104,2017-06-20,0,y-ZZe1dz8AMjiAwNVo3h_A,"This is the worst poke place I have ever been in. The quality was the wrist I have ever experienced. Their new sushi taco was probably the ugliest and the worst thing I have tasted when it comes to raw fish. I ordered only salmon for my tacos and man was it terrible. As soon as you pick it up it's soggy and breaks apart before you can even put it in your mouth. Apart from being overall soggy, the fish was not fresh. Every bite I took was fishy and God awful. The second I ordered was their burrito and man was it ugly and unappealing. Taking it out of the bag I noticed a ton of shit already falling apart. Granted that it's seaweed, they should have added another layer at least if they were going to roll it in that way. 

Price: The price is very debatable depending on what you add onto your poke. The thing that pissed me off the most was the fact that they actually make you pay extra for certain toppings like masago. I have never been charged for masago at any poke place that I have been to. Aside from that, you would find all the toppings you would like and then some more. 

Customer service: Isn't this what makes the customer intrigued to come back for more? I swear my wife is just picking out the toppings she would like on her poke and all 4 workers stand there rushing us to finish up our order. Overall I would not recommend anyone go to this place because there are plenty of other options in the area. If you live in California in the areas of Riverside or Westminster go to ""Low Key Poke."" you will not be disappointed. It's a good way to take this crappie  quality out of your mouth.

Service was very good and the young gal who assembled my burrito included a generous portion of avocado which I appreciated.  The total cost was $10.76.  Today I stopped in and ordered the same thing.  When I asked for the avocado, I noticed several that had been cut open and were browning.  He did cut open a fresh one but hardly put any on the burrito.  I asked if I could have more and he stated it was an extra charge which I okayed.  When I checked out, the price came to $13.98.  For some reason, finishing up my order took a good 5 minutes more when they only had to add chicken.  While I waited, I looked at the receipt and saw I was charged $1.49 for each serving of avocado.  I checked the menu and yes, that is an extra charge on the build your own so I got a bargain the first time.  However, for a $1.49, I expect a serving of avocado that I ended up paying twice for.  I'm going to question the avocado next time.  They seem a little disjointed and probably need some better training.

The bright Summerlin location has the same menu as the Henderson one, with FOUR awesome dishes that make them stand apart from the many other poke bowl spots in town.

+ Avocado boats! Good low carb option with healthy fats. Poke scooped in an avocado half. Light and delicious.
+ Poke tacos! Available at 2/$5 as an app that works as a fun snack, able to be customized with an added topping or sauce. Super fun new way to do Taco Tuesday!
+ Pineapple bowls. OMG. I'm not much of a pineapple fan but dangit if I don't want one of these. Same as a regular DIY or specialty poke bowl, just served in a scooped out pineapple half. It's like the oversized citrus version of the avocado boats.
+ Acai bowls! Wanna make healthy choices but don't want fish? If the chicken/beef options aren't your thing, the acai bowl is another option. Pretty and fresh, I'll be getting one of these next!

Service is friendly, but staff seem to be new so there may be slight delays as they get more familiar with the menu. This location is slightly closer to me than the first.

2 stars because of an incident I witnessed here a few days ago that I felt compelled to tell because I thought it was so pathetic. Came in during lunch and theres a short line of 4 people. One employee is helping the first lady in line, a second employee is about to help the second guy in line but the lady says her second order to him instead so both employees are now making her food. The guy behind her gets super upset. He's a regular from the fact that a third employee knows him by name and by order and she asks him whats wrong. He goes on a tangent about how rude the lady ahead of him is and people in general are so inconsiderate and gets kind of aggressive. 

Poor lady (whos in her nurse scrubs) realizes her mistake and starts apologizing. Says shes super sorry to the guy and is really polite. She wasnt paying attention. Honest mistake, nothing intentional. The guy just seems to get angrier. At this point the manager is now cashier comforting the lady. Angry guy hears and starts ranting even more. Makes everything awkward and everyone uncomfortable. Honestly idk what this guys deal was, but either way he would have to wait to order and pay after the lady. He got such a horrible attitude from something so small. He should be ashamed of himself. I wanted to eat there but I just took my order to-go instead.

Overall, I know its not their fault but the least they couldve done was tell that guy to calm down. Very passive with the way they handled it. Anyway my poke bowl was fine but overpriced. $15 for a regular size..",cKqZk06hmnX3UrEzzfFVkg,0,0,2,ZvY_r1lONooCl4VBsw-vwA

1744647,2017-03-10,1,y-ZZe1dz8AMjiAwNVo3h_A,"I really wanted to love this place. I figured that if the restaurant was able to open up a second location, then it must be that good to be able to afford a location in Summerlin. It's the closest poke place to me, so I would've loved to be able to drive up Town Center Dr whenever I needed a good poke fix. But alas...

I came with a friend on Thursday around 5:30PM. We were greeted by the staff upon entering, which was nice. They have lots of seating and even have a patio with lights. Very cute! But the wait man. THE WAIT WAS SO LONG. These poke places are supposed to be like assembly lines. You're supposed to walk in, order what you want down the line, and then be out the door. BUT THIS WAIT WAS RIDICULOUS. I know this place just opened, but I've been to plenty of other similar establishments in both Vegas and SoCal--I've never waited this long before. Just watching the employees move so slowly was so excruciatingly painful.

The price point is just right. They had less premade combos than Soho, but it seemed like they had more sauces to choose from. I enjoyed The Omega bowl I got, and my friend liked his Stupid Good Tuna burrito enough. Initially I felt like the honey sesame aoili had a weird thick viscosity to it and tasted a little odd, but it definitely grew on me. Also, their ingredients were very very fresh. 

They also have a rewards program.

Overall, I felt like the food was very good, but that wait just killed me. Maybe I'll come back in another 3 months and see if they've picked up their speed.

Their regular and large bowls only differ by $2 and 2 scoops of protein. I opted for the large bowl - they got me with the only $2 more dang it lol I got half and half of tuna and salmon. When looking at the sauces, I was not that impressed because of the lack of variety. I literally asked for plain sesame oil and the girl gave me some attitude -  she had this look of uhhhh that's not one of the choices. Then she looks at the girl next to her and they suggested  I try sesame aioli but I dont like mayo so I said no. I was just a little annoyed, because it was awkward when I asked for just plain sesame oil and she looked at me with some 'tude.

HOWEVER, I truly hope they invest in training their employees better. Sweet girls working but they were clueless. It wasn't even busy and it took forever to make our burritos. I work in the industry and am very forgiving when it comes down to it but I have NEVER been asked multiple times about what else was supposed to go in my burrito. I ordered the omega so there were already a list of set ingredients (avocado, salmon, lettuce, tomato, onion, and 2 sauces if I recall correctly). The menu with the list of ingredients was on the board behind the employee. No one should be put out on the floor not knowing the ingredients. And even if they don't know, LOOK and DO NOT ask your customers multiple times what else is supposed to go in it. The person I was with was also asked multiple times what was supposed to go in theirs (i forget which burrito was ordered). It didn't seem like any of the others knew what they were doing either. Condiments were either completely out or almost out, no ice in soda machine, and my acai bowl NEVER came out until I had to ask the girl down who said she was making it but decided to go clean windows instead while we were standing there waiting (who also asked us to step aside so she could get to the windows better).

Tail and Fin was the perfect introduction to sushi burritos. The concept is kind of like Subway, you can either choose from their menu of rolls or you can build your own. You can add on additional items such as veggies, sauce, etc as you like, choose either seaweed or soy wrapping and boom, sushi burrito! A regular sized roll was $9.95 and a large was around $12. The restaurant was clean and bright, so we opted to eat in. 

I selected the Shrimp Tempest (as a newbie to sushi burritos, i thought it best to start with one from the menu). We noticed that the lettuce looked a little old/brown, and the server did too. Instead of trying to serve us wilted lettuce, he volunteered to chop some fresh lettuce in the back. That's great service! 

The server who rung us up (Sophia), was also super sweet and cheerful, so we were off to a great start. 

Now, let's see what the fuss is all about.. first bite- delicious!! I really could taste everything, the shrimp tempura, the crab, the veggies, and the sauce. The seaweed wrap was the perfect holder- at least until the end, when things get a little messy. 
The regular burrito was a good size and I felt that it was fairly priced.

I first discovered this establishment because of their taco shaped sushi rolls.



I bet if I ended my review after my last sentence people would still go there solely based off the fact that they have sushi in the shape of TACOS!!! Hey, I mean, I'm guilty of that. Sushi burritos are sooo 2017.

Back to what I was saying, this place is fresh to death. From their clean dinning atmosphere to their fish selection. Plus, they never get chincy with their portions and are very accommodating to changing up what you want in their signature creations. 

Chincy (definition found on Urban Dictionary):

Cheap, low quality


I work at T-Mobile Arena and go to their stand every time I work, along with all of my fellow coworkers. Originally, it was because it was the healthiest alternative so we weren't always eating candy, popcorn, pretzels or chicken tenders with fries. Don't get me wrong, I love all those things; but when sushi is an option, it is ALWAYS the answer.

The staff is honestly what makes us keep coming back for more though. The owner of Tail and Fin is always working on Golden Knights game days and is so welcoming to the line of T-Mobile staff that waits for them to draw back the curtain. For obvious reasons, on game days it's fitting to get the Golden Knights bowl, a dish you can only get at their T-Mobile stand, not at one of their brick and mortar locations. I speak on behalf of myself and everyone else, that we really appreciate how they tolerate our excessive need for extra seaweed salad, tempura flakes and eel sauce. Because it's just not the same if it's not coated in a blanket of eel sauce.

On the menu you have a choice to build your own Sushi Burrito or bowl or you can choice from one of their signature favorites. If you've never had a Sushi Burrito, the menu can be a little overwhelming if you're not familiar with the options but going with a signature favorite is always a good choice. I asked one of the employees for a recommendation and the response I got was ""they are all good"" so that didn't really help. They will get that question often so it would be a good idea to recommend some items or find out what the person likes. 

I decided to try ""The Shrimp Tempest"" Burrito that has shrimp tempura, crab, avocado, green onion, carrot, and unagi sauce (it's like a sweet teriyaki sauce). It was REALLY good! The Burrito's are a good size and will fill you up. I tried to make mine a combo that comes with a side, drink, and a desert for $3 more. However, they were out of miso soup and out of the cucumber salad which was disappointing as there was still a few hours before closing. 

The restaurant is really nice, trendy, and clean. There is an option for both indoor and outdoor seating. Upon entering, there were a couple people ahead of me and the workers were busy so they didn't look up and welcome me. There also wasn't a lot of smiles as the workers seemed a little overwhelmed. I'm assuming cause it's the grand opening. I would recommend to the employees to greet every person who comes in and make sure they smile, especially if you're trying to keep the excitement up of the new location. Also, I was asked if I was signed up for the reward program and I said no and they asked for my phone number but didn't give me any info on what the program was about or how it worked.

Has everything you'd expect from a sushi burrito place. Unfortunately, the standard for me in Vegas for sushi burrito places is Soho.  So what is lacking?

 The burritos and tacos were good but nothing better than any other sushi burrito/bowl place around town but the wrap job on the burrito definitely needs some work. 
All in all I think this place has potential but it's definitely not worth it to drive to if you don't live nearby.  I'm probably going wait 6 months and try this place out again then. Hopefully by then the employees figure out how to properly wrap the burritos and speed things up a bit.

I wish there was more shrimp for the price you pay for the tiny wrap. There wasn't much flavor to the wrap in general. More sauce(s) would be perfect for more flavor. Lastly, the romaine lettuce was a weird texture to with the rest of the wrap. It didn't seem to be cohesive with the rest of the ingredients and it just fell out of the wrap anyways.

As a tip, the pineapple is a waste.  It might be instagram-worthy, but it adds no additional flavor and the edge of the pineapple is impossible to get off and eat; so it's just a cooler looking bowl for $2.  The thing I like a bout Tail and Fin is they don't skimp on the toppings or protein.  For the base make-your-own option, you get 4 portions of any meat and all the toppings in the world.  I had a sample of 4 meats - albacore, spicy tuna, spicy crab, and salmon.  All were fresh with the spicy tuna being my favorite.  Generous portions of the protein were complimented by tons of veggies from lettuce to edamame to carrot to fish eggs.  My meal was delicious, especially topped with some spicy sauce (though definitely mild).  Another tip is to throw on some ginger and wasabi to make it more Japanese.  Though many option were fishy and more sushi-based, anyone will have the opportunity to come here and get something with chicken and veggie options offered as well.

The service was extremely slow as there was only one person up front and it's not a quick process with so many options and the unfamiliarity of the ordering process and ingredients by most patrons.  The person behind the counter was nice enough to recommend the most popular sauces and proteins, so the slow pace was really the only complaint with the meal ordering process.

Tail and Fin is worth the money for a nice fast casual, healthy, lunch every once in a while.  I think it's the best in town from what I've tried.  Though the poke and sushi burrito fad may go away, I think Tail and Fin is here to stay.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,3,1,4,oCqfFylFnNF_5CN_wxMh-Q

I came to the place from a friends' recommendation to get their pineapple bowl. As they scooped all the ingredients forward I was pretty excited since the bowl was so picturesque. While a bit on the expensive side for poke, I understood the Summerlin upcharge.

Unfortunately, the fish was beyond lackluster. The bits of tuna felt like it had a gelatinous wall surrounding it. I pretty much had a crunch with each bite. I thought the pineapple bowl had been thawed in the back, but was completely frozen. The rice they added for the dish had gone from a nice steam in their cooker to a frozen hard mess. I understand that they have to freeze the pineapple for storage, but serving it frozen completely ruined my appetite for most of the ingredients.

3855271,2018-01-02,1,y-ZZe1dz8AMjiAwNVo3h_A,"My boyfriend and I made sure to pay Tail and Fin a visit during our trip to Vegas because we saw their promotional video on Facebook and our mouths watered instantly. Well, I'm happy to report that they do indeed live up to the hype.

You can go to a food festival and easily pay $8 for ONE sushi taco because it's such a ""cute"" gimmick. At Tail and Fin, we ordered TWO sushi tacos for only $5. You pick the protein and sauce. Sure, they're a bit small -- the size of your fist. Sure, the tacos fall apart half-way through. But, for the price, it was deliciously worthwhile... Four, wonderful bites of bliss.

Their menu is quite creative otherwise. You can opt for a DIY sushi burrito (seaweed or soy wrap), salad bowl (mixed greens or romaine lettuce), or poke bowl (sushi rice or brown rice) for about $10. 

Choose from one of these proteins: Yellowtail, Tuna, Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Salmon, Imitation Crab, Tempeh, Soft Shell Crab, or Grilled Chicken. Extra scoop of protein is an additional $2.

You can then add veggies/toppings, such as edamame, cucumber, green onion, carrot, tomato, cilantro, etc. Unfortunately, ""special"" toppings like avocado, mango, masago (smelt egg), coconut and pomegranate are about $1.50 extra.

Finish off with some sauces -- such as ponzu sauce, teriyaki sauce, yuzo miso sauce, wasabi aioli or chili garlic aioli.

...OOF. In short, a much more diverse menu than I've seen at other comparable places.

If you'd prefer one of their Signature Creations -- there's a dozen of them to choose from. I opted for The OG for ~$13. 

The OG: Comes with ahi tuna, salmon, yellowtail, green onion, romaine lettuce (asked for the lettuce to be excluded), cucumber, and poke sauce. YUM YUM YUM. No need to personalize when you find an option that already includes all of your favorites!

The service was pretty good, don't get me wrong, which is why I'm giving the star, but the food was ehh. Don't get me wrong, the staff were particularly attentive and I believe the owner was also there helping, which was awesome.

For the food, I thought it was a bit overpriced compared to other places. It might be because it's located in Summerlin, but it didn't seem like you get what you paid for. I don't know if it was this particular day, but the salmon and crab were very fishy tasting and smelling today. And it might just be me, but bits and pieces also tasted like straight up cardboard.

I've been a loyal Sweet Poke fan, so I'm probably used to them mixing the fish and sauce and having masago free, but I was so disappointed when I saw they put the fish on the bowl and then drizzle their sauce without mixing it. I think the fish would have had more flavor that way. Overall, I don't think I would come back. I'll stick to my Sweet Poke place even if is a longer drive.

Tail & Fin is quite good.  The quality of the tuna and salmon is not great, but that is just me and my horrifically high standards of being a pescatarian and exposed to exceptional sashimi grade fish from all over the planet.  But short my disclaimer about quality, which I think I would probably say the same about any other similar sushi burriot place I might walk in, unless NOBU is opening a sushi burrito place in Vegas that I am unaware of, I really liked Tail & Fin and would absolutely return.    

The staff assembled my burrito with almost the precision of a surgeon.  Loads of colorful, protein packed goodness made it virtually impossible to consume it with my hands and required a fork.  I felt it was a good quantity of stuff inside and the taste was delicious.  I cannot remember the name, but I have the Omega one with all the fishes and then actually added another.

After randomly spotting Tail and Fin in my local shopping plaza, my boyfriend and I decided to try it because c'mon...sushi burrito. I've had many sushi burritos and poke bowls at many different locations and Tail and Fin did not disappoint. The cashier recommended the Stupid Good Tuna and I was on board with that - tuna is my most favorite (raw) fish. 

This sushi burrito consisted of ahi tuna, surimi crab (which is basically imitation crab), lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, tempura flakes, yuzu miso sauce and unagi sauce. I also decided to wrap everything with seaweed however, you can also choose soy paper. Since there was no spice, I added sriracha and furikake to top it off. Let me tell you, the flavors were all there! You definitely need the unagi and yuzu miso sauce to tie everything together so make sure they don't skimp you on that. With that said, I could've done without the tomato and lettuce - it didn't really add much to the burrito for me and just took up space. The way the burrito is constructed made it very hard to eat because it was not completely wrapped, and the ingredients kept falling out but nonetheless the food was great. 

This location offers ""build-your-own"" sushi burrito and poke bowls so the options are endless! Keep that in mind if none of their signature creations sound appetizing.",UgSH2kQf1XvCYWl5QHUNUQ,2,0,4,pPVwurp4Yt1bK6wSIfIRQw

The flavors that came together in the sushi burrito were stupid good and I loved the tang of the red onion. My only complaint is I felt the portion was rather small and I am still hungry. I guess that's why they offer the larger portion but I didn't want to spend 13$ on a burrito. Although it was small it was phenomenal and I devoured that baby. The staff was what made the experience top notch however. The girls were very friendly and talkative and even let me use a phone charger so that my phone wouldn't die and leave me stranded. They are the reason this was a 5 star review because without them I would've gone 4 stars cause of the portion size.

I usually like to pair my poke with brown rice but it is always served cold and hard so I tried switching to white rice, which wasn't much better. The fish itself is alright, I have had better elsewhere, and they also charge extra for many of the other toppings. Lastly, I prefer when poke places mix the sauce with the protein so that everything is incorporated, as opposed to putting a relatively light drizzle on top of everything, which compromises the overall flavor of the bowl (of course, the burrito is a different story).

Stopped in after viewing a few blogger photos via social media of a pineapple party in my mouth.

I ordered The Signature Creation ""Flaming Tuna"" in the pineapple bowl $9.95+ ($2 EXTRA for the pineapple-free pineapple) 

I opted for no rice and I probably shouldn't have because I'm still hungry although the cashier said it would fill me up W/O ordering the tacos. 

The bowl was good, the place is very clean and the ambiance is relaxing. 

I doubt I'd return unless I'm in the area.  Creating your own bowl is the best option to satisfy your hunger. #LessonLearnedTheHardWay",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,4,3,5,k5fKj5qn_DcirfwqACIHIw

The menu is very limited and the girl didn't know the difference between masago and tamago. They should hire people who have actually had poke and sushi knowledge and pride in what they're selling.

I had gone before and my experience was so-so... so since I was out for lunch and had to stop at the post office... I figured why not?

I go in to order (no one is there) and the girl asks me what I'm getting. ""Just the Vegan Life please"" which is clearly prominent in the menu right above. After confirming I want the Vegan Life as a burrito... she asks the other girl on duty ""what is tee-peh?"". That's when they tell me they no longer have tempeh anymore. Hmm. Odd since it's still on the menu. Well, I'm hungry... and have to head back to work so she suggests the Garden Life. Fine. 

She dumps a whole scoop of jalapeños on my burrito after I request them. Thank goodness I love spicy. I don't think that's for everyone though.

As we head to towards the end, she goes to grab my avocado... it was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen. She was literally peeling the SKIN off the avocado. I've always used a spoon to scoop... but here she was picking the SKIN off bit by bit. Fine. Avocado is avocado. 

I get to the end and request Poke sauce. She dumps all Yuzu on it. Oops. ""Do you want me to remake it?"" No. By this point I'm just so over it and have to head back. She gives me some Poke sauce on the side and I am just so not impressed. The whole experience has been POO.

5767090,2017-02-10,0,y-ZZe1dz8AMjiAwNVo3h_A,"Size wise, they beat out Jaburritos. But ...Jaburritos beats them in flavor and efficiency. I was 2nd in line and it felt like forever getting through it. The burrito was GOOD but there was def more potential for flavor. It also fell apart as it wasn't rolled right (had to grab a fork. Which defeated the purpose of the burrito), and the seaweed was hard to chew through. But it was filling and yummy none the less! And their avocado was perfectly ripe.

I had the Shrimp Tempest and Quincy and Jared we're so helpful and patient with us since it was our first time. I will definitely be coming back to this place!

I came earlier in the day the other day since I work just right down the road and it was pretty busy. The young man with glasses I thought was very rude. A man in front of me was asking questions and he was giving him attitude and talking to him like he was stupid so I tired to avoid him. I didn't want to deal with him that morning. Then the other young lady with long brown hair was very good with customers, didn't have attitude or sassy or anything till there weren't any customers in line. I was sitting at my table eating and I kept over hearing her complaining she wanted to leave. That she ""had something to do."" As someone that works everyday hours I don't like and would rather be getting home to my kids sooner I get that she wanted to leave but I stay cause I need to. If you had something to do schedule it after work or on a day off. I don't know maybe it's just me but I didn't like the vibes of the place because of them and I'd rather not come back or be around that energy on my break.",TaBdJpSOcBBvlMDRoKq6Ng,0,0,1,sfY_XOySNzMBMxXUOlhLUw

I was sadly mistaken. The employees didn't know anything about allergens. I probably could have kept it simple with unmarinated fish and rice, but I cannot risk getting sick. So my husband kept it simple and risked it, but I unfortunately could not get anything. My niece ordered an açaí bowl, only to be told a few minutes later they didn't have the ingredients. Only reason I gave two stars was because my husband said his sushi burrito was pretty good. The staff should be better trained on ingredients. They should know what is in the food they're serving.",ZApCAOHduXde1ZFiY1QT3g,0,0,2,XXoUtr9YOsNbh8Twf09M4Q

A quick look at their online menu was slightly discouraging, but everything I tried was worth the price. 

The place is clean, comfortable and spacious. The service was great, as well. 

Definitely coming back again.",AfE9gOJCFceyHLbWE2UAPA,0,0,5,K46dIPdYtZ99qwG4Dhm4DA
