(For mediocre food) This last time I was in there, there was one person in there and she was at the counter, and 3 employees behind the counter. One girl was standing behind the food prep table staring at me, another young man was mopping the same spot the whole time I was there and the young lady was busy having a conversation with the one customer that was there.  She looked at me at least 5 times while she was talking to the one customer while looking at her phone. Finally the customer realized that I was standing there for roughly 5 minutes and being ignored and she said something. Then the young men put the mop down and decided he was going to help me now, while the young lady decided to turn around (with phone in hand) and go to the ice cream machine. It's honestly pretty bad customer service here. Also if you don't leave a tip, expect rolled eyes and even worse service. I honestly hope they close  and something else better goes in that location.

After 20 minutes, I am finally at the window and my food is not ready. How is this possible?

Shelley is the drive thru employee and she is handling cash and preparing food.  I was just asked to pull into the parking lot and told my food would be brought to me when it was ready.  How long does is take to cook fries and chicken bites?

Ok so this place looks like a diner. You would expect diner food. Not so much it's basically a fast food burger shop. Has a drive thru, walk up window, and the dining room is Open 24/7. 

You can get burgers, seasoned fries, processed fish or chicken sandwiches, shakes, hot dogs, nuggets and breakfast sandwich or burrito. 

I've ordered their big Buford it's big two 1/4 pound patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, mustard, mayo, pickles. Ordered it plain and the girl asked did you want cheese? Well the picture shows cheese and it says big Buford with cheese meaning you are charging me for cheese.  I said yes. She yells back add cheese very snarky, the fries are over salted and cold every time. I don't understand why you would salt seasoned fries.

 I've never seen anyone cook and I've been there 4 times. They pull good out of trays and put your good together. This last time I ordered the double checker burger with cheese no onion no tomato extra pickles no mustard no ketchup with their fries. So salty I didn't finish them. The burger came with 3 little pickles, tomato and mustard I didn't finish it. What a waste of money. 

I've had their banana shake tastes just like fake banana flavor. Their apple cinnamon pie was stale. Now breakfast sandwich with bacon. The bacon was hard the egg tastes like powdered egg and had some kind of cheese sauce. Not good. 

Bottom line is you won't get anything really good here and the service isn't good either and they just opened a few weeks ago. Hell you would be better off at subway next door.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,1,0,1,AHelJMi4_kMlTOE8vrBihg

The person working the drive thru was honest in letting me know they didn't have any wings that were fresh and or the amount that I was requesting. She explained that they would drop a whole new fresh batch and asked me to park so that they could bring them out to me when finished. Now I never throw a fit when it's for my food to come out fresh because well.. who wouldn't want a fresh order? The fact though that they don't offer any sauce for no additional charge is crazy.

Time: 7:07 pm

I'm not above eating fast food when it's good. This however, was not...

I was staying at the Hyatt Place (across the street) and was starved. While I love a good German sausage, sometimes you want something fast. Given that Checkers was new and locations in other cities had favorable reviews, and it was across the street I decided to give it a shot.

With Vegas, sometimes you gamble and win. But usually, you gamble and lose. At Checkers, I gambled and lost.

I ordered a plain all American cheeseburger and a 5 piece wings with medium buffalo.

Super tiny wings, these were anorexic chickens. Must have been raised in Beverly Hills, definitely not Foster Farm.

The plain burger came with mustard, ketchup, and pickle. So I sent it back. The""new"" burger was the exact same burger but with condiments scraped off. Nasty!

Third times is a charm: this time it was a plain burger. But at that point, I was over Checkers. Saw a homeless guy panhandling outside and gave him my burger.

Things to keep in mind:

- You get 1 napkin per entree. Even with wings. So bring wet wipes or napkins.
- There are no napkin dispensers. Probably to discourage stealing.
- They charge for sauce

On a positive side:

- Lots of places to sit (14 four-top tables)
- It was clean and the employees actively bused tables

However, I would not go back again.",Bv3Zt8seTtqks7PoriKvSw,11,9,1,8FByxmAL8gYKCEw0U1w41A

The service a rotating door where they seem to have endless new people every visit. Its annoying since they learn what's on their food as I order. The service was
fine but not remarkable. The cashier had to constantly ask his manager what's on that, or wheres that key. The manager was nice and maybe cut this employees collar maybe too soon. We all have to start somewhere though? The lobby was

4670166,2017-11-17,0,qrjRRBOUmN7MFxBQNuJZIA,"We tried this place for the first time yesterday evening and it was the worst first impression. As we walked in, we immediately told the cashier we were new customers and wanted to go simple for our first order: we wanted 2 cheeseburgers. The cashier tells us they have cheeseburger meals and points to the menu over her head, at a picture. We say great we'll take two and we want both meals the same- cheese and ketchup only on a plain bun, no seasoning/salt on the fries and 2 cokes with no ice. The girl looks utterly confused and now she says she doesn't know if they have a cheeseburger meal. The cashier goes and gets, what looked like, a shift manager, and tells her what we wanted and asks how to push it into the register. Then for the next 8 minutes the cashier can't figure out how we want our burgers! ""So you want mustard and Pickle only?"" ""Okay, so cheese and onion?"" ""Okay, no mustard and tomato but you want everything else?"" ""No cheese right?"" I swear to God! Then she says, ""Okay what don't you want on your cheeseburgers?"" Again we tell her we don't know what comes on them since we've never eaten Checkers before. At that point she shifts her weight, bites her lip, studies the register and says, ""Okay, well..."" I say, ""I don't see what your complication is. I couldn't make it any easier. Just put in what we do want, the list is shorter: I want 2 cheeseburger meals, on both burgers I want ONLY cheese and ketchup on a plain bun."" She goes, ""Oh okay. Anything else?"" I say, ""Are both cheeseburgers on a plain bun?"" She goes, ""Uh, I don't know,"" and turns to the 'shift manager' again for help. While the 'SM' is at the register I tell her my order in full and she, with attitude, says, ""You can't get your fries unseasoned."" Fair enough, so I ask her to please not crisp them like she's been doing with the other customers fries and she rolls her eyes at me. During this debacle, 2 customers brought their fries back because they were so cooked they couldn't be eaten. You'd think this would be the end of it but it wasn't. The cashier says, ""Your total is $12.56"" I give her $20.56 in cash. She tries giving me back $6.96. I tell her, ""You said the total was $12.56, I have you $20.56 and now you give me $8.00."" Instead of giving me my change she hands me the receipt and calls for the 'SM' again. They take the next 2 minutes to talk amongst themselves, ignoring me all together but the cashier was at least honest. Then the 'SM' says, ""Where's the receipt?"" At the same time the cashier and I say I have it. Holding it up, the 'SM' leans over the counter and rips the receipt out of my hand almost giving me a papercut instead of asking me to hand it to her. Then the 'SM' says, ""If you look here, the total is $13.60."" I say, ""She said $12.56."" The 'SM' says, ""Yeah, so? She's new. The total is $13.60, do you want your change or not?"" Are you kidding me? Meanwhile my Mom went to get ketchup and the dispenser exploded all over the counter, her sweater and left hand and despite over 7 tries, standing 3 ft away, no one, including the cashier and 'SM' will get her napkins. Instead the 'SM' says, ""Yeah well its been empty for a while."" The food was good but the service, it took 21 minutes with no line, to order my meal and even then they still forgot to give me my 2 drinks. The cashier had to look at my receipt to see what size I was suppose to get! Absolutely ridiculous and beyond the taste, I would NOT recommend you go.",vA6P_e_njzFUm8nqRAjQtg,0,0,1,MiDiIfp6DJjN9IWwQIJa-Q

A friend wanted to go to Checkers and I have not been there before even though I have seen commercials on T. V. and driven by one many times before. My friend said their fries are amazing, so I was excited to try that. 

We went through the drive thru and I ordered an American  cheese burger and funnel fries. Yes, as in funnel cake. Only it was in small stick shapes and sprinkled with powdered sugar. There was an option to have it fully loaded- strawberries and whip cream. I passed, but may try it next time. I thought the drive thru said the burger comes with lettuce,tomatoes and onions, but I may need wrong. My burger just came with cheese and I think ketchup and mustard. It had some flavor, wasn't dry, but was very average. The funnel fries were hot, slightly spongy, and sweet with powder sugar goodness. This could be dangerous. Luckily it comes in small, but I still mananged to get powdered sugar on my shirt. Lol. I tried some of my friend's Checkers fries and that was a game changer. It had a batter on it and was perfectly fried. Peppery, salty, and crispy. It reminds me of the outside of a good fried chicken only it was in the form of a French fry. This is definitely their winning item on their menu. 

They have an outside seating area, but it didn't look very clean. There were big pigeons all over the place too. Maybe the birds are some sort of cleaning team picking up the scraps and leftovers because those birds were unusually big. Will not be eating out there, but I will come back in the drive thru for the fries alone though.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,8,5,3,7gkr1kyQuXOfKFD5lhwlqQ

Saturday morning, at about 3am, no other cars behind me in the drive thru, only 1 car in front of me. I  waited 10 minutes for them to take my order at the drive thru speaker. I continue to wait for 15 minutes more after placing my order, until I  finally get to the window and the cashier tells me that my order has been ""accidentally"" canceled and if I want to place my order again?!?

Checkers seems to be a well known American fast food chain. But here it starts, at this location nothing, i mean really nothing was fast!
When i entered the restaurant i had a group of four and a couple in front of me. It took unbelievable 30 minutes before i was ask what i want. Oh ok, i wasn't ask, it was looked at me and i figured it now might be the time to order :).

Ok I did that, ordered my food. It took another 15 minutes to get it. Of course not everything was right the first time, so i had to go back and asked for the correct items. Of course, what was I thinking, that when everything was prepared slowly that that would be a sign of accuracy. Stupid me, lol.

OK, the Burger was ok, the boneless chicken wings as well. But nothing special. But all so greasy, with all the time they needed to prepare the food, they don't take the time to let the items that are deep fried rest and get the fat out. Overall I don't think it was worth the wait and the quality was not that good at all. But I have to admit it was a funny time watching the four (!) worker preparing the food. Or whatever they calling this slow moving process. Or did i get it all wrong and it is the first slow fast food chain?",87YceO0nqfZLOUeGg_aEOQ,3,0,2,pgfxHeMclgQy4NZ1_ln29w

Tonight, the ice machine was down in the eat-in side. The manager was telling that there was no more ice even though they were on with selling drinks and combos. We had to ask for ice from the drive-through side. It was just our cashier who was sweet enough to go get the ice for us. Come on! Yes, it's Las Vegas.
