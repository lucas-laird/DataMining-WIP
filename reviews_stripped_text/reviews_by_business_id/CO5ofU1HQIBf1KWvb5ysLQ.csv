Being from the Bay Area, this was my first meal at this chain and I'll definitely be back.  Great burger and the fries were crispy yet tender in the inside.  My wife had the chicken sandwich which was also outstanding.  We split a peppermint shake that was delicious and a great dessert to finish the meal.  Staff was very helpful and friendly and they are off to a great start.  The only improvement I could see was that the bun was little soggy and the lettuce was not crisp.

I like them both well enough and don't have either very often. I managed to hit up this new location when holiday shopping at the outlets, which is an experience that obviously requires stress eating before, during, and after.  Shake Shack to the rescue!

The Shack Stack (regular burger topped with a fried, cheese-filled mushroom cap!) is my go-to, clocking in at about a million calories but tasting sinfully good. This time I added on cheese fries (go big or go home!) and a seasonal shake- peppermint chocolate, as recommended by the cashier. $20 and way too much food (couldn't conquer the shake!), but not a bad indulgence when you only do it a couple times a year.

They do have a lot of options. I got the protein style chicken sandwich, fries with cheese on the side (a good idea to get more cheese), and a small concrete with peanut butter sauce and truffle chocolate chip cookie dough. The chicken sandwich was pretty good - a good thick piece of chicken but it has a thick batter and it's very fried. (Still like Chick-Fil-A's better). The concrete, which is Shake Shack's version of a Blizzard, only had peanut butter sauce on top rather than incorporated throughout. What I LOVED though was their crinkle cut fries with cheese sauce, crispy and substantial. This is definitely a treat yo'self kind of place.",yZFAlk6UdPqzt-k2laVVaQ,0,2,4,XUGY6wR6VtE3xo01XV-z_w

Took a break from the slots to see if this place lived up to all the hype. First, the burger. Had the BBQ bacon double burger and thought it was pretty good. Burger was juicy and cooked well but it wasn't AMAZING. What was pretty darn good were the shakes and custard. Peanut butter shake was nice and smooth and my son was very happy with the chocolate chip shake. My wife ordered the burger with portobello mushroom and that was quite tasty. She also had the frozen custard with the bits of pie which she enjoyed. The crinkle cut fries were excellent. 

Our cashier that took the order was extremely friendly and polite. When he saw me waiting by the end of the counter, he went out of his way to bring me a cup for water. He told us where the cups were but I just didn't get around to picking one up yet as I was waiting for our remote to buzz and notify us our order was ready. Just that extra thoughtfulness impressed me and tells me this location chooses its staff carefully and they care about the customers. I didn't catch his name but you folks left a very positive impression and would recommend your restaurant without hesitation.

Burger is mediocre at best.  I'd have gotten a better tasting burger in a Happy meal. It's the same size.

The  bacon cheese fries were Velveeta.
The only saving grace is that coffee shake won't kill me.

My wife has a chicken bacon sandwich, even that would be better at Mickey D's.  At least her iced tea came from a fountain.

Five Guys is better...

3894702,2018-04-09,0,CO5ofU1HQIBf1KWvb5ysLQ,"Now that Shake Shack has a few locations in Vegas, it seems that the hype has died down just a bit. I've ordered from the Shake Shack located on the strip; this was my first visit to the outlet mall location. It was clean and it was empty (10:30am ish on a Saturday). 

Ordered the shack burger for myself and my bf decided to get a little crazy with the shack burger with the portobello mushroom on top. I honestly think there are far better burgers out there. Today at least, the burgers were so so SALTY! I'm not even a person that is salt aversive. The meat was so overly seasoned it was unbearable. Also, I really didn't like the shack sauce. The sauce made the buns all soggy and it was unappetizing. I SO prefer in n out to Shake shack. My other criticism is for the burger toppings. I GOT A TINY PIECE OF LETTUCE and a miniature slice of tomato. It was so pathetic. Is it really that much to ask for like TWO decent leaves of lettuce, tomatoes and pickles in a basic burger? Ay ay ay. 


My bf also thought the shack burger w the portobello thing was meh. The portobello mushroom is bread crusted and deep fried. The frying was done perfectly and the crisp outer shell provided the crunch and texture so needed in this burger. Beware the inside of the mushroom thing is FILLED with oozing cheese. It was really difficult to eat! 

Overall, the flavor is poor. It was very salty. Fries were good! Nice and crispy and had good fresh taste and not overly seasoned. The burgers are also lacking in toppings. A little more lettuce, a tomato and some pickles to contrast texture is much needed. I won't return to shake shack because really.... it's so much hype and no follow through.",1FEoQIJw2qd2baTlZNRcEg,1,1,2,XJecWZwmJjA_P4fZ5psbMg

4166595,2018-06-22,0,CO5ofU1HQIBf1KWvb5ysLQ,"TL;DR - The Burgers here have good flavor, but In & Out Burgers taste fresher. Eat both and compare for yourself. The Shakes here are delicious. The fries here taste like the Ore Ida frozen crinkle fries. Check this place out if you are on this side of the strip (definitely one of the better places in this area)

I've had Shake Shack on the East Coast and the Las Vegas one tastes the same, definitely a good representation of Shake Shack.

Location: On the strip by New York New York Casino by MGM Park.

Staff: Everyone here has been friendly every time I've come here.

Ambiance: Nice open seating area with multiple sections. A high table that seats a big group that is right in front of a gargantuan screen that is constantly playing sports. A more secluded dinning area, and the remainder of the seating is within sight of the big screen.

Food Review: As everyone compares Shake Shack to In & Out Burger, the only thing I'll say is the ingredients at In & Burger taste fresher, but is more basic, and the flavor of the burgers at Shake Shack are better & more unique.

The ShackBurger is their basic burger and tastes like a regular burger, I would go somewhere else if you are looking for just a basic burger. If you are coming here for a shake and just want a regular burger then the ShackBurger is fine.

The SmokeShack Burger is my favorite burger here. The bacon with the chopped cherry peppers are delicious. I don't think you can go wrong by ordering this burger **Recommend*

At Shake Shack you can order 3 different types of fries - Regular, Just Cheese, Cheese & Bacon, and Fully Loaded.
The base french fries taste like the frozen Ore Ida crinkle cut french fries from the grocery store. Are they bad? No. Are they stand-out? No. Are they basic french fries? Yup.
The Cheese fries are the same as the base fries, but you add some nacho cheese... Like the nacho cheese from the snack shack at a sporting event. That's it.
Bacon & Cheese fries are a step up with enough bacon to elevate their cheese fries to eye brow raising, as in *I see what you are doing here ShakeShack and I approve*.
Fully Loaded Fries take all of that and add some cherry peppers to them and come in a huge mega-froyo style cup. With the peppers, it makes the dish worth ordering. In a perfect world, this would be Shack Shake's base fries.

Shakes, their name sake, and they don't dissapoint. They have standard milk shakes, nothing too over-the-top or frilly, but definately great shakes.
Vanilla is what it seems like - a good vanilla shake.

Peanut Butter Shake is the one I recommend. If you like Peanut Butter, as a flavor, you HAVE to get this shake. 10/10 right here.",vA7CCe20zwkCdzP2VXX7hQ,0,0,3,XIadWlsGHsP7GJ1y5YpuKg

I've tried the cheeseburger, cheese fries, and strawberry milkshake. Wow, the cheeseburger and milkshakes here are BOMB. The burgers themselves are kind of smaller than usual, but they're so flavorful that I think it's the perfect size. I'm a bit disappointed in the fries though, they're more on the soggier, softer side. The milkshake isn't too sweet, and it successfully quenched my inner sweets craving! 

If they had this back home where I live, I'd probably visit a lot for the milkshake...but maybe it's for the better, otherwise I'd be gaining a good 10 pounds! ;)",zckLu2_HoG2UmmQzC52AZw,1,2,4,pCQjfmG5w7Xi2G5zqv9PuA

I had hot dog and cheese fries, they were so good especially cheese fries! good portion and nice location in Outlet malls, Las Vegas. Shake Shack is a must for a quick bite!",kzHed62rYNynOTkfsdpJtw,0,0,4,v4WLQX4xOWeYg_gO8puitw

But the food is just as good as the regular New York New York, Henderson, and downtown Summerlin location. I'm so happy we got to try it out! This just means they're consistent with their food quality.

My friend got the shroomburger & I got the smoke shack. Fries extra crispy (crinkle fries). A chocolate shake and a cookies and cream shake.

We sat outside and it was very nice. Tip: have one person order and the other find a seat because it is packed! Be prepared to share a table with another party.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,6,2,4,aRYJ6XNbk-LiPBZHfJXq2A

The taste is alright but I've had better, at a cheaper price. I don't feel this is a place that I would come to if I was craving a burger. Just my opinion...",DBQ2VacoDM_NYRQBkv2mfg,0,0,2,IDWKzSBBY5H18Uh64sqM-Q
