We had the $18.00 breakfast buffet. It had all the essentials: eggs, bacon, sausage, bagels, toast, fruit, waffles. I would've like a few more options but for the price (in Vegas) it was worth it. I thought everything tasted very good and our server was extremely nice and friendly.

Yes, there are a plethora of food options and buffet choices throughout sin city, but the convenience of the location and freshness of their offerings is a winning combination for anyone staying at the Westin.

Fortunately for me, I had breakfast vouchers given to us by the hotel. The cost otherwise is close to $20, a pricey penny for a buffet. But the offerings are so extensive, it's easy to justify the meal's cost.

Being a vegetarian, and one who has recently gone on a health binge, I appreciated the options I had. I go with the oatmeal daily and load it up with strawberries, granola, raisins, pecans, and brown sugar. If I have more space, and hunger, I try one of their freshly baked muffins, cereal offerings, homestyle potatoes, or yogurt with fruit. 

There's certainly more to the menu,  and the service is spectacular. Each of the servers I've had over the past three days have been so on-point, I always find myself revisiting the checkbook and adding a couple of extra dollars for a better tip. They just take care of you without being obtrusive. I may have waited a few minutes once, but as soon as eye contact was made, service follows instantly.

The restaurant is clean, quiet, and had a nice contemporary feel.  The clientele is also a refreshing step up from the typical loud hungover Vegas crowd.  We were seated immediately and had coffee in hand within 3 minutes.  Our waiter was very attentive, pleasant, and conversant without being overbearing.

Husband enjoyed his Belgian waffle with strawberries and whipped cream, where I had a pretty good eggs Benedict.  Not the best I've had, but far from the worst.  The waiter even ran to the bar on the casino floor to get us a Bloody Mary and mimosa, as the restaurant does not have their own associated bar.

I understand it sounds outrageous. I told a hostess at Suede they were the best wings anywhere.   She told me another guest that morning had told her the exact same thing.  That is too much of a coincidence for it to not be true! 

Why are they the best anywhere?  

Perfect crispiness.  Not too greasy.  Not slimy.
Not too salty.
Great taste.

Oh yeah.  Their breakfast buffet is also fantastic.  

The best scrambled eggs I have had anywhere.

When I saw it was chilly and raining, and realizing I hadn't brought a sweater, jacket, nor an umbrella, I decided to enjoy the breakfast buffet at the hotel.  And that I did.

Ironically enough, it was also the day of the Open Window for flight attendant trip trades, so I wanted to make sure I was right at my computer during that time, so I didn't want to stray far.  Trip Trade open window is not dissimilar from the NFL draft (which also occured that day!).....everyone all at once aims to get the best possible trips for their schedule the following month.  (Breakfast aside, in case you were wondering, I am pleased with my May schedule, although I could use another one of these Vegas layovers soon.)

Where was I?  Yes, breakfast.  That's right.  Good variety and well-made delights.  I especially loved the eggs benedict and the breakfast potatoes, which I covered in hot sauce, and mixed with my eggs and bacon.  

Fresh Greek yogurt.  Ample fruit.  Bottomless coffee.  And a large glass of grapefruit juice.

Definitely worth your money.  And guess what?  I won the cost of breakfast back in the slots here at the hotel.  Even better!

As for dinner, well- in their favor you can order something other then a traditional fine-dining main course.  I had a rueben sandwich that was competently executed but not inspired.

The service here was kind of creepy and overbearing.  I know middle age men can be fine waiters, and attentive service is a plus, but it was a little bit unusual for my wife and I to have the same thought about one of our waiters: i.e. that he was going to strangle us in our room later on during our stay.

Better yet, forget the creamy crap and request oil and balsamic vinegar. They have that option here and I was able to control the dressing amount by pouring my own.

We ordered a bottle of red wine, calamari & chicken lettuce wraps for appetizers, Ahi Tuna / Salmon / 2 Steaks for entrees, and Proliferoles for dessert.  The Calamari appetizer was very good complemented with tartar sauce and marinara sauce.  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were pretty good, but nothing too amazing and the chicken was a bit heavy to me.  As for the entrees, I tried both the Ahi Tuna and Salmon, which were both great dishes that came with rice and side vegetables.  The Proliferoles were okay.. the cream puffs weren't soft enough, but the dessert was still pretty tasty.

First up was the asparagus appetizer which was very good. Asparagus was cooked perfectly, not bitter and had the perfect amount of balsamic glaze. Cherry tomatoes and olives were a nice touch. This app is good for up to two people to share.

I ordered the omelette florentine without cheese and substituted the house potatoes for sliced potatoes.  Omelette was cooked to order and I'd happily order this again.

I worked out really hard that morning, this includes running up hill (4-8 incline) for 20 mins.............. climbed 30 flights of stairs.......  so that I could go to this breakfast buffet :)  and taking a nap later.

This buffet had everything you would look for in a breakfast buffet.
I had to mention one thing..... the pork sausages ... were BIG... and were JUICY... and one word that would describe it: PORKY   ... after taking one bite, it made me wonder ""is it so soft and porky because it has a lot of fat?  or a lot of good quality pork meat???""  To this day I still don't know.  

and my plan was perfect just as I expected, I took a nap for 2 hrs.

Well, she hadn't noticed that it came with a side, so it took her a while to decide and then she finally just said the sea salt fries (yes, I know, she WAS going for the ""healthy"" option until she ordered those fries)! I ordered a hamburger and salad. 

Why this meal earned a four versus five was my meal. The veggie wrap was fantastic, (my wife just wishes that she would have ordered the fruit rather than the fries), nothing wrong with the fries though. However, my hamburger was no better than McDonald's, and his salad was super oily. 

We would definitely order the veggie wrap again though. Very tasty and the balsamic vinegar was yummy.",diYbASjeqV4CxkoyeBeBGw,1,1,4,CR4EeXdXa4AJtRZqphj5Lw

So I was alone for most of the day last Friday while I waited for my friends to arrive in Vegas.

I was hungry before my spa appointment so I decided to have a light lunch at Suede which is located in our hotel.

The menu is pretty tempting and has a lot of varieties.  I decided to have a burger WITH a fruit salad. 

My server, Alex, never brought me bread.  Another server was kind enough to bring me bread so I wouldn't pass out from being so hungry.

I waited a long time for my food.  Alex only attended the table with 3 people.  I guess since I was alone, I was being discriminated against.  He never bothered checking on me to see if everything is going okay. 

The other server (not my server) brought me bread and checked on me a few times.  What happened to MY server?

My fruit salad didn't come with my burger.  Instead I was greeted with fries.  That's not what I ordered.  Finally I waved down Alex to bring me so fruit salad... and he never did. He totally forgot or simply didn't care.  I really resent that.

The other server...came to check on me one more time... so I explained the fruit salad situation and he brought it for me.  

HOW HARD IS IT TO BE A SERVER? You write things down then you bring it to people.  I was irkd.


So finally after all that fiasco... I really wanted to talk to the manager but he checked on EVERY OTHER TABLE except me.  Is it that much a faux pas to eat alone?  So I was frustrated with my dining experience here but I do have to mention one of the perks of eating here is that they bring you the world's SMALLEST tobasco, which I promptly snatched and kidnapped to bring back home.",irNQNBpwz1ee3hY4oLhyEw,2,0,3,VAbgvrcNpQC7hKZ0XItjPw

Hungry for a delicious breakfast I gave this place a try after my workout. How wrong was I when I decided to order the spinach omelette. The menu described it with heirloom tomatoes. When the server dropped my food I looked him in the eye and asked ""Is this the heirloom tomato?"" to which he lied to my face and saying yes. I work in a fine dining restaurant in Los Angeles and I know the difference among tomatoes. When I went to the register to pay for my meal the chef who was on the poster for the restaurant was there. The cashier asked me ""Was everything ok?"" to which I replied ""not really!"" and she followed ""what was wrong?"" I explained about what happened and the chef heard and approached me without apologizing saying "" But that's the tomato we have."" Well, this is not customer service nor any kind of recovery at all. But how about at least telling your servers here are the changes on the menu TODAY! Btw the food was blend and boring.",82kcxuQnmIP79s7_0iLTcw,1,0,1,IO5be4_fgE-FmWd-QKX_8Q

We were sat immediately and our drink order was taken - a carafe of coffee for the table and water. I ordered the Pesto Chicken Panini - served with grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, and fontina cheese. DELICIOUS! It was rich, but super satisfying. My honey got the Cobb salad and it was huge! I was impressed with the tasty blue cheese wedge it was served with. 

I'm glad we were able to try Suede for its good food & convenience. Good stuff!
