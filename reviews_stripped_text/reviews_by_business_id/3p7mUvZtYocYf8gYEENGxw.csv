Favorite thing here so far is the burekas- I get the cheese but potato and pizza flavors are also available. They have pizzas, soups, and salads, along with more specialty items like sambusak, ceviche, shakshuka, and khachapuri.

3593209,2015-09-14,0,3p7mUvZtYocYf8gYEENGxw,"I tried S and J three times before writing this review. I wanted to give them a fair chance. I'll use bullet point to expedite the process. 

-1st time ordered Pizza with onion and mushrooms. Asked for it well done. The result was a less than normally done pizza. Wouldn't have been a problem if I had an oven at my office but no dice. Decent flavor, but a super limp pizza is a no go for me. 3/5

-2nd time went during normal business hours and they were closed. The adjacent door to the kitchen was open, so I harkened hello.. nice gentleman explained that they are closed at the time but I can go no next door to their sandwich shop (no sign or distinguishing marked) and order a sandwich. Proceed to sandwich shop. The interior was very informal with no indication of what they serve or menu. I actually felt like I was in the middle east and I am ok with that. Two guys behind a metal work station. Very nice people again, asked me what I would like. I told them just make the best sandwich you have. I received about a 8 inch sub with 2 slices of turkey and 2 slices of bologna, which some standard vegetables on top and a unidentifiable spread. They served it as a pressed sandwich, very pressed. 12.99 with a drink, which you could not opt out of the drink, $15 or so out the door with tax and tip. No chips or sides included. 2/5

-3rd time just ordered a Caesar Salad, with an anchovy (not included) on the side. The dressing was outstanding for a not made at table side authentic dressing. Tons of garlic which I love. I guess they can't use parmesan cheese so they substitute it with feta which I was ok with that. My main problem with the salad is that the lettuce was shredded, like McDonald Big Mac shredded and very limp, like a couple of days old limp. 2/5

Side notes:

Main restaurant seating and decoration is outstanding. Too bad there was not a single person there at any of the 3 times I visited. 

Staff and what I believe to be one or two of the owners were super friendly. Props. 

They need to change the signage on the storefront. It suggests that they are open 24 hrs. They are not. They are not even open sometimes during their regular business hours posted on yelp. 

Final thought. I am not fully sure what Kosher is all about, but I surmise that it is a ploy by the Jews to rake in more money for a mediocre product.",bjcKhXmbSJISNMe_6CYhcw,2,0,3,ue6_PiXvVF1KQgORzBN5-w

4946336,2017-06-09,1,3p7mUvZtYocYf8gYEENGxw,"THE WORST PIZZA AND CUSTOMER SERVICE! 
I dont know where to start. I went to Vegas for exhibition. 2 days in row, we haven't got any decent kosher food. So, I saw this one, its said that it's the best pizza. So I was thinking, what could go wrong with pizza. Its just margerita pizza. I'm feeding 7 people (5 men and 2 women).

So, I ordered 2 pies. It said that they do delivery, but you have to call them again to confirm. They dont! Its through postmate and grubhub only. 

It took 45-50mins for delivery, so its decent amount of time. I opened the pizza. 
No napkins, no parmesan, no condiments, no chilli flakes. NOTHING. So I called, to let them know, and I asked for what I supposed to get. She said, I have to request it. 

So stingy with condiments and napkins, I got pissed. She made bad joke about it ""do you want me to give you money back for napkins? Im sorry, being the best pizza has nothing to do with napkins *giggles""... 

And theeeeen... I tried the pizza. The gave us old hardass pizza i've ever had in my life. I put it on video. I've had bad pizza, but this is the worst. 

They gave us 2 pies, 1 old 1 new, the new 1 was okay. At least its warm. The old 1, dry, cool, dried out cheese, flattened pie and hard to bite. Not edible for human. If you wanna cheat your customer, at least give us 2 bad pizzas so we wont tell the difference.

Then I said,, FUCK YOU. I dont curse alot and I have huge tolerance and this one is beyond stupid. 

Im sorry, they did not deserve a fuck you. They deserves my colleagues prayers, prays that this place to close soon for being cheap, cheat and horrible customer service. Maybe you should just open resto in a zoo, i dont think your product and service is for human.",EfJRh4SNE-XI9vUySLVTjA,0,1,1,h6cYi5b8lOGWDYLee7bi3Q

I got the cheese boat which was pretty good but they failed to tell me about the added charges. They charged me $1.50 for, literally, three leaves of spinach. Seriously.

To make it worse, a nut came into the restaurant, threatened to shoot it up, was cussing at me and my husband, and even when I told the employee, they still didn't ask him to leave. We literally felt threatened and not at all safe! We even called the police and they didn't even show! When the owner finally threw him out, we got a half-hearted apology and charged full price for the crappy food!

It was very scary and ruined our first night in Vegas. We would never go back there just based on the food but the reaction of the owner to a possibly dangerous situation sealed the deal.
