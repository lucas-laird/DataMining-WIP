Others have commented on location....honestly the best food I have ever had is typically in the worst area or primitive location in the world. I expected a place like this who only serves breakfast and lunch that breakfast should be ...well ....on point. 

Everything was going great....until I saw the country gravy was NOT homemade....cardinal sin. What true American diner prides itself in instant gravy?  My little ones waffle was beautiful. Omelets were a little overdone but acceptable.

Manager took forever to come over & then told me well i ordered what i ordered so it doesn't matter. all i wanted to do was exchange my food for something else. & that was impossible.

The prices are very high for what you receive & who ever heard of a restaurant where you can't substitute items. No other options just what side the menu says. Being someone who doesn't eat fries paying $10 -$15 a plate makes no sense. I could understand no substitutions on specials but not the whole menu.

After looking through the menu I decided on the Chef's Special of 2 eggs, 2 French toast wedges and choice of ham, 2 bacon strips or 2 sausage links.  The bacon (the candy of meats) and eggs were cooked to perfection.  The star of the meal was the French toast so sweet, buttery and tasted just like happiness. I think 2 pieces were just enough as the French toast entree comes with 6 pieces.  Portion sizes are great and prices reasonable.

Servers sucks so much, i usually never complain but i cant hold it in anymore.

1. They charged me wrongly and they didn't even want to give me a refund. Let me add that they never gave me the refund. The glasses girl said, we cant do a refund. Im like well you calculated wrong, its not my problem to fix. Its yours! 
2. I had to ask for lemons about 3 times 
3. They didnt notify us that they didnt have cucumbers for one of the salads. Which is the only reason my friend ordered the god dam salad. 
4. We just had to continually ask for the same thing to remind our colored eye server. 
5. It wasn't even busy. At most they had about 20-25 people. Honestly thats easy enough to handle especially with 2 servers. 


Theres a lady who has glasses, and another one who has colored eyes. Both need to get fired! Im a server as well and I've never experienced such bad serves.

Kind of cool too seeing actual food in the glass case as you first come in. The staff is friendly.
