The food here is pretty good, but, like the ""homemade"" okra, the ""catfish"" isn't catfish, either; it's Swai. Not a bad place to eat, though, in the long run.",bhxukS4FL8UbEPeGLH6cPg,0,0,3,IoHLtFhZgPy2dVsonNLgeA

But I will say the guy that cooks at night (or at least the night I went) made the burger a lot better than the guy that worked during lunch :/",Uo8J2v31xMfVtDzlYLZ7aw,0,0,5,XICzXdbcNZJ1aUzmzRqvkg

The people are so nice - I sent my husband in there to get take out, and I made him ask them way too many questions. Since he's from Chicago, he didn't understand most of them, but the owner hooked us up, 'cause he understood me juuuuust fine! You MUST try the okra - these are not from some bag of pre-breaded frozen okra. This is homemade, extra seasoned (I taste Lawry's salt), and so crunchy, it withstood a car ride home. They also do a sweet potato ball / nugget thing that is so tasty it could be desert, but don't you dare think you can survive without the chocolate cake! This can only be made by the hands of angels... or grandmothers. I won't do the injustice of describing what can only be experienced, but try it. 

In fact, try everything. These people know their way around a kitchen. My only request is that they get some cream gravy for their chicken fingers. 

Y'all know what I'm talking about!!!",fZR7spauUm_S8tZQrgFYiA,3,0,5,S-jfSQNNjU_g3NQJUgXrEg
1337996,2014-02-23,0,XUXczemir5J6L72pd2LLTQ,Heres my tip...dont order the philly sandwich.  The ratio of chicken filling to the bread was like 10% and the bread 90%  and they should be ashamed to even call it a philly cause they used cheddar sliced cheese.,kga8h3ThNeGdeiWTm2Valg,1,0,1,Dzc26csjyhjaSLxRU8f_6w

1737365,2014-01-25,0,XUXczemir5J6L72pd2LLTQ,Just had lunch.  Ordered the hamburger wrap and fries...awesome!! The wrap reminded me of a big mac in a wrap and the fries were seasoned just like five guys.  All for six dollars....definitely will check it out again if I'm in the area.,0YrC_H_8WrfulHJbeKqrNw,2,0,5,OEm0lgYOOMOIZPyf3LEMBA

2356922,2012-04-27,4,XUXczemir5J6L72pd2LLTQ,"Their slogan is ""Where Great Food Meets Great Atmosphere.""  Well...  they are half right.  The food is great!  The atmosphere didn't appeal to me.  If you fancy strip malls where Honda Civics pull up, pop the trunk , and sell you everythign from handbags and perfume to a new car radio... then you might enjoy hanging out.  Me?  I got my food to go.

The place features burgers, chicken, and some soul food.  They do a steady business as it seems every employee in the strip mall gets their lunch here.  I can't blame them.  My burger was very good.  The sesame bun was toasted to perfection, the beef tasty, and a big mmmmmmmm.  I love a good burger!  And this is one to try!   The burger comes with freshly fried chips with Ranch, BBQ, or Cajun seasoning.  They are great.  

The cashier was attractive, friendly, fun, and even a bit sassy.  She is PERFECT for this place.  She recommended the Onion Rings also.  She was right.  Delicious.  The batter was thick but the rings cooked perfectly and easily devoured.  

If you are looking for a great burger and sides to go this place is an excellent choice.  Their offerings include an array of chicken and catfish.  All looked good!",qBVFHqJlMn50amD-67wTjQ,8,4,4,5K5Od5vtd73WZ4tNYDBtEw

4262215,2014-06-21,1,XUXczemir5J6L72pd2LLTQ,"I was excited to try this place after the reviews of the delicious burgers. I purchased 3 groupons for $10 worth of food for $5. First time I went I ordered burger and buffalo chicken wraps. Overall, it was tasty and reasonably priced. I went there a couple of days ago and ordered fried catfish (which was the special of the day) and sauteed shrimp po boys and a side of fries. The shrimp po boy was ok. The shrimp didn't have a ton of flavor. I noticed that my fries were much darker this time, almost black. They tasted bitter. The catfish tasted bitter as well. Everything had this acrid, bitter taste, almost like it was fried in dirty oil. I pretty much had to throw everything out, which I never do. I was glad I didn't get my shrimp po boy fried. I'm pretty sure they would have had the same bitter taste. Very disapppointing. It out of my way, won't be back.",jClTjIP3oIuehjbW5I3saQ,2,0,2,-ke5Aoh9n8A11En_abIcOg

4800949,2014-06-07,0,XUXczemir5J6L72pd2LLTQ,"They messed up my order: I ordered the El Camino and asked that they substitute ground turkey for the beef.  Instead of the El Camino I vot the Impalla. I was a little disappointed, especially since I didn't discover the mistake until I got home.  The sides, particularly the onion rings and the well-done fries were absolutely yum! I will give the place another chance to redeem themselves,  If you are in the mlld for a moist, grilled chicken breast, the Impalla is a good bet. if you're doing take out, recommend you double check your order before driving away.",RoGaXxE7ayV4j_kbebRjCw,1,0,2,xAMq6ScA3aeAbNMcyx5Tew
