45479,2011-10-17,0,2dUXkonsAdoXKAalTnmlig,"I found this place on yelp and since it received good reviews decided to try it out. 

Right when you walk in you see the cash register and the bright yellow menu to your right. About 20 seats and 6 tables, a salad bar like Roberto's. 

The menu is a lot like Roberto's but a few items that are different. They serve breakfast, so hey all you breakfast people here's a place to try. Now down to the food...I ordered the chimichanga which is a deep fried burrito. It was delicious! It wasn't watery like some other places because of the grease or meat. When I cut it in half no grease or water was filling my plate so that's a plus. 

I would totally come back to this place since I want to try the churros and some other things on the menu.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,3,1,4,oOrHdChpszW7RsbmhZqrqA

1534373,2015-02-23,0,2dUXkonsAdoXKAalTnmlig,"Went to Dimas Tacos with the boyfriend 'cause he saw decent food reviews for the place. 
This place looks sketchy - plainly decorated, yet it wasn't dirty. As customers, we couldn't tell if they were closed until we saw someone in the kitchen area. Another person came in later in the night, and they couldn't tell as well. 
Customer service wasn't horrible, but it wasn't spectacular either. The chef/cashier somewhat looked like it was an inconvenience to come into the restaurant. 
The food was good though. The boyfriend said he had a couple chicken bones in his enchiladas, and my steak for the carne asada tacos were a little overcooked, but it was still yummy. Good guacamole.

2292195,2015-01-29,0,2dUXkonsAdoXKAalTnmlig,"I had been craving authentic tacos for awhile and decided to give this place a try since my salon is right next door.  First, I guess I should have read the reviews first because it is very similar to Robertos which is not what I wanted.  I ordered the asada taco, the carnitas taco and a pastor taco and an horchata.   The horchata was like drinking water and sugar, very little flavor.  The Carne asada and carnitas tacos were ok, but the pastor taco was not that good.  I would recommend if you want robertos but if you are looking for authentic tacos...nope not it",Sd9FKiHoAoG1d700D1GMFA,0,0,3,ZSTAnNWrqeBFn0uNqKFyyQ

The mini tacos come with onions and cilantro but i like to add sour cream to it. At this visit I ordered 3 mini carne asada tacos, a carne asada taco, and a california burrito(carne asada, french fries, and pico). The steak was not the best quality, not as tender as it usually is, the meat was pretty tough to chew but i was extremely hungry so I roughed it through. As for my sides i usually get limes, salsa verde, jalapeños, and i pass on the carrots as they're usually extremely soft and hardly ever spicy. This visit was very different and i pleased the jalapeños were SPICY and the carrots were hard just the way I like them. The salsa usually has the kick but today they backed off on the spice which made me pretty sad but still pleased.

3517946,2015-04-27,24,2dUXkonsAdoXKAalTnmlig,"About 15 years ago I would stop in here to grab breakfast before heading to work a couple times a week. I have noticed for sometime now that Dima's Tacos is still in business, so I made a point to come in for breakfast to see if it was like I had remembered. Inside is small with only maybe 4 or 5 tables. The woman who took my order was nice and gave me time to look over the menu. She also told me that they were not the original owners of Dima's and that it has changed hands over the years. Her and her husband recently started a lease, so anybody familiar with Dima's Tacos before might notice a difference in the menu and prices. Since it had been so long since my last visit, I just hoped for good food. The prices are fair depending on what you order. Some menu items are made fresh and other stuff isn't. My total was around $11.

Agua Fresca - This wasn't made fresh and came from a fountain machine. It also tasted watered down. 

Cheese Quesadilla - Good size and really the only thing I enjoyed. It's kind of hard to mess up a cheese quesadilla.

Bacon Breakfast Burrito - I knew it was not going to be like I remembered Dima's being all those years ago, but wow it really wasn't the same! The burritos used to be really big (double wrapped) and now they are long and skinny. I don'y mind since they use really big tortillas and it still ends up being a decent size. The scrambled eggs were not mixed all the way before being made, so I ended up with a white and yellow scramble, not good. There was only 2 or 3 small pieces of potato in the center and that's it. The burrito could have definitely used more potato. I also paid for extra cheese to be added and there was none at all. The bacon tasted good, but was hard at times.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,33,32,2,ZYsskVNP-0_i5OKha9sXLw

3834043,2011-04-07,1,2dUXkonsAdoXKAalTnmlig,"So last night after a few brews at Santa Fe Mining Company I decided to check out Dimas Tacos. It is in the next parking/building area and I have of course seen it a few times but never seemed busy so I was unsure if I should try it. Well Last night buzzed hunger overcame and I did. 

I ordered the Lengua (tongue - usually cows tongue) Tacos and the Tacos Al Pastor (shepherd's-style tacos) made of pork, were both very good. Tons of meat and nice refreshing Pico De Gallo (rooster's beak) which some also call Salsa Fresca. They were both hot fresh and mouthwateringly delicious. Of course could be that I was tipsy LOL but they really were Nom Nom Nommy. 

I also ordered some Churros (a long, slender, deep-fried pastry coated with sugar and cinnamon) they were very yummy, hot and fresh.

I talked to another customer there (who turned out to be a Sin City Roller Girl - Props to her) and she said she has come a few times.

I would also like to note that the place was really clean, a easy menu consisting of names with pictures for us tipsy folks ;p

I will definitely be going back :)",8-OX2_HEYDbArnMSDyJe5g,3,1,4,JkAO3uciQXy7RX9Xae04Rg

4147090,2014-11-19,0,2dUXkonsAdoXKAalTnmlig,"Sorry Roberto's but there is a new taco shop in my life.  Dimas is close to home for me.  I have been in a couple of times now and it is never as busy as Roberto's.  I think it is because people don't really know where it is.  I drove right by the first time I stopped in.  I had to make a u-turn and come back around.  Service has been good each of the times I have eaten here.  And the food has always come up quick.  I have been getting my same order each time.  Two chicken tacos and one order of three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese.  It is the same order I get when I go to Roberto's.  In fact, this place has a menu that looks very much like Roberto's.  It is like they are sister restaurants.  The pictures, the prices, the style of food.  It is all the same.  But there is always one prettier sister.  That is Dimas for one specific reason in my book.  They offer the chicken tacos at $0.99 all day every day.  Roberto's only has that special on Wednesday.

4228053,2011-08-28,0,2dUXkonsAdoXKAalTnmlig,I have been here a few times. I think this place is definitely better than the other common Mexican family chain taco places. I had the shrimp burrito. At first I was kinda iffy ordering shrimp. In the end it was worth the risk. It was the perfect amount of spiciness where it makes you sweat a little but you cant stop eating it. My friends dad got the mole chicken and he swears it was just as good as his ex wife's. I know of several other people that live in the area that also rave about this place. They have dinning tables but its more of a order your food to go place. They cook the food fresh so it will still be piping hot when you get home.,1FzJO4XnvDemgJuriOvF3w,2,0,4,7ygtpgUKy3fbXrYnt-hOkw

Well let me say I did not really find that here I did notice a sign after ordering and sitting that they have mini tacos but that was after. My boyfriend got rolled tacos with shredded beef and cheese and he said they were good but not great it seemed like a lot of tortilla and not a lot of meat in them. I got the carne asada plate that comes with rice, beans, lettuce, pico, and guac. Not to impressed that carne asada seems like it is just seasoned with pepper not a marinade and it was a little dry. The rice didn't have much flavor and the beans were good also the guacamole was good. Once I put it all in the tortilla I had to add the red sauce to give it some flavor and also wetness so it wasn't to dry. The guy at the front was awesome he gave us time to look at the menu and answered all my questions very helpful and pleasant. I wouldn't go out of my way to drive down here just to eat here if I happen to be in the neighborhood and about to pass out from lack of food then I would stop here.

As I sit here at Dimas I'm reminded of the first time I entered the  clean glass doors of this establishment. I was greeted with a smile and a hello. I didn't feel rushed like most places that employ teenagers who don't have a clue about customer service. Instead, I had the privilege  of having one of the owners ( Jennifer ) take my order. Angel, the other owner, manned the grill with the authority of a seasoned chef that he is. 
The food was prepared quickly and was absolutely delicious. I didn't realize how much I missed my mothers cooking till I savored my meal. From the fresh ingredients to the atmosphere I'm totally sold in this place. Robertos better watch out because I see a Dimas Tacos takeover in the future.
