599177,2016-07-21,0,XTtNTWH_Nqv27RC7OtS7dQ,"From a Celiac:

** I never like to complain about service, but since this was so horrific- at a STEVE WYNN property, AND the food was bad, I have to mention it.

I was SO excited about trying this place because of reading the great story in the Wynn magazine about the new chef bringing fresh new flavors. We had always joked about the previous restaurant- Boterrible. It was Boterro, but we had to rename it because the food was so bad. The new renovation is beautiful, with fresh flowers, lighter colors, same amazing location. That is the extent of the redeeming qualities.

The Menu:
Wynn restaurant pretty much all have allergen menus. Not this place. In fact, our stupid waitress didn't even know what gluten was. (I should've gotten up and left, since I was still recovering from unknowingly being served gluten at Allegro two weeks ago) I digress...

Wine:
Wine? Where... where is it? Oh, the server took a lap around the property and 30 minutes later she brought the bottle. Didn't know how to open it. Then never poured one more drop for the whole meal. This is one of my boyfriends biggest pet peeves. He wants the server to pour the wine. 

Appetizers:
After asking a few questions, having the dumb server return from the kitchen a few times and  STILL not knowing what she was doing, we finally got appetizers, cold and wrong, but at least the boyfriend got some bread, with no butter, to eat with his self poured wine. 

There was literally not one dish on the menu that looked appetizing to either of us. I just ordered sides- gross. Boyfriend orders a steak, which was not cooked correctly. 

Dessert:
Really bland, had no distinguishable flavors. Server leaves for the night.

Waiting......


Waiting.....


Last ones in the restaurant. We didn't mind because we both enjoy each others company, so we were in no hurry. Manager comes over and firmly tells us that we need to leave because the restaurant is closed. I interrupt and couldn't help but snapping at her that we hadn't even received a bill yet. It wasn't even that late, yet the manager chose to be SO unprofessional to ask us to leave. And we hadn't even been given a bill yet. I was FUROUS by this point. I try not to get mad at dinner, but all combined with this rudeness was inexcusable. All the servers and managers were dumb, lazy, ignorant of the menu, didn't know what gluten was, couldn't open a wine bottle, didn't know how to pour a wine bottle. When 2 people spend $500 on a meal and then have to complain about service, that is a MAJOR problem. 

Boyfriend and I come to Vegas often and going to awesome dinners is the highlight. He let me choose this place because I'd been going on and on about it for weeks, wanting to try it. Not only do I not want him to have a bad time at dinner, I want him to keep letting me pick new restaurants! This was a major blemish on my restaurant selection track record. 

Other reviews on Open Table also talked mainly about poor service. Didn't really see it here on Yelp though.

We stay at Encore sometimes 2-3 times a month. It's nice to eat at the property sometimes, but I will never go back to this disaster. Not even to order a to-go order to eat at the pool.",CIrNEyR640XX9w2Pp9dA3w,5,0,1,Row-w9dHmUPOC9Ifp1SPMQ

The place was very nice. Server was very enthusiastic and friendly. We only ordered entrees, which took around 45 minutes to arrive!

Unfortunately, once the food got there, it was ordinary at best. My steak (Rib Eye) was ok - but it was $45 for what would have been a $20 steak elsewhere.

Other people with me had the Fried Chicken (overcooked, not much flavour), the Organic Salmon (overcooked) and Turkey Burger (dry, not much flavour).

1200161,2016-01-27,1,XTtNTWH_Nqv27RC7OtS7dQ,"Jardin recently opened at Encore, having replaced Botero and Society Cafe. The cuisine is essential Society Cafe, but more elegant and less casual, but in all honesty, everything at Wynn/Encore isn't casual. If you remember Society Cafe, you'll notice the plate ware and flatware are the same! (Save where you can right? :P) The food was all amazing, as was expected. The service was lacking just a smidgen but that could've been because our waitress was training someone else. The only hiccup was that she mistakenly switched our crab legs for another crab dish, and by the time the crab legs were ready, the rest of the meal came out. 

For cocktails, they have a full bar of course but also a Mule Cart going around the restaurant making Moscow Mules and their mixed mules were amazing. We ordered the orange and it was great! We ended up ordering another each time he came around! If you have a big party, he can make a big one that services 16! For appetizers we had a flatbread which was basically an entire pizza. We expected a small rectangular size with maybe 4 small pieces total, but this was a full on pizza. But delicious nonetheless. As I said, we also got the King Crab legs. However, these weren't the same as you'd find in the buffet. My photo will show it's 2 tiny pieces already taken out of the legs. It was delicious but not expected. For our entrees, we ordered the oven baked prawns, which came on a bed of rice. There were about 6 prawns, decent size and deliciously seasoned. The rice was a bit al dente for me. We also ordered the short rib ravioli which was apparently great. However, you get like 5 raviolis. We had to get a side order of the oven baked mac and cheese which was a huge side order but delicious. And of course, what we were so excited to try was the potted planter chocolate cake. Everything is edible. You break open the pot and there you'll find the most decadent, non-overwhelming cake with dark chocolate mousse. A must try! But not just for one. We were 2 people and we couldn't finish it. Overall an 8/10 based on price vs. quantity ratio.

We moved our Xmas family dinner from 6:00  to 4:00 so we could have an earlier dinner and watch the football game.  When we arrived at 4 we were given a limited menu and told that we could not have a steak or the prime rib Xmas special but only a limited lunch menu.  They said we would have to come back in an hour if we wanted dinner (after we already had drinks and tried to order). We were annoyed but agreed to do that so we could have a real dinner.  We went to the front to insure we could have a table in an hour and we were told they were fully booked and we would not be able to get a table tonight.  Such BS and what a poor way to treat guests of Encore who stay here every year.  We were told they were booked solid the rest of the night, you would think if someone was calling to change their dinner reservation up they would tell you you can't have dinner at that time slot.   The girl at the front was extremely rude.  Well we decided to stay and sit for an hour and stair at each other since it was impossible to get a reservation anywhere in Xmas day. 

The dinner was outstanding, pricey but you get what you pay for.  The prime rib was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes that accompanied them were superb as well.   The lobster pasta was decadent and the truffle pizza appetizer with the poached egg was to die for.  Our server Roger was outstanding as well.  However because of the rude service and seemingly unorganized front end we will probably never dine here again.  Additionally the tables around us were never seated and for the most part the restaurant was less then half the entire time we were there.  They could have sat us an hour later with no problem.

If you're dining in Las Vegas, you would be absolutely amiss to skip on experiencing Jardin at the Wynn/Encore. Experience it you must!

My Love and I have been here twice in the past month for the fine cuisine and expertise of Jardin Executive Chef Joe Zanelli. We are quite the foodies and tend to be particular about dining out (especially on the Las Vegas Strip.) These two experiences at Jardin were THE.BEST.FINE.DINING.EXPERIENCE. OF. OUR. LIVES. Truly, truly, truly. 

Let me tell you more...

We were greeted at the restaurant entrance by name, which was a 5-star touch on it's own.

The food. I don't even have enough time to write about the spectacular array we feasted upon. Just try what speaks to your appetite! For dessert, you cannot skip that pot of chocolate cake; it's culinary divinity.  

The service is next-level. If you want the best of the best, you must DEMAND Chuck be your server. Chuck at Jardin is the epitome of fine dining service and boy, does he set the bar high. Ask for him specifically and you'll see what I mean. The rest of the wait staff attended to our table like a well-orchestrated symphony. 

The atmosphere is ideal for fine dining. The sound level is perfection; I loved that I couldn't hear anyone else's conversation. Jardin (translated to garden) is beautifully garden-themed, from a giant floral centerpiece in the dining room, to edible flower garnishes in the cocktails, to an edible flower pot dessert (again, a MUST-TRY) and the luxe flower garden and pool in the outside courtyard. 

If you have an appreciation for all the aforementioned, definitely experience the gastro magic at Jardin.",x5YXLJzIZQIndKQYoXLLvA,2,1,5,tpgvwqKftcs41kmm52GJcw

The pain and discomfort didn't go away; I called the manager hours later lunch explained what happened he's said he has to call security to file report. Manager didn't ask what we ate and didn't offer to take off the bill.
Security came to the room and file report and that's it. I checked out on 10/19/17 and had to pay for Jardin restaurant which we got sick from.
I was very surprised that five star hotel and restaurant have these standards and don't take care of their customers. The only thing manager called and said that they did investigation and nothing was wrong with fish. Sounded like they didn't believe us that we got sick from eating their food.

1883009,2017-01-26,0,XTtNTWH_Nqv27RC7OtS7dQ,"So for being in one of my favorite hotels the experience my friends and I had at this restaurant was horrendous. So lets start off with our reservations. We were a large party and had a reservation on Saturday night at 8:30 for 11 of us. They told us that if we were late or did not show up we would be incurred a charge of $50 dollars per person. We got there early and were not even seated until at least 45minutes past our reservation time.  We inquired about the wait twice, the first time we were told that they were still waiting for one of the tables to leave.  The second time they told us that they were going to relocate the current table to another table.  Once we got inside I was a little confused because the restaurant was not busy.  It wasn't even half full so I don't understand why it took so long for us to get seated.

Then, we finally get seated and the waiter takes our drink orders.  They had a moscow mule cart and about half of us ordered one.  It was delicious and we all enjoyed it.  It was also really cute and a good way for us to get our drinks right at the table.  

About fifteen minutes later we noticed that the tables around us all had warm pretzels/bread sticks.  We had to flag down a busser to inquire about it and they were the ones that brought some out to us.  That was strange, I thought the waiter was supposed to do that.

One of us ordered a soup and salad at their dinner, the salad arrived about 30 minutes after ordering.  However, it was over and hour later by the time we all got our food.  When we did get our food we received two salmon steaks that were completely raw in the center and a steak that was ordered medium well but came out raw.  The rest of the food was pretty good.  I had the fried chicken but my side dishes were cold.  I did not want to send my food back because I was so hungry and did not want to wait another hour before getting my food.  The other half of us that got hot food, really enjoyed their meal.  However, I was so hungry that I got full waiting for my food.  I hate blaming the server because he does not control the kitchen.  He was actually pretty nice and accommodating.  Meanwhile there was a table near us who arrived at least thirty minutes after us, they got their food before we did.

I think that this was the longest dinner that I have ever had.  We were so tired and over it by the time dinner was over.  Finally, we pay our bill and after we get our change/cards back we ask to speak to the manager. We were being polite and told him what happened. That was a waste of time because all that he said was, ""Thanks for the feedback"" and walked away.  That was completely rude and he did not care one bit.  I do not think that I will  return to this restaurant.  This is pretty high on my list for some of the worst service I've ever had.",Cfiu-ADmOEkSNT8SEbwF7A,0,0,1,ZHZCjl9nd1cbILXrMLwdHg

I love dining out at restaurants that can offer both a stunning ambience and vegetarian options that branch out beyond pasta dishes (*le sigh*). 

Given that, I'm super impressed by Jardin. We came late on a Wednesday night to celebrate a birthday. Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive. He made us smile since he also surprised us with a complimentary flower pot dessert that I still have not stopped showing pictures of to my friends when they ask how the trip was. I can't believe how realistic they can make it look all while ensuring it's completely edible (and delicious, mind you). 

As for the actual dishes, we split the buffalo cauliflower (with vegan blue cheese) and I ordered the mushroom steak. I seriously want to travel back to Vegas just to enjoy this entree again. I wasn't in the mood for anything fried, so the chef slightly modified this to err more on the baked side. My boyfriend's hot pot wasn't his favorite, but he still enjoyed it overall.

1998116,2016-11-02,0,XTtNTWH_Nqv27RC7OtS7dQ,"Staying at the Encore and wanting to eat ""in house"" I spent some time looking over the reviews of my different options.  Jardin, overall, had good reviews, though there seemed to be a common thread of inattentive and slow service by wait staff.  I would be dining alone and had nothing else to do, so if dinner took too long, it wasn't going to effect me negatively.

I was greeted at the entrance by two smiling, pleasant hostesses and could be seated immediately: on the patio or inside.  After inquiring about the temperature out on the patio, and being assured it was comfortable and there were heat lamps, I chose to sit there.  It was breezy, and cool and I didn't feel much heat from the nearest heat lamp; glad I was wearing a long-sleeved blouse!  

(The occasional waft of cigarette smoke from another patron or two seated on the patio was unpleasant, but not overwhelming.  The tables ARE close together and since I was dining alone, I could, without straining, overhear the conversations at the tables to my left and right--but had I been engaged in a conversation at my own table, those conversations probably wouldn't have even registered with me.  And being off-season, there wasn't any noise from the adjacent pool.)

As I was seated, the hostess gave me a drink menu which contained a respectable number of offerings.  (One of the couples eventually seated next to me weren't given a wine menu, the hostesses had evidently not retrieved them from the wait staff; their waiter brought them one upon request.) After asking a couple of questions of the waiter (he was knowledgeable of the cocktails) and asking for his recommendation, I settled for a spritzer (absolutely delicious) and some water (no ice, please).

I also ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup, the kale salad, and a side of the Brussels sprouts.  Within minutes of placing my order, my soup was delivered (hot, not scalding, so it could be enjoyed right away; hearty; tender cubes of chicken with a heaping serving of noodles).  While enjoying the soup (and consequently being warmed from the inside out), the ""bread basket"" arrived: warm, soft, chewy, pretzel sticks with a side of horseradish whipped butter (or was it aioli)--I am NO FAN of horseradish, but this was outstanding.  There was a bit of time before my salad and Brussels sprouts were delivered, so I requested some hot water with a side of lemon; promptly delivered.  The kale salad was good, though maybe a few more croutons than I would have liked, but balanced flavors and very filling.  The Brussels sprouts were superb and served hot in a miniature cast iron skillet.

With the little room I had remaining in my stomach, I chose to have dessert: layered cheesecake with dark chocolate cake.  This was the most disappointing item I put in my mouth all evening...but it was still good.  The cheesecake was creamy and delicious, but parts of the cake layer were too gummy/springy for my liking. By now I was full to nearly bursting and left half of it on my plate.

As I was leaving the restaurant I stopped to use the restroom: small (2 stalls and only 1 sink), but very clean.

Both my waiter, Dan, and ""busboy"", Cris, were attentive, courteous, kind, helpful, prompt.  Their service of my table and the tables next to me was excellent and helped turn what could have been a lonely dinner into a lovely dinner!",6QerapIatnezXRD3ZLPS6A,3,0,4,4jGgHLRhQDL7I7FmAqV1RA

The OJ is not fresh squeezed at all.. in fact, for the whole Wynn/Encore property, there was a blatant disregard to fresh OJ. I'm all for paying $8 for OJ when it's truly fresh squeezed.. but when you give me a glass of sour, watered down crap, you're shitting on my whole day!
My hubby felt the same about the coffee...both those items being the first sips of the whole day, you want it to be good and get you off to a great start. Go weak with it, you might as well throw water in my face and send me on my way. That's a bit dramatic, but we take our OJ and coffee seriously!

You look at a place like Jardin and, wow, what a stunning GORGEOUS scene.
Fresh flowers boasting throughout, mirrors everywhere. You feel you're in for an amazing dining experience. 
But, no.. no.. the experience IS the visual scene around you because the food is meh. The service was weird too..I couldn't keep track who was my waiter or busperson and I felt our busguy was more helpful than our waiter and our waiter was hella snooty. 

I had the lobster benedict with hashbrowns (which is more of an herby potato brick) and my hubs has the pancakes. I liked the benedict OK, I had to ask for more hollandaise sauce, as they literally put a thimble-full on the eggs. I had a bite of the pancakes and they were just doughy, no fancy flavors..I didn't even taste vanilla or any other flavor enhancements that could be used to make pancakes amazing!

So there ya have it. If you're just wanting to grab a drink or take in a beautiful setting. Jardin is the place to do it! If you want an amazing breakfast within the property, try the Terrace Point Cafe.",_vk88Fk8e7_HkXSMb9M9AQ,2,2,3,hTsW3iGrR0ief1KLXXw_vg

The soup was so textured and perfect. Not so much cream that you lost the tomato or vise versa. With just a bite and a dash of mancheco on top. Very very good.

Margherita Pizza- it's no NY pizza but definitely a nice starter 

Kale salad-  I could've ate 12 plates of this. Who the heck likes Kale anyway?

Steak kabobs- steak was tender and the veggies were nicely marinated 

Penne pasta- my favorite dish of the night. It had corn, eggplant, and it was bomb. This was what slowed me down at the nightclub for sure.

The highlight for me was the vegan entree of Mushroom Dashi, a beautiful bowl of baked tofu in broth with  baby bokchoy, mushrooms, and rice noodles.    It was delicious and creative.  Unfortunately, the non-vegan entrees left a lot to be desired.  The pork chop was a large portion and a good cut, but it lacked flavor and the sauce was uninspiring.  The salmon was dry and inedible.  The waiter removed it from the table without even asking why the diner left almost the entire fish on the plate.

Sea Scallop Cioppino $29

Hot Pot $20

Biegnets with Raspberry Sauce $10

The chicken meatballs were absolutely divine! They were probably the best chicken meatballs or maybe meatballs in general i've ever tasted.

Next time though i would ask for the dressing on the side bc it was dressed pretty well. I liked the apple slices in it which made it refreshing. My cioppino tasted good but I thought it was too small of a portion for $29 and the scallops were of the small variety. My wife's hot pot consisted of kurobota pork, kimchee fried rice, and a fried egg. I thought it was good but not worth $20. The dessert was fantastic! The beignets were surprisingly light and airy with the acidic raspberry sauce to balance it. The service was great. Our waiter described to us in detail about the menu.

2661114,2016-05-04,2,XTtNTWH_Nqv27RC7OtS7dQ,"Came back to Vegas about a month ago with my hubs. We always stay at Wynn as it is our favorite hotel in Vegas. After gambling for hours, like it was no one's business, we decided it was time for dinner. 

From the outside, Jardin is lovely, no doubt. Every time I've walked by in the past, I always commented on how I wanted to try the place out. On this particular night, Saturday, it wasn't busy at all. We were seated immediately, so that was nice. It pretty much went down hill from there. 

Drinks: Took forever. The alcohol is one thing, but the water and soda didn't come out until the food came out. My double vodka came first but took as long as it would if the restaurant was actually busy. (Many empty tables.) Server said the bar was backed up. I looked over and there was 1 person sitting at the bar. Yah, really out of control. The server had to bring out a cart full of alcohol for the table next to us. Super dramatic style as if the bartender was swamped af. I laughed, literally. No idea what that was about.

Food: Like I mentioned... took forever. Restaurant 85% empty. I actually ate part of the bread basket which I never do. So long... so hungry.  I ordered the salmon. It came with white rice. The rice was hard af. Unedible. Comparable to the rice at the bottom of a cooker that u don't scoop because you know it is blown. I can't believe the chef even plated it. You can tell, visually without even trying it, that it wasn't good. I told the server. He seemed nervous and unsure of himself most of the night. Service should be stellar especially if a restaurant is most empty. They comped my one double vodka which is cool, but I was hungry. :( Salmon was decent, but I have made and had better. I'd expect a whole lot more considering the price is high for what it is. My hubs ordered the ravioli. It was seriously enough for maybe a child. I believe this is why their bread basket has big soft pretzels in it. They try to fill you up with that because they know their proportions are off with taste quality low. I felt bad for him. The plate looked really sad and was over $30, I believe. I understand we could have ordered appetizers and would have if it wasn't for the fact the food was so meh. Even if the plate barely had any food, at least make it amazzzinngggg. Then the price would somewhat make sense. 

Would we ever dine here again? No. Just not worth it. Sinatra, at the Encore, is sooooo much better. Also, this restaurant looks to be more popular day time. Wayyy busier. Tables are filled. (Can imagine bartender would be out of his mind.) They also have an outdoor dining area which overlooks the pool. I guess I would come back just to sit in the patio and bask in the ambiance? I guess that deserves 1 star.",vX9V-HkwUXWnybejZjtNiQ,2,1,1,F7VJFrk4PJQFQX4azJ-Sgw

The seating is lovely, bright colors, sparkling place settings and a fresh brilliantly colored single flower. I choose to sit inside however there is outdoor seating that highlights the beautiful water. My seat gave me an upfront view of the outdoors, beautiful flowers, luxurious seating and the colorful plant life. Gazing out the window was calming and relaxing. As I was seated the host neatly placed my napkin on my lap. I was immediately greeted by another staff member, again by my name who filled my water glass and took my drink order. Once I received my coffee the staff member offered to go over any questions I had about the menu and offer suggestions. I choose coffee to start and the Jardin Burger with fries.

Everything arrived quickly and hot. Before I received my order I was given complementary warm twisted soft butter pretzels with a spicy mustard. Delicious!. My burger was not only delicious it was a beautiful presentation on a wooden cutting board along with lettuce tomatoes and a colorful hot pepper. The fries were so-so nothing to speak about they were eight dollars a little pricey but OK what the heck I'm on vacation. 

In all it was a great value, the lunch items are not extremely pricing. I enjoyed the quiet time I spent glaring out into the courtyard.

We did the fixed menu option.  They start you with a literal tea cup of cauliflower soup - it was basic.  Next We had the chicken meatballs and crab cakes as an app, both were actually quite good!  We both thought it was going to be a good meal... until the main dishes came.  I had surf and turf and my husband had the roasted chicken.  I don't think they used salt on anything.  My steak was disappointingly bad - over cooked and no flavor.  Shrimp was cooked fine but bland and they topped it with a type of pesto that didn't work with with of the proteins and didn't even taste good.  I actually took it off and pushed it to the side of my plate.  The broccolini was only slightly over steamed. 

My husbands chicken was served over a bed of smashed fingerling potatoes with a hatch chili sauce and side of green beans. The chicken was cooked well, but again lacked flavor.  I pretty sure they don't use any type of salt or pepper when cooking.  They shouldn't even try to call the sauce any type of chili, it's a plain red sauce.  Never would I describe it as any type of chili, more like a tomato sauce.  The beans were just good ol' steamed beans.  

They redeemed themselves with desert.  We had the maple pudding and apple crostata, both were excellent.  Wish I would have had more room to eat them.  

The other factor contributing to the three stars is that the waitress went missing for a while. We actually thought she was on break.  My beverage  sat empty for about 15 minutes.

One word: yes. 
As a vegan, I thought it would be hard to find food in Vegas. Turns out every Wynn restaurant has a vegan/vegetarian menu which explains why I was at the Wynn almost every day. 

Anyways, I had the veggie pizza in the ""socializing"" part of the menu (fancy way of saying ""appetizer"" I guess), and my god it was good. The vegan ricotta was very light and fluffy. It didn't really taste like cheese but who am I to say? I haven't had cheese for like 8 years. Toppings were generous and they all paired together nicely. I finished about ¾ of it and took the rest back to the hotel to eat later. If you're vegan, I highly recommend the pizza!

2800367,2017-01-09,0,XTtNTWH_Nqv27RC7OtS7dQ,"If you want a less than stellar meal, a poolside hotel restaurant offers pretty good odds.  Jardin strives to beat those odds but, like most of the players in the casino, it falls short.  

First, the good.  The space is quite lovely, with a tasteful floral motif.  We sat on the patio, and the heaters kept us comfy, even on a cool January day in Vegas.  The patio was even far enough from the pool to keep you from getting drenched by overly enthusiastic kids doing cannonballs.  But that's where the really good part ends.

My wife and I both ordered Eggs Benedict, and we agreed that we have had much better.  The eggs were perfectly cooked, but the hollandaise was skimpy and the English muffins were dry and a bit hard.  The hash browns were definitely second rate - sort of a brick of (riced?) potatoes that elevated creativity over flavor.  And by ""creativity,"" I mean I have never seen anything quite like it.  Also, while $20 is not totally outrageous for Eggs Benedict (especially at the Wynn/Encore), for that price couldn't they have put a little slice of orange or sprig of parsley on the plate to dress it up a bit?  It all seemed kind of sparse.  Our friends both ordered omelets.  I didn't see them projectile spitting their meal across the patio, but they weren't exactly raving about the dish either.  And both of them left their ""hash browns"" untouched.  

Since this was to be my only meal for the day, I also ordered a bowl of the roasted tomato soup (my attempt to convert breakfast into brunch), which was just fine.  Good tomato flavor, and a touch of tasty garnish.

Our server was very pleasant, when she was visible.  Which was not often.  It took much too long from seating to taking our order, and from clearing the table to bringing the check.  Fortunately, our friends are exceptional conversationalists.  But as it turns out, the fact that they were staying at the Wynn was the only reason to eat at Jardin.

No, I didn't try the buttermilk chicken sandwich, or some of the other dishes that get good reviews here.  But if you want a better Eggs Benedict, go off-Strip to Hash House A-Go-Go, or Black Bear Diner, or really just about anywhere.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,1,3,KGoXeNO2sf-mSYyq6y6RBQ

It's located in the beginning of the Encore Esplanade, right across from Hermes. It's a beautiful restaurant with tons of colorful flowers. If you sit outside, you overlook the pool area. 

I don't like ending conversations on a negative note so I'm not doing that with this review. The food was marvelous and I'll get into that soon. But the service was very lacking which was surprising to me for a luxury resort hotel. I had had wonderful service so far during my stay that I was disheartened to experience less than great service from Jardin. I was told afterward from my husband that he had made a special request TWICE (from the hostess who sat us down and to the maitre'd himself) for our anniversary. Unfortunately, that request was never fulfilled and even when he had approached them afterward, they did not make any offer of amends. 

We had three different servers. One had been moved indoors and so we had a second server. Then it got too cold outside and once we were moved inside, we had our third server. Of the three, our second server, Megan, was the most attentive. We were not checked on often by any of the other two which was a sad shame. 

But on a better note, our lunch was fabulous. I ordered the avocado toast as an appetizer and it seems pricey at $16 but it comes with three triangular toasts that are heaped on with fresh avocado, black garlic humus, pomegranate seeds, lettuce and grape tomatoes. It was delicious. 

We both ordered the Maine Lobster Benedict and it was the best Benedict I've ever had. $24 but very much worth it in my opinion. Two English muffins with large pieces of lobster on each and an excellently poached egg on top of each. In the middle was a rectangular hash brown that was a great compliment to the dish. It was very crispy and buttery. I loved this dish and highly recommend it if you're able to have lobster and don't mind the higher price. 

I also had the Orange Lavender Mule which was delicious! Loved it so much, Megan gave me the recipe from the bar.  It was so refreshing and delightful. I also had an English breakfast with milk. They serve Forte teas on the Wynn property which is nice.

Now the food seemed to be reasonably priced (I ordered a filet minon medium rare $49). So not only did we wait what seemed an eternity but the food was 
mediocre to say the least and that might even be shooting a tad too high. My filet mignon wasn't evenly cooked and even worse more than half of it was rare!

Seriously, each restaurant at the Wynn has very similar fare for a very similar price, at least when it comes to lunch, and never does it disappoint. Each meal will run from $15-$25 on average and is very filling. Service is always on point and most places have outdoor seating available, perfect for a spring day. 

I had the chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato waffle fries. The chicken sandwich was exceptionally cooked, perfectly paired with some creamy slaw. The waffle fries were good but not great. I wish the sandwich came with a side instead of having to order the fries a la cartel but it is what it is. I highly recommend the sandwich if you come to Jardin. The salad, especially with added salmon, also looked very good from what I saw at tables around me. 

Overall I liked my meal here and would recommend it for atmosphere alone if you get an outdoor seating area. My one huge complaint is the reservation process. I first tried OpenTable and it said they were booked from 10am-2pm. I then called Wynn reservations and same thing. As I showed up at noon, I found that the place was only about a third full.

We enjoyed our veggie frittata and chicken sausage and eggs entrees were very good. I especially enjoyed the frittata with sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, broccolini, manchego and parmesan.

The dish was very fresh and hit the spot!

We were promptly seated by the hostess & asked about the vegan menu since we mostly eat plant based. There were so many options that I was amazed despite having heard that Wynn restaurants are famous for having plant based options. Businesses often boast that they have one & then you're aced with an option of tomato pasta (boring & I can make that myself!) but Wynn has an extensive menu. We ordered the tofu scramble breakfast with sourdough bread (they even have a few vegan bread options to choose from) & the banana french toast meal with black coffees. We also had a good waitress who was very professional, checked in on us every now & again, & answered our questions about the menu. 

The food was wonderful. The tofu scramble meal was delicious & not overly flavorful but just right. It wasn't overbearing in tumeric like a lot of tofu scrambles are.. in fact I don't know that the chef even used tumeric. If so it wasn't obvious which I liked. Perfect for the first meal of the day because it wasn't as heavy as it looked. The meal is also loaded with breakfast potatoes so for my potato addict self it was a great combination. The banana french toast was our favorite because it's hard to find a vegan french toast that is made well & tastes like.. well actual french toast! Topped with berries it was heavenly. 

The restaurant is fairly casual but still elegant. I liked that people here were engaged in quiet conversation. Sometimes on the Strip even at breakfast it can get super loud & obnoxious so being at the end of the Strip has its benefits.

The food here was creative, but the flavors were off-balance. The fried chicken and waffle was overly breaded and under-seasoned. I wanted to ask for cholula, but stopped myself since it was a $20 dish! The eggs benedict was on par with any other brunch restaurant. Their coffee tasted burned.

Sadly, I still haven't found a go-to breakfast/brunch spot in Las Vegas. Bouchon was also underwhelming, so maybe I should just stick to the Peppermill? That place is consistently good breakfast at all hours. Next time i'll pass on Jardin and prob do the Wynn buffet.",_oEWe8fnyAif0sBYrju-Lw,8,6,2,hBJJmzTTUB3nbXcTuV0Pqw

It was crowded, but fine and inside the restaurant was almost empty.  We ordered a bowl of soup, flatbread, arugula salad and chicken meatballs.  We asked our waiter to bring everything out at once so we could share.  We then waited over 30 minutes for our soup and salad to arrive.  Ouch.  Every table around us was being served while we watched and wondered where our remaining items were (meatballs and flatbread).  And we waited. And we waited. Without apology, our last two items showed up after the salad and soup were long gone--at least 30 min later.  By then it was over the acceptable wait time and the patio chairs became uncomfortable and the other patron's smoke started to annoy us.  We had intended to go in for a few appetizers and got stuck in service hell.   In hindsight, I should've spoken with the manager but we were in a hurry to get out of there.  Enough was enough.   Definitely the slowest, most irritating service we've had in Vegas in a long time.

My husband got the prix fixed menu while I chose to do a mishmash of options for my meal. I started with the ""beef' croquettes, which are made of the Impossible meat.  Basically, it looks and tastes like beef but is a pure vegetarian protein.  My husband tasted it and said that if he wasn't told it wasn't beef he wouldn't have known that it was veggie.  It's now more available at Umami and The Counter.

I got the chicken entree, while my husband had the crab cake and the filet. He liked his crab cake and the filet. I also enjoyed my meal but wanted to save room for dessert.  My husband received a butterscotch pot de creme and he enjoyed it. But I was waiting for my flowerpot cake.  It did not disappoint! It literally looks like a flowerpot and for $18, you got a large cake.  It is so good.  And when you make the first break into that pot, and the cake comes oozing out, it's so worth it.  The cake was rich and had a wonderful layer of raspberry jam filling.  It was rich, moist and enough to have for random bites over the next few days (when kept on ice).

The Coffee: It is from Fonte coffee roaster in Seattle. Steve Wynn made a special trip up there to choose this coffee to be served at Jardin so it is super special and ofcourse one of the kind.....Just do yourself a favor and order it.

The Nutella french toast was amazing..... It had walnut on the top.... I don't like any kind of nuts in my food so for next time I will order it w/o them.

Food: I should have read the fine print a/o asked questions.

The pasta was cooked al dente and my unrefined palate again, was unhappy. Jardin totally delivered on the meal, I just expected cheap spaghetti bolognese but was served a much nicer meal. We also ordered the Thai chicken wings which were very tasty and the green vegan pizza which was surprisingly good for vegan food.

We came here around 2 on a Friday after checking in and before hitting the Encore pool. Half of the menu was breakfast, with only a few salad and sandwich choices. I went with the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. The salad came soaked in dressing, it was very soggy and iced cold as if it was sitting in a fridge before they doused it with dressing. Also, for an extra $7 I expected grilled chicken, this was cubed pieced of semi frozen chicken, similar to what you'd find in a bag at the supermarket. I understand that Caesar is made with anchovies but the fishy taste was overpowering. I ended up sending it back and the waiter apologized and offered me something else.

We ordered a BOY Burger and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. After waiting for our food for 30 minutes, we asked what was taking so long. The waitress replied that it takes 20 minutes to cook a burger (okay, then why is it not ready after 20?). We waited 40 minutes for the food to finally arrive. The soup came in parts: a few shredded pieces of dried out chicken and exactly 4 small pieces of dried pasta. The waitress then proceeded to pour broth from a teapot into the chicken to hydrate it, I guess. The presentation was unique but the taste was awful. The soup had absolutely no flavor at all! I put a lot of salt into it and it still lacked flavor. This was not even chicken broth. It tasted and looked like beef broth or the au jus that comes with a french dip sandwich(but even that would have had more flavor). I complained about the lack of taste to the waitress and she said that the manager would come over to speak us. For a restaurant that is very highly priced in a very upscale hotel with a chef's name attached, I'd expect that they could handle a bowl of chicken noodle soup. The manager said she would take the price of the soup off our bill ($10). That was fine but not the point. When our bill did arrive we were charged $36 for a burger and an ice tea. The price of the burger on the menu was $16 but on our bill it was charged as $29! When I asked about this the waitress said she would take it to the manager. She came back with a lowered bill and stated that the manager took off the ice tea. This still did not explain the $29 charge for a $16 burger. We were so frustrated with poor service and lousy food we just paid the bill. On the way out, I asked to see the menu one more time to see if there was something I missed, the young ladies at the front desk were very rude. When I questioned why the burger had an extra $13 on it they said that it was for the toppings and fries (really, cheese?!). I asked why it didn't say that on the menu. She stated the restaurant had just opened and they needed to work out some kinks on the menu. With all of the outstanding choices of places to eat at the Wynn and in Vegas in general, why would anyone want to waste their money on this place. Awful, don't waste your time, taste buds, or money!",M2gBtZUEPVQ5oT0bI1ogXQ,5,0,1,P0LUs2xJ5jvW5UEol-2E3w

They were well staffed, and not too busy maybe 4 other tables in there with us. The restaurant itself is huge! Counting the large outside seating area.
   
      SEATING/AMBIANCE:We were seated right away and noticed immediately the ambiance was incredible! We started by trying a couple of their Mule Cocktails as there was a beverage cart making them table side which was neat. The Mule's were average, nothing spectacular. Then after a time our server greeted us after having had our drink order taken and our cocktails made at the beverage cart and asked if we were ready to order which we were. We ordered the Buttermilk Chicken entree and the Beef Short Rib Ravioli along with a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and a side of Vegetables.  
         THE FOOD was served promptly which is always nice! The presentation of each and every course was immaculate (which it should be for the prices and being a fine dining establishment). The food itself however was underwhelming and we were rather disappointed in the quality of flavor or lack thereof. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was really just Okay along with the almost flavorless Mashed potatoes. The vegetables didn't have much flavor and were somewhat watery. The Buttermilk Chicken was average for fried chicken, probably the best thing was the Beef Short Rib Ravioli which even then I would say was just ""Good"" the best thing about it was it's unique sauce with nice flavor. The portions of course were very small (even for fine dining) and expensive. Need to deliver more then beautiful presentation and ambiance, especially in Vegas were fine restaurants are a dime a dozen.
        THE SERVICE: We maybe saw our server twice and only for a moment each time once to take order and again to deliver bill all other contact was with the the Food Delivery person or Beverage cart attendant. Overall we spent $140 for dinner and didn't bother for dessert because of the underwhelming experience up until then.

I worked in restaurants of this caliper and the key we were always taught and it was stressed...the customer is always right despite what the Chef wants to do.  So I dropped 40 bucks here and did not get what I wanted.  That is just awful.  Stay clear and save your money. What I had you can get just as good at Red Hot and Blue!!!

Jardin's menu and beautiful patio initially attracted us to dine here, so we decided to try it for dinner one evening during our most recent trip.  We were seated quickly without any reservations, but after being guided to a table on the patio, the hostess left and the service issues began.  

From the beginning of service until we paid the bill, we were disappointed.  Our server largely ignored us, not being able to offer much helpful information about the menu or the wine list, making us feel like more of an imposition than an invited guest.  We had to flag her down several times throughout the meal to order appetizers, entrees & wine, and even to request our check (which took more than 15 minutes).  Other service members were not helpful or seemingly willing to help), so eventually we just gave up hope that service would recover and tried to enjoy our meal.

Thankfully, the food was delicious.  There were not many seafood entrees, but of those offered, the bouillabaisse was the best, filled with tender squid and buttery scallops, a surprisingly light and delicate dish that really challenged the idea of what a bouillabaisse should be.  The hamburger was also well-liked, definitely filling by itself or with a generous side of fries (it does not come with fries, so if you want them, be sure to order them as a side).

Overall, if you are in a hurry, Jardin is not your best bet...but if you have time to kill and really want to enjoy the beauty of the Encore/Wynn gardens, then Jardin may be your #1 pick!

4480091,2017-04-14,0,XTtNTWH_Nqv27RC7OtS7dQ,"During our most recent visit to Encore we had dinner on our first night at Jardin, and boy were we pleased...

The meal began with a bread basket of pretzel bread sticks with a peppercorn butter spread. Usually u say ""ugh"" when pretzel bread comes out since most places I've had it serves cold, tough bland pretzel bread which wastes precious appetite reserved for the appetizers and entrees that I am there for.  I decided to try a bit more out of curiosity for the taste of the peppercorn butter spread.  I was VERY surprised to bite into a hot soft delicious breadstick with just the right amount of salt which the peppercorn spread complemented beautifully.  I have never spent more than an passing comment about a bread service, but I felt that I needed to share my delightful surprise...

Moving along...  in our group of four people, we ordered both appetizer and main dinner courses.

Appetizers included the Roasted Tomato Soup about which the two in my party who had it raved.  My wife and I split and Caesar Salad which was very fresh and crisp, dressed perfectly with just the right amount of dressing and Grana Padano cheese. Delicious!

For our entrees my wife and I split the Short Rib Ravioli and the Bigeye Tuna Poke.

Short Rib Ravioli consisted of delicious braised short rib meat stuffed in pillows of fresh pasta to form the ravioli.  Parmesan cream sauce with port glaze to add some nice flavor perfected the dish.  If you love, like or can tolerate short ribs and enjoy a rich (but not overwhelming) cream sauce, you will LOVE this dish (hopefully) as much as I did!!!  

The Tuna Poke was very nice and fresh and balanced. My only suggestion to improve it to my taste would be to add more avocado. Something about sashimi grade Tuna diced with avocado chunks is a match made in culinary heaven.  Just my opinion though... if you don't dislike avocado you won't mind it.  

One other of our party ordered the Lobster Capellini and said that it was very good. He finished the dish and he is not one to do so unless it is something he truly enjoyed...

Service was very attentive and professional.  Not one complaint or neutral/negative comment to be found.

The decor was beautiful and featured an immense floral arrangement in the center of the restaurant which brightened up the entire space.  Just gorgeous!",pls-OaQ3triTOpW8d1mHgg,2,0,5,fHakmlbW-cfeSR2sMFAAAA

Let's start off with service. The service was absolutely impeccable. Our waiter made excellent recommendations, checked up on us  properly and our water glasses were never empty. I wish I had gotten our waiter's name because I would request him every time. We also did not come in with a reservation. My friend and I had missed a reservation at Tableau and wandered looking for a new place (so glad we missed Tableau because in comparison to Jardin, eating at Tableau is like eating at Denny's). We were seated promptly. We did feel slightly weird as many patrons are dressed too nicely for a ""casual"" restaurant but the staff did not seem to care that we were underdressed.

We got three appetizers to share since my friend and I found those most appealing. Before our food came out, we were served complementary pretzel sticks with honey mustard whip. Let me tell you, these were some of the best pretzels I've ever had. We ordered the smoked octopus, buffalo cauliflower and strip steak carpaccio. The smoked octopus was my favorite! It's served with chorizo and a garlic aioli. The octopus is so tender that it cuts with a fork. I would come back for this dish alone! Next, buffalo cauliflower is a pretty standard dish. Jardin did it so well, the cauliflower was cooked just perfectly and the breading was light and crisp. Lastly, the beef carpaccio was sliced thinner than paper! Overall the food was so fabulous that my friend and I were almost in tears (yes we cry over food lol). 

I cannot recommend Jardin enough! Food was amazing, service was amazing, decor is amazing! I can't wait to come back to try their flower pot dessert. Yuuuuum.",oOb3FZnpC0JUk6a0-1xiHQ,2,0,5,NfIai_vSvftDZkfOkTT9lg

I ordered the orange and lavender mule and the pork chop. The mule was fresh and light and a nice summer cocktail. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and the glaze was sweet and smoky. The pork chop was served with a cauliflower purée and an arugula and radish salad. We also ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and a side of the Mac and cheese bites. The meatballs were tender and the bites were ooey gooey cheesy and came out super hot. Jardin also starts you with pretzel bread twists that come out of the kitchen warm served with cold honey mustard butter.

We ended our meal with the famous flower pot dessert. It's a chocolate cake with chocolate mouse and raspberry sauce, surrounded by a chocolate shell, and topped with cookie crumbs and edible flowers. It's both gorgeous and delicious. The menu says that it serves 2-3 and there were 3 of us and we couldn't finish it. Honestly, it would probably be the perfect size for 4 to share unless you have a major sweet tooth (a quarter of the cake was enough to satisfy mine).

It was a perfect medium rare throughout. It was super lean but very very tender. It was juicy and flavorful. I absolutely loved it. The filet came with broccolini on the side. 

Usually the ribeye is my favorite cut of steak because of the marbling but I tried my friends ribeye and I definitely liked my filet better. It was a little chewy I felt that the cut was fatty but the fat wasn't well distributed. It was still good but the filet is better quality.

This is an American restaurant that triples their prices because it's in the Wynn... Duhhhh obvi. I was looking at their menu for a price range and it was your basic 10$ for vegetables, 30$ for a few pieces of shrimp ETC... So not that bad.

We tried the cheese and meat plate, and kale salad for appetizer. Then for dinner: baked chicken on green beans, tomato cheese rice, steak for entrees. We also got ONE free Moscow mule. No dessert unfortunately. Everything was delicious and made with superb quality. Everything didn't wow me but it was delicious and piping hot! 

Our server wasn't very friendly though, she acted like we were a burden because we were a comped table... Does she not know us industry people tip out extremely well?

The hollandaise wasn't spectacular.  I ordered the fruit instead of the hash brown which was just a block.  It seemed like a creative attempt but it did not deliver.  The food itself, was good.  I enjoyed it. 

Our table wanted mimosas for the brunch so they said they'll send over the drink cart.  The drink cart was unattended for most of it. No one came by.  The table requested this 3x during the entire meal and no one came by.  Even getting our waitress was impossible.

She was missing and the restaurant was not busy.  After we were done, the drink cart came by and asked what we wanted and sounded surprised when we said, we don't want anything, we're done with the meal.

I would honestly rate everything a 9-10/10 on the taste level. The truffle fries were great and the burger was awesome. Pepper jack cheese, short ribs, crispy onion strings, and such great flavor. 

A bit annoying that the burger came a la carte - which is why I ordered the truffle fries to share. 

Desserts didn't seem so appealing although I did see a few people ordering the extravagant banana split and the flower pot dessert (for the taste, or the instagram, I'm not sure)

Sitting outside as beautiful even in December!!!! Inside looked beautiful as well with a beautiful flower vase 

The reason for the 4 star review is the hostesses. We asked how long the wait was for a table for 3 and she told us it would be 25 minutes. Looking around I noticed the tables were not full, the place was not busy, and that she had to have lied. She said there was a bunch of reservations however even seated, I saw not too many people coming in. My parents initially asked how long.

The drinks were top notch. I had the Vanilla Rose cocktail first. It was nicely presented with a flower, and was the perfect balance of sweet and sour. I also had the red sangria, which was huge (like the size of my head) and pretty boozy. I was into it.

For entrées, we ordered the short rib ravioli and a tofu with mushroom and Asian noodles. The tofu with mushroom dish, which is vegan, was outstanding, with phenomenal spices and a lovely overall presence. The ravioli was boring and a little too sour due to some strange sauce on top of it and it just was anything but impressive. Honestly, the best part of the meal was the pretzels that came at the beginning which are equivalent to a bread basket. The downside was they had a horse radish like butter that I did not enjoy but the pretzel sticks were so good that all else did not matter. 
Therefore, it was only a three star experience and food is just OK.

It was a little bit cold but I made sure to get seated by a heat lamp.  Our party of 3 sat at a table for 6, so we each got to sit on the side of the table facing the pool area which was very nice.

I was underwhelmed by my sandwich.  I think I would have been happier with a fast food chicken sandwich :p  The taste of the cole slaw was pretty overpowering.  I also wasn't wowed by their strawberry smoothie nor their chocolate cake dessert - both were just ok and pretty pricey.  The cake was very Instagram-worthy though :p  It looked just like a flower in a pot and was 100% edible.   The menu said it serves 2-3, but it was more like 4-6.

The problem, however, is with the service.
I appreciate that it was slow at 8 o'clock on a Friday morning. However it initially took some time for a server to greet us, maybe because we were seated outdoors.
Once we were seated we ordered our breakfast. My husband ordered the steak and eggs and I ordered the salmon and capers with the bagel. The food was amazing. The salmon plate was delicious. The salmon tasted fresh and the accompaniment of the cucumber and tomatoes were wonderful.
However, if The food hadn't been good there was no one around to tell. The servers were MIA for most of our breakfast. When I got up to find someone to give me a coffee cup , the manager was standing in the middle of the room on his cell phone texting. I literally stood in front of him and cleared my throat so he would stop texting and look up and talk to me. Now I can see if I was at Denny's, but this is in the middle of the Encore and I expected better service. When I told him I was looking for my server he told me that he sent her home because it was slow. That's great, but I still needed a coffee refill and some cream cheese.

Their drinks? So Many great choices. Try one of their moscow mules, they have a whole specialty bar cart to come around to make you your perfect mule! I promise it won't disappoint. 

The service was great, we interacted with a few and everyone was welcoming and patient. They also were mindful of when we needed to get going to be at our show on time. (Le Reve, check it out!)

We were not able to check out their brunch, but I hear it's pretty nice!",Cv7ojfqfwDbLlrNJpfWxkg,1,1,5,kw9vCsJg-iOAhFkJFQIdyg

The server came right over, got us water and coffee stat. Our orders were taken in a reasonable amount of time and our food was out in 10-15. It filled up shortly after we got in. 

My chicken and waffles consisted of a large, breaded chicken tender and a piece of French toast with a Frosted Flakes type breaking and a sunny side egg in the middle. There was no waffle. I don't know why they call it chicken and waffles, but it was really good none-the-less. The French toast was very nice and flavorful. My hubby had eggs benedict  and said it was ""pretty good.""

We started with a arugula salad: very fresh and delicious. Next i had some kind of bread with pork belly avocado and a few other things on top. It was awesome i never had something like that before. We drank moscow miles with everything! Easily one of the best mules i've ever had but it wasn't too strong. 

Next we had salmon which was hot and crispy omg he outside. The dip it came with was good too. Last we have a small piece of steak: very well cooked and crispy on the outside. i love when the food comes burning hot it's really so important! 

Last i had the banana bread pudding and signature pot dessert. Both were UHHHAMAAZZZINNG! Check out my awesome pics!",Butq-0nTDYKFtSlpjmud3g,2,1,5,DeCqyyvlq9Y-6_lRc0zBag

Four of us had a royal breakfast here. We relished every bit of it, awesome.
I had a couple of breakfasts here several years ago when Encore was first built. This time, third time, it was a charm. I had 2 glasses of fresh squeezed green juice. It was so refreshingly pleasing to my taste buds; I was tempted to have several more glasses. We pretty much randomly picked various dishes. All of the dishes were so tasty, wowing all 4 of us.

The waitress was cheerful, eager to serve, and actually listening and accommodating whatever whims we had. She even spread jam on the left-over bread that we wanted to take out, truly above and beyond.

We were seated right next to the centerpiece of ""royal"" bouquet, humongous and grandiose and still very elegant.

We paid $200 for 4 of us, a bit pricey, but we still felt real good; worth every penny it was.

Instead of the long lines at Wynn breakfast buffet, this is now officially our favorite poolside breakfast nook in Vegas.",zHgJx4Q0MjKQBjJgPeN8cg,0,1,5,4GlqtoZ2bC7DkIxB4gVwUg

For lunch, I ordered the jardin burger, which was excellent. Juicy, with the porkbelly on top with the aoli sauce. Just perfect, and a side of fries. My gf got the margarita pizza, which was good as well. 

Overall this place has a vibe that combines the elegance of a Sunday brunch with the cool & chill atmosphere. Would definitely come back. The floral center decoration in the middle of the restaurant just brings it all together.",6x6XfyDvc4YYwCH591Csvw,0,0,5,toPhQNaZMzgmsZ_uO097-g

The service isn't good. They all look like they'd rather be somewhere else. Our busser was more attentive than our waiter. He never delivered the dishes or checked on our food but he popped up every 30 seconds to pick up the signed check. For these prices you would think they would bring it with either service or food but the food was pretty average too. It reminds me of a high end cafe. I had a three course meal and there isn't one thing that stood out. The beet salad was blah and our apple crostata came with no ice cream and was so thick all you tasted was dough. When you're not delicate or rush pastry, it shows. I think the most disappointing part of our meal was having to eat around cigarette smokers on nearby tables (using the restaurant cups for ashtrays). It's gross having someone blow smoke when you're trying to take a bite and I don't know if it was allowed but no staff said anything and they were very aware of it. Judging by the loud EDM music, I think they are trying to cater to a younger, club crowd. Awkward for families and a romantic date.",RArQt74He3Ok8asTRUw2FQ,3,1,2,xjBUMZa551X4HTUhQ02X4A

5978970,2017-08-21,2,XTtNTWH_Nqv27RC7OtS7dQ,"Never again! I came to Jardin with 4 other ladies on 08/19 during my sister's bachelorette weekend in Vegas. We were going to XS later that night and wanted to have a nice dinner before hand. The main reason we chose Jardin is because it is close to the club and beautiful but the service we received was an absolute joke! 

Our server came by and said hello and then we didn't see her for almost 20 minutes. Meanwhile other servers are hanging around our table noticing us looking for our server and not one of them came to check on us. When our server finally came back she simply said, ""Sorry I had to step off the floor"". So my first question is why didn't you let us know that or send someone to check on us? It's not like we went a cheap diner! This place is upscale so the guests should be treated that way. 

Our food took FOREVER to come out. I realize it was a Saturday night but again the server never came and checked on us and the restaurant honestly looked like it was dead. Once the food finally arrived we were so disappointed. Luckily we were snacking throughout the day so we only ordered small meals because the food was just alright and the drinks were mediocre as well. The presentation was fabulous but the taste...not so much.

After we had finished with our food it took our server another 10 years to finally check on us and my sister in law asked her very nicely for our check and she asked if she could please split them. This server looked at my sister in law and said (with a TON of attitude) ""all 5?! Ugh just give me 2 minutes"". About 10 minutes laster she returned with checks, slammed them down in front of each of us and said, ""thanks"" under her breath as she was walking away. 

At this point we were upset and wanted to speak with a manager. I have friends that are servers and I even worked in a restaurant for a short while myself so I completely understand that not every table can be pampered and that splitting checks can be a pain but with that being said this place was not cheap and the service we received was terrible. The manager came over and our server made sure to be very close pretending to do stuff so she could listen in to our complaints. All the manager said was ""I'm sorry for your experience let me get your checks"". After another 10 minutes goes by the server (yes, the one we had a bad experience with) came back with our checks and said very sarcastically ""I'm sorry for you bad experience, the manager took $5 off your meals"". 

Why would they send the server who we complained about to give us our checks? Also it is nice that the manager took some money off of our meals but honestly $5 off at a place as expensive as Jardin is more of a slap in the face than an apology. We were not looking to get anything discounted or free but we wanted management to know about our experience so hopefully their future guests have a better time and the half hearted apology we received along with the $5 off seemed like they were just trying to get us out the door. Overall I was truly disappointed that our final dinner for my sister's bachelorette party was ruined by the horrible service and treatment we received from Jardin, I highly recommend anyone who is considering to eat here to turn the other way. Although the ambience and appearance of this place is fabulous everything else was subpar.",lbpCh9iAwelQde7skyXqSQ,4,0,1,999_A9JkXkpedors2ZiRSg
