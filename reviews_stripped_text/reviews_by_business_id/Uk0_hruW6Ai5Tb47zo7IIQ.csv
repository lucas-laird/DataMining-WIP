Why pay $40+ to get in if you don't have to?  Essentially the only costs you're obligated to are tips (limo driver and hot ladies).  Lap dances are $20+tip for one song.  Private dances start at $100 for 3 songs with a 2 drink minimum (one for you; one for your lady) at around $50.  So including tips, you're paying close to $200 for this service.   My buddy, who was having his birthday, wanted this, so 3 of us took 3 girls to the private rooms and they rotated among us.  They even have longer sessions for $200 and up.  The girls can be pretty aggressive, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars, but they're hot, beautiful, and mostly very sweet.  If you don't want to be approached aggressively, then remain standing and walking around the club.

Plan on spending a lot, and bring cash.  Including spotting my birthday buddy's tips, I got out of there for under $300.  Not bad at all!",gep0yhV8ZVyj28esQdi6kw,2,1,4,D9vlfGuMmsraR03n9psvtA

I am not a rookie to strip clubs. I have visited 3 of the Spearmint Rhino's in Cali (Industry, Torrence, and Downtown LA). Cali is a ho asis and I have had a few drinks of water.


First off... DO NOT USE A CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT!!! These bastards will try to authorize $200 on your card and not tell you!! So Beware... Locals don't even visit and you know its bad when the ""working girls"" tell their clients to visit them elsewhere cause the above average extortion is bad for business.


People who opt for the ""free"" limo ride do not encounter this.  Also when you question the charges the bouncers get aggressive. I said fuck it and went to Cheetahs down the street. 

If you like to pretend to be a baller or just like to trick out $300 at minimum to have an ok time this is the spot for you. If you have never been to a strip club before you may enjoy your self cause you know no better.. smh...The girls are slick and will get you for every dollar so that daddy is happy at the end of the day.

I prefer Cheetah's of Saphire cause if you dress right, got game, and a lil $ you could have a great time and possibly leave with a Vegas souvenir about 4am... ya dig..


I understand pay to play, but f being hustled.... so think with your big head and not the little one. Trick @ ur own risk..",LA-9g8CP7LEN0qMRbIcSEw,2,0,1,6Z-tz7uKat2PSXLory3lmw
186681,2016-05-22,5,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"This was my first time in a strip club ever. I did a lot of research on what strip club to visit in Vegas and I ended up with going to Spearmint Rhino. I booked a ride for me and + 2, the driver called 10 minutes before arriving at our hotel and he called again when he was at the hotel. So Spearmint Rhino promises a free ride to the club + free admission (no entry fee) when you take the free ride. I gotta say I was very sceptical about all this, it just sounded way too good to be true. The craziest thing is that it was all true! Our driver was very nice and friendly, he was well dressed and he looked very formal. We gave him $30 as a tip when we arrived at the club since apparentely it's a usual thing to tip the driver. At the club entrance the bouncer (or whatever he's called) checked our ID's and scanned us with a metal detector. All of that went well and fast. After that an employee of the club told us to follow him and he took us to a nice spot to be seated. So yeah the seats and tables are all free and no ""VIP's"" will come and steal them from you like in some other clubs. After being seated a nice waitress came over to take our orders and after that a stripper came to hang out with us. The waitress and the stripper both were beautiful and hot. The stripper actually chatted with us a while before even asking if someone of us wanted a lap dance. She was very nice and very lovely and not at all too pushy. When she asked us about the lap dance we kindly told her ""maybe later"" and she didn't get mad or mean, she just was like ""Alright, enjoy your night guys"" and smiled and soon went away.

The place was PACKED with HOT girls.. like oh my god, there were so many of them. Everywhere you looked there was sonething to look at if you know what I mean. The stage show was nice and you could see so many hot girls all the time. So regarding the girls this place is probably one of the best or even the best.

The prices for drinks were kind of normal for strip clubs, at least regarding to what I have read. 10-12$ for ""basic"" drinks, e.g. a beer or a cider. The lap dances cost $20 which apparently is quite much but OH BOY were they good, like god damn! I took four lapdances total from two different girls. If I wasn't a semi poor university student I would have went into the VIP which would have overall cost about $130 at it's cheapest. But yeah the lapdances last for ""one song"", which is like 3-5 minutes, but at least in my opinion they are well worth it! The girls let you touch them almost everywhere (I would say not between their legs if you know what I mean but I didn't even try that). You want squeeze the girl's boobs during a lap dance? Done! You want to grab the girl's ass during a lap dance? Done! In my opinion you can't ask for more from a lap dance. The girls are very experienced and grind their butts on your crotch. Yeah and of course the girls are topless.

In conclusion I would REALLY recommend the Spearmint Rhino. It was very good and the only bad thing I can say about it is that it was just a bit too dark in there. But otherwise it was very good and I had a really good time!

237188,2010-01-18,6,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"I had a bad time at this place. But I have to tell the truth: plenty of gorgeous girls to look at. That's about the only good thing here. 

I did not appreciate the fact that they'll give you a free limo ride to the place, but not a free limo ride back to your hotel. I *walked* back when I had had enough, thank you very much.

They let in way too many people - the place was horribly crowded at 2am, as crowded as any nightclub I've ever been to in L.A., where it's practically standing-room-only, where you really have to fight your way through the crowd, like a school of salmon fighting their way upriver to spawn.

The club is nicely-designed - if it were less crowded it would have been a pleasure to explore all the many different nooks and crannies. There appear to be a wide variety of different VIP rooms and there are lots of provisions for group parties. But as crowded as it was, it seemed that there were people waiting in line - strippers standing next to their clients - for spaces to do lap dances in. That's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen. And it was a struggle just to get a drink at the bar. You couldn't sit anywhere, and you couldn't stand hardly anywhere because asshole bouncers were flashing their damn flashlights at you to get you to move along, like cops at a traffic accident.

Also, as crowded as the place was, in spite of the cleaning staff's diligent efforts, the place had a dirty feel to it.

The other thing is that there are a lot of ""civilians"" at this place - men with their dates, or even groups of single girls dressed up for a night of clubbing. I dunno about this. If this is the new cool place for party people to hang out, okay. I really don't understand it. If I am out with a special lady, I want to focus my attention on her. But that's besides the point of this review. I do honestly think that these people detract from the strip club experience. I go to these places because I actually want to meet strippers and get lap dances from one stripper that I like the most that night.

I have to say I have no sympathy for anyone who lets themself get ripped off at a strip club while intoxicated. That kind of thing you only happens when you bring it upon yourself. Never sign a charge slip you don't agree with! Don't let them push you around! And don't be dumb: you probably shouldn't get drunk off your ass and then show up at a place like this. It's called a gentlemen's club, so act like it.

I'd say the only good reason to go here would be for a bachelor party or some other group activity, where you just want to ogle beautiful women but don't really want to talk to them or get lap dances. This place is not a comfortable place for that.",o1MJGh1sadZ4kn_CNqYNlg,8,1,2,Cjd1a-dp6JGCLrrICaltxw
261365,2013-08-28,1,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"This is a decent club. There were a lot of attractive women here of all nationalities, some were very nice and friendly and willing to talk to you, others wanted no parts of you unless you were willing to go to vip with them. I think, based on the 2 clubs that I went to, this club had more attractive women, but i dont like the vegas style of paying $20 per lap dance with no specials or incentives (like 3 songs for $50 that they offer elsewhere). $20 per lap dance gets expensive after a while and all the women seemed very pushy in trying to get you to VIP. The club is decent sized and in general appears to operate a nice, clean gentlemen's club.

I didn't see much women in there at all, mostly just men. I am not sure I would go back here as i am curious about what other clubs have to offer.",tMrJ0w9CSoB98BDHPYHMyA,2,0,3,zwOjapdU1HDh_HiqmuE5UQ

I love to people watch and I noticed that no one would get a dance when the crappy music was on.

I won't bother rating the girls...they're dancers. They take their tops off. Some nights have more girls than others. Figure it out. ;)

Things to know:

- There is a cover charge. Depends on how you arrive (limo, cab, drive yourself). Locals are free until 8, I believe.

- The ATM *does* charge a fee. It's a minimum of $5, or 10%. Yes, it's a lot, so plan ahead and bring cash.

- If you use your credit/debit card, they will automatically authorize the transaction for $200. Even if you buy a single beer, they will ""pre-authorize it for $200. What this means is you'll have a pending charge in your bank account for several days. Again - bring cash.

- Lap dances are $20. Tips encouraged.

- The VIP room is expensive. Expect to spend hundreds just to go back there. It does, however, afford you a much more private experience with the dancer.

- During the week, happy hour runs until 8pm. Prices are pretty decent for a strip club ($3.30 domestics, etc).

Mostly, just have fun. If you bring cash and go with the proper mindset, this is the best strip club in the city. I strongly encourage you to leave your credit/debit cards at home though... :)",ej3YbX9A-v6THCml1kwp9w,8,1,4,0Y-nkaioNZHAtK2QRFa_iw
502050,2010-12-04,2,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"So my husband and I went to Vegas as a pre-deployment fun weekend. I'd never been to a strip club, and was a little nervous, but this place got good reviews, and the free limo with free cover seemed worth it. When we got there the bouncer was nice, and because it was a slow night offered us a table for $50 instead of $100. (He said its because it was just the two of us.) Whatever, we were there to spend some money, so it was worth it, plus it was near the main stage. They asked if they could get us a girl that did couples, or any other specific type, but we passed, I just wanted to get used to it at first. 

My husband got a drink, $9 for a rum and coke! My bottle (small) of water, was $7. We sort of expected that. His drink was super strong so he was happy, but after that they came watered down. A girl finally approached and asked if either of us wanted a dance, I got one for my husband before realizing that she wasn't really a looker. She had a great body, but her face was a bit of a train wreck (poor husband won't let me live that one down.) I don't know what's normal for lap dances, but she was all in his face which made me a little uncomfortable, but whatever, that's what we paid for I guess. After she left, I passed on my own dance, and we sat quietly  for another 20 minutes. Almost nobody approached us, although girls were happily sitting on the laps of guys all over.

Maybe being a couple made us unapproachable? 

Finally a good looking blonde, a little older though, comes up and sits on my husband's lap. Okay, again, strip club so I guess I'll let it slide. I think she's cute so he asks her if he can buy a dance, she gets excited, then he says its for me, and she says she'll wait till the next song. So she sits on his lap snuggling up to him, then the song changes, and she gives me my first lap dance. It was really short. Afterwards, she immediately jumped off, put her top back on, and tried to get my husband to let her give him a lap dance. He passed, and she got sort of annoyed, and even though I wanted another dance from her, she avoided us the rest of the night. 

This sweet Asian girl gave me my second lap dance. She was much friendlier than the first. She actually seemed into me, and gave a much more involved lap dance. I tipped her, but like the first girl she ran off pretty quickly. The most annoying part was that she was with another  girl, and my husband and I BOTH wanted lap dances at the same time, but she refused to get another girl! She kept insisting she'd do  me first than him, which isn't what we wanted.

Nobody asked if we wanted to head to a VIP room. We might have, but the place was so expensive, we probably couldn't have afforded it anyways.

My main issue with the place was that so many of the girls looked MISERABLE. It was hard to find someone who looked happy. Sorry if I don't want to grab some hot girl who looks like she's been drugged and forced to be here and ask her to shake her boobs for me! The few bubbly girls were already sitting on guys' laps, but the funny thing was, they sat there for over an hour, not doing dances, and not going to the VIP room.

It's still one of the best clubs during the weekend or when they have a Headliner performing, but other clubs have just as much or more to offer.  

The Spearmint Rhino does have some of the better looking dancers in Vegas, but most of them are very unfriendly and their hustle is so obvious that it's a turnoff.  I realize that it's a job, but I'm used to the ladies buttering up the customers and chatting them up before asking for a dance - not asking and then immediately leaving.  Many of the ladies sat by themselves and appeared disinterested.  

My most recent visit was a nightmare.  (I go to Strip Clubs to check out very attractive women, 8+...if you know what I mean.)  On this particular visit, there wasn't even a 7 in the entire club, and I'm usually a bit forgiving.  This is not a knock on the ladies - just an honest assessment of the club.  On top of the disappointment, all of the ladies were cold as ice.  I completely understand the economics of a Strip Club, that's why I walk in with my ""strip club"" roll, but the cold disinterested thing only works for the irresistibly hot women...not for the women working that night.  

I purchased a soda - tipped the waitress.  Nobody came up to me during the 10 minutes that I sipped on my soda, so I left after being in there for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I usually play a game, like ""the next lady to talk to me will get $20,"" but nobody came up to me before I left.  I actually gave one of the dancers a few bucks on my out of the restroom because I can't leave without tipping at least one dancer.  By the way, the dancers on stage were some of the worst I've seen in a while - in terms of attitude.  Some of them actually stood and did nothing because the action around the stage was weak.

A gf and I received free lap dances here, compliments of two guys that noticed us partying. (Aww, how sweet!) 

I had a lot of fun here.  The dancers I met were friendly.  The girl I had started a conversation with me and it was nice to enjoy the lap dance.  =) The seats were comfy in all the rooms, but to get a section to sit, either get there early, or go after a night of partying/clubbing and arrive after 4am.

First off....this place is so DARK! But, lots of pretty girls to choose from at this place, when you see them up close.  From what I remember, ALOT of girls were walking around, asking if you want a dance.  If you decline, no biggie.  They would just walk away with a smile.  It's different with the guys though, LOL.

712281,2008-08-11,7,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"Is it wrong for me to admit that I love strip clubs? As much as my husband?  Maybe I just missed the pole when I was 21 and could have actually stripped/danced to put myself through college, LOL.  That being said, SR is my, oops OUR second-favorite strip club in Vegas.  Only second because it's way too cramped.  It's a comfortable place for couples, although the dancers tend to pay more attention to the groups of men, perhaps not realizing that women are more than capable of dropping every bit as much cash as the guys. Not to mention that many ladies (and by that I mean ME)  enjoy lap dances as much as their male companions.... Big plus:  clean and attended ladies room where you can actually chat up the dancers in the light and invite them to stop by your table if you like. 
Although if you call ahead, they will in fact send a limo for you, I strongly suggest  using your hotel's town car/limo (the valet will hook you up) because using the club's limo can be costly in the time department and you can end up sharing with people picked up at other hotels, which can be a roll of the dice. 
Also, since we're well dressed and tip well, the door-guy-head-bouncer at SR is always happy to find us a great place to hang out, we're treated very well there, so I suggest dressing in something other than jeans (for more than one reason, wink wink) and finding the right guy to grease.
 Pole dancing is very high-quality, these girls know how to work a pole, big time. The exceptionally  good-looking girls are VIP only, so be prepared to venture on back if they're the ones who catch your eye.
All in all, a fun place, very busy and crowded.  Be prepared to either stand or tip well to get a table.  A wide variety of girls, all very attractive.  Many VERY young girls, if that's your thing, you'll be in heaven.",x9g-i1DsB-VjSDGVOdRonA,7,6,4,xZk8lHLTtOA9ZQ4wff_7qg

This place is not bad, there are the girls that hustle, the ones that just do their job, and the ones you just don't want to touch (a rarity though).  I came here with my friend who lives in Vegas and they let us in without cover but had to pay $20 for a two drink minimum which is like a cover but at least we got something out of it.  The people in front of us paid $30 cover plus $20 two drink minimum so I didn't feel so bad.

Anyways, the girls here are pretty much top tier but there are the not so top tier ones that are scattered in the crowd.  One night I was there, I saw one girl who was like 6 feet tall and 185 pounds if not more.  She was standing about 30 to 40 feet away from where I was sitting and I swear she was almost my size.  Like I said, you get some really good ones and some not so good ones but big girls need love too, right?

As for the club, it can be really cramped at times but I guess you just have to get used to it or leave.  Finally, if you call them, they will send a limo to pick you up and you get in for free using the ""VIP"" entrance (read: back door to the alley), just tip the limo guy $10 bucks or some more depending on how many people you are with.",bSY04kIrbB3J9cyNBiKfcQ,3,0,4,6-YfZiF3aBimGDsv94xNfA
801394,2015-12-11,23,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"My memories of this place are hazy because a) the drinking that occurred beforehand, b) the smoke and lighting that provided a photoshop-like effect on the dancers, c) the fact that my girlfriend was indulging me and this was our second strip club visit in as many nights (I'm luckier than you could possibly know).

Here's what I do remember:
1. The cover charge was $45, which seems pretty steep for the opportunity to pay more money for dances and expensive drinks.

2. The dancers were friendly and not overly pushy for dances, and the pricing ($20) seemed consistent. I like consistency.

3. Compared to the place we had been the previous night, the types of dancers seemed pretty uniform. If you're into uniform, you'll probably like it.

4. The aforementioned haze also made it pretty difficult to make out the differences between dancers. You couldn't really see any faces, so everyone sort of seemed like a dancing silhouette.

That night, I learned this: don't take a lap dance when your girlfriend gets up to go to the bathroom. It's in bad form. My defense however is that soon after she got up, a nice young lady who met the physical description that I thought my girlfriend would like, approached me. She asked if I wanted a dance, and I asked if she could just wait until my girlfriend got back. Little to my knowledge (I was informed later) that the dancers and female patrons use the same bathroom... so there was quite a line. My new friend suggested a dance for me while we waited, and I figured that would be OK. My girlfriend returned to find my face buried in her bosom, and seemed less than impressed with my inability to wait 10 minutes for my next dance. When it was her turn, she wasn't in the mood.

Overall, this was a decent place, but I probably wouldn't go back next time I'm in Vegas. I'd rather save the dancing for the privacy of our room (fox trot, of course).",4-rPcExfKVuMaFpsQL9IiA,7,1,3,PmcoTeJRNt5a0VH_7srWig

Stripper: Want a lap dance?
Me: No

Me: Chilling with my friends.
Stripper: Just so you know, the girls have to pay $85 to show up.
Me: I thought it was $150.
Stripper: Ugh! For some, yes, and we only get paid on tips.
Me: That's great.
Stripper: Will $20 break you.
Me: I don't pay women to keep me company. If anything, I expect women to buy the first round.
Stripper: Coming here and not tipping is unethical. You're basically not tipping for a service.
Me: I'm sure that line of argument works on other guys. Good luck and have a nice night. Goodbye.

[Five minutes later.]

Stripper: If you're not going to get a dance, at least don't let the girls talk to you. It's a waste of their time.
Me: Thanks for sharing. Have a nice night. Goodbye.

She had a point, I guess...Then again, those chicks make between $1,000 and $3,000 a night. My free-riding @$$ wasn't going to hurt anyone's bottom line.

Besides, I'm sure the stripper and everyone else working there has had men buy them drinks at the bar - only to disappear immediately. 

Consider me Captain Karma.

P.S. Although that stripper was whack, there are some cool chicks at this place. And, yes, if you're a good-looking guy, you can meet a girlfriend here. Many of the strippers are ""normal"" girls who fly in from other cities to make a quick couple of G's.

Yes, I realize that strippers sell fantasies. Thus, if you're not the kind of guy who does more-than-OK outside of the strip club, don't believe the hype.

For starters, it would help if the first thing that came out of your mouth was a simple introduction, HI MY NAME IS (insert random madeup identity), what's your name? If the first words out of your mouth are 'how about a dance', my first words will be no thanks. Don't bother asking why I don't want a dance from you, no means no!

Damn and what's with all the unhappy looking ladies sitting around on the couches while on shift? Looks real bad, like you're all illegals being forced to work there. No guy would want a dance from any of you, that's a depressing sight. 

Also, don't tell me you hate dancing on stage. Holy crap, you work at a strip club, you're sitting on my lap and you tell me you hate your job. Good job killing the mood and my boner.

1277187,2018-05-02,4,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"Tips for your first time at Spearmint Rhino.

Use the complementary limo service and admission/front door fee is waived. My friends and I called the phone number on the site 702-796-3600, we told them how big our party was and they give you an estimate time on when they'll be at your hotel pick up area. I never paid the front door fee and don't even know how much it is ($50 ish from what I read in the reviews).

The limo is a sprinter that seats 10 comfortably. Clean, smooth, comfortable and quick ride to Rhino. It's free service but each passenger tipped the driver $5. You get dropped off at the back entrance where there no cover fee.  

Dress code (see inserted picture)
I wore a black t-shirt, jeans and loafers. Sneakers are allowed. No sandals, sweatpants or hats. 

At the door they will check ID, pat you down and have a metal detector wand. After everything is clear, you go right in. 

Walking through Rhino your first time will be overwhelming. Lots of seats, lots of girls in lingerie and about 3-4 stages. Rhino is a strip club more centered on lap dances and not pole acrobatics and throwing money as seen on hip-hop music videos and movies. 

When you come through the entrance, the girls know you're new so they link arms with you and take you to your seat. They sit on your lap, ask your name and start small talk. Eventually they ask if you want a VIP private lap in the back. You may feel pressured and persuaded to agree but you can simply say you're not interested. Don't give a runaround saying ""maybe later"" a simple ""no thank"" you is ok. 

If you agree to a VIP lap dance, your girl will walk you to the back. Before you enter, security makes sure you pay the girl $100. Once inside, you have to spend an additional $45 for two drinks, one for you and one for your girl. 

For a $100, you get a 15 minute (3 songs) lap dance - the girl gets topless and you're allowed to touch their breasts and behind. The benefit of VIP is you don't have other guys watching you. No vaginal play, no handjobs and no sex in case you're wondering. The guy's pants stay on and the girls underwear stays on. Just lap dance, topless, touching and grinding. Maybe for a certain price you can get additional ""services"" but I'm not sure about that. After 15 minutes, your girl will most likely whisper to give her another $100 for 15 more minutes. 

In the general floor area, a girl will approach you every 5-10 minutes, especially if you make eye contact. They will sit on your lap and have more small talk - where you from, how you doing, etc. They will either offer a VIP lap dance or a lap dance right where you're sitting. 

A lap dance is $20 per song. Similar to VIP, girls get topless and most girls allow touching but you're out on the main floor with other guys around you. Be clear with your girl how many songs you want. Sometimes they will keep dancing and after a few songs, will charge you for the 3 songs they counted =$60. One thing you'll notice is they're skin is very smooth and strippers smell good, like baby powder haha. After your lap dance, sometimes your girl will sit on your lap and just continue the conversation. A few guys hang out and buy them a drink.

The stages have girls dancing for their allotted time and the viewers pass $1s during their performance. New stage performers are rotated about every 10 minutes.  

Final tips and summary
-bring cash, there are ATMs and a bill breaker booth for $1s.
-have a plan and budget, you'll be tempted to spend more money.
-don't come super drunk, you will end up spending more money that you intend. 
-don't be scared to say no
-use the free limo service and waive the entrance fee
-VIP lap dance $100 per girl for 15mins/3songs + $45 one drink for you and one drink for your girl. 
-Floor lap dance $20 per girl per song.",z5s8n_CYZlWK8-GQDuazxQ,10,4,4,y4j8VuI_T2PMlqNfFC6Aqg

Very comfortable and casual, we sat and had a few drinks and watched the dancers on stage for an hour or so and nobody made us feel too bad about not slamming drinks or getting lap dances right out of the gate. Later we got a few dances from 5 different girls and there was a pretty wide spctrum of what we could touch (us girlies got some GREAT boob action!) and attitudes. I would recommend you watch a girl you like give a dance before you pay for one...attitude and a pleasant spunky attitude makes all the difference for me, but if you just want a 10 you can't go wrong here so you can afford to be picky! 

There were a ton of girls so we in about 4 hours we never saw the same one on the main stage and if you liked the main dancer you can 'follow' them (perfectly acceptable, non-stalker behavior ;) ) to the 2nd and 3rd stages for their follow-up dances. There was something for every one I don't think there was one 'type' that got excluded (except fat ugly b&%$*s but nobody needs to pay to see that...) and everywhere you looked there where boobs of alllll shapes and sizes.

There are little to no cool stripper tricks on the pole.  Apparently, this is due to the slipperiness one dancer told us.  Either way, you're not going to see a cool show if that's what you're looking for.

1491543,2010-12-15,30,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"I came here for my bachelor party and they STILL took all my money lol.

Anyway, I'll say this is the best strip club I've ever been too and all my boys agreed...at least that night. The next morning we all felt like we got robbed $1k each ;).  And when I say felt like...I mean did. 

Anyway definitely call them for complimentary limo service. I went there with a Taxi a few years back, in addition to taxi charge of $20 from the strip, you had to pay $30 admission. Garbage.  We came with a group of 8 guys. Complimentary limo picked us up within 20 minutes (nice limo meant for 10), they will try to sell you on expensive bottle service the whole time you're in the limo. But once you arrive, you arrive at the back entrance and you get complimentary admission (imagine how much that saved at $30/head).  We each tipped the driver like $5-10 per person. 

Walking in most tables are only meant for 3-4 people, and there really isn't much seating except for bottle service. I was told by the front man if we wanted a good table to speak to a host at the front (since we came in the back entrance). For our group of 8 he tried to sell us on bottle service again, we declined and walked back to the regular tables. Then he grabbed us and made us an excellent offer. $200 for 2 bottles of Jack.  We made sure no strings attached. Sure enough no strings attached. The final bill was $200, no tax, or service charge, we had 3 mixers included, the bottles of Jack were actually liter size (so even bigger than fifths), and we were given a huge booth facing the stage, with velvet rope and enough room to seat easily 12 ppl (so more room for dancers). 

Oh and since we did actually do bottle service, they actually did give us a complimentary limo ride back to the hotel at the end of the night too.  So $200 for 2 liters of jack, mixers, a semi-private booth, limo to and from hotel, and free admission for 8 guys...you tell me that's not a steal.


Hell yeah this was the way to go. Tons of booze, our own semi-private area. And many dancers approaching us non-stop with room to dance.  

Prices for dances:

$20  - 1 song on the floor
$100 - 3 songs in a private-ish area
$200 - I think half hour in private-ish area
$400 - one hour private ish area - at this point you have to buy a bottle

- keep in mind I was told that the above prices (for anything $200 and above) can be negotiated such as time and/or whether or not you have to buy a drink for the dancer or not.

What they do on the dance floor and in the private or semi private areas aka champagne room is strictly dependent on the dancer. Some dancers will tell you something is not allowed on the dance floor (such as using your hands), but really she just means it's not allowed by her because other dancers will totally let you do it and even grab your hands to do so.  The ""champagne room"" also varies by dancer and more importantly $$$ spent.  

We all spent A LOT of money here, and honestly for the money we spent we probably could have all gotten a lot more anywhere else. But there's a reason why this strip club is probably one of the best. The girls. During my down time I spoke with a bouncer, he told me on this quiet night we were there (MONDAY NIGHT!) there was over 200 girls working, and they had an employee list of 9000 girls. And seriously like easily 7-8 out of 10 girls here look like models.  Where as in other places you may be lucky to find 1-2 out of 10 who are even decently attractive even to the drunk eye.  

If you're ready to have an awesome time with possible some of the hottest strippers you've ever seen (and be ready to blow some serious $$$). Forget the other places, Spearmint Rhino is the place to go. Hell even one of the promoters of a competing LV strip club told me if you got $$$ go to Spearmint hands-down.

Anyway some tips: 
- if you're unsure just what you can or can't do, it never hurts to talk to the dancers about the (her) ""rules"". They'll usually be straight up honest with you about everything. i.e. keep your hands to yourself, I have control of your hands, etc.
- Get there before 3 am, one of the dancers told me most of the (hot) girls leave by 3 am...then you're stuck with girls who just look hot cus by that time you're wasted already.
- Bring cash, and leave your damn credit card at home, just make sure to bring enough. 
- Pre-funk a little before you show up, drinks here are expensive (as anywhere in Vegas)
- Although there's no real dress code in a strip club, it never hurts to dress nice and appear to have some good hygiene if you want to get approached by more girls. BTW just fyi Slacks are made from much umm...softer and thinner material than Jeans...

The girls work very hard in an effort to get you into a VIP room (Prices vary in these rooms)  I suggest you avoid these rooms as they are a rip off.  Fun times can be had while remaining on the main floor.

The cover charge was $20 but it included two complimentary drinks. Once we were inside the place was PACKED. You had to fight your way through a sea of people (mainly men) to go anywhere. Unless you had VIP reservation sitting down was simply not an option. The club was extremely dark but that did not stop me from admiring its classy design. 

We grabbed our drinks and just decided to walk around and explore. The majority of my high rating stems from the girls. They were all incredibly hot. And this is coming from a girl.. I read a review below of some girl saying the strippers were busted and she couldn't pick out a single attractive one. This is pure BS!! This club allowed me to be SUPER picky and still have a great selection of girls. I had two lap dances.  First lap dance was my very first ever and she was picked by a friend, cute girl, very friendly but not my ideal type. Nevertheless it was fun, I was drunk. She asked me not to be shy and grabbed my hands on her breast as I awkwardly stroked them.  It was a fun experience. We somehow ended up with Spearmint Rhino Tshirts..I don't know.

I also read below that the bouncers were assholes and rude which initially made me leary of going there. But I must say that no one in there was rude to us.

Yes, the drinks are watered down an expensive. Come drunk
Yes, it is incredibly packed on busy nights, so expect to stand around a lot unless you're VIP or buying dances.
Yes, some girls will refuse a regular dance and insist she only does VIP. Cool, good thing there are 100 other girls in the club just like you.
Yes, if you act like an idiot or harass the stripper the bouncers will kick you out.

I liked the variety of the girls, friendly attitude of most of the girls and the fact that they all seemed couple/girl friendly. I will definitely be going back for other special occasions and would highly suggest this place to anyone looking to go to a gentlemen's club.

1771002,2007-06-20,24,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"I'm very conflicted about my rating for this place.  It's a douchebag haven, but then again what strip club isn't?  This place does have that little extra douchebag flair that sets it apart from the rest though, which is usually enough for me to head over to old standby's like Olympic Garden when I am in Vegas.  However the report came in that OG has gone the way of douchebag city itself and so it was that a group of us found ourselves giving the *Rhino* a whirl on a Saturday afternoon.

Being that we came during the day the usual douchebag and drunk twit element was thankfully absent.  We pretty much had the place to ourselves and if you can't have fun with a bunch of people that you have in one way or another bonded with over many a drunken night, then who can you have fun with?  But would the place have been quite as fun if it weren't for us making the place fun?

We took over an entire section of the club, drank the day away, and enjoyed the company of the ladies working the day shift.  There wasn't a whole lot going on up on the stage except for when Zen and a couple other ladies took the stage.  Most of the action was in our corner as the ladies would come by, chat it up with us, and the occasional lap dance was had (or bought for an unsuspecting victim).  Several lap dance cherries were popped and the theme song for this field trip could have easily been *I'm in love with a stripper*.  Some wallets were emptied but I luckily got away with only a $45 bar tab.

Things to note:  $30 cover, 24/7, for men and women.  They also have a policy of not allowing in any unaccompanied females AND there must be at least a 1 to 1 male to female ratio in order for the womenz to get in.  One guy can't bring in 2 or more girls but a gang of douchebags can carry in a barely concious drunk frat girl that they picked up at Tao with no problems.  This is not to say that they don't have good reason for this policy.  Concerns about prostitutes and having the place packed with women who *generally* don't tip the way men do is bad for business.

I came back on Sunday night with my partner in crime for the weekend because he had to see Zen one more time before we headed home.  I was a little worried about heading back during prime douchebag time but figuring it was a Sunday night rather than Friday or Saturday I thought I could manage.

Our trip there was a bit crazy being as we were driven there by a crazy blind old lady who talked a mile a minute.  She was trying to suggest we go to another *more fun* place on the sly without actually coming out and saying the name of the place or what it exactly was.  The best part of the ride was when she waited for minutes at an intersection in the hopes of having a car pass by so she could follow it's tail lights down the street...because she couldn't see!  Then when we got to the Rhino she passed up the proper taxi line out front and tried to get us to pay for the cab fare.  I have never paid for a cab ride to a strip club in Vegas and never will.  Cabbies get paid good F'ing money to take people to strip clubs, and they are paid by the person not by the ride.

My friend spent the night getting better acquainted with Zen while I enjoyed a steady stream of drinks and the occasional lap dance.  There was some great pole work going on that night though so I had plenty to watch on stage.  Before we knew it the clock was approaching 4am and we figured it was probably time to get back to the room for some sleep.  That's when two of the craziest strippers I have ever encountered intercepted us and basically assaulted me on the back couch.  It was a great way to end the night and the weekend.

- Free limo service from the strip. The limo is classy but sketchy (jet black with a small silver rhino slapped on the side) and the driver looks like a pro wrestler on roids (aka if you act stupid in the club, he can and will murder you).

- The space is huge. I think we walked through four or five rooms before arriving at our ""table"". Someone mentioned that 300 girls work here every night and, after seeing the size of this place, I believe it.

- Be prepared to spend. The drinks and ""dances"" are expensive, as expected, but what irks me are the service charges and ATM fees. Try to avoid these at all costs.

- Bathroom attendants. Again, this is expected but by gawd do I hate them.

In summary, if money and dignity are of no concern to you, then pack your wallet full of cash and get on the next available limo. If not, then find a more family-friendly money pit on the strip.",uTDxT-lAVI31gBg9Fgz8hQ,16,10,3,hIsOedr2um9KXh2nWLLvTw

Limo service to the club awesome! The food from the little menu was good as well. And the women where hot ok there was like 3 really hot ones but still they were all pretty nice. The only girls that were actually missing were the ones that were thick like Serena Williams thick, Buffy the body thick, Mya O'lovely thick, Angel Melaku thick, I'll even throw Amber Rose thick in there but there was one in there that was a Coco/Amber Rose blend. 

The girls were a little aggressive for a sunday night but I guess when you got to get that money you got to get that money.  My only advice to you fellas is to walk to the ATM one time and walk alone.  Things can get out of hand in the big boy room and the champange room.  

Oh I can also add that some of the service/waitresses should be stripping as well cause man there was this one thinker than normal! I was asking for a dance with every drink she brought to me; yeah I was wrong for that but I was nice about it and left a generous tip. 

Back to the dancers. The dancer don't get completely nude thank the goddess Aphroditie's for that. I say that because you can drink and you can neogiate the type of dance you get and what can and cannot touch but you didn't hear  me say that.

The Rhino is my favorite destination in Las Vegas, between its great customer service and insane selection of girls, I don't know what more you can ask for. Whether you re a high roller who's gonna buy bottles and do VIP service or just an average Joe who wants to sit at a table and eyeball some T&A (keep in mind I've done both.) This place is perfect for you.
I found atleast 9/10 strippers to be quite friendly and well mannered unlike some of the money grubbing animals you re guaranteed to find elsewhere. On my last trip to Vegas, I came here three times, the first two we had bottle service and I enjoyed myself while slumped over in the vip section talking to some rather overly friendly albeit lazy strippers for atleast a few hrs, spending little to no money on dances. Never once was i pressured to spend more to maintain my sweet spot or overcharged for anything. (Note my credit card was declined here once when it was tried on the 2nd nite here, but Im sure this speaks more to the volumes of identity theft protection afforded to me by my bank then any sort of problem with the Rhino.) The last time I went here, after being thoroughly tapped out on my trip by all the overpriced food n drink elsewhere on the strip, I came to the Rhino to spend my monday nite in my favorite watering hole. Accompanied by my friend and armed with no drugs, we each killed many hours here waiting for my flight home, We picked up mulitple numbers, that neither of us even asked for and by the end of the nite, one piece of work ended up in our hotel room. Quite impressive considering it was a girl who got literally not a penny out of us. Points off tho for her horrible lip job. 
The BEST part of this establishment is the attitude, girls want you to slap their asses and grab their tits, security makes sure its loyal customers are well taken care of and the pretty lil waitress always makes sure my drink is sitting on a napkin even when im constantly picking them up to wipe my hands after fondling each girl. Whether Straggler or VIP room girl, almost all were willing to stop sit on your lap and chat while you caught a feel. Compared the Customer service i received at THEHotel, this place set the mark in making you feel welcome and at home while on vacation!

However, I feel obligated to review this place. I am not typically a strip club dude. I find them to be demeaning for women and frustratingly pointless for men. Plus, for some reason, I always slip into Doctor Phil mode, and I end trying to analyze what happened in life to lead this girl down this particular path and how I can stop my future daughter from going down the same path. 

At this particular location, though, all my reticence went out of the window. I have never seen a more stunning bunch of employees. I wish i could remember some of the girl's names but between the alcohol i consumed all day (and night), the thumping music, and the fact that i paid very little attention to anything above the neck the whole night, I can't help you.

 It was my buddy's bachelor party and the club sent a limo to pick up all 12 dudes. We arrived at about 10 pm and since we were the only dudes there at that point, we were immediately jumped by beautiful women. I successfully declined the first offer for a dance (one of the more difficult situations i have ever been in) and decided to post up at the bar where no girl could claim my lap as unexplored territory. Since i am a generous dude, (and boobs were involved), I ordered some drinks for the girls at the bar. Embarrassingly at this point, Wells Fargo decided to activate fraud protection and limited my access to my money, and I couldn't actually pay for any of the drinks i ordered or any future dances until i convinced Wells Fargo that i was who i said I was. Needless to say, the boobs that were being tossed around so carelessly quickly disappeared. I didn't mind, however as the ""private"" dance that any person pays for in the general seating area is done in the same area and a non paying patron gets the same enjoyment as the dude who paid. 

If you enjoy strip clubs and you go to the Rhino, you made a good choice. I would caution you, however, to bring cash, as several sources told me that almost all banks decline your card when used here.",RaX6ByaVSm0hkaS8LmjknQ,9,4,4,D1Mvtclx58IXqT2EEE9TkQ

""I, TY, solemnly swear that I did not engage in any lewd or unfaithful conduct while in this establishment. I did not once pull out my debit or credit card or even any bill larger than a twenty. I swear this on both my right and left nut. NOTHING HAPPENED.""


Anyways, the forty-five dollar cover charge is kind of in the next galaxy. You get 1 drink with this. When you enter, you are immediately greeted by a bevy of attractive young ladies who want to be your girlfriend right?
.
They make it clear that you're not cheating and that it's just fun when you tell them you're attached. Good to see that they're willing to be my conscience. That's going the extra mile!

Of course, their friendly demeanor is meant to lure you into the VIP room. They start by telling you it's cheap. Then when you lineup, they say the 30 minute deal is much better at two bills because the one bill deal is just a quick in and out. I'm so glad they're looking out for me and trying to get me the most for my dollar.

And, when you finally decline, they demand a tip for their time and stomp off, looking for their next mark.

The best deal is sitting at the stage with a pile of dollar bills. Drinks are titillating, starting at fifteen bucks for anything.

The women are nice looking, the layout is ok and they seem to have most jerks under control.  If you typically wipe your butt with hundies, then this place is for you.

The funny thing is the cab driver, on the way back to the strip, informed us that we could have gotten massages with happy endings for a lot less than here...",EqvZzBMZW8hlO51k7YLe5w,13,3,3,a6SJLC_Ht3MteFT3z5D2dA

Ahh Spearmint Rhino... I've been dying to check out this topless gentlemen's club after hearing about it several years ago from a former co-worker of mine who won their annual Super Bowl pool.  I arrived at the club at 8:30pm on a crowded Friday night; while I don't normally review clubs on the weekend, I was in town for the Adult Entertainment Expo and wanted to see how much excitement this club had to offer.

Before we continue, however, I need you to be mindful of two very important rules about Las Vegas gentlemen's clubs:

Las Vegas Gentlemen's Club Rule #1: Las Vegas Gentlemen's Clubs Can Be Overwhelming!
The biggest and best gentlemen's clubs in Vegas are MASSIVE!  Take your time and don't let yourself be easily overwhelmed... most clubs are open 24 hours and the larger ones can have hundreds of dancers working at one time.  Take your time, relax and enjoy!

Las Vegas Gentlemen's Club Rule #2: ALWAYS TAKE THE LIMO!
What I'm about to say isn't going to make much sense, but just hear me out.  If you walk into most Las Vegas gentlemen's clubs off the street, expect to pay a cover charge of $30.00 to $50.00.  However, if you're at a hotel (if not, walk to one nearby) and request a complimentary limo ride (even if it's only you and nobody else) and admission to the club is usually FREE!  You'll just need to tip the limo driver as they work for tips (don't be cheap!).  Oh, there's just one catch... it's usually free transportation to the club but not FROM the club.  Check the club websites and plan your transportation accordingly.  Do your homework and you can save a bundle... to spend on the hard-working dancers, of course!

Location & Facilities - 5 Stars
At over 20,000 square feet, Spearmint Rhino is one of Vegas' largest gentlemen's clubs.  The club is located between I-15 and the Strip and is close to Treasure Island, The Palazzio and Wynn Las Vegas.  Although Spearmint Rhino is located in a large facility, the club interior is focused on one main pole with lots of seating around the pole as well as booths around the interior walls.  There are a variety of rooms and booths available throughout other parts of the club designed to accommodate any crowd, party or occasion.  The DJ plays mostly rock and dance music, while the limited flat screens around the two spacious bar areas keep your attention focused on the dancers.  Although not for use by the patrons, Spearmint Rhino has a dancer supply store on premises which offers a wide assortment of lingerie, bras, panties, shoes and much more.

Staff - 5 Stars
From my friendly limousine driver Jimmy to Calvin, the awesome men's room attendant, the customer service at Spearmint Rhino provides an unparalleled level of customer service.  As with many of the Las Vegas gentlemen's clubs, I was escorted in by a door greeter to a seat where I was promptly assisted by a lovely waitress.

Food & Drink - 4 Stars
Spearmint Rhino offers a wide variety of liquor options as well as your standard import and domestic beer choices, but unfortunately they didn't have any craft beers on hand.  The club provides bar food fare (cheeseburgers, wings, etc.) every day except Tuesdays.  The club offers a variety of bottle service packages ranging from a $225.00 couples package up to the $5,000 Rhino VIP Party #2 which includes two premium bottles and round-trip limousine service to a top nightclub along with Rhino Girls to party with for up to ten people.

Dancers - 5 Stars
Being at one of Las Vegas' top gentlemen's clubs, it's no surprise that you'll encounter tons of gorgeous ladies eager to entertain the throngs of tourists that flock to the club daily.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a diverse mix of women, even though there were hundreds of girls in the club that night.  Prepare to be hustled hard, though, as those hundreds of girls are all vying for the attention of as many of the guys as they can.

Value - 4 Stars
As you'd expect in the heavily tourist-infested Las Vegas area, expect to pay a premium for drinks.  I forked over $14.85 for a rum & orange juice, one of my go-to drinks if I'm not in the mood for champagne or beer.  Couch dances are available at $20.00 per song and are out in the open, but be sure to keep your hands to yourself.  Champagne court prices range from $150.00 for a 15-minute champagne court with a two-drink minimum to $1,000.00 for an hour.

Website & Social Media - 4 Stars
SpearmintRhinoLV.com has a simplistic yet elegant design and provides information about their location, entertainers, bottle packages and awards.  I didn't see any links to social media on their website, but Spearmint Rhino can easily be found on Facebook and Twitter.",LxcFFRrg45pcKbFa4d8dgw,18,6,5,XzsgRNtl9nVvGNw90aI45Q

2366172,2013-07-18,21,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"Yelp HQ found my original review in violation.... *Reposted and Re-edited. Here we go:

I have been blessed with so many experiences at many different strip clubs all over the west coast but this one, due to the high quality and variety of girls, definitely takes the cake. Since I'm a strict vaginatarian, I usually don't bother with topless strip clubs but with the many recommendations I got from fellow weekend warriors led me to make an exception. There are many, sizzling hot, chill but aggressive in their approach, seductresses to fall in love with here that will quickly empty your pockets in exchange for at the very least good conversation, fake compliments, and a somewhat validated ego oozing and dripping with man juice.

*******The hefty price like the $27.50 cover charge for this kind of poison can be curbed by gathering up 4 or more friends and calling in for the free limo service that also gets you in free. I only wished I was aware of this at the time.*********

My second time here at this very pricey establishment was not quite on par as the first time. Maybe it was because we came on a Tuesday night which according to some of the strippers I tried to woo, it was slow but seemed busy enough to me. Not too crowded, not too empty but just right! My first time here in August of 2012 we came on a weekend night. It was bliss as me and my two friends were overwhelmed with a non-stop river of flirty advances and multiple lap dances from a variety of opiate addicted dime pieces from practically every shade and flavor possible on this great planet. I still have the fond memory of this south american latina literally purring in my ear while she rubbed up on my cash and prizes. Instantly my tent was pitched! This time, however, every seductress, it seemed, was more about the hustle with just about every level of sassiness you could imagine whenever I politely rejected their requests. Some even stayed and chatted it up for a bit. Since I only had a couple twenties left I had to be very picky and did not want to waste their time. I'm so impressed at the level of game and swagger these girls operate at. It is nearly impossible for any straight man to say no. If the accent or the dangling of their plump assets near your face don't get you, a touch on your inner thigh followed with the lure in their voice will have you soon entangled in their web. 

******Bring cash. Pay with cash. DO NOT USE PLASTIC. Leave all your credit cards and debit cards at your hotel. ATM service charge is $40.********

A Rum and Coke and a Red Bull Vodka was 40 bucks. WTF! According to the waitress, who, as you can see, was scamming us as much as the strippers were trying to, there is a $50 minimum when using a credit card so I opted to leave a tab open. In hindsight leaving a tab open at a ""gentlemen's club"" is by far one of the stupidest things I or anyone could choose to do. I gave them my card and, upon request, my ID and, luckily, the waitress came back saying their machine was down or something to that effect so I decided to just pay cash. I have a strong suspicion I'll be seeing some extra charges on my card. We shall see.

Obviously, do not come here with anything less than 150 bucks. With cover charge, drinks, and cab fair you'll be deep in at least 50 before you even get a dance. I made this mistake and came with only about 90 bucks and quickly I was down to my last couple of twenties and I hadn't even got a dance yet. Luckily I had a friend to spot me a few twenties or I'd have to start doing private dances myself.

After my friend returned from his ""private dance"" smiling with his face covered in snail trail, we decided to bounce. We fended off all the last attempts and advances to drain our pockets even further and left at around 5:30am when the sun was coming up. It was a beautiful exit back into the real world. A limo driver offered us a ride back to our hotel for 20 bucks so we hopped in. The limo was a short limo, not that that made any difference on me cause y'know size doesn't matter (lol), and the driver drove crazy fast, whipping around turns like the dukes of hazard. Luckily, we arrived in one piece but our blue man marbles were not only throbbing from the buildup but also shaken up from the crazy limo driving.",1zcBlRlLxI8tSqKAh3NvFQ,13,12,4,mcNPrx7XtnNJDiIYNsDJIg

1) If you're coming to a strip club, I hope you're not ordering food as that is not their specialty.

2) I will have to say, there are some very good looking girls here at this place. 

3) The drinks are about $20 a piece for liquor and the dances are about $20 a song.

(Haha, my big 300th review is for a Vegas strip club)

Call the club's limo service to get the pickup, VIP entrance, no cover, and no security check - all you have to pay is the $20 tip to the limo driver - no matter how many people are in your party.  And it was the full stretch limo to boot.  We actually also had a good conversation with our driver, and we were treated like celebrities at the entrance.

I went here for a combined bachelor/bachelorette party of sorts the night before an afternoon wedding.  We had a lot of fun.  It's SO crowded though on weekends, so it pays to come early or you will never find a table, even if the limo driver gives you the name of the guy doing the table seating.  I have never seen so many girls working at a strip club in my life - the place was partly overcrowded because of that alone!  The service we got was great the entire night, and the girls that we talked to (although not many approached) were the type who enjoyed the company of girls better than guys  (I don't blame them).

Most of the girls have fake, hard boobs, though, which isn't so appealing.  But it's Vegas...and you know what that means - very close to Southern Cal.",MCDwKJOOiMyhJKC86kHJmw,2,1,3,IggwEAfYO_zaQmd40lQtFw

Friday April 22, 2011
5 a.m.

This place was packed on an early Friday morning. 50+ Girls; 100+ Guys; $22 Cover.  As I walked in, I was greeted by a stable of girls wanting to give some lonely guys some companionship for $20 a dance.  I finally understand why guys like these types of places.  The girls approach the guys instead of the usual guy approach girl club scene.  The guys get the right to refuse the girls based on her physical attributes without remorse or public scrutiny.  If the girl is too short, too tall, too fat, or not fat enough in the right places, the guy simply can say ""nope.""

However, this establishment was by far the most depressing place that I have ever been.  The floor was sticky.  The lights were too dim.  The people on both sides of the love seat were seedy.  All I kept thinking was how these girls started exploiting themselves for $20 at a time.  How does one become a strip club worker?  People always respond they make good money but I ask at what social, moral, or physical cost.  Sure I could make a lot of money shooting people or selling drugs, or even legally by convincing old ladies to donate their life savings to some half-ass cause, but again at what cost.

Later, I saw a 35 year old lady essentially begging patrons to allow her to dance for them for $20.  It made me think ""Sure the money is good when you're young but then you don't develop any other skills and you get old and less attractive and you earn less and less and then the club kicks you to the curb and then you get a graveyard shift waitressing job at the 24 hour Denny's where you have to serve the same drunk guys that you gave lap dances to 10 years ago.  I am not religious but I pray my daughter never becomes an ""exotic dancer"" whom gross guys proposition for lewd and lascivious acts.  

On a lighter note, the bar was great with relatively cheap drinks.  The security guards left me alone since I was constantly drinking to avoid the great sadness in my heart for the Sodom and Gomorrah type behavior that I was witnessing.  I only spent a Hundred Dollars on admission and 10 cocktails and one $6 Bottle of Water. $100 was nothing in comparison to some of my compatriots, some of whom gave upwards to a $100 tip for a $20 dance.",L7VEJP1RrpXRRRWsYIu3tA,10,11,4,_MqO9WZ7d1cWuz2jMyBwKw

The girls are for sure the hottest of any of the clubs in Vegas though.  And the few that are not too scared to talk to a woman gave good dances.  The VIP isn't as private as some other places, but that's possibly due to how packed it is in there.
We hung out with one of the dancers a couple of days later, she was really cool and a great girl.

I also watched many of our gentlemen friends fall in love, and have their hopes of a family and life with the strippers crushed the second they saw ""their stripper"" talking to the next guy.   Too much of an emotional roller coaster for me.  Ill just observe, thank you.

Stiff drinks, a variety of ladies, and a dark room make for an enjoyable day for anyone.  Just don't freak out when you leave at 6 in the evening...and its still daylight.  Give your eyes time to adjust.  Chances are you have a long evening ahead.  I mean...you are in Vegas.",eu19K9KfnvvubzWuv4l6Wg,7,6,4,pN7mY04llUVwI-1Eptmj0g

So we're at this bar earlier in the day.  The bartender there informs us of the greatest idea ever - you put the bachelor in a white shirt (wife-beater), and get a sharpie.  The idea is to see how creatively you can get each of the dancers to sign his shirt.

Anyway, we found a girl called ""Peaches."" She was pretty. But pappy was skeptical. ""What's your real name?"" pappy inquired.

""Samantha"" she replied.

But this isn't a review about how awesome I am to go to strip clubs with.

The Rhino was definitely fun, though.  We went during March Madness so it was PACKED and we luckily were able to snag one of the last tables in the place. Despite their obvious crowd of testosterone fueled NCAA fans, the girls still came around to our table of two couples VERY often and were super friendly and cute. I shared a bond with them because apparently my legs were stripper-smooth. I guess strippers have the monopoly on super smooth legs and when they find a girl that cracked their code it's like we're all in some kind of secret society together, which I obviously will take as a compliment.

I can't say anything for how much anything cost (as it should be when it comes to women going to strip clubs), but the fact that my date paid for everything and then said it was the best time he'd ever had makes me feel like it was fair. I will say that if you come here, bottle service is probably worth it. I can't imagine having as good of a time without a table and the way drinks are priced everywhere in Vegas, bottles usually don't end up being much more than what you'd pay to drink all night anyway.

The manager said it was ok and then all of a sudden after I was changed and on my way out they told me that I was fired. To top it off, they told me that unless i payed a 50 dollar house fee they wouldn't give me my sheriffs card back which I need to work anywhere else...

2933799,2011-03-07,88,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"I love art in all forms--paintings, sculpture, poetry, song, and dance.  I am a ""FIRM"" believer in supporting artists because they try to tell us a story--through their eyes.  On Saturday, my friend and I stuffed our faces with bacon wrapped hot dogs at Echo Park for Javier's Bacon Wrapped Goodness UYE.  Afterwards, we had nothing to do and thought why not go out and support our starving artists--it's all about giving back.  Lets go to Vegas!!

Service - Woohoo! As good as it gets! + soft and silky skin
Cleanliness - Ambiguous
Price - Enough!
Seafood - Yes, some people refer it to that.
Meats - Yes, yes, yes!!
Vegetables - I think this costs extra.
Dessert - Yes it is.
Fruits - Forbidden fruit?

What was ordered:

""Stoner"" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Anglo artist told me that she works better inebriated.  I was interested enough to purchase her body of work for my friend--who was also inebriated.  As Stoner revealed her art, she yelled out ""And they are all natural!!""  I am ""technically"" a doctor since I was a Biological Science major as an undergrad and I have some expertise in human anatomy.  The mammary were indeed natural and quite a stunning pair.
 
""Ms. Foodie"" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Asian artist hails from Arizona and is a recent transplant to Las Vegas.  Her and I had a thorough conversation regarding food.  She loves food trucks because the food is so tasty, cheap, and is convenient in her line of work.  ""The Foodie"" also loves breakfast and a big fan of dumplings.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of art is all natural and very inspiring--Frida Kahlo would love her work.

""Frisco"" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - ""Frisco"" is from the Norcal region--San Jose to be exact.  I told her I went to school in Sacramento.  ""Frisco"" found it amusing that Sacramento rhymed with Frisco.  She chose the name Frisco because it sounded sexier than San Jose.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of work is all natural--and all so buttery smooth.  ""Frisco"" told me she is selective with her clients--must be my innocent eyes.  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to go find her later.

""Brazil"" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - ""Brazil"" comes from the lovely country of Brazil.  She loves soccer.  I told her ""Soccer?!  You must mean ""futbol.""  She was very impressed that I knew that--Brazil told me that my name is spelled Joan in Brazilian--accent on the ""a.""  I asked her what is her favorite food in Brazil and she told me bbq meat--she goes back once a year.  I am a giver so I purchased one of her bodies of art for my friend.  She loves to dance to all kinds of music.  I was too busy perusing Frisco's catalog to notice whether Brazil's art was natural or not.

""Mexican Fusion"" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - The young and innocent Mexican Fusion is from Anaheim as well--lucky me.  Her friend was putting on a show and invited her to come along this one night--she didn't have to drive so tagged along.  This artist is a fusion of Mexican and Spanish--her father is from Spain so she gets her light complexion and dark hair from him.  My guess is that she got her body from her mother--lucky me.  She also likes to dance to Trance music.  Mexican Fusion's body of art is all natural--lucky me.

I can already imagine the responses to this review--""Where are the pictures, John?!""

Don't bond with a stripper right before you are going to get a lap dance.  Knowing about her kids, drug habits, preference of deoderent and relationship with her father does not make the dance more erotic.  I felt like I was getting grinded on by my slutty younger cousin. And that's weird.

3020564,2018-02-15,3,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"I'm not sure what these other reviews are hating or even crying about for that matter.

Yes, it is a $50 cover charge per person, which might seem steep but it's worth every penny. Especially if you just do some damn research like my girlfriend did and find free one-way transportation to the club and included cover charge being paid for. Why? Because they want your business and if you're willing to be picked up and go through the hassle of doing some research they want your business (and money of course). 

Also, users are complaining about false advertisement for a free limo service. You get picked up in a nice van it's not a creepy van. And besides, you get a FREE ride to the club. Plus our driver told us if it's not too busy, limo drivers outside of the club are willing to negotiate transportation back to your hotel for as little as $20.00.

Moreover, upon entering the club, I didn't get a ""run down"" vibe. I'm not a professional strip club attendee, in fact I have been to one other club before and it was a horrifying experience (Thanks No Thanks Dejavu).

This club was off the strip, which can be somewhat inconvenient but Lyft was only $6 for transportation to a hotel on the strip, which was almost 3 or 4 miles away.

The drinks were $19, which is standard for a club or high end bar. Besides, those complaining about a $50 cover charge, shouldn't be at a strip club if you're concerned with $50. It's LAS VEGAS and a high-end establishment.

There were some women I did not find attractive but there were not any ""disgusting"" women here. There was a variety of talent and women here. My girlfriend and I waited until she found a girl she liked and we made sure we got her.

The private room was a reasonable price at only $100 TOTAL for both of us that included 3 songs with a drink purchase requirement of spending $60, so we bought two for us and one for our performer. It was WELL worth every penny. You just have to be open minded, not creepy, and patient. Don't be afraid to say no thank you to other strippers offering dances.

All in all, this was an incredible and very memorable experience. We had what I believe was the best dancer in that place and out of respect for her I won't say names but she knows who she is if she is reading this.

Anyway, I digress, if you're on the fence about going or second guessing this establishment based on bitter reviews, climb over the fence with a stack of bills and get to this club. You will not regret it as long as you are respectful and don't make a fool of yourself.

SIMPLE GUIDELINES FOR A 5-STAR VISIT TO THE RHINO:  

RULE #1:   You will NOT pay for the cab ride to the club. 
And you won't call the club limo either, otherwise you'll be waiting for an hour.  See my review on Checker Cab for how to wrangle a free cab to the club. http://www.yelp.com/biz/checker-cab-co-las-vegas#hrid:kQxPgIbCxjvXnbGI1pEIHA 

RULE #2:   You will dress intelligently.
- No white.  You'll look like a biological stain under the blacklighting.
- No company logo-ed shirts.  I don't think your company will appreciate the advertising.
- No cloth coats.  It'll be infused w/ smoke & useless for business meetings tomorrow.
- No cameras.  ""What happens in club, stays in the club.""
- Bring your ID.  Don't be the jackass w/out ID that I have to babysit because you got stuck at the door.

RULE #3:  You will go into the club knowing where your money goes.
Ladies will try to convince you to drop another $100 because they're 'struggling to pay the house fees'.  Despite the fact that this shouldn't matter to you, here's what I understand:  
-- Dancers make anywhere from $300-$2500 a night.
-- If they're new they need to buy a $250 dancer's license from the State of Nevada.  
-- At the end of the night, each girl has to 'tipout' or pay cash to the club for their opportunity to dance on the premises (aka house fees) equaling ~$150 to the mgmt, ~$50 tribute to the DJ (to 'misplace' their name on the 'list' i.e keep them off the stage), and usually some $$$ to the bouncers.  There's an extra $10-$20 tip that goes to the VIP Doorman for each 'customer visit' to VIP. 
-- VIP sideroom is $100 min - 3 songs.  VIP Champagne room is $200 - 5 songs.  Celebrity Room is $400 + Bottle Service. This brings us to one of our most important rules...

RULE #4:  You will NOT go into the ""VIP rooms"".
You're already a sucker for coming here - why make it any worse?  The VIP room is a contract that you're going to pay for a minimum number of dances - there is no upside to this.  Contrary to the booze talking, you aren't going to get anywhere in there.  Anything you've heard are lies.  You'd be better off paying for 3 songs on the floor & buying a dancer 4 shots of Patron @ $10 each.

RULE  #5:  You will NOT use the club ATM.
No credit cards either.  Bring your own cash.  As with all clubs, the ATM has a club vig of 10% on whatever it is you're withdrawing, not to mention being the ""podium of shame"" that you'll find yourself at while ""Sapphire"" stands there as you withdraw your frickin' 401k.  Having to go to the ATM is the Lord's way of saying, ""You've gone way overboard, son.""

RULE #6:  You will NOT spend more than $100.
Any more & it probably could have really been better spent.  And for gotsakes, don't try to expense this.

RULE #7:  You do NOT buy the dancers drinks. 
(Sorry girls.) The ladies have to sell 1 drink per hour ""for themselves"" at $12-$15/each.  This is how the club makes money.  They aren't usually interested in getting drunk; selling drinks is part of their job.  You need to grab your balls, look the waitress straight in the eye, and say, ""NO, THANK YOU.""   You'll undoubtedly convince yourself however that the dancers ""are friendly & really do want to get drunk.  This leads into...

RULE #8:  You will NOT be fooled by virgin drink codenames.
If you're still dumb enough to buy a drink for a dancer 'cause you think ""she's cool & wants to party"", listen for the following terms:  ""Rum & Coke Lite"" = Coke only.  ""Slipknot & Cranberry"" = Cranberry Juice.  ""Screwdriver Fresh"" = Orange juice.  All cost $14. Get the picture?

RULE #9:  You will ALWAYS ask 'how much' before the dance.
I'm responsible for you so don't get taken.  Ask immediately & show you've got a pair.  Some girls charge $30.  Others $20 or $40.  If they tell you anything other than $20, cock your eyebrow & reply, ""Okay then.  One dance only.""  You may find that this suddenly changes the price to $20.  This goes to motivation since they just want 1 guy for an extended period - 1 dance here & there isn't how they're going to make the house fee.

RULE #10:  You will NEVER stiff a dancer.
Don't make me have to pay for you.  If there's a possibility you might do this, read ""Stripped"" by Brent Kenton Jordan - the biography of a Vegas club bouncer.  Here's the short version for you degenerates:  Club wins - you lose.   Or club loses - you really lose.

RULE #11:  You will tip security $20 for 2 open seats. 
Save yourself & your pal the time of finding a chair.  Bouncers make money too off of finding ""VIPs"" seating in the club.  This $20 grease suddenly makes you a VIP & is worth dropping if it keeps you from having to wander the club aimlessly looking for some group to get out of their chairs.


CONCLUSION
If you follow these simple rules?

You know a trip to the strip club is in order whenever you're in town.  This could turn out to be quite an expensive endeavor.  However, I'm here to tell you how to go to the club and not spend as much money as anticipated.  I mean, yeah, it's fun to make it rain on the ladies with Rick Ross blaring over the loudspeakers, but we're not all sleeping on a bed of money like Floyd Mayweather.  Now let's ride...

Cover is $30-35, but you can get in for free and get a free limo pickup if you call the club and ask for it.  They'll send a driver to come get you.  Make sure you tip him before entering the club.  Furthermore, you enter through the back and look like a local.  Coming to this place in pumas and a Carolina blue Nike running jacket will also cause the bouncers to believe you are a local, but I digress.  Call the club, have them pick you up in stretch vehicles, then use that saved money on the talent!

It's a huge venue with tons of girls ready to $boogie$ on your lap from all over the West so there are tons of pretty ones there (I heard up to 300 on a weekend night) to make up for any grenades or land mines.  It also can get very crowded on the weekends around midnight.  Just be careful - you get too wasted you might wake up with a $2000 credit card bill and your watch missing.  My PSA for yelpnation.

I feel like I've revealed too much of myself here.  I didn't even tell the story of how I sat in Drew Barrymore's entourage and watched her go to the champagne room.  Or how my old roommate lost his glasses in one of the chairs there.  I'll save that for XXXYelp After Dark.",rzpbbpb_oBW42aJxL6ixlQ,10,5,3,hhbUN5390WnShHloensbxA

If you are looking to see some Ladies in Vegas, and you want the best looking ladies, go to the Rhino. Other places have full nudity (Rhino does not), cheaper drinks, and lower covers, but nowhere will you be ass satisfied. 

After a three day weekend in Vegas of which i found myself here twice, here are my suggestions for you first timers (or even experienced members). 

1. Avoid 10PM to 2AM. It gets a little too packed. 
2. Bring cash, don't use your card there. 
3. Leave your credit card in the safe at the hotel. 
4. If you are not interested in a dancer that comes up to you be polite and say no thank you and move along. If you are interested, feel free to cop a feel. They won't mind. 
5. Don't bother getting a $20 dance in one of the main seats on the main floor. Better deals to be had. See #6 & #7. 
6. Spend your money wisely and get 3 dances for $100 in one of the dark corner booths. 
7. Spend your money even wiser at $200 for a half hour or $400 for an hour, and sit in a dark room with drink service. There is LOTS of fun to be had with many of the ladies at that point. Belts magically come off, zippers occasionally open, other things inappropriate for Yelp can go flopping around. You will be amazed. 
8. Be nice to the ladies, they will reciprocate. 
9. If you roll like this, get a private booth for your friends with bottle service and a large security guy standing out front blocking everyone. See how the donuts really get made. 
10. If you really, really, really want something else, its Vegas, talk to the lady. They don't call it Sin City for nothing and there is a price for everything. 

Go with your boys, go with your lady, go with your wife, go alone. You won't be disappointed.

Well, due to the type of work I do (laser hair removal) you can see how this industry makes up a large chunk of my clientele. I support my clients in whatever line of work they're in.

So back to the review... we have always been take carer of here. We always get the best seats at the stage and our cocktail girl comes by every 2-3 minutes to bring us a new round of drinks and change out the ashtray. 

drinks are strong (I dont know prices because we dont pay) but I know you'll get your moneys worth.

The dancers arent over-aggressive and they strike up good convo .. they're actually pretty smart and well-versed.

The stage has a pole and 2 dancers dance at a time for 3 songs (stage dancers take tops off on 2nd song)

The bathroom lade (mom) has a good selection of necessities and keeps the bathroom super clean. 

On the nights that are more low-key, we go to the champagne room and order steak and eggs at the private bar. Food is better than you can expect at a strip club.

I like it, and I'll be back to support my clients at least once a week! come join me ;)",ZEq0WtRJD9Bl_vYgCsbfOg,15,13,5,fEe9xlmE-fUwv4I7TDbjzQ

Cover was 22$ a head and as soon as we stepped in, there were amazing hot girls left, right, up, down, from every direction.  As I led the way to the full bar in the back, I was approached by Asian porn star Nyla Thai.  She was extremely friendly and I was excited since she was the first girl to come up to me and I knew exactly who she was.  I was porn star struck.  She then delivered here sales pitch about going to the back room for a private show and it would be 100$ a head for 15 min, and 200$ for 30 min.  She began to pull me in that direction, but I told her politely that I want to get a few brews for the fellas.  She was persistent with her pitch, and explained we could get drinks in the private room.  I wasn't to sure how this worked but then I told her that we just rolled in and want to relax for a minute.  She was understanding and then let me a the crew be.  The girl to guy ratio was at least 1 to 1 or even 1.5 to 1 that night.  As the night went on, several girls randomly approach you and first try to sell the 100$ 15 min 200$ 30 min private show.  I asked them about a dance for a song, and it was a mere 20$ a dance.  I was all for that since you could get several dances with different varieties.  I had an incredible japanese hottie that caught my eye and she obliged with the dance and took me over to the side on the booths.  She was very accommodating and let me grab all over except of course down under.  I would say the dances are well worth it.  Some of the girls leave it up to their own discretion about where and what you can touch but for the most part, they do not mind you grabbing anything except for down under.  My advice, grab a drink or two, engage in some conversation when the girls approach you, ask if they offer a dance if she is worthwhile.  Some offer a single dance for 20$ but others will not do lap dances or will want minimum 3 dances for 60$.  All in all a great time, would definitely go back again when in Vegas.

My friends and I went to several nudies while there but I had never been to the infamous Spearmint Rhino so we decided to get all dressed up and check it out on a Saturday night. We get there and there was a small line out front, get up to pay and holy Moses they wanted $25 stinking dollars just to get in. Against my better judgment I paid the cover and walked in. There were hot ass girls everywhere; I mean lined up against the walls on the stage every freaking where!!! It was also very very crowded. We had only three people in our party so we started looking for some place to sit, ya right!!! All the seating was VIP and it required bottle service prepaid at $150-200 just for a spot on a crowded velvet couch with who knows what crawling on it. The place is super small for that many dancers. I needed a drink and so we walk up to the very packed bar. I order a Long island holy shit it cost me $18 good God this is too rich for my blood. The girls dance to one song and then switch and the songs are cut down to pretty much just the chorus as to get them off your lap sooner because the dances are only $25 each which seems like a good price until you find out the song is 2minutes long, I would rather go somewhere where the girls are a 7-8 but you get treated like a 10 and this is not that place!",Ur0VkKdIoV7YFZcMmIRwKQ,3,1,2,FoB-WESafs2W_Y4O17f1Hw
3181664,2008-08-25,7,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"Ok, first of all, what is all the hype about for the Spearmint Rhino?  I've been to quite a few strip clubs in my lifetime and this one is at the bottom of the list.  I've never been to a strip club which didn't even peak my interest!  I would never want to go to Spearmint Rhino AGAIN!  Why?  Read the following . . .

So my friends and I entered in the establishment with my hopes up high since I've heard such great things.  We had to check in our cameras at the door, which is understandable.  Once we walked in, there is a bar to the left with a small stage.  Instead of making a left, you can go straight forward and there is a large stage with a bar to the right.  If you go further down the room, there is another bar with a few small stages.  Here's why I would never want to go there again!

The girls there are not that attractive (or at least as attractive as I thought they would be), the venue is almost pitch black (which makes it more difficult to determine whether a girl is hot or not), there is a ""western saloon"" feel to the place, no neon lights (which is a standard for great strip clubs), absurdly over-crowded, you have to pay to sit in a chair (yes, you heard me right, you have to pay to sit down) and you will have a bouncer that will constantly bug you that you have to keep on walking and there is no standing allowed!  WTF is up with that?  I have been to slummy strip clubs such as Garden of Eden in SF and I'd rather go there than Spearmint Rhino.  

I would not go to Spearmint Rhino again!  The only reason why I didn't give them the whole one star review was because the girls weren't that bad looking.  I say 70% of the girls were cute.  If the Hustler Club in SF had those girls in their club, I would be homeless.  As Martha Stewart says, ""It's a good thing.""",vg64AHoj5SIIdVdtDY_-Fw,11,5,2,XRDM8DALeb031tCNnuhZJQ

If you've been to strip clubs before there is nothing surprising about this place except for the sheer amount of girls that they have working at any given time and how hot they are. 95% of them are 8s (on the man rating scale) or better. 

The reason for my 3 stars is two fold:

ONE - that their lap dances are done ""by the song"" or in reality whenever a song changes. You'll drop money on a girl to only get half a lap dance. There are other places with better timed systems but something like that I think would subtract from a spot like this. The girls are so causal and low pressure but they won't play dumb if you give them a ""no thanks"". It's super casual and the girls will make you feel welcomed and comfortable - tip them!!

TWO - I'd say one in 10 of these girls knows how to give a great lap dance and one in 20 can actually work a pole on stage. The majority of these girls are just hot as balls after a jog on a summer day. If you want to see the hottest girls in Vegas - come here. If you want to get a quality lap dance or see a girl even attempt to work a pole, you may want to try a place that focuses more on that. And when I say attempt, most girls will swing around it like a nervous girlfriend dancing for her boyfriend for the first time.

i have no idea what to expect out of LV strip clubs but, this place is a joke.
if youre not the ugliest person on earth you are better off finding chics to entertain you elsewhere.

by all means, if you *are* into braindead high school dropouts on possible drugs with fake breasts THEN this place is perfect for you (of course a generalization)

how this place still exists goes way over my head.

disclaimer:  my review is about Wednesday night

the parking lot looks packed. $22 cover per person (apparently they seem to offer free limo and admission?)
small place is packed with people sitting around. few ""premier strippers"" giving lapdances in full view of everyone else. security walking around. usually have table minimums of $400 from what i understand. drinks are $9 red bulls $9 coronas and up. hell with the overpriced drinks - this is vegas after all. 

ok, now the best part: i would hardly call what the girls on stage are doing ""dancing"". sometimes a girl on the side stage just stands there. there is no actual entertainment a person who hasn't drank 10 shots could possibly get out of them. a girl will come up to you every 15-30 minutes and offer to give you a lap dance. these dances cost anywhere from $10 a song to $20 a song. sometimes a girl has the nerve to demand tips on top of that. it's all only topless so you are paying crazy money to see women's breasts.

if somehow you get dragged into their ""vip"" area some kind of magical shit goes on in the back there for 400/500 an hour. $100 for quick fun? who freaking knows i think the girls make up whatever shit they want to.

quick summary: if you get drunk there you are screwed. your wallet will be empty and if you happen to use a credit card i'm sure when you wake up the bill would be close to $5000. if you are not wasted you're overpaying for the night's entertainment to see breasts (possibly more).

for all those people who would think i'm just ""cheap"" or don't understand the ""vegas culture"" or something i tell you.. with the amount of money wasted at this joint you are better off having 5 escorts in your room. it'll prob wind up costing the same anyways. alternatively, you can get a pretty girl to massage you naked for 24 hrs.

As you all know strip clubs aren't cheap..here's how to maximize bang for buck! 

FREE COVER! 

1) Call the club directly, let them know you need a limo and what hotel you are staying at. FREE RIDE (but don't forget to tip)

2) They will usually drop you off by the back entrance and simply ask the host for any bottle deals. I gotten anywhere from $99 for a bottle or 2 for $150 of Belvedere. (FREE COVER)

3) Girls will FLOCK to your table like no other! 

______

As with any strip club, I recommend handling everything in cash as it can get PRICEY. And when you involving drinking and girls...it can get all bad!

The girls will talk to you about private room, and I remember it being $200 for 30 min with a 2 drink minimum (~$20 a drink) and sometimes the girl will ask you to tip the bouncer a $20 (aka her and the bouncer's cut). Private room is actually a row of booths secluded in the back and it can get kinda HOT depending if you build a connection with that girl..DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH A STRIPPER *T-Pain voice*

More or less, the Rhino is a super laid back spot. Majority of girls here are super chill and aren't as aggressive as other clubs (in terms of pushing sales). The food here (bacon cheeseburger and chicken tenders) are actually REALLY good. Give it a try!

My favorite to go here is in the afternoon or early evening. Perfect for an afternoon if you don't feel like gambling or going to the pool party. Happy hour bottle deals are up to 8pm, so you can get liquor'd up and head back to your room to get ready before you decide to hit the town!",SmHCmowr7X1LvOKs7z4nyQ,33,14,5,xKk0wu3KqJ5-tecZE8zMHA

I do.

3573747,2007-07-28,2,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"The most common question that a group of guys will ask a cab driver in Vegas is: ""What's the best strip club in Vegas?""  The answer is the Spearmint Rhino.  This is a town where the newest mega-resort is king, and yet the adult entertainment industry doesn't always follow the same trend.

So what makes up a good club?  You need a lot of girls and plenty of seating.  The Rhino has both - but you'd be surprised at how few clubs in Vegas do.  Most of the new clubs just don't have the staff to ensure a good experience, and a lot of the old clubs are just not worth the effort.

Advice for first-timers:

- If it's really crowded, a large tip to the host will get you seated at your own table immediately.  Depending on how busy it is and how large your group is, expect about $100-200.

- The VIP or ""Champagne"" Room is much more expensive than you'd expect.  In addition to the $400/hourly charge, you'll also have to buy 4 drinks every half-hour and tip the waitress and the host in the room.  That will add another $100-200.

- Yes, you can use your credit card, but you'll be slapped with a 10% fee.  Even worse, the dancers have to pay the house a 10% fee in order to redeem your chips - so your $100 in Rhino Chips will cost you $110, and the dancer will only get $90 out of it.

- Watch your friends.  I'm assuming that you aren't going to a club alone (that would be sad).  And I'll also assume that mass quantities of alcohol are involved.  So watch your friends, because there's ALWAYS that one guy in the group that will disappear for an hour and spend more than he intended.

- If you want a good time, don't expect any kind of ""special treatment"".  The major Vegas clubs don't allow anything illegal.",tvjL4BErlkBNsSyLjkEzFg,8,3,4,ObsMycnFdI80N1bP8K1fDw

I must be the first man to ever fall in love with an ass
gonna bend down on my knees,and ask that ass to marry me
that booty makes forget about any chick i been wit in the past
cause we got a lot in common she's a stripper i'm a freak
makes me wanna grab it i have a habit,I gotta have it
they call me the man of steel cause that ass is like a magnet
damn you got me so in love,can't stay away from this club
every time I find my self rollin' up on them dubs
I've been around the world,see booty all the time
I never seen a booty,so so preety,so so fine
comin' down the pole,no secret why I'm here
cause girl you keep my donk on swole,with a drop drop with it
pop pop when it hop hop baby the way you doing that thang with it don't you stop stop,
I wanna stick it,wanna kiss it if I could I'd put my whole damn head in it,i'm in love with a stripper",JI7qprx1g6HC3BqKCMOtdA,7,7,5,7mRa84f61lcqvVH0ex-cFg

They have to be good if they wont allow you to make RSVP for a table, as its first come first served.

Getting there.
If you can call ahead and have the SR limo pick you up you're golden, but call during prime time, and it'll take an hour and half wait. Just get a limo from your hotel, and pay the $30 cover, you just have to live with it, and remember don't pay the limo driver, he's getting plenty already.

The place is super crowded on the weekends, and the only way to enjoy yourself is to get table, even if you find an open seat they'll make you get up if someone is willing to buy a bottle. Kettle One was $375 a bottle, and you might as well get it since you wont have to wait for another drink or fight through the crowd at the bar.

Its dark in there so be careful of who eventually ends up on your lap. The girls know their mark, and if you're asian ALL the asian strippers will find you, and if you want some other flavor just tell one of the Dudes in suits and they'll start sending the people you want your way.

Remember, be strong, and know what you want. They'll make you feel like a million bucks, and get ready to know what your name is, and where you're from because you'll be asked that ALL night long.",CRlIhFoFQZQPw0GAU65YsQ,3,2,5,UBA2bUTGbPnlp96DCR0WCg

The place was swanky enough, had a $30 cover, $20 for a lap dance and was $7 for a beer. For a strip club I guess the pricing wasn't bad. I expected more though. More allure and entertainment, and perhaps a bit more seductive. Color me unseduced.

The reality is, I am not a strip club kind of guy. Maybe it's being ushered in to internet generation but I don't think I should have to pay to see naked women. Nor do I need to pay to recieve attention from women (in and out of relationships I tend to do okay.) That and none of them appeared too enthralling. It's no surprise women at strip club appear fake, but hey they're just doing their job. I guess I just prefer the more intimate nature of a bar.

Funny, you'd think having half naked women around you might feel more intimate.

All that being said, it was still a lot of fun. When you go with 20 of your Yelp friend you can always make the most of anything.

And what is up with the Disneyland line for the VIP section in the back? The stripper was trying to hustle me into the VIP, which was fine because at that point I was down so much from gambling that I could not give a single F*** about how much I was going to blow at the Rhino.

Let's start off with their free limo service, do it.  You are saving a ton of money.  Just makes sure to tip your driver, we did $20.  Verse $44 entry fee and a taxi ride.  I went here because a good friend of mine highly recommended that I go here, because one of his friends feel in love with one of the girls...LOL.  So I thought, meh, let's see how talented these girls are?  

Getting into the venue is super VIP status, if you take the limo service.  Now the tricky part, if you don't have reservations, you'll most likely won't have a place to sit.  We were lucky because staff allowed us to be seated shortly in a reserved spot.  Once the group showed up we had to get out of their seats stat.  From there we were able to snag a few chairs around the dance floor.  The main stage rotates 2-3 girls every 2 songs.  As the night progressed, I witnessed some amazing girls work that pole.  I was thoroughly impressed.  Since I'm a girl and I'm straight, it's not shocking for me to see a girl with her top off, hello locker rooms!!!!  I found it more shocking how the men treated the girls, but I had to numb myself to that.  I know it's all a fantasy.

Drinks are costly.  Run $12-20.  The mixed drinks were weak, I recommend that you get a beer.  At least you'll have a slight buzz part of the night.  Lap dances run $20 per song +tip.  Some of those guys must have brought a ton of money, because those girls were dancing on them for a LONG time!!!",vXrUBAIN4aoCt7F5p0kU_g,22,14,5,b2e_UdvZr_aCuxV7kwZKTg

Do not attend a Vegas Strip Club with your brothers and/or male family members.  Under any circumstances.  No ifs, ands or butts.  Just don't.  Seriously.

It's awkward.  And upsetting.  And awkward.  

Little did I know that while my cousin Lauren and I watched our respective brothers get lapfucked by a pretty pair named Pilot and Perfect, that our benefactor had already paid for us to get our own laps snizzed on by Mercedes, a tight little tan blonde.

She sauntered over, asked the boys of the group that weren't busy getting jacked in a backroom somewhere to buy her a redbull (redbull is stripper cryptonite) and then sorta draped over us...

And that's when we both got felt up. 

Mercedes:  You guys both have really big boobs!

Rachel and Lauren: ...

*Stripper grabs our boobs*

Mercedes:  Are they real?

Rachel and Lauren:  *nod simultaneously* 

: |

Mercedes:  Mine are fake.

Rachel and Lauren:  *shock and awe* You don't say?

*Rachel and Lauren get the hell out of Spearmint Rhino*

Getting felt up without dinner or even a drink purchased for me beforehand felt wrong, but watching my brother enjoy a lap dance a little too much was enough to hurtle my nice seafood dinner out of the depths of innerspace onto the floor.

I'll give it up for the strippers super soft skin, though.  It's nice.  And they smell good too.  Lauren and I are thinking about creating a perfume called ""Stripper"".  It will be a blend of cucumber melon and coconut nectar with glitter.  Lots of glitter.

Anyway, I had friends in town from NYC for a bachelor party, and they wanted to go to the Rhino.  I'm a local, so I get in free, so I figured I'd join them for an overpriced beer and good conversation.

Do they try to play you? Absolutely. To the point it sickens me.

Funny as it can be, this would be the only time that I go out, that I can turn down women left and right.

Since we had a section reserved for us, we did not have to pay cover to get in. Plus we had 1 bottle of champagne for us.

After walking in this darkly dim lit establishment, a women immediately came to me to try sweet talk me into going into the VIP room. I declined, as I just want to settle in before the ladies of the night try to brisk away my hard earned money.

This place is a bit too dark. I have been to other establishments like this, and they aren't as dark as this place. I can understand some women may feel that they don't look that attractive in the light, but that is beyond the opposite of what 99% of men think. When we see a basically nude woman, looks don't matter too much.

The size of the place is small in my opinion. I feel claustrophobic when I'm trying to navigate.

Besides that, the ladies here are very attractive and definitely turn you into a child walking into a Candy store. Many flavors of different sizes, but also cost a lot of money to get what you want.

We came here because our friend is getting married, and what better idea than to check out a strip club.

The women here I swear are reading a script to me, when they try to push aggressively the $230 dollar private dance with 2 drinks. I just want to relax and at my own whim, choose and spend wisely. The 99% of us are not that rich to blow money on them or anything in general. Treat us well, and we will treat you back well.

I did end up finding a lovely and nice lady for a dance, and noticed a friend of mine next to me getting a dance. Great, we're both having a great time.

Well it didn't last too long, because shortly after that, the dancer that my friend had, had basically tried to extort money from my friend. He had assumed (bad, right? Never assume!) that someone had paid for his dance. Once she finished, he had thanked her, and she demanded cash for it. She did not go up and present herself and asked if he wanted a dance. She had walked up and immediately gave him a dance. 

I know, it's Vegas.... never assume anything is free or ""taken"" care of. That immediately ruined the mood for my friend.. once he's moody, it kinda ruins everyone else's mood.

I don't like how some of them would assume he's a novice and take advantage of the situation. This reflects poorly on the establishment, and the trust with the customer. There is never a need to do that. Because in the end, the customer loses. Had we not have the cash in hand, I bet he would of gotten beat up by the bouncer.

Lost all business as well as personal reference, I will send them somewhere where my clients no matter what sex they are will be appreciated by clients.",9dd0C3KQD6Gq-hiE-w9nKA,46,6,1,9SCJLwzDQ7FWK3KkbmpzBA

I try to hit up a strip club in every city I go to and when you think Vegas you think 'glitz' and 'glam' and you think of the best. The women were gorgeous, no doubt. But they were the same women you would find in any other club around. That wasn't really the sad thing for me though-I appreciate all women. It was the club itself. Very lame. Kind of ugly on the inside, really drab, and the atmosphere sucked. Not at all what you would think of when you think of Vegas. The Penthouse in Detroit is more beautiful and glitzy than this one.

4012385,2012-04-14,26,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"Hi friends!  No, not you the readers or yelpers that I like to eat with but some of the ladies I know personally that surprised me when I saw them working here!!  :D

Spearmint Rhino has been an excellent experience every time I've been here.  They are easily ranked within the top 3 best Gentleman's Club that I've been to and they really do put almost every other exotic clubs to shame.  The experiences I have had here has been flawless every time.

My most recent visit was for a friends bachelors party weekend.  They had plans for the evening but when I went to visit them (around 3pm) at their hotel room in the Aria they looked bored.  I made a suggestion about pre-gaming elsewhere and for them to trust me.  Only two people, the bachelor, and his designated driver were somewhat sober enough and able to trust me, so we went to the Rhino five people deep at around 6pm.

Pro Tip:  Happy Hour is from 1pm-8pm, bottles are $100 (and beers were $3).  No cover as long as you drive yourself there or get the limo ride.

Thinking ahead, I ordered a bottle for the five of us and another bottle close to the cut off time and had some more seats reserved.  I predicted correctly that his friends would be trickling in (because the bachelor didn't want to leave) and we were there until close to 6am.  ***The bouncers, waitresses, and dancers were really cool to us.  I think a manager was there helping us out big time too, some Hawaiian guy.  But make friends with them and they'll take care of you.***  For example, while the night was going on and some people in our party would go to the VIP room or to the bathroom, guys from no where would try to grab the empty seats even though it was tucked under an obviously occupied table.  With the manager and waitress always checking in on us, grabbing an extra chair, getting a drink, or being introduced to a dancer that you had a preference for wasn't so hard.

The women here are some of the finest you'll ever find in a Gent's club and they always play along to your corniest pick up lines like ""You know what's the fastest way to a women's heart?  Their boobs, hehehehehe"", but they're natural flirts themselves and most are nice but you have a few feisty ones.  I thought it was funny how some of them escorted the men to the atm, that's why you can't spend all your money on just one girl.  I like to position myself so I have a good view of center stage, try to do that too especially if you're hosting your friends and don't intend to get dances for yourselves.  Some girls work in pairs, watch out for them because they can drain your cash quick.  And do bring cash, no plastic cards.  

The only shady part I felt  was the waitress.  Not all of them but when they switched shifts and we had this new girl and all of the drink prices were jacked up like crazy.  Her prices did not match the bar, it was almost $4-$6 more than what they would have charged.  Was she self-tipping herself??  I tested my theory and went up to the bar to get another drink (and beer) and it didn't match the price I ordered from the waitress.  Even if I'm drunk I still don't get bamboozled, sorry.  

When I thought about it though, walking up to the bar to get a drink wasn't bad because you were able to talk to a couple of the dancers, watch the solo girls on the smaller stages, keep an eye out on your dream girl, measure your awareness level, find out your friends are dancers here and introduce yourselves with stage names and the awkward moment when you act like you're going to introduce her to your friends but pay for a dance instead.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,31,19,5,Ky61PnXbgSkGDChAOwIwyQ
4017081,2012-06-14,1,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"Spearmint Rhino is what it is. Boobs everywhere and about a 9 to 1 male to female ratio, excluding the dancers of course. Me and my friends called for a limo. It was about 5 guys 5 gals. Some people on here are saying you get free admission if you do this, but this was not the case when we arrived. it was 22 for ladies and and higher for the boys. The bouncers outside were friendly, but once I got in the bouncer inside was a huge douchelord. Maybe they don't actually want women coming in; that's what it seemed like from his attitude and the girls taking cover.  I also wasn't a fan of the cover charge.  Sorry but 22 bucks is too much for something I could get from looking in the mirror. Luckily our guy friends paid for us :P

Looking around, most of the girls were pretty decent looking. A lot of fake boobs which I like. I dont want a lapdance from a girl with smaller boobies than mine!  A couple of girls were downright disgusting such as the donatella versace look alike and a couple girls that we were sure were post op trannys, but most were pretty and sexy.  The place was pretty big, but seating was no where to be found, especially for 10 people. One of the security team guys told us our best bet was to buy a table, but no one in my party wanted to do that. We wanted to drop our cash on the girls not a dumbass table.  

After standing around for about 15 minutes I started feeling really uncomfortable and getting pissed off. I paid 22 bucks to get in, I was in heels and I wanted to sit down and get a GD lap dance!. That's when one of the dancers approached us and asked if we wanted dances. I made it clear that we just wanted a place we could  all sit down.  She must have been desperate or something bc she took us all over the club picking up and moving seats around until we made our own little seating area. I was most definitely thankful for that. Her next words were ""okay I found you guys seats, now you are getting dances"". The guys happily obliged and bought themselves dances as well as a couple dances for the ladies. She was very nice and fun although I felt like I should be gettin some of that tip the way she lifted my dress and started touching my crotch haha. We got a few more dances from other girls and left around 8am. The bouncers were cool about calling us a limo and making sure we all got home.

Oh I almost forgot, one of the girls asked me when I was working tonight.. excuse me? ha

BUT other then that here's my review coming from a girl- a girl who loves strip clubs and the strippers that hustle her out of her money. 

came with a local guy [ my friends work buddy ] while he was handling the valet sitch we walk in to the front [ 4 girls its about 4-5am?? drunk after club hopping] and get told we CANNOT ENTER without the presence of a male escort, 
WTF!??!?!? i will slap the sh*t outta you hoe. 

WTF not? i ask oh so belligerently and obviously politely =] 

because we have to make sure your not here to work the room. 

We i get it i mean yea hookers are legal here- 
smart idea pick up on some turned on guys rarin to go and offer them discounted prices to leave now and not give it to strippers.- i understand so we wait til our ""male escort"" comes up 

but what if he is our pimp? doesn't THAT make a little more sense? THE lamest rule i have EVER heard and i am sooooooooooo glad we had him with us or i would have poss. went to jail for ripping the rude front door girls weave off after being told we can't come in just cuz we also have vaginas. 

anyways. after hearing the absurd rule we are ordered to pay $50 bux each for entry- this includes your 2 drink min. 

WTF?!? okay so i have heard of high prices before for entry- even had to pay $20 bux once or twice maybe even thrice but $50? geeezus. 
Oh well it included your 2 drink min. which was AWESOME because that INCLUDES booze! whoohooo! but with the booze comes the panty rule boooooooooo. drink booze= no nude. FINE! grrrr. 

luckily our local friend didn't have to pay and footed the bill for the 4 of us because he had recommended this place to begin with. So yay! 

the chicks are really hott. Like really really pretty and def. worth seeing. 
BUT 
the buck stops there. 

no pole tricks- so disappointing. I am a sucker for pole tricks and i was super bummed about not even seeing 1 single trick after being there 2 hours. 

got a lap dance courtesy of my friend since i was so bummed about no tricks. 

she did it right there on the couch in front of everyone which was OK i guess but being a girl i felt a little strange knowing that i had 60 eyes glued to me with awe and lesbian fantasies. 

and i felt a little weird when the guy down from us got his on the couch in front of everyone too- its hard trying not to look hahah. 

the girl who did my dance was cool, nice, clean, fun, but she kept repeating ""wow "" over and over and i had to pinch my girlfriends leg to help from totally busting out laughing at her. It was super short and not very good but eh i was drunk and didn't pay for it to begin with so whatevs. 

the club itself is HUGE lots of diff. little areas- didn't get swarmed on to bad by guys- they mostly left their grabbin for the dancers which is always appreciated. Just one group of douche bags from some foreign country who thought it was okay to follow us around and be annoying. 

ps. also the first time i have EVER ordered food from a strip club [ I'm laughing even thinking about it now hah but it was 6 am and we were wassssted] we got some sort of appetizer platter and it def. wasn't one of the worst i had ever had. hahah 

but yea 2 stars only for how hot the strippers were and for the booze factor.

As stated you should always call them for the limo pick up, it saves you the cover charge, which is a hefty price for looking at nekkid people.... they actually aren't even full on nekkid.

It was dark and crowded, my friend went to get us some drinks and we were invited to a special V.I.P. viewing platform. The two Jack on the rocks were $20 each and they were heavily watered down. 

Once we were seated two young blonde women approached us and began to talk to us about whether or not we wanted to talk. I had previously filled in my friend that this would lead to them asking to provide him with a lap dance and instructed him to tell them kindly that he didn't want any company. We both dismissed our visitors and I sat sipping my watered down drink until my cohort had soaked in the surroundings. He watched and whispered about how funny it was to see the man in the front row have a woman's crotch rubbed all up in his face. Eventually he decided that he found none of the women attractive and that he was not thrilled about the experience. I told him when he finished his drink we could leave and so we did.

For 40, you can get TWO hotties to repeat, wings, boobs, dance, sit, pretzel.

Went to this place on a Saturday night, which was packed just as expected. And as anyone who's been around the block would tell you, when the demand goes up, the strippers' true colors shine right through. This is a big club with poor lighting and a very greedy ownership. 

The girls are rather rude and unless you are willing to wave your checkbook to get their attention, they simply have no time for you. A typical stripper normally operates by putting on a charm and talking you into having dances just so you would feel special and enjoy your night; however, at this place if and that's a ""if"" they come up to you, they say: ""want to get a dance? no, get the hell out of my way...."" Nobody likes that sort of attitude. 

If you are not lucky enough to find a table to sit at (which btw, costs an arm and a leg and a decent amount of ass kissing), you are forced to stand around and get harassed by the security that wants the ""roads"" open even if you are leaning against the wall and there is enough room on front of you for a 300 lbs person to move right though.

When I finally found a girl that I liked, she said she had to get on the stage and her manager didn't agree to let her skip the stage so I could have a couple dances. Customers are a priority at this place....NOT!!!

The dance area is a bit of a joke too. The girls talk a lot about the private dance area, but trust me when I tell you this, there is nothing private about the dance area which costs $100 for 3 songs. You will have more privacy and space in a prison cell since you will be sitting in a room with at least 10 other dudes sitting closely next to each other getting ""private"" dances.

So the ownership gets a big fat F for creating an establishment that has little respect for your entertainment and is out to squeeze you for every dime you have while offering you not much in return. 

Unless you are a serious high roller who is there to spend a couple G's, you will be leaving this place with a sore behind rather than a hard on. Do yourself and your buddies a HUGE favor and hire a few strippers to come to your hotel for a fraction of what you will end up losing at this place.

I'll sum it up for you.
Cab + booze + cover charge + table charge + dance charge + inconvenience and hustling = $$$$$$$$$$.

Your hotel room + your booze + your choice of dancers = $$$.",06nvMytGvUEG3l4go2mGmQ,13,2,1,K5e9mLJ0mbXDrlCODZ9x-g

Let's start with the place, extremely dark! So, how can you watch the ladies when you can barely see them?
 
The ladies, boring to say the least. 
No pole work and low dancing skills, on top of that they're rude..if you don't like couples or girls be polite, don't just say ""whatever"" and walk away like we are nothing, that's offensive! 

Service, the service is ok for a busy place and the cocktail server was very polite BUT they tried charging my husband's and friend's card for $200,00 each when our bill was $40,00 and we DIDN'T  want to keep an account open (we told our server that).
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM? 
Of course they both had their cards blocked and had to spend over 20 min on the phone to get that taken care of.

The girls, while most of them were very hot, were very very pushy about lap dances and didn't let us relax.  I was here with my boyfriend, and we felt bombarded with girls just out to make a buck and not put much effort into the dance.  I asked a cute blonde to give my bf a lap dance, and after making sure I knew that it cost $20, she gave him the most boring, unenthusiastic lap dance I have ever seen.  Wow.  She might as well have been filing her nails during it!

Girls who were on the stage dancing would come over to you if they saw that you had money out, but as soon as you gave them $, they would actually leave your area and go to someone else with money.  It's my experience that if you give the girls money, they dance in front of you for thirty seconds and then move on.  Not so here.  Also, there was one girl who (not to judge) had a giant gut and could barely walk in her heels.  Not great eye candy for such a highly recommended place.

There was one other issue I had, and that was that most of the dancers there seemed more interested in me than in my bf.  I didn't mind the attention, don't get me wrong, but we weren't there for me, and I felt a little bad for him in the end.  Girls - don't assume couples are there for the girl - give the guys a little love too!

This is a clear cut above all of the other strip clubs I've been to before. Leaps and bounds above. Pee Wee League to the NFL. A friend of mine and I call up the FREE limo service to pick us up a the hotel and drive us to Spearmint Rhino. The driver was nice, talkative but not annoying by any means. We get escorted right into the club with no cover charge (a benny of the limo service.)

Seats were more than available and we were instantly immersed in a horde of beautiful women all more friendly than the next. A cocktail waitress kept our drinks topped off all night (7 bucks a pop, pretty reasonable for a gentlemen's club)

Now, I've gotten a lap dance or two in my time but the way these girls acted just to get you to buy a dance was better than any lap dance I actually paid for. I know the drill with most strip clubs. Keep your hands at your sides and be a good boy. Not here at the Rhino. I was told over and over to put my hands on their ass, to feel their chests, breasts shoved into my mouth and then I get told that I'm shy!!

I'm sure there are girls who are selling a little bit more than just a dance as there are plenty of VIP and private room rates for a pretty penny. The girls can sniff out money, as they were flipping over my tie to see which designer it was. You'll get the occasional one that just comes up and straight up asks for you to pay for a dance...decline them, they aren't working for it. The ones worth it will give you a preview of the lustful dance to come.

The best part of this place? There were AT LEAST 100 girls here at one time. I would say a better guess would be 125-130. I asked one of the dancers if that was EVERY day and she said that on big weekends there could be as many as 200 there.

I even went to the Spearmint Rhino's counterpart in Santa Barbara where I went to school. Every time I've been to a strip club, I've always felt like scum. The last trip to a strip club was so bad I sat and waited in the car.

However! This is VEGAS. Of the many times I visited Vegas, I always wanted to visit a strip club. The past few times, my friends had reservations about going to one. blah blah blah. Excuses excuses.

After a trip downtown for some cheap booze, gaming and food, I drove back to the Luxor where we were staying. On the ride home, I was a little disappointed that we were heading back at 2:30. A friend suggested we go to Spearmint Rhino. We all looked at each other and gave the nod. You know the nod - the kind that's like ""I know exactly what you're thinking"".

Got in line and waited for a couple minutes, paid the 30 dollar cover and walked in. I was amazed. I didn't feel dirty or ashamed to be there. I thought to myself that hey, this can actually be fun.

We all sat down at a table and relaxed, my friend had the 'unfortunate' seat in the aisle. I never seen women hustle so hard to get some money in my life. It was literally every 30 seconds he got propositioned. hahahah.

Aside from that, we had a lot of fun there. When we left at around 6AM the sun was coming up. Now I can say that I've been to a strip club in Vegas. As for next time, I'm not ruling out another visit, but I'd much rather be at the nightclub. Good times nonetheless.

4848551,2018-05-24,15,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"QUICK & DIRTY: They fly in beautiful women from around the country to dance at Spearmint Rhino, and you'll likely spend a mortgage payment and then some there.  
*****
No joke, I may have injured my rotator cuff by throwing one-dollar bills all night, lost my friend for five hours, and lived one of the craziest nights of my life. Spearmint Rhino served as the exclamation point to a disjointed, drunk sentence that was my friend's bachelor party weekend.

Things to know: 
*****
I. LOCATION & PARKING: If you call ahead of time, the club may have a relationship with the hotel you're staying at and could arrange a free limo to pick you up. The driver gets a cut; that's why they do it.

II. ENTRY: They have general admission through the front, but you could possibly work out a deal by calling ahead. My party and I entered through their back entry-way. There, you'll likely pay a more affordable fee and a host will direct you to a table. 

III. EXPERIENCE: As I noted above, they fly in gorgeous women from the around the country to dance there; however, they act hella aggressive. (More on that later.) Like any strip club, you get a table, ladies walk up to you, and then they ask you, for lapdances. Each dance costs $20. And then private rooms and such cost a lot more. 

I was there, for a few hours, and after having a grip of drinks, I can only recount the following events:

===Event #1 - Stripper Shove & Diss ===
I exited the bathroom (very nice, BTW), and I saw a Filipina girl waiting there, for me. I just thought, ""Oh damn, she's gonna take all my money,"" so I avoided eye contact and kept walking. As I walked past her, she literally shoved me as hard as she could with both of her hands and shouted, ""Yo, are you gonna buy a dance from me or what, huh? Don't you think I'm hot?"" 

I mean, she was a beautiful girl, but I haven't done martial arts since 21 and don't got time to fight with an Asian sista. I kept walking. lol.

===Event #2 - Harmony's Lapdance & Hustle===
""Harmony"" -- a beautiful half-Puerto Rican half-Egyptian woman -- walked over to me at a table. She asked if I wanted a dance, and I encouraged her to dance on my friend/ the bachelor; however, like many times throughout the night, he occupied himself with a pair of boobs or an ass in his face.

She seemed nice, so we went over to a corner and... talked about her childhood (for like twenty minutes)? Sure, she was hustling me, but in addition to her looks I thought she has lived an interesting life. She gave me a dance, for 15 minutes and then wanted me to pay hella money, for a private room (which is typical). I said no, but replied by saying, ""Here's $20 to dance on my friend."" 

Harmony took the money, walked over to my friend, and he drunkenly said, ""no."" I never saw Harmony again.

===Event #3 - Possibly Injuring My Rotator Cuff===
The bachelor's future brother in law got hella wasted that night. While sitting at their main stage, he handed me $200 in $1s, and whispered in my ear, ""I want you to throw these bills as hard as you can UNTIL ALL OF THEM ARE GONE!"" 

""All of them?"", I replied with uncertainty.

""All. Of. Them. My arm hurts, and I need to take a break.""

So, I did just that. I started ""Making it Rain"" three dollars at a time, which seemed too basic. I then switched over to overhand throwing. Unfortunately, the aerodynamics of the bills caused them to float back to me. This required me to eventually switch to underhand and then just sliding bills into g-strings.

===Event #4 - Stripper Dances w/ Ketchup===
We did not eat enough in Vegas, and every time our party visited a strip club my stomach grumbled in pain. So I ordered an appetizer platter, and it arrived with mozzarella sticks, a quesadilla, and other football game-like bites.

While eating a stripper came over to my friend and put her legs on his shoulders and shook her thang. While doing so some ketchup got on her leg. So throughout the rest of routine, she danced with ketchup. LOL!

===Event #5 - We Lost the Bachelor === 
He literally dissapeared, for hours. I left to go home around 4 am and he didn't come back until 9:30 am.

4952244,2011-02-08,16,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"My first experience at a strip club EVER, and I have to say that Spearmint Rhino was the right place to pop that cherry.   I'd always imagined strip clubs to be seedy and smokey with sticky floors and creepy guys.  This place was actually classy with decent looking girls, some (but not too many) creepers, and clean floors...although I didn't go into the ""champagne room.""

One of my friends said that when she went here, she actually made friends with a couple of the strippers.  Two of my guy friends really wanted to go, and I figured, sure why not?  If anything, I can learn some new dance moves, get motivated to work out, and even make a new friend.  

We walk in, and see that there is a cover.  Thinking that since I'm a girl, I wouldn't get charged cover.  Nope.  I was told, ""$20 a person.  Girls are people.  So $20.""  Hmmmm. Okay.  Whatever.  My guy friends paid just because they knew I was taking one for the team.

When we actually went in, the guy to girl ratio was 1:1.  It was crazy!  Those girls were like hawks coming to get whatever guy was there.  Right when my guy friends sat down, two strippers came up to them, literally jumped in their laps, and ""offered"" lap dances.  Well, at that point, you can't really say no.   A short 5 minutes later, the dance was over and my friends were out another $20 each.

Another girl comes up to one of my guy friends, who eventually gets invited into the ""champagne room.""  They were gone for about 20 minutes and he was out another $150.  Not sure what happened, but he just shared that the most interesting part was when she led him to the ATM machine for the moolah and the ATM machine charged another $20 just for using it!  Holy cow.  

That's it.  I'm not giving any guy anything for free now.  I kid.  I kid.  As long as I get a free dinner.  JK!

Alright, so did I meet my goals of the night?
1) Learn new dance moves:  uh, yeah.  The way some of the strippers were able to isolate their butt muscles was amazing.  I tried to follow suit that night and majorly failed
2)  Get motivated to work out:  hmmmm. kind of?  I have more motivation to make more money and get a boob job now though
3)  Make new friends:  I did talk to one girl for a while about how the business works.  The girls actually have to pay the club to work the floor or dance.  Interesting.  I wonder how income is reported here.

Anyway, interesting night.  I'm glad I was devirginized to strip clubs here where the girls were actually nice, the guys weren't so bad, and the vibe wasn't as creepy/perverted as I had always imagined a strip club to be.",9M9JmaJ3uWQABX0HN8IF8A,10,9,3,h6btyVLYzPqpP4QPZADSMQ
4963731,2010-03-29,26,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"SCAM!

Yes, that's right... I said ""SCAM!""

The Spearmint Rhino has always been a place that's come up as one of the top strip clubs in Vegas. Of course I had to go check it out while in Vegas this weekend with my friend. 

First off, we knew about the free limo thing, but weren't able to work that one out. We ended up taking a cab and also paying the steep cover to get in. On the surface, this joint made a decent first impression. A bevy of beautiful girls. You couldn't really go too wrong here looks-wise. Girls here are so consistently good looking, you would think you walked on to a strip club movie set. 

It didn't take long though before we started to see the cracks in the foundation here... and they run deep.

Before we could even take it all in, I get accosted and molested by this tall blond Eastern European girl who tried dragging me back to VIP. I had to say ""no"" half a dozen times and yank my arm away from her before she took the hint. 

She kept touching my dick through my pants while trying to pull me to the VIP lounge talking about 200 dollars and how I didn't want to sit at a table because it's no fun there. Well, maybe I like sitting in the main room having drinks and talking to people. Maybe I don't want to go have a private dance with a complete stranger. 

That shit is awkward. I would like to get to know someone a little bit first. What if I find out your personality is shit and then I'm stuck in the VIP room with some hot asshole and 200 bucks lighter? Plus, I don't really want some stranger touching my dick instead of a handshake... I suppose I'm weird that way. 

My friend and I walked around the club a few times looking for a seat. They let too many people in here. Absurdly too many. I was told to go talk to a guy up at the front if I wanted a seat. He put my name on his list and said he would try to find me something and to just keep checking back with him. I wandered around some more and had 3 more girls come up to me and touch my dick and try to drag me off to the back room. It got quite annoying rather quickly. Let me fucking sit down for 5 minutes. 

My friend and I decided to just sit at one of the two bars and have a drink while we wait. Another girl comes up to us and guilts me into buying her a drink. I hate that. I don't buy girls drinks at bars. I buy my date drinks. I buy my friends drinks. I don't buy strangers drinks because they are pretty... or in their bra and panties for that matter. 

She did turn out to be useful though because she informed me that if I don't give the guy at the door 100 bucks, I won't get a seat ever. She was kind enough to walk around the place with us looking for open seats. We ended up lucking out by asking a guy if we could sit at his table with him. It was a great spot too. Things were turning around for us. 

Then my friend asked the girl who ushered us around the club if he could buy our new friend a dance for sharing his table with us, and she said she didn't do $20 dances - she only did VIP. We all immediately lost interest in her and sent her away. That kind of attitude was just a buzzkill. 

This became the standard pretty much - it seemed that most girls there refused to give you a $20 dance on the floor, but would only go back to VIP. I don't want to go to VIP - it's creepy. I don't want to get any more intimate than just the standard lapdance. Looking around, we noticed very few dances on the floor going on - just a long-ass line to the VIP area. 

I even had one filthy blond scam artist liar tell me she was under contract and couldn't do $20 dances. She kept coming up to me throughout the night trying to drag me off to VIP. I kept saying I didn't want to go and she kept insisting. I felt like I was trying to wander off a used car lot and a sleazy salesman in a bra and panties wasn't letting me leave. 

I had a Larry David moment with this girl. She finally guilted me into going back to the room. She insists I give her the money first - her counting it took up the first song. Then she started doing the worst half-assed standard boring soulless yawn-inducing lapdance without going anywhere near my lap. I stopped her after about 30 seconds and told her I felt swindled and cheated. I wanted to leave and get my money back. 

Long story short - It became a big embarrassing ordeal for everyone, but the manager ended up giving me 40 bucks back. It was the principle of the thing for me at this point. We promptly left after this.

Spearmint Rhino has attractive girls, and some of them were actually nice. It's possible to have a good time. However, most girls here seem to only do the VIP room and scam you out of your cash. Drinks are overpriced, it's too dark inside, and they pack it so full it's standing room only. 

Arizona clubs give better dances for half the price, the girls don't act like they're too good for the job, and they let you get to know them a bit before you decide you want to go to the VIP lounge with them.",oaaEXgQ3x51cXE3GTXrT1Q,36,13,1,9qk0HpK_qMXayN62e1ds0g
4985930,2014-12-31,7,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"This is an updated review based on my visit last night compared to my last visit 4 years ago during peak hours.

This club is everything a guy could ask for in a gentleman's club. Beautiful girls with gorgeous bodies and surprisingly really fun personalities if you don't come off as a creep or asshole. I have high standards when it comes to women and looks and all the girls here were 8s and above, with 10s every 4 girls or so and 9s every other girl, no lie.

The entrance I believe is $40 but make sure to call them to use the complimentary limo service to not only have that entrance fee waived, but arrive there in style in a stretch limo. Don't even matter if you're by yourself. Just make sure to tip the driver $5/each guy or gal in your party.

The music was on point all 4 hours I was there and the dj deserves a raise for that. He'd go from electronic, to hip hop, to techno with flawless ease and if there was a dance floor, I probably would've been on it. I salute you, dj.

I do have 2 gripes if you'd consider these gripes. Nothing major:

1. If you're an asthmatic, stay away. Smoke everywhere. I don't even smoke yet I woke up the next day smelling like cigarettes still. That's how bad it is. Small price to pay though for all the gorgeous women.

2. So many places to sit, yet all the seats were taken because it was packed. Only option was to take a girl to either the vip, champagne room, or rhino room.

Some tips from me:

1. Set a spending limit and don't use the atm in there. It hits you with a $45 atm transaction fee. No thank you.

2. There's a back room where it's $100 for 3 dances in a more secluded setting. They don't tell you this but there's also a $45 2 drink minimum for you and the girl so it comes out to $145 each time you're in there.

3. Don't be shy. If there's a really hot girl that you want, grab her before someone else does. These girls are the ones in high demand.

4. Some girls can be pushy. Don't do anything unless you really want to. It's your money. You do what you want.

5030770,2016-08-16,21,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"I'm still pretty upset with my experience here and I was here in May.

We're a group of 8 girls (with 3 more on the way), and we were told by a promoter that the cover to get into Spearmint Rhino would be $50, but it would include 2 drinks.

I'm thinking, okay, it's a little steep, but none of us have ever been to a Vegas strip club so we figure ""hey, maybe this is the norm.""

The driver of the limo that we flagged down was actually skeptical of our deal.  She told us that most all female groups usually have a bit of an issue getting into Spearmint, so she actually ended up giving us her number so we could call her if we ended up not getting in.  This is already raising flags for me about this place, and we haven't even GOTTEN there yet.

We pull up and go to the door, where we're stopped by the doorman.  First, we're told that we can't get in because we're an all-female group.  No guy, no entry.  After we argue that a promoter told us that we could get in, we're then informed that the cover is actually $60/person ($10 more than we were originally told) and that it DOESN'T cover drinks.  While we're still trying to digest that information, we are then also informed that -- if we go inside -- we're not allowed to speak to ANY of the men there.  Because we're ""not allowed to steal clients from the girls.""

Wow.  I'm sorry if, as a company, you have so little confidence in your girls that a bachelorette party walking in off the street would be seen as competition for paying customers.  It's not as though we would charge the men money to talk to us.  And it's not as though we would've had any interest in them either.  But to tack that little rule on, on top of first denying us entry, then trying to upcharge us in order to gain entry?  That's too much.",p6qMidPaJ96LgB_9z7xZVw,51,9,1,kyZYHatvokvpQQnHAnDm5w

The doormen are always helpful in finding us  a good table, and if you slip them $20 or so (on a busier night perhaps more), they will have your back your entire visit.  By no means is this mandatory, but well worth it when you want a good table or any other kind of assistance.  Yes, this is common etiquette for all you cheap skates or strip club newbies!  The cocktail waitresses are also friendly and helpful.  Take care of them, and they will take care of you.
      Overall, the girls are of higher quality that most other strip clubs.  There is never a shortage of girls so if you hang around long enough, you will find one that meets your standards.  There are all shapes and sizes, and to some extent age, but overall, not disappointing. Yes, some of them can be pushy but one should expect that in EVERY strip club to a certain degree.  Simply say you are not interested and most of them will respectfully scurry away.  If they don't, like a few of them have done to my husband and I, tell the cocktail waitress or the doorman (whom you have already taken care of hopefully...wink, wink) and they are more than happy to put the girl in check or ask her to leave! As far as some reviews saying the girls will rip you off, steal, etc., again, remember you are in a strip club people!!  Not every stripper is going to be America's most honest, upstanding citizen!  I have never had those types of experiences here, but then again, I use ""strip club common sense!""  If you are a strip club virgin, maybe you should go with someone who knows the ropes and you won't be taken for a fool!

Not that I felt like I could eat off the floors or anything but, unlike many other strip clubs, I don't leave here feeling like I could have contracted an STD from the seats.  There are many stages and several variations of ""VIP"" rooms to fit any budget.   I would recommend this over any other strip club in Vegas and I have been to most all of them, accept the totally nude extremely trashy ones.  
      I see many people complaining about prices and the amount they have to spend here.  As with any business, you get what you pay for and you will most likely have a more lively and perhaps more fun experience if you spend more!  You can easily come and enjoy the view and have a few beers without getting dances, but in all fairness, the dancers are providing a service and should be fairly compensated.  If you are going to complain about the amount of cash you spend at ANY strip club, save everyone from the misery of dealing with a cheap skate (especially the dancers) and don't go!!",lCYC5Ei9tIFBaW1AQfRu7A,5,3,5,XtqjWsk04b6UNlv69_kUjA

Lap dances can cost $20-$30 (didn't quite understand the sliding scale). The drinks are reasonable maybe because they assume if you drink enough you'll just sit there and give all your money away. Funny, I wasn't drunk and I just wanted a nice show yet I walked away $70 or so lighter.

The girls here are hot the hottest of all the vegas strip clubs (read next review). If you get wasted, the bouncers will get you a cab (for free).

1. Come by car.  Fees are added for the taxi and/or limo drivers who bring guest to the Rhino.

2.  Come with locals.  Nevada residents are free.  No local ID, you pay what they want to charge you. Locals might be able to get you in.

3.  Don't flash a roll.  You will get picked up right away by a hostess.  Better to look first and make your choice.

4.   You don't get to see unless you pay.  $20 is the rate for the dance.  Don't get fooled.  

5.  If you reject a hostess, she gets annoyed quick.  IRRITATING.

6.  VIP back room fee is a minimum of $100.  That's all you should expect to pay.  The girls can charge you whatever they like so keep that in mind.  Negotiate first.  You don't want to get in it with a bouncer.

REMEMBER, THE GIRLS DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT YOU COULDN'T ALREADY DO TO YOURSELF.

Cons: pushy sneaky dancers, incredibly expensive, low quality dancing

This could entirely be my own personal experience as I have only been here once. however, my experience was completely HORRIBLE. My wife and I dropped $560 here tonight and got almost nothing out of it. the cover charge was $44 per person and the ATM fee was $21. If you go back for a private dance you are forced to buy extremely expensive drinks ($33 for a shot of crown) . And besides that the dancer we got, Ryan,  happened to be a horrible dancer. Great body and decent personality but she wouldn't shut up!  And she made us pay the cut that the club takes from her dance claiming it was a ""tip"" for the bouncer.  I wouldn't come back here if it were the only strip club in Vegas.

Free and quick Limo service. Pick you up from any Las Vegas hotel and you arrive at the VIP back entrance and there is NO COVER CHARGE with all this!

Place is packed and full of amazingly sexy and beautiful girls. Vibe is pumping and full of energy. Lots of seating but you have to wander around to find a spot, and almost anywhere is a good view.

Bartenders mix a strong mean drink! Girls here are hustling but very cool and sweet. Not pushy at all and fun to talk to. And all are smoking hot!

Well. 

The place is dark. I mean, DARK. We stumbled around for a bit trying to find a spot to sit. It was a Friday night and still relatively early so it wasn't too crowded... which was a bummer because I would have enjoyed feeling my way, if you know what I mean. 

We weren't in our seats 2 minutes before the vultures began descending. 

I dubbed the first girl ""Skeletor"", not because of how rail thin she was, but because her cheeks were so sunken in, she looked like a toothless crack whore. I kid you not. Plus she looked to be about 50. I mean, the place was dark, but not SO dark that we couldn't tell she was in no way attractive. We immediately began to question the steep cover charge. 

Let me interrupt myself here to comment on the cover charge. $50 a person! We later found out from a friendly girl that they check your ID's first so they know if you're an out-of-towner. Locals don't get hit with the cover charge. Shame on you for that, SR. 

Back to the girls. Meh. Really. I can appreciate a lovely lady but we had to turn away girl after girl because of one thing or another. Like, they had great boobs but no butt. Or a great butt and no boobs. Perhaps that's why it is so dang dark in this place? So discerning people can't be quite so... discerning? 

Really, we were not impressed at all. Until...

My friend went to use the bathroom. While he was in there, I spotted HER. I had to get up out of my seat and get her attention. She was the ONE girl who had ""the entire package"" and I knew my BFF would approve. She waited patiently for my friend to come back. When he did and saw her, I knew I picked the right girl.  

She was the only one we picked to dance for us that night. And she DID NOT disappoint. She is the ONLY reason this place gets the 3 stars from me. 

It was all made worth it when we returned to our hotel and my friend's wife-to-be complained how my friend was smeared in lipstick and glitter from head to toe. She asked him to take a shower right away because ""he smelled like cheap booze and cheap women"".

Spearmint Rhino LV is the club I always fantasized about when I first started going, with one exception (more on that later). TONS of girls with HUGE boobs, many of them fake, friendly, rooms that are expensive, but worth it (RARE that my cheap ass will ever say that), both day and night. And it's 24 hours!  I was in Vegas for the AVN Awards this year, and afterwards, quickly realized I should have spent the whole trip at the Rhino, and skipped the awards (which I was late to because of the Rhino). Favorite girls are Nivea and Heavenly (who said she will be doing this ""until the wheels fall off""), but that's only because they're biggest on top - the girls I DIDN'T get dances from would all have been my favorite girl here in LA (and are not flat, lemme tell you).  The club is classy, friendly, and has tons of regulars, with good reason, and they will provide free limo service if you follow them on Twitter, which includes free admission (a HUGE plus, as it's $30 to get in). I dropped $2500 there, and plan to go back whenever I can. Nine out of ten, easy, and it pains me to say even that, because really, it's near perfect.

If you are planning on visiting the rhino start with calling them at 702-796-3600 to get a FREE limo ride to the club. YES FREE. Save yourself 20 bucks cover at the door and give it to the limo driver who deserves it. Once you walk in you see the dimly lit stages and a bar. Drinks are a tad overpriced but its Vegas and tits are in your face. 10 bucks for a corona, also do yourself a favor and get the chicken strips. I am not messing around when I say they are REALLY good. 

I got here around 4am and the place was PACKED. At least a 1:1 ratio. The girls are not super aggressive like other people say. I took 2 females of my own and they loved the place.

Las Vegas bachelor party weekend consisted of this: Airport to Caesars to Spearmint Rhino to Caesars to Spearmint Rhino to Caesars to Spearmint Rhino to Caesars and back to Airport. 3 total visits in 2 days.

You will be shoulder to shoulder consisting of guidos, douche bags, meat heads and guys that wear jerseys at the club.

And now for the main event...coming here in the daytime. The best thing to happen to America since Bin Laden got silver bullet sun glasses. Bottle service of Belvedere Vodka for 100 dollars...yes please. Hot dancers with natural and enhanced chesticles...yes please. VIP room 20 minutes for 100 dollars, yes please. 

Taxi drivers get a kick back to drop guys off at this place, tell them you have a group of guys that want to go here, what kind of deal can you make. We never paid for a taxi and just paid the 20 dollar cover that was worth it. 

After 3 trips to Spearmint Rhino for a bachelor party weekend, the following happened: stole a dancers g-string, bachelor got kicked out after break-dancing on stage, a friend pee'd on a bouncer's car, multiple moments of blacking out, another friend got literally thrown out like Jazzy Jeff on the fresh prince and proposed marriage to a girl with a Rolling Stones tattoo...she said no.

I really fancy CH3 and was a bit bummed when my friends out voted me to come here, but it was a pleasant surprise. The Rhino is very dimmly lit, I even tripped over a few chairs. The club had an old boy's club kind of feel. I felt like I should be drinking a whiskey neat and purchasing a cigar and all the men should be lounging around in robes.

The girls were stunningly gorgeous. I didn't feel they were overally aggressive and quite a few of them came over and sat next to me and my friends and loved having general chit-chat. My favorite was a the entertainer named Vanilla. She was sweet, all-natural (I don't like anchor scars or other silicone parts). I definitely could watch her dance for hours.

Huge suggestion: Do not use your credit card here. There is a good chance your bank will freak out, block the charge and then freeze your account. I'm speaking from experience. Cash is king.

Many of the girls here don't ""dance"" full-time and just fly in for weekends and breaks between semesters. If you play your cards right, it's not completely unreasonable to meet a decent, date-able girl here (also speaking from experience).

The site said entry is $44 but is waived when you order their complimentary limo service. So I called to order it. A woman answered I told her I wanted to set a pick up for midnight. I told her that it would just be me and my best friend and no man would be accompanying us. She told us normally women are not allowed without a man but we'll be fine as long as we don't dress provocatively or interact with any of the male patrons. I understood and she scheduled our pick up. 

The limo driver arrived on time. He was very nice. I asked him if we were dressed alright and he said we were good. He took us there and we tipped him $5 each.

When we arrived, the bouncer checked our bags and id's and started to tell us we needed a man with us but the limo driver interjected and said, ""they're good."" He then walked us in and seated us at a small table and tells us there's a two drink minimum.

The venue is dimly lit, with vibe of a lounge. Our waitress was beautiful. She said she was Ethiopian and Philipino. But the ladies were mostly white women, which I'm not in to at all. So we chilled and order drinks.

The experience:
 After our first set of drinks these two friendly Cuban ladies walked up to us and asked if we wanted a dance. I'm kind of picky and I wanted see if there were better girls there first, so I said that we wanted to finish our drink first. Unbeknownst to us there was a Jamaican man at the table across from us watching the whole interaction. He walks up and asks, ""Do y'all want a dance?"" We, caught a little off guard, but pleased at the same time, said, ""yes."" So he hands us each a stack of money and we get a lap dance. My girl was pretty, she was tall and had dark hair. She had a big butt and nice thighs. She smiled but she didn't talk. They danced on us for like 3 or 4 songs and we just felt them up (I recommend asking them if it's okay first, especially men) and poured money on them lol. It was fun. 

Afterwards, he invited us to his table, bought us two more rounds of drinks and had the bouncer find us two more women. The bouncer brought over this mixed girl. She was friendly. I liked her the best. I like when strippers are upbeat and don't act all dead inside. Lowers morale ya know? Anyhow, initially she gave us both a lap dance but my bestie found another girl and so the mixed girl stayed with me the rest of the time. We got to chatting as she was dancing on me and she was so nice. The Jamaican had given us more money to drizzle but when my stack was gone I gave her my own money. 

Anyway, because of that experience, Spearmint Rhino now is second to KOD on my strip club list! Houston, New Orleans and Atlanta clubs, I'm coming for you! Lol",3VFoTrN88VE_J46n0ReCVg,16,8,4,4B_3vg9aOUwsMgIsZHF4fw

The girls are all pretty attractive, though I'll say it seems pretty obvious that they have a particular ""type"" and a lot of the girls seem to be virtually indistinguishable from each other. They also seem pretty unenthusiastic, which is partially understandable and the other part kind of a buzz-kill. This is an attractive group of girls, but not necessarily a fun group. 

 The bartender somehow botched our Jameson neat order not once, but twice. It came out frothy and tasting like he'd shaken it in a dirty shaker. He accused my girlfriend and I of spitting into the glass until he made another round and it came out the same way. For $12 a shot I'd hope for better and definitely sans the attitude.

There weren't any free seats, until about 20 to 30 mins of standing around and people watching... what else could I do? I have never seen so many exposed breasts in my life.

She decided we should to go to a strip club for lunch (yes, my life is awesome). After a couple of vague phone calls, an Escalade came to the hotel to pick us up. After a short trip near the Wynn that included a discussion about everything from Vegas rain to the driver's collection of firearms, we were taken to the back of the club and hustled into a cave that Batman would get lost in. It was so dark I was worried that I wouldn't be able to tell the dancers from the bouncers. We sat down with one foot out the door.

Then a dancer came up to us in the inevitable 'hey how you guys doin?' kind of way. I thought she'd jump right into her pitch when she sat down, but she didn't. She wound up talking to us for about 30 minutes.  The conversation wasn't annoying, high pressure or weird. She was just a girl in a bikini who was hanging out (because that happens all the time). I decided to get a dance from her ten minutes into the convo but by the time we got around to that (after we had three rounds of happy hour drinks, lunch and saw our new friend tear up the pole) I got two dances I got two dances for my partner. It was a great time overall, even if it wasn't the typical strip club experience.

I almost didn't get to go as I kept reading that they had a 1 guy to 1 gal entrance policy and I had 3 of my friends who were all gals. We were actually in a cab on our way to a bar when the discussion of SR came up. The cab driver said not a problem and to let him talk to the bouncers, so we said ok! We got there and there was no problem getting in. I'm not sure why other reviewers keep complaining about the place being rude, pushy, and arrogant, etc., but these guys (yes, tough), but were very friendly and we had the best time.

It was fun just watching the girls pole dancing on the stage....and ok, most didn't seem to have much energy in their performances, but their stunning looks and figures more than made up for that. Yes, it's true, the girls here are pretty aggressive in approaching you and pushing for VIP room lap dances, but hey, they gotta live too. As long as they're not rude and call you names when you turn them down....and they didn't at all! They were total sweethearts and very friendly and polite to us, although it wasn't often that I didn't like any one of the girls who approached me. They were all stunningly gorgeous! Just be nice to them and they'll be nice to you....after all, they're people too.

I also need to thank Derek the VIP Host who made our experience at the club so fun and enjoyable. He's a really nice and very helpful guy and always went out of his way to make sure our needs were taken care of in terms of seating, drink, and preferences in girls. He would actually bring 2-3 gorgeous women at a time for me to choose from (for dances) which made things so difficult especially when they were all so stunning!

There are tons of hot ladies. But no pole skills. Hence the -1 star. I was very disappointed with that. Only one girl I saw actually danced on the pole. The rest were giving lap dances or grinding on the floor. 

We went with a group of girls and guys. We all had fun. I even went here with my boyfriend and we both enjoyed it. I'm sure he enjoyed it a little more than me though. 

The girls are pretty aggressive. Within two seconds of walking into the place one girl tried to take my man back to the Champagne room with her. Uh, no, don't think so.

First Off: This is the FACTORY FARM OF STRIP CLUBS.  I haven't seen seen this many naked chicks walking around even in porno!  The place is gigantic, multiple rooms with so much shit going on...absolutely ridiculous.

Second Off:  The 'dancers' are all in the upper echelon from what i have seen when i've been to other strip clubs in other places...i mean c'mon it's vegas......BUT, beware...titty bars are very dark for a very good reason...some of those girls got some gnarley grills when up close.

Third:  If you take a cab to the titty bar your cab ride is free...why you ask...well the cab driver gets $50 for every referral and you have to pay $30 to get in...(so you can ask your cab driver for $30 and they will do it as they still net $20 per head....nice eh?)

So chances are slim that any dancers with popular stage names such as Britney, Candy, Anastasia, Angel, Coco, Jade, or Brandy would still be spring chickens in this entertainment circle.

2) Dancers are independent contractors that must have proper permits from the county to even work at Gentlemen's Clubs and must pay a house fee to work there each day. 

3) House fees are lower if dancers arrived during the early/day shift and goes up (usually at 9pm) when the venue typically gets busier. There are opt-out fees for not having to dance on stage, for venues where stage work is mandatory.

4) Popular figures or names, beverages (wine and spirits), gemstones, geographic locations, food, herbs and spices are often the sources of inspiration for stripper stage names.

Pro Tips:

1) Drive your self or call for their free limo service to avoid paying door fees that are split with the cab drivers.

2) Bring plenty of $20s, $1s or exchange for them with the cashier.

3) Be organized with the different bills you have in your pocket. To avoid unintentionally giving a $50 instead of a $20 for a dance. Yes, I did that last night and I was not even drunk. In fact don't even bring $50s.

4) If you don't know the drink prices, order your first round of drinks directly from the bartender to get that info, this will help you avoid being potentially ripped off by the occasional self tipping waitresses.

5) Bring what you expect to spend for your night of entertainment and leave the ATM card at home. Considered what you leave with at the end of the night as what the house failed to win from you.

So with that out of the way, let's get more serious with this review.

Spearmint Rhino (SR), for years it was one of the top 3 gentlemen's clubs that we would visit for friend's bachelor's party weekend celebrations or CES trips, then we started running out of bachelors getting hitched and skipping out on CES. Then newer clubs opened and we kind of stopped visiting or favored other ones.

Then I moved to Vegas, and rarely go to the strip clubs unless out of town friends are visit Vegas for work or volleyball tournaments. And on one of those recent visits someone suggested going to SR and called the house number for VIP entry for driving ourselves there during the recent remodeling. The host helped us get a table and seats after we were comped the entry fee. The ladies were typically quit nice and friendly, and my friends all enjoyed themselves.

So this past weekend when I received a group text with plans we hit up Sapphire for a coworker's birthday, I was like ""let's call the SR main phone number for VIP entry"". But in consideration of our female coworkers that said they were going, we opted for the biggest strip club in the world. That's until the last minute ""sorry I don't think I'm going to make it"" messages started coming in. So in the end it was SR for the win.

We arrived about 6:40pm. Totally awesome ratio of ""Nightlife Entertainment Consultants"" to male patrons ratio. But many of the smaller rooms/areas were closed off, until it got busier later in the night.  So soon after we found a vacant table with a few chairs to sit in, 2 ladies sat with us and started a lengthy conversation with our birthday boy and 2 more joined the fray so as not to leave the others feeling neglected. We took turns buying dances for the birthday boy, but the 2 ladies promoting going to VIP room eventually left without fulfilling their primary mission objective.

Without realizing it, it was 9pm, and there were noticeably more new dancers that arrived. One was a very attractive petite model from Kiev, Ukraine, but her energy was off and the dance felt awkward. Then I met an aspiring actress that have minor roles in films and searchable on IMDB, she was the birthday boy's favorite. And despite being picky, I was glad that eventually a 1/2 Filipino 1/2 Vietnamese total stunner came by to say hi, and I willingly said good bye to 10 dances worth of time sponsored by the Lakers not getting beat up as much by the Cavaliers as the oddsmakers thought parlayed with a few other earlier NBA games.

In the end, we left SR after clocking in almost a full day of work before midnight with plans to come back to celebrate the next special occasion.

So while drafting this review I was trying to think of least favorite or funny stage names that would make people inadvertently snort out their rum and coke through their noses if the DJ were to call them to the main stage, and here are my 6:

1) Pistachio
2) Linguine (by the way speech recognition continues to think I am trying to say ""link weenie"")
3) Turmeric
4) Chernobyl
5) Hillary Clinton
6) Panties (Dragon Ball Z fans might love it though)",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,33,28,4,EqTjcqjaiXJz8DuKU6Mm4g

The free VIP limo ride totally set the bar for it being my first titties bar. This service fosters a big ass thumbs up. Makes you feel like royalty. Pretty much the only way a princess like me would roll to a club like this. Gay guy approved.

I only learn all my booty bouncing, ass shaking, and pole working skills from the best. Thanks ladies, I'm totally using that single leg wrap around move at the gay bar next time.

Bachelor party status. That's why I was here. I got offered a lap dance, I warned the girl she's probably not going to get a boner out of me, she did her business, now I can safely say I love peen. 

Straight-guy debauchery, Ass, Tits, 36-24-36's everywhere. I think this review has garnered a lot of explicit language.

I'll just sum it up with one phrase. ""Hey cutie, you wanna party?""",7mjJ8Vkhg6nh_pxyvWKJXA,3,4,4,WASmNy7x9PVvyIAX6xM9JA
5939054,2009-06-17,2,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"Man oh man, the girls here are smokin' hot.  The free limo / no cover service is no joke, and we certainly took advantage of it.  Since there were 9 of us, they sent a party bus, which was awesome.  Once inside we got bottle service and we began our ritual of taking turns buying lapdances for the bachelor.

The strippers are gorgeous and know how to dance.  The seating is comfortable, drinks are good, and since it's Vegas it seems to never close.  We were here until 6:30 a.m., and we would have stayed longer were it not for money woes.

Money is the only gripe here - dances start at $20 per song (not $40 as I previously stated), and private dances are $100.  The ATM charges a 10% fee, which is insane.  I have never encountered a percentage, and would have taken out more money if not for that fee.

Still, the strippers here are great.  Get the limo service, bring enough cash from outside, and leave when you run out.",PWohtvH6nTdvGCGeRzoUuQ,8,2,4,I7r8W-UOirJGzqX4CJNiMQ
5961223,2009-09-06,0,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"Much like the Rio and the Sahara... the Spearmint Rhino is a standing memorial of Las Vegas days gone past. While once at the very top of Las Vegas adult venues, the Rhino has slowly turned - much to the delight of the Vegas ""old guard""  - as THE place to find wild women who are sick and tired of dancing at those overrated ""trendy"" spots.  Nightly people watching sessions provide amusement for blue collar and white collar worker alike, as the girls here are friendly and accommodating to even the smallest budget. If you are low on dough but want to be ""in the know"" then the Rhino is the place for you!",AtlQMOcdGwM90Tq5CcYEpA,1,0,2,JMwx5dS-QNe0FTmey7efAQ
5961858,2017-12-13,7,Uk0_hruW6Ai5Tb47zo7IIQ,"Call for a free limo. It doesn't make any sense but if you arrive yourself, you have to pay an exorbitant cover. If you have the limo pick you up in style, it's free to get in.

It took about 15 minutes before the limo came for us at Cosmo, where we had just finished off a night of dancing at Marquee. Six of us got into the limo and were dropped off right in front of Spearmint Rhino.

The club was crowded, full of patrons and strippers. The only seats available were right by the stage. These are not my preferred seats since I don't like the pressure to tip and don't want body parts that close to my face. I was so tired that I didn't really care.

He went to buy drinks for a friend and when he came back and sat down next to me, a stripper came to strike up a conversation with me. ""Is he your boyfriend?"" I wasn't sure how to answer so I just stared back at her. ""Are you in IT?"" Is it because I'm Asian? ""Do you want me to ask him to buy you a sexy dance?"" No, thanks. I looked at him and told him I was sleepy so we left.

I've been to plenty of strip clubs and although this one has a higher quantity of strippers, I don't think the quality is necessarily higher. Fake boobs that don't even move are not sexy at all.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,4,2,3,S60VORvBEj7ENGsZ6LqoFQ
