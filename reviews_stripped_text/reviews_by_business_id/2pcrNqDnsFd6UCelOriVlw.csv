I'm still giving it 3 stars because the food was made like normal, but I will definitely find a different taco bell to go to next time.",l0uYA4vM0wYQc2JsF8uFsA,0,0,3,xMGRYkANPp5x1GQjbpiJAw

1103969,2015-12-19,0,2pcrNqDnsFd6UCelOriVlw,"Worst Taco Bell location for food and service. They got the got my burrito order wrong and I happen to take a bite until I noticed and went to change it. The employees were talking to each other about my situation right across me rudely as if I couldn't hear them? They didn't want to change it to the correct one, said I already took a bite. Then changed they're mind and she took it and threw it in the trash. I said I'm right here I can hear you and I just took a bite can I just get what I originally ordered and in showed her on the receipt what I paid for. They said fine. I waited about 10-15 min and went up to ask about it turns out they forgot about it. Keep in mind it wasn't busy, didn't see anyone in the drive thru. Employees were rude. The potato in the potato tacos I ordered with no lettuce were really stale and cold the cheese didn't even melt. Like they just threw cold potato pieces. Finally after my brother finished eating I just took mine to go, didn't enjoy my meal what so ever. Do not recommend this location and I like Taco Bell.",Wl-AFS5vDWDrNvpTQah4ow,1,2,1,y4bjjHFxC-1slJ9paee1dw
1364195,2016-10-16,0,2pcrNqDnsFd6UCelOriVlw,"If I can give this Taco Bell less than one star or negative stars I would.  A few different reasons made this place less than favorable. 
Reason number one. I had a large order one of the orders I specifically asked for a simple soft chicken taco. The lady taking the order repeated it several times back to me. When I got home she might wear today surprise they had given me. I am very very allergic to beef. This was strike one. 
When I return to make them aware of their mistake and simply have them fix it, it was a complete disaster. No one wanted to take responsibility for the order. And when they finally did it they were going to charge me extra. This was only strike two
At this point, as you could imagine I was furious with them. The lady shoved the bag at me. And stated ""here's your food""
I went inside and asked for the general managers number they toss me a receipt and then just walked away. No one acknowledged that I was even standing there. I asked for a manager and they smirked and laughed.
When the manager finally approached me he did not even introduce himself. He said that I just needed to come back tomorrow and talk to then.
This was strike two
When I asked for an apology everyone at the store looked at me as if I were speaking a foreign language. It was highly embarrassing. I had to raise my voice for them to even acknowledge that I was speaking. Every time I talked they cut me off and made a condescending remark. 
One of the cooks came from the back and started yelling and cursing at me also. We got into a screaming match in the store. Very unprofessional. Very out of character for me as well.
I would never return to this place. It was embarrassing and upsetting.
I will not be returning to this Taco Bell do you to the lack of professionalism and accuracy. This was not the first time that they had gotten the order wrong. Or spoke in a disrespectful way to a customer. So sad",J-YtkyzKPNwSkB3FuMM4Qg,1,0,1,yTC_jUc3AyqZUsLaov7h_A
1698460,2017-01-23,0,2pcrNqDnsFd6UCelOriVlw,Had the worst experience here. First I come and my order is completely wrong but I don't notice until I make it home. Then after realizing it was wrong I called to tell them but decide to just eat what I got so I don't have to drive back. While eating I notice a big black hair in my taco. So I drive all the way back. Instead of a full refund they just give me new food. Like I would still have an appetite after pulling a hair from my food.

Smh So, I figured that the food would be ok since it took them so long to make it... But, to my surprise there is hardly any chicken in these quesadilla's!! I'm so happy we ordered 6 of them instead of 4... We would still be hungry afterward if we hadn't... The 65% plain tortilla's will do nothing for a hungry person... Smh Also, it doesn't help that this place is really dirty... It's disgusting!! I will never be going back to this location...

3889963,2018-06-26,0,2pcrNqDnsFd6UCelOriVlw,"I stopped by this specific Taco Bell today since the other nearby location further north on Rancho Drive near Big Dog's Draft House is currently located in a slow-going and stressful construction zone with road work being performed.

The menu has gotten to be so extensive at Taco Bell with all sorts of combinations, options and specials available nearly all the time that it's quite overwhelming to make the right choice.

Thus, I radically simplified the decision making process by picking a currently advertised special - a Chalupa box with included beverage. And yes I must confess: it was naked and quite tasty too!

I find that Mexican food with whatever spin you may want to give it is just the thing for a change-of-pace meal to break the seemingly endless fastfood chain of burgers, chicken and the like.

Taco Bell - the franchise leader in this type of cuisine - consistently provides its customers with a needed pick-me-up of this kind very successfully.",1aJni3g7tN1ikyCxIHnmtg,0,0,4,evpqt5beAEal_mjr5hnxjQ

4447157,2018-06-14,0,2pcrNqDnsFd6UCelOriVlw,"Pretty livid. After a long night at work I swing through this drive thru. I tell them my order quite straight and forward, no changes, no nonsense. I ask if they still have fiery tacos as I couldn't find it on the menu. I'm told yes, so I say I'd like one. Once at the window, I was asked about my personal life. What I do for work, if I'm given free products from my work, if I just got off work. Just unprofessional. And surprise surprise, my order was not all there. Neither was my receipt so when we called back it was basically a crap shoot. Please learn to focus on your job and not trying to pick me up in the drive thru window. Because of you, I have no dinner. Thanks. Won't be back.",UqaunCc3FLPupbQUxS_Qdw,0,0,1,oJa_gE12xD9_qQFvQTyxew
