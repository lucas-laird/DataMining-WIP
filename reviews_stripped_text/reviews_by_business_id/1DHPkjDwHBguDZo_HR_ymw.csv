1252142,2018-01-06,0,1DHPkjDwHBguDZo_HR_ymw,"I've had hot pot in Chengdu province and I must admit the spicy ness of this broth was equally if not as spicy as I remembered. Anyway we order half mild spicy and half chicken mushroom broth, I do warn mild is pretty damn spicy. This is coming from a frequent Thai, Vietnamese, Korean spicy hot eating veteran. The spicy here is no holds barred melt your face numb your tongue. All in all it's enjoyable. Not much flavor salt wise but that's why you go to the sauce bar for $1.50 unlimited refills. I recommend the sesame seed pur√©e with a hint of the salty oyster sauce and some fresh crush peanuts on top. Also stick to the chicken and mushroom broth as taste wise it's actually a tasty broth. You've been warned mild, medium, hot spicy, you will eat at your own risk as is like lava hot sweating spicy. The place is clean, meats we had was fresh, prime rib, beef and pork belly, also had an off the menu vegetables mushroom bean curd combo plate. Ask your server it's not on the menu. I will return and try other meats and stuff. Good deal too about $50 for two people and really straight forward flavors and a bit different coming from the Sichuan style food.",JAWa-GXCtPNWUoAMiBcvoA,0,0,4,0tfXsJE2RDiiqI3iBcuQaw
1380626,2017-11-05,1,1DHPkjDwHBguDZo_HR_ymw,"This is a new hot pot place in town that has a different style than the others that this town has seen before. Away from the Mongolian style, Chinese fusion, Japanese sukiyaki, or Taiwanese, this is a new place who bases their style on chinese region of Chengdu. Those are are unfamiliar, Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province, which specializes in the ""Ma-La style"". What ""Ma-La"" means is numbing and spicy. Most dishes typically use a region specific peppercorn that numbs feeling in the mouth and face called the Sichuan peppercorn. you WILL know if you bitten into one XD try to avoid. You'll notice ""open"" peppercorn looking things. 

They took a lot of consideration into the visual aspects of the restaurant, using a lot of the ""ancient chinese"" wooden designs. Each table is fairly unique. Bench style seating with a custom made table. Induction plate recessed area in the middle of the table for their unique designed pot as well. Unfortunately for anyone that are tall or with long legs as you're almost for sure to hit your knee at least once, somewhere... 

Service seemed pretty good overall. Most of the people are pretty attentive and quick. Unfortunately, not all staff speaks English so you may run into some communication issues but they'll find one who speaks English to help you. 

According to two previous reviews, they both state mild was pretty spicy. My best friend and I both love spicy and eat considerably spicier than most people but we decided to try Medium instead of spicy, as well as the original style. On their menu, it says Laozao House Spicy Pot is $14.98 and Laozao Half & Half Pot for $13.98. Both list (Mild/Medium/Spicy). We had to clarify that the half and half includes the Laozao Origin Pot with a choice of spiciness for the other half.

Surprisingly, the medium is pretty spicy. As someone who's tried things with the hottest peppers in the world, thats actually saying something. Not like an unbearable amount of spicy, but for my friend and I, it was a good amount. Can't imagine how the ""spicy"" would be for this place. The medium soup base has A LOT of chili oil and sichuan peppercorns. Veggies soaks up a LOT OF OIL. The original pot is pretty nice too. Flavorful. Less herbally than expected

The menu has an English side and a Chinese side. The weird part was, we had noticed the Chinese side was considerably larger than the English side. 78 items vs 51 items to be exact. We actually tried to use Bixby vision or whatever its called to see if we could translate the Chinese side but no success. There was a lot of things that we like with our hotpot that the English side did not state. Glancing around at other tables, there were definitely things that was not stated on the English Menu. Some things we noticed were missing was like udon noodles (not sure if they offer this but its a wide variety between all of us), oyster mushrooms, fish balls with roe inside, watercress (unsure if they offer this). We were quite disappointed in the selections available in the English menu. 

Since we had some plans later in terms of food, we decided to order only a few things to try

Both the ""Beef and Lamb Combo"" and ""Beef Belly and Pork Belly Combo"" were pretty good. We had asked the waitress on an estimation about how much meat you'd get per meat order. She estimated around 8-10 slices, which is a fairly good estimate, except the fact of the size of each slice. Of the 2, probably the ""Beef Belly and Pork Belly Combo"" was best, with surprisingly the pork belly being the best of the 4. Both are sliced thinly and rolled up. Not overly frozen like some places. Beef and Lamb combo was decent but considerably less fattier than the other (obviously). The lamb was fattier than the beef. The beef was actually really lean compared to the other 3 meats. 

Tofu Combo (Old and frozen tofu) - not sure how to determine which is which. Both porous. One more than the other. One had a mild sourness to it but its almost hard to differentiate between the two when cooked in the spicy broth. 

Glass Noodle - definitely not the glass noodles we expected. This is more like the mung bean noodle which appears like a dark gray non-translucent rigid noodle but becomes transparent and soft when cooked. Ive had this before at home but first time seeing it out at a restaurant. It is good but definitely not as much as the waitress had mentioned. She stated 1 order feeds 2 people. We ordered 2. There was enough for like, 1 person, after being cooked. It gives a mild chewy texture, which is nice. 

Sweet Corn, Cabbage, Cos Lettuce (Romaine Lettuce), Enoki Mushroom.. Not much could be said about these besides you actually get a decent amount of veggies. Oh ! Sweet corn was pre-cooked and chilled. Kind of weird. You can see the kernels kind of deflated, but they plump back up after you heat the corn back up in the soup. 

Overall, pricing is fairly close to any a la carte hot pot place, like Little Sheep Hotpot. Cheaper than Chubby Cattle.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,7,1,3,unvSzR_4fljRX6cusaFZZA

2308614,2018-02-11,1,1DHPkjDwHBguDZo_HR_ymw,"So I still don't get why this place gets low ratings. I thought it was great and affordable. 
Yes, it's true that a lot of the menu is not in the English version, but If you ask for it they most likely have it.  For instance I wanted shrimp balls and tofu skin that's not on the English side but when I asked they said yes and brought it out. This place is pretty spicy and I like spicy food so I went with the other reviewers and ordered mild and it was the right choice. We did the half and half broth of mild and the mushroom broth. We ordered the beef and lamb combo and also beef belly and pork belly combo for our protein and went with mushroom and tofu combo, napa cabbage, tofu skin, shrimp paste, house special beef balls. 

You can skip the tofu combo. I love tofu but it wasn't that great. The shrimp paste balls and house special beef balls are good and so was everything else.

The sauce was complimentary and they had a wide array of choices for your dipping pleasure.

Staff is super friendly and attentive and they do speak English. Price is decent, they are a lot cheaper than the other hot pot places in town. So happy that vegas is getting more of hot pot selections! Definitely will be back.",PLr7bMKGhB_60lUYVQ1pzw,4,2,4,DGAfAJhsdAsN5BBwFB41cw

2608378,2017-11-07,2,1DHPkjDwHBguDZo_HR_ymw,"This place is not worth a try! I was looking forward to trying this place when it was still under construction. First, the menu is small. They only have the regular hot pot stuff like beef, lamb, veggie, and meat balls. They have no seafood or any special dishes. I guess the most special item in this restaurant is the intestines, brains, and some other animal organs. But dont expect to have a lot of variation because they dont. Second, I ordered a half half soup base, which is half spicy and half original or mushroom flavor. I chose the original flavor. They told me the original flavor is chicken broth but I'm sorry, I dont know where the chicken went... I'm not sure if they forgot about the chicken or the chicken escaped on them or what. Because it have no chicken flavor at all. And I MEAN NO FLAVOR AT ALL!!! The original soup base came out to be milky at first then it slowly become clear. The spicy soup base is very medicine or herbal flavor. It not my taste. But I feel like everyone go there for the spicy soup base. To me the spicy soup base have no flavor like not salty or any flavor other than spicy. At the sauce counter there was msg, salt, and sugar for you to add flavor to it. Other than that you just have to deal with the no flavor broth. Third, the pricing was not expensive but they charge you on some stupid stuff. On the menu there are sauces that you can order and there is prices next to it. But there was also a sauce bar where you can make your own sauce. They charged me $1.50 each. Like for what? For the ingredients you applied for your customers to self serve themselves?? That does not make sense to me at all. The portion was a little small maybe it's because the price is not so so high. But there was another very outrageous thing which is a pitcher of watermelon juice for 16$. I want to ask how much is a watermelon?? Few dollar for like 20lb watermelon. 16$ I can probably get 2-3 watermelon and that juice is more than just one pitcher that feed around 4 cups.... It is just jot worth it. The soup base was expensive. 14$ for a soup base when it only taste like water... like I'll open a hotpot place and give you water for soup base but charge you like $1! I wont recommend this place to anyone. They need to put some more work in it or just close it out.",SY2GOOz_o7UNtWb4gUw1fA,5,1,1,nicoCHbkfXrZfssxZxd8mg

2960451,2018-04-23,2,1DHPkjDwHBguDZo_HR_ymw,"came in here about 2pm after running errands. I was immediately greeted and seated with an AYCE menu. Awesome! But after that.. the server went MIA for a good 10 mins. We ordered the half and half pot (half spicy/half mushroom soup), but she brought us a giant pot of the mushroom soup. After she brought out the correct half and half pot, the food came out really quick.. then I noticed we don't have any dipping sauce. Since she went MIA again, I had to hunt her down to ask if they had any dipping sauces. She told me they have a DIY station (hidden in the corner). Since we ordered half spicy, I started to realize we didn't have anything to drink..  beside the two broths! I had to, once again, get up and hunt her down to ask for water for the table. She dropped off ONE cup of water and disappeared. WTH. I also had to get up and hunt her down a few times just to order more food. The server is super nice, but she's not attentive nor easily spotted. There were three tables around us that left awhile ago, but the server did not bother to turn off the any of the stove. uh, super dangerous! My uncle had to also hunt them down to tell them to turn them off as they did not even realize the empty pots were heavily steaming.  

FOOD: 
If you decide to do AYCE, definitely do not expect average quality food. We ordered tofu, the tofu was drier than a reptile's skin. We ordered beef - they were rough to chew. The veggies were decent. The spicy broth is good, yet super spicy!

3114608,2017-10-27,2,1DHPkjDwHBguDZo_HR_ymw,"I love it here! I've been looking for another hot pot place other than Chubby Cattle and finally this place opened up. I always frequent the Chinatown area and all along Spring Mountain Rd so I was bound to run into this place :]

The location is easy to find as it's right along a main road and not too far from the main Chinatown plaza. The restaurant has a great layout and the decor reminds me of being in Little Asia. 

They have a great selection of meats and veggies and you can choose the spicy level of the broth. But be careful! My family and I asked for ""mild"" and it didn't taste mild at all. I love spicy food, but even asking for light spice will probably be too much to handle for some. If your table's hotpot starts running low on broth, servers will come around and pour hot water for you. Awesome!

According to our waiter Joe, the restaurant has been open for only a week as of today (10/27/2017). We had no complaints about the service and everyone who helped us were friendly.

Pricing is not too bad and seems about the same as other hot pot places. The only downfall for our first visit is that they ran out of a lot of menu items because they've been so busy. But hey.. if they're busy that means it's good right? lol They just gotta upkeep on having menu items ready and prepared.

UPDATE: We came back here the next day because my parents liked it so much. They redeemed themselves from our last visit. They had everything we wanted and service was on point.

Service is good. There's definitely a language barrier, as most of the waiters speak Chinese. Luckily, my girlfriend does speak Chinese and they were very courteous and answered all of the menu questions we had. They didn't give us water though, until we asked. They're pretty quick with giving us the food and filling our broth.

Menu pricing is pretty decent. It's not an all-you-can-eat place, however the menu items are of a definite higher quality comparatively to other hotpot places we have eaten in which makes it worth it. Yes, you do have to pay 1.50 for sauce (it's unlimited, once you get it though)

From the moment you walk in, your greeted by a friendly staff and the aroma of delicious spices coming from all areas in a large style communial tables with large circular stove to accommodate a large pot of delicious broth in various flavor. Everything we had was delicious and fresh. Considering that there is not many places in Vegas that specialize hot pot. What sets this place apart, Chengdu Lao Zao specializes in Chengdu-style hot pot, which distinguishes itself from other hot pot varieties through the use of oil that has been simmered in beef tallow with alot of Red Chile, which is apparent when you order a spicy broth. Do keep in mind that the Mild spicy broth was really spicy, it was like a #9/10. This put our taste buds into overdrive and needed alot of cups of water. We enjoyed everything we had, especially the fish balls and the shumei dumpling!! They ran out of many dishes including various meats that we wanted to out but we had a great time considering they only been open for a week.

Therefore, I try not to do anything that may jeopardize the success of the business. Unfortunately, LaoZao ticked every box on how NOT to run a decent business. Food was OK at best but service was really bad. Not only do they charge extra for sauce, they charge $14 per plate of fatty beef with 4 slices per plate!  They also missed an order of beef and when we told them it was missing, they argued with us saying we got it and charged us for it. When they sat us, the waitress also told us they have a special in which we can purchase a $100 card in which they will apply $110 worth to the bill. So in a sense, you're getting $10 for every $100 worth of card you buy. When the bill came and I proceeded to the register to pay, all of a sudden the guy said the card had to be purchased before the bill. WTF???  Took some going back and forth in which the waitress told the guy she had already told us earlier and that it was ok before he finally honored it. He then proceeded to ask for my ID which I thought was to verify for CC. But then he started typing my info to their computer and asked me to go back to my seat first and they will bring my CC, driver's license, and the bill to the table.  Why in the hell is anyone taking down driver's license info for restuarant payment?  So be careful if they ask for your ID. If I had the chance to do it again, I would just hold the CC in my hand so they can verify it's me to process my CC but NOT let them put my info in their system. Who knows what they'll do with it. The $240 spent was certainly not worth it. 

All in all, I was hoping this is another nice hot pot for me to go as my whole family loves hotpot. With Chubby Cattle down the street, I certainly won't be back.",Si8DkTisffLPS_p_AUNKUg,3,0,1,WdjDKexMhu5j1XtbF5fWpg
4061491,2018-01-29,1,1DHPkjDwHBguDZo_HR_ymw,"My first Sichuan hot pot experience and Chengdu is a-ok with the potential to get better quickly..

Service: As other reviews have mentioned, there is a language barrier with some of the servers but the friendliness makes up for it.  Drinks were fresh and the soup broth was re-filled appropriately throughout the visit. The biggest service challenge was the English menu having less options than the Chinese menu.  We had to use the pictures and contacted friends to work through it. I feel like I've missed out on other great dishes because of the menu limitations.

Hot Pot Food:  We went with the half original and half spicy (mild) for the soup based.  I enjoy the peppercorn spice and spicy foods in general and mild was perfect. The meats, cabbage, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, etc were all fresh and cut perfectly for the hot pot.  My favorite was a purplish shrimp paste that was delicious.  Two orders on the next visit. This was on the Chinese menu and I'm lucky my friend told us about it.  

Ambiance:  A very cool traditional Chinese vibe with dark wooden tables, benches that matches well with the red ceiling and lamps.  The tables leave you plenty of room for many dishes.  The dining area is attractive which enhances your experience.

This place can get pricey quickly if you come here really hungry. This is probably not the place to bring a bougie service dining friend. The food, ambiance, the language barrier with both the service and the menu really makes me like we're actually in Chengdu and I'm a-ok with that.  =)  They're at 3.5 stars for me  currently. Once they fix the menu so that the English side is as inclusive as the Chinese side, we get to 4 stars quickly.  Hopefully the menu is updated on my next visit, but that's another Yelp tale.

I love hot pot and sometimes, my friends and I will do hot pot at home. I also wish that Las Vegas would have more options when it comes to hot pot places so with the arrival of Chengdu Laozao, we have just one more. Chengdu Laozao Hot Pot is pretty much Sichuan style so it is completely different from Chubby Cattle. Chubby Cattle is Mongolian style so the soup bases will be different. 

The interior is decorated every nicely -- it looks really traditional. However, the seating placements may not be the most comfortable, especially if you're tall. If you're tall, your knees will most likely hit the tables so you'll have to end up sitting on the sides of the table. Each table has a little side table at the end to hold all the hot pot ingredients, which is pretty cool. 

For ordering, they give you a menu that you can tick off. You can write how many quantities of whichever one you want. However, the stupidest part about this is...they have English on one side and Chinese on the other. If you can't read Chinese, you're kind of SOL. Why? The English menu is much smaller than the Chinese menu. Since my friends and I can't read Chinese, we weren't able to order some of the stuff we typically like to eat. Fish balls, intestines, oyster mushrooms, and many others were not available on the English menu. I have always felt inadequate since I can speak Cantonese but cannot read the written language but this definitely shoves that inadequacy in my face.

We ended up ordering napa cabbage, lettuce, enoki mushroom, tofu combo, sweet corn, glass noodles, lamb & beef combo, and beef belly & pork belly combo. Most things are pretty normal. The tofu combo is has two types of tofu and once you cook them, you can't really tell the difference. The glass noodles are different than your traditional ones -- they are thicker, and I quite enjoyed them. Their lamb and beef combo had pretty lean beef. The lamb was fattier but both have very good flavor. Their pork belly was actually my favorite. It had a nice texture to it and it wasn't complete fat. 

For their soup base, we decided to go with their half and half: half original and half spicy. For their spicy, you're able to go mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy. We opted for medium. Beware when you're choosing your spicy level. It's not the spicy that will get you, per say. It's the amount of oil and peppercorn that you'll be accidentally inhaling that will kill you. They use a giant amount of the numbing spice peppercorns, so if you don't like the numbing effect, then I don't suggest you get their spicy base. Their original base is actually pretty good and flavorful. I liked their original base more than their spicy base ... because I hate the numbing effect. It doubles when you accidentally bite into a peppercorn too haha. 

The service is pretty decent. They're attentive -- constantly refilling your water cup and when your broth levels go too low, they'll pour more liquid in. There may be a language barrier between you and some of the servers. Not all the servers can speak English, it seems.

Price wise, it's pretty average compared to a lot of the other a la carte hot pot places. The only thing that seems a bit pricey is their soup base. Regardless, our bill came out to be $17 per person so it seems pretty normal compared to a lot of the hot pot places we've gone to in LA. 

Overall, it's decent. I'm not sure if I'd be back though since I don't care for the numbing spice. I prefer Mongolian hot pot soup bases better. Plus, hot pot at home is a tad bit cheaper haha.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,1,3,VpQU7TxHIaqdXSmZXYffhQ
