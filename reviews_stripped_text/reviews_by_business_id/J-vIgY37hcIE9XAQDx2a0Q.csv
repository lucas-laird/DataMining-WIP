Each stall not only was out of seat covers, out of tissue, the trash cans were over flowing and in the top of the cans were tissue with human waste on it. There was no soap or paper towels. One person was in there to use the restroom with me and it was an employee, someone who handles the food they sell. I can only imagine what bacteria is leaving on their hands to our food.

1588297,2015-05-18,5,J-vIgY37hcIE9XAQDx2a0Q,"El Super is gigantic and puts many other ethnic markets in the city to shame in terms of pure size and variety. There's an adequate produce section, large butcher and seafood counter, cheese and ready-made-foods section, bakery (with plenty of pan dulce) and a small dine-in restaurant with ceviches, tacos, burritos, and tortas.

There isn't really any one area here that is done very well, kind of a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" situation- but the pricing is typically very good for most items, particularly meats and seafood. They have weekly sales but I'm not sure where their circular is sent out- I live nearby but do not receive one. They are available at the door and prices appear in yellow to indicate they are temporary.

Store is still new, but is very clean and organized. Some basic knowledge of Spanish is helpful, as not all items have an English translation next to them which can be a little confusing in the deli and produce areas.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,6,3,C95QysdJl5FYq8wn85t_OQ

Regularly has great sales on the meats (my favorite part about this grocery store). Try the marinated boneless chicken thigh to take home and grill up. Also the pastor meat  is really good. Can you tell I regularly have taco nights at my house? Go to the cheese/deli section and get a couple scoops of Mexican (less salty) and Central American (saltier) cream for your American style tacos or nachos, way more flavor than American sour cream. Fresh, well priced produce. Sometimes has long checkout lines :/ 

Good hot food/restaurant section too. I often grab an agua fresca to drink while I shop. Combo plates are good, I really like their chili and cheese tamale.",K8byELF3mfZxbVA_FPVo9w,2,1,5,LhIsXDdWrK-AkCKJiuPUiQ

Less crowds and easier parking are definite plusses, but the produce section is smaller, and the feel of the market is much more Food For Less style and warehousey.  Also the construction on Decatur make it hard to get here and a pain in the ass.

Their prices are right in line with Cardenas. 6 for $1 pepinos, and same 2 for $1 avocados (El Super's are larger!). Meat counter has a lot of choices, even cachete which is probably the closest thing you will find to cabeza without having to actually roast an entire head.

Still I'll most likely be fighting the lines at Cardenas rather than traffic to come here.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,0,0,3,FogFbfytcvuRgCha-63OUg

This El Super just open a few weeks ago and is located in the Sahara Pavillion shopping center. They have affordable produce, I mean 7 cucumbers for $1, you can't beat that. Also, the quality of the fruits and veggies were good in spite of how low the prices were. 

The Seafood section was basic, you can get a few kinds of fishes,  and shrimp. I believe they had scallops, and octopus, too bad they did not have crab legs that would have been awesome.The meat section is okay, going to their butcher might be your best bet because the quality looks good. 

As for everything they seem to have a few of the typical things you can find in most grocery stores, just not a huge selection. The prices here vary from the dirt cheap to a bit over priced by a dollar or two. Other than that they have a nice bakery and a little restaurant where you can get some good Spanish eats. 

I feel like I am mostly going to use this store for produce, and a few impulse buy items, but not the place I can get all of my groceries.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,2,2,3,HUPgR6hCrExCTJ0WKET2wg

This place has great prices on some produce by the pound because I'm always trying to stretch that dollar. It's very clean and organized and they have a bakery along with a restaurant inside if you get hungry while shopping and need some pastries.

3581373,2017-03-12,1,J-vIgY37hcIE9XAQDx2a0Q,"I liked coming here, it is actually one of the closest Mexican market by me. I like that El Super is in a shopping center where you can get a few things done due to type of stores they have around. 

Now the market was very clean and organized, I didn't notice any food with expired dates on them so thats a plus. Everything looked fresh. I ended up stocking up on some meats since I don't live near any markets like these . I got some carne asada, marinaded chicken,ground beef and chorizo. The prizes where excellent I must add. I also stocked up on some dried chilies so I can make salsas. I also noticed they have pan Mexicano which I really wanted but I had already had plenty of carbs and sweets I opted not to get any although it did look and smell amazing. They have a bakery which is always nice and convenient.

I think my favorite section was the cheese and cream section, it felt like I was in Mexico picking up those items so it was a nice little feeling. My second favorite section was there food court area. I treated myself to a torta, it was pretty good. It definitely hit the spot and better than any of the tortas they make in the ""Mexican"" joints they have by my house. 

Overall everything was great here, some of the items they try to rob you on but at the end of the day you probably wont be  able to find it anywhere else which explains the price. Ill definitely be coming back.",TCXHYNo1LWLszdGwrFhvJg,0,0,4,HLDQZnJejfcSEQ0GWSwo0w

The veggies and fruit area is so large and fresh, but really busy. The prices for the produce here is unbelievable too. It is almost like they are giving the veggies away. We came here wanting to explore for a field trip for the twins and their many adventures in learning since they are homeschool. 

On this trip we found cucumbers 4 for $1.00, and bananas 29 cents. The customer service here even hires staff that mostly speak there language where they were born, which is predominantly Spanish. My Spanish is rusty so I go to use it here with the staff in the bakery and when I checked out at the front register. The upper Mangement even walks around and greets customers so worth a look for a unique and different atmosphere in the grocery store.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,12,9,3,KgLWe4HAAOcVB_Xc0M_hnA

It's cheaper than Cardenas with the same quality. I was pretty satisfied that a pack of 8 chicken drumsticks came out to an avg of $2.23! However, you probably won't be able to do all of your shopping here. I wasn't able to find slow cooker liners, paper plates (only foam), and the most disappointing - El Super doesn't make their own tortilla chips (like Cardenas is famous for). Keep in mind about the produce though - if you are used to Smith's and Albertsons (expensive but great quality produce), you'll probably not like it here.",tj6BkHtt8WATGIUbzFQ33A,0,0,3,Y3xJnTuEWAJBzs7DyGTv2Q

5604111,2015-09-17,2,J-vIgY37hcIE9XAQDx2a0Q,"I didn't realize until a few years ago that only crazy, insane people that throw money in the wind buy their produce at places like Albertsons. 
I discovered Cardenas and now my strategic shopping of Costco(everything)/Smiths (meat and fish for tonight's dinner)/Walmart(for stuff I don't need lifetime supply of, like...I dunno...school supplies)/Fresh and Easy (cilantro jalapeño tortillas) includes Cardenas for ALL my produce, canned salsa and chipotle adobo needs. 
 But then the draught hit and Cardenas started charging something stupid for cilantro and I decided to try El Super. 
 It coincided with a brand new El Super opening on my Wednesday morning school drop off route and I went for it. 
 I still like Cardenas for atmosphere- walk into lively music, you got your pinatas hanging from the ceiling, it feels bustling and happy any time of day.
 This particular El Super has an atmosphere about as lively as a morgue. Granted, I shop at 8 am, but still. It feels and looks sterile. It smells like bleach, every time I walk in. Plus I get hit with this weird thing that blasts you at the entrance with automatic hand dryer wave of air, that messes up my glamorous hair and makes me hope my skirt doesn't fly up. That doesn't invoke pictures of enchiladas in my mind and doesn't inspire me to buy avocados. And unlike Cardenas, you bag your own buys (no biggie). Employees at Cardenas always enthusiastically greet me as I thump through eggplants. Here I have one way monologues, apologizing for disturbing their cactus sorting efforts with my shopping cart. 
But..prices of produce are still lowers than current Cardenas, though higher than pre-draught Cardenas. I appreciate that meat counter is open at 8 am, though I still buy poultry, seafood and meats elsewhere- cheaper and quality is better. 
 Overall, it will do.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,3,1,4,GfeLr5gMNzHdWEJDRbd3Bg
