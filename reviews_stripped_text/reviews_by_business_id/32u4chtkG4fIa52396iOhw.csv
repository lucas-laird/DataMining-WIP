Love papa johns pizza when it's done right so I thought I would give them a second chance since I was going to next closes papa  johns for years on boulder highway, so call in a  order using a coupon issued thru a flyer that states its for carry out only but not an online since some of the coupons do state online only but not this one which I had to argue with the call taker then he said he did not recognize the promo code at all,asked to speak with the manager he was the manager, great job job of corporate over sight guys.this one store could run the whole franchise into the ground.",Dp73p__zN1e2V45L30jmhA,0,0,1,QPq01nKFVVb4YmFaphPcYQ

Just oily and soggy to the point where you cant even pick up a slice without everything just falling off and you being left with just a piece of soggy crust.

4039402,2011-08-08,0,32u4chtkG4fIa52396iOhw,"I love Papa John's pizza. 

Not being from New York or Chicago, aside from mom and pop places, the franchise places are all we have. 

Out of em all, I am partial to Papa John's.

This particular one, leaves a bad taste whenever I go. 

I would say I was a regular until the problems started.

I'll list two.

Knowing how long orders take, I call before leaving work to this location to place my take out/pick up order.

I arrive about five minutes after my given estimate time and let the staff know about my order.

They say I never called.

I show them my phone and my call duration with their specified store phone number yet still.. No order for me.

So I leave, of course.. Upset..

Incident number two.

I try my luck a couple weeks later to see if I get better service.

I call before leaving work again for a take out.

They answer, ""thank you for choosing Papa John's, would you like to try our special of any large any topig pizza for 11.00?""

I say yes and ask for a meat lovers and an order of wings.

The order turns out to be 28.00.

I find it weird that my wings would cost over $15 bucks, so I call back to confirm my order.

Speak to the same person who took my order and told him my dilemma.

With a sigh he asks if I have a coupon for the special and reply how the special was offered upon ordering.

Given another sigh from the person I'm granted the special price.

I drive to the place to pick up and plastered on their window and a huge billboard is the special with no mention of coupon.

Needless to say, this place gets a one from me.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,0,0,1,Kfsk64lecBkmoFhhGYtcAg

I ordered online, it was estimated to be delivered in 21-31 minutes and it was! I ordered the 2 LG pizzas w/3 toppings deal and garlic knots. My order arrived piping hot and on time. The only issue I had was I ordered an extra garlic sauce, and a side of anchovies. I didn't get either, but since the pizzas come with the sauce I didn't mind, the anchovies however I called about. The lady I spoke to was super apologetic and helpful, sending the driver back with them. (I called as he pulled away, hoping he just forgot them in his car and could turn around.) The kid showed up about ten minutes later with 2 garlic sauces and my anchovies, and was also very apologetic!

Umm what!?!? So my husband came in the car and told me what happened as we drove off. I called them to complain about what had happened and again when they answer they try and put me on hold right away. so i asked him how long it would take because the last time i called i waited about 20 minutes and i had to hang up and all he said was oh ill be right w you and put me on a brief hold. He answers right away and i complain and ask to speak to the manager and Joey said he was the manager and he was sorry but he could make our pizza in 20 minutes we just had to pick it up. i asked if he could deliver it for the inconvenience, he said he couldnt do that for us and that we would have to go pick it up if we wanted. I got a little upset and asked why if he just messed up my order and i didnt want to go back again for my food and go through the same thing. He then told me he really couldnt deliver it but  he would give me my order for free as long as i picked it up...
