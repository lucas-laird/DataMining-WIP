The bar staff is great and the food is sooooo good I would give it 5 stars but sometimes gets to smoky when it gets busy and we really don't like that but other than that it's a great place where everyone knows you and feels great to feel welcomed!!!,v-Js0zGukunlOVEA1pCABw,1,0,4,tiDkaa80DXLIWlC5Cl6l-w

This is truly a bar you can come to relax with friends or by yourself.

1167421,2016-07-03,4,Gp1NcYpvQpqjcY-RDC31Lw,"When out with my husband for a nice dinner experience, we chose CasaBlanca because we had a wonderful experience in the past, being served by Tom. Today, Saturday it was a terrible experience . Unless you're setting at the bar drinking and gambling,  don't expect to get service.  The old lady server said the she was not able to give us good service because she was working ""along"" although her and the cook we at the bar area socializing. The older lady server said to us ""wave for service"" what's that about? During shift change (5pm) the tall blond lady server grabs a beer, lights a cigarette and also sits at the bar to socialize. Now there are 2 servers ignoring our table. When the cook (nice guy) brought our food to the table, we were able to ask for our drink refills. The refills were not coming like they should. 
BTW: The food was great!
We continued to be neglected. No one check on us after the food was delivered. We finished eating our food. The 2 servers continue to socialize with each other watching the tv screen as if they had nothing to do, as the (blond) continued to drinking and smoking. 
The old lady server has checked out, off the clock and is now sitting at the bar with a bottle of beer, a cigarette in her mouth, purse and money in hand getting ready to gamble. But she never made sure we were taken care of, nor did she tell the blond server about us. When I got up out of the booth to ask for the check, the old lady said ""I'm off the clock, I did know"".  I don't recommend this place for dining during the weekend. VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!",AMMRHG39KCixcpkO1kX0Hw,3,1,1,QSE89o0WBkNZ1R2ZTgoM-Q

If you live on the east side/sunrise area, check it out for drinks, billiards, sports, snacks. You will like it. And so will your wallet.",d5BpyRtd03vpxguCa8NmFg,3,2,5,l2uUGRdfR_5vEObMkqAS3g

Typical bar food but big portions & tasty so points there. HEAVY pour on the drinks.... like throatburning harsh. Music way too loud...have to shout over the sound system. Good for what it is - a neighborhood bar. Don't expect more than that and you won't be disappointed.,pxX6ZRl9tBTcZ6ry9elhmg,0,0,3,kXylu1RYA7bITHUc8T83cQ

They have two pool tables, a video game, darts and a jukebox. They have specials for everyday that change by the day. There food is delicious so far have had the nachos and wings but they are yum!

Not too crowded when I go in and still not crowded by the time I leave.. just how I like it.  They have a full menu of bar food and also have Black Butte Porter, which is one of my favs, on tap.

4163819,2013-06-19,1,Gp1NcYpvQpqjcY-RDC31Lw,"So I have been living in Sunrise Manor for nearly two decades now and this place has been there ever since I've lived here yet I never ventured in. I would always be shocked to see the neon purple lights STILL flashing nearly 20 years later. I seriously thought this place stuck around this long because the owner probably lived inside as I would always only see 1-2 cars in the parking lot.

This time a donned my BGPs (Brave Girl Panties) and finally entered this humble, quaint restaurant/bar. And oh was I ever so happy to. WHY HAVEN'T I VENTURED IN HERE SOONER??!?!  Much to my astonishment, this place is not so bad!! It's spacious, open, ample lighting, tvs, a shuffleboard, video poker, center bar with stools, tables surrounding. And the reason why I probably only saw two cars all the time is because there's ample parking at the north entrance. 

I only had draft Newcastle and it was perfect pricing $3.75. My pseudo-hubster had a Bud and that was only $3.25. Next time I'll have to sample some food and those 4 stars may turn into 5!",FBlKK57447Wt-EUR1TfENw,3,1,4,pE5TWXHvfFiPWADxGPrWAA

-Chicken tenders
-Blue Moon Bottle

This is based off of a one time visit. 

I didn't really get a good vibe from the bartender upon arriving with my friends. I'm not sure if it was, because we were in our early 20s and some of the girls looked young or what. 

I thought I would check this place out since it's 2 minutes walking distance. 

The food was good and the prices were decent, but at a neighborhood bar you'd think you would feel more at home or welcome. 

Maybe if my friends convince me to go, and I'll give it another review.",zd0kqixHUQ067wS7LstovQ,6,3,2,3hHIP-vpORxZkS0tquVaCA

FOOD&DRINKS
I usually order chicken wings and fries which is always on point. The shrimp cocktail is basic but still good. The shrimp basket is also yummy, fried to perfection with a perfect crisp in every bite. They have daily food specials that are so worth it! 

The bartenders learned my drink after the first visit and that honestly made me want to keep coming back. They have a good liquor selection, although the drinks are nothing fancy , they do get the job done! 

Only thing is I wished they served lunch. If you are looking to grab food, they only serve food during dinner hours.",yVUVIA1Zd9DN40CnorwxOA,0,0,4,qJF04aBL10oOeUZi0eFV9g

I came here for my first time with some family and we asked what kind of drinks they could make.  Our bartender, Ron, said that he was down to make anything we ordered as long as he had the ingredients.  He was able to make us a BJ, Alien Brain Hemorrhage, B-52 (like the band lol), and concoctions of his own. 

They also have a jukebox and I love their music selection!  We played everything from Queen to Nsync and ended our night with Semisonic's ""Closing Time."" 

The staff and customers are awesome and this place definitely gave me the Cheers vibe - where everybody knows your name and they're always glad you came.  Check it out if you're ever in the area.  You won't be disappointed!",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,6,1,5,jyTJsw61RzygXw2seySa1Q
