Their drinks were fabulous, Matcha Lotti and Golden Lychee especially so. And their desserts, Raindrops and Early Cotton candys, were also solid. (pun intended) If I had lived in Vegas I would have frequented this place without a doubt. 
On top of their superb desserts and drinks, kind staffs and really cool ambiance convinced me to give them 5 stars.

RAINDROP CAKE: I was on a mission to discover these bad boys. Everyone talks about it and takes pictures, but my mind was questioning it so much. These cakes are water based made with a japanese mix. It is very light in flavor and it is basically a tasteless gelatin. It is best to order it was something to give it flavor. I highly recommend trying the lychee and strawberry raindrop cake. The lychee and strawberry is actually inside the raindrop cake. It is served with a strawberry sauce and a chocolate sauce. This dish has an acquired taste, but it doesn't hurt to try it. I personally really enjoy it being super light in flavor.

FROZEN COTTON CANDY: This was another mysterious dessert. I still have no idea what frozen cotton candy means, but all I know is that it is delicious! You can pick from various flavors like lavender, earl grey, chocolate, and more. The lavender is a great choice for people who like lavender. It has strong flavor and is served with cotton candy on top.***

The cafe is located on the side of a strip mall so it was a bit hard for us to find at first, but we found it ;) The cafe itself was pretty nice and cozy with a good amount of seating areas.  Cafe is perfect to bring your laptop to study, do some work, while having a nice cup of coffee or treat.

Now I can't comment on their coffee or lattes but we did try their frozen cotton candy and raindrop - which were the 2 main reasons why we came. The frozen cotton candy is pretty much a shaved snow drink topped with cotton candy. The cotton candy topping was pretty huge, looked like a piece of cloud floating on top of my cup. I honestly had no clue how to dig into my drink but my kids were happy to help me devour it. The cotton candy itself was pretty much that..cotton candy but I really enjoyed my drink. I love how it was perfectly balanced and not overly sweet. I would definitely come back for this and try the other flavors they offer.

On the other hand, the raindrop, I wasn't too impressed with it. Don't get me wrong, it definitely looks pretty cool and picture worthy which is why the husband wanted to get it. But it was pretty much non flavored gelatin with strawberries and lychee jelly. If you got a piece of the jello itself, it tastes like nothing. But I give them 5 stars on presentation but we probably won't be getting this again.

When I got home, there was still a lot of sugar in my cup. If you like loads of sugar, this is for you. In my case, I did not like all that sugar. 

Next I ordered the shaved ice. It's not frozen cotton candy. I guess I was expecting something like CottonHi in LA. I guess it was my mistake for not asking what it's made with. It's basically shaved ice. I think it's milk ice that they shave. Then they put green tea ice cream and condensed milk in the bottom in layers. 

I love the way they designed the place. Very nice place to study with the classical music playing in the background. The ladies who work their are very friendly and polite. I'll add a star for these reasons.

Completely re-decorated, playing some quiet gentle orchestral music. Has a ""hipster"" kind of feel with the hanging lightbulbs with long filaments, dimly lighting the environment, and shelves with various decor

First time i came here, was after dinner so I was not able to order anything. 2 of my friends ordered the booming dessert world-wide ""raindrop cake dessert"" which consists of a clear slightly sweet gelatin to resemble a raindrop, accompanied by a sweet syrup and powder on the side. They have two selections (original or green tea). Original is with a roasted soybean powder, green tea is with a matcha powder. Interesting style of dessert. Pretty decent but the syrup can be a bit sweet. 

Their main menu on the wall behind the cashier consists of classic teas, fruity teas, signature iced teas, latti, frozen latti, real fruit smoothie, frozen cotten candy (shaved ice), and others 

Second time i had came here, i had tried the matcha frozen latti. not sure what i was expecting but it tasted like a green tea frappachino, maybe a little thinner and not as thick as one from like starbucks. 

Environment is nice and quiet for the most part. Decent amount of small tables for small parties. Only 1 large table but has seating fairly spread apart. Seats are quite uncomfortable.

Earl Grey Frozen Cotton Candy: 5/5
The cost is $4.25 for about a 14 oz cup of shaved ice. The flavoring is delicious! It has a good balance of earl grey flavoring and sugar. It isn't too sweet nor are you overwhelmed by the taste of early grey. On top of the shaved ice and around the cup is cotton candy that looks like a cloud over it. 

Strawberry & Lychee Rain Drop Cake: 4/5
This trending cake is very unique at a low cost of $4.00. The ""cake"" is not actually a cake. It looks like a clear blob. I think this should be in your ""Unique Foods To Try Bucket List"" for sure because it is so weird. The gelatin part does not really have any flavor, but the fresh strawberry and lychee is what made the rain drop cake. On the plate with the cake, Loftti Cafe provides dipping sauces of chocolate and strawberry. I think if you're looking a ""healthy"" dessert, the rain drop cake is what you should order because from what I could tell it's just fruit, gelatin, and dipping sauce. 

The Price: 5/5
This is definitely one of the cheapest cafes I have been to. Most of the places I have been to their desserts average from $5-$7 while Loftti Cafe is around $4-$5 depending on what you get.",3zf53USnWVkoESWD-RswJA,6,4,5,7VoV3zUat3TOpglv0xOruQ

Once you do find it, you will be glad that you did because it is clean and a really cute place. There are several options for drinks (teas, espresso/coffee, ice blended plus boba) and some interesting snack options like their raindrop dessert (gelatin based) and frozen cotton candy(flavored snow ice with cotton candy on top). 

I had a taro latti (ice blended version) with boba. It was delicious - sweeter than other versions - but that is how I like it. They are also pretty generous with the boba because normally I run out of boba halfway through my drink... but not this time! Their boba tasted fresh and had a soft chewy texture (I have been to places who undercook their boba).

I also ordered mine at half sweet and it still tasted way too sweet .__."" The boba was also overcooked and mushy. It should be more chewy or a bit on the firmer side.

Their earl grey frozen cotton candy is still pretty good though. Their frozen cotton candy is shaved ice with whatever flavor you choose & giant cotton candy on top. I don't really eat the cotton candy on top , but the earl grey mixed with shaved ice is my absolute favorite. Very soft and subtle flavor. 

The decorations here are very cute as well as the very friendly staff. I've been here quite a few times already and their drinks/boba are still just not my cup of tea.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,2,2,3,WVo8qmXhIPGQPlaYT7vwlg

The places we usually go were closed and Loftti was open for about another 20 minutes. There was a party seated outside, inside a couple of other people. Decor is very cute, a little dark, or maybe because it was a late in the evening. It did make it feel cozy. Employee was preparing for closing but still helped us with a smile. We ordered an Iced Pistachio Latte and Taro Milk Tea w/Boba. Service was fast, our drinks were ready in about 5 minutes. Got in our car and made our way to the airport. OMG!!! I felt like I just swallowed a bag of sugar. Hoping it was just my drink, but nope, took a sip of my daughter's, and same thing. Maybe it was just a fluke, maybe I shouldn't have walked in right before closing, but either way, both drinks ended up in the trash. I will be back again though, the place is cute and I'd like to give it another try. It could've just been an off night for the employee",TE4mNX7hPerC7BcmZkS8Dg,0,0,3,t2KZCDfXf5QmvYIUgbAsiA

The inside is welcoming and down to earth. The menu was very overwhelming. We skipped most of the common desserts as dessert places like this are now a dime a dozen in Richmond, BC, however, one of the things that we haven't experienced at home enough is the rain drop cake which is a clear gelatin cake that looks like a rain drop. I know that the Richmond night market had one, however, it wasn't traditionally served with nuts and syrup. These guys served it the traditional way which surprised me.

Raindrop Cake - 2/5 // When Loftti first opened, the first thing I wanted to try was the famous raindrop cake. The flavor is extremely light (practically flavorless to me, imo) so it is necessary to have something paired with it. At the time it was paired with a red bean sauce and soy flour, but it was still nothing extravagant to me. The experience was awesome for another photo of a unique dish, but it wouldn't be something that I would recommend for my friends to try.

Matcha Frozen Cotton Candy - 5/5 // I've seen a bunch of photos of this cotton candy mystery and I honestly didn't know what it was until I finally ordered it. The lady at the cashier described it as shaved ice with cotton candy on top, but honestly the texture of the dessert was more like shaved snow. I was actually expecting shaved ice, but I was pleasantly surprised that its texture was more like shaved snow for a light and fluffy body.

I've gone to a lot of coffee/tea places in Las Vegas and by far this is the place with the cheapest loose leaf hot tea. ($2 for a small!) There are plenty of seats if you need to work on something productive or just hang out with your friends.

They have a loyalty star system that collects your number to keep track of your purchases. After 10 stars, you can get a free drink or shaved ice!",8RuySv_b1YVWVK_0mMqKOw,2,1,5,EMKEoPtWOHW0_qBO26oUfQ

As for their raindrop cake, I would pick either the green tea or strawberry and lychee. I don't recommend the original or regular unless you like your desserts to be plain and not sweet.

Being Korean, with a Korean server, the customer service was perfect! She was able to communicate with my parents in Korean while speaking in English with me. Also, she was super cute and friendly! 

I got an iced tea that was a blend of peach and hibiscus. I believe it had a third flavor but I can't recall what it was. It was super good and refreshing! They had a great selection to choose from as well, so I'm excited to go back and try some more 

I also got the frozen cotton candy. It's basically very thin, shaved ice with whatever flavor you choose. I got matcha and it tasted great! Soft and subtle with yummy matcha cream (I think) underneath the ""cotton candy"" on top. 

LASTLY, MY FAVORITE PART! This cafe has raindrop cake. For those of you that don't know, it's a dessert that was developed in Japan I believe. It's a small ""cake"" that resembles a raindrop!

My friend and I had just eaten lunch at Lake Las Vegas and were in the mood for boba, so we decided to drive all the way to this side of town for a drink! Because let's face it, we all know there's no decent boba spots in Henderson.

Loftti Cafe is a bit hard to find if you're not familiar with the area. It's hidden in the very corner of a strip mall. Upon entering Loftti, we were greeted by a very soft spoken, yet super friendly employee. She could tell that it was our first time by the way we looked at the menu, so she offered to explain their options to us. 

Of course we ordered everything but the boba that we originally came for! We ordered two of the Frozen Cotton Candy desserts with the coffee flavor and one original Raindrop Cake. The Frozen Cotton Candy was actually really good. I loved the ice part of the dessert. It tastes just like H√§agen-Dazs coffee ice cream, but a smooth shaved ice texture. The cotton candy was a nice touch and added the perfect amount of sweetness, but I would definitely eat the shaved ice by itself! It was rich and creamy... Something I would definitely order again! The Raindrop Cake however, that's a different story! Two words- Weird AF! Or is that technically three? I had to try it after seeing it being circulated on my Facebook timeline a million times. It was definitely unique and worth trying, but it's not something that I would have to eat again. The concept is almost like that of Jell-O, but without the flavor. The soy flour and sugar syrup topping was definitely needed!

Overall, a really cute cafe to catch up with a friend or get some studying done! I loved the decorations on the shelves in the back... It reminded me of a bunch of random things you'd find in an old attic!

I never had real Rain Drop Cake in Japan but I tried to make it myself about two years ago when I saw a recipe on YouTube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCQUMAD-Jao) Nope, I couldn't make it as good as the picture so I forgot about it until I recently saw it on Yelp. 
The Rain Drop Cake is perfect for someone who's watching calories. I don't think it has any calories (if anything 15 or so) but sweet and refreshing. Perfect for summer. Kinako soy bean powder and green tea syrup matched perfect with the Rain Drop Cake. Some may say it's just a tasteless, colorless Jell-O, but I do not think so. It's better. I can't wait to have Original (Kuromitsu black sugar syrup) version!!
I also had their Jasmine tea (unsweetened). Freshly brewed and delicious.
The girl (I think she's Korean) was so nice and friendly. I can tell she's the kind of a person that can still put a nice smile on her face even if she was having a bad day. Thumbs up for her :-)

2926439,2016-10-12,0,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"I'm so glad I live like 5 min away from this place because their drinks are amazing.

My favorite drink is their Royal Thai. It is similar to Thai tea except it is much more creamy and richer. I also like their taro latti because it is not too powdery like at other places. My friends tried their honeydew latti and also really liked it. 

I also tried their famous rain drop dessert but this was a miss to me. The drop itself is gelatin like and doesn't really have flavor. If you mix it all up then it mostly taste like sesame to me in my opinion, besides that, there's no sweetness or really any other flavor. The presentation of the dessert itself is really nice but I would not get it again. 

Their cotton candy cloud desserts are just basically snow fluff with cotton candy around it, which can get messy to eat.

Service is very nice and quick. They also have a reward system that does not require a stamp card. You just insert your phone number and that's where all your rewards will be collected, which is very convenient for people who tend to forget or lose their stamp cards.

Even though their desserts are a miss to me, I love their drinks and will always come back for them.",4aRespr3mEIxRRoW9tio2A,1,0,5,Tn38kgDO3ogL-HL49RwFTA

Not only does Loftti Cafe have a variety of unique menu items, I really dig the atmosphere. It doesn't try to hard to follow a basic trend and really develops its own voice. The attention to detail in the interior is immediately noticable-The big, dark wooden table with the pull-out chairs, the bookshelf full of antique books and wacky figurines and the magazine rack that spans nearly to the ceiling.

The blush peach is heralded and rightfully so. I am a big fan of the blush peach tea as it taste sweet but not over the top. I don't have a big sweet-tooth and the blush tea being pretty moderate is like a match made in heaven for me.

The cotton candy slushii/shaved snow is really cool. Not only is it Instagrammable af it's quite tasty too :D I haven't had cotton candy in ages so it was pretty nostalgic for me. On the bottom is a slushii treat that is amazing in its icy, refreshing goodness.

3041359,2016-10-21,5,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"Another caf√© has opened and their Japanese raindrop cakes are only what sets them apart from other establishments. 

I was super stoked to try their raindrop cake so I tried it with green tea sauce. Unfortunately for me, the new employees dumped too much kinako (soybean flour) so when I took a bite, I choked and my throat stayed itchy. 
Other than that, it's just about calorie-free so I didn't expect much in taste. It was nutty from the flour though. Would I order it again? Maybe if a friend really wanted it and asked to share.

I came back another time to study with friends and decided to order a royal Thai latti (a Thai tea slush) with boba. To be honest, I was disappointed because it was made from powder and there wasn't much boba either. The amount of money I spent on that drink could have went to a drink from Brew Tea Bar. 
Aside from the negative Nancy complaints, the service was good and no doubt the ambience was fairly comfortable. The employees consistently checked up on us and cleaned up our tables quickly when we finished our raindrop cakes. The decor was radically unique as well. 

Let's say if I ever do come back to study, I'll probably just order an iced tea.

3114586,2017-01-23,2,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"First off, this cafe does have two things that set it apart from others. That would be the Raindrop Dessert/Cake and the Frozen Cotton Candy.

The Raindrop Cake reminds me of the lychee jelly cups you can get from most Asian supermarkets. My mom used to buy them for me and my siblings when we were kids. They taste very similar and both have the same exact texture. These Raindrop Cakes are no different and are just a bigger version of them.. served on a plate. If it wasn't for the strawberries and lychee in the one that we ordered, we would have just been eating a glob of flavorless gelatin. Definitely not the dessert to make a drive for.

Their Frozen Cotton Candy is another treat that I thought was pretty original. Plus, it's the first that I know of in Vegas. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, and the small cup that it comes in makes the portion just right. Some of the flavors you can choose for this dessert are Milk, Matcha, Coffee, and Earl Grey.

Now for the unpleasant part of our visit.. I'm a pretty patient person when it comes to customer service and I like to give businesses a second chance to redeem themselves, even if my first impression was not a good one. So with that being said... Here's our experience.

Around the time that my siblings and I arrived, which was shortly after 11:30 PM, there was one girl working behind the counter. She came to greet us as soon as we walked in, but already seemed to be irritated. She didn't ask us any questions and just stood there. No biggie. While looking at the menu, my bro asked me about their Matcha and what I would recommend, since I've tried this place before. Right when I was going to say something back, this girl had to blurt out what Matcha was, like we didn't know, and gave us a look of irritation. Umm.. Ok? Strike two. Before answering my bro, I thought I'd ask about the frozen cotton candy's Milk flavor. There was no description for it on the menu, so I asked if it was a ""Milk Tea"". The girl didn't answer my question and tried to educate me on something else. I asked again, but she started talking about other menu items they offer. So my sis jumped in and asked to clarify the flavor. Again, girl tries to inform us about something else, but in the middle of our question! Why do you have to talk over our voice? How do you know what we're asking if you're not listening? Sis asked again, but in a different tone, and finally we got an actual answer. For a second there, it looked like an argument was about to go down! She gave us a lil attitude so my sis gave it back. She needed a taste of her own medicine. Right before we left, she came by to ask us what we thought. Ignoring what had happened earlier, we complimented on the uniqueness of the desserts. Her demeanor did a 360 because she acted way different from before. Guess she got the memo.
 
So, in short, I won't be coming back for awhile. As much as I enjoyed the frozen cotton candy, it will just have to wait until next time.",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,7,5,3,1P7jsVgSUdw02hidmVIhMA

The smoothie were on the small side despite being a large.  Their competitors have a much better value.
   The bananas in my smoothie were not ripe which gave the smoothie a bad taste.  The Mango smoothie was ok.  The service is good and the interior is really nice.

The atmosphere is one of the most important aspects when it comes to cafes. Loftti has its own color that we have not seen in Vegas so far. Furnitures, wall arts, and little decorations all come together to creat Loftti's own rustic, yet modern atmosphere. We stayed there for a while because it was just so comfortable. 

We tried the original Raindrop dessert, Matcha Frozen Cotton Candy, and Blush Peach tea. All of them are unique to Loftti. The cotton candy and the peach tea were on point!

The frozen cotton candy coffee and matcha was very good, it had a milky but frozen texture. Very satisfying. 

We also tried the original and green tea rain drop. It was refreshing the cake part had no taste but the sauce on the side made it good. Be careful with the powder ! 

My brother was impressed with the Americano and my sister in law liked her taro boba, she said the Boba was fresh and soft. I didn't get to try cause they tore it up.

Overall ambience of the caf√© was very rustic, quirky with a modern twist. The staff could improved, because I felt like I was being treated as if I was uneducated. I didn't get her name but she could use a lesson in, ""Humility."" The few items we got were ok. The raindrop cake was flavorless. It was like Jello from the hospital but the presentation was cool and IG worthy. The Frozen Cotton Candy was good. It was probably something I would come back for. The light sweet taste of cotton candy mixed with the frozen coffee mixture was delicious. Not too sweet and bitter but balanced.

Overall not a bad place to gather with friends or have a study session. I wasn't able to try any of their drinks but if Im ever in the area, I might give them a second chance.

I've tried a few drinks from them before and this time I ordered an iced Jasmine Green Latti and it's perfect if you love tea! I also love the shop's ambiance; the decorations and set up looks amazing and also feels cozy. This would make a great spot for studying, doing homework or even catching up with a friend. Customer service here is also excellent; the girls that work here are friendly and gave me recommendations on what to try this time. I'll definitely be back and want to try other items on the menu.",34v-F0IrcSD8XPniAzSXdQ,4,2,5,Fc3iZ5Rti6EYUkxb8g6tIA

It's hard to stand out in this part of town if you are a cafe - boba tea places are everywhere! Loftti makes a name for itself with original iced tea blends, their tea lattes (great if you're looking to avoid caffeine!!!) and their shaved ice desserts topped with cotton candy (SO instagrammable)! The decor and aesthetic inside is cohesive and trendy. The baristas (barisTEAs?) are always friendly and answered any and all questions we had. My vegan husband actually forgot to order his drink with almond milk once and the barista actually remade his drink for him! (We would never normally expect someone to do this, but it was SO thoughtful; we were seriously impressed.) 

Our family comes here all the time as a treat, and it's a great place to bring out of town guests or anyone you'd like to show something new or a little bit different.",n-Hit0Y3O6FxTiEhdEEsZw,6,5,5,fDwK1aMSmrjUV72SzLcZIQ

4005998,2016-08-28,8,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"Everyone seems to be talking about Lofti cafe and their raindrop cake so I decided to join the bandwagon and try it. Yes, it will make for a cute Instagram pic but it's nothing to go apeshit over. 

Establishment is nicely done. It has a nice warm and cozy feeling with some great jazz music in the background. Big table in the middle is perfect for studying with outlet plugs dangling down from the ceiling which can charge up to 6 laptops. I really dig the classy + hip vibe here.

Servers were friendly and greeted us with ""we've been waiting for you"" to set the casual tone. After some interactions, we ordered their original raindrop cake and jasmine latti with boba. 

Raindrop cake itself doesn't have any flavor. You have to mix the syrup and powder that comes with it. I had expected that their raindrop cake would be similar to mochi and have that sticky texture. Instead, it was jello-like and very soothing, almost as if there is some kind of herbs inside. Very delicate and light dessert which is perfect to cool off in the hot Vegas heat. 

Would I go back for it? Maybe, but considering it's something that can be easily made at home, I'm not crazy over it. 

Upon ordering my drink, a server had told me how they take pride in their drinks. ""Unlike all the other boba shops in Vegas that uses all artificial syrups/powders with old/stale boba, we use freshly brewed teas and make fresh boba every day."" I was surprised to hear this because I can name at least 5 boba shops in Vegas that brews teas/make fresh boba. 

My jasmine latti (jasmine milk tea) was one of the worst rendition I have had. It had an unpleasant herbally/minty taste which I am most decidedly not a fan of. Boba was a glob of disappointment. I am 120% sure that it wasn't fresh. Wasn't warm and not cooked all the way. In fact, it was very similar to one of those ""cook at home"" boba you can get at any Asian supermarket. I was a little disappointed with my drink overall.

At the end, the same server informed us that we can get one free 16oz drink by writing a Yelp review. I'm not really fond of that idea of luring people to write a review for free things...perhaps I have ordered the wrong items but I won't go out of my way for this cafe.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,13,7,3,e-BERKUKn8KrbuQpwkqutw

This place's ambiance and decor is relaxing yet has lots of character. It's dim but well lit enough to do some studying or any kind of work (which you'll see many people do here). Lots of little statues and books that give it character. 

The actual product is great. I ordered an iced golden lychee tea and a ham and cheese croissant. Both had lots of flavor and I thoroughly enjoyed it along with the ambiance.

The service is fantastic. A friendly hello as soon as you walk in, everyone looks relaxed and happy, and for the most part they leave you alone to enjoy your coffee/tea unless you need something. I received my tea in a few minutes after ordering and croissant about 10 minutes after ordering. 

The price is very reasonable. For my tea and croissant sandwich, I paid about $9. I love that some places keep their product high with reasonable pricing. 

Little add on- The place is extremely clean including the restrooms and there are tons of options from coffee to tea to desserts to smoothies to specialty drinks and some sandwiches.

4122617,2016-08-05,1,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"The jiggly raindrop desert finally hit Vegas!

Since this was the main reason we came to Loftti, it was already a given that we were going to order that. However, with much help from the 2 nice girls behind the counter, we were able to choose our two boba drinks: Royal Thai milk tea and a Jasmine Green latti with boba. After ordering, we went to sit in the comfortable sofas to wait for our food.

The drinks were brought out first. A latti just seemed like a regular boba drink, but we were pleased with the quality. However, someone in the group pointed out the tapioca balls were a bit chewer than usual.

Next, the spotlight desert! For all who don't know what raindrop desert ($3.50) is, it's a jiggly blob made out of mineral water and agar (the thing that gives it a Jell-O-like consistency). Since the cake itself has almost no taste, it's served alongside roasted soybean flour (kinako) and a sugary syrup called kuromitsu. When it was brought out to us, the girls instructed us to mix the flour and syrup together before eating. Thankfully they told us, because separately they were disgusting. After mixing the two to create a paste with the wooden spoons accompanying the desert, we dug in!

Don't expect any flavor from the cake itself. All the nutty, sweet flavor you will get is from the paste you create. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised! The flavor wasn't too overpowering. Since it was about the size of the palm of my hand, you really pay for the amount you get.

Would I drive all the way across town for sone Loftti? Not necessary. But would I come and stop by if I'm close by for some desert and boba? Why not!",Nv3PWqYZ47GQuG0p8u4uQg,2,2,4,JdqnZVWwdR9sEUDOCJFX3A

He then mumbled something to which I replied ""what was that?"" And in a rude and loud tone, he told me my total. I ordered a drink WITH boba which is also said in my receipt, but had no boba when I got it. So I went back to tell him that there was no boba in it, and he told me that I didn't ask for it. I showed him the receipt and he just stared at me. So I told him to add the boba and I'll just pay for it. No communication from him whatsoever.

4215284,2016-08-03,27,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"Decided to come here before dinner one night (Oh, didn't you know? Dessert before dinner is definitely the new norm for foodies like me lololol XD) since they were about to close in 30 mins at the time, and it was a week after opening. Needless to say I regret nothing because when I walked in I was genuinely surprised and delighted to be greeted by an adorable friend of mine actually working there whom I haven't seen in months (Hi Namhee~!! )! After having a cutesy moment of nostalgia, I asked her of their specialties, best sellers, and what she personally likes. 

I ended up getting the Blush Peach iced tea and Serena Honey fruity tea for drinks, and got the Earl Grey Cotton Candy shaved ice dessert to start my appetite for the night. Make sure to mix the shaved ice well or you won't be getting the full effect of the flavor. Blush Peach wasn't overtly diabeetus to me which is good since I barely drink iced teas. Serena Honey does well for those under the weather since it had honey and hints of ginger, but it wasn't overpowering in taste either. 

The ambiance of the cafe reminded me somewhat of Cafe Darak, but more earthly tones and neutral color schemes. Some of the trinkets made a nice touch to the overall atmosphere but it wasn't overbearing either. The background instrumentals were on point which gave the cafe a more subtle and tranquil feel so it could possibly be the next spot for students who like to study in cafes without so much distraction. I mean, I'm satisfied enough just coming here to drink, eat, and have memorable conservations with friends haha!

I ended up coming back in the following morning with good company and got the Scarlet and shared the Raindrop Dessert. A few of the coworkers remembered me from the previous night so yay! Scarlet ice tea was a nice deep shade of red and had a decent taste of blood orange in it, but surprisingly neither sour nor too sweet. I was able to finish this off pretty quickly lol. The Raindrop Dessert wasn't amazing, but its interesting to say the least. Make sure to mix the sauce til its moist before eating it with the raindrop-looking cake. It tasted like jello mixed with grounded graham crackers, which isn't bad but not exactly something I would eat repeatedly. I also had a few sips of my friends drinks, both being iced teas - Sun Drop and Emerald. Sun Drop was a bit too sweet to me but it almost tasted similar to Scarlet. Emerald intrigued me as it had yuzu, and I did enjoy the citrusy flavors that blended well together so I'll consider getting that next time. I haven't tried any of their milk teas or the rest of their cotton candy shaved ice but I definitely will in the near future! :D",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,33,33,5,FhYZnzCUG5ZdqWqip4m2eg

When my friend arrived, we ordered what we came here for: the rain drop cake. We personally did not like it. The flavor of the cake itself is a little bland and the soy flour and red bean syrup did not add any sweet qualities.

Sometimes a place might make their drinks too fast and the drink will be powdery or watery but Loffti Latti's are always perfect.

Why: The service we receive at Loffti is exceptional. The staff is so friendly. The fact that it's one of the closest ""boba"" cafe's to us is a big deal. We can pick up a drink on the way out before starting out errands or pick one up on the way home after a long day. The decor at Loffti is modern and inviting. The place is always spotless.

4352209,2017-04-10,2,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"I really enjoy Loftti from the uniqueness of the interior to the drinks themselves. 

In terms of the decor, think of Loftti as the love child of a West Elm and a Crate & Barrel. They went for a glass pane kind of menu board and mid-century modern furniture, and besides the interior, the drinks and service were great! If you're here to study, they have hanging electrical outlets hanging above the large central table that you can just pull down. There's outlets next to the blue couch, and two others next to the bookcase in the back. The tables are kind of small which is the only downside if you're looking to study. But hey, it's a cafe and not a library, so I'll take it.

I didn't try the raindrop cake or the cotton candy dessert, but we had the hot americano and a 16oz white coconut latti (milk tea) instead. The americano was smooth and pretty tasty overall. They don't specialize in coffee, but if you're looking for a decent americano, you won't be disappointed. It comes with a high lid that is supposed to pool the coffee in the lid, and this is supposed to cool down the drink. I thought this was really novel and something I've never seen before.

The white coconut latti was amazing. I usually don't go for any other milk teas besides my usual (thai iced tea, jasmine milk tea, or almond milk tea), but I was feeling pretty zesty this weekend. This doesn't taste like an artificial coconut flavor but rather, it tastes like the real thing. It's got some density/slight creaminess to it, and it's a subtle coconut, not an overpowering flavor.

The customer service was great. She was very friendly and helpful when it came to choosing drinks since it was my first time. Overall, the employees are very nice.

All in all, the cafe is beautifully designed/decorated, the employees/staff are accommodating and friendly, and the drinks (especially the white coconut latti/milk tea) are great. 10/10 would come back if I didn't live so far away.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,4,3,5,g3WBzJ63qjlBedAbOaU3FQ

For the cake, I was kinda disappointed?  It really does not taste like anything. Basically I am just tasting the syrup and the grain that they put in it, its just that. Nothing too fancy, nor new about it. It was not really that great so I guess I am not trying it out anytime soon. 

For the Matcha boba, it was good, okay. I kinda felt like there is too much powder that it did not blend well. They do have other interesting flavors that got me curious, something like with hibiscus, I would love to taste that next time.

4620883,2016-07-30,0,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"I was going to wait until my next visit to review when I try the raindrop dessert, but the Salted Caramel Frozen Latti was too good so I just had to write my review while I still have the taste of heaven in my mouth! As soon as I stepped inside the establishment, I could tell I was in for a treat. It was later at night and there was a family seated near the entrance, but the overall mood of the place was calm and relaxing. The menu is on the wall behind the counter and is basically broken into: hot tea, iced tea, frozen tea, fruit smoothies, shaved ice, and others.

I ordered the Salted Caramel frozen latti and Taro frozen latti. It took just a bit longer than anticipated for my drinks to be ready, but it seemed like only two women were working at the time, and the family before me were only starting to get their order. The women were very polite, as someone else on here mentioned. I asked if they make the raindrop dessert to-go, but sadly they don't; I couldn't try it on this visit due to time constraints. That's another reason for me to come back!

The salted caramel was pure heaven! I could taste notes of sweet caramel and, at other times, the saltiness. It was surprisingly not super sweet at all. I tasted the taro and it was just as yummy. I could taste the distinct flavor of taro which was not masked by an excess of sweetness. It also did not have that graininess you sometimes taste from the powdered mix. The 24oz is perfect for one person and you will most likely not want to share!

I think this will be my new boba spot from now on! I know another boba spot opened down the road from here, but I'll probably be coming to LOFTTI instead!

EDIT: The raindrop dessert was fantastic. They explained that you should swirl the powder and sauce in a circle around the raindrop and then eat it. All of the flavor comes from the sauce. During this visit I also got the honeydew frozen latti and the matcha frozen cotton candy. The honeydew was perfect. It had the perfect amount of sweetness which complemented the honeydew flavor so well. The frozen cotton candy is reminiscent of snow ice, but not nearly as thick and is very light in flavor. Everything is so yummy!",0nDeoyxAaWHcihihxiIa3A,3,3,5,AezZseWDk6ztcV-1uSkxzg

You definitely taste the earthy tea flavor and the sweetness level was just enough to qualify it as a dessert. The snow texture was super fine, so it melted easily upon eating. I enjoyed that aspect of the snow dessert.

The candy fluff was ok. It was not cloying sweet like most cotton candy, but it adds an extra texture to the melting snow in the dessert. Maybe better for taking pictures or wearing as a Santa beard as I did for fun. The wooden spoons are neat, but they were a weird shape so when you scooped the snow and ate it the spoon didn't glide smoothly empty.

Both were very interesting treats that satisfied my inner foodie.

All components should be together, if eaten separately it's kind of unpalatable. *Cough* Don't be like me and choke on the powder. 

If you're looking for a caffeine buzz you probably won't find it here. They offer teas, blended drinks, lattis (not espresso based), and smoothies. The only coffee is an Americano. Boba can be added to your drink.  I enjoyed a taro frozen latti and a white coconut frozen latti. It was a nice sweet, non-caffeinated treat. 

I didn't get a chance to try the frozen cotton candy on my first visit, but will order it next time!

The ladies at the counter were sweet, helpful and I was impressed with their customer service. There is a complimentary self serve water, which is always a plus at a cafe that offers sweets.

My friends and I actually came here the first or second week of their opening just because I wanted to try their dessert. I've seen this dessert in a restaurant in NYC and have been wanting to try it!

The location of Loftti is where Monster Caf√© used to be at I believe. It's kinda in a weird spot -- tucked to the side of the plaza. Once you walk in, the colors and decors give off a very vintage yet modern feel. They have a couch in the middle and an abstract bookcase by the back. 

Aside from the raindrop dessert, I decided to try out their frozen salted caramel latti while my friend tried their coconut latti. Their salted caramel latti was actually quite good. It had tinges of saltiness at the end of the drink after the sweetness has hit you. It wasn't overly cavity causing sweet, and I appreciate that greatly. My friend was only so-so on his coconut latti. It was a huge heavy coconut flavor to it ... almost seems artificial. 

As for the raindrop dessert .. well, there isn't much to say with that. It does come with roasted sesame powder and brown syrup. The dessert itself is just flavorless jelly. It's made with gelatin and agave so .. really, you're just tasting the powder and the syrup. Not that great and not something I would get again. It was fun to poke it and jiggle it around though. 

Overall, an okay place. I can't say that I'm in love. I also can't say that they have anything for me to keep coming back for. But I think it'd be nice to hang out here.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,3,3,GxziI3tDMHJQbh4MRiqKQw

I will definitely be coming back and maybe I'll try their shaved ice or sandwiches. You must visit this place!",6AOD3zm1dsxUL8A8KrALHg,3,1,4,sdYVDUoa4hERptUhiIMD5Q

5519381,2016-08-01,0,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and we were the only customers, considering this place has just opened up. I came here after a few recommendations, and was excited to try their raindrop dessert. While browsing through the menu, they took the time to explain to us what each of the items were..essentially latti is milk tea, frozen latti is ice blended, and cotton candy is shaved ice. We ordered an iced matcha latti, iced taro latti with boba, and the raindrop dessert. I usually don't like any matcha lattes/milk teas when the matcha powder is overpowering and makes the drink very grainy. But this one was one of the best matcha milk teas I've had in town. It was just slightly grainy but just about the right amount for you to know it was made with real matcha powder. Not too sweet at all but very full and flavorful. I tried my friend's taro latti and it was equally good, and the boba isn't too sweet on its own to overpower the milk tea. I've never had the raindrop dessert before so I don't have a previous experience to compare this one with. But it's a very good dessert, especially for the price of $3.25, and overall a fun experience that is definitely worth trying. 

We sat on the couch against the wall facing the glass windows. It's a very comfortable and welcoming space and I can definitely see myself getting work done here. Where the couch is located, you can't actually see the counter where the drinks are served, allowing a pleasant sense of privacy. There is a larger study table toward the middle, and smaller and more intimate tables toward the back, where there is also a wall of magazines (of mostly interior architecture/design, which I have no complaints about). The service was great, a very friendly staff.

I like everything this place offers, but only wish they served coffee. The only coffee item on their menu is Americano, and if there was a bigger selection of coffees I think I would definitely come here even more often than I will. Perhaps this is more of a dessert-drinks type of cafe, but I think if they offered coffee they would attract even more customers, because their drinks are already great. Loved it, would definitely come back!",Sl8weP49PZG2VeWqU2yf-g,1,2,5,TvVxnBUNTvxLQfxtoTURug

I'd say it's on par with Kung Fu Tea; the difference is in the consistency of their milk teas, in which Loftti's has a creamy consistency. 

It's definitely a great place to go to if you want pastries/desserts to go with your drinks, as their desserts are pretty tasty. I always come back for their honey black milk tea and banana nut muffins, and those raindrops don't disappoint either. Definitely a place I'd recommend to take the time to check out.",pqv3nCFbcQLTqTB6yzGE8g,0,0,5,4K14H0YYuHbmA3CLUYLKQg

I was very impress on everything we had. My emerald tea was very refreshening, and the honey black tea holds plenty of flavor. The ambience is a best place to just socialize or catchup on some studying. 

Customer service was very excellent, and well mannered towards their customers. Definitely will be a new go-to spot when I get the cravings for boba.
Would like to try their frozen cotton candy next time and smoothies. Hopefully sooner or later they will have stamp cards. Come to loftti caf√© !!!!!! :D",w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,2,4,5,y6suUOG1UKNdNr9FjeaQiw

The interior is cute and has a lot of seats. It looks like a great place to do homework and or study at. 

I got the raindrop dessert and for the price, it's satisfying. The kinako and red bean sauce really helps! I also got an iced tea which I believe was called sun drop? It was very refreshing and super cheap. The whole menu is actually pretty affordable and pretty unique which is a plus. 

Still need to check out a couple of drinks and their frozen cotton candy. Hoping they might use a stamp card system soon as well, but that's just my preference. Other than that this place is great!",F349NTO-f_Xgg0CHnwKzBQ,2,2,5,ZvnkLvJ-KM8JDVOZy8aLQg

Food/drinks: I tried the rainbow matcha cake. It was my first time having rainbow cake so I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I liked the jelly texture and the matcha powder went with it kind of well. If you don't like straight up matcha though, I wouldn't recommend it. I've also had iced coffee there too, but I feel like it's on the weaker side. 

Service: they're all really friendly, asking if you want to join the loyalty program. Drinks comes out pretty fast. 
Wifi is also fast which is essential for me. 

Atmosphere: it's a little too dark inside which strains my eyes when I'm working there too long. The best lighting you get is at the communal table or next to the window.

5734908,2016-08-14,1,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"In the same plaza as Dairy Queen, Rainbow & Robindale (southwest corner). 

Friendly staff and service. Menu is very simple, although you might have to ask what some of their stuff are but they are more than willing to educate you. On my first visit she asked me if we've been here before and then proceeded to explain their menu. Latti are their milk tea. Cotton candy is their shaved ice. It's in a small cup and it's pretty great. They have 4 flavors of that, and I've tried milk (condensed milk pretty much), coffee, and earl grey. I liked all of them. Will be trying their matcha flavor next time I'm in.

Their raindrop dessert is what's got all the people wanting to come in (at least for me) since it's so appealing visually. It's not anything to go crazy for, in terms of taste, but it's fun to get. The brown powder is roasted soybean powder, I believe, and depending if you get regular or green tea, that's their sauce. I've tried both and they're pretty decent.

I've yet to try their Latti as all I've had was their hot jasmine green tea. So far so good for everything. Their tables are pretty small (and round) except for their one big table as you enter the cafe, but the seats are kind of spaced out. This place is pretty good if you're coming with maybe one other friend or by yourself to work on stuff. Wouldn't really recommend coming here with a big group.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,2,0,4,0oChhmkToYGMEhIcPn0zWw

5863309,2017-06-20,0,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,"If you're going to Loftti, I recommend trying the Earl Grey Milk Tea. Out of all the milk teas my friend and I have tried in Vegas, this one is our favorite, and it will probably stay that way for a while. Along with the milk tea, we also tried the rain drop cake that they had. The rain drop cake itself doesn't actually have any taste, it's like a bland piece of jello. However, they were innovative in adding strawberry slices and serving it with chocolate syrup. This makes the dessert somewhat more refreshing than it could've been without the strawberry and the chocolate. One of their specialties is the cotton candy cloud as a topping for your drink. The cotton candy is not too sweet, so if you want to try something different this can add some fun to your drink. The place is also very quiet. If you are looking for a place to study while sipping your boba, try going to Loftti.",21qMeM1WMRi0Tn3Lqo-C1g,0,0,4,32LKz4EBOSuHqVRAtFYdlA

Definitely coming back here to study and chill with friends! 

There is a downside here but it doesn't affect my rating to this place. The location is a bit small so it does tend to get packed and parking can be a problem.

I had to try the frozen cotton candy which I believe is just shaved ice with a huge cotton candy topping-we did the Earl Grey. It was great, light, and not nearly as sweet as I imagined. 

I also tried the jasmine iced latte. Perfection  I love that nothing is overpowered by sweetness like most the boba places I have tried. Looks are usually deceiving-not here!

5996353,2017-05-16,0,oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w,Came here with my roommates because we were down the street and saw some yelp reviews saying that it was a great place to go to. The ambience was nice when you walk in and they have comfy looking couches and a cool table set in front of the door. We asked the cashier what he recommended and he kinda laughed and asked us what we meant by that. So we rephrased our question which I thought was very straight forward and very strange for someone to answer a question back with another question. He suggested the raindrop cake because he said the flavor tasted like strawberries and the golden lychee for a drink because that's how favorite and it also had great lychee flavor to it. So we took his suggestions and ordered them both. We were disappointed in his suggestions because both were not up to par with what he said. The rainbow cake was tasteless and although when you got to the strawberry it did taste like strawberry that was the only flavor in this cake but you'd expect the strawberry fruit to taste like strawberry right? Anyway the golden lychee had a green tea flavor but barely any lychee flavor to it. Not sure if we'd come in to try this place again as the service was okay and the items that were suggested to us came out disappointing.,P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,3,UxoarJfMdjDORfAODbFByg
