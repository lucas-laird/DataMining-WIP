1290738,2016-07-31,0,iu-KRfucMNM1j9-EstPGXg,"Horrific customer service.  When you sit in a car hop space or idle in the drive thru line you can often observe 4-5-6 workers congregated near the register chit-chatting, drinking, watching, texting and hanging out... not actively engaged in food or order prep... it can be very frustrating.  This is one of the slowest drive-thrus I have ever been in (consistently) and it often prompts us to pull in to a space and order via the drive-up screen.  Tonight, we pulled into a space, facing the building and watched as the employees were hanging out, talking drinking their drinks, texting and not being the least bit productive or service oriented.  EVEN if half of them were waiting on food to be readied for delivery, not one of them could break free to deliver an order that was ONLY a drink?

THEN... to make matters worse, they delivered the wrong drink.  This is not the first time, sadly.  I had my hands full, so, until I got home and unloaded the vehicle, did I decide to take a sip.  We were given SWEEEEET TEA, when we repeatedly said... REGULAR TEA, UNSWEETENED TEA, NO SUGAR, and were then called upon to acknowledge the order on the screen.  Additionally, the order receipt specifies UNSWEETENED TEA.

I called the Manager, Robert... and don't have the least bit of confidence that he was really engaged in the call.  He even challenged me to get the receipt to verify that I had told the truth, that the order was for UNSWEETENED TEA (CHK 451).  I had already told him we were home, in our jammies and were parked in the last available space, unable to return to correct SONIC'S error and pick up another order that they will continue to go back and forth with, over and over, do I want SWEET or UNSWEETENED... regular or ICED TEA or what.  EVERY single time we come there we specify that we want it regular, unsweetened and no sugar and again get asked the same series of questions that are routinely disregarded.  Some nights the drive through wait is well over 20 minutes for only a few cars.  During this time we see 4, 5, or 6 kids in the front area, hanging out.

~HUGE FAIL~  This happens when ordering a drink or meals and drinks.  The propensity of employees to question, re-question and not listen when asking the question or prompting for the order is not OK.  If you are taking an order, pay attention.  Your employees are NOT gifted at multi-tasking on any level.  What they end up doing is piss poor on all fronts.",ryxYbcfM79QYT8YA-oK1Aw,0,0,1,x0hCfA4hBahAT5KojlS2mA

Sonic Drive-Ins pride themselves on providing an enriching experience with every visit. I think they miss the bar at this location. 

The food and drinks are standard and came out as expected. I always try to make an effort to attend during happy hour and get a Route 44 strawberry limeade or lemon berry slush paired with a corn dog as a midday pick-me-up. 

The service was...interesting. I was greeted by an individual with cornrows who appeared to be bothered by the day. Maybe it's the heat, or the other customers, but she needed to wash her face because she got that dirty look on there and it definitely was not intended for me. Additionally, I'm gonna need these carhops to calm down. I almost hit one with my car as they zoomed by in the crosswalk. I hope they don't get hit.

You can get the Junior Candy Sundae size for $1, or a regular sized one. It is so good, but let it be known that the regular size is so filing it's like a meal just in itself.

This particular Sonic always has good service as well. Quick, accurate orders with friendly workers. Sonic also has happy hour EVERYday 2-4pm where drinks are half off.
