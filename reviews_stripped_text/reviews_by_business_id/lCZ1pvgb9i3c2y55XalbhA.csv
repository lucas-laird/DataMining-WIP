I ventured into this place as a semi regular to Las Vegas and discovered Soups.  I highly recommend this spot.
Chris (lil soup) the owner/operator is not only a gr8 go-to person in Vegas but makes a mean sandwich .. Again.. Get The Combo!",czXxNgj6ku1q8jW2Vv-lLg,0,0,5,UyJY562ogHtc6gmujaTt5A

The prices are very reasonable for the food you get plus the guys are really nice and helpful.,qyfKYxpz9VPmgs0ps6MFRA,0,0,5,28fBFhrRu900rRiW5q-KDQ

Nothing worse than bringing home 2 grease soaked puffs.... I gave 2 stars in hopes they serve a decent beef; I won't be back to try,ubM9XlhrDxsAg4WIOTnsXg,0,0,2,NMi7UzGx6M8CgZysRP4mzQ

Food looks good in the pics, but I couldn't tell you because I can't get any of it. Probably won't come back!!! 3 strikes your out!!!",tLDL9gv2NpjZ2e4Lq2MxFw,0,0,1,zN5mq7JB5AiXt_aJfamKgg
