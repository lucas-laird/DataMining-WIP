Foods not laying under a heatlamp like so many other Filipino places, e.g., San Fernando. Had the mani soup and it was enough to take home. Easily rivaled some pho places I've been too. If other Goldilocks were like this I wouldn't be as adverse to Filipino fast food. Perhaps the other places lowered expectations so much this place was fantastic. Judge for yourself. This one has given me pause for consideration for the future, instead of automatic No. Good job",aiitW137STn9ORfgu4hBjg,0,0,4,2OeOsRlGxmc2mWWnS9fj_g

There were cockroaches all over the place and the customer service was EPIC FAIL!?  Them people that works there don't know how to greet customers properly.  The lady at the buffet counter asked me ""Rice?"" in a rude tone, and she didn't even greet me then after like 2 seconds she went ahead and put 2 cups of rice on my plate without me saying anything to her.  Wtf was that all about?  This place seriously s*cks a**! I can't imagine how their kitchen would look like..  How the f do they pass their inspection every six months?!

My boyfriend is white so this was his first experience with a Filipino restaurant, and you know how first his impressions count, right? Oh God, I pity him now. He ordered the bbq chicken, and although it came out nicely browned and glazed on the outside, the inside was COLD and BLOOD RED. The kitchen couldn't even spare a second to check if it was done? Hello, salmonella? It wasn't even all that busy! My mom ordered the chicken adobo rice, which was actually very tasy - except it was served lukewarm. I ordered the palabok which, to my taste, was way too watery! I could've eaten that thing with a spoon!

I would've given them 1 star, but their bakery redeemed themselves. We bought a dozen cheese rolls and they were surprisingly delicious! Nothing wrong with them at all! I would say that they are in close competition with the cheese rolls from Portos in LA.. and that's saying a lot!",7xwZ0ePXneS47zaf1hNs0Q,1,0,2,wMAbrXwNPWfIXBu0RdG6XQ

I do like the bakery. They have good puto (my husband says, ""hey, watch your mouth"" LOL), Madeline's are good but consume them with a couple of day otherwise they'll get moldy. Sometimes they have this cheese filled danish, it melts in your mouth- very tasty.

The fried rice was good, I would order that again if we are ever caught hungry and in the area. I would also order the dinuguan again but that's because I always have to have that when we eat at a Filipino restaurant. I like the sauce all over my rice (no dinuguan meat for me) and since I refuse to learn how to cook this specific dish (I refuse to touch the blood, even though I deal with blood on a daily basis. Don't ask!), I always order this when the opportunity is there . 
Now for the bakery, this is the reason why I give them 4 stars, otherwise it would be 3. Their pandesal is soft and creamy and their sans rival is the best I've ever had. It's my son's favorite, I've tried other places and we always end coming back at Goldilocks for this once or twice a year treat. Also make sure to try their mocha roll, they are known for this cake!

Reading goldilock's story from last year, where they cleaned up their 50 demerits after being shut down only leaves me hopeful that you can make them clean up their act; better than what a disgruntled voice on Facebook would serve.

I used to love going to that one with my mom as a child.

This one was, I guess, a step up, but nothing like I remembered a Goldilocks to be.
An actual sit-down restaurant with ""cooked-to-order"" meals.

I would go here every now and then while attending classes at UNLV, and although I like some of the food here, it's just okay. 

What really put me off about this place is the service. Sure, they may come around for the initial greeting and order taking, but after that, it may be hard to find them... EVEN if you are one of the only people in there!

I've had a lot of the breakfast ""silogs"" there. I love them, but once, the waiter suggested we both get garlic fried rice with our breakfast plates and did not even warn us about the extra charge it would cost us! He acted as if it was a free upgrade. C'mon. You just cut some garlic up, throw it in some oil on a pan and swirl around the rice? That cost $1.50 extra, EACH plate. WTF? Oh well.

I've also had the crispy pata, and the pancit palabok. Not worth discussing. Decent at it's best.

Pricing wise, it's a little more than Filipino food actually costs, but it's a restaurant, so I'll excuse them. Still, they cost less than Salo Salo Grill.

I still love the baked goods, though. Pianomo rolls always are good and Buko Pandan is one of my favorite desserts hands down!

When we came in, we waited a very long time to be seated even though it wasn't busy. Our waiter tossed the two menus on the table and hurried away. We decided to order the crispy pata and fresh lumpia. Our order came out fast enough and we were disappointed at the size of the $13 crispy pata. It was extremely small and parts of it were over cooked. It was also extremely salty. The fresh lumpia was delicious but again very small for the price we paid. 

When we got the receipt, we were surprised to see that we were charged for the white rice. Every Filipino restaurant in New York gives a free order of rice per person. They charge when additional rice is ordered. I understand that this is not New York but for overpriced food, I would expect rice to come with it.

My mom paid for the lunch and as we were walking out, I offered to buy her cake or pastries from the bakery. Despite her love for Goldilocks ensaymada, she refused and told me that she didn't want me to spend a single penny there.

For those who need to satisfy their Filipino food cravings, do yourself a favor and go to Kusina ni Lorraine, Ortigas, or even Nanay Gloria's. Food is somewhat better at those places and much cheaper.",JddUKeXfP0lhsxrEkoCBPQ,0,0,1,GgGOUKbGADtqZhWpLRlkPw

4054672,2013-06-27,7,Z0kPVmXzo2rLEJwdothOWw,"2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #10

Our Halo-Halo Challenge stops at 10 locations, with Goldilocks as our last contender.  We decided early that Goldilocks would be last because they have been around for quite some time with 21 locations in the US, it was recommended by others, and we remember that their Halo-Halo was pretty good.  In other words, we wanted to save the best for last.  What we found was some inconsistencies to how I remember Goldilocks' Halo-Halo to be.  Cost for their Halo-Halo is $4.99. Ingredients included kaong, pinipig, nata de coco, macapuno, red beans, ube ice cream, lanka, condensed milk, and shave ice all mixed together.  Missing was real ube and flan.  Halo-Halo means ""Mix-Mix"" and that's what you do to eat this treat.  You start with this pretty dessert and you mix it.  But what I found at Goldilocks is that they tend to mix mix what they put in their Halo-Halo.  I've had Halo-Halo from Goldilocks from locations ranging from their Philippines, NorCal, SoCal, and now Vegas.  I swear flan and even legit ube was in their ""Mix-Mix"". I guess all locations are different, which left me disappointed when I didn't get what I wanted in their Halo-Halo. Overall, I still finished my Halo-Halo but would not consider theirs as my favorite.  Sorry Goldilocks, but you need flan and ube in your Halo-Halo to make me happy. 

Like some of the other Halo-Halo contenders, food was also taste tested.  I wanted their chicken BBQ on a stick because the pictures on the menu looked so delicious. But they were out and this wasn't the first time this happened to me.  I ended up with their half chicken BBQ with garlic fried rice.  Just a note, folks...rice is not included with their meals.  You have to order rice separate. So, don't assume you're getting it and they don't ask you either. My meal still hit the spot. My Halo-Halo was just okay, but at last their chicken BBQ was good.  

PS:  We committed to ending this challenge at 10 locations. We know there's more out there (ie, Nanay Gloria's, Red Ribbon, DT's, etc).  Maybe part 2 of this challenge is in the future, maybe not.  One things for sure, we're both ready to get back to eating clean and training mean.  This Halo-Halo Challenge was a great way for me to decompress from all that damn grilled chicken breast.

As for the food, I'm not fond of Filipino food at restaurants. And especially a chain restaurant. Everything is so bland and Americanized.

OK that was a labored analogy to the fairy tale. I've been to this restaurant twice and I've enjoyed it both times. The first time a few years ago, I had the classic Filo ""ToSiLog"" breakfast - tocino, sinangag (garlic fried rice) and itlog (egg). It's pretty hard to mess that up, so I remember it being pretty good.

Flash forward to yesterday, I went with a meetup group for their weekend breakfast buffet. It costs $7.99 for AYCE and soda/coffee/tea. That's a pretty good deal considering their breakfast items are actually good. I recently did Nanay Gloria's buffet during breakfast and I'd have to say Goldilocks is a notch better. For one thing, the eggs at Goldilocks are not cooked over hard and are still runny! For me, that's kind of a prerequisite for a ___SiLog type of breakfast. They have all the favorites too - daing, tocino, longanisa, corned beef hash, salted egg, chicken adobo, and of course over easy itlog and sinangag. I didn't try their champorado though.

One thing about their breakfast buffet. I guess they are normally a ""turo turo"" place i.e. you point at what you want and they add it to your plate. It's the same way for the breakfast buffet. It's just that you can get as much as you want and keep returning.

And return I will. It's quite a drive for me to just get breakfast, and I don't usually eat breakfast as it is, but so far it's the best Filo breakfast option I know about.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,2,0,4,rcAhwdxXSSSDmHArhjCWSA

This location is near North Vegas  by S Maryland.  Location is huge and have lots of fresh Pinoy staple foods.  You can dine in inside or take the food home and sit while you watch your TFC shows.  We got lunch here.  Ordered the sisig, beef soup, traditional palabok (noodle - highly recommended), and tilapia (whole fish).  We got a bowl of rice to pass around.  IT WAS AMAZINGLY FRESH AND CLEAN! My only complaint was that the Palabok was super soggy and salty.  I ate it anyway and moved on.  I ate in a lot of Pinoy spots in Vegas and I rather hold my reviews on them because I don't want to get ""bakbak"" with a slipper.  We wanted to clean our pallets after these delectable foods with some buko pandan for dessert.  This place is highly recommended and will definitely take you back when you were young.  I usually don't like Goldilocks but this place takes it up a notch.  All the staff here are nice and super friendly.  I highly recommend this for anyone from NV to visit.  LA peeps you guys got it good already.  I love reading the other reviews - it's just a matter of your taste.   I liked it and I eat like I am always hangry!

All she did was look at us and proceeded to do whatever she was doing behind the counter. The funny thing was that I could see our order in bags right behind her. Then another worker walked right up to the lady at the cashier behind the counter and started talking to her without even looking or acknowledging us. I stood there staring at both ladies until a guy finally came up to ask us ""Can I help you?"" I told him I'm waiting to pick up my order that's been behind both of them this whole entire time. I normally tip even for just picking up food from a restaurant but this time.. I was so angry that I didn't bother. The lady had the audacity to say in Tagalog that I didn't tip her.

We were excited to see a renovated restaurant, and a nice selection on the menu, but sadly --- the service fell short on all levels. 

Service: No one to greet us at the front of the house (everyone was busy by the bakery counter which was located on the other side of the restaurant). Half of the patrons dining, were either waiting for their food, looking around for service or had to flag someone down. There didn't appear to be a sense of urgency with the wait staff. We had to ask for menus, water. We ordered the sinigang jipon (shrimp), pancit lug lug, fresh lumpia and pinakbet. All arrived fresh and delectable (especially the sinigang), but the service was really lacking. No ""How is everything?"" ""Would your like dessert?"" It was a let down. 

We typically order baked goods to go, so siopao was top on our list. Counter help was a lot friendlier and accommodating (complete contrast from the restaurant).

5355571,2015-07-11,6,Z0kPVmXzo2rLEJwdothOWw,"Pinoy baked goods galore! Inside, Goldilocks doubles as a bakery and restaurant (half of the room is the bakery section, while the other half is the dining area) that offers traditional Filipino dishes and pastries. The aroma of freshly baked bread and Filipino cuisine envelopes you once you step in, which is pretty inviting.

In general, Filipino pastries tend to be sweet and filling so picking up a few things was enough to satisfy my midday sweet tooth. I feel like they didn't have a huge selection of goods to choose from, but the staples to any Filipino bakery are there including: ensaymada, mamon, cuchinta, etc. 

I ended up getting the baked cheese rolls and the ensaymada with ube (a brioche roll with a sweet, purple yam filling). The cheese rolls were the same texture as a traditional pan de sal roll (with fine bread crumbs lightly sprinkled on top), but this baked good was sweeter in flavor. The ensaymada with ube had the sweet, yet buttery taste.

One thing I like about these specific pastries is the fact that the cheese incorporated in them compliments the sweetness; it doesn't have an overbearing ""cheesy"" taste -- it's more subtle and may be unnoticed because of the pastry's sweetness.

I was pretty satisfied with the goods that I bought because they were soft and filling. It's what I expect out of a perfectly baked Filipino pastry.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,10,8,4,1Bw83FoQz19FpXGlMXFumg
