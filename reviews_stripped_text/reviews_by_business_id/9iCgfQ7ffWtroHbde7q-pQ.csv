Dee seemed nice but at the same time it seemed painful.  Our food was fine.  What bothered me was when my kids needed to go to the restroom...So we left the table.  Plates were still full.  Got back to the table to find that it was cleared out.  No apologies.  Dee didn't even bother to find a solution...She didn't even talk to me.  I went to pay thinking about everyone needs a paycheck.  Anyway, I asked for the free kid's discount. The cashier/hostess couldn't figure it out.  She went to Dee and I could hear Dee yelling at the hostess that she didn't want to give it to me.  After awhile, the hostess just walked away from Dee and she figured it out on the register on her own.  I don't know why I didn't complain or even paid and even tipped double tax.  I was having a bad day and it just didn't cross my mind how bad the whole experience was until I got home.  Never going to this location ever.

I also observed that tables had not been bussed and the overall appearance was dirty. We turned and left as well as the couple that walked in behind us.

I was in a large group of about 25 people. And I get it, it takes a while to serve that many people. But despite being the only group in the restaurant, it took about 20 minutes for anyone to even ask what we wanted to drink. And to actually get the drinks took even longer, and I had to get up and ask the waitress for my water. After another 20 minutes they came to take our food order. My friend ordered a half stack of chocolate chip pancakes and the waiter said he couldn't order those, giving no explanation what so ever. According to some friends at another table, she asked ""really?"" In a disbelieving voice when she ordered a burger. As she went around our table of about 7 people, she completely skipped over my sister. She never ordered food because she was too shy to call attention to it. At the table next to ours, they had to wait for their food for so long that they went up to the kitchen to see what was going on, and they found that there food had been sitting on the counter and was now cold. Not a single table ever had their checks given to them, we all had to, again, walk to the main area to get it, despite requesting the waiter bring it to us and being told she would. 

The food was fine, but the service came no where near being worth the 18% large group gratuity that was put on the bill. It was one of those situations that I'd rate the place 0 stars if I could.",Ljks5S1zKuZZP7HazfqNiA,1,0,1,m7SnUrbRzqq8cUw5fa_h3Q

I ended up ordering the steak tips with onions & mushrooms with of course a side of German crepes & my man ordered a t bone steak with eggs, hash browns & pancakes. When our food came we requested ketchup & steak sauce. This is where everything went downhill. With our food in front of us we were told they are out of all steak sauces. After a shitty day at work you might as well tell me that you're also out of bacon or crepes! 
We didn't want these steaks without sauce, we all know IHOP cuts need sauce! So without the waiter caring we ate everything but the meat & took it home to stop at the grocery store to buy some A1 since of course we didn't have anything at home. I ended up heating our shit up & that summed up the night. 
Dear IHOP waiters, tell your guests there's no steak sauce if they order a steak at your place! Please...
We would have changed our orders had we known & I can't imagine a good reason to not have steak sauce, how about a manager make a trip to SAMs or Costco?!?!?!?",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,4,4,1,WD8vHBC9mNAI_FERyFtu_A

Which i've ordered on several occasions at another location and loved it. Tonight though they forgot to add all the toppings

It literally came with burnt chorizo and peppers on top. The forgot to add the salsa, the sour cream, and the grilled pepper on the side. It looked nothing like the omelettes i've ordered in the post or the picture on the menu. 

I tired to flag down the waiter but was ignored. I got up to grab my own menu to compare the thing on my plate with the item I ordered. I finally got the waiters attention and pointed the picture out to him. He assured me that it was what I ordered. I pointed out that the salsa and sour cream where not present along with the grilled pepper (which I wouldnt have eaten anyway). He tried to claim that the salsa was absorbed into the omelette. And that they just forgot the sour cream and pepper. I had to argue with him before he went to the kitchen to get me ""more"" salsa. 

A bit later I asked for more napkins which he never brought.

For those of you not in the industry, this is a HUGE thing you need to know.) I told the manager that it looked like the table was dirty and the ketchup was a clear sign it needed to be wiped, and he said different establishments do different things and they always leave the ketchup and Tabasco there on the table. Well that's interesting, because as he said that a busser came up behind him with a sanitizer towel and wiped that table without me asking. (She had obviously just cleared the table and was about to wipe it to make it 100% clean.) She also TOOK THE KETCUP AND TABASCO, so the manager straight up lied about them supposed to be on the table. Then, it took 15 mins for orange juice and the table next to us sat down 10 minutes after us in a different section, and got their food 10 minutes before us.

Call in our order. Come 20 mins later and it's completely wrong. They say they need to re make all four meals. Wait there sitting another 15 mins.

She apologizes and says do I want to wait another 15 mins? No! So I become annoyed and say I will take whatever is there. Luckily the waitress takes a meal off because she says she feels bad the cashier messed it up twice.

It's gonna be busy on the weekend around brunch time-try to be patient if you are going to any restaurant at peak time. It's not a fine dining establishment so I don't expect 'ambience' just cleanliness & every time I've been here it's been spotless. 

Just picked up to go order. No mistakes. Extra syrup for our syrup sponges (pancakes). Everything cooked perfectly-scrambled, over easy & sunny side up. 

Staff was friendly courteous. 

The only time I didn't like the food was when I ordered chicken n waffles but that was me-my son scarfed them down & ordered another one-manager comped the 1st one (totally unnecessary as my kid loved it but the waitress noticed I didn't like it) & I ordered something else.

With everything else...... shouldn't expect that much but if it takes us three tries and two different servers to be able to ask for anything like a bottle ketchup or hot sauce, we'll probably be done with our meal by the time we get any of our other requests. In addition, our server seemed to really hate us by the way she talked to us or she wasn't having the best of days. But either way, we apologize if we caused her any inconvenience!

Actually wish I could do half ratings as I would give this IHOP a 2 1/2.
For kids I give it a 4. They do great kids specials like smiley faced pancakes, fruit, etc.
For adults, well the food is mediocre at best.  I guess it is the whole national chain thing but the choices aren't as varied as other breakfast restaurants, the flavor is lacking, the presentation mediocre and the restaurant is not the cleanest.  It is edible. The hash browns are actually pretty well prepared but the omelet i have had the last two times just wasn't good. I have had better omelets in buffets at the Omelet station.

Still, if you want an inexpensive breakfast that will satisfy your hunger if not your thirst for flavor, this is a good place.  The benefit of a chain is you know what you are getting no matter the location.  The drawback, well creativity and flavor.

Still, my daughter likes it and it is walking distance from my house so it stays in the rotation.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,2,1,3,S5X_28BOWF_AmwH4sXzMLQ
