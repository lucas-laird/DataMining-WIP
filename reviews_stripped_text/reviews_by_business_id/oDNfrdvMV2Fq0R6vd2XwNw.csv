The staff is very courteous and extremely knowledgeable about their menu.  Our server was Eric and he was outstanding!

We had the a few of the rolls (which were delicious) and last but not least, the sundae for desert.  The chocolate sauce they provide with the sundae is ridiculously good (wish we could have had another bowlful).  It was a perfect end to our meal.

Drinks: had the Asian Pear and Rasberry Mojito - both very good

Our waiter recommended we order a bunch of dishes and he brought them out in a staggered fashion.  Crispy Rice with tuna was awesome as were the dragon roll and baked lobster roll with cream sauce.

Of the entrees I thought the lamb chops and Miso black cod were fantastic!

Since we came with a group we all shared a giant dessert platter which we devoured.  The creme brulee, cheesecake which was wrapped in white chocolate and topped with fresh berries, and lava cake were all amazing.

Will definitely come back!  This is a great place on the strip to come pre-show, pre-clubbing, and they do well accommodating large groups.  There was a bacherolette party next to us that also looked like they were having an awesome time!

Food was fine, the usual american Japanese fusion fare.  Unfortunately nothing particularly stuck out for me.  It wasn't cheap but it wasn't quite as expensive as Nobu.  

Yeah I think I'm writing this review because I'm quite bitter that we didn't end up going to Nobu. 

The bouncer tried to get us to stay after for the lounge/club but the crowd didn't look that fun and they tried to charge us $20 for open bar.  I assume it's a good deal but we weren't used to paying for cover for anything in Vegas and headed over to Marquee instead.

The ""Rockin Cucumber"" drink is perfectly balanced. Not too sweet, the sake brings a change to the normal vodka cocktail. Highly recommended.
The service was unwavering. We never had a dirty table, and never wanted for refills on water or drinks.
The food was outstanding. The rolls are slightly over priced - but we're from CA and used to great sushi at low prices. We're spoiled in that regard.

150058,2011-02-24,1,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"This review is for the nightclub.

My friends and I picked up a bunch of tickets for NYE 2011. When we first got there, there was already a problem with getting inside. We were early. It seems that they were missing the arm bands. I think we waited about 30 minutes before they found the person that ran off with them.

When we got inside we found that the main bar was packed. It took sometime to get drinks. But hey, drinks were free because of the package deal. After walking around we found out that there were multiple bars. No one really knew that there were bars in the other parts of the club. The bartenders were very cool. We chatted up a couple of them while grabbing drinks.

The restrooms, well what can I say about them. Not enough stalls for this venue. The lines were so long that I ran down stairs to use the casino restrooms on the other side of the building. When I got there, there was another huge line. At that point I wasn't sure if I was better off staying in the club or not.

Upon leaving the club after having a good time despite all of the pit falls, I encountered another problem with coat check. I don't know what happened but this is where the night went to hell. The staff was calling out random numbers looking for people to pick up their coats instead of properly taking each person as they come. There was a line. Not sure for what, but there was one.

After watching the employees calling random numbers, letting people cut the line and saying it was okay. A bunch of us started voicing our opinions. They told us that to move outside and form another line.  Everyone packed outside the door waiting. Not even five minutes went by before another line formed inside and they just gave us the, I don't know, shrug for everyone outside. Seriously what is going on here.

Well after a bunch of back and forth, hollering and asking to talk to somebody in charge, we finally got our coats. I wasted an hour and twenty minutes of my life. Seriously, I am never coming back to this place. It felt like this was the largest group they've ever had. They just couldn't handle it. There were so many people working the door but nothing got done right. Sorry guys, if you get it together I am sure this place will do well.",S34S-X4Y-XTp6d0dnvrCsQ,1,1,1,KIPpYkwYBLKyOsTJRKbBSg
179631,2010-03-17,0,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"If it's possible, Koi should receive zero star for their rating.  The reason the BF and I along with the friends came here was because Planet Hollywood gave us a dinner credit here for being hotel guests.

The ambiance was nice for being Vegas and the service wasn't too shabby, but the food was seriously lacking for the amount we spent.  The 6 of us spent over $100 each including the dinner credit we received.  If i knew the less than yummy meal would cost this much, I would have gotten the spa credit instead.

We ordered the kobe beef roll and it was quite disappointing.  I don't think it was real kobe or wagu beef at all.  It wasn't tender and didn't have the melt in your mouth effect.  Their special crispy tuna was not crispy at all.  Sweet shrimp was more like baby sweet shrimp.  It's half the size of what we can get back home and at least 3 times cheaper.  They don't prepare the heads fried either.  Not to mention the $12 for 3 little cubes of adashi tofu.  The ice cubes in my ice water were bigger than the size of the tofu.  The rainbow roll was just like home if you go to any Korean owned Japanese sushi places but again 3 times more expensive at Koi.  They are very skimpy on the uni and small portions.  As a matter affect, everything here is tiny little portions designed for babies that cost at least $30 a pop.

By all means, if you have the money to blow, then I guess you can come eat here but the food isn't orgasmic.",bJ7BUQoUiC7vgOICe_49-g,2,0,1,rGLUfRIURpPavbiKdxha7A
218989,2011-02-20,2,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"Ok, so this review is for the restaurant, and specifically refers to my experience with a semi-large party (8 people), so i guess take it with a grain of salt if you are only going with one or two other people.
      We were seated promptly and greeted by our waitress, Robin, who took our drink orders and quickly rattled of the specials. I'm not sure how special these dishes actually are though, as Robin had every dish and all it's ingredients memorized, and boredly pushed through the list of dished forcefully without pausing for breath- or any questions. Upon being ask for my order, i told the waitress that i wanted the Seared Tuna with Jalapeno and Garlic Chips (listed under ""Koi Signature dishes""), which she promptly and condescendingly told me was an appetizer. A bit taken aback, i asked her to go around the table for everyone else's order before coming back to me. After debating my options for a minute, my sister convinced me to just get it because appetizer portions are usually somewhat larger and we could share it(- plus, who gives a shit what the waitress thinks). I looked up and the waitress was nowhere to be seen...she returned ten minutes later, only after my sister flagged her down and pointed out that she forgot to take my order before prancing off. Finally having wrangled her, i asked what the portion size was for the Seared Tuna and made a point of saying that i was going to split it as my main course. She hummed and hawed, but was not very specific or attentive to what i was asking: She basically said ""yeah, fine"", wrote the order down and left. 
      Waiting around for the food, i enjoyed the atmosphere and music. The place is really nice and very classy. glancing around, I look toward the sushi bar and notice a waitress trying to unplug a bottle of Sriracha and squirt it onto a plate. Now, i love me some Sriracha but i would not say that it is an especially gourmet chili sauce, and found it somewhat disheartening to witness it being squirted all over a dish they charge $30 for. In retrospect i think this scene basically sums up my experience and Koi LV. 
      The food arrives, and Robin the waitress hands me my plate- It is sparingly covered by 5 or 6 tiny thin pieces of tuna, each with one chunk of raw jalapeno and a few flakes of what was apparently dried garlic. To recap: The dish i ordered was called Seared Tuna with Jalapeno and Garlic Chips. Having ordered seared tuna in several restaurants before, and being a regular sushi eater, i was expecting sashimi-sized chunks of fish with a good sear on each side. These pieces of fish were basically 1x2 inch slices of deli meat style tuna...it was so thin it was see through. As a result, the fish did not retain any kind of sear or the typically steak-y taste and texture of traditionally seared tuna. The fish itself was of mediocre quality and the only dominant flavor in the dish was the jalapeno, which would have been more successful had it been diced and evenly distributed on the fish rather than in a chunk right in the middle. Furthermore, the exceedingly small portion was not large enough for one person to eat as a meal, let alone for two people to share like we asked, and certainly not worth the $16+ we were charged for it...I. was. pissed. - and apparently it was written on my face because the waitress hurriedly asked if i needed something, to which i replied that i felt extremely misled by the information she gave us about the dish.   She tried to argue that all sashimi came in ultra-thin deli slices like that(!), but i was not having it. She then tried to push me to order something else until i told her that i did not intend to spend any more money for shitty service and tiny amounts of mediocre food. 
      At this point i think i should mention that with parties of 8 or more they charge a 19% gratuity fee. I feel this is extremely relevant to my experience, and the experience of the other people in my party because it was very much one of those cases where, knowing that the gratuity fee is there, the person waiting on you does a totally lame job because they don't have to work for their tip. Very uncool. We all agreed that our server was pushy, condescending, and basically did a half assed job the entire time...and she still left with a $90 tip- wtf
      I should also point out that my dish was not the only one that was determined by my party to be of inadequate portion size and quality-especially in relation to the price we were paying for it. 
      Also, several people said they thought it was weird that they used crappy wasabi paste rather than the real/good stuff. 
      Of the things i tried and liked, I'd recommend the Creamy rock shrimp tempura, Tiger roll, Chicken Yakitori, and Tempura Shrimp Roll- All of which were of good or exceptional quality and portion size. 

Final thoughts: Head to Koi if you love lame sushi and hate your money.",9ZB3LZN8byQ21TKaswBa5w,0,0,2,wzIQjwctcIJEK18Jm4ylXw

My friend finally arrived late as always after the beauties had left and we had the Chilean Sea Bass, soft shell crab, Ca roll with baked scallop, and a dragon roll.

The Bass was good.  the crab tasted the same as every other place i've been.  The CA roll was weird looking but tasted real good it had a large piece of baked scallop on top. the dragon roll had all these flakes on it-tons of it as a matter of fact.

The entrance to the restaurant had 3 buddhas in the formation of the hear no evil, speak no evil and see no evil which was kinda funny until you realize its Buddha.  Is that bad luck to do that to Buddha?

The girl showing me to my table was chatty and nice, the waitress took my drink order within a minute of sitting down and as I had already checked the menu before coming here I was ready to order when she returned with my drink. Food came promptly and my water was refilled whenever needed. My waitress stopped by now and then to check that everything was OK and to see if I needed something else.

But the food... Well. While OK I would not consider it on par with the price-tag.

Especially not the sashimi. The slices were so thin that I could almost see through them and they fell apart when I lifted them off the tray. That is not how sashimi should be! It should be about a quarter of an inch thick and firm enough that you can lift it by a corner without the piece falling apart! The quality of the fish was OK but not great.

The main course (I had the Togarashi Crusted Salmon) was good, the spices well balanced and the fish cooked right. But for $25 I believe I can find better fish in this town...

On top of this the music was just too loud for this type of setting. I was there early in the evening (8pm) and the music was cranked up to ""dance and shut up"" volume. Not a pleasant experience.",AefaF4-vF5l2EB_-9i4wow,0,0,3,IFe_rB2u9vcOLDU-7PYQxA

Beware that the hostess sends you to the bar to get a drink before they take you to the table or bar...even if there are seats...probably want you to buy a drink first.

Tuna is already cut when you sit down...not the most fresh place to get fish. The sushi chefs can't be called sushi chefs...they don't know what japanese words mean. He didn't even know if they served hot tea...no hot tea in a japanese restaurant...yikes.

I brought my mom and although the sushi was a bit disappointing, the overall experience made up for it.  Although, if you bring seniors..make sure it's before 10pm.  Otherwise, they start playing really loud hip hop music and it's hard to hear across the table.

1) Service: Impeccable, and had one guy take the order, one guy delivering the drinks, and another delivering the food.  It wasn't busy yet so perhaps they were working the tip angle.  

2) Seating: If possible, try to use opentable (not only can you score points, but you can request the window area to sit with at least a view).  The inside area was more bamboo like but the tables seemed quite close to each other so I was glad to sit near the window.  The sofas were quite comfy but a bit too deep (had to stuff 2 pillows behind me so that I could sit up straight).  You can however practically take a nap on those sofas but definitely different feel.  The inside area reminds me of the KOI location in los angeles.

3) Food:  Down to the nitty gritty the sushi wasn't all bad but the portion size of typical sushi restaurants were definitely small.  We ordered the seared kobi on top of the roll and what we got was uncooked beef.  We had to send back the order for the meat to be cooked all the way through.  I guess I'm not the pro sushi eater however I do like my meat cooked.  We ordered another different kobi dish but it was just strips of kobe beef with some sauce and mushrooms.  All I had to ask was WHERE WERE THE MUSHROOMS?  Perhaps they were shredded but the restaurant was too dark to really notice anyways.  There went another $22 bucks...haha.  The dessert was really good.  I ordered the creme brulee which had a vanilla like taste to it and it wasn't too sweet inside nor on top (burnt crust) which was nice.  We ordered the eel and avocado but there was another roll that was similar but more expensive.  So make sure you know the specifics of the names of the rolls so you don't end up ordering two of the same thing.

I would go back for the ambiance if there weren't other sushi places to go to, but will venture out to others on my next trip to vegas.",wd_VNRXXGyoEUs-bMW5pGA,0,0,3,iaMtPpHZ5C9BcAbf8qbwnA

578407,2016-11-05,0,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"Pretty decent Japanese inspired cuisine with a Hollywood decor flare. Situated on the mezzanine level of Planet Hollywood (PH) next to Strip House (steak restaurant) and Brittney Spears' main theater, Koi is essentially at the top of the upscale eatery options at PH.  The restaurant opens for dinner (and dinner only) around 5:30pm and closes around 10:30pm to then transform into the Koi nightclub portion - I believe this is PH's main nighclub hotspot too.  Downstairs on the main casino floor you'll find employee's handing out wristbands for the nightclub.  Typically it's a $20 deal for entry along with drink deals (different or men vs. women), and pretty sure it's well drinks only that are offered with these deals.  The club area is at the front of the restaurant, and isn't very big compared to most of the larger venues like, Bank, Light, Hyde, Marquee, Tao, LAX, and many others.  In the club you'll find a single, decently large bar area, plenty of bench-style seating (although this will all be reserved for bottle service on busy nights), and Top 40 dance music playing at the standard nightclub (moderately loud) level.  The restaurant area is farther back past the club, and is much larger, and amenable to a greater number of patrons.  Koi's director of entertainment, Patrick, tells me that the restaurant area is sometimes opened up to be an extension of the club, provided the event is substantial (like New Years Eve for example).  One thing I do like is that there is an on-site restroom located near the front which is nice as some resort venues make you leave the restaurant to use the main casino facilities which can be a little awkward and time consuming.

I dined at the Sushi Bar, and my chef, Bui, was a terrific host who was very knowledgeable in the seafood arena.  After an edamame appetizer, two drinks, two sushi rolls, and a dessert, the bill was $81 (throw in the tip and I dropped an even $100).  There's not much of an outdoor view from inside the restaurant unless your sitting in the Fountain Room, which is at the back most portion of the restaurant.  There you'll find a good view of the Strip from their floor-to-ceiling windows.  They also have a decent sized outdoor terrace you can walk outside to for a terrific view of City Center and part of Bellagio and the fountains.  There's also a small indoor terrace next to the club portion that overlooks the main casino floor.

Overall, I recommend this venue for an upscale, dressy dinner/drinks outing.  Didn't stay for the nightclub portion, but wasn't happy with the size of the club portion.  If they opened up the whole restaurant (including the Fountain Room) then there'd be some room to roam around.",kZMh29fOAKBegqAEorwVlw,0,0,4,G1wVqbR4ElHNUnVPETN6bQ

cucumber sunomono - very tasty pickled cucumber salad (and pretty!)

hamachi fusion - the soy-citrus was a nice touch to sashimi
miso bronzed black cod - no crispy skin, but the flavor was awesome and the fish was nice and moist
grilled skirt steak with crispy onions and sesame sauce - nice and tender and the sauce was great
molten chocolate cake - gotta love chocolate desserts :)

The portion sizes were actually pretty good for a fancy restaurant (I can't comment on the sushi since I didn't have any, but why go to a place that seems to specialize in Japanese fusion for standard rolls that you could probably get elsewhere for much cheaper?).

By far the worst club I have ever been to. Not only do they lie about how much cover is.. but there was only one bar on Halloween night (the Saturday actually).. ONE BAR and the ""dance floor"" was no more than 200sqft no joke! 

- They charge you whatever they want to charge you.. my guy friends paid $30 to get in when they said while giving out the wristbands that they would be $10/$20 (got two different quotes--should have known something was up). They gave them some BS saying it was a holiday weekend. I later find out that the guys behind my friends paid $20.

We had been chatted up by two different Koi promoters who promised free drinks and no cover.  GF had a green wristband.  Made no difference.

We broke one of our cardinal Vegas rules: hot chicks never pay cover. Yes, we caved and paid $10 each to get inside Koi.  They cut off her green wristband and charged us the same price each. Nice buddha theme with comfy couches once inside, but just an average dj and a tiny dance floor.

The cool thing about Koi is that it has a balcony that looks down on the casino floor right at a major pedestrian intersection of escalators, pole dancers, and card tables.  The uncool thing about Koi is that the bartenders don't know how to make classic drinks. An Old Fashioned? Not a chance.  Free drinks for chicks? Not exactly. The booze is free but they wanted to charge us for the Red Bulls.

We were bored within 5 minutes so we ditched ph for the view at Level 107 on top of the Stratosphere.

I could go back to Koi, but really...it's not got much working for it.  People-watch the casino floor?  OK, but how long would that entertain me?",qCZu-TpQ-VqhjK9BUtqtkQ,3,0,2,6qMMUkcUwg2xkcJKhHjEwA

994912,2008-04-10,0,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"Koi Las Vegas has some major hype going on around it!  Kim Kardashian, Kevin Spacey, David Spade......if you flip on the Extra channel in the new Planet Hollywood Hotel, it seems like all the celebrities have something nice to say about Koi.  The original Koi is in Los Angeles, and frequently gets celebrities hopping in and out of that restaurant.  

Food-wise, this place is no match for Matsuhisa in Los Angeles, but it is a nice place to have dinner if you're on the Strip.  Koi Las Vegas is on the Mezzanine level in the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino.  Three jolly buddhas are positioned in front of the restaurant, and then you walk around the circular lounge, and into the dimly lit restaurant flanked by modern grey/green booths and glossy brown tables. It's very dark in the restaurant, with just the sushi/sashimi chefs lit up under recessed lighting near the sushi bar.   Lots of businessmen at this restaurant....those darn companies pick up the pricey tab when dinner is all over.  Wish I could have a company expense!  Some people were there for dates.  The dress code is dressy casual, but they will let you in if you look semi-decent (ie no flip flops or T-shirts, but everything else, they'll let you in.)

Like many other fusion Japanese restaurants, Koi Las Vegas has a signature crispy rice spicy tuna appetizer.  4 pieces of spicy tuna with a hint of jalepeno slice, over a crunchy, chewy fried piece of rice.  Expensive, yes, at $15 for only four pieces, but it was pretty good.  The crunchy, chewy rice was warm and complemented the cold spicy tuna on top.  The slice of jalepeno gave the dish a nice kick in the end.  Lots of customers were getting this dish!

The salmon carpaccio with black truffle was not bad, but I think I""ve had better.  The salmon was ultra thin, and I expected the carpaccio to be chunks of salmon together in a black truffle oil sauce, but to me, this dish was underwhelming.  The truffle was chopped up and placed on the salmon slices, and it was okay.  I think this dish could be better if there was more originality to the presentation.  For the price, this dish could have been better.

The miso crusted black cod was delicious, and they gave a hearty portion to the dish.  It was laced with some baby carrots, and some asparagus on the side.  The cod was light, flaky and the miso sauce had just the right amount of flavor to compliment the dish.  If you come to Koi, get this dish, because you'll be happy with your choice.  Light, yet flavorful, this dish is appealing to all seafood lovers.  Original, no---because you can find this dish at just about any other Asian fusion restaurant out there, and it tastes just as good at any other restaurant (ie think Roy's).  

The chilean sea bass was very very light, as it was steamed with ginger and scallion.  It is placed on a bed of shitake mushrooms and you can really enjoy the flavor of the sea bass.  Very fresh.  

For dessert, do not get the molten chocolate cake, because it is nothing like Roy's, and you do not get the hot, lava flowing chocolate from the inside of the cake.  

I only gave Koi Las Vegas 3 stars because it is not a stand out restaurant, and the dishes were not spectacular like at other places.  At Roy's, there's more originality, and you feel like you're getting a good deal for the price you pay.  Here at Koi, they rely a bit too much on the celebrity hype, so the food suffers.  The place is nothing like the Los Angeles Koi---it's not cozy, and you can't really appreciate the decor since it so dark inside.  There's a small view of the Las Vegas Strip, but most tables don't have a view because only a small portion of the tables are facing that direction.

Proof positive that it ISN""T just Location! Location! Location! 
While Koi has an excellent home at the heart of the strip...
 The ambiance is dark, the management are non-existent, and the food is sub par and completely overpriced. The only saving grace was that the drinks were strong and the staff were all to eager to give away cocktails for free as compensation for their ineptitude and/ or indifference. For such an empty restaurant, one might expect reasonable service and fresh food. However, our oysters smelled rancid and steaks were unrested with blood mixing into the sauce all over our plates. Eeeeewwwwww! 
  Our server was inattentive and our attempts to have our issues addressed by the arrogant asian manager walking around casually were abandoned when someone from our party finally caught a glimpse of him, sitting by himself at a table in the dining room and staring at his iphone for no less than 15 minutes. Pathetic! While we stared at inedible food he never made it over to ours or anyone else's table to check on their experience... At least we all got a good laugh, after our free drinks, at how little anyone really seemed to care that we were there to exchange our hard earned money for a meal... what a unique concept-
  Ultimately we wrote the experience off as a total loss and won't be back to Koi any time soon. Hopefully they get their S#@! together and remember they are in the service industry. Times are tough and you aren't exactly exceeding anyones expectations. I've never been in a more underperforming and empty restaurant on the strip.

Our table at Koi was fabulous, overlooking the Bellagio fountains across the street through awesome floor to ceiling windows.  The booth was more like a plush sofa and comfortably sat the six of us.  The ambiance was beautiful, low lighting and cozy booths and candlelit tables.

Andy was our server and was extremely pleasant and helpful.  He gave honest and good advice on cocktails and also provided guidance on how to choose our food options.

The rolls were good too, the koi crispy rice was very flavorful though I wish thee was less rice and more spicy tuna.

Went to see Holly's Peep Show. Very nice, especially act 2 and the view from behind of Holly's BEHIND!

Koi Club-
Got wristbands from ""promoters"" telling us that women are free with the wristband and I would pay but free drinks all night. 

We got there and it ended up being 20 bucks cover for anyone and only women's drinks were free

The dance floor, seating area and bar area are about as big as my apartment. I actually might have a better VIP area. LOL -
Way too many people for the amount of room. There were girls there with flipflops and t-shirts. Guys with running shoes and polo's. From the facade in front you can be led to believe this is an upscale place. It's more like a local bar with a decent DJ in a pretty box. 

Took the girls 15 mins to get drinks, then I had to go over to the other side of their small bar to clash with the restroom go-ers to get my 8-dollar beer. 

Go somewhere else. Maybe BANK or TRYST",01-MTtekKccIHp0YgL-phg,0,1,1,DryNEAYWf2i6mW-e_F19EA

This place is awesome!  The pricing, menu, and service were all top notch.  I tried the kobe surf & turf rolls and garlic mash for my meal...both were solid.  I also had their strawberry cobbler for dessert and that was quite tasty too.  Was it the best sushi in history - no.  But when I take into account the total experience while at Koi, put it this way:  when I visit Vegas again I'll go back to Koi.  And the only place where I can ever make that emphatic of a statement in Vegas is a casino.  If I had to give it a small dig, I would say it was a lil too dark inside.  But that's minor; as I come for the food and good service.  

By the way - all of the negative reviews you see (of the 1 to 2 star variety) are for the lounge/club that opens up later in the evening.  I have no insight into how that works.",1UxdunUt1RiRiuSEfLm5FQ,1,0,5,pzOqWNIl3pnmmfkuZJui0w

The food is expensive with small portions. The sushi rolls were okay, had to order a lot just to feel semi full. The only thing that was good was the lobster roll and the sparkling sake that our waiter suggested we try.

My fiancé and I ordered the seared albacore, the dragon roll, seafood tempura, and a raspberry maple for me. We paid 70 dollars (because of the added 18% gratuity for our large party) and I really feel like we wasted our money. 

The dragon roll only had 6 pieces, and the seared albacore I would say only had about 5-6 slices. We left hungry because somehow our waiter forgot our seafood tempura order. All of my friends ordered 1-2 rolls, ranging from 9-20 dollars apiece. My mom split some creamy shrimp and a roll with my sister, and ordered a coke and she somehow ended up paying 60 bucks. A part of me feels like it's wrong to pay over 50 dollars for two people and leave hungry. 

I think what you pay for here is the atmosphere. There is no doubt that the restaurant is beautiful. The quality of the sushi was mediocre at best; the food was neither memorable nor mind blowing. What made me the most angry about this meal was that my mom had driven 4 hours to see me for dinner and drove back home after spending 60 dollars on one roll and one appetizer and left hungry. On the plus side, I did get a free mochi dessert for my birthday.

This place might be where you want to be for a casual drink, and I know they offer open bar late night (20 for ladies, 30 for men), but I will never recommend this restaurant for food service. I wish I could get my money back.",rERej75WS6S-Tftnan3I5Q,1,0,2,QSCvNNwMp4usMPziLAUPcw

After doing some checking on Koi and heeding Avril's recommendation (I guess you can call it a recomendation? lol), I ordered the Kobe beef and an order of edamame and a spicy tuna roll. 

The kobe beef is pretty outstanding. You really have to take your time eating it and savor every bite. The kobe beef is a little on the pricey side -- $55 for cutlets -- but it will rock your socks off. 

Server was absolutely fantastic and, upon finding out it was my birthday, added some complimentary sake and mochi dessert :-)

Koi is a beautiful space in a beautiful casino.  I love the atmosphere and the way they decorated the interior.  It was lush, luxurious, understated and made me feel like a million bucks.  As big as it is, you still feel really cozy tucked away in your booth.  They did a great job in designing the seating.

The Ginger Kiss cocktail was pretty good.  I wish it had more of ginger taste and less ginger ale but still tasty.  I liked that it wasn't overly sweet.  

The grade of fish was pretty good too.  My uni literally melted in my mouth.  I ended up eating 4 pieces because I'm a piggy.  The saba was also delicious!  I had 4 pieces of those too.

The roast duck and shishito peppers weren't bad but weren't my favorite.  The duck was cooked perfectly but the flavors just didn't....meld well for me.  

The ahi and foie gras was, hands down, my favorite.  It was citrusy from the ponzu but earthy from the foie.  It melted in my mouth and I savored every last bite.  Talk about sex for my tastebuds.

The Koi crispy rice with spicy tuna was pretty good too.  It's basically spicy tuna served nigiri style but the rice is toasted.  If you've never had it here (or anywhere else, for that matter), give it a try.  I've had something just like this at another sushi spot in Los Angeles and this held it's own against it.  

We ended the night with CHOCOLATE Creme brulee.  It.  Was.  Awesome.  I don't know which chef got drunk and decided to mix in some chocolate to the standard creme brulee but I'm really glad they did.  I'm not a big dessert person but I found myself wishing I got one of these for myself so that I wouldn't have to share with my friend.

Well, granted our friends moved away from Roseville over 5 years ago and I guess they forgot just how good Mikuni's was.  We opted not to Yelp Koi, our mistake and just take our friends word.  I will say we sat in the Fountain Room, over looks the fountain light show at Bellagio, it was beautiful the first couple times of checking it out, then you kind of forget about what's going on outside because at this point, you are working on not dying from hypothermia.  

OK, enough about that, we ordered up a bunch of different overpriced sushi rolls and unfortunately not one of them was memorable.  Our tab was $180 bucks for four of us and we did have a bottle of wine.  One would think with a price tab like that you would probably be leaving the place full and quite satisfied.  well that didn't happen and the reason is, the rolls are small, pretty simple really and nothing over the top like the rest of Vegas.

I suppose for a couple hundred more we could have walked away full, but it is hard to pay that much money for mediocre sushi rolls.

But don't fear, Pinks hotdogs is just down stairs and their Polish dog finished off the job.

Upon arrival, we were told by the host that there is no table and asked us to wait at the bar.  After 30 mins and 2 drinks later, it was 8pm and we were tired of waiting so we were ready to walk out and tell them to cancel our table.  As soon as we walked to the host table, they told us that our table is ready.  I believe it's a marketing trick they use to make you spend more money at the restaurant.  When we walked into the dinning room, we noticed tons of empty tables.  While we were waiting for our table, we did not see a lot of people walking out of the dining room.  Of course we were pissed about that.

As far as food goes, definitely not worth the money we were paying.  Most of the rolls are between $12 - 25.  Here is what we ordered:

1.  Dragon Roll:  it has  alot of those crispy thing on top and I can not taste what is actually in the roll.  All I ate was rice and the roll is like $19  or something like that.

2.  Rainbow roll:  the typical rainbow roll you can get at the regular sushi place and again, we paid way too much for it.

3.  Salmon sashimi:  the fish is actually ok.

That being said, this is what you're paying for. It's a no-brainer that such a recognized sushi joint would target tourists in Vegas.

One Hamachi fusion - Soy yuzu, truffle essence - This was the only one that we weren't too thrilled with. It was a little too fishy.
One Koi crispy rice - topped with spicy tuna - These were awesome. Something different. I liked the crispy rice and the spicy tuna with the jalapeno - outstanding. Top of my list.

One Geleno roll - Spicy tuna topped with spicy albacore, jalapeno, crispy onions, and spinach chips - Awesome again. Loved the spicy tuna, and the combination or ingredients was perfect. Loved this roll. (6 pieces)

1673259,2016-09-06,6,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"I've heard less and less about Koi over the years, but only recently made it in for a meal. I've been to the lounge for a few events that had passed apps but decided to get the pre-fixe meal for our dinner date here.

APPETIZERS: Edamame, miso soup, and shishito peppers. Standard dishes, nothing unusual. The shishito peppers were better than expected, but could have used more of the sweet soy sauce.
SIGNATURE PLATES: The Hamachi Fusion was the same as the hamachi carpaccio with jalapeno dish that is popular elsewhere. The signature Koi Crispy Rice is a favorite of mine, but BF found the rice to be dense and gummy. I was disappointed that there were only two pieces in the order. The Creamy Shrimp Tempura was a surprise, lightly fried and lightly sauced instead of covered in mayo as I had feared. Light flavor, large portion.
SIGNATURE ROLLS: Baked Crab Roll could also be called the basic crab roll but at least it was fresh. The Geleno roll (spicy tuna, spicy albacore, jalapeno, crispy onion, spinach chips) sounded like it would be nicely spicy but it was pretty tame, and lacked the texture I had anticipated from the onion and spinach. The Sunfire Roll (lobster, snow crab, cucumber, cilantro, mango, avocado) was light and refreshing but could have used a sauce to pump it up a bit more. 
We also added on the salmon carpaccio dish with black truffles and citrus- it was probably the best dish of the night despite the heavy-handed use of truffle oil. The sashimi was nicely fatty but very thinly cut, the microgreens added texture, but the dish overall needed more citrus and less oil. 
DESSERT: The Koi Cheesecake was very cheesy, as in not sweet as a dessert is typically expected. The white chocolate walls, whipped cream, and fruit used in the plating were necessary to make the cake itself palatable. 

Overall, we were let down by the food. The atmosphere is nice and staff were attentive and polite, but the dishes just didn't impress. While their fish quality may be high, I didn't notice enough of an upgrade to compensate for the lack of flavor- I've had more interesting rolls at off-Strip AYCE spots.The signature dishes were okay, we just expected better.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,11,3,aUENPYvbiSFDLvq3ralkug

So when my friend's from Denver invited me to dinner before the Lionel Richie show this past weekend I reluctantly agreed.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the food here.  First off try the lychee martinis.  It's one of their signature drinks and it's fabulous!  We shared an order of the lobster tacos.  They are bite sized so definitely an appetizer.  The sunfire roll had lobster and crab inside and was my favorite.  Probably the best sushi I've ever had.  The Chilean sea bass in a shiitake broth was delicious as well as the sauteed asparagus and mushrooms.

1870923,2013-04-18,0,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"Very inconsistent. 
I went twice in the span of about three weeks and had polar opposite experiences. 

The first experience was great. The food was fantastic, every dish was full of flavor and interesting. There was always something that stood out about the dish whether it was the flavor of something or the freshness of the fish or some texture on the dish. I was with a group of 7 and we all enjoyed it. My personal favorites were the eel and avocado rolls (there were two varieties of this) and the spicy tuna on crispy rice.
The service was fine; it took a while for the first dish to come out but afterwards we had dishes coming rather steadily. 

The second experience was terrible. Terrible to the point of I probably won't go back to Koi. We ordered our first dishes and it took quite a while to come. When they did come out, one order was completely forgotten and another dish was wrong. We had asked for yellowtail on crispy rice. The dish was clearly spicy tuna and the waiter told us that no, it was yellowtail. One of my friends had already put some on the plate and the waitress attempted to take the food off his plate and bring it back to the kitchen. The food's getting thrown out, he was going to eat it, let him eat it. Besides, isn't it against the health code to bring food back to the kitchen? Anyway, they brought out a replacement dish and said it was yellowtail, it may have been, but it sure as hell wasn't yellowtail on crispy rice. Screwed up the same order twice.
The service the rest of the night was just as terrible. Food was mediocre at best, oftentimes with far, far too much salt added. I didn't eat any of the entrees because they came a full 45 minutes after we finished with the appetizer. 

I guess it's Vegas, you're taking a gamble when you go here. Could be good, could be terrible.",4HvIzTHB9o-aI6M8IO3SPQ,0,0,3,So8QI7TW8iZUQ0C2VdHe0A

Connie C. states it well when she calls it ""Zen-Chic"" cause it feels Vegas when you walk in, which is very non LA/NY vibe. 

We sat in the back area which overlooked the strip, a decent view (it's no BOA steak house view like at Caesar's or Fountain Room of Mandalay Bay) but it was nice, you can see the Bellagio fountain and the Paris Hot Air Balloon. 

The food was a bit pricey for what it was, albeit good, I know that making it in LA could shave off $2 - $3. However there was an appetizer that was not on the menu that we ordered (a kobe beef topping on a fried wonton with chives and spicy mayo) and it was a tasty treat being the chef made without us knowing exactly what was in it and from a picture. 

I'd come here again with a group because it was fun, but I think I'd look off strip for a cheaper experience. But if you don't mind paying more based on atmosphere and location while still getting great sushi, then stop by Koi for your fresh fish fix.

EATS:
-Crispy Rice topped with Spicy Tuna $12, Fan-freakin-tabulous.  Imagine nigiri, but the rice is CRISPY and some fiery fresh tuna atop.  
-Yellowtail & Scallion roll $15, 8 maki pieces, asked for spicy, & they zig zagged some sriracha sauce on the plate, not my idea of spicy, but  it was surprisingly good, some pieces were lacking in quantity of fish.
-Hamachi Fusion $22, sliced hamachi w/slices of jalapeno & a light sauce, wonderfully buttery.  I think I can safely say this is as good as Nobu's, or better, b/c it's got MORE heat.
-Baked Lobster Roll $22, 6 maki pieces, the bf liked this, it's a little heavy for my taste, pieces of lobster in the middle of the roll, with creamy sauce atop, tasted like warm sour cream & onion flavor.  
-Miso Black Cod $27, fairly big piece of cod, the miso glaze reminded me of hoisin sauce, I thought it was a bit too thick.  The fish quality was not compromised and I liked the grilled veggies.

Drink: 4oz glass of Nanbushi Sake, nice smooth finish, went well with all of the dishes.  $12

Original review 11/12/07:

Official opening on 11/9/07.  

The strip's newest Japanese Fusion restaurant @ Planet Hollywood. 

Views are enviable: facing Bellagio's acclaimed fountains. 

Signature hot dishes: Miso glazed cod, Kobe beef filet mignon & soft shell crab w/ponzu sauce.  

And YES this is another COPY from the LA and NY locations.

Called tonight for reservations, but it seems they are DARK on Mondays, at least after a BIG opening weekend.

Maybe it's just me... but when I'm in Vegas I *never* go to Planet Hollywood for anything.  Generally speaking we stick to Palazzo, Wynn, Ceasars and Bellagio.  This stop at PH was a first - and only to go to Koi, which was seriously lacking in customers for a Thursday night in Vegas. 

We ordered crispy rice with tuna, kobe beef carpaccio, seared tuna with fried red onions, creamy rock shrimp tempura rolls and a dragon roll.   Everything was as good as I remember it from LA with the exception of the crispy rice with tuna.   I do love that dish... but I felt that the rice was over-fried (nearly burnt) and that was disappointing.  If I'm gonna go there, as far as calories go... it better be worth it.   That one was not... but YMMV.  It is a signature dish so on another day it may be better.  

Still love the kobe carpaccio and the shrimp rolls.  The seared tuna with red onion could use a few more slices of tuna.  They're really stingy on that one.   It's a nice combination, but I've had it twice now and I don't think I'd order it again.

We also tried the kobe pot stickers and they were good but not great. Tasty enough, and I particularly liked the little bit of heat that the dipping sauce had on the finish.. but just not mind blowing overall.  I wouldn't turn one away but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to order it again either.  

Koi is expensive ... so all things considered you might be wiser to spend your money at a restaurant where the atmosphere is more upscale and  service is more attentive.

Not to mention, was just not very friendly!  We had to stop another server (i hate having to do that), a nice young man who was SO helpful and very personable.

They oversold their $80 tickets and the ""open bar"" was a 40 minute wait for a drink, if you have boobs, which I don't.  

It was absolutely so miserable that we left and spent time on the crowded dirty-ass Strip instead.  But before we left, I went down to the casino floor to grab a drink, and the bouncer gave me a bunch of crap and wouldn't let me take it in, even though they were not actually selling alcohol inside (but giving it away at the ""open bar"") and knowing full well that the bar wait was at least 40 minutes.

They sat us in this gorgeous, secluded area in the back that looked like a place that you would rent out or reserve for larger parties.

I still have to say the staff once again was both accommodating and not the general fake friendly you get in most places. We did manage to get the same waiter as before and that ultimately at least saved the meal (for me anyways). He laughed when my wife yelled ""HEY WE HAD HIM LAST TIME"". Only in Vegas?!? Ha-ha. 

The food itself looked to have gone through a complete overhaul since we had been there before. The portions were smaller and the presentation lacked from before, but the price certainly didn't change which for what we got vs. what was paid for well I'll leave that up to your imagination of where I planned to go with that.

Once again we definitely indulged in the menu and held nothing back that night. e collectively shared the Baked Scallop Roll, the Baked Lobster Roll, the Kobe Surf and Turf Roll, the Spicy Tuna Roll, and another one with Shrimp that I did not catch the name of (it was a ""secret"" one not offered on the menu that was suggested).

The Baked Scallop Roll and Lobster Roll were missing the sushi sauce and flakes that it had been presented with during my first visit which I was really bummed about. However I will not discount the taste because it still ranks up as one of the best I've had to date. The Surf and Turf roll I really recommend because this hands down was the best of the night. I think the man in me says it was the Kobe Beef that partnered with the sushi part of it just sky rockets into taste oblivion. 

All in all, I wonder what brought on the change to the presentation of the food, but it still by far is one of the better sushi locations I've inhabited.

Tuna Tartare: 4/5 pretty good and w. a good balance of flavor.

Roasted Duck Breast: 4/5  it was cooked exactly the way it should be but apple brown butter sauce was just average, pushing it down one star.

Dragon Roll: 4/5 typical dragon roll, nothing special.

While their prices are up there (I mean come on, it's Vegas) it is seriously a really great place to go if you want some tasty and well done sushi.  

I've been two times now, the first being about 3 years ago.  At the time, I was fairly new to sushi.  But I remember ordering their spicy tuna rolls and feeling like they were incredibly flavorful and well made.  I had since then been telling people it was my favorite ST roll by far.  

Let me just say that when I usually feel like this about a restaurant and build it up in my head and then revisit after a couple years...that it usually isn't what I remember it to be.  But and this is a big BUT, the spicy tuna roll the 2nd time around was even better!  I could have scarfed them down in a short minute if I hadn't been trying to sample some of the other rolls we had ordered.  We also ordered the Crispy Rice (as per recommended here) which I thought was pretty fair and the Dragon Roll which is incredibly tasty!

It is inside the Planet Hollywood hotel and has great decor. 
When we arrived we had to wait in the bar for our table which even with reservations was not ready (good sign right- nope)... 
So in the bar we went to get a pre-dinner cocktail. As we sat down the bartender broke a wine glass by the ice and didn't change the ice bin. I'm not a bartender, but I'm pretty sure rule #1 protect your ice. 
So we decided no mixed cocktails (bummer I wanted a vodka soda). He was so preoccupied and overwhelmed we got sat before he ever got us our beverage. 
Then we sit at the sushi bar and the chef's look like they know what they are doing- so we are relived. I was hoping they could re-save the first impression. 
They did, but unfortunately the Sushi chef's were not good enough to carry the rest of the terrible service. 
Our waiter forgot our drinks in the bar, never asked us if we wanted another round, walked past us twice when we tried to flag him down for the check. Then when we felt so compelled to complain to the GM he was totally oblivious to his customers needs and walked passed us. 
Little to say this was a total crash and burn - even if it was the best sushi we have ever had the experience was horrendous. 

Sorry guys - need better trained staff. Customer service should be over the top here considering the mixed sashimi plate was $100.00. Note: Pick servers that are  not just there to make tips, but love the industry and want to feed and serve their customers.

However, the next day I asked a friend if they received the drink and dessert. She said that the bachelorette did receive it, BUT, the waiter told them it was ""complimentary on the house."" I asked a few of the girls to make sure it was not a misunderstanding but they all confirmed that my name was never mentioned and they were told it was on the house. I reached out to the manager. I was upset that the restaurant took credit for something I paid for. He was adamant that the waiter told them it was from me. I think I believe four of my friends over a random waiter who was probably scared to tell his manager that he messed up. Regardless, the manager kept telling me that what I was told by my friends is not true (essentially alluding to the fact that they were lying). I don't believe this was handled in a professional way and it definitely was not worth the added gratuity. I would recommend in the future that management handle these situations more professionally.

Quick update: The general manager reached out to me a few days after to apologize for how this was all handled. He offered to refund me for everything and was very apologetic.

- fried rice balls with spicy tuna on top - I love these and used to order them in NYC. Maybe my favorite thing.

- banana bread pudding - we actually ordered this specifically because of a yelp review we read. We were not disappointed, it was delicious.

Criticisms:
Food was great for happy hour prices. My biggest criticism is more of the layout of the lounge/happy hour area. The actual restaurant is way cooler looking and the lounge layout is kind of awkward.

My friend and I had been walking through Planet Hollywood when a greeter for the club approached us and told us about the deal Koi was having after the restaurant closed. It was all you could drink for $20. I was a little nervous about the deal, because it sounded too good to be true. And I was right. That night, we waited quite a while to get in and once we made it to the front of the line the bouncer was rude and even let a couple from behind us in before us. When I asked him what was wrong with us, he rudely told me he'd be with us shortly. I should have walked away at that point. Once we made it to the second line inside, our bracelets were cut off, we paid the $20 a piece to get a pink cup and walked in. The club was dark, jam packed with too many people, and tiny! 

My friend and I went up to the bar (well so we thought) but were standing at the last 5 feet of it that dips down. The bartender obnoxiously says ""that's not the bar (while pointing to the section we were standing at) this is."" The people next to us that were standing apparently at the correct section of the bar had left so we scooted over and he helped other people before us. Once he decided to help us, my friend asked for a Capt. and diet coke. His reply was: ""Not gonna happen. You can have this."" And holds up the cheap rum to pour our drinks. 

I sat down on an edge of something, to relieve my sore feet for a few seconds and before I knew it, I was being sharply tapped on the shoulder by another bouncer.

The first time I was with my parents and two friends for my 21st birthday. The second time I brought a huge bachelorette party of 10+ girls. The last time I was and will ever go there was just with my boyfriend for a romantic dinner.

Each time I've been, the service has been unfriendly, impersonal and slow. Having worked at an upscale restaurant before, I'm really surprised they operate this way on a regular basis. I feel their lack of service is pretty offensive to their high-paying customers. Doesn't matter if you're here on a weekend (the first two times I came here), in the middle of the week (the last time I was here), with a big group or just one other person. The service was consistently bad under every imaginable circumstance.

The sushi isn't great. During my last dining experience, the rice was actually undercooked in a rainbow roll I ordered-- for three times the price I'd normally pay, a crunchy rainbow roll was not what I was expecting. I also ordered albacore nigiri. It was so small and plain-- not even any garnish. Very sad looking. For the money, I was extremely disappointed. The only dish I did and have consistently enjoyed each time was their crunchy spicy tuna appetizer.

The desert-- the lava cake-- was underwhelming in flavor. The waiter didn't ask us how our food was or anything about our experience. Maybe they figure you're a tourist and won't be back? Not an attitude I'd think a place like this would adopt. The atmosphere is nice... but thus is the case with a lot of restaurants in Vegas, on the strip. As I recall from the first two times I was there, the drinks are nice-- but again, who has trouble finding a nice drink in Vegas? I wanted some great sushi and a nice dinner with good service in an upscale restaurant! I just couldn't find that here.

I always tip well, but I won't return. After our meal, my boyfriend turned to me and said ""Let's not come back here again""

I pulled up a chair at the sushi bar.  I ordered my favorite sake, Junmai Daijingo.  I asked the man behind the sushi counter to hook me up with his specialty dish.  I told him no exotics; I like rolls, tuna and salmon.  I've done this before at other sushi bars.  They usually give me one dish at a time.  If I want more, I order more.  I'm one person, and a petite woman.

He slides over 2 full rolls and 3 different tuna sashimi pieces on this huge plate.  I thought nothing of it.  I only was able to eat half of it.  It was good, not blow-me-away fabulous, by any means.  

When I asked for the check, I was stunned.  Not fair to assume I'm a dumb tourist who is willing to spend whatever.  I was the only person sitting at the sushi bar and I feel he took advantage of me.

I've played out this same scenario at Nobu at the Hard Rock and had a completely opposite experience.  That sushi chef gave me incredible dishes one at a time as I asked for them.  The bill at Nobu was half what it was at Koi.

I say skip it and go to Nobu instead.   A word for the sushi chefs at Koi: the next time you assume a customer is a tourist who doesn't know better, you'd better think twice before deciding to take advantage of that customer.

Umm, not crispy.  Actually soggy and soaked in the oil it was deep fried in.  The tuna on top was hardly spicy and had very little flavor.  At the very least, it was fresh.  Definitely NOT worth $16 and if this is one of their signature dishes, they may want to brush up on it.  

Feel the Heat roll:
Spicy scallop, crab, avocado rolled up with seared tuna and spicy mayo sauce on top.  Very fresh ingredients, great flavors and lovely spicy kick.  By far, the best of the 3.  But you know, it's just a roll, and a $22 one at that.

Right off the bat, I recommend the happy hour for the plates me and friends ordered due to that fact that each item is pretty much double the cost on the regular menu. Might as well save yourself some cash because though the food is flavorful, the portions are small. The same goes for the hot sake carafe and Sapporo. Half off hot sake and Sapporo...I'm all for it!!!

Now for the plates. There isn't any specific order I'll go in because everything pretty much came all at once. The sushi, the kobe beef potstickers, the tuna tacos, the calamari, and the skewers were all great. The big highlights though were the Mochiko fried chicken, the creamy tempura shrimp, the short rib dumplings and the roasted shishito peppers. These plates were eaten the fastest and were well worth ordering a couple of more rounds for (which we did of course). The shishito peppers were the best I've had by far and the short rib in the dumplings were awesome. I only wish there could have been more on the plate. 

Besides possibly still being hungry once you've finished depending on how much you've ordered, I have no complaints. The food was delicious, the atmosphere is nice and the Happy Hour is well worth giving a shot.

Personable and friendly. My son's dish wasn't correct and they quickly fixed it and treated us to the yummy mistake. The dinner felt a tad rushed but overall was good. I just feel like some of the menu feels stale as many of the courses are on menus every where. The stand out was the sirloin steak. Very very good!,MeoOij0u3S_HLpzLEoTvqQ,0,0,3,f5IUweV0-Mcebjn3535Aeg
3024273,2010-01-26,0,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"I have already reviewed the Los Angeles incarnation so I came to Koi Vegas with high expectations.  I wanted to see if their magic could translate on the Strip because so many restaurants come to mind where thats not the case (Canter's, Joe's Stone Crab etc...).  I think Koi nailed it...and given a few tweaks can be even better.

First thing I noticed about the Las Vegas space is its giant compared to the one in LA.  The lounge I think is the same size of the whole LA restaurant.  Its a little bit of the beaten path being upstairs at Planet Hollywood but where that might impact their foot traffic it more than makes up for in the FABULOUS strip view they have in one part of the restaurant.  If its a special occasion, make sure you put in a request for this view.  

The menu is almost a complete clone of the LA version as well.  On this particular visit I ordered a couple new items I had tried before.  First up was the Salmon Carpaccio with truffle oil which was outstanding.  I had a similar dish but with beef in LA and can recommend both, but for my money I'll take the salmon.  Next up was a Yellowtail covered in crispy onions.  Again, a wonderful favor combination where the crisp of the onions blends sublimely with the the smooth flavor of the yellowtail.  My only suggestion here would be to maybe offer more yellowtail on the plate.  It appeared the plate was overwhelmed by the crispy onions and you had to dig to find the fish. I always have to get a roll so I ordered a hand roll soft shell crab which was good and satiated my craving for that type of sushi.  Finally I split with my friend the skirt steak and ordered a side of their asparagus/mushroom combination.  The meat was tasty and the glaze a nice compliment, but nothing that will blow your mind.  It was  a safe pick and next time I might opt for more seafood.  However, I must say the asparagus & mushroom side was one of the finest side dishes I have ever had.  The chop the asparagus and mushrooms down to small pieces and blend them in a savor glaze.  I kid you not when I say I could order a full plate of this as a meal and be satisfied. 
I ended with an order of their chocolate cake which is always a nice little treat.  Nothing fancy, but nice if your finishing some sake or wish to get a desert wine or coffee.

All in all, Im a big fan of the Vegas location after being kind of skeptical heading in.  Its a big space and good for larger groups but the it also can be intimate if need be, especially by those windows where you can see the whole strip.  

I think next time I may save time and do cocktails after dinner there too because it looked as if they brought in a dj and shifted into a lounge feel later in the evening.  Ahh, but this is Vegas...where do we find time for it all???",9qjLfaAqMxgfqdtTlPwRUQ,0,0,4,kqmnAYRpjYJ-KJiXEbR5cw

Spicy crunch yellowtail tartar
Salmon carpaccio 
Miso soup

We also had an order of the oysters, which were not the best oysters I've had.... slightly disappointed. But then again, I'm used to oysters from San Francisco, so maybe I'm an oyster snob?

Happy hour in the lounge was nice. We grabbed a couple of tables and sat on a long couch. Food options were priced well and there were several martini options. I really liked the crispy rice with tuna and cucumber martini. Cucumber martini was so refreshing.

Happy hour service was interesting. The busser was really nice, took our picture and helped us flag our waitress. But then he took one of our tables before we left. Waitress was busy and once we paid she completely forgot she said that she would show us where to go for our dinner reservation (in the main restaurant).

Dinner in the restaurant was good but pricey. It's Vegas. 
Rolls range from $15 to $25+. Entrees are over $30 each.

Overall, good dinner option if you are going to the Axis theater for a show but hit up happy hour too for a better bang for your $$",fm2npkf_1BNUPRZQbvJA0Q,4,1,3,9M3SmPehHbsWmMj-WtIqxg

3081087,2009-06-19,0,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"Having heard a lot about Koi restaurant (located on the second floor of the infamous Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino) from such television shows as ""Celebrity Hot Spots"" on VH1, I was eager to wine and dine at this establishment on a resent jaunt to Las Vegas. Koi possesses a Japanese-inspired, Hollywood energy sort of vibe featuring a variety of savory cooked dishes, traditional sushi and sashimi, as well as creative rolls. The décor located within this establishment is absolutely amazing; a seductive harmony of Asian design elements makes this a great atmosphere for romance. This, however, is where my positive review ends.
     Upon arrival I was greeted by a charming hostess who promptly escorted my boyfriend and me to our cozy little booth in the back of the restaurant. Glancing over the menu, which featured an average of twenty-something dollar items, we decided to share five or six dishes between us. My first negative remark: an establishment that features such remarkable ambiance and rather pricey menu items should not have paper wrapped wooden chopsticks, I laughed, thinking to myself that Koi had spent so much money on the décor they fell a few dollars short when it came to the utensils. Koi also allows patrons to enter this high end establishment in shorts in flip-flops, which I feel drastically diminishes the appearance of the place. It also became evident after waiting twenty minutes for any kind of service whatsoever, that this establishment was extremely under staffed. The drink menu was that of any standard high end Japanese restaurant so I decided to be a rebel and order an Asahi from their extensive beer menu; they possessed almost all of the Thai/Japanese beers I knew! Unfortunately, the waitress was so busy she ran by our table, dropped my boyfriend and my beer on the table with a chilled glass without a word and scurried off to assist another table. I'm not trying to be a snob, but shouldn't she have at least assisted in pouring my beer for me?! At my local watering hole sushi spot they always pour my beer for me, oh well. After another twenty something minute wait we finally gave our order, let me walk you through the items I chose to indulge!

     Miso Soup, $5: I like the quality of the Miso Soup better at my local sushi spot in San Francisco. I felt like Koi's version was seriously lacking salt, and somewhat bland. 
     Edamame, $6: Awesome! Freshly steamed and hot with just the right amount of salt! I feel like Edamame can get soggy rather quickly but to my pleasant surprise, no soggy factor!
     Tuna Tartare, $15: This was by far my favorite dish of the evening. In hindsight, I would have ordered five of this dish and called it a day! One order includes two silver dollar sized portions, rather small for how scrumptious this dish was. They serve the tuna with avocado on top of a deliciously crispy wonton, fabulous!
     Yellow Tail Carpaccio, $20: Not impressed with this dish at all! I love yellow tail/Hamachi, but the quality of this fish was not fresh by any means. Again, I prefer the quality of fish at my local spot (maybe I should write a review for my local spot...) The yellow tail was thinly cut (like any carpaccio should be), dressed in Grapeseed oil, Ponzu, and Wasabi-Tobiko, which seemed rather oily and lacking any wasabi kick which I was craving.
     Kope Beef Potstickers $23: These had an excellent flavor, although it seemed like they had been sitting under a heating lamp for a while due to the lacking wait staff. Served with a Ponzu dipping sause, I gobbled these down quickly. I'm convinced if these were served immediately after preparation had been completed I would have had absolutely no complaints whatsoever.
     Baked Crab Roll, $12: Great roll, nice and creamy crab with a pleasant crunch on the exterior. Included wasabi and un-dyed ginger which was refreshing.
     Veggi Tempura, $18: I loved the selection of vegetables they included in this dish; Asparagus, Green Beans, Yams, Onions, Shitakes, Eggplant and Carrots. Nice and crispy yet not over battered like tempura can be at times. I would have preferred a traditional dipping sauce however, the side sauce Koi paired with the dish was rather greasy, causing me after a few bites to simply shove it aside.

     After completion of our meal, my boyfriend and I mutually decided to dine elsewhere for desert. I was not pleased with the service I received here, nor the quality of food in which was served. I would rather dine at Tao (located within the Venetian) or Nobu (Hard Rock) where I receive fabulous service that actually suits the high priced menu items. The atmosphere was by far the highlight of this venue; it is after all an extremely romantic setting, but that's where the glamour ends. Skip this venue and stick to your local watering hole sushi spot and/or the other two venues I suggested above; you will save a few bucks and receive the quality and service in which you are accustomed.",qOwSJ3sCXzqNIwW5t2YMdA,0,0,2,So_aQN0snBseXG-R4DgAUw

We ordered a couple of drinks, (my mixed drinks were great) and started with the baked crab roll and salmon roll. I really enjoyed both. We then ordered the specialty non happy hour Dragon roll which was good, but not worth $22, especially since it was only 6 pieces.

That was not enough food to fill us up, so we ordered the creamy shrimp tempura off the HH menu. The shrimp were very flavorful and great. 

I do have to commend the wait staff, because we chose the Dragon roll specifically be aise it did not list an ingredient I am allergic to.

Oh and my favorite part was the fresh grated wasabi. You cannot find this just anywhere perhaps because 1 plant costs about $160 (we looked it up online). But wow, you just have to try it. Place some on your sashimi or sushi and it just compliments it so well. It also helps that the fish they use here is super fresh. I'm particular about my sushi because I've had some of the best in Japan and when I say their fish is good. I mean it.

Lots of texture and flavor and the crispy onions were a perfect accompaniment. We then tried the the kobe beef potstickers which were good, but if it didn't say Kobe beef, I wouldn't know otherwise so we basically paid for the name. Lastly we tried the creamy rock shrimp tempura and the baked lobster roll with creamy sauce. Both were perfectly prepared. I wanted more of the lobster because the portion was so small. 

A note on the service -- I was supremely happy with our service for the first hour and then suddenly our waitress (Melody) disappeared for about 30 minutes and forgot about our drink order. I'm not sure what happened to her. When she came back to check on us, we had finished all of our food, all of our cocktails, all of our water and expected a cocktail (which we had ordered). She had 100% forgotten. So we took the check and left. There's nothing that makes me more pissy than crappy service. I might consider going back to Koi again next time I am in Las Vegas because their food is very inventive and interesting, but I would probably sit at the bar next time to avoid the disappearing waitress routine.",6yoLIq4bN-xo_L0GZoHu3A,0,0,3,ofW9tv-kk3R2Hk-zN1D0Kg

It's about 3.5 stars...

I would give all 3.5 stars to the Baked Lobster Roll with Creamy Sauce!

It was like butter...just melts in your mouth. 

All other dishes were just ok.  The hamachi dishes to start were good, but still lacking flavor.  The dragon roll was good too, but not memorable amongst dragon rolls I've tasted in the past.

BEAUTIFUL decor. There's a different feel for each room. My personal favorite: The Fountain View Room.

Surprised my fiance with dinner in the Fountain View Room with 10 of our other friends. Although we were an entire HOUR late (he and I), our waiter (I believe his name was Alex) was still as friendly as ever and answered all our questions thoroughly and even offered suggestions. 

The website says the average check per person is approximately $60. I have to disagree. It is quite expensive as each appetizer was at least $10 - $15 and main dishes started at $20 a piece. 

I had a seared ahi dish and dragon roll plate. Delicious. My mouth is watering as I write this. Top it off with a mojito. Ahhhh.

With our party of 12, our bill came out to $700. We're big eaters and we love Japanese food. I believe there is an 18% gratuity fee for parties of 12 or more.

Don't let the price scare you away. If you enjoy Japanese food, check out Koi the next time you're in Vegas. :) It's worth it!",ok8aAyXB8FQeBbZOFfQEzw,0,0,4,n7U2sNzk3nTOl_E3JjS02A

The food was awesome. We did have bottle service in the room by the big window for our big group so there was drinking involved in the evening of course, but I think it really was that great. I liked everything we had, the view of the Bellagio was phenomenal, and our waiter was super fun.

Food highlights:
* Sushi over crispy rice: by far the best dish of the evening. My husband doesn't even like sushi, but he ate the rice part up and wanted more. 
* Any of the sashimi: fresh, good quality and great flavor combinations 

The cooked fish and everyday unagi rolls were great (very soft rice) along with the veggie tempura. Everything is just taken up a notch here and not in a just for flashy way but in a way that works.

I then had the Miso Soup & the Cucumber Sunomono! It was the best. I love cucumber salad, and the cucumbers were sliced thinly and marinated well. 

Then I had the skirt steak... Which was great, and much more serving than i expected.  Since I cant eat most shellfish,  i tend to avoid sushi, but even that looked mouthwatering.

3453675,2010-07-28,0,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"We dined at Koi for my birthday recently and I was rather impressed after reading the so-so reviews on here. I must mention first that the service was top notch, our waiter was very friendly and helpful. I do admit there were a few times when he wasn't on top of refilling our sake glasses, but they are pretty small glasses so at least it made the bottle last a bit longer!

We had a couple of appetizers, Hamachi Fusion & Spicy Seared Albacore, both of which we really enjoyed! The truffle essence was a nice touch to the Hamachi Fusion as my husband and I are both huge fans of truffled anything! For sushi, we had the Baked Crab Roll, Dragon Roll, Rainbow Roll and my husband had some Uni (I'm not a fan!). We LOVED the Dragon Roll, it was excellent! I felt that the crab roll had a little too much rice and not enough substance, but the flavor was great without being too overwhelmingly saucy as some baked rolls can be. My husband enjoyed the Uni, although he said it wasn't the best he's ever had, but it wasn't at all bad. Everything was very fresh, very flavorful and exceeded our expectations. 

For dessert, I already had my heart set on the creme brulee when our waiter brought me out some birthday mochi, it was mango flavored and SO yummy! It was a small serving, so we still ordered the creme brulee. I'm a creme brulee fanatic and bake it a lot myself, so I'm pretty picky with the stuff and this one was perfect! The consistency was right  on and the sugar was perfectly caramelized on top, not too crunchy and not too soft. 

I'm docking 1 star off of my review mostly for the lack of a chef's tasting menu. They did have a chef's platter which we only knew of by asking, but we really enjoy tasting menus at sushi restaurants where you can also sample their best salads, appetizers, entrees AND sushi all in one meal without buying full servings of each. A great example of this is at Katana in LA! All in all a great meal nonetheless, and we would definitely go back!",9wGZvyEu3prSUVG7Y_DS2g,0,0,4,r-_BRP08_XOMDIK84-vDxA

We were here on a Sunday night for dinner and sat in the main dining area. There's a section that's very loungy with couches that overlooks the Bellagio...great view but the couches seem like they would be uncomfortable to eat an entire meal on. 

I got a bottle of the Star Rabbit sparkling sake- my ultimate favorite drink! I never find it anywhere and I was so excited they had it here. 
We started with the Cucumber Sunomono- a light pickled cucumber salad. I thought it was a great refereshing way to start the meal. Then we got the Vegetable Tempura which had asparagus, onions, shiitake mushrooms, eggplant, green beans and yams. I thought it was delicious. We also started with the Tuna Sashimi which was to die for. It came served on top of the most amazing sauce with jalapeno and garlic chips. One of my co-workers also ordered the kobe beef potstickers which he said were fabulous.
For our entree I shared the Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura and Vegetable rolls which were all great. The spicy tuna was my favorite. A little random but we also shared a side of the Shishito Mashed Potatoes which were so creamy and delectable. 

Dessert had to be the most amazing part of the meal. We ordered the dessert platter which consisted of Molten Chocolate Cake, Koi's Signature Cheesecake (white chocolate with raspberries....YUM), Berry Cobbler w/ice cream, and Vanilla Creme Brulee. Oh. My. GOD. 
It was so incredible. Between 6 people we devoured the entire thing.

3516044,2009-07-02,2,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"Here is my breakdown of rating
Decor: 4.5
Service: 3
Food: 2.5
Price for food: 1

This review is only for the happy hour.

First of all, this place is so overpriced that there is no way I would come here if it wasn't for happy hour. It's located on the second floor inside Planet Hollywood. 

Decor: This is definitely a winner. I feel like this is the only thing keeping this place alive because the decor is a pretty sweet deal. Good for dates or girl's night out or just a group hangout. 

Food: During happy hour, you can get some items at 50% off. That being said, the drinks are worth a try if you come during happy hour because at $8, it's pretty strong and it's not bad. We ordered the tuna tar tar and the california roll. Okay let me just say, I thought the tuna tar tar tasted pretty good. Let me also say, that for $8 during happy hour ($16 during normal), having 2 pieces of chips with tuna tar tar sitting on top of it, is NOT worth it. What the hell. Who the hell would pay $8 for one bite? It's not even a big portion. This is why you fail Koi. The California Roll was your average run-of-the-mill roll. Why the hell do they charge you $10 for it? It literally looks like the CA roll that you can find at your cheap sushi place down the street. Tastes like it too. 

Service: This wasn't great but it wasn't bad. I think the girl was just doing her job. She wasn't friendly but she wasn't mean either. I can't really complain about her because she was still doing her job.

Price: is the ultimate fail. Really, I think you're just paying for the decor (which is pretty sweet) but other than that, I don't think it's worth getting dinner here at all. I'm not trying to be cheap here; I would happily pay more if the food was quality or the portions were bigger. What I'm basically trying to say is, I want to get my money's worth. 

All in all, maybe if this place made the prices proportionate to the size and quality of their food, I think I would give this place a better rating. However, they really fail at doing that and this is why I say, come here ONLY during happy hour, if you even decide to come at all.",4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww,5,2,3,7FS12Wuhx5aDAmBezeOSYw

She turns to me when it was delivered to the table and said, ""I thought sushi was supposed to be bite size."" So did I! Her tofu was three inches on a side and the broccoli was 4 inches long and the asparagus 6. The carrots were bite size if you consider horking down a whole carrot lady-like. My wife's idea of a good time is not deep-throating dinner. 

So exactly what were we supposed to do with the three inch square slabs of tofu? I finally ended up sawing the rubbery stuff into bite-sized chunks. It really was rubbery. On a side note the tofu appeared to be stamped with identical 'grill' markings. I'm pretty sure these came pre-marked from SYSCO. 

My UNI was ok, nothing to write home about, the spicy tuna roll was totally uninspiring. She also ordered a 'rock-shrimp' roll, thing. If they were real rock shrimp my nephew is a simian (which would make me a Monkey's Uncle).

The bill, sake and a mojito included came to $70...yes, I really did type that, it's not an error, just a F#$@ing insult to anyone who values a dollar bill. $70!...One more time $70.

The 'piece de resistance' was each bite was attended to by the sushi chefs staring at us and watching us eat, not unlike New Yorkers watching you eat lunch at a diner hoping you'll barf up a lung or go into cardiac arrest so they can have your seat and get through lunch before they must return to their cubicles in the sky. Most uncomfortable meal I've ever had in a restaurant. My wife finally jumped up and said, ""I'm outta here, I'll wait for you outside"".

You want real sushi at a great price without the pretentious BS, there's an all-you -can -eat place in Chinatown one block west of Valley View on Spring Mountain. I need to write a review of this place. It's in a little cluster with a Korean BBQ place. Awesome food, great prices and they're too busy to watch you eat every mouthful.

The restaurant is too dark, which makes it hard to see the nice decor. The thing that impressed me the most was the creative drink menu. But lets face it, you don't go to a nice sushi restaurant to order a fruity martini. Everything on the menu you have had before. There was nothing new or creative that sparked my interest. You might be saying to yourself, ""that's fine, I like the basics."" Well, if you do you can find a cheaper place to eat that is probably just as nice. The portions sizes were not worth the prices we were charged. I left there still feeling hungry. We went on a Friday night around 7:00 and there were a lot of empty tables, maybe that is a sign that the place isn't all that it's cracked up to be. There were a lot of large groups at the restaurant. So if your main issue is finding a restaurant that can seat you and 10 of your friends and you aren't really worried about the quality of food then this would be a good place. I have no problem spending a lot of money on dinner. I love to go out to eat, try new things, places, etc. But if I do I want my moneys worth and I didn't get it here.",3wzomxm2mM_VKuFvAol1LQ,0,0,2,i5c563618giTlmooRRQyIg

Service:  friendly,  attentive, not pretentious--our server was great!!!!   The bar service would be my only complaint and it wasn't enough to dampen our evening whatsoever.   The pours where a little weak and as the restaurant became more crowded, bar service slowed down.  

Food: delicious!!!!   Black miso cod, skirt steak, teriyaki chicken (for me:) and tons of sushi.

I judge a Japanese restaurant by the rice, and the rice just wasn't nearly at a quality that justifies the price.  The pot stickers tasted store-bought; we had much, much better ones at Todd English PUB by the Aria lobby.

Judging by the menu, it seems Koi is pared down to basics familiar to people with only a causal interest with sushi or Japanese food.

The staff were very friendly if not a little too eager.  A bunch of different people stopped by every few minutes to top off water, ask if we are okay, or take dishes away.

At the recommendation of other Yelp users we requested seating overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. We were seated overlooking the Fountains, but no one mentioned that Planet Hollywood was doing some construction just out the window so the view was not great.

We are from the midwest so had high expectations that the sushi rolls would be fabulous compared to what we can get at home.

As for the food, it is amazing.  

Koi, how do I love thee, let me count the ways (We skipped the traditional sushi and ordered tons of specialties):

Crispy rice spicy tuna: freaking yum! 

Tempura hand rolls and crab hand rolls  love these..I am not a fan of seaweed and I love that the hand rolls are not wrapped in it.  Tempura was crispy without being greasy.

Kobe carpaccio: wow. So tender! Sauce was not overpowering and the candied mushrooms were sweet, crispy and awesome.  I hate mushrooms but I could eat these every day.

Albacore onion:  another winner! Great sauce and nice crispy onion stringy things to complement the fish.

Kobe potstickers: ok, added these to the rotation this last trip and they were not my fav.  Just okay.  With so many other choices these will probably not be ordered again.

We love this food because it also is not very heavy.  We get to try tons of stuff and don't leave feeling like it.  In fact, we are going back tonight. We are going to try the sushi bar and see how it goes!",87AXJ_GCGhz7RntCvbokLw,4,3,5,kidTB_l1QtCucyHdTwanLg

Here's what we ordered:
- Cucumber Sunomono: whatever
- Salmon Carpaccio: While this dish wasn't awful you could def taste the fishiness of the salmon...somewhere where you're paying this type of money and with it's reputation should not have fishy salmon. I've also had this dish at another restaurant and it was waaaaaay better. 
- Tuna Tartare: this dish was pretty good
- Vegetable Tempura: tasty
- Sea Scallop Special: Although the scallops were the biggest things I've ever seen the flavor was blah. The black rice was SO salty I couldn't eat this dish and I lOVE love love scallops. 
- Dragon Roll: this was good and covered in tempura...drowning in it actually. 
- Lobster Tail: I wish they had more veggies on it
- Miso Black Cod: pretty good

The drinks were good but nothing special but especially pricey. 

The food came out way too fast and almost all at the same time. They had no interest in letting us enjoy our dinner or conversation.

We thought 8pm reservations on a Saturday night would mean a full restaurant, trendy vibe, and the restaurant's best servers. You know, 30th birthday-worthy treatment. Nope. If there were other people dining at Koi, they were nowhere near us. The lighting felt like being at the bar at 2AM when the fluorescents are kicked on to scoot everyone out. And our waiter had no clue what was on the menu. He tried describing the sashimi the way a freshly-pimpled teen might try to describe wine. ""There's like notes of flowers... and the texture is like, raw..."" Just stop.

The sushi was also underwhelming. We did the larger chef's selection and a few specialty rolls. The pieces on the chef's selection were really fresh tasting and worth the order. However we all felt pretty disappointed by the specialty rolls. Not a ton of flavor, but a lot of mayos and crunchies. Like what you get at the supermarket. Or Walgreens. 

Fortunately the cocktails were strong and smoothed over the meal and service; but for over $100/person I needed more. Yes 'need'. It was my 30th birthday and I NEEDED that top notch celebration.

It has a nice sweet orange flavor to it. Do expect it to be strong. The sangria was a-ok, but it does have a small kick to it as well.

Tiger prawns-Delish! Nice sweet glaze on the shrimp with a good size to the shrimp. The glaze is just so addicting and goes well with the crispy breading.

Spicy Crunchy Yellowtail Tartare- Tender fish full of flavor. It's typically what you would expect in a Yellowtail Tartare at other places.

Koi Crispy Rice- famous dish. If you decide to come definitely try this. I chose to top it with the spicy tuna which went really well with the dish. The fish is also tender which goes nicely with the crispy rice. HOWEVER, it comes in a small portion with only a few pieces so expect your satisfaction on this menu item to be cut short.

Seeing this place had an early happy hour, my group and I figured to get the night started here. The atmosphere / ambiance is very trendy and looking at the prices, I anticipated some excellent quality sushi.

Started with the Salmon sashimi which came out fresh with anticipation. Yet, my hunger was not satisfied!!! Of course right? Ordered some Spicy Tuna Roll, baked Lobster Roll with Creamy Sauce and Sunset Roll. The service was mediocre as customers were still slowly creeping in. 

When our main wave of sushi came in, the overall group consensus was unfortunately dissatisfied as the quality/freshness of the remaining sushi was not up-to-par and the felt the meal was overpriced for what its worth. 

We tried to make up for it by giving this place one more chance by ordering the Kobe Surf and Turf Roll with Garlic Soy. Unfortunately, the Kobe beef lacked the flavored and did not fuse well with the remaining ingredients of the roll. 

I give them place an thumbs up for the trendy decor ambiance but the food was lacking in quality for its high price tag. Sadly, I place this place on the DNR  list  (Do Not Return)",IRnxyUjjJyZ3P6WqU_qgwQ,0,0,2,PwTP8jEWej88-aiTm9MHpw

For starters, I ordered the seafood miso soup.  The menu says clams, shrimp, and bay scallops.  There was one clam which was very good.  The shrimp was fine and the bay scallops were good, too.

For the main course, I got the sesame encrusted lobster tail.  The plating was artfully done.  The lobster was OK.  I had two issues.  One, encrusted means one thing to me and another to Koi.  I imagined more sesame but there was merely a sprinkling.  Second, the lobster tail didn't have a very distinctive lobster flavor.  It was rather bland.  The kitchen helps you out by cutting under the meat and along the sides and then across the meat.  You're able to eat it easily without having the whole tail removed from its shell.  With the lobster, you get baby bok choy.

For dessert, I chose the flourless molten chocolate cake.  It comes with some berries and vanilla ice cream with butterscotch sauce.  This was excellent!

Service was very good.  My iced tea glass was replaced with a fresh one as I neared the end of each one--no need to ask for a refill.  

This place just lacked the 4 star experience I'd hoped for.  It was the food, not the service that brings me to rate it as OK.  I still have money on the gift card, so I'll be back to try something else in the future.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,2,3,Vjs_pJOGcjdm-H24IQCCKQ

After the complimentary bottle of champagne gifted to us by Planet Hollywood and a gaze at the amazing view of The Strip from our hotel room we decided it was time to get dressed up and go out. We only had to venture down the lift.

I had heard of Koi only as a restaurant frequented by celebrities, and consequently had certain expectations. Koi definitely met them. From the minute we stepped inside we were given some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. The wait staff were welcoming, attentive, knowledgeable and efficient. It definitely felt classy and you were made to feel special.

Koi is a great place for an intimate gathering. The seating is comfortable and spaced out enough for a private conversation. You also don't have to worry about interruptions from nearby patrons because you can't hear them. The ambiance is great, and the lighting just dim enough.

We tried almost everything we could on the menu. The cocktails, hand rolls, edamame and creme brulee were my favourites. We did rack up a large bill for a sushi restaurant, at least $160. However it was the perfect place for the first night in Vegas and I remember the experience fondly.

Unfortunately there were no celebrity sightings because they make good use of curtained areas and the back door exit. That's okay though, I'm happy for Nicole Richie and others to graze in peace.",qmuCid52Y-SaJS_6v2CkNg,5,0,4,Q4OCIAgc_8KWV7LcbDOsTQ

When the actual night comes, we were lucky enough to get that lounge table. Was it as amazing as the pictures? nope, but was it nice and left us feeling a tad exclusive? sure. We were even able to see parts of the Bellagio fountains from that view so we were happy about that.

The service was really good, the lady didn't mess up anyone's orders as there were 8 of us, and everyone pretty much enjoyed their food. We had sangria, it was good and strong but definitely not the best I've had. The food was also a okay in my opinion, since we are kind of sushi snobs and expect the best out of pricey establishments such as Koi, but then again, I kinda knew we were coming mostly for the view and good seats. The sushi was below par in my opinion, it was tasty but definitely not enough fish in the rolls, they were a tad heavy on the rice. However, our friends liked their non sushi items and their martinis that they kept on ordering. They preferred the ones with the rose petal btw. 

So overall, we had a great time, had a yummy dinner, tasty drinks, and a great view. Maybe I had bigger expectations in my head, but what else is new, but my hubby left happy so I was happy that his birthday dinner was a success.

It was good but missing something!  Literally...tiny steak bites and nothing on the side.  The waiter asked if we wanted mashed potatoes.  Weird...cuz I thought Koi was Japanese.  That's a first!

Ladies drink free; only house liquor though.  House Liquor = Not worth it!  The one plus of UL...the music!!  I don't know who was DJing but music was good ALL night, even at dinner.

My wife ordered a green tea, asked for sugar, and her request was forgotten, so we had to ask again.

Placed our order, has my wife's plate delivered to the table, and no less than 10 minutes later, the waiter came to apologize, saying my entree was not submitted.

We then had the hamachi sashimi, followed by three delicious rolls (sunset roll, baked crab roll and another roll I am not remembering the name of). Finished dinner off with their signature white chocolate berry cheesecake which was just to die for.  Service was friendly and on point and the drinks were what you would expect from Koi.

They have a small and uninspired choice of signature rolls as well as traditional hand and cut rolls. The fish was definitely fresh but there was a lack of flavor that made me reach for soy sauce, which I almost never do.

I also had the salmon carpaccio which was good for the first couple of bites but difficult to finish. The sauce was really overpowering and I felt they could have put just about anything in that sauce and it would taste exactly the same. 

I also felt similarly about my friend's scallop entree, one was enough and I couldn't fathom finishing off an entire portion of a dish that was decent but not delcious.

Walking in, we were, of course, bombarded with slot machines and temptation but managed to stay on our mission to find a suitable place for dinner. It wasn't long until we found a member of the hotel who directed us to a few places just upstairs above the casino. One restaurant was a steakhouse while another was a darker, more alluring venue: Koi Restaurant.

As we were walked to our seats, I could have sworn the place was a ghost town. It turns out I was wrong, the entrance is actually their cocktail lounge - that apparently turns into a nightclub around 10pm - and their restaurant is hidden in the back. The restaurant itself revealed a good crowd of people - not too many, not too little.  The ambiance was very sexy, sophisticated and very Vegas after dark. There were several tables and black, cushioned booths with a large bar near the entrance. Our server was on point and without even prefacing the evening with ""we have a show to catch"" she was quick to give us menus, go over specials and have our individual plates brought out. 

To start, we shared the Koi Crispy Rice with Yellowtail Tartare (because the boys couldn't handle the spicier option: Spicy Tuna) and Crispy Shrimp Tempura (because all of us are #basic). Surprisingly, the CST had a kick to it but it seems as though it's tame enough for those sensitive to spicy foods to be able to enjoy it. For mains, I ordered a wonderful scallop sushi, which was fresh and surprisingly flavorful, and the boys each had a california roll, eel avocado roll and a sushi roll special. Every bite was delectable, fresh as can be and memorable and was true to the restaurants description of traditional Japanese food with a California flare. I can't wait to go back there in the future but for now, since I'm now home in New York, I'll have to check out their Bryant Park location!

I would recommend passing on the beef potstickers - 3 little half moons of bland potstickers.  My Uncle had a sushi dish with crushed crackers that he said was stale, so he brushed those off.  How can you put stale crackers on a pricey sushi dish?  I had the miso black cod and it was a rich and flavorful dish, which rivaled the miso black cod I had at Nobu.

4567213,2014-02-18,1,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"A super disappointing dining experience. My husband and I were staying at Planet Hollywood to see the Britney Spears concert (Britney!!!!) and made reservations for dinner at Koi to eat before the show. We arrived at 6:30 and were seated right away. The girls at the hostess stand were super rude and led us to our table in total silence. 

After we were seated, we were greeted by a super friendly waitress and our drink orders were taken. Drinks were brought out quickly and we ordered our food. We weren't too hungry so we just shared the spicy tuna crispy rice, glazed green beans, edamame and the lobster roll. 

So here's a breakdown of the food:
Spicy tuna crispy rice ($16)- Meh. Nothing special and not very spicy. Wasn't good or bad. 
Lobster Roll ($20)- Gross. It was a slimy cut roll with an insane amount of mayo on top. The only thing you could taste on this was mayonnaise. It was so bad, that my husband and I each tried a piece (after removing the big glob of mayo on top) and couldn't eat any more. Probably one of the most unappetizing sushi experiences I have ever had. 
Edamame ($6)- It was fine. But really, how can you screw this dish up? 
String Beans ($10)- The string beans were okay, but tasted like something I could easily make at home.

Our bill ended up being well over $100 (including drinks). We expected to pay this much, but were bummed out that the food was so disappointing. 

An extra star for our waitress, who was very very friendly and fun to chat with. Also, the decor is nice.

After the Britney concert, we randomly ended up back here because apparently this place turns into a ""club"" late night and we didn't feel like leaving our hotel to go somewhere else. It was okay. Drinks were overpriced and the dance floor was tiny. We still have fun though.",wXyvp0llSPwKJ9VZc2mI_w,1,0,2,8fGFj1LROl2IrDWuzPdOeQ

If you're on the strip, and want some delicious Japanese food, and have some money to burn, then this is definitely the place you should go to. 

I'm deducting a star for service, which was not as great as you'd expect for such a high end place. I was really turned off when they were bringing us a roll that we didn't order and when we said we didn't order it, the table nearby said it was theirs, then the server picked up a roll at their table and gave it to us.

this was by far the worst dining experience i have had while living in las vegas for the past 3 years...

waitress forgot to put in our drink order. then brought the order to us 30 minutes later and wrong...

then 40 minutes after ordering an appetizer... it finally arrives, room temperature and tasting stale.

PRAYING that the second round would go more smoothly we put in another drink order and 2 more appetizers.... this was a serious mistake....

lets start with the fact that they we're never delivered.
and all the ice from our second round of drinks was melted... who doesn't love a fully melted drink....i do not.
our waitress was a scared little girl who could hardly carry the tray.

after a 2 hour horror show. I walked to the server station to ask for our check, after having asked for it twice...I asked to see a manager and was told that he couldn't be bothered with my issues....

really?
the manager.... who's job is to keep customers happy couldn't be bothered to help appease a VERY upset customer...

ok...

Went this past weekend the 9th of October for a friend's 30th birthday.  Mind you it's her 30th birthday so it had to be special.  

We originally had plans to go somewhere else, but KOI's representative ""SWAY"" told us that there is a special.  $20 for women and all they can drink well drinks.  $10 for men.  For Vegas mind you that was a great deal, so decided to change the plans.  Informed them that MEN to FEMALE ratio and that it was going to be no problem. 

We get there and there is a lovely female trying to sell us bottle service.  We refuse and she tells us that if we don't buy a bottle service the male won't be allowed in.  We explained what we were told earlier and she told us, ""That's a different department"". 

 I then moved on to another female trying to sell bottle service that was part of koi also.  She informs me, ""That doesn't make sense, they should allow you guys, we never do that. ""

I get to the front of the line and then the bouncer tells me a whole different side.  By now I have gone through 4 different stories.  I ask to speak to the manager and they don't allow you to speak to them.  Also they tell you that there are different departments for each section and they all are not in the same page. 

I am what the FUCK!!!!  How can it be so hard to get in with 4 to 5 different stories.  

KOI killed the night and luckily we were able to get into CATHOUSE by my man CHRIS from http://www.freevegasclubpasses.com/.  He got me in with no problem.  

NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER BELIEVE ANYTHING KOI SAYS. Next time I am near KOI I will wear a shirt or a sign to boycotting it.

I would echo the recommendation for the Bento Box sampler. While a bit pricey(as everything on the Strip in Vegas) it was probably the best thing we had here.

Koi only falls short in a few points. It is hard to get around the high prices of dining at a Strip location - just can't call it 5 stars given the price to value ratio. Also, the ambiance was a bit strange. The modern furniture led to some weird seating - tables for 2 are setup for side-by-side seating with a couch/bench and artificial plants behind. A branch was poking me and I needed to rearrange it a bit.
The noise level is a bit too high for our taste.

We asked if we could be seated in the lounge facing out to the lake because there were several tables inside - and all unoccupied, but unfortunately they were ""reserved for friends of the owner."" Disappointing. Our booth was pretty nice though, and we were able to get a glimpse of the water show every now and then. 

The food was pretty tasty, although nothing was mind-blowing. It may have been because we stuck with ordering rolls, and not the signature dishes like miso black cod or Kobe beef filet mignon. Our friendly server suggested his favorites to us. We had the scallop roll, dragon roll, baked lobster roll and crispy rice topped with spicy tuna. The baked lobster roll with cream sauce melted in our mouths and was hands down our favorite. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was supposed to be their most popular dish, but the texture of the spicy tuna was odd. We weren't quite sure why it was so popular. It was super spicy though!

If their food had been expensive but scrumptious and service one of quality, believe me, I would have give them at least 3 stars. 
But no. They kept bringing us the wrong plates of food, and literally at least an hour after we first ordered it.. our waitress was gone more than 90 percent of the time we were there and at the end, wanted to keep a 50 dollar tip!
I ordered the lobster roll. I thought it would be hard to mess up Lobster but my roll was greasy.. it was basically just a california roll with some white salty sauce on top.. Although I will say their raspberry mojito was quite good. But would have been better if they didn't take 30 minutes to get them to us.

In Vegas for a work convention and wanted to start our trip out right with a nice night out for sushi and drinks.  I suppose it was our fault for deciding to eat sushi in vegas of all things.  The crispy rice with tuna was very good but way overpriced.  $16 for 4 small pieces - no thanks.  We tried the apple sake that the server practically convinced us to order and it was pretty terrible.  It was reminiscent of a smirnoff green apple drink which means it was too sweet and had a weird artificial after taste. 

The sashimi was fresh but was only 4 small pieces for $26 dollars.  I can't review the restaurant on the sashimi because it's about the quality of the fish really which was high. 

Needless to say a $100 check later and we were still starving after splitting basically 12 pieces of fish. The water was rude and pushy and when I paid in cash - he closed out or bill and threw away the receipt.  After asking him for the receipt since it was a business trip he gave me attitude about cash bill being closed out and that's just what they do throw the receipt away. I'm sorry but this was a transaction and I shouldn't have had to haggle over my receipt.  The server explained how he was way too busy but if we wanted to wait maybe he could find the time to dig in the trash and find our receipt. 15 min later he emerged with a wrinkled dirty receipt.  

I could have spent the same amount of money, walked away full and satisfied and enjoyed better service somewhere else.

I will start off by saying that I have planned and coordinated many events whether it be for work or for friends and family. It's amazing how often you will come across unqualified, incompetent, or rude event managers (read my review of The Chandelier). However, this story has a happy ending:)

Melody Pender and her staff are amazing! Even though I only gave her less than a week, she was quick to respond, offered thoughtful suggestions and insights, and made this entire event easy and seamless to plan. She tackled everything from room set up, optimizing our open bar, designating staff to our event, handling the guest list, and food orders like a champ. 

Day of the event she was able to accomodate last minute changes for the room set up even though we dropped in unannounced just a few hours before hand. During our party, she was almost always readily available and the few rare times she was not, each one of her team members knew exactly what was going on and how to handle the situation so I never had to explain or repeat myself.

I'll have to admit I did have lower expectation for food quality based on the reviews here, but they were surprisingly good. We ordered edamame, creamy rock shrimp (my fave!), the crab roll (best I've had before), kobe beef potstickers, and vegetable tempura.

I immediately made reservations for 6 PM through Open Table to take advantage of accumulating dining points and to make sure we had a table. No problems there.

The restaurant is located upstairs next to Holly Madison's Peepshow. A couple of tables and sofas were placed before the hostess check-in booth. When we arrived for our reservations, the restaurant was dimly lit. The host walked us through the restaurant and sat us in a booth. At 6 PM, there were only two other couples and a handful of people at the sushi bar, but I figured people were still sleeping or getting ready for their evening events.

The waiter was very polite and courteous, answered all our questions, and made suggestions after we asked what was good. After reviewing their extensive menu, we ordered:
Seafood Miso Soup $8, Miso soup with bits of clam, squid, tofu.
Crispy Rice(Tuna) $16, Uniquely made, these Tar tare styled tuna over a crispy rice sushi were a hit with us. The rice was crispy outside and chewy inside.
Fresh Oysters on a Half Shell(6) $24, 6 flavorful fresh oysters over a bed of ice garnished with lemon slice and dipping sauce.
Edamame $5 Lightly Sea Salted.
Grilled skirt steak $28, Piled high like a log cabin, the succulent slices were stacked 3x3, garnished with Alfalfa and paddling in a tangy reduction sauce.
Bowl of white rice $3, Got rice?
Total Bill = $77.18 before tip. Priceless.

Each appetizer and entrée plate was nicely decorated and simply beautiful. Pictures are proof, but tasting is believing. Therefore, I must encourage you to visit Koi at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. My first experience here demands a return visit the next time around.",O-uPZruoYgNhY__yq03jmg,10,8,4,B7svFbISTn1nJlRN4k519w
5318795,2012-09-09,0,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,I wanted to like this place way more than I actually do. Planet Hollywood is a pretty cool hotel and this place is trying hard to be trendy but just doesn't succeed. For those of you thinking of going here know that it's on the second level in a corner pretty much. We went for their happy hour and were surprised to see almost no one in the place. We ordered some sushi and had a few sake bombs. The sushi was alright but not great. We felt kind of awkward being in this big lounge area pretty much by ourselves. If I was staying at Planet Hollywood I would go here again but otherwise there are better choices on the strip.,wdBa3hQVQJAx_X-dOFfepw,0,0,3,GL29j-XyMGx2k-ty8csasA
5322239,2008-03-30,2,oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,"I was very disappointed with a dining experience I had at Koi in Las Vegas.

I used to like taking my customers to Koi in West Hollywood when I lived in Venice Beach.  I liked cute outside area, small but cozy modern dining room ambiance.   Their food was not the best but was good enough.  

Their Las Vegas location, it is much bigger than the LA location. The decor was very modern and clean with high sealing and large window overlooking the strip.  But not like LA, it was easy to make same day reservation.  I found out why later...


When our server came to our table, I asked a few questions to him

Me: ""Is the owner for this restaurant same owner as the West Hollywood location?"" 
The Server: ""Yeah""
Me: ""A Japanese guy?""
T S: ""No. He is Indian. But don't worry the chef is Asian.""
Me: ""Asian?  Is he Japanese? "" 
T S: ""He is Korean.  Same thing""  
Me: ""Not at all!!!""  Japanese food and Korean food are very different!  How can you say they are the same?  Are you seriously saying that?""  
""You think all the Asians are same?  You said the owner is Indian.  Indians are technically Asians too.""  
T S: "".................  Oh you are right Indians are I guess Asian.  I see your point.""  

(I wasn't talking to him with a funky tone and he was smiling... )


I liked their special cocktails but they were priced at $15-22.  I prefer non-mixed, on the rock kind of drinks anyways. I didn't like their food.  It was just OK... nothing special.
How can I take the restaurant seriously as a Japanese restaurant if they have low sodium soy sauce on the each table? When I saw that, I lost all the hopes for their sushi...  
So I ordered non traditional dishes.

1. Crispy Rice Topped with Spicy Tuna. $15 - Too much going on.  If you like ""American"" sushi such as Dragon roll or Philadelphia roll you may get it.  I didn't.  The rice was too crispy tasted like butter and Spicy Tuna was seasoned overwhelmingly that you couldn't taste the tuna.  I guess if you don't like raw fish, you may like it.  What is the point of eating sushi then...
2. Sirloin Kobe Style Shishito Mashed Potatoes, Truffle Sauce. $42 - I was happy that they at least stated Kobe ""style"" since it was NOT real Kobe beef. (I always talk about the difference between ""real"" Kobe beef and American Kobe style beef.  I talked about Kobe beef more in this review   http://www.yelp.com/biz/lucky-devils-los-angeles#hrid:9DsfdTEIdKVD9LciRxT7Lw ) The beef was not marbled by fat and it was on the chewy side.  I was very disappointed with the stake but the mashed potatoes were tasty.
3. Grilled Japanese Eggplant $8 - It was just ok.  The sauce was on the sweet side.  I like clean sauce such as ponzu sauce on the grilled eggplant better.

        
FYI, 88% of the item in their menu was not traditional Japanese cuisine.  I am ok with that.  I don't mind Japanese fusion dishes if they are tasty.

I give 0 star for their food, 1 star for nice friendly staff / service and 1 star for the decor / view.

It was a Prix Fixe menu...so we thought we would be served the same $140 menu despite having purchased the Groupon. When our 2 pcs of spicy tuna on crispy rice came, it looked like such a small serving, we joked to our waiter about it. That's when he let us know that on the normal menu, there are 4 pcs normally served...it is only Groupon customers who get the scaled down meal. Then our shrimp entree came and we were pleasantly surprised that it was such a healthy serving. We joked once again with our server, only to be told that we ""accidentally"" received the full price menu size and it actually should have been half that size since we used Groupon. He said ""it's too late now, what am I going to do, ask the chef to remove half?"" Wow, we were floored. If we had paid $140 for that meal, I would have been disappointed. I was content that $89 was a fair price but the purpose of Groupon is to give you better than a fair price, right?

My first experience was NYE, where we had a table and unlimited bottle service. My friend had to arrive during the afternoon to reserve our table. The first table they tried to give us had no actual table, the second was squished with no room for people to sit and we finally ended up with a table in the back, behind a curtain, nowhere near the action. Turns out bottle service was for off brand vodka only.. if you wanted a bottle of something you'd actually heard of, you were still paying $350 a bottle on top $100's we'd already paid for the table... wowza. We felt duped.

My second experience was for a girl's night out, 6 of us came for dinner. We were seated at a table near the back of the restaurant where we ordered drinks and appetizers. The drinks came out onsie twosies instead of all at once which was weird, and we waited forever for our first appetizer. We finally placed our dinner orders when a fight broke out between two groups seated in the booths behind us. It started with a few people raising their voices, then the manager came over to break it up. Before we know it some chick socks some guy smack in the face, and it's on! We were within inches of the action, literally; I had to duck to avoid getting hit myself. People were being pushed, a server ended up on the floor, tables were over turned and dishes broken while an all out brawl ensued. We grabbed our purses and got the hell out of the way! We went to the front and told them we were leaving and to please tell our waiter to cancel our orders. It was their one chance to offer us something to save face, free meals, free drinks, a return visit, something... but they didn't even apologize, they just looked dumb founded and let a table of 6 hot girls walk out the door.

I'd go with 4 stars for those, but I could see 5.

DRINK:  He recommended the most AMAZING bottle of unfilered sake.  It was to die for.  And I love unfiltered sake.  This was a new one that I haven't tried.  It was smooth, silky.... i wish i had a bottle of it right now.  

BITES:  He also started us out with edemame.  Which was basic...basically yummy and healthy.  Did we have miso soup?  Can't remember.... was the sake that good that i don't remember if i had miso soup?  

SUSHI and SASHIMI:  We had a few rolls.  2 or 3.  Again, why do i not remember them...maybe the sake WAS that good.  Anywhoo, I also had the salmon sashimi.  Or was that a different night.

When we get there the place was dead, upon entering it was like a western film when they show tumbleweed blowing by.

 Later on it did get busier though. This was very frustrating because they had only two bartenders and had a ""strict policy"" on one drink person despite everyone being all you can drink within the place (part of their normal promotion). I put their strict policy in quotations because it only applied to people the bartenders weren't friends with. We later saw a guy give some multi stage handshake with a guest and he walked away quad fisting drinks. We asked the bartender about this and he said that he ""saw him earlier with 3 other people "" and that he wasn't given double drinks.

What stood out to me the most about my experience at Koi Vegas was how the staff did not have their shit together in the least bit, and there were numerous mistakes with our orders.  I asked our server how long they had been open expecting him to reply with a short amount of time, but they opened back in November so there really is no excuse for the poor, jumbled service.  Our server was very sweet and polite, but I felt like there was a large gap in communication with the other staff members, and he could have been a lot more knowledgeable about the food.  There was more than one question he did not know the answer to regarding the menu; what the dishes were comprised of ect...

When the food did come out, some of it was great but most of it was ho hum.  The sushi rolls were pretty good, and the edamame was cooked and seasoned perfectly with salt (although I had to remind our waiter that we had ordered it) but my entree was lackluster.  I ordered the miso cod- big shocker, I know- and it was nowhere near as good as Nobu's, or as good as the cod at Koi in Hollywood.  The skin had all the flavor- the actual meat of the fish was kind of dry.  Definitely not moist and tender like its supposed to be.  If it were'nt for the flavorful skin, I would'nt have eaten the filet itself.

The ambiance of the restaurant is nice...its very large and has a huge window that gives you a great view of the Bellagio fountains across the street.  The restaurant was quite empty on a Saturday night, although Ms. Lindsay Lohan made an appearence while we were eating so I guess it is somewhat of a ""hot spot"" if you care about that aspect.

I ordered the Chilean sea bass($36), and it was outstanding! Simple and delicious. I was informed that Chilean sea bass is becoming rare to find. And, I rarely see it on menu anymore. Loved it. Melted in my mouth and I loved the light sauce it was presented with.

My guests had two entrees of the Tuna Sashimi and they said it was outstanding. Well of course, one of my guests is a regular, so he knew what he loved. I didn't try, but it looked delicious.

The fried rice with spicy tuna is always a crowd favorite, and they have the best baked crab roll (definitely order multiple of these as an appetizer!). I recommend ordering an assortment of dishes for the table so you're able to try much of the menu, because everything is worth trying. The only thing I didn't find extremely fresh was the UNI, but that could be a personal preference because it's not really my favorite fish anyway... (Little salty)

The lobster roll is one of my favorites; but it is rich because of the cream so you may want to share it or don't order much else if you do end up getting this roll. The cod was also one of the best tasting things we ordered... the texture was like butter and it just melts in your mouth.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the service was very friendly. The waitress let me charge my phone behind the bar (which some complain about doing). The wine selection isn't that great... but they have a decent selection of cocktails and sake.

Everything I've tried on the menu was worth ordering.  I'd say if something catches your fancy, go for it.  Our first time there we were incredibly adventurous (and amorous) and decided to have the sushi chef create a roll of any kind for us.  I still don't know what it was, but it may have been the best specialty roll I've ever had.  So, if you remember - order a roll that is chef's selection. Yum!  The drinks are strong too.

Koi was very mediocre for me. Sure, the space is nice and oh-so-chic. But it's not something I've never seen or that leaves a lasting impression. The service is not extraordinary and neither is the food. The decor kind of reminds me of Osha Thai on the Embarcadero and in the Marina. That's it.

I started with the kobe carpaccio rolls. It was pretty good but the 8 small pieces are not worth $28. I then had the skirt steak entree... which again, is pretty good but not worth the price (tiny portion). I was told by our waiter that would be enough to fill my tummy but it wasn't. So I ordered a veggie roll. That was o.k. too. The best thing I had was the raspberry mojito. Even the desserts (our table had several to share) weren't all that great and I'm a huge fan of sugar. Hrmmm for $100/person, it could have been better.
