87570,2016-06-15,0,e-F4OrM3O-5gIM_LvhT7Sg,On 6/11/16 I bought a  groupon for the ice cream cake so I ordered the cookie dough blizarrd cake from dairy queen on S maryland pkwy Las vegas but when i picked up the cake it looked nothing like the picture they have on website. Looked like a child decorated it also no cookie dough inside the cake. I Asked for manager they said no one avail until 6/16. I called and left my phone number for a return call but of course that didnt happen. Called them on 6/14 I got a so called manager by the name of q he told me on the phone to return the cake and he will refund my money when i got there on 6/14 at 615pm i asked for q but no one answerd there was 2 guys and 1 girl behind the counter so 1 of them said since i bought groupon cant refund my money only the difference. I said that isnt what you told me on the phone. I want my money back he said he cant so I Asked for the owner the guy said he my dad. ok well get ur dad on the phone. He refused and walked to the back never came back up front the other guy was very rude said im your not getting your damn money back and to take the cake with me and just laughed. I said then i want the difference he asked for the debit card because he wasnt allowed to give me cash but then throws my debit card and cash on me and walked away saying I ain't dealing with this shit. How do you allow ur employees to treat ur customers like this. They wouldn't give me the owners name. I've never been treated this way. They lack customer service and no empathy. How do you allow your employees to curse at your customers? I'm still in shock from the way I was treated and just how the so called manager just walked to the back and didn't handle the situation. Very unprofessional.,IQrU0nzBfvYACwuJ3sdStA,0,0,1,u6Jou6zPa4nMV0kmmFI5DA

                                                                Problem After Problems

1. Online it mentioned you can pay in the store
2. The young lady that called me could not comprehend simple directions, so I paid over the phone no big deal.

3. I placed directions for my cake online and I spoke with her over the phone to explain how I want the cake done. This was 2 days ago........

4. I picked up the cake 8/14/15 and the two guys couldn't find my cake. I waited for 15 minutes in the front and the guy finally asked me what was on the cake. I told him it had a Dallas Cowboys Star on it. My cake did not have a star, and it did not include what I wanted on the cake. It was very embarrassing that I had to show him that cake.

5. My husband cut the cake and it fell apart REALLY......... It was a disaster......... It had cookie crumbs as a cake......... I could have ordered from Smiths and it would have been better. Next time I'm going to have Fat Boys ice cream.

Overcharged by $10 for 6 blizzards, had to repeat the order to the workers approximately 8 times throughout the course of the time they were making them. Owner was on site and did nothing to correct all the errors. After 25+ minutes we finally left and STILL did not have the blizzards we ordered. The Blizzards we did leave with were completely melted due to all the drama. In the meantime of all this, the man who placed his order behind ours was told ""we just ran out of turkey for your turkey BLT - can we put chicken instead?"" To which the man just shook his head & laughed. Several parties walked in & saw the mess we were enduring & promptly left. 

Look I can forgive a few errors but this was beyond forgiving, especially with the owner on site, who did not even apologize or even attempt to make things right. Not OK!!!",z1tGfRDgfhfkV8ehNLiJrQ,1,0,1,VGosM6Bw0r7OQEgAm6iykw

2042331,2016-08-16,1,e-F4OrM3O-5gIM_LvhT7Sg,"Wanted to do something nice for my wife and pick up an Orange Julius on my way to see her at the hospital (our daughter is in NICU). I had never been but had heard that there was an Orange Julius in a Dairy queen fairly nearby. I pulled up and sure enough there was a large, installed (permanent) 'Orange Julius' sign on the building. I left with no Julius', though.

Upon asking for an orange julius the very kind young man behind the counter recited a well-rehearsed (apparently often-repeated) speech about how ""The slush machine is down right now and that is the main ingredient in an Orange Julius, but we do have....."" so I texted my wife to see if that sounded good. Not 30 seconds after saying it to me, the young man said the same thing about the frappe to the next customer - it is important to note that one of the big poster/advertisements in the window is for the frappe, which you cannot actually get. 

Not Julius for me, no frappe for the next guy. These guys need to either fix/replace the slush machine (it makes SLUSH for crying out loud, how hi-tech can it be?) or remove the signs that lead you to believe you can get any of the great things that rely on slush. 

My hopes of being a hero to my wife were the only thing that got slushed today. Thanks, DQ.",tZ4z3R0peQfZjenpbaDRYA,0,0,1,kSLgkaH25Cbn8OLUXjhntg

There's usually just one lady working, who is super sweet and friendly. When I got there today, there was no one else in the restaurant, however she was on the phone. I waited about a minute, and she took my order.  I ordered three snack wraps and fudge stuffed cookie. It took about 15 minutes for me to receive my food. I think I've received faster service at Applebee's. It's definitely not what you'd expect at a fast food restaurant. I will mention that two parties came in after me, which probably made her nervous. The wraps were fine, but the fudge stuffed cookie looked nothing like the photo. The cookie is supposed to be whole, but for some reason she cut it in half. It was also overcooked. 

They definitely need to work on properly staffing this location, and then I'm sure it'd be up to DQ standards. Until then, I'll pass.",xD0zXwapBausN9rwNLAXcg,1,0,2,dwL7Z7ycAL0WHMgi6i2new

I'm a Cold Stone kind of guy but hey my friend wanted to go to DQ for a change so I thought what the hell? Sure why not! When we walked inside it was pretty slow only one other customer dining in and another ordering! We were greeted friendly by one of the younger workers and she also made our order. Multi-tasker huh? I guess! I had asked about some of the creations you can normally get at Cold Stone but unfortunately they don't have those same ingredients that I need but I made it work! Turtle Pecan Cluster Blizzard in a Large cup please! I also added cheesecake because I can lol. So all in all I am glad that I didn't get that same negative experience that everybody else seemed to get! Glad I caught them in a good day! Compared to the other Dairy Queens that I've been too this one is probably the cleanest! I like to look at the surrounding of a place before I order any food from them so in my book at LEAST they got that part right and oh my ice cream was delicious!,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,0,0,4,9MsjCEMi94_OkyiVXLFmhw

After ordering & tipping generously, we were handed two ""Chocolate Lovers"" Blizzards WITHOUT CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.

Sure, this may be a petty thing to complain about, but after bringing up that my favorite Blizzard (that I order EVERY TIME) normally comes with chocolate ice cream, the sad, old a**hole behind the counter (I'd put his name here, but he wasn't wearing a name tag...or gloves... Basically, he just looked like a grumpy, 40+ year old white guy) very rudely decided to finally explain that this location NEVER has chocolate ice cream... only vanilla soft serve... which I find VERY hard to believe. Why would you have a ""Chocolate Lovers"" menu but NO chocolate ice cream?! F*****g bizarre.

Not to mention, he had NO idea what goes in each Blizzard. I watched him go back & forth from the menu to read what to put into the mixer. One of those ingredients being f*****g stale brownies.

We came in last night 4/1/15 and not only was it very akward as we walked in  because of the no hello or welcome. I ordered a snickers blizzard with cheese cake.

I haven't seen them in a while and I decided to check out how their store was doing on yelp. I've been using yelp for the longest time but never created an account until now because I saw some pretty recent negative reviews, which came as a complete shock to me because I knew the owners so well. Anyways, I came in @ 9:30 pm today and noticed a line of 3 people. I didn't know they were supposed to close up already. There was a young man who I did not recognize. Despite that fact that I and 2 other people were holding the store open past their closing time, He still took my order, treated me as any other customer and I didn't even feel as if he was in a rush, I was able to get a few words in with him and I was told they recently changed owners. I guess that explains the bad reviews.  I always order a Medium Turtle Pecan Cluster Blizzard, which is to die for!!! Along with that I always get a large Orange Julius and their Iron Grilled Sandwiches. They're getting 5 starts because of their products, how quick my food was ready and how I was treated that night.

I remember having DQ like once a long time ago at Del Amo Mall in Torrance and I could've sworn that it was expensive, but when me and my girlfriend tried this particular one in Las Vegas, I was surprised at how pretty affordable it is! First off, I love how this DQ was right next to an Albertson's and an L&L Hawaiian BBQ!!!!

Me and my lady ended up getting some 12oz blizzards for only $3.69.  Now...12oz looks and sounds small, but I tell you...these Blizzards are extremely thick, delicious and can fill you up!! PAUSE! (Boondocks ""no homo"" reference).

I also love how DQ has teamed up with Orange Julius and you can even order some pretty decent chilli dogs and other foods aside from ice cream cakes, shakes, etc.

I ended up getting the OREO cookie Blizzard

 and WOW...sooooo damn great for this hot hot Las Vegas weather! The place is very clean and the guy that was working there was nice as hell...he gave me and my lady some great suggestions, plus he gave us some history on how famous DQ has been for so many years and they even have been endorsed and plugged by Donald Trump on his show ""The Apprentice"".  

Honestly, I love how it's cheaper and as great as Cold Stone....it is also wayyyy better and cheaper than Baskin Robbins!  The DQ Blizzards are so damn thick, that you can even flip your cup of blizzard upside down and it won't slide out!!!

So I wait a hour get down here .. Its still not ready. The one doing the decorating .. Tim I believe super nice but why isn't it done. He then tells me he doesn't want it to melt when I walk out side so I should wait a few minutes. Fine.. Still the guy is super nice about it. I order a iced coffee to wait ... The guy in the back comes out with my coffee. Please see the picture this is ridiculous. For one he put spoon in it. Like its a blizzard.  I asked for a different top because it's a blizzard top on a LIQUID spillable drink he gives me a attitude and says that is the only top that fits. Why do you have a attitude with me. Quit if you don't like it. Look at the picture please. And it's not sweet .. Its bitter ....  supposed to be a salted iced Carmel coffee.Now I get my cake .. May 15 minutes not too long .. However the decorations are supposed to be green ... They are blue... Horrible experience. Last time customer at this location.
